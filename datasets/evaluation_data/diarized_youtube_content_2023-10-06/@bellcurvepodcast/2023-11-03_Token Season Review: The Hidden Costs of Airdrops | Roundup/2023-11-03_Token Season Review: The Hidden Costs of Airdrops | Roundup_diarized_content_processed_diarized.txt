00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:26.570 - 00:00:46.442, Speaker B: Solana doesn't worry about that. Solana is purely an application platform and I really respect that. And I think that if you have fundamental growth from your core product, which is the platform, the Token will come, right? I think there will be value there.
00:00:46.496 - 00:01:16.466, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that Blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of Crypto. Goldman, JPMorgan, Zero, 72, all in one room, so you can know what the big money is doing. So click the link at the bottom of this episode, it'll take you right over to the homepage and use Bell 20 for 20% off. And I will see you in sunny London town in March. All right, everyone, welcome back to another other roundup edition of Bell Curve.
00:01:16.466 - 00:01:20.242, Speaker A: Today, you got me and Miles holding down the fort. Mies, welcome back, buddy.
00:01:20.306 - 00:01:22.582, Speaker B: Good to be back. Good to be back once again.
00:01:22.716 - 00:01:30.230, Speaker A: Yeah. Spindrift in hand, I'm rocking a pimple moose lacroix myself. A man of taste refinement.
00:01:30.390 - 00:01:42.106, Speaker B: I love it. We just coined the term chain smoking spindrifts. It was when you're on a seltzer roll and once you're done with one, just straight back to the fridge.
00:01:42.218 - 00:01:47.550, Speaker A: That's the most, like, just turn 30 thing I've ever heard. Like chain smoking.
00:01:50.050 - 00:01:52.606, Speaker B: We've come a long way. We've come a long way.
00:01:52.788 - 00:02:27.946, Speaker A: That we have. All right, let's get into it. I think where I want to spend a good amount of time today is actually discussing the return of Token season. So just within the last of the span of just over a week, we've had it's not a new Token launch, but we've had dYdX go live over on Cosmos, we had Celestia go live, mainnet launched, and now Tia, the Token is trading. They did a little Halloween launch shout out to Celestia. Good on them. We also had Jupiter over on Salana and Pith as well.
00:02:27.946 - 00:03:13.606, Speaker A: So Salana is in a little bit of a league of its own this week. There's breakpoint and obviously the Token has just exploded in price. We're recording this on the second and I think now it's down just below $40. But it had quite a run from basically 19 straight to, I think, over 45. So, lot to touch on Salana and Tokens in general, but maybe Miles. Well, I'll kick it off to you to start with is, I think, one thing that I've been thinking about as a framework and want toss it over and see if it makes sense to you is there's this idea in equity markets of the IPO window being open, which is you don't really want to take your company public when you think you're going to get a subpar valuation. Hence this idea that the market is closed.
00:03:13.606 - 00:03:27.550, Speaker A: But then when the market heats back up, economies roaring, people are ready to speculate again, that IPO window opens and you tend to get these bursts. So I'm wondering if something like that is applicable in crypto and if we're starting to see the Token window open again. Thoughts?
00:03:28.530 - 00:04:27.540, Speaker B: Think you're definitely onto something here. I think there are a lot of teams that were planning on launching tokens a long time ago, and they've shelved it right, because if there's absolutely no speculative demand whatsoever, you're kind of playing that card at the wrong time and not getting any of the benefits. And it definitely feels like we've turned the corner here, where there's maybe like a sweet spot where you want to launch your token. Really? Right before things start picking back up, so that you can have that wealth effect and early adopters. Right. But you don't want to launch your token towards the end of the cycle, then everybody hates you because they bought in at a valuation that just wasn't going to sustain itself beyond the next six months. And there's lots of projects like that that are unfortunately down like 99%, and it's hard to tell really where their community is at today.
00:04:27.540 - 00:05:25.300, Speaker B: And I think we're getting into that sweet spot right now. Maybe we're getting a little ahead of our skis. Maybe the projects that launch end up finding out that, okay, the market is actually not back, and it won't be back for another year or two, but there's enough there enough momentum there, I think, particularly in the solana. Ecosystem that I think we're going to see. A lot of these a lot of projects that have PMF or some semblance of it have been holding off on their token for a long time. Maybe they have like a point system or something like that just to have teased it to users. And now they're kind of coming around, right, because they can feel Solana going up, the speculative dollars coming back into the ecosystem that's bringing up TVL, and they just need to light the spark with the token and let it run from there.
00:05:25.300 - 00:06:15.090, Speaker B: Yeah, so I totally agree with you whether or not we have the same sort of strategies of token distribution and bootstrapping as the last cycle will see, but we're definitely hitting that sweet spot. And I would say just one other thing with the Cosmos launches, that's a little bit different, right, because those are not projects that have been live for a long time. The Token launch comes with the chain launch, right? And so that could change over time, by the way, whether it's new ways to build Cosmos chains that don't need a native gas token. But I would just say it's a little bit different in that these projects are coming alive for the first time versus on Solana now. You can just actually speculate on them.
00:06:15.240 - 00:07:11.826, Speaker A: Yeah. So a lot of different ground cover. I do want to get into your thoughts on the strategy, right? Maybe we can put our operator caps on here and try to speculate about what the strategy for an AirDrop or Incentives would look like this time around and how, if at all, it's going to look different from what projects did back in the 2020 2021 era. Be very interested to get your thoughts there. Completely agree with you on the sentiment that the strategy here is you want to try to find the sweet spot of launching when there's a little bit of excitement and try to maximize the amount of revenue that you can bring into the treasury or reserves that you can bring into the treasury rather. But at the same time, what you definitely do not want to do is launch at the absolute peak, have down only there's no better way to kill a promising project, right, or have VCs be dumping their token allocation, which is obviously not popular with the to. Before we get into I think it probably makes sense to start with Solana here, but before we do, I just want to give a here's another framework, mine.
00:07:11.826 - 00:08:05.702, Speaker A: I'll see if you agree with this, but in terms of one of the things that I think needs to happen that catalyzes a bull market in crypto, first, Bitcoin has to run, but I think you described it really well, which is this idea of a wealth effect. So in order for there to be a real sustainable bull market, which is why I always push back on that friend tech is going to take us into the next bull market. No, it's not going to take us that's PvP game action there. And those numbers are down quite a bit, by the way. But really what we need is the common bag that everyone holds to go way up, everyone starts to feel very wealthy and then they reinvest those perceived gains like their casino chips into projects X, Y and Z, right? And all the time that you're sort of building leverage. So that's why you need to see the run in the majors, which we obviously are seeing a little bit in Bitcoin and ETH. But Solana has really been in a league of its own here and I know you've got a couple folks on the ground over in Breakpoint, so do we.
00:08:05.702 - 00:08:13.610, Speaker A: So I'm happy to relate some of what I've been hearing, but what do you ascribe to this massive run up in Solana here?
00:08:13.760 - 00:09:15.310, Speaker B: It's interesting, I think there's a lot there. First of all, I think it's very clear that there's been a big community that's continued building through really the darkest parts of the bear market where it hit Solana. And so there's that community, that sense of community is strong and there's really good builders that are, I would say, building for users. I think the other part is more of like a tech narrative piece where if you think about this time last year, or maybe a little bit before this time last year, dYdX had just announced they're going to Cosmos and there's this large app chain narrative that really took over. We saw all the roll ups going from basically being little mini L1s to saying, no, this is a roll up framework. We're going to have a ton of these roll ups that's kind of going to be app specific, et cetera, et cetera. We had tons of infrastructure built to try to handle all of this new complexity.
00:09:15.310 - 00:10:19.860, Speaker B: And now we're getting to a point where I think you could argue the narrative is maybe we overbuilt for app chains right now. Maybe a lot of that additional complexity isn't worth it if you can get those benefits of speed and noisy neighbor problems on a highly performant l one, which one is still around? Which one still has a great community? Salana and so that's maybe coming from my Cosmos roles and Ulta being really close to the roll ups and the Ras providers is what I'm seeing is that we've got more infrastructure here and more infrastructure providers for app chains than there are developers who want to build app chains. And I guess the simplicity of just launching on a highly performant L1 is definitely starting to appeal to folks. So that, I think, is the narrative component to this. But I'm curious to hear if you agree.
00:10:20.310 - 00:11:36.182, Speaker A: I would agree with that. I've been very positive on Solana for a while. There's a broader sort of architecture decision that I think that they made the right call on which is largely letting hardware scale with Moore's Law to accommodate for just higher throughput on the main like the E scaling solution. Has essentially been, and by the way, I say this as a lover of ethereum, but where I would quibble with is this sort of very narrow definition of decentralization that exists there, which is we are going to keep the hardware requirements extremely low based on this sort of static definition of who can opt in and run a full node on the chain. Whereas I think the Solana version is to say and so most scaling solutions in ETH, whether it's coprocessors like Axiom or if it's roll ups, is just to say let's just take this computation and move it to this other chain that we're going to sort of batch transactions or submit proofs and then we'll just verify it on main chain. Whereas I think the Solana where Solana is very ahead and something that they were right about was okay. Even if you do some things like that, ultimately you're still going to want to maximize throughput on that main chain and that actually has some immediate benefits just in terms of much less complexity.
00:11:36.182 - 00:12:20.054, Speaker A: You probably get a lot of the benefits of app chains by the local fee markets and solving the noise and neighbor problem and you don't fragment liquidity, which is a little bit of a challenge. I think all of that is absolutely true. There's a huge narrative and community aspect to this. I'm not a tradeor by any means, but what I think has surprised me is the way probably it looks like the crypto natives were positioned here. I think ETH has just been such a consensus play for such a long time. Probably most of the buying for ETH that was going to happen has already gotten done. I think ETH is probably it's going to do great and it's still probably the best risk reward play and is set to run here.
00:12:20.054 - 00:12:48.420, Speaker A: But it just looks like Solana was under owned. There were some shorts out on it and I think the run up that you saw was just a pretty classic short squeeze. And I think this will probably have a pretty big effect in terms of waking the market up to the idea that Solana is a robust community and here to stay. Because I think you and I have always had open minds about this. I've been positive on it for a little while, but I think a good portion of Crypto had and the crypto native bid had counted it out for a long time.
00:12:49.670 - 00:13:51.526, Speaker B: I think that's probably right. I think the EVM is still the dominant developer, I guess environment, execution environment. The SVM, I would say, has really come probably in second at this point and you can tell that the folks have been building on have been there for a while, which means that the tooling around it is getting much better. Projects like helios are great. And yeah, I think that that is appealing to new developers that are looking across the space. And I would say the other thing is I feel like with Ethereum there's a tension between the product of the Token and the product of the application platform. A lot of the design choices that have been made towards maximizing decentralization, which then kind of makes the underlying asset more attractive, have really detracted from the developer experience there.
00:13:51.526 - 00:14:36.930, Speaker B: And even just in terms of the rake that Ethereum takes off of fees right is pretty egregious. And so Solana doesn't worry about that. Solana is purely an application platform and I really respect that. And I think that if you have fundamental growth from your core product, which is the platform, the Token will come. Right. I think there will be value there. By not trying to, I guess, straddle both sides of competing with Bitcoin and competing with other application platforms solana has been able know, I would say avoid some of these trade offs that Ethereum has had to deal with.
00:14:37.000 - 00:15:06.782, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that Blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of Crypto. We are gathering 1200 of the world's largest asset managers. So think TradFi, macro funds, crypto, native funds, big allocators and financial institutions. So banks, payment processors, et cetera, all in one spot. It's very rare to get the likes of Goldman, JPMorgan Zero, 72, whatever, all in one room.
00:15:06.782 - 00:15:33.430, Speaker A: So you can know what the big money is doing. We're diving into the themes that they care about. So we're talking about the intersection of Macro and Crypto, where we are in the cycle, real world assets. So everything from stablecoins to onchain treasuries to Tokenized assets, it's going to be a blast. But the other reason you really want to go is London baby, center of the world. At one point you got pub culture, you got fish and chips, great beer, it's going to be a blast. So, because you're such great listeners to Bell Curve, there's a code, Bell 20, that's going to get you 20% off.
00:15:33.430 - 00:15:55.600, Speaker A: So click the link at the bottom of this episode, it'll take you right over to the homepage, you'll see all of our speakers and use Bell 20 for 20% off. Ticket prices are going up soon. Make sure you go use that code. I will see you in sunny London town in March. I'm a little torn on this. I have never been a huge fan of the ultrasound money. Meme on Ethereum or ETH is ultrasound money.
00:15:55.600 - 00:16:50.030, Speaker A: But on the one hand, I do sort of wonder if Ethereum is just a little bit ahead in its roadmap from something like Solana. So Solana today can say we don't care about this value accrual to the Token and we're just going to build the best platform. But again, my framework for how these ecosystems grow is this money wealth creation effect that happens by appreciation in the base layer token. I mean, that's the best marketing, call it customer acquisition, content marketing, money illusion, whatever it is. I feel like the way that these cycles get catalyzed and start is base price token goes up and then that acts as a rising tide, lifts all boats for everything that is built on those. You know, on the one hand, I do agree. I think one of the ways that Solana has positioned itself relative to ETH is saying we're a tech platform, we don't care about this idea of being a money, which is probably a good thing.
00:16:50.030 - 00:17:03.358, Speaker A: But I do wonder if they will have to revisit their fee model eventually and start to think about value accrual in a couple of years because I do think that that's just a winning model in terms of attracting new apps to the ecosystem.
00:17:03.454 - 00:17:40.362, Speaker B: I'm not sure what they'll do though, because with Ethereum it was like fees were egregious. They were just all going to the supply side of miners. Right, right. And so all you had to do is just flip a switch and say, actually no, we're going to burn the majority of those fees that were going to miners and now they become revenue. Look at our PNL. Like we just went from negative like 2 billion in losses per year to cash flow positive with Salana, there's not a ton of value that is flowing either to the supply side or to the token holders in the first place. It's very cheap to use this chain.
00:17:40.362 - 00:17:40.750, Speaker B: Right.
00:17:40.820 - 00:17:41.342, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:17:41.476 - 00:18:26.560, Speaker B: And I think that any sort of like auction enshrined auction is a drag towards for mev, is a drag towards to latency, which is again, probably going to be a tough design trade off for them to make because that is really what they're optimizing for. Right. And so if you can just get enough applications and volumes and transactions and you actually have millions or hundreds of millions of people using applications on this chain, I don't think there needs to be some sort of financial engineering that's equivalent to the base fee switch for Ethereum. But I do see what you mean.
00:18:27.330 - 00:19:06.454, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm not 100%, I don't have my mind made up on that. I think there's two ways that you could look at fees, which is fees are a form of value accrual or they're sort of a rate limiting system right. To prevent DDoS attacks or spamming the that there's probably a spectrum there. And I would just say that it feels like the ETH camp on today is a little bit more in the camp of more fees equal good. And I feel like the way the salona camp thinks about it is more of a spam limiting probably just because at one point fees were just one cents or whatever and they had a huge spam problem. So maybe just that there's that cultural difference and that's how they think of the fees.
00:19:06.582 - 00:19:49.366, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I think that's fair. And the local fee market feature is so cool in my opinion. Like really one of the more interesting innovations that have come out for a while and speaking to the Jito guys, you could implement, I guess, auctions on an account level. Right. And so that if there is you've got like an NFT man or something like that, that you know, is going to absolutely end up with transactions spamming this account. You have a way to, I guess, increase the base fees to deter spam. But you can also just implement some sort of auction if it's a use case that doesn't need that sort of insanely high latency and then turn it off right.
00:19:49.366 - 00:19:54.460, Speaker B: When that period of, I guess, you know, the huge activity is over.
00:19:55.150 - 00:20:39.580, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of really cool stuff that you could do there. One of the challenges that I think that the Jito folks think a lot about is just salon obviously has much shorter block times. I think it's about 400 milliseconds is the average one of the design parameters. It seems like from the Salana perspective is just shortening those block times because it does solve a lot of the stuff that people on ETH end up thinking a lot about with like mev and loss versus rebalancing those problems. Do you do solve some of the problem, not all of it by just shortening the block times. So actually a lot of the Dex designers over on ETH are like shorter block times. Guys, this would be great, but there is a certain amount of time that you just need to run an auction as well.
00:20:39.580 - 00:20:41.340, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly.
00:20:41.710 - 00:20:58.410, Speaker B: And honestly, I think even at 400 milliseconds, there are still DEXes there that are saying this latency, it's still too slow. We're not getting the institutional traders still because even this is too slow. They're not profitable.
00:20:58.570 - 00:20:58.846, Speaker A: Right.
00:20:58.868 - 00:21:16.814, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I think they'll just continue driving that down. But I think that's worth it because it brings on that unlocks all these different user types that now are like, oh, okay, this is literally the same thing as a centralized exchange. I can feel pretty confident in running these same strategies.
00:21:16.862 - 00:22:22.938, Speaker A: Now let me ask you something. This is going to sound like a little bit of a deviation, but in one of our recent episodes that we did, we were talking about a framework for looking at layer ones either as a commodity or like an operating system. And we were talking about them as being these different ways that you could look at it. But what if you looked at layer ones as existing on a scale of something like a commodity to something like an operating system? Does that make sense? And the simpler the parameters are around your operating system and the less performant and therefore the less complexity you absorb, the more commodity, like the unit of accounting is within your layer one, whereas the more complexity that you absorb, the more tech and performant it is. You kind of need to have a different structure to support something like that. And you take on different assumptions and then it starts to look more operating system esque and they might actually exist on like a continuum there actually what do you think about that idea?
00:22:23.024 - 00:22:53.620, Speaker B: It's interesting. I just kind of view them as a little bit more separate. Right. I think that we used to talk about bitcoin big b and little b. Right. And so the product is the operating system. But I do agree with you that the design of the product and what the product is optimizing for does have an impact on the underlying asset and can make it look more like a commodity or more like an think.
00:22:53.620 - 00:23:46.610, Speaker B: I'm not sure where you would say like ethereum fits versus Solana in that comparison, though, because Solana is optimized to be the operating system piece. Right. But in many ways that actually makes the role of Solana more straightforward than what the role of ETH is going to be looking like in this roll up world. Right? If anything, it's like once you have to push that to the roll up side. We've talked about it a little bit. You start to fragment. I would say investment fragment, even use of gas tokens from a commodity standpoint, if there's like $5,000 coming in to bet on the ethereum ecosystem, maybe now some of that goes to the roll up tokens themselves instead of all going to ethereum.
00:23:46.610 - 00:23:56.214, Speaker B: Maybe some of the roll ups actually end up using their own token for gas, which still they have to buy ethereum to post data and stuff like that.
00:23:56.252 - 00:23:56.840, Speaker A: But.
00:23:58.810 - 00:24:02.710, Speaker B: I don't think it's as straightforward as it might seem.
00:24:02.870 - 00:25:06.714, Speaker A: Yeah, I do want to reiterate here because some of this is seeming like criticism of ethereum and it's not really how I feel. But that point that you just said has been my theory for a little while and I haven't heard anyone else say this, so I feel a little just putting it out to either. But I just think the most left curve explanation here is that if you had $1,000 to invest in Ethereum in 2019 or 2020, you put $1,000 into ethereum, but now you might put 500 into Ethereum and 250 into arbitrary, 250 into optimism. And I guess we'll have to wait for a couple of months or maybe like a year maybe people will start looking at the ARB ETH or Op ETH sort of charts to get relative strength there. But yeah, I think that's sort of going to continue to be a factor here. But I don't really want to speculate too much on price here and that's not super important at the end of the day anyway. I do want to get a sense, I mean, you've got folks on the ground over there in Breakpoint.
00:25:06.714 - 00:25:35.938, Speaker A: We've got the same and from what I've heard, people generally the exact description is people feel like they're sitting on a pot of gold. Vibes could not be higher, I think. Solid mix of builder to investor, which is what you'd love to see. Actually pretty famously. I did go to the first Breakpoint in 2021 and that was off. There was way more investors than builders, which is not what you want to see. That was extremely hypey, very top signal.
00:25:35.938 - 00:25:50.458, Speaker A: That's not the vibe that I'm getting now. It seems pretty builder oriented. It seems like folks are having fun. I saw totally dressed as that meme of the silly dragon or whatever, like the third head of the dragon. Yeah, I don't know.
00:25:50.544 - 00:26:59.730, Speaker B: What have you heard no same. I think they're very aware that the tides have turned towards their favor. I think what will be interesting, at least personally for me, is just to see what the mix of developers ends up looking like. Because last time when Solana was coming up, it was really just like net new developers going into Solana, right? It wasn't like they were stealing a lot of ethereum devs or something like that. And now they're coming into whenever this activity picks back up, they actually have a large community of their own, developers like Solana native developers. I still think they're very appealing to that net new developer because a lot of it resonates with them from web two. So, yeah, I think it will be interesting to see at the application level if the stars of Salana are like those projects that have stuck through the bear market or if it's going to be a lot similar to last time, a wave of net new projects.
00:27:00.230 - 00:27:26.298, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd be very curious as well. The pool of developers in Rust is much larger, obviously, than Solidity. Solidity is the dominant, still smart contracting language, but smaller overall pool when you look at it just in the grand scheme. Although I do think there are efforts, this is what Giorgios is doing, right, from paradigm to actually bring Rust into Ethereum as well.
00:27:26.464 - 00:27:29.366, Speaker B: And Arbitrum did it too, and Arbitrum.
00:27:29.398 - 00:28:16.406, Speaker A: So that might actually be a non. Yes, stylus by Arbitrum is a super cool project, so that might actually end up being not as much of a factor here. One thing that probably we should talk about, because I think it's going to be a big catalyst for this is sort of the wave, right? So we had the run up in price from Salana from between 15 and $20 wherever it's hovering, to around 40 today. And there have been a bunch of projects that have quality projects that have gotten funded within the last year or so. And the question is, when were they going to launch? You know, you've seen Gito, who we've had Lucas and some of the other guys we've had on the podcast before, so they've launched their points. So obviously this is speculation, I don't know, but you would assume that a token is coming after points. Same thing with marginfi.
00:28:16.406 - 00:28:36.130, Speaker A: You just had within the last week. You had Pith announce its token launch, you had Jupiter announce a token launch as well. And I would guess there's probably going to be quite a bit more of that over in the Solana ecosystem, which might make Solana kind of an interesting place to be or to spend some time and focus.
00:28:36.280 - 00:29:21.386, Speaker B: Yeah, totally. Again, I think they're like playing that card at the right time, if anything. Like maybe a tad early. But I think it makes sense, honestly, to try to drive that themselves. And they have good usage, good products will be very interesting to see if they. Try to kind of evolve some of the strategies from last cycle in terms of looking to see what worked well, what didn't. There's probably a lot of low hanging fruit there and yeah, I think in general I can only see TVL kind of going up from here with Solana.
00:29:21.386 - 00:30:05.758, Speaker B: I mean it's been so low for so long. But the idea here is that solana also has some mainstream recognition. Like if I describe Tokens to Normies it's now in know bitcoin ethereum solana and they usually have heard about it. And a big part of this also is not just wealth effect for the early adopters, but kind of this inevitable FOMO that ends up happening when people start CNBC starts saying, like, oh, crypto's roaring back and et cetera, et cetera. And then you get in. Net new. Maybe maybe it's time.
00:30:05.758 - 00:30:06.480, Speaker B: Maybe.
00:30:07.250 - 00:30:45.274, Speaker A: Look at this is a pretty man. The ups and downs of crypto. The human psyche was not meant to bear these levels of volatility. I mean this is just tough. Look at this, this is a TVL chart. And by the way, I do think TVL I'm glad that people are waking up to this as being not a broken metric but you can't just one size fits all. But look at this run up here in 2021 in the span of a year, just under a year to 9 billion from basically zero to 9 billion and then from 9 billion it dropped down to 200 some million.
00:30:45.274 - 00:31:56.018, Speaker A: And just now, even now it's almost still a little bit early to talk about recovering. It's been a good trend but only since the beginning of this year even relative to there was a headline a couple of months ago, maybe a month, a month and a half ago that base overtook the entire Solana TVL look not financial advice is a non financial advice corner but that does feel pretty exciting, right? I mean a chain with so much mind share kind of coming out of the gutter and still pretty early here in terms of TVL and rebooting adoption. So yeah, we're rooting for our friends over there and I think it'll be an interesting ecosystem to watch. Maybe we could talk a little miles, I'd love to get your thoughts. I know you and I have debated about the return on investment of doing things like incentive programs, airdrops, things like that. I got a couple of charts to show you here, maybe one we can debate. I think we showed this last week but you and I talk about this a lot and I was actually wanting to get your opinion on it.
00:31:56.018 - 00:32:31.754, Speaker A: But here is a chart hasu retweeted it but I think it originally came from yeah, Richard Chen about the cost of airdrops of some of these major ecosystems. So dYdX uniswap Arbitrum blur ENS optimism and the ranges here of dYdX, the cost of the AirDrop was 1.4 billion, uniswap is 657,000,000 arbitram just under 1.4 billion, blur, 342,000,000, ENS, almost 1.2 billion. And then optimism, 234,000,000. Big numbers.
00:32:31.754 - 00:32:47.890, Speaker A: Obviously we're talking about some of the most successful protocols in all of crypto. What are your thoughts on airdrops? Were these worth it, do you think? And then maybe we can get into some of the more nitty gritty tactical stuff of how the strategy for airdrops are changing.
00:32:50.950 - 00:33:38.420, Speaker B: There's airdrops and I would almost have that kind of maybe be separate than some of the ongoing incentives for usage as well. And I think the airdrops, there's no way you could look at those numbers and say that was a good decision. Like on paper. On paper, that was a good decision. Most of these projects, even as successful as they are, have not generated anything near what those numbers represent, nor have they retained most of the users that received those airdrops. There's no really arguing against that. But does that in itself make this clear that these were really bad decisions? It's less clear.
00:33:38.420 - 00:35:02.640, Speaker B: I don't know if projects would admit this or if maybe I'm off here, but I do feel like there is, or at least last cycle there was. This is kind of not really a choice for these protocols. It's kind of the cost of also being a dow and having that be the norm. In order for people to use your product, you have to get these tokens out there somehow, right? If you've chosen the token path, which they've obviously all have, and at that point you're not even looking at profitability. I don't think there's anybody on these teams who was monitoring the airdrops and showing like, okay, was this a know, what are the CAC metrics? Like, what are our retention of think? Because even if you got the numbers and they were terrible, I think the decision was like, it's still already made that we need to get x amount of this token out of our ownership and into the community. So it's not like there's super strong financial logic, I would say informing a lot of this stuff, or at least there hasn't been in the past. Now, do I still think there's lots of room to move forward and improve that? Yes.
00:35:02.640 - 00:36:17.890, Speaker B: And can you still find ways to distribute those large allocations of token supply to the public? I still think so as well. And we started to see this a little bit towards the end of the last cycle. And today, sometimes there's multiple steps to claiming an AirDrop, right? You have to do this, do this little task, do that, at least try, like bare minimum, perform some actions, vote on something right to get your full AirDrop. And I think at the very least you should be doing that. Have the civil protection in there, which is still a struggle, it seems like for a lot of projects, have some sort of drawn out, sort of distribution even to the first people that are selected and whitelisted. Those that continue using the platform should get outsized allocations. I don't think this only backwards looking on chain history piece really makes a ton of sense, but I will say they also have been maybe last thing I've noticed that airdrops are getting a little bit more strategic in terms of not just looking at on chain activity.
00:36:17.890 - 00:36:41.280, Speaker B: You see like all the contributors of for Celestia at least it was like all the contributors know, even some bitcoin repos Ethereum, repos Cosmos basically all know influential stakeholders from the development communities that they want to pull from got an allocation and I think that we're getting there.
00:36:41.890 - 00:37:24.006, Speaker A: So Celestia got a little bit of pushback. I would say just in terms of that, we're looking at the Celestia's token allocation here. Overall it's actually a very good launch. Sorry, I didn't mean to start off on a negative foot there, but overall I would say very successful launch for Celestia. We're looking at a chart of the token allocation here. First of all, this is created by Masari. I think Masari did Celestia a little bit dirty here by labeling this whole group as insiders, which is just optically not great and I don't think super fair in terms of but the breakout for those who are following along, just the audio.
00:37:24.006 - 00:37:50.494, Speaker A: 17.6% went to the initial core contributors, 15.9% went to early backers seed, 19.7% went to early backers series A and B. So that's a combined 35%, 26.8% is going to R and D and ecosystem and then there's a public allocation of 20% some for the Genesis drop and incentivized testnet and then 12.6 for future initiatives.
00:37:50.494 - 00:38:46.366, Speaker A: So I don't know, there was a lot of pushback on this, not a lot, there was some pushback and I don't know, I'm a little bit torn. I actually kind of push back on the pushback because on the one hand I think there's a lot of people who've been investing in crypto for a long time who are scarred by sometimes unfair but sometimes fair accusations of VC dumping. I am personally of the opinion that VCs get kind of a bad rap in crypto. This space would not exist without VCs. A lot of these companies during this period of time would just flat out go out of business if you didn't have people that were willing to underwrite good businesses at this period of time. Now, that's not to say every VC is totally great and there have been some sort of egregious examples in the past of just dumping these sort of VC. They tend to be layer ones that end up getting no adoption and retail just gets flogged.
00:38:46.366 - 00:39:28.994, Speaker A: So I think there's some legitimate pushback there. But I do think on the other hand, a lot of the time the accounts that you see doing this and I'm not picking on this, is thicky thought who I like a lot. And we went back and forth in Twitter on this I pushed back a little bit. I do think there's a little bit of entitlement sometimes entitlement from people who just say I deserve to get this huge allocation that I'm just going to turn around and dump. Let's be honest, I don't want these VCs to dump on me. I should be doing the dumping is my interpretation of a lot of this pushback. And I don't know, I'm kind of like if anything, I'm looking at this okay, maybe the allocation to investors looks a little high.
00:39:28.994 - 00:39:52.394, Speaker A: I mean, if anything, this looks low to the team. I would prefer a good healthy amount going to the team and being reserved for future contributors. I don't know. I do think there's a little bit of entitlement sometimes in crypto, like give some to the community. But why are we just giving stuff away to the community? I don't actually understand that.
00:39:52.512 - 00:40:55.146, Speaker B: Yeah, there's got to be like a strategic reason. Kind of like going back to the previous point we were talking about because on paper it looks like a very bad financial decision for these teams just to be giving it away. I won't speak to the percentages there and whether or not that's justified, but in general, I completely agree with you. You have to put yourself in the shoes of these projects and they need to make decisions with their token that are going to lead to help their chances of maximizing that end state. Right. Becoming the biggest version of themselves that they can be and just giving a bunch of speculators tokens that they can immediately dump doesn't really move you towards that. I will say for this one, it is super unique because there is no activity that happens on Celestia.
00:40:55.146 - 00:42:00.414, Speaker B: So it's not like there's users, like retail users on Celestia that need Tia to pay for gas, right? The only users of Tia will be the roll ups themselves. The roll ups will need to obviously hold Tia to post data. And you really want like in a perfect world for Celestia, they're trying know position this token to know as much as possible used by the roll ups for and then then it gets into the hands of the right because the users won't be on Celestia. And so I think a lot of this is for them. If I were in their seat, it would be like how do we ensure that Tia is the base asset of the roll ups that use us? Or how do we make sure that it is one of the most commonly held assets. Of course that detracts a little bit against trying to attract roll ups that want to have their own gas token. And so it's just about striking that right balance.
00:42:00.414 - 00:42:48.734, Speaker B: And so I don't think that the AirDrop is the most important part here. I think it's probably what comes later. I would also mention that with Celestia there's no token governance unlike other cosmos chains and unlike roll ups like Optimism and Arbitrum. There's no way to have this big allocation of an incentive allocation that we see with Optimism and arbitram. And Cosmos chains, they're all voting of how to, like, which projects on their roll up should get incentives, or with Osmosis or something like that, which pools should get incentives, or lending protocols, et cetera, et cetera. That's all voted through governance. And that's not possible on Celestia.
00:42:48.734 - 00:43:01.250, Speaker B: And it's really the opposite of what they're optimizing for. They want it to, like, as minimal as possible. So maybe just to add a little color there on why it's not apples to apples.
00:43:01.410 - 00:44:17.242, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree with that. Celestia is interesting for a couple of reasons. So Celestia, to me, I think what makes it unique is that it is an L1, right? It obviously comes from the Cosmos ecosystem and is an L1, but it's not quite as clear to me, and I could be wrong here, and maybe some folks in the Celestia team can correct me if they're listening, but it feels like the customer for Celestia is developers, right? Not necessarily like retail users. So it makes it interesting from a marketing perspective in terms of who you're trying to reach. And what I would liken it to is, I think, all right? In the same way that in the United States, pharmaceutical companies run ads for their various medications, even though it's going to be doctors that recommend it. It's kind of like you have an end consumer that you want to have a brand with, but you also have this intermediate figure standing between you, which in this case, would be the doctor's office that prescribes that medication. So you want to kind of go around them market to your end consumer so that they say positive things to the doctor's office, and then that you use that drug instead of other generic drug, XYZ.
00:44:17.242 - 00:44:23.710, Speaker A: I think there's some element of that that's probably relevant from the go to market perspective for Celestia.
00:44:24.370 - 00:45:11.326, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Celestia, its DA solution, is trying to pull from two ecosystems. It's trying to get Cosmos developers. They're saying to Cosmos developers, listen, you get pretty much all the benefits of a Cosmos chain without the cost in having to deal with this validator set to ethereum roll up devs. They're saying, Listen, your roll up is probably economically not viable because of how ethereum's DA costs. You can have an actual profitable roll up if you use Celestia. And I think the token is the way to get to the end customer, or at least build brand awareness with the end customer. So I think that that's a separate sort of product for them.
00:45:11.326 - 00:45:19.554, Speaker B: The asset itself is a separate product. Who they're going after with the asset is separately than who they're trying to get to use the network itself.
00:45:19.752 - 00:46:27.490, Speaker A: Yeah, I completely agree with that. The other thing I like about Celestia is I think that they've got this idea. I really like their light notes is what I like as a solution. Because going back to that observation that we were talking about sort of a limited definition of what decentralization is basically being able to read and write to copies of this shared database and so having the least common denominator of that hardware be extremely low or very accessible, that's very challenging from the throughputs of the system. I think Celestia and this would be the cosmos point of view and maybe solana gets there too, they kind of have tiny dancers. I do think that light clients are very interesting solution for how to keep the integrity of blockchains. Maybe at the end of the day you have something where you have professional sort of node operators that are actually performing a lot of the work that's building and validating blocks, but then users, it's super cheap and easy like on your phone you can just verify that all of the rules in this system are being followed.
00:46:27.490 - 00:46:34.054, Speaker A: Maybe that's good enough. I don't know, I sort of feel like the Celestia light node innovation is I am a big fan.
00:46:34.182 - 00:47:15.382, Speaker B: Yeah, is it users or is it like you go to wallets and you have wallets start using light nodes to pull data instead of using infura or other RPC data providers. To me, I think I agree with you, it gets to the end user. But if I was trying to make that reality a thing, who am I actually going to go to? I'm probably going to go and try to convince wallet providers to do that. Of course MetaMask probably wants to use infira, but anyways, yeah, I agree with you and I think that that's where we're heading with a lot of this.
00:47:15.516 - 00:47:38.800, Speaker A: All right, let me ask you this. Let's say you are put in charge, you are now the head of COO or head of strategy at Celestia. And I'm asking Miles, how are we going to compete with inda sort of more native ethereum solution? What's the playbook, do you think, for how Celestia competes from a data availability mean?
00:47:39.170 - 00:48:30.640, Speaker B: It's a good question, because I think that Know is their main competitor. And I would just say that Celestia has if I were in their shoes, the way I would frame it is we've been focused on one thing and being the absolute best at that one thing. And on paper, I'd be interested to see just how the metrics compare. But if you can build better products using Celestia, then that's your main pitch. It's unclear to me exactly with eigenda just how much of ethereum you're getting with better performance. And I think that you'll need to view these alternative DA solutions as you're not getting the market cap of ethereum as your security. Right.
00:48:30.640 - 00:48:54.120, Speaker B: We're going to start teasing out what the real trade offs here are and I'm really sick of the words like alignment and enshrinement. I feel like, I'm so excited for us to stop having alignment as a strategy. But that's just me personally. We've been hearing too much for too long.
00:48:54.490 - 00:49:48.022, Speaker A: I'm with you on that. I'm not a huge fan either here's. The issue with it, I think, is it prevents spreading good, unique ideas across. Part of the reason why I advocate I think it's actually quite a good thing that you have multiple different ecosystems out there in the world is because the infrastructure problem we're trying to solve with Blockchains is actually immense. And from an organizational standpoint, you do end up getting a better outcome if you have instead of everyone just trying to solve everything at once. If you do have these ecosystems that optimize for data availability and you get cool innovations like data availability, sampling like Mustafa VIT Celestia pioneered. And you have maybe Solana which is focused on the actual execution layer and throughput of the chain whereas Ethereum is leading the way on validity proofs things like that.
00:49:48.022 - 00:50:35.506, Speaker A: I think all of that is really good. But when you have a really tribal approach to it, which a lot of people in crypto do, you miss some of the innovations on these other chains. You know, actually a good one that there was a really interesting it's been a while since we've talked about at the show and I'll put my hand up and say I haven't been paying a lot of attention to this ecosystem. But Avalanche Patrick O'Grady over there actually put forth a really interesting proposal. I can share my screen about the road to the path to 100,000 subnets overhauling the relationship between the Avalanche primary network and subnets. And what's interesting about this is I actually had to refresh myself with the design of Avalanche. But they have three chains.
00:50:35.506 - 00:51:11.890, Speaker A: They have the C chain, the P chain and the X chain. And they have different subnets. And subnets. You can sort of think it's very actually similar to it's kind of like a mix between sort of a Cosmos like architecture and sort of roll ups like a HyperChain architecture like you might see on ZK Sync. And what's cool about it is you can be a subnet validator. There's a high fixed cost to doing that. The problem with it is you can basically be a validator for the P chain which is sort of this messaging system between different subnets.
00:51:11.890 - 00:51:53.114, Speaker A: And then to be a subnet validator you have to actually validate the PCHAIN as well. There's a very high fixed cost to doing that. But it basically is a really good interoperability solution in between these different subnets. The problem is the economics of subnets are almost perfectly inverse with the economics of roll ups on Ethereum. So roll ups on Ethereum are extremely low fixed cost, very high variable costs which is good for startups at the beginning. The problem is once you hit scale, those costs just never go away. And data availability is this massive sort of intractable not intractable because you've got Eigenda and Celestia for solutions, but it's just variable cost, whereas it's almost the opposite.
00:51:53.114 - 00:52:05.966, Speaker A: In avalanche subnets, there's a high fixed cost, but it's very low variable. So not so good for startups because you don't want to have this super high fixed cost, which then you don't even know if it's like polka dot.
00:52:05.998 - 00:52:08.370, Speaker B: Right? That was their issue as well.
00:52:08.520 - 00:52:47.620, Speaker A: It's exactly like polkadot and I don't know anything. I was getting dinner with mutual friend of ours, actually last night who mentioned that there might be some innovations over there, but this was a debate, right? This like, what is the economics of these sort of app chains going to be? And I think parachains were actually much more extreme where there was very, very high fixed costs. You had to apply to be a parachain. How many were there? There were only like 14 or something like that. Yeah, extremely limited, very expensive. I would say that model didn't work at all. Avalanche is a little less extreme, I think there's fixed cost of like it's in the range of like $30,000 or something like that.
00:52:47.620 - 00:53:32.000, Speaker A: It's high, but it's not absolutely crazy. But still too high for startups. So what they're starting to do is they're relaxing the requirements for being a subnet validator. So you don't have to validate the main chain, but you have to bond some amount of AVAX or something like that. So they're reducing again, it's just this like instead of thinking about these things in a very tribalistic like this good, that bad, what these different ecosystems are doing, they're toying with the economic models until they find this equilibrium solution that makes sense for where applications are at. And I think if you were to be really tribal about it and ignore what other ecosystems are doing, you'd miss some really cool stuff.
00:53:32.470 - 00:54:13.950, Speaker B: No pay attention, pull in the best practices, take those experiments and run with them in your own ecosystems. I think a lot of that's actually starting to go on. I would say more and more now because just reading that a lot of that sounds familiar to, I would say even Cosmos interchange security scaling issues. And it sounds similar to what eigen layer like Avs will have to deal with. So I couldn't agree more. And I don't know, it feels like the tribalness is maybe dying down. Maybe that's just me.
00:54:13.950 - 00:54:43.990, Speaker B: But it kind of comes and goes in waves of jealousy or one ecosystem cutting corners, right. And not marketing it. Truthfully. That's another thing here. And so I think it's all okay, but it feels like there's a good cohort of folks that are actually pretty open minded across all of these things and just looking for the best solution.
00:54:44.970 - 00:55:28.358, Speaker A: Yeah, I think so. I wish it was a little bit even broader. And part of the reason why this ends up happening too, you can already see it just because we've been being so kind to Solana. A little bit of not admonishment, but Solana went on one run and they're already dunking all over the ETH people and it's like, guys, let's just break this. Like we could just not dunk on each other when our coin runs. And it is funny because initially I think the Ethereum people just got so smacked around by the bitcoiners who I think had a pretty not graceful perspective towards Ethereum. Then they sort of took that and learned it and applied it to Solana and so the chain of harassment goes.
00:55:28.524 - 00:56:34.022, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the upcoming one that I'm interested to see is how folks react to these DA solutions now that they're actually coming out. You could see somebody throwing around like questionable DA solutions, quote unquote, aka Celestia. But could you poke similar holes in eigenda? Even though it's more Ethereum aligned? I'm sure that there are design decisions that the Celestia team will look to as counterpoints or avail or espresso. Right. I think is there going to be looking at, I would say the canonical roll up that uses Ethereum for everything is going to come under attack soon and there's not going to be as many that are viable to do that. But Vitalik, you know, had a great post this week just reminding people that there is a spectrum of how these roll ups will look. There's a spectrum of how they will use DA and it should align to their various use cases.
00:56:34.022 - 00:57:02.370, Speaker B: Right. And that's always the way to look at it is the infrastructure should be informed by the application and how it's being used and arguing just to do things one way because it should be the right way. It's never that black and white, but I'm interested to get the popcorn out and see what happens when a lot more roll ups start moving off of the tried and true sort of like Ethereum DA model.
00:57:02.520 - 00:58:07.080, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I agree that I think DA is going to be the big narrative. And when you look at upcoming Catalysts for crypto, I think things that are not just straight up macro catalysts would be obviously the having spot ETF. And then I think 4844 is on some folks radar because that's going to either decrease the cost or increase the margin depending on what roll ups. It's just additional bandwidth essentially that's been subsidized by Ethereum for roll ups. You get your Blob space. I sort of in the camp that is going to surprise the downside, if I had to guess. Well, I was talking to a guy who's crunched the numbers on this and it's not an enormous amount of bandwidth for these roll ups and there are many different roll ups right now and it's sort of unclear to me at least how many roll ups we really need, maybe fewer than exist today.
00:58:07.080 - 00:58:28.062, Speaker A: And clearly what roll ups have been extremely successful at is attracting transactions and activity and I think 4844 might not actually be as helpful in terms of fees as the market is predicting, which would be if that's what the market thinks and we get a surprise to downside that's slightly less good.
00:58:28.196 - 00:59:02.220, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean that's kind of what I was alluding to here is I think once that becomes clear that's when Ethereum as that DA value prop will kind of come under attack. But yeah, I don't think some infrastructure like that is going to be a market catalyst and kind of come from the applications themselves. I agree with the state of the world today in terms of oversupply versus demand, but could change very quickly.
00:59:03.310 - 00:59:22.190, Speaker A: Miles, do you think this knock on wood, not that it's started already, but in this next cycle, this is going to be the first cycle we get real consumer apps that breach the whole of the crypto natives or actually go mainstream or do you think this is another infracycle?
00:59:23.590 - 01:00:17.150, Speaker B: I would hope so. I would hope that even if it doesn't have decade long staying power that we actually break the apps themselves a little bit more into the mainstream. And we did with Openc for a bit last cycle and I think we'll see more of that. I think payments are an interesting one. We'll see. It's always hard for me to tell just how overhyped or underhyped it is and where traction stands today, but I think that there's a lot being done there on the payment side, which may not look like that killer sexy app, but that would look on chain like we are getting usage on levels that we haven't seen before. If one of those actually takes off it just wouldn't be like branded necessarily as a crypto app, it would just be using crypto in the background.
01:00:17.150 - 01:00:31.702, Speaker B: So yeah, I think we will in some way, shape or form and it's probably going to be very non obvious or like non obvious now that seems obvious when it does take off.
01:00:31.836 - 01:01:07.538, Speaker A: Yeah, I don't know, I struggle with it a little bit. I know it's very popular thing to say that the L1, the new L1 trade is dead. I don't think that it is. So maybe four or five L1s. I'm just trying to think about stuff that might be less obvious but needs to happen. I do think there's an amount of infrastructure that needs to get rebuilt on the capital market side. There's a lot that the lending desks is sort of an area that they just got carted out and I know it's never again, we're never going to do that again, we're going to do it again.
01:01:07.538 - 01:01:46.160, Speaker A: The only question to me is whether it's just going to be a CFI 2.0 and a reboot with slightly more professional operating teams, deeper access to capital, that kind of stuff, or if it actually moves on to DeFi. And I do worry a little bit. Actually, obviously I'm rooting for stuff to go on chain. But one thing I think it's very important for us to just look and be very clear eyed about is that just putting something on chain does not make it risk proof. Right? We should be very open eyed about that. You almost saw this happen with the Ave curve situation this year.
01:01:46.160 - 01:02:27.286, Speaker A: Mean there's a lot of essentially equity of know platforms that are being used to pledge collateral somewhere else and it's just good old risk management right at the end of the just this is the Sam Kazamian interview that we did. It's managing assets and liabilities. You can mess that up on chain too. So I would say maybe just as a cautionary word, let's just not assume just because it's on chain it's absolved of any risk. It's not. So there's infrastructure that I think needs to get rebuilt but more on the capital market side of infrastructure. I do think a lot of these overhyped infra rounds infra projects in ETH probably disappoint to the downside.
01:02:27.286 - 01:02:33.646, Speaker A: If I had to guess, like a lot of extremely rich valuations, I would.
01:02:33.668 - 01:03:25.706, Speaker B: Just say if you want to be bullish for Ethereum, I would say that I'm almost more bullish on Ethereum. L1, as we're related to institutional capital coming on chain and things like that. If and when there is on chain. If these market participants actually choose to use on chain alternatives versus in the absence or instead of centralized providers, they're not going to go on roll ups for the most part. They're going to start dipping their toes into Aave on Ethereum only like the most battle tested protocols. And even with curve. I was talking to somebody at a large institution today that does have tens of millions of dollars deposited on chain and they were not in the effective Curve pools.
01:03:25.706 - 01:04:23.694, Speaker B: But when that happened they had to pull everything and that's a huge pain in the ass. And then you have to have all the accounting reporting and data monitoring issues that all needs to be set up. The other thing I would say about why to be like bullish Ethereum l One is I think all of these new primitives around intent based protocols. Anything that is using ZK Coprocessors, I think all of that innovation is going to happen first on Ethereum l One because none of these guys are going to start with this very experimental, new sort of way of building applications, is not going to start on roll ups, I don't think. So. I think still the home of innovation even though it's the weirdest, really least performative, most expensive to use. But there's, I think, reasons to be bullish there.
01:04:23.812 - 01:04:52.742, Speaker A: I agree. I also would say we've shown these charts before. I actually haven't looked at it in the last month or so. But if you look at some of the DFI 1.0 darlings, the sort of synthetics of the world or the makers of the world. I mean those have just been doing extremely well. And when I say extremely well, I don't necessarily mean Token price but in terms of generating fees and real revenue.
01:04:52.742 - 01:05:13.200, Speaker A: And I think for know that's a really good point that you bring up about ETH main chain because that is the most tested and true thing. And I do tend to think security, brand stability, safety are the winning adjectives for financial applications and I think ETH has that more so than any chain at this point.
01:05:13.990 - 01:05:22.900, Speaker B: We started as a Solana bull podcast and we're ending as back to being ethereum bulls. But no, I think it's all fair, right?
01:05:23.670 - 01:05:46.150, Speaker A: They both serve a like I just think it's easy to like all of them, they just all contribute something slightly different. I feel like I had one more question for you but we could probably wrap it there. I think this was nice discussion. Tokens are back. We're back baby.
01:05:46.230 - 01:05:47.180, Speaker B: We're back.
01:05:47.550 - 01:05:52.650, Speaker A: Maybe I think that's a better way of ending it. That is a better way of ending it.
01:05:52.720 - 01:05:53.338, Speaker B: We're back.
01:05:53.424 - 01:05:55.198, Speaker A: Maybe we got a taste of what.
01:05:55.204 - 01:05:58.238, Speaker B: It felt like again this week. Oh yeah, all felt nice.
01:05:58.324 - 01:06:13.778, Speaker A: Yeah, well you and I were talking a couple of weeks ago, we were on the phone and that was when Bitcoin printed that like 15% candle or whatever in two minutes and I was a bad phone conversation, I was like miles, did you see this?
01:06:13.944 - 01:06:15.650, Speaker B: Something going on?
01:06:15.800 - 01:07:56.946, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe just in closing here because I feel like I've referenced this article before but Blockworks Research were doing a lot of very fundamentally oriented on chain research and analytics and everyone in crypto should read this article. Yeah, the Crypto price innovation cycle and it describes the causal chain reaction that happens to kickstart a bull market. And you think as a fundamental investor that the fundamental on chain metrics start to pick up and then some savvy investors who are really keyed in start to see that and they say oh well these devs are building and therefore the stuff is more valuable so I'm going to buy it. And the point that Eddie makes here that just really resonates with how I've seen this work is actually the thing that kickstarts it. The thing that happens first is price, then when the price runs, then the interest comes, then the new ideas come and then startups and projects because this was what people said about Solana for such a long period of time is that I just don't see the activity. There's no activity and I heard that so much and I was like but you clearly see the momentum shifting here and I think the rational way of describing that relationship is that on chain activity is actually a lagging indicator. Like if you are waiting to see on chain activity it is like waiting for just in economics there are forward looking indicators like new orders or PMI or things like that.
01:07:56.946 - 01:08:30.494, Speaker A: And then there are really lagging indicators like inflation or unemployment rate that's like the last thing to turn. And I really think that's the case with on chain activity too. Because first you need the price to go up, then you need people to get excited about it, then you need media writing good stuff about it, then you need people that are literally wealthier to invest in new things, attract entrepreneurs, and then finally the on chain activity starts to pick up. But I really think that it's a lagging. My framework for is that it's a lagging indicator, actually.
01:08:30.692 - 01:09:21.870, Speaker B: Interesting. Yeah, no, I think that's probably right. That said, I think a lot of the new ideas that come out at the tail end of that cycle are now well positioned today. And to actually have a lot of that on chain activity happen when prices start to go up and I would just say, like Osmosis this week did not launch a Token, right? It did not have anything other than being the venue of where Celestia launched on chain. And the amount of activity that came because of that was pretty insane. It was nothing that Cosmos has seen since the Luna days. And so I do think that the prices also benefit the incumbent on chain protocols as well.
01:09:21.870 - 01:09:28.978, Speaker B: And I don't think that really existed last cycle because they were still so nascent. But yeah, we'll see.
01:09:29.064 - 01:10:03.534, Speaker A: You know what, I forgot to say this earlier when we were talking about it being Token season. You know what these Token launches remind me of is this was sort of how I felt when Curve launched CRV. And yeah, wow, that's crazy. This was this late August of 2020. Okay, so August of 2020, Curve launched their Token. I remember thinking to myself, like, man, that's like new token launch. I guess this was right around the time of DFI Summer as well.
01:10:03.534 - 01:10:44.042, Speaker A: But it is interesting to remember that because my memory of that was bitcoin ran first and then ETH, and then it all yada yada, it all compounded. But really you did have, you know, going pretty fast and hard. There was this sort of little Idiosyncratic rally and that was kind of sort of new wealth creation, sort of PvP games, a mix of both of those things. Totally crypto native. I was isolated to sort of one corner of crypto. It was before it all really kicked off and the major started running, which is what you need to get a real bull market. But it sort of feels like that's where we're at at the current time.
01:10:44.042 - 01:11:18.390, Speaker A: You sort of started to see it with the beginnings of know that was the beginning. Okay, maybe or know people are ready to maybe start ready to start gambling again. Now we've started to see a couple like Maker went on a little run, solana just went on a big one, chainlink. Some of these more, but it's not really and Bitcoin is just starting to move. I sort of feel like that's about where we are. Not tomorrow, maybe not the next day, but sort of a checklist. Yeah, right.
01:11:18.540 - 01:11:46.030, Speaker B: I'd love that to be the case. We haven't had our own version of Yams yet or whatever the fuck those fruit tokens were from back in the day. But I think friend Tech, it rhymes with it. And yeah, there's a lot of those preconditions are starting to happen. So just stay patient 1ft in front of the other and I think it will pay off.
01:11:46.180 - 01:12:17.400, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think one thing that I will just I don't really know how I feel. I've historically not been a great predictor of this, so don't listen to me. But what I will say is if everyone was being like, yes, the ETF is the most bullish thing on earth, I would feel less excited about it. But generally when you talk to people about the ETF, they're like, yeah, I mean, people already could have bought Bitcoin at Fidelity. At this point. Most people who wanted to buy already would have bought it'll be cool. But I don't think it'll really move the price.
01:12:17.400 - 01:12:33.966, Speaker A: I just think that's just emotional scarring of two years of bad A. That's the middle of the bell curve thinking right there. I think you could just go ahead and left bell curve that and say ETF good. And yeah, we can believe good news when it's obviously good news is how.
01:12:33.988 - 01:12:35.854, Speaker B: I review some of this stuff. I think.
01:12:35.892 - 01:12:39.998, Speaker A: So not financial advice. I am usually wrong.
01:12:40.164 - 01:12:48.702, Speaker B: Never. Yeah, I'm with you. I'm with you. Fingers crossed. ETF good. Halfing good.
01:12:48.756 - 01:12:52.030, Speaker A: Knock on all the wood. Knock on all the wood. All right, budy. This was a fun one.
01:12:52.100 - 01:12:54.140, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a blast. Have a good one.
