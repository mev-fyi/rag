00:00:00.250 - 00:00:27.880, Speaker A: There's a lot of other ecosystems that are going to have their moment in the sun. And for a while last year it felt like the game that everyone was going to play was like Salana was going to catch Eth. I think now the game that people are playing at least like, you know what I'm thinking from a venture perspective is like, shit. Salana is worth $50 billion. Maybe funding some of the other Alt L ones or Alt l two s. They can catch Salana now. And so I think it's like, okay, cool.
00:00:27.880 - 00:00:39.682, Speaker A: All the cake and punch and pie has been handed out and now it's just like time to really build apps and prove that the monolithic thesis, you know, they've got like a great community of builders, so I don't think it's impossible.
00:00:39.826 - 00:00:58.074, Speaker B: Hi everyone. This episode is brought to you by swell, a team leading the restaking future with their liquid restaking token rsweep. Now I've talked about liquid restaking on this program before. I think it is going to be massive tectonic shift for ethereum and I am super, super excited about it. And I like the swell team a lot. Goes without saying, do your own research. This is not financial advice.
00:00:58.074 - 00:01:32.446, Speaker B: You guys all know the drill. Again, I like this team. And if you stick around, I'm going to describe how you can restake your eth in swell, earn pearls, Eigen layer points and a whole bunch of future rewards. So thank you very much for swell, for making this episode possible. Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator. Now if you are a listener of Bell Curve, you know that Mev is a massive problem, which is why we are so pumped to partner up with flood on this season. Flood is the only gasless and Mev free aggregator that not only gets you the best execution, but also gives you back all the extra surplus that you create every single time you swap.
00:01:32.446 - 00:01:39.722, Speaker B: Now this is relevant for both swappers and developers, but you're going to be hearing all about them later in the program. So for now, thank you flood and.
00:01:39.776 - 00:01:40.490, Speaker C: Back to the show.
00:01:40.560 - 00:02:04.290, Speaker B: Hey everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes. Including salana sui, ethereum, layer twos, and more.
00:02:04.290 - 00:02:20.434, Speaker B: And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free. You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. All right, guys, on with the show. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer.

00:02:38.484 - 00:02:40.430, Speaker A: Now let's jump into the episode.
00:02:42.370 - 00:02:48.770, Speaker C: All right, everyone, welcome back to another bell crew roundup. You got me and Vance today holding down the fort. What's up, buddy?
00:02:49.190 - 00:02:52.660, Speaker A: Chilling. Just woke up. What about you?
00:02:53.590 - 00:03:00.182, Speaker C: Yeah, you've got that fresh out of bed, quaffed look going on with the hair for folks who are not following along with that video.
00:03:00.316 - 00:03:04.920, Speaker A: Yeah, my hair is getting bigger and bigger. I'm going to have to make a decision here at some point whether to.
00:03:05.290 - 00:03:06.520, Speaker C: It's going up.
00:03:06.890 - 00:03:11.240, Speaker A: I mean, most bull runs, I have really long hair, so let's see.
00:03:11.630 - 00:03:40.498, Speaker C: Nice. That could be the new indicator. We can just check how long Vance's hair is, tell where we are in the cycle. All right, let's fire right into the ETF. So I'll pull up the latest figures here, but let me summarize where I kind of think we are, and then you tell me whether or not you agree. I think, obviously, with the benefit of hindsight, in the short run, it turned out that the ETF was a little bit of a sell. The news event the day of the listing, bitcoin ran up to something like that and sold off back to 39.
00:03:40.498 - 00:04:28.350, Speaker C: And I think there was a lot of emphasis there first, just on a lot of the way the market was positioned, leading in either from CME futures or whatever. People were positioned very bullishly, but also people got very myopically focused, I would say, on the GBTC outflows. And for the first five or six days, GBTC was seeing pretty steady outflows of between 450 to sort of 600 million, call it. But now where we are today is that those outflows are starting to slow down. So I think the last day's outflows on record was like 221,000,000. And we're back to the rest of the ETF complex. Saw a net inflows of 247,000,000 and you're actually starting to see ibit, I think, catch up to GBTC in terms of trading volume.
00:04:28.350 - 00:04:34.740, Speaker C: So, Vance, what do you sort of think about the state of the etfs at the current moment?
00:04:35.450 - 00:05:19.620, Speaker A: So just doing a little math. So let's say that we had yesterday 247,000,000 of net inflows, including GBTC. And you can make the argument that the GBTC outflows are going to kind of taper off, but let's just stick with 247,000,000 of net inflows. I think there's an argument that maybe it's lower than that on a go forward normalized basis. But I also think as the price goes up, these things become self marketing. And a lot of the marketing and sales have not even really started yet at these big distributors, Blackrock, Arc, Bitwise, all those guys. So 247,000,000 annualized, that that's 59 billion net flows over the rest of 2024.
00:05:19.620 - 00:06:01.230, Speaker A: That's like hugely bullish. I mean, just to give you an example of what that is in BTC terms, that's like every three days. Yeah, this is great. Every three days or so, they're putting about ten k BTC into these etfs. And if you look at how much bitcoin kind of trades, and it is not either lost or just being hoddled by the true believers, there's about 1.8 million bitcoin that are available for sale, roughly. You're looking at within the next one to three, like, all of that bitcoin kind of being bought.
00:06:01.230 - 00:06:57.380, Speaker A: So, like, this is hugely bullish in my mind. And one of the guys that I've been watching is Fred Krueger. I don't know if you've seen this guy, but this dude is like this old tradfi guy who's now kind of like found religion on bitcoin. Most nights he'll put on an expensive italian jacket, rip a cigar, and he has his dog there, and he just basically waxes poetic about how bitcoin is going to a million. The tradfi moon boys are here, and it seems like they really like crypto. And so I think you've had all of the calling cards of, like, Jim Kramer said bitcoin is going to had other people saying it's going to like, twenty five k, and Jim Bianco saying it's potentially dead forever. I just don't think there's anything further from the truth than that.
00:06:58.150 - 00:07:42.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I completely agree with you. I also would just even add to that analysis of flows. Keep in mind that we've got the having coming in April, which I'm pretty sure I saw Matt Hogan tweet out. That's roughly equivalent to $7 billion worth of supply getting wiped out. So I feel like the supply and demand dynamics for bitcoin have basically never looked better. And you've already started to see the outflows from GBTC getting neutralized. Where do you think, Vance, just if you had to put a number on it, where do you think these outflows ultimately get to in terms of GBTC? I think they started with somewhere around 25 billion in AuM, which is a pretty unprecedented head start for an ETF, especially with nine other ones launching.
00:07:42.670 - 00:07:51.220, Speaker C: We're looking at the flows here. So total over 14 days. They've had 5.6 flow out so far. Where do you think that ultimately winds up?
00:07:53.030 - 00:08:44.158, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think my personal theory at least is there's different types of GBTC outflows. Like the initial first few days where the outflows were very like, those are just like net sales. That's the FTX estate getting to cash to distribute. That's grayscale selling GBTC to kind of reclateralize their balance sheet and pay off whoever they need to pay off, like in terms of Gemini or any of the stuff that was going on there. I think the outflows of GBTC right now are more kind of like neutral to price, just because a lot of them, in my understanding, are arbs. Like CME is still trading at a premium. And so there is an arb there where you're buying the futures and you're selling the spot, and that's kind of like unwinding.
00:08:44.158 - 00:09:24.740, Speaker A: That is more neutral to the price than just straight up sales. And so I think you're going to see that pace tapering off. It's like kind of like 180,000,000 to 200 million about flows per day. And I think you'll see that taper off pretty dramatically. But I expect Blackrock to be the biggest ETF for bitcoin in the world. And so if you think there's going to be 50 billion of net flows into these things in the next twelve to 18 months, I think it's a pretty reasonable assumption that GBTC is probably like a distant number two, maybe has like 20 or 30% the Aum of something like ibit, which is the Blackrock bitcoin trust.
00:09:25.430 - 00:10:33.254, Speaker C: Yeah, my thought was just looking at it, obviously completely unscientific, but I was sort of budgeting in about 30% of their Aum would just exit from GBTC. So I was always kind of looking for like seven and a half billion or something like that to flow out. We'll see if that ends up being accurate or not. One question that I had for you, I was trying to think this through myself, and maybe this can lead into the discussion of the ETh ETF as well. But I sort of do wonder the etfs, what they should have is a vault dampening effect for a couple of different reasons. Because, one, if we make the assumption that now the dominant way that bitcoin and eventually ETH are going to attract flows is through these etfs, then that changes the dynamic of kind of this very pro cyclical, retail driven, these very pro cyclical, retail driven flows to one which is much more institutional and much more passive. And the vehicle for buying it is just much more efficient than it's been in the past.
00:10:33.254 - 00:11:05.700, Speaker C: And I'm kind of just wondering what the longer term implications of that are, because even like, all coins are heavily correlated to the price of bitcoin and eth, and if bitcoin's buyers and the source of their flows has changed this structurally and it ends up being less volatile, then I wonder if this is kind of not the beginning of the end, but this ultimately has a pretty significant impact on the cyclicality of crypto in general. What are your thoughts on that?
00:11:09.830 - 00:12:02.302, Speaker A: Look, I just don't think there's enough supply of coins. I don't think there's enough coins for it to become muted from a volatility perspective. And if you think, I have a lot of friends who work at some of the bigger hedge funds in New York and the world, and a lot of their strategies are, I mean, it's not just this, but one strategy. Know, they love things where the float is relatively kind of cornered and the other one is momentum based. So if something's working, they allocate more and more capital to that, it seems silly, but think of all of the meme stocks and the funds kind of getting in on that. I think crypto is obviously not a meme, but it has some of the same properties of, like, it's a highly retail oriented market. There is not a lot of float, and these things are highly susceptible to momentum.
00:12:02.302 - 00:12:54.450, Speaker A: And as I think about the bull run and where the market's at and all that stuff, the euphoria and the float being really dramatically reduced doesn't really kick in until new all time highs. These things are, again like self marketing. And so I think you're going to see a lot of trad five participation in the upside, that it's going to drive a lot of volatility. I also think when the cycle is over, and who knows, I think there's a lot of time between now and then, and we're going to drive interest rates to zero and then at some point maybe we'll drive them back up and maybe that's in like four or five years and the cycle is over. You're going to see trad five shorting this on the way down. And so I think there's going to be more volatility, not less interesting. But if there's 250,000,000 of buying pressure every day, I think the main price action is just going to be drifting upwards.
00:12:56.070 - 00:13:19.594, Speaker C: That's what I was sort of wondering. I think there are strong. I agree with everything you said, and I also do think this is a prediction that keeps getting proven wrong. Every cycle someone comes out and says, we have a much more. That's what people said in 2021. They were like, we have derivatives, now there's much more institutional money. These crazy cycles that we've been through in the past are not going to manifest again.
00:13:19.594 - 00:13:21.820, Speaker C: And obviously that was just dead wrong.
00:13:22.210 - 00:13:45.060, Speaker A: Yeah. Ever since I got into crypto, I've been hearing that the markets are going to get less volatile and there's also price that bitcoin will get to where it'll just be stable. I don't think crypto works like that, where it's like we drive bitcoin to a million and then it just stays there forever. Maybe so. I just don't really believe that.
00:13:45.610 - 00:13:50.534, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm with you, too. I think where my head was at.
00:13:50.572 - 00:13:51.160, Speaker A: Was.
00:13:53.130 - 00:14:23.198, Speaker C: It'S kind of like in past cycles, the next incremental dollar that was coming in was from some retail person, which makes crypto much more susceptible to momentum style trading. Whereas now the next incremental dollar, at least for the majors, is looking like it's going to be passive. And you know, there are, when you, when you have macro and much more traditional investors in the driver's seat, then they're less likely to buy breakout trends. They'll like short, they're kind of like mean reverters and no, that's the opposite.
00:14:23.214 - 00:15:03.790, Speaker A: Of what they do, really. Most of the big pod shops are momentum. Interesting to the extent that when PMS, I can't name names or sectors, but say you're long something and it goes up two x as a PM, you're like, time to cut. My bonus is in jeopardy. It's looking good for this year. And in the reality they're like, because the pods allocate you capital, like a millennium or a ballyazzen or a citadel, they're like, no, you're putting more on and you're not going to cut. Look at gold.
00:15:03.790 - 00:15:16.720, Speaker A: It was a retail oriented market, was waiting for a spot ETF forever. The ETF hits and the price skyrockets. Yeah, we have pretty good analogies here as to what's going to happen.
00:15:17.570 - 00:15:46.282, Speaker C: Also, for listeners who might not be familiar with this pod model that you're talking about is kind of like, this has become popular in recent years for hedge funds, but basically, like, find some young portfolio manager. The value proposition is instead of going to open up your own shop where you have to set up all of this infrastructure, it's like we are going to basically provide you this infrastructure that you can just plug into. We're going to have more granularity about how much money gets allocated to you and stuff like that. But when you describe the pod model, that's basically what we're talking about.
00:15:46.416 - 00:16:21.414, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And the things that are in your control are what stocks you're selecting, but what's not in your control is like, they will allocate you more capital and you have to put it to work in the existing portfolio that you have. So it'll be really interesting. The sell the news crowd, I just think is very wrong. And all things considered, was it a sell the news event? Yeah, I guess. But we're 10% off where we were. GBTC has been completely cleared out.
00:16:21.414 - 00:16:32.300, Speaker A: Celsius has been completely cleared out. The FTX estate has been completely cleared out. I don't know, what are we doing here?
00:16:33.230 - 00:17:09.000, Speaker C: I'm with you. All right, let's talk a little bit about the ETH ETF. So we had Standard Chartered actually came out and talked a little bit about this in a pretty bullish way. Standard Chartered is one of the larger, sorry, investment banks that's based out of Europe and they came out this week and said that they think it's pretty likely that we're going to get an ETH ETF by on May 23. So, yeah, I would love fans if you could just kind of sum up for listeners who might not be as familiar with some of the maybe specific challenges to an ETH ETF, like how likely it is. And what do you think about Standard chartered coming out and talking about this?
00:17:09.690 - 00:18:34.626, Speaker A: Yeah, so I think the people who know this best are a Eric Belchunis and James Seifert, who've been like the ETF Sherpas for the whole industry, for the entire bitcoin ETF, and they have it at about 60 40 for May. And May is the date where kind of most of these filings are due to be ruled on by the SEC. And if they do not rule on them, assume that they will be sued and taken to court in the same way that, yeah, grayscale was or actually sued the SEC. And so whether it's may or may plus like two or three months, it seems like at least I'm pretty high confidence that the ETF is going to come probably this year, maybe in the second half, but I would say I'm more confident in the first. Like, I think the standard Chartered analysis is like Scott Johnson, who's another guy on crypto Twitter who's like, ETF pilled and super into it. He said that analysis is pretty service level, and there's other things that potentially could mean that they need to go to court versus an outright approval. But this ETF is coming, and if you think $250,000,000 a day for bitcoin is a lot, it kind of boggles the mind what could happen if an ETH ETF gets approved, especially in the heat of a bull run.
00:18:34.626 - 00:19:28.180, Speaker A: I think beyond that, you need a futures ETF product in order to have a spot ETF product, and that's probably going to be another, it would require an administration change, in our view, to have other etfs. And I think that's going to be a big demarcation between bitcoin and ETF and the rest of the field. If you don't have an ETF, sure, a rising tide lifts all boats, but the liquidity you're going to get on these things is pretty incredible, and it's going to invite tradfi in. And so I'm pretty high conviction that we have one this year. But the other side of the coin is like, Morgan doesn't think we're going to get one. And that is basically, I thought, like, even more surface level analysis of just like, Gensler doesn't like ETH. I don't think that ultimately holds much water in the face of what we've seen the courts do to the SEC.
00:19:29.430 - 00:19:38.718, Speaker C: Vance, what do you think about the possibility of, like, is this ETH ETF? If we get it, is it going to be yield bearing, or, like, is it going to include stake yield?
00:19:38.814 - 00:20:03.260, Speaker A: No, and I think that's actually, if you think about it, all of the people who are not staking are subsidized those who are, in terms of the additional yield that they get. And so that's kind of marginally bullish, like Lido and the crypto native staking providers, because I think it's going to be a while until the sec gets comfortable with, like, we're locking the assets in this trust in a smart contract. That could be.
00:20:05.150 - 00:20:45.180, Speaker C: Think it. I had never really thought about it until just this moment, but an ETH ETF, which can only hold spot ETH, is sort of a nice counterbalance to what's going on in the ecosystem right now, which is this idea that, hey, I could either hold ETH or I could hold yield bearing ETH in the form of steeth. And I think there's been a little bit of concern about that, like, pretty understandable concern. And if there was an ETF, which was basically a massive buying source just for the spot ETF, that could actually odly solve some issues in the current moment. So that would be kind of interesting. Yeah.
00:20:48.590 - 00:21:13.330, Speaker A: I think it solves a lot of problems for ETH. Well, not a lot of problems. It just helps subsidize the yield, and it gives just a different Persona of ETH, which is really kind of what you want. You don't want it all staked, ideally, or if you do, weird things could happen to the price. If we get to like 70 or 80% staking rate, like Cosmos and ETH, there's just not going to be a lot of coins.
00:21:15.050 - 00:21:46.480, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think also from the perspective of ETH, the protocol, it's like you want to preserve the moneyness of ETH, the asset itself. And steeth is actually essentially like a receipt from the staking pool operator, which is Lido. And you're taking on certain assurances. It's a little bit centralizing to the protocol, potentially. And you're taking on the trust assurances of Lido as opposed to ETH directly. I'm in the camp that most ETH is going to end up getting wrapped eventually anyway.
00:21:46.480 - 00:22:07.570, Speaker C: And I'm a huge fan of lido. I get why some people in the Ethereum community are concerned. I'd also put myself hardcore in the pro Lido camp. Like, I really like Lido. So I don't know, I just think a little bit of incremental demand for pure spot eth would almost be, like, a nice boon to the state of the ecosystem right now. So just an interesting dynamic and thought of before.
00:22:07.640 - 00:22:34.886, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. This episode is brought to you by swell, a liquid restaking protocol in the issuer of the r suite liquid restaking token. Now, if you're a listener of Bell curve, you know that I am just so fascinated by restaking and liquid restaking. I think it is going to be one of the most important trends in Ethereum. And I am really excited for the benefit that it unlocks both users and also Ethereum, the protocol itself. Now disclaimer, whenever there's yield involved in a product, do your own research. This is not financial advice.
00:22:34.886 - 00:23:00.614, Speaker B: You guys know the drill. But swell is a great team. They have a non custodial product and they are mission driven on giving you the best liquid staking experience. If you take one benefit away from using liquid restaking, make it be capital efficiency. Now, you can earn passive yield from Ethereum, you can earn yield from multiple actively validated services that stack on top of that. And then you can still use Rsweep as collateral in defi. And because I know y'all are a bunch of degens, there's a points angle here as well.
00:23:00.614 - 00:23:18.694, Speaker B: But in swell we call them pearls. So pearls equal points. And if you stake your eth with swell, you can earn pearls and future Eigen layer rewards. When there is a token generation event, you can swap your pearls or swell tokens head over, click the link at the bottom of this episode. Again, just pause what you're doing right now. Go click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:23:18.742 - 00:23:54.646, Speaker C: Check out swell. Thank you. Later, fans, I want to get your thoughts on some of the new innovations that's happening in kind of consumer use cases for crypto. So there's been a lot of talk on polymarket, and I want to get your thought on predictions markets in a second here. But one thing that I have actually been pretty interested in this week is forecaster frames. I'm not sure if you saw that, but yeah, could you for listeners, just give an overview of what are forecaster frames in general and why are people kind of excited about them?
00:23:54.828 - 00:24:01.258, Speaker A: Can you do it? I'm probably not the best person. I've devoted my time on playing around on polymarket the past couple of weeks.
00:24:01.344 - 00:25:10.350, Speaker C: Yeah, let me start with the problem statement for blockworks for media companies. This has been the first time that I've looked at something like kind of someone messing around with crypto stuff and been like, I can not only squint at this, but look at this and see that this solves a problem that blockworks has as an organization. So one of the problems with more traditional media companies right now is that they lost access to distribution. So like web, two social platforms they have the audience right now, and they have leverage over media companies, publishers that actually produce content, and they're squeezing margin out of them, and they're just making it like a less hospitable place to acquire users and traffic. Like blockworks acquires traffic through Twitter and Google. And you can see Elon Musk is like, not making, he's being very direct about it. He's like, I don't want, basically, he's making Twitter less and less of a hospitable place for blockworks, which actually is a massive problem for us because our whole audience is on Twitter.
00:25:11.090 - 00:25:13.150, Speaker A: How, I'm curious.
00:25:13.650 - 00:25:54.826, Speaker C: That was what was behind. Remember when he changed, when you used to be able to show, like, when you linked a news thing, it said New York Times title of the article, and he ripped all that off. And it's literally just to make it less likely that people are going to click. And because the business model of Twitter is like, he doesn't want you going to the New York Times, Elon Musk wants you staying on Twitter. Right? Like, that's his objective there. And so there's this incentive mismatch. And what or frames allows you to do is on their platform, they're basically saying they're making it super easy for you, either as a media publisher or an NFT platform or whatever, to just embed this action on Farcaster.
00:25:54.826 - 00:26:36.630, Speaker C: But unlike Twitter, which is like trying to get you to not go somewhere else, you can just immediately mint an NFT directly from Farcaster. You can subscribe to a newsletter directly from Farcaster. And right there, that makes that a super attractive value proposition from the perspective of blockworks. Because right now, to acquire like a user on X-A-X is making it less attractive from just displaying an article. When you click through, it doesn't take you to the actual site, takes you to this bullshit amp thing, which is a really shitty user experience for the reader. They're actively trying to do that because they're trying to keep you on the platform. And Farcaster has kind of gone the other way and said, we want to be super modular.
00:26:36.630 - 00:27:00.754, Speaker C: And if you were like a publisher on our site, and they have a very broad definition of what a publisher could be, it could be content, you could be writing your own newsletter, you could be publishing an NFT. We want to make it super easy for you to do that. And that, to me, I was just like, wow, that is such a powerful idea. And it's so powerful. I literally looking at this being like, blockworks should be leaning into Farcaster right now. So props to Dan Romero and the team over there. I think it's super cool.
00:27:00.754 - 00:27:06.680, Speaker C: I haven't had the chance to play around with it yet as much as I will, but I thought it was really innovative. Very cool idea.
00:27:07.130 - 00:27:43.402, Speaker A: I mean, it also feels formative to the ETh narrative as well, where it's like we've got our own community now and it's easier to coordinate. It's less noisy, all of that stuff. But, yeah, I've played less around, less with Farcaster. And all the points you made make sense. I do think if you take a step back and you think about all of the crypto narratives that are happening right now, it's pretty wild. You've got bitcoin and ETH etfs soon or already in place. You've got social starting to take off.
00:27:43.402 - 00:28:12.890, Speaker A: And not just crypto, people are on Farcaster. It's like 15,000 dau, but it's growing pretty rapidly. You've got games launching immutable, launch their ZKVM. You've got DFI scaling. I can kind of see the headlines now in a year's time when we break all time highs and there's this diaspora of different narratives and use cases and things that have been built over the bear market. It's really impressive and it's really positive for crypto.
00:28:13.470 - 00:28:51.010, Speaker C: It's so cool. Right now. There's obviously shout out to Dan Romero and the team at Farcaster. I'm definitely going to check it out more. And social fi is one of those interesting things where I want you to talk about polymarket, but feel like crypto should be highly disruptive to social media in a sense, because the reason it's difficult to compete with social media is they have network effects. But that's what crypto is really good at, solving cold start problems with tokens and breaking network effects. So always kind of looked at social fi as like, okay, it feels like, very primitive.
00:28:51.010 - 00:29:06.826, Speaker C: You're literally competing with some of the largest, most well run companies in the world that have extremely entrenched network effects. But I feel like crypto could be a really novel solution for how to compete. And I'm just rooting for Farcaster. I think frames are really cool, so, yeah, people should check them out.
00:29:07.008 - 00:29:09.740, Speaker A: Me too. I'm rooting for everyone.
00:29:10.510 - 00:29:17.242, Speaker C: Yeah, me too, man. Me too. Talk to us a little bit about polymarket. I've seen that's been getting quite a bit of traction recently.
00:29:17.306 - 00:30:08.000, Speaker A: I've just gotten interested in prediction markets and political betting, and it's never really been liquid enough to really do anything interesting. All right, so these are the political betting ods for this year. This is just to give you an idea of what these markets look like for predict it, which is historically one of the most cited. You listen to the news and they cite predicted ods. What's interesting about predicted is that you can only bet $850 per person per market. And so you get this really weird skewed thing that doesn't really make a lot of sense, that people cite as like a source of truth, and that doesn't make much sense. And then you look at the other ones of these bet us Bavada, B, win sporting bet.
00:30:08.000 - 00:30:53.450, Speaker A: You know, basically, if you call them up and you try to bet on any market, they will screen you based on what you do. For, a, you, if you work at a fund or you're not just purely retail, they're going to skew the ods and they'll only give you tiny size. And so it's like for something that everyone cites and everyone believes in, these markets are a, not functional and b, just not representative of really any sort of real betting interest. And you still see political candidates tweet out these odds and tweet out how they're doing on the betting markets. It's extremely weird. That's one screen. Now I'm going to pull up polymarket.
00:30:53.450 - 00:31:32.026, Speaker A: Polymarket. There's $34.4 million bet. And if you look at, you buy yes or no on Trump ods or Biden ods or even Michelle Obama odds. Look at the midpoint here on a spread of liquidity on the buy side and 800 million on the sell side, like right at the midpoint of the market. It's extremely impressive. And there's no incentives with this.
00:31:32.026 - 00:32:10.386, Speaker A: It's grown three x from about 10 million to 33 million, whatever it is today. In the past three weeks, this market has only been live since the 1 January. And you have Donald Trump tweeting out his ODs how he thinks he's doing, and the polymarket oDs and all this stuff. And it's pretty interesting. And I think the problem with prediction markets is like every four years, yes, we want to bet on presidential markets. That's okay. But what are the other things that you could do that could make this more interesting in the future? The things that I think of are know they have markets on the Middle east.
00:32:10.386 - 00:32:59.074, Speaker A: Will Hamas remain in power? Will the know hit another us ship with like, you could build kind of like an interesting. This is just spitballing. But like news betting site out of like that's pretty interesting to me. And most people when they think of what do you buy or sell? If the Houthis ramp up their aggressive campaign in the Middle east, they're going to buy oil or buy some derivative of that event happening. There is an argument to be made that if you can bet on the event directly, it's just more interesting and more accurate. The other things are like political outcomes in the Senate, the know all these different bills that are going to be passed. I'm hoping that this is the cycle that we can break out a just beyond presidential markets, even though those are kind of like far larger than they ever have been.
00:32:59.074 - 00:33:23.660, Speaker A: I do think the presidential market on polymarket will go to a billion in liquidity at some point this year. It's 30 million, it's the first of Feb. And the elections in November. But my hope is that can be the starting point for this branching outwards. And I think there's other problems with prediction markets, like how loyal is liquidity, how proprietary is the site to people. But polymarket has just been slowly grinding and it's just cool to see them really do well.
00:33:24.350 - 00:33:59.560, Speaker C: Yeah, I would agree with you. I think one of the other cool ways that I've seen it used and I think it would be useful even for blockworks. I found myself thinking about this when you were describing it is almost like if you could embed polymarket ods on an article or something like that, where if you were covering the presidency, it's like, hey, look, and this is what betting, it's just another data point and visualization that you can use. And yeah, I think it's super cool. I think just to point out some of the issues that people have raised around prediction markets in the past is like assassination markets. I think this actually ended up popping up on. What was that like the first prediction markets that rolled out.
00:34:00.110 - 00:34:03.050, Speaker A: I know what you're saying, but come on.
00:34:03.120 - 00:34:44.182, Speaker C: Yeah, I know. Well, you know what the other thing that you could think about prediction markets doing is if they became deep and liquid enough is it actually lowers the friction for doing things like hedging. Like you could say, I bet that it's going to rain. Like if you're a farmer in Argentina or something like that, you could have a prediction mark. I think it's going to rain however many times this year. And that's a way to hedge essentially your crops, whereas right now that's not an issue. If you like a large agricultural conglomerate or sort of industrial farmer in the US, you can go to a bank, and there are special banks that do that, but you don't have that option if you're in another part of the world or something like that.
00:34:44.182 - 00:34:55.260, Speaker C: So you can actually look at prediction markets and see that they'd be really useful for hedging or lowering the frictions, for creating super useful products like futures and stuff like that.
00:35:00.290 - 00:35:43.082, Speaker A: This is just spitballing. But if you merge community notes with a prediction, uh, how much do you want to bet that this is right? Or like, that's probably a better economic incentive than just like, let's see what the peanut gallery thinks of this claim. There's obviously problems of resolving these markets. And polymarket is built on the UmA oracle. And that's like one kind of thing in the polymarket community that divides people. Some people think it's bad, some people think it's good, but there's no incentives going on in this market, and there's a ton of volume and there's a ton of liquidity. And I think it is a good omen for what's going to happen with these markets in the future.
00:35:43.082 - 00:35:47.020, Speaker A: But add it to the list of expanding crypto narratives that are working.
00:35:48.030 - 00:35:56.400, Speaker C: Yeah, I completely agree with that. And I'm very curious to see what is ply market pricing in. In terms of Trump.
00:35:57.890 - 00:36:23.734, Speaker A: He's like, fifty two cents right now, slightly better than 50% ods. But another market is the ETH ETF market, and it's at slightly less than 50% ods that it gets approved, I think, in late May. But if you're bullish ETH and you think that ETF is going to get approved, you double your money. If it does, it's arguably more efficient than betting on the underlying, which is cool.
00:36:23.932 - 00:37:01.442, Speaker C: Yeah. That point that you made, too, about sometimes maybe it's just better that you could bet on the thing itself as opposed to a derivative of that. It's kind of like in what I would imagine to be really reductive about what it's like to be a hedge fund manager. It's like, okay, do I think this thing is going to happen? If this thing happens, then how do I express that trade? And those are, you can actually sometimes get the thing right, but express the trade incorrectly and get screwed. So maybe this just obviates part of that, makes it a little easier to bet on the thing that you're actually trying to bet on, which is an interesting concept. So just want to underscore that that's a great point.
00:37:01.496 - 00:37:52.242, Speaker A: Like, the two parts of trading are what is your idea and how are you structuring it? A good example of this is I've been doing some personal research into uranium and I think it's interesting and there's a whole thesis behind nuclear and whatever. Right now there's this bill in the house that would ban russian uranium. And a lot of the uranium community is like, this is going to be turbo bullish uranium and it's going to go up a lot and blah, blah, blah. If you have a view on the bill, I'm more negative on the bill passing just because I think our government is a shit show and nothing's going to happen this year at all. I'd probably rather bet on the bill than hold a bunch of spot physical uranium trusts. It's just like a different way. It removes the last part of.
00:37:52.242 - 00:37:56.180, Speaker A: How do I structure this to your point, which is cool, which is half of the game.
00:37:56.630 - 00:38:02.470, Speaker C: Yeah. Do you think that eventually people will be able to take out leverage on prediction markets bets?
00:38:03.770 - 00:38:07.640, Speaker A: I think it'll happen. We have a way of making these things happen.
00:38:08.490 - 00:38:10.070, Speaker C: Where there's a will, there's a way.
00:38:10.220 - 00:38:10.982, Speaker A: I know.
00:38:11.116 - 00:38:11.800, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:12.350 - 00:38:13.340, Speaker A: For better.
00:38:14.270 - 00:38:43.598, Speaker C: All right. But I think in general, and actually maybe to tease a little bit about some of the stuff that permissionless is going to focus on this year, I just think consumer use cases are something that this industry needs to see. And I do think if you take a second to look around, there are things that are working and are cool. So, yeah, I think it's always just worth highlighting. All right, next topic here is nfts. So nfts and asset class are seeing a little bit of a surge in interest. So we got here via Coindex.
00:38:43.598 - 00:39:16.446, Speaker C: Jesus. Coindesk indexes that track the price of nfts have risen almost 10% this month and they're actually outpacing ETH. So I guess we've talked a little bit about nfts. Nfts were a big prediction of mine for this year. So I feel like disclaimer, I've been pretty bullish on them. But what are your sort of thoughts on how do you view nfts as an investment in general? Do you think that is there real innovation going on in the model? Like, are PFP 10,000 collection pfps kind of dead moving forward? And.
00:39:16.468 - 00:39:16.606, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:16.628 - 00:39:21.290, Speaker C: How would you kind of slot them as an opportunity for investors out there listening?
00:39:21.450 - 00:40:23.490, Speaker A: All right, so this is the all time price chart, and this goes back to August 2021. And the thing you have to remember about nfts is that their bull run was incredibly gnarly in terms of how much price appreciation happened, but also incredibly short. So the floor for crypto punks in August 6, 2021 was 32, and then it quadrupled by October 2021 to almost 115. And then we had this huge drawdown. I'm drawing line in the chart, and we bottomed at 40 in July 6, 2023. That was, like, when the ETH identity crisis was in full swing, as, like, Salana was ramping, and now we're 50 plus percent higher than that, 61. And so crypto punks are unique in the sense that they're like, at least for me, a levered beta on ETH, and they kind of represent the coolness or confidence of the ecosystem.
00:40:23.490 - 00:41:19.666, Speaker A: I think everything else other than that has done pretty poorly, other than, like, pudgy penguins, mad lads on Salana, and maybe a few other kind of blue chip collections. But I don't see that there's new demand for ten K PFP collections. And back in the day, these were really hard to make. But now that we have generative AI, it's like, you can crank out ten K pfps pretty easily. And so I think the market is solidifying in terms of there's probably ten NFT blue chip assets that are going to be levered beta on the ecosystem that they're in, or if they're creating their own ecosystem, just kind of their own thing. But my sense is that gaming nfts are kind of, like, right around the corner, and, like, pixels, who's a portfolio company of ours, has 200k DLA active wallets. Maybe like, a third of those are bots, and it's on Ronan, but they're generating, selling, distributing nfts, and they're pretty low cost nfts.
00:41:19.666 - 00:41:30.730, Speaker A: They're like five to $10, but it feels like that's more of where the market is heading versus these super expensive nfts that people kind of associate with different ecosystems.
00:41:31.470 - 00:42:25.946, Speaker C: Yeah, me too. I think also there's a lot of room to play around with the business model of nfts, and I think you're starting to see, like, talk about a lot on the show, but what Luca is doing with pudgy penguins and basically slotting nfts as sort of a value sink or a value accrual part of a very traditional sort of IP business, I feel like is really interesting. And that makes a lot more sense to me than the decentralized Disney thing that you used to hear last cycle. You also see, like, mad lads with what Armani and Tristan are doing. Over with backpack as kind of using an NFT collection as a revenue generation mechanism and community building thing as almost like top of funnel for a product. Tensorians have done that as well. With tensorians the collection and tensor the exchange, I feel like they've successfully experimented with that, and I do think there's even room to experiment, frankly, with.
00:42:25.946 - 00:43:00.086, Speaker C: Just like gaming. NfTs, I think are also super interesting. And I also think there's room to experiment just with. Like, does it need to be 10,000? Can we do more or less or cheaper? Even the drip experiment that's going on on Salana is super interesting. So I feel like there's a ton of room for innovation, and there's always going to be a market out there for people that want cool art. Ultimately, I just see this as kind of like a mix of like a mix of trading and art and yeah, it's kind of a left curve thesis, but I just think they're cool and I think people are going to keep buying them is my take on them.
00:43:00.188 - 00:43:16.620, Speaker A: No, look, I'm glad that we've gotten the NFT community off the mat. They're pretty destitute for a while, but they bring a lot of energy, know creativity and good vibes to the space. So I'm happy to see all these NFts do well.
00:43:17.150 - 00:43:47.394, Speaker C: I agree. I also do think there is a cultural affiliation with nfTs. Like, just imagine for a second punks moving off eth. Like how crazy that would be. And I think there were some NFT collections, like, no judgment, but there were some NFT collections that moved ecosystems potentially for the wrong reasons. And I think those are going to struggle to gain traction again, because again, NFTs are really just an exercise in building community. And if you switch community, it's kind of like a sports team moving cities or something like that.
00:43:47.394 - 00:43:51.842, Speaker C: It takes away from the. I don't know, I think it's.
00:43:51.906 - 00:43:52.822, Speaker A: I'm with you.
00:43:52.956 - 00:43:53.794, Speaker C: They're going to struggle.
00:43:53.842 - 00:44:24.702, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Salana, Sui, Ethereum, layer twos, and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free.
00:44:24.702 - 00:44:28.322, Speaker B: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link.
00:44:28.376 - 00:45:03.854, Speaker C: All right, guys, on with the show. One thing that I wanted to actually call out here as well, or another story for you is we had the launch of St. Tia today. So that comes from stride protocol. And I just want to call that out because I think liquid staking, as you know, I know you guys are investors in jeto. I also am, but also just like a fan of the protocol, but I'm fascinated by, frankly, Lido Jito. And when I look out at the world of new ecosystems where a liquid staking token makes a lot of sense, I think Celestia is kind of the obvious play there.
00:45:03.854 - 00:45:48.858, Speaker C: There's kind of this idea of modular money, and I think Celestia, you can look at it and think it probably has a pretty similar design to Ethereum where you've got a base layer which is minimally performant. Actually, celestia is much more bare bones even than Ethereum. It can't support smart contracts. But what it's trying to do is attract a whole bunch of roll ups to build on it and to use Tia, the token for gas or as a form of money. So you can kind of think about Celestia is trying to export its dollars or its token up to the roll ups that are going to use it. And just because of the construction of celestia today, it's like super minimal. They don't even have interchange accounts or anything like that.
00:45:48.858 - 00:46:17.970, Speaker C: It's kind of tough to actually, what is the bridge that you're going to do that? And you can't export Celestia itself. It has to be a wrap version of it. So STT is probably the best way of actually doing that. So stride is rolling this out. Everyone teased this, did a long interview with Aidan of Stride and John Charboneau. Actually, this is going to be airing on Monday, which was a really fun episode. But yeah, I'm very interested to see the penetration of liquid staking in the celestia market.
00:46:17.970 - 00:46:31.690, Speaker C: I think it could be a pretty large market and yeah, pretty pumped for stride overall. But what do you think, Vance, in general, about Celestia as kind of an attractive market for liquid staking? And what do you think about this idea of modular.
00:46:36.590 - 00:47:07.860, Speaker A: Mean, modular money? Just seems like a meme to me, honestly. I say this is like we did the seed of Celestia as well. So we do have some bags there. Look, I think it's like any asset can be staked, and if the inflation rate is high enough, you're going to have people be interested in it. I think the staking rate for Celestia is 25% at the moment. So it's like, if you're not staking, you're getting diluted. So there's like, a heavy incentive to do so.
00:47:07.860 - 00:47:50.030, Speaker A: I think at the end of the day, you kind of do need to build real fees for liquid staking to really take off in a way that is meaningful, or else everyone's just going to get diluted to zero. And I think if you think about how Ethereum is constructed, the fees are high on l one that bootstraps the, whatever, 35 million of, or maybe it's less than that 30 million of each stake today. Everyone gets those fees. The supply decreases, everyone uses it as money. Everyone denominates in it, on the lending markets, on maker, on ave. That, to me, is more of a path to basically becoming money than just, like, liquid staking. And here's some inflation.
00:47:50.030 - 00:48:28.798, Speaker A: You need to get people to actually denominated it. You can't get people. I think Celestia has a path to get there, but more of it is revolving around. Is it paired with main assets in liquidity pools when meme coins launch? Is it used as a lending market piece of collateral? When you're borrowing money, are you confident enough in the price to borrow half the value against it? And so I think these are good first steps for celeste to be taking. I think inflation is vicious. It can really eat away at your principal, and it can cause all these weird externalities in the secondary market. Having liquid staking is amazing.
00:48:28.798 - 00:48:45.140, Speaker A: I think the path to money for any asset, sol avalanche, whatever you want to call it, is like, you need to get people to denominate in it. It's not just about like, I had Tia, now I have, like, sta. That's like maybe the first inning of getting there.
00:48:45.670 - 00:49:25.338, Speaker C: Well, here's something to think about. I'd love to get your opinion on this. If you really think about it, bridges are kind of a myth in the sense that the native asset is never leaving the core protocol, but you're exporting different wrap versions of it through various vehicles, like, some of which have much better security assurances versus another. The ethereum that you have on arbitrum or optimism is locked in a contract on main chain. And then there is like the kind of synthetic version that lives on optimism or arbitrum. But there's an extremely credible bridge. There's like a canonical bridge which exports the ETH.
00:49:25.338 - 00:50:31.174, Speaker C: So you're very safe. But it's still like, you have to think about it in terms of physical. The ETh itself is still on main chain. And so any asset that wants to be a money, you need to export some kind of wrapped version of that. And probably the best way to do that is through canonical roll up bridges on ETH. Probably the worst way to do it would be like a lot of the old mint and lock bridges, kind of third party bridge designs that you saw. And so then the question is like, okay, if most of the money that is in existence is going to be wrapped, it's going to be wrapped anyway, then why wouldn't you just have the yield bearing version of that that's wrapped? And then I think the other thing that is just an interesting, I don't really know how protocols are going to compete on this, but how does, like, if you were just imagine, Vance, you were like unilaterally ethereum or unilaterally celestia, and you were like, all right, my asset can't leave my protocol, but I want to incentivize these roll ups to use my, like, what is the playbook for doing that? Because I think historically people had thought about that.
00:50:31.174 - 00:50:57.520, Speaker C: Like, I'm just going to create a bunch of really useful stuff on my protocol. People are going to come on my protocol, use the stuff, and it's gated in my asset. But as soon as you're like, okay, I actually want people on other protocols to use my asset. You don't have that same lock in. So I'm a little bit unclear on what the overall playbook is going to be in order to. How do you convince people on other roll ups where you don't have that lock in to want to use and hold your thing?
00:50:58.210 - 00:52:00.126, Speaker A: I mean, that's like one argument for the l two approach versus the monolithic approach, right? Where it's like, in my mind, you can have a bajillion TPS, you can drive fees to zero. Let's just say I'm like a monolithic protocol, whatever you want to call it. At the end of the day, when I have an app that gets big enough, they're going to be like, I want my own app chain or I want my own x or I want my own y. Keeping value in your ecosystem is not a technical problem. It's an incentive alignment problem. And every single chain and every single, it doesn't matter how it's constructed or what the virtual machine is like, every single chain will experience this a game blows up on your ecosystem. How do you get them to stay when selling block space is arguably another one x of revenue to them? Or at least how do you capture value from that as an ecosystem? And I think one way is you can extract fees from them and try to just keep them on your chain.
00:52:00.126 - 00:53:02.134, Speaker A: I don't think that's going to work long term. I think the other way is you establish your asset as money and as the money that people want to use in this game or in this market, or in this app or whatever. And so I see all this eth being bridged to even places like, say, or Swee or Salana or the l two s, and it's like, sure, those eth, they will generate fees for the main chain whenever people mint or withdraw from that l two or that other chain. But the value that you gain from the monetary premium of that asset getting exported, in my mind, more than makes up for any of the loss fees of that eth not being on the main chain anymore, like, whatever. And a lot of this philosophy stems from, I think money is the most interesting and biggest market for the large scale crypto assets. And bootstrapping a monetary premium is extraordinarily hard, and that's just like one way that you can do it. And so at the end of the day, I think fees are a means to an end for me.
00:53:02.134 - 00:53:36.580, Speaker A: High fees on Eth L one bootstrap, its denomination is money. Eventually, the fees get so high that people want to deploy l two s, or the incentives are just there. We've seen like 1000 roll ups raising. People just want to go launch their own thing and have their own token. That's cool. All of them are running points, programs, trying to get ETH onto their blockchain. That monetary premium is, in my mind, like the most important thing, because the fees on a salon, or the fees on a polygon, or the fees on whatever, you cannot justify the valuation of a lot of these things if they are not money.
00:53:39.430 - 00:54:17.246, Speaker C: I agree with that. I think my broad perspective on this at a 10,000 foot view has been we're going to see the return of commodity like money. I think there are going to be multiple commodity like monies that compete. But I think the playbook for competing as kind of, if your mental model is kind of like an operating system that generates profits, that's very different from competing as a money, actually. And I do think Ethereum has a really good advantage there. Actually, one thing I've been thinking about that's really bullish. Roll ups is, if you think about the ETH roadmap as it stands, there's all of this tbl on l one and all of this activity still.
00:54:17.246 - 00:54:53.260, Speaker C: But I think you correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure the objective is to push most of that up to roll ups. So the TVL of roll ups is just going to, I mean, it's theoretically going to grow by what? Maybe they won't be totally successful and get all of the TVL off Eth. That's probably not desirable. There's probably a lot of people that really like the security assurances of just keeping their stuff on l one. But however you slice it, there's probably ten to $20 billion worth of tbl before there's any asset price appreciation that's just going to migrate up to the l two s. I think one of the things I've been curious about is who's going to get the lion's share of that feeling? It's very bullish arbitram and optimism. Actually.
00:54:55.470 - 00:55:15.940, Speaker A: We'Re holders of optimism, so again, we have bags, but it's been more bullish arbitram than optimism. This is crazy. This number is probably a little dated, but I think arbitram has one and a half million eths in its bridge. That's so much. That's crazy. We're talking about real money.
00:55:16.390 - 00:56:04.426, Speaker C: We are. Well, the other difference, though, between arbitrum and optimism has been the incentives that optimism has paid out versus how much arbitrum has paid out. And as a lover of arbitram, I do look at, they did something called the step short term incentive program, the hundreds of millions of dollars that they're paying out that are going to daps on Arbitrum's chain and then probably just getting dumped. And now there's like, you know, long term incentive program, which implies to me that this is going to be a constant thing. This was an old stat, but I think hasu, a little while ago, we talked about on the show, tweeted out the amount of incentives that various Dydx had paid out. Arbitram, optimism, lido, big chains. It was like, I don't want to misspeak here, but optimism was in the neighborhood of like 200 million, and arbitrage was like 1.4
00:56:04.426 - 00:56:07.746, Speaker C: billion. So there's a massive difference in terms of issuance policy.
00:56:07.928 - 00:56:46.426, Speaker A: I did not realize that. But there is this thing where, again, we see all these l two pitches where it's like we're going to launch an l two. All right. What's step two? Well, we're going to do this points program or give away tokens to get tbl on the chain. It's like, okay, which ecosystem are you going to target to bring tbl over? And frankly, eth is the only asset that is big enough to move the needle for any of these l two s that are launching as much as a lot of them may want to go at. Salana is kind of the next obvious candidate. But it is like an order of magnitude smaller in terms of the capital that's willing to move across chains.
00:56:46.426 - 00:57:13.878, Speaker A: Because a lot of the whole thing with Salana too, is the capital stays on Salana. It's one chain, one team, one dream. The assets don't move. So it's like, I don't know if I think about it, there's just a lot of sources for yield for Eth because it's like you could go to this l two and earn points. You could go restake it in Eigen layer and earn tokens or points or whatever. But that is the asset that people are targeting. And I think that is kind of glossed over.
00:57:13.878 - 00:57:41.390, Speaker A: And I think ecosystems will be known for different things. Bitcoin is digital gold, obviously. Eth, I think, is just like money. I think. I think things like IMX or Ronin, they have a shit ton of users, but they don't generate a ton of economic value, not yet. I think the long term is like, you have a lot of users that generate a lot of economic net value right now. It's just like there's a lot of users, there's not that much economic value.
00:57:41.390 - 00:57:51.460, Speaker A: So each of these things will have a part to play. But I do think the assets that are money are going to just be. They're obviously going to be used differently, but I think they'll be valued differently as well.
00:57:52.870 - 00:58:17.658, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with that. And I think that is a challenge that Solana is going to have to face ultimately. And maybe we can use this as a jumping off point to talk a little bit about Jupiter. So Jupiter had a pretty massive airdrop. I'd say this week it was something to the tune of 700 million. In terms of the deep, they're actually spreading out the airdrop quite a bit. It's over a period of like three years or something like that.
00:58:17.658 - 00:58:52.646, Speaker C: They're going to essentially do multiple successive airdrops. And Jupiter, for those of you who aren't less familiar, they're an aggregator. So aggregators have been much more successful in Solana in general. Again, this is my opinion but it's because of fees, like one inch, and there's another aggregator. But the reason why it's more difficult on Ethereum is because if you're one inch, you ultimately have to make multiple different hops. And the gas costs of doing that are just kind of punitive. So it makes more sense to trade where all the liquidity is on uniswap anyway.
00:58:52.646 - 00:59:22.590, Speaker C: Whereas in Solana, gas fees are much more cheap. So there is actually a lot of value to routing across multiple different dexes. I'd be curious, Vance, in general, what you thought of the airdrop. I do think know as a criticism of Solana here, maybe a constructive are. I think the strains are starting to show a little bit. There were a bunch of transactions that ultimately are kind of starting to fail. And I think the primary reason there is that they don't have a very robust fee market.
00:59:22.590 - 00:59:41.030, Speaker C: There are a lot of changes that need to be made, and ultimately the UX, it doesn't really impact the UX that much because transactions happen so fast and they're so cheap. But you could have like two or three failed transactions in a row, which kind of sucks. But yeah. What did you think overall about the Jupiter airdrop?
00:59:41.610 - 01:00:05.054, Speaker A: Yeah, no blockchain is solved. ETH has not solved the fee issue. Salana has some transactions, failing issues. All the l two s have issues. Nobody's really figured this out. And I think to say otherwise is just kind of being dishonest. So I don't think it's like a huge knock on Salana, but there's obviously just like work to do.
01:00:05.054 - 01:00:48.854, Speaker A: That's okay. And there were a lot of failed transactions just because there was so much interest, which is great for Solana. Deflow was the only aggregator that was still up and processing transactions because they had an order flow model, which is kind of. It's now Solana, I think, has had most of the major airdrops that are going to happen and deflow has not. But most of the major airdrops have happened that were going to happen. And now it's kind of like a what next moment? And I think what is next is increasing liquid staking participation to try to drive some of that monetary premium. And the Jito soul chart is nuts in terms of the supply.
01:00:48.854 - 01:01:10.466, Speaker A: It's just like up, only it's a new all time high basically every day. So I think that's like a really good auger for what's going to go on. You obviously have all the D five primitives being built out as well, with margin Phi and all that stuff. I have less to say on the Jupiter airdrop. I did think that. I don't even know, do they raise, like, 300 million or something?
01:01:10.648 - 01:01:25.814, Speaker C: They raised a lot. Yeah. I'm kind of with you. Look, Jupiter is a great protocol. I think they have super ambitious plans for what they want to do from a product suite standpoint. I'm kind of with you. It was great.
01:01:25.814 - 01:01:52.606, Speaker C: I'm rooting for the team. I always blank on how to pronounce the founder's name, wear meow, or whatever. But I'm really happy for the team, and I thought they executed it well. Solana held up reasonably well as a network. I think it's trading at, like, a five and a half billion dollar FDV right now. I saw some people kind of extrapolating. Vance, what do you think about this? Sometimes when people be like, oh, this newly launched token is trading at this value.
01:01:52.606 - 01:02:03.474, Speaker C: This is how the market is valuing it. And I'm just like, is anyone really valuing this, or is this just trading off of pure sentiment and momentum? I don't know. I would push back a little bit.
01:02:03.512 - 01:03:01.590, Speaker A: The obvious one is it's the same valuation as uniswap. And maybe that was engineered or maybe it was an accident, but I guess there is an argument to make there. The only problem I have with it is, like, look, raising $300 million is, like, a lot of money. And then the other 60 million that they paid to use the launch pad, I do think there are some salona projects who've done the airdrops correctly. Again, biased, but, like, jeto just giving it away to the most loyal, to the people who use it the most. I do think there is a knock on some salon ecosystem projects from the last cycle of, like, some people just went for the cash grab and not saying Jupiter was that, but when you raise $360,000,000, it's like, are you in it for the community? Are you in it for the tech? What happens next? Where does that money get used? It's just weird. I've never seen that before, other than the big icos of 2017.
01:03:02.090 - 01:03:09.370, Speaker C: Yeah. I think the one airdrop that I would still be looking out for is tensor as well. There might be a couple of those.
01:03:09.400 - 01:03:49.080, Speaker A: I'm sort of forgetting tensor. I'm sure the other ones are going to be valuable as well. But after D five summer, it's like, okay, cool, time to go build all this shit and scale the ecosystem up another ten x. There's a lot of other ecosystems that are going to have their moment in the sun. And for a while last year, it felt like the game that everyone was going to play was like Salana was going to catch eth. I think now the game that people are playing, at least what I'm thinking from a venture perspective, is like, shit. Salana is worth $50 billion.
01:03:49.080 - 01:04:10.170, Speaker A: Maybe funding some of the other Alt L ones, or Alt l two s, they can catch Salana. And so I think it's like, okay, cool. All the cake and punch and pie has been handed out, and now it's just, like, time to really build apps and prove that the monolithic thesis, you know, they've got, like, a great community of builders, so I don't think it's impossible.
01:04:11.710 - 01:04:31.838, Speaker C: I was never proponent of the idea that Solana could catch eth. I definitely thought it was really undervalued at a certain point, but it's just going to be hard to make the call on what would make that happen, because I've never seen that happen before. People have been calling for the ETH flipping of bitcoin forever. Has it really happened? The lead is starting to get narrowed a little bit by bitcoin.
01:04:31.934 - 01:04:49.026, Speaker A: Generally, any flipping calls are extremely bearish for that asset. And I've done this, too, before, where I'm like, eth is flipping bitcoin in six months. And then it's like, okay, now ETh BTC is down 20%. I think it's just like, some of the best advice that I've ever gotten is just be very careful with your victory lapse.
01:04:49.218 - 01:05:23.010, Speaker C: Yeah, I think that's a really good point. And if people are looking, there is so much exciting stuff going on in these ecosystems. I would say, like, sui, I think, has been a relatively slept on new l one, which I find super interesting. Obviously, we've been talking about Celestia, even some of the stuff with near. I'm interviewing Ilya Polishkin, and they have a lot of stuff going on. So I think one of their challenges is going to be creating a cohesive narrative around it. But they have this thing called the blockchain operating system, which is a lot of, especially l ones are very focused on what I would call the back end.
01:05:23.010 - 01:06:04.922, Speaker C: Like, what we're describing, like, base layer, very safe, decentralized, secure, money like properties as its asset. But they've created essentially a framework for hosting decentralized front ends, and that actually makes a lot of sense. And they have these things called multi chain accounts, where it's kind of like how ICAs work, where you can custody your assets with near. You can essentially use a near validator as an MPC signer, and they know sort of remotely broadcast transactions that will could execute it on bitcoin or ETh or whatever. Anyway, I have no strong opinion on how any of this stuff plays out, but there's a lot of cool stuff happening. There are a lot of cool experiments being run. And I don't know, I think one of the other things that'll be different about this cycle is we actually have cheap block space that's useful.
01:06:04.922 - 01:06:21.720, Speaker C: People have always said, oh, there's all this cheap block space all over the place, but there's on shitty l ones that no one wanted to do anything on. And now you've got roll ups, you've got Solana, you've got sovereign roll ups on Celestia, wherever. And I think people are going to do some very cool stuff from a product standpoint that people are sleeping on.
01:06:22.170 - 01:07:21.080, Speaker A: Yeah, I was at this conference, I think, two weekends ago, and I was sitting with these people and they're like, eth is in a very precarious position and Solana is going to flip it. And look, this is not to trigger Salana people, but it's like, okay, well, ETH has one guy chasing it, and there's like a 200 billion dollar market cap gap. Salana has like 100 people chasing it. To your point, there's a lot of cheap block space. There's a lot of ecosystems with different approaches. Ultimately, I think how this shakes out is like, who has the best app strategy for their chain and the ability to keep people on a chain? And if one of these gaming chains has 10 million monthly active users, it's like, okay, well, I guess that gets to be a top ten chain, whatever, but there's just going to be a lot of jockeying. It feels like, for probably third place, it feels like that.
01:07:21.080 - 01:07:44.734, Speaker A: Just my perspective, it's like that's where the money is going to be made. Who gets to be the next $50 billion protocol that goes from a billion today to 50 tomorrow. It's not going to be liquid in the same way that an ether or bitcoin is. And you can't pull like a billion dollars out of that. Maybe you could, but that is where my sense of where the money is going to be made.
01:07:44.932 - 01:08:18.678, Speaker C: Yeah. And just the last note on the salana fee thing didn't mean that as a knock on Salana. But I do think, again, one of my predictions for this year is that they're going to do their own 1559. There's a great resource for those of you who are interested called umber research, which I believe is a mashup between ellipsis. So they're the lab team behind Phoenix and Jito. So Lucas has written a couple pieces on there, Eugene has written a couple pieces on there, and there was a piece that just came out by Eugene at ellipsis. And Theo Damondes, who's done a lot of really great work on fee markets.
01:08:18.678 - 01:08:35.594, Speaker C: He works at Bain Capital. And then, so the title of the piece is toward multidimensional Solana fees so we can link it in the show notes if there are any me fe or fee market nerds. I actually almost did the whole next season of Velcro on fee markets. I thought it's a super interesting topic, so I'll be curious to see what Solana ends up doing with that.
01:08:35.652 - 01:09:08.234, Speaker B: Hey everyone, want to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator. Now, Flood is the perfect partner for this episode on the multi chain future because Flood is solving so many of the issues that we're going to be talking about this season. And this is relevant for both traders and devs. So if you are a trader, you should definitely head over to Floodswap and start trading because they solve three massive problems. One, gasless trading, no more pesky trading fees. Two, you don't have to worry about getting front run mev free. And then three, they have excellent order routing so that you know that you are getting the best price.
01:09:08.234 - 01:09:34.590, Speaker B: So head over to Floodswap and click the link in the bottom of the show notes. We're going to send you right there for the devs out there you can leverage Flood's flexible hooks, allowing you to make swapping a first class primitive by adding custom order types like twaps. Or if you're a wallet builder or something like that, you can actually build your own order flow auction in and start recapturing a bunch of that mev. If you want to reach out to them, go to devs at Flood bid or just jump right in the discord. All right, guys, thanks very much. Appreciate you, Flood.
01:09:34.670 - 01:09:48.594, Speaker C: Maybe to close just as like more of a fun riffy sort of topic, Vitalik wrote a piece. He actually wrote two pieces. I haven't read the second one on the end of his childhood. I wonder if that's an Arthur C. Clark. Did he just turn 30? I actually should have.
01:09:48.732 - 01:09:51.462, Speaker A: Yeah, he just turned 30. So happy birthday.
01:09:51.526 - 01:10:51.094, Speaker C: Yeah, I just turned 30 too. So basically same guy? Basically the same guy, yeah, but he also wrote a really interesting piece, I thought, on AI and crypto, and I would be curious to get your take on this. He put AI in four categories, and I don't really want to go through each one because that's just going to end up being a list. But basically he went through all of these different models of how AI and crypto could overlap, and they ranged from on the spectrum of AI is kind of a judge or a rule setter in terms of decentralized crypto systems. If it's crypto is a way to build better AI models all the way on the other side, or if crypto is a participant alongside humans within the context of crypto. And I think he showed that he was excited about it. But I ultimately got like a pretty cautious vibe on the combination of AI and crypto.
01:10:51.094 - 01:10:55.760, Speaker C: So I would just be curious to get your take. I always love reading what he has to say.
01:10:56.290 - 01:11:51.882, Speaker A: I think my take is probably the most practical, where for something like a maker that's a revenue generating business that needs little human intervention, what if we turn that over to AI governance and just said, look, goal, seek for profit within these risk parameters? Ready, set, go. It feels like that's an evolution of dow tools that could really be helpful for a lot of projects that are more mature. Think about uniswap with the fee switch, turn it on and give it to the AI and say what fees should be set on each of these markets, and try to remove the meat space interaction from humans. I think there's a lot of AI stuff that's beyond that. That's like a little bit more like you need to squint to see. Like I saw some people saying know, you know, prove whether AI or whether Taylor Swift's nudes are real or fake on a blockchain. I don't know how the blockchain would tell better than a server.
01:11:51.882 - 01:12:36.398, Speaker A: There's also kind of like you can put the proofs of models that run and making sure that Chat GPT 4.5 actually ran your query instead of Chat GPT four. I think that is potential, but we'll see. It's very speculative. I think it's going to be more of a narrative than a use case for a while. But people like games especially have potentially more use case of this. Like AI arena is building a game where you train an AI and then the AI actually plays for you and you kind of accrue value by building up this ever changing AI model, which you can then earn rewards, sell, do different things with on chain that's like another one, but we'll see.
01:12:36.398 - 01:12:47.700, Speaker A: I think it's like people want the narrative to happen. I think there's a couple of use cases where it could, but I don't think we need to be worried about like a Terminator scenario at any point in the next few years.
01:12:48.470 - 01:13:13.890, Speaker C: Yeah, I feel like I've got no unique perspective on AI and how much you should be worried about it, but I am interested to see. Look, at the very least, this is the collective thought of our analysts. But I agree. I do feel like there is the potential for a massive narrative combination of. You can imagine a world where crypto and AI take off together and it's like, oh my God, the world is changing.
01:13:13.970 - 01:13:14.600, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:13:15.230 - 01:13:44.366, Speaker C: So who knows? I'm going to blank on the name, but there's a guy named Anish Agnehotri who came on here during the season. Really bright guy. Anyway, I think he went over to this company called ritual, which is another, like one of the early polychain guys. And when they launched that, I was like, that's worth looking at because Anish has been a very senior, like kind of crypto when he was eleven years old, and he's like, worked at polychain and these super impressive places.
01:13:44.398 - 01:13:46.626, Speaker A: Dude's a genius. Straight up.
01:13:46.808 - 01:13:56.374, Speaker C: Straight up. So I was like, okay, it is definitely something here. And I know multi chain is pretty bullish. On to work. Something to watch, I would say something to watch.
01:13:56.492 - 01:14:05.820, Speaker A: Yeah, if he says something, it's generally probably worth watching. I'm not in the weeds enough to know what AI is going to do.
01:14:06.830 - 01:14:29.250, Speaker C: Vance, how much, out of curiosity, would you say crypto has become so much more diverse? How do you structure knowledge, even within framework? How much would you say? You personally are like, I'm in the weeds on this and I grock it. Versus how much are you relying on analysts at this point? It's just so hard to keep up with every little nuance of this ecosystem.
01:14:30.550 - 01:15:05.034, Speaker A: Mean, I find it pretty easy, but I know what bitcoin and eth are. I know what the ETF chatter is, right. I have a very instinctual understanding of Defi because I've been doing it literally forever. Gaming is more of a moving target where like, have less of an idea what I'm doing. But I have a strong thesis on the space that I built up over time. And then the AI stuff and kind of more the speculative infrastructure plays. I just try to put analysts on it and cover it from that perspective.
01:15:05.034 - 01:15:47.574, Speaker A: Because once it becomes investable, I want to be there. But at this point, the fund is of a size that we can't make $401 million out of a 400 million dollar fund. So you're also constrained by what your size and strategy is. But there's a bunch of, I think, potentially promising smaller funds that are like, we're just doing parallelized blockchains. We're just doing AI and crypto. It's like if it hits, they're going to be huge, but if it doesn't, it's going to go to zero. So that's kind of the risky run with being more concentrated and focused on emerging areas.
01:15:47.574 - 01:15:51.340, Speaker A: But we can play a little bit later than that, which is fortunate for us.
01:15:51.870 - 01:15:59.550, Speaker C: Yeah. All right, buddy. This was a really fun one. We can probably end it here and. Or is there anything else you wanted to chat about?
01:15:59.620 - 01:16:01.374, Speaker A: That's it. This is a good one.
01:16:01.572 - 01:16:02.858, Speaker C: Cool. All right, partner.
01:16:02.954 - 01:16:03.514, Speaker A: Later, budy.
01:16:03.562 - 01:16:04.030, Speaker C: Good one.
01:16:04.100 - 01:16:04.394, Speaker A: Peace.
01:16:04.442 - 01:16:05.018, Speaker C: See ya.
01:16:05.114 - 01:16:26.870, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Mike here. If you're a bell curve listener, you know that transferring assets across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That is why we're incredible excited to have teamed up with the wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free.
01:16:26.870 - 01:16:29.730, Speaker B: Click the link at the bottom of this episode. Take you get your free nft.
