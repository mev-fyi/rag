00:00:00.170 - 00:00:36.630, Speaker A: I want innovative companies to be able to borrow against the value and the profitability of their business, or against, say, real estate or infrastructure that they have in the case of bitcoin miners, and use the borrowings to make their business to grow. I don't think you can do that if you're only putting down liquid crypto assets as collateral. So for me, it's really more about what is the purpose of borrowing in a corporate sense. It is to grow and to expand businesses so that they can generate more profits in future. And that profit is not to come from speculation.
00:00:37.050 - 00:00:45.740, Speaker B: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that nothing on Bell Curve is financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy.
00:00:48.750 - 00:00:55.774, Speaker C: All right, buddy. Talk to Tedy and Sid today. This was a good conversation. Why do we pick these two guys to talk to?
00:00:55.892 - 00:01:01.870, Speaker B: No matter how many times I tell you to not clap, you are going to clap every time we start an episode.
00:01:02.770 - 00:01:04.720, Speaker C: I'm an Italian. We talk with our.
00:01:07.730 - 00:01:54.958, Speaker B: So. So we've known Teddy and Sid for years now, and we brought on these guys because they saw the two things that we are talking about in this season and really in this episode, fixed rate lend and borrow and under collateralized lending. They were doing this years ago, right? I remember talking to Teddy three years ago, and he was just saying, we really need fixed rate lend and borrow in the space. Same with Sid at Maple. We've known him for years and he's really been preaching the gospel of under collateralized lending and how it's a huge unlock for DFI. And they were doing this back in DFI summer 2020, when all the attention was focused on these protocols that were doing over collateralized lending. And so the attention hasn't been on folks like Notional and Maple as much, but I feel like that is starting to change.
00:01:54.958 - 00:01:57.382, Speaker B: And, yeah, this episode did not disappoint.
00:01:57.546 - 00:02:22.234, Speaker C: No, absolutely. Teddy also used to trade interest rate swaps, which is a cool callback to last episode. And we actually got into the market for interest rate swaps near the end of this episode. And, yeah, Sid and Joe and what those guys are doing at Maple, I kind of feel like they're really pioneering and really banging the drum on under collateralized lending at a time when it's not super popular to be doing under collateralized lending in crypto. Thank you. C five. So, big shout out to those guys.
00:02:22.234 - 00:02:25.658, Speaker C: It's a really interesting episode. Yeah, it'll be a good one.
00:02:25.744 - 00:02:26.794, Speaker B: Let's get into it.
00:02:26.912 - 00:02:41.280, Speaker C: Let's do it. All right, everyone, welcome to another episode of Bell Curve. I'm joined, as always, by my co host Yano. And then we've got Sid Powell from Maple Finance and Teddy Woodward from Notional Finance. Gentlemen, welcome to the show.
00:02:41.890 - 00:02:43.566, Speaker A: Hey, guys, how are you?
00:02:43.748 - 00:02:45.120, Speaker D: Yeah, thanks for having.
00:02:46.870 - 00:03:27.200, Speaker C: Well, guys, maybe we could start just at a really high level here and in past episodes so far of this series we've kind of dedicated a lot of time towards exploring the unlock of fixed rate borrowing lending which I know we're going to be getting into. We want to kind of connect that with this idea that I know both of you are actively focused on which is uncollateralized lending in DeFi. Can we just maybe start at a really high level? How do you guys think about the unlock that uncollateralized lending brings to crypto and then maybe we can kind of get into what you see the ultimate opportunity or kind of market size be maybe in relative to over collateralized lending. So I'll start there with my two part question how do you guys view the unlock of uncollateralized funding in D five?
00:03:28.210 - 00:04:29.460, Speaker A: I can kick it off. The unlock of uncollateralized lending is huge, right? Like if you think of most businesses they are not set up to borrow by depositing liquid financial assets as collateral in order to borrow. And so that is applicable in TradFi and observable in TradFi and I don't view that that would be different as we shift more and more to on chain lending. So my view is that uncollateralized lending is going to be orders of magnitude larger but that also we don't have to differentiate between uncollateralized and collateralized lending purely in terms of digital assets. Like if you look at a lot of corporate lending it might be just secured by a lien on corporate assets that's very common in banking today and would still allow companies and businesses to borrow on chain. They'd just be registering security in favor of the lender off chain when they do so.
00:04:31.110 - 00:05:38.300, Speaker D: Yeah, no, I think that's actually like a really important point Sid, that you just brought up which I think gets lost a lot of the time. So when people think uncollateralized lending in sort of like traditional CFI markets it's not the case that you're lending money to someone and then they can just do whatever they want and never pay you, right? When you lend money to someone that loan is collateralized by the net assets of the borrower, right? So it's not just like you're giving them free money. And so I think that's actually an important point. Because in my opinion, the real differentiation between uncollateralized and over collateralized lending is, like, whether or not you allow the borrower to use their collateral assets productively over the course. Of the loan or whether you sort of force the borrower to give their collateral to the lender for custody over the course of the loan. I think that's an important difference. It's like a different way of looking at it.
00:05:38.300 - 00:06:11.010, Speaker D: I think it's an important thing to note because Notional is actively exploring we're actually about to launch a product that allows people to borrow from Notional and essentially keep the borrowed assets as collateral for the loan but use them productively at the same time. So in a sense it's like allowing the capital efficiency of uncollateralized lending but still maintaining the kind of risk profile of overcollateralized.
00:06:13.350 - 00:06:50.686, Speaker C: You know, to maybe use five year old language or bell curve style language. Basically like most lending really is collateralized. But when a bank is offering a loan to something like Amazon, it's not like, hey, take a billion dollars or whatever and park it at this bank. But the bank is saying, hey, we've seen what you've done in free cash flow, right, for the last ten years. You've got all these data centers which are pretty valuable, okay, we'll give you this loan, you don't need to park that stuff with us and not generate any return on those assets. But you know what's going to happen if you can't repay the loan. So in that sense basically just under collateralized maybe isn't even the right word for it.
00:06:50.686 - 00:06:53.070, Speaker C: It's just hyper capital efficient lending.
00:06:54.070 - 00:06:56.370, Speaker D: That's exactly it, in my opinion.
00:06:57.350 - 00:07:29.594, Speaker C: Okay, so my next question is in non crypto, right? We have this whole set up via government and a system of courts and protection, like a whole understood, a whole rich precedent of property law which says, hey, if you reneg on that then here's what's going to happen, right, and you kind of get plugged into the system. What is the crypto version of that, right? Let's call it hyper capital efficient lending. How do we do that on crypto? Because we haven't really had an enormous amount of that, right?
00:07:29.712 - 00:08:07.122, Speaker A: Yeah. We're not trying to enforce norms of repayment of loan using cryptographic mechanisms. Right. So the way I think about it is we're doing lending is occurring through Maple, but if a borrower doesn't repay, it's still recourse lending. So uncollateralized doesn't mean non recourse and to unpack that what we mean is that if a borrower doesn't repay their loan on Maple, they're still going to have an action brought against them in courts. You're still going to have their business bankrupted or wound up. And so that enforcement is still going to happen through the courts.
00:08:07.122 - 00:09:09.786, Speaker A: The only mechanism by which this is happening in crypto is for a very narrow set of loans, which is loans which are collateralized with liquid digital assets because you can take it and just sell those assets to repay the loan. But that's a very narrow form of borrowing and that's not actually solving the underlying problem, which is that somebody has walked away from an obligation, you're not actually enforcing any obligations on them once you've sold those assets. And so we saw that with the recent volatility from June, July, there were some loans that were under collateralized but they still had recourse. So when the borrow three AC defaulted, their assets were sold, but there was still a court action then brought against them afterwards, which showed that the ability to enforce on chain was kind of limited in that once you'd sold those assets if there was still a shortfall, you had to use the court system. And so we're trying to use the blockchain for a more efficient way to manage and originate lending. We're not necessarily using it to resolve disputes. At the end of the day, what.
00:09:09.808 - 00:10:42.042, Speaker D: I was going to say is that that think I this kind of illustrates a difference in the approach that Notional and Maple are taking. Because Notional does rely on sort of on chain smart contracts to enforce repayments, right? So we fully sort of rely on smart contracts to take the place of the legal system in terms of the kind of default proceedings. So I think what would be good here is first to introduce this new product that we're about to launch called leveraged vaults. So leveraged vaults on Notional basically allow a user to borrow at a fixed rate on Notional and deposit that cash into a whitelisted smart contract that executes a specific yield strategy. So a borrower is able to borrow something like ten times their initial deposit and put the cash into a smart contract that goes and does something with that cash. And so the borrower is able to get a lot of leveraged exposure to the returns of that yield strategy. Now the important thing here is that basically notional retains access to the assets at all times while the borrower is using them to earn yields, right? So Notional is able to liquidate at any time if the value of the assets in the smart contract falls too much.
00:10:42.042 - 00:11:11.700, Speaker D: So basically that is a way of allowing the borrower to have hyper capital efficiency while still retaining the sort of on chain guarantees that smart contracts give you and don't require you to have to go loop in the legal system or any of that. So I think that actually kind of ties into your question pretty well.
00:11:12.070 - 00:11:48.560, Speaker B: Teddy, I think the leverage vaults are really interesting and I want to talk about that in a second, but I actually just want to go I'm curious about the why behind a lot of this and I think the why can be applied maybe to two different questions. One is DeFi historically has centered around over collateralized lending, right? If you look at most of DeFi lend and borrow it's over collateralized. And actually some people would say that that is a feature, maybe not a bug. So I'm curious, I guess why is this the challenge that you guys decided to take on under collateralized lending? And then maybe that's the same question as the second part. But why is this so important to moving DeFi forward?
00:11:52.290 - 00:12:52.674, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the focus on over collateralized lending in DeFi is in large part, I think, just a function of how new the space is. Things in DeFi take a long time to build. Right. Because there's so much risk involved. There's smart contract risk. Doing new stuff takes a lot of time and the space hasn't been around for very long, right? So it naturally sort of started with the easiest thing and the safest thing to do, which is over collateralized lending. Now I think the under collateralized unlock, it really just comes down to capital efficiency, right? It's like if you can allow people to use their collateral assets productively while they're being collateral for loans that they're taking out, you are delivering just massive capital efficiency improvements and something that DeFi has not been able to do yet.
00:12:52.674 - 00:13:05.750, Speaker D: But obviously Sid knows this firsthand because that's what Maple does. And I think it's just like in general, it just comes down to just like massive capital efficiency improvements.
00:13:06.970 - 00:14:41.938, Speaker A: For me, it comes down to and I wholeheartedly agree with everything Teddy said about the over collateralized lending product was easier to build. Not that it is easy to build, but it was just a natural first version of the product where you say, okay, we have this liquid crypto asset, we can take possession of it, we can put it in a smart contract, and then the smart contract can be programmed to liquidate if XYZ condition is met being a threshold collateral value. But if I look at where we need to get to in 100 years, how useful is a product in 100 years where you have to have either have bought ethereum at one 100th of the price it is 100 years from now, or you inherited it. There's no business that is set up that is sitting on one and a half million dollars worth of liquid financial assets that it is then going to borrow against for a productive business purpose. If we look at most of the use of borrowing and lending on chain date of the over collateralized variety has been to express a leveraged view on the direction that a crypto asset is going to go. So you put down wrap Bitcoin or you put down ETH, you borrow stables, you buy more Bitcoin or you buy more ETH with it. So you're taking a leveraged speculative position or you're just monetizing the fact that you bought Bitcoin or ETH or some other asset really early and you're using it for consumptive spending.
00:14:41.938 - 00:15:20.850, Speaker A: What I'm talking about, and what I think is useful is I want innovative companies to be able to borrow against the value and the profitability of their business, or against say, real estate or infrastructure that they have in the case of bitcoin miners, and use the borrowings to make their business to grow. I don't think you can do that if you're only putting down liquid crypto assets as collateral. So for me, it's really more about what is the purpose of borrowing in a corporate sense. It is to grow and to expand businesses so that they can generate more profits in future. And that profit is not to come from speculation.
00:15:21.190 - 00:15:50.220, Speaker C: Yeah, maybe. Actually I could quote Teddy from your own white paper. The white paper that notional published. This is, I guess now a little bit dated in terms of the data, but in 2018 there was some $16 trillion worth of outstanding corporate debt in the US. 88% of that was uncollateralized. And again, we're using that in that somewhat fluid meaning. But overall when you look at the analog it's pretty stark, right.
00:15:50.220 - 00:16:39.500, Speaker C: The way that lending goes on in TradFi and it makes sense to me that that would get replicated in crypto because even just thinking about it as from blockworks perspective, as a prospective borrower, if we were going to borrow, it would one, it would probably have to be at a fixed rate. We're not going to borrow at a rate that might ten X in a month from now, even if it's just temporary. And then B, it wouldn't make sense for us to do like a collateralized loan where we converted some of our balance sheet into ETH and then parked that somewhere and then got utility. It's like, no, we would just want more money, right. So that we can actually actively invest that and be capital efficient with it. So when I think about it from the perspective consumer of debt in this space, from a company standpoint, it makes an enormous amount of sense because over collateralized lending is basically just a way to get leverage off the assets that you already have. Right? In a way.
00:16:39.500 - 00:16:51.120, Speaker C: So I would guess that the actual market for productive debt is at least an order of magnitude larger. But I don't know.
00:16:51.570 - 00:16:53.280, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's true.
00:16:54.450 - 00:16:55.294, Speaker C: Cool.
00:16:55.492 - 00:17:42.400, Speaker B: Does that mean that the customer set is going to really change for lend and borrow? Because I feel like the customer set and the user set of the ave's and compounds right now is obviously you have funds who borrow from these things but it really is a lot of consumers when you start switching to this under collateralized lending model, it really unlocks it for companies. Right. Which is what Mike is saying. Does that kind of turn on the lend and borrow market for protocols for DAOs right. Who historically have only had one way to raise capital, which is through equity and through tokens, but does this unlock this huge new area in DeFi that's never even been explored yet? Maybe. Sid, I'd oh Sid, I also have my maple hat I forgot to put on. So I will throw this question to you and put my maple hat on.
00:17:43.250 - 00:18:46.070, Speaker A: Love it. Yeah, absolutely. So if you think of a Dow as an organization that's been set up to pursue a business purpose, then you know, the focusing the borrowing and lending market on chain onto corporate borrowing purposes would open up that as a segment. I think what we saw over Q Two of this year was that there was a bit of a shakeout there. So you had a lot of Dows that turned out they might have been sitting on a token might have been a group of very competent people, but they were sitting on something that hadn't yet achieved product market fit. So I think what we would want to or need to see would be a Dow that's found product market Fit such that they have a product that's generating revenues for them and that they have a team that is sound, that is cooperative because management due diligence is something that goes into this underwriting process. But then assuming that they pass that credit worthiness test, they would be able to borrow and they would be able to borrow without having to just put down a huge whopping chunk of assets.
00:18:46.070 - 00:19:02.620, Speaker A: And the borrow would be based on expected future profitability and their ability to service and repaid a loan. So I think it would force them to adhere to higher standards of operating and professionalism amongst the management team there.
00:19:03.070 - 00:19:23.214, Speaker D: Yeah, and I think this is a really cool sort of growth area and to kind of take it back to what we were talking about at the beginning of the conversation, when someone lends to something like Amazon or Ford, implicitly they're lending against the future cash flows that that business will generate.
00:19:23.262 - 00:19:23.666, Speaker C: Right.
00:19:23.768 - 00:19:59.782, Speaker D: Like that's sort of implied in the loan. Now, the cool thing with DeFi is that you can precisely sort of define and tokenize the future revenues that the protocol is going to generate and you can explicitly use that as collateral against a loan. Right. So you're collateralizing a loan with profit that hasn't yet been generated. Right. And I think that's definitely going to happen and I think that's a really cool sort of application of DeFi.
00:19:59.846 - 00:20:00.230, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:00.320 - 00:20:29.510, Speaker B: This might be a real middle of the bell curve question here, but if you collateralize a loan with governance tokens, is that really a collateralized loan or is that more uncollateralized? Right, because when I think of collateral, it's this safe thing that you can seize basically. But a governance token could fall 90% in the next two months. So how do you think about giving out loans that are backed by these governance tokens?
00:20:31.850 - 00:20:34.680, Speaker D: We saw some credit risk, for sure.
00:20:35.610 - 00:20:37.030, Speaker A: Go ahead, Teddy.
00:20:37.630 - 00:21:17.670, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's like somewhere in the middle, right. I think collateral sits on a spectrum of quality. So if you have ether rap bitcoin or something like that, you feel comfortable saying that when someone borrows that you're not taking any credit risk. Now, if you're lending to a Dow and they're collateralizing 100% with their project token that is super volatile and not super liquid, it's better than not collateralizing with anything. It's not like that collateral is worth nothing from a lender standpoint. But if you're actually going to make that loan, you're going to do so with the knowledge that you're taking credit risk.
00:21:20.410 - 00:21:53.786, Speaker A: Yeah. An over collateralized loan. There's still a probability of default. And there were a ton of defaults on Maker and Ave and Compound over Q Two. It's just that what you're doing is you're saying we don't care about the probability of default if the loss given default is zero and the loss given default is zero is if we sell the collateral when it's above the value of the loan. And so you look at Porter Finance when they did that over collateralized ribbon loan. So that was like 500% collateralized from memory.
00:21:53.786 - 00:22:37.898, Speaker A: What they're looking at is if the borrower defaults collateral is worthless. Right. Because what's someone going to pay for a bunch of ribbon tokens if the ribbon Dow had defaulted. But where the collateral as a protective mechanism comes in is that if the volatility of the ribbon token dipped below a required collateral amount before the required collateralization level before the event of default occurs, then you would sell the token so that you can recoup the value of loan. But you're doing that before the borrower defaults. It's a measure of sequencing or a matter of sequencing. You're not waiting for the borrower to default and then going we're going to sell the tokens.
00:22:37.898 - 00:22:54.338, Speaker A: You're waiting and if the tokens drop in value you're selling them before the borrower defaults so that you still protect your position. So in that way it would still be considered collateralized but the arrow of causation is going the other way. Does that make sense?
00:22:54.504 - 00:22:55.442, Speaker C: Yeah, it does.
00:22:55.496 - 00:22:56.134, Speaker B: It's a good deal.
00:22:56.172 - 00:23:39.554, Speaker C: I was thinking about it's a good deal for the issuer and probably for both parties in general because it's another way you can actually incentivize whoever's issuing the debt to not actually sorry. It's a good deal for the borrower that's collateralizing. It like ribbon in this case because what, you don't want to actually cause a default because as soon as you cause a default then basically their equity goes to zero and then whatever collateral backup you had becomes useless anyway. And to your point Sid, because that was just a single issue right? There's not like an enormous amount of debt outstanding. But you can imagine if they issued a whole bunch of debt then not everyone could sell the collateral at the same time. Right. Someone wouldn't be able to get out.
00:23:39.554 - 00:23:47.750, Speaker C: Only the very first people would. But it is kind of an interesting way of aligning incentives between yeah, it is uncommon though.
00:23:47.820 - 00:24:04.522, Speaker A: You wouldn't typically see a borrower in a TradFi sense collateralize a loan with their own equity. You wouldn't see Apple collateralize alone and Apple shares. Right.
00:24:04.656 - 00:24:25.470, Speaker C: You have seen one really famously dolo. Really? Yeah. They had a bunch of those little off balance sheet vehicles as collateralized in a fun little part of history. Yeah. That we keep not saying that riddle. Yeah. But that is a relatively similar structure.
00:24:25.470 - 00:25:18.770, Speaker C: Do you guys see though because we've talked about in past interviews of this series just if and when Dows add debt financing to the mix, right. A lot of Dow growth is based off of issuing rewards and basically all the financing that's been done to date, either on the Dow level or the company equity level has been equity level financing. At a certain point, you would think Dows will become big enough that it's like, hey, maybe we do have product market fit, maybe we do have cash flows that are relatively predictable going out into the future. At that state, you would probably guess someone on the finance team is going to say, hey, we should be looking into debt as an alternative here. And the reason I'm singling Dows out here is I would kind of think that if it's a Dow you'd rather source that on chain versus trying to go to a bank or something like that. But what do you guys think of that hypothesis?
00:25:19.670 - 00:26:12.478, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it makes a ton of sense. I mean, in general, I suppose it all depends, but I think there's a lot of situations where you'd much rather borrow than sell equity or sell tokens. Right. And especially protocol communities I think would definitely be in favor of that, where that's a possible course of action. And then as for where they get that loan from, the thing is if the protocol or if the Dow doesn't have a legal entity and most of them don't, or it's hard to fit into the legal framework, you're not going to be able to have a traditional sort of legal contract or loan agreement. Right. When you lend to this Dow.
00:26:12.478 - 00:26:33.674, Speaker D: If they're not a legal entity, how do you set up a legal contract? But they're an on chain entity so I think they will naturally fit into a contract that is codified on chain. I think that's just a better fit for the nature of the business.
00:26:33.792 - 00:26:34.074, Speaker C: Right.
00:26:34.112 - 00:26:46.990, Speaker D: It's an on chain entity and I think it just makes more sense that loans to those DAOs are going to be sourced on chain and governed by smart contracts, not legal contracts.
00:26:49.330 - 00:28:14.490, Speaker A: We're kind of seeing something similar, though, Michael, where any stablecoin that's issued by a Dow is kind of an unsecured loan to that Dow in a lot of cases, unless it is immediately redemptive for the assets held in that Dow. You're kind of an unsecured creditor to a smart contract in that if there's a hack, you have no recourse. Right. Like we saw this with Faye, there was no recourse to get those funds back and get a payment there outside of the demand, I guess outside of eventually deciding via both that I wanted to pursue that most of the stable coins that are being issued or proposed to be issued on chat.
00:28:14.830 - 00:28:16.620, Speaker C: Where do you guys see opportunity.
00:28:21.170 - 00:28:29.002, Speaker A: In terms of new lending? Do you want to have a first crack, Teddy?
00:28:29.066 - 00:29:31.090, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. I think that the majority of the demand in the near term is going to come from kind of the same stuff that we've seen recently, right. Or basically, I think the majority of the demand in the near term comes from sort of trading and speculative use cases because I think that is still kind of the main driver. It's just the main sort of source of economic activity in crypto. I think we are starting to see at least on a fully on chain in the sort of fully on chain crypto native economy, if you will. I think we're starting to see glimmers of economic activity that isn't purely speculative but the reality is that most of this is still kind of centered around trading and providing liquidity and stuff like that. So I think that's still going to be where kind of the near term demand is going to come from.
00:29:31.090 - 00:29:49.240, Speaker D: I think that Dow borrowing and some of these use cases are super exciting and I do believe that they will come to fruition. But I think just realistically in the near term it's not like going to be the major source of demand for this.
00:29:49.610 - 00:31:04.814, Speaker A: Yeah, I expect you'll see sources from corporate borrowers who are currently outside of crypto coming into the space as on ramps get easier. So I cannot stand using banking facilities. I hate using my card. I hate transferring money between accounts, I love using USDC I can transfer it from transfers between wallet is extremely easy. And the only time I ever off ramp it is when I need to put it towards a debit card or a credit card just so I can transact and buy coffees and food. I would be very surprised if within three years, you're not using some form of digital payment on your phone to transfer money from your, ERC, 20 wallet or your salana wallet directly to the wallet of a merchant, which could be a cafe or coffee shop, because they're going to be able to take your payment without paying? 3% to the Visa or the Mastercard Network. Just economic reality is going to set in that that is going to become the normal way of doing things as soon as people are kind of aware of and able to access that technology.
00:31:04.814 - 00:31:27.880, Speaker A: So when that happens, I would see more borrowers who might be fintechs, they might be SaaS companies, but they're going to be outside of what we would call crypto native day, who are going to be taking out loans. On chain because apples to apples it will be so obvious that it is ten x better than going through currently your bank or your venture debt credit fund.
00:31:29.710 - 00:32:29.050, Speaker D: Sid this is something that I've sort of thought of too is that people ask what's going to drive sort of mainstream adoption or mass adoption of DeFi. And it seems to me it's going to be when you can actually pay people with stablecoins and people actually want to hold stablecoins and they can use them right in the way that we use USD or cash today. And that makes a lot of sense to me. I'm curious kind of. What do you think stands in the way of that happening? Right? And I wonder to what extent, if you want to sort of get into the real economy so branch out from what is crypto native? To what extent is regulatory clarity a necessary precondition for that happening? I don't know. I'm just asking if you have an opinion, Sid.
00:32:30.270 - 00:33:01.670, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. Regulatory clarity is what would help larger institutions like banks to get into this space. I note that banks can't offer digital banking services that occur on chain to anyone. At the moment, none of them will. One, underwrite that regulatory risk, I saw. Two, there was recent guidance from the SEC that a bank would have to consider any crypto asset held on deposit as a liability and therefore hold cash against that. So that means banks are going to be very slow to offer digital services or digital asset services to their clients.
00:33:01.670 - 00:33:49.042, Speaker A: What is going to happen then is it would be like forbidding Walmart to offer online ordering or online delivery. So the free market will create entities because people will see the opportunity and see that it's profitable and they'll raise capital and then go and build out those businesses that will just operate in a slightly different way. You can already see that there were a ton of entities created that could either take deposits or offer fiat on and off ramps. But those entities will spring up and they will just own that part of the workflow. So you'll probably take money. Either you'll take US dollars, convert it to USDC, house it with one of those entities, and you actually wouldn't even need a debit card. You would just use a phone app to pay for those things with merchants.
00:33:49.042 - 00:34:38.120, Speaker A: But that regulatory clarity prevents the 100 billion dollar plus incumbents from offering that service and it creates the vacuum through which new entrepreneurs will create new businesses that can operate there. I know there are a ton of very large customers who are banked by Citigroup, by Morgan, by Wells Fargo who call those companies or their bankers there. And you know, we have some customers who want to pay in USDC or some vendors who want to receive payment in a digital asset, particularly those who are kind of in the entertainment sector. But the banks can't actually serve that need. So they're forced to take their banking services, or rather their banking business to other providers who can do that.
00:34:38.970 - 00:35:25.490, Speaker C: How do you guys think about the changing environment and rates in between TradFi and crypto and where does that create either headwinds or potential opportunities for you? Because like a year ago there was a lot of talk about bringing in capital from TradFi into crypto to chase some of the yields that were available. And now those yields have compressed largely in crypto. But it makes sense to me then that the inverse of that actually could be true, that it should be cheaper to borrow than in crypto as well, whereas it's getting more expensive to borrow in TradFi, frankly. So I'd be curious to just get a sense of how you guys think about just the changing rate environments which are weirdly kind of inverse of each other in crypto versus TradFi.
00:35:28.890 - 00:36:32.746, Speaker D: Yeah, so that's actually something that I found very, I suppose very surprising. So as TradFi rates like US Treasuries are something like three and a half percent or wherever they are and that is substantially higher than a lot of yields that you see in sort of DeFi protocols. And I've personally been very surprised that this cash is staying in DeFi. It is not exiting the system or it has not exited the system so far. I sort of would have expected that people would kind of do that to take advantage of higher rates that they can achieve off chain. So far they haven't. Now I think that eventually, yes, if it's cheaper to borrow in DeFi than it is in CFI yeah, eventually that will happen.
00:36:32.746 - 00:37:24.700, Speaker D: Right. So there will be sort of mechanisms for people to borrow in DeFi as opposed to CFI. I think probably the way it starts is if you think about like if you're taking out a mortgage, you're borrowing to buy a house. If you are a very wealthy crypto person, it makes sense now to borrow against your crypto assets to fund your purchase of a house rather than actually just go get a mortgage because the rates are substantially better for borrowing on chain. So I think you might see that sort of marginal activity to start with just because that functionality already exists. I think it's super interesting to think about how you can sort of.
00:37:28.350 - 00:37:28.762, Speaker C: Bring.
00:37:28.816 - 00:38:24.090, Speaker D: In the borrowing demand that sort of like borrowing against real world assets. I think that's very interesting. I think it's like a really hard problem and it's going to take, I would say a while to be able to solve that. But I do think that with the divergent rate environments, for the first time there's actually an economic incentive for doing that because I think that people talked about real world assets a year ago and at that time it just didn't make any sense. It's like why would you borrow in DeFi versus CFI when rates are so much higher? It's cool, but it didn't make economic sense. And now with that actually there being an economic incentive to do so, I can see that there's more kind of progress made to that, but I think it's like a really kind of tough and long term problem.
00:38:24.240 - 00:38:38.414, Speaker B: Teddy, have you flipped on your because I remember earlier this year when we were talking you were pretty bearish on real world assets like in maybe Q One or something. You're like yeah, like overhyped not going to happen anytime soon. But it sounds like your mentality on that is kind of changing.
00:38:38.462 - 00:39:31.860, Speaker D: No, I still believe what I've said. So I think that ultimately my feeling on that is still that it's going to take a long time and you're not going to see it anytime soon. By soon I mean within the next year or two. I don't think it's likely. And so that's kind of not where we've been focusing our efforts just because I think that kind of the hurdles to actually making that happen are substantial. Maybe what is actually required to be able to borrow from an on chain protocol against something like real estate, maybe the way it turns out is that what you actually need to do is you need to pass a law in Congress that explicitly recognizes DeFi as.
00:39:34.630 - 00:39:35.090, Speaker A: That.
00:39:35.160 - 00:39:43.350, Speaker D: Explicitly sort of makes this possible. I think that's quite possible, that that's the kind of outcome you would need.
00:39:43.500 - 00:39:44.200, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:44.970 - 00:40:11.358, Speaker B: Sid, how do you think about that? Because real world assets are really interesting. I think a lot of protocols are considering them right now because you can just really increase the total addressable market and increase the kind of supply side of the equation. But also when you're a protocol and you inherit with real world assets you kind of lose the advantages of DeFi and kind of inherit the problems of TradFi. So I'm curious if you agree with Teddy disagree where you fall out on that?
00:40:11.524 - 00:40:15.586, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean we've always held that the bigger benefit in doing lending on.
00:40:15.608 - 00:40:17.390, Speaker C: Chain is operational and settlement.
00:40:17.470 - 00:41:12.862, Speaker A: It's not necessarily bringing management of credit risk on chain. So the use of real world assets in on chain lending is the way it's discussed today, is actually a very narrow form of lending or it's a very huge market. But it is one type of lending which is they're talking about lending to asset originators. So you're lending to a company that does loans and that company is tokenizing its loans. If it does car loans, it's tokenizing ownership of the car or a secured shadow mortgage on that car and bringing that on chain. But what's happening is you're lending that lending company USDC, so it's on chain but then that company is converting it into Fiat off chain and then it's sending out the money off chain. So you still have the problem of it needs to record in a spreadsheet or some other database that all of those repayments against its thousand car loans, which ones occurred.
00:41:12.862 - 00:41:56.702, Speaker A: So the costliest element of a securitization is still occurring off chain, which is you have to pay a bunch of people and have them spend a bunch of time recutting spreadsheets to say which loans are repaid and which ones weren't. Then it's sending the money back on chain to one omnibus account and then recording which of your tokenized loans received money and which one didn't. And in arrears. So you still have the whole whack of the inefficiency or the inefficient part is all happening on chain. All you've done is found a way to easily get that lending company money. And so that's why you're typically seeing the lending companies that want to pursue that are naturally riskier in nature. So what I'm more interested in is keeping the loans on chain.
00:41:56.702 - 00:42:43.146, Speaker A: And maybe you can tokenize the security. So you can do a loan against a $10 million commercial real estate piece of commercial real estate. And if you tokenize ownership of that, you could do that loan on chain. But that's where the loan itself is, on chain as well as the security. So the problem with a lot of real world assets just to bring it back again is that the actual loans are off chain and you're just recording a registry of the security on chain but all of the inefficient parts still happening off chain. What we're looking at doing is doing loans to businesses that are maybe outside cryptos. These could be fintechs or SaaS companies still recording like a security off chain but the loan itself would be kept on chain.
00:42:43.146 - 00:43:02.790, Speaker A: So it's almost a little bit of an inverse but I see that as a bridge towards real world asset lending where then we can start to record a UCC filing or we can put the asset in an LLC and tokenize the ownership of that LLC. That's where we start to then bring the security on chain for what is already an on chain loan.
00:43:03.770 - 00:43:36.740, Speaker C: What do you guys think about just the idea like again, maybe looking out into the future a little bit right now the vast majority of we're talking about collateralized versus uncollateralized but I also want to get your opinion on fixed rate versus variable lending. Right. We kind of understand and have unpacked why most of the lending and borrowing that's done in crypto is variable rate. But I'd be curious to what degree you think it's an unlock that fixed rate lending comes on chain and then if so, what are the roadblocks that you guys see associated with that? Why hasn't it happened yet?
00:43:39.590 - 00:43:41.650, Speaker D: Fixed rate lending is on chain.
00:43:42.630 - 00:43:50.580, Speaker C: I knew you're going to say as a meaningful enormous percentage of it majority is still variable, right?
00:43:56.010 - 00:45:56.190, Speaker D: So there are a couple of reasons I think. First of all, when you talk about the majority of lending being variable rate, I think that's generally true in DeFi and not CFI in the markets that citize more active in. I think those are all generally fixed rate as. So I think that why it's happened in DeFi is partially it's that again, DeFi is relatively new and variable rate protocols are easier to build and easier to bootstrap and so they just kind of happened first. But also I think that for the majority of DeFi's existence fixed rates weren't from a borrowing perspective, they weren't a critical need. And the reason for that is when you look at sort of like the history of borrowing in DeFi, when DeFi first started basically there was only one reason anybody ever borrowed, and that was to go levered law, right? So you'd put your ETH down in like Compound or Aave, borrow stablecoins, buy more ETH, and when you do that, basically you're playing for tripling your money in two weeks or something, right? And you paying a variable rate of interest, whether it's 5% or 15% APY, it doesn't materially affect your economic outcome. So it's just like not that important for you to be able to fix your rate when what you're doing is something so speculative with such like a broad range of outcomes, right? And then you had D five summer and now people kind of had a new reason to borrow and that reason was sort of borrowing stablecoins so that they could farm yield while retaining their crypto exposure.
00:45:56.190 - 00:47:38.670, Speaker D: Now, for most of DFI summer, or sorry, for most of 2021, I guess, yields were really high, so you could borrow stablecoins at 5% and get 70% APIs. So when you had super high margins like that, again, I think fixed rate lending or fixed rate borrowing is nice, but it's not critical because if you're getting 70% APY, whether you're paying five or 10% to borrow just isn't that important. But I think that increasingly and going forward, fixed rate borrowing is going to be more and more important because margins have come down substantially. So the difference between the sort of borrowing rates and the yields that you can earn with capital have compressed a lot. So maybe borrowing rates are something like 2% and you can earn 5%, right? And so the margin between your borrowing rate and sort of the yield you can earn with your stable coins is very low. And because of that, if you want to lever up and gain higher returns, if you're using variable borrowing costs with margins this low, you are exposing yourself to a lot of risk, right, because a small movement in the borrowing rate can completely erase your profit margins. And this is actually something that I think DeFi users have seen firsthand just recently.
00:47:38.670 - 00:48:52.470, Speaker D: And this is kind of getting into the Dgen weeds a little bit. But a popular trade recently has been to borrow ETH on Ave Mint staked ETH borrow more ETH and sort of do that leverage loop where you're relying on sort of variable borrowing rates because you're borrowing ETH at a variable rate and you're earning the staked ETH yield. Right, which puts you at a ton of risk to increasing sort of ETH borrow rates. And that has happened over the last few weeks. And so people that have done that trade are like for the last few weeks, we're looking at like negative 50, negative 75% APYs on that strategy, right? So it's pretty dire, I think that in this environment, as things have become so much more efficient, fixed rate borrowing becomes really critical. And this is kind of like the product that we're delivering with leverage vaults that we haven't talked too much about yet but that's kind of what the point of this product is is it's allowing you to borrow to fund a yield strategy with fixed borrowing?
00:48:53.930 - 00:49:35.682, Speaker C: Yeah, we talked with Simon Jones of Volts and he was kind of talking to us I'll tell you this, your background too in interest rate swap markets and we were talking interest rate swap markets are a critical component for how fixed yields get created, right? Because basically, even out in TradFi, right, there's kind of a variable loan, which maybe it used to be Libor, maybe now it's sofer and then you get like Sofa Plus 1% or something like that. And someone will basically you'll use options markets to lock in a fixed yield, and someone will basically take the other side of that bet. So it's like there are three reasons why you would use there are three purposes for these types of markets, which is one speculation, I feel like.
00:49:35.736 - 00:49:36.050, Speaker A: Check.
00:49:36.120 - 00:50:08.960, Speaker C: We've got that in Crypto, right? So boom, we've got that. But then you also need people who are trying to risk manage, basically, and I'm blanking on the third reason, but it's like actual real use case for this. So it's like corporates that are hedging foreign exchange rate exposure or things like that, or there's risk management that's going on with big hedge funds and stuff and I feel like that more professional use case is what we are maybe missing right now. And those actors I think eventually will come, but they're not here yet.
00:50:09.490 - 00:51:09.860, Speaker A: It's because we don't have tenor in on chain lending so far. So if you look at it, there are open term loans done in CFI, they will generally have a fixed rate, we have Maple does fixed rate loans, notional does fixed rate loans, but what's missing is tenor out across a long enough time horizon. So it's when you're looking at I'm going to deploy capital, but it might be for two or three years. And so I want to lock in a spread. Like, I'm comfortable assessing what spread I should be paid. Let's say it's 500 basis points, but I'm not sure what the benchmark I should be paid that spread on top of. Is that's why it exists in Tradvice? You might have in Australia we used to have like BBSW or Sofa but what you're saying is that Basis could move out and I'm comfortable what the piece I want to lock in now is my corporate or my counterparty credit risk and that's what I'm getting paid the 500 basis points for.
00:51:09.860 - 00:52:00.930, Speaker A: If I set a fixed rate now on a three year loan, then I'm short the risk that the benchmark rate goes right out and then I'm not getting paid an adequate spread versus what I would have been if I had actually instead maybe locked in benchmark plus 700 or 800 basis points or 7%. What we're looking at now is we're looking at launching pools that would do longer dated loans and that's where you're going to start to get in tenor and that's where people will want to start to lock in either lock in or hedge and take a variable position on interest rates over that kind of tenor. But that's where you start to get more professional balance sheets in who need to hedge that risk.
00:52:01.430 - 00:52:04.100, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's also like.
00:52:05.990 - 00:52:06.318, Speaker A: In.
00:52:06.344 - 00:53:35.170, Speaker D: Terms of interest rate swaps, so I think generally one of the biggest reasons that those instruments exist is to balance different preferences between lenders and borrowers. So basically the driving engine of the interest rate swaps market in TradFi is the fact that you've got issuers debt, issuers got borrowers and you've got lenders and sometimes the borrower wants to borrow variable, but the lender wants to lend fixed, right? And so how do you reconcile those two preferences? So basically what will happen is the borrower will borrow at a fixed rate from the lender because that's what the lender wants and the lender is going to give them a good price because they're sort of like matching their preference. And then the borrower actually wants to pay the floating rate because maybe the floating rate is going to be lower for the next two years before going up such that it's higher than the fixed rate for the following three years of the loan or something, right? And then the borrower is going to go trade an interest rate swap with a bank to get them the floating exposure that they actually want while at the same time the lender gets the fixed exposure that they want. So it's like interest rate swaps. That's really why they exist.
00:53:38.870 - 00:53:51.750, Speaker C: The problem then, being in crypto that there is not a heterogeneous enough pool of both borrowers and lenders to basically have there be a market for standing in the middle of those transactions.
00:53:52.650 - 00:53:58.360, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that it's like.
00:54:00.270 - 00:54:00.730, Speaker A: You.
00:54:00.800 - 00:54:13.754, Speaker D: Need that demand to be there first. My feeling is that the interest rate swaps kind of come second, or in the sense that go ahead.
00:54:13.952 - 00:54:58.730, Speaker C: Is that kind of the problem, though, always in crypto is that you're sitting around waiting for demand for two years, and then it's like, more demand than you're drowning in demand. And your biggest problem is, like, how do I fulfill all this demand? I actually remember I keep attributing this to Selkus I'm sorry Selkus if this wasn't you but I remember reading this very compelling piece about why DEXes were never going to find product market thing never and it was because like well what's the point? Just do more capital efficient, better trading on a centralized exchange so that will win the professional traders and then it'll be like hobbyists who just think it's cool to trade on chain and what nobody saw coming was mev so you know what I mean? It's always very easy and I actually remember another quote again from 2018.
00:55:00.670 - 00:55:00.986, Speaker B: Where.
00:55:01.008 - 00:55:15.514, Speaker C: Basically everything that was getting funded back then was CFI capital market stuff like exchanges and lenders and that sort of thing. And everyone was like, hey, we've got all this great infrastructure but nothing to trade. And then suddenly it was like, there's more to trade than anyone knows what to do.
00:55:15.652 - 00:56:04.826, Speaker D: To be clear, Mike, I'm not suggesting that you shouldn't try and build these things because the thing is all this stuff, when you're building hardcore protocols that's heavy on the tech, it takes years to get it to a point where it really works. Basically. My sort of feeling with it is that you have to be willing to take risk in the sense that you're building for something that you have to anticipate it being there, even if it's not totally there yet. Because it's going to take you years to get your product to a point where it is able to satisfy this demand. And if you wait till the demand is there, probably you're going to lose out to somebody that started building it two years earlier.
00:56:04.938 - 00:56:05.600, Speaker A: Right.
00:56:06.290 - 00:56:25.958, Speaker B: What does crypto look like in two or three years? What seems obvious to you guys right now that maybe you think is not that obvious to other folks, but what crypto looks like, and specifically, probably the lend and borrow space in crypto in like two or three years that maybe others don't see yet. Sid maybe, or Teddy, whoever wants to.
00:56:25.964 - 00:56:29.800, Speaker D: Say, I definitely have one for this. But I was like say Sid, you can go first.
00:56:31.290 - 00:57:11.438, Speaker A: I was going to say go first, but sure. I think what's obvious is that in two or three years you're going to see a lot of people who weren't in crypto participating in it. And by this I mean companies that are outside of the crypto native sector. So two years ago it was inconceivable that you would ever have uncollateralized lending done on chain. Then it was a big thing. It was happening in CFI, it was happening on chain. I think two years from now it's going to be really obvious that you'll have companies who are outside of the crypto native sector who are borrowing or lending on chain because you'll have better access to on and off ramps.
00:57:11.438 - 00:57:47.570, Speaker A: And so then it's going to be really obvious because what everyone says now is, why would you ever do this on chain when you just go and do this through a bank, but when you have easy access to it, then there's less friction and people will just go with whatever is a better user experience, easier to use, more accessible? And that's when an apples to apples comparison becomes more readily available and where the marketplace can just decide to use it. So I think two, three years better access to on and off like that's where you're going to start to see a significant jump in the volume of lending and borrowing done on chain.
00:57:48.790 - 00:58:57.074, Speaker D: Yeah, cool. I think that's sid I think that's like a really interesting perspective and it's stuff that personally Notional is focused in a bit of a different direction. But it's interesting for me to hear your perspective because I think that's like kind of the direction you're going in is also a very important direction. But anyway, I guess the thing that I think is going to be there a couple of years from now and it's something that we're working on at Notional is I think that what you're going to see is like the same kind of know the same kind of lending activity that is done in sort of CFI lending to traders to pursue delta neutral strategies. They are operating on a bunch of different centralized venues. They're running these sort of very complex strategies across a bunch of different places. I think you're going to see that same thing in DeFi.
00:58:57.074 - 00:59:10.700, Speaker D: Like you're going to see a DeFi version and it's going to make it clear exactly why DeFi has so many advantages relative to CFI. And so to make this clear.
00:59:12.690 - 00:59:13.006, Speaker A: So.
00:59:13.028 - 01:00:55.466, Speaker D: What I'm saying is, I think what you're going to see is protocols like Notional are going to be able to fund sort of leveraged trading accounts that give the manager of that account access to the funds that they've borrowed, that they can use across a bunch of different DEXs and perpetual swap trading protocols in DeFi, and basically allow them to do all the same things that you can do in CFI. But because it's all on chain and because it's based on smart contracts, you actually don't have to take any credit risk at all. And that's what I think is so cool and that's I think going to be a primary benefit of DeFi over CFI. That is going to become clear because I think if you look at the sort of CFI equivalent, right, so traders that are borrowing to again engage in delta neutral strategies across centralized exchanges even though what they're doing is very low risk. You as a lender still have to take credit risk because you have to trust that they're actually going to do what they say they're going to do. You have to trust that they're not just going to take the money and run. There is no way, even if they are completely honest, which I think in general that's a relatively safe assumption, it's not 100% safe, but it's reasonable to think that even if these borrowers are completely honest, they can't prove it to you.
01:00:55.466 - 01:01:50.574, Speaker D: So you still have to take this credit risk. And the thing that's beautiful about DFI is by lending to a smart contract that allows the owner of that smart contract to do these different things, you can replicate that same kind of CFI lending, but you don't have to trust the guy that's operating that smart contract because the smart contract is Codified. To only let them do a certain set of things within Codified risk limits. Right. If they try to submit a transaction that causes them to become too long or too short, the transaction will fail. Right. So they literally can't not do or they literally can't not do what they said they were going to do.
01:01:50.574 - 01:01:53.482, Speaker D: And that is like a step change improvement.
01:01:53.626 - 01:02:27.290, Speaker C: Yeah, that's an important point. So just to maybe try to simplify that a little bit, like let's say Jason and I applied for a loan for blockworks and we're like, all right, we're going to use this loan, the proceeds of this loan, to fund a conference and hire more employees and get a nice fancy new office in New York. It would be like if we tried to spend those dollars for anything else, the vendor just couldn't do it. The dollar would disappear out of our hands except for the three things that we said we were going to use the loan. So that removes an entire dimension of risk and that makes for more capital efficient.
01:02:29.230 - 01:02:54.450, Speaker D: And so I think what you're going to see is that that's going to be reflected in financing rates on chain versus off chain. It's like ultimately as smart contract risk kind of approaches zero, you're going to be able to finance activities but just completely removing the credit risk component. Right, so borrowers are going to be able to borrow at lower rates and lenders are going to be able to take less risk.
01:02:55.830 - 01:03:01.000, Speaker A: Should that rate approach parity with like Treasuries or some other risk free rate then?
01:03:04.170 - 01:03:41.278, Speaker D: That's a good question. I think there's always going to be some amount of risk. Like you said, Sid, earlier in the conversation, right. With over collateralized, loans still carry risk because the collateral could just nuke to zero before you liquidate and then the borrower becomes insolvent. So there's still risk there. I'm not sure exactly where it should sort of be relative to US Treasuries or something like that. In general, I think it really just kind of comes down to supply and demand.
01:03:41.454 - 01:04:26.100, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just going to say it sounds similar to the on exchange margin products. I'm not sure where they price. I think they price kind of mid single digits. But it's effectively where if FTX can extend credit via margin that's partially collateralized to one of the market makers or one of the high frequency traders, they're still charged them an interest rate. But then the risk is that there is risk built in somewhere there that needs to be paid for, which would be that if you extend the credit to this shop and they go and trade on a Dex, if that Dex gets hacked, well, you're still going to suffer a loss. They could trade it, they only traded it in a permitted place. But there is still ultimately a loss that someone's on the hook for.
01:04:27.350 - 01:04:40.038, Speaker D: Yes, but I do think over time, and maybe this doesn't happen in the next year or two. But over time, smart contract risk goes to zero. I think that is going to be true.
01:04:40.124 - 01:05:30.374, Speaker C: Yeah. I've got one final closing question for you guys, just on the point that you brought up about. One of the things that interest rate swap markets do is they match preferences between borrowers and lenders. Sometimes in TradFi that actually works too well, right? Like it did in 2008 with basically, hey, there was an enormous amount of demand for home loans, right? And then what we actually had was mortgage backed securities where we ran out of inventory for good quality loans. So we took a bunch of bad ones and we kind of packaged them up and then sold them, and then made a whole bunch of derivative bets on those things. And we matched preferences, but it created kind of a speculative boom. So I guess the question is, most of the speculative booms in crypto have been driven from innovations in token distribution, equity financing type stuff.
01:05:30.374 - 01:06:11.090, Speaker C: Could be ICOs, could be yield farming, launch pads, NFTs, but these are all, how do I take tokens and give them to more people and more widely distribute them? And that has led to these big speculative manias. If this kind of stuff that we're talking about, if we really do unlock fixed rate lending and we bring in that type of speculator that's kind of required to make these sorts of transformations and we do match or we're lender preferences, it strikes me that could lead to an enormous financial unlock and a lot of activity, maybe even too much. So I guess the question that I have for you is, do you ever see debt financing or kind of what we're talking about as actually ever catalyzing or fueling a boom in crypto?
01:06:15.150 - 01:06:56.386, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, debt financing, I mean, the speculative bubble arises whenever there is more demand for risk than instruments to satisfy it. You get more complex instruments. If you look at tulip mania, the spot market for tulips was insufficient to meet the demand. So suddenly there were options and derivatives on future tulip harvests and those had their own price. And so that was because fundamentally you had appetite for risk exceeded the supply of the supply of assets that were available. So new ones were packaged and created. If you look at 2008, the demand for those instruments exceeded the quality of exceeded the supply of good quality ones.
01:06:56.386 - 01:08:25.146, Speaker A: So we took equity level tranches in RMBS or ABS. Basically you took the riskiest sliver of loans and then said, because we're putting together like a thousand different kinds of these very low quality bonds, if we package them together because they're non correlated, they actually act like a really high quality bond in a really simplified sense. So I think the key thing is that debt is neither inherently good nor inherently bad. It's a tool that can be used for productive purposes which is if you fund or give financing to a profitable business that can reinvest that to generate growth such that it's then a larger profitable business where debt is a detrimental tool is when it's used to fund speculation or the packaging and creation of risky derivatives and that kind of thing. But it's generally being used for a speculative purpose so it's leverage based on forming a view of the future price appreciation of something. So there's no doubt that that will occur at some point in the future for crypto capital markets just because that has been the history of all capital markets since the beginning of time. And I think what's important is that appetite for risk will increase and decrease over time with the market cycles.
01:08:25.146 - 01:09:03.140, Speaker A: But that when it does happen, you don't have conditions that would make it systemic. So you don't have a couple of exceptionally large players who are too big to fail such that if one of them goes under they would bring down the entire system. So you need to think about it in terms of a market structure where you don't have things like monopoly concentrations and you have the ability of the system to kind of withstand the occasional shock, which I think in. Today's sort of heavily regulated environment is often lost because we try and reduce volatility at the expense of longer term fragility of a system.
01:09:04.390 - 01:09:40.140, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's going to be the Dows borrowing against their governance tokens. I think that's what it's going to be. Just because I think everything it sounds really cool and it'll be really interesting and people are going to think it's awesome when it starts taking off, and then all these tokens are going to go rally and then be like, oh my God, I can borrow even more to earn even more yields. And then it's just going to be like a spiraling thing. And then, well, it all unwinds. So I could very easily see that.
01:09:43.170 - 01:09:53.490, Speaker B: Here I was thinking that we were going to have more stable booms and busts, that the booms would not be as drastic. But yeah, Teddy, you paint a picture of severe booms and busts in the future.
01:09:53.640 - 01:09:58.018, Speaker C: That's opportunity though honestly I just don't think you get one without the other.
01:09:58.104 - 01:09:58.980, Speaker B: No, you don't.
01:10:00.630 - 01:10:22.346, Speaker C: Stop. But the podcast called The Choir. They do like deep dives on and they did this one on Standard Oil, like a five hour in depth history of John B. Rockefeller and Standard Oil and the way they people should go back I'll put this in the freaking link of the podcast and listen to the description of what the oil industry was like back then. And yeah, there are a lot of.
01:10:22.368 - 01:10:23.130, Speaker A: Polos.
01:10:25.550 - 01:10:33.578, Speaker C: He solves it with price fixing. Yeah, I don't know. Lesson there is on that there were always subsidies. Yeah, exactly.
01:10:33.664 - 01:11:02.390, Speaker D: I feel like because I agree. I think that the boom and bust thing is just like if you want innovation and if you want all this stuff to happen. It's sort of like a necessary evil. And I feel like the reason why is that most people when it comes to taking financial risk, they are not willing to do it unless it feels like it's a sure thing. It feels that way to everybody and it's self reinforcing.
01:11:03.450 - 01:11:12.220, Speaker A: I think that's why what was Mark Twain saying? It's not what you don't know that gets you heard, it's what you know for sure that just ain't right.
01:11:13.470 - 01:11:15.770, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, exactly right.
01:11:15.920 - 01:11:31.360, Speaker C: It actually wasn't even Mark Twain that said that. Wasn't it Mark Twain apparently like 50% of things Mark Twain were said by him. He just got this reputation for saying a bunch of brilliant stuff. So whenever someone does it, I was like, Mark Price said it.
01:11:34.610 - 01:12:20.720, Speaker B: I know Mike said that was the last question. But I do want to just add I have one other question I can't let you guys drop before I ask this, which is about just like on chain credit scores actually. And I feel like I saw all these pitch decks at the end of last year of being like, all right, you can't have under collateralized lending without on chain reputations and on chain credit. And then what you saw is Ave launched Lens Protocol and everyone I feel like everyone was kind of like, all right, well, this is like decentralized social media but it's obviously a way to get at the under collateralized lending problem. I'm just curious if you guys think that that is a necessary thing for under collateralized lending or if you're like, yeah, don't really need it on chain credit is kind of overhyped. I'm just curious what you guys think of that whole space.
01:12:21.410 - 01:12:48.106, Speaker D: Yeah, personally I feel like a lot of the conversation around under collateralized lending goes back to what we talked about in the earlier part of this podcast where it's like people have a misunderstanding of what it actually means or it's sort of a misnomer. Right. Because uncollateralized or under collateralized lending in CFI is not actually uncollateralized but it.
01:12:48.128 - 01:12:54.426, Speaker C: Did used to be. Actually, Teddy, the whole personal guarantee thing is a relatively new phenomenon like the.
01:12:54.448 - 01:12:59.370, Speaker D: Last years I'm not familiar what do you mean by personal guarantee?
01:13:01.070 - 01:13:17.246, Speaker C: Because it is kind of uncollateralized lending if you consider if you don't have to personally guarantee the loan that you're getting and then you can go through a bankruptcy court right, to get that. So that is sometimes you can take advantage of assets that aren't really theoretically yours and they couldn't get repossessed.
01:13:17.278 - 01:14:57.874, Speaker D: Okay, I guess what I was going to say is that in general, unclateralized lending, it's collateralized by the legal recourse that you have in the event of default, that is collateral. Right? Yes. The borrower can go declare bankruptcy or there are things that can happen which means that you don't recoup what you're owed for sure. But the idea that you have no recourse or that legal recourse is just another you can think about that as that is your collateral, right. That requires a legal system which has authority to go take your stuff, right? It has the, you know, like authority to go garnish somebody's wages, right? And that doesn't exist on chain or like, you know, the the way to do that on chain is to have assets that sit in a smart contract and a protocol has access to those assets, right? I would just say I'm not sure if completely uncollateralized lending maybe a way that you can do it is this lens protocol where it's like if the guy doesn't repay, you can slash his social profile somehow. I can see that you can impose consequences, meaningful consequences. I don't know.
01:14:57.874 - 01:15:00.226, Speaker D: I think it's speculative still.
01:15:00.408 - 01:16:11.062, Speaker A: If I want to build a consumer lending protocol and start just doing consumer loans so I could do that, that's where I might want to use an on chain credit score. But what I either want is that on chain credit score has to be a better determinant of the person's ability to repay the loan than their FICO score. Or the on chain score needs to factor in off chain things like how much the person gets in their regular monthly wage, how much they typically spend, like those types of things, whether they own their house or not. So for a really good and useful on chain credit score, it either needs to have an oracle that pulls in these decisive facts about the borrower or that person needs to be conducting the bulk of their financial transactions, which includes all spending, all income generation on chain. That's where an on chain score is really useful. So it either needs to be complex enough that it's factoring in plaid FICO bank account scraping or the person needs to be on chain enough that I've got a pretty good picture within that score of their financial health. Then for it to work for me and be like value accretive for my business, I have to be doing this at scale.
01:16:11.062 - 01:17:11.546, Speaker A: So the reason an on chain score was so attractive was not because it made it easier for me to decide to lend to that person because I could get an email set of bank account statements, I could run a FICO score check manually. Where it was going to be really useful was if I wanted to write an algorithm that would write 1000 of these loans a minute, that's where you then start to get to scale economics. So you need a really large supply of capital and then you needed a way to produce those scores or have a really large market of people who would borrow using that score. So I think that it's just the size of the market is still too small at the moment. So you either need a bunch of people who are just receiving USDC salaries and who want to borrow or you need a really large supply of capital that's willing to finance a lending business that wants to run this. So I think it will happen in future. It's just the scale effect is not there yet.
01:17:11.728 - 01:17:22.980, Speaker C: All right, guys, this has been a ton of fun. We've taken enough of your time here, folks. Want to find out more about either of your two projects or just follow you online or whatever? What's the best way to do it?
01:17:23.750 - 01:17:35.382, Speaker A: Yeah. Twitter at. So I'm at syrupsid on Twitter, and then we are at Maple Finance. One word or you can go to Maple Finance online to find us.
01:17:35.516 - 01:17:35.954, Speaker B: Yep.

01:17:45.850 - 01:17:46.594, Speaker C: Sweet.
01:17:46.722 - 01:17:47.202, Speaker B: Sweet.
01:17:47.266 - 01:17:47.782, Speaker C: Awesome.
01:17:47.916 - 01:17:48.486, Speaker B: Thanks guys.
01:17:48.508 - 01:17:48.742, Speaker D: Thanks.
01:17:48.796 - 01:17:49.334, Speaker A: Appreciate it.
01:17:49.372 - 01:17:49.858, Speaker D: Thanks a lot.
01:17:49.884 - 01:17:50.490, Speaker A: Cheers.
01:17:51.950 - 01:17:53.466, Speaker C: All right, what do we think?
01:17:53.648 - 01:18:23.250, Speaker B: We think it was a good one. We think it was a good just first off, I really like Teddy and Sid. Just like two very smart minds and I think they've been really ahead know, I remember talking to Tedy two years ago, two and a half, three years ago about under collateralized lending and fixed rate loans. And I was like, oh man, like really small market this guy's going after. And here we are three years later and he seems to be probably pretty early on that trend. And I just think they're both really smart and I like the episode.
01:18:23.590 - 01:18:54.682, Speaker C: I think a couple key themes to pull out. One was a pretty interesting distinction Teddy made between that under collateralized lending is a little bit of a misnomer. And I think it's a really good point. We kind of got into it into the episode. But is there really such thing as unsecured or uncollateralized lending? Because basically I think he drew a really important distinction, which is all lending is really collateralized. Like when someone's giving you a loan, if you're on a personal basis or a company basis, they're doing it against something. So they have legal recourse if you don't pay your loan.
01:18:54.682 - 01:19:12.914, Speaker C: And they're usually looking at something. If it's a company, maybe it's your account. Receivables your history of generating cash flow, whatever your projections are, any assets that you might have on your balance sheet. If it's personal loan, they're probably looking at your FICO score and your history of credit. And usually you'd be doing it through your own bank. So they basically have access to your bank account. Right.
01:19:12.914 - 01:19:31.180, Speaker C: That's kind of a collateralized loan too. So I thought it was an interesting point that he made that the line between collateralized and uncollateralized loan isn't really so it's a little bit blurred. And really maybe the way to think about it is how can you be more capital efficient with the loans that you're making?
01:19:31.950 - 01:19:46.638, Speaker B: Yeah, that is a really good point. I mean, it's similar to what Alan brought up in the last episode about using governance tokens for collateral. Right. Is that collateralized? Is that uncollateralized? And I think there is this I.
01:19:46.644 - 01:19:52.286, Speaker C: Love that he came out and just called the top. He's like, yeah, it's going to be lending against governance tokens. Yeah, exactly.
01:19:52.468 - 01:19:54.654, Speaker B: At the very end of the show. Yeah, exactly.
01:19:54.772 - 01:20:33.078, Speaker C: I love that anyone did that. They collateralized. If you go back, one of the best documentaries ever is Smartest Guys in the Room. So good. Enron did so much stuff. But the reason why it unwound so quickly is they had all these off balance sheet vehicles, many of which were collateralized by Enron stock. So basically there's a death spiral effect that as soon as it looks like you aren't going to be able to repay on those debts, the value of the stock plummets, you go further out of covenant with your lenders and that's how everyone literally collapsed.
01:20:33.078 - 01:20:38.646, Speaker C: Exactly. For this reason. That's a spicy take from Teddy.
01:20:38.678 - 01:21:06.550, Speaker B: It was spicy. So we're halfway through the season, right? And I feel like there are some themes that keep coming up in the season and there are some themes that keep coming up that a lot of folks agree with and then some themes that come up that folks don't agree with. And I think one thing that I've noticed a lot of people agree is inevitable is just like Dows using debt. Right. That feels like a very agreed upon thing. I would say with every single person that we've brought on is Dows are going to leverage debt instead of just token, fundraising and equity in the next cycle.
01:21:06.890 - 01:21:44.290, Speaker C: Agreed. I think no one has really questioned the core premise because even though what we're talking about doesn't get a lot of airtime in crypto today, I don't think it's that wildly controversial. Right. We're talking about fixed rate lending coming to crypto. It makes sense to me that more especially as the level of borrower gets more and more sophisticated, there's just more demand to borrow at a fixed rate than there is a variable one. So I think no one's really questioned the core premise either. Maybe the thing that's always hard to get, and Teddy kind of got at this a little bit during the episode, she's timing all of this.
01:21:44.290 - 01:21:49.982, Speaker C: Like, when are we going to have product market fit for this? I think is probably still the biggest question I have at this point in the season.
01:21:50.046 - 01:22:45.480, Speaker B: I mean, didn't Teddy just nail one of the problem? Like one of the hardest things about being an entrepreneur and building anything is like you do have to take a very you have to form a belief and have a thesis, take a very concentrated bet and build the thing before it exists. Because if you build the thing that already for the market that's already here, then you're going to be too late. And I think honestly, both of these guys, Petty and Sid have done a good job at this with Notional and Maple, everyone agrees Dows are going to leverage debt. One thing that people maybe don't agree on or honestly I think people are still trying to figure out their belief on. It is like real world assets as the supply side of the lend and borrow. That seems like a theme that a lot of people are kind of noodling on and I feel like there's not a strong conviction across the board on whether or not people think that's a good idea, a bad idea. Like maybe a little bit of both.
01:22:46.490 - 01:22:52.138, Speaker C: If I had to guess at the consensus it's kind of like everyone's going to hold their nose and do it but nobody loves it.
01:22:52.224 - 01:22:56.410, Speaker B: That's what I think too. Yeah. Decent way to get through the bear.
01:22:56.750 - 01:23:41.942, Speaker C: Yeah, that's what I kind of think as well. I think it was interesting to hear both their approaches about doing everything on chain versus leveraging the legal system to the point that we were talking about. When you're doing uncollateralized lending it's not really uncollateralized even in real world uncollateralized unsecured lending, your collateral is the legal system that you're plugging into. Right. It's kind of like a L2 borrowing ETH security. When you're a company building in the real world you are borrowing the security property laws that exists in the United States and the court system and executive system to enforce all that kind of stuff. So it was interesting to hear their two approaches where Sid and Maple, they are leveraging the efficiency of on chain borrowing and lending.
01:23:41.942 - 01:24:12.500, Speaker C: And there's a certain amount of that occurs on chain. But ultimately, if there's a default, then the recourse is to go through the legal system, which it already exists. So there are kind of pros and cons to it. And then it looks like Teddy is trying to actually make it so that everything can occur on chain. And we're saying, hey, we don't actually need this legal system and we can actually build all this on chain. I am not smart enough to know which one of those two things is going to work. Frankly, I don't even know.
01:24:12.500 - 01:24:14.790, Speaker C: They probably don't have to be mutually exclusive.
01:24:15.850 - 01:24:21.414, Speaker B: Sid's market will be bigger in the short term. But I like where Teddy's going with.
01:24:21.452 - 01:25:06.366, Speaker C: Having everything on mean it's just hard to a threat. Initially the theme of this season was going to be on chain maximalism and moving to on chain infrastructure. But I think there's a pretty smart argument that you can make for. I can see the other extreme as well, which is on chain minimalism which is only putting very important or being more selective about the types of information that goes on chain and leveraging off chain as well. So I kind of think I'm not smart enough to know which one is going to end up playing out there. But I did think we started to get into at the very end of that interview, stuff that's possible in crypto and DeFi native credit. It's not possible in TradFi analog.
01:25:06.366 - 01:25:49.326, Speaker C: And I always think those ideas are interesting to explore. But this idea of yeah, like if you applied for a loan, if blockburgs you and I applied for a loan, we said, hey, we're going to spend the proceeds on X, Y and Z. The bank or the creditor is implicitly trusting you and I that we're going to be honest and that we're not going to blow it at clubs or vacations or whatever. And people do that. People do look at how some people spend PPP money. So what's interesting about crypto is that you don't even have to trust that you can program it into the loan that, hey, here's the loan, but you have to spend it at X, Y and Z otherwise the contract will not allow it to be spent. That does feel like an interesting innovation.
01:25:49.438 - 01:26:14.758, Speaker B: Yeah, that is really interesting. I like that. A know the last thing that was interesting then we can wrap this is in the roundup with Michael and Vance. We talked about how rates are now lower in crypto how rates are now lower in crypto than they are in TradFi and how that's a bad thing because it doesn't drive as many people into right. Like the rates used to pull people in. But Teddy brought up this good point. Or maybe it was Sid.
01:26:14.758 - 01:26:45.154, Speaker B: I forget who said this, but you could look at like, if you want to go get a mortgage today because the rates are so low. The rates are actually lower in DeFi. So that is like the pro side of that coin that we didn't talk about on the Roundup is like now you look at mortgage rates, they're above 6% today, that is astronomically high and it doesn't look like there's any signs of it slowing down or going back below six anytime soon. So, yeah, that's the other side of that coin of what could pull people in.
01:26:45.352 - 01:27:43.846, Speaker C: If I had to be determinedly positive about that headwind, what I would say is even when there was an enormous spread in between the yield you can earn in crypto versus the yield that Treasuries were giving you. I know I got a blowback when I voiced this on the roundup, but that spread, even a five percentage point spread didn't draw in a whole bunch of hedge funds and banks that was looking to capitalize on that because the career risk that was associating with getting yield from smart contracts was still too high. So I kind of think people in crypto are very creative and you're already starting to see another use case emerge from yields in TradFi being higher, which is importing TradFi yields. So leveraging the balance sheet of big smart contracts like maker to earn yield that's available in TradFi and people are creative. I bet there will be yeah, I hadn't even thought about borrowing against your crypto assets to get a mortgage because rates are really high. You just kind of never know how these things are going to shake out.
01:27:43.948 - 01:27:44.770, Speaker B: Agreed.
01:27:44.930 - 01:27:45.398, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:27:45.484 - 01:28:10.850, Speaker B: Who do we have next? We have on chain derivatives and liquidity with zeta and friction. Oh, this will be really interesting. That'll be a great episode. And then after that, the last two episodes of the season, we've got Ben Foreman talking about who are the borrowers? Right? Ben started ParaFi and then we've got Stannie and then a surprise guest coming up as well. So talking about DeFi in the next bull cycle. So that'll be really good way to end it.
01:28:10.880 - 01:28:11.410, Speaker A: Want.
01:28:11.560 - 01:28:12.670, Speaker C: Yeah, agreed.
01:28:12.750 - 01:28:13.042, Speaker B: Great.
01:28:13.096 - 01:28:14.770, Speaker C: All right, buddy, we'll see you next time.
01:28:14.840 - 01:28:15.630, Speaker B: See you next time, folks.
