00:00:00.090 - 00:00:21.934, Speaker A: Where I just disagree is this attitude that I feel like this is the third time I've seen it out in force. Like it's only going to be bitcoin. Like bitcoin is the thing that's going to cross the chasm. And none of this other stuff is, I've just seen that disproven so many times. I think the other thing that people always underestimate is like, okay, I miss bitcoin. What's next? What's the next bitcoin? And that driver for investors is so.
00:00:21.972 - 00:00:35.638, Speaker B: Powerful, every single market happens the same way. It starts with bitcoin and then it goes to ethereum or alt layer ones and then it goes to altcoins. It's happening the same time. This time around. It's just we're at bitcoin right now.
00:00:35.724 - 00:01:06.622, Speaker A: Hey everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Salana, sui, ethereum, L2s and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve NFTs which you can get and mint for free.
00:01:06.622 - 00:01:26.262, Speaker A: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. Alright guys, on with the show. Hi everyone. This episode is brought to you by swell, a team leading the restaking future with their liquid restaking token Rsweep. Now I've talked about liquid restaking on this program before. I think it is going to be a massive tectonic shift for Ethereum and I am super, super excited about it. And I like the swell team a lot.
00:01:26.262 - 00:01:46.570, Speaker A: Goes without saying, do your own research. This is not financial advice. You guys all know the drill. Again, I like this team. And if you stick around, I'm going to describe how you can restake your ETH in swell, earn pearls, eigen layer points, and a whole bunch of future rewards. So thank you very much for swell, for making this episode impossible. Hey everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, Flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator.
00:01:46.570 - 00:02:26.042, Speaker A: Now, if you are a listener of Bell Curve, you know that MeV is a massive problem, which is why we are so pumped to partner up with Flood on this season. Flood is the only gasless and MeV free aggregator that not only gets you the best execution, but also gives you back all the extra surplus that you create every single time you swap. Now this is relevant for both swappers and developers, but you're going to be hearing all about them later in the program. So for now, thank you Flood and back to the shout. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with.
00:02:26.042 - 00:02:34.206, Speaker A: Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal or other advice. You know the deal.
00:02:34.308 - 00:02:36.190, Speaker C: Now let's jump into the episode.
00:02:38.130 - 00:02:50.334, Speaker A: All right everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. We got Michael's one and two in Vance. Fellas, how are we doing? I think my cup of coffee is bigger than Michael's. We've had big. Yeah, well, I've got the double load.
00:02:50.382 - 00:02:53.742, Speaker B: I've got this guy and the cup.
00:02:53.886 - 00:02:56.194, Speaker C: Yeah, I had a sleepover this week.
00:02:56.232 - 00:02:57.670, Speaker A: I was staying at his house for a while.
00:02:57.740 - 00:02:58.870, Speaker C: It was pretty funny.
00:03:00.570 - 00:03:04.134, Speaker A: That's really wholesome, guys. That's the type of wholesome content that people come to bell curve for.
00:03:04.172 - 00:03:14.860, Speaker C: Wholesome stuff. Just drinking beers, having some, eating chicken. It's been a big week.
00:03:15.230 - 00:03:41.090, Speaker A: Been a big week. We got Dankoon. So happy Dankoon day to everyone out there who is celebrating. Dankoon is the hard fork that we've all been talking about for some time now. There are a whole bunch of different improvements that ended up getting lumped in and passed there. But 4844 proto Dank sharding was the biggest one and we're just talking a little bit off air about what everyone has been very laser focused on is what fees are going to do on L two s and it looks like.
00:03:41.240 - 00:03:43.058, Speaker B: Fees are sub $0.01 now.
00:03:43.224 - 00:03:46.180, Speaker A: So what do you guys think of Dankoon in general?
00:03:49.050 - 00:04:16.542, Speaker B: Great accomplishment. I think this is the biggest hard fork since the merge. So a massive upgrade seemed to have gone swimmingly just in terms of the actual process of upgrading itself. Jesse Pollock talks about how his goal for base is to be able to have 1 second transaction time and less than $0.01 cost. It seems like they're already there in terms of cost, at least from what I've seen. A lot of the transactions that are happening on base are less than $0.01.
00:04:16.542 - 00:04:42.546, Speaker B: Optimism. The same thing. I think arbitrary launches later today. Or maybe it was last night. But basically, all of the L two s are implementing this new concept called blobs. Blobs become a new type of block space where you're basically putting together all of the transaction data, all of everything that's happening on the L two s, and submitting that for settlement on l one. And that process is just a lot cheaper.
00:04:42.546 - 00:05:32.914, Speaker B: So I think there's a ton of things to talk about here. Obviously, from a user perspective, this is the cost that we've been looking for. And from kind of an l two perspective, I think there's a lot of opportunity for them to start to build business models around. Where do the fees go? How do the fees aggregate to the sequencer? What's the business model of the sequencer? So now that this has happened, I think we can kind of move in that direction. And we know of a number of different l two s or networks that are working on building their own l two s that have been waiting for dancun to go in so that they can finally launch their l two at a not cost prohibitive level. So I would imagine that now is sort of the opening of the gates of a bunch of new l two s that are going to be launching and scaling and building. So I think it's a great accomplishment.
00:05:32.914 - 00:05:36.600, Speaker B: Hats off to everybody that built it and excited to see where it goes.
00:05:37.130 - 00:06:15.586, Speaker C: Yes, I think the biggest thing, relatively, to the rest of the chains is now fees being cheap is not a differentiator. If it's a cent per transaction, I think it takes some wind out of the sails of, like, meme coins can only happen on chains that are outside of ETH now. It's kind of like all of the l two s are eligible for that. And keep in mind, the biggest meme coins are still on ETH L1. So I think there is some shifting of the landscape of what people compete on. And every l two that we talk to has a meme coin strategy. So these meme coins are pretty easy to create.
00:06:15.586 - 00:06:42.480, Speaker C: Obviously, there's no app behind it that's like the point of a meme coin. But all of these l two s are now going to have meme coins, whether they be cat coins or dog coins or hat coins or whatever. So I think you'll see that shift in the near term. But I just think now you can't compete on low fees. Like, if someone's like, no, our fees are like zero, yours are only 0.1 cents. It's like, that doesn't really make much sense.
00:06:42.480 - 00:07:05.730, Speaker C: So positive for ETH I also think just like credibility and promises made, promises kept in terms of this has been coming for, I think, a year, maybe more, and it's just good to see it finally ship. I don't know what the next hard fork is, but it feels like this is probably the most impactful one that we're going to have for at least the next year for users.
00:07:07.830 - 00:07:43.086, Speaker A: I saw someone tweet this, something along the lines of, you just have to give it up for the ETH core devs here. First of all, any one of these people that are this deeply involved in actually shipping this, they could go raise $50 million tomorrow with a billion dollar valuation, probably make a bunch of money, but they're just like, true believers actually care about the cause, and they built the plane in mid flight. It's just a really difficult thing to do. There's not like a great analog for it, even in traditional tech. So I just think it's a massive accomplishment and shout out to all the ethcor devs working on this, to be honest.
00:07:43.188 - 00:08:36.210, Speaker C: The other thing I'll say is it kind of reminds me of when maker jacked up interest rates and people were like, ooh, this is really bearish, maker. And I was just looking at it like, this is just going to moon revenue to like 600, $700 million a year. And I think the same thing is happening with Denkun where people are like, yeah, it shipped, like sell the news, but really what's going to be material is all these new, I guess, like meme coins and apps that are coming to these l two s and all these new l two s that are launching. To Michael's point, there's probably 1000 l two s that are going to come out of the gate in the next year. That is the most frequent pitch that we see is we're building a new l two. And I think it's getting kind of hard to tell them apart, but just the quantity of them is pretty positive for what's going to happen because these l two people are not the same type of people that would be building protocols on ETH L1. So it's not like cannibalistic, it's just like net new ads.
00:08:38.150 - 00:09:10.314, Speaker B: Yeah. Just to basically say the exact same thing in a different way. Every single time that we see fees get cut, the per transaction fees get cut, what you actually see is amount of fees times number of transactions equals protocol revenue. You see the drop in fees per transaction, you actually see a larger increase in total number of transactions. That ultimately increases the average amount of revenue that's flowing to that protocol. I think this is going to be the exact same thing. The left of the bell curve take is.
00:09:10.314 - 00:09:29.650, Speaker B: Or maybe the mid curve take is fees go down, revenue goes down. Actually I think it's the complete opposite. And we've seen this multiple times before where as you reduce fees it opens up new opportunities for new types of transactions that weren't possible before, which far surpasses the drop in per transaction costs. And so revenue we would expect to increase.
00:09:30.310 - 00:09:53.420, Speaker A: I am on that page too. Well, what do you guys say? I did see a little bit of pushback on the timeline about. We don't really know what the new clearing price for transaction on L two s is going to be like. A lot of the l two s haven't implemented dencun yet. So basically it's probably going to be a little bit higher than what it ultimately is today. What do you guys think about some of that pushback on the current reduction in fees that we saw?
00:09:54.110 - 00:10:33.362, Speaker C: Probably true. I think the fees are probably going to trend to be ten cents to one cent. The subscent ones are maybe kind of like in lower gas periods. Like east is still l one at least is 86 quay. So a lot of the block space at least is being occupied by just like a lot of price movement on L1 and flows being pushed back and forth through uniswap. But I think ten cents to one cent is probably the right way to think about this. But in my mind that is enough for developers.
00:10:33.362 - 00:10:50.940, Speaker C: I think where my benchmark is at least is can developers subsidize activity for users? And I think that's in the range that they can. And it might be a couple hundred thousand dollars a year. But if you want to fully abstract gas away like what IMX is doing, you're now there, you can do it.
00:10:51.950 - 00:11:33.258, Speaker A: I think also in addition to Dankun, just the point about not competing on the basis of fees anymore is right. Because one, there's going to be these like proto Dank sharding eventually full dank sharding. But also I think l two s are going to start to experiment and push the limits in terms of on the computing and execution that they're designing to their. There's a whole bunch of. I'm sure you guys have probably seen some of these new l two s that are launching right now. And a lot of them that I've seen are kind of like skipping to the end here and just they're settling down to ETH but they're decently centralized decently beefy in terms of the hardware requirements and they're going to be super fast and super cheap. And they're probably positioning against kind of like the monads of the world, I think, that are launching soon.
00:11:33.258 - 00:11:38.250, Speaker A: So it's kind of like you're getting fee reductions from two different angles here, if that makes sense.
00:11:38.400 - 00:12:18.166, Speaker C: Yes, and things like bear chain, the monads and the bear chains of the world are like. I would say they're kind of different in the sense that they're a philosophical challenge to the other L1s. That's kind of what the Alt L1 trade is. It's like you did it this way, but what if you did it this way and this is a whole different paradigm, allegedly. I think there is some truth to that though. I think with the L two S and generally the L1s as well, it's like, okay, you launch the L1, you launch the L two, you get fees to be cheap, you build out all the D five primitives, you build out a couple of NFT collections, you build out a couple of meme coins. Then what? And I think we're kind of getting to that.
00:12:18.166 - 00:13:17.580, Speaker C: Then what point where if here's a chain like immutable X and you have 300, 400 games launching on you, you've taken it to a different level of competition where these other chains can't just slap together a uniswap competitor and launch it and call it a d five ecosystem. It takes a lot of effort to get to where immutable X is a lot of capital, a lot of software that is not entirely blockchain related. That's where we think things are going. We also think things are just like extremely bullish in all regards and you're probably not going to have this realization of fundamental value for the next few months. But this year is the year where all these games launch and when we get to the next generation of applications. And I think it's going to be hard if you don't have a unique differentiator. Like if forecaster has an L two and lens has an L two and social really takes off, are you really going to be able to compete with social either? How hard is that? It's probably pretty hard.
00:13:18.430 - 00:13:59.000, Speaker A: I think that's a really good point. And I don't know, there was a period a little while ago where I feel like people, some of the chains, like some of the L1s that never really found product market fit or they relaunched as an L two trying to buy into this narrative. And I think you're probably seeing that already early stages of that in the restaking world with Avss, like, hey, everyone's saying it's about economic security, but maybe really what you're actually doing is plugging into this sexy narrative around restaking and abs, all that kind of stuff, and maybe that can work for a little bit. But Vance, I agree with you that I think you got to have something distinguishing other than just like really cheap, because everyone's going to have that if they don't already.
00:13:59.450 - 00:14:12.480, Speaker B: And on the AbS point, someone's going to be able to be the first Abs, but everybody after that is going to be the second, the third, the fourth. You're not going to be able to ride on that distribution channel as being your core differentiator for a very long time.
00:14:13.170 - 00:14:57.754, Speaker C: Yeah, even the l two s now are kind of like we're doing SVM. We're settling to select sole ethlestia or whatever that is. They're trying to mount this philosophical challenge, for me at least, that falls a little flat, because for the Alt L1s, what they have is their own native asset. They also have all the MEV that happens on that chain, and that is like kind of this economic amplifier. And so I think it's going to be hard for the l two s to mount, like philosophical challenges. I think they're going to have to mount basically, like application challenges. And I think it's going to be pretty obvious when I think this is the year that our gaming thesis is starting to play out.
00:14:57.754 - 00:15:20.020, Speaker C: Like Pixels had a million monthly active users, maybe 25% of that is bots. But when one chain has 10 million monthly actives in a few months, and it's a gaming chain, and all these other l two s are like, they've got the fifth, like Trader Joe clone on them, you're going to be able to tell. And I think we're getting to that. Then what point, pretty quickly.
00:15:21.430 - 00:15:49.962, Speaker A: Well, to your point. So what I would love to see know for a long time, people are like, this is the most common take ever, right? We have too much infrastructure, not enough apps. But I think there was really good reason for that. There has been cheap block space, but there was always cheap block space on these kind of shitty chains that you didn't want to be on for the most part. Now you actually have cheap block space on l two s that settle to ethereum or Salana or whatever. There's lots of good chains. Platform risk is less than it used to be.
00:15:49.962 - 00:16:09.060, Speaker A: Or at least there are ways that you can launch on cheap block space. Where you aren't taking an enormous amount of platform risk. So maybe this will be the cycle where people kind of wake up and realize like, hey, some of these roadblocks that used to exist around on the infrastructure side of things don't exist anymore. Maybe we should be building apps now. You can hope.
00:16:09.670 - 00:16:31.914, Speaker C: I mean, I think so. I think also we play the very long game, as do you guys, where our fund is a ten year lifecycle. So we have time. And I just find it hard to believe that if you forecast out ten years, it's going to be just this infrastructure thing and you kind of got to skate to where the puck is going.
00:16:31.952 - 00:16:32.826, Speaker B: And I think what we do well.
00:16:32.848 - 00:16:50.910, Speaker C: Is we invest with conviction and then we just camp out. We just post up for even years. Like Chainlink took years. Many of these things take years. Maker obviously has taken years. Endgame was announced two years ago to the day today. That's pretty wild.
00:16:52.690 - 00:17:18.860, Speaker B: The other thing I'll say, just in terms of putting a bow on it, Vance already mentioned this, but just to push it forward, the biggest impediment to growth from a consumer adoption perspective is gas. And if you are able to abstract away the gas for users in a way that a lot of the applications that we've seen scale and grow, et cetera, et cetera, that is going to be the biggest growth vector possible. And so it's not necessarily about.
00:17:22.030 - 00:17:22.346, Speaker C: What.
00:17:22.368 - 00:17:49.090, Speaker B: Fraction of a dollar is your actual gas fees. The question is, is it low enough and is there enough usage and revenue for that application to pay the gas on behalf of the users? And if yes, then it's going to be a scalable application, sign up with a username password, email password, and never have to even think about the blockchain for 95% of the users that are on it. And so that's where I think Dantun actually is approaching that level for a lot of applications.
00:17:50.390 - 00:18:26.000, Speaker C: I posted a joke about like, we've lowered gas costs to zero one cents, but what about people who can only afford zero one cents? It's like maybe those aren't exactly the right number. Everyone's trying to ratio me into replies for these people have mental illnesses. But my point is, you reach a point of diminishing marginal returns on costs going lower. Like, I'm sure we could figure out a blockchain construction where it's free. That wouldn't open up the market much more than it being practically free, and we're kind of there.
00:18:27.010 - 00:18:49.380, Speaker A: I agree. Call to action for new builders out there. Look at applications that would be awesome. Maybe we can. I know you guys are bringing up maker a little bit. Maybe we could transition to that, because one of the things our analysts were talking about this week is the raise. So the DSR, the die savings rate that got raised to 15%.
00:18:49.380 - 00:19:19.280, Speaker A: I saw some speculation on Twitter that this might have been a little bit of a response to Athena and the rates that they're paying out. So Athena, is this like they were a stable coin, now? They're not a stable coin. They're a vault that offers you basically delta hedged exposure to the price of to borrow ETH, for the most part. So I saw some speculation that maybe there's a little bit of competition there. How do you guys interpret the raise on the die savings rate, the maker side of things?
00:19:20.050 - 00:19:21.600, Speaker C: On the Athena side.
00:19:23.590 - 00:19:24.098, Speaker A: You'Re going to.
00:19:24.104 - 00:20:25.380, Speaker C: Be able to borrow against ESUSD on Spark, and the rate for that will be effectively what Athena is yielding to borrow minus maybe a percent or something to make it economical for the person who's doing the borrowing. So, I mean, this is kind of what maker has always done in bull runs, is there's just some amazing new yield farming offering 200% APY, and you basically offer dive borrow against that. And what that allows maker to do is capture all of that yield. And in the current endgame paradigm, what that is used for is buying back the maker token. And so, just to go over the broader kind of interest rate raise, interest rates spiked all across crypto and DFI. So this wasn't in my mind, like an emergency raise for any reason. It was like Ave rates are 20% to 30%, and Maker borrow was like six.
00:20:25.380 - 00:21:52.414, Speaker C: So when you have that, what people are going to do is they're going to borrow die, they're going to swap to USDC, they're going to put in nave, and you have all the economics going to the people who are doing this carry trade, and only 6% of the 25% going to maker, which is like, not what Maker wants. Maker wants to capture as much economics as possible, at the same time giving people some sort of small spread to incentivize them to borrow. So that's kind of the general perspective of why maker would raise interest rates. And Maker is going to have this really interesting thing where it's t bills in the bear, crypto denominated loans in the bull, and when perp rates spike, and perp rates are not going to spike forever, and there's only a limited amount of capacity for this trade, you can put it in perp what they're trying to do, and this is in the rune doc that he just posted, is like seamless transition from T bills to crypto lending to perps. You kind of have this holy trinity of yield. And outside of this, the main thing that happened this week was rune posted the long awaited update on Endgame. And when things are launching and he gave a timeline and it's this, you know, the headlines of this are there's going to be a new brand reveal in probably June or may that will last a month.
00:21:52.414 - 00:22:34.090, Speaker C: Then you will be able to farm the new Dai token and you will be rewarded with maker inflation, but also spark inflation. And so it's going to be like this super high yielding kind of yield farm that will drive additional demand and then you're going to have esusd as well. And so I think, I'm looking at the maker website. This is lower than what we think it is. They believe that they have around 200 million of annual profits. We would probably put this closer to like 300, but that's just going to keep going up. And why we bought all of our maker, I forget, maybe a year and a half ago was we thought it would get to a billion in earnings this cycle.
00:22:34.090 - 00:23:05.990, Speaker C: And I think it's going to get there, and I think it's going to get there this year. And if you have a billion of earnings buying back a token that's worth 2.3 billion, that's pretty crazy. And I think you're going to have this virtuous cycle where the yield from perps, the end game inflation, all of the above is just going to absolutely make this. It is the number two earnings producing app in crypto behind Ethereum. It's worth $2.2 billion.
00:23:05.990 - 00:23:11.930, Speaker C: So obviously we can't express bullish or bearish opinions here, but we're not selling our maker.
00:23:13.070 - 00:23:15.050, Speaker B: Yeah, not financial advice.
00:23:16.350 - 00:23:37.058, Speaker A: Not financial advice. Corner. These stats, if you're following along via video, are looking at the TVL revenue and token price of maker in charts. And yeah, it's funny, people always say that crypto doesn't trade on fundamentals. For the most part, I think that's true. But, I mean, there's a certain amount of sense. This chart makes a certain amount of sense.
00:23:37.058 - 00:23:48.786, Speaker A: And it actually kind of looks like maker is trading on something. It looks like fundamentals. And just a massive. Is that jump in revenue, is that associated with the. That's the DSR hike, right? Or.
00:23:48.808 - 00:23:52.138, Speaker B: No, that's the interest rate hike.
00:23:52.254 - 00:23:53.350, Speaker A: Interest rate hike, yeah.
00:23:53.420 - 00:24:45.240, Speaker C: The other part of this is that the DSR has been raised to 15%, right, which is pretty interesting given that the fed funds rate is at 5.5%. So you're naturally incentivizing people to take USDC buy die. They'll do that through the PSM. That USDC stays in the PSM, which is liquidity for shorting the perp on Athena or crypto denominated loans or really whatever. But you kind of are entering into this virtuous cycle where I think we're going to see the DSR probably drain and move into these endgame farms, and that'll also increase. Mean, like, I think fundamentals don't matter in crypto until they're buybacks. I think that's kind of where I've netted out.
00:24:45.240 - 00:25:10.750, Speaker C: TVL was a meme. Even revenue, frankly, might be a meme. But when you have fundamentals manifesting right now it's 200 million of buybacks. We think that's going to go to 500 to a billion of buybacks this cycle. Something has to give. It's the same thing as the bitcoin ETFs, where like Blackrock is trying to buy all these coins up every single day, but it's one 100th the scale of bitcoin.
00:25:12.370 - 00:25:54.030, Speaker B: Yeah, things I'd add to that are this cycle, it feels like profitable DFI is going to be the thing that takes over the defi narratives. And we're starting to see know, I think the governance proposal ultimately didn't pass, but you saw the movement on the uniswap side wanting to implement that fee switch that flows to the treasury, to the Dow foundation. You're starting to see this as a recognition amongst a number of other protocols that are D five blue chips or OG DFI 1.0 type protocols. But profitable DFI that deliver value back to the token holders is going to be the narrative for DFI this cycle.
00:25:54.850 - 00:26:40.410, Speaker C: And frankly, institutions, institutions, I guess, do have that killer instinct of whatever has momentum we should buy. The downside of that is when it works against you, you just look like a fucking idiot and you might get fired. But if you have this institutional, fundamentally driven bullcase and you can always point to these numbers, you probably get to keep your job if it retraces. And so I think these are going to be the natural home for a lot of things. I also think the circle IPO. I haven't heard what the update is on that recently, but that will be in the background of. I'll be interested to see what the circle financials are, but my guess is that maker might be more profitable than circle.
00:26:42.110 - 00:27:21.500, Speaker A: Do you have a sort of mental model for how you think about the market cap of stablecoins? I've just sort of noticed that it looked like advance. I think I saw you tweeting about this a little while ago, but it looked like the USDC market cap bottomed back in around November of last year. And it's been sort of looks like it's recovering. Tether people have sort of been following the financials of that business. It looks phenomenal. That is just like a one way up only chart. Do you guys have a sort of mental model for how people should view the market cap of stablecoins just within the context of where we are in the cycle and what people are using it for? What's driving that?
00:27:27.790 - 00:28:15.078, Speaker C: As we kind of talked about earlier, there is a shortage of dollars in crypto and that manifests in the perp rates and it manifests in the lending rates of AAVE. And stablecoins will grow as people take advantage of that opportunity. And I think that is frankly more tether than USDC. USDC. One of the things you need to realize about stablecoins is that they have these massive market maker incentive programs. And basically what that deal is, is like market maker X puts stablecoins on exchange Y and as a part of holding it there and providing that as collateral, they earn some sort of yield. Pass through that the stablecoin issuer has gotten from investing those stablecoin T bills.
00:28:15.078 - 00:28:56.886, Speaker C: And so there are kind of like these levers that the stablecoins themselves, the decentralized ones at least, can pull to kind of bottom their supply. It's just like market maker incentives. But at the same time, it's hard to deny that some of this growth, at least on the USDC side, is organic as well, because you've seen a lot of stablecoin inflows into these defi and lending protocols to take advantage of these rates. So it's kind of hard to say. I think USDC has gone up by like 6 billion from the bottom, from like 24 to 30. I think tether, this chart looks good. Doesn't look amazing.
00:28:57.068 - 00:28:58.826, Speaker A: Yeah, it doesn't look amazing, to be honest.
00:28:58.928 - 00:29:01.750, Speaker C: The tether chart looks like incredible.
00:29:01.910 - 00:29:03.420, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree.
00:29:09.230 - 00:29:23.666, Speaker C: Yeah. This thing is absolutely just cooking. That is incredible looking chart. If that was a coin, you would buy that. If there was a non stable coin coin, you'd buy that.
00:29:23.768 - 00:29:27.730, Speaker A: That's geobodin. That's geobodin level charts.
00:29:29.350 - 00:29:33.730, Speaker C: But yeah, I think generally we're seeing capital inflows.
00:29:35.590 - 00:30:09.230, Speaker B: It becomes financial gravity when you have the ability to earn yield in excess of what you'd be able to get outside of the crypto space. And now you can do that at scale. I mean, Athena is, at last I checked, 65%. Obviously not the most scalable. It's got almost a billion of TVL, but you're going to be able to borrow and lend in ways like Ave Ave. I think lending was at 25% and that is actually still very scalable. I mean, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars of capacity at 20% plus.
00:30:09.380 - 00:30:41.942, Speaker A: Hey everyone, wanted to give a quick shout out to the title sponsor of this season of Bell Curve, the wormhole foundation. Now, if you are an on chain user, which I bet you are, if you're listening to Bell Curve, you know that the cross chain experience in crypto still sucks. Let's just call it spade a spade. We talk about it on this program all the time. Interop is still a big problem, which is why we specifically wanted to team up with the wormhole foundation. They are a decentralized interop platform that powers multi chain applications and bridges. So that could be anything from Defi to NFTs, governance, oracles and more.
00:30:41.942 - 00:31:13.710, Speaker A: So if you are a developer and you're building cross chain assets, apps or data or anything like that, I highly recommend that you click the link at the bottom of this episode and go check out to see what you can build on wormhole and wormhole. First of all, this is a fun team. They did something really cool with us. You can actually go and click the link at the bottom of the screen, which is going to send you to a landing page where you can claim your own unique wormhole NFT. So we're doing this with me, and we're doing this with Jason, my co founder. So help a brother out. It's a super cool NFT, I promise.
00:31:13.710 - 00:31:45.006, Speaker A: Go click the link at the bottom of this episode and fill out your poap. Get your free NFT. And if you're a dev, head over to wormhole and check out to see what cool cross chain stuff you can build. Hey everyone, this episode is brought to you by swell, a liquid restaking protocol and the issuer of the R suite, liquid restaking token. Now, if you're a listener of Bell curve, you know that I am just so fascinated by restaking and liquid restaking. I think it is going to be one of the most important trends in Ethereum. And I am really excited for the benefit that it unlocks both users and also Ethereum, the protocol itself.
00:31:45.006 - 00:32:09.042, Speaker A: Now disclaimer, whenever there's yield involved in a product, do your own research. This is not financial advice. You guys know the drill. But swell is a great team. They have a non custodial product and they are mission driven on giving you the best liquid staking experience. If you take one benefit away from using liquid restaking, make it be capital efficiency. Now you can earn passive yield from Ethereum, you can earn yield from multiple actively validated services that stack on top of that.
00:32:09.042 - 00:32:30.118, Speaker A: And then you can still use rsweep as collateral in defi. And because I know y'all are a bunch of dgens, there's a points angle here as well. But in swell we call them pearls. So pearls equal points. And if you stake your ETH with swell, you can earn pearls and future Eigen layer rewards. When there is a token generation event, you can swap your pearls or swell tokens. Head over, click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:32:30.118 - 00:32:52.622, Speaker A: Again, just pause what you're doing right now. Go click the link at the bottom of this episode. Check out swell. Thank you. Later. Hey everyone, want to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, Flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator. Now, Flood is the perfect partner for this episode on the multi chain future because Flood is solving so many of the issues that we're going to be talking about this season and this is relevant for both traders and devs.
00:32:52.622 - 00:33:20.554, Speaker A: So if you are a trader, you should definitely head over to Floodswap and start trading because they solve three massive problems. One, gasless trading, no more pesky trading fees. Two, you don't have to worry about getting front run MeV free. And then three, they have excellent order routing so that you know that you are getting the best price. So head over to Floodswap and click the link in the bottom of the show notes. We're going to send you right there. For the devs out there you can leverage Flood's flexible hooks, allowing you to make swapping a first class primitive by adding custom order types like t waps.
00:33:20.554 - 00:33:57.078, Speaker A: Or if you're a wallet builder or something like that, you can actually build your own order flow auction in and start recapturing a bunch of that MEP. If you want to reach out to them, go to devs at Flood bid or just jump right in the discord. All right guys, thanks very much. Appreciate you flood, want to get your guys or maybe talk a little bit about Jito here for a second as well. So just as a disclaimer, I've actually got a small bag of Jito myself. I've been a Lucas, buffalo and Jito Stan for a long time. They had a pretty big announcement this week that they ended the mempool function.
00:33:57.078 - 00:34:27.422, Speaker A: So, as a reminder, Jito actually started as an MEV product. Pretty sure they actually started with mempools, and then they bolted on a liquid staking product there. There's a really interesting intersection between MeV and liquid staking that we actually did an entire podcast on. I go back and listen to an old bell curve with Lucas and Xavier, who's the ex CIO at course. One. But the reason that they stopped doing it was. So one of the differences between Solana and Ethereum is that there's no mempool in Solana.
00:34:27.422 - 00:34:57.734, Speaker A: Transactions just automatically get broadcast to the leader. Block times are much, much shorter. The whole protocol is kind of optimized around making shorter and shorter block times. You get four blocks as the leader in Solana, you kind of build those continuously, and then that's it. What Jeto was doing is they had this sort of private mempool that could run as a sidecar with Salana validators, and it extended the latency by about 200 milliseconds. But it acted like a mem pool does in Ethereum.
00:34:57.782 - 00:34:57.994, Speaker C: Right?
00:34:58.032 - 00:35:38.570, Speaker A: So, in Ethereum, there's a public mem pool. I mean, it's less relevant today than it used to be. There's a lot of sorts of private order flow, but every transaction sort of gets submitted to this public mempool different. It's really builders today that will build these blocks that are optimized for the amount of MeV that you can extract, that gets passed on through relays to a proposer. The downside of that is that there's obviously been a lot of, to be honest, like memecoin and shitcoin trading on Solana. A lot of it happens through these telegram bots with retail users that don't understand slippage and stuff like that. And what was starting to happen in these jet mem pools was that users were just getting sandwiched to death.
00:35:38.570 - 00:36:50.160, Speaker A: And because fees are so much lower in Solana, actually the amount that you can get sandwiched is even worse than it is in Ethereum, because fees are high on ETH main chain. And so there's some sort of calculation for searchers and builders over there, where if it's under this amount, then it's not really worth it for me to sandwich you anyway, because you got to do a front run and a back run with Solana, because the fees are so cheap, the incentive is just spam and try to get that front and back run slot and you can actually do it with much more specificity, which just means that the users are getting sandwiched all that much. Yeah. Which is kind of. So honestly, the team at Jito had to make a really difficult decision, like, do I do this for the good of the network and stop this? Because it was 100% going to be a cash cow for them. And they made the really bold, I think, very forward looking choice to not do that. I don't know, just as a founder, that's such a difficult thing to look at this exploding product line that you have and just say, I don't think this is a net good for the entire network, and shut it down.
00:36:50.160 - 00:37:08.534, Speaker A: That takes balls of steel and a lot of conviction and a really long time frame and long time horizon on your company and your brand. So, yeah, I just respect it. Mean, I know you guys are investors in Jito as well, but I respect it.
00:37:08.732 - 00:38:00.200, Speaker C: We also have jeto bags. I think of them as the canonical Salana project, just like an extension of Tolly and the foundation. And Kyle is also an investor from Multicoin, so they're so ecosystem aligned. And frankly, they chewed glass when Solana was $8, and now it's at $170, and they're kind of still doing the same thing, and they're doing what's best for the network, which is very different than what's best for ETH. It's a different kind of scenario. I also think the other part of this is what they've built is so technically complex that obviously someone else could build a way to kind of reintegrate sandwiches, and maybe they will, but at this point, Jito is the largest liquid staking protocol on Solana, and they're growing like a weed. So there's just like a virtuous cycle that's at play here.
00:38:00.200 - 00:38:07.010, Speaker C: And, yeah, I wouldn't expect those guys to do anything different, honestly.
00:38:07.170 - 00:38:07.880, Speaker B: Right.
00:38:08.490 - 00:38:34.826, Speaker A: Here's why I find this super interesting as well, just from an experiment. One of the reasons why I like that there are multiple chains outside of just Ethereum is it's kind of like run every experiment. And the philosophical attitude on ETH around MeV, like Mev, is probably the thorniest problem in all of crypto. Right. It's just really difficult. I view MeV existing on a spectrum of, frankly, private order flow to users getting screwed. Everyone sort of aligns somewhere on this spectrum.
00:38:34.826 - 00:39:49.590, Speaker A: It's really difficult to escape that because if you sort of rewind to the early days of the way that MeV was getting thought out on ETH, really forward looking people like Phil Dion of flashbots realized that, hey, Ethereum, we're permissionless, we're open, we're public, all of that stuff. That's great, right? You don't have these make believe barriers to entry that you do in tradfi for who can be a market maker and who can trade and all that stuff. The downside of that, though, is that when all these transactions just get submitted to this public mem pool, anyone can see, and there will be really sophisticated actors that front run you, and users end up getting kind of screwed. And the Ethereum, I think, for a lot of really good logic, I think Ethereum adopted basically an accelerationist view of mev. They said, unless we want to do private order flow, and unless we want to do this colocation bullshit that happens in tradfi, which we do not want, we are just going to accept that users, for now, are getting the raw end of the stick. The original solve for these sort of PvP. I forget, like price, whatever that happened in the early days, they created Mevboost, which is this off chain auction sort of sidecar that Ethereum proposers would run.
00:39:49.590 - 00:40:14.142, Speaker A: They did a lot of this biding off chain, and they returned those funds to the proposer. So that was like step one. That's a little bit better, right? It's not just these searchers that are like raking in profits. Users are still getting screwed, but at least you're turning it to the proposer. Now, the next step on that is ETH. You're taking those funds away from the proposer and actually returning them to users. So this is what's happening on the application level in Ethereum right now.
00:40:14.142 - 00:40:49.290, Speaker A: And Solana is taking the opposite perspective to that. They are saying, we actually want to put the user first. If you listen to a lot of the people in Solana, like, this was a philosophical, mission driven statement where they found that trade off unappealing. Now, the problem is they're going to have to deal with Spam and all these other really unfortunate third order consequences that the Ethereum people saw way out ahead of time and they were trying to avoid. So it's a big question mark in terms of how they're going to mitigate these unfortunate external consequences of this. But they're just taking a super different path, and I'm rooting for him. I hope it works.
00:40:49.290 - 00:40:56.734, Speaker A: It might be the right path. I don't know, but if anyone can figure it out, it'll be the Jito guys. So, yeah, pulling for them.
00:40:56.852 - 00:41:34.490, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it'll be interesting to see. I mean, there's going to be so many things that they build on top of Solana stakenet restaking, potentially. It's kind of like Lido and flashbots combined on ETH. And I guess it kind of fits with the whole monolithic thesis of they've just kind of vertically built and integrated all these components. So it's going to be cool to see how they keep chugging along. But I think Jito is just going to be a Solana juggernaut, know, as long as that team is just chewing glass, which seems like it'll probably be forever.
00:41:35.790 - 00:42:12.034, Speaker A: And I'll show a resource that is the combination of Jito and ellipsis. Eugene over at Ellipsis and Lucas will write these pieces on umber research. So if you want to stay up to date with MeV happenings on Solana, I would recommend that it's a resource for everyone. Laster, I want to get your guys take on, like, we were talking about this a little bit, but meme coins. So, Vance, I was interested to hear you say, I've had some. I mean, this is just such a funny debate on Twitter. You've either got some people that are, you know, these are the worst things ever, and it's, like, horrible for the ecosystem.
00:42:12.034 - 00:42:28.518, Speaker A: Then you've got other people being like, boomer, take bro. Meme coins are fucking great. And I feel like there's a nice middle ground to be had on these things. But I was interested to hear that you said every l two has a meme coin strategy. So what do you guys make this phenomenon?
00:42:28.534 - 00:43:05.782, Speaker C: I mean, avalanche also said they're going to buy meme coins on the market from the foundation. Everyone has a vested interest in bringing meme coins to their chain, and so meme coins will naturally manifest on their chain. The thing that's interesting about meme coins and why ethereum l one had a stranglehold on them for so long, is if you want to make a meme coin multibillion on chain, you need a lot of capital sitting on that chain that's ready to buy things. And the canonical example is like the ETH pepe pair. You have a ton of ETH on chain. People are willing to use it. Okay, ETH swaps to pepe pepe market cap goes up.
00:43:05.782 - 00:43:35.706, Speaker C: And now, just like an experiment, could meme coins happen when Salana. On Salana. When Salana was $8. No, not enough capital to make something multibillion. If salana is only like ten or 20 billion at that point, now it's different. And so I think what the prognosis for l two meme coin season is, is like either people start, I personally think it's going to be ETH, because all these l two s are basically giving their tokens out to get people to bridge. Look at blast, look at arbitram, look at optimism.
00:43:35.706 - 00:44:12.854, Speaker C: So you pull the ETH onto your chain, and people are used to using ETH, they're used to speculating with it. That's going to be the native capital base that causes these things to go up. And so it's like bullish ETH because the ETH is transferring. It's also bullish ETH because those transaction fees are now being generated on the cell, too. But I think that's kind of what you're going to see is like a very intentional meme coin strategy that's powered by ETH, because it's the biggest asset. There's 100 billion in DFI. I think the less likely path is the native tokens of these l two s are what's used for speculation.
00:44:12.854 - 00:44:40.406, Speaker C: Because, again, if you think about it, let's say you're a new l two, one of the thousands that's launching. You have to, a, get people to accept your token as money. B, you have to get your token high enough where it can be used to speculate and make these meme coins go up. So let's just say an l two launches at 2 billion. Let's say the float is 10%. There's 200 million of capital there. That 200 million of capital can't make a meme coin go up, not to 3 billion, which is what we've had, is on today.
00:44:40.406 - 00:44:58.380, Speaker C: So it'll be ETH centric. The asset of ETH will be used. And I think you're going to see it's not an accident that these things pop up. And they're very easy to engineer because there's literally no app behind them and they're very accretive to the ecosystem. So you kind of have all the incentives in place.
00:44:59.230 - 00:45:39.080, Speaker B: Yeah, the mental model I have for them is these are the equivalent and not the same, and there's so many different reasons why, but the equivalent of what NFTs were last cycle, where you have speculative fervor, you have really easy to launch these things. It's not that hard to put together an app around them or like an ecosystem around them. They're funny. There's like misspelled politicians is now the new vibe. And I think the other thing that is really interesting is there's literally markets where people are betting on how long these ecosystems will last. And we're not talking about like months or quarters or years. It's like literally hours.
00:45:39.080 - 00:46:16.210, Speaker B: When is everyone going to collectively decide that it's over and they move on to the next one? But it's that movement, it's that transition that I think is going to drive activity onto these platforms. To Vance's point, you don't want to just be sitting there and earning your 5% yield on state deep if you could be going and jumping in and trading and making 500 x on $100. And so I think that that is what drives consumers in. Speculation has always been a feature, not a bug. But it is the next kind of craze that I think is going to draw a ton of people in the cycle.
00:46:16.950 - 00:46:32.234, Speaker C: It feels like meme coins have kind of taken the place of NFTs this cycle to some extent. A way to turn $100 into $1,000 if you're lucky, but it's just a.
00:46:32.352 - 00:46:36.810, Speaker B: Or $100 into a million dollars because there are a couple of people who do that.
00:46:36.960 - 00:46:59.086, Speaker C: Lyft was at $0.01 once, and there's always a market for a lottery ticket. But yeah, I don't think it's a negative thing. Like, Michael and I used to punt meme coins back in the day. We would never tell anybody not to do that. I just think it's a little cringe when people try to take it to that next philosophical level of know. I am George Soros of meme coins.
00:46:59.086 - 00:47:08.814, Speaker C: Or like, this is like a philosophical, spiritual experiment. It's not. You're just making money. That's okay, too. I don't care. Free country. Do what you want, dude.
00:47:08.862 - 00:47:22.490, Speaker A: I feel exactly the same way about know. I look at these people on both sides of this where they're like, these are the worst things ever. It's like, you got to lighten up, buddy. But I also look at these like, there was one thread I saw. It was like a ten thread thing on why meme coins are so important.
00:47:22.560 - 00:47:24.540, Speaker C: Like, stop, just stop.
00:47:25.070 - 00:47:26.620, Speaker A: They can be just fun.
00:47:27.150 - 00:47:34.534, Speaker C: That is what kills meme coins also. That's what kills meme coins is you take it too seriously.
00:47:34.662 - 00:47:35.340, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:47:36.450 - 00:47:42.960, Speaker C: Remember when Shib was going to launch? Now too. It's like, don't try to add utility to this thing. This thing is just this thing.
00:47:43.890 - 00:47:53.870, Speaker B: Jason Calicanis, Aaron Levy and Ben McKenzie are just so furious right now watching all of this know jcal.
00:47:53.950 - 00:48:05.922, Speaker A: Yeah, I keep tweeting. I almost deleted my tweets because I'm like, I don't know if this is going to do anything, but it's just like, come on, dude, I would love to see your early stage AI bags. Like, you're pointing at crypto, calling it ridiculous.
00:48:05.986 - 00:48:18.220, Speaker C: Like, okay, I was listening to a podcast with him. He's like, I make 700 angel investments a year. You make two a day. Not accounting weekends. What are you talking about?
00:48:19.790 - 00:48:22.160, Speaker B: How many of them do you actually know the name of?
00:48:22.530 - 00:48:30.990, Speaker C: Yeah, dude, 700 investments a year. It's pretty wild. For ten years, he's got 7000 investments.
00:48:31.490 - 00:48:34.410, Speaker B: He's got an investment criteria as good as swiss cheese.
00:48:34.490 - 00:48:36.282, Speaker C: I mean, spray and pray.
00:48:36.426 - 00:49:08.214, Speaker A: Good luck. Yeah, well, I don't know. I think that take that he has about pivoting to AI. I mean, I'm obviously biased, but I think it's going to age like milk. And although it has been funny, it's like you can see that AI basically anything that's attached to AI in trad world, it's just getting bit up right now. And I feel like Nier, I don't know if you guys, I don't really know how to interpret this, but, yeah, near hasn't moved know forever. And all of a sudden everyone sort of woke up and realized that Ilya actually is like a real guy in the world of AI.
00:49:08.214 - 00:49:13.520, Speaker A: And he did this, I guess he did a conference or like a talk or something with Jensen Huang from.
00:49:14.130 - 00:49:15.802, Speaker B: Which is why it pumped.
00:49:15.946 - 00:49:19.440, Speaker A: Right? It's like up 100%. Yeah.
00:49:19.890 - 00:50:01.280, Speaker C: I think we've expressed this before, but we own tokens that are not bitcoin and ETH to roughly trend the market. And what we play for is, like, the three to four weeks a year where they re rate. And I think that's like a pretty decent framework for thinking about things like near where you had this amazing three or four. I don't know how much it went up pump, but you're still probably underperforming ETH or like, kind of roughly in kind of neck and neck with it. But we'll mean. My sense of the AI stuff is that it's kind of starting to fade a little bit. Michael and I were both with a bunch of LPs this week.
00:50:01.280 - 00:50:17.730, Speaker C: The sentiment was like, the people who are doing the AI deals are fucking idiots. And it's been, what, maybe 24 months or 18 months since chat GPT launched? 18. Either of you use it every day? I certainly don't.
00:50:21.270 - 00:50:56.974, Speaker B: And I think that this is the case even for founders in the space, like some of our portfolio founders who I've been talking to, it's like they expect that it's going to be years for applications to actually develop. Granted, this is like the specular firmware that a fervor that drives adoption on the infrastructure side in terms of just getting capital investment. But nobody knows who's going to be the winner, who's going to be the category, how the value chain actually works. Nobody has any idea about it. It is like, let's throw money darts at these opportunities and see if any of them hit a bullseye. But we have no idea when or how or if they will. That's where we're at right now.
00:50:56.974 - 00:51:15.182, Speaker B: And I think ultimately it will be a good time to invest, just as their 2018 cycle was a good time to even look at alt layer ones. But I do think nobody has any idea how it's going to work out. And if they pretend to be able to have a thesis around it, they're absolutely wrong.
00:51:15.336 - 00:51:49.360, Speaker C: Yeah, and throwing money darts is the job, and being early is the job. And we're investing in crypto AI stuff because it might be a little fuzzy, but there's good entrepreneurs, and you just kind of got to give them a ball and hope that it works, obviously, within bounds of reason. I think where people are getting more negative on it is like the open AI round at 90 billion, the anthropic round at 40 billion. Who knows if these are going to be the winners? And it looks like none of them are profitable. And it's not really even close.
00:51:50.290 - 00:52:49.150, Speaker B: My thesis, actually, why there's AI boom. And yes, the one, I would say, shining element of the AI fervor right now, the crypto X AI, is the quality of the entrepreneurs coming in. We've got Google deepline people coming in. We've got founders who've been working in AI for the last three, four years who actually understand this stuff. Giving them the ball and letting them try to figure things out is kind of where we are in the stage, and the smartest ones are already like, hey, we don't know exactly what's going to happen, but we're going to stick handle our way through it as we go, and that's how we're approaching it. But my thesis around why AI tokens right now are getting some boom is because there are very few places to speculate on AI in an open market. And you can buy Nvidia, you can buy Microsoft, trillion, dollar companies, or you can go off and buy billion dollar less than billion dollar assets that are working on AI.
00:52:49.150 - 00:53:05.800, Speaker B: When to your point, Vance, a $90 billion open AI round and a 40 billion anthropic round are some of the benchmarks of where these things could go if they re rate eventually. And so, yeah, my point is, I think people are just thinking, like, I need exposure to AI. How do I get it?
00:53:06.570 - 00:53:39.374, Speaker C: By the way, one of my rules of thumb for crypto markets is that it's hard for coins that are not bitcoin or ETH to sustain above 100 million fTV for whatever reason. That's kind of where salana peaked and Luna peaked, and I think avalanche probably got close. But world coins right there. Yeah, these things have seasons. I was talking with someone today or maybe yesterday, and they were like, dude, meme coins. Meme coins. Meme coins.
00:53:39.374 - 00:53:46.740, Speaker C: Like, meme coins. And I was like, do you even remember the last narrative or the one before that? They're like, I can't even remember what that was.
00:53:47.830 - 00:54:31.154, Speaker A: Okay, I have a question for you guys. You guys were super active during Defi summer. I was not very active during defi summer, but I sometimes go back and listen to old pods, and I heard this djen Spartan one on uncommon core, which is worth a listen because he was super active during that period of time. And he said one of the things that tipped him off that Defi summer is coming to an end is that the amount of new farms that would spring up, like the lifecycle, get shorter and shorter every time. It was like, you used to be able to farm. It was like you had a week, then you had a couple of days, then it was like a day, and then it was like a couple of hours, and then you had to be out before it just collapsed. And I feel like the acceleration of new meme coins is just getting really high right now.
00:54:31.154 - 00:54:34.980, Speaker A: And just. I don't know if there's an analog there, but there is.
00:54:35.610 - 00:54:39.154, Speaker B: It's what we do. It's what we do. We burn too hot. It's crypto.
00:54:39.282 - 00:54:39.766, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:54:39.868 - 00:54:43.190, Speaker B: Ultimately, something just gets too hot and goes poof.
00:54:43.690 - 00:55:37.014, Speaker C: Someone demand. And then, because this, especially meme coins cost no money or time to ship, we meet it with supply. And this is true for anything. Like, remember all the uniswap clones? Sushi and trader Joe and cake? Sure, there's room for four, but we literally had 400. And that affects the valuation of the biggest one, too, because when they all start to fade, then people are like, is the category unworkable? And if you don't have fundamentals, it's like the category doesn't even exist, really. So I think there is some truth to that. And I think you're going to see probably some of that in restaking, especially with the ABS, where the ABS quality will be the initial kind of determiner of which farms stick around.
00:55:37.014 - 00:56:04.670, Speaker C: But then it's just going to be like hundreds of ABS is launching and how do you even tell? And the category kind of starts to look a little, like, wonky. But I was watching some person get rugged on a meme coin yesterday. The swifty meme coin on Salana, where it literally pumped like 100 x, had this perfect engulfing candle, and then went down 95% within like 2 hours. So I think the timing of these is getting faster. That's kind of undeniable.
00:56:05.170 - 00:56:27.158, Speaker A: Totally. Yeah. And they're fun, but people, I guess the one thing where I can actually see meme coins not being super great is people who are in the know understand that this is a game of musical chairs. They're like, I'm having fun. I'm going to toss some money into this and sort of gamble. I don't know when retail really does end up coming. Like, they don't understand as much.
00:56:27.158 - 00:56:46.190, Speaker A: And actually, this was like a big argument in the blockwork slack this week about, well, I understand that Gioboden isn't the future of finance, but people knew that about doge, and people still know. You hear these stories about people yellowing their life savings into doge. And I don't know, because I hate the paternalistic, like, we should protect retail.
00:56:47.010 - 00:57:07.078, Speaker C: I think there is some survival bias. You remember Shib and doge because they're still worth a lot. You probably don't remember safe Moon, which Portnoy aped into it, literally the pico top, and then went actually 99% down. That's hysterical. Portnoy is Joe Bowden videos today.
00:57:07.164 - 00:57:07.800, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:57:10.650 - 00:57:11.462, Speaker B: I don't care.
00:57:11.516 - 00:57:26.060, Speaker C: Make money on meme coins. Like, do your thing, 100 x, leverage, knock yourself out. But just understand that if something happens, no one's coming to save you. That's the deal you make.
00:57:27.550 - 00:57:35.482, Speaker B: Speaking of Doge, did you see the leaked video from Elon talking about how he eventually wants to implement doge payments for Tesla?
00:57:35.546 - 00:57:37.760, Speaker C: Oh, my God, this clown is back.
00:57:39.250 - 00:57:40.714, Speaker B: The cycle returns.
00:57:40.842 - 00:58:01.414, Speaker C: Also, the long knives are out for, like, I don't know if you've seen the Tesla chart and all the negative press coverage. Know people are coming for him on Trump donations. Like, it feels like we just locked arms. And we're like, time to cancel this man. Yeah, I don't want him to be canceled, but he's kind of in trouble here.
00:58:01.612 - 00:58:09.594, Speaker A: Yeah, I've noticed the Tesla chart going down. I don't have a great explanation other than AI and Nvidia, but it got.
00:58:09.632 - 00:58:19.130, Speaker C: Clipped for 5% today. You don't really see things go down 5%. Man, this is a brutal looking chart.
00:58:19.470 - 00:58:48.930, Speaker A: Yeah, 5% today. That's quite a bit. It was pretty invincible for such a long time. I remember it was right when I moved to New York. So it was like 2016 or 2017. I was having drinks with this family friend and she was mentioning she worked at Jim Chenos's fund, and he had this famous short fund, which I guess he closed up last year. But she was saying their biggest position was short.
00:58:48.930 - 00:58:55.846, Speaker A: Tesla, that guy just clobbered. I mean, I'm sure he closed it out at some point, but I mean.
00:58:55.868 - 00:59:10.682, Speaker B: That was one of the most popular mid curve trades in that short. Tesla was the trade that everybody who thought of himself as being really intelligent about the market.
00:59:10.736 - 00:59:11.578, Speaker C: There's no way they're going to be.
00:59:11.584 - 00:59:56.810, Speaker B: Able to deliver the number of cars. There's no way they're going to hit profitability. Car companies can't do this. He beat them back with a stick. Now, I think to Vance's point, this feels like a larger kind of swath that's coming in, and it feels like governmental in the sense that it's the ruling against his pay package. He literally came out and said, if I own a certain percentage, if I don't own a certain percentage and basically have control, voting control over this company, I don't feel comfortable having AI live within this company. And that was a big negative, him not getting invited to the electric car symposium, even though he's the largest producer of electric cars.
00:59:56.810 - 01:00:01.680, Speaker B: So many things.
01:00:02.850 - 01:00:21.426, Speaker C: This is worth calling out. And I think this is really different from the last cycle. So COVID hits. That's the COVID low right there. That's 28, 50. Then it kind of ranges around 130 around the end of October, when things get really bullish. Chanos probably gets blown out around here.
01:00:21.426 - 01:00:48.166, Speaker C: And then it rallies to 400, and then we're still at 162. This is down more than like ETH. That is a major regime shift. Where he was on SNL, he was pumping DOJ, he was pumping Tesla, whatever, but he's getting clobbered. It's really interesting that he's not riding.
01:00:48.198 - 01:00:57.914, Speaker A: This wave, dude, I think the pay package thing is so messed. Just I understand I know that there's, like, a legal argument. I get it, I get it. But no other CEO.
01:00:58.042 - 01:01:00.942, Speaker B: A legal argument for a guy who owned nine shares of the company.
01:01:00.996 - 01:01:20.770, Speaker A: Nine shares. No other CEO, Fortune 500 CEO, or probably any other CEO would take the pay package that he got offered. It was all like, ungamable comps, and he took no fixed salary. There's no one else that would have taken that. I thought it was super shareholder aligned. I think it's ridiculous.
01:01:20.930 - 01:01:38.602, Speaker B: So here's my favorite stat. $65 billion worth of Tesla stock is supposedly set to be returned to the company. Do you know how much the payment request from the lawyers who were on the plaintiff side was?
01:01:38.656 - 01:01:41.198, Speaker A: 5 billion. $5 billion.
01:01:41.284 - 01:01:42.320, Speaker C: I saw that.
01:01:43.330 - 01:01:47.280, Speaker A: Are you kidding me? That's messed up.
01:01:48.610 - 01:01:51.806, Speaker B: Yeah, we beat him in court. We'll take our 10%, please.
01:01:51.988 - 01:01:53.646, Speaker A: Actually, we'll cut it down to eight.
01:01:53.748 - 01:01:59.300, Speaker C: I do think this Elon not participating in this run means something. I'm not sure what it means, though.
01:02:00.070 - 01:02:02.820, Speaker B: Yeah, my guess is it means he comes back.
01:02:05.750 - 01:02:06.126, Speaker C: We're.
01:02:06.158 - 01:02:16.550, Speaker B: We still got know the biggest opportunity company for him has yet to really kind of go public. Launch, et cetera. SpaceX.
01:02:17.050 - 01:02:35.054, Speaker C: This is kind of like the Trump thing where people are like, ooh, $350,000,000 judgment. He's going to have to sell some buildings. He's going to have to downsize his house. It's like his SPAC shares are worth $4 billion. A fictional company that doesn't exist. It's apparently going to merge with true social. He's going to be okay.
01:02:35.054 - 01:02:44.640, Speaker C: And, yeah, I think to fade Elon here is probably a poor idea, but it does mean something that he's not participating in this.
01:02:45.010 - 01:03:21.738, Speaker A: Yeah. Can I ask you guys a question? Diverting from Elon for a second, so I saw this know from naval, that just made me think. He's like, the narrative is, this cycle is the last cycle, and this is around the time when people start saying stuff. I feel like where I've seen some takes, like, there's the classic, like, ETFs put bitcoin in a league of its own. This is different. We've never had this bitcoin buying, and there's something to that, I think. But this is around the time where people start questioning, like, is this cycle going to be like every other cycle? Is it going to be different? I feel like there are some ways that, at least to me, it feels a little bit tangibly different.
01:03:21.738 - 01:03:43.540, Speaker A: I feel differently than I did the last time crypto broke out from its last all time high. I remember exactly how I felt. I felt like an electric shock. And if you actually look at the price chart when it broke through, it almost doubled in the month after that. What are your thoughts on all of this sort of discussion? Is it different this time? Is it roughly going to play out the same?
01:03:43.910 - 01:04:02.170, Speaker C: So start with, the only thing that people are worse remembering at than how things happened is how they felt about how things happened. So I would kind of question whether you actually felt like that because you probably didn't own a ton of bitcoin.
01:04:02.830 - 01:04:03.482, Speaker A: No.
01:04:03.616 - 01:04:42.502, Speaker C: And ETH took another year to break out, and it kind of like lagged for a long time. For me, the all time highs were in Q one of 2021. That's when it was like, holy shit, we're three X up from the old all time high. The bitcoin one was more like, turning on the lights again is not going to die. But it does feel different. And I do think there is some truth to the last cycle idea where it probably is the final cycle of ten X gains for the majors. If you're longing ETH in two years from 10,000 to get to 100,000, that's a very different industry in play.
01:04:42.502 - 01:05:22.340, Speaker C: It's probably driven mostly by institutions. I think how we think about it is our next fund is probably not going to be buying massive amounts of bitcoin and ETH at the highs. We'll probably have some allocation to that, but the game will change to hopefully d five value plays and games that are bringing in mass amounts of users and other things that are generating real economic value. Those assets will kind of graduate the Ethan bitcoins of the world to like the 401 ks, the Raas, the tradfi, kind of complex. So I think there is some truth to it, but the cycles always continue. They're just always different. To your point, the game changes so.
01:05:23.030 - 01:05:27.086, Speaker B: Fully agree with all that. The other thing I'd add is it'll.
01:05:27.118 - 01:05:28.686, Speaker A: Look and feel the same, like we're.
01:05:28.718 - 01:06:20.642, Speaker B: Going to go through the same emotional cycle. It's just going to happen for different reasons this time. One of the reasons why I think this fundamentally could be different is because the institutions are here, finally, and we have that with the ETF, we have that with Larry Fink, but I'd say even more so. We're going to start to see that with regulations and changes in legislature. Dance actually shared this with me, but yesterday we were looking at the Roosevelt Institute publishing a report basically saying that we need to be able to move in the direction of positive regulations for this industry. Roosevelt Institute is a pretty left leaning institution and no connection, and they explicitly called out no funding from the digital asset community whatsoever. But they were kind of the first major think tank to publish.
01:06:20.642 - 01:06:50.154, Speaker B: We need to move in the direction of positive regulation. No more court battles. We can't let this get to the Supreme Court. They say leave a hole in securities law. And so I think we're actually going to see pretty sensible regulation that becomes know depending on how everything turns out in November. In this next election cycle, I think we're going to see a lot of movement. And once that happens, then it's not just Larry Fink that's coming in off the sidelines and jumping into the industry for bitcoin.
01:06:50.154 - 01:07:23.740, Speaker B: It's actually every financial institution because they then have a playbook for how to operate and integrate into this industry. That I think is probably the most likely outcome for how this becomes the last cycle, how we get more than a ten X from here. But that, I think is kind of the variable that frankly has never even been possible in any previous cycle. So it's going to be long and it's going to be positive for a while, but I think that's going to be the variable that dictates how permanent this cycle is.
01:07:24.750 - 01:07:59.542, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree with all that. One thing that I would push back on pretty strongly is actually some of my favorite new entrants to the cycle have been Eric Balkunis and James Safert over at Bloomberg. I think those guys, it's awesome to watch them get to this stage in their journey, but where I'm going to push back on both of them, and if you guys are listening, an enormous amount of respect for both of you. But where I just disagree is this attitude that I feel like this is the third time I've seen it out in force. It's only going to be bitcoin. Bitcoin is the thing that's going to cross the chasm. And none of this other stuff is, I've just seen that disproven so many times.
01:07:59.542 - 01:08:20.540, Speaker A: It feels very unlikely to me that people will do well on their bitcoin and then be like, okay, this is like all I'm going to do. I think the other thing that people always underestimate is like, okay, I miss bitcoin. What's next? What's the next bitcoin? And that driver for investors is so powerful. I don't know. I strongly disagree with the idea.
01:08:21.310 - 01:08:34.606, Speaker B: Every single market happens the same way. It starts with bitcoin and then it goes to ethereum or alt layer ones. And then it goes to altcoins. It's happening the same time this time around. It's just, we're at bitcoin right now.
01:08:34.788 - 01:08:45.150, Speaker C: Remember when all Fortune 500 companies were going to put bitcoin on their balance sheet and we were going to go into this Anne Randian pipe dream? Didn't happen. All the coins.
01:08:47.930 - 01:08:48.918, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
01:08:49.084 - 01:09:20.634, Speaker C: We do this every. The cycle is that the flows are real in a way that they. Tesla. All the bitcoin that Tesla bought is like, two days of inflows at this rate. But it's funny, and I noticed this, like, shit. If you told me there was going to be a billion dollars of inflows every single day, I'd be like, bitcoin is at 100K easily, but it's kind of just like, chugging along. And that's what drives people to do ETH and Alt L1s and altcoins.
01:09:20.634 - 01:09:38.390, Speaker C: And even Matt Hogan, the CIO of bitwise, had to put out this kind of weird Twitter thread about, like, don't worry, alt season doesn't mean that bitcoin isn't the only app. It's like, dude, this is going to happen with or without you. So it's just kind of the same thing, repeats.
01:09:38.970 - 01:10:16.080, Speaker A: Well, I can't speak to Matt's perspective on this specifically, but even just like in talking to. We've got London coming up in next week, and my last three weeks have been all these prep panel calls with all these people, a lot of the ETF issuers, a lot of the people that work at banks. I can tell you, unanimously, behind the scenes, a lot of what's going to come up at this conference is like, okay, bitcoin is great. What's next? And it was zero out of 90 people that I talked to that was like, yeah, bitcoin is the only thing. I don't know, I was willing to. We know what my entire reputation on this.
01:10:17.890 - 01:10:31.858, Speaker C: Crypto asset. Yeah, bitcoin. Michael, that video last night, and always funny to look at. It's always relevant. It's just bitcoin is not the only thing in this universe. I got to go jump.
01:10:32.034 - 01:10:42.134, Speaker A: Yeah. All right, we can end it here, fellas. All right, cheers, guys. Hey, everyone. Mike here. If you're a bell curve listener, you know that transferring assets across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do.
01:10:42.134 - 01:11:00.250, Speaker A: I complain about it on this program all the time. That is why we're incredibly excited to have teamed up with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol, and the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve NFTs which you can get and mint for free.
