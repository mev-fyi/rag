00:00:00.250 - 00:00:35.622, Speaker A: The steady state ratio for networks versus companies is going to be a multiple higher for networks for this exact reason. And it's just very simple in the fact that there are multivariate variate reasons why people would want to hold the token. Maybe it's for governance rights, maybe it's for staking capabilities, maybe it's just for the cash flows, maybe it's for X, Y or Z. Plus you layer on the liquidity premium that you're describing, Mike, and you compare that to any private equity or startup stock, and there's no comparison in terms of how you should evaluate this, even in a public sense.
00:00:35.676 - 00:01:06.462, Speaker B: Hey everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Salana, Sui, Ethereum, L2s and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts which you can get and mint for free.
00:01:06.462 - 00:01:26.102, Speaker B: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. Alright guys, on with the show. Hi everyone. This episode is brought to you by swell, a team leading the restaking future with their liquid restaking token r suite. Now I've talked about liquid restaking on this program before. I think it is going to be a massive tectonic shift for ethereum and I am super, super excited about it. And I like the swell team a lot.
00:01:26.102 - 00:01:46.410, Speaker B: Goes without saying, do your own research. This is not financial advice. You guys all know the drill. Again, I like this team. And if you stick around, I'm going to describe how you can restake your eth in swell, earn pearls, Eigen layer points, and a whole bunch of future rewards. So thank you very much for swell, for making this episode possible. Hey everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator.
00:01:46.410 - 00:02:10.822, Speaker B: Now if you are a listener of Bell Curve, you know that Mev is a massive problem, which is why we are so pumped to partner up with Flood on this season. Flood is the only gasless and mev free aggregator that not only gets you the best execution, but also gives you back all the extra surplus that you create every single time you swap. Now this is relevant for both swappers and developers, but you're going to be hearing all about them later in the program. So for now, thank you, Flood, and.
00:02:10.876 - 00:02:11.638, Speaker C: Back to the show.
00:02:11.724 - 00:02:13.174, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another.
00:02:13.212 - 00:02:17.794, Speaker C: Episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host.
00:02:17.842 - 00:02:20.202, Speaker B: Today are their personal views, and they.
00:02:20.256 - 00:02:43.874, Speaker C: Do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal, or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Curve. You got Michael's one and two advance, fellas. How are we doing?
00:02:43.912 - 00:02:46.386, Speaker A: How's the week we're doing?
00:02:46.488 - 00:02:50.180, Speaker D: We're doing it going well. Trying to think of what's been going on.
00:02:50.630 - 00:03:01.734, Speaker C: Yeah, lower. Yeah, lower. People are worried. There was a big eigen layer raise. I don't know if you guys saw that. $100 million E 16 Z took down the whole thing.
00:03:01.852 - 00:03:03.574, Speaker D: Talking about real money now.
00:03:03.772 - 00:03:38.494, Speaker C: Yeah, exactly. There's a lot of good stuff this week, actually. I thought we had a fun debate last show about is restaking leverage. And I've got another topic to run by you guys. Just how you think about market cap versus FDB. But before we get into that, Vance, you and I were chatting a little bit about some of these takes around the bitcoin etfs. And friend of blockworks, Jim Bianco, was describing kind of this opinion where maybe some of the flows that are moving into the bitcoin etfs were less long term.
00:03:38.494 - 00:03:54.306, Speaker C: He sort of delineated these two types of etfs. There's allocator etfs and DGen etfs, which are mostly traders. And he was implying that a lot of the flows that were moving into the bitcoin ETF complex are on the dGen trader side of things. What do you guys think about that perspective?
00:03:54.418 - 00:04:30.754, Speaker D: I'm sorry, what the fuck are you talking about? People, like, on Twitter trying to be like, the dgen holder ETFs versus the. You don't need to have an opinion on everything. And it just feels like Tradfi and especially like, the ETF Twitter complex, of which I don't know how much Bianco has in his ETF, but a lot of these guys have, like, 2030, $40 million of AUM. They're just furious that this thing is kind of happening without them, and they are trying to latch onto the train. And I just think you don't need to have an opinion on everything. You can just let it happen.
00:04:30.952 - 00:04:42.278, Speaker A: You also are so obviously transparent when you're getting so pissed off or ripped or just the cope is so transparent that your badge are not patched, you're.
00:04:42.284 - 00:04:43.400, Speaker C: Not ready to go.
00:04:44.090 - 00:04:49.470, Speaker A: It is really tough to see, but I think a lot of this is really just painful cope.
00:04:49.570 - 00:05:11.374, Speaker D: The most recent one I saw this tweet this morning is that Jim Bianco is okay with bitcoin going up as long as it goes up for the right reasons. So now it's not just that the price can go up or might go up, it's like it has to go up for the right reasons. We're just moving the goalposts all the time.
00:05:11.572 - 00:05:39.282, Speaker C: Yeah, I do like Jim a lot. He's, like I said, friend of blockworks. He's been a permissionless in the past and is a genuine supporter of the space. I do disagree with him on this idea that bitcoin has sold its soul and that the ETFs represent a betrayal of bitcoin's values. Ultimately, the whole point of these systems is that they're permissionless and people should be able to use them in the wrapper or product form that best suits them. And there's a bunch of tradified people that the ETF is going to be best suited for. They should use bitcoin in that wrapper.
00:05:39.282 - 00:05:51.702, Speaker C: There are going to be a whole bunch of other people, I think probably more people in the end that don't want to put it in ETF wrapper, and that's totally fine too. But I think it's almost like it doesn't really matter is the TLDR from my perspective, it doesn't.
00:05:51.766 - 00:06:27.240, Speaker D: And we hold our bitcoin in Coinbase or self custody, and that works for us and other people will hold it in the ETF and that works for them. And his other argument is, know now that ibit owns so much bitcoin, they're going to be able to govern and censor the network. It just speaks to a lack of not understanding how these systems work or how their governance. Yeah, some pretty mid takes this week on the etfs from the trad ETF crowd. Unfortunately. I do like Bianco. I subscribe to his research, but he's kind of just out of his depth on this one.
00:06:27.770 - 00:06:38.634, Speaker A: I guess it's not trad ETF crowd, but I thought there was a pretty awesome take from the Coinbase crowd talking about ETH ETF. I don't know if you want to transition to that.
00:06:38.672 - 00:06:39.258, Speaker D: Let's talk about it.
00:06:39.264 - 00:06:45.214, Speaker C: Yeah, let's talk about it? Yeah. Can you tee us up there, Michael? What was the sort of TLDR from that take?
00:06:45.332 - 00:07:47.106, Speaker A: Yeah, so Paul Drewall, I think that's how you pronounce his last name. But chief legal officer of Coinbase put out this long thread. It's obvious that they've been doing a ton of analysis on basically exactly what went into the SEC's decision to approve the spot bitcoin ETF relative to the futures. There's a look back period where they run a correlation analysis and they try to assess how correlated are the futures markets on the CME to the spot markets on the trading venues like Coinbase or otherwise, where some of the spot volume flows. And they found that, I think it was numbers are going to be slightly off, but a 98% generally correlation, 98.1% between bitcoin futures and bitcoin spot over the look back period. Basically, Coinbase ran the exact same analysis over the exact same period of time for Ethereum and found that the correlation is actually higher than what the SEC found for exactly.
00:07:47.106 - 00:07:49.522, Speaker A: This is the table I'm looking at. Looking for.
00:07:49.656 - 00:07:49.954, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:07:49.992 - 00:08:38.354, Speaker A: So 98.4 on the hourly for what the commissions analysis found, 99.3 on the hourly for the Ethereum analysis that Coinbase found. Another kind of interesting side note is that it doesn't seem, and this is from Scott Johnson, who's another notable person who follows this stuff, tracks it pretty closely. No one who has the data, including Coinbase or Scott Johnson or anybody else, has been able to replicate the commissions analysis to get to that exact 98.4%. So it seems like there's something a little bit different going on, but generally in line with what the sample found from Coinbase of 99.1 for bitcoin and 99.3
00:08:38.354 - 00:09:20.000, Speaker A: for Ethereum, suggests that it's actually more correlated than what you would have over the same period of time. I say amount of time is really kind of the key point here. So positive sentiment, I think, coming into the time period where you would see an Ethereum ETF potentially get approved, which is the may timeline for that first final approval. There's also a ton of other analysis that they put together in this document, in this report, just on kind of the legal basis, the standing and kind of using arguments that they use to support a bitcoin spot ETF to also support a spot ETF. So positive sentiment there.
00:09:21.010 - 00:09:21.470, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:09:21.540 - 00:09:53.574, Speaker D: The other cool part is that they linked their GitHub repo at the bottom of the report. So I was like messing around with it last night. You can rerun the analysis yourself. Michael's point is like, if you're looking at this table, you're basically looking at the bottom right square of the ETH futures compared to the top left square of the bitcoin futures. And the correlations are as high or higher. And that's kind of like one of the two main arguments of people who are like this. ETF is not going to get approved.
00:09:53.574 - 00:10:50.166, Speaker D: It's like, well, the correlations are higher, the sample period is effectively the same. It's like two, two and a half years for both bitcoin and ETH. And then the other talk track that they get into is, is eth a security? How could you tell? And from the launch of the futures, the micro futures and nano futures, both on CME and Coinbase derivatives, there's just a very succinctly put two page argument on if this was a security, it would have already been deemed. So even in the ripple case, the SEC delineates between bitcoin and ETH and the rest of the field. And so it's know, not a security has the same correlation as bitcoin. At the end of the day, you still do know it's a five person commission and you need three people to vote for whatever reason. Gary Gensler voted for the bitcoin ETF, and he was the tiebreaker.
00:10:50.166 - 00:10:52.494, Speaker D: And I think you probably need the same here.
00:10:52.692 - 00:10:58.510, Speaker A: But why he voted, which is because his hands were tied, right?
00:10:58.580 - 00:11:58.142, Speaker D: And I think this is increasingly tying his hands, where if you have this chorus of, like, look, all of the data, all the arguments are out, you kind of do need to approve it. There isn't really a legal basis to not. The other thing I've been thinking of is, let's say that we get a new administration at the end of this year, whether you want that to happen or not. Politically, what would be the path for additional etfs? And I think the path is you kind of do need like two years of sample period on a CME DCM style futures exchange where you can say, we launched a year or two ago, like, say, solana or fucking cardano or whatever launches on this CME. You have two years of period, study period, you can call it. You can, you know, the correlation is sufficient, and then you get the ETF approval. I think that's kind of what I think through in terms of who is going to be next and what timeline.
00:11:58.142 - 00:12:10.582, Speaker D: It's like, let's say Hester purse, green lights, new CME Salana futures next summer. You're probably still waiting until 2026. Or 2027 for that sample period to play out.
00:12:10.716 - 00:13:01.750, Speaker A: Well, there's also a huge variable that's also involved with all of that, which is that starting the clock on that CME Futures product, which is the CFTC, has to declare that asset, whatever it is, to be a commodity and not a security, which means that that's how it could start trading on the CME. And right now there's only two assets that the CFTC has declared, which is bitcoin. And so I think there might even need to be potentially regulatory change before you would see a futures product start, which would start the clock on all of this. And I know the two bills in the house, there's a stablecoin, and then there's the fit for the 21st century. I frankly, unfortunately, don't see those moving too far this round, given that we're already almost in March of an election year. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully I'm wrong.
00:13:01.750 - 00:13:30.350, Speaker A: But the fit for the 21st century does have a path in it for something to start off as a security and then eventually transition to a commodity based on a number of guidelines and a framework, essentially. And so maybe that is the dating item that then opens potential more commodity digital assets. But as it stands right now, there's nothing else that could even start trading on the CME, according to the CFTC.
00:13:31.570 - 00:14:18.430, Speaker D: One last thing on the CME. So in the Coinbase analysis, they basically point out that there's this thing called the Commodity Modernization act, which passed in 2000, which allows the CME to list commodity futures. They can also list security futures. But if they list a security future, basically the SEC has the right to step in and say, like, this is going to be both of our jurisdiction and we're going to mutually kind of decide how these markets work. And ETH is commodity future. The SEC has not kind of come out and said like, look, we need to kind of both regulate this because it is a security future. But if you have in the Coinbase suit, it's like, I think Solana and Matic, and there's a few others that they designate as unregistered.
00:14:18.430 - 00:14:43.880, Speaker D: If, if those would try to get registered on the CME, the SEC, at least in this administration, would step in and say, like, look, those are unregistered securities. This is going to be both of our jurisdictions, and it would complicate the process. I mean, there's just a lot of red tape between the next assets to get even listed on the CME, in our view.
00:14:45.690 - 00:15:20.834, Speaker C: I agree with that. I think ETH is in a really interesting position here because you guys are convincing me of this. I think long term, probably salon or whichever other sufficiently decentralized l ones that the CFTC deems this commodity, they'll probably get etfs as well. But it seems like ETH is going to be the only one that gets approved this cycle, and now ETH is the next thing. And so the tailwinds for ETH is like, okay, if you miss bitcoin now, definitely don't miss ETH. And I think a lot of people are not going to overthink that. Then the other thing is just like regular crypto cycle dynamics that you've got coming in.
00:15:20.834 - 00:16:22.680, Speaker C: So feel like this is the period of the cycle roughly where I think, Vance, you pointed this out last week, that it feels like ETH BTC bottomed and is probably, I don't know if it's this month or next month or whatever, but the thing that you would start to expect is for bitcoin dominance, which has been on a tear for the last year. So if you're looking at this chart here I just showed on my screen, bitcoin dominance is way up. This is usually what happens at the end of a bear market, beginning of the bull, but then that starts to change. And bitcoin dominance has been basically like a one way street down to the right. Over time, as more crypto ecosystems bring up, then ETH BTC is basically a mirror image of that. But you hit it on the head this point on January 9, basically the day before the ETS launch, that looks like it put in a bottom there, and it feels like it's going to continue to run. So, yeah, I think it's a super interesting spot for ETh right here, basically.
00:16:23.370 - 00:17:16.600, Speaker D: Yeah, I wish there was like a liquidity adjusted version of these charts, because alts that have world coin at 100 billion, it's not real in the same liquidity sense as a bitcoin. Like, you can't buy or sell $80 billion of world coin. But I wonder how relevant these charts are going forward, especially this cycle with ETF flows, because Ethan and bitcoin are kind of like through their unlocks. Like Gemini is kind of like the last selling of the GBDC slugs, but they're kind of just like a wash in demand. The alts are going to be kind of like, maybe not this year, but next year, like a wash in supply. And Michael has said this before, it's like a lot of the crypto market activity is not like animal spirits or macro. It's like how many tokens are unlocking on these.
00:17:16.600 - 00:17:31.310, Speaker D: I mean, just the risk return that we see from the majors versus the alts, it's just like way different this cycle than previous cycles because you have those natural ETF flows.
00:17:33.490 - 00:18:15.786, Speaker C: I think that's a really critical dynamic to bring up. And I want to get your guys opinion because I know we talked about the Starkware airdrop on last week's roundup, but stark went live. SDRK, the token went live, and it went live at a pretty dizzyingly high fDv. The fully diluted valuation was at one point it was like 33 billion or something like that. It sold off a decent bit. But just to put that in context, the fully diluted valuations of optimism and arbitrum combined are like 37 billion. So a lot of people are looking at this and just scratching their heads and saying, this doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
00:18:15.786 - 00:18:35.630, Speaker C: I think this is this kind of low float, high FDB dynamic. And Michael, it sounds like you've got opinions on this. I don't know if you want to take this, but this is like, we kind of saw this last cycle a little bit, but yeah, what is your take on, I guess, StrK, the token, but then also just the supply and unlock dynamic that you see in alts.
00:18:36.530 - 00:19:47.506, Speaker A: Mean, I think that this has been a conversation that's been debated about literally for years, maybe even multiple cycles at this point of like market cap versus FTE, which one matters and which one doesn't matter. The way that you could basically think about this is if you're a trader and you're thinking in a very short mindset, short term mindset, market cap is what matters. If you're someone who is thinking about things in terms of months or years, fully diluted valuation is what matters. And it all depends on when that number will change without any input from your end or from the protocol's end other than the unlock schedule. And so what I mean by this is if you're looking at a wave of unlocks that are going to double or triple the market cap based off of tokens becoming online, that is a supply shock in a negative sense to the entire network. And I think one of the reasons why Starbare started off getting kind of some bad press or bad news is because of the way that they had done this unlocked schedule where they had launched the token. The token was already vesting at this point, or had already started its unlocked schedule.
00:19:47.506 - 00:20:49.082, Speaker A: And then two months after the token actually was airdropped and unlocked is the first unlock for investors and team. That's a very atypical structure, and it feels like they're trying to unlock and give the liquidity to potentially insiders sooner than what other protocols would do. Combine that with a really high fdv and it looks a little bit wonky to say the least. But I think if you look at any of the major unlock schedules of any of these protocol tokens, you could start off at a really high fdv. But those tokens don't matter until you have domain over them. And if you don't, then you can pontificate as to what they will be worth when you have that, but it really doesn't count until you do. And so if you're an airdrop farmer, if you're someone who's just buying these things on the secondary markets when they launch, sure, none of this really kind of matters because you're thinking about things in terms of relative days or potentially weeks.
00:20:49.082 - 00:20:53.230, Speaker A: But if you're an investor in the space, FDB is the only thing that matters.
00:20:55.090 - 00:21:27.830, Speaker D: Kind of orthogonal point to this is starkware is at 20 billion right now. I guess it probably halved since launch. It launched at like 350. Now it's at 183. And unlocks for investors come in two months. And it's like ARB is kind of roughly the same fDv. Optimism is roughly the same fdV, but once you see these unlocks start to hit, it feels like that's the signal for traders to start rotating.
00:21:27.830 - 00:22:49.890, Speaker D: And for 5% of people to rotate and win in a new coin, 95% have to lose. And just like a thought experiment is, a lot of l ones or l two s are going to raise in private rounds at 500 million or launch at a billion. And kind of all these l two s roughly do the same thing in our mind, and there's going to be a lot more of them. A lot of people are going to want to buy the $1 billion FTV coin instead of the $20 billion FTV coin, especially as those unlocks hit. And I think you tweeted this today, or maybe yesterday, Mike, but are the name brand l two s that are kind of older that are unlocking going to be more powerful from an ecosystem momentum developer perspective than the hundreds of l two s that are launching today? Like this guy Kruger macro, he tweeted out something funny today, which is there's this roll up as a service platform called Conduit, where you can click op stack, you can click celestia da, and you can click to deploy it. It's like three clicks. And he was like, I'm raising 10 million on 100 million FTV for this roll up that I just clicked deployed.
00:22:49.890 - 00:23:05.800, Speaker D: It's like, man, shit, like 100 million FTV, that's pretty good. When you're looking at Starkware at 20, minds go. But again, for 5% of people to win rotating, 95% have to lose. That is the game.
00:23:06.170 - 00:23:07.478, Speaker A: And just as like to put in.
00:23:07.484 - 00:23:13.466, Speaker D: The anecdote, we don't play that game, by the way. We're kind of doing different stuff. But it's always helpful to kind of.
00:23:13.488 - 00:23:57.160, Speaker A: Put the meta in context just to anecdote this. Let's say that it was May of 2021, and the same narrative was kind of the same narrative that we saw in that period of time, which is alt layer ones were the things that were just ripping at that point. And you saw another alt layer, one that had massive backing, massive funding and massive talent come out called hitter deck computer protocol. And you saw that launch at $500 in May of 2021. Bull market times, this is like PGO bowl. And by the time we hit the PGO top, it was already down to $35. And right now it's trading at about twelve and a half.
00:23:57.160 - 00:24:48.702, Speaker A: And you just witnessed the bleed out, 97%, whatever that is. It can happen really fast, but it can also sustain there for a really long time. The crazy thing is, with the inflation schedule that they have, even at twelve and a half dollars, it's still like a six and a half billion dollar protocol. And that is exactly kind of the difference between FDV and market cap, which is your market cap will change, the supply dynamics will change, the flows in and out of the protocol will change independent of whether or not the price changes. And it's really flows that determine over a longer period of time what the value of these things are. Shorter period of time as well, but flows in. And this is what we're talking about with the ETF.
00:24:48.702 - 00:25:06.830, Speaker A: Flows into the ETF are positive. Less supply, based on the happening, is positive for things like price. And that's kind of what you're evaluated against. And so you really have to think about the supply dynamics. And I think Internet computer protocol, ICP is a great example of how it can turn to get you.
00:25:06.980 - 00:25:59.600, Speaker D: I think the standard operating procedure is bitcoin hits its all time high. First that happened in 2020, then in 2021 you had that massive three or four X ETH BTC move up and it hit its all time high. And then you kind of see what the alts are going to do. I think there's so many coins now relative to prior cycles that you'll probably see weaker breadth in terms of like, is everything participating, especially in light of things like unlocks? We like Arbitrum, we work with arbitrum. They're unlocking $2 billion in the next couple of months of tokens. And regardless of what you think of the project and how it's doing, that is going to be a headwind, and someone will need to buy those coins for it to proceed higher. There's a lot of those.
00:25:59.600 - 00:26:45.550, Speaker D: On the other hand, there's things that I'm trying to think of how much we can say, but there's coins that are doing really well. They have a really strong ecosystem. They had a brutal unlock in the bear market. One that comes to mind is like IMX, where the price bottomed at. I think it was like, it's like at 350 today, where you had all those unlocks happen in the bear market. And those are actually helpful because you're just clearing those coins at much lower prices, like IMX did all of its unlocks at basically like a billion or 2 billion fully diluted. And if you're unlocking 5%, even at those prices, you need $100 million of buying to step in and clear that out.
00:26:45.550 - 00:27:20.330, Speaker D: If it's ten x higher, you need a billion. And so people who've paid that tax in the bear market, I think, are going to do better. But I continue to believe this cycle is about quality. People who are just like, I'm going to hold meme coins and they're going to rip 100 X. It just kind of misses the point of, you see all these ETH and bitcoin flows and all these positive things happening and the burn and the apps and your responses to buy meme coins. It just doesn't feel like the right way to think about this cycle or crypto going forward as a whole.
00:27:20.480 - 00:27:33.086, Speaker A: So one other kind of analogy. Totally agree with all that dance and I have talked a lot about this, but one of the analogies that I was thinking about this week is kind.
00:27:33.108 - 00:27:35.806, Speaker C: Of like, and I was listening to.
00:27:35.828 - 00:28:12.554, Speaker A: A number of traditional investors, like the Bill Ackmans of the world, and listening to their kind of career progression and what it was like. And I guess he started in the late Warren Buffett heyday. Like the Ben Graham analysis heyday, security analysis heyday. There weren't that many companies that you were able to buy. You couldn't do analysis on hundreds of companies. You probably had tens of companies that were publicly traded and liquid. And you could run the analysis on.
00:28:12.554 - 00:29:27.858, Speaker A: I can kind of think of that as what 2021 cycle was. There were tens of opportunities that were public, available, liquid, and that you could kind of watch and follow and see. Now we're getting to the point where that is getting to be hundreds. And so one of the big things that was the narrative when it was Warren above it was can you find value hiding in plain sight? And obviously not electronically traded markets back then, but you could find real value hiding in plain sight. I think the difference now is that obviously the percentage of successes will go down based off of the denominator effect growing. But the bigger thing now isn't going to be can you provide value, but can you provide and sustain value, but also have a breakout narrative? And it requires these protocols to hit on something or create something from a narrative perspective that drives them forward and above the rest of the crowd. Because there is just going to be so much more noise this time around where there are like two, maybe three ethereum alt layer ones that you have to think about.
00:29:27.858 - 00:29:52.970, Speaker A: There's like ten, maybe 20 and potentially 30 by the end of the cycle. I think you kind of have to position yourself to not only figure out how can we build sustainable value for the users, the developers, et cetera, et cetera, but how do we hit on something or create something new from a narrative perspective that drives us through. It's just a major difference this round versus last round.
00:29:53.870 - 00:30:32.310, Speaker D: I think there's obvious candidates. It's like Defi, it's gaming. The funds that we talked to are like, who's got fundamentals, defi? Who's got users like gaming? I think people are going to get confused. Is like Michael's right, where there was four or five big all l ones. Like you're either a Luna guy or an avalanche guy or a Salana guy. And I guess there was like Phantom last cycle, but it dropped off pretty quickly. Now, I would say there's probably less momentum in the all l ones and more momentum and focus on the l two s just because there's so many of them launching.
00:30:32.310 - 00:31:16.980, Speaker D: And unless you're vertically oriented and going after gaming and that's all you do, or you're going after even blast with nfts and that's all you do, it's kind of hard to tell them apart. Other than arbitram having, I think it's like a million or two ETH bridged. That certainly feels kind of like defensible optimism has a lot less TVL, but I guess they have more ecosystem distribution. But all these things, and we talked to all these projects. Their whole strategy is we're going to launch the l two, we're going to do either an abs on eigen layer, or we're going to give tokens away to people to bridge eth. But all of this stuff is like a black hole for ETH. And I think that's like a pretty easy way to understand the l two complex at the moment until somebody breaks out.
00:31:16.980 - 00:31:20.710, Speaker D: It's just like very net beneficial to ETH.
00:31:21.050 - 00:32:12.230, Speaker A: But what I'm saying is, okay, maybe it's not alt layer ones specifically in this cycle. I'm saying factor in all the alt layer ones, all the L2s, basically anything that can be an execution environment or a network, and you've got SVM with parallelization, you've got EVM with parallelization. You can literally mix and match all the different flavors of the tech stack. And there is an l two for that right now. And it's probably raised at a billion plus multibillion dollar valuation, has a massive bankroll, and has 50, 60, 70 developers building on top of it. I can think of at least ten to 15 that fit that exact criteria right now. And combined with what we're just talking about, which is you're going to launch, and then a year later, you're going to have your first unlock.
00:32:12.230 - 00:32:30.282, Speaker A: Massive supply of these digital assets is going to be coming online in 2025, maybe 2026, depending on when these things launch. And it is truly like a ten x difference in terms of that factor versus what we saw in 2021.
00:32:30.336 - 00:33:01.202, Speaker B: Hey, everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to the wormhole foundation. If you are a Bell curve listener, you know that transferring across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That's why we are super pumped to have partnered with the Wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. The wormhole protocol connects over 30 blockchains and six different runtimes, including Salana, Sui, ethereum, L2s, and more. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free.
00:33:01.202 - 00:33:31.806, Speaker B: You can claim that by just going down into the show notes and clicking on the link. All right, guys, on with the show. Hey, everyone. This episode is brought to you by Swell, a liquid restaking protocol, and the issuer of the R suite, liquid restaking token. Now, if you're a listener of Bell Curve, you know that I am just so fascinated by restaking and liquid restaking. I think it is going to be one of the most important trends in Ethereum and I am really excited for the benefit that it unlocks both users and also Ethereum, the protocol itself. Now disclaimer, whenever there's yield involved in a product, do your own research.
00:33:31.806 - 00:33:55.122, Speaker B: This is not financial advice. You guys know the drill. But Swell is a great team. They have a non custodial product and they are mission driven on giving you the best liquid staking experience. If you take one benefit away from using liquid restaking, make it be capital efficiency. Now you can earn passive yield from ethereum, you can earn yield from multiple actively validated services that stack on top of that. And then you can still use Rsweep as collateral in defi.
00:33:55.122 - 00:34:14.906, Speaker B: And because I know y'all are a bunch of dgens, there's a points angle here as well. But in swell we call them pearls. So pearls equal points. And if you stake your eth with swell, you can earn pearls and future eigen layer rewards. When there is a token generation event, you can swap your pearls or swell tokens. Head over, click the link at the bottom of this episode. Again, just pause what you're doing right now.
00:34:14.906 - 00:34:16.874, Speaker B: Go click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:34:16.922 - 00:34:17.850, Speaker C: Check out swell.
00:34:17.930 - 00:34:18.366, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:34:18.388 - 00:34:18.718, Speaker C: Later.
00:34:18.804 - 00:34:54.626, Speaker B: Hey everyone wanted to give a quick shout out to this episode's sponsor, flood protocol, the optimal Dex aggregator. Now, Flood is the perfect partner for this episode on the multi chain future because Flood is solving so many of the issues that we're going to be talking about this season and this is relevant for both traders and devs. So if you are a trader, you should definitely head over to Floodswap and start trading because they solve three massive problems. One, gasless trading, no more pesky trading fees. Two, you don't have to worry about getting front run MEV free. And then three, they have excellent order routing so that you know that you are getting the best price. So head over to Floodswap and click the link in the bottom of the show notes.
00:34:54.626 - 00:35:16.842, Speaker B: We're going to send you right there. For the devs out there you can leverage Flood's flexible hooks, allowing you to make swapping a first class primitive by adding custom order types like twaps. Or if you're a wallet builder or something like that, you can actually build your own order flow auction in and start recapturing a bunch of that MEP. If you want to reach out to them, go to devs at flood bid or just jump right in the discord. All right guys, thanks very much.
00:35:16.916 - 00:36:16.738, Speaker C: Appreciate you flood. I had a long discussion with one of our analysts, Dan, about this last night, and one of the things that I've never really been able to, we talked about it a little bit on the show, but I've been struggling to square the circle in between the way that startup funding works and the way that protocol funding works and the different quirks in between the two of them. And I read this great piece this week. So shout out to the author, Grayson Alto, who wrote about trying to bridge the gap in between market cap and fDv, and he has a slightly more analytical framework. But it's like very much what you two were just describing, which is on a short term time frame, the price is set by the circulating supply and the market cap. But over time it's fdv that ends up mattering. And the assumption is basically, if you only look at FDV, then you're assuming that all of those unlocks happen today, right? And that's not actually the case.
00:36:16.738 - 00:37:13.794, Speaker C: And there are some unlocks which there could be vests that are associated with that. There could be some of the, depending on where the supply sits, if it's with the team or investors, or if it's in the Dow treasury, it means different things in terms of how available that supply is. And one of the things that at least I've been thinking about for a while, but you guys, I'm sure, have more sophisticated thoughts on me just being vcs, is that I'm not really sure. It feels like with this whole idea, if you launch day one and all the tokens that you're ever going to have exist, maybe that's not really the best dynamic, actually. And the way that funding works in a more traditional startup has better outcomes for everyone. And I tried to draw this out actually in a really simplified chart just to even make it make sense in my own head. So the difference basically being for an early stage startup, yeah, you basically go through different stages where new tranches of equity are issued.
00:37:13.794 - 00:37:48.334, Speaker C: So you can see my screen here. What you're show is like a really simplified version of what this looks like from a company standpoint where, let's assume there's a valuation metric here, which is like year one, year two, year three, year four, year five. Let's just assume all of the metrics that you need to hit to raise to continue to grow your valuation are being hit and there's 100,000 shares at a million dollars in the first year. You kind of keep doubling the valuation year over year. Again, really simplified. You break it down by investor shares and team shares. And you assume that every year when you're raising, you top up the amount of team shares.
00:37:48.334 - 00:37:50.466, Speaker C: Like you increase the amount in your.
00:37:50.488 - 00:37:51.666, Speaker B: Equity pool and that you have to.
00:37:51.688 - 00:38:34.110, Speaker C: Sell 20% of the company, roughly. This is what the share price ends up looking like. And price discovery happens by this overall total amount of shares and a valuation which is set in the private markets by investors directly with a team. And that has this kind of desirable impact. Assuming you don't fuck everything up and have to do a down round, which is obviously brutal in this situation, then this kind of goes up in this up only pattern in the private markets and in protocols, it's just really different. There are very different sources of where those tokens ultimately end up sitting. Like, some of it goes towards the team, some of it goes towards investors, and then there's us.
00:38:34.110 - 00:39:12.510, Speaker C: And these are kind of like the combination of insider tokens, which is good to have, right? You want to have investors and team incentivized, but ultimately what ends up happening even with the same amount of tokens and the same intrinsic valuation is now you've moved price discovery off of this $100,000 number into a much smaller number of actually circulating tokens, which is really like the community portion of this, and maybe some Dow tokens. And what you end up with is this kind of crazy price per token because you're pricing this based off a really small amount of what's circulating.
00:39:12.930 - 00:40:28.130, Speaker A: Basically the mechanism for. Yeah, I see what you're saying and let me just explain it from maybe our perspective, or definitely my perspective, which is the pricing never happens based off of market cap and intrinsic valuation, which is how it's modeled out here. The price is always based off of the FDV, especially when you're talking about something that is pre launch. Like the way I look at Coingecko or any of these different protocol pages or price pages is I look at the token price and then I look at the FTV and then I back into via the market cap, how much of the tokens are actually tradable. And that's the only thing I look at from a market cap perspective. And then it's sort of like, okay, what are the token allocations? So the token value for me is always, what is the FDB? And another thing, in terms of the mechanisms here, there is a major fundamental difference between building a protocol versus building a company and a company. And we can get into all the details around this, but one of the things that I think goes undervalued in this context is when you're building a company and you have no desire to build a protocol, it's all about control.
00:40:28.130 - 00:41:02.238, Speaker A: How many shares do you, how much ownership do you have? And if you're a venture capitalist, really good vcs will say, I need to own 20% of the company. For me to be able to be like the institutional backer of this business. Good ceos will say, okay, great, I want to own an equal amount. The co founder should be owning that much as well. Dilution. It depends on the company and the business model, et cetera, and the capital requirements to get there. But ownership is really what people care about, because that dictates who controls the company going forward.
00:41:02.238 - 00:42:00.690, Speaker A: Whereas if you talk to founders of protocols, and if you talk to people who are building protocols, literally the opposite. It is the Vitalik Buterin. I eventually need to turn this over to a decentralized community, and it needs to be a self sustaining, open source protocol going forward. And that difference, I think, belies a lot of the funding mechanisms and sort of the reasoning behind why. If we're an investor in a protocol, 5% is kind of the rough target that we have for ownership, because we want to be a participant, we want to be a steward, we want to engage in the protocol. But if you're overwhelming majority of the token, especially from the investor allocation, there's questions of decentralization, there's questions of motive. It is a totally fundamentally different way of fundraising, but also governing and running these different types of entities that I think lead to these bisecting directions.
00:42:02.070 - 00:42:55.838, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's a really good point. The whole point of decentralization is that if you're a protocol, you have new use cases that are available to you that you wouldn't if you were in a company structure. And a really easy sort of heuristic for that is like we trust bitcoin or eth to be form of money because it's really decentralized, no one controls it. Google is an extremely competent company, makes a ton of money. Would you trust them to issue a currency? No, you wouldn't, because for obvious reasons that are super apparent. So I think I completely agree with you on that, Michael. I guess the point that I was kind of trying to make sense of myself, and again, just like, I just put this together late last night, so I didn't think too much about it, but basically, I think the reason why you've seen so many charts like this in crypto, so we're talking about ICP or whatever that protocol definitive is called now, but there are tons of charts like this of really good protocols.
00:42:55.838 - 00:43:40.754, Speaker C: If you look at some of the DFI 1.0, like Uniswap or some of those, those are down like 90% from their all time highs. And it's not some of them, it's like most of them are like that. Uniswap ave like great protocols. And I think it has to do with this dynamic of the price discovery changes from private market investors to something that looks like, and it sounds like you guys don't think about it like this, but I do think that a lot of traders end up do thinking like market cap in the short term, which is extremely constricted in terms of the float. But then over time, investors sell and the team sells as their unlocks happen. And so you're kind of flooding the market at the worst possible time.
00:43:40.754 - 00:44:47.640, Speaker C: And the other thing that's a little bit different in between protocols and companies is protocols try to pay for things in their token, which is a little bit, I know that happens a little bit in Silicon Valley, but it doesn't happen nearly to the same degree that there's a dow treasury with your token, and blockworks often receives payment from protocols with token. And so there's just this kind of dumping mechanism. And the other thing I think that I was thinking about as we were going through this is it actually makes sense to me that there should be some sort of liquidity premium on these tokens. Like one of the things that kind of sucks about owning startup equity is that you don't have access to sell it for sometimes a long period of time, and you as an employee especially have no window in terms of when that's going to be. So a token being liquid on day one, all else being equal, assuming, yeah, cetera's parboost, the token should be worth more because you can sell it today, and you can see that a lot of employees don't end up valuing equity, but tokens are a huge vehicle or lever to acquire talent during these periods of time.
00:44:50.110 - 00:45:58.798, Speaker A: I have a thesis, a pretty strong thesis, over the last five years, and I think it's been pretty much proven at this point that the steady state price to earnings, if we want to call it that protocol revenue that's distributed to the token holders, the cash flow that's generated by these protocols, the steady state ratio for networks versus companies is going to be a multiple higher for networks for this exact reason. And it's just very simple in the fact that there are multivariate variate reasons why people would want to hold the token. Maybe it's for governance rights, maybe it's for staking capabilities, maybe it's just for the cash flows. Maybe it's for x, y, or z. Plus you layer on the liquidity premium that you're describing, Mike, and you compare that to any private equity or startup stock, and there's no comparison in terms of how you should be valuing this, even in a public sense. Imagine if you can take your Apple shares and stake them to earn some additional governance rights in Apple, or participate in a different way in the Apple ecosystem. That's kind of what we're talking about here.
00:45:58.798 - 00:46:01.280, Speaker A: When you have a digital asset that's based in.
00:46:04.370 - 00:46:28.440, Speaker C: It'S just. It's a little bit of. Honestly, even just trying to think through this, it's kind of dangerous to do live on a podcast. Just put my brain in a pretzel a little bit. But I'm trying to describe why there are these common. If you look at the chart for even protocols that I think are great, it fits this pattern, like this early kind of pump, and then they have to work through this weird supply overhang that they give themselves. And the reason why I feel like it's relevant even talking about these l two s.
00:46:28.440 - 00:46:44.366, Speaker C: I hear you, Vance, on the someone's going to have to buy up all this arbitrum, but it doesn't feel like we're really changing the dynamic for even the new l two s that are launching. So, yeah, they look cheaper now, but they're going to end up with the same issue that everyone else ends up facing at some point, right?
00:46:44.548 - 00:47:30.746, Speaker D: We aren't. And I don't think these are answerable questions to some extent. It kind of depends on what the asset is. Eth went from, I forget what it was after the Dow hack, but it went from maybe ten to back to a dollar 40, and it was just like, fuck, this is over. And now it's at 3000. But most assets don't have that because most assets are not singular in that way. And so what you need to ask yourself is like, am I a thesis long investor in starkware at 20,000,000,002 months before investor unlocks? If so, why? And if you can answer that question and get right with yourself, you should hold it.
00:47:30.746 - 00:47:55.490, Speaker D: But if you can't, you probably should think a little bit more holistically about what you're investing in. Because it's not just like I get to buy a meme coin and it will outpace the crypto market by ten x anymore. I think we're just in a much different environment today than we are even like a few years ago. There's just way more coins, there's way more of them to be sold, and there needs to be way more buying to keep them at the same prices.
00:47:56.470 - 00:48:33.040, Speaker C: What do you guys think about the idea that I've seen like Delphi has pushed for this a little bit, and you see a little bit of it here and there on Twitter, which is sort of this return of icos. What do you guys think about that? And I know the last thing I'll say here is the regulatory overhang of doing this is extremely challenging, and there's probably a good reason. There's a lot of shenanigans that happen in the ICO era. Just the idea being that if you launch to the community that everyone gets a sort of fairer shake at it. And this is sort of what I guess Kobe's maybe trying to do potentially, but yeah. What do you guys think about this sort of return of icos type thing?
00:48:33.410 - 00:49:11.280, Speaker D: It's going to be hard for Michael or I to disavow icos. Back in the day, this is what we did and this is what allowed us to be capitalized and really start framework. And so to the extent that people are going to be doing things like this, I don't know. I don't feel like we can really pass judgment on people speculating on icos just because it was such an amazing opportunity for us, as is a lot of crypto. From a developer perspective or a project perspective, if you're doing an ICO in this day and age, you are taking risk. You should get right with yourself and understand that. And if you're outside the US, maybe it's different.
00:49:11.280 - 00:49:55.820, Speaker D: I prefer things like fair launches, and those seem like kind of a better crack at financial opportunity for a lot of people. But we are now getting in the cycle, in the part of the cycle where the stakes are high enough that people are going to do stuff like this. You're not going to do a bear market ICO. The legal risks outweigh the financial rewards that you are potentially going to reap. But now it's like people can put $100 million into an ICO and the project raises that and the token goes nuts and it's like worth it. You can fight the SEC or fight the lawsuits or whatever. So these things are going to happen.
00:49:55.820 - 00:50:08.080, Speaker D: I just think you have a natural selection bias that best projects do, not ICO. But if Kobe does things like the project he's up to. I think that can help a lot, which is cool.
00:50:10.770 - 00:50:35.110, Speaker A: There are so many different flavors of what can be determined to be an ICO. It's really hard to just plaster one perspective across the entire. I mean, you could do on one end the total, like, summer 2017. Here's an Ethereum address. Sendy. We'll send you back tokens. I don't see that necessarily happening that often, if ever, really anymore.
00:50:35.110 - 00:51:00.110, Speaker A: And you could also do the intermediate step of geogating. Right. That can definitely help in an argument. There's also things like twin list, and we have portfolio companies that have recently done twin list sales. Everyone's Kyc. You're not able to buy a certain amount, you get distribution into the hands of potential customers, notoriety. It solves a lot of problems.
00:51:00.110 - 00:51:36.940, Speaker A: You have the fundraise for the business. There are a lot of different flavors of token sales to individual community members. And then there's also, I mean, we obviously talked about this a lot, but like airdrops, novel mechanisms of doing points programs can get a lot of the same effect. Minus the fundraise, where you get your token in the hands of a number of different people, you force them usually to do something of value for the protocol by participating in some way, shape or form. And I would just get creative in terms of the relative risk reward of whatever it is that you're doing.
00:51:38.830 - 00:51:41.230, Speaker D: Try not to break any laws if you can.
00:51:41.300 - 00:51:45.214, Speaker A: Yeah, consult counsel wherever possible, please.
00:51:45.332 - 00:52:18.406, Speaker C: Yeah, I agree with you. I think that the biggest question for me is, like, the adverse selection problem. This is a really known issue with platforms like Kickstarter in the past, and the idea is, if you have a high caliber founder, you'd want to partner with the frameworks of the world, right, instead of 10,000 random dentists, because you guys provide a lot of value. So I think that's the ultimate challenge with it. And there's an optic standpoint. There's like a whole bunch of standpoints or considerations from the founder standpoint, one doesn't preclude the other.
00:52:18.508 - 00:52:28.138, Speaker A: And I think this is kind of the main point. I think you can work with the frameworks of the world and do a distribution to community members, and I think that that is what the playbook should be.
00:52:28.304 - 00:53:09.020, Speaker C: That's what I was going to say, is, yeah, it doesn't have to be totally binary, and you could even imagine there are really high value community members out there, and people kind of do this with angeling right now, but you could have even one layer more on that spectrum instead of institutional kind of vc money here, angels here, and then like high caliber community participants that maybe aren't angels because they don't meet a certain monetary threshold or whatever. But you could, even if there is some kind of platform, you could take a test or submit proof of your contribution on the forum for however long, and maybe that could get you some sort of preferential allocation or something like that. I don't know. There are lots of different flavors to this. I totally agree.
00:53:10.430 - 00:53:53.000, Speaker D: Let's move on to 4844 and this bitcoin tweet from bellagi. Unfortunately for him, bitcoin did not go to a million in two weeks time. But he just tweeted out, bitcoin has passed all time highs in 14 different countries. I think this is actually pretty interesting just because obviously the numbers that I'm keeping track of are the IbIt all time high. We're $29 on Ibit all time high for Ibit is 31. So that'll be a moment. There's obviously the USD all time high, which is, I think, 69,000.
00:53:53.000 - 00:54:27.010, Speaker D: But meanwhile, 14 different countries, you've got bitcoin at all time highs, including both the japanese yen and then chinese rememb. It's just really impressive that most of these countries are kind of like living in the future where the bull market all time high has been broken. Kind of gives you a little bit of, I don't know, we could kind of see the international side of things pick up just based on more euphoria from the all time highs.
00:54:29.190 - 00:54:54.442, Speaker C: I like that take a lot. And I've seen some people on Twitter respond to this, like, well, if you looked at the know, it would look very similar. And it's like, yeah, but these people, they can't buy the S p. They can buy bitcoin. That's the whole point. So, yeah, I think it's a super interesting take. And even if Bellaji didn't end up being right, I think he was kind of trying know, flash the bat symbol type thing for bitcoin, and I think he ended up doing that.
00:54:54.576 - 00:55:05.600, Speaker D: Belagi is laughing all the way to the bank. The dude has more coin than I think anybody knows about. So whether it goes to a million today or in ten years, he's good.
00:55:06.130 - 00:55:40.730, Speaker C: Yeah. What do you guys think about? So could you give an update on 4844 and just Dankun in general? What is the sort of expected timeline there? And then I think people are very curious about what is going to. There's the 4844. There are lots of different sort of eips that are lumped in with the hard fork. But 4844 is the protodank sharding part of it. And that should immediately make some of the DA costs for roll ups cheaper. So what are your guys thoughts overall about 4844 as a catalyst? And then how much do you think it's going to impact things on the DA cost side for roll ups?
00:55:41.550 - 00:56:57.566, Speaker D: So Denkun is March 13 and it looks like it's going to decrease Da somewhere between five and ten x for l two s. So that'll be pretty significant in terms of that cost. And it kind of sits kind of opposite from a celestia in terms of narrative, where if those things are roughly the same, maybe you kind of see the modular thesis slow down a little bit in terms of why would you switch da layers if they're roughly cost effective? I think the stuff that we see on the private side is there's a lot of l two s that are waiting to launch. And so whatever cost offset you have in terms of fees not coming to Eth, you're going to have more supply of l two s launching and using things like 4844 for Da. And so I think you're just going to see an increasing amount of l two s launch, and we're already seeing a ton. But think of March 13 as the starting gun for all these l two s to launch. Then you have Eigen layer probably sometime in Q two with all the abs launching and restaking launching.
00:56:57.566 - 00:57:12.166, Speaker D: It just feels like there's so many catalysts right now for ETH, specifically on the technical side, and developers are going to take advantage of that. So I think it's positive overall, kind of something we've been waiting for, for I think like a year at this point.
00:57:12.268 - 00:57:31.770, Speaker A: There's also a number of other changes that are getting closer and closer that are going to be in the next hard fork, which is looking like it could be later this year as well. And some of those start to even get closer and closer to kind of the full Dane sharding concepts.
00:57:32.350 - 00:57:36.350, Speaker C: Yeah. And that next hard fork, that's electra, right?
00:57:36.500 - 00:57:37.246, Speaker A: I think.
00:57:37.348 - 00:57:38.318, Speaker D: I can't remember the name.
00:57:38.404 - 00:57:41.870, Speaker A: When is that still being discussed?
00:57:42.390 - 00:57:49.940, Speaker C: Yeah, I thought it was. Well, the reason I was sort of paying attention to it is because they're talking about adding a.
00:57:51.670 - 00:57:53.090, Speaker A: Big decent change.
00:57:53.160 - 00:58:34.046, Speaker C: To Eth's issuance policy. I'm not sure if you guys saw this, but there was a big thread that came out today by some of the folks from the Ethereum foundation. It actually might be worth getting your guys take on here because it's a pretty meaningful change to the protocol if this does end up getting implemented. And I know the EF has been, or some folks from the EF have been kind of interested in this and talking about it, but the idea is to adjust the issuance policy of Ethereum to target a certain percentage of stake. And specifically in this proposal, there would be something that looks ultimately like a hard cap for stake that comes in at once. 25% of the network is staked. Then there's actually negative issuance policy.
00:58:34.046 - 00:59:26.126, Speaker C: So if you are staking and more than 25% of ETH in the network has been staked, you're actually losing your ETH balance is going down. And the rationale for this mostly has to do with liquid staking. And there's a push pull here in between. One, you could argue that at a certain point, the network doesn't really need much more security after a certain amount has been staked. And then if there is a whole bunch more staking, and specifically in Eth, Lido, the steeth is issued by Lido, which is very separate from Ethereum, the protocol. And Ethereum doesn't have a lot of great ways to regulate that, then steeth could start to compete with actually the money ness. Quote of there are some, there are some risks that are associated with that, right? Like Lido is a great team.
00:59:26.126 - 00:59:46.470, Speaker C: They put a lot of their internal dev resources towards decentralizing and making sure there are no bugs and stuff like that. But you can never really be not, it's not as safe as ethereum, the protocol. So what would you guys think about this policy of adjusting the issuance of Ethereum to actually target or sort of cap the percentage of ethic it's staked?
00:59:49.310 - 01:00:36.486, Speaker D: I mean, the negative issuance, I don't frankly like, and this is such a substantial change that I think this is probably going to be like a multi year discussion. And the Lido team published something that's kind of like on the opposite side of this. And there's a lot of LST oriented teams that are obviously on the other side of this. And so the question is, is it like the EF, or is it like the broader community who has a lot of interest in staking? Who's going to dictate this trend? And I don't think targeting 25% staking when we're already well north of that makes a ton of sense. So that number doesn't seem right. I frankly need to read more. I need to read this before I can respond to it.
01:00:36.486 - 01:00:46.438, Speaker D: So maybe we can do, like, a session on this next time. Don't want to prejudge this work, and I know the guy who wrote this, and he's smart, so want to kind of give him his due.
01:00:46.614 - 01:01:35.510, Speaker C: I don't know, Michael. We don't have to go too deep. I mean, we can cover it next week. I've been thinking about this a lot because we staking is like, we talked about that quite a bit on last week's show, and there's a lot of money that's going into that, be it for new yield, or maybe it's farming eigen points or tokens in the meantime. But the one worry that I have with capping the amount of issuance is that I think it might do the opposite of what this proposal is intended to do, and it might actually push people further along the risk curve into more restaking opportunities. This is kind of the dynamic about how it works in tradfi with interest rates, right? It's like, if you lower the interest rate, you are actually encouraging people to take more risk, right. People don't just say, oh, well, I guess I'm going to earn less yield than I was earning.
01:01:35.510 - 01:01:52.206, Speaker C: They're like, no, I need to earn the same amount of yield, and now I need to go into riskier and riskier opportunities. I worry a little bit. Just that it could backfire is the only concern that I have. It's pretty bullish Eigen layer if this ends up happening, but bullish restaking in.
01:01:52.228 - 01:02:07.560, Speaker D: General, I think you're going to see a plurality of approaches, not just Eigen layer, if something like this especially kind of happens, where you're going to see people yellowing eth all over the place, which has negative effects, obviously.
01:02:09.050 - 01:02:27.866, Speaker C: All right, we've probably got time for one more thing. We can either talk about gauntlet leaving Aave, Athena. Everyone's kind of been giving their takes on Athena, the stablecoin or vault or whatever they are. And then coindesk actually wrote a really great op ed on the vibe shift that's going on. Which one do you guys want to close with?
01:02:27.968 - 01:02:31.040, Speaker D: Let's talk Gauntlet. I feel like the Athena takes have been.
01:02:34.370 - 01:03:08.402, Speaker C: Yeah. All right, I'll tee it up. So, Gauntlet, obviously, they are one of the oldest and I'd say most respected sort of service providers on the Dow side of things in crypto. Most of what they do is sort of risk analysis and mitigation for protocols. And Aave, it's just one of their longest standing, at least on the outside. Kind of strongest relationships. Yesterday in the forum, they basically released this post saying, hey, unfortunately we are terminating our relationship with Ave, the protocol.
01:03:08.402 - 01:03:48.738, Speaker C: And I guess they were in the middle of a year long, roughly $1.6 million contract. So I'm not really sure what that looks like from a contractual standpoint or what they're going to have to do, but they cited a couple of reasons. But what it seems like, and again, not an insider on anything here, is that there were some disagreements in between Gauntlet and Mark Zeller over at Ave. And Mark is an extremely active, pretty prolific delegate who's done a lot of great things for the protocol. Definitely also has a lot of control on the aave side of things. And it almost kind of sounded like, yeah, they just were at ods from a personal standpoint.
01:03:48.738 - 01:03:55.720, Speaker C: And I'd be curious on where you guys shook out on this whole thing.
01:03:57.050 - 01:04:35.522, Speaker D: I mean, it's a big contract to sever, which is kind of surprising. And I think Gauntlet has done good work for Ave. There's some stuff that we've disagreed with. Like we thought they should have been a little bit heavier handed on allowing Mishka from curve to borrow 50, 60, $70 million from Ave. Like, probably not doing your job well, but I do think these risk scoring consultancies are helpful. But at the end of the day, dows are closely held and they're controlled by people who have tokens. And if they don't want you there, you're kind of done.
01:04:35.522 - 01:04:46.806, Speaker D: So I don't know. I like Tarun. I like Aave. I do think that there's things that they could have done better in the past, but bygones are bygones at this.
01:04:46.828 - 01:04:53.130, Speaker A: .1 point of clarification, maybe I missed this. Who severed the contract?
01:04:54.750 - 01:05:22.980, Speaker C: It was from the gauntlet side. So there was a post. Not a particularly long post, just. It was from John Morrow, who I don't know personally, but I guess he's one of the co founders at Gauntlet and just know. Basically paraphrasing here, we've loved working with Ave in the past, but Gauntlet is no longer able to continue our work with Aave and we're terminating our payment stream as soon as possible and looking to find a replacement for the risk steward position, which is what they held right.
01:05:23.430 - 01:05:33.720, Speaker A: Which know in a lot of ways the service provider firing you as a client is not something that typically happens very often.
01:05:36.730 - 01:05:40.060, Speaker D: I'm firing myself. I'll see myself out.
01:05:42.030 - 01:05:42.780, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:05:45.150 - 01:05:46.794, Speaker D: I think it does highlight, just.
01:05:46.832 - 01:07:06.254, Speaker A: Like dows are not in 2021 it was, okay, we're going to figure out token economics, then we're just going to wave this magic wand. Governance is going to be solved as well. Governance has taken countries who have all the resources in the world, hundreds of years to be able to ossify and get to a point of solidity that actually really has the effect, the intentions that they started with. And I think when you have a dow of governance participants that probably aren't experts in risk analysis and parameterization, and there's a lot of politicking involved, it does make for who's actually controlling these things as a major question. It's kind of like saying if you have a bunch of people who own shares in a business, who are the people representing those people? And whatever percentage it is I can't remember off top of my head is now of like the SB 500 is now owned by index funds. Well, who's actually voting with those shares? In many cases, it is the index providers themselves, the vanguards, Fidelity's of the world, who are taking those shares and voting them on behalf of every 401 owner of Apple stock. Let's say they're educated.
01:07:06.254 - 01:07:23.930, Speaker A: They know it's sort of like a representative democracy in a lot of ways, but that's not how a lot of these dows are structured. And that you do have the random ave token whale who has the ability to sway votes and that can get problematic.
01:07:25.470 - 01:07:57.362, Speaker D: Last thing before we wrap, different topic. So Circle has discontinued support for USDC on TrON. This was always one of the weirder things that was going on in crypto that Michael and I had no idea what the true story was. There's like 3 billion or 4 billion of stablecoins or staked USDT on TrON. It's like moving around a lot. There's a lot of people using it, allegedly. And Circle has apparently decided that this is no longer legitimate.
01:07:57.362 - 01:08:17.690, Speaker D: They will not support it. They're going to remove support. I think there's going to be another shoe to drop here, basically. Like there's the ongoing Justin sun lawsuit. There's a lot of sketchy stuff happening on Tron. Maybe next week we'll have a little bit more clarity. But this is a big deal.
01:08:17.690 - 01:08:23.290, Speaker D: In stablecoin land, it's probably four or five or 6% of total stables outstanding.
01:08:23.450 - 01:08:57.686, Speaker A: Well, USDT is the primary stable coin on TroN. And that's where 60 70% of USDT exists. And I think that that's like the preferred payment for a lot of non us rest of world countries like Turkey. Tron is how people pay Tron. Specifically USDT on TrON is mechanism of payment. We don't need to stoke the fire of lawsuits. But I can see that.
01:08:57.686 - 01:09:14.926, Speaker A: I could also just know USDC circle being like, hey, we were linkless. This network, not something that we need to venture, you know, keep in mind, Circle is trying to get ready for an ipo later this year. Supposedly forgot about that.
01:09:15.108 - 01:09:31.522, Speaker C: Dude, I have just never understood tether. It's just been such a question mark for me, and I'm not sure if I have any intelligent opinions on it. I don't know. We'll see. I wouldn't be surprised at that prediction, Vance. But I have no. So.
01:09:31.522 - 01:09:33.218, Speaker C: But it's a good call.
01:09:33.384 - 01:09:45.830, Speaker D: Back in the day, I shorted tether on Bitmex when I was living in Tokyo. Immediately got liquidated. And then my girlfriend broke up with me. I've stopped trying to understand what's going on with tether.
01:09:46.330 - 01:09:47.640, Speaker C: What will make your.
01:09:52.330 - 01:10:02.330, Speaker A: Asked? I was asking, did the trade get put out? Basically, like, did the trade happen? And before Vance even responded that the trade is live, it was liquidated.
01:10:02.830 - 01:10:07.550, Speaker D: It was then. And then she bounced.
01:10:08.930 - 01:10:20.562, Speaker C: She saw your trade and was like, nah, she was out. There's a must, boy. All right, fellas, this one was a really fun one. See here, same time.
01:10:20.696 - 01:10:42.502, Speaker B: Hey, everyone. Mike here. If you're a bell curve listener, you know that transferring assets across chains can be a massive pain. I certainly do. I complain about it on this program all the time. That is why we are incredibly excited to have teamed up with the wormhole foundation, the stewards of the wormhole protocol. And the coolest part about this particular partnership is that they have made custom bell curve nfts, which you can get and mint for free.
