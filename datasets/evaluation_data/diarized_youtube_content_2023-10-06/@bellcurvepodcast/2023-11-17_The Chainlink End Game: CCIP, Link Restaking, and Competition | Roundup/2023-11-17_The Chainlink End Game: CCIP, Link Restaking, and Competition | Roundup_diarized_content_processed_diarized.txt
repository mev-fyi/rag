00:00:00.170 - 00:00:24.350, Speaker A: Alright, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Before we jump in, quick disclaimer. The views expressed by my co host today are their personal views and they do not represent the views of any organization with which the co hosts are associated with. Nothing in the episode is construed or relied upon as financial, technical, tax, legal or other advice. You know the deal. Now let's jump into the episode.
00:00:24.890 - 00:00:51.130, Speaker B: It so it's easy to expand the scope of services that you use all in one location with the same economic layer, the same time tested security and proven reliability, the high quality nodes like framework helping secure the network. You basically have all the services that you need. So right now it's data compute cross Chain, but in the future it could expand to any service that a blockchain doesn't or can't provide. So it's a really massive scope beyond what I think a lot of people realize Chainlink is doing.
00:00:51.200 - 00:01:27.814, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment, but before we do, I want to share something that Blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of Crypto. Goldman, JPMorgan, Zero, 72, all in one room. So you can know what the big money is doing. So click the link at the bottom of this episode, it'll take you right over to the homepage and use Bell 20 for 20% off and I will see you in sunny London town in March. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup edition of Bell Curve. You got me and Vance, and we've got a very special guest with us here who is a Chainlink god, CLG, Vance.
00:01:27.814 - 00:01:29.114, Speaker A: Welcome to the show, guys.
00:01:29.312 - 00:01:30.858, Speaker B: Hey, thanks for having me.
00:01:30.944 - 00:01:34.570, Speaker C: Good to be here. Good to be here with CLG. The notorious.
00:01:36.430 - 00:02:13.926, Speaker A: Notorious CLG. Yeah, I thought this would be a fun episode to put together because Chainlink has been doing super well recently. Vance, you kind of talked about how we haven't covered Chainlink probably as much as it deserves. CCIP feels like a really big deal. The RWA narrative is taking off and it feels like Chainlink plays a super important role there. So we kind of brought Chainlink god on here to ask a whole bunch of questions about Chainlink. And the first one that I have, actually, for both of you, because I know Vance, you and Michael were involved in Chainlink way back in the early formative days, and I kind of wanted to get a the before.
00:02:13.926 - 00:02:47.200, Speaker A: We even get into the intricacies of how chainlink works and CCIP and real world assets and all of that good stuff is I want to get a sense of how this community formed. Like the Link marines are one of the strongest communities, I would say, in all of Crypto. And I've kind of just taken that for granted that that exists. But it's been incredible, I think, for Chainlink, the brand. So I'd just be curious, how did this end up getting formed back in the day? Like CLG, what made you devote your Twitter life's work to the good fellows at Link? How did this all get started?
00:02:47.970 - 00:03:27.674, Speaker B: Yeah, I guess like some initial context, like the company behind Chainlink, Chainlink Labs, they used to be known as smart contract, and they were building a centralized Oracle service back in 2014. It's kind of like a full stack solution, but once Ethereum came out, it's pretty obvious that's where most of the contracts themselves would execute. But there was still like this gaping hole of if you don't solve the Oracle blockchain problem of the stack. So smart contracts can't connect to external resources, then smart contracts can't realistically do all that much. You can move tokens, you can mint tokens, you can swap tokens. But any real world smart contract use case is going to need some kind of input and output to that contract to be useful. So that's fundamentally what Chainlink was aiming to solve.
00:03:27.674 - 00:04:14.666, Speaker B: And during the very early days, like the 2017 White Paper and Token sale, the team was very heads down building. They didn't do any marketing. It kind of kind of became a meme at one point where they had like, maybe a couple of tweets in 2018 in total, basically. So the community at that point was just like it was completely organically grown on biz and a couple of other forms of just the vision itself. If you look at some of the connections that Chanlink had at the time with Swift and some of the other institutions they did POCs with, and you look at the problem scope that they're trying to solve and how smart contracts exist at the time, this was before DeFi. It was kind of obvious if smart contracts were going to be useful at scale, they were going to need the services provided by Chain, like the data inputs, the data outputs, and all the services provided thereafter. So I think a lot of the community just saw that vision.
00:04:14.666 - 00:05:04.782, Speaker B: They saw Sergey's very clear and consistent vision over the years of how cryptographic guarantees are fundamentally better than paper promises and creating this Internet of contracts will improve. And that's kind of what grabbed me initially as well, as well as just kind of thinking through, what does an institutional smart contract require? Right? You need connectivity to back end systems. You need data inputs like weather for insurance. You need to be able to trigger things in the real world, like payments. And if you don't have all the external services, then you just have this contract in the middle that is a token, but doesn't really do anything itself. So I think Chainlink was like ten years ahead the rest of the industry when it first came out, and there was like this core group of people who kind of saw that vision and then was just like, basically all in on that vision. And once it clicked for me, because everyone kind of has that moment where it clicks, then it's like, okay, this is so obvious.
00:05:04.782 - 00:05:12.906, Speaker B: But this is when Chainlink was like a white paper at the you know, it's kind of unimaginable to see how it's grown to it's.
00:05:12.938 - 00:05:39.062, Speaker C: Uh, this was also a time where Coinbase only had I think it was bitcoin and litecoin and like, ETH wasn't even on there. And so the idea that Link would be this big or this prolific or this developed was definitely far fetched. Michael and I discovered Chainlink when Ari Jules wrote Town Crier and we read that white paper and that was kind of like the Seminole. And I think it was before the ICO when that happened.
00:05:39.116 - 00:05:41.358, Speaker D: Yeah, it was May 2017.
00:05:41.554 - 00:06:00.814, Speaker C: Yeah, May 2017. And then there was an ICO. And michael and I were like, ICO whales. I think we did research at one point to understand who was bigger than us. I think we were one of the larger address recipients. The ICO was a very funny, very kind of haphazard thing that happened. But I think we did that.
00:06:00.814 - 00:06:40.394, Speaker C: And literally, when CLG says All In, it was like, for a while, 99% of our net worth was literally Chain Link. And we still hold and have Chain link a significant amount, and we still run nodes, and we talk to Sergey and help the network and basically have all of our portfolio companies use their Oracle. So we're definitely still there. But I feel like we were much younger at this point, even though this was only like six years ago or whatever. We just would hang out on Four Chan. The other funny part was like, Chain Link got said chainlink not talking to the community for a year before, and there wasn't much to talk about. That product wasn't even launched.
00:06:40.394 - 00:07:12.466, Speaker C: But them not talking to the community left the community to its own devices on Four Chan Syndrome. Yeah, there was a day where someone said that because nobody was talking to us, somebody said that it was over. It was truly like iron sharpening iron in the Four Chan Biz forum. And whoever came out of that was just left with a lot of Chain link and probably some form of mental illness.
00:07:12.578 - 00:07:14.054, Speaker B: No, it wasn't was.
00:07:14.092 - 00:07:15.240, Speaker D: It was all in.
00:07:16.970 - 00:07:19.658, Speaker C: Mean. There was biz, there was slack. There's a lot of places where it.
00:07:19.664 - 00:07:30.246, Speaker D: Was, but like, the community was hanging out, literally, rory was hanging out in Slack all the time. This is back even like pre dis ward for crypto projects.
00:07:30.358 - 00:07:59.718, Speaker B: This is like a unique place because it's just everything floats on ideas alone. There's no identity. Anything that's mimatic and sticky goes to a gauntlet, basically, of everyone trying to tear it apart and no team communication. People just thinking about Oracles. And then a guy named as Blaster comes in posting these threads about institutional use cases. And nobody was supposed to know about this project. It was all just the community just going through these breadcrumbs, like these really long look at these screenshots from presentation Sergey did in 2015.
00:07:59.718 - 00:08:02.454, Speaker B: Look at these logos. And it was exciting. It was fun.
00:08:02.492 - 00:08:03.720, Speaker D: It always has been.
00:08:04.410 - 00:08:08.854, Speaker C: Yeah. GLG, do you remember any memes in particular from that time?
00:08:09.052 - 00:08:17.146, Speaker B: There were a few. There was, like, FUD that Chain links just to Jason Parser. People are like, oh, yeah, jason Parser. He's the guy on the team.
00:08:17.248 - 00:08:28.830, Speaker D: I completely forgot about Jason Parser. I mean, my favorite was always just like, hey, Bib, how'd you make all this money? Guy named Ask Blaster Five on Biz.
00:08:33.570 - 00:09:16.346, Speaker A: It's just funny. Yano and I joined crypto in 2017, and one of the first things that he bought because some guy that was sitting next to him at his desk told him was this thing called Link. And I think it was Jason's best ever investment in his entire crypto career. He just held onto that little bag. But it sort of feels like Chain Link maybe do this organic way of this, almost like duking it out on these four chan sort of forums and having Sergey, who's a pretty charismatic, I would say, and very unique sort of founder that kind of gets people to follow him. But however this funny cocktail happened, chainlink has this community that most crypto companies, I feel like would die for. Like it has these link marines.
00:09:16.346 - 00:09:39.298, Speaker A: And I actually remember back in, I don't know, 2018 or something like that, we used to work with Pomp and his podcast and help get it off the ground. And we had a bunch of guests on, like, big guests, like Mike Novograts. They would always do, like, pretty good. And we had Sergey on, and I had never heard of him. And it did like, five X every download. We were like, what is this? It was like the marines, dude. The Marines.
00:09:39.298 - 00:09:40.790, Speaker A: It's just incredible.
00:09:43.050 - 00:09:46.566, Speaker D: Sergey Nazarov might be Satoshi Nakamoto. You never know.
00:09:46.748 - 00:09:51.914, Speaker A: Wait, didn't he file a patent for a smart contract, like, a couple days before?
00:09:52.032 - 00:10:10.430, Speaker D: Well, so all the website addresses for the token sale, and I think it was still pointing at Chain Link for a while, was SmartContract.com, which was registered two months after the Bitcoin White Paper was created.
00:10:11.250 - 00:10:20.740, Speaker C: CLG, what do you do for Chainlink now? You're kind of like informal community band member, band leader. What do you do for Chainlink? At the moment?
00:10:21.270 - 00:10:50.906, Speaker B: Yeah, it's kind of like a bucket of community ambassadorship, which is really just content creation. So I basically try there's so much information asymmetry about Chainlink even now. There was a whole lot in 2020 when people just first heard about Chainlink. But even now, people think Chain Link is just price feeds, or they think it's just doing this. So I try to create as much content as I can, just trying to break down the information asymmetry. So I do some podcasts sometimes, I write some blogs, I write tweets, but basically just trying to educate the community however best I can. It's a kind of multi content approach, I think.
00:10:50.906 - 00:10:59.200, Speaker B: But there's always going to be more and more people who are just beginning their journey learning about Oracles and there's always going to be plenty of the same questions that I'm happy to answer.
00:10:59.890 - 00:11:14.100, Speaker A: Cool, well, you were actually starting to get into this before we dragged you back into the four Chan forum days, but can you just give folks sort of an overview of what chainlink is and then we can get into the nitty gritty of what Oracle networks are?
00:11:14.710 - 00:11:53.594, Speaker B: Yeah, so at a high level I kind of mentioned this, but blockchains and smart contracts are super secure at verifying and validating transactions. But that's what they're isolated to, that's their security model, so they can't connect to external systems. So you need another system, Oracles, to connect those smart contracts to external resources. But the Oracles have to be decentralized in the same manner that the blockchain is. Otherwise you have a single point of failure. So chainlink itself is effectively this framework for building decentralized Oracle networks. There's about a thousand chainlink Oracle networks live right now and it spans not only external data like price feeds, which is what chainlink is most well known for, but also things like off chain computation as well as cross chain interoperability.
00:11:53.594 - 00:12:38.878, Speaker B: So it's these platform of services that blockchains cannot or do not provide. You have chain like Oracle networks that provide those services effectively. So the initial product market fit was price feeds back in 2020. And once those feeds launched, that's basically kind of what allowed DFI to grow into DFI summer and become as large as it was. Because once Devs had access to a good, reliable, secure source of price data, they could actually build lending applications and stablecoins and derivatives and it kind of went up from there. But beyond that, Chainlink's kind of expanded the scope to also doing option computation, transaction automation, serverless compute to scale blockchains as well as CCIP with cross chain interoperability and connecting to enterprise backend systems. The scope has kind of expanded to be much more of like a platform.
00:12:38.878 - 00:13:36.480, Speaker B: I kind of think of it as like a decentralized AWS type platform, which creates a lot of network effects and a lot of composability between these different services versus trying to hodgepodge different services from different service providers with different trust assumptions and different security guarantees. You have one unified platform of all these services. So if you're a user and you're using price feeds, let's say for something, then also using chainlink for crosschain or automation or compute, you're not really adding any new trust assumptions because you're already using chainlink in the first place. So it's easy to expand the scope of services that you use all in one location with the same economic layer, the same time tested security and proven reliability, the high quality nodes like framework helping secure the network, you basically have all the services that you need. So right now it's data compute cross chain, but in the future it could expand to any service that a blockchain doesn't or can't provide. So it's a really massive scope beyond what I think a lot of people realize chainlink is doing.
00:13:36.850 - 00:13:39.006, Speaker D: And that's a really easy thing to describe.
00:13:39.198 - 00:14:17.390, Speaker C: Yeah, incredibly easy to. Let me ask you this. So with L2 S Proliferating and everyone wants their own L2, and I guess there's not as many alt L ones anymore, but CCIP will certainly serve the EVM universe kind of in its entirety. Do you think that things are kind of bending towards the chain link arc of a network of smart contracts versus caring or knowing even what blockchain you're deploying on or using? Does it feel like the arc is starting to bend towards you guys versus deploying price feeds like blockchain by blockchain, VRF blockchain by blockchain?
00:14:18.210 - 00:14:46.342, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it seems like the ecosystem is converging towards MultiChain. I mean, you have every bank launching their blockchains. You have the L2 ecosystem, you have the Salana style approach, you have the Cosmos style approach. There's all these different clusters that have to be interconnected. And fundamentally chain is blockchain agnostic and it's going to serve all those environments. But I think ultimately in the future, users, they're not going to know which blockchain they're operating on or which one they're using, and they may not even know that they're using a blockchain itself. That'll be abstract away.
00:14:46.342 - 00:15:24.338, Speaker B: If I'm a user on Solana and I want to go use an application on, like today, you have to go bridge your tokens over there, make a trade, then go bridge your tokens back, which is just a horrible user experience. It's a lot of friction, but if you can stay on the chain you prefer and use something like CCF to interact with a smart contract on another chain, and it handles all that back end flow between different chains and sends the value back to you, that's a way better experience. If you go use Netflix, your first question is not like, oh, does this run on AWS, Azure? I must know what cloud server this runs on. Nobody gives a shit. Nobody thinks about that. And it'll be the same thing with blockchains. They won't care what the backend infrastructure is as long as it works and it provides them what they need.
00:15:24.338 - 00:15:44.890, Speaker B: And if one blockchain has better network effects and liquidity than another, they're going to go to whatever application is the best. That thesis. I feel like the industry is moving towards that more abstraction and chainlink is basically perfectly suited to not only ride that narrative, but also help facilitate that in the first place through things like CCIP and these other services that are chain agnostic.
00:15:45.470 - 00:15:52.480, Speaker C: What's the latest on like I know they're kind of in pilot, right? I mean, what can you tell us about what's coming next?
00:15:52.930 - 00:16:36.854, Speaker B: Yeah, so CCIP launched earlier this year in Early Access, which is effectively like this initial whitelisted approach to onboard users. Initially make sure CCIP is working as intended, changing some features so it actually works for the users. There's been a lot of interesting traction on the TradFi side of things. So there was a recent initiative with Swift and about twelve of the largest financial institutions on using CCIP to move tokens between different blockchains and allowing banks to connect their backend systems to blockchains using Swift messaging. And so there's been other kind of initiatives that branched out from that. Like ANZ, they're an institutional bank in Australia. They have about a trillion dollars assets under management and they're creating a cross chain tokenized asset marketplace.
00:16:36.854 - 00:17:23.174, Speaker B: They've issued a couple of stablecoins and they were using CCIP to show how you can execute trades cross chain. So if there's RWAs on different chains, you can still trade different assets with each other using CCIP to bridge the assets between those networks. So there's kind of like the TradFi tract of how CCIP is like basically the institutions are testing it and then they're moving pretty quickly towards production. Then there's like the DeFi tract, which is things like Aave using it for cross chain governance, synthetics using it for cross chain SUSD transfers, various different users using it for cross chain token transfers. It's like the next stage would be basically moving to Ga and adding other additional features onto CCF. Different ways to bridge tokens between different so like, that's kind of the next step. I'm the most interested in TradFi and seeing how that goes because I'm super bullish on tokenized assets.
00:17:23.174 - 00:17:33.760, Speaker B: But DeFi is like a very good, almost like, case study showing like, this infrastructure is useful and that's kind of how you viewed price fees as well. DeFi is the case study for what on chain finance will ultimately look like.
00:17:34.370 - 00:18:04.070, Speaker C: What's your level of confidence of, like, I was watching Bloomberg the other day, and that's what they've renamed kind of like onyx we're settling, like, a billion dollars of credit transactions a day on these. Like, in one side, it's like, that's awesome that they're using the technology. On the other, it's kind of like you're off on an island, you're not really building an ecosystem. What's your view on Tradfi's ability to build a real ecosystem? Or does that not even matter due to the scale of the dollars involved?
00:18:04.490 - 00:18:50.070, Speaker B: So I think that for a while, banks and institutions had this vision of like, I'm going to create a blockchain. All my counterparties will come to me and they'll be on my blockchain. I'll have this walled garden ecosystem. And I think it's becoming clear that if every bank launches a blockchain and they all have that thesis, then you just have a million walled gardens and that's obviously doesn't work. So it seems like they're understanding that you can have your own blockchain, but you need to be able to connect to other people's blockchains. So I can buy and sell my RWAs on those chains where the counterparties are and bridge the value back to me. And I think right now there's like the private chain ecosystem, which is very permissioned, it's very regulated, it's very institutional focused, and then you kind of have this public blockchain ecosystem and there's this legal wall between these two ecosystems where banks can't interact completely with public blockchains yet.
00:18:50.070 - 00:19:42.902, Speaker B: But I think the ultimate vision is that as there's more clarity between these different blockchain environments and institutions can start stepping into public blockchains. They'll still have their own private blockchain, but they'll be able to buy and sell assets on other banks private blockchains, but also public blockchains as well, because banks just want the most liquidity for their tokenized assets. They prefer to keep their ecosystem and their ecosystem, but if they can get liquidity elsewhere for their token on other chains, they're going to do that. And if there's other assets they want to buy that are only available on another chain, they're going to bridge that ecosystem as well and bridge it back to their ecosystem. So I think the walls fundamentally will be broken down between these different ecosystems. They'll still be bank chains ultimately, and they're not going to replace public chains in any means, but there'll just be different environments for different preferences and it'll just be kind of abstracted away. Like the end user certainly won't care what blockchain, and the banks and the developers may care, but they could still interact with all these different environments together.
00:19:42.902 - 00:20:01.338, Speaker B: So I think everything will become much more interconnected over time. The probably public chain ecosystem is already being connected. The private chain is slowly ecosystem slowly being connected. But then we need to bridge these two ecosystems together. And that's what CCIP is ultimately trying to bridge all these ecosystems together, one ecosystem at a time. So.
00:20:01.424 - 00:21:00.270, Speaker A: Question for you, CLG. Where do you know if you're sort of bullish on this RWA narrative, where is their traction that's happening there? So there was an announcement this week between onyx at Morgan and Avalanche, for instance, where they're kind of playing around with launching node subnet type deal. Do you see some of this? Is it like a particular chain or something like that where RWAs are really taking off? And if so, let's just say because subnets are sort of their own little isolated spots that are still interoperable with other subnets. On Avalanche, I'm just picking on Avalanche here because they just had that announcement. But let's say there are a bunch of different banks that launch either their own roll ups that are sort of a segment like a know validator roll up or something like that or their own subnets. And there are these architectures where does CCIP sort of step in and help these little almost like cordoned off validator sets and private chains interact with other private and public chains?
00:21:00.770 - 00:21:30.966, Speaker B: Yeah. So I think some interesting context is, like, what assets institutions actually care about. Tokenizing the first is, like, stablecoins is a pretty clear one. We've been seeing PayPal has their stablecoin. A lot of banks are looking at issuing their own. And then a lot of the interest I've seen is on traditionally illiquid assets that are traded OTC or literally over the phone, kind of like carbon credits or pre IPO stock and those things that they don't have formal market structure and they don't have very good liquidity. But when you tokenize those assets, then you actually get a lot of the benefits of being able to access more counterparties.
00:21:30.966 - 00:21:51.930, Speaker B: It's cheaper to settle, faster to settle. You're basically leapfrogging the traditional system. There's no market infrastructure. Then you leapfrog to a better market infrastructure blockchains. And so I think in terms of what blockchains they use, I think everything's kind of standardizing around EVM for the most part, from what I've seen. And there's different implementations of that. There's subnets, there's l two roll ups.
00:21:51.930 - 00:22:28.950, Speaker B: I think it kind of remains to be seen which exact chain environments each institution cares about. It seems like they're just launching their own tech stack, kind of like Quorum style. But I think CCIP is a fundamentally blockchain agnostic protocol, so there's no limitations to which blockchains it can actually connect to. It just matters, is there demand to bridge that ecosystem? Do they want to bridge their assets to and from other ecosystems? There's no limitation. If banks want to launch their own subnet, that's great. If they want to launch, like, a Quorum style chain, that's great. If they want to have a private permission, l two roll up like an Arbitrum fork on ethereum, that's also fantastic.
00:22:28.950 - 00:22:51.458, Speaker B: CCIP can also connect to those environments. There's no limitations there. So I think the chain choice remains to be seen. But just chainlink always takes like a technology neutral approach. Chainlink doesn't compete with any blockchain. It just connects all the blockchains together, which is, I think, good for the whole ecosystem. Even if you prefer a single chain, it's better for your chain to be connected with everything else, because then you have access to the most liquidity, basically.
00:22:51.458 - 00:22:56.310, Speaker B: So it's really a bull case for the whole ecosystem for CCIP to be connected to your chain.
00:22:57.770 - 00:23:29.120, Speaker C: Maybe this is a question for kind of everyone, but you mentioned the PayPal USD. I do think that's very bullish for the space. Interesting, but it's kind of also struggled out of the gate in terms of who is it for? Is it a consumer stablecoin that competes with Tether? Is it like a back end payment solution that maybe you don't see a lot of people minting pyusd other than large institutions who are kind of netting and clearing transactions. What's the path for something like that to kind of become important?
00:23:29.490 - 00:24:07.882, Speaker B: I guess it seems like it's primarily focused towards consumer style payments. I think that they're initially on Ethereum and that's not necessarily like Ethereum mainnet and that's not necessarily the best platform for stablecoin transfers. I know Visa has been looking at doing like settling transactions using USDC on Solana for example. So it seems like things may be shifting more towards higher throughput chains to facilitate that. But it seems like it's primarily like cross border payments. And just like if you look at the conditions of when you hold dollars in a account, like, you're not very well protected, like you're at the back of the bankruptcy court, you have no visibility. They invest your assets in fairly risky opaque things.
00:24:07.882 - 00:24:31.860, Speaker B: But stablecoins are like treasury and Cash, and it's very clear what the reserves are and you have ability to take your assets out of that platform. But that platform will basically offer a much better user experience if you need to pay somebody overseas and not have to go through traditional wire transfers. So it seems like that's the target market they're going after, but it doesn't seem like they've leaned into it 100% just yet. But I can't speak for them, but that's kind of my perspective here.
00:24:33.430 - 00:25:01.566, Speaker D: We share the same perspective in general, I'd say stablecoins is probably like the one product market fit that you can point to with blockchains working. But with PayPal in particular, I think they don't really have a use case. Know, you look at the top, um, USDT, USDC, Dai, they all have different sort of use cases. I don't know how you integrate that. But it does feel like PayPal is sort of missing the boat in terms know their use for pay.
00:25:01.668 - 00:25:13.840, Speaker C: USD, what's the other side of that coin with the stuff you've guys have been doing with Swift, DTCC, ANZ? What does that look like? Because that feels like the non consumer use case.
00:25:14.850 - 00:25:56.586, Speaker B: Yeah, those are kind of like the assets I mentioned where they're focused more on very illiquid assets that don't have good market infrastructure. So things like preappro stock, carbon credits and eventually most funds are going to become tokenized on chain and are going to be managed directly on chain with all the assets that they invest in. So that's less consumer facing and that's more banks are going to be issuing tokenized assets. They're faster to settle, cheaper to interact with. And it's programmable, you can have data and value on the same database flowing together. That's already a huge efficiency gain over the fragmentation that exists in the traditional system itself. But when every bank's launching their own blockchain, that's a huge amount of fragmentation that institutions are looking to solve.
00:25:56.586 - 00:26:26.342, Speaker B: Plus just the fundamental ability to connect an institution to a blockchain. There's probably going to be hundreds of blockchains that some. Institution wants to interface with. But if you integrate with each one of those blockchains individually, it's not a very viable approach, it's not very scalable. But if you have one integration point, you have one CCIP layer to connect to and you can access every other chain, then you can access the tokenized assets that you want to purchase or that your clients want to purchase. And basically what ANZ is trying to build is just like a marketplace for tokenized assets. They'll issue their stable coins on there.
00:26:26.342 - 00:27:09.758, Speaker B: You can go purchase whatever assets are listed on that marketplace, no matter who actually issued that asset or where that asset lives. So it's basically every bank will eventually have different interfaces for the tokenized asset economy and it'll just be different views on the same economy versus like different isolated ecosystems. You go on Morgan, you buy Morgan Assets versus you go on the JPMorgan Tokenized Asset Marketplace, you can access all these different assets across all these different venues. So I think that's more institutional focus and less consumer facing because consumers will just let their asset managers or whatever else manage those assets and deal with those flows themselves. I think eventually it'll flow down to benefit the retail members, but right now it's like primarily focused towards institutions who want tokenize these assets.
00:27:09.854 - 00:27:41.454, Speaker A: All right, everyone, we will be back to the program in just a moment. But before we do, I want to share something that Blockworks has been cooking up for these last couple of months. March of this coming year in London, blockworks is hosting Das London, the largest institutionally focused conference in all of Crypto. We are gathering 1200 of the world's largest asset managers. So think TradFi, macro funds, crypto, native funds, big allocators and financial institutions. So banks, payment processors, et cetera, all in one spot. It's very rare to get the likes of Goldman, JPMorgan Zero, 72, whatever, all in one room, so you can know what the big money is doing.
00:27:41.454 - 00:28:09.986, Speaker A: We're diving into the themes that they care about. So we're talking about the intersection of Macro and crypto where we are in the cycle, real world assets. So everything from stablecoins to onchain treasuries to tokenized assets, it's going to be a blast. But the other reason you really want to go is London, baby, center of the world. At one point you got pub culture, you got fish and chips, great beer, it's going to be a blast. So because you're such great listeners to Bell Curve, there's a code, Bell 20, that's going to get you 20% off. So click the link at the bottom of this episode, it'll take you right over to the homepage.
00:28:09.986 - 00:28:19.382, Speaker A: You'll see all of our speakers and use Bell 20 for 20% off. Ticket prices are going up soon. Make sure you go use that code. I will see you in sunny London town in March.
00:28:19.526 - 00:28:49.060, Speaker D: CLG, what do you think is the proper analogy for how many different blockchains or networks we're going to have? Is it sort of like inter or intranets of private networks for companies? Is it database technologies, is it operating systems? I think we've kind of thought about all of them as being different analogies for how this tech matures. But what would you say is your maybe core analogy for how we should think about each one of these different networks and how many they're going to be?
00:28:49.590 - 00:29:45.506, Speaker B: I mean, the way I kind of see it and the way things are kind of moving towards with app chains and L2 S is it's almost just like every website has a back end, effectively, and so every blockchain instance is a back end. There's platforms like YouTube, which is a shared database basically of videos, and so that's more of like a shared database of different applications. But every website has its own back end that's optimized for whatever use case that they're doing. And I think that's likely where things will shift, where somebody can come deploy their own L2 for some specific use case, like high throughput derivatives trading, and they don't have to deal with the congestion of any other chain dealing different use cases on their layer, but they can still interface with other L2 environments or other chain environments. So that's kind of the way I see it. Where things are increasingly going towards this app chain thesis. There may be different ways of sharing security and having a shared underlying economic layer backing some chains like L2, L3s type designs, or it could be completely independent side chain or subnet style designs.
00:29:45.506 - 00:30:11.390, Speaker B: But I kind of see it the same way as like there's a million different types of cloud services out there. There's a million different types of website databases out there, but you still have one underlying TCP IP protocol to connect all those internet databases together. Like if you go on the Internet, you don't go to Aws.com, and then you have AWS applications and then Gcp.com and GCP applications. You just go to the application and use the application itself. You don't care what that backend database is.
00:30:11.390 - 00:30:15.890, Speaker B: So it feels like things will converge that direction where everybody will eventually have some instance of a blockchain.
00:30:16.310 - 00:30:30.280, Speaker C: Yeah, you're not bridging your PII to MongoDB. Nobody thinks about it that way before you use an app. Maybe like 2030. What do you think crypto looks like?
00:30:33.770 - 00:31:32.018, Speaker B: It's kind of like estimating internet use cases like back in the 90s, but I think it'll be deeply ingrained, the same way the internet is today, where the assets you hold will be natively on chain, but they won't be blockchain assets, they'll just be assets. It won't be on chain finance, it'll just be finance. It'll be like that deeply ingrained, where the services that you use will have additional layers of trust minimization backed into it. So whether it's the assets you hold has a proof reserve attached to it or whether it's the assets you have, but you store the private key yourself. I think in the future, all that complexity will eventually be just completely abstracted away into the background, where everybody will be interfacing with blockchains, whether it's decentralized social media, whether it's the assets they hold, whether it's the gaming applications and NFTs that they hold. It'll just be deeply ingrained. And I think if we get to a point with AI where AI is able to hold private keys and own their own assets, you start to have DAOs that are actually autonomous, and they can manage their own assets, they can hire their own people, and they'll use crypto as, like, the monetization layer of the currency layer of the organization itself.
00:31:32.018 - 00:32:02.180, Speaker B: So that's very future facing, I think. But fundamentally it's just all the world's assets will be brought on chain and operating within an on chain economy rather than the fragmented different pieces of the economy where if you have like, PayPal, you can't just go buy a stock natively. You have to go to a different application because it's a different database and there's no interoperability. When you have a blockchain based world economy, there are none of those barriers effectively. So I think it'll just be shifting the way people think about how they actually hold and own assets themselves.
00:32:02.630 - 00:32:17.240, Speaker D: We've talked about RWAs tokenization. Other than that, what would you say is the most interesting category for blockchain applications right now? And maybe it's something that is upcoming and isn't obvious yet.
00:32:17.770 - 00:33:17.862, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm supremely bullish on tokenized assets. That's where a lot of my focus has been focused on. But I do think decentralized social media is an interesting use case where if you have an underlying social media protocol, censorship resistant, then you have interfaces on top of that that have their own filtering policies of how you view and what content you actually view. That seems like a very obvious path forward for how social media works, where people are able to choose their own content moderation policies, and there's this shared underlying ledger and layer for all of these social media posts. I think that's a very interesting path, but I think even just with tokenized assets, we really only scratch the surface of what we can see over the next five to ten years, how everything starts to begin to be traded on chain. There's always use cases like gaming, where gaming and people being able to actually own their in game assets as NFTs, and you can move your in game assets from one game to another game and use it there. That's already an incredibly powerful dynamic.
00:33:17.862 - 00:34:04.458, Speaker B: I played RuneScape when I was growing up, and there were like these items called party hats, which were they issued them once back in early 2000s, they never issued it again, and it became very rare. Those party hats were worth basically the max amount of currency you could hold in the game effectively. And so I think people already value digital goods and digital collectibles, and they can't fundamentally own those assets within games that they have now, and they can't take those assets to other games when that first game shuts down. Like, you basically are wiped out or the rules can be changed on you. So once you're able to actually fundamentally take ownership of those assets, that's like a paradigm shift where people can start building their own game. You can basically fork games. If there's a decision made in the original game you don't like, you can fork the game and create your own instance with the same state transferred over to this other application.
00:34:04.458 - 00:34:33.634, Speaker B: So fundamentally, blockchains are just used to prove ownership and show transparency so people can verify assets. And that logic can be applied to any type of application. Finance I'm the most interested in, that applies to gaming, that applies to social media, and that applies fundamentally to any contractual agreement, whether it's like insurance or whatever. Every agreement is better when you can actually own ownership of the assets and you can actually verify what the contractual agreements of that contract is. It's infinitely applicable to any use case.
00:34:33.672 - 00:35:04.570, Speaker A: Vertical I've got a question for you. Maybe probably there's a lot of crypto natives that are listening to this show. And I guess one of the things that first of all, I think real world assets are happening and that it's sort of inevitable at this point. But one of the things that always made me a little bit pushed me back from getting super excited about it is I'm kind of like I don't really know how to participate in that, if that makes sense. Like, okay, money market funds. Come on, chain. Treasuries, come on chain.
00:35:04.570 - 00:36:00.160, Speaker A: Okay, that's great, but what am I supposed to do with that? And one question that I have for you as like a cultural thing and maybe this was kind of maybe to poke a little bit more at that end state that Vance asked you about. One difference that I've heard this from a lot of people but I've kind of noticed it myself is there is kind of like the TradFi has its stuff that it likes to buy and speculate on which is like Treasuries and the stock market and stuff like that. And then crypto has its stuff that it likes to buy and speculate on. And I guess I'm just wondering how you see if there's a future where everything that exists on TradFi, be it money market funds or repo facilities or whatever that is, all that banking, that all comes on it. How does it look different than TradFi today, I suppose. And what does sort of the existing crypto culture and set of assets and ideals look like in that TradFi on chain future world?
00:36:00.930 - 00:36:51.594, Speaker B: Yeah, what I've kind of seen is that if you're in the US. You have a fairly decent financial system supporting you. And it doesn't really reveal how fragmented and unstable the system is until something like SVB or something happens and then people realize how fragile the system is. But when you're in a nation where your currency is inflating triple digits, inflation, being able to move to a stablecoin, and that can't be seized by the state itself, I feel like that's a very fundamentally valuable use case. Of crypto itself that they want to hold tether. And usually it's tether on Tron that I've noticed, is like the most common currency used to kind of escape inflation. But I think fundamentally blockchains are backend infrastructure and it's not necessarily the most sexy use case to say like, hey, we're going to make money markets more efficient and we're going to make funds and all these different markets more efficient.
00:36:51.594 - 00:37:54.226, Speaker B: But I think the more interesting thing is that when you have all these different fragmented global economies and they're able to be interconnected with one another, I'm able to go buy assets from another nation without any barriers or frictions from that. If I need to be able to go pay my parents who go live in, let's say somewhere in South America, I don't need to go pay $50 for a transfer and go wait a week and then hopefully it lands over there. If you can send that in seconds and it settles for a couple of pennies, that unlocks an insane amount of value in just GDP where you don't have all this friction. Like in the traditional system, there's just so much value leakage and friction from so many intermediaries. If you're able to move those processes on chain, remove all the manual processes, eyes and end user can go verify, okay, this application actually has the assets that it says it has and that I actually know. The integrity of the application is immensely valuable. Like if you look at 2008, it was fundamentally a problem of too much risk, but also too much opacity where you couldn't tell how much risk there was in that system.
00:37:54.226 - 00:38:36.260, Speaker B: But if people are able to verify the exact risk exposure of an economy, of an ecosystem itself, you're able to prevent these significant cyclical booms and bust cycles. They'll still exist fundamentally, but we're able to mitigate the huge systemic failures which results in foreclosures and people's losing their job. If we can solve that problem, that'll be a huge benefit. Even if I am not a person who goes invests in Treasuries or bonds or stock or equities, the benefits still flow down to you. Even if you're not the direct end user of that product itself. The institutions themselves become more verifiable and you can actually track the risk that's happening in that system itself. So that's kind of the lens that I'm viewing it on.
00:38:36.260 - 00:39:00.140, Speaker B: You can go buy the assets yourselves and you have way more friction, but the system itself becomes antifragile, basically. And that's a huge benefit to everybody, particularly if you're in a nation with an inflating currency and you can't trust the financial system or the legal system, you can trust a blockchain and you can hold your assets there. So there's different elements here, but the benefits ultimately flow down to the end user, I think.
00:39:01.870 - 00:39:20.638, Speaker A: Can I ask you actually just about CCIP, how it actually works and then I've got one more question for you on just restaking and how that impacts chainlink in general. But CCIP, I think the model of a bridge that most, by the way, would you call CCIP a bridge? Is that how you describe it?
00:39:20.724 - 00:39:25.786, Speaker B: I would say it's a cross chain messaging protocol. You can build bridges on it's, like bridges use case.
00:39:25.908 - 00:39:53.050, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So it's almost like one layer below. Okay, so can you kind of just walk us through technically, when you say it's kind of a low level messaging protocol, I'm almost thinking the reference point that I have in my head is like a layer zero type thing. Like, how similar is it to what layer zero offers? Can you just kind of get a little bit more specific about I get the idea that CCIP connects all of these things, but how does it actually do? Like, what are the parts of the protocol that are involved?
00:39:53.390 - 00:40:46.662, Speaker B: Yeah, so CCIP is not like a singular network. It's actually composed of multiple networks. So you have the primary networks that connect the different chains together, but each bridge on CCIP, which is like a specific chain connection, solana to say that's a specific collection of networks. But on addition to that, you have something that's called the Risk Management Network, which is the second independent network that's written in a different program language. It was created by a different internal team. It was runs using a completely separate independent set of node operators compared to the primary CCIP system. And it's basically a second validation layer where every transaction that flows over CCIP, whether it's just arbitrary data, it's tokens, or it's a combination of tokens and data, those transactions are not only verified by the primary CCIP networks, but it's also verified by the second independent network that's making sure that each transaction is actually legitimate.
00:40:46.662 - 00:41:27.394, Speaker B: And if it's not, it can halt those transactions and even shut down CCIP itself. So CCIP is not one network, it's actually a collection of networks for every chain lane effectively. But like, when you look at what CCIP can do, you can move arbitrary messages between different blockchains. So if I need to call a function on a contract on another chain, you can send that message cross chain. You can obviously bridge tokens themselves, whether it's like creating a wrap token or you do burn and mint style, where you burn the coin on the source chain, you mint it on the destination chain. But I think what's cool is you can combine those and you could do programmable token transfers. So you send tokens from one chain to another and it has instructions context on what to do with those tokens on the destination chain.
00:41:27.394 - 00:42:00.554, Speaker B: So, like, let's say deposit on Aave, then go borrow Stablecoins, buy an NFT, and then go bridge it back to me on the other chain. So you could basically create this whole pipeline of events. So if I'm on Ethereum, I want some tokens, but they're most liquid on Solana. I can go to CCIP, say, hey, take my stablecoins, go buy this token on Solana, then bring it back to me. It'll go do that flow. And I never had to actually even touch Solana to get that flow executed. And that whole flow is being validated by this primary CCIP network and this secondary risk management network that isn't in any other cross chain protocol.
00:42:00.554 - 00:42:40.458, Speaker B: So, like, layer zero is all about optionality and having choice, but think that's kind of dangerous for users because if I go use an app and they're saying they're using layer zero, I don't know what that means. What security guarantees do I get from that? The configuration could be one way Monday and then a different way on Wednesday. And I don't know anything of like, what am I getting here? But with CCIP, you're getting these strong security guarantees where every transaction flowing over CCIP is validated by multiple networks, multiple independent networks. So you have a very strong assurance that I'm actually going to move my tokens cross chain. They won't just get lost in the void. So I think it's a fundamentally different approach to security by having this multiple layers, defense, in depth security that's not seen anywhere else. Like CCIP's.
00:42:40.458 - 00:42:53.010, Speaker B: Bread and Butter is basically solving the cross chain security problem. Like $2.6 billion in cross chain funds exploited. It's just unacceptable. We have to solve that problem and that's what CCIP is trying to solve.
00:42:53.990 - 00:43:03.958, Speaker C: How does the chain link token play into this? Should people think of it as like an L, one gas token, as these transactions happen? Or how do you think of it?
00:43:04.124 - 00:43:46.766, Speaker B: Yeah, so Link, you can kind of bucket it into two different areas. One, it's like link is a payment token. So link is the standard form of payment for chainlink services. And chain link is working on something called payment abstraction, where users can pay in the assets they already have, whether it's ETH or Stablecoins or eventually even credit cards. And on the back end, it'll get converted to link and then paid to service providers. So that's kind of a narrative the community created called Universal Gas Token, where it's basically, no matter what chain you use with CCIP, no matter what asset you pay in, it, gets converted to link and paid to the. Operators and paid eventually also to stakers which is the second part which is link is a staking token where node operators service providers stake a link as basically a commitment backing their services which can then be slashed if they don't meet those commitments.
00:43:46.766 - 00:44:10.780, Speaker B: So that Staking launched late last year, there's a new version launching later this month, and that'll expand out to more services, including CCIP, providing this additional layer of economic security. Plus as you get like surplus revenue that flows down to stakers, which then attracts more stakers and creating a more secure service for whatever that is. But those are kind of like the two broad lenses you could see the link token through.
00:44:11.150 - 00:44:26.260, Speaker D: So that was actually going to be my next question, which was how do you define and I've heard Surrey talk about this a number of times, security in general, when you talk about CCIP being the secure way of message transfer or cross chain communication, how do you define that security?
00:44:27.190 - 00:44:43.442, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's almost like different tiers. You could define crosschain security specifically. At the first level you basically have a single server, like a single guy with a single private key. He moves your tokens. Obviously that sucks. Nobody wants to use that type of solution. There's things like MultiChain where they give the appearance of decentralization.
00:44:43.442 - 00:45:22.878, Speaker B: So they say, hey, look at all these nodes that I have, it's decentralized, but what they actually mean is distributed because one guy controls all those nodes. MultiChain got wrecked basically because of that situation. The CEO disappeared and the whole network went down. Basically. That's not ideal. The third is like when you have not centralized but you have this hub network, you have this single monolithic network that process all the cross chain transactions and that's meaningfully, better, but you still have one network processing all cross chain transactions and that doesn't scale in the same way that blockchains have issues scaling. When you just have one single monolithic network as well as if any chainlane connection is exploited, all the connections between chains become at risk.
00:45:22.878 - 00:46:09.486, Speaker B: So this fourth step, which is what chainlink has historically operated at, is where you have multiple networks. So every bridge within a cross chain protocol has its own decentralized network. So you have this isolated security between all these different chain connections and it's much more scalable because if one chain lane between two chains gets congested, it doesn't cause the rest of the network to become congested. And if one chain lane is exploited, you have that one chain lane, but you have all the other ones that are operating fine. The fifth level, which is what CCIP operates, is multiple networks, but also this secondary risk management system on top, which monitors every cross chain transaction, can initiate emergency halts as well as having other things like token rate limits, limiting how many tokens you can move. So if it is exploited, you don't drain the protocol basically. So there's different tiers and every bridge kind of operates at a different tier.
00:46:09.486 - 00:47:02.050, Speaker B: And so saying CCIP operates at the highest level of security is because it has multiple networks and a risk management network system securing every transaction. While a lot of bridges are just this singular blockchain like model for Bridging tokens which just kind of concentrates risk and doesn't scale fundamentally as well, you're basically exposing yourself. If there's one vulnerability in that bridge, you're screwed compared to if you had a risk management network, it could halt those transactions. So those are the different tiers and there's always additional defense on depth mechanisms that you can add. On top of that, even when it comes down to upgradability, having a time lock where node operators can veto any changes is like how CCIP is upgraded. So there's little things like that. But it's just having defense in depth is something that a lot of bridges haven't done well or just had really low quality code and got wrecked because Bridges is just a fundamentally hard infrastructure to do it securely.
00:47:03.030 - 00:47:22.460, Speaker C: Do you see the layer zeros of the world as the competitors, the axilars? I feel like a lot of CCIP to me is so powerful because it has so much distribution and it's starting from a position of strength versus trying to bootstrap an ecosystem. But I feel like at the same time these people would be like yeah, we do that too.
00:47:23.390 - 00:47:28.490, Speaker A: Can I add CCTP the circles transfer protocol.
00:47:29.150 - 00:48:01.346, Speaker B: Yes. Like honestly, when I look at Chainlink versus other protocols, I don't think Chainlink has any competitors. And what I mean by that is there's other guys who do price feeds or they do automation or they do VRF or cross Chain, whatever, but they usually just do that one thing. That's their product, that's their bread and butter. But what Chainlink is doing all of these different services. Like if you look at Google and Microsoft, those are two companies that are competitors because for every product vertical they're competing on something. Whether it's like Search versus Bing or Chrome versus Edge Docs versus Word, like whatever, they have some competing product across those verticals.
00:48:01.346 - 00:48:40.638, Speaker B: With Chainlink, there's no other platform that offers the same scope of services that Chainlink offers. So there's not really a true comparison there. But when you look at CCIP specifically, it's fundamentally like a cross chain messaging protocol. And so like chain link CCIP, it wasn't the first to the crosschain game by any means, but I think it is the most secure approach to crosschain that we've seen thus far. And I think that plus the network effects of already having an ecosystem of 2000 users is like a significant edge that other protocols just starting. They don't have that edge, they don't have those network effects to the point of CCTP. I think it's an interesting approach of token issuers having their own bridge.
00:48:40.638 - 00:49:22.106, Speaker B: But with CCTP, that's circle's cross chain protocol for USDC transfers between chains, that's specifically for USDC, which is useful for ensuring canonical tokens between chains. But if I want to go bridge ETH or go bridge link, that doesn't really become as relevant. And if you want to use it for messaging, you're basically trusting Circle as a company, which is like that first tier of security I mentioned, which is just one entity with a private key. That kind of defeats the point of using Blockchains in the first place. But it works for USDC because you're already trusting Circle if you hold USDC. So I think that CCIP is fundamentally cross chain messaging and there will be competitors here. I just think that chainlink has a better note.
00:49:22.106 - 00:49:26.690, Speaker B: It has better network effects and way better security than other competing solutions.
00:49:27.510 - 00:49:42.162, Speaker D: Yeah, it feels like the cross chain transfer versus message is going to end up becoming a lot more message heavy as DApps get to be more intelligent and smarter versus transferring assets between chains.
00:49:42.306 - 00:50:28.014, Speaker B: Yeah, when you look at the flows, most of it today is like retail bridging tokens. I think some of it's inflated by people expecting AirDrop of a certain protocol. But I think over time, DApps will realize I can actually split my app up into multiple chunks on different chains. Like, I want to hold custody on Ethereum, but I want to do high frequency trading portion of my app on Solana because it's better at that. Then if you have a messaging protocol, you can basically stay in sync between all these different deployments. Because you look at uniswap or like traditional multi chain approaches, you're copy pasting the same app across every chain, which fragments all the liquidity across all the different really, that's not cross chain, it's multi chain. But if you're able to connect all those different deployments, you can have almost like storefront contracts on every chain, which then bridges to wherever the logic is actually located.
00:50:28.014 - 00:50:54.560, Speaker B: And so those natively running cross chain applications are way more useful because then if I like Ethereum, I stay on Ethereum, I can still access all the contracts in the Blockchain ecosystem. I just go touch the storefront. Like, obviously we're not there yet. I think that's where we're going to go. And I do think that most of the volume will be messaging and not necessarily token transfers. It'll be tokens as needed as a part of the messaging, but the underlying volume will be mostly messaging at the end of the day.
00:50:55.970 - 00:52:01.282, Speaker A: I got a question for you about restaking, actually. And so you were describing the link token within the chainlink ecosystem as a staking token. So basically the idea being like, hey, I'm going to provide these valuable services to this network of Oracles and to prove how trustworthy I am and that you should trust me, I'm going to stake some link, presumably, and maybe you get some rewards and then you get slashed if you do bad work. And one of the things that's happening in the Ethereum ecosystem is this advent of restaking and eventually liquid restaking, wherein ETH exports its security. And I guess to something like, I think. They call Avsses actively validated systems so that these protocols can sort of solve that cold start problem and they don't need to necessarily inflate their token supply quite a bit and they can actually just use E security and they can also be like, you know, maybe and cross the fingers for some ETH users and liquidity and all that stuff. So my question to you is, do you think Chainlink? I guess Chainlink's in a little bit of a different position because it's so established at this point and has a moat and I would guess real revenues and all that kind of stuff.
00:52:01.282 - 00:52:12.600, Speaker A: But do you ever see Chainlink using something like restaked ETH to secure itself? Would that ever be on the roadmap or how would you kind of think about that option?
00:52:13.050 - 00:53:03.906, Speaker B: Yeah, I would say two things. One, I don't actually think Eigen layer solves the cold start problem from an economics perspective in the sense that if you have decentralized infrastructure, protocols are a marketplace of buyers and sellers, service providers and users. And the cold start problem in my mind is that service providers or nodes are not going to join a protocol unless it's profitable for them to do so. But users can't purchase services if there aren't already a profitable set of node operators that exist selling services. So you fundamentally need a token in the first place to pay those node operators to ensure that they're profitable, to create the supply side for the demand side to actually purchase. And you do that by token inflation, which ideally over time you replace with user fees and then you're sustainable and then you actually have surplus revenue to the token itself. So I think that in my mind that's like the core economic problem of bootstrapping a network.
00:53:03.906 - 00:53:58.854, Speaker B: You need some way to pay service providers, which is through a token. But I think going to the other point of just like restaking with Eigen layer in terms of Oracles, I think that the amount of collateral a node operator locks up is one element to how secure Oracle service is. There's a lot of other elements. You look at ethereum validation, it's pretty set and forget you set up your node, you make sure it's working, that you have backups, and then you put it in a basement somewhere and you make sure it's running basically. But running an Oracle node is basically almost like running a business where you have to actively choose what data sources you want to support, what blockchains you want to support, what services you want to support. And it really matters more on how high quality that node operator is, what's their track record, what's their performance, what is the economic opportunity cost being lost if they're malicious, as well as just how they run their infrastructure itself. So if you just look at the economic staked collateral portion, that's just like one element of the story itself.
00:53:58.854 - 00:54:48.006, Speaker B: But like with Chain link chain link is a blockchain agnostic protocol. So if it does restaking with ETH, that would be tying itself to the hip, to Ethereum, but it operates on like 18 plus blockchains. So it doesn't necessarily make sense to tie yourself to one specific blockchain as well. As I think just having a token has economic flywheels themselves where you have these implicit incentives, where if you have network service providers who are financially exposed to the native token of the network, they're exposed to the overall health of that network itself. So like with bitcoin mining, bitcoin miners earn bitcoin revenue, they hold asics if they collude and attack the network. They devalue their bitcoin holdings, their future revenue in bitcoin and their ASIC equipment. So it's just like more profitable, to be honest itself versus having this external collateral which its valuation is tied to some other external system.
00:54:48.006 - 00:55:19.294, Speaker B: So I think there's like multiple dimensions. I've kind of thought about this over time. I don't think restaking works that great in terms of Eigen layer for chainlink. I think it makes sense for DA or other services, like for the Ethereum ecosystem. But yeah, I think for the chainlink ecosystem, if anything, link would be restaked where you stake Link on multiple chainlink services to reuse that collateral in a more economically efficient manner. I think that's likely. But in terms of using ETH as collateral, it basically breaks the economic flywheel that's already happening in the chainlink network.
00:55:19.294 - 00:55:33.462, Speaker B: More fees leading to more services being secured is more staked being secured leading to more users. Like this flywheel effect is very powerful dynamic of having a token chain link restaking. You heard way.
00:55:33.596 - 00:56:18.438, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure. Sriram's vision. I'd have to go back and check miles and I did an interview with him a little while ago, but I think he said that his intention was that Eigen layer is the sort of marketplace where you could restake other assets outside of just ETH also. So maybe there is Link restaking, I don't know. You bring up a really good point though, because I've actually thought about this myself. Like, if your security is dependent on ETH, which is basically a currency that you don't print, it's kind of similar to another country holding foreign exchange reserves or something like that, which the benefit of that is, that okay. I have these treasuries that aren't going to go down in value if I blow it with my economy and then need to print till the cows come home so I can't buy energy.
00:56:18.438 - 00:56:38.300, Speaker A: But then you could find yourself, you're almost taking on foreign exchange risk in a weird way. And the advantage of being able to issue your own token is you get total sovereignty over that token. You do kind of align incentives within your own ecosystem. So I think you bring up a really good point there.
00:56:39.390 - 00:57:21.322, Speaker C: It remains to be seen if restaking really works in the way that we understand it. Where someone will forego having their own token to your point, or give you a chunk of that initial emission of that first year to restake or secure your stuff on their behalf. I guess you get the attention and the love of whichever asset you're using to denominate your security in if it's chain link, if it's whatever, but at what cost? And it's kind of like tokens all the way down. It's like you get DA tokens, you'll get bridge tokens, or if it's another Oracle like Oracle tokens, but they actually have to have some sort of inherent value for it to actually work. So we'll see.
00:57:21.376 - 00:57:53.854, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see. Yeah. And then the other something to consider as well from the perspective of both, I guess, like a liquid restaking protocol or the protocol who you're renting ETH from is what happens when you trade your token for ETH. Right. I would guess from Eigen layer's perspective you kind of want to insta dump that, but maybe then that's not great. Biz dev know, maybe there's some pressure for Eigen layer not to insta dump the tokens and then back into ETH auto t wop.
00:57:53.902 - 00:57:54.114, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:54.152 - 00:58:36.446, Speaker A: And then it's like, so what are we really doing here? I'm kind of there with you. It makes a lot of sense from the perspective of if you imagine all of ETH stake being solo stakers and they're like, hey, I'm like running this operation myself. I want to pledge this again to opt into running my own little small business like an Oracle sort of network. I don't know, I'm kind of slowly coming to that conclusion as well. I'm just questioning how much sense it makes in a totally passive delegated stake world where it's mostly professional operator sets. But I will say I've personally heard from a bunch of protocols that they're really into this idea and they want to do it. So I guess we're going to have to see how it plays out.
00:58:36.548 - 00:59:01.070, Speaker C: We'll figure something out that works. In the interim, there's going to be so many tokens given out for free to these restaking services, it's going to be kind of comical. We counted them up today. There's twelve restaking outside of Eigen layer. There's twelve restaking protocols that are currently raising capital or have raised capital. And so it's like you kind of seem like the beginning of like a DFI summer starting to emerge. I think that's one theme.
00:59:01.070 - 00:59:19.550, Speaker C: I'm pretty confident 2024 people are going to be farming. There's going to be restaking, there's going to be maker endgame, there's going to be SNX infinex farming. There's going to be so many things that you can do on these chains. That's definitely going to be a meta narrative that I do think chainlink will also be a part of as well.
00:59:19.620 - 00:59:23.646, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe in Got.
00:59:23.668 - 00:59:27.330, Speaker C: I got one question for CL. What's next for the Link marines?
00:59:29.590 - 01:00:06.346, Speaker B: Well, I think later this month the new version of Staking is launching. So if you haven't heard about that, definitely go check that out. That'll eventually expand out to more services, activate user fees for Stakers, as well as projects who have joined the Build program are contributing a portion of their token supply as being a part of that program to use chainlink services and get technical support, which will eventually flow down to Stakers. So I think that'll be a very interesting dynamic. And fundamentally, Chainlink is making three big bets. You have CCIP, which we've talked about. You have data Streams, which is a pull based low latency Oracle solution, which a lot of derivatives protocol and Arbitrum are starting to integrate.
01:00:06.346 - 01:00:39.646, Speaker B: GMX is using it on mainnet right now. And then you have Functions, which is this self service Oracle network platform where you define what data sources you want. You can run computations over it off chain and inject that on chain onto any network. So I think it'll be interesting to see how those data compute. Cross chain bets play out, particularly as people will start to integrate more and more services into one application as the platform thesis gets more and more realized over time. So I'm very bullish on derivatives using data streams in particular. I think that'll be a significant boom.
01:00:39.646 - 01:00:43.610, Speaker B: I think most derivatives trading will happen on Chain and move away from exchanges.
01:00:45.550 - 01:00:58.686, Speaker A: Nice. That was actually going to be my question. What's, like, one thing that you're looking forward to? All right, folks, I think we can wrap it. This was good to reunite the old Link crew here.
01:00:58.868 - 01:01:00.080, Speaker C: We never left.
01:01:01.410 - 01:01:04.846, Speaker A: All right, cool. Later, guys. Jane Link. God, thanks for hopping on, man.
01:01:04.868 - 01:01:05.486, Speaker C: This is a lot of fun.
01:01:05.508 - 01:01:06.190, Speaker B: Of course. Thanks.
01:01:06.260 - 01:01:07.054, Speaker A: Appreciate it.
01:01:07.172 - 01:01:08.010, Speaker D: See you. Bye.
