00:00:26.730 - 00:00:36.310, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup of Bell Curve. You got Michael's one and two, yano and Spencer Son, who's back from his two week tour in Japan.
00:00:38.410 - 00:00:39.426, Speaker A: Welcome back, brother.
00:00:39.458 - 00:00:40.486, Speaker B: We missed you.
00:00:40.668 - 00:00:43.562, Speaker C: Yeah, thanks for carrying the torch while I was gone.
00:00:43.696 - 00:00:47.322, Speaker A: Let me ask you, did you listen to us? Did you listen to us while you were gone?
00:00:47.456 - 00:00:53.614, Speaker C: I did the last one, but not the intermediate one between those, but pretty good.
00:00:53.732 - 00:00:55.342, Speaker A: That's a good thing that you didn't listen.
00:00:55.476 - 00:01:02.106, Speaker C: Yeah, I think there's some comments. Haircut or something that live, but richard.
00:01:02.138 - 00:01:05.950, Speaker B: But there's some promises made. Yeah, there's some promises made. We'll see if they're kept.
00:01:06.550 - 00:01:11.250, Speaker C: Well, Michael and I are now synchronous in our hairstyle, so feels good also right in the world.
00:01:11.320 - 00:01:16.450, Speaker B: Yeah, it does seem like there's a little coordination on the framework side and the hairstyle.
00:01:16.610 - 00:01:17.318, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:01:17.484 - 00:01:19.320, Speaker B: Has Adam got you guys going to the.
00:01:24.490 - 00:01:25.046, Speaker A: Trip out?
00:01:25.068 - 00:01:26.470, Speaker B: Yeah. Tell us about the trip.
00:01:27.290 - 00:02:06.574, Speaker C: Yeah, it was a lot of fun. Like I said, used to live in Japan, so have some experience out there and went to ETH Tokyo. And then I did a quick trip to Korea and also met a bunch of the people who had come from the other crypto conference in Hong Kong. So it was a good kind know view of the entire landscape and seeing everyone. I guess the quick breakdown that I would give is ETH Tokyo was either the highest or the second highest amount of submissions that they'd ever received for the hackathon. And it was a really good mix of local Japanese and foreigners that were there. And when I used to live in Japan, there was like a very small crypto scene.
00:02:06.574 - 00:02:57.534, Speaker C: The government would have to give you permission to list new tokens on exchanges and effectively the whole scene was bitflyer. And when I lived in Japan, it was like coin check had been hacked, mountain gox had been hacked. The government was pretty negative on the entire space, but the amount of submissions that you had for that hackathon, you had government officials coming around to know DAOs are going to be recognized as legal entities by the end of the year. It really feels like kind of crypto and AI are Japan's like two pronged. Sam Altman was also with OpenAI, not for ETH Tokyo, but for just like pushing that tech agenda. And so Japan basically missed all of web two, and it looks like they're determined not to miss web3. And who knows if any of the projects coming out of these hackathons are going to be billion dollar companies or decacorns or whatever.
00:02:57.534 - 00:03:24.480, Speaker C: But it felt like that was the first local event to really have a lot of activation energy just for the local scene. And it was awesome. ETH conferences in Japan are always very special. DevCon Osaka was the last one I was at, but it was just super cool to see people building. And Japan has a lot of know things like anime, manga, Pokemon, whatever you want to call it. A lot of the focus there is like putting digital collectibles on chain. I think that's pretty cool.
00:03:24.480 - 00:04:02.362, Speaker C: And so that was Japan. I would say like Japan is just starting their kind of crypto journey, but it's being pushed by the local government and went to Korea as well. And the vibe I got from Korea is just that they're living in the future. From things like web3 and crypto to iPhone and internet adoption to just like the prevalence of plastic surgery. And you look at all the Netflix top shows, it's like all K dramas. You look at the headliner from Coachella, it's Blackpink who's a Kpop group for their size of country. It's like probably a 50 or 60 million person country.
00:04:02.362 - 00:04:33.378, Speaker C: They're punching way above their weight in terms of technological adoption and just like global clout. And I came away from Korea just like even more convicted in web3 gaming. There are so many web3 gaming companies that are building in Korea. Like one of these is going to hit like law of large numbers. Somebody's going to make something happen. All of the local big gaming companies are marching in the direction of putting things on chain. And I would say that we're going to see a bunch of games come out of there and probably the next.
00:04:33.378 - 00:05:05.018, Speaker C: Like they're pretty early on in terms of their development cycle. Most of them are launching their land or NFT PFP collections this summer. So call it a year until they really get going. And Korea just like a bunch of really interesting consumer apps as mean. The other part that I kind of like talked to but didn't go to, talked to people that went to the HK conference. There's so much excitement coming out of China as well. Apparently mainland China is now kind of back open in terms of being able to access exchanges.
00:05:05.018 - 00:05:45.180, Speaker C: There's a bunch of provisional exchange licenses that are being given out that are effectively facilitating the on ramping of spot and fiat flow. And unlike two years ago, there looks like there's actually off ramps to these exchanges. It used to be like you'd P to P trade USDT for bank accounts that's been formally outlawed and they've actually put in proper off ramps. So between everything just like super positive trip and always inspiring to get a little perspective from the different parts of the world because you sit in San Francisco long enough, you definitely get a little bit stale and so cool to just be out there. That was a long winded explanation, but yeah, it was a great trip. A lot of fun.
00:05:46.670 - 00:05:49.306, Speaker A: What were the non crypto things that.
00:05:49.328 - 00:06:22.854, Speaker C: Korea is so advanced like, if you haven't watched this show, it's called The Glory. It's like the show on Netflix that's very advanced. You think about things like Squid Game, that's just like very advanced. Pop culture art, and I would say like pop culture television, movies. They're probably a year or two ahead of where the US is in terms of just the depth of storyline. And you watch these shows and it's been a while since there's been an American show that I've kind of not been able to turn off. And Korea definitely has that.
00:06:22.854 - 00:06:47.278, Speaker C: Kpop is like this new art form where the music doesn't really matter as much as the community and the group. And with the rise of AI and stuff like that, that's kind of where music is going, in my opinion. And then iPhone adoption, even things like plastic surgery adoption. They're living in the future. Like 5G adoption as well. They were the first country to have that. Yeah, they're in the future.
00:06:47.364 - 00:06:47.854, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:06:47.972 - 00:06:51.150, Speaker A: What did you learn by spending time with the guys at Hashed?
00:06:53.270 - 00:06:54.500, Speaker C: What did I learn?
00:06:55.190 - 00:07:01.860, Speaker A: Or did it make you change your mind on just from a crypto venture lens? Did it make you think differently about.
00:07:03.270 - 00:08:01.986, Speaker C: Mean, the thing I came away with is a ton of respect for know you think about what they've been able to do in Korea. There aren't really any analogies in places like Japan desperately needs someone like Hash to kind of plant the flag, have a lot of incentives. And Hash got to where they are today basically from prop capital and they've since raised regular venture funds and they're raising them from just very legitimate Korean institutions. And they're really helping bring the asset class to that country, especially in the wake of things like Luna. So just tons of respect for them. But in terms of things I've been thinking differently on, I think it's just like better reasoned understanding of things like web3 gaming and how different it looks in Asia than the US. And I would probably give Asia asia has more users of these things.
00:08:01.986 - 00:08:10.138, Speaker C: They're more acclimated to crypto. That's going to be like the initial user base of these games. Pretty convinced of that. Yeah.
00:08:10.224 - 00:08:19.130, Speaker A: Are they spending time building things like in DFI? Are there the ave's and uniswaps and compounds of Korea and Japan?
00:08:19.870 - 00:08:53.858, Speaker C: No, I mean, DFI is kind of like the incumbents that are in place today are very unlikely to be unseated by local players unless things take a very different turn with web3 gaming where it's not uniswap on the game chain. It's like something else that could happen, but it doesn't seem like it's much easier to reason through building a web Three gaming startup versus trying to go off and compete with uniswap. It's like you're just going to have that adverse selection of people not wanting to go and charge off in that direction.
00:08:53.954 - 00:09:27.042, Speaker B: One thing that you mentioned, Vance, was that there was a lot more it seeming kind of like app focus from some of the people that you were speaking to in Korea and Japan. And I do think maybe this is just my perception because of what I've been digging into lately, but I do feel like a lot of the traction that you're seeing here in the US is very infrastructure sort of based projects like Eigen layer or roll ups and things of that nature. So is that a fair comparison that people over in Asia are a little bit more focused on apps and actual things that you can do with crypto as opposed to the heavy infrastructure focus that you see over here in the States?
00:09:27.096 - 00:10:50.650, Speaker C: A little bit, yeah, I think the west is always leading in terms of infrastructure, but I'm not sure how important that is anymore in an age where we have abundant block space for probably the next five or ten years of consumer applications. And just like Asia has more of a background in consumer applications to start with. So they have really big gaming companies, they have really big messaging companies, they have really big consumer apps that they built, but they haven't really kind of built the infrastructure before. And I think they just feel more comfortable building consumer apps generally and I think that puts them in a pretty good position going forward. The other stuff I'll say is with web3 gaming the importance of a very lindy economy that's bootstrapped and signaled by institutional investors versus there's going to be thousands of games to launch in the next few years. That's something that's starting to come into focus for me in terms of just the economies of the game really need to be backed by high signal folks and a lot of money needs to be put into them to make them even just seem legitimate. And it seems like that's what a lot of the Asian gaming startups are looking to Western investors for is like, put money into this, buy and farm the land, help us develop this economy.
00:10:50.650 - 00:11:38.330, Speaker C: It feels like that's what people like US and Hash and other big venture firms are good at. But there aren't a ton of big venture firms in Asia and so they're always kind of missing that pillar of how they go to market. So I mean, it's just good for people who invest both across the US and Asia, but there's definitely going to be a need for that type of persona in the market. But overall, really fun trip, had a bunch of drinks with people, went out, built some relationships and once we're such a relationship business that you kind of forget that if you sit behind a screen all day, you definitely get stale. And you do need to get out. There a lot of trips planned to places like India and places like Africa for this year and excited to see kind of what else is being built in crypto globally.
00:11:39.950 - 00:12:18.326, Speaker B: Yeah, so maybe on that theme, just maybe kind of the theme of this podcast know, we talked at the very tail end of last week about for the first time, at least in my experience in crypto, it's seeming like the US. Actually has a chance, know, of losing this. And it does seem like a lot of activity is moving out and that's primarily due to regulation. So it was kind of funny to watch. There were two kind of regulatory updates this week and they stood in really stark contrast to one another. So there was the Gary Gensler testimony this week, which I'm a little hesitant to get super deep into. I think a lot of people probably followed that and have kind of their strong conclusions about it.
00:12:18.326 - 00:12:51.330, Speaker B: But I do just want to get your guys sort of brief thoughts on that and then I want to actually spend a little bit more time talking about I don't even know how Mika markets in crypto, the regulation that just got passed by the EU parliament, which feels really promising to me actually. And it's not very often that you see the EU leading the US. In regulation, especially when it comes to something like tech. So for really I felt like it was a very stark contrast. But maybe before we get into that, I'd love to just get kind of a high level on what you guys all thought about Gensler's testimony.
00:12:52.150 - 00:14:12.022, Speaker D: Yeah, I think know, it's all kind of a performative expose of know, there's never going to be any decisions that are made in public forum like that. There's never going to really be any changes of mind in a public forum like that. I think it was very clear that there is a lot of disinterest in the way that things have been going. Regulation by enforcement action has not been successful. One of the questions that I think would have been great to ask would have been, and it was sort of asked in an indirect way, is if the rules today are sufficient for protecting US. Consumers, US. Investors, then why did we have two of the largest explosions in the industry in the last year? Don't we think things need to likely change? So I do think that there's a lot of emotions, frankly, in that chamber, but all of the work that goes into policy making, all of the work that goes into decisions and things that actually effectuate the industry happen behind closed doors with people who aren't necessarily the ones making those comments.
00:14:12.022 - 00:14:49.090, Speaker D: It's the staffers, it's the policymakers, it's the people behind the scenes. So that's really what I'm looking forward to is to see what some of the actions are coming out of these types of discussions. There's also another discussion on the Hill specifically talking about stablecoins. It would be great to see some sensible regulation about stablecoins come out of that. And yeah, Mike, you're 100% correct. All of this runs directly in the face of what at least was, I believe, got the vote today. It needs to be verified by EU members.
00:14:49.090 - 00:15:02.480, Speaker D: But Mika is moving forward and while it's probably not perfect, it at least is good in a lot of ways of at least defining the rule set that people within the EU will be able to operate under.
00:15:05.410 - 00:15:42.250, Speaker C: The regulations in Asia aren't perfect either. Like the HFC, which is their version of the SEC, was like, yeah, all the DeFi projects are under our regulations too. You need to come in. And you know, it's positive that they're opening crypto back up again, but they don't have this nuanced understanding that is just by and large just way better than the US. This is not the case. Japan is great as well, but the Japanese government moves extremely slowly. Honestly, I think Korea is probably the country that's again living the most in the future with regards to regulations.
00:15:42.250 - 00:16:15.058, Speaker C: They have no tax on crypto trading, they have security token legislation that's coming into view. They have a separate carve out for utility tokens. But again, it's not perfect. The one that I'm pretty interested in, that I don't know enough about is the UK landscape. I've heard it's just like a basic transparency and disclosure regime. But I take notice of Coinbase going out to the know relative to the amount of users they have there. That's a lot of time to be investing in a place like that.
00:16:15.058 - 00:16:48.240, Speaker C: So nothing's perfect. And I think the fact that you can have senators know, regulators in the US is also not something that you have in, frankly, any of those countries. So it's just cool to see it play out. And there's always going to be ups and downs and at the end of the day, the courts are going to need to confirm a lot of this, or at least confirm regulators power or not power to do things. But there's a lot of people who've said their piece on the Gary Gensler hearing bashing him has become fashionable. I don't know, I don't think I have a whole lot of tat to that.
00:16:48.610 - 00:18:09.678, Speaker D: The thing that I maybe want to double click a little bit into is, uh, this is for the EU. So to Vance's point, that's a good clarification. It's not for the not specifically. Mika itself doesn't include something that was also passed, which is the travel rule. Maybe it's called the TRM, I believe, or TRC, but basically it's the EU's equivalent of the travel rule with FATF, which puts you can think of it in terms of, okay, when do centralized providers need to provide the government with information on certain transactions that are happening from centralized service providers, crypto asset service providers, SAS, as they're called in the EU. Fortunately, one of those was not a peer to peer transaction, but if it was from one SAS to another SASP or into or out of a SAS, there are going to be new rules pertaining to how those centralized providers are going to need to report those transactions to the government as they currently do right now. So if you move $10,000 or more in the United States, that is something that has to get filed literally with the FBI.
00:18:09.678 - 00:18:58.562, Speaker D: And so there are going to be controls around that for better or for not. One of the initial models that they were considering was all peer to peer transactions or just having a self custody ledger or self custody wallet with assets on it completely outlawed. So this is definitely a good outcome. It's not a great outcome. Mika itself also specifically carves out both DeFi and NFTs from being as part of the coverage of this rule set. And it does put a lot of focus onto what can be considered a stablecoin. And the rules around stablecoins, stablecoin issuers the amount of assets backing these stablecoins.
00:18:58.562 - 00:19:29.060, Speaker D: That's what a lot of the focus seems to be. So once again, let's not let good be the enemy of great or whatever that phrase is. I'd much rather have something positive that we can move forward with in an area as big as the EU, where a lot of this activity already was originating from UK, I'm sure will follow suit in certain ways, maybe differences in others, but positive trajectory in the face of what seems to be negative trajectory in the US.
00:19:29.430 - 00:20:10.650, Speaker A: I thought two of the most interesting things from Mika were so within Mika they introduced three subcategories for crypto assets. There's asset reference tokens, there's what's the second one? E money tokens, I think it was. And then the third buck is actually utility tokens. And that was interesting to see because that's the European Parliament directly saying that some of these tokens do have utility on chain. That's them saying that some of these things have utility. And then the other interesting thing was for a crypto project to launch in the EU, it needs to have certain things that happen. It has to be a legal entity has to register with the EU, they have to submit their white paper and get approval.
00:20:10.650 - 00:20:33.030, Speaker A: And then they also have to take approval for stablecoins, which in my mind is like the EU basically putting their stamp being like these stablecoin things. Okay, we see the value here. And if you're a crypto project, you need to take these stablecoin things. And I think it also puts USDC under the European Banking Authority, which is like a big step forward for them.
00:20:33.180 - 00:20:33.890, Speaker B: Yep.
00:20:34.050 - 00:20:52.526, Speaker D: At the same time, another thing that happened today, and I'm going to butcher the name Society General, the bank in. I believe Switzerland launched the digital euro on ethereum today or announced the launch of it. So you're already starting to see some of the move in the direction that.
00:20:52.548 - 00:21:06.980, Speaker A: Is something that in a bull market that is like watcher Guru 20,000 likes like 500 Twitter people being like, european biggest bank launches. Nobody's talking about that. I didn't even know that.
00:21:07.350 - 00:22:08.274, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know if it's the biggest bank in Europe. It is a bank in Europe putting bank issued coins on ethereum. So, yeah, people are already taking this vote and it wants you to I don't know the process. I know it has to get approved by EU Parliament, but June, I believe January 2024 is when the stablecoin section will become valid. And then around June 2024, or maybe it was June, and by the end of 2024 for the two different sections, but 2024, all of this becomes legitimate and active. And the other thing that was in there is when launching a token project or a project that has a token, one of the things that I think is just a no brainer in terms of any regulation is when you file the white paper or publish the white paper, you also have to publish a list of all the different holders of the token. And this is exactly something that happens with the S one process of going public in the United States, who owns what.
00:22:08.274 - 00:22:40.750, Speaker D: And then every single time that someone who's an insider or declared to be an insider makes a transaction, either buying or selling those securities, you have to file with the SEC. I don't think we need an ownrous process like that, but actually being able to track who has ownership, where is that ownership, how does that ownership trend? Is the team selling all their tokens or investors selling all of their tokens? These are things that will help with the clarity and understanding of what is backstopping these token networks and I just think a really important improvement into the transparency of these ecosystems.
00:22:41.490 - 00:23:16.486, Speaker B: Yeah, it feels like this was a relatively good spirited way to tackle a holistic framework for crypto. And the other thing that we haven't really talked about is now there are 27, I believe, member states in the European Union. Now you basically have to register in one of those member states, and then you get the same treatment across all those different member states, which is so different from how it works in the United States. Just look at the Bit license, for instance, in New York for an example of that. I got a question for you guys. So all this is very promising. This is definitely a big step forward in the right direction for Europe.
00:23:16.486 - 00:23:24.350, Speaker B: Would you recommend portfolio companies, especially early stage portfolio companies, to go be dominant out of Europe?
00:23:24.850 - 00:24:08.140, Speaker C: Depends what they're doing. If they have something that's truly permissionless that you can launch and never have to maintain again, I think you're fine no matter what jurisdiction that you're in. And I think that's ultimately what people should be aiming for. Unfortunately the process of starting a centralized company to gradually decentralizing protocol, to being totally permissionless usually that takes a few years. I still think the US is probably the best shot because as an entrepreneur you're not just considering the regulatory clarity or lack of clarity, you're considering the capital market formation that you have around you. You're considering the local talent for hiring into your company. There's like a bevy of factors that you have to consider.
00:24:08.140 - 00:24:37.620, Speaker C: But there's no doubt that the needle is moving more and more towards probably not Asia because there frankly isn't regulatory clarity there either. But Europe is becoming this potential second banana that's potentially equal with the US going forward. And that's crazy to yeah that's an intergalactic bag tumble by the US. It's so sad to see.
00:24:38.650 - 00:24:53.260, Speaker B: What about the would you consider the labor practices and rules that Europe has? For instance in somewhere like Germany it's basically almost impossible to fire someone or something like that. Does that factor in how you think about operating a startup at all?
00:24:53.870 - 00:25:21.460, Speaker C: That's more of like a larger stage company question startup I think you have the benefit of the doubt just because you're hiring fewer people. So you better make those hires count. But yeah, you can even see it from Coinbase like what they're doing. They're launching a international derivatives exchange based out of Bermuda obviously, but targeting probably mostly Europe and Asia. And so even from a user perspective, the aperture is opening just beyond the US.
00:25:21.910 - 00:26:04.910, Speaker B: Yeah let's talk about the Coinbase news because this felt really significant to so pretty short TLDR but basically Coinbase has been granted a license to operate in the offshore haven of Bermuda and it's seeking to diversify its business outside of the United States. So I guess in theory what this would be is some sort of offshore derivative exchange visa vis FTX back in the day or derabit or something like that. And now this is where I'm kind know Coinbase hasn't said this but I'm paraphrasing. I would guess this is them actually taking seriously the idea that the growth in the United States is going to be limited and maybe hedging the risk that the US administration is just ultimately super unfriendly to crypto. What do you guys think about this?
00:26:05.060 - 00:27:14.710, Speaker A: I think you could also see this as an two I think there's two camps here. The one camp is this is them hedging their bets and there's like this SEC gensler war on crypto in the US and they need to hedge. And you saw I think Brian posted a picture on Twitter with someone in the you know, they tweeted out that they're doing national expansion and then same week they do this Bermuda thing and this is them kind of like hedging basically the US. The other take on this is that they see a massive market opportunity. The regulators are coming down on binance pretty strong. And yeah, I mean if binance were to disappear, there's really no good options to trade perps and to trade derivatives right now. You're kind of going to places where liquidity sucks or places that are pretty shady right now, or places that are like you could go on chain, but there's a lot of issues with on chain and this could be them saying like, look, at some point crypto is going to need a very regulated, very stable derivatives and perps market and something that big institutions trust for this stuff and maybe they can fill that hole.
00:27:15.370 - 00:28:08.620, Speaker D: So 100% agree with Yano. Also keep in mind the second largest competitor to finance just blew itself up about five months ago and that was servicing derivatives markets in international jurisdictions, non US jurisdictions. So I think it's more a move that also this isn't something that just happens overnight. Like, oh we applied and got it and boom, it's happening. The other thing too is that they also said that they could launch the product as soon as next week, which means that they've been building this product for a long time and this is probably something that stems out of a market opportunity. Less more recent news, less more regulatory news. I think the bigger thing that's more regulatory news or just like kind of the winds of politics going right now is their visit to the, you know, having a bit of an inside look as to how usual PR works.
00:28:08.620 - 00:28:40.660, Speaker D: The two narratives coming out of there is Brian basically saying moving Coinbase to a non US jurisdiction is not out of the A. That is a seeding of the thought of, well, what if we made Coinbase a UK company going forward and our headquarters was based in the know who's our regulator at that point? What are the regulations that we have to abide by at that point? I think that has to do more with the political wins, less the derivatives product. They just happen to coincide in the same week.
00:28:41.430 - 00:29:22.254, Speaker C: I don't think Coinbase is leaving the US. Just like the vast majority of their business is. Retail flow on know, like all within the context of they're probably building this straw man argument for hey, we're going to leave and hey, we have other parts of our business too, but overall I just don't see them leaving the US. And we'll see what happens with this Wallace notice. But my guess is that they're going to fight that pretty much tooth and nail. Same with Bittrex and those cases are going to take years. You're probably looking at, at the end of the day when that is resolved either way, it's probably someone who isn't Gary Gensler that's at the it's, it's just gonna take so long.
00:29:22.254 - 00:29:48.214, Speaker C: Not saying anything about him leaving or anything like that near term, but yeah, they're starting to. Build the straw man for. We can go elsewhere. We'll see how real that is in time. But certainly for members of Congress, when they hear know, they probably don't read too much beyond the headlines. That's just my guess. They have a lot of stuff that they're doing this probably resonates with them.
00:29:48.214 - 00:30:20.702, Speaker C: And I think there still is this lack of international venue for people to trade in the wake of FTX's collapse. Per Michael's point, it would be great if it was like that's one of the things that I've been looking for in terms of my bear market checklist on chain activity, I would say that that's pretty much back. We still need to get more NFT users, more game users, more DeFi users, et cetera. But we're back. The other one is just like the rebuilding of the credit in the exchange market. Right now, the credit market is still a zero. Like dollar lending has gone away, but what that's been replaced by are these perps and on chain venues.
00:30:20.702 - 00:30:29.670, Speaker C: But having someone as legit as Coinbase with the ability to attract market like, that's kind of what you need for this next run to start taking shape.
00:30:30.170 - 00:31:13.890, Speaker D: So just to double click one more time, moving outside the US really doesn't have any effect on US customers. It means that your contracts that you've signed switch from Coinbase Incorporated US to Coinbase Global. You know, the headquarters of the company switches from someplace in San Francisco to someplace in, you know, the taxes and maybe the dollar denomination turns into a pound denomination, but you can switch it back to dollars if you like. Nothing really tangibly happens to all the existing US customers. It's just they're a UK company serving US. Customers hypothetically. And so, you know, there is a serious potential for them to leave.
00:31:13.890 - 00:31:29.610, Speaker D: What would that do to US. Customers? Basically nothing. What would that look like to US. Capital markets? I think they'd still trade on the New York Stock Exchange. I don't think tangibly that much changes if they move other than having more favorable regulatory dealings.
00:31:30.830 - 00:32:14.486, Speaker B: I would push back on some of this. I don't personally think, like zooming forget the growth opportunity over the next like two or three years. I don't think the future for how crypto is traded is these offshore unregulated venues. I just don't I think there's a pretty clear future for me. If I had to bet on a future, I would say there's going to be large, heavily regulated exchanges based in probably the major jurisdictions like the US. There'll probably be one in Asia somewhere like Japan or South Korea or something like that, and maybe an EU one. But I don't see it as being a good move for Coinbase to kind of try to chase the market that Binance is dominating right now.
00:32:14.486 - 00:32:45.600, Speaker B: Because I don't even know how that would work as being a public company in the US. I definitely don't think you would see an offshore unregulated exchange be able to go public. Coinbase is already public, so I don't know what that looks like in terms of risk, but I can't imagine that their investor base would actually love that even if it starts printing money for them, because the risk is just way too high. FTX is in everyone's. I don't think they're going to do it, but I don't think it's a smart move even if they did.
00:32:46.550 - 00:33:42.722, Speaker D: We're also talking about sort of semantics here. Most companies, the way that most companies function is you have a US entity and then you have a UK entity. All the business that happens in the rest of world, whether or not, you're know, cloud storage, you're allowing people to trade on your platform or you're selling advertising. All of the activity, the business activity that happens outside of the United States literally flows through Ireland, the UK, whatever international entity you have set up. All the business activity that happens inside the US happens with the US inc, delaware C Corporation just about every single time. What they're talking about doing is a fundamental shift of just saying, okay, which one's headquarters, which one's secondary? And you have this intercompany agreement which basically says all the revenue that happens in one entity happens there, and then you flow it back to headquarters. It's like a semantic shift in a lot of ways.
00:33:42.722 - 00:34:20.538, Speaker D: But just to double click on what you were saying Mike, I think all that they're doing is they're saying, listen, we want to get regulated, so we are the regulated opportunity internationally. Where there are no regulated opportunities to trade derivatives internationally. It doesn't limit them from saying, hey, eventually if there's an opportunity for us to be a regulated derivative exchange for US customers, that we're going to go after it. They already have said that they have multiple broker dealers that haven't been activated by the SEC. They've been in process with the CFTC to make those types of trading operations available. I don't think it limits them into perpetuity. I think this is know, a new business line that they haven't been able to access previously.
00:34:20.714 - 00:34:45.382, Speaker C: Yeah, this would be regulated just be serving the countries that are outside the US that Binance serves right now. Like all of France, like all those venues are regulated as well. So don't want to cast too much of judgment on places like Binance because they are regulated in most of these countries in the that's right. So is FTX. But right?
00:34:45.436 - 00:35:23.230, Speaker E: Hey everyone, exciting announcement here from the Blockworks podcast network. We are hiring two podcast hosts to build a show with us called Lightspeed. TLDR of Lightspeed is that it is a show for builders, tinkerers, and lovers of technology. It's a callback to the heyday of Silicon Valley, where great tech was built in garages, not in corporate fortresses, and was truly the Wild West. Lightspeed is an exploration of crypto from the perspective of a builder and an engineer who's designing for scale and is interested in onboarding the next billion users into crypto. If this show sounds exciting to you, you have a background in podcast hosting or content creation, go to the Careers page of Blockworks. That's blockworks Co careers.
00:35:23.230 - 00:35:37.462, Speaker E: I've also linked it in the show notes here. You can just click there, it'll take you right to the page. You can also follow me on Twitter. I'm Mike Ipolito underscore. You can just slide right into my DMs and we'll set up some time to talk. We'd love to hear from you. We are super, super excited about this show.
00:35:37.516 - 00:36:21.174, Speaker B: Speaking of FTX, I'd love to get your guys take on this idea that they might restart. And I guess I saw Bloomberg reported that there might be a possible bid in from Tribe Capital. So this all happened when Andrew Dietrich, who's an attorney with FTX, and Sullivan Cromwell told the US bankruptcy judge that the company might try to raise money and basically make creditors whole through a restart on the exchange. I think this comes off the back of the news that they found some $7.3 billion worth of assets. I haven't seen what those assets are. The last time I looked at the balance sheet of FTX, I wasn't super impressed with what was on there.
00:36:21.174 - 00:37:07.970, Speaker B: But I would assume if this is the recovery team saying this, then it's probably pretty real. And they basically floated this idea that his name I'm blanking on the John J. Ray is basically going to be thinking about this in Q Two. So sometime over the next three months, he's going to be assessing that idea. And yeah, Bloomberg reported that Tribe is considering injecting basically leading a $250,000,000 round, of which 100 would come from themselves and their LPs. And I guess the last thing I'll say before I get your guys opinion is they initially were an investor in FTX themselves. So I'd love to get your guys thoughts on do you think this is viable? Do you think this is a good way to make creditors whole? And what do you think about Tribe leading.
00:37:10.230 - 00:37:33.370, Speaker C: Mean? First thing is the question on the amount of assets. What are different things marked at? I'm looking at serum on coin gecko that's still marked at like two, two and a half billion. So I think they own like 30 or 40% of that. That's obviously not real. And to your point, looking at the schedule of assets, it's not all like you could sell it into real US. Dollars and distribute it to people. So there is still a hole.
00:37:33.370 - 00:38:24.366, Speaker C: And the question is, how do you kind of get people as close to whole as possible? Letting this get drawn out by lawyers and trying to do a distribution, the Voyager distribution was like the most straightforward thing ever. It was just like, take the crypto, give it to people. It's been like almost a year at this point, and there's still no progress. They're still charging outrageous amounts of legal fees. Like, hundreds of millions of dollars are going to the wrong people, and not to the actual creditors of the estate, which is just like, awful. And so my general bias is that crypto people should always seek to figure things out between themselves and not involve regulators, bankers, or lawyers to the extent possible. Unfortunately, I think the FTX getting the equity to be monetized, aka getting it to a higher market cap value, where people are again using the exchange, it's generating profit, and you give people a share of it.
00:38:24.366 - 00:39:10.694, Speaker C: It just depends. Are people down to sign up for keeping their money on the platform and trading it on the platform for some exchange of the exchange fees or some pro ride of the exchange fees? I don't know. I think, like a couple of months ago, I would have said definitely yes, that's a possibility. When Coinbase is spinning up a licensed derivatives exchange, I think that just makes the opportunity a little bit smaller. At the end of the day, you also need somebody to run this. So I think having people like Tribe, who are a very legit firm, actually lead the effort to get this spun back up, it's certainly pretty positive. And I would definitely put our support, financial or otherwise, behind something like this, just because I think it's A, good for the creditors.
00:39:10.694 - 00:39:28.820, Speaker C: But B, it's probably a pretty big business opportunity if done correctly. But how do you lock people up onto the exchange and get them to stay there and use it? That's still the question, that Voyager is still trying to sell their platform. It's like, okay, who wants to be a Voyager customer in the year of 2023? Probably not that many people.
00:39:30.710 - 00:39:35.700, Speaker A: You would invest in this FTX. Why is that something that you would allocate capital towards?
00:39:36.470 - 00:40:02.910, Speaker C: I mean, you're getting it at a 99% discount to its $34 billion valuation back in the day. And maybe that was a silly valuation and it was like SBF effect, but the exchange was generating. I guess you kind of need to dig into whether the actual profit and revenue numbers were also fraudulent, because that's kind of the delta of what we don't have at the moment, is how big would this exchange have been if it was run as a legitimate exchange?
00:40:03.250 - 00:40:03.806, Speaker B: Right?
00:40:03.908 - 00:40:06.240, Speaker A: Were those revenue numbers real that we.
00:40:06.930 - 00:40:21.154, Speaker C: The death the death spiral is like, was Alameda all the volume? And did Alameda have capital because they stole from if not, you know, then this isn't legit. But you do need the layer of data. And would we put our support behind something like this? Maybe.
00:40:21.272 - 00:40:23.700, Speaker A: Who in their right mind would ever use FTX again?
00:40:24.630 - 00:40:32.614, Speaker C: A lot of people. They have a very expansive license exchange, even though it was rot know?
00:40:32.652 - 00:40:38.086, Speaker B: You know what would help, Jason, is if a really big backer, came in with a gigantic balance sheet and put.
00:40:38.108 - 00:40:40.214, Speaker A: Their name behind, would that would help?
00:40:40.252 - 00:40:41.320, Speaker C: That would really help.
00:40:42.010 - 00:41:17.140, Speaker D: The other thing that I think mean, it's going to take a long time to play out. I don't know if you guys have been following this celebrity promotion class action lawsuit that's going on for anybody that supported or promoted FTX. I read a little bit into this. It's actually really interesting one where the claim is that all of the people that supported FTX, so Shaquille O'Neal, Larry David, coincidentally not Taylor Swift because she asked the one shout out.
00:41:20.890 - 00:41:22.920, Speaker C: I think that never happened.
00:41:25.450 - 00:42:33.182, Speaker D: Apparently it's been discovered in emails that they're using in the case. Adam Moskowitz is the lawyer who's putting together the class action lawsuit, who also was the lawyer who did the $1.4 billion of recovery from the Surfside Building collapse a couple of years ago. But he's put together this class action lawsuit, effectively saying that every single account represented an unregistered security, because every single account, when you signed up for FTX, was an interest bearing account, which, according to some of the perspectives of, like, I think whatever the SEC I know New Jersey has said that those interest bearing accounts are securities. They prevented Coinbase from creating that because it was an unregistered security offering. But every single person who had an account at FTX was also given an unregistered security as they signed up because everyone was an interest bearing. So it becomes a question, and whether or not you get into the legal semantics, I don't think it really matters for this point.
00:42:33.182 - 00:43:40.420, Speaker D: But what really becomes a question is what do you actually retain if you start FTX again? If there's no interest bearing account, if you have to trade certain assets, if you don't know the market making capabilities that Alameda probably provided, if you don't have the ability to launch. I mean, they were doing such Wild West things of launching Coinbase as a synthetic asset before the Coinbase IPO, even like that type of stuff, would never be able to fly in what you know will become a regulated institution in whatever way, shape or form it manifests going forward. Also, there's a $5 billion class action lawsuit on the table here for these celebrities who are going to recoup if there is any money that happens. They're going to go back to the estate and say, what the heck? I supported this. So there's just a lot of red tape legally that has to get sorted out on this. It almost feels a little bit premature to want to respin and reskin FTX just because we don't even know where the end of this road leads on just discovering the bottom.
00:43:40.870 - 00:44:44.214, Speaker B: Yeah, you guys might know better than me, but I think that the reason why you might want to buy FTX and restart it is there still is, to my knowledge. I don't know if it's the industry leading risk management risk engine that they said it was. But there definitely is still tech and connectivity that was built in. And there definitely are still lots of accounts that if you assured them that there was different management and a large balance sheet behind them, then they might stick around with FTX because these sorts of accounts are famously sticky. So I guess this would make sense for someone that has a really large balance sheet, doesn't have necessarily the in house competency to build a crypto exchange, but wants a piece of crypto. So I don't have my tinfoil hat because I'm at the office, but if I did have my tinfoil hat, I would put it on and I would make a little prediction that a bank ends up buying FTX. I bet that FTX ends up in the within is a nice little piece of crypto property that maybe like a Jamie Dimon type figure ends up with his hands on.
00:44:44.214 - 00:44:45.526, Speaker B: No interest game.
00:44:45.548 - 00:44:46.678, Speaker A: You're playing, my friend.
00:44:46.844 - 00:44:49.270, Speaker D: Too regulated. Also, Vance, I think you're on mute.
00:44:49.350 - 00:44:50.650, Speaker B: You're on mute, Vance.
00:44:54.190 - 00:44:55.370, Speaker A: Vance is staying.
00:44:57.150 - 00:44:58.474, Speaker B: Doesn't want to talk.
00:44:58.672 - 00:45:01.920, Speaker C: Yeah, far too regulated me now.
00:45:02.290 - 00:45:04.960, Speaker B: Yeah, I can hear you now, bro.
00:45:06.130 - 00:45:09.520, Speaker C: Every week a different podcast and software. Every week.
00:45:11.890 - 00:45:13.920, Speaker B: You haven't been here for the last couple of weeks.
00:45:15.010 - 00:45:17.470, Speaker C: Sure enough when I click the podcast.
00:45:18.390 - 00:45:21.330, Speaker B: All right, so what are your thoughts on that? Too far out there.
00:45:21.480 - 00:46:09.854, Speaker C: I think that's too far out mean, it's cool that Tribe is trying to do this, and it's cool that they also have the connection of being initial investors in FTX as well. So I think there's kind of a little bit of making things right, but there's a good chance that when you enter the exchange landscape, by the time this gets respun, it's significantly more competitive than it was in the past. Binance is now seemingly centered in Dubai and not leaving and figuring out that that's like a better path for them. Coinbase is launching. There isn't as much room for FTX as there used to be. The decentralized venues are starting to take off as well. So, TBD, I also don't know what is real about that business or what is fake.
00:46:09.854 - 00:46:14.834, Speaker C: Do they really have an industry leading risk engine? Because it didn't really seem like it towards the end.
00:46:14.952 - 00:46:39.180, Speaker B: Didn't? No. But I could be totally wrong about that and then I would have to pat his egg on my face. But I do think definitely at least JPMorgan. I don't know how real these are, but I heard rumors that they were looking at crypto exchanges and if I were them, this would be a time to pick up something on the cheap that at one point had a great brand and a bunch of customers.
00:46:39.630 - 00:46:40.940, Speaker C: They should went back.
00:46:42.190 - 00:46:47.440, Speaker D: All right, literally. Did they ever write a line of code?
00:46:49.010 - 00:47:09.554, Speaker A: The reason that Mike could be right here is like, you do fit. There was a Citadel guy at blockworks Beers. We hosted this thing Blockworks Beers last night, and there was a Citadel guy there, and he's on the crypto, you know, Citadel, Charles Schwab and I think it was Fidelity came together, and they kind of quietly created this crypto exchange.
00:47:09.602 - 00:47:10.200, Speaker B: Called.
00:47:12.410 - 00:47:27.100, Speaker A: I mean, he was telling me it's full steam ahead over there with the exchange. And then you have nasdaq is doing a lot in the crypto exchange. So I do think that these traditional players want to be primed to capture the crypto exchange market when the bull market comes back.
00:47:27.470 - 00:47:29.020, Speaker B: Running out of time, though.
00:47:29.550 - 00:47:35.840, Speaker C: You hear about these things, and then a year later, you're like, what happened to that? And then it's like, oh, yeah, that was shut down.
00:47:36.290 - 00:47:39.022, Speaker A: I'm trying to make it so that Mike has less egg on his face.
00:47:39.156 - 00:47:43.402, Speaker C: I appreciate it. I got standing up your wall.
00:47:43.476 - 00:47:50.610, Speaker D: But listen, no one should ever be faulted for tinfoil hat conspiracy theories.
00:47:51.190 - 00:47:55.490, Speaker B: Appreciate that, conspiracy theorist. And then it rained.
00:47:58.070 - 00:48:00.230, Speaker D: I'm waiting for my t shirt, Mike.
00:48:03.450 - 00:48:04.662, Speaker A: I actually have found myself.
00:48:04.716 - 00:48:07.590, Speaker B: I was looking for that online. I thought it was a pretty funny t shirt.
00:48:08.250 - 00:48:09.414, Speaker A: You guys want to talk this?
00:48:09.452 - 00:48:55.574, Speaker B: This was kind of a little bit of a wonky story, but I think it is pretty cool. So Flashbots launched their mev share product today. So mev share is basically a way to return mev to users. So one of the big things that's happening right now in mev is at least the way it works in Ethereum today, the vast majority of mev flows to Validators, and there are some good reasons for that happening. It's kind of like the security budget for the network. But overall, the mev supply chain is getting much longer and much more complex. And I think participants are kind of waking up to the idea that, honestly, the people that the generators of mev are actually users, and users are kind of getting raked over the coals right now.
00:48:55.574 - 00:49:44.738, Speaker B: And the big trend in mev service providers is basically finding ways to return mev to those users. And the way that they're doing it is kind of a cool mechanism where basically I don't want to get too deep into the weeds of how it actually works, but basically, user privacy plays a super key role. So they're introducing a new set of actors that are executors. You almost think of it as kind of like an alternative sort of private mempool. And you as a user can choose to reveal certain parts of your transactions. And if you do, you'll basically get compensated for revealing that from these actors calls executors. They send that to a matchmaker, which is just a fancy new word for the person who's bundling these new transactions, and then they get routed down the rest of the chain.
00:49:44.738 - 00:50:05.534, Speaker B: And then you, as a user, can actually get compensated for the mev that you're generating. So Flashbots isn't the only one to do this there's. Also Rook has a solution out there and same with Block native Matt Cutler's firm. So it's pretty cool. Definitely an interesting I think it's a step in the right direction for the way mev works on Ethereum today.
00:50:05.652 - 00:50:32.246, Speaker A: Mike, it seems like there are two solutions to me or like two ways to attack the mev problem right now. The first bucket is like trying to decrease the amount of mev in the system. And then the second is just kind of understanding that mev will exist and so trying to get mev back to the users as much as possible. First off, is that right? And then second is like which bucket do you think is a better solution there?
00:50:32.428 - 00:51:10.654, Speaker B: Yeah, that is right. And this is pretty fiercely debated. I would say it's kind of a philosophical battle, but I would say the maximizing mev but then redistributing it is probably winning if you want the sort of steelman for the opposite side. There's actually a pretty thought provoking piece written by a guy named Ari Jules. Ari Jules was the PhD advisor to Phil Dian actually, who is one of the co founders at Flashbots. And he basically made this analogy know it's hyperbolic in nature, but it paints an evocative picture. It's like the way that crime happens in New York right now is not very efficient.
00:51:10.654 - 00:51:43.422, Speaker B: So basically what we should do as a city is just systematize burglaries, muggings, et cetera. And then we should take basically attacks on those burglaries and muggings and redistribute it to the victims. And to be honest, I think that's a pretty fair way. That's a pretty fair depiction for how MEB happens today. The problem is MEB is so thorny that as soon as you start to dive into these things of like fair ordering, then you're basically just favoring a different set of actors. Right? So first come, first serve. Sounds like that would be a more fair system.
00:51:43.422 - 00:53:08.678, Speaker B: But then you realize that basically all you're doing is incentivizing actors to be as close as possible to the sequencer if you're on a L2 or the builder or validator on the layer one and then it just becomes a latency game. And that's not very fair either because it favors deep pocketed actors, but it also causes geographic concentration and that's not good for the health of the network. So there's no perfect way to do this, I don't think. In Flashbots, if you sort of look at the history of everything they've built, basically their goal as a company is just to kind of shine light on this problem and then to use mechanism design to basically create a whole bunch of small pieces that can be used to solve these problems. So mev boost, which is they actually started with mev geth, which is back when Ethereum actually had mining and they kind of originally solved the problem of those gas auctions, those PGAs and then after, when we did the merge and transitioned to proof of stake that transitioned to Relay Boost or Mev Boost. And that's why they have all these relay auctions so that the 90 like still there are big actors involved in the Validator space, in the builder space. So that really small actors like Validators have the same right to compete basically in MEB as the large ones.
00:53:08.678 - 00:53:33.700, Speaker B: And this is just another tool that they've introduced. And this probably goes beyond the bounds of this podcast, but a lot of this fits into this gigantic solution that they have called Suave. And Suave is probably the most audacious project in all of Crypto right now. I know that's a big tall statement to make, but the scope of what they're trying to do is just so massive. It's super interesting.
00:53:35.830 - 00:54:17.258, Speaker C: Totally agree that you can eliminate I think there's some that you can't. There's also many different types of what are what's an example of mev that you could eliminate ETH USDC Sandwich attacks? I think that's pretty easy to eliminate. You just have someone, you have a market maker, quote closer to the actual price on an exchange instead of letting it go through uniswap. I think that's able to be eliminated versus redistributing the value from that transaction. You could probably do both. But I think the better outcome for users is that you just frankly have a better price. What's some type of mev that probably couldn't be eliminated? I don't know if anybody saw people trading the pepe shitcoin on Uniswap yesterday.
00:54:17.258 - 00:54:53.820, Speaker C: Jared from Subway, this like insane degenerate activity, like a coin that was launched 15 minutes ago pumping to hundreds of millions of dollars of market cap. There isn't an efficient market for that on a centralized exchange. No market maker in their right mind would quote you on anything regarding that price. And so that's always going to go through uniswap. That model is probably better to just redistribute that mev and share with the user. Because Jared from Someway was absolutely eating yesterday. He was cleaning up on just basically retail know, bidding this coin up and down.
00:54:53.820 - 00:55:31.298, Speaker C: I think that's probably a better solution for redistributing. And then you have things like NFT Mev, like all the gas auctions that happen for the initial bid or initial whitelist, all the secondary trading that's super inefficient. You could kind of probably go either way with enough price discovery. But MEB is not just one thing. It's certainly concentrated in the Sandwich attacks right now of the long tail coins. But I don't know, I think there's going to be a variety of approaches that work. Yeah, I think another one is like sharing it with the wallets versus the users.
00:55:31.394 - 00:55:32.038, Speaker A: Right?
00:55:32.204 - 00:55:34.866, Speaker B: The wallets are the sleeping giant of mev.
00:55:34.978 - 00:56:23.080, Speaker D: And I was going to say we haven't even touched the biggest, I think, solution to Mev for the bulk of where Mev is originating from, which is auctioning off the order flow to something else that doesn't flow through an AMM. We haven't really seen that done yet, I don't think, at all. Definitely not at scale. And that's a pretty dominant mechanism for trade, for exchange in traditional markets that could very easily live on chain. And that would solve, I think, the bulk of bucket one that Ants was talking about. They're not going to be able to touch the long tail, they're also probably not going to be able to touch the NFT transactions gas auctions, but the basic trading pairs that originate most of the volume on uniswap or the like, those are going to be things that order flow auctions can definitely take the bulk of.
00:56:23.610 - 00:57:41.422, Speaker B: Yeah. And to be clear, that's the direction that Mev is heading in. And Vance, just to your point about avoiding, we should at one point get the founders of Osmosis on here, dave OHA and Sonny, they are very much in this camp that you can avoid forms of mev and I think that is the way of thinking in Cosmos generally. And you can look at the protoref module on Osmosis as a pretty cool example of this where there's basically a protocol owned bot that does back running on the protocol, which is a pretty non harmful form of mev and then those tokens go to the treasury. I'm sorry for folks who have already listened to me use this analogy before, but I think one of the design principles on ethereum is they tried to not make a whole bunch of changes. There is this idea in public policy where even a very small change that you make for the right reasons can have drastic effects that you just don't see when you initially make the decision. So the example was at one point the sort of rule about third strike offenders and you basically got very long jail times if you committed a third strike with the idea being, look, everyone deserves a second chance, but if you're committing a felony for the third time, we want to seriously disincentivize that.
00:57:41.422 - 00:58:25.834, Speaker B: And they drastically up jail time for third time offenders. And what they found out was that it didn't actually disincentivize crime at all, but it did lead to drastic spikes in the murder rate of counties that imposed these rules. Because people that were going to commit those crimes kept committing crimes anyway. But they knew that if it was their third time, they were going to go away for a long time. So something that might have just been a robbery became a murder as well. So that sort of thinking in public, like people who are public policy planners are really aware of these sort of unintended effects. And that's why I think for very good reason, it takes Ethereum a really long time to come to protocol level decisions like PBS.
00:58:25.834 - 00:58:50.662, Speaker B: And actually a lot of the thinking for some of the Mev big brains is actually finding ways to not do. Things on protocol or test with less permanent measures before making a protocol level decision. So you're probably right. Vance, there are these examples of, like, this is a really obvious, easy form of mev to combat, but then you kind of end up playing this game of Whack a Mole and you can have a lot of unintended consequences that arise from that.
00:58:50.796 - 00:59:23.082, Speaker C: Totally. One other thing I think is interesting is sharing mev. I mean, we said this before, but sharing MEB with wallets or with specific groups. Imagine the Know Coin yesterday trading up, down. Like, imagine everyone who is buying or selling, like getting a specific share of that order. Like, you kind of have these mev meta games that metastasize, and sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad. But right now it's just Jared from Subway doesn't fulfill that good of an obstacle.
00:59:23.082 - 00:59:24.900, Speaker C: I had to choose between all of them.
00:59:26.070 - 00:59:36.430, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you guys think it's significant that that Meme coin ended up going to, like 100 million as opposed to yes, 100%. That's like you talk an indicator.
00:59:36.510 - 01:00:09.514, Speaker C: Spirits and animal spirits are like just the vibe, the temperature of people, how they're feeling. And I haven't seen anything like that happen since Bonk in Solana. I think that was like at the beginning of this year. But you saw this activity level, this price level, where mevbots turned back on, the gas got super crazy, the burn got super high, the yield got super high on ETH. Imagine when that happens at scale in a bull run in the next year or two. That's going to be pretty crazy for ETH.
01:00:09.642 - 01:00:31.800, Speaker A: Do you guys think that this next bull market so it feels like every bull market is kind of more and more muted or less and less intense, basically. What do you think this next bull market will be like? Similar. Like you've kind of decreased the intensity by another 25% relative to the last, or the last one was actually an anomaly and that it was kind of muted and this next one could be crazy.
01:00:32.730 - 01:00:34.230, Speaker D: What do you mean by intensity?
01:00:36.490 - 01:00:40.010, Speaker B: Are you talking about the overall multiple that the market cap goes up each?
01:00:40.080 - 01:00:40.874, Speaker A: Yes, that's right.
01:00:40.912 - 01:00:41.740, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly.
01:00:42.270 - 01:01:23.480, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's hard to say because so much of that market cap is just Bitcoin and now ETH. I think a lot of it is what is going to happen with a long tail of assets, what's going to be the new dominant narrative of assets that are doing well versus not? What's going to be the new market of opportunity that people are working on right now, but then in a year or two from now or are doing the best relative. And yeah, sure, there will be a driving force of bitcoin leading to the wealth effect of ethereum, leading to the wealth effect of DeFi, and it definitely flows downhill. But I do think what will drive this next bull market is a new narrative and that's what we're searching for right now.
01:01:24.970 - 01:02:05.614, Speaker C: I think it's going to be just like after the.com collapse, it was the highest quality names that recovered and did really well and it doesn't look a lot like the ICO bubble where you have thousands of new projects, each of which could potentially be the winner. We know who the winners of DeFi are probably going to be and I think those are going to continue to do extremely well just because they'll be able to generate revenue and give it back to the holders. But you're not going to see like 100 new uniswap forks all of a sudden start competing for the top spot. That game is just frankly over. It depends on what the biggest asset is. If it's ETH, that implies an entirely different thing about the intensity and scale of the bull market than if it's just bitcoin personally.
01:02:05.614 - 01:03:02.150, Speaker C: We do believe it will be ETH and then it's just like games. Games are the ones where you're going to see a lot of open market competition for the number one spot because there just is no dominant incumbent yet. And so think about it's, gone from ICOs, which were just like crazy baconal free for all whatever, to DeFi, which was a little bit like that, but a slightly better reasoned to now like flight to know better reason thesis on the majors and just like a free for all in the gaming space. And I think the reason why it might be more intense is just because gaming has more users than any other vertical could potentially have. And so if you have a community of like 2 million monthly active users that are actually on chain and doing things, I don't know, all bets are kind of off when you enter the actual user adoption phase and we just have not been there over the past three cycles.
01:03:02.650 - 01:03:47.762, Speaker D: Yeah, my kind of thesis on what's next is frankly games. But what we had with DeFi was a large N of different applications. Like every single food coin ever. People were just buying up those domains to be able to launch like a DeFi protocol underneath it with smart contracts that they ripped from something else and I would say a small relative small number of N of users of those applications. Whereas I think with gaming it's going to be the complete reverse. You're going to have a small number N of games that are actually really fun to play with, economies that work. But the N, because gaming is such a huge industry and the best games, which are the ones that are succeeding are going to be the ones that can bridge the gap between web two, web3, in a novel way.
01:03:47.762 - 01:03:59.400, Speaker D: It's going to be a huge number of users, so it's going to be much fewer winners than the DFI ecosystem was in 2019 2020, but it'll be larger winners because of that.
01:04:00.250 - 01:04:26.260, Speaker C: Anybody could have launched an ICO, it was harder to build a D Five project, but you could still copy paste. It's going to be extremely hard to build a competitive game. If you see one in the market that's really working, it's going to take you years. And so that's what I think is nice about gaming, is we're not going to see the fragmentation of this industry 1000 times over like we did with DFI. If you're in market and winning, you're probably going to stay winning for a long period of time.
01:04:29.670 - 01:05:05.070, Speaker D: What was intense about DFI is you literally had to be up 24/7. What was intense about the ICO craze is and Vance and I lived this while he was in Tokyo, we'd literally have a Follow the sun model of staying up on the news, where it would be his daytime, it'd be my nighttime, and then reverse. That type of model I don't think is going to be the intensity or the reason for intensity for this next phase. It's going to be just because of the development time for successful games. It's going to be a lot more linear, but the outcomes are going to be that much bigger. So the massive wealth effect is going to happen again. It's just going to be in a different category.
01:05:05.410 - 01:06:04.270, Speaker B: You guys kind of have red pilled me a little bit on GameFi, actually, because I think the important question to ask in terms of what's going to be successful is what does the user journey look like for getting people involved in crypto? And the person who first kind of planted this little seed for me was Gabe Layton, I think his name is, with his idea of free to own NFTs. And the idea is actually people are first going to get an NFT and that's what's going to make them get their wallet. And that's what sort of facilitates their on chain journey. And I think there's probably a really good case to be made. The same thing with gaming, where people just all you need is like one smash hit of a game, like a Candy Crush level game that's crypto native, and that just Trojan horses people into the space and then maybe you end up earning a significant amount of assets. You're like, all right, it's a pain in the butt to take these assets out of the crypto system. I'm going to use, for instance, DFI as my sort of native finance.
01:06:04.690 - 01:06:43.580, Speaker D: What you just said is oxymoronic as it currently stands because you can't have a successful game in the way that Web Three gaming currently exists. We talked about this last time, or maybe it was the time before wallet wall. You can't have millions of players concurrently if you also have a wallet that people have to use. So the best answer to the ones that abstract it away, whether that's crypto native Web Three Native is up for debate. We debate this internally all the time, but if it's web3 native with a smaller number of end users, but still a lot larger than what DeFi saw, I think that's probably where it starts and then it expands into millions over time.
01:06:43.950 - 01:07:13.510, Speaker B: But don't you think that with the first of all, there's things like account abstraction that fix a lot of those problems with things like session keys and stuff like that? Then you have wallet as a service. Don't you think that's a solvable problem? It just hasn't happened yet. And I would imagine that you guys would know so much better than me, right? But I would imagine app developers and game developers, that when you launch a successful app, there's kind of like a native wallet that's a part of that, and you can kind of just generate your own keys and you barely even know that you've just opened a new crypto wallet.
01:07:13.850 - 01:07:18.966, Speaker C: Yeah, decent history. That's like as of like a month and a half ago, I just had.
01:07:18.988 - 01:07:38.410, Speaker A: That experience for the first time, actually, at Nftnyc of just creating I created a wallet on my phone from Google Chrome on my phone, created it with my Apple ID, Minted, an NFT on the page. So within probably 30 seconds, I created a new wallet and Minted, and it was completely seamless.
01:07:38.570 - 01:08:04.040, Speaker C: This is all even L two S, frankly. Axe launched on Ethel one last bull market. They built Ronan along the way. But you haven't been able to build a game. You haven't been able to onboard people. This is all brand new, so it's going to be a lot easier to onboard people. But still, if you're a game and you're really bringing in a lot of people, the nice part is that there's nobody chasing you.
01:08:04.040 - 01:08:22.940, Speaker C: Nobody chased Axie when it launched because nobody was building games back then. And still games are going to take like two or three years to launch from today that are just getting funded right now. So it's going to look a lot different and very positive that there won't be the same that's that's a huge positive for the space.
01:08:23.630 - 01:08:32.000, Speaker B: Yeah. Vince, you missed this, but we did a review of the uniswap mobile wallet as well, and it might not sorry.
01:08:32.850 - 01:08:34.000, Speaker C: What did you think?
01:08:36.370 - 01:09:20.106, Speaker B: We had Miles, who's the host of season three of Bell Curve, and Jason, my friend, he actually downloaded it and tried to mess around with it and use it. And he had some basically the TLDR was that they're kind of almost split in between having a super easy retail, never touch crypto interface like a Robinhood versus a very crypto native on chain sort of user. And it almost seems like their UX is right in between those two things. But I still do think they I actually downloaded it after that episode, and it is super easy. You can just I mean, I see what he means. Like, for instance, there should just be a default. It should put you on one chain, for instance, and you should have the option to flip because it was a little confusing.
01:09:20.106 - 01:09:33.166, Speaker B: It's like, wait, there are different versions of this token and I don't know which chain I should go on, but that said it did abstract probably 75, 80% of the pain of MetaMask, for instance.
01:09:33.358 - 01:10:18.626, Speaker D: It was a great first shot at getting something in the App Store as we discussed, and getting something live with the brand of uniswap. I think they'll probably move in the direction of easier onboarding, easier user experience to get more of that consumer base. And I agree. So the other take that Miles had was like, it seems like they're going after onboarding new people as opposed to building the power tools in a mobile device that already existing. Crypto native DeFi users are going to want to use. They'll just start to chip away at all the different product fixes and bug fixes and whatever to make it easier and easier over time as we were talking about. It's also a lot easier to get into the App Store and then make changes in updates than it is to have this full fledged product that you spend a year on and then try.
01:10:18.648 - 01:10:19.620, Speaker C: To get it through.
01:10:21.350 - 01:10:48.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I just think my hope is that we do change the use because right now it basically happens to exchanges, centralized exchanges and definitely lots of props and love to coinbase. But I think it would be cool if we could change the user onboarding flow into something that immediately put people on chain. And I think the mobile wallet from uniswap is very interesting. I think GameFi could be interesting if that wallet wall problem is solved.
01:10:48.342 - 01:11:32.380, Speaker C: But yeah, I mean, like pretty great setup for whatever comes next that we have all of these mobile onboarding funnels, we have coinbase derivatives launching offshore, we have on chain activity and ETH moved to proof of stake l two scaling. Everything looks pretty positive even though Michael and I were talking about this. ETH is at two k bitcoin is like around 30K people are just they got beaten down so hard in 2022 that it feels like they're still dealing with some of the post traumatic stress disorder of that year. But that's also kind of what you need. You need the disbelief, you need even the OGS kind of like fading it. I don't know.
01:11:33.630 - 01:12:03.300, Speaker B: And I've talked about this in 2019, the whole market almost three X and no one was really talking back then about like it's the return of the bull market and that was the time to be getting involved. That's the kind of thing we've been waiting for a little bit because before FTX we were in a bear market, but on every pump people would be like, maybe it's the bull market again. And I think you did need that to get stamped out. And I think this is the most optimistic, this is the most bullish bear market I've only been into, but this I feel like.
01:12:06.310 - 01:12:07.614, Speaker A: Throughout your long storied.
01:12:07.662 - 01:12:11.682, Speaker B: Career my long storied career, yeah, second rodeo.
01:12:11.746 - 01:12:13.158, Speaker D: But I do think that feels like.
01:12:13.164 - 01:12:25.770, Speaker C: They'Re six months ahead of us in terms of where they are in the bear market. It's pretty interesting. People are definitely more optimistic, and I think that's just because they have the local governments kind of behind them in one way or the other. Interesting.
01:12:25.840 - 01:13:15.930, Speaker D: I mean, they also had their explosions happen six months prior to the FTX explosion, which is probably more domiciled in the US. Just based on the connections that they had. I'm a staunch believer that 2023, if you look back on and I do this a fair amount, you look back on the trajectory of 20 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 20 19 is the best comp that we have for what 2023 will probably be. And you had things like Algorand launching in May of 2019. You had kind of like bitcoin bottoming and then three Xing really quickly. There were a lot of kind of bullish little green shoots that you could point to in 2019 that people were just getting excited about. And this was before DFI even existed as, like, a category.
01:13:15.930 - 01:13:29.006, Speaker D: And it feels like we're still on the precipice of that with the backdrop. Mike, to your point of ETH, bitcoin, DFI all having happened already, just kind of like, what is the next thing you know?
01:13:29.028 - 01:14:03.398, Speaker C: It's a crazy Asia perspective that somebody told me that basically stopped me in my track. They were like, yeah, us got wrecked last cycle. I was like, yeah, well, you guys did too. They're like, no, no, but you guys got wrecked by know, like Blockbuy Genesis. They're like, yeah, our country protected us from that. I was like, I'm not sure that's how it happened, but I understand your point, but yeah, we just looked like credibly stupid and bunch else. But some of it's, frankly, like the fault of regulators letting this stuff happen.
01:14:03.398 - 01:14:19.920, Speaker C: If you could distinguish the good guys from the bad guys, we probably would have been able to distinguish who BF was, who Alex Machinsky was. I don't even know who that Voyager guy was that was running it out of his garage. But come on, that shouldn't have been very hard to tell.
01:14:22.050 - 01:14:24.300, Speaker B: All right, guys, I've got to leave it here.
