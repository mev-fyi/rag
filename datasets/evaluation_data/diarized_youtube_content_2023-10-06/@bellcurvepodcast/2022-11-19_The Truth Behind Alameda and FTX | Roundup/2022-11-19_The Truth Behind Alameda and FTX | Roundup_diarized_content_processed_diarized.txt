00:00:00.170 - 00:00:08.640, Speaker A: Before we jump into the app, quick reminder that nothing on Bell Curve is financial advice. Everything is just a meme. Hope you guys enjoy.
00:00:11.090 - 00:00:41.746, Speaker B: When people are like, why didn't Sam just walk away from Alameda and let it die? I think it's because, A, you couldn't separate the finances. Like, we'll get into that. Like, the Enron guy was basically like, this is the worst instance of financial mismanagement I've seen my whole career. And that guy went through couldn't separate. Sam knew he couldn't separate the finances in time. But also, it seems like these businesses kind of fed on each other. Like, Alameda might have only been a profitable trading shop because of the relationship with FTX.
00:00:41.746 - 00:00:51.222, Speaker B: FTX might have only had the volumes and justified the valuation because Alameda was trading on it. I don't think you could just rip one out. I think when you rip one out, they both fail.
00:00:51.286 - 00:00:51.754, Speaker C: All right, everyone.
00:00:51.792 - 00:01:11.620, Speaker B: This episode is brought to you by our friends at Avalanche. They are the layer one blockchain that is fast, stable, and scalable. You're going to be hearing all about them later in the show. For now, let's get into it. All right, everyone, welcome back to another roundup on Bell Curve. You're joined by Michael's One and Two, yano and Vance. Fellas, it's been a week.
00:01:11.620 - 00:01:13.010, Speaker B: Been a week.
00:01:13.160 - 00:01:14.180, Speaker A: Been a week.
00:01:14.890 - 00:01:15.638, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:01:15.804 - 00:01:17.478, Speaker B: What do we feel like?
00:01:17.564 - 00:01:24.994, Speaker A: Vance? I love the pullover. Great pullover. We got rugged by Vance.
00:01:25.042 - 00:01:25.714, Speaker B: We got rugged.
00:01:25.762 - 00:01:26.870, Speaker A: 30 seconds.
00:01:28.010 - 00:01:28.760, Speaker B: Yes.
00:01:32.490 - 00:01:35.000, Speaker A: Didn't foil that. Yes.
00:01:35.450 - 00:01:36.326, Speaker B: That's amazing.
00:01:36.428 - 00:01:37.138, Speaker A: That's amazing.
00:01:37.244 - 00:01:38.618, Speaker B: For those of you following along, I.
00:01:38.624 - 00:01:43.034, Speaker D: Didn'T have time to make the antenna, but there's no radio waves getting through this.
00:01:43.072 - 00:02:27.290, Speaker B: All right, bro, I'm just going to tee you up. Vance, just take it because I got to give you credit on all this Alameda stuff. You were loud and early calling a lot of these guys out and calling bullshit on this. There are two things that I want to continue to deconstruct on this whole ongoing FTX Alameda saga. I'd love to just get everyone's take basically on the call about what really went on on Alameda. How did we wind up with this $15 billion hole? And again, I just want to like there are some facts that we're going to be talking about and then we're going to kind of wait into the realm of speculation on just how this all might have happened. And I think a lot of it was based on kind of this myth that got built up, kind of projecting Alameda as these arbitrageures printing money.
00:02:27.290 - 00:02:49.326, Speaker B: Smartest guys in the room couldn't be wrong. And I think that's starting to kind of come undone. So either Michael or Vance, maybe Vance, because you got the tinfoil hat literally on your head and you're protected from the radio waves, can you give us a breakdown of how did these guys talk about Elemeda in the beginning? What was it really like when they were soliciting funds. What's your take on how this all sort of unwound?
00:02:49.438 - 00:03:36.654, Speaker D: I mean, how it built up was in our position probably right from the start, and Sam even admitted it in that last Vox interview he gave where FTX didn't have a separate bank account. Alameda, everything just got wired to know like the idea know they created this backdoor because this problem happened last summer and this is only something that's been going on for three months. I think it's a very charitable interpretation of the situation. I think the base case is that it was extending back much further, potentially to the start of kind of both entities being commingled. But you can spend 15 billion pretty quickly. You support the price of a few tokens, that's a few billion. You have all these celebrity endorsements, all these advertisements, that's another billion.
00:03:36.654 - 00:04:05.254, Speaker D: You're buying properties on the island, you're buying houses, 200 million of property, these things go pretty quickly. And I think the base case is probably this was rotten from the start and you'd have to convince me that this only came about because of Luna and Three Arrows. It just doesn't seem to be the case. And so where did the money go? Probably into a mixture of bad trades supporting native tokens of solana that they use for collateral and just outright embezzlement or spending on FTX.
00:04:05.382 - 00:04:58.826, Speaker C: I actually don't think that it's necessarily the well, I think the smoking gun here. I actually think FTX probably had its own bank account. And the way that Sam was talking about it, he was more referring to the early days at FTX when you had commingling of FTX spinning out of so like maybe slight benefit of the doubt there. You can't have an exchange that doesn't have its own bank account in the first place. But I think the smoking gun for Sam, frankly is what the Wall Street Journal reported last weekend where it became clear that there was actually a backdoor into the accounting system, a bespoke system, software system that allowed for Alameda or FTX to lend assets to counterparties without actually changing the financials. That would get around auditor controls. Would not let anybody else at FTX actually know this.
00:04:58.826 - 00:05:20.260, Speaker C: The fact that that was created in the first mean people have gotten charged with pretty terrible crimes for much less. And so the creation of that to knowingly defraud either your counterparties, your investors or customers in this case, I think is ultimately that will be the smoking gun here.
00:05:22.390 - 00:06:07.518, Speaker B: Let's kind of take this back to the beginning here. There's a great sort of breakdown. It's classic in crypto by someone named Milky Eggs. Milky Eggs gave us the goods here, but there's a piece, and we'll link to it in the show notes called What Happened at Alameda. This was put together in response to the New York Times piece that frankly, we should talk about, which is definitely gave pretty charitable treatment to someone that's in Sam's position, I would say. But basically they kind of tried to piece together kind of the history of Alameda and how things might have gone wrong. So there are some kind of facts that are laid out in the beginning and then we kind of wade into the speculation as everyone tries to fit a narrative on just how this could have gone so badly.
00:06:07.518 - 00:07:14.678, Speaker B: Right? And I think what's worth maybe talking about is at least like my perception of Alameda pre two weeks ago was that they were kind of these arbitrageur, smartest guys in the room. And I think you can trace back that perception to these interviews that Sam would give that probably many of you in the space have heard, which is, oh, yeah, we made our money initially by closing down the Kimchi premium, right, or the premium that existed in between bitcoin that trade on US. Domiciled exchanges versus Asian domiciled exchanges. It looks like they didn't get the South Korean one, but there was a premium in between Japanese Bitcoin exchanges, like Bitflyer, et cetera, and like Coinbase. And he kind of told this story in a way that made it seem like they made a whole bunch of money closing down those spreads, and they sort of let you assume that that's what they were doing to continue to make their money. But obviously that isn't really what happened, right? Going through this. It kind of lays out this narrative or a potential thought process for what might have happened, where maybe initially they were doing that and they made some money by doing that.
00:07:14.678 - 00:08:22.000, Speaker B: But then it posits that whatever edge they had in the beginning started to get crowded out as more capital, more sophisticated capital, kind of came into the space. And once they weren't able to make as much money just making markets and providing liquidity, they started to basically just punt on longs. And they referenced a couple of tweets that I remember actually from know, a couple years ago when he was basically describing the strategy of being long doge whenever Elon would tweet. And I was kind of like, yeah, he did do that. He did do that. And I don't know, I wanted to get your guys take because I kind of think it comes full circle with this podcast and Bell Curve, because there's like the guy on the left of the Bell Curve and then there's the guy on the right. And I would posit to you that maybe the guy on the right doesn't exist and it's been a bunch of left Bell Curve guys all along, that's for sure.
00:08:22.690 - 00:08:34.686, Speaker A: I think that's the right take. The milky eggs, by the way. Great blog name. Got to put milk in the eggs, makes them fluffy. Got it. Much fluffier. I think that's the right take.
00:08:34.686 - 00:09:11.806, Speaker A: It does seem like Alameda basically started as a bunch of people from Jane Street and a bunch of traders who thought that they could make some money. They made some money, maybe 510, 15 million on an arbitrage play. They built a successful market making firm. I mean, the numbers were there. Like, I remember seeing the BitMEX leaderboard, they were consistently at the top of the BitMEX leaderboard. It's not like they weren't making money. But at the end of the day, a market making firm can only scale as large as like a market neutral firm can only scale as large as the industry scales, right? And so I think what ended up happening is they had this successful market making firm in 2018, 2019, making a bunch of money.
00:09:11.806 - 00:09:42.630, Speaker A: Then the market turns, COVID happens. March 2020, market starts to go long. When you are a market neutral firm and you see all these people who you think are dumber than you making a boatload of money, well, then you start just taking these just punting on these levered long plays. And I think that's like the first thing that I think where shit really started to hit the fan is when they moved from a market neutral firm to just this degen levered long retail portfolio.
00:09:44.250 - 00:10:03.846, Speaker C: One thing to also note here is just like there is a scale difference where if you're a market making firm and you're actually market neutral making markets going off and finding arbitrage spreads, that only scales to a certain extent to the point where you're not able to punt a million dollars through those trades.
00:10:03.878 - 00:10:04.686, Speaker B: Maybe you were able to do that.
00:10:04.708 - 00:10:42.094, Speaker C: With 10,000 or 10,0000, but the second you increase by an order of magnitude scale, which their balance sheet obviously did, your absolute return market neutral trading strategies just don't work at the same level. And so you can't continue that path. I think there is an element here of just like them getting caught up in themselves, getting too big to be able to continue with the strategy that they started with in 2018. And in 2020 you had DFI Summer and why not just go off and yield farm with balance sheet of stablecoins? So it's kind of no surprise that they shifted strategies, but there is an element of they just weren't able to continue their strategy because they had too much capital.
00:10:42.162 - 00:11:13.346, Speaker B: Can you address actually that exact like, I've heard I think I've heard you guys say this, but you were also pretty early in DeFi and yield farms. And you can actually go back and listen to some of the SBF interviews where he was like, best way to think of us is we provide liquidity. We close down spreads, like in exchanges and different regulatory jurisdictions, and then in weirder spaces, like, you know, the implication being we basically farmed and then dumped and took billions of dollars out of these yield farms. You guys were kind of there. How possible was that really to do in size?
00:11:13.528 - 00:11:45.854, Speaker D: Well, impossible. You could have a couple of things break your way and make like nine figures on something, but pretty much impossible. I think what would be worth doing is just going over what do quantitative firms like Alameda do as like a set of strategies and what is their capacity and what's the potential payoff. So arbitrage pretty small. That's like a small firm's game. Jump is not really doing that stuff. Like the most sophisticated ones, they tend to do things called signals trading, which we'll get into.
00:11:45.854 - 00:12:23.610, Speaker D: But the pure Arbitrage, it's trading on exchange X and it's different price on exchange Y. That's both a very small ARB and it's also been mostly taken out since all of these more sophisticated firms have come in. So that's not really something that we see firms do. And it always seems suspicious that SBF had this theoretical ARB which made all of his money. Those facts never tied. So that's like one strategy people run like Arbitraging, the next one is just vanilla market making. What is market making conceptually? So the mechanical transaction that happens is a token project or somebody else wants to get their asset market made.
00:12:23.610 - 00:12:40.878, Speaker D: They will give the market makers, Alameda, Jump, whatever, a loan of these tokens for free with an option for them to buy these tokens at a very cheap price. So if it moves against them, they can collateralize and hedge it out. But if it goes up in value, they can buy it and seek some profit from it. So that's like the second thing that they'll do.
00:12:40.964 - 00:12:42.142, Speaker B: One quick note on that.
00:12:42.196 - 00:13:39.026, Speaker C: So it's also important to note the different order types and exchange types that you're talking about. A centralized limit order book is the only way that you can actually be a traditional market maker. Because what you're effectively doing is you're setting bids beneath wherever the market clearing price is and you're setting ask orders above. And basically what you're trying to do is provide this spread where you're trying to enable more liquidity by being a constant provider of orders that go into the centralized limit order book. But as we know with AMMS or constant function market making concept, you just can't do that, right? The function itself is what determines the market clearing price. And so it's very different and it can only work on centralized exchanges. And this is kind of the whole pitch that you had with Alameda plus FTX is that FTX had the deepest liquidity because Alameda was the traditional market maker behind FTX making all of these esoteric markets in a centralized way.
00:13:39.026 - 00:13:40.340, Speaker C: So just one.
00:13:42.870 - 00:14:16.574, Speaker D: So Arbitrage not that profitable, small market making profitable, but it's like a very manual business. This isn't know you're going to blow somebody's lights out with how intellectually stimulating this is. It's mostly a transactional relationship and you set the bids and asks within a range and that's how you make markets. It's not actually that hard, but it's not that profitable either, unless you hit like a token that goes up 1000 X, you redeem the option, you make a ton of money, whatever. So the third stuff that we see people do is signals trading. This is the most difficult thing to do, it's the most profitable thing to do. You can make a billion dollars doing this.
00:14:16.574 - 00:14:43.494, Speaker D: If you have the right team. It only takes five or ten people, but basically nobody in this industry can do it. We've seen a couple of people successful, but not over a long period of time. But that's like the super quant side of the world. And I don't think Alameda was actually doing that. I don't think that was one of the strategies that they had. It was more like market making, kind of like dumb money, trying to make money on that yield, farming and then just going long stuff like Alameda was never researching much.
00:14:43.494 - 00:14:48.978, Speaker D: It was always like a very manual trading operation in our view, that wasn't that sophisticated.
00:14:49.154 - 00:15:34.514, Speaker B: Now I want to start to, we kind of started to get into this, but or Michael, you mentioned this, the value prop of the relationship between FTX and Alameda, because I think that's really important. And people are like, why didn't he just bail on Alameda, right, and save FTX? And I actually have a theory about that, but I want to get your guys take as well. So exchanges, when they're getting started, have this thing called the cold start problem, right? Which is basically the value of the exchange is you need to have deep liquidity so that spread that you guys were talking about can be as thin as possible. So that people want to trade more. Liquidity begets thinner spreads, so like liquidity begets liquidity. And that's how you're supposed to get started. The problem is, how do you get it? In the beginning, so Alameda had this, they sort of raised capital.
00:15:34.514 - 00:16:19.974, Speaker B: They raised like debt capital. Actually. This is now getting passed around as well, like allegedly, right? They were raising at 15% return, no risk, which is itself kind of like a junior move, right? It did raise some red flags back in the day, I think. But however they did it, they successfully raised basically debt capital and they started trading basically punching way above their weight class in terms of trading liquidity. But it seems like Sam kind of had other plans and either because he wanted to and saw more opportunity, or because he thought he needed to, he basically saw put an exchange, a derivatives exchange. And this accomplished two things. One, it allows him to solve the cold start problem on the exchange side of things, because boom, he had a built in market maker that was already punching above its weight class from day one.
00:16:19.974 - 00:17:15.560, Speaker B: And B, it provided a way for Alameda, the firm, to extract profits. Because what everyone has basically long suspected and has now been officially confirmed, is that Alameda had both priority access and they could trade in front of other people that were trading on the exchange, but they also were the liquidation agent for the exchange. And this is, I think, a really important thing to point out. So when derivative exchanges, when margin positions are liquidated, right, someone has to sell that off. So when market times are good, it's a really good way to make profits, right? Because you basically take the collateral, sell it, and you get some small percentage of that. It should be really easy. But when the market is moving very fast, it's much harder to warehouse risk, right? So if you take that collateral and then you own it and suddenly you own the risk, you can't flip it in time to basically make the small spread that you were allowed as a market maker before.
00:17:15.560 - 00:18:05.654, Speaker B: So this is all setting up for what might have happened here. And it looks like these guys basically got in trouble around Luna. Like the collapse of Three Arrows and Luna same time as everyone else. And it looks like there was like a whole bunch of things that happened all at the same time, which is when Three Arrows blew out, there was an enormous amount of liquidations that happened on FTX, the exchange. So a big profit making machine for Alameda in good times, when they get to liquidate that collateral and sell it and keep some of the profits, they got screwed on because it looks like they didn't have as good of technology as they kind of advertised. They basically had to warehouse a bunch of bad debt and then they took an enormous L on that. At the same time, all the loans that they had given out to decentralized lenders were getting called in.
00:18:05.654 - 00:18:42.850, Speaker B: And so that kind of explains why they went in and bailed out all of these lenders which had loans that were collateralized with. Like when people are like, why didn't Sam just walk away from Alameda and let it die? I think it's because, A, you couldn't separate the finances. Like, we'll get into that. Like the Enron guy was basically like, this is the worst instance of financial mismanagement I've seen my whole career. And that guy went through couldn't separate. Sam knew he couldn't separate the finances in time. But also, it seems like these businesses kind of fed on each other.
00:18:42.850 - 00:18:57.298, Speaker B: Like, Alameda might have only been a profitable trading shop because of the relationship with FTX. FTX might have only had the volumes and justified the valuation because Alameda was trading on it. I don't think you could just rip one out. I think when you rip one out, they both fail.
00:18:57.474 - 00:19:31.140, Speaker A: I think that second one is the more important one. So I think if you looked at, actually FTX's clients, they only got the retail clients at the very end of FTX. Really, FTX was this exchange with a very small amount of clients. And if you actually look at their trading volume, someone printed, I forget some anon account. It was like 40 or 50% of their volume. Alameda was one side of the trade. So basically what FTX was doing sometimes they would price off market even by a fraction of a basis point.
00:19:31.140 - 00:20:17.060, Speaker A: That drove institutions to then go use FTX because even like very small bips, they could pick that off all day. So institutions would go use FTX. Now FTX would show these large institutional volumes. They could use those volumes to secure credit lines and fee benefits at exchanges, which could then allow them to price differently than others. So now FTX basically had the ability to present these super high volumes. So if you actually look at it in that light, FTX was just this loss making prop shop that wrote off losses as a way to drive volumes, which then they could go take to Sequoia and to all these other VCs. And the VCs would mistakenly see those as acquisition cost of customers.
00:20:17.060 - 00:20:27.240, Speaker A: And they painted this pretty picture of like it was essentially that FTX was like a prop shop trying to secure the valuation of a large fintech company.
00:20:28.170 - 00:21:43.134, Speaker C: So it's definitely that. I think it actually goes a lot deeper than that, which is the crux of this whole thing comes down to FTT and SRM. And the reason why it comes down to that is because FTT, which is one of the major balance sheet items that was rumored to be on the Alameda balance sheet in June of this year, remember, FTT is propped up by 25% of the weekly profits of FTX, right? And so 25% goes to FTT burn, which increases the value of FTT, but also enables this. And we looked at serum, we also looked at Ftet way back in the day, passed on both for a number of reasons. Serum was a lot kind of sketchier, but basically they had this model where it was a seven year distribution, which is probably about twice as long as we would see from any other protocol token. They also had insiders owning 40% of it, which meant, and it was not very well described as to who was owning it, how it was going to be owned. But imagine you have this really low float token that you just created out of thin air, where you own 40% of it.
00:21:43.134 - 00:22:31.894, Speaker C: And you have this machine that enables you to hyperinflate the value of this asset. What you can then do is you can then go say I have all this locked FTT, I'm going to post this collateral so that we can borrow dollars against that, and we can borrow billions of assets against that, propped up asset, strong assets being borrowed against inflated assets. And I think that's kind of where this whole multi billion dollar balance sheet came from in the first that, that is where this whole thing got started. I think FTX was a mechanism of propping this whole thing up. But it was definitely the FTT token and then more recently the SRM token in the same mechanism that really I think are the driving forces behind all of this.
00:22:31.952 - 00:23:48.798, Speaker D: The other thing that we knew, but probably the VCs who did this deal didn't know, is that Binance is the price discovery venue for basically everything that we do. And when you buy on Binance you see like slowly get armed up and it's basically just mirroring the liquidity on Binance with a bunch of stale positions facilitated by Alameda. And so it just kind of furthers the idea that this was actually just like a prop shop trying to get a technology company valuation. My takeaway from all the bankruptcy filings and stuff is sam rarely had a good directional sense of what the state of his finances were. Which implies that everything was so commingled and so just jumbled and run by the seat of their pants. That if you think that you have a plus or -10% understanding of your finances but then the market goes down 90% and so do your assets that plus or -10% becomes the entire value of your customers collateral Liabilities and so, at the end of the day, the fact that they didn't have an account, they literally had no accounting department, is insane to me. You need to know where all and we know where all of our dollars are at any given time we can move them between places we know the exact state of our finances.
00:23:48.798 - 00:23:53.574, Speaker D: That's how a professional runs an organization. This is just like pure amateur hour.
00:23:53.772 - 00:23:54.886, Speaker C: This is what it comes down to.
00:23:54.908 - 00:23:56.198, Speaker D: And this is another subject that I.
00:23:56.204 - 00:24:26.354, Speaker C: Think is worth discussing. Everyone is talking about, oh well, he was getting really close to the regulators and they didn't do anything to protect us. Actually I think that they did because they prevented ftx.com from entering the US customer base. That was never going to be a viable option to get millions and millions of US people onto this platform. You have FTS, us and the bankruptcy proceedings will determine what happens there. It is siloed away from both Fts.com,
00:24:26.354 - 00:25:02.400, Speaker C: Alameda and all the other acquisitions. So you would assume that there's higher chances of FTX customers getting their deposits back, but I think this is just a failure. This is not a failure of regulators. I think it's actually potentially a sign that there was some smoke and they assumed that there was fire. The other question that I wanted to pose to this broader group, which I've been kind of like ratling around in my head over the last week, looking at trying to get into the mental state of where Sam was at any point in time. Which asset between FTX and Alameda do you think he personally valued more?
00:25:02.770 - 00:25:03.950, Speaker B: Alameda?
00:25:04.450 - 00:25:05.440, Speaker C: 100%.
00:25:07.650 - 00:25:38.170, Speaker B: And I think the reason why is it's really hard to even in a simple sentence describe what he was doing. It was kind of like what Jason was saying it was like a prop shop that was like sucking in VC money via this inflated valuation that was also sucking in dollar denominated debt via a bullshit token. And the way he laundered it was through Alameda. That's why it was so necessary, because the way he took all the money out and sent it, the laundering mechanism was Alameda. And that's why it was the most important thing to him.
00:25:38.240 - 00:25:46.470, Speaker C: Precisely. I think FTX was a mechanism and sort of a necessary to have, but I think Alameda was his bank.
00:25:46.630 - 00:25:47.740, Speaker B: Yeah, that's what I.
00:25:50.030 - 00:26:03.200, Speaker D: And the loans from FTX to Alameda to Paper Crane, which he owns. Paper Crane and the loans from oh, it's just crazy. How could you? I just do not believe that.
00:26:05.250 - 00:26:06.526, Speaker A: You'Re working FTX. What?
00:26:06.548 - 00:26:22.946, Speaker D: Like you're just like, moving stuff around like hot and cold wallets. Like you don't notice coins are missing. You're working in Alameda. You just keep taking big L's on trades. Like, you just keep getting refilled with more money. I don't believe that only three or four people knew about this. Maybe three or four people only facilitated the fraud.
00:26:22.946 - 00:26:30.022, Speaker D: But mathematically, if I wake up and there's 100 million more in our trading accounts, I'm wondering where it came from.
00:26:30.076 - 00:26:56.330, Speaker B: All right, everyone, quick break from this episode to talk about our show sponsors, Avalanche. Many of you know Avalanche as the fast, reliable, and scalable layer one. The folks at Avalanche have a really great message for those of you who are in the crypto industry right now, which is bear markets are for building. So while a bunch of our friends over in CFI are kind of going through these struggles and travails, the folks at Avalanche have basically put their heads down and are shipping products that builders want. The latest solution. Elastics subnets.
00:26:56.410 - 00:27:08.674, Speaker A: Right. And just to expand on that, avalanche is consistently upgrading all of their platforms. Right? So on the platform side, you've got Elastic Subnets, you've got new VMs. On the infrastructure side of things, you've got Core, which Mike, I know you used that the other day.
00:27:08.712 - 00:27:10.730, Speaker B: I was a bridge or I was a bridgeor.
00:27:10.830 - 00:27:24.698, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. So they're upgrading the infrastructure side with Core and Enclave. The chain has had, like, no downtime super customizable for devs. Yeah, if you're a builder. AVAX Network. AVAX Network, great place to be.
00:27:24.784 - 00:27:28.934, Speaker B: But do Yano and I as well. So you definitely go check them out. But click the link at the bottom of this episode.
00:27:28.982 - 00:27:29.530, Speaker A: Click the link.
00:27:29.600 - 00:27:33.610, Speaker B: Otherwise you're not going to get any credit. Come on, click the link at the bottom. Give us the credit.
00:27:33.680 - 00:27:40.798, Speaker A: Exactly. So, yeah, big thanks to Avalanche. You just had a great experience with them the other day on the user side of things.
00:27:40.964 - 00:27:49.266, Speaker B: Go check them out. Guys, thank us later. Let's get back to the show. All right. I wanted to flag this. We got to eventually talk about this Vox article that he.
00:27:49.288 - 00:27:49.522, Speaker D: Gave.
00:27:49.576 - 00:28:13.020, Speaker B: But for those of you who haven't seen this, we'll link it again in the show notes. But for God only knows what reason, sam gave a super weird DM interview to a reporter at Vox who, to her credit, did a great job covering this. And he said some pretty outlandish stuff. Like, everyone basically had their own oh, my God, I can't believe he saw this. Actually, Vance, I think I saw you tweet out about this. At first I was like.
00:28:14.830 - 00:28:15.258, Speaker D: It took.
00:28:15.264 - 00:28:41.742, Speaker B: Me like a full hour to even believe that it was real. But this is what to me was like the AHA moment. I'm reading the part from the reporter here. So there was no point of, like, quote, let's lend out customer deposits, quote, just various financial instruments that ended up adding up to that. And you didn't see how they added up to that? Sam yeah. Like, oh, FTX doesn't have a bank account. I guess people can just wire money to Alameda to get money on FTX.
00:28:41.742 - 00:29:08.518, Speaker B: Dot, dot, dot. Three years later, dot, dot, dot. Oh, fuck. It looks like people wired 8 billion to Alameda and that oh, God, we basically forgot about this dub that corresponded to that. So it was never delivered to FTX. I was kind of just looking at that, being like, dude, did you just admit that the funds never even made it to FTX? I know everyone had their own little thing to point out from that, but this, to me, was the smoking gun. I mean, at the very least, that's wire fraud.
00:29:08.518 - 00:29:14.910, Speaker B: But did you guys not think that, like, I thought this was such an odd thing to admit.
00:29:15.250 - 00:29:43.254, Speaker D: The big thing is that the words on this page, this is Sam's tone. This is how Sam actually thinks within his own head, like all the other effective altruism. Like, we're going to do it's. Like, no, you're actually this guy. This is how you talk when the doors are closed, and this is who you actually are. And that, to me, was obviously one of the things that stood out. But him saying, fuck regulators, him saying the whole ethics thing was just a know.
00:29:43.254 - 00:30:10.638, Speaker D: Him actually admitting to these, like, he's clearly in a very frantic know. Our sources say that he's still in the Bahamas, but just pacing around the apartment that he has and he's, like, freaking the other residents out and the building is trying to get him to stop. Like, that's where he is right now. And I think it's very conclusive that crimes were committed here. And if he doesn't get held accountable, I don't really know what to believe at that point. That's why I have the tinfoil hat on.
00:30:10.724 - 00:30:22.770, Speaker B: We're going to get to the tinfoil hat. How is he not in jail? I can't be the only one thinking this, right? Where are the announcements?
00:30:23.190 - 00:31:20.070, Speaker C: The most recent account is that at least the Manhattan District Attorney's office is preparing criminal charges. We'll see, right. But if that goes through, I mean, that would happen over the next couple of days. Also now it becomes abundantly clear that there was not just like errors of omission or he forgot about certain things or like oh, he got over his let's portray him in the same way that the New York Times did in that Puff piece article that they wrote. How stupid must you feel as the writer for The New York Times? I mean, this just makes you and the entire publication look like you don't do any diligence and you have a complete slant and you have a vested interest in portraying facts in a certain way. But when you see this storyline come out and the narrative now that this is the real Sam, and this is how he actually thinks, and this is what he's literally saying to another reporter this is the real one, and this is the one who had malice and intent.
00:31:21.050 - 00:31:31.558, Speaker A: I don't get how he's not in jail right now. Look at Bernie Madoff. The day the Feds found out that he had used client funds to cover fund obligations, that guy was in handcuffs.
00:31:31.734 - 00:31:38.038, Speaker C: The same day I think he turned himself in. I think there's a lot of it's.
00:31:38.054 - 00:31:41.738, Speaker A: Not like Sam's on the run. We know where the guy lives. I can tell you right now on.
00:31:41.744 - 00:32:16.162, Speaker C: A map where he totally, totally I actually had a conversation with people who are in the know about this. It is actually hard to get somebody even if they are there is an extradition process and policy for that country even if that is going know this is not a US company even though they filed for bankruptcy court protection in like there is some process to it all versus like Bernie Madoff who know a few blocks down the street from the district attorney's office. So I think there is something to it. But I think the days of Sam being free are numbered.
00:32:16.226 - 00:32:24.970, Speaker D: One of my friend's dads bumped into him at the grocery store in Albany in the Bahamas, I think two days ago. He's just like buying some food because he's hungry.
00:32:28.110 - 00:32:30.570, Speaker A: While he's jacked up on all those amphetamines.
00:32:31.310 - 00:32:38.366, Speaker D: Yeah, turns out he doesn't have Parkinson's either. Who would have thought? He's just wearing fucking patches that give.
00:32:38.388 - 00:33:39.220, Speaker B: You I want to point something out about the New York Times article which just really surprised. So I want to share actually Austin already had a great tweet about this that I thought kind of summed it all up pretty nicely. But basically he's got a New York Times coverage of Coinbase after they had layoffs to FTX, defrauding customers going bankrupt, disappearing with $10 billion worth of other people's money. This is a lot of media. Media is unbiased and reports the facts, but they interject their editorial opinion in their parentheticals and the context that they choose to give in a particular story. So look at coinbase rose to prominence as one of the first major cryptocurrency companies, a gateway to the chaotic world of digital assets for amateur investors. But as it has grown from plucky startup to publicly traded company, its status as an industry leader has been threatened by a series of missteps and a steep decline in the crypto markets over the next six months.
00:33:39.220 - 00:34:06.550, Speaker B: Here's another one. But as Coinbase grew, projects started to feel overstaffed, and the decision making process slowed amid layers of bureaucracy. According to five people familiar with the company, long time employees were considered concerned that new hires felt rudderless. One person said and joked that you could tell the length of someone's tenure at Coinbase by the number of times the new recruits came asking them for help. Even the Super Bowl ad didn't nearly come together. As the game approached, coinbase hadn't settled on an idea. Employees discussed the possibility of selling back the airtime.
00:34:06.550 - 00:34:20.058, Speaker B: All right, what are they really talking about here? Like, remove this language. These are minor mess ups that every company goes through, right? But the impression that you have when you read this is like, wow, this is a tangled organization.
00:34:20.154 - 00:34:20.510, Speaker A: Right?
00:34:20.580 - 00:34:22.206, Speaker B: That phrasing is very important.
00:34:22.388 - 00:34:25.300, Speaker C: That is growing pains for any company of that size.
00:34:25.670 - 00:34:53.318, Speaker B: Literally any company. Now listen to the way listen to the parenthetical. Listen to the way this reporter contextualized this. Even as he kept hiring down, Mr. Bankman Fried built an ambitious philanthropic operation, invested in dozens of other crypto companies, bought stock in the trading firm Robinhood, donated to political campaigns, gave media interviews, and offered Elon Musk billions of dollars to help finance the Mogul's Twitter takeover. Mr. Bankman Fried said he wished he'd, quote, we'd bitten off a little less.
00:34:53.318 - 00:35:12.240, Speaker B: The ventress staff was probably not really worth it, given the risk, the attention that it took, he said, referring to his investments in other companies. Perhaps Mr. Bankman Fried's most ambitious aim was to shape crypto regulation in Washington, where he testified to Congress and met with regulators. What is the impression that you get from those words that that reporter chose to use?
00:35:13.730 - 00:35:16.066, Speaker C: It's more about your politics, less about.
00:35:16.088 - 00:35:45.802, Speaker D: What actually happened if the fraud had never unwound. It's very key to understand this. All of these people were rooting for SBF to win a global. Well educated, effective, altruism, very liberal. He was like patient zero for, okay, who's going to be the next guy to beat the drum for the neoliberal bandwagon? And it just didn't work. And they're having a hard time letting go. And I think that many people have told them that there's a chance that it might not be over.
00:35:45.802 - 00:35:51.770, Speaker D: But guys, it's in Chapter eleven right now. Sam is like, oh, we're raising money. Raising money for what?
00:35:51.840 - 00:36:09.406, Speaker A: I just don't get it. Even this morning, after all this has come out, the Washington Post came out with an article saying Sam was, like, on track to save the world from another. I don't, I don't get it. I'm so confused.
00:36:09.598 - 00:36:23.350, Speaker C: Let me turn this around then. You two, as co founders of a news organization, what do you think? How do you view the dichotomy of reporting? How do you view the perspective and the choice of inclusion of opinion into this?
00:36:23.420 - 00:37:23.462, Speaker B: I think it's actually the media background that makes me think this is even weirder than other people are saying, because sourcing, you're supposed to dual source things, right? It's very OD that even in like, a puff piece interview about someone that you wouldn't get someone else to interject commentary on that thing, right. So the choice of word to not even include the allegations is a very OD choice from an editorial perspective. To not include another voice that would provide a contrary opinion is almost like that's like bare minimum stuff. So I would just say I found it extremely OD. And I actually think our media background makes me think it's even weirder than most people are. They're just like, oh, it's weird that they covered it nicely. I think it was irresponsible journalism.
00:37:23.526 - 00:37:36.094, Speaker D: Let me ask you guys this. What did you make of Vox coming out with that puff piece and then that other reporter just like, screenshotting her DMs and being like, no, this guy's actually a really bad guy. Because it felt like that was like.
00:37:36.132 - 00:38:15.500, Speaker B: Infighting almost that's not necessarily how I interpreted it. Look, I actually really believe in media. I deeply believe in it. I think there are bad examples of it, but there's a whole conversation here to be had around citizen journalism that I'm relatively skeptical of. I think good journalism is really great and needed. If you've ever talked to reporters, like, the good ones are super concerned with getting it right, almost to an annoying degree, right. They're very NIT picky about the facts, and it's good because someone has to be right? It's good to be very forward looking and very optimistic, but you kind of need someone to be like, hey, guys, can we do some basic fact checks? And that's what media is supposed to do.
00:38:15.500 - 00:39:00.322, Speaker B: There was a little piece at the bottom, which I really appreciated of that Vox article, which was like, we checked with Sam in the morning. Hey, did we have a conversation last night or did you get hacked? To which he responded, no, that was literally, I thought I don't know, I kind of thought Vox killed it on that. I didn't necessarily get that sense of inviting. I think it was frankly, if you hadn't included the screenshots, it would have been unbelievable. I don't think anyone would have believed it. I saw the screenshots in myself, and I have a pretty low opinion of the guy at this point, but I still couldn't believe that he would do that interview. I think they needed to include the screenshots, otherwise it just boggled the mind, frankly.
00:39:00.322 - 00:39:21.550, Speaker B: I don't know what to make that. That's how I took it. I don't know. Yan, if you have any other opinions there. Yeah, very weird. So I guess it's an unfolding situation. A lot of this stuff is like I think I'm very curious to see what happens when more facts come to light.
00:39:21.550 - 00:39:33.234, Speaker B: I think all of us have a vested interest in the space. I would love to see justice done in whatever form that takes. Unless you guys have any closing thoughts on this.
00:39:33.352 - 00:40:03.466, Speaker A: I have a closing thought. On the media side of things, I'm not going to compare. I think it was a really bright light for a bright week, two weeks for crypto media in general. You had a lot of things getting basically uncovered by, like all right, so first off, a lot of stuff. There were like on chain sleuths that literally looked at the blockchain and uncovered crimes. It's amazing then that stuff would go to citizen journalists on, like, Twitter. Citizen journalism is interesting because you can aggregate all this news and it happens really quickly.
00:40:03.466 - 00:40:24.066, Speaker A: The problem with that, though, is there's like half of it is rumor and half of it is true. Or probably like 90% is rumor, 10% is true. That's the problem with all the Twitter citizen journals. And that's one of the areas where crypto media, Blockworks, but also other publications. Right. All this kicked off with CoinDesk. Yeah, CoinDesk murdered it.
00:40:24.066 - 00:40:59.774, Speaker A: CoinDesk did an amazing job. Huge shout to Ian Allison, like one of the best journalists in crypto. This all started with Ian Allison's piece. I think it was just the whole spectrum of media, starting with the data side and the on chain stuff to the Twitter journalists. And then even after the fact, after a news story had broken, like podcasts, honestly, a lot of blockworks shows. And Laura Shin and Bankless did an amazing job of bringing folks on to actually explain the situation. And I got really excited about the impact that someone like Blockworks makes on the industry and just the impact that media and all the people.
00:40:59.774 - 00:41:13.220, Speaker A: I feel like we came together as an industry to figure out the facts here. And a lot of this shit wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for thousands of people working kind of around the clock. Totally agree with that.
00:41:14.070 - 00:41:20.982, Speaker C: This is, I think, by far the biggest story in business this entire year. By far.
00:41:21.116 - 00:41:21.800, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:41:22.730 - 00:41:26.486, Speaker A: And then sorry, the other side of this is then mainstream media just completely botched it.
00:41:26.508 - 00:41:29.980, Speaker B: And I was like, completely botched it.
00:41:31.470 - 00:41:41.518, Speaker D: Is any of their reporting about anything true? If they're covering wars halfway around the world, what are the chances that the information they're reporting is factual? It makes me question that's what I.
00:41:41.524 - 00:41:47.040, Speaker C: Was going to say. It's damning in a lot of ways, I agree.
00:41:49.730 - 00:41:57.602, Speaker B: I don't have a good response because it's been really disheartening to watch how this has been covered in the main.
00:41:57.656 - 00:42:05.506, Speaker A: That's why people have such it's interesting, actually. I was on a call with a fashion executive weirdly yesterday, and they were.
00:42:05.528 - 00:42:13.146, Speaker B: Talking about how the meat sorry, pretelia.
00:42:13.278 - 00:42:42.538, Speaker A: Context around that really boring story. It's one of those calls that mike, you always say I'm wasting my time by taking all these random ass calls, but I just like taking them because I like meeting people. Totally had nothing to do with crypto, and I probably was wasting time taking it. But interesting guy. Interesting guy. But he was talking about the media and journalism behind fashion. He's like, New York Times, CNN, they all get it wrong, but there's these b to b trade publications that get it right, and it makes me think that that exists in every single industry.
00:42:42.538 - 00:43:04.950, Speaker A: He's like, the only media publication I trust is, like, the business of Fashion, I think it's called. Went to the website, cool Company. Sounds like they're crushing it. He's like, when The New York Times writes about a deal in the fashion space, they just literally get the facts wrong and then blow right past it. So, I don't know, I'm long on niche. More like trade publications and industry pubs.
00:43:05.610 - 00:43:24.190, Speaker B: Who could that reference I like that. Who could that be referencing? This has been a ten minute heavy show up. All right, we got to move past the blockbuster shield. I want to move on to the Genesis story because that was the other implosion that sort of happened this weekend, this week. That was yesterday.
00:43:24.610 - 00:43:47.438, Speaker A: Yeah. The backstory of Genesis, for those who don't like Genesis started was the first OTC bitcoin desk. In 2013, barry Silbert started them. They're now crypto's largest lending desk. Their numbers were massive. Like, if you look at a snapshot of their numbers a year ago, 50 billion in loan originations. Twelve and a half billion in active loans, 30 billion in spot volume traded, 20 billion in derivatives traded.
00:43:47.438 - 00:44:04.598, Speaker A: And then basically Three Arrows happened and they started to blow up. So Genesis was the biggest creditor to Three Arrows. They lent them, like, two and a half billion dollars. Genesis filed, like, a $1.2 billion claim. DCG stepped in, assumed the claim. That left Genesis, with no outstanding liabilities, tied to Three Arrows.
00:44:04.598 - 00:44:23.470, Speaker A: People were like, okay, it's all good. Then things continued to unravel. Genesis got hit super hard by Babel Finance. Babel Finance is kind of like a blockfly, I think, in Asia. So that was in June. Then in August, they laid off 20% of the team. Michael Morrow resigned or got asked to leave.
00:44:23.470 - 00:44:51.398, Speaker A: I don't really know the deal there. Basically everyone I know at Genesis at that point in time, in August started to basically leave. Why the downfall? Yesterday, Genesis announced that they were stopping withdrawals. Why that's so important is because they're basically the yield product for every CFI platform. And how that works is you essentially give your, like, let's take Gemini. So Gemini's earn product is powered by Genesis. So what happens is you give your crypto to Gemini.
00:44:51.398 - 00:45:11.642, Speaker A: Gemini gives your crypto to Genesis. Genesis lends your crypto to a fund who thinks that they can make money using your money. The fund borrows from Genesis at like, I'm going to make up numbers here. 10%. Genesis passes on some of that yield to Gemini, let's say 8%. And then Gemini gives you 6%. So, voila.
00:45:11.642 - 00:45:56.974, Speaker A: Now you have yield. This whole system only works if the counterparties that Genesis lent to can actually repay their borrow. If Genesis can't actually get their crypto back, they can't give the crypto back to Gemini or to any other crypto CFI platform, which means the CFI platform can't give you, the user, your crypto back. So that's one side of why it's really bad. And the other side is just like, if you are kind of a retail user and you want to earn yield, you give it to BlockFi or Gemini, and you get like 5%. If you're an institution or just a crypto whale or like a family office and you want to earn yield, you can kind of skip the BlockFi, like the app process and just give it to Genesis. So a lot of family offices and crypto whales that I know, they basically just give their money to Genesis and earn X percentage on it.
00:45:56.974 - 00:46:11.730, Speaker A: So the reason that Genesis halting withdrawals is so bad is they sit at the direct center of crypto's capital markets, right? They custody funds. They help institutions earn yield, and they are the yield product for CFI platforms. So that's why it's bad that they're halting withdrawals.
00:46:12.230 - 00:46:43.566, Speaker D: Let me explain how we think, or I think that they got into trouble. It starts with GBTC. So GBTC is a product that is created by Grayscale. Genesis is a company that is also under the DCG umbrella with Grayscale. What that means for Genesis is that they are an affiliate trust party. What that means mechanically is that if I am an affiliate trust party and I have GBTC on my balance sheet, I can't go into the open market and sell. So, you know, that's an issue.
00:46:43.566 - 00:47:04.434, Speaker D: And the bigger issue is that they were taking GBTC as collateral. And so the R Bloop works something like this. Suzu and Kyle roll up with GBTC that they've created. They give it to Genesis, they take dollars against it. They buy BTC. They create GBTC. They give more GBTC to know.
00:47:04.434 - 00:47:30.938, Speaker D: They do it over and over and over again, and then they're super levered, right? And if things go badly, Genesis can't sell that collateral. And so that's the core issue. And our understanding of Three Arrows was like, they were traders. They would punch medium sized tickets, whatever. But there was that one day where they announced that they had like 7% of the GBTC trust, and that was like the, okay, shit, Three Arrows has arrived. They're actually way bigger than anybody thought, but nobody knew how they got there.
00:47:31.024 - 00:48:11.642, Speaker B: I was going to jump in to point something out about an interview that Three Arrows gave a little while ago after all this came in bloomberg and what they're doubling down on, which was the only mistake that they made, was that they couldn't have accounted for, is that they didn't know other people would follow them into the trade. Which is like the funniest thing ever, because obviously finance is like the it's like one of the primary risks that you should be concerned with is a trade getting overcrowded. And I actually forgot about this until you just reminded me. They gave an interview. It was the block stating how big their position was. They fucking told everyone they levered this up, right?
00:48:11.776 - 00:48:55.334, Speaker D: And Genesis now has collateral that they literally cannot sell, which is like the cardinal sin of lending. Never take anything as collateral that you literally cannot have a liquid market for. Because if the markets blow up, then you're stuck with the collateral, and then you're just taking directional risk and hoping that it goes back off or trying to offload it to a different party that might make a market for you. So that's the situation where I think they found themselves in right when Luna blew up, especially because Three Zeros got liquidated. Whatever, the game's over for them. But at the end of the day, they're just sitting with a bunch of this GBDC collateral, wondering what to do with it, and there's this potential mismatch in their assets and liabilities as well. And so that's when it got, I think, to a point where they realized that they needed to potentially raise money.
00:48:55.334 - 00:49:43.810, Speaker D: And Barry put in, I think it was like a 400 million dollar note into them to kind of recolateralize the company. And now they lost another 175 in their derivatives business in FTX. They lost another, like, ten or something in their lending business. And now The Wall Street Journal is just reporting I don't know if this just came out, but they're trying to raise an emergency loan of $1 billion by Monday. And so you think about the process of, okay, what are you offering and what are they getting in return? Are you selling a chunk of Genesis Equity so that people can put money in, which will then go right back out the door to recolateralize customers and enable? Like, that doesn't seem like a very good business decision if I'm giving you cash to wind the business down. So maybe that's not it. What about GBTC? They have a lot of that on their balance sheet.
00:49:43.810 - 00:50:30.994, Speaker D: Well, they can't exactly sell it. There's no liquid markets. They need to go find somebody who's willing to take it off their hands and wait six months to potentially sell it, because that's the rules of the trust. So this is what happens when you take bad collateral and you're running a lending book and I think if you think about their major counterparties, it was the funds running this GBTC loop that was a very big trade. And then miners what's up with foundation that big miner that they financed and did all that stuff with? Details are starting to emerge of what may or may not be on their balance sheet and who they may be exposed to. I really hope that they find a buyer, but you need to raise collateral very quickly or else you need to the definition of insolvency is not having enough assets to meet your liabilities. Liabilities are very short term customer withdrawals.
00:50:30.994 - 00:50:35.650, Speaker D: If you do not have the assets for that, you either need to recolateralize the business or file for restructuring.
00:50:35.730 - 00:51:03.934, Speaker B: Yeah, the other thing I would say, too, is another connection. There is you can go back this is what we started to sniff around on initially. If you google Genesis Yield Partnership, all these articles will pop up. And another one that they had was Luno. Luno is also it's an exchange. It's in the family of DCG companies. Guess who provides the yield on that? Like and the other thing not looking.
00:51:03.972 - 00:51:05.726, Speaker A: Good for the DCG family right now. Dude.
00:51:05.758 - 00:51:08.094, Speaker B: Tough year for Barry. He also plowed.
00:51:08.142 - 00:51:14.094, Speaker A: I saw also foundry, right? I don't know how foundry is doing, but Bitcoin mining is foundry.
00:51:14.142 - 00:51:15.634, Speaker D: Yeah, that was the miner I was talking about.
00:51:15.672 - 00:51:35.770, Speaker B: He also plowed. I'm pretty sure. I'm not sure if you listed this, fans, but about an aggregate I got to check my numbers here, but I think it's like 750,000,000 in buybacks of GBTC as well. If you remember all those enormous buybacks that Barry announced, dude, it's well over a billion dollars. He's personally injected into these port codes.
00:51:36.190 - 00:51:37.210, Speaker A: That he's.
00:51:39.870 - 00:52:14.310, Speaker D: There is kind of like this interesting strategic question of what you do at this point. Just like, if I'm barry, this is how I think about it. I have two businesses. I have Genesis and I have GBTC. If I want to recolateralize Genesis, I probably make the trust eligible for redemption, which means that I can then have actual BTC, which I can sell and reclateralize Genesis. What that means is that you wind down GBTC. A business that prints cash is on its potential path to an ETF, and they're currently in litigation with the SEC as to whether to make that ETF instantiated, immediately, or whatever.
00:52:14.310 - 00:52:54.660, Speaker D: And so GBTC is probably the bigger of the two potential businesses, certainly the bigger cash cow, and could get to bigger scale. And so I don't see him winding down the GBTC trust. I think it's just kind of like, what do you do with Genesis? And my hope is that a combination of asset sales and selling loans is enough to at least get this to a point where customers can withdraw and then just wind it down. But this is like I wouldn't call it like, a pillar of crypto lending. It's definitely an important capital markets desk, specifically the derivative side. And I don't know if that continues on, but we're just hoping that people get made whole at this point, and we don't want it to be in, like, a year and at $0.75 on the dollar, because that's not a good solution for anybody.
00:52:54.660 - 00:53:24.430, Speaker D: The other thing, lastly, I don't know what happens, but my instinct is what happens if crypto markets drop another 20%? Are you selling client collateral to manage the whole? Are you just leaving everything in whatever it's dominated in and just being like the bankruptcy or restructuring? People can take this and work with it. That's the part that's less clear to me that has more risk, because if you're just indiscriminately selling large amounts of assets, that has an impact.
00:53:26.130 - 00:54:17.854, Speaker B: Yeah, well said. It's been a tough year. A lot of people that looked pretty invincible about a year ago are coming under just an enormous amount of strain and getting blown out. And Barry Silbert was definitely not someone that I thought seemed vulnerable because he had these it's this array because you mentioned the two companies. He's got Genesis and Grayscale, but he's also got CoinDesk, right? He's got his media arm, he's got Foundry, his mining plays, got Luno, his exchange. It looked like this impenetrable array of cash flow generating companies, but honestly, it looked like the weak link in the chain was well, and I guess actually Grayscale as well. But it sounds like there are a couple of reports out.
00:54:17.854 - 00:54:29.940, Speaker B: You can see for yourself. It seems like there's a bidding war going on around Genesis's loan book. It looks like he might end up raising that capital, maybe not at the terms that he would ultimately want.
00:54:31.190 - 00:54:33.220, Speaker A: Who do you think ends up buying them?
00:54:33.590 - 00:54:40.098, Speaker D: Michael and I were just talking about everyone who was big enough is now either dead or smaller or doesn't want.
00:54:40.104 - 00:54:41.854, Speaker A: To play in the US regulation space.
00:54:41.912 - 00:54:44.066, Speaker B: Or can't play in the US regulation.
00:54:44.178 - 00:55:07.146, Speaker D: Like, CZ is not buying Genesis. I also doubt that CZ is buying Voyager. Just feels like the regulatory stuff is just too complex. But I think we're looking at, like, a TradFi rescue package, unfortunately, because if we bail each other out, that's one thing. If people get liquidated, that's another. But if we're asking for help from TradFi, that just looks super embarrassing, in my opinion.
00:55:07.338 - 00:55:38.966, Speaker C: I mean, this is centralized. I think if you're backstopping if you're backstopping a bunch of loans with, like a JP. Morgan Credit Suisse type program, maybe not CS, actually, but if you're backstopping it there, I think that that actually lends credibility. I don't think it necessarily is a stain. And frankly, what they're going to look at is just like, this is a loan book. I'm buying it at $0.85 on the dollar, expecting that I'll be able to recruit half the loans or three quarters of the loans, whatever the math ends up being, they will.
00:55:38.966 - 00:55:49.020, Speaker C: Get a pretty solid return on this and I think that's how anybody would evaluate it. Maybe it's also just like hedge funds that want to step in and help. So it'll be interesting to see. I mean, Monday is coming up rapidly, quickly.
00:55:50.350 - 00:56:01.838, Speaker B: Yeah. What do you guys think, just in general? The one angle that we haven't really touched on is policy. The policy implications of all the especially.
00:56:01.924 - 00:56:10.820, Speaker A: Wait, can I ask one more question just based on the Genesis thing? What happens if they don't get a deal done by Monday? Who else is impacted here?
00:56:14.710 - 00:56:56.754, Speaker D: Definition of insolvency is not enough assets to meet your liabilities. If that is the case, I think you are compelled to file for some sort of restructuring in terms of what happens from there. If you're lending out bitcoin on Genesis and you don't have access to it anymore, you need to either recreate that position or recreate a hedge or recreate whatever you have going on. But my sense is that once people had their shit locked up, it was kind of like they did whatever they needed to do within the first 24 hours. That's certainly our plan, if that ever happens to us, is figured out quickly. I doubt people are waiting around to see if they just open up withdrawals because I don't think that's on the table at this point.
00:56:56.792 - 00:57:31.538, Speaker B: I mean, actually I can maybe share. First of all, I want to shout out blockchain association. They occasionally get shouted out on Twitter, Coincenter blockchain association. These guys are literally putting the entire industry on their backs in a place where it matters an enormous amount, where look, I don't necessarily want to it's not always the most rewarding thing to be kind of in the thick of it politically, but someone has to represent the interests of crypto, and those guys do a really good job. So actually we host a bunch of events. I went down to their event this week. It was one of the best events I've ever attended.
00:57:31.538 - 00:58:18.250, Speaker B: It was phenomenal. Like really solid content, great array of people speaking, well organized. The mood on the ground was kind of more optimistic than I would have thought. And there are a couple of different perspectives. Obviously there's some short term fallout that's going to happen here and there's some questioning just in terms I mean, some of the, I think, public policymakers that align themselves as being pro crypto, it's anyone's guess, right, if they end up changing their mind or not. But largely the Dccpa bill was kind of seen as Sam's bill. So odly enough, him blowing up and being kind of toxic and untouchable in Washington might have actually helped preclude that bill from getting passed.
00:58:18.250 - 00:58:38.930, Speaker B: I would keep in mind the brain of a five year old. I'm not an expert on plug. These are just what I picked up basically from the discussions. So I don't think we're out of the woods yet. But basically the midterms didn't actually shake out horribly. From a crypto perspective, it doesn't look like Pccpa is going to get passed. There are alternative bills that are more friendly to the industry.
00:58:38.930 - 00:58:43.380, Speaker B: It wasn't all doom and gloom is what I'll definitely say.
00:58:44.550 - 00:59:22.430, Speaker D: I believe that too. I think that we are in a much more positive place than we were a month ago from a regulatory standpoint, which seems bizarre, but it is the case. There's a lot of externalities from Sam blowing up, one of which being everyone's going to be super on the nose about who's putting what legislation into what and why. What are the differences between CFI and DeFi? Everyone knows now that CFI is the one that runs away with your like there's a lot of positive things coming out of this. I just think it's going to take the new Congress just a little time to get its arms wrapped around it. At some point we're going to get legislation, and I think it's tending in a more positive potential way.
00:59:22.500 - 00:59:26.510, Speaker C: I would also say that that's going to happen in 2023 with like 75, 80.
00:59:28.470 - 00:59:37.470, Speaker D: Side note, we should do a little predictions episode at some point for 2023. That'd be a good idea. We think you got to bring the.
00:59:37.480 - 00:59:39.682, Speaker B: Tinfoil hat because I want some outlandish predictions.
00:59:39.746 - 00:59:40.440, Speaker A: All right.
00:59:41.290 - 00:59:44.998, Speaker D: I didn't have enough time to make an antenna, but I'll have it for.
00:59:45.004 - 00:59:45.720, Speaker A: The next.
00:59:48.090 - 01:00:25.490, Speaker B: Maybe even I would love to get your guys. Thought I've started to see a couple. Chris Berninski, who I love. Great guy. He started to call out what I've kind of also started to maybe quietly, semi optimistically start to think, which is this is like record negative sentiment, right? I mean, even if you've been in crypto for a while, the way people are talking, it's like pretty glum and bad out there. But prices have not reacted, frankly, horrendously. And when you start to see sentiment not line up with price action, you're kind of like, are we nearing a boss?
01:00:25.990 - 01:01:25.570, Speaker C: Okay, so ask yourself a question. Take your understanding of price over the last nine months and just run the tape of everything that's happened in 2022 and ask yourself, with intellectual honesty, where do you predict Bitcoin and ETH would be right now, having seen Luna, Three Arrows, Celsius and now FTX Sam Alameda blow up? I mean, I would have said with pretty high likelihood, probably underneath $300 for ETH and probably like underneath ten K for Bitcoin. No questions asked, right. The strength of the industry and seeing where the market is right now, I think, Mike, to your point, it is a testament to the things that are working and the things that are not working are getting figured out and blown up. But the things that are working, I think, are going to be so much stronger for it. And I kind of tend to agree with Chris. I mean, it feels sentiment is so bad that usually that means that we're starting to get to a point of turnaround.
01:01:25.730 - 01:01:28.358, Speaker A: What do you think, ETH bottoms at the cycle?
01:01:28.534 - 01:02:00.574, Speaker B: Let me do the compliance folks at Framework a favor here. Financial advice. None of this should be investment advice either. I don't even know if you guys can touch that with it with the ten foot predictions. I don't know. I'm not all so small. I'm just going to sound like we're feeling positive.
01:02:00.622 - 01:02:02.430, Speaker D: We're feeling positive. We're feeling positive.
01:02:02.510 - 01:02:04.260, Speaker B: Yeah, I think so too.
01:02:05.430 - 01:02:11.270, Speaker D: I just read a Jason Choi thread that said we're going to be in a ten year bear market. I think that's absurd.
01:02:11.930 - 01:02:13.666, Speaker B: I don't know if you guys honestly.
01:02:13.698 - 01:02:16.600, Speaker D: Think it's engagement farming, love Jason, but.
01:02:17.130 - 01:02:41.360, Speaker B: I see what you're doing. This got lost amid the noise of everything. Citron research shorted ETH I don't know if you guys saw that, and I kind of love seeing that. I was like, all right, it's all these things. People are talking about depressions in the macro world. People are talking about ten year bear markets. All the big short sellers are going short when it's already 90% down.
01:02:41.360 - 01:03:13.254, Speaker B: Could keep getting worse, might be like this for a year. Yeah. Well, let me phrase the question another way. Markets are based on expectation, right? They're not based on necessarily what's happening, what could happen that would blow all of this news out of the water? What is the bad news left outside that would really surprise to the downside? Or let me put it phrase it another way. Is the market more sensitive to downside surprises or upside surprises at this stage?
01:03:13.302 - 01:03:43.438, Speaker D: Upside. And the market is driven by two things. One is expectations, forward looking but current. It's also influenced by the current, which is positioning. What do people expect to happen? Great Depression? How are people positioned extremely short or not in crypto or lost interest. And so anything that moves that dial is going to be really positive and the expectations changing will change positioning in the current day. And I don't know, the time to bearish was a year ago.
01:03:43.438 - 01:03:58.966, Speaker D: If you were bearish a year ago, nobody wanted to talk to you. Everyone thought you were dumb. Turned out you were brilliant. Everyone wants to bearish at the bottom, super bullish at the top. That's just like human psychology in nature. You need to lean against the wind at some point or else you're just going to be running with the herd the entire time, which is generally not.
01:03:58.988 - 01:04:00.002, Speaker A: That good of a strategy.
01:04:00.066 - 01:04:03.740, Speaker B: Funny to hear you say such wise things with that tinfoil hat on your head.
01:04:05.310 - 01:04:07.706, Speaker A: That's how he's able to say such wise things.
01:04:07.808 - 01:04:10.394, Speaker B: Yeah, the radio waves aren't getting in there.
01:04:10.592 - 01:04:12.700, Speaker A: He's not getting hit by the yeah, exactly.
01:04:13.470 - 01:05:00.822, Speaker B: Can we actually just do we talked about this for a little bit, but if there's one thing that I hope we can influence, can we just put out look, there are certain people in this space that got blown. Out before SBF, and they're trying to mount a comeback because it seems like the logic is, oh, yeah, we did criminal stuff and defrauded people, but it was way less than ultimately this enormous, criminal, fraudulent activity. So was it really that bad? Give us a second shot. And look, we're not going to progress as an industry if we keep looking up to these people. I just really don't think that look, there's a redemption arc as a human for these people. I don't believe you should punish someone and there's no redemption. But not in this industry.
01:05:00.822 - 01:05:04.250, Speaker B: Not with our just I reject it.
01:05:04.320 - 01:05:08.190, Speaker C: This is my martin Stralli isn't back in the pharmaceuticals business anymore.
01:05:08.530 - 01:05:09.280, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:05:11.170 - 01:05:12.640, Speaker A: He'S just on up only.
01:05:16.290 - 01:05:52.282, Speaker D: Yeah, come on, guys. So I totally agree with you. People who have defrauded others, who have done things that are shitty, like, we should not let back into the industry. I also don't comment or retweet or like that stuff out of respect for and there are victims and people in my DMs who they stole from. Like, I'm thinking about logging off from Twitter for my mental health because I just can't stand to see them go through this potential redemption arc. That's who I'm trying to keep in mind when I see, like, tweeting kind of funny stuff, and I'm like, I just can't do it. And so there's that.
01:05:52.282 - 01:06:10.020, Speaker D: We should not let those people kind of back in. There is also, like, a power ranking of villains from this season. SBF is number one. I think I would probably put Three arrows and Luna tide for number two. But there is a gap. There's a million creditors to FTX. They stole $10 billion.
01:06:10.020 - 01:06:22.040, Speaker D: That's a very serious problem. I don't know what the exact Three Arrows, delta, or Hole is, but Sam is the worst. That's basically my point.
01:06:22.570 - 01:06:38.710, Speaker B: I thought that was really well said. Yeah. There are people that lost life savings, man. They lost life savings. They lost four years of work and grinding and profits. And I don't know, people in this industry work super hard. A lot of people work weekends and took big risks.
01:06:38.710 - 01:07:16.614, Speaker B: And to have all that jacked from you, not even necessarily a lot of people that got hit hardest, is if you had an investment strategy which required you to have capital stored on multiple exchanges and maybe you just kind of didn't like it. But a lot of the systematic trading guys, the market neutral, they got smoked. And it wasn't even necessarily a huge fault of theirs. It was just like they had to do that for their particular strategy. So I think that's the thing to keep in mind, right? As an exercise, I went back and listened to some early I don't mean to pick. I actually love up only as a show. Like, I'm huge fan of it.
01:07:16.614 - 01:07:42.560, Speaker B: But I did go back and listen to some up only podcasts from the beginning of 2021. Everyone should do that. Not even necessarily up only, just like some crypto podcasts. Listen to what people were saying in 2021. Take a mental note of how differently you think about it now versus how differently you were thinking about it when that was going on. And just remember that because it was helpful for me to be like, wow, I was listening to this and taking it seriously at the time.
01:07:45.110 - 01:07:46.750, Speaker D: You just have to prefer wealth.
01:07:46.830 - 01:07:48.562, Speaker B: Remember that a reasonably sized house.
01:07:48.616 - 01:07:52.670, Speaker D: You could just acquire wealth. Yeah, reasonably.
01:07:52.830 - 01:07:54.980, Speaker B: One reasonably sized house. Yeah.
01:07:55.370 - 01:07:57.622, Speaker C: It's just a couple of liquidations and then it's up only.
01:07:57.676 - 01:07:58.326, Speaker B: Up only.
01:07:58.428 - 01:08:00.834, Speaker A: Yeah. The super cycle.
01:08:00.962 - 01:08:37.230, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you guys have a quick sentiment check on just what's going on outside of Crypto and Web Two? I have a couple of friends at I have one friend who spoke to me who works at, let's call it, a very large, very successful kind of Web Two platform. And she was like, it is all hands on deck. First of all, there was a big riff that hasn't necessarily been announced yet. Everyone was told they have to be in an office within three days. They had to do pitches in front of, at most 100 people. They got live critiqued.
01:08:37.230 - 01:08:55.814, Speaker B: They were like, we have quiet quitters. This is not happening anymore. I was like, since we've talked about this last, I think an Amazon announced they were letting 10,000 people go. Everyone's missing their earnings. Can you guys give us like an update on Web Two land and what's going on over there or what's up?
01:08:55.932 - 01:09:41.542, Speaker C: Yeah. You think it's bleak for Crypto? Oh, man, it's bleak for them. It's pretty brutal right now. I think most of the people that I know across Dropbox and Snap, the ones that the places that I worked, but then also just a ton of friends who have moved on to other large technology platforms. As you said, not only is it just going to be a difficult place to work for the next couple of years, I think the biggest thing is everybody's gotten so used to the cushy lifestyle that you rip that away and it's like you literally took away all their toys. And it's that about face and Change that most people are still trying to deal with. I have a couple of friends who are like, this is great.
01:09:41.542 - 01:10:09.614, Speaker C: This is awesome. This is what we need to have. And so I think that tried and true are going to actually really enjoy it. But there's just so many people who have been riding high and underneath the radar that it's just not going to be pleasant for a lot of people. But I think ultimately this is a good thing. The other interesting fact, I don't know which podcast, but I was listening to a podcast recently about how all the tech layoffs. It's really going to affect the economy? No.
01:10:09.614 - 01:10:47.500, Speaker C: There's a Fed Board Observer, or whoever they are, who said if every single person who works at a major Internet publishing content, broadcast or search engine was to get laid off tomorrow, every single one of them, 100% riff. It would affect unemployment rate by adding 30 basis points to the unemployment. This is like a microcosm of the economy from an economic perspective, from an employment perspective, but obviously a huge revenue generator for the rest of the economy. So I think this is going to be a great, interesting experiment. And how lean can you run these businesses? How profitable can they get?
01:10:48.350 - 01:11:21.558, Speaker D: The vibe that I get is consistent with Michael, but it's like there are no tailwinds for these businesses that they haven't already capitalized on. We are riding the biggest tailwind in crypto into the biggest market, and we haven't even begun to capture that. And so we have this idea of like, yeah, we fucked up in 2021. Sorry we had to liquidate everyone in 2022, but we paid for our sins. We're going to the moon eventually. There is a lot of faith, there's a lot of reason, there's a lot of optimism in the industry for good, rationale web two. It's like the products are the products.
01:11:21.558 - 01:11:40.938, Speaker D: We've probably hit our terminal growth rate. Netflix has been stuck at like 100 million US customers. It's gone down over the past three years. There's not like the teleportation into a new total addressable market that's going to save them. And so, yeah, it's more of like a management business now of how lean can you run them to my and.
01:11:40.944 - 01:12:39.018, Speaker C: So just to double click into that point, there's actually two really important components. Number one is this is what happens with all major industries throughout capitalism. You get to a point where you grow to sort of your max capacity and then you ultimately end up having to provide operational efficiency to continue to scale because you need to get highly profitable. That growth into deep value is a natural progression. The other element here, which I think is really important, which will be really interesting to see the growth of all of these tech platforms, if you look at every single one of them, maybe absent Apple, every single one of well, you could argue Netflix, but that's a different type of acquisition strategy. Every single one of these businesses, every single one of these platforms has grown through acquisition strategy over the last 20 years. You've got YouTube, you've got Instagram, you've got all of the major new platforms that are providing these businesses with growth were not things that were created inside the four walls.
01:12:39.018 - 01:13:22.430, Speaker C: Well, what has been signaled, at least to the broader economy, is that acquisition strategy is not going to be something that is going to be supported by regulators going forward. And so that off the table really, actually hurts them even more. Because it's not like you can just go and say, oh, I'm going to go off and buy this new app, buy this new concept, buy this new thing. You really have to sit there and build it yourselves. And that, I think, is going to be really hard for a bunch of complacent tech workers that have been riding high for the last 20 years. And I don't think they're going to be able to do the hard work to be able to get there. And so I think the only thing that you can possibly do from a corporate strategy perspective at this point is operational excellence to get to profit ability and then cash flow businesses.
01:13:23.090 - 01:14:08.134, Speaker B: I think it's very interesting to see as an experiment what's going to happen. Elon just fired half of Twitter, so let's see what mean. You know, on the one hand, maybe it'll crash and burn and it's a lot more difficult than he thought. Or maybe this thing just starts spewing cash because there was an enormous amount of wasted human capital that they didn't really need on the platform. And honestly, maybe the one thing that I would tweak and actually I'm agreeing with you, Vance, on your point. There's no new market they can teleport into, but maybe that industry has just reached the next phase of its cycle from growth into harvesting the assets that they've built. There are a lot of great assets in the tech industry, and now it's time for them to just start spitting off cash flow.
01:14:08.134 - 01:14:32.100, Speaker B: And maybe some of those things end up getting more commoditized, but I don't think it necessarily means their share price has to get smoked. I mean, I think they're just progression. Yeah, it's just the natural progression, I think. All right, guys, I think that's about all the time we have. I think we did this justice. Yeah, this was a good one. I appreciated it.
01:14:33.030 - 01:14:36.414, Speaker A: Vance, can I get a zoom in on the tinfoil?
01:14:36.542 - 01:14:37.220, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:14:39.590 - 01:14:40.194, Speaker D: No.
01:14:40.312 - 01:14:41.862, Speaker B: Impressive tinfoil cap.
01:14:41.916 - 01:14:42.374, Speaker D: No.
01:14:42.492 - 01:14:44.630, Speaker B: Yeah, like pretty well constructed.
01:14:46.250 - 01:14:54.150, Speaker D: Yeah, my girlfriend helped me out. No big deal. Just trying to stay safe.
01:14:54.890 - 01:15:00.750, Speaker B: Fly on the wall for that. Like, babe, I need a tinfoil hat for my podcast that I'm recording. Delusion.
01:15:02.530 - 01:15:04.560, Speaker D: You'Re just like, oh, God.
01:15:07.490 - 01:15:12.540, Speaker B: All right, fellas, this was a fun one. We'll see you here next week. Cheers, guys. Later.
