00:00:00.250 - 00:00:47.020, Speaker A: The average company in the Russell 2000 has roughly 30% of its capital structure in debt and the other like two thirds or 70% in equity. So effectively they finance their business with $1 of debt for every $2 of equity. And so I think in crypto we effectively have market cap of a little less than a trillion. That's completely unlevered. It's a one dimensional capital structure if you think about governance tokens as equity. And so it's almost as if crypto markets have not used every tool in their toolkit to optimize their cost of capital to date.
00:00:50.130 - 00:00:54.986, Speaker B: Bang bang bang bang. What are we talking to today, dude?
00:00:55.018 - 00:01:34.646, Speaker C: I mean we should be talking to pump with that intro. I haven't heard anyone say bang bang. Anyway, today we are talking to also a longtime friend of Blockworks, Ben Foreman. Ben is great. Like ex TradFi came from TPG, was at TPG on the credit desk I think then was at KKR. KKR, I think TPG, then KKR on the credit desk and then left KKR in 2000 and maybe 18 or 2019 founded ParaFi. The founder of KKR kind of seeded the fund, Henry Kravis and he's just had an incredibly impressive run and they've built like one of the best firms in crypto.
00:01:34.646 - 00:01:50.202, Speaker C: And this episode was great. I think it tied together everything that we've been talking about like permission DeFi, the potential there fixed rate lend and borrow under collateralized loans like we talked about it all. So I thought this was one of my favorite episodes of the season.
00:01:50.266 - 00:02:34.118, Speaker B: I thought it was cool to maybe even just be if you're tuning in for the first time listening to this episode, this is where we are kind of in the season, right, is we mapped out the death of Know New Renaissance to Shah Jain over at of. We connected this thesis of okay, a renewed interest in DeFi maybe detonated markets on DeFi with a boom instead of innovations in token distribution. So not only do we get a renewed interest in DeFi, but that could actually lead to a big boom. Then we talked about specifically the fixed rate unlock. Right now we only have variable yields in crypto. Then we talked about what the unlock might be in terms of actually getting fixed rates. We just did an episode on options, right? Options and how they lock in those fixed rates.
00:02:34.118 - 00:03:02.374, Speaker B: And then we also talked about structured products and uncollateralized lending. So where we are in this current season here is basically like the next question that we have to ask with Ben and we got so much more than we even bargained for was basically who are going to be the issuers of this fixed rate debt? So we got into that question with him and then we kind of led in this very interesting direction of KYC Fi and permission DeFi on this episode as well. So that's kind of where we are in the season. And yeah, we got even more bang for our buck than we bargained for.
00:03:02.412 - 00:03:02.614, Speaker C: Wow.
00:03:02.652 - 00:03:06.514, Speaker B: Do you like that? Alliteration bang bargain for in this episode.
00:03:06.562 - 00:03:10.806, Speaker C: Bang for the buck, then we bargained for. Nice work. Nice work. Yeah.
00:03:10.988 - 00:03:12.874, Speaker B: Let's jump in. See you on the other side.
00:03:12.912 - 00:03:24.586, Speaker C: Let's jump in. See you on the other side, folks. All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. We have longtime friend of blockworks, Ben Foreman. I'm joined by Mike Ipolito, per usual. Ben. Welcome to Bell Curve.
00:03:24.698 - 00:03:25.360, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:03:25.890 - 00:04:02.300, Speaker C: Excited to have you here, Ben. I want to actually start we're going to dive really deep into who are the borrowers. We've been talking all season of Bell Curve about under collateralized lending, fixed rate lend and borrow and kind of what the next area of DeFi could look like. I actually want to start in traditional capital markets, though, because you have this credit background coming from KKR and from TPG. What are some of the learnings that you've learned from the traditional credit markets that maybe that you see in DeFi you're like, oh, this clearly is going to exist, but it doesn't exist yet. I'm just curious to see to get your take on how you see credit in capital markets versus credit in DeFi right now.
00:04:02.670 - 00:04:56.282, Speaker A: So I think there are a few big things that are missing. One is term debt and longer maturity debt. So most borrowing in DeFi is perpetual borrowing. So rates change block by block and that doesn't allow you to really lock in a liability for a long period of time, which is a big issue. Most companies in the world, if they're investing in a project, like they're building a bridge, they're building a factory, they're building a school that may take years to build and years to generate cash flow to pay them back. And so you need long term liabilities to plan. And just as context, like global fixed income markets are roughly $125,000,000,000,000 and about 80% of that have maturities of longer than a year.
00:04:56.282 - 00:05:08.560, Speaker A: So certainly we need longer durations in DFI than we have today. And then we also need term debt. So that's one major area among many others.
00:05:09.730 - 00:05:27.350, Speaker B: So walk us through exactly why that is. Right, because again, something that we've touched on in previous episodes is this need to be able to lock certain things. And we've got all variable debt in crypto right now options and kind of the market for interest rate swaps is how you lock in fixed rates. Why is a term structure really important to that longer term?
00:05:28.970 - 00:06:44.590, Speaker A: Well, I think that fundamentally people want certainty, right? Like locking in a rate for three months is three months is a long time in crypto land. But to the extent we want to actually connect to the real world, we need to be able to not have to rely on refinancing our debt after three months. Because if you borrow for three months when things are good and that debt comes to maturity, you may not be able to refinance and that could ultimately cause you to be insolvent. And we actually, I mean, just recently, a few months ago, this was top of mind when you had kind of three arrows causing contagion across crypto credit markets. If you had an open term loan with a desk like Genesis or Galaxy or any of the other big lenders, they were saying, hey, please return our capital. But if you had a fixed term debt where they couldn't call it back, you could rest assured that you could buy time to effectively repay your debt. And so really, that's why it's so important.
00:06:44.590 - 00:07:14.150, Speaker A: That's why the US. Government issues ten year bonds, 30 year bonds. It's why most high yield issuers are issuing five to ten year bonds. Most municipalities are issuing ten year plus notes. Same in the mortgage market. The most common duration on a mortgage is 30 years. And most of the fixed rate attempts in DFI are still too short.
00:07:14.150 - 00:07:25.130, Speaker A: They're still, okay, let's lock in a rate for one month, three months, six months. But that's still far too disconnected from the duration that you see in traditional credit markets.
00:07:25.710 - 00:07:36.622, Speaker B: So why is that? Why do we have such short durations in crypto? As opposed to if there is an equivalent of the Toyota Camry, right? It's the 30 year fixed rate mortgage in the US.
00:07:36.676 - 00:07:37.086, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:37.188 - 00:07:42.640, Speaker B: That's a super popular financial product. Everything in crypto is such short duration. Why is that?
00:07:43.970 - 00:08:49.234, Speaker A: I think it's partly a function of just this market being very immature. I mean, if you think about it, the the demand to borrow at long rates maybe hasn't really become relevant until recently. Part of the reason for that is there was really no demand to borrow long term previously. Because why issue debt when you could just sell equity or sell tokens, right? Like any company, every company is trying to optimize its capital structure and keep its cost of capital as low as possible. And it's no different for a Dow. And so when equity prices are high, sell equity because it's cheap. But in today's market, with token prices depressed, if to the extent a company or a Dow believes in the equity value or the value of their governance token, they wouldn't want to sell it at today's prices.
00:08:49.234 - 00:09:32.030, Speaker A: And now they'll kind of turn to credit as an alternative. I think the other issue were rates in DeFi. So you go back a year ago and the risk free rate on Compound or Ave was high single digits, low double digits. Today it's significantly lower. But when rates were high single digits, low double digits. To get someone to lock up capital for five years or ten years, the slope of that interest rate curve was going to be very steep. And so it didn't really make sense until this market environment.
00:09:32.030 - 00:09:39.430, Speaker A: And so that's why I think we really haven't had a need for it or there wasn't demand for it until this recent sell off occurred.
00:09:40.410 - 00:10:33.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I really like that framework of just there wasn't a demand to borrow. Right? Like you basically had the main use case for taking out for borrowing in crypto thus far has been really short term is a very Dgen type product market fit right where you're basically leveraging either you want to earn some short term yield or you wanted to go long something while maintaining price exposure to the underlying asset. But you didn't have the way a company might think about you were kind of just getting into this idea of capital structure, right? Which is, I want to borrow at the cheapest cost of capital possible. And that's how sovereigns tend to think. That's how corporates tend to think. So maybe we could kind of get into that use case but I actually love you to maybe pull on your KKR background and just give us a little bit of a lesson of capital structure right. When people use this phrase like capital structure walk us through what that means and then kind of talk us through the two different forms of financing which are debt and equity financing.
00:10:34.330 - 00:12:16.482, Speaker A: So everything in the world requires capital to build whether it's a company, a piece of infrastructure or a protocol or a Dow they all require money. And the game of finance is optimizing your cost of capital at the lowest level where you're not over levered but you're paying the lowest amount possible because why pay more for financial capital than you need to? It sounds obvious. So as it relates to companies, companies will raise some combination of equity, convertible notes, preferred equity and debt to do whatever they need to do to grow their business. And within debt there are a number of different types of debt. There's secured debt, there's unsecured debt, there's senior debt, there's mezzanine debt and all of these different stakeholders in a business have a different priority in that company's capital structure and have claims on different parts of the business. And so this is really how the traditional financial market works. And just as context there's roughly the same amount of publicly issued debt in the world as publicly issued equity and the average company in the Russell 2000 has roughly 30% of its capital structure in debt and the other like two thirds or 70% in equity.
00:12:16.482 - 00:12:50.260, Speaker A: So effectively they finance their business with one dollars of debt for every $2 of equity. And so I think in crypto we effectively have a market cap of a little less than a trillion that's completely unlevered. It's a one dimensional capital structure if you think about governance tokens as equity and so it's almost as if crypto markets have not used every tool in their toolkit to optimize their cost of capital to date.
00:12:51.750 - 00:13:15.622, Speaker C: Ben when you look at I feel like a lot of folks think of debt as something that maybe a big Fortune 500 would issue and that startups maybe don't use debt as much. But I actually feel like startups like nondilutive debt financing is becoming more and more popular even in the startup markets these days. Why has that not hit crypto yet? Why do we have that relationship? Basically? What is missing?
00:13:15.766 - 00:14:00.010, Speaker A: I guess yeah, I think that most DeFi DeFi was two years old. Most Dows have started in the last year and there's really no reason to issue debt because token prices were expensive. So sell tokens and debt would have been expensive because DeFi yields were high. But now DeFi yields are very low. So I think that was one concept. I think the second is there really haven't been that many teams building products in this category. So there may be a small handful of teams that are just now coming to market with products that allow Dows to issue debt like instruments.
00:14:00.010 - 00:15:03.390, Speaker A: But I count 65 to 70 teams building decentralized perps or decentralized options and 50 plus teams building money market style competitors to aven compound and a similar amount building AMMS. But very few have focused on this particular category to. So I think it's a bit of a late mover. And then I think the final point is we can get into this more. But I think that what debt looks like to a Dow may be different than what debt looks like to a company. And I think to some extent, lenders may want to look to protocol earnings as a source of repayment, almost like a royalty, right, as opposed to just a direct loan that's repaid at maturity. So I think there are some design characteristics that need to be sussed out before we really get to product market fit.
00:15:03.540 - 00:15:07.440, Speaker B: Could we go a little bit deeper? Explain what exactly you mean by that?
00:15:09.170 - 00:16:28.410, Speaker A: Yeah, so I just think about a typical high yield bond that, let's say, or an investment grade bond that Tesla issues. They may issue a five year bond at 3% coupon and every year they make an interest payment to lenders. And then at the very end of that five year period in 2027, they repay the principal. And those bondholders basically have a generic lien or claim on the assets of the business. And the CFO of Tesla is stroking the checks every year, assuming it's an annual coupon. I think in the DeFi space, what we may end up seeing is something that looks more like a royalty, right, where if you think about a Dow, that's cash flow generative like Uniswap generating $500,000 of daily earnings, or actually maybe Uniswap is a bad example because the fee switches off. But let's say Sushi, I imagine an instrument where, let's say X Sushi is generating $50,000 a day of earnings.
00:16:28.410 - 00:17:06.210, Speaker A: If I were to lend, say, a million dollars to Sushi Dow and be guaranteed block by block that I'm getting repayment along with an interest rate as cash is coming into the Dow? That would be more palatable for me because I wouldn't have to take risk that a Dow has to go through a governance vote to make an interest payment or to refinance debt at maturity. And so I think for that reason things may look a little bit different than just trusting that a Dow will make interest payments.
00:17:07.190 - 00:18:01.670, Speaker B: Does that give it a different that's really interesting that you say this, because on one of the previous interviews in the CSOM, we talked to the guys from Maple Finance and Notional Finance, and Teddy from Notional brought up this idea know one thing that's very possible in crypto that's just straight up not possible in TradFi is this idea know money going towards certain things. Right. You can lock in on a block by block basis mean we were actually even talking about it within the context of, okay, let's say you issue a loan to a company like blockworks is going to take on a loan. We'd say, hey, we're going to use it for additional personnel. We're going to use it to fund this conference, and maybe we need some marketing or something like that. Basically when you give us that money you're trusting Jason and I to do that. Whereas right now you can actually remove a dimension of that risk and say hey, these dollars can only go towards thing X, Y and Z.
00:18:01.670 - 00:18:16.860, Speaker B: And then this is another way to feel even safer as a borrower, right, where at the end of the loan I don't need to worry about repaying the principal. Even if things are going well in the business I can actually see those payments start to flow in on a more regular basis. Which is just really interesting, I think.
00:18:17.950 - 00:18:58.950, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I mean I also think you can structure products that resemble revenue shares. So when Blockworks is selling tickets to its next conference you could structure some sort of note where thirty cents of every dollar goes to repay my revenue share until I make 1.5 times my money. So I think the design space for what you can do with crypto structured products is obviously much wider, much broader than what you could do easily in TradFi and I think that's actually pretty exciting.
00:19:00.330 - 00:19:22.426, Speaker C: Yeah. Which gets into the second part of the programmable loan, which is like not only can you program into the smart contract that you would basically be using protocol revenues to spit off and pay back the loan, but you can program it on the other side so that, hey, I'm taking out a loan and I'm only using it to spend on these things. Right. So it's like both sides of the loan are programmable. Right. It's really interesting.
00:19:22.548 - 00:20:24.082, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I mean the other interesting feature set that I don't think has been talked about a lot are loan covenants. So most loans have reporting covenants by a company. So if their revenue or their EBITDA drops below a certain level the loan is in default. And so we could see features where these loans reference on chain data, whether it's TVL or volume or protocol earnings and to the extent that certain metrics aren't hit, the loan would be in default and would accelerate in some way. So I think there are other the programmability kind of comes into top of mind here. Relative to traditional finance, everything is reported via paper and financial statements on a 45 day lag to quarter end.
00:20:24.082 - 00:20:30.210, Speaker A: Whereas here you basically get real time monitoring and loan covenants which should reduce risk.
00:20:30.290 - 00:21:29.800, Speaker B: At the end of the day, I'm actually imagining the playground that that opens up to just the arbitrage and the crazy strategies that are going to get run if this becomes widely adopted. One of my know, Matt Levine breaks this down like very normal language, right. But there was a whole trend a little while ago basically of hedge funds using credit default swaps, right? Basically to say hey wink wink nudge nudge, we want you to actually go into breach on this covenant because we have the other side of a credit default swap and we'll basically kick back to you whatever we get from the insurance of the credit default swap. And actually you could make sort of an argument that worked out well for everyone because the financing was actually cheaper for the company that got like they would get more from their kickback from the hedge fund than they would have from whatever sort of debt agreement they had in place before. But the level of I'm just interested to see if we do open up this design space in DeFi just how creative this stuff really can get because it'll be nuts, I think.
00:21:30.890 - 00:21:53.730, Speaker C: Let me ask so Ben, do you think that there will be like a protocol that is built that does not exist yet, that basically is like a loan covenant protocol and you can put in place it helps you facilitate these loans. And some covenants that might exist would be like the debt yield ratio or the DSCR or LTV. Or the LTC. Like just different covenants. And it's all just programmable and it goes through this protocol.
00:21:54.070 - 00:22:34.510, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I think that we'll have some covenant light debt and we'll have some debt that has covenants and I imagine we may be living in a world where we're talking about the relative value between the 2032 uniswap 10% bonds or the compound 2028 converts and 1 may have covenants and 1 may not. And so I think that there'll be traditional credit analysis as we see different types of products come with different types of covenants and different types of structural protections.
00:22:35.090 - 00:22:59.138, Speaker C: Yeah. Ben, can we just storytell for a second because you guys actually underwrote one of the first Dow issued debt things with who was it? Rivendow via Porter Finance. And I think it was your credit fund that underwrote that on chain convertible note. Can you just tell us some I don't know if that was the first one that ever happened, but can you just tell us some learnings and maybe the definitely.
00:22:59.224 - 00:24:12.906, Speaker A: So to our knowledge it's the first one that's ever happened and I think it is somewhat of a window into the future. So as context, Ribbondao Decentralized Options Protocol had a desire to borrow money and in their treasury they only had the RBN tokens which were not eligible collateral on Ave or compound. And so they used Porter Finance, which this decentralized bond issuance protocol to do that. And so effectively what the deal was is they put $15 million of RBN tokens into a contract as collateral and they borrowed $3 million of stablecoins against it. And the rate that the stablecoins got paid via this bond was set via an auction. So there were a number of participants bidding and it was structured as a Dutch auction. Ultimately the way this bond was structured is it was a six month bond and it was issued at $0.97.
00:24:12.906 - 00:24:59.814, Speaker A: It was a zero coupon bond. So you effectively make three points over six months. So roughly six to 7% as you include compounding and you had a claim on this RBN collateral. And one of the interesting things here, and actually this touches on an issue for Dows when it comes to borrowing is they don't want to wake up overnight and find out that they got liquidated. So what was interesting about this Ribbon Dow bond is there were no liquidation. So let's say the 15 million of collateral ends up becoming $2 million like it goes down 85%. Well, you have a $3 million bond and you have 2 million of collateral.
00:24:59.814 - 00:25:50.090, Speaker A: That bond may start to trade at 60 $0.70 on the dollar at an implied recovery value but there were no liquidations associated with that bond. So I think that's actually quite a good user experience for Dows to not have to worry about getting liquidated and be able to use a bespoke collateral type that's not available on compound and Aave. So anyway, this bond was fully subscribed, we did participate and what was interesting is ultimately Porter Finance ended up shutting down and Ribbon repaid its debt a bit earlier than planned. But the mechanics around the bond issuance was fascinating. It actually worked really well and think it was quite practical for all parties.
00:25:50.530 - 00:25:54.880, Speaker B: You said it might be a glimpse into the future. Why do you think that?
00:25:56.930 - 00:26:44.640, Speaker A: I think that other Dows are in similar position to Ribbon. They have governance tokens in their treasury that they can't easily borrow against, they can't sign a contract with an OTC desk because they have no manifestation in the real world. Dows entering into contracts is not straightforward and so they're really forced on chain to borrow and a product similar to what Porter used I think was quite effective. I mean, they were happy with it. I think the participants in the round were happy with it. So I imagine other kind of small and mid cap DAOs will have the same desire and need down the line.
00:26:46.130 - 00:28:15.158, Speaker B: I remember thinking because one of the I think the risks that we're exploring in this thesis that we're talking about this season is just like when this actually is going to a lot of these ideas make a lot of sense, but just when are they going to happen, basically? And when we talk about debt financing for Dows it's basically been a unanimous like yes, we think that this is going to happen at some point but the question is when is it going to happen? And I think in addition to I want to get into regulation in a minute here, because I think there's a different regulatory implication when we're talking about debt versus selling tokens, which I think is important to get into. But also the reason why it didn't necessarily make sense for Dows to issue debt is because what you want, if you're issuing debt, is like steady, predictable cash flows. Right? So that's still a decent headwind for issuing debt. But one of the reasons why maybe it could happen sooner than we all think is because I think a lot of the founders that I've spoken to, and I assume probably you have a similar experience. Is that the yield farming method of growth worked really well on the way up, but it really sucks on the way down because then you're basically relying on diluting yourself to generate growth. And as the token fall, like when tokens are falling, people just sell the tokens, which means you need to give more and more of your tokens away, and it's just really negative enforcing feedback loop. And when I looked at the ribbon thing I thought it was a really elegant solution because you basically looked at your treasury and it was a really easy way to get liquidity on what you had in your treasury as opposed to this doom loop of just giving rewards.
00:28:15.158 - 00:28:20.106, Speaker B: So that's how I kind of saw I don't know, was that basically the motivation or what do you think?
00:28:20.288 - 00:28:31.438, Speaker A: Yeah, I think exactly that their token had traded down significantly. They didn't want to sell more of the RBN token if they didn't need to.
00:28:31.604 - 00:29:03.130, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Can you walk us through? I know regulation is a big part of this right? Debt. There's a lot of gray area still to be fleshed out in what really constitutes a security right on the token side, that's kind of being deliberated, and that's using the howie test, I think maybe for tokens versus for debt, like traditional debt instruments like we're talking about, it might be a little bit more kind of black and white. Walk us through. What are some of the regulatory implications of credit or debt being issued on blockchains?
00:29:03.550 - 00:29:41.190, Speaker A: I think that's spot on. I think if a Dow is issuing a bond or convert that's a security almost unambiguously. And I happen to be a kind of permissioned DeFi bull and I think permissioned pools are really the way of the future. So I ultimately think that there will be kind of permissionless debt issuance by Dows, some Dows will geofence us users, et cetera. But I think the majority of debt issuance on chain will take the form of permissioned pools.
00:29:42.170 - 00:30:00.890, Speaker C: Ben is that why Porter Finance I think Jordan ended up shutting did he shut down Porter Finance or at least they shut down their bond issuance? Like how much of that was because the regulatory side of things versus the competitive nature of rates offered in Tradpi right now versus just the lack of institutional fixed income.
00:30:01.050 - 00:31:17.670, Speaker A: It was mostly a regulatory consideration given if you're running a platform to allow debt issuance on chain, you're effectively acting as a broker dealer and there are a number of other regulatory implications around that. I think the other kind of thought, at least from Jordan, was that the market size at least today is not enormous in that if you look at who would be issuing these bonds today, it's not like we're going to have Bitcoin bonds or ethereum bonds or layer one bonds. It's going to be mostly at the application layer. It's going to be mostly bonds issued by Dows. And the total market for governance tokens today is 50 to 100 billion. So you assume that let's say it's 100 billion and you assume that for every $2 of governance token there's $1 of debt, that's 50 billion of debt. And if they're taking a small cut of issuance and even if they're capturing 100% of the market you have to kind of squint to really see that being a home run outcome.
00:31:17.670 - 00:31:23.510, Speaker A: So that I think was the other factor in kind of the decision.
00:31:25.370 - 00:31:39.660, Speaker B: What do you think if you had to guess the size of let's say it's ten to 15 years from now, what do you think the market size or like activity in permissioned DFI versus permissionless DFI? How do you see that shaking out?
00:31:40.510 - 00:31:45.470, Speaker A: I think permissioned DFI is going to be much bigger, like orders of magnitude bigger.
00:31:49.650 - 00:31:55.794, Speaker C: Ben can you define permission DeFi versus permissionless and then I cut you off there?
00:31:55.832 - 00:33:00.520, Speaker A: No definitely, I mean look, I think that I define permissioned DeFi as everyone interacting with a pool or contract has gone through KYC AML and effectively has a compliance credentials in their wallet that proves that they're credited investor qualified purchaser and has other metadata associated with where they live and their activity on. You know, I kind of imagine a state of the world Morgan is going to fork compound and say, hey, only people that have a certain NFT in their wallet can interact with our money market, with the Morgan money market. And that's kind of how I define permissioned DeFi. And there's some. Stuff that's like quasi permissionless. Quasi permissioned. But what I just mentioned is probably the most extreme view of it.
00:33:02.490 - 00:33:18.042, Speaker C: So do you think that there will be like almost the user flow here? Is there'll be an on chain KYC AML provider and you'll go through that, they'll basically drop a KYC AML like token in your wallet. If you have the token in your wallet, you'll be able to access the KYC AML version exactly.
00:33:18.096 - 00:33:57.320, Speaker A: There are maybe five to ten teams today building that compliance passport, so to speak. And the way I see it is maybe there's one pool that says only qualified purchasers from the US. And the EU can interact with this uniswap pool. And maybe there's another one that's only for accredited investors or eligible contract participants or you have to have a certain net worth on chain. And so I think ultimately you'll have your credentials in your wallet and then you'll be able to interact openly with contracts in the permissioned DeFi space.
00:33:58.650 - 00:34:10.300, Speaker C: Can I ask a secondary question there, which is will DeFi platforms have the relationships with the users or will CFI and fintech and the Morgan's of the world have.
00:34:13.170 - 00:35:19.474, Speaker A: The fintechs will have relationships directly with the users. And I think about it almost as like a D to B to C distribution model. So Dow to business to consumer. Because the way I look at it is and maybe curious if you guys, how you guys see it as well, but there have really only been like four to 5 million people unique wallets that have interacted with DeFi to date. And I think it's a relatively self selecting group that wants to go through the rigmarole of storing private keys and understanding gas prices and understanding bonding curves and so on. And so vast majority I think CFI will effectively be user capture for all of DeFi and ultimately will be sophisticated enough to make the risk management decision. So someone at Revolute will decide which yearn vault to deposit capital into and the user themselves will be somewhat shielded from a lot of the risk management decision making.
00:35:19.474 - 00:35:38.790, Speaker A: Now individual users that want to go through the process of interacting directly with Dows are more than welcome to or more than able to. I don't think that's going to change, but I just think that extra user capture step is going to ultimately be where the majority of users come into DeFi.
00:35:40.970 - 00:36:29.330, Speaker B: What do you think? Maybe if we could return to the subject of debt just for a second. Like the analog in tradfi's debt kind of gets broken up into three different groups, right? There's debt at the consumer level, there's debt at the corporate level, and then there's debt at kind of the sovereign level. So maybe we could I don't know how useful that analog really is going to be because maybe at the consumer level that's still going to just get done through. Although honestly I do think that's an opportunity for DFI because it's so hard to get debt from to get a loan from your bank. It just sucks. And mostly that's really credit card debt when people are measuring consumer debt. But one thing I'd love to get your perspective on is where yield is generated in the form maybe of actually on the L one level, like around ETH kind of staking as just a big source of yield.
00:36:29.330 - 00:36:54.590, Speaker B: Like in traditional capital markets like the Perma, the enormous generator of yield really is government's desire to borrow, right? And really it's like the US government is like the biggest borrower out there. So there's a really interesting opportunity for yield generation around E Staking. I'd be curious to what kind of opportunity. I don't know how much you are looking into that, but how much is that an area of opportunity in terms of generating yield?
00:36:55.570 - 00:37:53.858, Speaker A: Yeah, look, I think it's a huge opportunity. I mean, ETH as a 200 billion dollar asset is going to be spitting off or is spitting off now ten to $20 billion a year of Staking rewards. That is a massive amount of wealth being distributed every year. So I think the ability to lock in a fixed rate and swap from floating to fixed on ETH staking is going to ultimately be, I think, one of the biggest financial products in DeFi. And I think you're going to be able to do it through CFI and also through DFI. So if, let's say you have St, ETH or CBE, you'll ultimately be able to sell off your future Staking yield or lock in a rate. I mean, one actually example of this is let's say you have $100 worth of ethereum to keep the math simple.
00:37:53.858 - 00:38:17.354, Speaker A: So you would be expecting to earn, let's say like $5 in year one, $4 in year two, this future cash flow stream. Imagine being able to sell off that cash flow stream and pull it forward to today or locking in a fixed rate. I think there's going to be a ton of demand for that over the next couple of years.
00:38:17.552 - 00:38:20.650, Speaker C: You're essentially securitizing the ETH staking yields.
00:38:21.070 - 00:38:21.734, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:38:21.872 - 00:38:25.802, Speaker C: Which I'm assuming then you get all these crazy derivatives markets on the securitization.
00:38:25.866 - 00:39:08.940, Speaker A: Of the ETH taking yield, crazy derivative markets. Because once you have that cash flow stream, someone may be okay taking risk on the first $3 a year, but anything above that, maybe you sell that to a more junior tranche. And so I think you're going to see basically this yield get securitized and bundled. And it's not only the Staking yield, but it'll also be you can bifurcate and sell off just mev or just fees or just the core yield itself, so you can even get more granular is what I imagine this world is going to ultimately look like.
00:39:09.390 - 00:39:15.710, Speaker B: Are we just talking about building a yield curve? Isn't that what we're kind of describing here? Like a yield curve in crypto.
00:39:17.730 - 00:39:57.900, Speaker A: I think to some extent yeah, I think this will be ultimately like the benchmark rate for Ethereum. But I think this is very separate from the dollar borrowing market because I don't know that many Dows will ultimately want to borrow ETH because ultimately if you're borrowing an asset you're short it. And most Dows building are ostensibly bullish on ETH and so I think the liabilities will still ultimately be denominated in dollars and this interest rate swap market on Ethereum will come down to institutions and holders of ETH. Ultimately. Just wanting to lock in rates is my sense.
00:39:59.070 - 00:40:41.478, Speaker B: That's a really interesting point. You were kind of talking about some of the different ways that you could lock in, you could separate fees versus mev. Do you have an opinion on what the opportunity is and what would almost be? Because the way that I would almost think about it is not even like okay, if I have $100 worth of ETH, this is the yield that I could get. Let's say you run a certain number of validators. Basically I would almost price it on the yield that you could get on basically the amount of mev that could be extracted from basically the block space that you have access to or the theoretical block space that you would be taking. How do you kind of suss out different opportunities of the different categories of maybe you can just focus on MEB because it seems like that's a super important category.
00:40:41.574 - 00:40:47.900, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean it's a little bit esoteric in the sense that.
00:40:50.830 - 00:40:51.226, Speaker C: The way.
00:40:51.248 - 00:41:36.250, Speaker A: I think about it is if you're a validator you may not want to make a bet on what you'll earn from mev over the next ten years. You may just not want to play that game. So you may want to basically sell that future revenue stream to someone who does want to play that game. You may just want certainty around that so you can effectively pull forward those cash flows and kind of bifurcate and disaggregate these cash flows and send mev to someone else. So I think a lot of these products probably going to get built on top of lido or on top of other synthetic staking derivatives, maybe by the lido team, maybe by others in the space, and then to a certain extent in CFI.
00:41:39.070 - 00:42:01.650, Speaker B: If you had to guess at the like we've covered kind of two big categories then, like yield that gets pulled basically from the ethereum protocol or, like, let's say other layer ones. Right? We've talked about kind of Dows, dows issuing debt as another major source of debt. Are there any other big buckets of debt or potential borrowers or sources of yield that maybe we haven't covered?
00:42:02.630 - 00:43:11.500, Speaker A: So back on the debt borrowing concept and the concept of kind of back to the Porter Finance example there's no reason that people or companies couldn't issue debt on chain in the same way that Porter did. So if you have a basket of NFTs or governance tokens that don't necessarily aren't marginable on chain on the major money markets you could pledge them to a contract that looks similar to Porter and set your max rate and your desired maturity and borrow against them. So I mean it is possible that there will be some consumer borrowing on chain outside of Compound and Aave again because some people don't have the right collateral or may just want to borrow for five year term. So I think that that will actually be a big bucket. And then in the permissioned world you may see companies or crypto related companies or companies outside of the crypto space also use architecture like that.
00:43:14.670 - 00:44:00.446, Speaker B: Do you think in terms of what might hit first? Like just use the example of let's say Coinbase, right? Coinbase issued a billion and a half dollars worth of debt, I forget when exactly sometime in the last year, I think it was probably in 2021. They chose to just tap capital markets, right? Like regular debt capital markets basically to get that. I know there wasn't the counterfactual right, there wasn't a way that they could have done that on chain or whatever. But one way that I kind of think about it, if you're set up as a company like you're a C Corp and you're Domiciled in the US. Capital markets are pretty efficient for you basically. Whereas for a Dow I don't even think you have the option. Right? Like just look at the way that the maker has structured deals with like bank or you know there's a deal out there with Coinbase Institutional.
00:44:00.446 - 00:44:26.770, Speaker B: It's a whole part of that proposal that's just dedicated to how Maker, the entity as a Dao is going to interact with Coinbase Institutional like Let Morgan or something. Right. So it just kind of seems to me that in the immediate term Dows, I mean maybe just from the mere fact that they have a weird organizational structure like they would tap a crypto native source of debt rather than regular capital.
00:44:29.110 - 00:44:36.914, Speaker A: Think yeah, I think the first cohort of debt issuers are Dows exactly for the reason you just mentioned.
00:44:37.112 - 00:44:56.806, Speaker C: Ben, can I get your take on the Huntington Valley Bank thing? Actually and just like Maker and I'm just curious this is now kind of getting away from the thesis of the show, per se, but I just really want to get your take on Maker and the end game because they're talking a lot about real world assets, which obviously increased the tam of Maker. But I just want to get your take on the whole Maker.
00:44:56.838 - 00:45:45.850, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And congrats by the way on becoming a delegate. I think we voted for you. Okay so my overall view is the end game proposed by Rune is way too complex and complexity is like the death of most things particularly in crypto. I think of the two paths that MakerDAO could go on. One being Phoenix stance like the most decentralized all kind of permissionless collateral the max censorship resistance from any state actor getting rid of USDC as quickly as possible. If that's path one and then path two is kind of giving a bear hug to Tradfine in the real world and doing stuff like Huntington Valley Bank and this coinbase MIP.
00:45:45.850 - 00:46:38.810, Speaker A: My view is they're actually both interesting but doing a combination of the two is the worst possible path forward. It's one of those scenarios where if I could own a token in those two versions of MakerDAO, I think they both have a reasonable chance to build value and create something interesting. But we can't, right? Because you can't fork Dai easily, you can't fork those network effects. And so my sense is if I had to pick one, I'm of the mind that I would pick the route of going full bore into real world assets and just managing risk around it. So managing counterparty risk, managing default risk. But I think that that is ultimately a much bigger tan to chase.
00:46:41.970 - 00:47:07.970, Speaker C: Does the biggest risk to that in your mind like bear hugging the real world assets basically does the biggest risk there seem like to you? Because censorship resistance? Because I feel like that's like what everyone on the forums are talking about. Or is the bigger risk really like the inability to basically assess the risk of 100 million dollar pool from a traditional lender or borrower?
00:47:08.050 - 00:47:55.730, Speaker A: I think that there is when you start interacting with the real world, I think when things don't go well and you have to enforce your rights and remedies as a lender, as a creditor, it's not clear exactly what that looks like or how a bankruptcy judge would treat your claim. And most of the structural setups around real world assets are incredibly complex. So I think that that is a risk and I think the risk that was triggered this whole shift in the community, the tornado cash sanctions in my mind are less of like that doesn't feel like as likely of a risk that all of a sudden.
00:47:57.530 - 00:47:58.006, Speaker B: All the.
00:47:58.028 - 00:48:48.450, Speaker A: USDC in MakerDAO is going to be frozen and Dai is going to be impaired. Ultimately my sense is that regulators that would be a big, consumers would get hurt, consumers will die. I think there would be more of an orderly unwind or some other scenario. But I ultimately think it's more about hey, how do we as lenders? Because that's ultimately what Maker Dow is. It's a lender to D three M and other real world assets. How does Maker Dow actually enforce its rights and remedies? Because my view is MakerDAO's kind of secret weapon is it has the lowest cost of capital of any lender out there because it's just software, it costs nothing to mint more Dai. So it should have a structural advantage over other capital sources.
00:48:48.450 - 00:48:58.940, Speaker A: And so I think actually capitalizing on that requires being able to go after borrowers that don't repay and that's the disconnect in my mind.
00:49:00.030 - 00:49:47.640, Speaker B: What do you think on that Maker? Let's talk about the coinbase and CoinShares issued their own proposal as well for basically how to leverage assets that are sitting in the know. How much of a headwind do you see it being that? Because if you rewind to one year ago everyone was talking about yields in crypto, these really high yields in crypto that was going to be a Trojan horse that was going to bring assets into our space. Now assets or yields in Tradfire creeping up and are actually above where they are in crypto and it looks like they're going to stay that way as long as inflation keeps doing what it's doing. Do you view that as a headwind or are other companies basically like maker are going to be like, hey, we actually have a decent amount on our balance sheet here, we actually want to import some of those yields over from TradFi and they'll view it as an opportunity?
00:49:49.070 - 00:50:49.610, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that it could be an opportunity because the way I look at makers business model is they can mint at 0% and lend out that capital something greater than 0% and that's ultimately that spread is their earnings. It's been very interesting this year to see DeFi yields go from having a massive premium to TradFi to now trading at a discount. So I think that that's been one of the drivers for MakerDAO to actually reach to higher sources of yield because putting capital on Aave and earning 50 bips I think is less appealing and so I think ultimately I view it as an opportunity. I think makers should be able to thrive in an environment where ten year yields are approaching 4%, two year yields are at 4%. That is like a great environment to be a bank.
00:50:51.630 - 00:51:26.470, Speaker B: What do you think? Maybe just to sort of wind down with just asking you some of the central questions of this season, which is how big of an unlock is the ability to borrow lend at a fixed rate in crypto? Right, we've got probably v one of an interest rate market which is you've got pretty good access to variable rate type lending which is good in some situations. But I think we outlined even earlier in this episode about what the logical limits of that are. Let's say we got widespread, the widespread ability to borrow lend at a fixed rate. How big of an unlock is that from a credit perspective for crypto.
00:51:30.030 - 00:52:20.114, Speaker A: I think it's enormous. My sense is it could be the next big unlock in the space. I think kind of drawing an analogy to TradFi to public companies. They tend to operate with 20% to 30% of their capital structure in debt. So if we kind of draw that analogy to crypto, we're talking about tens of billions of dollars of debt issuance on chain and that doesn't really speak to the growth that we expect to see in the space going forward. And non crypto native debt issuance. So CFI players or TradFi players or consumers borrowing, using debt on chain.
00:52:20.114 - 00:53:27.726, Speaker A: So I think it's a huge opportunity and debt just makes more sense on chain in a lot of ways because you have void these mass 300 page credit agreements and bond indentures. The cost of issuance is a lot lower versus kind of going through investment banks and clearinghouses. And also one of the big cost in finance. The only real departments that have grown at banks are compliance and operations. Headcounts generally moved lower in all other parts of financial institutions and within operations, a lot of it's just settling, calculating accrued interest, settling trades and bank loans can take 20 days to settle if you're buying a loan from someone. So there's just this huge unlock with putting credit. With tokenizing credit, interest can accrue natively in the asset similar to C tokens and there's no calculation required for interest.
00:53:27.726 - 00:53:55.080, Speaker A: And you have instant settlement and you eliminate all the legal docs and all the issuance costs. It can all move on chain. And you have reduced bookkeeping, you have better transparency. So as I think about real world assets and as I think about, I think debt is the most obvious place to start. It just makes a heck of a lot sense. It's almost like leapfrogging what we have in TradFi today.
00:53:56.650 - 00:54:55.370, Speaker B: Do you think a lot of the booms that we've seen in crypto are either directly catalyzed by or coincide with some sort of innovation in token distribution? So that in 2017 that was ICOs, right? You basically instead of having to go out around and bootstrap this network of miners to validate your network, they were like, oh, we're just going to sell pre mined coins. That was a big innovation. And we kind of saw this enormous boom back then. Then there was like the finance, there was like the launch pad phase which was, hey, you can actually just launch this in a regulatorily compliant way directly on our exchanges until you'll have access to distribution. That was another big thing. Then there was yield farming which is, hey, just come park your liquidity here, you'll get token X in return. So these like innovations in distribution and that to your point if you consider governance token equity, these are innovations in equity financing.
00:54:55.370 - 00:55:48.746, Speaker B: But in our TradFi analog, a lot of the times these booms like 2008, which is arguably way too big of a boom, that was catalyzed by an innovation in debt financing, which was taking a bunch of mortgages chopping. Them all up and then serving them to different you're diversifying the packet of mortgages and then you could sell them to a whole bunch of different investors. You could magic away risk and then it goes back all the way like Milken kind of did it with junk bonds in the 19th, but you can go back in history and see these debt sort of booms. So I guess my question to you is, do you ever see like, let's say we do get this fixed income unlock and Dows or whoever it is are able to issue debt capital markets in a crypto native way, way more easily? All these benefits get realized. Do you ever see that catalyzing a potential bull run in crypto or being a part of that story?
00:55:48.928 - 00:56:40.666, Speaker A: Yeah. Wow, that's a really interesting framework in some ways. I don't know if this catalyzes the next unlock in crypto, but it will come at some point because it's only natural for Dows, which are effectively companies on the blockchain, to want to pay the least amount they need for financial capital. So it doesn't make like from first principles. I think having an all equity or all governance token capital structure and not issuing any debt is not optimized. And from a technical standpoint, there's really no reason that debt issuance can't exist. I mean, it draws on mechanics that already are out there in DeFi.
00:56:40.666 - 00:56:56.420, Speaker A: So it's a really interesting thought. Could this catalyze the next bull market? I think it's possible. I think the product will exist and it's just a matter of when will this come into play.
00:56:58.790 - 00:58:01.842, Speaker B: One thing, I'm not sure how necessary you view this to maybe realize that vision, but there have been at various different times of financial markets people that were very comfortable with taking an enormous amount of risk in crypto. Our version of that is like what you'd call like degens, right? People who just aped into these farms, no understanding, they would kind of talk to a budy like, hey, is this legit? And then you'd go put a bunch of capital at work and try to farm the yields before it rugged. And that is and honestly, some pretty institutional players have made a lot of money doing that. You know, a lot of these names. But if you go back in right, there was another form of risk that seemed really crazy at the time, which was basically what Soros and Druckenmiller used to do. I mean, people didn't understand that at one point, like leveraging up and then taking bets against entities as big as the bank of England, right, or whatever, when they broke the bank of England. And it was a different type of savage out there in the market who was willing to lever up, take huge positions in really liquid markets.
00:58:01.842 - 00:58:25.280, Speaker B: That's just a different type of risk taker. I wonder, do you think we need kind of a different to your idea of product market fit? I feel like in crypto you're never going to get it right unless you allow for how are speculators going to make money off this? And what it seems to me is we need a different type of speculator, one that almost harkens back to those big levered up speculators in debt markets. Do you know what I'm saying?
00:58:25.650 - 00:59:41.910, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, look, I think that there's a hot ball of capital and stable coins that's hunting every day for the highest yield and it's an incredibly competitive zero sum endeavor. And so if there is Dow issued debt that from a risk adjusted standpoint is attractive and it has an attractive interest rate and attractive structure, capital will buy that. I think that the world loves yield and we learned that in the past cycle in crypto that a lot of the yield was just denominated in governance tokens. But the world loves US dollar denominated yield and I think a lot of the existing stablecoin holders who have stablecoins on chain and are hunting for that would love to buy a uniswap bond or a compound bond or a MakerDAO bond which was also something that was recently thrown out in the forum. So I think it's going to come from existing capital. But then on top of that, I do sense that institutions are not going to be able to resist.
00:59:44.730 - 00:59:45.078, Speaker C: Some of.
00:59:45.084 - 01:00:46.602, Speaker A: These great risk adjusted returns. The Porter finance bond was 500% collateralized for six months. You can effectively price the probability of default based on the implied volatility of the RBN token and my sense is it was pretty attractive. At least that was a conclusion that we came to. I imagine many others in TradFi are going to come to that conclusion because it's actually a different bet. Investing in the uni governance token and building a thesis that token price go up is like a very different orthogonal idea to like will uniswap generate enough cash flow in the next 30 days to repay me so I can earn an 8% return. You don't have to believe in the growth of crypto markets to believe that a properly structured product like that can make you money.
01:00:46.602 - 01:00:52.890, Speaker A: And so that's where I think you maybe start to see these crossover funds or credit funds.
01:00:54.210 - 01:01:34.074, Speaker C: Ben, do you think that that is the I mean, we're always looking for the institutional unlock, right? But like one thing that you haven't seen as quickly as people maybe every year there's always like, oh, the institutions are coming, right? And obviously some institutions have come in but maybe not that quickly. One of the reasons might be because they're just kind of taking potshot bets or they don't feel good about taking potshot bets on whether or not the uni token is going up. But if really this just comes down to a model on uni's cash flow and everything's entirely transparent, you could see the credit institutions actually come in faster than the equity focused institutions. I'm curious if you think that that is how things could play out.
01:01:34.112 - 01:02:48.882, Speaker A: Yeah, it's funny you ask, because a couple of recent conversations I've had with institutions, credit funds in the space that are looking to I mean, they started these initiatives internally last year when yields were higher, but they were saying, hey, can we lend to a Dow? How do we lend to a Dow? Or how do we lend to a protocol? I'm like, look, it's not possible because you're going to want to sign a credit agreement. There's no one working for the Dow that can necessarily be a signatory or it's complex and you're not going to really be able to easily do KYC AML. So I know there is capital that's looking to access fixed income like returns in crypto because I've seen them floating around the space. Now is a question of how big that? I mean, I think there's a ton of capital in private credit funds that are hunting for yield. And I think it will be kind of proving out like default rates and what you can earn on these products initially. And I think with most things in crypto retail, the first movers are retail investors. So I think it's going to be stablecoin holders first.
01:02:48.882 - 01:03:02.870, Speaker A: And then maybe once you see a little bit more of a proven track record, you see default rates, you see some Dows start to repay their loans and issue new debt, then I think you start to attract the institutions.
01:03:03.530 - 01:03:30.894, Speaker B: It's almost like in the same way that some of the earliest adopters of crypto on an institutional standpoint were FX traders, because they were kind of just like, I don't really care what the underlying is, I just care about extracting spreads or whatever. I feel like this is maybe the next step of that, right? Which is like, I don't need to believe that XYZ is the protocol, the future. I just need to be able to underwrite that I'm going to get my principal back. And that could be interesting, right?
01:03:30.932 - 01:04:11.306, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a great point. And you know what else is? I mean, stablecoins are bonds. Like if you own USDC, you're loaning money to circle at 0%, you're taking their counterparty risk. And same with Tether and same with BUSD, and a lot of institutions hold stablecoins today. And so if you're willing to hold a Fiat backed stablecoin at 0%, why wouldn't you be willing to buy a Fiat denominated bond at something greater than that? Now, there is like liquidity and implied default risk, but it's less of a jump than maybe it's not as big of a jump know, we may think.
01:04:11.328 - 01:05:06.382, Speaker B: It well, yeah, it's I wonder even at the current even? Even. The maker proposal between coinbase. The coinbase really made me think because it took me a little while to dig into how are they able to not unwrap USDC for that to work? And then it was like, okay, well, there's center the consortium and they have this revenue share agreement and then it depends on where the USDC is custody and there's some sort of rev split. So basically this is more of like coinbase sharing rewards that they were already getting with. Maker and that's why they could keep it on the but it just made me what circle is really generating a staggering amount of money on this. And I have to imagine people are looking at that and being like, wait a second, dude, I want to get in on this. I wonder how many competitors there are either realizing this or cropping up their own solutions at the current time.
01:05:06.382 - 01:05:16.066, Speaker B: Because I don't think they're going to be allowed to just own this use case as the blue chip stable indefinitely. But we'll see.
01:05:16.168 - 01:05:50.710, Speaker A: Yeah. If we used cUSDC or some rebasing stablecoin as our stablecoin and everyone settled in that I think that would probably make more sense because it would allow users to recapture more of that yield. But I think there's such like a shelling point and so much inertia around just using USDC 0% USDC, unwrapped USDC as kind of the medium of exchange in DeFi that maybe that never changes. And in the meantime, Circle is making the center JV is making an absolute killing.
01:05:50.790 - 01:06:25.080, Speaker B: Yeah, it's still the biggest businesses in crypto are the ones that move assets from the real world into crypto and it was exchanges and then in a way that's really what Circle does. They import assets which are dollars from the real world into maintenance. Undefeated. Ben, this has been just a ton of fun, my man. Seriously. Given us a lot to think about. I got to plug you at like if folks want to figure out more about you and what you do at ParaFi or follow you or anything, what's the best way to do it?
01:06:25.690 - 01:06:35.420, Speaker A: So I'm unique in the space in that I'm read only on Twitter so you can find me. I'll give you my email address. Ben Foreman at.
01:06:38.110 - 01:06:52.560, Speaker C: Don'T you I always go to tag you and tag you and things on Twitter. Why don't you have a Twitter? Or I know you do have a Twitter, but like you're read only the KKR way. Just says, I don't know. It's a good.
01:06:55.650 - 01:07:05.950, Speaker A: Like I just kept on putting off signing up for it and I don't know, maybe I'm in a non on Twitter.
01:07:06.030 - 01:07:11.938, Speaker C: Served you well. Yeah. This is a blast. I echo what Mike said. Thanks again for coming on, Ben.
01:07:12.034 - 01:07:15.702, Speaker A: Yeah, thanks a lot for having me on. Really appreciate it. This was fun.
01:07:15.756 - 01:07:16.214, Speaker B: Cheers, guys.
01:07:16.252 - 01:07:16.840, Speaker A: Thanks.
01:07:18.170 - 01:07:21.320, Speaker B: All right. Big interview. That was a really good one with.
01:07:22.330 - 01:07:31.326, Speaker C: Was that was ben's just one of my favorite people. He's like very articulate and very thoughtful. Thinker on where DeFi is headed and.
01:07:31.348 - 01:07:33.050, Speaker B: I feel like I like thoughtful thinkers.
01:07:33.130 - 01:07:39.038, Speaker C: I like thoughtful know the thoughtful thinkers. We like thoughtful beats the hell out.
01:07:39.044 - 01:07:41.550, Speaker B: Of unthoughtful thinkers, I will tell you that.
01:07:41.700 - 01:07:46.100, Speaker C: Like yourself, I'm stuck with you every day. So somehow I've been able to deal with it.
01:07:46.630 - 01:08:09.766, Speaker B: You know what? Ben deserves an extra shout out because I ran this thesis by a bunch of people. And he was really helpful in the beginning, just like helping sound all of this out. And I think one of the reasons I like this interview is that it just brought together in a supernatural way a whole bunch of different themes that we'd been talking about here's.
01:08:09.798 - 01:09:07.930, Speaker C: What I thought was cool from this episode is the aspect of programmability on a loan, the programmability on both sides of the loan. So the programmability, in terms of having a smart contract, basically be able to be loan using a smart contract against the protocol's revenue that's like before the loan happens, basically. And that's a really interesting way to structure it. And then after a loan, or like on the other side of the loan, I guess I would call it the ability to basically program into the like you can only use it for these three things which we talked about two episodes ago, right, with Teddy and with Sid. So I think I don't know, sometimes it's easy to lose track of how crazy these smart contracts are and how cool it is, what we're building here. And just this idea of being able to program all this stuff into the smart contract and into the loan makes it quite interesting.
01:09:08.000 - 01:10:03.642, Speaker B: I think it brings it back to also Teddy's kind of idea that a lot of this is about capital efficiency because what you're basically doing is removing layers of risk. And it's much better from the standpoint of a borrower. Try to think of yourself when the overton window has shifted towards where once you lend someone capital, you're used to just getting a programmatic stream of income based on top line sales, instead of, oh, yeah, you get paid. Back in increments of every month or every quarter. And then you have no transparency into the process other than whether or not your income comes. And then at the end you get your principal mean. To me, it will feel very obvious as well once that overton window shifts, the pure transparency that DeFi gives you and what that should lead to is you're underwriting less risk.
01:10:03.642 - 01:10:06.670, Speaker B: So it should be more capital efficient in general.
01:10:06.740 - 01:10:27.720, Speaker C: Yeah. What did you think of that idea near the end talking about maybe it's not the institutional investor of equities who comes in and basically buys up our bags and prices go up. That's why everyone's excited about the institutions coming in. But really, it might be the credit folks, the institutional credit side of things, who just looks at this and says, oh, I can underwrite this. What did you think of that?
01:10:28.810 - 01:11:20.630, Speaker B: I really like that idea because then I like the idea of you get onboarded to crypto. Yeah, some people are like these believers and missionaries, but oftentimes I think it's a much better incentive structure if you can find someone, a group of people who find a way to make money in this space, especially in the beginning, before you have time to get bought in and really integrate yourself in the community. So I think there was a reason, like, we kind of talked about why FX traders adopted crypto very early, because they didn't get all these they didn't get all harangued up on, this looks so different and weird. They were just like, I understand this looks like a market that I'm familiar with, and I know that I could make money here. And I think in the same way that debt investors are just like, I know how to underwrite risk. So underwriting risk in market x is not that different from underwriting risk in market y at least once I have my framework. So, yeah, I thought that was extremely interesting.
01:11:20.780 - 01:11:56.162, Speaker C: I've been thinking about this idea recently of people only come into crypto once they see something that's very recognizable to them, and they already have a mental model for it. And they're like, oh, this looks like that thing that I know. Okay, now I can come in, right? You saw it with the FX traders, like you mentioned. I will use you as an example. I remember we talked about crypto, and then you're like, you fell for the wrong thing. I will say, but you're like, enterprise is putting their supply chains on the blockchain. Oh, I get this.
01:11:56.162 - 01:12:22.106, Speaker C: Okay, I'm coming in. And then you get pulled in. And I just think that that is how everyone gets pulled in. And you need the thing. Like, artists didn't like crypto stuff, and then they saw NFT, they're like, oh, I see this. Okay. And I think the credit folks will get pulled in when this stuff, the institutional credit folks will get pulled in when they can see this be oh, like, that model and underwriting looks like something that I understand.
01:12:22.106 - 01:12:23.500, Speaker C: Okay, I'm coming.
01:12:24.030 - 01:12:42.330, Speaker B: Yeah, someone, I think it was probably Raul Paul who said this on something. He's like, there's no silver bullet for what works with everyone. I mean, we learned this right with the thesis of blockworks in general. It's not really a language problem. It's just you got to get the ideas out there. There have to be enough good ideas. And someone I agree exactly with what you just described.
01:12:42.330 - 01:13:20.460, Speaker B: They will say, oh, this thing is kind of like this other thing that I know. Let me dig in a little bit. And oftentimes you can be wrong about what that first surface level similarity is, but then you're already kind of bought in and total agreement with you. You know, we didn't actually call this out on the interview, but it's funny that we ended the interview with sid and teddy, and teddy predicted. I think the thing that might bring us down on the next bull cycle is debt that's collateralized with basically governance tokens. And ben's like, yeah, very bullish on that. So I don't know.
01:13:20.460 - 01:14:10.380, Speaker B: I do think one thing people might not give I don't mean to say ben. Ben's a very sophisticated investor, but I wonder if there are logical limits on what just makes good collateral in general. And I do think it would be worth looking throughout history of, like, you could find times when you collateralize debt with equity, and that hasn't typically ended very well. But I think Alan from Yield Protocol basically said it correctly is that that's kind of just like unsecured lending, and there's no such thing as a bad loan, there's just a bad rate. So I think there probably has to be at least one cycle of maybe not pricing risk correctly before we figure that out, but it's probably some weird pseudo uncollateralized loan, or like an uncollateralized loan with a call option attached to it.
01:14:10.910 - 01:14:15.790, Speaker C: What is the market like for weird collateral? Have you ever looked into the market for weird collateral?
01:14:16.370 - 01:14:17.390, Speaker B: I have not.
01:14:17.540 - 01:14:24.174, Speaker C: Talking to someone earlier today. They've got a bunch of horses. And horses are valuable, right? Let's say a horse is like $50.
01:14:24.292 - 01:14:29.026, Speaker B: Do I know this person? Who are you chatting with that has a bunch of you can tell me.
01:14:29.048 - 01:14:32.530, Speaker C: Offline off the record. Off the record horror conversation.
01:14:32.950 - 01:14:37.490, Speaker B: Is this part of the dowry that you're getting with Dana? The horses?
01:14:40.330 - 01:14:57.020, Speaker C: Let's say ten horses. Each horse is like fifty k, five hundred k moving past that. Moving past that. 500k for the horses. Can you use 500K? Can the horses be five hundred K of collateral? Probably.
01:14:59.710 - 01:15:52.138, Speaker B: Yeah, I suppose. I guess if it was me and someone was posting 500k in collateral for horses, you'd have to give some big discount, because it was like, okay, if worst comes to worst, I'd love to not receive physical delivery on $500,000 worth of horses, because I would then have to figure out how to sell those horses to a rancher. But this is where their capital efficiency comes into play, right? Where I guess if there was an ultra liquid horse market of people that would just come over to my apartment, or there was big stables local to New York where I could go, yeah, I'll accept my horses here, and I'm just going to put them over here, and then I know there's a service where he can connect. But that's not how it works. So I wouldn't accept it at face value to have to take a super big discount, probably like two hundred k or one hundred and fifty k worth of value because I don't know what.
01:15:52.144 - 01:15:58.778, Speaker C: The hell I would do with horses. And by the way, the dowry is not ten horses. It's just one horse for the dowry. Just one horse.
01:15:58.954 - 01:16:47.934, Speaker B: Hey, buddy, don't sell yourself short, okay? The last thing that I thought was interesting, too, was talking about I was glad to hear that from someone who was actually involved with the Porter Finance ribbon Dow convert debt issuance. That the whole express point of it was to get liquidity on their treasury without necessarily selling any more ribbon tokens. Right? Because that was something that we theorized that was probably the reason behind it. So it was interesting to hear that that actually was the driver. And again, constant theme throughout this season. Ben seemed very interested in it was like, yeah, dows will add debt financing to the mix. Question is just when? And I do think it's right to also question how that's going to work from a regulatory perspective as well.
01:16:47.972 - 01:16:52.960, Speaker C: Yeah. Good, cool. Good. At. We got one more.
01:16:53.970 - 01:16:59.870, Speaker B: One more, baby. Should we keep it a surprise or should we announce who's going to be on the episode?
01:17:00.030 - 01:17:02.210, Speaker C: Surprise. You got to hit that subscribe button.
01:17:02.360 - 01:17:12.790, Speaker B: This one's going to be a banger, though. This one I'm hyped for this one. Yeah, this one's going to be a blast. So it's the season finale, so tune in. It's going to be a good one. Worth your time, I promise.
01:17:13.290 - 01:17:38.698, Speaker C: If you guys have ideas on season two, mike and I have started thinking about season two and what that looks like. So you guys should tweet at us and let us know what you think some themes or thesis should be for season two. We have some ideas we want to hear from you. So tweeted us. You should also rate and review the show if you haven't already. And also we got a couple requests to sponsor season two. So if you are a company and you are looking to sponsor season two, just shoot me a DM on Twitter.
01:17:38.698 - 01:17:44.302, Speaker C: We got you. So Mike, enjoy the rest of your day, partner, and see you on the other side.
01:17:44.436 - 01:17:45.050, Speaker B: Peace, buddy.
