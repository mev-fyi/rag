00:00:00.090 - 00:00:21.550, Speaker A: The average users and the average borrower dollar really wants to have fixed rates. I don't see any reason why that would be different in DeFi. If we want DeFi to go mainstream, I think we have to go meet users where their preferences are, and they have clearly expressed their preferences here in traditional capital markets.
00:00:24.890 - 00:00:37.026, Speaker B: Everyone, welcome to another episode of Bell Curve. You know, who are we talking to today? Tushar, baby. Tushar. Tushar Jane's. What is up with that accent? Never do that again. But we are talking to Sharjane.
00:00:37.138 - 00:00:41.338, Speaker C: It's the best introductar's ever got, right? There you go. You take this.
00:00:41.424 - 00:01:08.046, Speaker B: He's going to listen and be like, I'm never doing an interview with these guys again. All right, there actually is a method. So, Tushar Jane, obviously. He's a managing partner in multicoin. We called him on for two reasons. So in episode one, we talked to Michael and Vance about, you know, the death of CFI, which is a little bit of a marketing gimmicky kind of name. But basically all of this, the recent implosion of CFI leverage taking way down, it's going to push activity on the margin out into DeFi.
00:01:08.046 - 00:01:36.242, Speaker B: So that creates an opportunity. Tushar actually outlined what one of those opportunities were. So in October of last year, he wrote a really great piece called Exploring the Opportunity for DeFi Interest Rate Markets. And what he basically was talking about was the need for exactly what our thesis is fixed rate borrowing, right? Which he quoted from a paper that notional wrote, teddy's actually coming on the pod as well. In 2018, there was $15.3 trillion of debt outstanding in the US corporate debt market. 88% of that was in fixed rates.
00:01:36.242 - 00:02:18.130, Speaker B: He also outlined that the way that you do that is through this market for interest rates. Watts, which we talked a lot about in the pilot, but that's basically an interest rate swap, is a swap of different cash flows in the future. So you swap, I've got interest rate X, you've got interest rate Y. We agree to swap cash flows. It's a way to hedge, but it's also a way to lock in fixed rate borrowing. So he kind of outlined what the opportunity for that was in DeFi and what some of the different models that people were trying so he actually got into, like, in the weeds, right, of how it actually might work. But he's in the process of building out this really interesting thesis about what catalyzes bull markets, right? So he says it's an innovation in token distribution, right? So in 2017 in ICOs, it was because back then it was all about proof of work type coins.
00:02:18.130 - 00:02:46.122, Speaker B: You didn't actually need to go out and create all of these different get all these different people to verify your network. You could sold pre mined tokens, right? That was a big innovation in terms of distributing tokens. Boom led to the big boom in ICOs. Then you actually had launch pads. Like in 2019, there was a finance launch pad when you could just launch directly in a compliant way onto finance. So you had a bunch of liquidity there that caused a little mini bubble. Then more prominently, your DFI Summer in 2020, which was yield farming, and then you had NFTs.
00:02:46.122 - 00:03:28.234, Speaker B: But basically the idea is all of these things, I think to us they look like some form of equity financing, which are these protocols. They're giving away tokens, which is kind of ownership right in the protocol, the right to vote or governance tokens in general. And that kicks off these bull markets. But in traditional markets, you and I have talked about, actually what usually ends up kicking things off is a bubble in debt. Most recently, that was CDOs in 2008 for the great financial crisis. You can go all the way back, right? I mean, like Michael Milken in the late 80s slinging junk bonds around, he basically created an asset class for that in the United States. So basically mapping these two concepts together, the unlock that gets created by fixed rate borrowing and this idea of equity financing, innovation, equity financing, kicking off bull markets.
00:03:28.234 - 00:03:39.860, Speaker B: We wanted to get his impression of, do you think that there's ever going to be a debt based bull market? Something, a debt based catalyst that kicks off a bull market in crypto? And so that's what we got his opinion on.
00:03:40.950 - 00:03:42.980, Speaker C: I added no value to this intro.
00:03:43.590 - 00:03:45.060, Speaker B: No, you did not, my friend.
00:03:45.430 - 00:03:48.194, Speaker C: I added arguably negative value to the intro.
00:03:48.392 - 00:03:51.586, Speaker B: All right, buddy. Well, we can wrap it there. Let's get into the interview with Tushar. Boom.
00:03:51.618 - 00:03:52.680, Speaker C: Let's get into it.
00:03:53.290 - 00:04:03.094, Speaker B: All right, everyone, welcome back to another episode of Bell Curve. Today we're joined by managing partner at multicoin, Tushar, Jane Tushar. Welcome to the show.
00:04:03.212 - 00:04:05.974, Speaker A: Hello, it's great to be here. Thanks for having me.
00:04:06.092 - 00:04:50.790, Speaker B: Hey, man, we're really excited about it. We've got two really big topics that we want to cover with you today. They're going to seem different when I outline them here, but we're going to make them connect at the end of the episode. So we're going to talk about DFI native interest rate markets, which you wrote a great piece on back in October of 2021, the previous year, and this really interesting new thesis that you have on distribution mechanisms around tokens and how that leads to or tends to catalyze different bull markets in crypto. But I want to start with kind of the high level on the interest rate market side of things. So you wrote this great piece again back in October of 2021 of this past year, talking about this big opportunity that you saw for a market for interest rate swaps. So can you just give us the overview of why did you write this paper and what do you find interesting about the market for interest rate swaps in crypto?
00:04:50.870 - 00:05:45.642, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. So I like looking for primitives things that can be composed to build bigger products with more features and such. And when it comes to DeFi, there is nothing more primitive than an interest rate swap, in my opinion. So much of modern finance is just about borrowing at fixed rates versus floating rates and the arbitrage between them and the fixed income market. And interest rate derivatives are by far the most liquid derivative out there. Interest rate swaps are like at least as of the time that I wrote this post in October, 6 and a half trillion dollars, trillion with a T of daily traded volume, and it was over 80% of the world's total derivatives volume. These are staggering, staggering numbers.
00:05:45.642 - 00:06:46.640, Speaker A: These are some of the deepest, most liquid markets out there. And then I looked at DFI in its incarnation right now, and it's almost all variable rate lending. I would go so far as, say it's like 98, 99 or higher percent is variable rate. And that introduces risk for borrowers. If I'm a borrower, I may not want to take out a loan that is a floating rate loan, just like people may not want to take out, like, floating rate mortgages, because then when rates go up, your debt service payment, your interest payment goes up, and you may not be able to afford it. And then you get liquidated. That sounds terrible, right? So I think that there's a lot of people who don't want to borrow at floating rates, especially mainstream users, I think are more partial to fixed rates if you look at what the traditional economy looks like.
00:06:46.640 - 00:07:26.950, Speaker A: And so that's where I saw an opportunity. And the very nice thing here is that with something like interest rate swaps, you can compose floating rate and fixed rate markets together. So you can enable efficient arbitrage between those markets and you can have the liquidity of one market help kickstart the other market because you're able to have this very efficient construction. So that's what I found very interesting, very interesting about this market. And that's why I wrote that post. We also made an investment in a protocol called Strips, which we announced in that post that is building interest rate swaps.
00:07:27.290 - 00:07:53.700, Speaker B: Yeah, so I want to just start for those who might not be familiar with this market, because you're right, it's a huge market. And actually when I read those statistics in your report, I actually had to go look it up. It's like, it's really this big of a market and it's an enormous market. So can you just walk us through it, like at a high level, what an interest rate swap is and how this super large super liquid market transforms variable interest rates in TradFi into more fixed income rates? Like, what does the actual mechanism look like?
00:07:54.310 - 00:08:48.258, Speaker A: So there's a variety of mechanisms that can be used. And what we tried to do is understand the design trade offs of each of the constructions that's usually our mo when it comes to analyzing a new complex large market. Usually I don't think there's a right answer for a design of something like this. There are trade offs along the pareto frontier and it is helpful to know where is that pareto frontier. So there's a few constructions for fixed rate lending or interest rate derivative markets. I think the simplest one is zero coupon bonds. This is very intuitive and easy to grasp.
00:08:48.258 - 00:09:36.470, Speaker A: I borrow money, I have to pay you back. I borrow X dollars, I have to pay you back Y dollars at Z date and that's it. And that can be a liquid tradable asset for you, like a bond and you can go and sell it to someone else and I would have to pay them back. This is an interesting primitive just because it is very simple. It supports both fixed rate lending and borrowing so both sides can have fixed rates, which is helpful. It's relatively safe because everything is over collateralized and very interestingly. This allows you to build a yield curve on top of the protocol because you can see the yields at which the various bonds are trading with various maturities.
00:09:36.470 - 00:10:33.734, Speaker A: And having a yield curve is like one of the most important kind of analytical tools in financial markets. So that's what's powerful about this construction. The downside though is that it fragments liquidity across these different expiries. You need an oracle for the collateral or debt ratio and this introduces some risk and it's capital inefficient for speculators or market makers. It is very simple and efficient for organic market participants who want to be there, like the lenders and the borrowers. But if you want to increase the liquidity of a market you have to make it easy and efficient for market makers as well who are showing up just to do the math and collect arbitrage profits. And zero coupon bonds don't do the best job at that.
00:10:33.734 - 00:10:36.600, Speaker A: There's a bit more capital inefficiency there.
00:10:39.530 - 00:11:42.906, Speaker B: No, I think that's a helpful I mean, really, what I just wanted to make clear to the audience is that just a swap it's a swap of future cash flows, right? So if there's company A and company B they agree to say at a certain point in the future you can swap different cash flows and the way that that works, right, transforming a variable interest rate like the kind you might get from Ethereum, right, which there's a variable stake rate there. There are variable rates that get produced on compound and ave is you might say hey, I don't want to take any of that variable risk. So you can basically do something like an option and say I actually want to sell in a future date the option to collect this amount, basically and that's good for whoever sells that, right? They're kind of taking a speculative bet that interest rates aren't going to spike and then you as a borrower get to lock in a fixed rate. And you kind of mentioned why that there was a preference for borrowers to borrow at a fixed rate. I think Jason and I as operators of company have a pretty good intuitive understanding of what that is. But walk us through why you think that the market for fixed rate lending might even be bigger than variable rate lending. Right.
00:11:42.906 - 00:11:59.940, Speaker B: Because Compound and Ave have been great, but I think there's some limited upside there because all you get is this variable yield that if you're a company you can't borrow at 2% knowing that it might spike to 20% the next day. Right. So walk us through more concretely. How does this expand the market just for lending products in crypto in general?
00:12:00.310 - 00:12:58.706, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we can look at traditional financial markets as a signpost here. I generally think that we in DFI are speed running the lessons of traditional financial markets. Basically everything that took traditional financial markets 150 years to evolve, like we're doing it in five, which is pretty incredible. And so when you look at traditional financial markets, in 2018 there was about $15.3 trillion of debt outstanding in US corporate debt and mortgage debt, not counting Sovereign, not counting Treasuries and 88% of that debt was in fixed interest rate terms. So like, the market has spoken very loudly that the average users and the average borrower dollar really wants to have fixed rates. I don't see any reason why that would be different in DeFi.
00:12:58.706 - 00:13:08.710, Speaker A: If we want DeFi to go mainstream, I think we have to go meet users where their preferences are and they have clearly expressed their preferences here in traditional capital markets.
00:13:09.850 - 00:13:11.906, Speaker C: How does this work in traditional capital markets?
00:13:11.938 - 00:13:12.278, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:12.364 - 00:13:21.110, Speaker C: I don't think you ever have a borrower who goes into a bank and is like, I want to do a swap, give me a swap. They go in and they say, I want a fixed rate loan.
00:13:21.190 - 00:13:21.434, Speaker B: Right?
00:13:21.472 - 00:13:37.026, Speaker C: So then the bank says, okay, we'll give you that fixed rate loan. They take that and they basically give that to what? The interest rate swaps desk. And the desk trades the loans out. What are the mechanisms of how this works in traditional capital markets right now?
00:13:37.128 - 00:14:25.060, Speaker A: Yeah, that's fairly accurate. Basically you have the banks managing two things here. You have them managing credit risk and rate risk. Right. You don't want to be a long term lender at 1% interest rates before the Fed goes and raises interest rates a whole bunch. If you just do the math on how much that bond is worth after rates have been raised, you as a lender are losing money on a mark to market basis. So banks typically very strictly monitor what their interest rate exposure is to understand what would happen to the mark to market value of the loans on their books as interest rates change.
00:14:25.060 - 00:15:01.722, Speaker A: And frequently they will go to like an interest rate swaps desk, basically a group of traders within the bank that will hedge out some of that risk for the bank by saying I have too much floating rate risk. I will sell you the income that I will get from these loans in exchange for a fixed coupon payment that you pay me. That's the simplest instantiation of it though. These contracts frequently get extremely sophisticated and complex with tremendous amounts of leverage in them.
00:15:01.856 - 00:15:50.026, Speaker B: Right now, to your point, just about fixed income markets or fixed rate markets being much larger than variable in crypto right now across many of the DFI protocols, like your makers, your compounds, your Ave, there's about $10 billion worth of outstanding loans. If we use that 80% analog from TradFi that we're saying maybe even today, right. If the ability to borrow in a fixed rate existed, you could expect that market to be somewhere on the magnitude of like four times larger. What you also need there though is you need kind of product market fit for these credit products. And what we haven't really seen actually is who's going to step in and who wants to borrow at the fixed rate. You actually outlined two different groups, I think that might provide some of that demand for borrow. So you kind of talked about neo banks and institutions and then you actually talked about Dows, which I thought was extremely interesting as well.
00:15:50.026 - 00:16:04.740, Speaker B: I want to start with maybe the neo bank institutional side of things. What does demand look like from that customer segment? How would they leverage the existence of fixed rate credit products and kind of proliferate there?
00:16:05.430 - 00:17:01.346, Speaker A: Yeah, I think neo banks are more on the supply side of this market. I think that fixed rates are interesting because then if you are a neo bank, you can offer fixed rates to your depositors and you're not taking the risk of offering a fixed rate but earning a floating rate. You're able to properly hedge it out, which I think is really preferable for a lot of these entities. They don't want to take that risk, right? No one wants to really take that type of mismatch. I think your market size characterization sounds right. I think that there's a very significant market that is not being met yet for DeFi lending. And I have two theories for why that is.
00:17:01.346 - 00:18:24.550, Speaker A: One is our conversation that we're having today about fixed rate markets. But the second is the nature of collateral in DeFi lending versus in traditional finance. The fact that all lending in DeFi is over collateralized is hugely restrictive on the market for lending. However, without the ability to have legal recourse to go after a delinquent borrower, it is very scary to lend an under collateralized DeFi protocol that's just asking for trouble. Right? You're putting those pennies down in front of a steamroller, or you're picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, and then you have, like, a giant Three Arrows type event, and it can wipe out all of the earnings that you've had in the past ten years or something crazy. Because they weren't collateralized and you don't have any recourse. So if that's the case, that's actually pretty bearish for DFI in my mind, because I don't see a plausible path for under collateralized lending on DeFi without legal recourse scaling to the billions of dollars of scale without tremendous, tremendous risk.
00:18:24.710 - 00:18:53.080, Speaker B: Yeah, I think under collateralized lending is like the big that's one of the big white whales that hasn't because again, I don't know the statistics off the top of my head, but the amount of lending that's collateralized in TradFi is much, much smaller, right? Like an order of magnitude smaller than under collateralized lending. Which also just makes sense. Usually people go to get a loan because they need capital, not because usually over collateralized lending is like you're trying to leverage your existing capital. So it's just a very different thing.
00:18:55.130 - 00:18:58.554, Speaker A: I wanted to talk about Dows here for a second.
00:18:58.672 - 00:19:00.586, Speaker B: Yeah, please.
00:19:00.768 - 00:19:54.982, Speaker A: I think that is maybe the one place where under collateralized lending and DFI can work because you're lending to a smart contract, you're not lending to a person or an entity, you're lending to a contract. And that contract is the shelling point for the community. It's not easy to change it, right. If you have a very large Dow, let's say, with 10 million contributors in it, and then you go take out a loan for, let's say, $100 million on the future cash flows of that Dow, whatever the Dow does. It is hard for you to then get all 10 million people to switch to a new contract and avoid having to pay your debt. Of course, the borrower could still default, like if the Dow stops earning cash flow or something, for whatever reason that is possible. But you can't easily, willingly default.
00:19:54.982 - 00:20:08.506, Speaker A: You can't game the system. And so that's why I think protocol to Dow lending is probably the most interesting spot for growth in DeFi credit markets.
00:20:08.698 - 00:21:07.570, Speaker B: I tend to agree with you and I would actually plus one that with what do you think about this idea? A lot of the way that these Dows have grown, right, they've done things like yield farming, which is basically bootstrapping through something that looks like related to equity financing, right? Given equity like instruments in the form of tokens out to their community, pull growth forward from the future. That's great. That's really worked super well. But I think what people are kind of starting to realize in this bear market is that you bring on a lot of mercenary type liquidity. It's a very expensive way of acquiring new customers because it's equity financing, right? So eventually it makes sense to me that Dows will pursue some form of debt financing, right? They'll start to add debt to their financing mix as opposed to just 100% equity. And even if you think about something like Ave? Ave will have been around maybe by the time the next bull cycle kicks off for like five to seven years depending on when that is. That's typically around the time where companies are mature enough, have steady enough cash flows to pursue some form of debt financing in there.
00:21:07.570 - 00:21:24.134, Speaker B: So there's also just the sense of like eventually people will come in, they'll start managing Treasuries in a much more traditional way and they'll start pursuing finance in a much more traditional way. I think it makes a lot more sense for Dows to go through like a DeFi native credit product than going to a big bank or lender. I don't know, your thoughts are there.
00:21:24.172 - 00:22:19.480, Speaker A: Yeah, I would agree. I think if you have a protocol that is earning cash flows that can be quite attractive. Lending marketplaces a little bit weird here. That's kind of like a bank going to the lending markets which is a very complex subset of the credit markets that's more about capital markets than other credit type things. So I'm really excited to look at Dows that are providing some good or service outside of borrowed that earn cash flows. Let's say SushiSwap would be an interesting example because they earn five bits of all trading volume. So if they wanted to borrow money because I think that that would be interesting.
00:22:19.480 - 00:22:35.850, Speaker A: Uniswap doesn't really earn anything so I don't think that works. So it's actually quite limited. Right? There's only very few protocols out there that earn real cash flows that are not borrowed in marketplaces.
00:22:36.930 - 00:22:52.766, Speaker C: We're all kind of nodding our head here saying agree like we need fixed interest rate loans. In know Dows will start borrowing debt instead of just capitalizing their businesses with equity. Why hasn't this happened yet though? What's been the missing link so far in DeFi?
00:22:52.958 - 00:22:56.840, Speaker A: That's a good question. I think there's a number of things.
00:22:57.290 - 00:22:58.310, Speaker C: That have made this hard.
00:22:58.380 - 00:23:56.978, Speaker A: One is honestly liquidity mining distorted the market very significantly over the past two years. In some cases people were getting paid to borrow, right? They would earn more on their liquidity mining rewards from being a borrower than they were paying in interest. And that's just massively, massively distortive. It makes the data far less useful, it changes people's incentives. And now luckily, thankfully we are seeing poorly defined liquidity mining protocols on their way out and DeFi teams are much more sophisticated about how they're thinking about rewarding market activity. I think that is a fundamentally important thing that we need. We need more rational incentives in the market and I think that that will help drive people to express their true preferences.
00:23:56.978 - 00:24:35.922, Speaker A: Whereas right now it's mostly like there's a lot of hot money that is just there to earn liquidity mining rewards. I also think Dows as a real business entity concept is like a brand new thing. It's only like a year old. I honestly can't name that many that earn actual cash flows. So that just hasn't happened yet. I expect that it will happen. I'm quite bullish on the future of this, but it's early and it's hard for lenders to underwrite the cash flows of like Hivemapper as a Dow or helium as a Dow or something.
00:24:35.922 - 00:24:47.222, Speaker A: In this very early stage, those cash flows are either quite small or non existent. Just because these things have been around for a year, maybe two, they're just not that old.
00:24:47.276 - 00:25:22.882, Speaker C: Yeah, if this starts happening and this actually starts ramping up like debt inside of DeFi, like Dow to Dow debts, if you look at TradFi right now, you have these bonding curves, right? So governments and companies raise funds by issuing bonds at these fixed interest rates for set periods. Let's call it like a two year or five year or ten year bond. Longer lockup equals higher interest rates and vice versa forms the curve. There are no fixed maturities in DFI. So if this starts happening, are we going to start seeing these yield curves in DFI, like, where you can get a set rate for locking up ETH for five years?
00:25:22.936 - 00:26:10.094, Speaker A: Let's call it yes, I think so. And you have an approximation of this with DeFi derivatives protocols. With dated futures, you can imply an interest rate. With dated futures, you can also do this on centralized exchanges like FTX as well, and you can construct the curve there. I think what we will see is composability will lead to those curves coming together. Arbitragers will arbitrage those two in order to capture that relatively risk free or very low risk profit. So we already kind of have yield curves.
00:26:10.094 - 00:26:59.220, Speaker A: I think they could be much, much better and the markets could be much larger. But when you think about it, right now the demand for borrowing in DeFi is all about speculation, really. It's about, oh, I own a bunch of ETH and I don't want to sell it, and I need dollars to pay for my house or whatever, or oh, I own a bunch of Seoul, I don't want to sell it, let me borrow some dollars. And actually I want to go levered long. Right. That maps very well to derivatives. Actually, one theory that I have is that it's possible that borrow end has not gotten bigger in DeFi or in crypto broadly, because derivatives are such a big component of this market.
00:26:59.220 - 00:27:49.650, Speaker A: That's also why I think options may not have taken off as much as they have in traditional finance. Talk to so many options teams trying to build DeFi options on CFI, all you have is like derebit, really at any sort of very meaningful scale, and people keep looking for it to take off. And my thought is, if you're comparing to US. Equity markets, I think options volumes are really high because that is the best way for retail to get leverage. There's no perps if you're retail. Try trading on the CME and trading futures, you're not going to be allowed, right? They don't let you trade that stuff. So it's possible that Perps are the construction that eats all of this market share for speculative borrowing.
00:27:49.650 - 00:27:56.974, Speaker A: And so that might be something that's very different about crypto capital markets from traditional capital markets.
00:27:57.102 - 00:28:37.570, Speaker B: How does that impact the creation of these interest rate swap markets, right? Because my understanding, if you go back to Jason's TradFi example, let's say you go to get a 30 year fixed mortgage, you go to your bank, they say, okay, that's totally fine. And then basically they've got a whole back end network of people that will take what is essentially a levered bet on interest rates to lock in the fixed portion of your yield. I feel like, do we still need that kind of thing for crypto? And if so, is the Perp involved in that? If the Perp is what's keeping us from having deep liquid options kind of native markets. You see what I mean? How does the impact of the perpetual contract impact the creation of the interest rate swap markets?
00:28:38.790 - 00:29:11.870, Speaker A: That's an interesting question if you think about it from first principles. Actually, a perp is kind of like borrowing at a floating rate because the funding rate changes every hour. And then dated futures are like borrowing at a fixed rate because you know the price you paid at time. T. You paid price y for the future spot is worth X, so you can calculate the rate. And that's not going to change because you entered it at that point and you're not paying funding. So we have this already with derivatives.
00:29:11.870 - 00:30:15.860, Speaker A: I think having that for over collateralized loans, they're fundamentally very similar things, right? Like if I'm putting my ETH into Aave to borrow USDC to buy more ETH versus I'm putting my ETH into FTX or Perpetual Protocol or Mango and going lever, like those are kind of the same thing. So I generally am pretty bullish on derivatives markets for this stuff. I think that there is going to be a market for interest rate derivatives that will likely trade on the derivatives markets, whether that's Mango or Perp or whatever. I think that they will have interest rates markets as like one of their markets. So you can go and speculate on interest rates if you want. I think that that will make the markets more liquid and more efficient because right now it's just hard to go short rates. If I see that interest rates are really high, it's hard to go short.
00:30:15.860 - 00:30:34.870, Speaker A: How do I express a view that I think rates for lenders are going to go down over the next six months in DeFi? You can't really do that today. So I think that DeFi derivatives will probably be the way that this is traded.
00:30:35.610 - 00:31:14.740, Speaker B: I want to return to a point that we were making kind of about you made this point about yield farming distorting markets. And signals that people were able to take from markets. I want to move on to the second part of what we wanted to chat about, which was you made this really interesting point that whenever we see a new innovation in terms of how tokens are distributed, that tends to catalyze a bull run. And that has a lot to do with the cycles that we see in crypto. And you've got a lot of great historical examples in there. So can you kind of just walk us through that theory of yours? What do you mean when you say, like, innovations and how tokens are distributed and what have they kind of looked like in the past?
00:31:15.050 - 00:31:48.750, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I'm happy to walk through it. I want to caveat up front though, this is possibly a correlation, not causation thing. I can't say for certain that this is causal, but the correlation is very, very strong. If you look at the historical bull markets in crypto, 2013 bull market kicked off by the proliferation of proof of work mining coins. Bitcoin at that time was like four years old. People were like, oh yeah, this actually works, this makes sense.
00:31:48.750 - 00:32:54.242, Speaker A: And so they started making more coins, and that got everyone really excited, drew a bunch of attention and kicked off a bull market. Then 2017 was ICOs. People were like, oh, we don't need to just do proof of work coins. It's pretty environmentally wasteful and we don't need this component. What if we just pre mined the tokens and sold them? And Ethereum really kicked this off at scale with their very large pre mine and sale, which was a new capital formation method for crypto at the time, and extraordinarily successful, kicked off 2017 bull market. Then I think in 2020 we saw well before 2020, 2019, we saw the emergence of IEOs, which kicked off like a mini bull market, not that different from ICOs, other than regulatory compliance, which is a good thing, but it wasn't necessarily different enough or new enough to really kick off a bull market. It was kind of a muted bull market.
00:32:54.242 - 00:34:02.090, Speaker A: If you recall bitcoin going from like three k to twelve and then drawing back down, it did not take out its past all time highs, neither did ETH or any of the other assets. And then 2020, we saw the advent of liquidity mining first with, I think, Compound announced their liquidity mining program in June of 2020, if I recall correctly. And that was a new token distribution mechanism, new method of capital formation that got a lot of people really excited. Everyone started doing it, drove the 2020 bull market. Then I think 2021 was really driven by NFTs, I think like the second half of 2021, that was driven by consumers actually showing up and saying, oh, I want to buy this digital item. And that was a new token distribution mechanism because it was different people getting to distribute the tokens now it was creators and influencers and artists distributing these tokens. Not just like finance nerds like me, or a bunch of crypto nerds like 2017 ICOs.
00:34:02.090 - 00:34:28.986, Speaker A: And that was a new method. But it is not clear that this is entirely causal. It's possible that there is related causality here in that these new mechanisms attract attention. And the attention is actually what kicks off the bull market. Because I think we live in an attention economy that is a scarce resource of our time. So I want to be mindful of that Tijar.
00:34:29.018 - 00:34:53.740, Speaker C: I can't help but think I like the theory, but I can't help but think that these token distribution mechanisms are really just evolutions that are trying to stay ahead of users. Game theory, right? And then once the prominent game theory anticipates the distribution mechanism, the signal that you're trying to create and isolate actually becomes noise. Right? So if you think about who did Airdrops first, like Uniswap, I think.
00:34:55.870 - 00:34:56.138, Speaker B: If.
00:34:56.144 - 00:35:32.582, Speaker C: You use Retroactive Airdrops as an example, at one point in time they worked really well. But now that users know that they're coming, it becomes increasingly difficult to isolate who's like the loyal uniswap user or the loyal protocol user, and then who's just aping in from 100 different addresses who are just trying to collect a bag. So I feel like it's just interesting to see that none of these things last very long. I agree with you that all these token distribution mechanisms kick off these bull markets. I like that theory, but it's interesting to note that they all only last for like, let's call it six to twelve months.
00:35:32.716 - 00:35:54.186, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a half life on this stuff. It's almost like you have the meta of the game and then the meta has to change. Once everyone knows the meta, if everyone knows the meta, then it's not going to work. Yeah, I agree with you. This stuff has a short half life.
00:35:54.368 - 00:36:45.038, Speaker B: I think it's a good I mean, what I would also say maybe just to slightly tweak Jason, what you said is or maybe put a more positive spin. It's just like the mechanism gets refined, right? It gets refined and then retried in a way that hopefully creates more value, right? Maybe yield farming in its current iteration is a pretty expensive, pretty blunt tool, but it still worked for some protocols, right? It clearly created a lot of hype. I think Compound Right was the first one that really kicked this off. And look, there's still a blue chip project in the space, right? So maybe the next iteration of this is like instead of just, hey, here's some basically free tokens just for showing up and dumping your liquidity, we want you to do more specific tasks. Right? And then those start to look more like KPIs at a company, instead of just like, hey, do work, get equity type thing. Not that some of these things are equity, but I think it's just refining basically over a period of time.
00:36:45.124 - 00:37:01.518, Speaker C: Well, and it's just when it works really well for one company, more companies go do it. Space gets competitive and then people have to move on. No different than D to C. Companies advertising on Instagram working super well. Everyone goes to do it. Rates for ads on Instagram go up. You have to go find a new thing.
00:37:01.684 - 00:37:20.220, Speaker B: Yeah. And I know Tushara, you've got a theory about what the next mechanism is going to be. This is again a great post that you wrote on proof of physical work. So could you just talk to us a little bit about what is proof of physical work? And I know you funded like Helium, which you think is an example of this. So just kind of walk us through what that is and what that might look like in the future.
00:37:20.590 - 00:38:05.106, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. The theory here is actually very simple. The theory is you can pay people in tokens to do stuff and that stuff could be useful, right? We've been paying a lot of people with tokens to do useless stuff that doesn't create any value. Like me battling my axes doesn't really create any value for anyone. But we could pay people with tokens to do useful stuff like build a telecom network, put a bunch of hotspots all around the world to provide very inexpensive connectivity. You can do things like reward people with tokens to build a global mapping network. You can do things like reward people with tokens to build a distributed energy grid.
00:38:05.106 - 00:38:56.310, Speaker A: Right? Several of these ideas are quite compelling and what they have in common is that they create this capital asset that is created by the sum of those individual actions. Me signing up for some distributed energy thing or putting a hotspot up in my window or putting a hive map or dash cam in my car doesn't really accomplish much. I'm just a person, right? But if we can get like 100,000 people to do it or a million people to do it, that whole is worth more than the sum of its parts. And that is really the core of what I find interesting about proof of physical work is it's basically like proof of useful work. People doing something useful that creates a capital asset and it's a new form of capital formation which I think is extraordinarily compelling.
00:38:56.810 - 00:39:25.170, Speaker B: It's funny, I mean that sounds so similar to me almost just in terms of how, again, equity is used at companies. Like, equity is kind of the great incentive aligner within an organization. It's like you've got your KPIs and your KPIs and your KPIs, but really what we want to do is create equity value here. So the thing that we own goes up together. So it's funny to hear you describe useful work and then you get this thing and that's like the big incentive aligner. But I kind of feel like that's just what it is on a global scale, right?
00:39:25.320 - 00:39:59.740, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. It is similar to traditional business formation, but the difference here is there are different trust properties which allow the system to scale much larger. If you think about it, there's only like three entities in the US. That employ more than a million people. I think it's like the post office, the military, and Walmart or something like that. There's a limit to how big these corporations can get in terms of coordinating people. But there's a million hotspots on Helium already.
00:39:59.740 - 00:40:31.670, Speaker A: There can be 10 million very easily because there's a structured coordination with some trust minimized properties to it. So I think this is like the next generation evolution of this type of capital formation because it reduces friction. It is global from day one. It has some of these very nice trust minimized properties. And I think that it just is much more inclusive and gives more people access to participate than traditional rails.
00:40:32.810 - 00:41:05.282, Speaker C: I just want to make sure I understand. Do you think the next bull market will either get kicked off with this or will be a big theme in the next bull market? This infrastructure networks that are driven by thousands, then hundreds of thousands, then eventually millions of people doing some sort of physical work, like with Hivemapper taking videos, or with Helium setting up their hotspots, or with filecoin are we sharing file storage? That's what you think. That's one of the big themes and narratives or use cases of the next bull market.
00:41:05.416 - 00:41:55.650, Speaker A: I think so. I would expand that slightly to also include useful digital work, right? The work doesn't need to be entirely physical. You can have useful digital work. Like for example, we invested in a company called Delphia, which is a datadao. The idea is basically a user can go sign up and connect their Amazon account for their Amazon data, their Morgan account for their financial data, their Google account for their search data, and so on and so forth. And Delphia collects all that information, joins tables together, and then uses that to train machine learning models that can predict asset prices because they can do something like say like, oh Jason, you're such an influencer. Every time you talk about a product, turns out all your friends buy it, right? And then that company goes and beats earnings.
00:41:56.790 - 00:41:57.780, Speaker C: That's me.
00:42:01.590 - 00:42:04.050, Speaker A: This is some useful work as well.
00:42:04.200 - 00:42:04.610, Speaker B: Right?
00:42:04.680 - 00:42:46.314, Speaker A: Because the useful work here, the capital asset that you are creating is this large database of data sets that could not have been created otherwise, right? Like you can buy some alternative data, but you can't join the tables together easily. You're buying it anonymized, if you could join them together, that'd be quite a failure of Anonymization. And some of this data is just not even available for sale. Like LinkedIn doesn't sell some of this data, but knowing who is moving from what company to another company could be extraordinarily predictive but you just can't get this data right now, right? So yeah, I think it's more like proof of useful work than just physical work.
00:42:46.372 - 00:43:18.140, Speaker C: I've actually been pretty skeptical about the Solana phone. I will admit to Shar, I know you guys are big factors of Solana, but something just clicked, which is a lot of this is verifying physical work. And if you take a phone, a crypto native phone, your phone has more data on you than anything out there right now. And a lot of that data can be going back into verifying these proof of physical work networks. I don't know if I'm sure you guys are light years ahead of me on that, but that just clicked for me.
00:43:19.070 - 00:43:55.334, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. That's entirely right. I do want to comment on the Solana phone briefly. When they told me first about the idea, I was like, you're crazy. You're going to go compete against Apple and Google and build a guys like, let's pull over the bus here and have a conversation. Right? But then I started talking to them and just like, thinking from first principles, like, what were they trying to accomplish? And I think the core of what they're trying to do is say key management should not be an application level thing. It should be at the operating system level.
00:43:55.334 - 00:45:14.638, Speaker A: The fact that I have a Chrome extension that I use to sign transactions is just like, inherently unsafe because the key is being stored in a user accessible part of the computer. The same thing is true on mobile, right? Like, if you've used MetaMask on mobile, it's a pretty atrocious experience and intrinsically insecure because the key is being stored somewhere that the user or the file system can access it. And so the really key innovation in my mind about Saga and Solana mobile stack is creating the norm that an application throws an unsigned message to the operating system, and it's the operating system's job to figure out how to sign it. Now, specifically with the Solana system, they're going to have a secure enclave, so the private key will live in that secure enclave. Private key is never exposed to the outside world. You're able to pass a message in, sign that message, and then pass a message out and then broadcast it, which is basically the same security that you have with a ledger wallet or a treasure wallet or any other hardware wallet, which is the gold standard. And I think we need to solve key management before we can get mainstream users on.
00:45:14.638 - 00:45:34.950, Speaker A: My mom's never going to write down twelve words. It's just not going to happen. Or if she does, she's going to write them on a plain piece of paper and leave it on the dresser or something. Right. Mainstream users are not going to do this easily. Right. So I think building that into the operating system that everyone already uses is extremely compelling.
00:45:34.950 - 00:45:55.630, Speaker A: I would consider the Solana mobile phone successful if it influences the current mobile phone manufacturers to do this, it doesn't need to sell a ton of units or take over or like dethrone Apple or anything, it just needs to get them to make signing crypto transactions a first class citizen.
00:45:56.930 - 00:46:58.654, Speaker B: I was going to say actually the reason why what you were describing before at proof of physical work sounded cool to me. I find it very cool when crypto actually translates and starts influencing things in the real world similar to what the internet did, right? Like a really small example of that on the internet is when menus at restaurants they started printing in a way or like when a restaurant would create something that was really instagrammable. So you had the internet world influencing the real world and that maybe started to happen in crypto a little bit with just asics and miners in general, but this would be kind of the whole next evolution of that, honestly with the phone. So I'm rooting for it as well. But I know we're drawing low on time here, and I want to try to connect these two distinct conversations that we're having and get your opinion kind of on our thesis here, which is, if you look at a lot of these innovations in distribution that you're talking about, these are really about getting tokens in the hand of people. And that looks to me similar to some form of equity financing. Right, you are especially like with ICOs, what they were doing is they were bootstrapping growth by selling future.
00:46:58.654 - 00:47:39.326, Speaker B: It wasn't really that clear but something like ownership in the network, right? So that looks to me like kind of a form of equity financing. So there are examples in TradFi of these equity financing bubbles that happened, right, all the way from the.com bubble that has an equity financing driven bubble to the South Sea bubble all the way back when. But also what happens in TradFi is debt driven bubbles. That's a big thing too, right? And you had recent examples again in 2008 CDOs that kind of caused this huge glut for debt around the housing market and that resulted in this big boom and then bust. But again back in the 80s too with Mike Milk and the creation of a whole new asset class around junk bonds. So debt also drives these bubbles as well.
00:47:39.326 - 00:47:57.858, Speaker B: So I guess my question to you and maybe knitting together these two themes is do you ever see debt being a big part in the catalyzation of a new bull market? And if so, do you think that the ability to borrow at a fixed rate will unlock or create kind of that rush?
00:47:58.034 - 00:48:52.230, Speaker A: That is a very interesting question. That's a fascinating thought process to combine those two things. I would say it's possible that we have had a debt fueled bubble in crypto already. I don't think it was in DeFi, I think it was in CFI. It was things like Celsius and Genesis and Babel lending under collateralized to groups like Three Arrows. And really these things all share something in common, which is someone borrows money or raises money, prices go up, they use that money to buy assets and then that encourages more people to lend money or to invest in the equity like layer. And that runs like a reflexive cycle.
00:48:52.230 - 00:49:15.738, Speaker A: So, yes, I do think that there is a real chance that fixed Rate lending or Dow to Dow Lending is the next big new capital source, especially within DeFi, and it could trigger a bull market. I think that's a valid thesis.
00:49:15.914 - 00:49:38.100, Speaker B: Awesome. All right, Tushar, you've been super generous with your time, I guess. Any closing questions? Jason or Tushar, anything else that you wanted? Right. By the way, the blog, I'll give you guys a plug here. The blog on multicoin site is like a goldmine of great information. So I want to plug some of the work that you produce. But any just closing thoughts, I guess on anything that we've talked about or might want to still talk about.
00:49:39.350 - 00:50:05.486, Speaker A: Yeah, I would just know we like sharing our thoughts, podcasts, blog posts, Twitter, et cetera. One of the main reasons why we like sharing our thoughts is we learn from the audience. Often they come back and they tell us what we're wrong about or what we missed. So I want to encourage the audience. If you think I'm wrong about something, I would love to hear that. I do not mind being wrong in public at all. That's actually my favorite way to learn.
00:50:05.668 - 00:50:23.460, Speaker C: Tushar, I have something that we haven't talked about yet. I want to wrap this up. Sorry, Mike, I know you wanted to wrap this, but Stablecoins just all these protocols, curve, Ave, they're launching their own stables. Right? Just I know it's not really about the two top related to the two topics Mike wanted to talk about, but I got to get your take on that.
00:50:23.910 - 00:50:55.150, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I have an interesting take on that. I think, or hopefully it's differentiated. I think that these things are directly competitive and they're going to converge. Ave and Maker are the same protocol. Actually they're doing the same thing. So is Curve actually Ave, Maker, Curve all do the same thing, which is if you think about it from the jobs to be done perspective, the jobs to be done here are I have some assets and I want to earn yield on it or I want to borrow.
00:50:55.730 - 00:50:57.918, Speaker C: Yeah, those are it.
00:50:58.004 - 00:51:34.730, Speaker A: Those are the two jobs. Maker is I want to borrow, aave is I want to earn yield or I want to borrow. Curve is I want to get some yield. Right. And so I think you can have economies of scale by combining them all. That's why I think Ave launching their own stablecoin is fantastic. I think this is a really interesting move and I would not be surprised in the future to see Ave launch a stable swap protocol as well, where the assets that you have deposited into the Aave borrowing protocol could also be used for stable swap for some incremental yield for you.
00:51:34.730 - 00:51:51.962, Speaker A: And by having those assets available for both, you will earn more yield. There's economies of scale to combining this stuff together. So my expectation is over the long run, we will see stable swap, borrow and stablecoins kind of converge into one protocol.
00:51:52.106 - 00:51:57.458, Speaker C: Yeah, it feels like in CFI we saw all of these. You had like, lend and borrow platforms, then you had the wallets and then.
00:51:57.464 - 00:51:58.254, Speaker B: You had the exchanges.
00:51:58.302 - 00:52:23.834, Speaker C: And then over a couple of years, they all kind of converged into these crypto native banks. DeFi. You're seeing everything converge into whether you start as like a lender or like an AMM or a stablecoin, everyone eventually builds an AMM, a lend and borrow platform and a stablecoin. And I've heard Sam from Fracs call that the holy trinity of DeFi, which is obviously a nice sexy name on it, but it does feel like that's starting to play out now. Yeah, we'll see.
00:52:23.872 - 00:52:37.790, Speaker B: Absolutely. All right, guys. Tushar, I love what you said about liking to be wrong in public. That is the entire theme of this show as well. Jason Naher. Confined to the middle of the bell curve. Tell us why we're wrong, why you agree or don't agree with this thesis.
00:52:37.790 - 00:52:45.182, Speaker B: So I thought that was just really well said. Tushar, honestly, it's been a fascinating conversation. Thanks so much for coming on. We'll have to do it again soon.
00:52:45.236 - 00:52:46.740, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you for having me.
00:52:47.910 - 00:52:58.286, Speaker B: That was a lot of fun, man. Tushar well, first of all, he just schooled us. We are so proud of this creation with the bell curve. And he completely schooled us on the actual bell curve.
00:52:58.318 - 00:52:58.574, Speaker C: Meme.
00:52:58.622 - 00:53:04.994, Speaker B: Tushar right after we finished recording, he was like, I love that. Meme, whenever I find myself in the middle of the bell curve, I always go to the left. It's easier.
00:53:05.042 - 00:53:09.686, Speaker C: Always go to the left, baby. Never go to the right of the bell curve. Never go to the right of the bell curve.
00:53:09.718 - 00:53:10.300, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:53:11.150 - 00:53:15.098, Speaker C: If Tushar is saying you go to the left, I feel better about myself.
00:53:15.184 - 00:53:17.980, Speaker B: I got a win of the left. What's left of the left.
00:53:19.230 - 00:53:19.894, Speaker A: Full circle.
00:53:19.942 - 00:53:20.714, Speaker B: I'll end up on the right.
00:53:20.752 - 00:53:26.118, Speaker C: Just take your just basically don't allocate to crypto is left. To the left. Yeah, you're done. Seriously, just hang up.
00:53:26.144 - 00:53:26.686, Speaker B: I agree.
00:53:26.788 - 00:53:28.590, Speaker C: So what did you think of the episode?
00:53:29.010 - 00:53:56.134, Speaker B: I thought it was really good. I mean, I thought it was really good. It was kind of an ambitious episode because we went in and tried to unite these two very different thoughts. Not going to lie, I was a little worried he was going to be like, that is really stupid. But I'm glad we ended on a high note. I had a lot of takeaways from what he was saying. First of all, I didn't understand the importance of the perpetual contract and how I mean I know that's widely used in crypto in general but I hadn't actually thought about that.
00:53:56.134 - 00:54:06.342, Speaker B: It's its own kind of variable funding rate mechanism and how that might actually impact the development of decentralized options. So I thought that was a pretty big takeaway for me, honestly.
00:54:06.406 - 00:54:26.080, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a good point. I mean perps what the funding rate is reset every I think it's every hour. So yeah, that was a good point. I mean he seems to agree with the fact that Dow to Dow Credit Growth will be just a massive driver of capital in the next bull market, which you and me have talked a lot about.
00:54:26.610 - 00:54:54.026, Speaker B: We've got a full episode dedicated to that later in the season. I also thought that was a big surprise because I didn't think that he would come right out and say or be as bullish on that as you and I were on that topic. I always viewed within this thesis kind of like that was one of the because the big question is like where's the borrow going to come from? Right? Who wants to issue the debt in the first place in a DeFi native way? So Dows are like one answer to that. But he was really bullish on that as a use case, which I thought was super mean.
00:54:54.048 - 00:55:05.786, Speaker C: I think he literally said Dow Credit Growth is the most interesting thing in DeFi right now. So there was something that he said that I didn't understand at the beginning about neo banks being the supply side of this debt.
00:55:05.818 - 00:55:51.526, Speaker B: Demand banks are basically like distribution, right? So someone else creates the products, like a financial product like that. Like let's say it's a 30 year fixed mortgage and then banks and the brokerages that are a part of the banks are the distribution mechanism for those things. So actually Matt Levine was the one who first made me understand this a while ago. But if you think about brokerages as like an investment store and you the investor, you're like, I want to earn money and the brokerage is like here, here are all these different financial products for you to either earn money or buy a house or do whatever it is. So that's why a neo bank would be they'd be like the distributor in a sense. They'd be distribution mechanism for the financial product which is fixed borrow lend. Does that make actually he mentioned SushiSwap.
00:55:51.526 - 00:56:50.634, Speaker B: So I actually want to quote from the blog post that Tushar wrote because I thought that was really good. This is what he actually said and a specific example. We predict that many Dows, such as Dows that manage risk in large DFI protocols and NFT platforms will pursue debt financing. Imagine a world in which the Sushi swap Dow can borrow funds from a variable rate lending protocol and encode logic that says we will redirect 10% of our revenues from our staked ex Sushi to repay the loan. This would expose the Sushi swap dow to interest rate risk from the variable rate protocol and they could use IR swaps to hedge it. I think the cool thing in there and this is something that you couldn't necessarily do it's very common in TradFi to do borrowing against future cash flows but what you can't do is kind of a promise of hey, if you have those cash flows the hope is that that will go to pay the debt. But what you can actually do with something like Sushi where it's written in the code what their take rate? Basically you can direct funds that comes from their take rate into repaying this loan.
00:56:50.634 - 00:57:01.300, Speaker B: So actually it removes a whole layer of risk when you're underwriting a loan which should allow you to offer lower interest rates and then that's more capital efficient at the end of the day which is pretty cool.
00:57:01.830 - 00:57:36.110, Speaker C: It is cool. Yeah, it is cool. It's very cool. I do know what you mean. Yeah lower rates will be what propels, I think DeFi lend and borrow into the mainstream. I think if there's no overhead and the maker team obviously talks about this all the time same with Ave and Compound. If there's just much less overhead to offer these rates they can continually offer lower and lower rates than what traditional capital markets and TradFi offers.
00:57:36.110 - 00:57:39.040, Speaker C: But I think that Sushi thing is really interesting.
00:57:39.410 - 00:58:03.702, Speaker B: Here's the other thing that I loved his conclusion at the end, where he was like, I think we've already seen the debt bulb. And actually, it's funny, I didn't even think of this when we were coming up with the thesis, but yeah, basically, what has driven a lot of this last cycle was all this uncollateralized borrowing that was going on largely in the form of three AC. Right? But yeah, I guess that actually was an enormous amount of the demand that all of.
00:58:03.836 - 00:58:12.086, Speaker C: I hadn't thought about that either. We've been in a debt bubble. This was the debt bubble. It's already happening. Shit. The season's over.
00:58:12.188 - 00:58:13.154, Speaker B: Season's over, baby.
00:58:13.202 - 00:58:15.066, Speaker C: Yeah, but I thought that was a.
00:58:15.088 - 00:58:45.300, Speaker B: Really interesting point that he had as well. I don't know, I liked his whole thesis about new distribution mechanisms kicking off bull markets. I thought it was a good I haven't heard him give that caveat before like oh, this could be correlation instead of causation. And I totally agree but I also think I don't know, it seems pretty compelling to me. I'd be pretty interesting if his proof of physical work use case ended up playing out because Helium is great, it's a great company.
00:58:45.910 - 00:58:50.918, Speaker C: Yeah and Hive Mapper, anything else from the app?
00:58:51.004 - 00:59:48.066, Speaker B: No, I think just for folks who are going to be tuning in so next week's episode we're going to be getting even more. Into the weeds on fixed rate protocols because we kind of talked a little bit with Tushar at a high level of what fixed rate lending unlocks. But next we're going to be getting really into the weeds with it and talking about what some of the mechanisms are that works and then some of the additional structured products that gets laddered on to fixed rate lending. Right. So just to give everyone, like a super concrete understanding of why the increase fixed rate expands the market compared to variable, you can think of a 30 year fixed mortgage as like the golden child example of how markets can be grown from variable to fix because how many people would borrow to fund their house? Basically, if your interest rate was super variable. Actually, we can see what happens when people get in trouble with that, right? That's what basically caused the mortgage crisis. But the ability to take out a mortgage at a fixed rate was a huge unlock.
00:59:48.066 - 01:00:02.220, Speaker B: And that's actually a consumer product, not just like a so I think what we're going to talk next week about is what some of those additional structured products that might be that leverage the ability to borrow at a fixed rate. Like, what are some of those specific unlocks, I think, which is going to be cool.
01:00:02.830 - 01:00:15.760, Speaker C: One thing I want to get out of the next episode is just talking about Libor. Like a lot of interest rates in traditional markets are set around Libor. What is the Libor equivalent in DeFi? Unless you already have an answer for that.
01:00:16.290 - 01:01:06.298, Speaker B: I just think we need some contract or some concept of the risk free rate. Right? You were talking about that lending curve, which I thought was a really good explanation, but we need like all valuation happens relative to something else. That's why we have our risk free rate, which is basically the ten year treasury in the world and everything else goes off of the yield curve or the risk curve as opposed to the rate that you can earn on a ten year. So we just don't really have that in crypto. There's a theory of what that might be, but I agree that's what we need to find out. And then the last thing, which is just the one thing I would flag to people following along for why this thesis might be wrong, I actually have and nothing has really disconfirmed it at this point, that I think there's a good chance that this is right. I think the biggest thing that you and I need to be teasing out around is timing because this fixed rate lending is definitely going to happen in DeFi.
01:01:06.298 - 01:01:27.110, Speaker B: It's definitely going to be a big unlock. But I think the thing that I'm the least sure about at the current moment is when this is going to happen. Is it going to be this bull cycle, the next bull cycle after that. So we should give some thought into these next couple of interviews about trying to parse out how far along fixed rate lending really is. And is it likely to be like a this cycle thing or next cycle? Yeah.
01:01:27.180 - 01:01:28.950, Speaker C: Good plug, good plug.
01:01:30.090 - 01:01:31.846, Speaker B: All right, partner. It's been fun.
01:01:31.948 - 01:01:32.930, Speaker C: Shall we? Cheers.
