00:00:00.480 - 00:00:18.574, Speaker A: Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon. If you're calling from Europe, good evening. Calling from Asia. My name is Arno Simre. I am the head of growth and partnership at Dune. We are super excited to welcome you for the first ever Solana and Dune live webinar.
00:00:18.574 - 00:00:57.178, Speaker A: So the topic of the day is very simple. It's all going to be about Solana data analytics. And to dive into the subject, we put an amazing set of Solana data experts. We have Shashank Unial from the data team at the Solana foundation. We have Lucas Broder, co founder and CTO of GTO Labs. Andrew Hong, developer, relation headmaster at Dune, and Dune, CEO and co founder, Frederick Aga. Before we get started, we have a special guest, the man that probably doesn't need a lot of introduction, Anatolia Yakovenko, co founder of Solana.
00:00:57.178 - 00:01:01.310, Speaker A: Thanks for dropping for us for a few minutes to say hi. How's it going?
00:01:01.850 - 00:01:03.670, Speaker B: That's good. Thanks for having me.
00:01:04.290 - 00:01:14.802, Speaker A: Of course, of course. So, just to break the ass and get started, I always like to ask, so it's morning for you on the west coast time. Like, what is your morning routine usually on your side?
00:01:14.986 - 00:01:51.180, Speaker B: Well, I've got three kids, so I usually try to wake up around five or six because it gives me like an hour where they're still asleep. Hopefully doesn't always happen. So I usually wake up pretty early, drink my coffee, start answering emails or writing, like, design docs. Usually, like, if I'm like, feel like, creative, I'm doing. I don't ignore all comps and emails and just start working on some doc. If I'm not feeling creative, I like, go through the. Through all my emails.
00:01:52.520 - 00:02:23.538, Speaker A: Got it? Yeah. I mean, the morning, they say it's the best time to get the flow going. So we have thousands of people listening to us. We have people coming from the Solana ecosystem, the dune community. And I think we have this exciting partnership between our two organizations for a few years. And on the dude side, we made tremendous improvement to make crypto data accessible specifically for the Solana ecosystem. Maybe take a minute or two to walk us through this.
00:02:23.538 - 00:02:45.140, Speaker A: Last year, 2023. As we say in crypto, one year in crypto is five years in the real world. But if you think about where we were in the aftermath of unique event last November and all the exciting things that have come up of your side of the house, to walk us through that journey of the last twelve months.
00:02:46.320 - 00:03:18.130, Speaker B: Yeah, it's definitely been crazy year. Like, emotionally, it was like a for sure roller coaster. I think, like, everyone remembers like last, I kind of don't think of it in terms of New Year's breakpoint is my, like, end of the year. The last breakpoint ended on like a horrible down note with like, the allegations coming out from FTX and then learning about like, how much of that stuff was true. It was like, you know, like a stab in the back or a bad breakup. I don't know if you ever had to go through.
00:03:19.750 - 00:03:20.934, Speaker A: Sadly, I did.
00:03:21.062 - 00:04:01.490, Speaker B: Yeah. It's basically like a really bad breakup. But like, what was weird is that like, basically there was like nothing we could do at labs or foundation. It was such a, such a shit show. And like, the main thing that I was worried about is like, how many ecosystem companies got screwed with their assets on FTX or Runway. And luckily it was small percentage of them that had anything on there. And out of the ones that got hit, it was like folks like Star Atlas and Armani and a lot of founders, you get into fight or flight response when something horrible happens.
00:04:01.490 - 00:04:57.418, Speaker B: And founders, I think more likely to fight and you could see their brains turning, fuck this, I'm going to work. We don't have enough money, but we can still work harder. That was like their response and both of them, I think, I don't know. If that didn't happen, would we have seen the kind of product development and iteration out of our money that we saw over the year? So bittersweet is that it really put a fire under a lot of the founders in the ecosystem and they shipped and built awesome products like Lucas included. And like, I think this is why the ecosystem is having so much attention is because folks like Lucas, like PiF, like Armani, like they built really, really good products over the year and they iterated. And even though like, it was a bear market that just made the products better and better, you know, their customers like, loved them. And now you're seeing that turnaround.
00:04:57.418 - 00:05:10.750, Speaker B: So, like, that was really like, know, the year that the ecosystem really took off, you know, like in a way just well beyond what I could even possibly track, let alone manage.
00:05:11.690 - 00:05:30.890, Speaker A: And what do you think was probably different, you know, obviously different context for this year. If you think about, you know, this DeFi 2.0 specifically, like, you know, jitto great example versus probably what was the type of project that you were seeing maybe a year from now? Like, what are some of the differences that you've seen coming out of Solana?
00:05:31.050 - 00:06:21.420, Speaker B: I think previous cycle we saw a lot of copying from Ethereum like amms and stuff like this. And now this cycle we're seeing really unique applications that found that sweet spot of optimizations that are unique on Solana. So Jupyter's one, I think Phoenix is a really, really good central limit order book that really demonstrates capital efficiency orders of magnitude better than anything else in crypto. So that's really, really cool to see. Jito is the way that Solana staking is designed, I don't think is only possible on Solana. I think Ethereum could copy it, but at least we, I think, did it better on Solana. So stake pools combined with mev optimizations, it just makes so much sense.
00:06:21.420 - 00:07:19.796, Speaker B: So seeing Jito do that is really, really cool. So, yeah, I think Jupyter is my prime example, because I think there's nothing wrong with what Ethereum is building. I think it's a cool design and it's Pareto efficient, but it is creating this asynchronous separated state machines that have asynchronous dependencies between them and have to settle through the layer one. That's all super cool, but it's very, very different than a single giant chunk of memory that's replicated globally with a single computer that runs it. You see that in Jupyter specifically because Jupyter can take a 20 cent trade and route it through four different markets, because that gives you the optimal price. You just can't do that in an asynchronous machine. In an asynchronous system, those delays and latencies and fees are all going to make it not as efficient.
00:07:19.796 - 00:07:35.880, Speaker B: And it's really cool to see those separate and start to see Jupyter only possible on Solana. I'm looking forward to folks finding more of those little clever optimizations and niches and then seeing if they scale up.
00:07:37.140 - 00:08:12.210, Speaker A: Got it. So a lot of exciting things coming up. Solana, definitely this year I had some amazing feedback from your last breck, born in Amsterdam. I think the energy was high. I think you outlined a lot of that. I wanted to ask about your take on Warren's AML bill, but I think I know the answer to that, so I'll skip this one. But what do you think in terms of regulation and what's happening? How do we entangle, or what do you think is going to happen? Over in DC.
00:08:13.950 - 00:08:57.162, Speaker B: Us has the worst government, except for all the other ones. So democracy is a slow moving beast, and you can see democracy working better in smaller countries in Europe. But if you try to scale it to a very large landmass with lots of diverse, like, very, very diverse number of people, that are all, like, different interests and stuff. It kind of slows down a bit. And I think, as usual, us, there's plenty of smart people in Congress, plenty of people that are less smart and more, like, selfish, I would say. But, like, over the long term, the government does the right thing. So, like, there's two bills that are working through Congress.
00:08:57.162 - 00:09:52.180, Speaker B: The fit market structure bill that fit 21 is, like, really promising. If that passes, I think crypto would be much, much easier for us founders to go build companies and, like, issue tokens and just go, like, go full growth mode and similar with a stablecoin bill. I think if that one passes, you should see every financial company issue a stable coin. And that's going to be really that tipping point where you start seeing, like, APIs for banks are like wrappers of people in fax machines right now, but once they can issue stable coins, it'll really be software eating finance. And once that happens, I think you'll see a massive tipping point of next fintech 2.0s that are all crypto based. So basically waiting for that.
00:09:52.180 - 00:10:05.200, Speaker B: I think it'll happen eventually, if not within this two year cycle, then the next one. You know, it's a self correcting problem because all the opposition is over 70 years old.
00:10:05.900 - 00:10:14.260, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I was looking. The average age of senator, Congressman is like 69, which, you know, maybe doesn't.
00:10:14.300 - 00:10:26.440, Speaker B: Help, but, yeah, basically everyone below 70 is like, yeah, okay, this is a technology. Let's go adopt it. Everyone above 70 is, like, freaking out. So it'll happen eventually.
00:10:27.630 - 00:10:48.622, Speaker A: So a lot of hopefully development, let's put it this way, coming for 2024. And so before we kick off the webinar and talk about Solana data atlantics, maybe last thoughts for you and Natalie, like, excite us a little bit. What's coming to Solana in 2024? Like, give us a little tease of finance. What you were seeing coming, it's not.
00:10:48.646 - 00:11:19.370, Speaker B: A, it's all public. It's all being built in the public. It's a really, really cool project. I can't talk enough about it. It's a team at a jump. A bunch of folks that have built high frequency trading systems before that have built systems that handle 400 gigabits worth of real time streaming data. You guys in the data business understand how hard it is to do that and being able to make decisions on that data within nanoseconds for trade.
00:11:19.370 - 00:12:18.116, Speaker B: They have built entire pipelines for this, and they have a deep understanding of systems engineering. And when we talked to them about building Solana they were like, oh, yeah, this seems like, obviously it should work. We should be able to scale this as high as network bandwidth allows. And that, to me, is, like, very, very huge validation of the Solana design. And this idea that it is possible for us to have a single giant, replicated state machine around the world that synchronizes at the speed of light, that's giving everybody fair reads and fair rights, and that, in my mind, will revolutionize trading and finance and a lot of things, because now everyone is on the same level playing field. Every hobbyist in the world is on the same level playing field as jump, as Citadel, as whatever. There's no more, like, yeah, there is no centralized entities that are giving some people preferential access and some not.
00:12:18.116 - 00:12:47.210, Speaker B: So it's really, really cool to see them make progress. It's on testnet already. It's called Franken dancer, so it's running some of their network stack. But Solana is state processing engine, and they're making a ton of headway in the state processing side. I think, last I've checked, they can do, like, five. Like, they've done 500 blocks in a row and then, like, finds a bug. So, like, it's getting closer to them being able to run a full state verification.
00:12:47.210 - 00:13:18.020, Speaker B: So that I'm excited about that. I'm also internally, like, I feel like we have, like, a very diverse group of core devs now, and I want to, like, get them all aligned on one big push, whether it's, like, asynchronous execution or concurrent leaders or whatever. I think over this year, the next year, my goal is to get them. Here's one dock. It's five changes that we all need to land at the same time. Let's just power through it.
00:13:19.520 - 00:13:48.586, Speaker A: That would be exciting. Well, it sounds like a lot of exciting things coming out of Solana. I think this partnership with doing overseas, one of the way we make more transparency in the Solana data so people can have the truth about the ecosystem. So we'll let you go. Anatoly, thank you so much for this quick chat. You know, I'm already re energized for the day and for what's coming in the webinar. And, yeah, let's try to do this next year after break point in Singapore and see where we at.
00:13:48.738 - 00:13:50.098, Speaker B: Okay, great.
00:13:50.234 - 00:13:51.322, Speaker A: All right, thanks.
00:13:51.386 - 00:13:52.190, Speaker B: See you guys.
00:13:52.690 - 00:14:12.200, Speaker A: All right. What a way to kick off this webinar by the man who literally co founded in built Solana back in 2017. All right, let's get to it. I'm going to go off camera. I'll be in the back because I do also want to learn more about what you guys come up with. Andrew, the floor is yours.
00:14:12.580 - 00:14:46.436, Speaker C: Cool, thank you. Arno, let me go ahead and share my screen. All right, now we're diving into the meat of it. We'll skip over intros again, but for today, we're just going to given an overview of the slant ecosystem, a little more in depth. We're going to cover a little bit about what's going on in Jitto and Jito soul, and then we're going to move into. How do you actually understand transactions? Work with tokens, accounts, transfers and balances. It's going to be very hands on.
00:14:46.436 - 00:14:51.440, Speaker C: I'm going to pass it over to Shashank to tell us more about the ecosystem.
00:14:53.100 - 00:15:02.382, Speaker D: Sounds good. All right. Hello, everyone. Thanks for being here. I'm Shashank. I lead our data initiatives at the Solana foundation. I've been in the ecosystem for about two and a half years.
00:15:02.382 - 00:15:27.752, Speaker D: So, like, I've been through the highs and lows, so, like, good time to be in the Solana system, I guess. All right, so let's start with the network itself. I totally touched on a lot of this, but just going to go over it real quick. Okay, so Solana is known for, like, being fast and cheap. All right, Solana is known for being fast and cheap. It is one of the cheapest blockchains out there. So transacting a Solana would cost you about $0.001,
00:15:27.752 - 00:15:52.400, Speaker D: which is fairly low, and do tons of transactions to the user, not have to worry about fees. Fastest TPS transactions perspective can go up to 65k, but today's average is about four k. And that's just dependent block space. Also, it is one of the most decentralized blockchains. So we have about 2.1k validators. And that brings the Nakamoto coefficient to about 22, which is high.
00:15:52.400 - 00:16:32.860, Speaker D: So, yeah, what does this mean as a user? As a user, it means that you can do a lot of transactions on Solana and not have to worry about gas. And they settle very fast as well. So, like, sending USDC from here to say, China would take milliseconds. If you're a developer, it means that you can build very unique products on Solana. So, as Toli was mentioning, you can build order books, you can build, you can mint a million nfps for a couple hundred bucks, like a drip has done about 50 million nfts, compressed nfts. And then you can build games like Star Atlas, which do more transactions than other blockchains. So again, you can build very scalable dapps on Solana.
00:16:32.860 - 00:17:23.020, Speaker D: And I think good tech always attracts good developers. Moving on, we have about two k plus open source developers, and this doesn't track closed source, so we're still under counting, but two k is still a very high number. And to actually put everything into perspective for the year, I think this chart of the next metric I'm talking about is 90 day retention of developers. So this essentially tells you after FTX there were people who just were like, screw this, I'm going to keep building. And this is exactly what that chart tells you. I think it's one of the most important metrics to track in the ecosystem right now. And you can see how we started about like 37, which is also very high, but we're about to over 40, 50 in September.
00:17:23.020 - 00:17:46.386, Speaker D: So yeah, this is like one of my favorite metrics out there. And then Hackathon. So not only are we retaining developers, we're also bringing in new developers. So the most recent hackathon hyperdrive, we had about 907 developers that submitted for hackathon. That is like the all time high that we had for hackathons. So again, very, I would say the developer ecosystem in Solana is doing great. It's flourishing.
00:17:46.386 - 00:18:16.270, Speaker D: I personally work with a lot of developers and I think it's one of the best out there. And that brings me to community. So, like, these developers are building very good. Dapps. I'm going to talk about retention of power users first and then super team. So essentially what happened over the year is you would still see the daily active users number go down, but retention is still high, so you're still retaining power users. And what these power users have done is like give good feedback to the developers to build a better product.
00:18:16.270 - 00:18:55.190, Speaker D: So what we're seeing now is like the feedback loop of power users to developers and just improvement in products. So I think that's like one of the best things that's happened over the past year. And then we have initiatives like super team, which are pretty organic. They're in over ten plus countries. It's a group of people just building on Solana, and it's artists, it's content creators, it's developers just contributing to the ecosystem and they've earned about $2.5 million in contributions. And again, just contributing to the ecosystem and making money and keeping that whole cycle going.
00:18:55.190 - 00:19:20.490, Speaker D: So, yeah, to close it out, I feel like the combination of good tech, which is the network, great developers and a great community is like the Solana ecosystem. And like, this is one of the best places to work at. And just the community is fun, too. So if you want to be involved, like, I highly recommend, even as a developer or community member. Yeah, that's my Solana ecosystem overview. Andrew, go for it.
00:19:20.870 - 00:19:37.150, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you, Shashank. Next, going to jump over to Lucas. Just talk a little bit about Jitto. Jitto has been involved at the validator level with Mev, at the liquid staking level, at the defi level. Just let Lucas talk about it and see what he's excited about.
00:19:37.810 - 00:20:14.680, Speaker E: Hey, yeah, thanks for having me. I'm the co founder and CEO at Jito Labs and also a contributor to Jito network. We built the Jito Solana validator client. It's an open source validator client that basically enables more profitable and efficient blocks for the Solana network. So it's running on like 43% of stake right now across more than 300 validators. We're also, as I mentioned, contributors to the Jito network and Jito network. One of the products there is Jito Sol, a liquid staking token.
00:20:14.680 - 00:20:54.030, Speaker E: Liquid staking. We think it's very early in the Solana ecosystem and I think there's a lot of potential there. And we've definitely seen a lot of growth on Jitosol and I Sol and some of the other liquid staking tokens recently. And yeah, I guess the thing about Jito soul, it's mainly the main advantages there are the liquidity defi integrations and the valid air set. And yeah, I've been working a lot with Andrew and bothering him a lot, asking to make us dashboard. So super excited to be on here and learn more. What's going on with the dune in Solana?
00:20:55.430 - 00:21:35.288, Speaker C: Cool. Yeah, all of our queries and learning today is going to be based off of Geodosil, so you're going to get a lot more familiar. But thank you, Lucas. All right, so I hope everyone has had fun just relaxing and hearing about all the cool things in ecosystem. Now comes the harder part. I'm going to try and take everyone through. How do you understand this stuff that you see on the right, all these transactions and instructions and these concepts on the left? And then I'm also going to walk through the creation of two query getting all jitosol mints and burns on a weekly basis and also getting the top Jito Soul holders.
00:21:35.288 - 00:22:17.486, Speaker C: It's going to be a lot of content you might get lost, especially if you don't know any SQL or blockchain data. I'll say we do have a Q and a box, you can ask questions into the box, and then after I go through the queries, I will take as much time as we need, whether that's ten minutes, 30 minutes, and try and answer people's questions. So without further ado, let me go into this view mode. So basics of a transaction. We're going to go to the explorer in a second, and you can kind of see something going on over here. But there's four sets of concepts you have to learn. First one's easy block slot is just the number in which this transaction happened.
00:22:17.486 - 00:22:40.130, Speaker C: In. The second concept is a signer. There can be multiple signers, but I would just simplify and think of it as there is someone who's paying the fee to execute a transaction. Instructions gets more complex. Accounts also gets more complex. So we're just going to jump over to one of my favorite block explorers, Solana FM. And here there's a transaction hash or transaction id.
00:22:40.130 - 00:23:16.436, Speaker C: I've already pasted it in here. You could search any hash or address you want up here. And essentially what this transaction is is this is me actually staking for Jito soul, I think maybe in September. So a couple of months ago. So I was staking 210 sol and I got, I think it was like 199 Jiro Sol back. You can see that it does not look as simple as, as I made it sound, especially if you come from the Ethereum world. You might be used to like, oh, it should just be like two calls.
00:23:16.436 - 00:23:50.924, Speaker C: Why are there eight extra calls here? If I went from compact to detailed, this is normally when people's eyes roll over. I remember the first time I looked at a transaction on Solana. I was scrolling and I was like, why does this simple transaction have 18 pages of data? Let's walk through it step by step. The first thing you need to understand is instructions. So you can see here there's an instruction one, instruction two, instruction three, and then there's also 2.12.22. .32.4 this one, two, and three.
00:23:50.924 - 00:24:17.326, Speaker C: You can think of that as the outer instruction. This is the main thing being done by a specific instruction. So this one here is transferring 210 Sol from one address to another. This one here. And we're going to talk about token programs in a second. It's creating an account for me to hold Jitosoul in. Because you don't hold the token inside of your wallet, you actually create another account to hold it for you.
00:24:17.326 - 00:24:57.990, Speaker C: And that's one of the most confusing concepts. We'll get into it, but to create an account to hold my Jito soul. There's actually four other inner instructions that have to happen. One is I have to actually create the accounts, and then two is I have to say, hey, this account should be holding Jitosol as its token. If I was buying USDC, it's kind of the same thing. An account has to be created to hold USDC and then there's an initialized to assign USDC to it. And the actual transfer or the depositing doesn't happen until this third instruction here where this is calling the stake pool program.
00:24:57.990 - 00:25:41.620, Speaker C: Almost all lsts go through the stake pool program and this is saying, hey, now that everything is ready, the token has been prepped for transfer and the account is prepped to be receiving the mint. Now the easy part is deposit, transfer, and mint the tokens back. It's still a lot of steps. And yes, I see a question already that someone says salon is complex. It does look very complex. My main advice is like, mentally, you'll get better at just filtering out these system and computes and token program instructions, and you'll get better at just reading. I only really care about depositsoul and I see there's a deposit amount here.
00:25:41.620 - 00:26:05.532, Speaker C: That's all I care about. So just quickly recapping, that's your outer instruction. These are your inner instructions that are kicked off by the outer instruction. When a program calls another program, that's called a cross program invocation. Yes. Developers like to make things sound really complicated. That's been shortened to CPI, not to be confused with inflation.
00:26:05.532 - 00:26:53.710, Speaker C: When someone says CPI, they literally just mean, oh, a program called another program. Right. Instructions have data like you've already seen. And this last confusing part is account arguments. You might be wondering for depositing stake why are there a list of ten other things here? What does this mean? One of the biggest features of Solana is that you can run things in parallel the way that they do. This is two things involved. One of the main things involved is you have to list out all of the accounts involved so that when a validator or someone looks and tries to order these transactions, they can see, oh, this specific account is already being written to in this transaction.
00:26:53.710 - 00:27:15.380, Speaker C: We can't also have another transaction writing to it. So we have to list out all of these accounts. So that's one reason it's listed here. But this is actually useful for us as data analysts as well. To be able to quickly get the stake pool address or the user account address. It looks scary. You'll get used to seeing this and understanding this fairly quickly, it just takes some practice.
00:27:15.380 - 00:27:36.424, Speaker C: But yeah, that takes you through instructions. You have inner and outer. The executing account is just the program that's running at a specific instruction level. The account arguments are just the account. And like all of the accounts involved in the specific instruction data is just call data. CPI is program calling another program. We're almost through the definitions phase.
00:27:36.424 - 00:28:14.096, Speaker C: This is going to get more fun soon, I promise. For accounts, there's three things you are going to want to understand. The first one is balance changes. So if you go to any explorer, you'll see there's a sole balance change and then there's a token balance exchange kind of tab. This is just quickly allowing you to see for all addresses involved in the transaction was their balance change. So like, yes, my wallet went down by 210 sol, and then the Jito soul stake pool went up by 210 soul. And then also my wallet account that was created to hold Geodosol went up by 199.
00:28:14.096 - 00:28:54.510, Speaker C: That's just account balances, account data. I won't go into too much because it's a bit of more of an advanced concept. But for example, if I went to the stake pool here, I can view the data and the account actually stores more data about who is the owner of a stake account and who can authorize withdrawals, who can change the stake and whatnot. Again, thats more advanced. You probably wont run into it until maybe a month into youre doing Solana analysis. Now, rent, this is the last one that im just putting in here because a lot of people get confused like, oh, I sent 210 Sol to stake. Why did I also send 0.002
00:28:54.510 - 00:29:22.050, Speaker C: sol to some random account? This is called rent. So anytime you create an account on Solana, you have to pay a rent for that account to not get deleted. The reason why it's the 0.002 number is because there is a rent exempt level. Essentially, if you put at least this amount into an account, then that account won't get deleted. And if you choose to delete that account, you get this back. So it's not like you're paying it and losing it forever.
00:29:22.050 - 00:29:40.380, Speaker C: But that's why for a lot of transactions, especially if you look at NFT mints, there's like five or ten, like 0.002 sole transactions, and that's purely just paying rent. You should learn to just mentally filter them out. Like you see this and you're like, all right, that's just creating an account that's not important for me.
00:29:41.880 - 00:29:42.448, Speaker D: Cool.
00:29:42.544 - 00:30:02.738, Speaker C: I have some query tools here. We're going to come back to this later if we have time. These are just some of the queries I use to make analysis and sleuthing a lot easier. You should check it out when we share the slideshow. Now let's get into Dune a little more. What we just looked at, this is a block explorer. You can't write queries in here.
00:30:02.738 - 00:30:33.066, Speaker C: If you want to write queries, you have to use dune. If you want to use dune, you have to build a mental model for how does the data flow, the raw data we get straight from rpCs. Two of the main tables. You're going to want to use Solana instruction calls. That's literally just rows of these instructions. And then Solana accountactivity. That is this soul balance change and token balance change tabs.
00:30:33.066 - 00:30:59.560, Speaker C: So mentally you can just think of it as anything. An overview you get from instruction calls. Anything from balance changes you get from account activity. Now these tables are really, really big and hard to work with. A lot of the data that you get from it is all in base 58 or hexadecimal form. It's not super fun to work with. Something we created earlier this year is decoded tables.
00:30:59.560 - 00:31:17.896, Speaker C: I'm going to hop into Dune for a second here. I will explain this interface, but just bear with me for a second. SPL token. That's this program. This token program. It's technically the SPL token program. Let's say I want to see initializeaccount.
00:31:17.896 - 00:31:40.818, Speaker C: I can just look here. Initialize account. Here is a table. It's a SQL table that anyone can query and it has all of the accounts and call data nicely decoded for you. That's one of the main decoded tables you'll use. We have hundreds of decoded tables for you to do your analysis easier. You should mainly be using this.
00:31:40.818 - 00:32:20.150, Speaker C: You should rarely really use Solana instruction calls the next level. This is what we're going to be using for our work today. But it's good for you to know that these tables were created from these decoded tables. There's a Tokens Solana fungible table which gives you all of the fungible tokens on Solana. If I just search this into what we call our data explorer, you'll be able to see a bunch of the tokens, their names, how many decimals they have, their symbols. Same thing for transfers. We have a table that's aggregated all SPL token transfers into one table.
00:32:20.150 - 00:32:49.348, Speaker C: And lastly, we'll look at balances as well. There's also an NFT table. We're not going to cover nfts today. It's a little more complex, but I'll share a resource for it later. This is all done in spellbook. This is all open source. If I went to spellbook as our GitHub repo and searched up token salon NFT, you can see our exact code for how we get all NFT tokens.
00:32:49.348 - 00:33:18.694, Speaker C: You can see it's actually complex. It's 200 lines of SQL. But as you get more advanced, you'll learn to look into spellbook and double check. What does this table really mean? We don't hide anything from you. All of this is like decoded tables are created from like idls and the open source code of programs. Spellbook is all created inside of this public GitHub repo, literally called Spellbook. And ultimately these come together to create high level tables like Dexalana trades.
00:33:18.694 - 00:33:58.832, Speaker C: So Dexlana trades is then how we get dashboards like this one that easily show you. Oh, what's the trading volume of like orca or lfinity or Meteora on any given day, hour, week, et cetera. Cool. Now you have an understanding of how these transaction basics map to dune tables. Now, you probably did not understand tokens and accounts earlier at all. I know that this took me honestly, like weeks to understand how tokens and accounts work. One of the best graphics I've seen for explaining this is from our friends over at Metaplex.
00:33:58.832 - 00:34:43.846, Speaker C: You might have heard Metaplex before, as it's for they've built one of the main NFT standards, but they have this great diagram in here that shows there's a wallet account, there's a token account, and there's a mint account. And I want to say accounts are different from programs. So something you'll notice if we looked at this transaction here, the associated token program was used to create the token account. The teal token account is this CW seven D seven account. The associated token program sits at this address here. Atoken, GPV, whatever. Same thing for trading mint accounts, for deploying Jito soul.
00:34:43.846 - 00:35:02.640, Speaker C: They also call the token program. And we're going to look at the transaction in a second. But they say, okay, I'm going to create an account. And the create account happens through the system program. Um, so accounts are technically blank slates. Anyone can go and create an account and then use another program to initialize something onto it. Um, that's how multisigs works.
00:35:02.640 - 00:35:41.624, Speaker C: That's how, like orca whirlpool, like, like liquidity pools work. That's how vaults work. But essentially what we have is now this three account lineage, where my wallet that has a seed phrase is now connected to these two program created accounts, or what they like to call, again in technical speak, program derived accounts, which they've nicely shortened to pdas. So the token account actually holds the token. You know what token is being held because it's tied to the mint account, and you know who's holding the token because it's tied to a wallet. Right. And I'm just going to reiterate this one more time, looking at this page here.
00:35:41.624 - 00:36:21.160, Speaker C: For token balance change, there's an address, which is the token account. There is an owner, which is the person who the wallet that's actually owning it. And then you have the token mint address, which for Jitto is j one t zero. So one l and yes, you'll notice, like, why do some places call an address? Why do some people call an account? Why do some people say mint? Some people don't say mint. This is just what happens when you have complicated naming. I'm going to quickly show the transaction for creating the Mins account, just so we can look at one more transaction and get a sense of things. This is one of the sleuther queries I use.
00:36:21.160 - 00:36:44.360, Speaker C: You can plug in any account into here and get the transaction id of the creation. So this is when the token mint was created by Edgar, who is one of the members over at the Jitto team. If I plug this in here, you'll see. Oh, there's a small sole payment. People should know. What is the sole payment? It's paying rent. And this one's fairly simple.
00:36:44.360 - 00:37:19.538, Speaker C: They created the accounts, and then they called token program and said, hey, I want this to officially be the token mint account for Jitto soul. So it doesn't hold any tokens, but it now becomes the assigned mint account for anyone who wants to hold a token. Every wallet has to create, like. So every token account holds a mint account balance for one wallet. It's not like one token account holds everyone's wallet accounts. So that's why you have so many accounts. And again, you might be wondering, why would they do that? This all comes back to how Solana parallelizes its transactions.
00:37:19.538 - 00:37:52.874, Speaker C: Because if you know that a specific account is being accessed, then no one else is going to be allowed to access that account in a parallelized transaction. So there are reasons for why this is the design. All right, we're going to jump right into queries now. There is this slide here if you want to take a quick screenshot. We're going to also share this afterwards. This is just showcasing all of the features inside of the do in query editor. I'm going to walk through it again still, but I'm just putting this quickly here in case you want to save it.
00:37:52.874 - 00:38:34.510, Speaker C: As we go and walk through the queries, I'll pause for a few seconds. All right, let's get into writing some SQL. We're not going to get into advanced SQL here if you don't know any SQL. There's a few tutorials that I can share after this, but I'm going to try and explain as much as I can as I go. The first query we're going to do is let's see, what are the weekly mints and burns of g toe Soul. Remember when I staked into the stake pool earlier, I was minted 199 Jito Soul tokens. That's what this mint two instruction did.
00:38:34.510 - 00:39:16.042, Speaker C: So if I was to burn those tokens, I would get my 210 soul back and the 199 tokens would be burned and disappear. So how do we do this? So I have this weekly mints and Burns query. We're going to write it from scratch. Essentially this button up here is going to be your best friend. I'm going to go and create a new query and we're going to do a select all from tokens. Solana transfers. First thing you do, if you wanted to search this up, you also just do token Solana.
00:39:16.042 - 00:39:40.522, Speaker C: You'll see the tables here. This is a transfers table. There's an action, there's an amount being transferred. There's the owner that owns the token account that the tokens are being transferred to or from. There's a to owner and to token account as well. And then there's a token mint address. There's also the executing accounts and instruction indexes, but we're not going to get into that right now.
00:39:40.522 - 00:40:28.016, Speaker C: So if you see, I look here and I'm just looking at some examples, you'll get really good at identifying what tokens are. What you'll see, es nine and you'll know, okay, es nine, token mint address, that's USDT or you'll see EPJ. And you'll see, okay, EPJ, that's USDC or you'll see. So one, one, one. And this is wrapped Sol. This is basically taking the native asset of Sol and making it into an SPL token so that it easily works with any Solana protocol they don't have to go and handle. Oh, is it native or is an SPL token? So what do I want here, I want to filter for where token mint address is equal to the token mint address.
00:40:28.016 - 00:41:12.192, Speaker C: So I can get that from here. Remember we looked at this earlier, this was the token mint address that was created. And I'm going to add a limit 100. So what is this doing? It's looking at Tokenslana transfers, filtering for the gtosol tokenization, selecting all columns, that's what this asterisk means. And I'm doing a limit 100 to only show me the first hundred rows and you can see the first rows, which would make sense because you can't transfer something that hasn't been minted yet. These are basically all mints until transfers here you'll might see, oh wow, this is a huge mint. If I go down to this is just table formatting actually, but I add a comma here to format.
00:41:12.192 - 00:41:49.380, Speaker C: It's like, oh, someone trans like minted 22, 79 billion jitosol. That's incorrect. This is actually just the raw data. Anyone who's familiar with blockchain data should know that raw data on chain, there is no such thing as decimals. Decimals is this concept that blockchains just don't know of, however humans need it. So where do we store decimals? Anyone that was looking really closely before would have noticed that on tokens fungible there's a decimals column. So we want to pull this decimals column into here so that we're able to decipher amount.
00:41:49.380 - 00:42:26.422, Speaker C: So what am I going to do? I'm going to do the most confusing SQL function. I'm going to start using joins. I'm not really going to explain joins here. I'm going to try to give you an intuition for it, but essentially I want to join these two tables. So transfers and fungible on token mint address. So that literally just looks like left join. I've renamed these tables so I don't have to write as much, but left join transfer token mint address to tokens, token mint address and I'm going to select, I'm going to run this and it's going to give me an error.
00:42:26.422 - 00:42:50.030, Speaker C: It's going to say token mint address is ambiguous. That's because now there's two tables that have this token mint address column. It doesn't know which one I want to filter on. I want to filter on the transfers one. Technically, it actually doesn't matter which one I filter on in this case. And oh, I actually didn't want to run that. I wanted to pull symbol and decimals first.
00:42:50.030 - 00:43:17.870, Speaker C: So I'm pulling the symbol column from tokens, the decimals column from tokens, and then all columns from transfers. And you'll notice I put the comma on the left here. You can put it on the right. I just prefer putting the comma on the left because it makes it easier to comment things out. So you can see now that I've done the join the symbols here. Jitter souls. Nine decimals.
00:43:17.870 - 00:44:00.960, Speaker C: That does not mean every token is nine decimals. Some are zero, some are five, some are six. So technically this value here is not 1 billion, it's like 1.097. So how would I show that? I would do tr dot amount, and I want to divide by ten to the power of decimals as actual amount. Let's run this one more time. And now you can see that the actual amount in this transaction was 26 Gtosol, even though the amount shown in the transfer table is 26 billion or so. So that's just something to keep in mind.
00:44:00.960 - 00:44:50.330, Speaker C: Now, we don't want to lose the plot. We want to create this weekly mints and burns table. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use date trunk, which just truncates a specific date to the closest week. So in this case I'm saying, all right, I want to get the week of whatever April 5 is, so it'll truncate it to that Monday. And I want to get the sum. So basically I want the total transferred amount of given week. So I'm going to do a group by one and I'm going to add one more filter here just to make this query run faster.
00:44:50.330 - 00:45:17.392, Speaker C: I'm going to say I only want transfers within the last 30 days. This is saying now -30 days. The block time of the transfer has to be greater than that. I can remove this. What is group by group by is just how you do aggregations. If you want to sum some value by some other value, you have to do a group by. And this will make more sense once I add the second column.
00:45:17.392 - 00:46:02.212, Speaker C: But we can see here that the total amount that was either minted, burned or transferred has been pretty stable around like 6 million for the last few weeks. Of course it went up last week because of the airdrop. So let's make this 90. And we originally wanted just mints and burns. What I'm going to do is first I'm going to group by action as well because I want to know the specific amount transferred in a specific action. I add that to the group by and if I do this and I'll let it run and you can now see, okay, there's mint, there's transfer, there's burn. If I add a bar chart.
00:46:02.212 - 00:46:27.042, Speaker C: So I'm going to create a chart. Now you can create as many charts as you want. You still have the query results over here. I can select amount and I wanted to group by action. And we can go ahead and stack this to see oh, mints, burns and transfers. It's not super readable. So what we're going to want to do is we're going to first filter out transfers.
00:46:27.042 - 00:47:14.950, Speaker C: So action in mint and burn, you could also do action not equal to transfer. And what I want is if action equals mint, make it positive, otherwise make it negative. This is basically a SQL if statement. So now when I run this one more time, this is a good time to point out that there are multiple tiers of running. I'm running on the medium tier which is semi fast. You can run on the large tier which will run really fast. But now you can see, okay, we can now see weekly mints and burns for Jitosol over the last 90 days.
00:47:14.950 - 00:47:38.298, Speaker C: And you can just save the query here. I'm not going to save it because I already have it saved over here. And with this you can see oh geo sols. First mint was all the way back in October of 2022. The activity was pretty flat until June. And suddenly in June things started picking up. And then in October things really started picking up.
00:47:38.298 - 00:48:01.800, Speaker C: So these are always like this kind of time series. Analysis on tokens is always super useful. To understand momentum you could change this token mint address to any token mint address. Basically what we created was not just weekly mints and Burns for Jitosol. We created weekly mints and burns for any SPL token on Solana. That's the first query. Good job.
00:48:01.800 - 00:48:45.744, Speaker C: To everyone who's followed along so far, I highly recommend try to write this query from scratch yourself. You're going to find that there's a lot that you didn't actually understand and that'll make you a stronger analyst in the long run. If you felt that was way too easy, go and calculate the circulating supply of USDC on Solana. It is not just mints and burns because circle centrally manages mints and burns themselves. I will leave it to you to figure out what that means and how to write that query. If that is still too simple for you. I have an advanced reference here from a dashboard I released this morning showing LST basically like whale movements.
00:48:45.744 - 00:49:24.226, Speaker C: So looking for any transfer of any LST with more than 3000 sol. Where was it a transfer out or a transfer in what program was invoked and you can kind of see oh for Jupiter, I've made it mark. So it's a sell or a buy. And for stuff like Camino and marginfire, stuff like that, it's, was it a deposit or withdrawal? And mints and everything are marked here as well. Again, this deck will be shared later so you can find the link. But if you can create this, then you have a pretty good understanding of Solana transfers and tokens. All right, take a quick breath.
00:49:24.226 - 00:49:49.780, Speaker C: Reset. We're going to now move into another concept. It is balances. Token balances is probably the thing you will use most besides transfers. So we want to see what are the top jitto soul holders. So I already have this query over here. We're going to just, again, same thing, recreate it from scratch.
00:49:49.780 - 00:50:48.962, Speaker C: I'm going to start a new query and what we're going to start with is actually, let me show you what the base table looks like. So earlier I mentioned account activity is literally this sole balance change and token balance change tables. So if I did select all from Solana accountactivity where let me actually double check. Solana accountactivity is token mint address equals and I'm going to do a very small limit here and also filter for block time greater than now minus interval. We'll do one day and I'm going to bump this up to the large cluster. You might be asking why am I doing that for such a small query account activity. There's a row in there for every account, for every transaction.
00:50:48.962 - 00:51:41.260, Speaker C: This is absolutely gigantic table. If you try and just use this table for like any of your work and you join on it to something else, that query is likely going to crash. That is the reason why I created daily balances and latest balances as tables. Just so for every account, it's literally basically the same table as account activity, but just filtered for like the balance at end of day. And this runs once a day. But you can see here for account activity, it just literally has all these transactions and the address of the transaction and the pre and post token balance. If I wanted just latest balances, or if I want the top holders, then I only need latest balances.
00:51:41.260 - 00:52:17.460, Speaker C: I can pop that into here, we can preview it just so you get an understanding of what this table is. It's just the address, the sole balance, the token balance, the token mint address if it has one, the token balance owner if it has one. You'll notice some of these are like null because my wallet will also show up here. My wallet is just a normal address. It doesn't have a token mint address and it doesn't have an owner besides itself. So these are going to show up empty. But yeah, I'm going to say Solana or not Solana, select all from Solana utils latest balances where token mint address is equal to Jiro soul.
00:52:17.460 - 00:53:15.540, Speaker C: Now let me order by token balance descending. And you might say oh, there we go, that's all I had to do. I got an order by token balance for a given token mint address and that gets me all holders. And I'm going to tell you no, that's actually wrong because a user could close and open multiple accounts for a given token over time and depending on various factors, the address that token accounts. Remember, if you've gotten lost like this one that was created, that address might change over time. So a specific owner could actually have multiple token addresses. So what I need to do instead is say for a given token balance owner, get me the sum of token balance as total tokens held.
00:53:15.540 - 00:53:52.460, Speaker C: And then I'm going to just order by this. We're going to do a group by again because I want to aggregate all of the token balances for a given token holder. And then we're going to run this and this is going to give you the total tokens held. And I can go and make this nicely formatted however I want. And I like to usually do a 0.0 a to round this out. Other thing you'll see me do commonly is commas.
00:53:52.460 - 00:54:33.084, Speaker C: And now I have my list of top 100 GtosOl holders. Again, the hard part I think to wrap your head around here is just how token accounts work and understanding that latest balances is just taking the latest value from daily balances and daily balances is taking the daily latest value from Solana account activity. If you understand that, balances becomes a lot easier to work with. I won't go into this here, but you'll see. I also have an SNS domains join in my example query. This is like ENS domains. I just like to get the SNS domain so that sometimes the tables become more readable.
00:54:33.084 - 00:55:29.740, Speaker C: You know that multicoin capital is up here. As one of the top holders of GTAG soul, there's also this diamond hands person, and if I keep scrolling there's CFOx, a few others. You'll sometimes see names that you recognize in there, but that gives you an idea of how token accounts and balances work. If I wanted to see these queries I can go to my library and you'll see that I have these queries here among a bunch of other ones that I've been editing. You can share this with a friend just with the link. You can create an API endpoint for it. You can schedule this query and we soon have alerts so that you can get these total like who are the highest digital soul balance holders into your slack every day? Or telegram and download CSV materializations I'm not going to get into, but if you're a data engineer then you probably know what materializing means, and hopefully that gets you excited.
00:55:29.740 - 00:56:15.794, Speaker C: But there's a bunch of options. You can go from here. Now if that token balance query was too easy, try and create and get the top hundred geo solholders at any given date and time. So not just latest balances, you're going to have to use daily balances, and you'll likely need to use either window functions or max buy, which is going to require you to dive into our documentation@dune.com. docs under query under Dune SQL and functions and operators you'll see every single function listed. This will require you to go into documentation a little, but that'll be good practice. If that was still too easy for you, I have another advanced reference.
00:56:15.794 - 00:56:40.508, Speaker C: This is getting the USD liquidity or TVL of all Solana Dex pools. I'm going to pull up the query. This one is fairly complex. There's a lot of nuance to it. You can see that it's, I think, almost 100 lines long. I filter out a bunch of like shit coins that are screwing with the data. But if you want, try and understand what I'm doing here.
00:56:40.508 - 00:57:07.086, Speaker C: There's forward fills, there's multiple price sources, there's cross joins. It's fairly advanced. But if you understand this, then golden to go and analyze basically anything in Solana. So those are the two queries I wanted to share with you today. Again, if that was too difficult, don't worry, it takes time. Rewatch this tutorial. Rewatch like not rewatch, but like redo those queries.
00:57:07.086 - 00:57:39.212, Speaker C: Try to write it yourself, following along with the video. Try to write it yourself, not looking at the video and really dig into each tables. Try to understand what they mean to go and use block explorers as much as you want. They will be extremely helpful for you if you need reference dashboards I have a list of six dashboards here covering like ecosystem stuff, Dexs, NFTs, staking. Go and look at those queries. Try and learn from them. The good thing is that any query you see on dune.
00:57:39.212 - 00:58:31.164, Speaker C: If it's public, you can just look at the code and fork it. So you can go to my USD volume query, fork it, and now you can go and edit it and change whatever you want. If you're more of a reading kind of person, I've written a four part analytics guide that'll teach you from the basics how to do very advanced analysis. If you're from Ethereum, I have a translation guide that teaches you what are all of the names? How do the terms in Ethereum relate to the terms in Solana? And if you just want to analyze any program, I have more beginners guide here as well. My last caveat here, before I open up for questions is just the easiest way to learn Solana is to use it. If you're an analyst just trying to analyze this stuff and you've never used Solana once, I promise you, you're going to have a bad time. It's a lot easier.
00:58:31.164 - 00:59:13.512, Speaker C: Just spin up a wallet, go try a small trade on Jupiter, and look at that trade and see if you understand these instructions. This is what I did when I was building the Jito soul dashboard. I went and I deposited into Jito Soul and I tried understanding. Okay, I kind of understand what I did from a UI level. How does that match with these instructions here? What do I understand? What do I not? And yeah, that's everything I have. Thank you for sticking around and listening to all of our amazing speakers and I learning Solana with us today. We're going to continue putting a lot of this effort in from the dune side.
00:59:13.512 - 00:59:20.580, Speaker C: We might have more seminars in January, and I'm going to open up to questions.
00:59:23.480 - 00:59:57.346, Speaker A: Thank you. First of all, Andrew, I was captivated, you know, by this deep dive. Definitely. I think we saw some comments that Solana is a different beast. I think we had people coming from, obviously, the EVM landscape and other chains. But hopefully this is a starting point on how to look into Solana transaction and how to leverage doom to do that, there are some questions. Maybe, Andrew, if you can take a time, we try to answer some of them already, but if you have the open Q and A, maybe we can go through some of that.
00:59:57.346 - 01:00:00.322, Speaker A: I can read it to you. If you have access to them, maybe.
01:00:00.346 - 01:00:01.234, Speaker C: We can look at some of them.
01:00:01.242 - 01:00:02.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I can.
01:00:02.780 - 01:00:10.800, Speaker C: If I put it, if I put it on the screen, can you guys see it? I dragged it over. I don't know if Zoom shows it. Probably not.
01:00:11.740 - 01:00:14.236, Speaker A: You'd have to share specifically that.
01:00:14.388 - 01:00:43.238, Speaker C: Okay, I'll just read off of it for any transfer from wallet to contract. Does Solana create an account except wallet to wallet transfer? So it doesn't matter if you're a contract or a wallet. To hold tokens, you have to have a token account. The only exception is for the sole native token. The native token can be held in any specific account. It doesn't have to be held in a token account. The wrapped native tokens or wrapped soul is an SPL token.
01:00:43.238 - 01:01:25.392, Speaker C: It does need to be held in a token account. What about NFT mints? How do we map tokens to the collection address? This one's actually much more complicated. The query I recommend you take a look at is go to the NFT dashboard, go to trending collections and you're going to see that I do a join on either verified creator or collection mint. These are columns that I've already brought into Tokenslana. NFT. You might have saw the spellbook query from earlier that was like 300 lines. It is fairly complex to understand and the good thing is that I wrote a guide covering nfts.
01:01:25.392 - 01:02:15.868, Speaker C: Specifically, it's part three of the analytics guide. It takes you through everything about what is an NFT, how to understand the concepts, and like what are all the different types of nfts outside of the slides, are there more exercises to practice? I would say if you can try these slide exercises I put like recreating the original query, trying the challenge query, trying the advanced reference. If you can create those and you're just looking for more practice at that point, just go on Twitter, see what people are tweeting about and see if you can go and analyze it. That's, at that point, that's going to be the best practice you can get. The recording and present dilutation doc. Yeah, it will be available. We're going to share this.
01:02:15.868 - 01:02:50.988, Speaker C: It's going to be on YouTube and we're also going to share it on Twitter as well after we finish some editing. So yeah, this will all be public. Is there a course or something that I can use to get better? It's in the plans. We're thinking about it. We're going to see how receptive people are to this and go and see what you build. The more you ask for this on Twitter, the more likely we will actually go and build out a course. Go tweet about it, go tag Frederick and tag anatoly, and then I'll, I'll go and do it.
01:02:50.988 - 01:03:34.752, Speaker C: What's the best tip to start for someone who has some knowledge of SQL but doesn't know anything about the salon data area. If you know SQL already, go through my analytics starter guide with the knowledge you have from this seminar, you'll be well prepared to walk through it after you go through these four parts. If you make it through all four parts, you're going to be like, well, probably already within the top 5% of Solana analysts, if not higher. What is the significance of a program address? Programs are like smart contracts. They're deployed, they go and run logic. So there's nothing specifically significant about a program address. Actually, it's all deployed through.
01:03:34.752 - 01:04:07.900, Speaker C: I hope Solana FM shows this programs all progress numbers deployed through this BPF loader upgradable account. It does get complex in terms of like, the program is not just one address. Technically it has data. Programs that hold different data and program structures get complex. I talk about that also in this analytics guide. If you look at this is long. If you go to part two, I have a part where I talk about different kinds of programs and even how to read the rust.
01:04:07.900 - 01:05:00.230, Speaker C: What are some good soul ecosystem resources that we can use to validate our data outputs? That one's hard. That's part of the reason why I've taken us on this journey. The more good analysis we have from more people, the more confident we can get in our statistics, I would say. I've tried to put together the most accurate dashboards that I can. I try to reference from asking teams, from looking at defi llama, from looking at other platforms, trying to see how closely our numbers tie. Rarely will the numbers tie exactly, but typically it's like the more people that are involved, the easier it is to go and try and verify it. And yeah, I think that's all the questions.
01:05:00.230 - 01:05:19.000, Speaker C: Kind of speedrun those. But yeah, if you have any more questions, reach out to either me on Twitter or shashank on Twitter or arno. We're more than happy to chat. We're very friendly people. We're not going to be mean to you. We just want to help you learn. I see one more question here.
01:05:19.000 - 01:05:37.340, Speaker C: Oh, okay. There's a lot more questions. Maybe, Shashank, if you want to give any thoughts before I, I know we've kept you here for a while. Any thoughts or plugs you want for resources for Solana data or ways to get involved?
01:05:38.440 - 01:05:58.426, Speaker D: I think ways to get involved is a very good one. Honestly, just go use a Solana app and I think that's the best place to start. The second best place to start is just go check out super team. So let me drop a link real quick and I don't know if I can put this into chat or not.
01:05:58.498 - 01:06:03.830, Speaker A: But if you send it to me, I will send it to all our attendees.
01:06:04.330 - 01:06:30.636, Speaker D: Gotcha. I just sent it to you. Yeah, go check out some bounties for super team. And it's not only technical, it just gives you a good idea of what's going on in the ecosystem. And, yeah, at least from a data perspective, I feel like the space is very undersaturated. So if you're starting now, this is a very good time. There are not too many Solana data analysts and I can see the demand growing by the day.
01:06:30.636 - 01:06:42.920, Speaker D: So, like, as the ecosystem matures, there will be a demand and we will need to pull that demand. So that's. That's why I want to keep Andrew doing what he's doing. Yeah, that's all I have.
01:06:46.790 - 01:06:49.330, Speaker A: Andrew, have we answered all the questions?
01:06:51.110 - 01:07:04.570, Speaker C: I think the questions coming in now are all a lot more complex. I'm not going to be able to replicate Dextvl in this seminar, but hopefully next time. So I think it's a good stopping point for us today.
01:07:05.950 - 01:07:56.768, Speaker A: Well, for all of you who still have questions through the resources that Shashank shared to get involved in the Solana ecosystem, to hopefully start using Dune and all the Solana data available. And Drew, myself and the entire dune organization are here to help you. If you're looking at some people, look at the Twitter handle. It is in the invite. If you go to the Dune main Twitter handle, you'll have probably a couple of posts with both Shashank, Andrews and Lucas handle. If you want to reach out to them directly, join also the Dune discord. A lot of exciting conversation around that and hope to have more probably educational course around Solana coming soon from Andrew and the rest of the team.
01:07:56.768 - 01:08:26.400, Speaker A: I want to thank you, Shashank, for supporting and getting your hands dirty in the whole Solana data ecosystem with Dune. I think it was fantastic. I learned a lot. I can tell everybody is getting excited, and I think Anatoly gave us a great read into why we should be excited even more in 2024 about what's coming from Solana. Thank you, Shashank. Thank you, Andrew, for the amazing webinar. More to come from the Dune team.
01:08:26.400 - 01:08:28.380, Speaker A: Happy holidays for all of you.
01:08:29.640 - 01:08:30.144, Speaker D: Bye.
01:08:30.232 - 01:08:31.600, Speaker B: Thank you, folks. Bye.
