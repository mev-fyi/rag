00:00:02.960 - 00:00:36.656, Speaker A: Yeah. Hey, everyone. Welcome to the Dune Analytics X Index Corp chatting in the dune session. And today JD Cook of the index corp is joining me to talk about their data and what I think is one of the coolest set of dashboards that we have on Dune. And also, I think the index corp is just doing a great job in general in utilizing that data. And I thought we could all take the opportunity and just chat to the man behind the data and the man who's coordinating that at the index. Cop, I guess.
00:00:36.656 - 00:00:41.700, Speaker A: And, yeah. Happy to have you here, JD Cook, or Joseph, I should call you, right?
00:00:42.840 - 00:00:57.960, Speaker B: JD's good. Happy to be here. Yeah, I would say. I wouldn't say man. Behind all the data. I know there's a lot of a few contributors on this call. It's definitely a team effort, and that's part of the process.
00:00:57.960 - 00:01:05.048, Speaker B: Right now we'll probably talk about, but, yeah, happy to be here and dive in and look at some data.
00:01:05.224 - 00:01:31.116, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. So this is going to be slightly unconventional, because I actually have the questions open. So I think we're first going to just go over what is index corp and who are you and who are the other contributors. I guess then we're going to talk about the index corp and dune, what you've done. I think I will give you the control over the. If you can share your screen, that would be cool.
00:01:31.116 - 00:02:00.810, Speaker A: If you can just run us through a dashboard, and then we can just talk about the metrics and what you guys are surfacing in terms of the data, and then we can just have a general conversation about challenges with the on chain data. I don't know, defi and Dune in general terms. So, yeah, let's get right into it, I guess. So the first question I have for you is obviously, like, what is the index co op for anyone who's not initiated?
00:02:02.590 - 00:03:00.132, Speaker B: Yeah, so the index co op is a DaO focused on building, launching, growing, and maintaining crypto index products. So the co op was spun out of set labs back in September 2020. So it's crazy to think we haven't even really. We haven't been in full swing for a full year yet, but we currently have four products, live, DPI, MVI, which is the metaverse index, and then the two fly products, ETH, two XFly and BTC, two XFlye. And we have a few more at the tail end of the launch pipeline that should be coming out soon, which is exciting. But, yeah. So as far as structure goes, I feel like we're constantly evolving as a dow, but right now we have working groups.
00:03:00.132 - 00:03:46.928, Speaker B: It's kind of the main structure. So we have working groups across engineering, product growth, treasury, community design and analytics. I think that's all the working groups. And so there's working group leaders that are accepted via the governance process. And these working groups are created by proposal with a budget, and then it's up to the working group leader and how they design their proposal, about how they. How they'll attract contributors and pay those contributors, and then how they will work and interface with other working groups. So that's kind of the structure right now, I think we're.
00:03:46.928 - 00:04:28.410, Speaker B: Like I said, though, as many of you who are working within daos probably feel like it's a constant evolution. We're trying to learn how to. How to gain the efficiencies and the benefits and advantages that a DAO can provide while also in the work that we're doing. It still requires a lot of high level strategic alignment. So how do we merge those two things? So that's currently how the daos organized and functioning, and we continue to try to improve on that.
00:04:28.530 - 00:04:35.150, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting. How many people in total would you think work on the index club?
00:04:35.850 - 00:05:25.110, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we were just on a call and somebody brought up the number near 60 that they're not full time. No, I think we have 60, like part. I would say 60 part time. And with you probably have, you know, six to eight that are pretty much doing this full time. So, yeah, as we grow, more people have the opportunity to make it more of a full time thing, but there's room for a lot of contribution for people that have anywhere from a few hours to 10 hours a week, especially through the working group structure, because tasks or projects are generally laid out pretty clearly and wherever help is needed.
00:05:26.000 - 00:05:31.260, Speaker A: How many people do you have in your analytics workgroup? Or just like, how many people have contributed in total?
00:05:32.000 - 00:06:04.424, Speaker B: Yeah, so right now, like, actively working on a project. So there's myself, I'll just call them out by their discord names just to give them a shout out. Jackie Poo deep, Lauren Huang, Gosuto Tutnice, Doc Ehrenberg. I think some of them are on this call. I think that's it. So that'd be eight of us right now actively working on projects or analytics tasks for the co op.
00:06:04.552 - 00:06:32.930, Speaker A: That's a lot. Usually I only see one or two or three guys working on these things, and eight. That certainly sounds like a success factor, but I guess we can talk about that more later just so that people can get a feel for what your background is. How did you find the index co op and how did you start contributing?
00:06:34.430 - 00:07:21.010, Speaker B: Yeah, I can do a little bit of personal. I have a background in analytics. I worked at Qualtrics when it was in gross stage right after college as a. As an analytics is on the advanced research team. Then I actually went, got a master's degree in analytics at Northwestern and in the United States in Chicago, and then took a job working on the analytics team at another growth stage startup called Thumbtack. But really, while I was. I've always been interested, probably since, you know, the big spike in 2017 and what crypto is, but it was while I was in grad school and I had a bit more time to focus on the things I was interested in.
00:07:21.010 - 00:08:10.810, Speaker B: Crypto started to take more and more of my research and reading time, trying to understand what is ethereum, how do smart contracts work? What are these decentralized applications? What is decentralized finance? Just slowly learning more. And I hit a point where I was just so fascinated by it. And I saw this tweet back in October of 2020 from. From Punya, who's one of the main contributors at the index co op, saying they're looking for contributors. And one of the areas was analytics. And it was such an interesting experience because I didn't actually know what the index co op was when I saw that tweet. I googled it and looked around for about ten minutes and just had this feeling like, this looks promising.
00:08:10.810 - 00:08:59.340, Speaker B: So I went into the discord and said, hey, I think I might be able to help with analytics. And within about five minutes, they had me in a specific channel linked with a couple other contributors, telling me what they were trying to accomplish. And it was finding, really, retention curves for early holders of DPI. That was the first project I dove in headfirst. Didn't have any experience on dune yet, so it's a big learning curve up front, but it turned out to be the right choice to jump in, because since I've kind of left my full time jobs, I'm doing this now full time at the co op.
00:08:59.840 - 00:09:20.690, Speaker A: Congratulations. Yeah. I think your story is pretty similar to a lot of other stories in Defi. Like, people who have been noticed, they noticed blockchain technology in 2017 and were in it for the money. Something in them told them like, hey, this is actually a pretty cool technology. So that's pretty similar to my story. Cool to hear that.
00:09:21.150 - 00:09:21.890, Speaker B: Sure.
00:09:22.870 - 00:09:46.550, Speaker A: Yeah. So now you're full time. That's great. So I guess, yeah, we've covered everything that I wanted to hear so let's just switch over to the next slide and. Yeah, I think. Are you able to just give us a rundown of your dashboards? Like, are you on a PC that you can handle that?
00:09:47.090 - 00:09:49.234, Speaker B: Yeah. Let me see here.
00:09:49.402 - 00:09:54.110, Speaker A: So I'll stop sharing my screen and I guess you can do it then.
00:09:57.690 - 00:09:58.870, Speaker B: How's that looking?
00:10:04.010 - 00:10:05.310, Speaker A: Yep, that works.
00:10:07.290 - 00:10:53.024, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. So hopefully everybody can see my screen. Happy to run through a few things. We have quite a few dashboards. I'll start with, obviously, the main one that maybe most of you have seen, and that's our index KPI's dashboard. We have what we call north stars and core KPI's really the two north stars. If you think about index co op, what our mission is, obviously, to create, like, user centric products, index products, and, you know, we judge, I think that the main metric that we judge is using unit supply, but two versions.
00:10:53.024 - 00:11:33.590, Speaker B: So we use unit supply overall, which is just a measure of demand for our products, but then unincentivized unit supply. Right. Like, what we're interested in when you. When it comes to creating index products, like the value of the index product, of being able to have, like, you don't have to manage access or your exposure to a whole sector of assets. Like, we don't. The way we manage, like, our product, we get a signal on product market fit is if we don't actually have to pay you to hold our product. Like, a lot of things in crypto with, you know, liquidity mining incentives or other staking incentives or whatnot.
00:11:33.590 - 00:11:53.590, Speaker B: So if we're not having to pay people to hold our product, it's assigned us, like, this is valuable, and we found a market that we fit. So we have here, like, our unit supply, and this is all our products broken out that are live right now.
00:11:53.750 - 00:12:02.616, Speaker A: So could you explain that a bit more in depth for a second? I think a lot of people will be confused by what unit supply actually means here, for sure.
00:12:02.688 - 00:12:14.832, Speaker B: Yeah. Thanks for. Thanks for pulling me back. I was getting excited. So I'll just take one product, like Dpi, for example. Dpi. Anybody can mint or redeem DPi.
00:12:14.832 - 00:13:33.176, Speaker B: And what that means is if you. We have the token sets contracts that if you want to mint a DP, one DPi, one unit of DPi, you can send the equivalent of all the underlying assets behind one DpI to the contract, and then in turn, mint one Dpi. And so as demand for DPi grows and people buy Dpi, this is what normally happens is the DPi price will get above the net asset value will take, or usually bots will use that as an arbitrage opportunity. So if DPI's price is rising above net asset value, the bots will get a bunch of the underlying assets, mint DPI units, and then sell them on the market and get that price back and keep up with demand. So one unit of DPi, it's just those assets are put into a vault, and that one DPI tracks exposure to those assets. And that's the same for all our products. The five products work a little bit differently.
00:13:33.176 - 00:13:59.020, Speaker B: They are leveraged products. So they're really intriguing but more sophisticated products. But they basically give you so east two X Fly gives you two x leverage on ETH while just holding one asset. And it's an asset that you can, you know, trade on Uniswap, which is really, really interesting. So you can really easily get in and out of one, two x positions. Yeah, yeah.
00:13:59.060 - 00:14:24.980, Speaker A: Really cool product. Yeah, yeah. That makes total sense. So, for anyone who's like totally unfamiliar with DPI, just real quick, it's a, it's a in, like, it's the Defi pulls index, and it consists of, I think, you know, better than me, like maker yearn. I don't know, I think there's quite a few in there. I don't think we need to pull it up. But it's basically like the top defi tokens inside of an indices or index.
00:14:26.040 - 00:14:36.260, Speaker B: Exactly. So you have uniswap, Aave, maker, compound, synthetix. Those are the highest in sushi. I think there's 13 tokens in there now.
00:14:37.360 - 00:14:37.696, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:37.728 - 00:15:37.778, Speaker B: Cool. Anyways, so, yeah, I just wanted to just touch on like, why that's so units supplied, that's tracking our, obviously our growth and demand of our products. But what we really pay attention to, and we report on every week, is unincentivized unit supply, which, you know, in this chart down here, our supply breakdown. Incentivized unit supply is if you buy dpi and then you put it in the uniswap v two dpi eth pool and then stake your lP tokens. In our current liquidity mining contract, we assess, like any DPI that is responsible for staked LP tokens as incentivized, meaning we have to assume for our sake that you only hold DPI because you're basically being paid to hold it and provide liquidity. That might not be the case explicitly. You might still hold DPI otherwise and might just be taking the opportunity.
00:15:37.778 - 00:16:02.620, Speaker B: But in terms of growth, we have to assume that if we were to shut off all incentives. We really want to understand who would still be holding our product because they think it's valuable, which this is just awesome to see, is in these two charts. This is the percentage breakdown on the right. And we're currently at 92% of our supply is unincentivized across all our products.
00:16:03.280 - 00:16:11.320, Speaker A: It's great to see. It seems to work really, really well. So what's the API? If I were to stake, like eth, Dpi?
00:16:12.220 - 00:16:35.480, Speaker B: Oh, that's a good question. I haven't even looked at it in the last little bit. It's been around. I think it's been around 15, 20%. It's gone down a little bit as we slowly removed incentives. But that's a whole other conversation. We're in the middle of a lot of discussions about uniswap v three and how we can get rid of all the liquidity incentives and whatnot.
00:16:35.480 - 00:16:41.460, Speaker B: Yeah, that's another big thing, project going on right now.
00:16:43.440 - 00:16:51.420, Speaker A: Yeah, but this is really good to see. And then you have trading data in there as well. Just like the basic information about your products, huh?
00:16:52.080 - 00:17:10.154, Speaker B: Yeah. So unit supply and addresses. These are our two north stars. But then we also have core. KPI's trading volume is a big one because our fly products aren't, aren't. They're not like our index products, like DPI and Nvi. They're built for traders.
00:17:10.154 - 00:17:42.570, Speaker B: Right. So it's not a product that's supposed is built. So you just hold onto it. It's built more for more active traders trying to take advantage of the volatility of either ETH or bitcoin. And so trading volume still is an important. It's important for all our products, but it's definitely one of the, it's actually one of the most important KPI's for the fly products for Ethan and BTC two, xfly. So we keep track of trading volume across all products.
00:17:42.570 - 00:18:12.204, Speaker B: And we report that seven day moving average every week as well. And this is. Yeah, trading volumes. We just try to capture all Dex activity in here. And then, like, really these, these views down here, like, value locked. We keep this in here because people are always interested, but we, we actually don't pay a lot of attention to value locked. Things are so dependent on price, you know, in that regard.
00:18:12.204 - 00:18:26.400, Speaker B: And, like, oftentimes that's out of our control. So, you know, we always want to know what it is, but, but we don't, we don't stress over that week to week near as much as we do, like unincentivized unit supply or holders or whatnot.
00:18:27.700 - 00:18:54.670, Speaker A: So you've, you've pretty much like solved the dilemma of like, usually on Twitter, most people just talk about total value locked or assets under management, but for you, it basically only makes sense when trying to project revenue. But the success of your products does not really depend on assets under management because the whole market could go down. But as long as your unit supply goes up, then you're still doing a good job.
00:18:55.010 - 00:19:54.720, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly, exactly. Especially in the growth phase we're out, we care about building unit supply of existing products, just increasing that demand independent of what the market is. And also these KPI's keep us focused on launching new products. Another way to grow and incentivize unit supply is to launch more products and to increase holders is to launch more products that are unique to a different market or subset of users. Um, so yeah, like, keeping track of total value locked is like a core KPI for us isn't, that's, it's not necess, it's not near as helpful to, to guide our decisions or our strategies. Um, revenue is the last core KPI. And you know, this is mostly just as a, another, this is also price dependent away because a lot of our revenue comes from streaming fees, which depend on Aume.
00:19:54.720 - 00:20:25.618, Speaker B: So, you know, at times when prices are higher, we get more just because it's the same streaming fee. But if the price is higher, you know, that streaming fees a little bit more for us, but this is just a way for us to gauge how well we're monetizing on our products and just overall growth. So it is pretty, it's pretty awesome. I mean, cumulative revenue after eight months is just north of $1.1 million. So that's always fun to keep an eye on.
00:20:25.714 - 00:20:28.510, Speaker A: Yeah, that's very nice to see.
00:20:30.130 - 00:20:40.746, Speaker B: Yeah, we don't need to jump into this too much. This is literally, this is just all the individual products, the same KPI is basically broken down individually. Can you scroll all the way up.
00:20:40.778 - 00:20:43.270, Speaker A: And see what the address exposure is?
00:20:44.410 - 00:21:06.020, Speaker B: Yeah, so current. I mean, you can see it here. Yeah, we're just, we're twelve away from. Well, as of. Oh wait, no, we just broke 20,000. So this is an interesting, this address exposure. I think this highlights maybe other questions around, like some of the challenges of working with on chain data and whatnot.
00:21:06.020 - 00:22:08.788, Speaker B: Is like when I originally came to the co op, it was like, yeah, that's a base thing. We need, we need to see how much, who has exposure to our products. But then also, you know, what their retention is like, so this was some of the first work we did, but it's very foundational to everything because you're, you know, there's a difference, and I think many of you that have worked here and do know this, like, there's a difference between finding who currently holds your wallet or who holds your products in their wallet versus who has exposure to your products. Because if they've deposited, say, in. In, like, Aave or compound or in cream, like DPI, you can deposit cream or their liquidity providing or whatever other extrinsic product, extrinsically productive opportunities for that asset are. You have to take that into account if you want to properly assess exposure. And so that's, that's always, we're always updating that.
00:22:08.788 - 00:22:24.654, Speaker B: And, like, you know, uni v three launches, we have to understand unity three and try to get that built into our queries as fast as we can, which we're still work. We're still getting everything in there. Right. Right now, hopefully, that'll be done in the next week. But it's just always, it's always updating.
00:22:24.782 - 00:22:29.530, Speaker A: Yeah. Can you just open that query for a second so we can see what complexity lies behind that?
00:22:30.030 - 00:22:32.290, Speaker B: Yeah, let's. Let's see this one.
00:22:34.510 - 00:22:35.430, Speaker A: It's like, just.
00:22:35.510 - 00:22:40.374, Speaker B: So I'll just kind of scroll down and like. Well, let's see. This is.
00:22:40.422 - 00:22:41.650, Speaker A: I see balancer.
00:22:42.910 - 00:22:45.238, Speaker B: Let me, let me just see. This is almost 14.
00:22:45.414 - 00:22:46.726, Speaker A: That's insane.
00:22:46.918 - 00:23:19.300, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah, so, yeah, I mean, this is because for the index club wide, I have to do every product, right? So I'm assessing transfers going through balancer, through sushi, through Uniswap, through Uniswap V three, through cream. And, you know, that's all for Dpi. I have to understand. So I have to assess the movement of DPi through all those different protocols to correctly get to exposure. Um, yeah. And then we.
00:23:19.380 - 00:23:37.236, Speaker A: So basically what you're doing is, like, sometimes you're then, like, are you tracking the negative balance of somebody, like, deposits into a contract, or are you tracking, like, has somebody, like, does a wallet have, like, Cr DPI tokens in their wallet? Like, what way?
00:23:37.268 - 00:23:50.110, Speaker B: So we. Yeah, we. Right now. And again, like, open, if their suggestions are better ways to do is right now we track negative. So, yeah, I. So we have to offset. So if you move.
00:23:50.110 - 00:24:15.556, Speaker B: So it would appear in two place. Right. If you move DPI into a liquidity pool, it would appear as, like, a transfer out, but it also appears as a transfer in the liquidity pool. So we offset those two so we'll say transfer out to negative, but the transfer into the DPI is a positive. So it, our query, our query doesn't, you don't lose any exposure to DPI through that, that movement, if that makes sense.
00:24:15.668 - 00:24:36.404, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. Yeah, I think both ways are totally valid. It's just, I think you just need to find your own ways. And there's always a bit of creativity involved here for sure. But this query, huge respect for putting that together. That is, I think, one of the most well made exposure queries I have seen.
00:24:36.404 - 00:24:40.720, Speaker A: I think it is the best on Dune by far. Just say it like it is.
00:24:43.420 - 00:25:21.612, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, that was like one of the first things I ever did on Dune and it took me a while to figure out. So that's kind of my, my point of view on Dune. Obviously there's a level of SQL that you need, but given you have some SQL knowledge and you're, or you're willing to learn SQL, like the, the bulk of it is just diving into these contract event and calls and like, just experimenting and figuring it out. And, you know, you can match things up with other sources like etherscan or, or whatever, and you just kind of figure it out until you got it right. Then you learn as you go. But that's been my process.
00:25:21.756 - 00:25:33.160, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's the story for a lot of the doom creators. We are all basically ether scan detectives, but we are able to put that in code afterwards for sure.
00:25:33.500 - 00:25:40.428, Speaker B: Exactly. Do we have a second to look at a couple more things?
00:25:40.484 - 00:25:44.500, Speaker A: Yeah, sure, sure. This is really interesting.
00:25:45.360 - 00:26:30.236, Speaker B: So I just wanted to show, this was the first project I worked on was this, like I mentioned when I came into the co op was cohort retention curves. And I actually didn't do this in Dune originally. I wrote a base like exposure query in Dune and then downloaded the data out of it. And I did all the visualization stuff in r because I was just more comfortable. And then over time, I got all processed here into. This is just really, I mean, this was one of the original ass and it's really awesome to keep track of over time. Like, you know, as we launched in September and you can see like holders that start that, that got their initial exposure to DPI in September.
00:26:30.236 - 00:26:34.972, Speaker B: You know, we're still, we still have over 50% of them with exposure.
00:26:35.076 - 00:26:38.040, Speaker A: That's so. And you can just see such a good statistic.
00:26:38.500 - 00:27:05.940, Speaker B: Yeah, you can see what's cool is as these grow as cohorts come over time, we're just getting, we're getting more and more sticky. So now, in April, we've made a little, just a tiny jump in May, and then June, we've made a little jump at the front end of this. So this is a really good indicator for us for DPI. And we have this for MVI. And we're working on a version for the fly products as well.
00:27:07.890 - 00:27:08.522, Speaker A: That's great.
00:27:08.586 - 00:27:43.430, Speaker B: That's just one of my favorite things that I've built because it was like the first thing. So I wanted to show that and how that, that just helps give us. Gives us confident that we have product market fit with a product. And then these are interesting. So we've broken out holders, DPI holders, by their amount of exposure. So if they have less than ten dpi, ten to 49, 52, 49 or 250 plus. What's really interesting is we're almost at 10,000 holders with less than ten dpi, you might consider them retail.
00:27:43.430 - 00:28:56.268, Speaker B: And this is really interesting because when you look at the amount aum of those same groups, the whales are 250 plus they have 41 million in AUM. And looking at the percentages over here, they're about 50% of all Aume comes from those 200 holders. And this is interesting because seeing this in DPI was what actually prompted the co op to double down on the fly products. When we started seeing this was right around when the fly products were being conceptualized and showing this is like, look, we are gaining retail adoption, but the reality is most of crypto is still driven by whales and traders and crypto natives. Right now, in our evolution, what's going to help us grow is building products for traders and whales and sophisticated crypto users. It gave us a lot of confidence going all in on and saying, let's build e two x fly. Let's build BTC to Xfly.
00:28:56.268 - 00:29:04.884, Speaker B: We have a proposal out for inverse EtH fly and more fly products to continue because that's just where the market is right now.
00:29:05.052 - 00:29:24.640, Speaker A: Yeah, interesting. That's a really interesting insight. So you're basically, you're not trying to target retail, but rather you're building crypto products for crypto native people. And I think a lot of other projects should think about that as well. It seems to be. Yeah, one. One big old circle joke at the moment.
00:29:24.720 - 00:29:48.306, Speaker B: Yeah. And I would say, like, we. It just. It makes us be a little bit more picky. Like, if we want to launch, launch big products, which is a goal, like, up front at the onset of our project. Like, the goal is to launch products that are really successful and there aren't. It just helps us understand right now there's probably not a lot of products that are going to be really successful with retail focus groups.
00:29:48.306 - 00:30:04.822, Speaker B: Not to say we shouldn't explore them. Right. We did launch MBI, which is growing and is capturing an awesome market. And we're close. We have another proposal. The bet index went through DG two. It's in the building phase.
00:30:04.822 - 00:30:24.820, Speaker B: It should be launched soon. And then we have one that's about to go to DG decision gate one. So we are still launching and focus on index products that might appeal to retail audiences. But again, it just helped give us confidence that the market we're in right now, the fly products, would be really successful. And that's been the case.
00:30:25.440 - 00:30:34.020, Speaker A: Yeah. Eth fly has been a huge success. I think at least it looks like that, just looking at the data.
00:30:37.840 - 00:31:08.036, Speaker B: Yeah. Last. So one more insight, and I'm happy to do more of these, but I don't want to bore anybody a couple other cool views that I think are really helpful. And I just want to highlight other use cases like and how the analytics ring group has driven values. Like, we have these market prices versus nav views for both DPI and NVI. This is all time hourly, 30 day hourly. And this is by minute for the last three days.
00:31:08.108 - 00:31:09.880, Speaker A: Probably like native asset value.
00:31:10.500 - 00:31:12.156, Speaker B: Yeah. The net asset value.
00:31:12.268 - 00:31:12.532, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:31:12.556 - 00:31:31.610, Speaker B: Okay, so let me, let me see if I can search this really quick. So, like, if you look at the Bitwise ten, this like index product by bitwise, they have a. Let me see if I can find it. See this chart right here? Can you see that?
00:31:32.670 - 00:31:33.430, Speaker A: No, we can't.
00:31:33.470 - 00:31:36.030, Speaker B: This is basically saying, can you see this?
00:31:36.070 - 00:31:39.090, Speaker A: All right. No, no, it's loaded.
00:31:39.730 - 00:32:30.876, Speaker B: So with their index product, for almost all of time, the market price of their index product has been at a huge premium, like 50% premium. Like, you're paying $84 to get $48 worth of assets. So our business development team and our institutional sales team, they're talking with institutions and VC's and whatnot about our products. And this was one thing that they asked for, because showing how tight our market price to the NAV is at all times, basically, this is just due to the efficiencies of DeFi. This is like a selling point. And a lot of people start to get DeFi a little bit better when they see this. It's like everything can stay with arbitrage and the efficiencies that are brought in line there.
00:32:30.876 - 00:32:51.880, Speaker B: Like our market prices stay right online with net asset value. And this has been awesome for them to show people and continue to peak interest amongst potentially bigger buyers on both DPI and NBI. So that's an awesome use case and something we've built.
00:32:53.460 - 00:33:03.200, Speaker A: And that's all done by arbitrage bots. Right. And you didn't write those arbitrage bots yourself, but rather it's just some third party that profits off of this who does this for you, basically.
00:33:03.870 - 00:33:04.590, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:33:04.670 - 00:33:12.930, Speaker A: Yeah. That's really, that's really interesting and cool to see. You don't happen to have, like, statistics on those plots, right?
00:33:14.030 - 00:33:18.014, Speaker B: Not in any dashboards, and I haven't done any analysis on our bots.
00:33:18.062 - 00:33:27.654, Speaker A: Now that would be interesting to see. But I guess you would just see like, hey, they make like, x profit on this, but, yeah, I mean, and.
00:33:27.782 - 00:33:47.126, Speaker B: We floated the idea. It hasn't been executed, but, and I think other protocols have thought about this of like, can we whitelist arbitrage bots and capture that opportunity ourselves? Is that a good idea, a bad idea? I mean, that idea has been floated around, but it hasn't been a priority of ours, of the co ops at this point.
00:33:47.238 - 00:34:22.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess if it works, it works. Of course you could probably get some revenue out of those bots, but I don't know, I'm not too deeply involved with that so that I could make a good statement. Yeah. Cool. This has been great showcasing of your analytics, and you've already done quite a lot of work that I want to ask you about at this point, I think. Let me switch back to the presentation and I can ask you a few more questions for sure. So let's get back to my.
00:34:22.250 - 00:34:52.910, Speaker A: Yeah, so we've covered all of this. That's great. So first of all, why are you guys so successful at surfacing this data? And why is there such a focus on data at the index corp? Is that something that you've shaped or is that something that comes. I guess there's no CEO of index, but is there the core team that's really pushing this, the. What's the story here?
00:34:53.650 - 00:36:26.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I think a lot of that can be attributed to just the, well, the core team that did kind of create the co op from, from set labs and they continue to contribute and other contributors have. Come on. It's just like, data has always been a priority. And I mean, that's the simplest way to put it, because when I came in and started contributing, right, like, they made a call for contributors and initially, and in the first, like, this is when there was like four or five really core contributors, and one, they called out a couple things and one of them was analytics. And so it's always been a been a priority for people at the co op. I think in daos, within a DAO in general, it's really interesting because when things are so like bottom up in the structure of a DAO, data and truth objectivity, I guess I should say objectivity can become so important because you have lots of different opinions, like in the forums and discord floating around about what strategies we should take on X or Y or how we should solve this problem. And the whole idea behind analytics working group was like, we want to always be injecting objectivity into the DAO through our KPI's, through working with other working group leaders that are trying to make decisions.
00:36:26.350 - 00:37:05.734, Speaker B: That's just always a priority. And also we launch lots of products. And if you think about traditional tech startups that launch even one product or two products, especially ones that launch multiple products, we're essentially the product analytics arm that sits next to engineering, making sure that we have proper measurement on our products, because we need to be able to understand if they're performing well or not, and how we might be able to capture the next stage of growth. So combination of all those things, I.
00:37:05.742 - 00:37:23.060, Speaker A: Would say, yeah, that's a great way to put it. That like, amidst all the chaos of discord conversations and Twitter and the hidden web of telegram groups, basically you're trying to be the source of truth by surfacing this onshined data. I really like how you put that.
00:37:25.080 - 00:38:42.300, Speaker B: I would say really quickly, I would say that that's actually one of the harder things to do. The easier part is building a KPI's dashboard, and that does a certain level of what I'm talking about, injecting objectivity. But most of those types of things are more short term or ad hoc requests. And it's like, for example, it's like, hey, our engineering team is trying to decide, this is a recent one, they're trying to decide if uni v three is safe and ready for us to add it as a dex when we're trying to rebalance our fly products, because we need to be confident that if we need to rebalance quickly to avoid liquidation risk, that we have the liquidity there. And their worry was, if eth goes in a spiral and you have ranged liquidity positions on v three, will the ranged positions keep up with the price, or would we be put in a bad position because the price drops out of range so fast that we lose liquidity? And so that was like a one week process of like, not necessarily building a full. Like, we did build a dashboard, but it wasn't, like, supposed to be this ongoing dashboard. It was very focused on, like, let's solve this one problem.
00:38:42.300 - 00:39:13.400, Speaker B: And not that those are necessarily harder to solve, but the management of those is harder for an analytics working group because we have eight contributors, all contributing anywhere from two to 10 hours a week. But you have to figure something out pretty quickly and something new pretty quickly. So that's. That's always the challenge. And I think our next stage of growth as a working group is figuring out how to do those. Those types of tasks more efficiently, more quickly, and more regularly.
00:39:14.700 - 00:39:29.164, Speaker A: Interesting. Yeah, I kind of remember there was actually the case that some uniswap v three positions weren't, like, in range anymore. Right. So how did you actually end up deciding? Or is that.
00:39:29.212 - 00:39:50.894, Speaker B: Yeah, so I want to, you know, this is a good place. I mean, to shout out, obviously, the community here and the community in the dune community, because we weren't the first ones to really build this. I think it was. I only know the discord, the Twitter or Twitter handle or discord name Ulissa, who I don't know is on here.
00:39:50.982 - 00:39:52.638, Speaker A: He's been doing great work with the univ.
00:39:52.694 - 00:40:27.910, Speaker B: Three. He did. He kind of kicked off that work and really was the first one that I saw putting out stuff. And one of our contributors, deep, who's on this call, he was actually did a lot of the legwork here and he actually got on a couple calls with USA and, like, worked through some stuff. So it was really cool to see the help from outside to understand how to query and look at v three. And we're still working on it. But, yeah, we were able to plot price impacts for a few pools on both v two and v three over the past few months.
00:40:27.910 - 00:41:16.132, Speaker B: And then, just like what we did was we plotted liquidity, a total liquidity in the ETh USDC pool, and we did this for a few other pools, but total liquidity, and then also the liquidity, that was what percentage of liquidity was within 2% of the price, what liquidity was in 5%, what liquidity was within 10%. And what we found was, like, even with price drops, roughly 25% to 35% of liquidity, even if price was moving around and was volatile, was within 10% of the price range. And it gave us some confidence that, you know, this. This is safe enough for our purposes to just to actually add v three as a. As a method.
00:41:16.316 - 00:41:32.090, Speaker A: So, yeah, that's a, that's an interesting story. So you're both taking care of like the long term, like North Star metrics. But what you're struggling with right now is basically like responding to these ad hoc requests that would be important for the, for like other working teams.
00:41:32.590 - 00:42:08.852, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. I mean, I would say like keeping up with KPI's now that we have the foundation is very minimal. Part of our working group. Most of what we do now is like, we do keep up with them. We have to keep maintaining them, like I said. But we have, we're interfacing with all the other working groups and constantly getting requests like, hey, I really need to understand this data and answer this question. And so I try to, you know, we're trying to manage all their contributors and their time and like, and making sure we're trying to fill the most high priority gaps across the co op.
00:42:08.996 - 00:42:30.700, Speaker A: Yeah, interesting. Yeah, I guess we've already talked about this a bit. So I guess the data is a big part of the governance process. Like in general, I guess you've said that with like we try to be the like injection of objectivity and stuff like that. Is there any like really particular decision that is worth telling here?
00:42:34.520 - 00:43:45.290, Speaker B: I think the big, like a big one was like this, this fly product, like Uni V three on the fly, but also just generally like we've been doing a lot of work on Uniswap v three lately to, we're trying to refine our whole liquidity management strategy at the co op. Right. With the introduction of Uni V three and the capital efficiencies there, that changes the game for us a little bit and we can start looking at options that don't require us to incentivize liquidity. So we're working on a lot of, we're working on strategies there and that requires a lot of analysis. So that's big. We actually, interesting, like we've done analysis on our governance process itself. So like all our main decision gate votes for products, we've analyzed all the wallets contributing or voting their voting power and we've surfaced those insights to like show like the level of decentralization in our voting and, you know, how we can better reach quorum and things like that.
00:43:45.290 - 00:43:49.930, Speaker B: So those are a couple of examples.
00:43:50.310 - 00:43:57.410, Speaker A: Like meta governance analysis. That's really cool. So I guess you're voting on chain or is that snapshot data?
00:43:58.190 - 00:44:15.728, Speaker B: That's snapshot data for the RDG two votes. That's essentially. So that's actually not using Dune because we're just downloading CSVs and that's been done in python but, yeah, another example of just like more ad hoc tasks.
00:44:15.904 - 00:44:23.140, Speaker A: Yeah, I can totally see that. Yeah, we need snapshot data on Dune. That would be, and that would be quite cool.
00:44:23.880 - 00:44:25.344, Speaker B: Would be, yeah.
00:44:25.432 - 00:44:42.100, Speaker A: So I guess, like you're using this to like influence marketing, like, your governance process quite a bit. But like, do you purposefully, like, put this out for like marketing reasons for like the actual index tokens or is that something that you're not concerned with at all?
00:44:43.960 - 00:45:02.704, Speaker B: I would say, like, net, I mean, maybe there's some secondary effects when it comes to marketing for index tokens. I think in general, though, one thing I found which has been really interesting is like, crypto Twitter. Crypto Twitter loves analytics.
00:45:02.792 - 00:45:03.460, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:45:04.840 - 00:46:11.790, Speaker B: I'm like, you know, I only have like 500 followers or something. And before I only had like 300 or 250 and I started putting some regular, like, the first time I did like a thread on DPI retention a while ago, like back in December, and like, it gets almost a hundred thousand impressions because it's just crypto Twitter eats that stuff up. And so one secondary effect of like, our KPI's and like, the work we've done is like, you get other core contributors and other people, you know, that are contributing in any capacity. They're copying and pasting dune charts and they're putting them, they're tweeting them all the time. It's like it builds a lot of content for our products, which that's been more of a side effect. But there's probably, and there's probably a lot of more work to do intentionally to do more marketing and content related work from the analytics working group.
00:46:12.250 - 00:46:36.750, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Interesting insight. Yeah, that has been my experience as well, that people just love charts and love data. I think it's something to do with your source of alpha, basically. I oftentimes have really small accounts following me. I always think they're probably hoping that I give investments, investment tips based on data. At some point, that's not going to happen, but I think there's something to that.
00:46:37.170 - 00:47:19.000, Speaker B: Well, that's, I think that's exactly what it is. It's like to be like most of us were everybody's new, right, to crypto. Yeah, relatively. When we think about other industries and whatnot. Like, everybody's new to crypto. So when you can get some like, concrete data showing any narrative people like, it resonates with people because it provides some sort of confidence in something in a space where we typically aren't always confident in what's right or wrong or what's going to succeed or not. So I think there's levels of that, but it's like this alpha phenomenon for sure.
00:47:21.660 - 00:47:44.030, Speaker A: And I had a point just now, I forgot it anyways, so I think I can just open this tweet up for a second. So you had a big investment from Galaxy Digital, I think, and some other thing that I don't know. Do you know if the dune data and the work of the analytics group has been a big part of that conversation?
00:47:45.570 - 00:48:30.040, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm trying to remember the exact, the exact tweet here. Maybe I can give me like 2 seconds or the exact message. So, come on. So big sky, he's a full time contributor at the co op, and he messaged me on June 15 and said, on Discord, he said he was leading, he led this wholesale, this whole investment deal. And he said, dude, every single investor call I have had for the OTC sale, I've had your dune dashboard open on my second monitor.
00:48:31.220 - 00:48:56.960, Speaker A: Great. Yeah, that's what I, as a Dune employee, obviously love to hear, people using all that dashboards and data in general in productive ways and actually making decisions based on data and not on some crappy narratives that somebody just spins up out of nowhere. Yeah, that's great to hear, for sure. So it actually had a substantial impact there, I guess.
00:48:57.620 - 00:49:32.290, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I think in helping investors understand the co op, understand our products, understand what we care about, what our goals are, I think all the KPI's in our dashboards, they help people understand, but then they also tell a great narrative and a great story. Like, there's a lot of growth there, a lot of revenue, there's all these things. Help them tell the story, tell the narrative, make the pitches, and answer the questions. That's been a really neat use case to see for all the work we've done.
00:49:33.110 - 00:50:14.240, Speaker A: Yeah. And your KPI's throughout the board, they just look amazing. I don't think I've seen a dashboard that looks more bullish than the index core KPI's. Like, obviously not, not financial advice, but, yeah, it's always great to visit your dashboards and, yeah, I'm always happy, happy to see that you guys are succeeding so well. And I'm really impressed by the operation of the index corp in general and, yeah, just very happy that that works so well. Yeah, I guess that was the spiel with Index Corp and Dune. Is there anything you personally want to add?
00:50:16.260 - 00:51:28.556, Speaker B: I just want to add, I guess, first off, want to shout out again, like, all the contributors at the index co op on the AWG the analytics working group, that's the strength. Like, the contributors we have, they're smarter than me. And so I like to think I have some skills and maybe some ability to coordinate and manage, but like we're getting just really high level, really talented people come in and I take on tasks, so just wanted to shout them out. And also, you know, as far as next steps, I wanted to just mention if anybody here on the here listening has ideas and wants to message me on discord. Like the bigger question that we're facing as a dower as an analytics working group is how do you actually, as we scale, how do you manage and run like a distributed slash open source analytics function? Because there's really not like a playbook for that. Like, open source software development is not the same as open source analytics. Analytics within analytics, like scopes are always changing.
00:51:28.556 - 00:52:46.480, Speaker B: It's not like software development. Scope is controlled a lot more and analytics is a lot more ad hoc, a lot more agile. There's a lot more movement. We have a GitHub repository where we manage our code, where we keep track of tasks as issues, and we have a project board, but it's just like a continual iterative process for us to try to learn week over week or month over month. How do we grow together and really, how do we really run an open source analytics function? That's always on my mind. I'm curious if anybody has thoughts or opinions, if you want to dm me and I think I've given you this feedback, but I think Dune has a unique opportunity when it comes to daos to cement themselves as part of the DAO stack by continuing building tooling that supports teams within a DAO, or organizations for that matter, without, while maintaining the individual identity on the platform. But that could be a crucial part of a DAos toolkit for sure, is helping learn or helping teams scale and be an efficient analytics function.
00:52:46.480 - 00:52:50.480, Speaker B: That's my last couple points. Now I can be quiet.
00:52:51.100 - 00:53:38.888, Speaker A: No, no, it's been great. Yeah, that's something that we should probably like we as Jun, that's something we can really improve on and that we are thinking about constantly, like how to enable teams to collaborate, collaborate better on Dune and how to manage their code and stuff like that. That's all something that we are thinking about and definitely hope to make easier for you guys in the future. And I think I'll dm you at some point for any feedback on ideas that we have. Actually. Interesting that you are thinking about this as well already. Yeah, just challenges in on chain data I think you've also been through this experience of, like, you see some data on Twitter and then you just think like, hey, what the fuck is this? I guess that must have happened to you.
00:53:38.888 - 00:53:56.260, Speaker A: It happens to me like every few days. And why do you think that is? Why is getting blockchain data that is so widely available and you can just go on Etherscan and look at the data, but why is it so hard to actually do all of this?
00:53:57.720 - 00:55:00.462, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the biggest learning curve, honestly, is you have to start understanding how smart contracts work to start to be efficient and good at on chain data, just because the data you're working with is emitted from whatever calls or events or data that's published on chain. And so that to me is, that was the biggest challenge for me, was jumping in and being like, I need to look at exposure through Uniswap. But I don't really know actually how uniswap works. Like, inside the smart contracts. Right? And not that you have to know the smart contracts back and forth, but like, the practice of, like, going into dune, looking at the events, like, really going through them, understanding how, like, what, what each event is and when it's happening. Maybe you're cross referencing that with the smart contract, like, getting those reps in. It starts to get easier to work with on chain data.
00:55:00.462 - 00:55:29.282, Speaker B: But that's the biggest learning curve in my mind. And there may be steps the community can do to maybe ease that burden on newer users or people coming into analytics and looking at on chain data. But in large part, the people that are willing to go through those learning curves, those are the ones that find that there's a lot of opportunity here and there's a lot of success can be had here. Yeah.
00:55:29.306 - 00:56:13.810, Speaker A: So I guess what you're mainly talking about is the composability of defi, that, like, every product is interconnected with every other product. Like, your DPI token is, like, available on cream and it's on uniswap, and it's like, it's in some liquidity mining programs, then basketball swings around and, like, tries to, like, vampire attack you and, like, you always need to, like, there's always more smart contracts and more stuff to be. To be learned. So I think that that's also, like, that's still a challenge for me because, like, once you have the main stack in your pocket, basically you're like, hey, I know ave Uniswap comp. I have the big ones. And then some smaller competitors come again and you need to relearn. So it's a constant process of reiterating and learning.
00:56:14.710 - 00:56:39.840, Speaker B: And then right after you get uniswap down, they launch Uniswap in three minutes. And it's different. Right. It's just DeFi or crypto move so fast, and the complexity of the composability is definitely something that brings challenges, but I guess that's the price we pay for the advantages of Defi and crypto.
00:56:40.300 - 00:57:08.070, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think as the space progresses and as dune scales up as well, we can make a lot of things easier. We can take a lot of complexity out of this composability, but right now we are just, we are swamped with work and it's just very hard to find accurate representations of all the edge cases as well. So, yeah, we'll try to make it easier, but, yeah, it is what it is.
00:57:08.410 - 00:57:21.030, Speaker B: You've done a great job. You've done a great job. You guys are doing an awesome job. I hope it's clear that at the co op we absolutely love doing, and it's been such a great tool for us.
00:57:21.460 - 00:57:37.200, Speaker A: Yeah, glad to hear that. So I guess, as the final question, what suggestions do you have for other projects or teams to launch these in depth analytics capabilities like you have at the index corp?
00:57:40.820 - 00:57:45.440, Speaker B: Yeah, I think the.
00:57:48.800 - 00:57:52.220, Speaker A: So I guess, yeah, talk. Sorry.
00:57:54.240 - 00:58:40.570, Speaker B: I was just going to say, I think that. I think, like, it's kind of similar to the alpha phenomenon, but like, there's. There's always opportunities within your project, within your dao, to increase, either increase transparency or increase objectivity. And the more you show that, the more value that's going to be. Um, so, so the more you're willing to, like, do the work, the more that value that's going to be and just continue to be a proponent within your dao of, like, we. We need this within our organization and try to get resources for it, but, um, and then don't, like, be willing to pull other. I feel like the thing is, like, I was even too slow, probably, to, like, reach out and get more contributors on board.
00:58:40.570 - 00:58:56.870, Speaker B: Right. Like, there's a lot of talent out there and there's a lot of people that are capable of supporting. And the synergies that you get from doing that can create just a lot of success for analytics teams.
00:58:56.910 - 01:00:16.326, Speaker A: I feel like, yeah, I think just to add my personal take on this, because I see so much happening in the doom community, I think the approach of the index corp is actually pretty unique, that you have set up the infrastructure and the whole team and an analytics workgroup, or those are interchangeably basically, but I think you're pretty much the only Dao that has that. And if anyone from any project is listening or will listen to this in the future, I can only recommend you to set up the proper infrastructure and set up processes and the working group like the index DaO did, because that seems to be working really, really well. Like I said before, I think you guys are probably the best. I think you're utilizing your on chain data perfectly and in ways no other DAo is doing at the moment. And I think that's a huge, I don't know how much it contributes to your success, but I can imagine that running an organization that is basically just transferring data throughout the world and not being blind, so many daos are just blind. I often go to other projects just to check them out or because I've aped into some pool, I'm just like, guys, where are the fucking analytics? You are absolutely blind. You have no idea what's happening inside of your pools.
01:00:16.326 - 01:01:14.562, Speaker A: How do you even manage to, how do you manage your product? You need data to manage your product. Every startup would be bankrupt in months if they wouldn't manage their data properly or make sense of their data. But in deFi, because so much money is slashing around the system, projects come and go on a minute basis, almost like it doesn't seem to matter too much. But teams who are able to utilize their data and do utilize their data usually have more success. So, yeah, I can only, of course, I talk for myself, I talk for Dune, because it's like, of course we profit from if more people build dashboards in Dune, but really, we are providing really valuable infrastructure for these teams. And as you've said in this call before, like, it's, it seems to work really well. And, yeah, it's just, I can only beg the teams to like, please take care of your data well.
01:01:14.666 - 01:01:47.750, Speaker B: And I would, I just add really quickly first, appreciate the comments. I think we're, we're, we're learning as we go. We're trying to do the best we can and it's, we're evolving. But, um, the, the other challenge and the other thing I would push for is like, it's hard to be user centric in crypto. Like, just the first, the abstraction that we don't know who owns what addresses. Like, just that alone, basically, kind of like people feel like, well, we can't really know who our users are. But, like, the problem is you can have the same TVL.
01:01:47.750 - 01:02:28.610, Speaker B: Two projects can have the same TVL, but one can be dramatically more healthy than the other. And if you don't put the effort into, like, try to understand who your users are, like, how they've interacted with your project or your protocol. Are they sticking around? Are they coming and going? Things like that? That's what I think drives the valuable insight and projects that find ways to be user centric. Even in crypto, they operate on the best information, and they'll capture markets better than those who don't. That's the premise that we go by and we're trying to continue to improve on at index co op.
01:02:29.610 - 01:02:43.370, Speaker A: Yeah, that's great. So, yeah, I think we're gonna invite our wizards into the conversation. If you have a few more minutes. I think we set this for 1 hour.
01:02:43.410 - 01:02:50.030, Speaker B: Yeah, I got some minutes. If anybody has questions, I'll try to answer.
01:02:53.820 - 01:03:01.040, Speaker A: Yeah. How to organize this? I guess just unmute yourself and talk. We'll figure it out.
01:03:08.460 - 01:03:09.244, Speaker C: Hello.
01:03:09.412 - 01:03:10.160, Speaker A: Hey.
01:03:15.020 - 01:03:16.220, Speaker C: Am I audible? Hello.
01:03:16.300 - 01:03:16.660, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:16.740 - 01:03:17.400, Speaker B: Yep.
01:03:18.020 - 01:03:31.010, Speaker C: Yeah. Hey, guys. Very, very interesting conversation. Thank you so much for this. So much of alpha being shared here. I just want to understand. I think this question is for cook in particular.
01:03:31.010 - 01:03:52.330, Speaker C: Is there a way for you to also showcase traditional analytics metrics that traditional finance companies generally use or traditional finance index indexes that they use with. With index scope?
01:03:55.790 - 01:04:02.050, Speaker B: Do you have any, like what? Do you have any examples like, what kind of metrics you're referencing?
01:04:02.350 - 01:04:18.162, Speaker C: For instance, a lot of traditional companies generally look at p ratio, price to earnings ratio. They look at price to sales ratio. They look at a bunch of, they look at cash flow statements and a bunch of more things. So these are some metrics. Help them make decisions.
01:04:18.186 - 01:04:46.110, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I see. So, like, yeah, okay. I understand what you're saying. Yeah, we do. We actually. So I don't know if we have any of those, like, built on Dune or whatnot. We do have a dedicated, like, jack here's on the call, like, dedicated to our treasury working group, and that might not be exactly it, but we definitely have the capability to, like, view to maybe build those metrics out.
01:04:46.110 - 01:05:21.710, Speaker B: This is kind of, I talked about this earlier with the index token. It hasn't been a large focus yet of the co op, of, like, showing, like, the index token and the project on its own hasn't been a huge focus. Right. Like, we've been very focused on the products we launch and their success. But I think in time, we'll probably, we'll probably need to build more transparency around, like, those types of metrics for us as an organization or as a DaO or akin to what a traditional company might have.
01:05:23.810 - 01:05:34.670, Speaker C: Right. But generally, do you think metrics like that make sense for an end user like me to look at when I want to make my investment decisions?
01:05:35.770 - 01:06:12.470, Speaker B: Oh, I see. I don't know about your investment decisions. I do think that they can make sense if you're just evaluating protocols, I think that they can make sense to evaluate efficiencies of projects. Whether you're doing strict valuations. I don't know. I don't know if I have a strong opinion on that. But I do think they can be good directional signals of, like, how efficient a project is running or how big of a market they're attacking and things like that.
01:06:12.470 - 01:06:22.330, Speaker B: So, I mean, I'm not going to say I'm an expert in this or anything, but my personal opinion is there's definitely some value in those.
01:06:22.830 - 01:06:25.250, Speaker C: So, Greg, thank you so much.
01:06:25.710 - 01:06:55.070, Speaker D: Hey, this is Jack. Just hopping here because I'm actually working on it for next co op. If you're looking for live financial statement type things, Elias Simos has a really good one for Nexus mutual. These things are really hard to build. He did a fantastic job putting this together and it's like. I think this is like the gold standard for any sort of cash flow or any protocol that already dao, that has cash flow. If they can build one of these, it'd be amazing.
01:06:55.070 - 01:07:21.690, Speaker D: They're very hard to build. So I would not recommend doing it yourself. Or you can get a dao to pay you for it, which is what index is doing for me, I guess. But then otherwise, if you're looking for those sort of metrics on a sort of snapshot basis, I think Massari is a good example of an analyst group that does these things and does the valuations on an ad hoc basis. So that's what I recommend.
01:07:22.310 - 01:07:24.690, Speaker C: What's the name of the company that you recommended earlier?
01:07:25.590 - 01:07:26.530, Speaker D: Masari.
01:07:26.830 - 01:07:36.290, Speaker C: Mesari is more of a research. It's more of a research company that they give about reports. Research reports, right, exactly.
01:07:36.330 - 01:07:37.658, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
01:07:37.834 - 01:07:44.050, Speaker C: Right. Any. Any site that you recommend which gives out like financial statements for crypto or daos?
01:07:44.090 - 01:07:52.274, Speaker D: No, what I'm saying is like. Like Dune and the stuff that Elias was building is like the cutting edge of it and it is like. It's much harder to do and it's really.
01:07:52.322 - 01:07:53.350, Speaker A: It's really difficult.
01:07:53.690 - 01:07:54.386, Speaker C: Right.
01:07:54.538 - 01:08:11.320, Speaker A: Thank you. So Makerdao also has. Has a. Has a dashboard that's. That's quite good. But I don't think it's as detailed as was Ilias has done. Yeah, that's something that I want to enable more, but I think we need a bit more supporting tables to be able to do that.
01:08:11.320 - 01:08:45.820, Speaker A: There's a lot of long tail assets that don't have price feeds. I think JD can probably sing a song about that. I think there's a lot of manual price queries in his queries and it's just not scalable enough to do this right now. So once we launch coingecko prices and we get prices for Uni V, two tokens and stuff like that and tokens that are deposited into Aave and yeah, there's just a lot of long tail things that still need to be fixed before that gets easier.
01:08:50.360 - 01:08:51.100, Speaker B: Right.
01:08:51.720 - 01:08:52.820, Speaker C: Thanks a lot.
01:08:55.289 - 01:09:21.009, Speaker A: Any more questions? I guess that's a. That's a no. Are you talk. Are you trying to talk Dilliondem?
01:09:22.740 - 01:09:23.940, Speaker C: No, I wasn't.
01:09:24.060 - 01:09:44.828, Speaker A: Okay. Okay. Yeah. So again, thank you so much, JD, for taking the time and walking us through here. I think this has been a phenomenal showcase of what Dune can enable for daos and how you're utilizing the data. And I'm really happy how this turned out. You've done like, you've been a really cool guest.
01:09:44.828 - 01:09:50.390, Speaker A: Thank you so much. And I. I guess that marks the end of the stream.
01:09:51.250 - 01:09:58.870, Speaker B: Yeah. Thank you. It's been fun chat and appreciate all the work you all do at Dune and happy that we could chat today.
01:09:59.770 - 01:10:00.690, Speaker A: Thanks. Bye bye, everyone.
