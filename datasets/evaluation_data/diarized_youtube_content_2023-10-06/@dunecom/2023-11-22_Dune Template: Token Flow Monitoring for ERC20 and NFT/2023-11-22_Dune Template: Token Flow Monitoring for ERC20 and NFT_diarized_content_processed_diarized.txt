00:00:00.560 - 00:00:48.160, Speaker A: Started to grab it then remember what's up everyone? Welcome back to another day of Dune template. Last time we talked about how to use template to find the link holder movement for top chain link holders. Today we'll expand on top of that and show you all tokens template. Then we'll turn our attention to pudgy penguins, the remarkable NfT collection that turned around from turmoil to being on the shelves of Walmart. We'll show you how to use another one of the template to sleuth out which top pudgy penguin holders are bullish or bearish. All in under five clicks. Alright, let's get started.
00:00:48.160 - 00:01:30.642, Speaker A: So per usual we will click create new query and then we'll start with template. So here you already see we have four different templates under the tokens category. So they're for different types of tokens. You can track ERC 20 type of token, you can track NfT type of token, so 721 or 1155. And then you can choose to track the token flow for either a contract or a wallet. So for our purpose today we'll do wallet balance and flow monitoring of the NFT token. So we click use this template and already the default option is already pudgy penguins.
00:01:30.642 - 00:02:08.250, Speaker A: But if you were to look for any other things, this is where you would change it. And then make sure to define the blockchain that you want to track this NFT collection on. And then you can change define the period you want to track this for and try to define. Hey, how many pudget penguins a person need to or a wall a wallet need to hold to qualify as a top holder. So once you do all this definition, we will be ready to go. So per usual I will click on large engine just to make it run faster. So let's wait for a little bit because it is doing a lot of computation on the background for us.
00:02:08.250 - 00:02:47.580, Speaker A: All right, looks like we have our results. So if we rank by the token in. So who actually bought a lot of token? It looks like this person, whoever it is, is really believing in punch penguins right now and have bought in 40 pudget penguins. Wow, probably some plan this person is brewing up right now. And let's see who have dumped the most. Okay, so there's a multisig which dumped seven pudget penguins and that only has one. And then a bunch of people with ens names.
00:02:47.580 - 00:03:07.580, Speaker A: Bullish bag. Okay, bullish bag is not very bullish on the podcast penguin seems like. All right, that is it from us today. So pick a token, pick an entry collection you're interested in and go try out the tokens template today and ask us and let us know what you found. Cheers. See you next time.
