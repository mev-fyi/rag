00:00:01.360 - 00:00:21.690, Speaker A: Welcome, everybody, to a new episode of the weekly wizard. And today I'm joined by Denning from the Ox project, or the Ox network, and Macha. And, yeah, I'm really happy that you found the time. And, yeah, it's always great to get talking to some wizards. So welcome to the show.
00:00:22.670 - 00:00:29.250, Speaker B: Thank you for the invite, Boxer. I'm glad to be here, and thank you, everyone, for coming and joining.
00:00:31.090 - 00:00:42.390, Speaker A: I think it's always interesting to hear the stories of how people got into crypto. So maybe if you could tell us about your first touch point. What notified you of crypto? How did you.
00:00:43.570 - 00:01:29.342, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think I was really lucky that I was just in school in the data science master program, and then through the program, there was a course about learning, spark, hadoop, all those big data stuff. And then I would need to find a course project with my project made. And then we were like, blockchain data is like big data, so maybe we should take a look on that. And I try to apply some machine learning stuff, data science on it. So one thing we were trying to do is to de anonymize the wallet addresses, which is still a problem right now. It's still a miss right now. So we were, like, looking to the data, and then Joe Lubin from consensus, he was having a talk in our campus, and we came up, asked questions.
00:01:29.342 - 00:01:41.626, Speaker B: He was, like, super generous, saying, I could connect you with our data science team in consensys. And then that's how I end up with an internship and then full time. So that was the start of my journey.
00:01:41.818 - 00:01:53.490, Speaker A: Wow, that's a pretty interesting stuff. Usually it's all the people, like, we're trying to make, like a quick buck or something. Like, that's usually the story. You're just like, yeah, I was actually here for the tech. Like, yeah, exactly.
00:01:53.570 - 00:02:21.202, Speaker B: But honestly, I think there's a nuance there. So it's like I was doing something data science at that time. Everyone was still like, oh, machine learning, AI is a future and stuff. So, like, I was not awoke saying, I know the. I realized the value of blockchain when I entered it. I was totally, like, just lucky to get into it. And then, honestly, like, the first year, or maybe the first half year, I consensus when people ask me, so what's the difference between bitcoin and ethereum? I didn't know how to answer honestly.
00:02:21.202 - 00:02:43.120, Speaker B: So, like, only gradually, after maybe a few months, almost like after a year, and when I actually got into the topic of, like, Dex, and then there was some topic, like TCR token curated registry and then cryptokitty as well. And I realized it's fun and it's also, like super deep, honestly.
00:02:45.660 - 00:02:50.360, Speaker A: So I guess this was 2016 then, like, just from the names you dropped.
00:02:50.900 - 00:02:52.844, Speaker B: Yeah, 17, I would say.
00:02:53.012 - 00:03:06.690, Speaker A: All right. And so back then there was no dune and probably there was, like, very little other data providers. So, like, did you actually run a full node at consensus and just like, query that node or, like, what kind of solutions were you using?
00:03:07.510 - 00:03:28.150, Speaker B: Yeah, so, Voxer. So this is an interesting topic. So the team I joined is a data science team at Consensys. So that was literally a competitor of doing analytics. So, like, we were trying to do actually, whatever. Nowadays, all the data providers trying to do, the team was called Alethio. We have like a great team of like, the engineers.
00:03:28.150 - 00:04:01.626, Speaker B: Most of them are based in Romania. My director, how does my direct manager, he also taught me a lot. He's based in Germany. And so we were trying to do either scan plus do analytics plus potentially the graph and all kinds of data service. And we were running nodes. Initially the team was doing something called Estat, which was a very useful tool for a lot of the early miners to monitor node situation, the network.
00:04:01.778 - 00:04:10.110, Speaker A: So what ended up happening? Like, why are we on the Dune podcast today and not on the Eliot podcast?
00:04:11.250 - 00:05:01.112, Speaker B: Yeah, so I think the team had great technology, but I think that was a great lesson that we expanded too much in terms of the business strategy. So we're doing everything. But also it was kind of early, and then back then there was a bear market in 2018. So it was really hard for a team, data team to generate revenue back, back then when, like, uniswap just started yet. It's a pain point that I see that, like, if you are a data team, your customer mostly are potentially the Dapp developers. And then if the Dapp team is too small, then they haven't had the fonts to purchase external data service yet. If they're mature enough, they probably have like, a good, solid hand of engineer to build the nodes themselves.
00:05:01.112 - 00:05:10.956, Speaker B: So that was like a really kind of, like, I was a dilemma for data service provider back then, but nowadays it's totally the booming time for data, I think.
00:05:11.108 - 00:05:29.200, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Now there's actually, like, there's so many, like, different businesses that it's like, it's very self evident that there's, this is like a service that people could use. Okay, that's, yeah, interesting. Interesting to kind of get a glimpse into that history because, like, I wasn't around back then. Like, I was like, I was aping shit coins. Like, I didn't care about data.
00:05:31.900 - 00:05:33.560, Speaker B: I wish, I wish I.
00:05:37.960 - 00:05:45.700, Speaker A: So, yeah, I think we haven't covered what are you working on today then?
00:05:48.040 - 00:06:33.718, Speaker B: Yes. So I think my career focus had a little bit shift in terms of what exact data I try to analyze or decode back in consensus and nowadays in Xerox. So back then as a consensus, because it's also like very general industry kind of, how to say all around kind of. I would say like the data I was analyzing back then were more like industry level research. So it's like back then it was like comparing how decentralized it is, comparing Ethereum versus other chain stuff. And then all kinds of topic. And back then there was one topic that really picking up like attention for me is Dex.
00:06:33.718 - 00:07:30.496, Speaker B: So there was like one article that I started in my analysis journey on Dex data is like we looked into a few typical Dex protocol. Back then, Xerox was using order books still. And then I did some visualization of like how those Dex user and Dexs are connected, potentially with some overlap. And then, so I realized that the DAPP team, the application team in this space is pretty much the frontier engine for actually pushing forward what's going on and what's the direction for the next few, next few months, next few years. And then I was like, I want to join a DEx team. And then, oh, there was an interesting thing also. Like back then with the data team we were in, we developed small like MVP called where should I trade? Because that was a hackathon in Germany.
00:07:30.496 - 00:07:51.026, Speaker B: So that it's de, it's like, where should I trade? So that was like. And then basically it's like people come to the website, they say they want to trade USDC to WTH and then we can tell them, oh, so the best price is on IDEX, ether Delta or. Yeah, Kyber or something. And then nowadays I realize it's an aggregator.
00:07:51.128 - 00:07:51.770, Speaker A: So.
00:07:53.550 - 00:08:39.472, Speaker B: Yeah, so, okay, yeah, so now at Xerox, when I joined, there was one data scientist, Kroger. He built up a few data infra and pipeline stuff. So when I joined, he shifted to engineer role. I was more like maintaining the data engineering pipeline and then also covering all fronts of like reporting internally, also externally working with Dune, also a few other data providers. They would for example like bit query or other block c, those data provider, they will have to source the volume of Xerox or matcha. So you have to work with them to help decode, decoding, attribution stuff. So yeah, pretty much everything but the last one year, 2021.
00:08:39.472 - 00:08:54.460, Speaker B: I'm sure it's like crazy year for every team. So our data team expanded from two person, two people nowadays, like six people. So my responsibility is reduced to more on chain data part, I would say.
00:08:56.200 - 00:09:05.820, Speaker A: All right. I think many people will not really be familiar with what the ox network is doing. So maybe if you could give us a brief overview of what that is.
00:09:06.600 - 00:09:11.460, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm not sure if you're trolling saying ox or Xerox, but I'm joking.
00:09:13.250 - 00:09:14.950, Speaker A: What's the, what's the correct name?
00:09:15.610 - 00:09:41.676, Speaker B: Oh, Xerox. No, yeah, I'm joking. So, yeah, Xerox has been in the Dex space for a long time. And like 2017, I would say. And the team started with like an order book model. So basically it's like whoever come to the protocol, you can be somewhat submitting an order nowadays. It's like limit order.
00:09:41.676 - 00:10:46.750, Speaker B: And so basically you are basically making an order, and then we will put the order into like a pool. And then once there is a match, saying you are trading a to b, the other person trading b to a, then that's a match, and you get your taker of the order. So like a maker and taker make an order. And so that was an order book model. And then with the rise of Amm, including uniswap Sushiswap, we gradually realized that order book can be more efficient if it's integrating the liquidity from Ammdez, because it's pretty dynamically adjusting the price, and you can always find a backup option from a pool. And so Xerox started to do aggregator by comparing different sources of the liquidity on Dex. And then, so then gradually we developed this API, Xerox API, where you can access the swap endpoint and then basically say, I want to make a trade, and then we will get you the best price across different Dex liquidities.
00:10:46.750 - 00:11:39.170, Speaker B: So that was I guess, like two years ago. And then later on, the team realized the big money in the traftify. Like market makers, they can actually even more efficiently sense the dynamics or the movement of the market because they're actually actively arbitraging across different platforms, and they can provide even more competitive quotes for the users compared to AMm. And then, so nowadays, the Xerox API that is still like an aggregator comparing prices, is including both our audiobook and also AMM and also our request for quotes, kind of quoting from market maker. So, yeah, that's the current model. And so Xerics API is basically the main product for Xerics. But then the team realized.
00:11:39.170 - 00:12:24.418, Speaker B: So we work with all kinds of dapp, including Xero Zapper, Metamask wallet, Coinbase wallet, wallet. Whenever they want to access Dex liquidity, they just call our API. So in a sense, our customers is more like to be at the moment. And then the team realized we could manifest how to say retail app could better use API. And then, so we built matcha like a year and a half ago, I would say. Yeah, and then, so matcha is like a front end. And how does it front end like a website, you go to matcha XYZ and then you make a trade and then we will get you the best price still like through Xerox API.
00:12:24.418 - 00:12:30.510, Speaker B: And also with the landscape changing, we went to multichain nowadays.
00:12:30.970 - 00:12:43.490, Speaker A: Yeah. And like, why is it called Zero X network? Like what, what is the network aspect there? Like, do you actually, like, do you store it like kind of on chain? Do you like submit proofs on chain? Like, how does that whole thing work?
00:12:44.270 - 00:13:16.284, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, I think the team definitely think thought about like putting everything on chain. But history proved that on chain is not efficient enough for making the trader with best, with good price. So we are still like the pricing part is off chain in terms of like the price comparison. We definitely fetch the price from on chain from like all those amm pools. And then, but then our backend is off chain, but then the settlement layer is on chain. So.
00:13:16.372 - 00:13:23.160, Speaker A: Okay, I see, I see. Yeah, so, yeah, that's interesting. So if I go to.
00:13:26.100 - 00:13:27.320, Speaker B: Sunrise there.
00:13:29.510 - 00:13:39.970, Speaker A: It looks good. So if I go to metamask and metamask swap feature, then I will literally just call the Ox API or like metamask. The Ox API for me.
00:13:40.790 - 00:13:55.130, Speaker B: Yeah, that is correct. But also, you know, nowadays the wallets, they would want to get, they want to try the best to get the best price for users. So they are not only calling our API, they are also calling one inch. So they are literally like an aggregator evaluator.
00:13:58.510 - 00:14:05.370, Speaker A: Wow, that's interesting. And the same probably applies to what Zirion and Zapper are doing.
00:14:06.550 - 00:14:16.450, Speaker B: I'm not sure that specific two teams, but Coinbase wallet is likely as well. And Carl swap is for sure. Frank analysis protocol.
00:14:19.430 - 00:14:39.610, Speaker A: Okay, that's very insightful. I never really thought about it that way. So you are basically taking care of the on chain data for everything or like most of the things that happen on chain for the ox network. Is that kind of a correct statement?
00:14:40.910 - 00:15:21.470, Speaker B: Yeah, I could say that. Also we have an internal data pipeline that is fetching the on chain data externally. We are also using Doom, sometimes some other data providers as well. It has different reasons. It's always a lot of overhead for a Dapp team to like how to say, pour the full copy of the blockchain data. It's giant and it's a lot of maintenance, you guys know there. So the internal data pipeline is only fetching that the things that's relevant to Xerox, like all the transactions that Xerox exchange proxy sent.
00:15:21.470 - 00:15:51.590, Speaker B: So that is helpful for internal data metrics and stuff, like to reporting to the reporting of volume and reporting of user number and stuff. But then dune is super helpful because it's like coverage of the whole blockchain as well as also like so many other teams already do the attribution there. So if you want to do market share comparison or like user comparison, or if you want to check if our user overlaps with one inch a lot or something, that will be doomed.
00:15:51.630 - 00:16:13.760, Speaker A: So yeah, yeah. Maybe we could actually jump into, into some of the dashboards that you made on the DeX aggregator market. I guess. I think I saw a dashboard there and just like get a few thoughts about how do you actually work with these results. Let's get into.
00:16:13.800 - 00:16:14.420, Speaker B: Yes.
00:16:16.320 - 00:16:17.380, Speaker A: Hopefully it works.
00:16:18.720 - 00:16:20.420, Speaker B: I'll share screen 1 second.
00:16:22.560 - 00:16:23.380, Speaker A: Cool.
00:16:25.350 - 00:17:15.338, Speaker B: You can see screen, right? So let me see. So here is one dashboard that's on my personal account that is called Dex aggregator. There always been some discussion about how the data should be attributed, but let's dive into a general idea here. So as we know, Dex aggregator is like a specific, how to say, widget on top of different liquidities. So we, we are sourcing liquidities from all those stacks. And then the teams that are doing similar things are the biggest one are like one inch and powerswap. And so also this is etherea only where what we see is that you see like over the time.
00:17:15.338 - 00:17:51.078, Speaker B: So this is a more full, how to say history of all the DeX aggregator. One inch was super early and they started like 2019. And then after almost a year, Xerox started but using the API service, providing us API service. And then later on Paraswap started. So nowadays I would say one inch is still like the dominant one, that is over 50% of the market share in terms of volume. And then Xerox is like the second around 32% of market share. Yeah.
00:17:51.078 - 00:18:22.136, Speaker B: So this is how the current landscape look like. There are a lot of like, how to say, nuances here about the data. So one thing I do add as a filter here in this dashboard is I am excluding the wrapping volume here. So as I said, I'm excluding all the. So first of all, east to east doesn't make sense. Wth to wth doesn't make sense. But just for generic purpose, I'm just like excluding all of them.
00:18:22.136 - 00:19:14.150, Speaker B: Specifically, wrapping volume means ease to weth or unwrapping weth to eth. So in our team we were like discussing, oh, turns out the wrapping volume can take a large percent in some other aggregators. So we were like, this doesn't really make sense to how to say, demonstrate the user needs because it's possibly, it's always accompanied by a trade. If the user want to maybe swap how to say swan to swap ease to another token, and then they have to get onboarded through a wrapping volume. So yeah, that's one thing. There's another thing that is also controversial. I would say like there are some discussion is that people are saying aggregators, we should likely to exclude the hops.
00:19:14.150 - 00:20:08.152, Speaker B: So what is hop like? So nowadays aggregator has so many complicated logic. We do a lot of complicated things. For example, multiple fill is one thing, which is pretty straightforward, is like when you want to make a big trade, let's say you want to trade 1 million USDC to WTH, we will find maybe 500K liquidity from Bancor, 500k liquidity from Uniswap, and make you two fails. So when we count the fields, first of all, some people make a confused stake on a count that has two trades. So that's multiple fields, that's one thing. The second thing is the hop thing. So like if you are trading a super illiquid pair, let's say, what would be an example, I don't know, like a super unknown new DeFi token a to token b.
00:20:08.152 - 00:20:54.846, Speaker B: And then we found out, oh, the price is super bad, or at least, or there's no pool like that at all. To trade between these pair, we will find you something like a to Wth and then wth to b. So that will be a bridge in between, that's a hop in between. So different aggregators, when they settle this trade on chain, they can settle it differently in execution. So what we do is we tend to not log a specific event, so to save some gas for the user. But then in this case, when I decode the data, I will have to maybe go down to the uniswap event and grab that fill and then go to the other liquidity source to grab that field. And then in this case I will be actually doubling the volume.
00:20:54.846 - 00:21:04.574, Speaker B: So that's one issue right now still existing in the aggregator space. So yeah, that's multi hop people are talking about.
00:21:04.742 - 00:21:07.450, Speaker A: Yeah. So you are indeed counting the volume.
00:21:08.750 - 00:21:53.190, Speaker B: So we are making sure not duplicating for most cases, but there are still some cases that we're duplicating it. But I think it's also depending on how you are interpreting the data. So if we're counting multi hops, I think the volume does still represent the protocol's execution capacity on chain and the smart contract's routing capacity. But if you're counting that volume and saying that's the actual user requested needs, that's not true then. So if you are trying to measure the user demand in terms of volume, then you would want to dedupe the volume. So I think it's also depending on how you interpret the data.
00:21:54.120 - 00:22:22.690, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. As long as there's like a consistent method for like if you're using the same method for all the different aggregators, I guess you can, you can reasonably make, make these comparisons. But yeah, that just shows, like if you like, when I started working with blockchain data, I was like, hey, this should all be like really clean. It just gets produced by computers. Like how cool is this? There's no input issues and stuff. And then you like actually get down into the weeds and you're like, holy shit, there's a lot of edge cases.
00:22:23.430 - 00:22:41.278, Speaker B: So yeah, especially like what we do with Dune right now in the Dex abstraction, repo, it's like you want to standardize something, but like each team is executing a different way and maybe innovative way, but then it's hard to standardize.
00:22:41.334 - 00:23:13.244, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Interesting. Yeah. And it's also like super interesting for our side that like this is such a like sought, sought out. Like Dune is such a thought. How sought after product sort. What is this word? The Dex aggregators, like Dune? Like, that's what I'm trying to say because it's like it enables you guys to like not only look at your own data because I guess one inch has like their own like the internal data plan balance as well.
00:23:13.244 - 00:23:37.040, Speaker A: But then if you want to look at everything like Banker and Uniswap and Uniswap V two, three, sushiswap and then all of these super fringe dexs as well, then it's not feasible to do this on your own. So our product comes in very handy there. So it's super interesting to see the Dexter traits abstraction evolve with the help from all of these teams.
00:23:37.500 - 00:24:00.984, Speaker B: Yeah. I want to say though, one thing really interesting is that thinking about that repo that everyone's contributing to. It's a DAO with an incentivizing incentive mechanism because everyone want to be well represented, but then everyone's trying to do governance on other people's volumes. Like, hey. And then nag you in the pr, like, fix this data.
00:24:01.072 - 00:24:41.272, Speaker A: So yeah, it's a dao. Yeah. It's a jointly managed repository which is basically. Some wars are being fought in there. It's pretty, it's pretty funny to read through there sometimes. So can you open the Dex metrics dashboard of Frederick? So in there, just to put this into perspective, for those people who are unfamiliar with the Dex space, the aggregator Dex share volume, or the aggregator share of Dex volumes, actually 27%. So it's actually, it's a giant, giant market.
00:24:41.272 - 00:24:50.824, Speaker A: So in the last, like, I guess seven days, 30 days. What is this? How much volume do you guys make? Oh, there it is.
00:24:50.952 - 00:25:17.374, Speaker B: Yes, here we go. It's like a few billion casually. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Seven days, a few billion. Also, it's like totally different. A year ago, I felt the past year, it's being booming in terms of volume and number of users as well. One thing though, is that one ironic thing is that whenever the market crash, good time for us to see the volume.
00:25:17.374 - 00:25:24.090, Speaker B: It's like the peak time for the volume. So it's always picking up in the bloody market as well.
00:25:25.110 - 00:25:37.180, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. People need to get out of their positions, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The chart on the left, like, could you, could you comment on like, the colorfulness?
00:25:38.760 - 00:25:50.880, Speaker B: Yeah, it's awesome. I think. I'm sure. Also the color has been growing a lot over the time, so. Oh, yeah, yeah. You want me to comment on the color?
00:25:51.040 - 00:26:03.460, Speaker A: No, no. Like, how many, how many different dexes there are now? Like, what's your, what's your opinion on this? Is this actually like, is this real innovation or is it just like these hundred forks are just like trying to grift?
00:26:04.720 - 00:26:41.400, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I mean, nowadays here it shows like 20 ish something or even, plus there are even more. Some smaller teams, they're not yet working with them or like, they didn't and they haven't figured out the landscape they have to go to poll yet, so. But yeah, I see uniswap being dominating. I think Sushi's volume has been going down and there's recently, but Sushi always has been like number two or three in terms of Dex Amm. And then curve has been under the attention only through the words and stuff. We also looked into curve data.
00:26:41.400 - 00:27:09.920, Speaker B: They are definitely having advantage over the XY equals to k design when it's a super fluctuating market based on their curve design. So yeah, those are like the big names for Dex Amm. And then I think it's always like one inch or Xerox falling to biggest aggregator. Oh yeah. But I think this chart is, I think this chart is only Dex.
00:27:10.340 - 00:27:18.920, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. It's not included because then we would have like a bunch of very duplicated volume if we would include dexs.
00:27:19.540 - 00:27:49.602, Speaker B: Yeah. That makes one good thing. I think one thing that is interesting in aggregators data that it can also showcase the competitiveness of Dex is that when we are comparing the price, basically we're comparing which decks have a better pricing. In this case, if liquidity from Uniswap is sourced more, then that means has a better liquidity source. It's a fair comparison for the pricing for all the EDX amm.
00:27:49.746 - 00:28:16.340, Speaker A: Yeah. Do you have data on where you are routing to? I think one inch has said data somewhere. So maybe we can look at Anton's dashboard if you don't mind. I think k zero six a. Yeah. Are you logging this data internally? Probably, right?
00:28:18.800 - 00:28:32.376, Speaker B: K zero six a. Oh yeah, yeah, we're logging it internally. I think he's doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:28:32.408 - 00:28:34.180, Speaker A: One inch exported volumes.
00:28:36.600 - 00:28:37.632, Speaker B: Right, right, yeah.
00:28:37.656 - 00:28:39.856, Speaker A: So this is Uniswap v three pretty.
00:28:39.888 - 00:29:40.840, Speaker B: Much, yeah, I think so. It's based on their design of the pool where also specifically the one BPS pool creation that has been like enabling a lot of potential there. One also interesting angle that some people may use it for analysis is that when Uniswap's liquidity is sourced more, it's likely because the LP is not actively moving their liquidity according to the market movement. So it's possible the higher capsule efficiency is at the cost of LP's impermanent loss because the price wasn't, how to say, matched towards what the market is showing as a middle market price. And then basically the liquidity provider is giving out a very bad price for themselves. Things like that. And then there are so many IB trash bots is like eating their liquidity at them.
00:29:43.860 - 00:29:55.280, Speaker A: Is uniswap struggling? I mean for the LP's, it should theoretically be a good thing if there's arbitrage bots, right? Like if the bots just like trade into uniswap pools all the time. Like they, they get the fees from that.
00:29:56.740 - 00:30:22.730, Speaker B: Yeah, they get the fee from them. But let's say they put into the liquidity for like east to the USDC at a, at a price of, I don't know, like $2,000 ETH and, but then like the market moved crazily to $3,000 east, one east, and then they, they could have like withdraw the liquidity and maybe sell it somewhere else with a better price compared to that.
00:30:22.810 - 00:30:23.114, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:30:23.162 - 00:30:25.750, Speaker B: So that was like impermanent loss, like, I guess.
00:30:26.970 - 00:31:05.924, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. The Uni V three. Yeah, it's, it's more of like, it's a platform. Like if you go on there personally and you try to make some, like, I have some, like, I know, I know some people who are just like, yeah, I'm like LP ing and like small cap shitcoins and like, that's usually working out pretty well. But like if you go into like Eth, USDC or something, like, you'll get wrecked. As like, as a retail user, if this is not like your, like, if market making is not your job, it's no longer like it. The innovation that this has brought forth is pretty incredible.
00:31:05.924 - 00:31:16.360, Speaker A: If you look at how much liquidity or with how little liquidity, how much volume share Uniswap V three is taking, it's absolutely amazing.
00:31:17.340 - 00:31:42.196, Speaker B: Yeah. Actually we did some research on it. I totally agree there. Actually, the one bps pool or five bps pool is much more active than the larger bps pool. The capital efficiency could be like something at five digits, percent, some things like that. It was boosted into some crazy number. Yeah.
00:31:42.196 - 00:32:09.160, Speaker B: But as you said, the USDC pool and WTF is definitely not for the retail. It's like super Active and also the biggest market maker. I mean it's known their name, address is labeled so market maker like Wintermute and stuff. They're actively market making. Not really market. They are market making with aggregators. Like they're providing quotes with the aggregators as well as they're also eating as arbitrage bots on the liquid.
00:32:09.160 - 00:32:11.424, Speaker B: So they are like trying to get the both sides.
00:32:11.552 - 00:32:20.660, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's, I need to get one of those people on here. You need to read like five books on market making before, I guess.
00:32:21.800 - 00:32:22.464, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:22.592 - 00:32:47.090, Speaker A: To like even be able to ask questions. So yeah, that's a pretty interesting dashboard. I'm actually surprised, like why is it that the one Bps pools do not like on the chart on the right top, that you're one above that? I think, like why is there no, where's the one BpS pools?
00:32:47.550 - 00:32:55.290, Speaker B: The one bps port? It seems like the liquidity range is pretty off from the market, middle market.
00:32:55.410 - 00:32:55.786, Speaker A: Okay.
00:32:55.818 - 00:33:05.830, Speaker B: I think it's, it's possible that like it's being, how to say, it's being consumed too quickly, but yeah. Needs more, more to be confirmed.
00:33:06.410 - 00:33:24.190, Speaker A: Yeah. So, yeah, so to get back to this, like the Dex aggregators are basically a good indicator of like which, which mechanism is working best.
00:33:27.330 - 00:33:47.954, Speaker B: I think so. And that would, that would be. Yeah. Specifically also to the pairs, you know, or the, specifically to the pools they're providing. Like Mim was definitely showing up only on curve and stuff. And also there's another condition. Only if the aggregator is comparing the price fairly.
00:33:47.954 - 00:33:54.706, Speaker B: Right. Without any prejudice towards any like buyers, towards any like prioritize any.
00:33:54.858 - 00:33:57.510, Speaker A: Hmm. Has there been debate around that?
00:33:59.690 - 00:34:17.590, Speaker B: I don't think there's been a debate around that, but I would imagine if any aggregator, they come up with their native liquidity or I don't know, their own users limit order pool, it's probably, it could be a design, but it's not confirmed that.
00:34:18.770 - 00:34:30.230, Speaker A: Yeah, I see. Yeah, that would be, yeah, like you would need to communicate that clearly. So. Yeah. Not something I've thought about before.
00:34:30.970 - 00:34:35.210, Speaker B: Yeah. In that case, aggregator evaporator can also double check.
00:34:35.370 - 00:34:55.352, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, but yeah, the problem with like especially metamask is like they swap, like they charge this huge fee. So it's like wherever you end up trading, it's like you get a like really bad quote anyways because just metamask takes like think something like 0.5% of you or something, or even higher. I don't know.
00:34:55.416 - 00:34:58.700, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah. Like 875. Yeah.
00:34:59.080 - 00:35:00.660, Speaker A: 0.875.
00:35:01.600 - 00:35:03.848, Speaker B: Yeah. 0.875.
00:35:03.904 - 00:35:23.420, Speaker A: Yeah. That's almost a percent. That's, that's really bad. Yeah. I think we've covered the Dex aggregator market, so maybe what's your favorite dashboard on, Yoon, besides what you are personally working on at the moment?
00:35:25.280 - 00:35:43.936, Speaker B: I see my favorite one, Dex metrics is the one that I go to the most and then I like that one a lot. What's the other favorite one, if I may take a look? Other than the one I work on, you mean.
00:35:43.968 - 00:35:48.860, Speaker A: So, I mean like are you not fan fangirling around someone like.
00:35:50.680 - 00:36:34.640, Speaker B: Well honestly I'm a fan girl of Anton because like he's like just super quick updating all the one data. Yeah. I try to talk to him sometimes. Like I was like, hey, this volume might be, needs an adjustment because it's also a lot of overlapping between also aggregators because one inch also used to use our own chain smart contracts so to settle their trades. And then, so one of his query is using like the xeric table that I built and then we shifted the table with like, version stuff. And I was like, you will need to change to that table. And then when I send the message, like, you're not his friend, you cannot talk to him.
00:36:34.640 - 00:36:43.960, Speaker B: Yeah. After a year later or something, like, he accepted my friend request, so, yeah, I'm a finger.
00:36:44.660 - 00:36:45.440, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:36:46.540 - 00:37:06.390, Speaker B: I mean, recently I've been seeing, like, a lot more, like, crazy stuff from NFT space and. Oh, and I really like the EIP 1559 dashboard from Michael. Sarah Bloom. He's, like, generating all those parameters with the new features.
00:37:07.370 - 00:37:36.050, Speaker A: Yeah. Michael is basically programming June. You don't give me an API, like, let me build this myself. It's pretty amazing to see what kind of, like, I think he comes up in every episode because I'm his number one fan girl. Yeah. The innovation that he's bringing to our platform is like, it's. It's madness.
00:37:36.050 - 00:37:56.410, Speaker A: He's just putting us on a whole other level. And now what he's doing. Have you seen, like, have you looked into the optimism extraction repo, what he's doing in there? He's basically like, what we. What we've done as a community for, like, ethereum, he's just doing on his own for optimism. It's just like, what the fuck?
00:37:57.610 - 00:38:14.650, Speaker B: Yes. Yes. Thanks to him. So the other day I was at the. I was like, oh, Michael is, like, committing every day so actively, and I looked into it. So basically he was building out all the infra tables on optimism, like putting the token metadata, token prices. And then.
00:38:14.650 - 00:38:26.822, Speaker B: So I was like, oh, then this easy. And then create the xerics volume on optimism, like, fairly quickly with his table and, like, no issue. So it's. It's widget. It's awesome.
00:38:26.926 - 00:38:46.050, Speaker A: Yeah, he's a. He's a, like, I've learned that grand wizard is a really bad word in the US. So he's not a grand wizard, but he's a great wizard. Yeah, how's the. How's the multi chain, like, move for the ox network going?
00:38:47.030 - 00:39:14.206, Speaker B: Yeah, I got that dashboard. So, yeah, Xerox has been trying to expand to multi chain since last year. March 2021. March. So the first one. The first move was finance smart chain. And there's been so many challenges since we moved to multi chain because it's.
00:39:14.206 - 00:39:48.364, Speaker B: A lot of the chains are much faster in terms of block production. So, for example, binance and polygon are both, like, two or 3 seconds production. It's a challenge for the data info. I'm sure you guys know. It's like how often the crown job to check the chain as well as a real issue. So as far as I know, I think Polygon is the one that could be most headache. So I was joking the other day when Polygon raised like crazy evaluation.
00:39:48.364 - 00:40:23.938, Speaker B: I was like that should be distributed partially for all the teams that is building on polygon for their data infra cost. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So imagine like I think they, they have something like three hour kind of finality time and then translated into blocks. It's like over 3000 blocks. And so it's impossible so to do the reorg check in the regular way. So the regular way we do could be probably not that smart. One is that we just make sure we will scrape to the top tip of the chain.
00:40:23.938 - 00:40:49.160, Speaker B: But then next time when we, we will remove the like the last 30 blocks or the last blocks that is potentially reorganized. But then that's not possible to do with Polygon. So you will always have like sanity check to check the blog hat, transparent blog parent hash and stuff. So it's challenging. Our infra is also improving. I guess so. Yeah.
00:40:49.160 - 00:41:47.114, Speaker B: So that's one aspect about multi chain. So whenever Xerox API is expanded to multichain, the logic is that we will need to deploy the smart contracts on the new chain first. And then we will do the API side to enable it to be able to actually access different chain. And then on the matcha side we will enable the front end so people can actually make the trade on different chain. But I would say a lot of chain, when we try to decide which chain to go to, we will do the research in terms of how many users there already, how many transactions that is happening every day already. But it's also depending on how many liquidity source there are. So like if Uniswap and Sushiswap is not going there, or like the large liquidity pool is not going there, then there's no meaning for aggregator to no price to aggregate there.
00:41:47.114 - 00:42:28.892, Speaker B: It's going to be bad price for users anyway. So we will have to go after the Dex Amm usually I would say logically, yeah. And then now talking about Solana, it's like chain. So it's like even more, so much more to learn. It's like a few data stuff that I learned that is like totally different context in terms of what we talk about for the metrics. It's like first of all, when you talk about number of transactions, a lot of the data we presenting, the number of transactions is including the validators. So it's like 80% of some data on Solana beach or somewhere.
00:42:28.892 - 00:43:14.096, Speaker B: It's showing that those are mostly the POS validator that is voting for confirming the blocks. So when you talk about transactions, you want to be aware what's the scale you're actually talking about. And then also, there's another thing that the Solana token program, it's designed to be that when one wallet, they have a token holding, it's like some kind of address is generated. And then if you have another token in this same wallet, there's another address rated associated to that. So when you talk about, when we talk about number of addresses, it's not same concepts as number of wallet users, even. Yeah, not even talking about number of users. Not even the same number of wallets.
00:43:14.168 - 00:44:02.320, Speaker A: I would say, yeah. The concept of Solana is just radically different from what Ethereum is doing with, like, storing a global state. And in Solana, they have, like, this account, I think accounts, they are called account system. And it's just like, yeah, when I first looked into Solana data, it's like, I was like, oh, what is, what is it? Yeah, we will all need to, like, the data analyst community will all have to learn this. Or like, I guess some of us will just be like, yeah, like, I don't care. Like, I will stay, like, EVM focused because, like, I frankly, I frankly think that it's like the EVM space is already getting so big that it's like, for most of us, it's probably like the better move to just be like, hey, I'm going to specialize in this. And then there will be other people popping up, which can be the Solana specialists.
00:44:02.320 - 00:44:35.624, Speaker A: I kind of need to learn it because of this. If it wouldn't be for that, I would probably stay being an EVM specialist just because DVM is also already very complicated. And then, like, trying to learn all of the Solana stuff. Yeah. Seems really hard. But maybe Solana data will actually be easier because, like, what kind of problem we are facing on the Ethereum blockchain oftentimes is like that we are not, like, we can't access the storage diffs on Dune. Right.
00:44:35.624 - 00:45:01.010, Speaker A: And I think in general, that's a very hard problem to solve. I think there's one team in the space who's trying to do this now. And I'm really excited. Like, I'm actually like, yeah, I'm just excited to see that when it goes live. But yeah, it's a real problem. And maybe the account system that Solana is doing because the global state is basically in these accounts, so maybe it will be easier for us, daytime, but we'll have to see.
00:45:01.950 - 00:45:21.696, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes total sense, I would imagine. I mean, as an analyst though, I would want to, like, I want to get famous with the Solana dashboard on doing it so you wouldn't stop people from analyzing EVM too. So just like all those big vc's, they are like, we won't make it on ethereum, so we're gonna Solana to make it.
00:45:21.728 - 00:45:54.702, Speaker A: Yeah. New generation of Dune wizards will be Solana wizards. I mean, that could happen. That could happen. And yeah, like, we'll have to see, like, how fast we can develop, like, certain, like, certain query meta and like, how easy it will be to fork, like, different queries of different people. But I think most of the stuff that's happening on Solana is like, it's this one Dex anyways, which is called radium, and like, is it called radium? I don't know. There's one Dex which just has like a shit ton of different front ends and.
00:45:54.702 - 00:46:10.060, Speaker A: But like, the backend is always the same. So it's like, it all, like, I think 80% of the transactions are basically like this one Dex, which just has these different front end. So it, like, I don't know, it doesn't sound too complicated if you, if you think about it at first.
00:46:11.520 - 00:46:18.660, Speaker B: I see, I see. So sounds like a uniswap of Solana. I think I heard some name of like, serum and okra.
00:46:18.960 - 00:46:54.266, Speaker A: Yeah, it could also be serum. Yeah, yeah. See, like, I don't know much about Solana yet. Yeah. But what I was originally like, or a question that came to mind is like, so the Ox network has this API already. So are you looking at doing cross chain stuff eventually where you're like, we can. Somebody submits an order for 500,000 in ether and then you are like, hey, we can actually make this trade cheaper on polygon and bridge back to ETH.
00:46:54.266 - 00:46:56.310, Speaker A: Is that something you guys are thinking about?
00:46:57.390 - 00:47:39.378, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yes, totally. Crushing has been a big topic here as well for research. There could be different way to implement it. Also, like, in the scenario you just mentioned, it's possible the user may just want the token back in polygon network, or maybe they still want the token back in ethereum. But then we found a better swap hop through another network. It could be crazily complicated, but I think from how to say initially we had some thinking of, like, what if we don't do any extra infra kind of hustle, but just like the market maker to market make through different chain.
00:47:39.378 - 00:48:11.062, Speaker B: So, like, they will do their rebalancing through chain across the bridge themselves every day or stuff. So that would be like a automatic, like, economically incentivized widget to bridge the cross chain functionality. So that's one thinking at the moment. Moment. Another thinking is like, basically use protocols like cross chambridge, like hop protocol, or any other, like infra. I think we're considering multiple at the moment to figure out what would be the best option. And then so to.
00:48:11.062 - 00:48:32.098, Speaker B: Whenever user want to trade through different chain, we basically do all the things like how to, say, bridge the asset and then do the swap there. Something like that. But then the recent. Recent. What's that wormhole thing? Makes us really. How to say. I wouldn't say hesitating, but then want to be more cautious for the step we take.
00:48:32.098 - 00:48:56.108, Speaker B: So maybe. I think Xerox has always been. Honestly, we wouldn't want to be chased trained to be the first one to do this here or there. I think we are more cautious and be responsible for all the partners working with. So it could be a. We may just observe the landscape and see what's being stably developing and then decide.
00:48:56.204 - 00:48:59.880, Speaker A: So, yeah, fast follow our strategy, basically.
00:49:00.820 - 00:49:02.092, Speaker B: Yeah, that's.
00:49:02.236 - 00:49:21.852, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's also, like, there's, like, so much complexity involved already. And then if you factor in, like, reorgs. So if those happen and you have done, like, a multi, like, chain swap, then it's like, you're basically saying that. I go like, what are we gonna do? So, it's very complicated.
00:49:22.036 - 00:49:34.684, Speaker B: So, yeah, that is true. Like, with the finality time, like, mathematically, you wait for the longest finality time. Yeah. So, yeah.
00:49:34.812 - 00:49:42.880, Speaker A: Need some good insurance. What. What else?
00:49:43.820 - 00:49:46.604, Speaker B: Or we just let the jump capital to invest everyone.
00:49:46.692 - 00:50:09.520, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Reasonable. Reasonable. I don't know if you've seen this, but you've probably heard the story of there's this couple who stole 3.6 billion bitcoin. And there was one schema how those FBI agents tracked the different wallets. Have you seen that?
00:50:11.540 - 00:50:21.870, Speaker B: I haven't, but I would imagine it's like some kind of mixing detector, like, whoever traded with this address and then, like, looking like a Sankey diagram.
00:50:22.290 - 00:50:43.890, Speaker A: Yeah, it was basically a flow diagram. And Monero was somewhere in there, and I was actually, like, really surprised. But you don't happen to have insights into, like, how. How. Like, not, like, how to decode Monero, but, like, just, like, bitcoin and Monero tracing in general. Is that something you're kind of familiar with? With. Probably not, right.
00:50:44.430 - 00:51:13.076, Speaker B: Not. Not much not much, but yeah, like the very back then that the anonymized project was basically like trying to do something like this. Like trying. I'm not sure if this exact same though. Like assuming they will be, they will have to transact their wallets, but they will do some mixing pattern, like they just transacting with some random irrelevant wallets as well. And. But you get like a connected component in a network graph and then you can basically get all of them.
00:51:13.076 - 00:51:16.212, Speaker B: That is relevant. I don't know if that's the idea here.
00:51:16.396 - 00:51:47.356, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Like maybe you would, like, I thought maybe you had seen the flowchart. I'll send it to you after the podcast. It was pretty, like, I was just very surprised that like, they were able, like they went through like a few different mixes, they went through Monero and like through like 20 different wallets and they were still able to be tracked. So I just thought that that would be like, like, it's just interesting. Like the state engineers seem to be pretty good. Seem to be getting pretty good.
00:51:47.356 - 00:52:25.100, Speaker A: So everyone out there who's safe, who feels safe behind tornado is like, you should think twice. Yeah. Yeah. I think this has been a very insightful conversation. Maybe if you could wish on a star, what feature would you like to see in Dune next? We've announced a few features during our series B announcement. So other than that, what would be a feature that you would really like to see?
00:52:25.720 - 00:52:50.512, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Dune has been super helpful doing the education part, hosting that our network SQL course. We literally found our recent data scientist through that course. He joined us like this week. He was a super crazy, how to say, actively, crazily active member in that course, deepang Zhao. Yeah, so we're lucky to.
00:52:50.696 - 00:52:51.208, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:52:51.264 - 00:52:58.376, Speaker B: Yo, like, is Dune is pushing the space? Yes. Yeah, he's joining us. And so, yeah, my question is that.
00:52:58.448 - 00:52:58.880, Speaker A: That's great.
00:52:58.920 - 00:53:44.640, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, like, Dune has all the stuff that's needed for like, a newbie to enter the space as a data expert, as the career go. So maybe we could do something like knowledge graph or, you know, some kind of, like, how to say, like, I would imagine where you can go to Dune and then find out, like, oh, these are all the best dashboards of NFT. And then these are all about Dex and these are the things you need to know about Dao and stuff. And so, and then curating more, that kind, kind of onboarding new ns kind of thing. That would be awesome. That would be exciting. And see, you guys can also like, develop like career platform already.
00:53:46.140 - 00:54:30.436, Speaker A: It's actually amazing how many people of the 34, 30 course have jobs now or are very successful in this space. We have hired one as well, or like two if you count. Like, we've given a freelancer grant out to Chuchin this morning and we fired someone else. So, yeah, those people are really going places. It's really amazing to see. And, yeah, I fully agree with your take on knowledge creation. I think Dune could become more like a Wikipedia style thing where it's different what's already kind of happening in the dexter trade, where different people try to find truth.
00:54:30.436 - 00:54:53.260, Speaker A: And that's something that I've very actively been thinking about for the last few weeks. And we'll definitely start trying to tackle that. And then there's also, like, I think it needs to be like a different kind of ui thing where it's like, we just curate certain dashboards. So, yeah, I'll probably hit you up about that.
00:54:54.240 - 00:54:55.032, Speaker B: Sounds good.
00:54:55.136 - 00:55:05.350, Speaker A: Sometime offline. And also, like, education. We're also like, we fully see this and it will be my mission. I'm Professor Dune now.
00:55:07.250 - 00:55:28.844, Speaker B: I mean, also, the dune discord is like stack overflow for the blockchain data occurring. You open up a tab for forum. I imagine people would even, I wouldn't say making a living, but trying to make it as a, like, I don't know, like a thing for answering their NBA wizard there.
00:55:29.012 - 00:55:48.640, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we should just start the stack overflow category. Yeah, I guess like that because it's like the solution for, like, most code stuff. So that could actually make sense. I should actually check if there has been a question that has been unanswered since, like, six months. I don't know.
00:55:48.640 - 00:56:27.240, Speaker A: Yeah, it could be because nobody ever checks. Yeah, but that's surfacing. All the knowledge that we are exchanging all the time. I think that's a big theme that we, as an organization, recognize that we're not doing good enough of a job of that. So, yeah, great, interesting feedback. Thanks so much for coming on. I'm a big user of matcha myself, although recently cowswap is also like, I really like cowswap, but I hear that they're using ox in the background as well.
00:56:27.240 - 00:56:36.400, Speaker A: Thanks for all the contributions to Dexter trades. Keep rocking. It's been a pleasure to have you on. Have a nice day.
00:56:37.140 - 00:56:45.620, Speaker B: Okay, you too. Thank you, everyone, for hanging here and have a nice day now. I'll come, everyone. We will cross paths, us in this way.
00:56:46.040 - 00:56:48.700, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll see each other, Iran.
00:56:49.360 - 00:56:49.856, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:56:49.928 - 00:56:50.900, Speaker A: Take care. Bye.
