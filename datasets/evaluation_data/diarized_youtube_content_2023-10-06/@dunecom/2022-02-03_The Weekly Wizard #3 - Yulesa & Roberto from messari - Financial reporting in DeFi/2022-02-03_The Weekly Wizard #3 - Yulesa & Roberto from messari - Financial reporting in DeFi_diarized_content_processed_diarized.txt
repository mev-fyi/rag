00:00:01.600 - 00:00:29.650, Speaker A: Hey, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the weekly Wizard. I think today is episode three, and today I'm joined by the wonderful data scientists from Masari, and that is Roberto to my right, and Ulisa just below me. And I think just to start it off, if you could both quickly introduce yourself and talk a bit about your background, what you've done before joining the crypto space, that would be very cool.
00:00:30.380 - 00:00:32.440, Speaker B: Of course. Want to take that first, Julie?
00:00:33.020 - 00:01:16.876, Speaker C: Yeah, so I'm Julie, I'm from Brazil. I live here since I born, so never abroad and, like, privileged to privilege to join Mesati. I had a completely non related to tech job. Like, I mean, I was an engineer for the oil company here in Brazil. Oh, yeah, I've come, I've made a big shift in my career, joined Masari and starting to work with data like that. So. But for me, like, has been a pleasure because, like, I love the blockchain space a lot.
00:01:16.876 - 00:01:26.926, Speaker C: So let's how I came. I got a full job in the crypto.
00:01:26.958 - 00:02:05.896, Speaker B: So, yeah, my name is Roberto. I come from a traditional finance background. I was there for four and a half years doing risk management and a little bit of fund development. Went down the rabbit hole around mid 2019, started exploring crypto in general as an equity. I can trade it as I trade equities or bonds or options, and then quickly realized that Ethereum is a little bit more comprehensive than just an asset. I started learning about the ABM. I started learning about DeFi, and then quickly realized that I need to leave my cushy job and join Missouri.
00:02:05.896 - 00:02:24.720, Speaker B: So I joined Missouri full time in March of 2021 as a researcher focused on DeFi. And then around maybe like, seven months later, I started heading the data science team and then grabbed this wonderful man, Julie, to start building some wonderful dune dashboards for us.
00:02:25.220 - 00:03:09.350, Speaker C: Yeah, I've joined Mercedes. I think it was October last year. So that was my first job in the crypto space, and I was really lucky to me. Sorry, because, like, Roberto can talk a little bit more because, like, what's such a coincidence of once, you know, like, I was starting to doing doom dashboards, like, for myself and, like, Mesari was looking for someone to explore the on chain data, you know, like, I don't even realize that they had the idea what it would become at the time.
00:03:09.430 - 00:03:29.334, Speaker A: But, like, yeah, yeah, just like, we need somebody who's good at this June thing. Like, let's. Let's grab someone. Okay. Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah. Interesting, that. Yeah, it's just like the collection of people that are that end up in the people in the crypto space is always interesting.
00:03:29.334 - 00:03:43.310, Speaker A: So, um, I like, what does Misari actually do? Like, why. Why is there a data scientist team at Misaritainous Smissari's mission? And what are they doing in crypto space for those people who are not familiar?
00:03:43.650 - 00:04:27.512, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So we're a data aggregator and marketing intelligence company, and with a goal to organize crypto information at a global scale so that we can present it to everyone so they can navigate this new digital economy. And the extension of why we have a data science team now is very natural, where we need to find ways to extract data from different data sources, in particular blockchains, because it's very simple for us to aggregate market data. And, you know, we talk about prices and volume, things like that. But there's this other huge component in the space that is blockchain, like, on chain information. So the data science team was kind of born to tackle that area of.
00:04:27.512 - 00:04:36.980, Speaker B: Let's. Hey, let's have a team that can do the on chain data and also, like, aggregate in such a way that is contextualize so users can ingest it and then make decisions based on that.
00:04:37.320 - 00:05:06.860, Speaker A: Okay, so before, like, I don't know, like, I think you've been venturing on, on chain data for. For. For a bit now, but before that, it was pretty much, like, all just market data. So you were having, like, order other flow and, like, price and, like, maybe like, token distributions that's already kind of on chain, but, like, lock up lockup periods and stuff like that. More like. More like, from a, like, financial market perspective and not so much like the on chain market perspective. Is that kind of correct? Okay, exactly.
00:05:06.900 - 00:05:20.900, Speaker B: Yeah, that's exactly right. Our focus, I mean, it's bad because of our data. Our data vendors were mostly on the. On the market side, you know, coin metrics, coin market cap, Tyco. And then now we're venturing more into, like, let's just get all the data from all the blockchains.
00:05:21.060 - 00:05:23.720, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, it's all on the chain.
00:05:26.310 - 00:05:46.046, Speaker C: Our analysts had, like, a really hard time, like, understanding the protocols workflows and KPI's, you know, like, the. How. How the tokens move inside the protocol. And, like, now with the data team, like, we can provide much more data for them to understand each. How each protocol works, you know?
00:05:46.078 - 00:05:48.534, Speaker A: So, okay.
00:05:48.622 - 00:05:59.842, Speaker C: The data team in the sari, like, it's becoming each day more important as a resource internally, you know, like, yeah.
00:05:59.946 - 00:06:02.670, Speaker A: Are you hiring for new dune wizards at the moment? Maybe.
00:06:03.010 - 00:06:16.106, Speaker B: Yes, yes. We are we are. We are hiring at all the dune we search right now because, I mean, we can dive more into that and, like, how we're working our working relationship with you later. But I guess we are hiring right now 100%.
00:06:16.258 - 00:06:22.450, Speaker A: Okay, that's. Yeah, we'll make a. I'll make sure to include that link in the description.
00:06:23.870 - 00:06:29.086, Speaker C: I've been doing all the hard work on doing for Masari. So, like, yeah, I need help.
00:06:29.238 - 00:06:30.930, Speaker B: You need some backups? Yeah.
00:06:31.710 - 00:06:38.210, Speaker A: Yeah. Are you, are you the only one who's doing the dune wizard stuff for Masari at the moment, Julia?
00:06:39.550 - 00:06:56.940, Speaker C: Right now I am. But there are another data scientists in Missouri that also can do it. Like. But he's currently overseeing other types of data in Masai, so right now, all they doing is mine.
00:06:58.640 - 00:07:15.420, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. So that's Misari covered. Just maybe the last question, what's the business model? Or how does Misari money or something like that? Because I think that's like, we haven't covered this aspect.
00:07:16.090 - 00:07:46.290, Speaker B: Yeah, of course, we have different subscription models. We have the free version where you can get access to a lot of wealth of datasets. In our website, we have pro subscription, which is more geared towards a retail investor. It's about dollar 30 a month. And then we have the enterprise tier, which is more for if you're like a hedgepoint or you're an exchange, which is a little bit higher. So that's how we broke apart our business model right now.
00:07:46.710 - 00:07:47.550, Speaker A: Okay, I see.
00:07:47.630 - 00:07:58.890, Speaker C: Yeah. And we also have a lot of free content that people enjoy, like the quarterly report that we are going to talk very much, which is for you, for everybody.
00:08:00.590 - 00:08:29.280, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been, I've been very much enjoying the quarterly report and. But I think before diving into that, especially you, Roberto. Coming from a traditional finance background, I think an interesting question to explore is basically, how does like, data availability in Defi and in the crypto space in general, compared to the traditional finance world? And, like, what are stark differences that you could make out directly?
00:08:29.820 - 00:09:19.570, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, there's a huge difference between the two, purely because, I mean, financial markets have centuries of data sets, and there's tools everywhere to extract data very quickly. Put succinctly, if you're working in asset management or management traditional finance, you have a Bloomberg terminal and a boomer terminal has basically all the data that you can ask for any asset that you can imagine, and you can get the data instantaneously. That's still one of the biggest things that we're lacking in crypto. For example, if I want to get TBL data, I have to go to defy level. If I want to get on chain data, I go to you guys. So if I want to get fundamental data, I have to go to the container. So there's no unified area or tool that lets me pull all that information through my analysis.
00:09:19.570 - 00:09:52.820, Speaker B: It's still incredibly fragmented. Now, I think that's a function of the nascent sea of our industry. I think eventually we're going to get there, but I think that's the biggest difference that I see is the data availability component from a research point of view is a lot easier in transfi than it is in crypto. So anyone in crypto that has the ability to extract data from either on chain or through an API has some sort of programming language. Those researchers and those investment funds are going to have a huge advantage purely because it can get the data that a lot of people are not able to get.
00:09:56.040 - 00:10:24.900, Speaker A: That's actually not quite the answer I expected. Like you saying, like, the data accessibility is higher. Like from, from my perspective, it's like the blockchain data is like free, like it's publicly accessible for everyone, at least like on certain platforms. And like everyone can certainly go in there and like make their own analysis. Like, even if it's like the super hardcore way of like I spin up my own node, sync it and then just query against my own node. But, but you're saying.
00:10:25.090 - 00:10:26.620, Speaker B: So how many people can do that?
00:10:27.720 - 00:10:28.360, Speaker A: Quite a few.
00:10:28.400 - 00:10:57.316, Speaker B: I mean, quite a few. Quite a few. Quite a few people. But if I do the comparison to a Bloomberg terminal, I can just call a function inside Excel and then get terabytes of data. So it is a lot easier for me to extract data from Tri because the database is the structure and the tooling to extract the data. For me to do analysis, a lot easier when you compare that to our industry, you need to like know SQL for you guys at least. Yeah.
00:10:57.316 - 00:11:30.270, Speaker B: So a lot of, a lot of researchers, I mean, what we see even internally, like a lot of researchers don't have that skill set. Whereas in the traditional world, it's going to be like a download. You know, I want this field, this field, this field, download, click to click. So that component of infrastructure to make the data easy, easy to get, is it different. Now the caveat here is like you said, is like blockchains are open ledgers. So like, anyone that has a skill can get that data if they want to. So it's more open in that sense.
00:11:30.270 - 00:11:36.630, Speaker B: It is more the tooling to extract the data that is very different between trust by. And.
00:11:38.530 - 00:12:14.280, Speaker C: I would add there that, like, here in the crypto space, we can go into the project and see how the, the money flows internally, which in the traditional finance. I think this is a little bit hard because, like, the company needs to be transparent and allows you to have this data. And here in crypto, you don't have. You don't need permission from anyone. Like, here you can go into Aave or compound and, like, explore all the pools that they have, all the liquidity they have, you know, and this is different from the tradition of.
00:12:17.190 - 00:12:50.750, Speaker A: Yeah, that's, that's also an interesting. Yeah, you can't hide shit in defi. Like, you're. Yeah, you're like, there's a, like, I've thought about, like, writing hit articles like, using on chain data in the past, but I've. I've stayed away from it for now. But it's like, there's, there's a lot because, like, I think there's a big problem of, like, analysts are mostly incentivized to, like, publish good news because it's like, number go up, number is great, and nobody really likes shorting and looked down upon. So it's like, publishing negative news is probably not a good way to grow your network.
00:12:50.750 - 00:13:20.070, Speaker A: But somebody should do that because that's the key part. If your product doesn't return the numbers, it should. Then you can't hide it somewhere in your quarterly report. Like, it's all like life on chain. Like, you. You can see people leaving. Like, if there's somebody who's leaving compound now with 60 million, I'd be immediately able to swap that and I'd be like, compound, compound, like, you're in trouble.
00:13:22.050 - 00:13:31.630, Speaker C: I wonderland. Like, you can look at all the data. Like, you can see what the stakeholders are doing. Like, everything is public.
00:13:33.130 - 00:13:40.000, Speaker A: Yeah. Which is a blessing and a curse, as we've seen on some recent examples.
00:13:41.300 - 00:13:41.796, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:41.868 - 00:13:58.760, Speaker A: What do you think about the liveness of data with this usual companies? They report in quarterly installments, I guess is that. Yeah, you get what I'm saying? What do you think about that?
00:13:59.950 - 00:14:44.190, Speaker B: I mean, I guess just data availability from Iraq. You have a lot of these companies in tri that have this big international investor relations groups within the company and they just report everything on a quarterly basis. So this is why open blockchains and open data is amazing because you can just track everything on a daily basis and you just have it in a dashboard for everyone to see. I know we're going to dive into quarterly a bit, so a lot of the quarterlies that we're doing is actually following that. We're not really going to stick to the quarterly frequency, but we're going to have some sort of frequency to write the reports. But the idea is to have essentially this data available for everyone to see it at any time.
00:14:46.370 - 00:15:06.900, Speaker C: With the dashboards that we create on Doom, you can have evergreen data. Everything that is happening, you can refer to the last quarter report. Like, look how the project evolved from there to where it's today. You know, like, so you don't need to wait a new quarter to see how things evolved, you know?
00:15:07.760 - 00:15:17.700, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Like, do you guys want to dive into compound or uniswap first? I'll let you decide.
00:15:19.410 - 00:15:22.550, Speaker B: Eula's driving this. What do you want to talk about first? Eula?
00:15:23.610 - 00:15:35.070, Speaker C: I think you can start on compound because it was the first one that we've made and it's the only one that so far has like two reports already. So let me share my screen here.
00:15:35.890 - 00:15:59.054, Speaker A: Did you actually, like, like, usually in a quarterly report you get like a, like 90 slide PDF. Like what? Everything, which, like, puts that thing into color. Did you, do you guys do something like that as well? Or do you just like, here's a bit of data, and go with it. There's usually explanations in those quarterly parts, correct?
00:15:59.102 - 00:16:37.400, Speaker B: Yeah. I think we're positioned nicely as a company because we have a massive research branch in our team. So it's great for us. Data scientists pull that data, but there's still an element of contextualizing that data into actual insights. So our researchers spend a lot of time understanding, well, like, this is how you compute revenue for this lending platform and this compute revenue for this Dex. So the quarter list essentially give you a contextualized view of the raw data that we are pulling from on chain. That's what they think.
00:16:37.400 - 00:16:48.460, Speaker B: We're very nicely positioned to be the company that is producing this quarterly reports because we can infuse the raw data with this insights and then present that to users for them to make a rational decision.
00:16:49.400 - 00:16:51.060, Speaker A: Yeah, we need more.
00:16:52.480 - 00:16:54.504, Speaker C: I think I need permission to share my screen.
00:16:54.552 - 00:17:04.340, Speaker A: Oh, how the hell would I do that? This hasn't happened before.
00:17:07.440 - 00:17:12.834, Speaker C: I click on the button, nothing is happening. So I don't know if it permission or not.
00:17:13.002 - 00:17:15.030, Speaker A: Yeah, let me, let me check for a second.
00:17:16.290 - 00:17:17.510, Speaker B: Technical issues.
00:17:19.770 - 00:17:23.490, Speaker C: No, I found the problem is that it opened in another window here. Sorry.
00:17:23.530 - 00:17:25.866, Speaker B: Okay, there you go.
00:17:25.938 - 00:17:26.698, Speaker A: So there we go.
00:17:26.754 - 00:17:27.350, Speaker B: Nice.
00:17:33.330 - 00:18:01.796, Speaker C: I thought was permission. Oh, this was the first port that we had. Like, it's the compound one so this was the first dashboard that we done in Masari to grab data. Oh, I don't know how to start it. Like, I'll give you a hand.
00:18:01.828 - 00:18:46.716, Speaker B: I'll give you real quick. Yeah, I'll give you a hand. So what we're trying to do with this quarter list is provide a consistent view across subsets of the market. So, like, all lending platforms are going to have a specific layout, all decks are going to have a layout. And you notice that here, what Yule is showing you is that we start providing pretty much like a table that contains all the information that we use to create every single chart that we're showing in the dashboard. One thing that we noticed when we started doing this is that the Duon dashboards in general, they have different layouts. So whenever you go into one specific dashboard, you have to basically learn what you're looking at across every single dashboard.
00:18:46.716 - 00:18:59.700, Speaker B: So for us, it was very important for the user to come in and have a very similar experience so they can very quickly start ingesting the data and understanding the data that we're presenting without having to understand the organization or the dashboard too much.
00:19:01.440 - 00:19:30.280, Speaker A: I see. So, yeah, that's a really cool approach, and I'm actually really excited to hear that because that's like, I see the same problem in the NFT market to some extent, where it's like, we have a million different NFT dashboards and they all slightly report different data. And you're like, how can I make use of this? Yeah, yeah. It's like, there's a new data point, but what does it mean? Like, if you standardize it, then it's like, really? Then you can actually, like, work with the data. So, yeah, yeah, really cool.
00:19:31.220 - 00:19:34.160, Speaker B: Sir, you're like, now you can take it away, sir.
00:19:34.860 - 00:19:37.212, Speaker A: Yeah, can you. Can you maybe just start boxer, right.
00:19:37.236 - 00:19:39.320, Speaker C: Now I'm listening to you, but not boxer.
00:19:40.940 - 00:19:41.652, Speaker A: Okay.
00:19:41.716 - 00:19:44.124, Speaker C: You were listening to him, right?
00:19:44.292 - 00:19:45.040, Speaker B: Yes.
00:19:46.140 - 00:19:48.720, Speaker A: You can't hear me anymore. Hello? Hello?
00:19:51.150 - 00:20:00.850, Speaker B: It might be. I think it might be a stream. The stream is what might be causing the lag, because I noticed that once you go live, we start getting this technology issues.
00:20:06.150 - 00:20:06.438, Speaker A: You.
00:20:06.454 - 00:20:07.970, Speaker B: Look, could you stop streaming?
00:20:11.270 - 00:20:13.438, Speaker A: Does he not hear either of us now?
00:20:13.614 - 00:20:14.730, Speaker B: I think we lost.
00:20:15.310 - 00:20:17.130, Speaker A: No, he's still moving.
00:20:21.850 - 00:20:37.042, Speaker C: Sorry. Like, when I click to share my screen, I clicked so many times and, like, it opened many windows on the background. Sorry for that only. Yeah, I need to, you guys to.
00:20:37.066 - 00:20:41.590, Speaker A: Recap a little bit, but you can hear both of us now.
00:20:42.620 - 00:20:46.508, Speaker C: Yeah, now it's fine. Like, I closed all the windows.
00:20:46.684 - 00:21:11.400, Speaker B: Nice. We were just doing a quick overview of the compound dashboard, but I don't know if you want to talk about. Just go through it briefly, maybe like two, three minutes. Talk about how you came up actually the process that you take to when someone comes in and we have to issue a quarterly. What is your process from research to end product as a dashboard?
00:21:14.010 - 00:22:04.104, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. Like when you first initiate, like I try to see all the contracts that the protocol has on dune or on chain, and I started to filter which data is relevant for us and which are not. Like most of the time I'm very concerned about the token flows because most of these Defi reports that we've done are about Defi projects. So the oath of tokens inside it, it's what the biggest concern we have. So I started by doing it by pieces. So like for example, compound here, like I started to look only to the deposits that they have. So I make a query to get all the deposits, all the redeems, all the borrows.
00:22:04.104 - 00:23:12.262, Speaker C: And like I, I structure the query, like to grab this data into blocks of code. And at the end of the query, when I already have all the data that I want, I just stick them together in one big table which has all the data that we can extract from this protocol. So that's how I make these tables here. When you see it, it's like a big query, but everything is divided by blocks of that you can analyze. So that's how I do it. The compound one, like I started to look at a main performance that they have. Like for example, deposit redeems, borrower repay liquidations, and like add them all together to see how much outstanding deposits they have, how much outstanding lows they have, the interest they are paying for the depositors, and the utilization they are having.
00:23:12.262 - 00:23:12.930, Speaker C: So.
00:23:15.710 - 00:23:53.940, Speaker B: The purpose of having the table at the top is, it was a very, I mean, it was a decision that we decided to make because we want to make this data also available to someone to download it very quickly and very easily so they can recreate a lot of the charts that we're doing in the bottom. So if you notice, our dashboards will always have our header, some explanation of the dashboard, and then a big, big chunk of data table at the top that essentially feeds into all the charts that we create at the bottom. So like if anyone needs to download data, mostly our researchers, like anyone else in the industry, they can do it very quickly and then you can recreate those charts that we're creating for ourselves.
00:23:54.900 - 00:24:19.440, Speaker A: Yeah, see? Yeah, that's a very interesting design choice that's kind of influenced by how you're working with other teams and the space. In more general terms. That's interesting insight. So maybe we can, I forgot to throw this in at the beginning, but maybe we can take a step back and like what is compound? Actually?
00:24:22.600 - 00:24:25.288, Speaker B: You want to take that? Yeah.
00:24:25.344 - 00:25:04.548, Speaker C: So compound is a lending market that people can deposit their tokens. And it's essentially what the main function of a bank, like you can deposit some of your assets and this bank, which is component can lend these tokens to other people that will borrow these assets and use for their use and they pay interest for the, the bank, which is rooted to the depositors and the bank takes a share, you know, like, so essentially what a bank does in the lending side of it, you know. Oh, that's what compound is.
00:25:04.724 - 00:25:09.240, Speaker A: Okay, so how many deposits do they have today?
00:25:13.020 - 00:25:14.900, Speaker C: Look at here, the outstanding deposit.
00:25:14.940 - 00:25:18.520, Speaker B: Boxer, you have not seen our dashboard. You would know that answer, sir.
00:25:18.910 - 00:25:31.438, Speaker A: I have seen it, but it's like, I think if we walk through this like this, like it might be, it might be very. Yeah, it might be very approachable to people if we, if we do it this way.
00:25:31.614 - 00:25:32.970, Speaker B: I'm pulling your leg.
00:25:34.270 - 00:25:38.806, Speaker A: So there's. Okay, yeah.
00:25:38.878 - 00:25:47.780, Speaker C: Right now people are already deposit 10 billion, billion dollars of value into.
00:25:49.560 - 00:25:55.140, Speaker A: Okay, do we, do we have a chart for that over time? Yes.
00:25:59.480 - 00:26:01.680, Speaker C: All the deposits by tokens.
00:26:01.840 - 00:26:02.272, Speaker A: Okay.
00:26:02.296 - 00:26:07.820, Speaker C: Even see which assets are being. Represent the most of the value that.
00:26:09.590 - 00:27:02.420, Speaker A: Okay, I checked this the other day and I think USDC, USDT and Dai were the most like popular ones. Do you have an idea why it's so popular to, like, what do you think is people's move here? Like are they depositing stables and then taking out volatile assets in the hopes of shorting the market? Or do they, like do they do something similar to that? Or like what's your, what's your like, thinking here? What, what is the, what is the reason people are using compound? Like with tables especially, like I can see like why I would like put my eth in there and then like I, I have my, like I can take out stables again, my against my eth and then do something with those, but yeah, the other way around. Like I was actually surprised to find that it was that many stables.
00:27:06.440 - 00:28:01.840, Speaker C: Yeah, the stables are the one that pays better. So like people like to receive yields on it. So I think this drives most of the deposits that compound has. And also like, I think they are the most utilized tokens on compound because this allows people to leverage on their, their position. So they take coins and invest it in other assets which they can even deposit again if they want, you know, and take another bigger low end on that and like, increase their exposure to one asset. So I think when the market is a bull market, like the stable are going to be the most oral assets that we have.
00:28:04.140 - 00:28:13.520, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. If we look at the chart on the right is aggregated loans. Right. So that's the stables that are taking out on compound.
00:28:15.300 - 00:28:36.890, Speaker C: Yeah. Recently compound also had they make a partnership with Coinbase which allows people from Coinbase to deposit tokens into compound, which increased their reserves in USDC, I think. Oh, yeah.
00:28:40.830 - 00:28:46.500, Speaker A: Can you show us this on the chart? Like, I wouldn't be able to tell immediately where.
00:28:47.000 - 00:28:53.288, Speaker C: I can't see exactly what it is, but like, they announced it, so. Yeah, I know that happened.
00:28:53.424 - 00:29:09.544, Speaker A: Okay, so what are. What are people earning on these, on the stable coin deposits at the moment? Do we have a. Or like historical? I guess, yeah, we have a start.
00:29:09.592 - 00:29:30.650, Speaker C: Here on the interest they're receiving as a depositor. Like the supply side of the. Of the bank. We need to go into individual assets to see it because like, yeah, we don't have an aggregate for the whole compound ecosystem.
00:29:45.680 - 00:30:02.340, Speaker A: So, yeah, I guess, like, what are. What are the key performance indicators? Or like, if you, like, if I'm an investor in compound and I now want to look at, like, hey, like, how's compound actually doing? Like, which. Which charts would you recommend me to look at?
00:30:07.290 - 00:31:02.540, Speaker C: I think right now, the most important metrics they have is how much deposits they have. Like, what is the total value that they are holding there for you to be able to borrow and how much people are borrowing. So, like, how many loans people have took and also the rate between the two. Like, how much the utilization that a compound is receiving, which we can see here, the blue line is everything. The value of the assets that compound has, that people have deposited on compound. The blue is the how much of these assets people has took as a borrower. And we can have a rate between the two, which is the utilization rate, which tells us how people are utilizing the assets that are available on compound.
00:31:05.240 - 00:31:11.820, Speaker A: Okay, so actually, so actually 40% of the assets that are deposited on compound are loaned out right now.
00:31:12.640 - 00:31:14.328, Speaker C: Yeah. Yes.
00:31:14.504 - 00:31:33.954, Speaker A: I don't know how that is in traditional finance, but that, like, on first, like, it sounds. It doesn't sound bad. Historically it has been. It has been much higher, though. So in recent times, there seems to have been like, I don't know, like, yeah, just lacking.
00:31:34.042 - 00:32:10.494, Speaker C: We had some events in the recent past that people got liquidated. So it's the biggest fear of everybody that is lending money on compound that we can see here, like in April when the market stink a little bit, we had like a bunch of liquidations on this period and right now and the price of it and bitcoin felt also we had like a bunch of liquidation. I think this affect people mindset that like you can borrow as everything that they are putting as collateral there.
00:32:10.542 - 00:33:00.954, Speaker B: Like, I think the component of utilization to coming down is a reflection of the recent market moves that we've had. As you can imagine, when we are like we're tanking, we're really, literally diving down to really low the appetite for either. I mean, if you're going to short, then you can short like the appetite for like borrowing. The lever of your position becomes a lot less appetizing just purely because, you know, like going down. Like, you're going to get liquidated for that. So I think that component of liquidation also utilization coming down is also a component of like our market environment. And the other thing I want to mention too is like there's a, there's another metric that I will look at for a company general, is that the amount of money that they take from that reserve factor from each one of the, from each one of the assets that they're borrowing, which is how we're computing the revenue.
00:33:00.954 - 00:33:16.910, Speaker B: So. Or the protocol side, the maintenance or the protocol side revenue is what we, what I will also look at. So, not only like the supply side, but also like the protocol, the protocol side, the money that they're taking in from the lending and borrowing that's happening in the protocol.
00:33:20.450 - 00:33:21.450, Speaker A: All right, I see.
00:33:21.570 - 00:34:27.879, Speaker C: Yeah, I think I should explain this a little bit. Like, for each asset that you borrow, part of the interest that you pay are routed to the compound, like to increase their reserves, and they use it like a phone, something bad happened, or like also to pay for the protocol revenue. Like there is a doll that can govern how this money is going to be utilized. And we can see here how much is going to the people there, how, what part of the interest are going to the people they are depositing, which is the supply side revenue that we are making out of interest, and how much is going to the protocol itself. So we break this down here, this chart, and we can see also which tokens are paying more revenue, which are. Because not all of them have the same reserve factor, so they contribute different for the protocol revenue.
00:34:29.819 - 00:35:00.650, Speaker A: Okay. So that, like, s, like, if I was on the compound strategy team. I would now look at this and I would see, hey, there's a big like gray bar. So DAi is really valuable to us because it gives us a lot of supply side revenue. I guess that is. Or is it like, is it both types of revenue? On the right chart, actually it says protocol revenue in the title. So that's actually really good for compound the dow or compound the project.
00:35:00.650 - 00:35:09.102, Speaker A: That's actually like money into their bank account or like wallets. Yeah.
00:35:09.126 - 00:35:27.284, Speaker C: But the revenue, it goes both to the depositors into the protocol. So like I. It's just a fraction of the. Of the interest that goes to the protocol. So here is the breakdown of the protocol itself, like for compound, but the same, a bigger chunk of it is going to the depositor. So like.
00:35:27.332 - 00:35:49.780, Speaker A: Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah. We can, we can see that distribution on the left. But on this like right hand side chart, it's only protocol revenue. Is that a daily chart? So on a. On an average day they earn like 60, 70k just from their depositors. Is that like correct interpretation?
00:35:49.860 - 00:35:52.520, Speaker C: It's a. It's a daily charge.
00:35:52.820 - 00:35:54.840, Speaker A: Okay. They're printing money.
00:35:55.140 - 00:35:56.060, Speaker B: They're printing money.
00:35:56.100 - 00:35:56.276, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:35:56.308 - 00:35:57.720, Speaker B: They're making money for sure.
00:35:59.140 - 00:36:01.200, Speaker A: Yeah, that's, that's pretty interesting.
00:36:02.140 - 00:36:38.484, Speaker C: But there is a cabinet which is the. The graphs below, which is they are also paying people to deposit there, which is the incentives they are paying. They pay in comp tokens. So they incentivize people to deposit and increase the interest people are getting for depositing tokens. And also they incentivize people to borrow money. So they pay also the loan side of the, of the equation. Like incentivizing people to take loan and decreasing the amount they are, they are paying.
00:36:38.484 - 00:37:00.956, Speaker C: You know, they receive income tokens, which we can see here. We. The incentives are like, this is our aggregate charts. So like we can see that it's all increasing comp. But here we multiply by the price of comp. So that's why the sharp is. The graph is a little bit sharp, you know, because it's multiplying.
00:37:00.956 - 00:37:04.370, Speaker C: Bye. The current price of compound.
00:37:07.590 - 00:37:18.250, Speaker A: Yeah, I see. Do you have a chart somewhere that subtracts the token or like the protocol revenue minus the incentives that are paid?
00:37:20.750 - 00:37:21.690, Speaker C: Not yet.
00:37:22.590 - 00:37:45.724, Speaker A: Okay. That would actually be really interesting. I think there was a big story about spell like two weeks ago or something. That spell was profitable for the, for the first day in their entire life. Basically because like the spell emissions were less or maybe a week or a month. I don't know the timeline anymore. But basically they had crossed this, like, they were basically making money for the first time.
00:37:45.724 - 00:38:12.046, Speaker A: If you like, look at all the spell tokens they're emitting and looking at the revenue that's coming in and that's like, it's a hugely important thing, like, to get to that point. Right. Because, like, your token emissions can't go on forever. And, like, once you cross that threshold of being like, hey, like, we're actually earning money. Of course, we're still, like, giving out, like, not free money, but like, it's kind of like marketing expense. You could call it monetary. Yeah.
00:38:12.046 - 00:38:19.566, Speaker A: Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Customer acquisition cost. That's actually better. So. Yeah, like, crossing that. Yeah. I'd be really interested in seeing.
00:38:19.566 - 00:38:20.770, Speaker A: In seeing that chart.
00:38:21.680 - 00:39:02.938, Speaker C: Yeah, we don't have like a evergreen chart, like, in doming for this, but like, in the report that Mesari makes, they put up a table which, like, this data can exaggerate in quarters, and we can see this in quarters, you know, so here we have how much revenue they are making. Let me see here at income. So that's how much they are making. And we can see here how much no interest income. And I think we have a line here for how much we are paying as incentives. Oh, we have the adjusted net income, which is the subtraction of both of them.
00:39:03.074 - 00:39:13.864, Speaker A: Okay. So they are not net positive at the moment because that is like, the brackets around the numbers actually means I. A negative number. Right.
00:39:13.912 - 00:39:14.376, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:14.488 - 00:39:18.940, Speaker A: I've never understood that. Yeah, it looks better.
00:39:23.680 - 00:39:57.162, Speaker B: What Julie just showed you is kind of like the component of data and also the report. And this is where our massive, very intelligent research team comes in and constructs this report to contextualize all the data that you're seeing on the dashboards. So this is more like what you would see in traditional markets. But then the caveat here is that you always have, you're always going to have the doom dashboard, or like the dashboard, evergreen dashboard, to look at these things on a daily basis, which is an astronomical improvement when you compare it to the legacy. Legacy world.
00:39:57.306 - 00:40:28.930, Speaker A: Yeah. And there's no, like, you could theoretically generate this via script. Like, if you, if you. If you build the right tools, like, you could just like, generate this from any arbitrary date to any arbitrary date and on command, there wouldn't need to be PVC or whatever. KPMG wouldn't need to come in and go through terabytes of data manually and actually do this, but it's just on chain and you can audit it at any time. So. Yeah, that's really cool.
00:40:28.930 - 00:40:30.342, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:40:30.446 - 00:40:33.334, Speaker B: What's your guys. Sorry, go ahead.
00:40:33.502 - 00:40:58.990, Speaker A: What's your guys thinking in putting this in this ancient form? Like, is this to, like, basically, I guess, like, standardizing the data, but that's already what you're doing, like, in the dashboard formers. But then this is, like, to also, like, I don't know, like, get the, like, more traditional investors, like, to understand these, like, newer topics in, like, a format they understand, or, like, just.
00:40:59.610 - 00:41:18.798, Speaker B: There's a few elements here. Like, one is the written component adds a lot of context around the data that you're seeing. So you need to pick some frequency. It doesn't have to be quarterly. It doesn't have to be monthly. It doesn't have to be, like, annual. In our case, what we're doing is we're doing it quarterly.
00:41:18.798 - 00:41:53.514, Speaker B: This is not to replicate what traditional finance has done, but to an extent, you need to have a certain kind of frequency and cadence in order to produce these kind of reports. The other component is like, yeah, you're correct. So, like, if we're trying to be as Masari, one of our goals is to just contextualize all this information, organize in such a way that, like, anyone can start navigating this deal, digital economy. And when you present it like this to investors, not only in traditional finance, but also, like, in crypto, you can ingest that information a lot more, in a lot more simpler way. And like you mentioned, like, you. I mean, you nailed it. If a.
00:41:53.514 - 00:42:00.670, Speaker B: If an investor from Tratfi looks at this, they're gonna see it as a lot more familiar and a lot easier to digest.
00:42:01.130 - 00:42:20.700, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I see. That's. Yeah, I actually, yeah, now that I think about it properly, like, it actually makes. It makes a ton of sense. And, yeah, maybe Dune should work on a feature which is, like, publishing quarterly reports on our platform. That would be interesting.
00:42:22.640 - 00:42:24.180, Speaker C: Leave it for us. Like.
00:42:27.280 - 00:42:31.614, Speaker B: Let us handle that. Okay. Come on, Mandy.
00:42:31.772 - 00:42:33.110, Speaker A: Maybe we can work together.
00:42:33.490 - 00:42:34.138, Speaker B: Sure.
00:42:34.274 - 00:42:40.110, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Very interesting. Just another.
00:42:41.930 - 00:43:14.890, Speaker C: Just one more thing that I would like to mention here on the compound. One is that here we have seen the big picture of how compounded is. Yes. But we can also deep dive on compound and look into each asset that they have. We can go here in the micro financial statement so we can see the same data, but divided by token. I would just show it a little bit.
00:43:17.390 - 00:44:00.770, Speaker B: To clarify these things. The way we approach our quarterly is from a macro view. So that's protocol, wide view, and a micro view more, either a collateral type of, when you're talking about a lending platform or if you're talking about a Dex, like a specific pool, because each, I mean, like you can look at the protocol called Uniswap as a whole and like, how much liquidity there is, how much DDL there is, and also you can narrow down on like the EtH die pair. And that's also, like, that also contains a ton of information. So the way we structure our doom dashboards in this case is to have that macro view where you can see everything that's happening in the protocol. And also you can click on the micro view, pick a collateral asset, and then look at all the statistics that are related to that specific, specific asset.
00:44:02.950 - 00:44:57.670, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. And especially I think there's always moments in defi where like certain pools or certain pairs are a lot of distress or like there's like interesting things happening in them. And then it's like really useful to have this, like, we're just going to look at this like whatever pool or like lending pool or liquidity pool and just really like, hey, what actually happened on chain in that specific thing? And it's really interesting to really dig down into the data. So, yeah, I love how you guys built this up of like, hey, we're going to take a look at this whole thing, but then also we're going to go down to almost an individual transaction level. I think the time unit you're using here is like day, but it would be a task of five minutes to switch this to. I'm gonna look at individual, like minutes or transactions. So, so it's, yeah, I really love it.
00:44:59.090 - 00:46:04.400, Speaker C: That's like when Doom is so powerful for us because like the compound one was the first one that I've made in Misati. Like, I didn't know exactly how I would do it, so I did it daily. But the newer dashboard that we have creating, you can select which time frame you want. So if you can, if you want to look at by day or by hour and select a time interval that you're interested on, like, you can filter this data in this way, you know, so jumping a little bit to the uniswap here. Like, you can choose here day, week, month and see in a better format. Like some data is better view on daily basis, but other data is better to look at monthly basis, for example, like how many users are interacting with the protocol or it's better seen on most basis, but like price usually is better on our basis. You can choose here to look at the data the way you want.
00:46:05.740 - 00:46:14.600, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. The composability of this is really useful. And big, big shout out to Michael Siberling, who has made this popular in June.
00:46:15.460 - 00:46:37.080, Speaker C: Yeah, I would like to make some. I would like to make some shout outs here because, like, Michael is one that I, like, I always look at his queries and, like, I got him this from him and, like, he's such a good wizard. So, yeah, there are other people that helped me on my way.
00:46:39.310 - 00:46:44.650, Speaker A: Yeah, but we're all standing on Michael's shoulders. Yeah.
00:46:46.790 - 00:46:47.166, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:46:47.198 - 00:47:06.090, Speaker A: So I guess that covers compound. And one thing between those two protocols, like, how did this actually come to play? Did compound approach you? And they were like, hey, we'd like to have a detailed financial report. How do these deals come to come to fruition?
00:47:07.110 - 00:47:51.270, Speaker B: Yeah, basically. So, like, a protocol comes to us and they're asking, we would love to have a quarterly report written about us. And then part of the deal is that, yes, we'll write a quarterly report, but we're also, if the data is available on undoing, we'll also create a dune dashboard for you to always keep track of it. So normally that's delaying that. Compound was like, the first one, and that he kind of, like, was. They were kind of like the guinea pig with this whole service. And now we're just seeing appetite from more and more and more protocols wanting to get this kind of coverage purely because we have that really strong research team that can just aggregate all the data and contextualize it, like, one single report that encompasses everything that's happening.
00:47:52.650 - 00:47:53.830, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting.
00:47:55.050 - 00:48:23.870, Speaker C: I think at the beginning, when we first came out with this idea of the quateries, I think component was not aware that they would receive a dashboard with the deal. But, yeah, I think this is a very. I think the dashboards are even a better product for this. This protocols, you know, like, I think they want to show this data as a evergreen data, you know?
00:48:25.530 - 00:49:07.250, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, there's merits to both, I would say, like, there's a reason why, like, traditional finance does this in quarterly reports, and then there's also a reason why it's probably better if we can do this live. And if you just have, like, because, like, you can't contextualize the data in every second, like, you would need to have, like, analysts online 24/7 for all the protocols. Like, that's not really, that's not really doable. So if you just say, like, once a quarter, hey, we'll look back and we'll, like, analyze this and see, like, what has happened. But then in the meantime, you can always, you can always just look at the data and actually see for yourself. And then you maybe need to figure out for yourself what's actually happening in the quarterly.
00:49:07.250 - 00:49:43.150, Speaker A: And maybe there's other low tech solutions, but still involving some tech where one could solve that. So, example, have a message board or something embedded inside of the dune dashboard and just be like, hey, this is the news in the last seven days in compound. And this might be why the deposits have gone down or something. There's lots of ways to basically improve upon the quarterly report, but with the current methods. I love that you guys are doing this and I think it wouldn't be manageable otherwise.
00:49:44.650 - 00:49:45.590, Speaker B: That's right.
00:49:48.300 - 00:49:55.716, Speaker A: So, yeah, let's dive into uniswap. It's also just amazing what you've built here. Yeah.
00:49:55.748 - 00:50:50.610, Speaker C: Like, Uniswap was a totally different dashboard from the compound one because the amount of data on Uniswap is massive. They have, like, almost on every block. There is at least one swap Uniswap transaction on Ethereum. So, like, the dashboard for Uniswap was much more challenging than the compound was. And here is when I took leverage of the abstract tables that we have for the Dexs. And, like, most of this dashboard is based on the abstraction table, which is like, I think is the future on doom. You know, I think as this protocols evolves, like, the data is going to get ever more complex with time.
00:50:50.610 - 00:51:41.680, Speaker C: So we're going to depend on these abstraction tables that aggregate data from a bunch of contracts or different protocols, and we're going to rely that more to grab the data that we want to make the shots that we want. Uniswap is a good example of that. It has the same effect structure, the same presenting as the compound one. So here we look at swaps, volumes, like key metrics. There are more interest to uniswap, different from the compound one. The architecture is the same. So we have here a table with all the data that we used, you use to make the chart.
00:51:41.680 - 00:51:48.280, Speaker C: Let me break down here by version, and that's it. So.
00:52:00.580 - 00:52:26.830, Speaker A: Yeah, again, if I'm an investor or a potential investor in Uniswap, what would you recommend, like, for the. What kind of metrics should I probably look at? And I think, yeah, with like, the dexter traits table that we have, because we have all this aggregated data, there's probably also, like, compare, like, comparisons you can make to other protocols and stuff. So maybe, maybe if you can dive into those aspects a bit, that would be cool.
00:52:28.890 - 00:53:06.980, Speaker C: First of all, you're putting us in a very hard position because we are the data guys. Like, we don't have a lot of anyways, like. But yeah, we can talk a little bit of uniswap. So I think they have two metrics that I think are the most important one, which is how many user are using Uniswap. So it's this first chart here on top, and also the volume that they are doing. I think those are the most. The metrics that are the most important ones for Uniswap.
00:53:06.980 - 00:53:28.380, Speaker C: The cool thing about Uniswap is that they launched a new version of the protocol. So, like, you can compare the Uniswap V two and Uniswap V three in this dashboard. So here is divided by each version. So it makes comparison between the two very easy.
00:53:31.560 - 00:53:43.420, Speaker B: I think you nailed it. Yeah. Volume. Volume. The last one that I would add is, like, the depth of liquidity for a specific pair. I would also be interested in that kind of metric. So, depth of liquidity.
00:53:43.420 - 00:54:09.510, Speaker B: Volume, because volume is directly related to the fees that the LP's are generating. In the case of Uniswap, there's no vertical revenue. Everything goes directly to the supply side. .3%. So, like that, you can compute the supply side revenue directly from the volume. So volume, the depth of liquidity, and also, like, the usage of the platform will be my top three as an investor in England as well.
00:54:14.770 - 00:55:00.320, Speaker C: I will add one more metric here that I like very much is the amount of markets that are being created on Uniswap. Because, like, as these protocols evolve, like a pool in Uniswap, it being just like a place for you to exchange your tokens when you want to make a trade as a user. And it became like an infrastructure piece of the. Of the money Lego that all protocols use. So, like, we can see how many protocols are developing in ethereum by how many pools are being created, because, like, it's such a basic infrastructure piece of. Of evict structure for this protocol that I like this data a lot, you know?
00:55:04.460 - 00:55:24.904, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally agree. Uniswap V three seems to be much more of a, like tool than it is. Than this is a protocol in the end. So, yeah, it's. Yeah, like every. Every liquidity pool should. Like, every token pair that is traded will at some point probably have a uniswap v three pool somewhere.
00:55:24.904 - 00:55:44.248, Speaker A: It just seems very likely, but we'll have to see what curve we three. We three. We two does. I don't know, but that's beyond this conversation. So, yeah, so with Uniswap. Everything is going to the supply side, actually, so do you. Oh, there's a revenue chart.
00:55:44.248 - 00:55:45.020, Speaker A: Okay.
00:55:45.440 - 00:56:10.872, Speaker C: Yeah, so that's the revenue. It's break down by version here. So blue. And, like, you can see here on the table here that protocol size revenue is zero. So if they ever make the change in the parameters so how much they charge for the protocol, like, this could change in the future. This graph would reflect it.
00:56:10.976 - 00:57:02.130, Speaker A: Yeah. So what immediately stands out to me, it seems like v three depositors actually earn a lot more money than v two depositors, which is pretty interesting. So, yeah, that's all the things you can learn by just studying these dashboards. But, yeah, you were saying earlier, I'm putting you in a bad spot. And I really feel that as a data scientist, I'm always pulling all of this data out of the blockchain, and then you're sitting there like, so what does this actually tell me? You're like, I don't fuck, like, I don't know, like, smarter people than me or, like, people with a different skillset and who are, like, more used to, like, actually, like, making decisions based off this data, have to interpret it. So I very much understand the limitations of questions I can ask you here.
00:57:02.750 - 00:57:27.700, Speaker C: But, yeah, it's okay. Like, one thing that Messari is doing is, like, when we put together a report, a quarterly report like that, we sometimes make calls with the team. So, like, people analyze this data in deep, you know, like, what things are evolving, like what the key metrics they are looking into, you know, like in a more analyst talk, you know?
00:57:30.640 - 00:57:41.860, Speaker B: Yeah, that's why I think you need that. That element of research involving in this process, because we can get you all the data, but then you need someone that, like, ingests that and then just gives you the insight.
00:57:42.720 - 00:58:00.900, Speaker A: Yeah, I totally see. So how many people work on a quarterly report, like, for example, on uniswap report, I guess it was you, Euler, on the data side, just building this uniswap dashboard. And then how many research analysts are there on the other side trying to coach you?
00:58:01.720 - 00:58:41.632, Speaker B: Well, once we have a template, which is basically, what kind of. What are the metrics that are important for a Dex like Uniswap, then it is just downloading the data and then writing the report. In this case, Jerry sun was the one that wrote the report for Uniswap. The first compound report was written by Ron Watkins, and then this following one is going to be written by someone else. But what I'm trying to say is that we already have a template for what compound should be. They just have to download the data and then write the report, kind of give the insights and just contextualize what's happening over the port.
00:58:41.816 - 00:58:42.424, Speaker A: Yeah, I see.
00:58:42.472 - 00:58:48.384, Speaker C: Oh, yeah. The compound one was actually released 2 hours ago. It was written by Dustin. So, yeah, it's.
00:58:48.432 - 00:58:53.260, Speaker B: There you go. Okay. So, yeah, we got. Dustin wrote. Nice timing.
00:58:55.600 - 00:58:57.220, Speaker A: They have nonsense today.
00:58:57.760 - 00:58:58.792, Speaker B: That's right.
00:58:58.976 - 00:59:08.940, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. So I think one last. Sorry, go ahead.
00:59:10.000 - 00:59:37.890, Speaker C: I just wanted to say that Uniswap is even in the data perspective of it. Like, Dooniswap was a challenge because, like, as amount of data they have, they also are launched in different chains. So this was something that was really nice for us because, like, we can use dune to explore on other chains. So here we have optimism. One.
00:59:44.550 - 00:59:45.238, Speaker A: And he's gone.
00:59:45.254 - 00:59:47.930, Speaker B: I think we lost Eulene. Yeah, we lost Eule here.
00:59:48.430 - 00:59:50.398, Speaker A: Yeah, he's kind of coming back.
00:59:50.494 - 00:59:53.822, Speaker B: He's moving. Yeah. But.
00:59:53.846 - 01:00:00.170, Speaker A: Yeah, that's. That's actually what I. What I wanted to talk about as well. Wait, let's wait for him a second.
01:00:01.350 - 01:00:02.374, Speaker B: Coming back.
01:00:02.542 - 01:00:08.930, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, we heard something.
01:00:10.390 - 01:00:11.742, Speaker C: Oh, I'm here. I'm here.
01:00:11.806 - 01:00:12.530, Speaker A: Okay.
01:00:14.110 - 01:00:14.930, Speaker C: Sorry.
01:00:17.750 - 01:00:19.210, Speaker B: Sorry. What was your question?
01:00:19.950 - 01:01:07.980, Speaker A: Yeah, I was just going to say, I saw in the Uniswap report there was also arbitrary data in there. And I guess you guys have some other ways of pulling that data. But what I look really forward to is in the future when we will just be able to have a dropdown of, hey, let's look at arbitram data. Let's look at Uniswap data. When we finally enable this cross chain query function, I think that will really be a game changer. Like, just being able to see how does my product behave on different chains and immediately being able to compare the data in the same formats and in the same way, essentially, that will be really exciting. And I'm already looking forward to seeing what you guys can do with that new feature.
01:01:09.320 - 01:01:13.420, Speaker C: Yeah. Actually waiting for you guys to release motions.
01:01:15.320 - 01:01:28.700, Speaker A: Yeah. Blockchains. Multi chain querying, I guess. Solana data. Yeah. It's going to be a good year for our corporation, I guess. Yeah, for sure.
01:01:28.700 - 01:01:45.570, Speaker A: Dune only lists through its users. And whether that is individual wizards or whole organizations, in the end, it doesn't matter to us, and it doesn't really matter to the market. It's just great that somebody is surfacing the data.
01:01:48.350 - 01:01:53.850, Speaker B: We'll do that. You just give us infrastructure and then we'll handle that. I don't know what happened to you, but now.
01:01:56.350 - 01:02:03.850, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I'll have a look in the chat and see if there is a few questions there.
01:02:04.150 - 01:02:04.982, Speaker B: Okay.
01:02:05.126 - 01:02:07.850, Speaker A: And then I will try to let you go.
01:02:09.090 - 01:02:11.042, Speaker B: Yeah, no problem. No problem, man.
01:02:11.226 - 01:02:32.590, Speaker A: Great. Alpha, nice to be here. No questions today if there's quite a few listeners. So if there's any people in the chat who have questions, please drop them. And otherwise it was. Yeah, we did. You lego?
01:02:33.210 - 01:02:36.870, Speaker B: I have no idea. He just dropped the mic and, like, I'm leaving.
01:02:38.610 - 01:02:42.730, Speaker A: Time's up, man. Time's up. Gotta jump to another meeting.
01:02:42.810 - 01:02:45.190, Speaker B: We're done talking to you. Boxer. What's going on?
01:02:46.570 - 01:03:38.092, Speaker A: Yeah, it was a great pleasure to talk to you guys. We are really happy. Dune internally is really happy about Misari building this great stuff and also kind of being a source of trust because that's what we sometimes see on our platform, that there's like, who is this wizard? Can we trust him? Has this data been audited by someone else? And we just know that, like, if it's coming from the Misari analysts hub or, like, from. From Euler, and then somebody else probably checks over the data, and we know that, like, the analysts are actually working with the data, so any discrepancies would actually. They would be seen. So it's really nice to have, like, a, like, a reputable, I don't know, institution, even though, like, we don't like the institutions in defi. And, like, there's probably a way of, like, of, like, not trusting you guys, but trusting the code.
01:03:38.092 - 01:03:55.560, Speaker A: But anyone can go into your dashboards and audit the code itself, but still, like, it just hugely helps. And, yeah, we really love your stuff. Keep on doing what you're doing. Thanks so much for coming on the podcast, and I will send you guys mux in some near future.
01:03:56.100 - 01:03:58.706, Speaker B: Absolutely, folks. It's been a pleasure chatting with you, Mandez.
01:03:58.768 - 01:04:08.902, Speaker A: Yeah, nice. Thank you. Have a nice day. Yeah, bye bye, yule. Yeah, take care, man. Bye.
