00:00:09.280 - 00:00:43.708, Speaker A: Hi there. Welcome back to another day of Dune template. Previously we covered templates for tokens. Today we'll cover templates for trades. If you want to monitor trading activities for some ERC 20s like lido versus uni or aave, we want to understand the landscape of NFT collections and see how your cute pudget penguins are holding up against the Azukis and nails so you can potentially make some moves. Then you are in the right place and should totally use the trades monitoring templates on Dune. So let's get started.
00:00:43.708 - 00:01:14.078, Speaker A: Okay, you know the drill. Let's get started by going to the main page and click on create new query. And we'll do start with a template. And this time instead of doing tokens, we'll go to the trades section. And let's just start with Dex trades monitoring because we are interested in seeing how the tokens are doing compared to each other. You see already that their default tokens filled in. I am interested in them, but in addition, I also want to see how Lido is doing.
00:01:14.078 - 00:01:42.816, Speaker A: So I'm going to add Lido as a token. I'm going to see the performance on Ethereum chain. And let's make it 30 days because I want to zoom out a little bit more than just one week. And let's get it going. All right, we have our results. So let's go to the table side and see better. Let's see what had the biggest price change in this period compared to the last period.
00:01:42.816 - 00:02:06.950, Speaker A: Seems like Aave had the most. And then in terms of volume, let's see. Uni had the biggest volume change in terms of trading on Dexus, but all of them are going up and up in terms of trading volume. Nice. Yeah. So this is where you can come and just see how they perform compared to each other. Right.
00:02:06.950 - 00:02:50.018, Speaker A: Who had the biggest trading volume in the last however many days you define for your period and then you can take further actions from there. Okay, so let's just do one more for the NFTs. So we were talking about, we want to see how our cute pudgy penguins are faring against the Azuki or the nouns, right? So let's do that. So same as before, if we do create a new query and we start with template, and this time we'll do the NFT trade monitoring template. Amazing. It already knows the penguins are there, so we will just use the default and let you see it for the past seven days. What's happening? Beautiful.
00:02:50.018 - 00:03:23.290, Speaker A: Let's take a look. All right, so let's see the results. If we rank by the trading volume in last seven days. Pudget penguins comes up on top with a lot of buys, but also a lot of sells. And then in terms of most buys, yeah, Penguin sale is the most buy. And then we've got a lot of zookees and milady, but seems like people are selling a lot for these collections. Interesting.
00:03:23.290 - 00:03:35.480, Speaker A: Okay, that's a wrap on trade monitoring dune templates. Go play with them. And add us on Twitter and LinkedIn for any interesting insights that you find. See you next time.
