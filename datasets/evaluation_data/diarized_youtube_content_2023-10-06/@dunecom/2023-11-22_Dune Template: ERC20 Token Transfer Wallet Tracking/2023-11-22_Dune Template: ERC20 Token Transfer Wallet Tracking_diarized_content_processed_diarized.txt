00:00:07.360 - 00:01:11.862, Speaker A: What's up everyone? Welcome. If you're not SQL savvy enough, we're short on time and let's be honest, we can always use some more free time, right? And if you wanted to say track wallets to understand whales movement or learn from smart money or monitor NFT trades or Dex trades or understand the trends in the ecosystem and see the top contracts usage, we've got you. With the recent release of Doom Template feature, you can now easily do any of these things by just a few clicks and within minutes. So let's see how you can do it. Today we are going to show you how to track the token flow of top Chainlink holders. The end result will be you will be able to see within a certain period the top chain link holder, link holders and the balance change in this period and how much token has flown in versus flowing out and then you can investigate further if you want. So let's see how you do this.
00:01:11.862 - 00:01:44.902, Speaker A: Get started. Let's do create new query and then let's do start with template and for today's purpose we'll do this template. And we said that we want to track link token. That's what we are going to do. And going to stay on the Ethereum chain going to track the movement in the past seven days and here minimum balance threshold. So this is how we define the top holders of this token. And I'm told that I can go to Etherscan to get a general sense of how to set this threshold.
00:01:44.902 - 00:02:14.394, Speaker A: So on to etherscan that I go. So I search for chingling token and I click on holders to get a general sense. Wow, lots of links for sure. Let's go to the next page to just get sense. Okay, let's just use 800,000 right? That seems pretty reasonable. So let's do that. 800,000, awesome.
00:02:14.394 - 00:03:02.706, Speaker A: And then I'm gonna click large engine just so it speeds up and let's get this going. And what it's doing is that it actually automatically saves this query under your account and then it just runs for you and then it will show the results. So let's give it a bit time to do this. Alright, so while this is running, let's just see a previous run version of the same template because it does take some time to aggregate everything up. Alright, so here we are looking at the top link holders ranked by the token amounts that's flown in in the past seven days. So first we have a centralized exchange wallet address with 8.6 million link flown in last week.
00:03:02.706 - 00:03:24.994, Speaker A: So let's see what it is. All right. It is a binance wallet. Interesting. But equally, it has a lot flown out and it's an old wallet, meaning that existed before this period, so that was pretty normal. Next up, we've got an personal wallet with a lot of token flown in. Interesting.
00:03:24.994 - 00:03:41.780, Speaker A: Doesn't seem like this person or this wallet holder has anything else, but it's quite, quite a handsome amount. Interesting. All right, that's all for me today. Go forth and try out the template and let us know how you find the template. Cheers. See you next time.
