00:00:03.520 - 00:00:54.154, Speaker A: Very excited to be here. I work at safe, I work in the data team. And today I will talk about some things that we're very excited to save topics from smart apps, also some new narratives that are in space, particularly in standard 457. But before going to that, I will start with comparison. Started with multistakes and particularly we wanted to join multistakes. So super excited. Let's get going a little bit overview about the smart accounts, also their main advantages.
00:00:54.154 - 00:02:15.990, Speaker A: Why do we use smartphones and numbers around the AI system, also our safety system. I will also actually briefly make an inform about 400%. This is a topic that has been heavily discussed in the last eight months. Thank you. Without further ado, there were a lot of icos and the question was, okay, how do you manage those, particularly if you are an institution in your organization and this is where you can see that you have different owners. And.
00:02:17.690 - 00:02:18.430, Speaker B: So.
00:02:21.090 - 00:02:22.350, Speaker A: It'S a bit of.
00:02:26.170 - 00:02:27.190, Speaker B: A flight.
00:03:04.400 - 00:03:38.390, Speaker A: And this is also not taken into consideration. In the IC 20s, it was a lot of activity. And the question is, okay, what happens after what beyond king's beams. And this is where we at.
00:03:42.330 - 00:03:42.618, Speaker B: The.
00:03:42.634 - 00:06:15.560, Speaker A: Kim is my phone. You can say that program you have way more people are many people, they decide to, but there's a big thing, those words are lost, which is why we move this smart. On top of that, something that is very important for CT savvy, as onchain data is with smart contracts. We can reattribute and see, okay, transaction deployment is coming from which provider, for example, transactions are being something that you cannot do with external accounts, let's say metamask, you can identify and the way to look at blocks or row data, which is the function topics. And then using the raw data. This is possible, but a little bit. Here is an example of one of our a table was created, which are the methods that are involved.
00:06:15.560 - 00:10:36.726, Speaker A: Here's an example. This particular is also rising for the. And just keep in mind also that deploying or in general and beyond just deploying and looking, you can see that we have different logics depending on the version 1.3, etcetera. How can you combine which is also quite complex and not necessarily straightforward. For example, at the moment we have most of the optimism and a lot of the activity also, which makes we're looking constantly about price new things that are happening. That's why also we're excited also to take a look how high and what are the real numbers behind 427.
00:10:36.726 - 00:11:58.646, Speaker A: And to give you also just a very brief intro on 427, one of the main differences here is that transactions are related as user operations. Those user operations, they come together to bundle. And then there was a final transaction that is being executed from a bundle. Sometimes those transactions are being sponsored by and usually one of the processors. Way better. And if we see some of the numbers here on the left side, this is, by the way, a chart that is coming from. And the question here is how many of those transactions or user operations are real? That's why we also take a look.
00:11:58.678 - 00:11:59.250, Speaker B: At.
00:12:12.920 - 00:12:36.590, Speaker A: Something that the numbers are, in our case, something that we also always are trying to grow and.
00:12:38.410 - 00:12:39.310, Speaker B: Make this.
00:12:51.690 - 00:13:27.220, Speaker A: And we have what it.
