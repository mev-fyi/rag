00:00:07.160 - 00:00:11.753, Speaker A: Yeah, Paolo, thanks for calling on the podcast. You had to travel quite a lot.
00:00:11.849 - 00:00:23.041, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks for having me, Leslie. Yeah. For the record, like we have the office right in front of you. So like, it's I guess the most casual podcast I've ever done in my life. Yeah.
00:00:23.073 - 00:00:25.711, Speaker A: You just had to go downstairs, I guess.
00:00:25.833 - 00:00:26.495, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:00:27.115 - 00:00:29.875, Speaker A: But maybe you can introduce yourself for the role.
00:00:29.955 - 00:00:56.535, Speaker B: Sure. I'm Pablo, co founder of Angle. We are a stablecoin protocol. So far we developed two big stablecoins, Euro stablecoin that's called Euro A and a USD stablecoin usda. These are decentralized stablecoins that exist across many different blockchains. The particularity of our stablecoins is that these come with native saving solutions. It's like yield bearing products.
00:00:56.535 - 00:01:31.575, Speaker B: And our mission is to ensure that people using our products and more generally people using Defy, are not the product. When you use usdc, you are the product because you are forfeiting away your yield on USD to circle. And with our stablecoins we are doing it such that people get access to the underlying value we're generating with their assets. So when you hold with us, you are making more of your money than what you would with other conventional stable coins you are using.
00:01:32.275 - 00:01:49.095, Speaker A: Yeah, I like this quote on what you say is like, you can think of circle and tether as democratizing the risk, but they centralize the rewards and the interest. But you're democratizing the risk and the rewards.
00:01:49.255 - 00:02:30.181, Speaker B: That's it. I mean there is value like in USDC and usdt and it's normal that they keep some of the rewards for themselves. Because people, I'm ready to give away a bit on my yield just for the practicality I have when I deal with usdt. It's so easy, it's accepted among all other exchanges, but still stablecoins are kind of becoming commodified. In the end, it's just tokenized USD. And it's normal to build systems. You don't need billions of dollars to run a stablecoins and these are not operating at their margin.
00:02:30.181 - 00:03:03.271, Speaker B: Their margins are really, really high. Circle and tether. So there is room for systems which are more beneficial to the users. And that's the advantage, you know, of building on blockchains like you are building on an industry which is highly composable and makes it easy for anyone to create its own primitive. And it's what we do at Angle. You know, we try to build a primitive that is as powerful as that of usdc, but by giving away value to Users, so democratizing access to the yield using the Rails built by circle or teeter.
00:03:03.303 - 00:03:20.969, Speaker A: You know, that makes sense. And we jumped right into what you're doing and, and angle and what you're offering. But so maybe before we come back to this, can you explain a little bit to us, like how it started, how did you meet your co founder and how did you fall into the crypto rabbit hole?
00:03:21.017 - 00:04:03.025, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm a, I'm a super conventional type of person in the sense that, you know, it's not crypto is not something I did on my free time. Like I got lucky enough to take two crypto classes when I was at school. I went to engineering schools in France and in the US and I took one crypto class in France because it sounded interesting and this like shed light created this intense desire from my side to learn more. I got fascinated. And same in the U.S. like one year later I took a class in the U.S. and I was like, okay, this is something which is at the intersection of everything I really liked during my studies.
00:04:03.025 - 00:04:56.089, Speaker B: Economics, computer science, math. And you know, maybe it could have been a different topic and I didn't do it out of, you know, many people were driven in the industry because they earned like they made a profit on ETH and BTC and like for speculative reasons. In my side, like it was more okay, this is all I really liked. So I just want to work in here. And I met my co founders when I was still a student at Stanford University in the US Actually we were in school together before in France and after this crypto class we took at Stanford, we're like, hey, there is so much to be done. It was late in 2020, DeFi was still nascent. And we're like, okay, can we build our thing here? We still hadn't demystified Defi.
00:04:56.089 - 00:05:08.063, Speaker B: Everything seems so magic. Oh, I'm lending on compound. I'm earning interest. I didn't even realize at the time who was ready to borrow the usdc. I was lending. I swapped on Uniswap. I understood the math.
00:05:08.063 - 00:05:49.335, Speaker B: I was like, okay, we're going to reinvent finance. This is the new way to do things. But it seemed so early and the spectrum of what we could do was immense. And we had this class with Fred Ersam, the founder of Coinbase, which made a comparison which was like, made me want to join the space full time. He said like, look in the early like 2000 2010, you could be a team of 10 people and create a billion dollar company. Like you could 10 people create Instagram, create Snapchat. Now if you want to build a powerful social app, you need thousands of employees like TikTok did.
00:05:49.335 - 00:06:39.827, Speaker B: In crypto, you can be four or five people and create something that scales enormous because you have instant worldwide distribution because you have scalable systems like the blockchain. And I was like, okay, let's do this. And it didn't take us long to realize that defi is powerful. But the primitives were only built back in the days for us people. Like everything was denominated in dollars and we wanted to build the tools for everyone to take advantage of defi without having to care about the exchange risk like the euro dollars. And at the time I was earning, I don't know, 5% interest on my USDC, but the dollar was crashing with respect to the euro. I was in France during COVID It's like it's a shame not to have this.
00:06:39.827 - 00:07:19.349, Speaker B: And so this is how we went full time into building our euro stablecoin to give like as a starter. And then our vision is still far more global. Defi needs to think through all audiences like not just focused on the rich wealth transacting in USDC and give people the means to deal with the financial primitives that exist on chain without any consideration of oh, I'm going to lose. If a USD depreciates or appreciates or whatever. You need to be thinking into your main referential. And it's what we started to do early in 2021.
00:07:19.507 - 00:07:52.675, Speaker A: So you went for the euro market first. Back then, dollars stablecoin were overrepresented but it still seemed to be the case. So what happened there? And you didn't manage to fix the problem or people are not interested to get more euros stablecoin what happened there and this problem be fixed and why? I guess it's also important to have more euros than dollars in this ecosystem.
00:07:52.755 - 00:08:28.525, Speaker B: So it was like it was a good bet. Like if you think about it philosophically in the sense of let's do euros. But as a company it was a bad bet to focus just on the euro and the euro stablecoin market. Like the discrepancy between when we joined, when we launched and now has barely decreased. The euro stablecoin market hasn't really taken off with our Euro stablecoin. Euro 8 used to be known as AG Euro. We're still one of the biggest euro stable coin, but still it's ridiculous.
00:08:28.525 - 00:08:34.085, Speaker B: If you compare it to the size of the USD stablecoin market, I think the ratio is one to one. Thousand.
00:08:34.505 - 00:08:35.497, Speaker A: That's crazy.
00:08:35.641 - 00:09:13.359, Speaker B: And why did that change? There are many different reasons but the main one is I'd say it's like network effects are like virtual circles and when everyone is used to transacting in USD while people launching their systems will build around USD because it's what has more liquidity which is still going to reinforce the predominance of USD stable coins in the market. There is also the fact that people do not really care about the exchange risk in an industry where volatility is so high. Like I don't know, the average volatility of USD Euro on a yearly basis 7%?
00:09:13.447 - 00:09:13.751, Speaker A: Yep.
00:09:13.783 - 00:10:16.165, Speaker B: Well, it can be the price variation of BTC or ETH in a day. So why would you care about dealing with something which is less liquid when the it's like what you may earn or lose in a in a day. So these are the main reasons and the third one, but I guess it less because now there was still some unclarity with respect to what would be the legal status of euro stable coins. Right? There is still a lot of unclarity when it comes to USD stable coins. But back in the days 2021, 2022 people didn't know how mica, which is the set of regulations in Europe would look like and it kind of deterred many people from launching their euro stable coin. Now the the way like it's changed and we see more and more people working on the launch of their euro stable coins and in fact there is no like Euro stable coins that launched, including ourselves. Like we tried to follow the same playbook as other USD stable coins meaning let's go be in defi, let's get listed on exchanges.
00:10:16.165 - 00:11:13.139, Speaker B: And no one tried to do this with a different paradigm that could have led to new use cases in which there would not have been any competition with a USD stablecoin such as what I don't like. To some extent there was a euro stable coin called LUG which was like we're going to launch were going to be used by Casino, which is a large retail group in France and worldwide for their programs of identity. For many different reasons it didn't go through. But if you start as an underdog in the industry, you don't have to start doing as others are doing. Sometimes you have to start another way like out of the box and find like be smarter or focus on something different than something where you know that because of network effects, liquidity issues, you will never be as competitive as the other alternatives.
00:11:13.307 - 00:11:21.731, Speaker A: Okay, so go after a Niche in that case the non defi market where at some point they could have found liquidity.
00:11:21.883 - 00:12:07.253, Speaker B: It's an example like just to say if we want large, like for me the play for a large euro stable coin to take off. Well now there may be some exchanges which are willing to accept more euro stable coins. So this kind of changes the side of things. But to get a massive euro stable coin, I would have imagined that you need to go through one large distribution partner which doesn't have the USDT in mind and is just considering its own use case. And so this would be a cool way to broaden liquidity on the euro stable coin and then, and then make this euro stable coin credible to the eyes of Defi, which despises euro stable coins. I mean not despises, but doesn't even consider euro stable coins so far.
00:12:07.309 - 00:12:23.685, Speaker A: Right. So if you would think of distribution back then you would have a different distribution. Right. You were full speed into the fight, which you seem to say they didn't care. They might still not care because of liquidity, but you would have more going.
00:12:23.725 - 00:13:40.895, Speaker B: To the platforms or I think, I mean it was not our culture. Maybe we wouldn't have done like we are a team of engineers and now it's changing but we're focused maybe too much on the technological aspects of it, building the best protocol and it's how we got finance in the first place. We had a brand new way to do stablecoins which was by the way, not so far from what Ethina is doing right now. We just haven't been able to package it the right way. But yeah, we would have put distribution more at the center and distribution within Defi with respect to distribution with other partners, I think it's an error that many stable coins should do the distribution of a stablecoin today should focus more towards people which have the flow, which control crypto funds, that is to say wallets, custodians, exchanges rather than defi protocols where you'll gain like 1 million, 10 million in TVL from an integration. But everything is so mercenary in Defi and it's easier to consolidate larger deals to grow faster. And then liquidity calls for liquidity and it unlocks all the different integrations and.
00:13:42.195 - 00:13:45.563, Speaker A: This culture shifted in your team and in your.
00:13:45.659 - 00:14:13.651, Speaker B: Yeah, but I guess more globally in the industry. I don't think we've been the only ones going through this way. We're like, hey, let's grow a curve pool then not get listed on AAVE. This will bring us to millions in TVL there are 1 million users in DeFi. Barely there are hundred million users in centralized exchanges. This should be the way to go. Your efforts are 100x more efficient towards centralized exchanges than within Defi.
00:14:13.651 - 00:15:02.507, Speaker B: It's going to take more time. The probability of success is smaller because these guys control the users so they can negotiate more favorable terms for them. But I guess payoffs can be higher in the end and you may disperse yourself if you try to oh, I want to have a pool on stacks. I want to go on this chain. You don't need that many integrations to grow a stable coin in. You need a few of them, but really well thought and really large ones. And at the same time, when you are distributing a stablecoin protocol, you don't want to be to say no or to some opportunities of people who are like hey, I'm going to integrate your stablecoin.
00:15:02.507 - 00:15:38.701, Speaker B: But you know that at max you will have these guys will control 100k of your stablecoin. You still want to speak to everyone because it's like being a vc, like you don't know which one is going to take off and you need to plant your seeds everywhere for and it's free. Basically distribution is free because it's like hey, I have this innovation, I have stablecoin, anyone can permissionlessly integrate it. So let's make sure that we create a safe haven where for developers it's easy to integrate it and people are better off integrating our stablecoins than they are integrating other stablecoin and in that.
00:15:38.733 - 00:15:41.973, Speaker A: Case it's free, but they have incentives to do so.
00:15:42.029 - 00:15:42.293, Speaker B: Right?
00:15:42.349 - 00:15:43.665, Speaker A: What are the incentives?
00:15:44.485 - 00:16:42.013, Speaker B: So it depends. It evolved through our life cycle. Right now the incentives that we offer are twofold. So the yield which I mentioned in introduction, people using our stablecoins get access to a yield in a super passive way that is designed to be the best of what you get in very low risk shotfi and defi settings. Meaning that our USDL product is called stusd. And if I don't know like TBL yield is higher than what you can get by lending in defi, then we'll provide you with the TBL yield if DeFi lending and very low risk defi lending. I'm not speaking about arbitraging the funding rates or anything that sold but if defi lending yields more than tradfi, you get access to this and you don't need to think about rebalancing between your reserves between tradfi or defi doing tax events.
00:16:42.013 - 00:17:44.625, Speaker B: This is all handled automatically and autonomously by angle profit. So you get the yield and you get a pretty nice yield and something which is highly liquid like you can get in, get out, whatever you want. We don't take fees when you come with USDC and we have launched this what we call integration program where basically we give ownership of the protocol to people who use our Stable Coins. It's like with Circle, you don't get the yield and you don't get equity in Circle when in dealing with this. What we're building, it's a community owned stablecoin that's fully decentralized and all our systems are transparently available on chain. Everyone can see like how the administration, everyone is aware of how asset liability management is done on our side. And so it makes sense for us to have large integrators of the stablecoin be able to give their say on how the stablecoin is managed.
00:17:44.625 - 00:18:22.465, Speaker B: And for me that's the best way to. It's also a nice distribution tool because you give people incentives on like the native yield and on the token yield on top. Which yeah, it's something which we have recently launched in this program and which has worked quite well and it's kind of powerful, you know, like don't use this Stable Coin which will like you won't earn anything from it. Use this and it will be your own Stable Coin. And this sense of ownership is kind of important in what we do and what we explain to integrators.
00:18:24.925 - 00:18:50.511, Speaker A: Since we're talking about integrators and distribution. I know you quite a bit so I know that as a team you definitely started to focus on defi and now you're starting to focus maybe more on integrators in crypto. But do you think other companies, maybe payment companies, more web2 companies or tri companies will use stablecoin in the near future? How will they use it?
00:18:50.583 - 00:19:46.135, Speaker B: So I think you need to see it's more like what we do in our objective, our meta. As a company, what I always repeat to my team is our objective is to build infrastructure so finance can be done on chain because for us a more efficient standard and everything that we try to build, we try to build tools that improve the state of finance as it is today to something that is happening on chain. And this is why we do our savings account 2.0 like super transparent. It's better than what you can get in other banking alternatives or whatever. The people you mentioned will start using Defi, not because of the beauty of defi, they will start using it if for them it's a driver of speed and efficiency and if it can be a driver of savings, it can reduce their back office, it can improve their processes. It's the only way.
00:19:46.135 - 00:21:08.049, Speaker B: I mean, unless they all become speculative and try to take their share of the value that's created in this large casino, that defies right now. But people will start using it if rationally they can make savings using blockchain wealth over their traditional wealth. So payment companies will use it if they can get faster, better prices. Banks or savings companies will use it if they can get everything else being equal in terms of risk, higher yields and more preferable payment flow. And you can apply this to every financial vertical in the industry and try to find, okay, where can we improve the processes of these guys and what defi elements could help improve their life? And I think this should be the goal of any defi protocol building with this in mind. And sometimes it's hard because there is this casino culture and you may like you need to serve the wave as a protocol because it's a nice growth element. If restaking is a thing and if you see that you can get some growth with restaking, even if it doesn't fit with within your short term vision, it would be stupid to be like, hey, I'm stubborn on my vision.
00:21:08.049 - 00:21:34.949, Speaker B: My vision is to build the back office or whatever for banks. So sometimes you need to be agile and deal with it. You know, what's going on in industry. But long term you should always keep the northern light of we don't care about it being decentralized. We don't care about, you know, like the libertarian values. I mean we, I personally care about this. But these people, which will make finance and blockchains a thing, will not care about this.
00:21:34.949 - 00:21:45.825, Speaker B: That's right. They will care about am I saving money doing this? And it's what we should be building as a whole. And it's our global meta.
00:21:46.485 - 00:22:21.215, Speaker A: Am I saving money and I'm earning money. So I guess you mentioned about the payment industry that might move to stablecoins and in that case it would be a 5x improvement because you know, there's stable currency in emerging countries, there's noncostal wallet versus a bank that could go default the end of the year and you have savings. So it seems that if it goes on chain and the fees are going down, the remittance company today takes what, 6% fees. It could be a fraction of a penny now on L2 or Solana. So is yields going to be the.
00:22:21.255 - 00:23:02.879, Speaker B: Next business model I mean, um, for me the next business model and what I don't really understand with banks is that people do the difference between debit accounts and savings accounts. Um, and what we try to build with our savings product, we try to build highly liquid savings accounts. So savings accounts which can be used as debit accounts. And if you're a payments company, like usually you want to be able to earn a yield on your idle capital, but at the same time your idle capital, you want it to be like, you want to be able to use it so you can route payments like cross border and do the best of it. And so usually it's hard to strike a good balance between liquidity and yield. In defi.
00:23:03.047 - 00:23:03.959, Speaker A: It's all the same thing.
00:23:04.007 - 00:23:59.583, Speaker B: I mean no, there are like, of course it's normal if there is a yield paid on something, it's that there must be a friction somewhere. But we can build the layers of abstraction to facilitate this to the largest extent possible. And so it applies to payment companies but also to like and we are like working with many of the like cloud providers who and educating them about this idea that a savings account can be a debit account and you can have your euros or dollars which are earning till the very last second at which you are actually getting the payments. Which for me is a game changer. And it applies for like individuals, it can apply for corporates regardless of what they're doing. This is done in the end at the expense of the banking system. Like because banks, their bread and butter is the fact that money that sleeps in their account, they make it work for you, but they don't give you the yield out of this.
00:23:59.583 - 00:24:26.331, Speaker B: Yes. And if like your money is earning, it means that your bank which was normally earning from this money is not earning from anything. So this is for me one of the large broker, you know, like will this transition for into everything is earning a yield and everything is still liquid at the same time. Will this fragilize like the global banks and so the economy as a whole.
00:24:26.483 - 00:25:02.135, Speaker A: But in another way you could think of, you can still apply this business model on chain, right? You can still take fees on chain. It's going to be transparent. It's only going to be open OPEC anymore but there could be more liquidity because now you can, you know, bank the unbanked and you can like propagate the saving accounts to everyone which wasn't really the case. So there's pros and counts. But you seem to say that, I mean definitely it seems that the banks as they are featured today specifically in Europe are not tailored to think that they can benefit from it.
00:25:02.685 - 00:25:56.505, Speaker B: And yeah if you look into it many and it's the case for us at Angular stablecoin protocol it's really close to how a bank operates. Our job is literally the same. Our job is to optimize our balance sheet and while optimizing for liquidity and solvency constraints, you don't want your bank to go bankrupt and you want to be able when you withdraw from your bank to get your funds instantly. We build the same and the tools we. It's not because finance is done on chain that it is different. Like the laws of physics remains or finance remains the laws of finance. We are subject to the same constraints, we just use different trails and what we're defending is just what we believe is a more efficient standard to build these like interactions.
00:25:56.505 - 00:26:43.405, Speaker B: But we're not reinventing finance, we're reinventing the architecture on which finance is, is taking place. So for them I, I believe once they understand that we're just talking about the standard, about APIs, about databases, it would be easy but I guess it's, it's a giant trip for them to, to do but once they start to grasp this they, they will like okay, yeah, maybe I can be better off building on blockchain rails. And I will still be, yeah, I will be able to be more aggressive. It will be possible for me to be more aggressive when it comes to the yield I'm offering and the liquidity I'm offering to my users. Potentially it will reduce their profitability but still.
00:26:43.745 - 00:26:46.405, Speaker A: So do you think they're going to be in the angle of tomorrow.
00:26:48.605 - 00:28:00.737, Speaker B: Down the line? I'm pretty pessimistic. I believe most of us will be absorbed by large banks. It's a game of trust and we are the djens right now playing in defi and interacting with protocols that are really new, even if they are audited and so on. But still and people believe in the trusted environment and they wouldn't put all the life savings in something which is like renewed, which doesn't have decades of existence. So either banks will be distributed like with me under the hood using financial infrastructure like we develop or they will develop their own. But I don't think, and I hope I'm wrong that defi protocols as we know today would be the front facing solutions that everyone starts to use. It's like you know, when you go on an exchange or when you go on a wallet and many newbies, they only trust the wallet environment when they Go to adapt.
00:28:00.737 - 00:28:11.045, Speaker B: They feel that money is leaving their wallet, but if you provide them access to the second same actions within the wallet, they'll be like, oh fine, I'm still within my. And it's, it's going to be the same with banks.
00:28:11.465 - 00:28:45.685, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, we understand this technology very well as a company. Yeah, that makes sense. And maybe just to, to roll back on euro and dollar because you know, again we, we, we've seen that dollar is still, you know, predominant. Why is important for the euro, European Union, European economical entity and central bank to be represented on blockchains? Why do you think it's important?
00:28:46.145 - 00:29:30.205, Speaker B: It's a matter of economic power. If everyone uses it like soft power, if everyone uses your currency, then as a central bank you have more power over the whole global economy. Your voice is more important. It's why, you know, like many countries are threatening the US of not accepting any longer the US dollar for, to sell oil. You know, like it's such an important tool for the US that everyone uses the dollar for like global trading of commodity. And it's the same for stable coins. You know, like the more people use your currency or derivatives based on your currency, the stronger your currency is and the stronger you are as a country or as a set of countries.
00:29:30.205 - 00:29:39.673, Speaker B: And Europe, I don't think they've understood yet that, I mean some of them may have understood but that euro stablecoins are not.
00:29:39.769 - 00:29:41.713, Speaker A: It's a weapon. It's not an enemy. It's a weapon.
00:29:41.769 - 00:29:42.525, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:29:43.225 - 00:30:02.815, Speaker A: And yeah, because for example, like you know, people or companies or the media seems to criticize tether and they might think, okay, they could be an enemy to the Fed or an enemy to the American regulators. But I personally think they are their strongest ally.
00:30:03.355 - 00:30:49.593, Speaker B: Yeah. And the U.S. regulators understood this like they understood that if they went against stablecoins they would lose some pretty important buyers of their treasuries of their debt. And so now they need, they need the stable coins. And if they went against either where there would be 100 billion worth of like US government debt that we dumped into the market, I think it would be pretty bad for the markets as a whole. And so this is why they are not going, this is also why they are not going against them and why the environment around stablecoins in the US have changed because regulators understood that they needed people to buy their debt. And it's I believe a third trick.
00:30:49.769 - 00:31:04.285, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems looking at the mica regulation on stablecoin, so the European regulation on stablecoins that it's essentially Blocking new stablecoin to emerge specifically in Euro. Do you agree with this?
00:31:04.865 - 00:31:54.175, Speaker B: So we're on our side. We're not really concerned by the MICA regulation because M puts an exemption on defi protocols like ours, which works autonomously and so on. Yes, but yes, the set of rules, it's super hard to abide by all the laws and it puts barrier to enter the market, which is bad for competition and which favors either the wealthy ones or the ones which were here before. So I love competition because I believe it's what makes up for a healthy market. And M doesn't really help. It doesn't really help for this. The other thing is that Mika was done to favor the banking system as a whole because it forces stablecoin issuers to keep 30% at their reserves within banks.
00:31:54.175 - 00:32:29.731, Speaker B: But we know that having your money in a bank is not the safest thing you can do. There can be bank failures, we've seen it with the Silicon Valley bank. And you're often better off if your counterparties directly, I don't know the US government or European governments rather than like a shady bank in Europe. And so Mika is supposed to protect like stablecoin users, but potentially it is harming them by increasing the counterparty risk you are facing when you are holding a MICA regulated stablecoin.
00:32:29.843 - 00:32:40.891, Speaker A: Right. And maybe can you deep dive on, you know what happened with SVB and Circle and how did you react as a protocol? Because you were bit impacted at the time.
00:32:41.003 - 00:33:42.691, Speaker B: No more than a bit like so USDC like large USD Stable Coin had I think a lot of their reserves close to 8 billion within the Silicon Valley bank which went bankrupt, but it went bankrupt on, on a Friday evening. So we didn't know like what would be the fair value of the USDC in the first place. We didn't even know how like what proportion of the backing of the USDC was affected and what was the risk of like everything going to zero. So for the weekend, it was like the weekend of the 10th of March in 2023, USDC was trading at like 90 cents. Between 90 cents and like 95 cents. We had 70 million USDC at the time. So we had a protocol which was built around the idea that USDC would fluctuate loosely around $1 and now you have 70 million or something which is only worth not worth $1 but 90 cents.
00:33:42.691 - 00:34:11.235, Speaker B: So it's a bad thing. Our protocol didn't hard code the USDC price at $1. And so it means that people basically used US to buy USDC at 90 cents because everyone made the beta that USDC would go back to price. And so we kind of got, we kind of got armed this way. You know, it starts from a good intention. People tell you don't hard code your oracles into fixed values. Yeah, we did it hardcode, but we lost money out of it.
00:34:11.235 - 00:35:05.707, Speaker B: And so like automatically the system, our system increased in series because it saw that it started to get its USDC reserves depleted. We lost some money out of this. But fortunately like the USDC came back to PEG and like the state, the US government announced that it would bail out the Silicon Valley bank. Everything went fine, but it was for us a good lesson in terms of risk management, in terms of what do you do when there is a black swan? And all our systems and we've released new systems around our stablecoins were built using the lessons we learned from the bank failures. I'm kind of, you know, many, many stable coins, they don't seem to have driven to have taken the lessons like Maker behind. And many of them, they haven't upgraded their system, they haven't upgraded their systems. And what happened to them was pretty bad.
00:35:05.707 - 00:35:57.475, Speaker B: Like they had USDC and GUSD in the reserves, gusd by Gemini which was safe and people did the trade like USDC died to GUSD and all the reserves of maker which were like 50, 50 ended up being made of 100% of USDC which was a weak asset. Normally when there is a black swan, what you need to do is to freeze your reserves and prevent the sequentiality mechanisms that you observe in like bank run mechanisms like where it's like first arrive, first serve, then the first get everything and the last ones get nothing. These systems do not incorporate this. On our side we try to provide more security guarantees to people holding our stablecoins. And so we developed everything with the idea that okay, what would we have loved to see during or loved to have during the US this?
00:35:58.055 - 00:36:04.727, Speaker A: And is it one of the main reason you launched your own dollar stablecoin?
00:36:04.831 - 00:36:45.079, Speaker B: It's one of the reasons we believe our technological infrastructure is superior. But it's like not a 10x and it's like an iterative improvement. I mean it's going to be a 10x when, when a black swan, when a black swan happens. But as it stands in normal conditions it's like just I guess a 10x a 10% improvement over the state of other USD stable coins. And the value in a stable coin doesn't necessarily lie in the technological infrastructure. There is value in this, in Having a stable coin that can optimize for liquidity, for yield. What's important is the distribution and what you the use cases.
00:36:45.079 - 00:37:41.791, Speaker B: You are building a lot of stable coins. What made us interested into developing this USD stablecoins was that you know, we have this cool vision on Forex on chain and we believe that by having a strong euro and a strong dollar stablecoins it would position uniquely in the, in this Forex market. So if you put this Forex idea aside, we're like, yeah, okay, we're going to do a USD stable coin. It's probably going to be 10% better than other ones. If we're good enough at distribution, we may grow it to an interesting place and we're still in this growth phase and negotiating our integrations. But the long term vision is like Forex is necessarily going to be a thing on chain because of atomic settlement, because faster settlement and everything we mentioned earlier on like why banks and cross border companies would use blockchains but it's.
00:37:41.823 - 00:37:50.311, Speaker A: Because you've built these traditional rays on new roles that are working just better and faster, more efficient and at cheaper cost.
00:37:50.383 - 00:38:55.915, Speaker B: Yeah, essentially right now we capture a large portion of the FX rates like people swapping a euro stable coin into a USD stable coin, USD ST stablecoin into a euro stablecoin. We can do better and we are working to do better in terms of liquidity depth, in terms of spread with respect to real FX prices. And we're still developing this infrastructure but for us, yes, and it already works to some levels, but it won't work for tens of millions. But once we manage to make this work at scale then we have a killer product for all the companies doing remittances or doing like for like. I don't know if you've tried to send money abroad from the US to Europe without using like netting solutions like transferwise it takes two days like for your funds to arrive. You don't know when like at what price should be executed. And the system of like international bank transfers with correspondent banks and like SWIFT or ACH transfers, it's a nightmare.
00:38:55.915 - 00:39:16.115, Speaker B: And if you are able to build the rails for on chain payments seamlessly and for on chain payments you need to have this cross currency stuff because not everyone transacts in the first place from USDC or from like USD dominated assets. You need to have a nice engine or infrastructure in the middle.
00:39:16.615 - 00:39:38.389, Speaker A: It's super cool because yeah, it's kind of the first time. I mean I've heard about your product before. I've heard about the Forex advantage, but it's kind of the first time I hear this big focus on, you know, remittances companies as go to market and maybe other payment companies in the future, which I think is, it's, you know, very exciting and I think that's exactly where you should, you should focus on.
00:39:38.437 - 00:40:09.601, Speaker B: Yeah, but there are different ways to capture the market. Like it's not, you know, you can position yourself if you're like, okay, on chain. Forex needs to be a thing. What do we do from here? We have two stable coins which could and will grow bigger than what they are right now. Working on many different initiatives here. Yes, but what do we build to make defi better than what it is today? Is it. Do we arb.
00:40:09.601 - 00:40:43.625, Speaker B: Do we build arbitrage systems, market making systems? Do we build a fully horizontally and vertically integrated company which can abstract away all the complexity of blockchains? Do you deal with the distribution yourself or you just build infrastructure? And it's kind of the research we are conducting at the moment. We know how we can improve the execution of the swaps between our euro to our US destable coin. But maybe there is a way to build a system which is more global and which would benefit more and provide more value to everyone in the long term.
00:40:43.795 - 00:40:46.265, Speaker A: So what do you think you're going to be building in five years?
00:40:46.845 - 00:40:57.501, Speaker B: In five years for sure I will still be building in the open financial, like open finance. I don't like the term defi, even though I use it a lot because.
00:40:57.533 - 00:41:07.133, Speaker A: It'S practical, because it's associated to the GN world versus like it's basically making finance or the financial system open.
00:41:07.309 - 00:41:10.381, Speaker B: Yeah, or decentralized. Not everything needs to be decentralized.
00:41:10.453 - 00:41:24.315, Speaker A: That's right, it's a spectrum. Whereas the biggest advantage with blockchains and open finance is bringing is basically transparency, openness, efficiency, smaller cost. But decentralization is always a spectrum.
00:41:24.355 - 00:41:24.723, Speaker B: Right.
00:41:24.819 - 00:41:27.171, Speaker A: And you don't have to fully optimize for.
00:41:27.243 - 00:41:34.795, Speaker B: I mean, it's beautiful. Some important parts of the stack are decentralized, immutable. I mean not necessarily decentralized, but immutable.
00:41:34.875 - 00:41:37.029, Speaker A: Images, which are two different things.
00:41:37.107 - 00:41:44.305, Speaker B: Yes, yes. Immutable is better because Node gives everyone the clarity of. Okay, these are the specifications. This is not going to change.
00:41:44.385 - 00:41:45.337, Speaker A: I can trust it.
00:41:45.441 - 00:42:17.969, Speaker B: Yeah. And it's not like building over the Twitter API. And I know that I spend a year, if I spend a year building on this, it will still be the same. So you need to have the immutable stack, the things that are stable, that everyone agrees on. And then you can build services which are operated in a decentralized way. It's what we do at the moment because there is value in the pre visibility of the governance decision, of the allocation decisions. There is value in having the consensus, the global consensus in terms of what's most efficient for the stablecoin.
00:42:17.969 - 00:42:49.191, Speaker B: But sometimes there are other systems which would benefit also from being able to move faster, from not having to face the long discussions times, long discussion times we have with daos. In our case, dao is kind of previsible. But there are some cases in which it's a nightmare to navigate all this and very often it's used as a way to do regulatory arbitrage, which I don't think is the right reason for which people should do decentralized protocols.
00:42:49.303 - 00:43:03.715, Speaker A: Right. And I guess maybe very open question or where you hope defi is going to be in five years, in which hands? Open finance, let's call it this way.
00:43:04.235 - 00:43:59.657, Speaker B: I hope that it will be invisible that people will be able to use systems like banking systems, remittance companies, the same tools as they use today, but without knowing that there is a blockchain layer under the hood. If defi is invisible, it's better and that's one way to view it. Or the other way is making defi invisible in another way. The UX of Web2 companies, it took some time to arrive to the consensus that the maximum you can accept from a user is that their account is their email and their password. We still haven't found yet in crypto what we can expect from a not so well educated user. Maybe it's should we ask them to understand that their private key, it's the most important thing, they should then give it away. Or can we abstract more layers of.
00:43:59.681 - 00:44:32.049, Speaker A: This and I think we can. Right? Like what I'm very excited about these days and that's why I think DEFI could be invisible in the hands of hundreds of millions or billions of users in the coming years. We're not talking 20 years, but we're talking five to seven years. Maximum is account abstraction, right? For example, where it's like you have a pass key, you forgot the email, so it's better than web2even. And your private key is your face ID or is your digital ID and in two clicks you have a wallet. Do you think that could fix.
00:44:32.097 - 00:45:09.293, Speaker B: No, no. Yeah, definitely, I agree. But I still don't know whether this will be enough, whether users will still be fine accepting this and maybe there will be other iterations on top. But this implies that the gist of like people interacting with DEFI systems will be interacting on their own using their passkeys and so on, and not with the systems we know today. I believe this is a better future to have everyone using passkeys. I don't know whether the UX will still be too complex for it to be acceptable. Hard to say, but it's not my specialty at all.
00:45:09.293 - 00:45:48.829, Speaker B: And I'm glad there are many like smart teams, way smarter than we are developing these systems because it's what we all need. And even like we accept things which we shouldn't accept when we deal with protocols and stuff like the. Yeah, it's far too complex what people expect from users. And even if it doesn't reach the promise of being usable by billions of people, if it's still usable by 10x more people than R can use, the people who can use Defi now, it will still be a good outcome, I believe.
00:45:48.927 - 00:46:09.953, Speaker A: Yes, and I agree. And I think that's what we should optimize together. What should we wish you as a contributor of the Angular protocol and for your team, where can we find you also on social media? Two very different questions. But yeah, where can we wish you.
00:46:10.129 - 00:46:52.545, Speaker B: So you can reach out to us on Twitter on Discord Angel Protocol is on Twitter. We have the link of our Discord Discord there myself also on Twitter. And what you can wish us is so one obviously growth of our stablecoins unlocking like several key distribution deals. That's the number one thing. And the second thing is what you can wish us is what you can wish to the whole industry. It's to build products that are used out of any mercenary consideration, out of any token incentives points or whatever. But build to have products that are used by everyone, by people out of the industry for the practical.
00:46:52.545 - 00:46:54.329, Speaker B: For the practicality it brings them.
00:46:54.417 - 00:47:02.681, Speaker A: That's right. I love this. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast, Pablo. And yeah, I hope to see you soon for a new announcement.
00:47:02.753 - 00:47:03.825, Speaker B: Thank you, thank you, thank you. Lasso.
