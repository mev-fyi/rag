00:00:07.240 - 00:00:13.161, Speaker A: Sergey, thanks for coming Paris to see us in the office. I'm very glad to have you.
00:00:13.313 - 00:00:16.577, Speaker B: It's a pleasure. Thank you very much for inviting and.
00:00:16.641 - 00:00:22.725, Speaker A: We discussed quite a few topics before the podcast, but maybe can you introduce yourself again?
00:00:23.105 - 00:00:59.295, Speaker B: Yeah. My name is Sergey Kuns. I'm a software engineer, software architect, co founder of 1inchh Network, together with my co founder Andon lukov. Back in 2018 we were traveling around the globe participating in hackathons. So our background is kind of tech guys who just love to compete to build. And one of the hackathons we have built, One Age, the first version of the first prototype in New York City were two sleepless nights. Um, so my, my kind of background was I was in multiple companies.
00:00:59.295 - 00:01:27.095, Speaker B: Um, I was working in startups, aggregation startups. Built my own aggregator for Telecommunication back in 2011 and was working for consulting companies. Did projects at Porp, at Bosch, Siemens. At the end I, I was Porsche employee before I started completely with 1inchh. Yeah, this is kind of my story.
00:01:27.435 - 00:01:31.171, Speaker A: And that was when you were in Stuttgart back then, right?
00:01:31.243 - 00:02:07.587, Speaker B: Yes, yes. I was born in Siberia, in Russia, the deepest Siberia, where it was very close. And because of my German rules, we migrated to Germany in 99 and grew up in Germany. So I would say I'm more German and like Swabian person and. Yeah. And moved one day to Stuttgart to take new opportunities, started to work in a startup, Indonesian startup. So then was living there for around 10 years.
00:02:07.587 - 00:02:16.765, Speaker B: Nowadays I'm more in Dubai than in Germany, but still travel to Germany and also kind of base partially in Stuart stuff.
00:02:17.305 - 00:02:37.465, Speaker A: And I would, I mean I would ask why in Dubai, but. But maybe first, can you please let me know why did you fall into the rabbit hole? The crypto rabbit hole? You were mentioning mining previously. Yeah. What talked to you back then when you saw crypto first?
00:02:37.625 - 00:03:22.975, Speaker B: So Crypto first was 2011. So one of my colleagues on the aggregation startup, they said, oh, did you see crypto? This crypto, there's Litecoin, Bitcoin, you can mine litecoin on your MacBook. And I tried a little bit out and I didn't give attention on this technology somehow because I didn't get additional information. I started to get in 2016, like Twitter and so on. It was like not very popular in Germany back to the days. Also in Facebook was nothing about crypto. And somehow I lost the path with crypto.
00:03:22.975 - 00:04:03.481, Speaker B: And then end of 2016, I discovered on YouTube, one guy just explained that he can teach how to build a mining grid for Ethereum. Then I started to discover, oh, what is ethereum? Oh, this bitcoin. Oh, I remember I mined litecoin and then I took a look and I did like 2000 X's on Litecoin, but had only a small amount of money back in 2011. So I withdraw salt and understood. Okay, this looks very interesting. It looks from a feeling this is something huge. Yeah.
00:04:03.481 - 00:04:29.923, Speaker B: And I started to mine. I built mining with and that guy, you know, like, building computers was also my hobby back into like when I was 16 or something. And I started to discover more and more. And then one day I met Anton through a common friend. She was introduced to me and. Yeah, it's kind of a really long story.
00:04:30.019 - 00:04:33.107, Speaker A: That was much before you started One inch, right?
00:04:33.211 - 00:05:15.463, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, it was before one inch. So we were introduced to Anton a half year. We didn't communicate with him. He helped me a little bit when I tried to sell bitcoin. I had a wallet and I had a lot of small bitcoin transactions coming to the wallet because I was kind of mining through nice hash or something. So I got little transactions on bitcoin and it was very expensive to make one transaction of whole bitcoins because the architecture of bitcoin, you have a lot of small pieces, then it costs a lot to transfer them. So he helped me to explain.
00:05:15.463 - 00:05:52.811, Speaker B: And then I started my YouTube channel, called it Cryptomaniac. So maniac, in terms of like someone who gives always more than 100 percentages. So if I want to do something what I like and I see opportunity, I give everything. So if I start something, I give everything. It doesn't matter what it is. It can be sports or I have second brown bot and Shotokan Karata. So, um, I did Muay Thai, MMA and then now Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, all that.
00:05:52.883 - 00:05:54.211, Speaker A: So you still, you still practice?
00:05:54.323 - 00:05:54.859, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:05:54.907 - 00:05:55.275, Speaker A: Okay.
00:05:55.355 - 00:06:05.747, Speaker B: It's. It's like chess, you know, you have a lot of options when you roll. It's also good for. Healthy for the body from. I can do it until 70 or 80 years.
00:06:05.811 - 00:06:14.221, Speaker A: I'm a big fan of MMA in general. So you. So you. So you more. You're more of a MMA fighter than a special fighter, you would say.
00:06:14.323 - 00:06:57.555, Speaker B: Um, you know, I'm. I'm fan of Bruce Lee and I was from the beginning kind of. I had my posters when I was 14, 15, 16, and I did like videos like back in. Back in these days when I was 15, cutting Apple by hitting with two fingers. So, like, yeah, nowadays I'm like, I like BJJ because I don't get punches on my face, on the head and I don't. I have 10 problems after that. So I recognized when I did Muay Thai that it can be a little bit difficult and dangerous because you can get some punches and then on the next day I see double.
00:06:57.555 - 00:07:02.927, Speaker B: That's why BJ is very healthy.
00:07:03.031 - 00:07:08.471, Speaker A: Yeah, you can practice every morning, otherwise it would be hard for you to build one inch at the same time.
00:07:08.503 - 00:07:43.413, Speaker B: Right? Yeah, it's kind of. Boxing is cool, you know, it's a sport, you know, it's sport. You need healthy proportions of everything. So back to the story. I had this cryptomaniac YouTube channel and I just tried to train how to speak in front of people, you know, and I just spoke about cryptocurrencies mining. Explain what like graphic card in English or German? It was, it was Russian. Russian, Yes.
00:07:43.413 - 00:08:28.097, Speaker B: I had already like I collected small community with around 12,000 people who watched me. And sometimes I did live streams just for fun. I took a beer, German beer, like a dark beer and just did my live streams and spoke about crypto mining or just discover something in Internet or like how to generate a beautiful bitcoin address. Then I recognized there were some projects, scam projects, Ponzi schemes. We use smart contract and said it is a safe project because it uses smart contracts. And I like guys don't invest in Ponzi schemes. This is a program, it runs on Ethereum blockchain.
00:08:28.097 - 00:08:39.115, Speaker B: I'm not an expert, but we will find it out now. So together. So I went through the documentation, found the smart contract and like discovered source code of the smart contract is not pop.
00:08:39.195 - 00:08:39.855, Speaker A: Okay.
00:08:40.555 - 00:08:58.095, Speaker B: In this process, Anton was also watching me because maybe it was fun for him. And he wrote to me, let me join this live stream. I can help you with the smart contracts. Because he had already a good experience. He participated already in hackathons and worked already for a startup.
00:08:59.235 - 00:09:01.895, Speaker A: And you didn't even know him before. Right.
00:09:02.715 - 00:09:43.731, Speaker B: We were introduced and had little conversation with him and she jumped into the live stream directly. And after that we spent like half year on YouTube and we streamed like six to eight hours, sometimes 10 hours a piece. We had like thousands of people watching us. Like did security audits of smart contracts. So we just picked one of the projects. What was out there? It was like this crypto Russian speaking space and we discovered back doors. We discovered also bugs as well.
00:09:43.883 - 00:09:44.691, Speaker A: In life, right?
00:09:44.723 - 00:10:20.791, Speaker B: In live stream. Yeah, it was live stream and I was threatened that someone come and kill me because they didn't like it. Because we like, oh, this is piece of shit, this is Ponzi scheme, don't invest in this. And they really threatened me. I went also to the German police and at the end the police said like, you can protect yourself, we cannot help you because these people are from not in Germany now. They cannot ask telegram to give you IP address, whatever. And I asked them what they do and they said self defense and ask what it means.
00:10:20.791 - 00:10:58.867, Speaker B: And they said like okay, you can buy a gun. I went to the shop, it is fully legal in Germany to buy a gas gun, you know, right? With the bullets, like this, like not really bullets, it's like special gas and all that. And I just bought it. I ordered bulletproof vest and enabled live stream. And I was reading the bulletproof vest and took the gun and said, guys, if you're threatening me, I'm here, you're welcome. So if this is my friend, she will help me. So it was like a little bit short as well.
00:10:58.867 - 00:11:44.041, Speaker B: So yeah, it was funny. It was really kind of funny. Funny time a little bit also show on YouTube but really helpful. A lot of people also learned how to write solidity and what not to do in the solidity code by watching our live streams. I know someone who became CTO in a good defi project just watching, just with the background that he watched all the videos we had really a lot, you know, wow, you spend half year almost every day with a lot of hours on live streams. And I have still all the videos but we disabled it because like this crazy shit with the web, you know, like hey, you cannot show it on.
00:11:44.073 - 00:11:48.833, Speaker A: How just as the co founder of 1 inch you cannot put it.
00:11:48.889 - 00:12:15.145, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. Sometimes you need to be crazy. If you get like crazy crazy things like we will come and going to kill you, you need to be crazy. And I told them guys, I'm many ex come up and crypto my accurate. Yeah. And then one day, I guess it was December, on November 2018, Anton asked me to join the hackathon in Singapore. ATH Global Hackathon.
00:12:15.145 - 00:12:35.653, Speaker B: And I actually declined because I had some problems with my back to the day's wife. She started to think about to get divorced and told me I should move out of our apartment. We were living with our daughter and I thought okay, fuck off, I'm going to go to Singapore.
00:12:35.749 - 00:12:39.893, Speaker A: So you're taking a plane and you joined Anton Singapore?
00:12:39.949 - 00:13:10.355, Speaker B: Yeah, we met in Turkey together and then we were flying together then an airplane to Singapore and overnight we just built a small application and we got grant from MakerDAO from Kyber and from said product. And we were like, wow, it's working. We didn't expect it. And we understood that with our professional experience and as a software engineers and that we can actually build overnight or maybe tonight something that can generate money. And this money we can use to travel again. So we can.
00:13:10.395 - 00:13:12.315, Speaker A: That was already the idea of one.
00:13:12.355 - 00:13:54.279, Speaker B: Inch or no idea at all on every hackathon. We just came to something when we were there speaking with sponsors, when we were thinking, okay, what kind of bounty we can get from the sponsor, what we can build, what makes sense potentially. We have built, for example in South Africa, decentralized live streaming platform where people see a live stream and pay for each kilobyte by using payment channels. Payment channels you use from RAID Network. Unfortunately they actually stopped the development. But it was really nice idea. If you want good quality of a stream, you just pay more because you pay for each kilobyte.
00:13:54.279 - 00:14:19.443, Speaker B: If you don't pay, you don't get the stream. And it was highly decentralized by using web RTC technology. So in the first night I had already live streamed to the Internet to our community and they were watching us for free. And then we showed to raiden network on the hackathon. On the last day, this guy said, I need to sit. It cannot be. It's really the best use case he has ever seen.
00:14:19.443 - 00:14:28.175, Speaker B: And still we met after four years. Then recently in our conference, he said it's still the best use case he has ever seen.
00:14:28.705 - 00:14:34.325, Speaker A: But you could have launched 1 inch or a decentralized streaming payment system.
00:14:35.265 - 00:15:09.199, Speaker B: Not like decentralized video streaming, platinum streaming platform, but you know, like we just built something on the hackathon. We didn't continue to work on these projects until the hackathon because it was nice. Funny to just. We couldn't imagine that we can actually build a startup out of the projects. We just build it because it was fun, it was cool. It was also good for us because I improved my delivery a lot. Although when I was working for Porsche, I improved my working very much.
00:15:09.199 - 00:15:23.909, Speaker B: Because over the hackathon you have to concentrate on a product you need to deliver in two nights, you have less sleep. And at the end, in the last, we did like 17 hackathons in one year.
00:15:24.015 - 00:15:27.632, Speaker A: In one and a half years, right?
00:15:27.738 - 00:15:36.674, Speaker B: Less than one and a half years. Wow. After Covid came. So like from December 2018 to.
00:15:36.781 - 00:15:42.047, Speaker A: No, February 2020 and the last one was ETHCC 2020.
00:15:42.111 - 00:15:42.287, Speaker B: Right.
00:15:42.311 - 00:15:45.975, Speaker A: You came in Paris at the time before COVID hit.
00:15:46.135 - 00:16:06.881, Speaker B: No, no, we didn't participate, but we were in London. In London we did also cool things. We did like a leverage. Like creating tokenized leverage position on AAVE or compound. So we did it already 2020. It's actually a nice thing. You know, you can just create a easy leverage position and say, okay, I don't want to be liquidated.
00:16:06.881 - 00:16:25.569, Speaker B: So if I lose 50 percentages, deposition should be closed. So this kind of intense. We already implemented back in 2020. Yeah. So we have built a lot of really cool stuff. Some of them we are using as well. The QR codes you get on our booth on the airdrop.
00:16:25.569 - 00:16:46.273, Speaker B: This we have built here in Paris. Paris back in 2019. But didn't get anything for this because no one understood it. I guess how cool this is. It's like physical airdrops and funny fact. Maybe no one knows about that. Stani from Avio back to the days it was Eth.
00:16:46.273 - 00:16:56.477, Speaker B: Schlatt was also here and as a sponsor on the hackathon. And we came with flashlights to him. So we gave him the flashlight.
00:16:56.581 - 00:16:57.469, Speaker A: The ideal flashlight.
00:16:57.517 - 00:17:16.764, Speaker B: Yeah, we gave all the codes of the flashlights and yeah, actually we are in charge of this. That our introduced looks like that. I spoke also with Stania about that and she said yeah, it's okay guys. They didn't talk about us, but it's okay. It's okay.
00:17:18.464 - 00:17:19.880, Speaker A: He never credit you for this.
00:17:19.912 - 00:17:35.608, Speaker B: Yeah, never. But it's okay. It's fine. It's fine. It's really cool to see that people use what we come to. Same with what I see. Also in Uniswap they introduce Uniswap X.
00:17:35.608 - 00:17:59.819, Speaker B: If you look in the white paper, we are in the first position of the resources. They took a look on us. It's really great credit that they just use our technology or our ideas. They say I guess they can buy themselves to them. But anyway, they mention us. We saw already credits. Yeah, it's cool.
00:17:59.819 - 00:18:09.129, Speaker B: It's cool that it's a good motivation. You build something or you invest time something what is used by other people. But I don't need direct breaking.
00:18:09.297 - 00:18:22.713, Speaker A: That's the ethos of blockchains and crypto in a way. Right. You build something, it's open source. It's a smart contract. They can look at the design and they use it, copy it and rebuild something on top. I guess.
00:18:22.809 - 00:18:51.047, Speaker B: Yeah, it's okay. It's not the first time. When we started fugation. So one niche was built on a hackathon in New York. Maybe 2019, the 19th of May we were just walking around. I was walking around the hackathon venue spot with all the sponsors and then we came with Anton to the idea. Oh, it made sense maybe to make one trading venue where you get all the liquidity.
00:18:51.047 - 00:19:33.291, Speaker B: And we shouldn't just show what liquidity sources are there. We should maybe use an algorithm what combine all liquid sources by splitting among multiple liquid sources in the same time. And this for one transaction was something new. No one did before. Someone told me that they do this, but I couldn't see that they use it. They said that they aggregate decentralized exchanges and we couldn't prove it. Anyway, it was afterwards kind of.
00:19:33.291 - 00:20:11.525, Speaker B: I was working on the. I came to Vitalik Butarian spoke with them, with them. He said that someone said that they do it, but I never could prove it. At the end we just did it just for us because we had already kind of. Anton sometimes bought some tokens sold because he was also active in defi. Back to the days actually to 2019, there was no naming DeFi or Web3 from open. We just spoke about Ethereum and blockchain.
00:20:11.525 - 00:20:32.705, Speaker B: And I was arbitruging as well. So this approach with the splitting among these different liquid sources. I had the idea about like this because I did arbitrage trading. Like I wrote my own arbitrage trader who use multiple liquidity source, not arbitrage. Amnon, Uniswap, Kyber and Bangkok.
00:20:35.205 - 00:20:39.037, Speaker A: So you would arbitrage between dexes already back.
00:20:39.141 - 00:21:09.569, Speaker B: I experimented with this to get the knowledge. So I understood how all the mms working, how to integrate them, how to interact with them and it helped a lot on the hackathon as well. So and Anton, we built. Anton built smart contract the algorithm because I was very, very bad in algorithm and we had no chatgpt back to the days. Nowadays it's easier. So I can ask ChatGPT. Okay, I need min cost max flow algorithm and they can suggest something and.
00:21:09.577 - 00:21:14.465, Speaker A: Then you would tweak it and change the parameters. But at least you have the framework from ChatGPT, right?
00:21:14.505 - 00:21:38.461, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, you can, you can. Like normally I ask people, you know, if someone. Degree. I have no degrees. Yeah, so someone has a degree and maybe some experience in specific field. I try to ask them, okay, how does it work? Why this? Why this? And then I try to collect knowledge, you know, and then to work with this knowledge that afterwards. Yeah, and with Anton, he's very, very educated, very smart guy, highly intelligent.
00:21:38.461 - 00:21:43.197, Speaker B: And I say I'm not intelligent at all. I just, I try to be sometimes.
00:21:43.221 - 00:21:45.229, Speaker A: Smart and just ask questions.
00:21:45.277 - 00:22:09.675, Speaker B: Yeah. And then, you know, like when you have a lot of information, you can then just build something about that. Yeah. And like, yeah, we have built it just for us. On the hackathon, I pitched to everyone. So really like if there was a doc, I pitched to the dog, there was a guy who was cleaning toilets, I pitched to that as well. So it's really to everyone.
00:22:09.675 - 00:22:36.019, Speaker B: And we didn't win anything except 300 bucks from ENS because I integrated EMS in the last second, I was able to pay my airplane ticket back to Stuttgart. And after like two weeks, Anton called me in the night. He calls me in the night and says, sergey, we have volume. And like, what. What are you speaking about or what are you talking about? And he said, like onto one inch we have volume, people are using it.
00:22:36.187 - 00:22:40.035, Speaker A: You. You already call it one inch back then or.
00:22:40.075 - 00:22:41.011, Speaker B: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
00:22:41.083 - 00:22:43.371, Speaker A: So the. The first iteration, you call it one inch.
00:22:43.403 - 00:23:07.675, Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. On a hackathon we. We were thinking, okay, we. We came to an idea to agree decentralized and we didn't know how to call it. And I told Anton we should call 1-800-I said like, I'm a Bruce Lee fan. So I was like really a freaky, freaky Bruce Lee fan when I was 15, like really cutting apples with two fingers like this introduces.
00:23:07.675 - 00:23:43.233, Speaker B: I have still this video. But I told them like we came to something what is highly efficient. And Bruce Lee did everything highly efficient and like a pro, you know, like he never did something as an amateur. He did like a pro, everything. He was cha cha cha champion, kung fu champion, movie star, you know. And he did this one inch punch. So and I told Anton, you do this one inch punch and on blockchain and if one single transaction swap by exchanges.
00:23:43.233 - 00:24:11.021, Speaker B: Yeah. So this was my piece also on the day on a hackathon for the judges. Yeah, no one understood it, but like from the judges. But one guy said, this is the next big thing, trust me. It was the co organizer of ETH Global, Liam. And I didn't trust him. So how said Anton after two weeks called me and explained lie volume.
00:24:11.021 - 00:24:15.185, Speaker B: And then I created social media account.
00:24:16.105 - 00:24:18.325, Speaker A: So it's funny, you built it.
00:24:21.425 - 00:24:21.761, Speaker B: You.
00:24:21.793 - 00:24:23.405, Speaker A: Knew it was a cool idea.
00:24:23.865 - 00:24:34.009, Speaker B: It was helpful for us because I had also already some assets where I just arbitraged. And Anton also did some arbitrage we just built for us. Right.
00:24:34.137 - 00:24:38.765, Speaker A: But he understood afterwards that it was did.
00:24:39.105 - 00:25:14.121, Speaker B: Yeah, we understood that people are using it and we found out it's cool to work like on a Pet project maybe in the nights after the work I was already living in the office. I had my freedom, you know, I could travel around the globe. I had still my daughter three, four days and after that I had free time. And also when she was sleeping at 8, I had time until maybe 2, 3am to work on it. Then at 7am I woke up for the normal job. So I was sleeping to this time. 2019, early 2020.
00:25:14.121 - 00:25:16.849, Speaker B: Only three, five hours a day.
00:25:16.897 - 00:25:21.057, Speaker A: Wow. Being a dad in building a startup and having a day job.
00:25:21.201 - 00:26:01.005, Speaker B: Yes Coach, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, we actually didn't build a startup, you know, we had no company. We were just contributing to open source, you know, like of course our front end was kind of close, but all our smart contracts were like under MIT license, open source and people started to copy us. Dexag copied us and we came and they said like guys, if you copy us, it's okay, it's under MIT license, but there's copyright, you need to mention us. That's right. And they said no, we did it by ourselves. We invented.
00:26:01.005 - 00:26:26.575, Speaker B: And they had really huge reputation. And then I did some research and I came with a link to GitHub with the piece of code what is exactly the same as we wrote and our code is older than them and the namings of the function is like Russian, English.
00:26:29.705 - 00:26:31.769, Speaker A: It's you know, like it's Russian at all.
00:26:31.897 - 00:27:13.733, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, but Andon wrote it, you know, it was like really Russian, English naming and no one would do it. We know from these guys and we proved that it's true that they copied us and they deleted this from GitHub. Of course I have screenshots and everything. And we found another repository where it was forked from and they still discord existing. So they copied us and lied to the community and used own reputation to just say okay you guys, your piece of shit, go away, you have no credits. And we were just like okay guys, it's okay, it's fine. It's stupid.
00:27:13.733 - 00:27:34.479, Speaker B: Yeah, if you like, it's defi. It's like if you are using us, just write down this from us. It's okay. Yeah, a lot of shishtorm. But it's also good because we got a lot of attention. People started to also look at us, use us. And we had really no company.
00:27:34.479 - 00:27:48.193, Speaker B: We just contributed like, worked in the night, we didn't earn anything. Traveled around the globe participating in the hackathons, collected a lot of contacts, built a network of people that we, that.
00:27:48.209 - 00:27:49.449, Speaker A: We use it and.
00:27:49.577 - 00:28:05.529, Speaker B: And now like when we were 2020 and we got funded by the community. We got like 60k. It's also fun story. There was one guy in Gitcoin they wanted to give us 5k but had fat fingers and gave us 50k. Yeah.
00:28:05.697 - 00:28:06.793, Speaker A: Is it a true story?
00:28:06.849 - 00:28:08.045, Speaker B: What? Yeah, yeah.
00:28:09.905 - 00:28:11.833, Speaker A: About to sing 5K.
00:28:11.969 - 00:28:26.825, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. You know Gitcoin, like it was. It was 20, 20, 2019. You could just. As a project can. Can. You could get grants from there from the community and also from the Ethereum foundation, some others.
00:28:26.825 - 00:28:49.899, Speaker B: And when you got $1, you could maybe get for this $10 because there was additional funding. And this guy just sent 50k. And we were like, whoa. And we worked with memes. You need to take a look on Back to the days on the memes. It was really funny. And we like posted a meme like right now in the 1 inch garage.
00:28:49.899 - 00:29:21.309, Speaker B: And this is kind of a picture from Breaking Bad when these guys were like on the money in the garage. You remember? Yeah, we were like jogging a little bit around and then we wrote to this guy, just this mistake, right? And he said like, yeah, I guess this is mistake, but it's okay. I had fat fingers. Keep it, you deserve. And we're like, oh man, 50k. This is a lot of money. And you know, I was living in a shit office with no money.
00:29:21.309 - 00:29:37.709, Speaker B: And I had also like minus €50,000 in my bank account, you know. And like, oh. And we said, okay, we don't take the money, we don't pay it to us. It's okay. We invest. We can still live. You know how we live.
00:29:37.709 - 00:30:02.053, Speaker B: Anton was also working on Near Protocol in this time. And I had also job. I actually had food, I had. We had to sleep. Not the best place, but it's okay. And we thought we were thinking about, okay, we used this money, we hire someone. So we hired Kirill, one of our friends, also hackathon guy who can deliver in two nights without sleep, anything.
00:30:02.109 - 00:30:03.345, Speaker A: He was 20 years old, right?
00:30:03.389 - 00:30:30.645, Speaker B: He was 20 years old. Yeah. He's a technical lead for microservices right now. Leading 20 people right now. Yeah, this guy is really smart, highly motivated. He don't care about kind of to just make money. He love to build things what are used by a lot of people, you know.
00:30:30.645 - 00:30:55.595, Speaker B: And yeah, she started to help us actually. Anton said like, this is a stupid idea. You want to hire people to manage them or something? And I said like, this is not hiring. This is just. We use the community funds from the community and we get additional contributor. Yeah, yeah. There was no company or Something we just gave this guy money to contribute.
00:30:56.135 - 00:30:59.133, Speaker A: I'm just in financing contribution.
00:30:59.279 - 00:31:19.681, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like a friendship. I would say what we have and had in the beginning. Like, we asked him if she would like to contribute. Like we contribute and she get money for this. And she said like, we told him we don't get anything. It's okay. It's just cool that we have something like this.
00:31:19.681 - 00:31:36.325, Speaker B: And we just paid him and he started to contribute. And then more contributors came and one day. And we tried to race as well From I guess September 2019, but no one wanted to give us money.
00:31:36.365 - 00:31:37.181, Speaker A: It was a hard time.
00:31:37.253 - 00:31:51.933, Speaker B: Yeah, they said like, you know, you had luck. Most like there were people like investors said like famous investors. Well, you. You just two Russian guys. You had just luck. You will not never build luck for.
00:31:51.949 - 00:31:54.423, Speaker A: What you mean like the Arctic is built something.
00:31:54.479 - 00:32:10.543, Speaker B: And because. Because like we got some traction people using the product. And they said, like, you will never make it. You know, you will never build something huge out of this. You have not even a company. And we're like, okay. And then I understood to investors back then already, right.
00:32:10.543 - 00:32:25.875, Speaker B: Yeah, we see. We see with a lot of experience and you know, like. And what. That's why I'm. I have this kind of manic mindset. So if I do something, I do it to more than 100 percentages. I did at least 1000 pictures in my life.
00:32:25.875 - 00:32:40.447, Speaker B: I pitched to everyone. So. And based on the pictures I recognize, okay, these people ask almost the same questions. So that means I need proper response. Like. Like I need proper. Like I need play playbook.
00:32:40.447 - 00:32:55.355, Speaker B: Yeah. I need to respond properly to these questions. Yeah. So it makes sense and it should be true as well. So. And at the end I figured out and yeah, I pitched properly to. Then at the end to everyone.
00:32:55.355 - 00:33:19.905, Speaker B: And someone at the end, we were also discussing with Binance. They were interested by CZ somehow took it like lazy, you know, they didn't. They didn't invest time to close the deal. And Dragonfly came, said the guys, shut the fuck up. Take our money. You are two and a half men. You have this amount of volume.
00:33:19.905 - 00:33:39.055, Speaker B: We don't care if you don't have a company. Just do a proper setup. And we invest. Yeah, we created. We asked help from lawyers. And they suggested to go with international setup because we. I was in Germany.
00:33:39.055 - 00:34:24.155, Speaker B: Anton was still in Russia. Then he moved to Amsterdam. Kirill was also in Russia, I guess. And then he moved also to Dubai were distributed more people came as a contributor. And they suggested international setup with A British Virgin island company with additional board of directors in Japan and on for bvi. And I not only contributed technically kind of and got more and more people into the setup and we raised in 2020 seed round and the demand was very high. After three months we announced Series A.
00:34:24.155 - 00:34:45.607, Speaker B: So actually we closed series eight directly after seed round. Because seed round three months after survey. Actually it was in the same time like Seun was full and we added just to the Series A and we announced three months later Series A. So it was total 12 millions of west dollars or something.
00:34:45.791 - 00:35:02.155, Speaker A: And imagine I would be Dragonfly back then or you know, one of the thousand person you pitched the company. What would you pitch and what would you say? Okay, one inch is very important because of this.
00:35:03.535 - 00:35:35.575, Speaker B: I pitched it like just the more efficient thing compared to everything with this existing. So people use Uniswap, use some other Dexs directly, but it's not efficient. We have something highly. We create a new market, aggregation market. No one did aggregation before us. Azure X joined and so on afterwards Parasol came also from Paris. They just try to do the same what we do.
00:35:35.575 - 00:35:56.495, Speaker B: Yeah, I just pitched like this is something what is more efficient and more efficient will take over. And you see uniswap is introducing aggregation by Uniswap X. So everyone it makes sense. It makes sense. It's more efficient for the user. And anyway the user will be ours.
00:35:56.985 - 00:36:00.737, Speaker A: And you have kind of a monopoly.
00:36:00.801 - 00:36:02.457, Speaker B: Now in markets, or at least a.
00:36:02.481 - 00:36:09.765, Speaker A: Very big market share. What do you think that is compared to some competitors that you cited in Solbecs or Parasol?
00:36:10.225 - 00:36:55.675, Speaker B: I wouldn't say that we have monopoly. We have good players out there who have also market shares. They are different markets. There's a aggregation market means we have integration. Metamask, Binance Wallet, Trust Wallet, Exodus Wallet, some other wallets. We offer aggregation as a service, of course, our foundation run the front end and use our APIs from the labs as well. This is on market compared to the market of where user swap, user swap on Metamask, user swap on Trust Wallet, user swap a lot of Trust Wallet on Trust Wallet on Uniswap.
00:36:55.675 - 00:37:13.991, Speaker B: So if you compare then of course we have our dapp. We have our mobile wallets as well. If you compare, we are like almost the same with Uniswap here. Actually when you take the front end.
00:37:14.063 - 00:37:19.647, Speaker A: Applications, the volume, if you compare the Dexs and the aggregation.
00:37:19.751 - 00:37:44.365, Speaker B: Basically if you compare just you take DAPP of uniswap, dapp of 1 inch and wallets from uniswap mongo wallets and the volume is almost the same. So we were here. Yeah, they were really high. And then we came here and we are competing with each other. We introduced it. Now the intent, bad swaps. The fusion can also explain a little bit more.
00:37:44.365 - 00:37:46.025, Speaker B: We'll definitely come back to this.
00:37:46.805 - 00:38:08.581, Speaker A: Just I have a lot of questions but first question before we go. First we come back to like why the wallet and why the card and launching the card. So I want to understand why. Yeah, I guess that's my first question. Because your users in the beginning were more defi retail users, but now you.
00:38:08.613 - 00:38:10.069, Speaker B: Have access to all the wallets.
00:38:10.117 - 00:38:21.605, Speaker A: So what have changed here? The distribution have changed. Is it more B2B2C? What have you seen changing in terms of how you distribute one inch as a product on the market?
00:38:22.185 - 00:38:51.905, Speaker B: Yeah, we have different products nowadays. The wallet we built, you know how first Porsche was built? No. Ferry Porsche, the son of the Ferdinand Porsche, the engineer. He was looking for a car and didn't find the what he was looking for. And he just started to build it by themself. And so they created the brand Porsche. So.
00:38:51.905 - 00:39:13.575, Speaker B: And everyone was wow looking. Oh, there's something new. This is actually what I want as well. It's the same in our case. We didn't find a proper wallet. We made the most piece of shit and other we didn't like as well and we thought okay. We had a friend who was iOS developer and we hired them into the labs and then we started to build a wallet.
00:39:13.575 - 00:39:36.103, Speaker B: Nowadays we have two teams working on this Android iOS team and they develop everything native highly secure. We do security analysis as well and we try to improve the user experience. For example, you can easily connect our wallet to ledger through Bluetooth. We had to reverse. So you signed from a ledger and.
00:39:36.159 - 00:39:38.383, Speaker A: You use the 1 inch interface for sure. Okay.
00:39:38.519 - 00:39:58.161, Speaker B: The wallet. Yeah, you can connect through wallet. Connect our wallet and then you use your ledger to sign your transaction through the wallet. It's really easy. You get all the portfolio information about your wallet and everything. So we try to improve the user experience. It's also one thing how we can onboard people.
00:39:58.161 - 00:40:12.445, Speaker B: Yeah, it's easier to work with people when you have such a product. You can educate. We have kind of stories. Let's explain how something works in the wallet and we need it by ourselves as well.
00:40:12.565 - 00:40:15.877, Speaker A: And it keeps the user in your ecosystem.
00:40:15.981 - 00:40:35.909, Speaker B: This is also the other thing. We own the user. Then if the user use such a product for us, this user is with us. And this I guess also uniswap Understood. That's why they launched on Own Wallet as well. And everyone else also launch own Web3 wallet, you know. But it's okay for us.
00:40:35.909 - 00:41:12.417, Speaker B: It's so good that like companies such a uniswap with a lot of people, a lot of money on board people as well. Especially in us because we are not operating in US. So we have Geo Block and because of this situation regularly the one is Geo Block the product is geo blocked in the US now it's blocked in us. Yeah. The thing is like it's not my decision and maybe if I would decide, I would also decide to block because it's not clear situation regarding that.
00:41:12.601 - 00:41:16.125, Speaker A: Are you going to be a broker or not or classify as such?
00:41:17.105 - 00:41:45.809, Speaker B: I guess the Wallet is working for transfers to see the balances. But something like swap what is run by the Foundation Foundation Cayman Islands. It's an independent board, independent company, nonprofit organization. They have also kind of fear. They don't know what can come from us. That's why they decided to Geo block. It's okay, it's not my business.
00:41:45.809 - 00:42:36.343, Speaker B: My business is labs building software as a service or it's technology to provide technology. We have our dev portal as well. Just also additional product that we launched last year for people to integrate 1 inch in their product for other startups and companies to integrate 1 inch APIs and also to onboard new developers from Web2 to build own unicorns on top of our APIs. Because we invested a lot of time to build aggregation APIs for the Pathfinder or Algorithm Portfolio API. So you can track your panel of your wallet or you see, you can see history of your wallet. All the things like balances of your wallet. These things we have built and we just start to share.
00:42:36.343 - 00:42:50.565, Speaker B: We are like also as AWS for Web3 here. Yeah. Back to the wallet. Maybe the wallet and the card. Yeah, yeah.
00:42:50.645 - 00:43:00.985, Speaker A: It's an end to end kind of experience where you know I can use the wallet, I can you know, spend my card or spend you know, my token and back in real life in the 1 inch ecosystem.
00:43:01.405 - 00:43:40.115, Speaker B: Yeah, wallet is a tool what I need personally, what my co founder needs and I guess a lot of other people also need. And for us in terms of strategy, it's tool to onboard people, to educate and onboard people. And we launched the 1 inch card together with banks. It's a product for banks together with us. Yeah, they have license for European Union and uk they will expand to us. Would be interesting if they really start in us then we can also cover US people for the wallet. And the card.
00:43:40.115 - 00:44:22.333, Speaker B: So the idea is how we came to it. We were in Australia, it was last year, end of class here. I guess it was first time for me. I spoke with a lot of people and actually interesting fact is that 70 percentages of Australian people they own crypto, but they own crypto on centralized exchange. And then I spoke with a lot of people and told them why are you holding on centralized exchanges? It makes more sense like to own the crypto, not to trust someone like ftx, gamble with the money or run away with this. And they told okay, that sounds really great. We have really backup process.
00:44:22.333 - 00:45:23.533, Speaker B: You can also backup your seed frost highly encrypted on your icloud or Google cloud. So if you lose your phone or you lose your seed frost, you can restore still restore with your password. So and they told like okay, if I hold crypto here, how I can buy. First question, how you can buy more crypto and is it how efficient is it how many percentage you charge? We work with Moonpay and other provider, we aggregate actually multiple providers for crypto on ramp. And then huge question was also how we can use the crypto what is the off run process? And I told okay, I thought we need solution. And we were speaking with different providers and came to banks who was already successful fully working with ledger. And we came to a product, the 1 inch card then together with MasterCard and yeah introduced it.
00:45:23.709 - 00:45:25.317, Speaker A: Do you have it in yourself today?
00:45:25.421 - 00:45:41.773, Speaker B: Yes, yes, the whole this year in Paris. I pay everything with my unicorn. Yeah, I tell I can show you how it looks like you can get it as well. Just it's easy process. You can just you download the 1 inch wallet. Just my unicorn transactions. Yes.
00:45:41.829 - 00:45:48.869, Speaker A: Yeah, I pay the cafe, you pay the Lulu Paris. So you went to the restaurant? Yes, yes, Pyramid Le Maurice. Yes. Yeah, I can.
00:45:49.037 - 00:46:25.183, Speaker B: Yeah, it's my. Here's my unicorn. So what pays? I can use Ethereum, I can use Bitcoin, I can use 1 inch. Like I have little staking, for example at 1 inch delegate to resolvers. It's also kind of utility function of our token. And I get paid from market makers who are filling the fusion auras and they pay a little bit to the delegators and I withdraw and spend for coffee. So it's like passive income.
00:46:25.183 - 00:46:31.967, Speaker B: Of course I need to pay taxes for this in Germany. But anyway it's cool, you know, I can easily pay with crypto.
00:46:31.991 - 00:46:39.783, Speaker A: I believe that Kyung is working maybe let's see on purchasing with banks so that you can.
00:46:39.839 - 00:46:40.607, Speaker B: Oh nice.
00:46:40.751 - 00:46:50.329, Speaker A: You can get rewards basically on all of your crypto. Is it Ethereum or is it Stablecoin or maybe Bitcoin? Because bitcoin's ticking. The future is coming.
00:46:50.377 - 00:47:13.185, Speaker B: So yeah, yeah. Also cashback, what we have is really nice. So you can get 1 percentages cashback in bitcoin USDT 1 inch, 2 percentages in banks token as well. We discover right now maybe to give three percentages cash back. So you pay two percentages as a fee with spend, you get more cash back. You get more cash back in truth. Yeah.
00:47:13.225 - 00:47:15.975, Speaker A: So you're getting paid by spending with UK back.
00:47:16.105 - 00:47:33.787, Speaker B: Yeah, you get paid actually and this is really nice. And so you increase your. You invest actually, you know anyway you need to pay everywhere. Right. So but if you get it as a bitcoin cashback, then you invest in Bitcoin theoretically. Right. It's really cool.
00:47:33.787 - 00:47:45.805, Speaker B: So it's easy now to off ramp and yeah, this was kind of the original idea. Okay. This demand and we launch it. Yeah. And it works very, very well. Yeah.
00:47:46.665 - 00:48:07.129, Speaker A: Coming back to the institutional market and Fusion. What is Fusion? Why did you launch it and is it also a response to. Do you think there will be KYC in defi? Defi has to be kyc. Like can you explain all of this approach?
00:48:07.217 - 00:48:44.335, Speaker B: Let's say yes. So last round we raised, we raised to build compliant institutional environment so the institutionals can actually interact with the defi liquidity. So in compliance manner. So we had different approaches but we came to something, what I call it digitalized NASDAQ approach. You have users who create intent. It's intent based protocol just for swaps. For now we have already since long time limit order protocol.
00:48:44.335 - 00:48:48.559, Speaker B: It's also intent based protocol. So we created it to 2021 I.
00:48:48.567 - 00:49:00.941, Speaker A: Guess and intent because it's more efficient to put it off chain and then to exit it on chain. Otherwise you will not have complex basically routing or actions that you can do everything on chain.
00:49:00.973 - 00:49:31.695, Speaker B: Right. It's intent. Intent in terms that user doesn't care how it's going to be executed. The user just want to get something. It's like everyone who use stock exchange they go select the stock and say I would like to buy it. And they get the price, they get the shit price because they have thousand one thousand intermediate media people companies in between who charge fees. And it's not transparent how the settlement is done and how much price impact we face.
00:49:31.695 - 00:50:10.535, Speaker B: You need to select maybe one venue where you get the stock. Like it's stupid. Right. It's highly not efficient in our Case user come and say okay, I have 10,000 Ethereum. We did a little bit battle testing at 1 inch lab. So we have our portfolio, it needs to be rebalanced or our CFO rebalanced the portfolio and we did kind of battle testing of fusion and we rebalanced 10,000 Ethereum to USDC as a battle test. Of course we bought it back a little when the price went down later.
00:50:10.535 - 00:50:49.207, Speaker B: It's also kind of strategy of managing portfolio. So and we monitored how it was working and we got actually better price than the market rate was. It works like user just declare what they want. Selling 10,000 Ethereum to USDC and how this is going to be executed. You don't care. There are professional market makers who are compliant. They pass KYB with the foundation right now and they are screened through the foundation.
00:50:49.207 - 00:51:10.245, Speaker B: But by our 1 inch labs technology we have multiple providers like TRM Labs. We have other providers who we aggregate. We have own compliance team who monitor market makers. If someone get dirty money they're going to be blocked. Yeah, instantly. Yeah. Because Our last provide APIs.
00:51:10.365 - 00:51:17.893, Speaker A: Kyt. No, your transaction if they had dirty coins, whatever.
00:51:17.989 - 00:51:36.445, Speaker B: Not block until it's cleared. Yeah. So we're completely blocked. Yeah. So we avoid malicious actors here on the execution side. And the settlement is decentralized. It's not like that centralized party like it's happening in Cowswap right now.
00:51:36.445 - 00:51:58.143, Speaker B: Still they want to make it more decentralized. But still you decentralized the solvers. Basically decentralized is in our case the settlement. So we have. It's like P2P trade. You have user who create order make a signature on the order. User want to exchange 10,000 Ethereum to USDC market maker.
00:51:58.143 - 00:52:37.943, Speaker B: See this order, this order is shared with all the market makers who has at least five percentages of unicorn power in one inch network. This was a little bit complicated. You need to stake one inch token to get unicorn power. When you stick for two years you get for one inch one unicorn power and it decreases in time every block until you extend it for two years again. And it's not linear, it's like a curve. So people intend to extend always for two years to get the most benefits. And people then select can delegate to the resolvers who can execute the transactions.
00:52:37.943 - 00:53:11.157, Speaker B: Yeah and resolvers pay to people who delegate from the profit little bit. It's around 10 percentages right now. So okay back. So market makers, they see this order, it's like probably like. It's like a permission order book only this by the community Selected market makers can execute, settle and settle and then they compete between each other. Who is the first who take the order and fill. They can also do partial fills.
00:53:11.157 - 00:53:20.221, Speaker B: They can maybe say okay, I'm okay to take 10 percentages of the order. That's what happened with 10,000 Ethereum when we did the rebel land because it's.
00:53:20.253 - 00:53:22.461, Speaker A: Very large so they will take a part of it.
00:53:22.573 - 00:53:51.943, Speaker B: So if you executed just in the market you got around 10 percentages price impact. So you get 10 percentages in the value less. Because like this limited liquidity on Ethereum. Our fusion works with Dutch auction approach. It's like intent. It's based on limit order protocol but with additional conditions. So we built price curve for the Dutch auction.
00:53:51.943 - 00:54:13.163, Speaker B: My people call it Kunzenyar grid based on my surname. I came with crazy idea to my people. We started with linear linear Dutch auction. We go from spot, we. We went from spot price to market price. Spot price. What you see on coin gecko coin, market cap and market price is when.
00:54:13.163 - 00:54:40.257, Speaker B: When you exchange the whole amount on. On in the. In the network. On Ethereum for example, 10,000 Ethereum to USDC on the market cost 10 percentages price impact. So you have here a chart, you start here spot price K market price, price impact, 10 percentages. We try to minimize to reduce the price impact. At the beginning we did it with linear detraction.
00:54:40.257 - 00:55:05.923, Speaker B: And then I had a conversation with one of my friends Tigran from Kinetics. They built cross chain solutions. Right now where you can just buy any bitcoin for any shit coin or sell bitcoin for any shit coin anywhere. Yeah, it's not bridging, it's atomic. Atomic. Atomic swap. So yeah, I'm an advisor and angel investor for his project.
00:55:05.923 - 00:55:51.905, Speaker B: I came like with the atomic swaps. I came to him really long time ago and they actually built really nice technology with zero knowledge pros. Anyway, he was pitching new like something, something new. What I didn't understood like over two hours he just worked with me and tried to pitch this idea. And after this two hour my brain gave me idea just not related to this stock exchange page. It was something different and it click And I had in front of my eyes this touch auction should not be linear. Just imagine it makes sense to when you Swap all the 10,000 Ethereum you have price impact.
00:55:51.905 - 00:56:43.067, Speaker B: But if you swap little bit you have small price impact because there's a lot of enough liquidity for small amounts. So we enabled partial fuels so we allow people to take part. And then if the order happens in 10 minutes. And after 10 minutes we try to exchange the full amount, all the 10,000 Ethereum for the price what we got from Pathfinder, the market rate. Then just think about the time. Like if we have 10 minutes, then after one minute we try to sell 1/10 of the amount and you get different price. So and with this logic we build price curve what goes like this and then the end drops down and it follows the current liquidity on the market in time.
00:56:43.067 - 00:56:49.465, Speaker B: It's kind of three dimensional thing from the feeling and it helps really a lot.
00:56:51.885 - 00:56:57.893, Speaker A: Who's sitting in the time period? Is it by default or can you use yourself?
00:56:57.949 - 00:57:40.095, Speaker B: You can do it by yourself. Right now it was kind of it's custom settings but it's highly advanced. So not everyone understand this. That's why I guess we are removing it right now. So you get it as suggested time. So normally like based on analytics, we have analytics team bigger amounts, 6 to 10 minutes, small amounts like up to 50k, maybe 100k in US dollars value, 2, 3 minutes most of the time. Right now also for the small amounts we execute directly, the market makers execute directly because we properly set the price based on the market conditions in the network.
00:57:40.095 - 00:58:15.489, Speaker B: So back shortly to the idea with the Kunzenyar grid with the curve adapted to the current liquidity and the prices. And in time we introduced something new. We introduced also taking into account gas execution cost changes with the first version was problematically also for small amounts. Sometimes price of the gas jumped up. Right. And we didn't have match with the market conditions. So the price wasn't in the market rate.
00:58:15.489 - 00:58:45.687, Speaker B: It was higher than market. No one executed. Yeah. So the user had to wait longer and sometimes they got a little bit less. Because the Dutch auction works every block and you have delay of 12 seconds. So the price drops in 12 seconds more than if it would have like every second drop. So we changed it, we introduced like this taking account of gas execution costs.
00:58:45.687 - 00:59:22.805, Speaker B: And now the graph looks like maybe zo goes up. So better rates for the user because gas dropped, gas cost dropped or it goes a little bit down, but still in the range of the maximum acceptable price impact. So user when you trade in defi, you have always maximum acceptable price impact. So how much do you. Are you okay to get less? But through this Dutch auction approach we try to reduce the risks to get less than expected. So it's highly complex thing. We from the labs also have patent on this.
00:59:22.805 - 00:59:26.925, Speaker B: So we apply it. So in spent.
00:59:27.045 - 00:59:37.525, Speaker A: That's what you were telling me before you spend time yourself. Through architects to build, to work with the engineers to basically make it.
00:59:37.645 - 01:00:11.817, Speaker B: Yes. I travel a lot, go to the conference, I speak with a lot of people, I collect all the information. And sometimes my brain, I think always about the problem we had. Always the problem with the gas costs. That gas costs, they change and they change in Ethereum and we add sometimes no execution because the price is not the market. Right. And then one day my brain comes with a solution, you know, makes like click the same Germany and I.
01:00:11.817 - 01:00:36.993, Speaker B: I see the solution for in front of me. It's just an idea. I give, I give it to my people or I do my own prototype to test this idea. Yeah. So yeah, right now I'm working a new algorithm for the Pathfinder. So it's like min cost max flow algorithm. It's not something new, but it's difficult to implement in this specific environment.
01:00:37.129 - 01:00:55.235, Speaker A: And you have to be physically with the engineers when you give the id or you can do it remote or it both works. Because you were telling me now you having offices also because of this, right? Because I guess having the engineers in front of you giving the id, it's sometimes faster.
01:00:55.395 - 01:01:20.455, Speaker B: It's faster, yeah. Right now we are still all remote. Office is almost done. We had some renovation and we will open soon. And it gives benefits like you have it here, right. You have shorter ways to speak with the engineers, to work with them closely. We do sometimes like we collect people in one place.
01:01:20.455 - 01:02:01.709, Speaker B: So when we release Fusion, we put people into one room in Dubai, in a hotel, for weeks, for one month. They came with family, with children. We paid hotel rooms, food, everything. So they worked like they were normally they had was less and not everyone could come. It was like six, I guess 50, 60 people. And they had lunch and dinner with the family, spend a little bit time. And also they worked like day over and also in the evening by themselves.
01:02:01.709 - 01:02:35.067, Speaker B: So we didn't require this, but it was like hackathon, you know, like hackathon means you give everything. And they spent one month, I guess, but we delivered. I came with Fusion already. We launched 2023. No, we launched 2022. In December 2022, we launched Fusion. I came with this idea early 2022 and I understood that it's not going forward, it's something new, you know, when.
01:02:35.067 - 01:02:55.495, Speaker B: When you build on something new. What? I didn't even understood everything. I had just the feeling this is the right way, it's bad. And yeah. And this Dutch auction, linear Dutch auction was just the first idea from Michael founder Anton that how to. How to ensure that the settlements is decentralized. Dutch auction.
01:02:55.495 - 01:03:19.545, Speaker B: Yeah, it's the best way. So. And then I recognize. Okay, it makes sense. I suggested then to our chief board that let's collect people in one place. Who wants to come, should come, who don't want to, it's okay. And a lot of people came and we worked closely together and really in the process we changed a lot.
01:03:19.545 - 01:03:38.241, Speaker B: How to show it, how to make the swap and everything. Smart contracts were already done. It was clear on smart contract level. It was clear what to do as a first version. And then we delivered. We delivered, everyone was happy, was really great time. We should be there.
01:03:38.393 - 01:03:48.441, Speaker A: Because you were together for a month and you knew you had to do it. You knew that at the end of the month you had to deliver something.
01:03:48.513 - 01:04:13.545, Speaker B: Yes, actually you can build everything in two weeks actually. Every complex problem you think, yeah, like isolated proper scope you can build in two weeks actually. And sometimes you can build also over two nights on weekends. It's also possible. Yeah, this hackathon style, you know, like we have always built production radio prototypes over tonight.
01:04:15.485 - 01:04:24.365, Speaker A: And if you put yourself in five, 10 years, where do you think one inch is going to be and what do you think defi is going to be?
01:04:24.745 - 01:04:58.925, Speaker B: I'm pretty sure our protocols are going to be used for stock trading 247 and with highly efficient settlement, we are going to change the traditional finance. We are already changing, you know, like we are already adapting and we are building from one inside. We are building on just the regulated for environment, for institutionals. And we will open for. Back to your question about kyc. We will open it for everyone. So we will introduce KYC for everyone.
01:04:58.925 - 01:05:33.327, Speaker B: You need compliance regulated environment. Yeah, right now this also like foundation who run the front end, what offer access to the 1 inch network. You can stake, you can delegate and you can also swap. And they don't charge any fees, they don't make any money with this. They also not earn any money with this. Because it's this. If you want to run it regulated, you want to make money business with this, you need kyc, you need proper licenses Vs 1 inch labs.
01:05:33.327 - 01:05:47.599, Speaker B: We got licenses in Switzerland for first non custodian exchange in Switzerland and also in UAE. We got water license recently for non custodian exchange in United Arab Emirates.
01:05:47.687 - 01:05:51.549, Speaker A: So you could technically take a feast, right? We could technically take a commission.
01:05:51.677 - 01:06:13.493, Speaker B: When, when, when you. Yeah, when we start own application one one like trading platform. So as labs. So yeah, we can, we. We can take fee like Uniswap takes fee that's why they have no problems. I guess it's the regulator because like Metamask as well, because they make business, they make money and which is fair.
01:06:13.549 - 01:06:17.265, Speaker A: At some points it's. It's fine, it's fair to take a fee.
01:06:17.675 - 01:06:45.239, Speaker B: Yeah, but you need to follow the regulations. Of course, regulation, like it's not fully clear, but this kind of business is from point of view needs clear path, clear regulation. And we just. We tried with the regulator to speak about. We presented with. We explained that settlement is on chain. We have a clean environment, we have compliance, we have already compliance.
01:06:45.239 - 01:07:15.384, Speaker B: We do it as a service for foundation, but if you run on application then we do it completely by ourself and we can charge fees, but we don't have to. There are different other ways we can earn. Right now as a labs, we are I would say almost sustainable. We burn a little bit. We earn from software as a service portal. So we sell a lot of APIs. We are launching new APIs as well as Web3 APIs.
01:07:15.384 - 01:07:35.575, Speaker B: We go into the market of a Web3 provider, we can do it better than others with better quality, high ability. And we need it anyway for ourself. And all the APIs we just sell and get good amount of money for this to be to exist the next 80 years.
01:07:36.435 - 01:07:44.629, Speaker A: So the read part, the data part, right? When you can create API and you can get information, derive information and people can use it in their.
01:07:44.787 - 01:07:55.361, Speaker B: Yeah, all the wallets they need APIs. You know, someone. Someone is doing it by themselves. For example, what. What are. What kind of balance is. Are in the wallet, what tokens are in the wallet.
01:07:55.361 - 01:08:39.267, Speaker B: This information we have, we give this information in 200 milliseconds, 300 milliseconds and most of the time we spent for network latency. So we are very good in backend technology. Myself is also kind of like. I have also background microservices and so on. I built my API for telecommunication services like sending SMS around the globe, batch processing. And I was working also in consulting companies where we did a lot of batch processing. And we invented also new approach how to have highly stable and flexible environment by using specific pattern.
01:08:39.267 - 01:09:11.776, Speaker B: What somehow no one is using it. So I came to this idea as well, like why no one is doing this. I came to a nice architecture what actually could help us also to decentralize APIs. Also we have a team Boostie Labs, you know, maybe them. They are also here in France, here in Paris. They help us right now with a white paper. I came to them with the idea for P2P Network what is incentivized.
01:09:11.776 - 01:09:43.061, Speaker B: So on top of this you can build a lot of products. So it's actually kind of decentralized API network. So you have a set of commands you can connect to the network from just a web browser or mobile phone. It's easily. It works like a thin client. And then you can say okay, I need balance of my wallet. You send a request, you pay for this request through payment channels.
01:09:43.061 - 01:10:07.385, Speaker B: Back to this experience of the payment channels. Payment channel is the next thing from upon view for the next years. And it's also something very very nice for traditional world. For Netflix for example. Netflix deal a lot with payments. They spend a lot of money. They have a lot of different companies who handle the payments, subscriptions and so on.
01:10:07.385 - 01:10:20.995, Speaker B: But it can be solved easily through crypto by having all one complexity. That means you can have unlimited subscribers to your service and payers who stream to you every block.
01:10:21.115 - 01:10:27.603, Speaker A: And yeah, you have L2s, you have stablecoin, you have non cashier wallets and you can fix the problem.
01:10:27.779 - 01:11:14.871, Speaker B: Yes, it's going to be much more kind of efficient. Already in dev portal our customers are paying crypto. So we don't have yet payment channels out there, but we are working also on payment channels protocol. We advise with Anton also Popaya network for example, they also do payment channels based on the idea of Anton payment channel approach. I advise them as well a little bit also kind of next topic in Defi from open. So in this P2P network offers like possibility to just easily get information what you need without having centralized entity at centralized APIs. You know like you don't need to go to infuriate to make a Web3 call.
01:11:14.871 - 01:11:50.777, Speaker B: You can just send into the network and sign that you are okay to pay up to this amount of money. It can be micro payments really 0.001 US dollar. Yeah. And specific executors who are special who run the nodes and have modules. Someone maybe run just with 3 node. Someone just answer what are the balances? Or someone do the full set of our APIs what we offer right now centralized and you get it.
01:11:50.777 - 01:12:06.895, Speaker B: And potentially we are still experimenting. Potentially we can provide proofs. If you ask for storage in the Ethereum node in specific block or on current block, then you can get a proof of the storage that it was really from the main.
01:12:07.395 - 01:12:08.907, Speaker A: And you can have a node that.
01:12:08.931 - 01:12:52.263, Speaker B: Is closer to you because that's network and you can reduce latency in that sense. Yes. This is kind of the vision of mine to make everything more decentralized. For example, Dapps are right now centralized, stored on AWS and GitHub pages and so on. And they can be stored in decentralized network like 1 inch P2P network where someone pays for getting DDAPP US user. If you're opening a DAPP, maybe you don't pay, but maybe DAO pays for it, you know, in decentralized manner. DAO need to deposit in a smart contract, just a balance.
01:12:52.263 - 01:13:23.237, Speaker B: And someone who use specific domain like in this network, kind of like ENS domains. For example, maybe our own implementation of something like this. Did you see the TV series the startup Silicon Valley, right? No, in Silicon Valley, just the startup. It's on Amazon Prime. Take a look. It's. It's really nice one.
01:13:23.237 - 01:13:57.453, Speaker B: And they built also a network. They use it for bad actors like. For like a dark market or something. Of course in our case everything should be highly compliant. Our executors should be also selected by the community with the delegation and KYB that this operators operate from. Not sanctioned environment are not criminals and so on and so on. And also those people who make the requests for oh give me the balance of the wallet or give me the dapp, they should be also kind of screened.
01:13:57.453 - 01:14:59.225, Speaker B: You know, if there's a KYT in KYC maybe in the future or for this case you don't need theoretically kyc. You can work with the IP addresses and you can also work with the detection of VPNs. So what we do right now as well for the foundation to block countries from using the app decent block also for vpn. So it's like face detection for vpn. If the VPN provider don't provide the original country and there are some VPN provider could provide meta information that the original country is maybe France and this person is just using VPN because of privacy, you know, if you don't have such information, go block just to stay clean and have no issues in the future. Yeah, something like this can be also implemented inside of the network. So they are kind of a relayer network who like executors are private.
01:14:59.225 - 01:15:17.359, Speaker B: The app user also private. They connect to Relayer network and Relayer network don't publish the IP address of these people. But they need to take care that these are clean IP addresses. Not North Korean people.
01:15:17.447 - 01:15:19.879, Speaker A: Yeah, North Korea. Kim Jong.
01:15:19.967 - 01:15:42.113, Speaker B: So of course we need kind of compliance layer in this case so we can avoid usage called dark like Darknet or some shit. But it introduce a way for high available services. You're not reliable on One IP address or one domain.
01:15:42.209 - 01:15:47.105, Speaker A: It's decentralized. It's more efficient because you talk to a node that is close to you.
01:15:47.185 - 01:16:05.125, Speaker B: If you get files. If you get files, you get small pieces from everywhere, like where it's next near to you. You can use multiple band files if one node have only one gigabit, but you can download with 10 gigabit and you ask them only for part of the files.
01:16:06.205 - 01:16:17.305, Speaker A: Abe, you said it earlier, you want to make everything more decentralized. Do you think the future, 5, 10, 15 years is going to be more decentralized?
01:16:18.645 - 01:17:01.935, Speaker B: I hope so. I'm working hard on this in collaboration with for example Busty Labs and also other engineers and everyone please welcome to join. We have in trend program you can ask if you want to work on something like this. You can just ask for like one year budget. We have one guy, for example, recently they got one year budget to work on a community front end community components. And she doesn't need to work on a kind of main job somewhere and she just concentrate completely on one each. It's really nice that someone from the community came to ask for money and just work, deliver, communicate with us as well as 1 inch labs.
01:17:01.935 - 01:17:29.935, Speaker B: I hope so. So please welcome to join us. We are looking for talented, motivated people who would love also to research. Theoretically it's possible. So we have now Elon Musk with the global network he is opening for us. I guess that you can just use your phone in the satellites what they have directly without this environment. The.
01:17:32.035 - 01:17:34.499, Speaker A: Radium on local telecoms.
01:17:34.587 - 01:18:10.803, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, you don't need to use them. You use this just a satellite with your phone. It works. It works Really? I guess 4G, not 5G yet, but maybe 5G soon. And I guess it will be globally in not sanctioned countries, I guess. And then you have everywhere access to Internet, right? We have now as well. And I guess this could be really a way to avoid also big companies like Google to just take over or Apple completely take over infrastructure as well.
01:18:10.803 - 01:18:11.755, Speaker B: Do you think that could happen?
01:18:11.795 - 01:18:20.505, Speaker A: Do you think these commercial platforms could be takeover about Web3 or decentralization in the future?
01:18:22.885 - 01:19:07.487, Speaker B: It's difficult kind of to have a lot of money. They have the best engineers. But if you can achieve and build a new application, like a new platform, what is more efficient than everything else, then it will win for sure. From open view it makes sense to have applications what communicates not with single APIs, single servers, single entry points, but have an environment what optimize on the fly. Like if you are like in somewhere in Asia, Indonesia or Bali or something. Then theoretically you don't have to call servers in us, right. And go through all the cabots.
01:19:07.487 - 01:19:41.403, Speaker B: Right. You can, maybe there are some providers on Bali and you going to be rooted directly to them. Or you are doing live streams and people are here for example in Paris watching. Then they don't need to go through central service. They can directly go maybe to retransmitter or directly to you. This kind of brilliant sci fi future, I would say maybe.
01:19:41.459 - 01:19:45.615, Speaker A: Very last question. What are you excited about?
01:19:47.075 - 01:20:28.875, Speaker B: I'm excited about to build on something what is used by a lot of people. I like this interview from Pavel Durov. Yes. He said the one he did after eight years, basically he said he doesn't own any real estate or something because. Because he didn't want to deal with something what only few people will have touch point for this. His family would see maybe the penthouse where he's living what he made nice. He liked to concentrate on something what is used by a lot of people, by billions of people.
01:20:28.875 - 01:20:55.663, Speaker B: And I like this here as well. That's why we work for free with Anton very long time in the beginning. Because it's really nice feeling when people use what you have built and give you also credence in terms like they use it. I'm really excited to build something what people like and use then.
01:20:55.759 - 01:20:58.519, Speaker A: Sergey, thank you so much for coming in Paris.
01:20:58.607 - 01:21:00.539, Speaker B: I hope we will do this again.
01:21:00.727 - 01:21:02.771, Speaker A: The next time you come or maybe.
01:21:02.803 - 01:21:04.135, Speaker B: In Dubai, I don't know.
01:21:04.515 - 01:21:05.955, Speaker A: But yeah, it was a pleasure to have you.
01:21:05.995 - 01:21:07.995, Speaker B: Yeah. What's a pleasure? Thank you very much.
