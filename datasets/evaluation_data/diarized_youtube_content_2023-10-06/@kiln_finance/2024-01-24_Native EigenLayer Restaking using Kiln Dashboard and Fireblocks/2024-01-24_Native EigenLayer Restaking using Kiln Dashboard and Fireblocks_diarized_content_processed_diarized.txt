00:00:06.090 - 00:00:52.430, Speaker A: Hi everyone. In this video I'm going to go through how to natively restake eth using the kiln dashboard. So here I'm on the stake eth page on the kiln dashboard. I'm first going to connect a wallet. I'm going to choose a fireblocks vote vault to connect to here. Of course, this is the same flow as usual, so you can connect with other custody solutions either via wallet connect or via the metamask interface. So once I'm connected here, I choose an account that I want to stake towards and the amount that I want to stake.
00:00:52.430 - 00:01:38.102, Speaker A: Notice the Eigen layer restaking option which I've activated. And here I'm going to choose to stake 32 e. So one validator. So the first thing that happens is that an Eigen pod is created. So this is a smart contract that is going to hold the claim to your validator's collateral. And this is a concept in Eigen layer. So in order to do this, you will need to first whitelist this contract, which is the Eigen layer eigenpod manager.
00:01:38.102 - 00:02:27.910, Speaker A: You need to whitelist this in your fireblocks instance. So here you can see I've approved the transaction to create the Eigenpod and it's now being created on chain. The next step is a standard Eve validator deposit where you can see that the Kyon API here is preparing a validator. And now a transaction is being proposed for a deposit of 32 e to the new validator. And the withdrawal credentials of this validator are set to the Eigen pod that we have just deployed in the previous step. So here I'm signing this deposit transaction. Of course, based on your transaction authorization policy, you might have multiple people who need to approve.
00:02:27.910 - 00:02:44.780, Speaker A: And now that the transaction is signed, it's now being processed on chain. And here we go. We've successfully restaked one validator with Eigen layer. Thanks a lot for watching.
