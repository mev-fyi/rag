00:00:06.442 - 00:00:07.610, Speaker D: My name is Darren Kamas.
00:00:07.690 - 00:00:08.666, Speaker A: I'm Hakim.

00:00:47.612 - 00:01:00.650, Speaker D: Bond portfolio has an inverse relationship interest rates. Right? So as the central banks hike the rates up, the bond portfolio drops, they have this massive hole. And it turns out, actually, a lot of the US banks weren't sufficiently hedged.
00:01:00.810 - 00:01:06.826, Speaker C: We're happy to announce to the public for the first time that we are launching protocol staking, which is Apibara's.
