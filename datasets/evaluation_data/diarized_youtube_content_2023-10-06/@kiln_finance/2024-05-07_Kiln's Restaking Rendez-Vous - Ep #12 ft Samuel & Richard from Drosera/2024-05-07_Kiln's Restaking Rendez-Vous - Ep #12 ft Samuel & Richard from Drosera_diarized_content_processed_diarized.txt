00:00:07.280 - 00:00:24.554, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to a new episode of the Kiln restaking rendezvous. I'm Edgar, protocol specialist at Kiln. And today we have Boba and Richard from Chocera. I'm also joined by great co host Loric, our product manager on Ethereum.
00:00:25.134 - 00:00:25.566, Speaker B: And.
00:00:25.630 - 00:00:27.524, Speaker A: Yeah. How are you guys doing today?
00:00:27.984 - 00:00:28.592, Speaker B: Doing great.
00:00:28.648 - 00:00:28.952, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:00:29.008 - 00:00:30.204, Speaker B: Doing good for us.
00:00:30.664 - 00:00:32.324, Speaker C: Yeah. Thank you for having us.
00:00:33.144 - 00:00:49.324, Speaker A: Perfect. Yeah, definitely. So bye bye, Richard. I let you guys introduce yourself, kind of give us your background and how you basically like, the story of how you ended up working in crypto and blockchain.
00:00:50.864 - 00:01:30.614, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I can go. Yes. I'm Boba, CTO at Drosera. Yeah, my kind of background came from computer engineering. I actually, before I worked in crypto, I really started to even learn about it. I worked at BAE, worked on basically military weapons, GPS, and a lot of that was obviously closed source technology. Started to learn more about crypto and how it was open source, and everybody's working together on all of this tech.
00:01:30.614 - 00:02:18.224, Speaker B: And I got really interested in wanting to be part of that community. Started to learn how to do arbitrage, make arbitrage bots, like flash loan bots, and doing kind of monitoring in general for the EVM and then Polkadot and then Cosmos. And so I set up a bunch of these monitoring systems to just detect all sorts of different kinds of events, and then saw there was kind of like a need for seeing exploits occur or seeing risks or just other issues in the space occurring. So I kind of got interested in this idea of making system where we could have nodes protecting your protocol by looking for all these different kinds of events.
00:02:19.924 - 00:02:38.220, Speaker C: Yeah. What's up, guys? I'm Richard. I'm the co founder and CSO here at Josera. In terms of my origin story in the space. First learned about bitcoin in 2012. Didn't really think much about it. It was $6 per BTC, and thought it was a huge ripoff.
00:02:38.220 - 00:03:19.550, Speaker C: So kind of wrote it off for a long period of time. I kind of have, like, a background in more traditional finance, so, you know, couldn't really think about ways of actually valuing this thing based off of any cash flows. So basically just wrote it off for multiple years. Ended up going to a entrepreneur program in Silicon Valley called Draper University, started by a famous venture capitalist called Tim Draper. He's pretty famous for buying bitcoin from the US Marshals service that was confiscated, um, from. From the Silk Road founder, essentially. So he became a big bitcoin holder and obviously taught the class about bitcoin, um, and at that point I was still not really a believer in bitcoin, but thought blockchain technology was cool.
00:03:19.550 - 00:03:39.100, Speaker C: Uh, met a friend there that was actually building something, uh, that was never really going to be on Ethereum. This was very early days of Ethereum. I think it was like eight or $9, uh, per eth. And he basically said, oh no, it's a little too expensive. You should wait for it to go down to $6. Uh, that was obviously like a bad, bad mistake. I missed that one.
00:03:39.100 - 00:04:18.540, Speaker C: But nonetheless, I evangelized Ethereum, thought it was really cool, like you can actually build stuff on blockchains using Ethereum. So I thought it was really cool. But then joined the industry full time after a backpacking trip in India. Actually, like didn't have a career or anything, was just six months, like having a great time on the opposite side of the planet. And when I got back to New York, met some people, went to a couple of meta meetups, got really interested in the technology, and I just decided that this Ethereum thing is really cool and wanted to dedicate my career towards it. So I've been a vc in the space. I was at a group called Advanced Blockchain, which is a german publicly traded venture builder and venture investor, where I led the investments team.
00:04:18.540 - 00:05:02.358, Speaker C: I was there for a little over a year and then ended up actually going to oval Labs. Oval Labs is the leader in distributed validator technology. That's how I really got into the ethereum proof of stake space and I really started to get fascinated with the whole node operator business model. So, like really, as Boba says, I kind of came and offered the operator availability layer for Josera because I built relationships with a lot of node operators while I was at Oval. So, yeah, I mean, my experience at Oval's translated very well over to Josera, and I am a little bit of a later joiner to the founding team. As Boba said before the beginning, it hasn't even been really a year of Josera that I joined four months ago. And yeah, it's been quite the wild ride so far.
00:05:02.358 - 00:05:05.834, Speaker C: So, yeah, that's a bit about myself and how I ended up at chosera.
00:05:07.974 - 00:06:03.084, Speaker D: You guys have really OG backgrounds in the space. It's very cool to see like MeV DVT, like coming from different parts of the space, but also like, and I think this could be a good maybe introduction to Serra about security. So, like we've seen, I mean, there are a lot of statistics, but I think the most impressive one is in 2022, like more than 80% of DeFi protocols were acts. So it means that at least in 2022, the space is kind of missing something in security. You mentioned that you have background also outside of crypto. What do you think in general is missing in the web3, space in terms of security and how can we just generally improve there before talking about like specifically about Dresser and what you bring to the space?
00:06:05.144 - 00:06:07.312, Speaker C: Yeah, Boba, you want to take a stab at it?
00:06:07.408 - 00:07:31.120, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I would say that there's a lot missing from security in general in the space. And like, obviously everybody has been working pretty diligently to increase our security standards in the space, but I think that that is just going to be always the case because that's how security is. Security is always like a iterative process of adding more security, especially as new innovations get built. Like we need to continue to add more security and we need to think about this concept of layered security. And that's something that is existed in the web two realm, cybersecurity, just in general, is that there is no one solution that protects you from everything, because that's just not how security works. A layered approach of using multiple different tools and technologies to kind of increase your security barrier is the best way to stay up to date because exploits and hackers, they're kind of never ending and they're always going to find a new strategy, a new meta, and a new way to break existing systems.
00:07:31.120 - 00:08:04.444, Speaker B: We have to be really dynamic, we have to be really flexible with being able to add security on the fly. Like add new security practices quickly and elegantly. And so that's kind of what we're trying to do at Tercera, is being able to allow people to add these security barriers to their protocols on the fly very quickly without having to do like a two month integration process. They could do like a one day integration process.
00:08:05.204 - 00:08:36.469, Speaker C: Yeah. And I think just to add on to that, right. The question being like, what is missing currently in the web3 security space? To be honest, it's just missing web3 security. Right. Like the reality is that web3 security as a concept is like a misnomer. The products that are currently on the market today, again, like they do serve their purpose, as Boba was alluding to, right, taking this layered security approach. But the reality is, is that they're really more b two b companies that are like offering a software package for decentralized protocols.
00:08:36.469 - 00:09:20.168, Speaker C: So really it's a SaaS b two b, play Web 0.25 if we're being generous, to be completely honest. So I think having a security product that is aligned with the ethos of Ethereum, but also just of the entire industry as a whole. Right. Like decentralized security offerings are an absolutely critical layer of the security fabric that will be ultimately, like, in combination, the thing that really does keep web3 safe for all of its users, while also aligning with the ethos of decentralization, which is so critical to the entire industry. So decentralized security really isn't a thing. There are some quasi examples of decentralized security, but when I say webpoint, Web 2.5
00:09:20.168 - 00:09:55.604, Speaker C: security for web3, there's a lot of manual integration work and these protocols have to actually relinquish some sort of protocol sovereignty, give permissions to a third party in order to actually deliver the promise of security. And we're here to essentially say, hey, there's actually a different way to do it. You don't need to give permissions. We can all remain aligned with the ethos and make a protocol as essentialized as possible for the benefit of its users. So basically it's security without compromise. We don't need to compromise on our morals and ethics and values that we find to be very near and dear to our hearts here as crypto builders.
00:09:57.044 - 00:10:10.744, Speaker A: Great. And just taking a step back, what is the origin story behind Rossa? Like, when did you, when did you guys basically meet and decided to work on this product?
00:10:11.684 - 00:11:29.078, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I think Tricera has had many origin stories. I think it's evolved over time and it's like taken many different forms and it's coming to a point where it's really taken all of us, the team, to basically create what it is now. But I think the seed of where it started was basically building out these kind of monolithic monitoring systems in house and seeing all of the issues with making those monitoring systems in house and the whole process. Building one of those systems in house is not necessarily the hard part. Managing it is actually the most difficult piece, because now anytime you want to add an update or the protocol changes or there's some new feature you want to add, it's a huge, huge process. And you actually have to have developers that are full time spending their time managing and developing this monitoring system.
00:11:29.078 - 00:12:22.564, Speaker B: And at the end of the day, it is a Web 2.5 solution that you're making. You're just creating this centralized monitoring system that's made by you, perhaps the protocol developers, but it doesn't really align with the whole point of web3, which is there's tons of compute out there and there's all these operators and we can leverage them and incentivize them to run these monitoring systems for us so that we don't need to spend time doing that. We can focus on building the protocol. So I think that is kind of where it was born from. And just this idea that we can have decentralized detection and response just by leveraging the systems that are already in this ecosystem.
00:12:22.944 - 00:13:13.598, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think just like to add a little bit of color. Even though I was a later joiner to the founding team when I first connected with the CEO, he basically told me about this idea that you can connect node operators with extra computer to provide not just consensus layer security, which is what node operators typically perform whenever they're running validators for Ethereum consensus, but actually taking that same primitive and bringing it to the application layer and allowing them to make more money by doing more things with their discretionary machine space. I thought that was absolutely brilliant. And I was like, yeah, I mean I'm still doing things at Oval, but like, you know, I want to invest in this. It sounds like an amazing idea. After speaking to node operators, I kind of know some of the difficulties around the business model. People can call, you know, highly commoditized business offering.
00:13:13.598 - 00:13:25.914, Speaker C: So if you open up new avenues for them to make additional capital while providing a new type of security, this sounds like a brilliant idea. So that's what initially got me really excited about joining the project.
00:13:27.334 - 00:14:02.042, Speaker D: Very cool. And talking about kind of decentralized that you mentioned like decentralization of this kind of incident detection stack. What would you say, like how do you approach today? Like five protocols for example, like what do you tell them exactly on why these kind of solutions are better for them? Or maybe like more line, but also like just in terms of performance, reliability, like why is it better for them to use that than their current setup, which as you mentioned is pretty lack web two, usually just on course setup and in house alerts in stack.
00:14:02.178 - 00:16:02.502, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I mean there's tons of answers here, but I mean one of the main ones I think is like the fact that we are making Tercera to be this very EVM native platform where you create your security infrastructure with solidity code. I think that that is a major upgrade because what this allows for is for developers to actually create this infra inside of the same exact stack that they're building their protocol with. They're building their protocol with some more contract code. Why not make your security infrastructure with more contract code? It's like all the data already lives and if it's facilitated through solidity, through smart contract code, all you have to do is be able to grab it and do analysis on it in order to detect certain kinds of events, making it so that it is a natural experience, making it easy for developers to create infrastructure without having to set up a node JS project and typescript and all these other dependencies and then host it somewhere. Instead you just say, hey, make this less than 100 line smart contract and then deploy it to the drosera network and you've got some type of coverage, whether it's protecting you against oracle risk, or depegging risk or bridge risk, or all the other exploits that can happen in this space, or just protecting you against, um, you know, exploits where like, you know, your, your treasury, if it drops by 50% in a single block, you might want to detect that and you might want to take some type of action. Uh, and doing so with like less than 100 lines of solidity, it's like a no brainer. It makes it super easy to test.
00:16:02.502 - 00:16:44.574, Speaker B: And that's really what Drosera is allowing. And with a lot of these other security projects, that is the biggest issue is like, sure, you can get the security, but how do you experiment with it? How do you play with it? How do you see what's possible? And I think right now that's only really, you can only really see that through their front ends where you kind of get a toggle button or you get something that was given to you on the front end. Instead we just say, hey, just use the same language you use to develop your protocol. You know your protocol best and you can interact with it like directly, just with this. Yeah.
00:16:47.394 - 00:17:22.874, Speaker D: And so you mentioned this test that you're writing solid circle traps, right? Like, what exactly do you expect developer to put in there? Like, is it more like monitoring some invariants of the protocols, monitoring like some metrics over a period of time, and also like, what is kind of the reaction that's happening once the trap is triggered? Is it like, do you expect like a transaction to pose a protocol transaction, to withdraw phones with admin credentials or things like that?
00:17:23.294 - 00:18:19.218, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that is like, the beauty of making it solidity native is that whatever you can really dream up, whatever you can do with the data that's available on chain, you can use. You can use any of the data on chain naturally, just by referencing the contract address and using a protocols interface to query whatever data you want to query and make whatever inferences you want to make. And you can just do it programmatically. I think that that is what makes this really powerful, is that we're not saying to people, you have to do it this way and you have to look for this and you have to look for that. We just say, hey, we're giving you the toolbox for how you can do monitoring of any kind. And then all that comes out of that monitoring is whether an incident has been seen or it hasn't.
00:18:19.218 - 00:19:18.644, Speaker B: If it has been seen, you specify an emergency action, which is just like a solidity or a smart contract function. You just specify that to be triggered by the network of operators if an incident is seen. And the additional beauty to that is that it can be any function that you want. It could be a pause function that has an access list, so that this trap can only be the one that causes a pause function. It could be a multisig where Drosera acts as an additional signer to your multisig. It could be transferring funds, it could be freezing a particular part of your functionality. Let's say if you're using multiple bridges and one bridge goes down, you could have a reaction where that part of the functionality is frozen so that your users aren't inadvertently transferring funds into a black hole.
00:19:18.644 - 00:19:56.294, Speaker B: And so yeah, it's really kind of, it gives this ability back to the developers of like, you have a new ability, you have like a new superpower that is unlocked to you to be able to detect whatever you can think about or whatever is available. So if new protocols get developed and those are put on chain, that's like a new ability for you to use in your trap. There's more data that lives on chain. The more data that lives on chain, the more sophisticated a trap can potentially be. Yeah.
00:19:58.954 - 00:20:15.186, Speaker D: Cool. And for the tribes, do you expect some collaboration around them? Or is it like more simple, private, developed by each protocol on its own? How do you view the development and maybe contribution and composition of the shops?
00:20:15.330 - 00:21:24.074, Speaker B: Yeah, I expect for this to be a very collaborative process, mostly in the sense that people can come together and say, look at this library I made. That helps for you to grab very specific data from the top ten dexs on ethereum. And it does like a certain analysis for you, or some type of aggregator library that allows you to do some type of aggregated analysis on your trap. So I imagine people can kind of come together and use smart contract code as a way to create more libraries, create more examples of how do you do something. And that should really allow for there to be like a community that can flourish around security, whereas that really wasn't possible before. And yeah. As for, would this be private? Would these traps be private? I think the idea, ideally you would want your trap to be private so that kind of your security conditions are only known to you.
00:21:24.074 - 00:21:35.314, Speaker B: But that doesn't mean that you can't still collaborate with people of like, how do you grab this type of data? And what's the best way to do this in an efficient manner? Yeah.
00:21:38.734 - 00:22:16.600, Speaker D: Yeah, very cool. And yeah, definitely interesting. Like this kind of application layer, as you mentioned in the, at some blockchain are just, everyone can compose on top of each other. That's pretty. What kind of, like, do you think you will target, like some specific incidents happening on chain? Or like, do you really view yourself as kind of a dynamic security layer where just developer can do whatever they want? You mentioned, for example, on your website, you give the example of Euler. Is there like. So that's a good example, of course.
00:22:16.600 - 00:22:21.324, Speaker D: But is there other type of events that could be catched with shops?
00:22:21.904 - 00:23:44.974, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that there's like a whole host of examples that we could, we can show, and we've been kind of working through some of these examples of trying to create a trap and making it public of, here's how you could have a trap that protects against the prisma exploit that just happened or a trap that helps against all sorts of other issues. TWAP was one that we recently had the developer work on. I think that we want to make it so that anybody can kind of create traps for anything. But there are a couple categories for traps of maybe what's the best way to look for an incident related to a lending protocol, like bad debt. That might be something that you could have a particular library for, or a known way for getting this data, or even bridges. What's the best way to detect if there's something suspicious happening on a bridge? Like if its liquidity drops by 50% in a block? That might be a very simple example, but it could potentially protect millions of dollars with maybe ten lines of code. I think that we want to keep it agnostic because we don't know what people are going to use traps for.
00:23:44.974 - 00:24:02.234, Speaker B: Because every protocol is different. Right. And some have some similarities. Right. A Dex may care about its treasury lending protocols, care about bad debt, insurance protocols, might care about other, other factors. Right? Yeah.
00:24:03.734 - 00:24:42.894, Speaker A: And I'm curious, is there like a risk, could there be risk that are linked to the type of swaps that you set? Like, let's say, like there's a, like, you trigger a trap and the effect that it has on your protocol is that it freezes some assets or it completely, like, locks a position. Maybe you could. We could say that it would trigger, like, some liquidation event, for example, on that protocol or on another protocol. Do you see, like, also, do you think, like, you have a role as kind of, you have a counseling role to make sure that these events do not happen?
00:24:43.274 - 00:25:48.014, Speaker B: Yeah, I think that talking about what actions you can take that will have, like, a positive impact on the protocol is something that we want to be a part of those discussions. And, like, saying, oh, you know, you could do this, but it may have this effect, and you can do this, but it may have this effect. And it's certainly true that taking some action could have, like, an additional risk. But at the same time, I think it's also just important for us to understand this kind of new concept of what does it mean to have a protocol that kind of has tentacles, right? It reacts to events, it can do things to protect itself. I don't really think that that's a thing. Currently, most of the time that a protocol is taking action, it's through a multisig, and it's kind of like an action that is reacting two or 3 hours later after an event has occurred. What we're talking about now is an action taking place, potentially a block after an event has occurred.
00:25:48.014 - 00:26:39.362, Speaker B: This may allow for new, dynamic ways of handling risks, handling exploits. Perhaps it could make a situation where some asset gets liquidated or some physician gets liquidated, but there's nothing stopping you from having a trap that does more than just freezing something. It could freeze something, but then do something else and then do another action, and then do another action. So it's this idea of really automating your security. And I think that if we can do that, we can start getting away from this idea of developers waking up at 03:00 a.m. and running around with their heads cut off. We can actually have solid automation put in place.
00:26:39.362 - 00:26:54.744, Speaker B: So when developers do wake up at three because an exploit happened, they can be like, oh my gosh, we're protected. I'm so glad that we had this thing in place. Now I can figure out why the exploit happened instead of trying to focus on, we need to make sure the exploit can't happen again. Right?
00:26:56.764 - 00:27:14.024, Speaker A: Yeah, really cool and kind of zooming out. So you explained really well what the Josera protocol was. Can you tell us a bit, like, when did you hear about Eigenaire and when you decided that Josera should be an AV's on top of Eigenaire?
00:27:15.684 - 00:28:27.164, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that we were aware of Eigen Lear before. I think we had really kind of started to create this idea of tricera. And I think as we learned more and more, because I think all of us in this space have learned more and more about restaking and what is actually happening in this ecosystem and what are all the things to think about. I mean, the biggest thing that caught our eye was just this idea of crypto economic security that you can have slashing. You can have protocol enforcement of the operators running the rules for a protocol. And I think that is what unlocks this idea of avss. Or just like, honestly, just networks in general for blockchains, where you can have networks taking some action by being held to some type of standard to make sure that there's stability and there's health for the protocol that they're protecting or as a dependency for.
00:28:27.164 - 00:29:21.894, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, we just kind of started to learn more about crypto economic security, and we were like, yeah, this is definitely something that is necessary in order for us to, like, continue to create more sophisticated systems, because crypto economic security is a fundamental piece of blockchains in general, whether you look at bitcoin, Ethereum, cosmos parachains on Polkadot, I mean, everything has some bond requirement where if some malicious action takes place, then people get slashed. And so I think the kind of realization is that we can start making dapps that do this, or, like, coprocessors on top of layer ones and L2s that do this as well. And, yeah, Eigen layer acts as a really great marketplace for facilitating that crypto economic security.
00:29:24.194 - 00:29:38.164, Speaker A: Great. And talking about this crypto economic security, one question that we like to ask to every AV's builder is, how much of that economic security do you need? Or will you need?
00:29:39.784 - 00:29:41.336, Speaker B: Yeah, go ahead, Richard.
00:29:41.480 - 00:30:17.534, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, happy to take that one. I think the reality is, guys, is that as ABS is working with Eigen layer, working with these different LRT protocols that we're actively building out the marketplace in real time. Right. You know, people want to try to quantify, like, exactly how much crypto economic security is required. Right. So that the cost of corruption makes it cost prohibitive to actually initiate some sort of malicious behavior. I think us, we're still a little bit nascent with respect to that set of analysis on, like, what that cost of corruption looks like versus the expected outcome of that corruption.
00:30:17.534 - 00:31:07.432, Speaker C: But I can tell you that we've done, done a couple of announcements with some LRT protocols, but we've been pretty specific not to give very granular figures. And the reason why is this, I think, that we don't. I think the answer will change over time based off of how much adoption our protocol experiences. In the very earliest days of us being an Abs, there's going to be a different set of considerations with respect to crypto economic security, then six months later and a year later, then five years later. Um, so I think we did, obviously, as we strike deals with different LRT protocols, we want to be kind of flexible with respect to the number, just because we don't really know what that figure looks like. Um, and the reality is, is right now, obviously, our priorities is shipping and, you know, getting. Getting to mainnet.
00:31:07.432 - 00:31:55.424, Speaker C: Um, so I think, uh, you know, I would be kind of fibbing if I told you a very specific number that's required. I guess the easy way would be to say, oh, yeah, the more security, the better. But obviously, you don't want to be overpaying for, like, way too much security. Um, so I think the thing that's more interesting for us that we discuss internally is actually the diversification of where we get our security from, where we get our youth delegation from. Uh, we don't think it's smart to only work with one LRT provider because not one, like, one LRT is not the same as another LRT. So working with quite a few and then thinking about maybe just, like, being conservative with respect to how much each delegation we get could be a better short term strategy for us. And then, of course, as we scale over time, the number, I would imagine, would grow dramatically.
00:31:55.424 - 00:32:04.612, Speaker C: Um, but, yeah, that's kind of how, like, we're thinking about it in this, like, ever growing marketplace with a lot of unanswered questions. But, bob, I don't know if you want to add any additional thoughts.
00:32:04.748 - 00:32:34.054, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I would say, yeah. I mean, um, it's kind of like, it wouldn't make sense for us to have, like, a couple billion of crypto economic security and have, like, a really small protocol that is using us pay for the. The interest for. For that. Right. It's like, they may be a protocol that only has, like, two mil and tvo. Right.
00:32:34.054 - 00:33:36.864, Speaker B: The amount of crypto economic security they need is. Well, it's like two mil or two and a half or four or whatever. It makes sense to actually optimize to have crypto economic security placed for particular dependencies for Drosera, because it's a security protocol. Let's say that there's ten or 20 other protocols that are using us, they all may have different security needs. They may have different levels of TVO that they need different levels of security for, and it wouldn't make sense for them to all pay some flat fee. That would be too little for really large protocols and way too much for really little protocols. So I think that we'll see as we start to get more people using the technology, getting to testnet Mainnet, and seeing how we can make that efficient and optimized for everyone.
00:33:38.044 - 00:33:58.244, Speaker A: Great. And any views on attributed security versus poor security? It seems like right now the meta is really poor security, but I feel like some protocol builders might also want to have like at least a percentage of their security being attributed only to them.
00:33:59.064 - 00:34:58.786, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think it's a, I don't know, it's an interesting discussion. Like, I think it's just kind of like another layer of security, right? Like, it makes sense that you would have both, because like, in a scenario where, you know, shared the pool, the shared security should theoretically be the most secure layer compared to the attributable security because you may have four avss and they're all sharing the same security. So it may be more difficult for that shared security to be corrupted. Right. But in a scenario where maybe three of the avss are corrupted and that one, Abs, is honest and isn't corrupted, it may make sense for that one AV's to have attributable security. Right.
00:34:58.786 - 00:35:39.094, Speaker B: Because now they have like a backup that is protecting them. They still have some amount of security even though the majority of their shared security has been corrupted. Right. And so that's where it makes sense to have some additional layer. So I would imagine that most avss will probably go that route where they have like an additional layer of security and not just the shared security. There are some other considerations in there, but I think of it like less of a, like a versus and more of just like perhaps how much attributable security they would have compared to their shared security. Cool.
00:35:39.884 - 00:35:55.812, Speaker A: And my follow up question is, around, like, your roadmap, you talked about being heads down, focused on releasing on Mainnet. Do you have a timeline that you, where you, when you expect to be on Mainnet?
00:35:55.988 - 00:37:04.994, Speaker B: Yeah, it's like the fundamental question everybody asks is when all the stuff, right? I mean, right now we're really projecting for like an end of Q two testnet. Um, and I think that given where we are, we're making like, really good progress on the client, on the protocol. Um, and I think that that timeline still seems like pretty good. Um, we'll probably still have like some additional things that we want to like kind of like clean up by the time we get to, to testnet. But I think right now it's looking pretty good on that end. Mainnet. I'd say we're going to try to shoot for this year, but I think really taking an iterative process to getting this functionality out, getting operators to experiment with it, getting protocols to experiment with it, and trying to understand what are maybe some really important features that we need to get some good feedback from them and understand how we could really make the system super solid before we get to that mainnet stage.
00:37:07.414 - 00:37:45.734, Speaker D: Very cool. And talking with earlier we talked about the developer and the protocols that I use your protocol to secure and have all these others on the side, but on the operative side, which is kind of the same type of actors there. What's kind of your view, Richard, you mentioned that you kind of know the space pretty well with your past experiences. How do you as a protocol kind of create a healthy operator set and what do you expect from operators today when contributing to your protocol?
00:37:46.354 - 00:38:34.528, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a really good question. I think my experience at Oval led me to believe, probably naively, that I would just come to Joe Sera and I'd be able to make a few calls to some friends I kind of know like who's good, who's not good, who's reputable, who's less reputable and just like easily onboard everybody. But then I realized that actually the majority of node operators are actually pretty good. Most of them haven't been slashed before. A lot of them are already in the existing Eigen layer set. And then you know, if we kind of talk to ourselves, we want to bring on 25 node operators to start when we launch testnet and ultimately mainnet. I think we got to the point very quickly that the 25 spots filled up and now we're like two or three x over subscribed with respect to interest and joining the initial operator set.
00:38:34.528 - 00:39:12.204, Speaker C: So we've obviously now had to get a little bit more granular with respect to our analysis of like who we want to work with and why. I think obviously reputation being a critical factor or deterrent for our initial v one, right. Like you know, we're using kind of like reputation as almost like the bond, so to say. Uh, for our early stages of v one. So obviously we want to work with operators that have a lot of reputation at stake so they don't act maliciously. Um, I think that if you go kind of like a step further, I think, like, a pretty basic answer would be, we want to work with, like, the biggest and the most reputable. But that's actually not the reality.
00:39:12.204 - 00:39:57.528, Speaker C: The groups that we want to work with the most are the ones that are more nimble, that probably don't have a lot of vc investment, that are only very, very granularly focused on the bottom line, and it's making all the decisions based off the numbers and the net profit. We want to work with super nimble, super innovative operators that are at the bleeding edge. They want to work with a lot of these abs is, they're probably a part of new proof of stake ecosystems. Um, you know, obviously never been. Slash is like a really critical one for us. And like, getting into the Eigen layer set, if not already a part of the Eigen layer set for when we do become an ABS is another critical factor for us. But we're not necessarily thinking about what their delegation looks like today.
00:39:57.528 - 00:40:45.600, Speaker C: We want people that are going to be testing the technology with us, like hand in hand. Right. Like, for us, the way that we view operators fundamentally, or that they are first class citizens. We want operators to feel like they are empowered to take part in ownership of the network long term. But with that, responsibility also comes, or with that, like, upside, I would say comes the responsibility of them working really closely with us on making sure that we can get the best data out there so we can understand how many traps each operator can run. Um, so I think we've started to optimize more for, like, that nimble, more innovative approach that are operators that are on the forefront as opposed to the groups that have, you know, raised a ton of venture capital. Now, granted, like, obviously there's tons of groups out there that are really good, that we absolutely love to work with, that have raised capital, obviously, you guys being one of them.
00:40:45.600 - 00:41:29.864, Speaker C: Right? Like, when I say we almost prefer not to work with groups that, that haven't raised venture capital, uh, that certainly does not, like, preclude us from wanting to work with those groups because you guys are obviously very reputable, and the figments and the block demons of the world, et cetera, are extremely reputable. So we'd be foolish to not want to work with them, but it's not what we're necessarily optimizing for. Right. So in terms of, like, what there is for, for upside, obviously for us, we want groups that are nimble, and they're going to work closely with us in terms of the operators themselves. Uh, as I said before, operators are first class citizens. So we want to make sure that they feel empowered to take ownership of the protocol. And so as a result, we're going to make sure that they're obviously, like, well suited and well compensated for their time without going into too many details about what ecosystem incentives look like, et cetera.
00:41:31.444 - 00:42:07.844, Speaker D: Yeah, cool. Having a distributed kind of set of contributors to the protocol itself. Yeah, pretty, pretty cool. And yeah, you just mentioned, like, instances, like, just high level between these, like, protocols, operators, risk takers, all these actors, like, what's kind of the high level overview of how the economics will work there. And yeah, as we mentioned, depending on the economic security you want to have, depending on the number of operators you want to answer by change, but just a higher than overview of this Nissan flow.
00:42:09.264 - 00:43:02.834, Speaker C: Yeah, I'm happy to touch on what our kind of business model is at Josera and what that interplay looks like, but maybe more on the crypto economic side. I'll pass it on to Boba here shortly. But in terms of like, how stakers, how operators are remunerated in the context of performing services or security services for protocols, as an operator within Josera, the way that they get paid is obviously for every single trap that's deployed on the protocol side, there essentially comes a security budget of sorts. Right. And so with respect to the security budget is essentially what protocols are willing to pay in any arbitrary period of time. It's a month, it's a quarter, it's maybe half a year, it's a full year that would be denominated in ETH. So the operators would essentially get paid directly from the protocol for providing the decentralized incident response service.
00:43:02.834 - 00:43:55.484, Speaker C: We have built a marketplace that's basically how we view a decentralized product. To thrive and be sustainable over the long term is to create more of a marketplace model so the operators have total autonomy to join one security opportunity over another. If one protocol is not going to put up any sort of budget for the security and expect operators to join on board, then they're neglecting basic free market dynamics. So obviously, each protocol will be incentivized to put up at least a little bit of a budget to make sure that they're getting a requisite amount of application security. So whether that's a one eTH per month or two eth per month, five eth per month, or per quarter per year, the free market dynamics will basically create an equilibrium to understand pricing discovery and pricing mechanisms that are sustainable. On the protocol side. Operators get paid directly from the protocols in that regard.
00:43:55.484 - 00:45:19.764, Speaker C: And Josera gets compensated due to the fact that we would take a small marketplace fee, essentially. Were still working out what those exact figures look like, but the majority of the assets from the protocols will go to the operators because theyre the ones that make the world go round in the context of Josera, so to say. Um, in terms of like, the stakers, I mean, I can tell you, I'm sure you guys have spoken to a lot of ABS's, so you probably have a good idea of like, what stakers are compensated, uh, in the context of LRT protocols, right? So if I'm a depositor into an LRT protocol, I expect to get compensated by these different AV's tokens in exchange for me depositing my ETH into, you know, X, Y, z LRT protocol. Um, I'm sure it's probably been discussed on previous episodes, but, you know, the going rate for those are like, generally anywhere between 0.5% APY, 1% APY denominated in the platform token. That's, again, you've probably heard that multiple times already. I think the more interesting part to this discussion, though, is like, how does that payment actually take place, right? Like, what are they paid in? And like, the answer that I just gave in that example would be like some sort of AV's token, right? But the reality is, is that what if this XYZ Avs token ends up mooning, right? Like, are the stakers going to get compensated? And like a reduced rate, is it all going to be compensated? Or like, recalibrated back to ETH, right? Or all of a sudden that 0.5%
00:45:19.764 - 00:46:11.484, Speaker C: APY, is that going to jump to 10% APY? Because the token that they're getting compensated in all the sun moons, right? Or conversely, what if that aven goes from like one dollar to one cent? Now, you're essentially, you know, as a staker, you're going to pay like 0.005 APY or whatever it is. I'm terrible at head math, but I think you guys get the point. Um, so I think understanding basically, like, roughly how they actually get compensated if it is going to be in an ABS token, is what's really important. I would imagine there'd probably be some, like some dynamic adjustment that would take place if the compensation will be remunerated in an ABS token. I'm not sure if that answers your question comprehensively, but that's kind of where we spend the most of our time on with respect to incentives and who gets paid, why they get paid, how much they get paid, Bob? I don't know if you want to add any additional information.
00:46:13.864 - 00:47:24.144, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that, yeah, I mean, it's a good synopsis of just kind of rewards in general and how they flow down from protocol to the operators, like running these traps and. Yeah, I mean, on the staking side, I mean, the idea is that the operators are essentially the ones like pulling in the revenue and then they're the ones delegating it out to the stakers. Right. Like based off of how much crypto economic security was delegated to them. And so I think that that's like, I think that's like theoretically like straightforward, but I don't think any practical, any practical implementations are really put into place or payment rails are put in place between the stakers and the operators. Right now, really we're focused on just making sure the operators are the ones that are getting paid and then for them to facilitate how this payment makes its way to the stakers.
00:47:25.884 - 00:47:34.704, Speaker A: Yeah, just, just being conscious of time. I know we're a bit over. Do you guys have any hard stops in the next minutes?
00:47:35.804 - 00:47:37.624, Speaker C: I can go on for another ten minutes.
00:47:38.124 - 00:47:50.464, Speaker A: Okay, yeah, perfect. So my question was just to making sure I understand clearly. So like the operators and the restakers, they get compensated when traps are triggered.
00:47:51.524 - 00:49:00.750, Speaker B: So essentially there's essentially a passive rate and then there's an active reward. So the passive rate would be for participating. You're doing consensus with other node operators of the state of the trap. It's like everybody is every block saying, and they're testing with the BLS signatures. Like this is valid, it's valid, it's valid, it's valid. And as they're doing this passive monitoring, they're incurring a passive rate of this report that's streaming from the protocols through this trap and then distributed to the operators who are passively running this system. Then when incident does occur, then it becomes kind of like a competition where basically the operators are trying to aggregate at a minimum two thirds signatures to be able to submit those signatures and have the response action get triggered on their behalf.
00:49:00.750 - 00:49:42.524, Speaker B: Plus the other signers that signed, yes, this incident just occurred. It's the signers plus the person actually sent the submission to have this response action get triggered. They're the ones that are going to get rewarded with the active rewards. I'd say it's a two part system. You have your passive element and you have your active element, and the active element has a bit of a cooperation vibe where you're all working together to attest to this incident that occurred, and then you're reaping the rewards for actually being the first to have the response action get triggered.
00:49:43.784 - 00:50:09.476, Speaker A: Okay, just finishing off on the incentives part. This is going to be, of course, the size of the incentives are going to be dependent on how many protocols are using Drosera. Do you already have protocols like standing by and ready to, to adopt Drosera when you guys launch on Mainnet? What's the, do you have any updates on the, on the b side?
00:50:09.620 - 00:50:38.884, Speaker C: Yeah, we have 25, maybe even close to 30 protocols that I've committed to the technology. Right. Whether that's in the form of test participation, main net participation. We have Loi's Mou sign or, you know, with multiple heavy hitter DeFi protocols. Some infrastructure companies as well. One or two bridges, a lot of L2s. Yeah, I mean, really, it's like a pretty large diversity of potential users.
00:50:38.884 - 00:51:08.744, Speaker C: But I mean, I would say that like defi liquid restaking and L2 have definitely been kind of where the majority of our early adoption has been seen. Uh, but to answer your question, yeah, we have 25, uh, at least 25, uh, protocols that have committed, uh, which is obviously we're really excited because we haven't even tested yet. So we're doing a pretty good job of like selling the conceptual value proposition of the technology. Um, so yeah, no, we, we definitely have a nice roster.
00:51:09.324 - 00:51:59.134, Speaker A: That's great. And like zooming out a little bit, like, uh, I think it's really great. I think it's great that you're building what you're building because it kind of shows the power of prestaking and the power of having a free market for decentralized trust. Because like initially when, when people thought about in AR, they thought it would be, oh, it's going to be a great way to do like decentralized sequencing for l two s. Like just saying, like, oh, it's going, let's validate all the chains, you guys. By building procera, you prove that it could be, those use cases could be a lot more exotic and complex than that. What is your long term vision for eigenaion risk taking as a whole? Do you feel like we'll be seeing more and more complex and exotic aliases?
00:52:01.194 - 00:53:05.450, Speaker B: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, for sure. I mean, I think that we're really just scratching the surface right now. Just proving, hey, we can essentially make these coprocessors that feed data out of the blockchain and then right back in using ZK technology, just cryptography in general, using a marketplace for cryptoeconomic security. I think that right now we're just looking at the initial enzymes. We're all in the chemistry lab, like kind of experimenting and trying to figure out how we can make this stuff work and how we can actually make like a better Defi and a better crypto using these new technologies. And so, I mean, for the future, I imagine that we're going to see kind of like a rapid cooperation, I think, between everybody because that's like what this is all allowing.
00:53:05.450 - 00:54:12.976, Speaker B: It's allowing for everybody to coordinate through cryptography in a way that wasn't really possible before. So I imagine that we're going to see a lot of very new, innovative things. I don't necessarily know what those might be. I think if somebody wants to know, you probably can set up a meeting with, with me and we can brainstorm and think about it. Because I think that there's a whole host of different applications, Dapps services that probably exist in web two and don't exist yet in web3. I think with what we're doing, we're just showing that we can build this base security layer that allows for, you know, essentially validators to not just do consensus layer security, but application layer security. And, yeah, I think that this is just going to allow for us to have, I don't know, web3 without compromise.
00:54:12.976 - 00:54:22.084, Speaker B: Right. Don't have to give up on sovereignty, decentralization, you know, or trustlessness. Right.
00:54:23.684 - 00:54:49.584, Speaker D: And talking about the future, do you think we will see more and more alternatives to Egan layer? I mean, they've been kind of the first mover, kind of the innovator of this space. Do you think the future is like multi kind of rest taking hubs where we kind of have economic security behavior? What's your view on that?
00:54:50.654 - 00:55:42.528, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I definitely think, yeah, and like, boba, I'll let you opine on this shortly, but I think we've already started to see some competitors pop up, right? I mean, there's one called Kerak. There's at least one more that I know that isn't really public yet, so I'm going to refrain from saying the name. However, I know that it will definitely be competitive of sorts. But the reality is, guys, is that like, just like with liquid staking and with staking, the Ethereum ecosystem has its own like natural immune system, right? Where like state centralization is a very big concern amongst the ogs within the community and even like the new entrants in the community, right? This isn't just an OG Ethereum problem. This is a problem that affects everyone that touches the ecosystem. Decentralization is the core ethos of Ethereum. Obviously, it's something that we've built our product based off that foundational principle of decentralization.
00:55:42.528 - 00:56:20.222, Speaker C: So, yeah, I mean, Ethereum won't allow or won't allow for just one restaking protocol. Business forces might have something else to say about it. Right? Like, I mean, Lido is obviously dominating in the liquid staking space with the Ethereum group of stake space, really as a whole for a long time. And even in the midst of getting a lot of pressure from the community, they still held a significant market traction or market share for a long period of time, and they still do. Right there at 29%. It's gone down because liquid restaking is now taking market share away from Lido. I would imagine they probably have something to say about that nonetheless, as like very savvy business people over there.
00:56:20.222 - 00:56:47.284, Speaker C: But nonetheless, though, no, I don't believe there's going to be just one restaking protocol. There's already another one out there. I don't know how viable it is. I don't really know much about Kerak, to be honest. But there's a couple others that are coming that I think will probably be fighting for market share. I think ultimately Ethereum would just never allow for there to be one restaking protocol. So Eigen layer has a first mover advantage.
00:56:47.284 - 00:57:07.824, Speaker C: It will absolutely continue to accrue a lot of stake, there's no question about that. But I think that there's a pretty big pie to take a slice from, so to say, which is the Ethereum ecosystem. So, yeah, there's definitely going to be like three, four, five. The amount of adoption we'll see, but there's certainly going to be more than one.
00:57:08.204 - 00:57:09.996, Speaker B: Yeah. Yep.
00:57:10.060 - 00:57:13.664, Speaker A: Perfect. Anything you had something to add, Robert?
00:57:14.524 - 00:58:30.914, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that I just like take, I think of these things like, a lot from just like a fundamental kind of like engineering mindset, which is just that, like, you know, there is just gonna, there's always just gonna be like more variants of these different types of like, systems. And it's just because like, you know, every system takes like different design choices and different design choices have different pros and different cons, and that's just like the nature of engineering. There's not really like a way to get design a system that only has pros. Right? That's just not possible. I wish it were, but it's not. I think that we may see new platforms like popup that are designed to have pros that are very attractive for certain types of abses or certain types of services and not as attractive to others. I think that we'll just see that constant optimization that we see in this space so that people say like, oh, I want to work with this guy because this actually makes my product viable where it may not be viable over here because of X, Y and Z.
00:58:30.914 - 00:58:43.114, Speaker B: So, yeah, I imagine that that's what we're going to see in the future is just people trying to optimize for use cases. Yeah.
00:58:45.214 - 00:59:05.944, Speaker A: Super interesting. Great conversation, guys. Thank you so much for giving your time. It's great. It's the first time we have two guests on. So great to have you. I let you guys just share a bit, like your socials, like how listeners can learn more about Josera, and then we'll wrap this up.
00:59:07.084 - 00:59:37.648, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So if I remember correctly, let me just check. Here we are on Twitter, or X, as it's called now at drosera network. Would definitely love for you guys to give us a follow. And, you know, we're putting out a lot more content nowadays and have some exciting announcements with some protocols coming up here shortly. So definitely follow us there. We're not really much on, like, LinkedIn or any of these other platforms, so definitely, I would say Twitter is your place to go.
00:59:37.648 - 01:00:03.064, Speaker C: We also, of course, have some dev docs, if the developers are listening here, are interested in learning more about a trap or even like, the operators that might be listening. And we have a little blurb about what being an operator in Josera context looks like. So I think that's Dev Josera IO. So please feel free to give us a look over there. And, yeah, I think that's probably a good summation. Thank you so much for having us, guys.
01:00:04.484 - 01:00:05.424, Speaker A: Pleasure.
01:00:06.244 - 01:00:07.304, Speaker B: Awesome, thanks.
01:00:07.904 - 01:00:08.808, Speaker C: All right, cheers, guys.
01:00:08.856 - 01:00:09.444, Speaker A: Great.
01:00:09.744 - 01:00:10.144, Speaker C: Bye, everyone.
