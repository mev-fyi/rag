00:00:00.330 - 00:00:23.710, Speaker A: So basically in the restake framework, we offer three kinds of AVSs. So basically there are three main products. One is what we call squad, which is basically decentralized sequencing. So you would say, hey, I want to have five sequences. And this squad will basically act as an ABS for decentralized sequencing. So that's number one. Number two is what we call vital, which is an ABS for verification.
00:00:23.710 - 00:00:52.650, Speaker A: And the reason you want verification is because if you look at arbitrum today, you have these nodes that check whether the sequences are behaving correctly. And if not, they would do fraud proofs, right? They would challenge. It'd be good to bake that system directly into application specific rules. The idea is once you start a roll up, you will have these nodes that will verify the system for you and will check if everything is operating correctly. And the third one is what we call Mac, which is an ABS for faster finality.
