00:00:07.600 - 00:00:13.785, Speaker A: Great, Paul, thanks for coming over. It was very, I guess very far from your office.
00:00:13.905 - 00:00:16.889, Speaker B: Yeah, I had to walk like 15 minutes or something.
00:00:16.977 - 00:00:20.737, Speaker A: Right. And we have Macau, so it's like. Yeah.
00:00:20.761 - 00:00:29.445, Speaker B: And good coffee. So that's awesome. And I just remembers me like two years ago I was actually like how it was more forward having offices like few floors above.
00:00:29.545 - 00:00:30.277, Speaker A: That's right.
00:00:30.421 - 00:00:44.645, Speaker B: It's always a pleasure to come into this office because it just reminds me of like the memories and stuff. But yeah, I mean you guys have come a long way now, like all over the building. That's exciting. I'm glad to be here. That's awesome. Yeah, you're right.
00:00:44.685 - 00:01:05.235, Speaker A: That thing that definitely where it all started. And it's funny that we are two French speaking in English even together, which makes a lot of sense. But as you mentioned, you started here in the same place two years ago. Maybe can you a little bit introduce yourself and how it all started?
00:01:05.355 - 00:01:57.299, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I'm Paul and CEO of MorphoLabs. We built the Morpho protocol, which is the third largest lending and borrowing protocol on Ethereum. We have approximately $3 billion of liquidity that is deposited in the protocol and borrowed, etc. And we started two years and a half ago, almost three years now as we were students I was studying distributed computing and consensus algorithms in Paris and throughout my studies met a bunch of people working on Blockchain and yeah decided to start Morpho at the time and our first offices were like in this building actually at the top floor. And at the time we're like six students I think. And that was so good.
00:01:57.299 - 00:03:02.397, Speaker B: So we used to meet there and then we raised funds multiple times and we got to build the first version of the protocol which is called Morpho Optimizer, which was initially an optimization layer for AAVEN Compound. So it was built on top of Aaven Compound and improving Aaven Compound's rates. We took this protocol to multiple billions of dollars of deposits. But very quickly we realized that we were too limited for the ambition of transforming lending and borrowing that exist in traditional finance with this model. So we decided to build a second protocol which is called Morpho Blue. I guess we'll have the chance to talk about which is completely independent from AAVE and compound and that is its own peritionist and immutable lending and borrowing protocol on Ethereum, which today has more than 1 billion, 1.5 billion I think on its own of deposits.
00:03:02.397 - 00:03:04.425, Speaker B: So yeah, that's the shrimpage.
00:03:04.885 - 00:03:28.269, Speaker A: And before I guess we jump right into what Morpho is doing today and Morpho Blue and all the other innovations that you brought to the space. Can you. The beginning Morpho are actually very fun. Maybe can you first explain why you decided to become an entrepreneur? Or was it like something you had in mind for a while and.
00:03:28.397 - 00:03:28.749, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:28.797 - 00:03:32.677, Speaker A: How did you build a company at what, 20 years old you were back then?
00:03:32.861 - 00:03:52.995, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I think that's the age approximately. So I've always been interested in entrepreneurship. If one more fall, like everybody, like, usually they tell me, oh, you've been like, lucky first venture, 20 years old. What they don't know is the four years before that I've been trying to build companies and they all failed.
00:03:53.035 - 00:03:53.211, Speaker C: Right.
00:03:53.243 - 00:04:54.441, Speaker B: So it's been four very dry years of trying to build something. So I've tried in real estate, I've tried in recruitment, I've tried in streaming industry as well. And every time it was like a failure. And so in my second year of engineering school, I decided to join this entrepreneurship patient with a second patient of mine, which was blockchain. And I had been studying blockchain for a while already at school, like, I'm in university, and for the first time I decided to bridge the two and say, okay, maybe quite knowledgeable about blockchain, and I don't like to do a project, so let's just like merge the two and. Yeah. And from there I explored a bunch of different ideas, met with a bunch of extremely smart people, and this is how the first ideas came to be.
00:04:54.441 - 00:05:42.095, Speaker B: And we iterated on a bunch of them and eventually became Morpho. I would have to say though, that before Morpho have always been repelled by the financial industry and even wrote an article about this few months ago where I used to hate finance, as it is, to me, it felt like a very despicable industry for many reasons. And I came to understand why. Blockchain technology in general, what does it truly bring to the financial infrastructure? What are the real benefits and understanding this, literally a few. A few days after I understood this, I started working on a project that uses blockchain and finance.
00:05:42.135 - 00:05:42.671, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:42.823 - 00:05:55.795, Speaker B: How can we use blockchain technology to make financial infrastructures public goods and enhance the current financial system, which has so many flows currently. So, yeah, that's the background story.
00:05:56.615 - 00:06:15.625, Speaker A: And yeah, you met with a couple very smart scientists as well that also launched Mongrove. And you were in the same office back then. How did I know? For example, Vincent de l'Host widow, both, well, helped you launch this venture.
00:06:16.005 - 00:06:39.185, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So I met with some kind of think tank. Like I joined some kind of think tank. But Defi, in the early days of Morpho were approximately like six different people. One of them was also Adrian was still working part time for Morpho today, Jean Puvin, et cetera. So a bunch of brilliant scientists. And they had a bunch of different ideas.
00:06:39.185 - 00:07:34.765, Speaker B: You know, one of them was Mangrove, another book on Chain. Another one was what they called at the time Salamiswap, which was basically Unison before Unisomy Free existed. And another project was around, like, how can we do pure to pure lending while taking advantage of the poor lending structure without getting too much into the details. And that was the project I was the most interested in. And so I started chatting with Vincent and Adrian about it and we iterated a lot. And I mean, those guys are craziest part and I just love talking and working with them and over time they just remain as advisors in the project. But initially for sure, in the beginning they listed like few of the interesting interiors that, you know, were core to the.
00:07:36.345 - 00:07:41.905, Speaker A: And that's also when you met your three other co founders.
00:07:42.065 - 00:08:12.465, Speaker B: Exactly right. So the previous projects I had done, like the previous ventures I had tried, I was alone. And I think that was the main reason why, you know, I decided not to pursue them, is just the journey is much more painful if you don't have friends to share it with or if you don't have like, you know, feedback loops and you're just on your own, you're very like on your name and you don't have critical feedback. And so I decided to really spend some time to get the best people out there.
00:08:12.505 - 00:08:12.705, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:12.745 - 00:09:00.585, Speaker B: And so what I did is, you know, I look at the different universities in Paris and I just looked for the best possible students that were knowledgeable about blockchain, established literally a list. And among them, the four smartest and people I really wanted to work with and super friendly and smart were the microfounders today. So Vernon, Mathis and Julian, we've been working together for two and a half years now, and there's not a single day in two and a half years where we did not exchange like less than 10 messages. And it's been an absolute pleasure and they're awesome.
00:09:01.885 - 00:09:04.413, Speaker A: And so you basically came to them.
00:09:04.549 - 00:09:05.557, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly right.
00:09:05.661 - 00:09:08.133, Speaker A: And you thought, okay, these guys are really, really smart.
00:09:08.189 - 00:09:39.915, Speaker B: And okay, yeah, and really did some kind of, like, I don't want to say recruitment process because it was really like human, but I really got in touch with each of them differently. You know, for different routes. And this is how we group together. I knew I didn't want to do this on my own and I wanted some people to share the journey with essentially. And I think that was the right choice. I'm sure that was the right.
00:09:40.695 - 00:10:06.511, Speaker A: Yeah. It's so hard to build companies, so alone usually gets very hard. Yeah, I mean, you mentioned it. You never wanted to work in finance and now you work in defi. So I guess what's, you know, defi, how defi is changing the world of finance and. Yeah, why would you like to work in defi and you wouldn't like to work in finance?
00:10:06.663 - 00:10:28.385, Speaker B: That's a good question. And that's a question I've been asking myself for years. Before doing Marshall, I think it really essentially comes down to three things. Like the financial industry as it is today is not efficient. It's not transparent and it's not resilient. It's not open and not resilient. So not efficient because everything takes time.
00:10:28.385 - 00:11:15.475, Speaker B: You have very high fees for the service that is produced, which is sometimes really ridiculous, Right? Like the, you know, like the financial infrastructure is where operations are computed. So like when you want to do any sort of financial operation, at the end of the day there is a variable in the server that gets updated. Well, this server is closed source, right. And it's not open like a blockchain is closed, right. So it completely rigs the free market aspect of things where anyone can compete freely with their algorithms, with their strategy on one common infrastructure. And it introduces very large inefficiencies in the system in terms of fees, but also in terms of time for settlement. So that's the first thing like efficiency.
00:11:15.475 - 00:12:52.153, Speaker B: The second thing is obviously transparency and openness, right? Which is less obvious, to be frank, in the beginning when you're among the lucky ones like us in France, where we had a system where you have, you know, reasonable access to financial services, but it's not the case for many people in the world, Right. And so just being able to build primitives that are open and that can be much more easily accessed by anybody with Internet connection in the world, the same way you access Internet protocols is really appealing for different reasons. And then finally there is the resiliency aspect, right? Like once you've built like an open and efficient like system, usually you would want it to be fully secure and resilient and with no central authority capable of, like manipulating it. Often efficiency comes down to, you know, having one single protocol for a specific primitive. Say for markets, for example, or for lending. But having. If you have only one entity doing all the financial transactions in the world, then it poses some questions, right? Like what is this entity? What can they do? Can they change the record of transactions? Can they essentially steal your money? Who controls that entity? Is it the government? Is it a company? And really this is what blockchain solves, provides guarantees that the market structure, the financial infrastructure, behaves as expected.
00:12:52.153 - 00:13:34.525, Speaker B: And it's such a powerful primitive to build truly efficient, open and resilient system. So yeah, I guess that was the motivation and coming to realize that we have. And I'll finish with this, I think it's a very important metric is in the world right Now. You have 50,000 different banks and credit union, they all have their own servers, right? They all do the same thing. At the end of the day, I'm a bit exaggerating, they do some risk management, blah, blah, blah. But they all have Those teams of DevOps engineers building the infrastructure and then they have their buildings, they have to host it, et cetera. And 50,000 times they're going to do more or less the same operation.
00:13:34.525 - 00:14:17.181, Speaker B: And we're transitioning from this situation where the physical device rules and the 50,000 banks rules to a structure where the blockchain is where everything is settled and you have one open algorithm and the algorithm rules, not the software, not the hardware. And we can talk about this with staking and what Kiln is doing, but. But really this software is king in defi and not the operator of the physical infrastructure. And this is such a powerful thing because now instead of having 50,000 times the same thing, you can guess that there is like a lot of inefficiencies. Now you have one open algorithm that's reused for the entire world.
00:14:17.253 - 00:14:17.509, Speaker C: Right?
00:14:17.557 - 00:14:34.437, Speaker A: Right, right. And then like very happy to understand as well what you built first and then why you built more for Blue. But is it why you built Morphoblue So that like this 15,000, 50,000 banks are using vaults on the protocol?
00:14:34.501 - 00:15:28.829, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Right, so you nailed it. Like we of course are currently building DEFI protocols for defi users, but the ambition is much larger than this. Like we keep thinking and asking ourselves, how can we build a protocol that is suited not only for the defi and crypto users today, but can truly extend fintechs or traditional finance that can actually power and be the backbone infrastructure that's reused by all financial applications. And when you think about it this way, it just changes a lot on how you think about mechanism, design, protocol implementation, et cetera. I know we can't talk about the competitive landscape lending for that, but yeah, that was the initial motivation was this very ambitious North Star, which goes way beyond what we're doing today in Defi. Because Defi today is frankly very, very small.
00:15:28.829 - 00:16:01.635, Speaker B: That's right. And it's very small and it's very endogenic. It's the same very wealthy crypto users that made a bunch of money because they were earning crypto or defi funds. Right. But frankly that's, you know, self, I would say like the. Yeah, you don't have a much use case outside of of defi specific users themselves. And there's a bunch of reasons for that, but it's probably another topic in itself.
00:16:02.175 - 00:16:13.239, Speaker A: So maybe can you explain what was the Morpho optimizer? The first product you launched and the second major protocol that you launched was Morpho Blue.
00:16:13.367 - 00:16:58.797, Speaker B: Sure. So Morpho started with a protocol called Morpho to Melder, which was an optimization protocol on top of AAVE and Compound. So AAVE and Compound are lending and bond protocols. And we built a layer on top of those protocols that was composing on top of their smart contract, where if you use this layer instead of AAVE directly, you would get better rates on AAVE while getting the same liquidity, the same risk parameters, et cetera, et cetera. And just to give the brief intuition on how it works, on aave you have a large spread between the lending rate and the borrowing rate. And on Morpho essentially we would map users. So let's say lending rate was at 1% and borrowing rate was at 3%.
00:16:58.797 - 00:17:34.998, Speaker B: On Morpho you would get the mid rate, right, not just 2%. And so lenders and borrowers would get a better deal. And if there is no one to match with impure peer, they would fall back to the AAVE protocol. And that was really, for us, a way to go to market and say, hey, you can use this protocol. It's better than this existing protocol that already has a lot of usage. And we grew this to, I'd say probably 2 billions or something like this, of dollars. So the point where it represents like a fairly very large proportion of AAVE and Compound itself, which has been considered, you know, by them as a problem.
00:17:34.998 - 00:18:14.961, Speaker B: We can talk about this later. But you know, frankly, it's never been the plan for us to grow this because we knew we were limited just because we were building on top of avi. We inherit the risk parameters, we inherit the lines of code, we inherit a bunch of things. And so we decided to build our own lending and barring protocol that's completely independent from aave that is called Morpher Blue and Morpher Blue. Really what it does is unbundling AAVE into two pieces. Avid is in compound. They do two things.
00:18:14.961 - 00:19:00.415, Speaker B: They do lending and borrowing and they do risk management all in one. So when you go to AAVE and you have some, you know, USDC and you deposit your USDC the AAVE down. So the token holders of AAVE are going to risk manage the spool. So they're going to constantly change risk parameters by saying who is allowed to borrow your capital? Right? And in practices, what does that mean? This means, okay, this collateral is accepted for a borrower. Like borrower can borrow your capital with WBTC or with, you know, Link or whatever, whatever token. And this is a very complex process. There is more than 700 parameters in AAVE.
00:19:00.415 - 00:19:22.923, Speaker B: And so the way AAVE works is that token holders, on a daily basis they have to change those barriers essentially. Right. And token orders frankly could be anyone, right? Like so in practice there is like a delegation system, etc. But you can't assume knowledge nor activity from a token owner.
00:19:22.979 - 00:19:23.531, Speaker C: Right?
00:19:23.683 - 00:19:51.375, Speaker B: And so they hire consultants in order to change those risk parameters. But then you have a bunch of problems related to that as well. What Morpho does is just the learning and borrowing part. So there is no risk management aspect. Right. The Morpho protocol is a completely immutable piece of code where anyone can deploy any lending market that they want under the risk parameters that they want. And once they're created, they're completely immutable.
00:19:51.375 - 00:20:07.979, Speaker B: And then as a user, if I go to a specific market and I have to do my own risk management essentially, so I don't have a DAO that is going to manage it for me.
00:20:08.027 - 00:20:08.211, Speaker C: Right?
00:20:08.243 - 00:20:52.909, Speaker B: And do the whole complex thing that we're talking about. So it has two advantages, one obvious upside and one obvious downside. The obvious upside is that the protocol can be much more efficient, which more simple because it's just one very simple thing. And so it's completely immutable, much safer for different reasons. Like the Avid Kanban protocol had a lot of different incidents over the past years. And some lending protocols like Euler, they got hacked hundreds of millions of dollars as well. And so Morphoglu in itself is like a completely, the most secure, efficient and flexible lending market, primitive market.
00:20:52.909 - 00:21:50.687, Speaker B: Right now as a user you don't want to do your risk management. And so this is why we have a second layer which is the Morpho vaults, where essentially anyone can rebuild the AAVE experience, where you get to deposit your funds and someone is going to essentially curate which markets you are getting exposed to. So it sort of recreates the risk profile that you have on AAVE as a lender anyway. So essentially the idea here is that as a user you are essentially interacting, either if you know how to do your risk management directly, interact with the primitive, which does much less than aave, but do it more efficiently and more securely. If you're a passive user, you go through the Morpho vaults layer and you have a bunch of different vaults doing different risk profiles, et cetera, et cetera, and they're going to do the hard work for you, essentially.
00:21:50.751 - 00:21:51.355, Speaker C: Right?
00:21:51.695 - 00:22:38.131, Speaker B: And so it gives you the same experience as AAVE where it's like super passive. You generate yields, except now you have a tailored risk exposure. So on aave you have a one size fits all risk profile. On Morpho, you have each vault that has a specific risk exposure. And you don't get to subscribe to the world pack of like 30 different assets of collateral, which some would say are becoming quite risky over time if you want to be exposed to just two assets. And the most successful vault on Morpho, that's an interesting one, are always backed by very blue chip assets, immutable codes, two collateral assets that arguably one of the safest products in the entire decentralized finance space. Mature girls have much more risky things.
00:22:38.131 - 00:23:10.345, Speaker B: So we have vaults in the Morpho blue ecosystem that provide much higher API than aave, but are having much higher risk. You could also have different compliance, right, Depending on where you live, the legislation that is enforced in your country, you may not want to use one vault over another. And so the morpho infrastructure lets you sort of edit this and configure what you need and when on avi, again, it's a one size fits all for risk, but also for compliance, where everybody is treated equally.
00:23:12.445 - 00:23:32.609, Speaker A: You mentioned the vault managers, the passive investors and passive lenders and borrowers of the protocol. What kind of companies do you see managing Volts today? And do you think in the future One of these 50,000 banks will manage vaults one day?
00:23:32.737 - 00:24:05.155, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very good question. So right now we have approximately 10 volt traders among the best risk experts in the space, or Daos. So what's interesting, now it's an open market, there is not a single Dao that has exclusivity around risk management. Now anyone can do their own risk management work. And so you, for example, have the Gauntlet that used to do risk management for AAVE and they decided to leave AAVE for Morpho like a few months ago to build their own vault.
00:24:05.195 - 00:24:05.371, Speaker C: Right.
00:24:05.403 - 00:24:32.665, Speaker B: So Gauntlet has a bunch of different vaults with different risk flavors and they can configure them how they like, et cetera. So that's one example. Another one is, for example Steakhouse Financial. Steakhouse is doing both risk but also real world assets analysis. They have a huge expertise around real world assets. And so they can provide the vault that is exposed to both crypto collateral and real world asset collaterals. Right.
00:24:32.665 - 00:24:55.543, Speaker B: And provide a service that essentially gives you the best yield of traditional finance and decentralized finance. You have Maker, Maker is a dao and they're managing their own vault the same way, you know, AAVE is a dao and they're managing their role while you have daos that are entirely building their role and you have each of those and eventually.
00:24:55.599 - 00:25:02.115, Speaker A: And in that case, the DAO will vote for how to manage and parameter.
00:25:02.415 - 00:25:06.383, Speaker B: The morpholog exactly the same way AAVE is doing.
00:25:06.479 - 00:25:06.831, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:06.903 - 00:25:07.455, Speaker A: And jupyter.
00:25:07.455 - 00:25:21.457, Speaker B: Cool. And this is what I like really about Morpho is the incentive game is much healthier in the sense that now risk management is a completely a free market.
00:25:21.521 - 00:25:21.889, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:21.977 - 00:25:37.625, Speaker B: And so if the down model is the best model for a specific use case, that made me users with eventually disable this. If there is like a centralized regulated entity like a bank, as you were mentioning, that's going to build if this is the winning thing with like, you know, then maybe.
00:25:37.705 - 00:25:37.945, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:37.985 - 00:25:40.993, Speaker B: And. But we don't have any opinion on how risk management should be operated.
00:25:41.049 - 00:25:41.645, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:42.035 - 00:25:53.371, Speaker B: So see, and the interesting thing is that all those different markets, they compose risk differently, they compose Morpho Blue markets differently, but they all share a common ground, which is Morpho Blue.
00:25:53.403 - 00:25:53.523, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:53.539 - 00:26:15.035, Speaker B: So the Morpho Blue protocol is common to own those different metamorpho bots. And so if I'm gauntlets or if I'm Steakhouse, if I do use some markets in common, well, I'll share liquidity to the extent that I share risk. Those vaults are not isolated. Right. It's not like Gauntlet builds their vaults completely isolated from stakeholders. That builds their vaults. That would be more like profile.
00:26:15.035 - 00:26:34.955, Speaker B: We again have 50,000 different things. They build different instances, but they share a common market to the extent that they share risk. Right, right. That unlocks additional efficiency and a bunch of things that are not possible in drive.
00:26:35.465 - 00:27:11.563, Speaker A: And you were mentioning AWS which is one of the assets that will be bor or len on a protocol, do you think? I mean first of all, like what is going to be more for blue in five years in terms of like assets, what kind of asset do you think will be the most, you know, kind of swap? Lend it borrowed and do you think because in case of real world assets, it means you have to do kyc. How do you approach this KYC defi?
00:27:11.619 - 00:27:12.819, Speaker B: Do you think DEFI is going to.
00:27:12.827 - 00:27:15.155, Speaker A: Be by design KYC at some point?
00:27:15.315 - 00:27:34.215, Speaker B: So I think we should be permission agnostic rather than permissionless. I think there is a big confusion when people say ok, something is permissionless. What does that mean? Does it mean that everybody is blended and touching the same pool of capital? Like AV is permissionless for users.
00:27:34.295 - 00:27:34.679, Speaker C: Right?
00:27:34.767 - 00:27:41.399, Speaker B: But it's not permissionless in the sense that if you want to impose specific conditions on who can touch your capital, then you can't.
00:27:41.487 - 00:27:42.115, Speaker C: Right?
00:27:43.015 - 00:28:33.983, Speaker B: On morphoblue, we're permissionless in the sense that not only anyone can interact with any market if the market allows certain conditions. So for example, permissionlessly I can create any market with any access control that I want. So for example, if in one market I wanted a specific koi sin to be enforced because I'm obliged to because of my regulation, then I can. But at the protocol we have no opinion about regulation should be enforced the same way. HTTP does not have an opinion about the Internet traffic flow that goes through HTTP. Right. It's for the client, like the application, to essentially regulate and to apply its local regime depending on who is the end customer.
00:28:34.119 - 00:28:34.583, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:34.679 - 00:29:32.361, Speaker B: So it's very interesting because in that sense Morphable is not positioning itself as a product that's directly mapping with the user like you know, like AV is. But it's much more of an infrastructure where you can think of it more as an Internet protocol than it is to a financial product essentially or a decentralized financial product. So it's an Internet protocol where anyone can impose its own gating system. And I'm expecting more and more of those KYC applications because countries are imposing it. But I'm also envisioning a bunch of innovation in that space and how one KYC can be compatible with one another. How can you aggregate some QIC in such a way that going to bring much more efficiency and liquidity to the space? Like for example, if I do a KYC on an exchange, how can I reuse that in order to do something else, et cetera, all on one vault and the other one right, exactly.
00:29:32.393 - 00:29:39.545, Speaker A: You don't want to do like T2KYC, supposing you now using two different markets from two different vault managers.
00:29:39.625 - 00:30:16.865, Speaker B: Exactly. In an ideal world, I have my Web3 identity vaults and when I present myself to an interface, everything gets automatically filtered. That's according to what I'm allowed to touch and also according to my conditions. And then I have access to everything, everybody that's at least compatible with me. It does not have to be an exact match, they just have to fulfill at least my conditions. And I think this is such an interesting space and I think also a huge business opportunity for companies building KYC Tech. I don't know if that's even a word, but.
00:30:19.125 - 00:30:31.865, Speaker A: Yep. And in terms of assets being on the platform today, what are you seeing and what are you expecting to see in five, 10 years?
00:30:32.925 - 00:30:44.081, Speaker B: So right now most users are just, you know, as I was mentioning, high net first individual that made a lot of money in crypto or defi funds.
00:30:44.113 - 00:30:44.281, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:44.313 - 00:31:04.377, Speaker B: That see the opportunity in the crypto yield. Right. It's mostly crypto yield. What I mean by crypto yield is yield that you can only get in crypto. Usually it's powered by two things. Either artificial incentives, which are powered by high valuation of investments, or by crypto.
00:31:04.441 - 00:31:09.865, Speaker A: So for example, boost of APY from protocol. Right. And protocol tokens.
00:31:09.945 - 00:31:22.407, Speaker B: Exactly. Okay, so usually what protocol do to bootstrap their protocol and morpho does this too. We distribute some tokens. Right, right. And those tokens are valued something because people expect the protocol to grow even more.
00:31:22.471 - 00:31:23.075, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:25.655 - 00:31:43.985, Speaker B: And the second APO source is really like crypto leverage. So people that want to leverage on their crypto, it turns out this drives interest rates higher. And so this is really crypto native yields. But that's frankly a fairly small market opportunity. I mean, we're talking about, you know, maybe $50 billion. Right. In total.
00:31:43.985 - 00:31:57.289, Speaker B: Right. That's tiny. Like just as a comparison, daily over collateralized lending markets in Tradfi is like, you know, tens of trillions of dollars. Right. So it's just like several orders of magnitude away from what it could be.
00:31:57.377 - 00:31:58.005, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:58.345 - 00:32:23.375, Speaker B: And so yeah, so right now, very crypto focused, but obviously with the ambition of going much broader than this, which requires some profound changes in the way we think about DEFI in our opinion. And yeah, not much I can share at the moment, but this is something we've been heavily researching and working on over the last six months, so that.
00:32:23.455 - 00:32:51.831, Speaker A: Maybe one day you have more real world assets. You have a part of ChatFi that is actually moving to the morpho blue protocol so that you can lend and borrow kind of easy, right? And I guess it's kind of a related question, but you can not forcibly talk about defi and not forcibly talk about morpho. But how do you see the Defi world in 5, 10 years and what you think is going to be the killer kind of app?
00:32:51.863 - 00:32:52.435, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:52.895 - 00:33:08.755, Speaker A: Will the ecosystem say, okay, stablecoin is going to be the product that will give or make access crypto to billions of users or it's decentralized social media or social platform?
00:33:09.335 - 00:33:09.687, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:33:09.711 - 00:33:15.135, Speaker A: What do you think is going to be a collab and how the world buy or in web3 in general and when.
00:33:15.295 - 00:33:55.219, Speaker B: Yeah, so it's just like we have five major use case with product market fit or looking south product fits with markets like decentralized exchanges. So that's, you know, the market of Uniswap stablecoins which are like, you know, maker FRACs, angle, etc. You have lending, right? Lending and borrowing and credit in general is like a very, you know, fundamental primitive staking which you know, much better than I do. And social networks. To me those are the five areas I'm probably missing some. But to me that's like the five areas with very clear product market fit.
00:33:55.267 - 00:33:55.547, Speaker C: Right?
00:33:55.611 - 00:34:22.813, Speaker B: Right. As applications in defi. I mean staking can be discussed if it's like an application or an infra. But yeah, you know, I'm very bullish for pre socials in general. I think decentralized trust is more needed than ever in the world and we have with the vault creators, for example, the need for that.
00:34:22.869 - 00:34:23.109, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:23.157 - 00:34:46.220, Speaker B: Like people know Gauntlet, it has a brand and has a power, right. A steakhouse is a bit less known than Gauntlet, but there are also an exceptional team block and etc, same thing, right. Riskdao, et cetera, average 7 and how as a user can I interact with something and in a trustless way know that it can be trusted?
00:34:46.292 - 00:34:46.904, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:47.204 - 00:35:26.085, Speaker B: And if for example, I have my Farcaster account, right, which is linked, which you know, has a social proof some people are following, I have a social graph that's valuable because it has been growing for the last five years as a company and I'm followed by all those people that I trust and I can reuse this social graph and as the gauntlet vault owner or the steakhouse vault owner, I can say, hey, here is my social graph and you can see, oh, you can trust this vault, right? Essentially, if you don't want to do the hard work, etc. That's a stupid example.
00:35:26.165 - 00:35:26.549, Speaker C: Right?
00:35:26.637 - 00:35:56.449, Speaker B: But I think eventually you're going to get the idea that you can't do this with a Twitter API. Like you can imagine doing this, but with the Twitter API. But then, okay, what if Twitter changes the API? First, it would break everything. Second, you know, we're talking about trusting people with your money and so you probably want a trustless system, etc. That's just one tiny example of an extremely valuable thing that a social graph can do. And so, yeah, so I'm very, very bullish on this one.
00:35:56.497 - 00:36:03.001, Speaker A: And you don't think these five product market fit, use case will be disconnected from each other.
00:36:03.033 - 00:36:03.201, Speaker B: Right.
00:36:03.233 - 00:36:07.925, Speaker A: You think they're going to very well interact with each other on the blockchain.
00:36:08.505 - 00:36:50.537, Speaker B: It feels to me that those are pretty fundamental. Maybe one or two in the DeFi space can be merged with one another. For example, indexes and lending have a lot in common if you look deeply into the primitive. So I believe that they will cooperate, but there will be very five clear winners about those different things. Just because in a decentralized world they don't make so much sense to have two players. Right. Because the whole point of decentralized system is that you can have a monopoly which aggregates everything and hence it super efficient.
00:36:50.537 - 00:37:03.161, Speaker B: But then the problem is of a monopoly's trust. You don't want a monopoly to handle all the world's money. A ladder that is entrusted scope. Right? That's right. So I expect to have at least five major winners in each of those premiums.
00:37:03.313 - 00:37:20.961, Speaker A: That's interesting. Conscious of time. Yeah, you said that you know you were working on something, so I hope you could come back on the podcast and maybe announce it in the future. But where can we follow you on Forecaster, Lance? Twitter, whatever.
00:37:21.153 - 00:37:59.055, Speaker B: Yeah, so Morpho's handle is Morpholabs. So M O R P H O L A V S. Mine is Paul Franvo. So my first name and surname attached together and on I think everywhere like Lens, Forecaster and Twitter. I'm not very active on Lens, but I am more active on Forecaster and Twitter and more phone. Forecaster is just more fun and more phone. So yeah, and yeah, I'm sure we have a bunch of interesting things to share over the likes in the next month or so.
00:37:59.185 - 00:38:00.507, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, too far. Right.
00:38:00.571 - 00:38:00.795, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:38:00.835 - 00:38:09.363, Speaker A: So you can still come back and work 15 minutes exactly in your ex office. Thanks Paul. It was a real pleasure to have you and I hope to see you soon.
00:38:09.459 - 00:38:11.315, Speaker B: Yep, likewise. Thank you very much for having me.
