00:00:00.170 - 00:00:15.722, Speaker A: So I think there are many ways or many forms in which the revenue or the incentives will come. So one. The one thing would be. The first thing would be sequencing revenue. That would be shared with the restakers. Right. So because if you become an ABS for let's say decentralized sequencing.
00:00:15.722 - 00:00:31.094, Speaker A: You would have access to the sequencing revenue. So that's the first thing. The second thing would be we also have our own token. So that will also be used to incentivize people to come and serve the ABs. So that's number two. The third one would be the token that the roll up may have. Right.
00:00:31.094 - 00:00:52.140, Speaker A: So let's say I'm building a gaming roll up. And I'm asking a certain operator to come and serve as a sequencer for my roll up. Then I would have to provide some incentive for them. And so there will be some incentive that comes from the DAP token itself. And then potentially if I can lay T with Jedrus there could be potentially submits that from IgNLA team itself. Right?
