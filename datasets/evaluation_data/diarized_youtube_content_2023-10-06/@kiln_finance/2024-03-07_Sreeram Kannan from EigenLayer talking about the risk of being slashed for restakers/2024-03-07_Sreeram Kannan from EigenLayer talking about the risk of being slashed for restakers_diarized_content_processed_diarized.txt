00:00:00.330 - 00:00:44.434, Speaker A: And as far as you are a staker, the systemic risk is when you're staking into a service and if you don't perform anything malicious, you won't get slashed. That's the staker side. So staker is actually, it's a very different kind of risk. Somebody came up with this example on Twitter. They said it's kind of like you go to a mall, right? You go to a mall and then you have to pay $100 or at, at a store and you promise that you won't steal at the store. Okay? And that's taking. And then you could say instead of paying $100 at the store, you pay $100 at the entrance of the mall and say that I promise I won't steal in any of the 5000 stores here, but still in your control not to steal.
00:00:44.434 - 00:00:54.250, Speaker A: Like, you can just choose not to steal and you'll have your money when you get up. So it's endogenous, this risk. You control the risk. You know, if you're a validator, if you want to stake with, you control the risk.
