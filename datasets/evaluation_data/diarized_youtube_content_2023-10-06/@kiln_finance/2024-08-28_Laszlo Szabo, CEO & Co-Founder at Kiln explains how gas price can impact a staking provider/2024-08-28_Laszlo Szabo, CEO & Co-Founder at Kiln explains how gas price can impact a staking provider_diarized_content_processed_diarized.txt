00:00:00.360 - 00:00:42.279, Speaker A: We have as you mentioned, right. Gases sometimes half, sometimes a little bit less, sometimes more than percentage of the eth rewards sticky rewards. The other part being the constant slayer rewards the more activity on chain higher gas price is better for node operators. At kiln. We also build and deploy a smart contract platform for staking and defi. So we have conflicting interest there. Because when you deploy contract and gas super high, or when you even deploy validator keys on smart contract and gas are super high, you know, definitely not good for a business.
00:00:42.279 - 00:00:58.535, Speaker A: It's a lot of high costs. And it's also terrible for the users. Right. To have like high volatility and high gas price in general. Yeah, I think the markets that can edge and flatten this volatility with makes a lot of sense.
