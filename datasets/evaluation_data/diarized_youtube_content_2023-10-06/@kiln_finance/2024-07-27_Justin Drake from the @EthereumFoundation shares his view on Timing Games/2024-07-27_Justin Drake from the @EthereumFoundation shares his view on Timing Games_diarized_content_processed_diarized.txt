The idea of proposer builder separation was that all the sophisticated, all the sophistication be shunted to the builders. But unfortunately, there's this little loose end where the proposer can be sophisticated in terms of when they call get header from the relay. So basically, when they interact with the relay, and it turns out that if you delay the get header request within some safety bounds, you get more meV, and you only marginally increase the risk of getting reorg. And so the increase in MEV is much greater than the loss of revenue from increased reorgs. And sophisticated operators do that.
