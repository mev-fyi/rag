00:00:04.650 - 00:00:31.640, Speaker A: Thank you everyone for coming to the panel. So once again, thanks again to Tina and vias for showing up from Eigen layer. It's a very interesting solution that has come with a new paradigm shift for re staking in Ethereum. So, wondering if you guys give us a little bit of an understanding as to what exactly are these so called scalability issues of Ethereum and how potentially eigen layer might be a very nice solution towards solving these.
00:00:32.010 - 00:01:21.400, Speaker B: Yeah, first of all, thank you for having us here. Right. We're really happy to be here. So from a scalability standpoint, I think a lot of this stems from Vitalik's approach to how Ethereum needs to scale with smart contract rollups. And Eigen layer itself is an economic security and a validation marketplace for builders primarily. And this actually stems from kind of the bootstrapping problem that a lot of blockchains face in their initial phases, as well as one of Sriram's previous ventures and some of the struggles that they faced in the process of bootstrapping that project. And shout out to Professor Shea, who's in the audience today, who has been instrumental throughout our entire process.
00:01:21.400 - 00:01:42.026, Speaker B: But yeah, Eigen Layer looks to support protocols and projects as they enter the Ethereum ecosystem to bootstrap them and use this economic security from Ethereum restakers and the validation services that node operators in the ecosystem provide. Tina?
00:01:42.218 - 00:02:36.698, Speaker C: Yeah, and going off of Viosa's point, one thing I love about Eigen layer is traditionally, as blockchain design has evolved, what we're seeing is that a lot of the powers of this three sided marketplace is actually becoming a lot more centralized than we had the intention to. And a lot of the design of Eigen layer's architecture is trying to bootstrap decentralization and ensure that operators and validators have a say and the ability to contribute both for the block building process and also in governance. And that we're maintaining decentralization from a sequencing level all the way to a state of finality. So that's why I really love kind of the three sided marketplace that is Eigen layer.
00:02:36.874 - 00:03:17.180, Speaker B: Yeah, we look at Ethereum as this decentralized cloud, essentially. And if bitcoin pioneered decentralized trust, then Ethereum really pioneered decentralized programmability, which is what spawned the DAP revolution phase. And we're trying to really enable this middleware, or what we're calling almost like decentralized SaaS innovation phase, where projects are no longer required to bootstrap their own projects with their own token, necessarily and generally improving the capital efficiency of Ethereum and the overall landscape of what we're working on.
00:03:18.110 - 00:03:56.838, Speaker A: Got you. So this is a platform that we're building on the l two. So Eigen layer right now is able to provide smart contracts for rapid processing, ZK roll ups, for instance. And a lot of this off the shelf readiness also comes in tandem with the fact that we can bring on board ready nodes to process very risky transactions. These projects might also be cross chain. So it's very important. Right, of course, that we are trying to ensure that the main net guarantees are readily transferred to these projects when they're coming on board.
00:03:56.838 - 00:04:04.090, Speaker A: Can you give a bit of an insight as to how that exactly works and what kind of things might actually be involved on the l one side?
00:04:04.240 - 00:04:05.562, Speaker B: Yeah. Do you want to start?
00:04:05.616 - 00:04:05.834, Speaker C: No.
00:04:05.872 - 00:05:08.458, Speaker B: You okay? For sure? Yeah. I would say it's not just restricted to ZK roll ups, where you want to support all types of projects. So whether it's optimistic or zk, the real value prop is for proofs, right? You want to be able to have certain security guarantees that otherwise don't necessarily exist. And in this landscape, we're limited by sometimes the economic security that a project can bootstrap itself with, which is sometimes restricted by its token. And with Ethereum restakers, you're enabling a lot more security guarantees. But then with node operators, they're able to, rather than simply participating in the Ethereum consensus, they're able to opt into additional middlewares or these ZK projects or roll ups that they want to support. And there is some additional complexity there in terms of making sure we're not overloading the Ethereum consensus or the execution layer.
00:05:08.458 - 00:05:43.930, Speaker B: And we're definitely reliant on some of these smart contract roll up projects to focus on improving the computational scaling. But what we're primarily focused on is making sure we can support them from a data availability standpoint, or from an economic security standpoint, or facilitate the interactions required from these node operators or these restakers. And we also have, as Tina mentioned earlier, we want to increase the degrees of freedom that restakers have in terms of delegating to an operator.
00:05:44.910 - 00:06:43.882, Speaker C: Yeah. And one thing is that the current staking market doesn't allow for a lot of customizability for both staking and operating, and it doesn't take into account a lot of the risk exposure that changes based on different staking providers, different staker profiles. You're seeing a lot of the stakers for major blockchains are now becoming these sort of influencers because of the sort of mass that they've been delegated to and what problems occur because of that. And there's a lot of cool innovation that Vios mentioned with opting in and opting out specifically to services for ABS. That is super cool innovation for particularly institutional investors, lps, and a lot of the stakers and operators and validators within Ethereum.
00:06:44.026 - 00:07:47.040, Speaker B: I think Tina touched on two really good points there, which is one, customizability, and two, open innovation. Right. Open innovation is one of our core values that we believe in at eigen layer, and we see ourselves as Ethereum's playground or Ethereum's incubator, where we're not trying to be an l one, we're trying to increase the programmability and the scope of what's possible within the Ethereum ecosystem, and whether that's bringing in in our DA solution, more customizability for ZK rollups, or bringing in certain parallel execution features that some projects like Monad are working on in EVM, and bringing in higher throughput or higher tps that projects like Solana have but are limited in the use cases that we can do on EBM. We want to be able to support those things and bring that within this existing ecosystem that we have with honestly, what's an incredible community.
00:07:48.530 - 00:08:20.554, Speaker A: Gotcha. It's interesting that from the data availability side. So of course we know that data sampling is one of the bottlenecks in a lot of cases where block times on a network are really going to be constricted. I mean, of course if you're able to minimize that, you're going to increase the throughput of the ecosystem. We know that Eigen layer is developing something into this. It's a data availability layer. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of insight into what you're planning for us.
00:08:20.672 - 00:09:20.862, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So we're actually really excited about Eigenda, and it's not necessarily something that's like a side project to us or something. It's actually quite core to what we're working on, because to your point, it's going to improve scalability and throughput, and that's going to enable us to support a lot of new use cases. And some of the architecture there, without going too deep, is using Reed Solomon encoding and building on protodon sharding and some of the existing improvements to the ethereum protocol, or some of the planned improvements to the Ethereum protocol, I should say. But yeah, we want to increase the customizability in terms of signature schemes or what types of proofs that ZK or optimistic rollups might want to use, or whether it's a hybrid model, which some projects are considering using some hybrid model of ZK and optimistic proofs. So we're really excited for that. Yeah.
00:09:20.862 - 00:09:22.638, Speaker B: Tina, do you have anything else to add there?
00:09:22.724 - 00:10:07.182, Speaker C: Yeah, what probably excites me most about the DA product from an outside perspective on the team is probably that the team has a really good understanding of how the attestation schemes and attestation is going to be translated on an interoperability layer. So they work really closely with UMA from sucinct and catalyst and a number of other interoperability teams within the space, and they have a good understanding of. Okay, so we have the CA product. How is specific proving going to translate across multiple different chains? And how can this be consistent on an attestation level or on a state confirmation level? So that's probably from kind of an external viewpoint what I find most interesting too.
00:10:07.316 - 00:10:46.154, Speaker B: Yeah. Adding to that, I think we're also really focused on making sure node bandwidth requirements and how much data each node is storing is minimized. So each node should really only store one nth of the data. It doesn't make sense for everybody to keep storing all the data on the network, which really reduces your throughput abilities and reduces how you can scale. So currently eigenda is on Testnet and we're at ten megabytes per second on Testnet already. And we're trying to go public with that testnet hopefully around late q three, early q four, and then go to main net q four, q one this year.
00:10:46.272 - 00:11:16.454, Speaker A: That's great. In general, what would you say is the outlook for how Eigen layer itself scales? Imagine that once you start being able to streamline a lot of things on the l two, you might be able to look forward to proliferation of validation. When you have something like that, is there something that we need to look into regarding the sustainability or like the improvements of the l one itself in order to sustain that kind of computational load? Or is it something that isn't really the scope at the moment?
00:11:16.652 - 00:13:15.820, Speaker B: Do you want to start? Okay, for sure. I would say, yeah, I want to go back to reiterating that we see ourselves as Ethereum's playground. We see ourselves as a way to incubate projects on Ethereum, and we're trying to increase the scope of the use cases that are possible within the ecosystem. So while we are excited for 4844 and all the additional developments that are happening within the l one improvements, I mentioned a project like Monad, who's trying to do parallel execution on EVM to support HFT high throughput use cases for things that can take advantage of TPS. We also see a necessity for increasing the throughput requirements, because one question that we have within the Eigen DA team sometimes is if we wanted to make a dent in adoption, how would we support the throughput or the traffic demands of web two solutions on web three, where the use cases make sense and will the infrastructure be able to support or even handle something like that to transfer a high throughput application onto web three, if we want to increase the overall adoption of the space, it's important that the infrastructure is there because similar to how cloud in web two enabled a lot of new use cases and abstracted away the infrastructure development for a lot of builders, we want to effectively be similar to cloud infra providers, but for blockchains and abstract away the bootstrapping or the infrastructure required and really enable projects to focus what they're good on, which is innovation. Right? And these builders are coming and they're not looking to be infra builders, they're not looking to build everything themselves. And so a modular ecosystem really needs to support a lot of great infra, which will precede those amazing use cases that we hope builders in the space will come and use eigen for.
00:13:16.750 - 00:14:24.254, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think Vios goes into kind of this open innovation thesis, but right now it's really hard to be an infra builder. Fuel, who's in the audience as well, is a huge advocate of their UTXL model that is great for throughput. I've seen the infrastructure tooling in the space is just not where it needs to be if there needs to be mainstream adoption. And one thing that's really cool specifically about Eigen layer, is that they think about these specific batching cycles and the proving status of the DA product for these custom solutions on kind of what Vios articulated as like a d data availability or software as a service type mindset. And that will help people use these general purpose solutions for all different types of applications and hopefully we'll then see more infrastructure being built.
00:14:24.452 - 00:14:38.600, Speaker A: Got you. Out of curiosity. So how do things look like on the operational side of these smart contracts, especially if we talk about competitors such as Lido, how would you differentiate yourselves from them?
00:14:40.650 - 00:15:08.560, Speaker B: I'm going to let Tina take most of this question, but predominantly we're not doing a staking solution product. We're just supporting as many staked assets that are pretty much eth equivalent through restaking as well as native restaking but there's definitely some cool stuff we're working on in terms of how much freedom these restakers have in terms of when they delegate to an operator, and Tina is actually leading most of that.
00:15:10.130 - 00:16:10.900, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what I find interesting about the current market is that it is really general purpose, which was great to bootstrap staking for Ethereum as whole. But as we want to become more decentralized, there needs to be better solutions to have more customizability for operators, for delegation, specifically for debt validating, for staking and specific withdrawal and deposit periods for, let's say, reward and block reward schedules. There's a lot of cool innovation that the team is thinking about and working on in that respect. And I think that one thing to also consider is like Lido currently has a significant share of the current market cap, and having more innovation on the decentralization of node operators and validators will help Ethereum as a whole stay.
00:16:12.390 - 00:18:03.074, Speaker B: And that's one area where we've kind of developed this thing called Eigen SDK that's focused on a dev kit for some of these middleware and ABS partners. And this goes back to Vitalik's article earlier this year about let's not overload Ethereum consensus. So how do we make sure we have these lightweight abs that are compatible with the weakest infrastructure validator on the Ethereum ecosystem? But then there are plenty of node operators that have additional block space, especially those that are using things like AWS anyways to validate for Ethereum. So how can we support some of these higher block space node operators and generate, I hate using this word, but generate legitimate yield sources, which are these avss or middlewares, and be able to support all this additional block space that they have available, which is what has enabled projects like Solana to have these high TPS numbers and what we hope to enable on Ethereum as well. And Tina mentioned this previously, but batching or there are certain features that we're working on with eigenda like Multicorum support to increase the l one alignment so roll ups can potentially pay fees in their own token and be more aligned to eth l one or reserved bandwidth. We have ten megabytes per second and we want to enable roll ups to reserve certain bandwidth because a lot of roll up gas costs are very congestionary today. And we look at the example of the airline industry, which has fuel pricing contracts that go multiple years ahead of time so they can adjust pricing for their flight fares.
00:18:03.074 - 00:18:18.250, Speaker B: And similarly, we want to create models for roll ups to reserve bandwidth for multiple durations of time ahead of time, so they're not privy to congestionary demand and they're able to operate with fixed costs.
00:18:19.630 - 00:18:37.220, Speaker A: Great. Finally, I suppose apart from what's being worked on right now, what is sort of the, I mean, the vision is very clear, but where do you see Eigenve going on? Just on a personal, kind of heartfelt note in the coming years.
00:18:40.070 - 00:19:59.690, Speaker B: For me, again, I'm grateful to be part of the team from the beginning, and I've definitely bought into the open innovation thesis. Right. We firmly believe that we want to support as many interesting use cases and enable projects to not have to deal with the bootstrapping problem. And this is similar to how venture capital decoupled innovation and capital. Similarly, we want to decouple innovation and bootstrapping in the ethereum ecosystem. So we're really excited for social networks, for whether it's other infra builders, roll ups, defi, and supporting more high throughput defi use cases that are currently moving to other platforms, or even if it's nfts or something that I'm personally passionate about is some of the more creative ventures that we have and excited about potentially some of the streaming landscape that we could do with projects like superfluid or just enable a lot more cool use cases where decentralization really matters. And I think actually Nick from fuel mentioned this yesterday about the use cases don't necessarily dramatically change between web two or web three.
00:19:59.690 - 00:20:13.518, Speaker B: So we need to be very particular about where decentralization matters and how we can increase the industry wide adoption and bring on those projects and those use cases that can really leverage this ecosystem.
00:20:13.694 - 00:20:14.420, Speaker A: Right?
00:20:15.110 - 00:21:29.100, Speaker C: Yeah, I think what I love about the open innovation thesis that our team discusses a lot internally is completely the state of permissionless. So both from stakers, validators, node operators, the end goal being this complete state of permissionlessness where there's no state of signatures or attestations or users are not waiting for any longer time period. And also a lot of the users within this marketplace game are all earning a substantial reward scheme that Vios mentioned and having it sustainable so that the more actors that enter this marketplace are also contributing to the decentralization. So that's honestly what I'm really, really excited by and how I honestly think the ethereum ecosystem can scale as a whole. Because right now we're not seeing that tip of the iceberg yet. And hopefully when it becomes more tangible for infrastructure builders, we'll see that soon.
00:21:29.790 - 00:21:41.690, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you very much. Yeah, I'm sure we can probably open the floor to some questions. Anyone from the audience that would like to ask via Tina about iconlayer.
00:21:44.190 - 00:22:03.010, Speaker D: Mentioned Solana's ripple and the emergent use cases that come from it. What would be kind of like the minimal viable TPS that you think is needed to reach these new emergent use cases you're seeing in these other non EVM networks?
00:22:04.070 - 00:23:11.262, Speaker B: Yeah, we're not necessarily, at least from the Eigen DA standpoint, we're not necessarily looking at it purely from a TPS standpoint, but more so from a bandwidth standpoint, which has a direct correlation, obviously. I think. Yeah, part of our scaling goals is we want to get to like 1gb/second in the next couple of years and hopefully further and further beyond. And that's part of, as I mentioned earlier, each node not storing all the data and only storing one end of the data and being able to using erasure coding to come up with ways where we can still maintain those security guarantees. And from a throughput or TPS standpoint, I've mentioned Monad a couple of times and I promise I'm not showing them, but they're trying to do 10,000 tps on EBM using parallel execution. And we're super excited for projects like that because as I mentioned earlier, we're reliant on the Ethereum ecosystem for computational scaling. We are again Ethereum's playground.
00:23:11.262 - 00:24:00.842, Speaker B: However big Eigen layer gets, it's also simply to increase the size of the Ethereum ecosystem. And what we can do with 10,000 TPS is really up to the builders. It's not necessarily up to us, but it's going to be really exciting to have some more HFT type projects in the space. It's going to be cool to have more interesting order book decks designs. Yeah, really fun stuff, I think. And social networks or on chain gaming. These are things that we want to support for sure, on chain gaming doesn't necessarily have high value per bit, but it's one of those things with the law of large numbers, right? So each state update or each transaction update might not have high value per bit, but over the course of time you can see what the benefits would be for projects like that.
00:24:00.842 - 00:24:22.000, Speaker B: And Alt layer, who's working with us, they spooled up the old game 2048, and they're doing each move in the game. 2048 is a state update on chain using roll ups built on Eigen layer. So projects like that we're super excited about because they're pushing the limits of what's possible in the space.
00:24:23.890 - 00:24:32.130, Speaker D: Right now I understand the focus is on Ethereum, but using stain and taking the future more open to other kind of assets.
00:24:33.910 - 00:25:14.302, Speaker B: Yeah, we at Eigen layer are going to be focused on ethereum predominantly. We do provide some feedback, some advisory roles to other projects that are building restaking on other chains. But from our standpoint, the Ethereum ecosystem is the largest community of builders, developers, node operators and restakers or stake. And some of us are eth Maxis. And we believe that a lot of these roads converge to Ethereum. So while we do support other projects building restaking on other chains, it's not something that we want to actively develop on. Part of it is also just focus theory.
00:25:14.302 - 00:25:27.358, Speaker B: And we believe that trying to do distributed development on multiple chains is just an absolute nightmare for us because it's already difficult in and of itself to execute our existing vision on Ethereum alone.
00:25:27.534 - 00:26:09.380, Speaker C: Yeah, and I think a lot of these chains, you're already seeing them replicating, restaking themselves. So it's on their own delision. And naturally they're going to be expired by a lot of the development that's happening with Eigen layer. You're already seeing this in cosmos specifically. And also the Ethereum ecosystem gets a lot of inspiration from their restaking architecture, a lot of the delegation and node operator experience from other chains, specifically cosmos. So I think you're going to see a lot of inspiration on that front. But Eigen layer is Ethereum native and we're going to be continuing to focus on that.
00:26:12.790 - 00:26:15.220, Speaker D: Do you integrate with DVT? Like.
00:26:18.490 - 00:26:19.826, Speaker B: Sorry, didn't catch.
00:26:19.938 - 00:26:26.040, Speaker D: How is the integration of Alec layer and DBT for distributor validator technology?
00:26:27.870 - 00:27:42.282, Speaker C: Yeah, so we're thinking about the distribution of validators right now. Typically for a lot of the major validators, the distribution is congested to like three primary states, the US, United Kingdom and Russia. I believe as the top leading validator providers, and I think within Ethereum we have 500,000 validators. Other chains like Cosmos predominantly have like 30 to 50 validators. What we're doing in our initial onboarding experience is making sure that the distribution for onboarding is well distributed, both by regional distribution profiles, risk exposure, the type of investor or node operator, and managing the distribution like that. As we move forward in our product development process, we will be working with specific dvd providers in trying to make that experience permissionless. But right now it is a manual onboarding process for ensuring full distribution.
00:27:42.282 - 00:27:46.946, Speaker C: That's kind of also still a lot.
00:27:46.968 - 00:28:30.560, Speaker B: Of the operator experience. The middleware experience is still very much under development. So we're actively working with projects like oball or other DVT solution builders, and we do plan on supporting them. And we're actively vetting our operator design systems by these other solution builders. But similar to how we are reliant on some of these roll up innovations, we're also reliant on some of these DVT builders and their innovations. And it's our responsibility to make sure we're compatible and support them. But it's also our responsibility to make sure there's middlewares or there's projects that can really take advantage of this distributed validator tech.
00:28:31.330 - 00:28:58.780, Speaker C: Yeah, and one thing I wanted to say about DVT is I think a lot of innovation on that front isn't going to come for a while because you're seeing a lot of node operators right now actually operating a cluster of nodes and acting as multiple different node operators. And there's a lot of different edge cases that you have to consider both in the terms of governance and node operator validator experience that hasn't been solved yet or defined for DVT to actually be developed to where we need it to be.
00:29:03.710 - 00:29:30.460, Speaker A: Cool. Well, once again, thank you vias and Tina for telling us all about Eigen layer and the projections for the future. It's really great to have you both, and I hope everyone got a much better understanding as to what we can look forward to. So yeah, I guess that's that for Eigen layer and we're going to start moving on to understanding modularity security paradigms with roll ups and Ethereum. So thank you very much.
