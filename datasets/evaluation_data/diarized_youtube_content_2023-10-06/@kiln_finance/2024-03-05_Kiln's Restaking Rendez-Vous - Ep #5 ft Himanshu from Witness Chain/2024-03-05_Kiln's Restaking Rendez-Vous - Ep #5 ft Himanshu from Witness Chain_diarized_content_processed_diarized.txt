00:00:07.370 - 00:00:30.200, Speaker A: Hey there, and welcome to the latest episode of Kin Rendezvous again. Layer avs edition. I'm Edgar, protocol specialist at Kiln, the leading enterprise grade staking platform. And joining us today, we have Yumen Shu Tiagi, co founder and CTO at Kaleidoscop Blockchain, to discuss the. The exciting AVs, which is witnesschain. Himanshu, how are you today?
00:00:31.130 - 00:00:33.800, Speaker B: Oh, excellent. Excellent. Thanks for having me.
00:00:34.330 - 00:00:48.490, Speaker A: Perfect. So we wanted to start this off by just, like, letting you introduce yourself and kind of give you the opportunity to share your background story and how you ended up working in blockchain.
00:00:49.550 - 00:01:19.362, Speaker B: Yeah. So thank you very much for inviting me. My name is, as I guess said, my name is Himanshutyagi and we are part of this project called Witness Chain. We are a polychain Ethereum funded project and we have been around for a while and we are also an Abs on eigenve kaleidoscope. Blockchain is the name of the company, but we should just be known as witness chain. That's what we all go by now. And a little bit about my background.
00:01:19.362 - 00:01:35.126, Speaker B: I'm a professor at a university in India. I'm a researcher. I've worked in blockchains, AI. I work in cryptography, actually. Cryptography, AI and 5G networks. And how I got into blockchain is interesting. And that's where my co founder comes into picture.
00:01:35.126 - 00:02:22.074, Speaker B: So this company, one of my co founders is Pramod Viswanath, who is also a professor at Princeton University, and he's also blockchain researcher. In fact, Pramod is academic advisor for Shiram, who is the founder of Eigen Layer. So that's also our Eigen layer connection. And my journey into blockchain is quite natural, actually, because I'm a cryptographer by one of my research topics is cryptography. And two years back, at the end of the previous bull market, roughly the previous bull market promote and I were discussing about, we were looking at helium and we had a lot of ideas in building a decentralized 5G network, which is what helium is also doing now. And that's where our journey started. And we thought, we will enter from that side.
00:02:22.074 - 00:02:27.450, Speaker B: We have a lot of ideas on that side. And from that, we are here now building witness chain.
00:02:28.030 - 00:02:46.050, Speaker A: Great, cool. So talking about witness chain, what is the origin story behind witness chain? And where did you start looking at Eigen layer and saying, basically like, yeah, this is a platform we want to build on, right?
00:02:46.200 - 00:03:42.066, Speaker B: So this idea of what we call Watchtower now, right, that has been around for a while in different forms. And even when Vitalik proposed plasma chain, the idea was to have Watchtower and fishermen in polka dots were where whenever you have multiple systems interacting, then you want someone to make sure of the security at the gaps, someone to make sure that this gap is secure, especially in optimistic setups. And this is before this DK Prusa invented. So where you can now have other solutions around it if we can talk about later. So this is one instance, but we started even before that. Our thought process has been, as I said, we started with building the decentralized 5G network. And one of the key component in building a decentralized 5G network, or in fact, any deep in project, is a proof system which measures things and raises an alarm in any blockchain design.
00:03:42.066 - 00:04:11.066, Speaker B: Right? Our consensus layer is very thoroughly designed. It's very secure. But there are some trust gaps left here and there. For example, we all know about social consensus, which is the final trust gap. Even when your consensus fails, there is this very slow, cumbersome layer, and they can fix things. But what about the smaller trust gaps which are left? For example, in the optimistic roll ups, a trust gap is right in the beginning. Who actually raises alarm when something goes wrong? There's a trust gap in the protocol design.
00:04:11.066 - 00:04:35.170, Speaker B: We assume someone will raise it and we assume someone will be incentivized to raise it. But is it really true? Similarly, in deep in projects, who actually measures the location of device? Who actually measures the performance of these devices? These are some trust gaps here and there, which are left in a protocol design. And the broader goal of a watchtower and witnessing watchtower especially, is to fill up test gaps in all blockchain designs.
00:04:36.070 - 00:04:36.578, Speaker A: Nice.
00:04:36.664 - 00:05:06.522, Speaker B: This is where we started. And just to come to the Eigen layer story in this story so far, there is no just raise an alarm and think of the economy around it. So we started building this wash towers for deep in. And we went live actually on some of the other systems, like Filecoin, we integrated with station. But the economy story was not very clear. And that's where Shira, who's also an advisor for the project, had this Eigen layer thing going. And suddenly we realized that these wash towers are not something just external to the economy.
00:05:06.522 - 00:05:27.560, Speaker B: They are the centerpiece of the economy. They are an independent validator pool, which can be used by different projects. Through Eigen layer and different projects, different blockchains can think of them as another extension of their validator pool, which they can use to bootstrap their validator pool as well. And they bring security to them by raising alarm early on for various things.
00:05:29.450 - 00:06:10.960, Speaker A: Great. Yeah. I saw you at that Filecoin ecosystem conference talking about witness chain. So this was also like a question that I was asking myself, like the link with Filecoin. But now I have my answer. So just to zoom out now, I think, at least from reading your docs, I understand that you're building three things, which are the watchtowers, proof of backhaul, which I thought I understood that was linked to proof of location and proof of service. Can you talk a bit about these three verticals and how they interact with each other? If they do?
00:06:11.410 - 00:06:55.586, Speaker B: Okay, so sorry, I don't know which version of the dog, but I'll organize it in a slightly different way. What you talked about are some of the detailed protocols, but at the high level, we are building three categories of wash towers. So the wash tower for roll ups is what is one? Then we are building watchtower for deepen, and then we are building washtower for AI core processes, which is something. In the next few months, you will hear more about it. And we use different proofs to enable these three categories of wash towers. Okay, so maybe wash tower for roll ups is what we have been most talking about in the Eigen layer ecosystem. We can talk about that.
00:06:55.586 - 00:07:10.040, Speaker B: And proof of backhaul and proof of location. Proof of location is also relevant for watchtowers for roll ups, but those are more relevant in wash tower for deepen. And then there'll be watchtowers for AI, which we'll talk about later.
00:07:10.650 - 00:07:11.400, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:07:12.570 - 00:07:13.094, Speaker B: Thank you.
00:07:13.132 - 00:07:27.130, Speaker A: Thank you for the clarity. So perfect. Let's talk now about watchtowers. Like what are watchtowers? And in the context of roll ups. And I think optimistic roll ups. Why is it needed in this context?
00:07:29.230 - 00:07:52.846, Speaker B: Perfect. So optimistic roll ups have actually solved the Ethereum scaling problem. That's one of the things. And there were many solutions suggested early on. Plasma chain, it's different, but it has some ideas of this kind of roll up. And there was a sharding solution suggested for different reasons. Execution level sharding.
00:07:52.846 - 00:08:29.546, Speaker B: We now talk about dank sharding, which is more about some other kind of sharding, but even execution level sharding. All these solutions were being floated around, and I don't know how because I was not there for that long. But I find it somewhat surprising that the winning solution out of all this was roll ups. But now I think there's consensus on this part. People agree that the hyperscaling of Ethereum will happen through roll ups. And the trust layer underneath is very high value, very high value of trust, but slow and cumbersome. But let it be slow and cumbersome, because his job is not to check each and every transaction.
00:08:29.546 - 00:09:07.770, Speaker B: His job is to offer the highest quality of trust. This is the source of the trust for the whole Ethereum network. And then the scaling happens in different ways through things like roll ups. Zk roll up or optimistic roll up. Now, optimistic roll up, I think are the vehicle of hyperscaling much more than zk roll up, because the idea is the north star of any security is why should I be checking each and every transaction? I want to magically check only those transactions which are faulty. But that's a circular argument. How can you do that? You don't know upfront which transactions are faulty.
00:09:07.770 - 00:09:50.246, Speaker B: Oh, this is nice. So you don't know upfront which transactions are faulty. So how can you just check that? So optimistic roll ups are trying to move towards that, and they follow a very simple idea that I'll just bundle a transaction data and put it on the main chain and then anyone can come and check if there's something faulty. And now with the DA, that journey becomes a little bit different and a little bit more complex. But still the rough idea is the same. And then you may ask the question, but why would someone come and check it? And this question, believe it or not, has not been answered in a satisfactory manner. And the way it was answered so far was that it is early stage of rollups.
00:09:50.246 - 00:11:03.374, Speaker B: There are one or two very big rollups like arbitram and optimism and base, which have lot of traffic, lot of interest, lot of RPC node providers, lot of applications who will check for their own thing going wrong. And maybe these companies themselves will deploy someone to check, because they have reputation to protect. Armbitrum is a huge enterprise and it has reputation to protect for which it will do everything it takes to make sure things are not going wrong. But that's not the era we are looking forward to now. Now we are entering an era of many, many roll ups, thousands of roll ups, in fact. Now earlier when I was saying it, people were not believing it, and even the conviction was lagging on my part, I guess that actually every smart contract should become a roll up when their business grows large enough, once they have enough number of transactions, right? So in this world where every kind of service, even the web two service, when they enter the web3 world, they enter as a roll up. In this world, so many small roll ups are there now, we can't rely on this reputation as a source of trust that arbitrum is so big that they will take care of it, they will not lie and they will not cheat and all.
00:11:03.374 - 00:11:19.080, Speaker B: Now there's an issue. Now one has to think of who will check the roll ups, and that's where the wash towers will come in. And their job, and I elaborate more on this, is to check the roll up, check that nothing is going wrong. And if something is going wrong, then raise an allow.
00:11:20.490 - 00:12:22.170, Speaker A: Well, that's really interesting and it makes a lot more sense for me now. So basically what you're saying is this is not a service for big roll ups that we know today. This is something for the thousands of small ones that will pop up in the next years of crypto adoption. And those ones, they don't have big reputation to incentivize checking for TD transactions. So you need to kind of add like an added layer of security. I think that's really interesting and valuable for the space. So is there, for example, do you have maybe an example already? Maybe this is just too early and we haven't seen that in the market right now, but of like a small roll up, a small optimistic roll up that had a faulty transaction gone unnoticed even after the challenge period.
00:12:23.070 - 00:12:43.722, Speaker B: No. So all the exploits happened in the past. This question has layers. Actually, this is where we also started. Right. So where is it that these faulty transactions are sitting typically? So ethereum is, let's say, more than half trillion dollar of value there. But the stake is 34 40 billion.
00:12:43.722 - 00:13:04.514, Speaker B: I didn't check for the last 1530 days. It may have increased. Right. So 40 billion for, let's say 800 billion. Why only 40 billion for 800 billion? Because not all of it is risky asset. If you think about it, what one needs to secure for is the risky part of it. So there is a thumb rule which applies across these roll ups.
00:13:04.514 - 00:13:29.120, Speaker B: We verified a little bit. About 10% of assets are risky and they come from bridges and these kind of things. Transactions done on bridges, very risky. In each role of this, 10% of these transactions will be risky. Typically around bridges. There have been many famous exploits around the bridges that we know of already. Bridges issues we have seen in the past.
00:13:29.120 - 00:13:56.102, Speaker B: But anything where after finality something was wrong, we haven't pinpointed so far. So that is not there. I discussed with the l two beach guys as well, and it's not something that has happened. But the idea is that think of transactions like bridges where these issues were done. So far those bridge exploits were not with roll ups. But that can also happen next, if it can happen with L1, it can happen with roll up as well. Much easier with roll up.
00:13:56.102 - 00:14:34.114, Speaker B: And we are looking at so many interoperability projects now coming up. So many different type of bridges now coming up. All of those are risky assets. That's because security is sort of weak on the bridges. The validators are incentivized here, they're incentivized there. Where is the party? So one key thing to point out this is that the problem to solve for a watchtower is to incentivize them to be doing their job before things go wrong. That's a design problem, right? So we don't have to wait for things to go wrong before we incentivize them to do their work.
00:14:34.114 - 00:15:21.300, Speaker B: And the analogy I use for it is a simple analogy that if you hire a guard in a bank and nothing else, you just hire a guard and then go back. And the easiest strategy, you know that if someone robs a bank, there are very bad implications. The guy would probably be in jail for decades, right? So there's a hard resistance to not rob a bank. So simple strategy for the guard is just to say every night nothing is happening and don't even show up at the job. And if you had a scheme where I will pay the guard only when something goes wrong, like a bounty, and that doesn't work because it will never happen. And so guard will not be incentivized. So what one has to do is to design checks and balances where when nothing is going wrong, the guard is incentivized to do his job.
00:15:21.300 - 00:15:41.580, Speaker B: You maybe go out at night sometime, check if this guy is sitting there or not. But similarly, when we design Watchtower, we have to design approved system and incentive system which keeps them active when nothing is going wrong. Because all said and done, things going wrong will be a rare event. Yet you will have to incentivize the watchtowers all the time.
00:15:44.140 - 00:16:25.284, Speaker A: Perfect. That's all clear for me. Now. Then, I guess my follow up question is, how do you price this service to roll ups? How do you basically tell a roll up and say you need it for this service? Maybe you don't realize it yet. And how do you think the market for this service will evolve? Do you also see like a potential for competition in this space or maybe substitution? How do you think that this will evolve in the context of we have thousands of roll ups, right?
00:16:25.402 - 00:17:13.972, Speaker B: So the value proposition for roll ups for this service, and I'll talk about competition of the similar service is very simple. This is a validator pool for them, an independent validator pool for them. So when a roll up as a service provider comes and sets up your roll up, they give you typically a centralized sequence, and that's your single validator right now. Okay? But any roll up who wants to launch a token, they want their community to stake that token and they want that community to, in return, give them some security. Now think of even l three like orbit chains building on arbitra. What do their validators do? Their validators are Watchtower. There's an independent pool of watchtowers, validators, which is actually somewhat of a shared pool, but it comes for them.
00:17:13.972 - 00:17:58.230, Speaker B: Let's say they assign five watchtowers and they can stake for them, right? And these roll ups can give them rewards for watching service, and that gives them security. So this is an independent pool of validators for roll ups. That's the value proposition for them. And they are incentivized through various methods, like, let's say. So we are very keen, we are keenly looking at this dual staking coming on eigen layer now, right? Because that gives the best of both worlds. It comes with Ethereum trust for restaking, and these roll ups can also stake on them and incentivize them in their own token. Our contracts will allow these guys to decide how much weightage they want to put on each type of stake here.
00:17:58.230 - 00:18:06.070, Speaker B: But that's the view here for the roll ups, that these are your independent pool of validators. Use it to bootstrap your validator community.
00:18:08.860 - 00:18:53.204, Speaker A: Yeah, but my question is more around, I completely understand that it's very valuable, but my question, because this podcast is really targeted towards an audience of risk takers and the risk, they are very interested in knowing what type of rewards they will be getting. So they'll be very interested to understand, for example, the value of this service. How does it compare to, for example, a network of decentralized sequencers? If you could give us an idea of this, that would be great.
00:18:53.402 - 00:19:25.740, Speaker B: No, actually it's very similar. So, in fact, if you are running a decentralized sequencer, that's also an independent pool of validators, and a roll up would end up having some watchtower, some decentralized sequences. It's a very similar value proposition. So when one sets up a roll up, they will have different kind of validators. Shared sequences are one kind of it. Watchtowers are another kind of. And in fact, if both are doing a shared sequencer node, then it makes much more sense to do a watchtower because the additional overhead is very small, it's very minimal.
00:19:25.740 - 00:20:03.448, Speaker B: And now that roll up which incentivizes this watch towers, and this, the way we see it is that these roll ups will announce rewards for their validators, for staking their own tokens as well as these take ETH, they should announce yield on both of them. And that's what I think you're also looking at from this. Shared sequences will probably also go to the same model. And that's what we are looking at. We are not thinking of it as a service for which you take gas fees. That's not how the rewards are coming. We are thinking of it as actually a validator pool for these rollers and a pool part of their tokenomics.
00:20:03.448 - 00:20:39.364, Speaker B: This is the community which provides security, core security, to the roll up. And by default, roll ups go with one sequencer. But that doesn't make them secure enough for higher economic value transactions to go through, because actually I can't just trust sequencer of a small roll up somewhere in the middle of the world. Now they get these other things as well. Shared sequencer helps them with other things, shared sequencers help them with keeping the price down. And the security of shared sequencer can also be bootstrapped with Eigen layer. Similarly, Watchtower helps the same thing.
00:20:39.364 - 00:20:49.610, Speaker B: So they can decide a composition where they will have two nodes for shared sequences and three watchtowers. And this constitute their initial validator pool. And they get staked on it.
00:20:50.700 - 00:21:11.810, Speaker A: Clear. And so if I understand correctly, the main source of revenue that recycles will take, that the service will earn, basically will be. It's mainly targeted towards a wall of token. Right. You said it would be a core part of the.
00:21:14.100 - 00:21:16.028, Speaker B: Funniest in this. Funniest.
00:21:16.204 - 00:21:38.744, Speaker A: Okay. And could you share maybe like I know that you're in testnet at the moment and Ken will be live on testnet very soon. Could you share maybe a timeline for Mainnet? And do you know approximately when you expect witness chain to launch related to the Avs? Main net?
00:21:38.942 - 00:22:11.590, Speaker B: Yeah, mid April 2 week of April is our main net launch timeline. This main net has multiple parts. We're trying a few things here, but the first version of Mainnet goes live on Ethereum on 15th April. And then there are other versions around orbit chains and all. So that's first part of the timeline. Then around June, we also go out with this deep in wash towers first version of. And so that way we have a timeline and by the end of this year, a lot of action would have happened.
00:22:12.760 - 00:22:13.604, Speaker A: Great.
00:22:13.802 - 00:22:15.540, Speaker B: First main net, 15th April.
00:22:16.040 - 00:22:25.210, Speaker A: Okay. And do you already know. Could you already share names of the wall ups that will be secured when Mainet goes live?
00:22:26.540 - 00:22:33.630, Speaker B: No. So that's something. Work in progress. So we will share it at the, we'll beat some drums around it and share it.
00:22:34.800 - 00:22:46.320, Speaker A: Perfect. But do you have maybe an idea around the numbers of roll ups? Are you targeting a main net with zero to five or maybe bigger?
00:22:46.900 - 00:23:05.364, Speaker B: Yeah. So zero to five roll ups which are all standalone then we are also targeting larger ecosystem l three, for example, we are targeting orbit chain and we want to make a service off the shelf available service for orbit chain and that's also a target we are trying to work out. We work closely with arbitrary for this.
00:23:05.562 - 00:23:06.310, Speaker A: Great.
00:23:06.840 - 00:23:50.996, Speaker B: So you understand that there's a technical thing about that. When we watch orbit chain, those contracts have to sit on arbitra and versus when you watch optimistic rollups which are op stat roll up directly with Ethereum, that contract can sit on Ethereum. So there are these technical things which have our design addresses this already, but these are the things that makes it a timeline which slowly evolves. So the first version of Mainnet will be just the Ethereum contract. And the kind of roll ups we are targeting would be first, the first class of roll ups. This five roll ups that I'm talking about are roll ups that have l one as their source of trust and then this l three type of things which should technically not be called roll up. But I think roll up is more also of a brand name now rather than just a very specific technology.
00:23:50.996 - 00:24:06.490, Speaker B: And I like it that way. Actually, that's how it should be, because anyway, ethereum has too many terminologies now. So this L three orbit chains which are also roll up, in my head they are a huge pool and we are looking forward to integrating those. Also.
00:24:08.700 - 00:24:48.900, Speaker A: I agree with you that we've seen a lot of jargon inflation recently in the blockchain space. Thank you for your answer. And I think it's a great segue into my next answer, which is that can you talk a bit about the way you've designed your Avs and from the point of view of operators, do you think this would be like a light or heavy infra and maybe, I'm sure it would be light at the beginning, but do you see maybe a future where there's so many roll ups, so many different roll up stacks that this could get heavy?
00:24:50.620 - 00:25:23.040, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So to begin with, you have to watch a roll up, which means you have to be able to follow its state, right. And so if an operator has access to a trusted full node for L1 and L two, which they are watching, they can trust it, they are ready to stake or something. Then it's very light. It's a very light service. Our own client is very light. And if you don't have trusted, if you want to maintain your own, then that cost adds up.
00:25:23.040 - 00:25:52.024, Speaker B: There is nothing around actually being able to execute and follow the state. So that costs remain. But most of the time what we are seeing is that many operators anyway are running these full nodes for this larger roll ups. And so the cost is not very high. That's first part of the answer. Now the second part is what happens as the number of roll ups grow, right? And that's the part that we are designing in our engineering. There are two models and this is something we will learn from the market.
00:25:52.024 - 00:26:30.280, Speaker B: One is we allow the operators to watch as many roll ups as they want because it's all independent economy for them. And as long as they can host it and watch it, it's fine. Second is, but this will make it a little bit cumbersome because they have decided to run five full nodes or six full nodes and get some access to it for the smaller roll ups, which are tighter full nodes. Alternatively, we have a rotating architecture which we are coming where we rotate from one roll up to another. What we are learning from the market right now, we have about 15 operators. We are interacting with operator groups with more nodes. So what we learn from them is that they don't want to be rotated.
00:26:30.280 - 00:27:10.812, Speaker B: They want to watch some specific roll ups where more action will happen. So that's something we need to learn from the market. Whether people would be willing to commit to this pooled security and submit to rotation. So there's a trade off here. Security is higher if I rotate you, because then you can't develop a long relationship with a roll up and you move to the next one soon, every epoch. But at the same time, the economic opportunity of securing the bridges, et cetera, are higher for some roll ups than other. And you would like to rather watch those roll ups.
00:27:10.812 - 00:27:38.376, Speaker B: So there's a trade off we are still figuring out. For now. Our design is very simple, that in the first phase you get to watch whichever roll up you want to watch. And one thing I did not talk about, and this will also clarify a small part, I spoke about how roll ups will incentivize tokenomics. But what we are also seeing and what we're also building is what we call transaction tracer APIs. These are more like signed RPC servers. These are basically bridges, et cetera, which are built on the roll ups.
00:27:38.376 - 00:28:16.040, Speaker B: They want quick finality solution and they can send a request to Watchtower which is anyway watching to give a proof of inclusion and things like that. And there's an optimistic thing where the proof is given quickly and disputes are resolved later. So this basically is another economic opportunity. And based on this, some operators were choose to rest it to larger roll ups and not just being rotated around, but this is a little bit up in the air. But otherwise we feel that if you are already running full nodes for l one and l two, then the overhead is very low for this Avs.
00:28:20.330 - 00:28:51.780, Speaker A: That's clear. Thank you. Do you think that we'll see a future where witness chain is many, many different types, different roll ups. You already shared with us that there's different types of services that you'll be provided to different types of people. So I can at least see that there will be a different AVs type for roll ups and different AVs type for deep in, for example.
00:28:52.310 - 00:28:53.060, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:28:53.670 - 00:29:02.280, Speaker A: KK, can you share maybe how many AVs does that scale into in the long run?
00:29:03.130 - 00:29:16.326, Speaker B: Perfect. Just a bit of history on this. Right. So we believe we are sort of an innovation team mostly. So we come from that academic background. And so watching each of this state, right. Requires some innovation.
00:29:16.326 - 00:29:38.926, Speaker B: So, for example, for us to be able to, in a trust free, decentralized manner, being able to measure location, it's a cool protocol that we developed. Similarly, we have a decentralized speed test. This requires innovation. So we keep on innovating for all the trust gaps at different blockchains. Deepen chain is a big ecosystem. AI is just coming up. Cobra stuff for AI will be a really big thing.
00:29:38.926 - 00:30:02.370, Speaker B: We are bullish on that. Then all these trust gaps will be there. One has to. So all those things require a watchtower equivalent. So we think of Watchtower as this first line of defense for all blockchains. And the idea is that wherever there's a trust gap, we innovate and fill that trust gap and offer that service. So currently we see these three different categories deep in AI and most urgently now, roll ups.
00:30:02.370 - 00:30:40.626, Speaker B: That's happening first. But we don't fragment the Watchtower pool and we don't fragment that Watchtower community because they are all tied through witness chain token, which shows how they have served, what's their value, that they have brought at a trust provider along different domains. So that's how we see it happening. So you today are watching roll ups, tomorrow you want to watch deepen as an abs, the same tokens can be used for staking there. Right. And that shows that. What's your reputation? So we are right now talking about Ethereum source of trust, but similarly, we will have our own thing, right.
00:30:40.626 - 00:31:09.660, Speaker B: That you have provided Watchtower service for these things and there has been no issue there. So that also goes across. It just fills a trust gap in different domains like that and you can provide insurance and those kind of things over it across these different blockchains. That's how we see it. That's why I said it is an independent validator pool which different types of chain will interact with, and it fills the trust gap wherever there is.
00:31:11.470 - 00:31:51.370, Speaker A: Great. Really interesting. I had a question also out, what was your vision for deep in the future and how we could make deep in infrastructure more efficient? And I think what you're building, what you're describing right now, is something that, at least to me, makes a lot of sense. But maybe you could remind the audience what is deep in and what is the vision basically of deepin and how also watchtowers can greatly help this variable.
00:31:52.910 - 00:32:22.654, Speaker B: Yeah. So deep in is a very exciting space because this is the time where blockchains interact with the physical world and actually quite a bit with web two services of special kind, even where Web two itself has failed that kind of service. So deepen is very good. The communities in deepen are very loyal, very invested. This is true participation in hard brick and mortar business. That's what I found. And that's something very remarkable.
00:32:22.654 - 00:33:01.806, Speaker B: I'm a big fan of helium project, for example. Super remarkable. The kind of community they were able to build and how they were able to incentivize their community to be able to host these radios. Right? And just for context, this kind of wireless ISPs, Wisp, so called wisp, have been tried for decades. And mostly they run on tight government grants and then grants run dry and then they go back, basically very hard business. Nothing comes out of it. For the first time, helium proved a sustainable business model in that space, in a space which was in the social sector and nothing was happening.
00:33:01.806 - 00:33:35.910, Speaker B: Someone goes and sets up five base stations in Africa, very common to do that. And then, okay, you show interest for a year while you are there, then you go back and there's nothing going on after that. Who brings in that money? Helium showed that this can be a sustainable business model through proper tokenomics and through proper participative economy rather than top down. So that really is fascinating for me. Now, this is the good part. The issue with deepen is that to begin with, the people who are building deepen, their job is to build those equipment, those services. That's a very heavy piece of engineering.
00:33:35.910 - 00:34:04.758, Speaker B: And then blockchain is this whole other thing. And as it does this whole other thing, so it becomes very hard to do all those things. Right. So our vision of deepen is that one needs to have a common deepen chain, a common deepen platform. Few of those, just like we have a trust layer of Ethereum. Similarly, we need to have a sort of a substrate for deep. And all these different projects are different chains on it, but they share a common proof system.
00:34:04.758 - 00:34:43.314, Speaker B: They share some common security coming through watchtowers, and they share some common simple tokenomics. Helium has given one example of it. Yeah. So deep in is a very exciting space because this is the time where blockchains interact with the physical world and actually quite a bit with web two services of special kind, even where web two itself has failed that kind of service. So deepen is very good. The communities in deepen are very loyal, very invested. This is true participation in hard brick and mortar business.
00:34:43.314 - 00:35:15.274, Speaker B: That's what I found. And that's something very remarkable. I'm a big fan of helium project, for example. Super remarkable. The kind of community they were able to build and how they were able to incentivize their community to be able to host these radios. Right? And just for context, this kind of wireless ISPs, WISp, so called WIsp, have been tried for decades. And mostly they're done on tight government grants and then grants run dry and then they go back, basically, very hard business, I think, comes out of it for the first time.
00:35:15.274 - 00:35:58.870, Speaker B: Helium proved a sustainable business model in that space, in a space which was in the social sector and nothing was happening, someone goes and sets up five base stations in Africa, very common, to do that. And then, okay, you show interest for a year while you are there, then you go back and there's nothing going on after that. Who brings in that money? Helium showed that this can be a sustainable business model through proper tokenomics and through proper participative economy rather than top down. So that nearly is fascinating for me. Now, this is the good part. The issue with deepen is that to begin with, the people who are building deepen, their job is to build those equipment, those services. That's a very heavy piece of engineering.
00:35:58.870 - 00:36:50.474, Speaker B: And then blockchain is this whole other thing. And as it does this whole other thing, so it becomes very hard to do all those things right. So our vision of deepen is that one needs to have a common deepen chain, a common deepen platform. Few of those, just like we have a trust layer of Ethereum. Similarly, we need to have a sort of a substrate for deep. And all these different projects are different chains on it, but they share a common proof system, they share some common security coming through watchtowers and they share some common simple tokenomics. Helium has given one example of it through their dow and subdoub structure, but that's too restrictive in the sense, okay, this is the part about helium which can be improved, too restrictive because it completely governs how the tokenomics must be done by them.
00:36:50.474 - 00:37:32.626, Speaker B: And the value accrues mostly in the helium token. And what is needed is an independent equivalent version which is more ethereum type. So helium is on Solana, this is the Ethereum version of it, which is equally decentralized and which is tokenomics is more free. And the proof system, and this is where the watchtower comes in. Washtower comes in as some nodes which run the common proof system for that deep in chains. Now, all deep in chains may not have common proof system, a lot of innovation is needed. But there are some common elements, like location is a common element, the kind of Internet connection that they got is a common element for provisioning as witness chain.
00:37:32.626 - 00:38:28.266, Speaker B: What we have been doing is we have been trying to identify these common elements which can support many, many deep in projects, rather than running after specific things which will be relevant for those projects anyway. So helium has its own proof of coverage, which is the wireless proof of coverage that's relevant for Lora networks. But position of the location of this device as measured by Internet delays is relevant for helium as well as let's say demo, which is a project on polygon. It's relevant for multiple such projects of different shape and sizes. So that's what we are looking at. And that's the kind of deep in ecosystem we envision where all deepens are chains sharing a common proof system and sharing some common framework for tokenomics which make their own job, like through their dow and subdoub structure. But that's too restrictive in the sense, okay, this is the part about helium which can be improved, too restrictive because it completely governs how the tokenomics must be done by them.
00:38:28.266 - 00:38:59.346, Speaker B: And the value accrues mostly in the helium token. And what is needed is an independent equivalent version which is more Ethereum type. So helium is on Solana, this is the ethereum version of it, which is equally decentralized and which is tokenomics is more free. And the proof system and this is where the watchtower comes in. Wash tower comes in as some nodes which run the common proof system for that deep in chains. Now, all deep in chains may not have common proof system. A lot of innovation is needed.
00:38:59.346 - 00:39:55.000, Speaker B: But there are some common elements, like location is a common element, the kind of Internet connection that they got is a common element for provisioning as witness chain. What we have been doing is we have been trying to identify these common elements which can support many, many deep in projects, rather than running after specific things which will be relevant for those projects anyway. So helium has its own proof of coverage, which is the wireless proof of coverage that's relevant for Lora networks. But position of this, the location of this device as measured by Internet delays is relevant for helium as well as, let's say, demo, which is a project on Polygon. It's relevant for multiple such projects of different shape and sizes. So that's what we are looking at, and that's the kind of deepen ecosystem we envision where all deepens are chains sharing a common proof system and sharing some common framework for tokenomics which make their own job light.
00:39:57.850 - 00:40:09.158, Speaker A: Do you think we could see also a future of where deep in chains are not chains anymore, but they are wallops? Or is that just too far fetched?
00:40:09.254 - 00:40:36.770, Speaker B: No, this is happening for sure going to happen. So we work with a project which is trying to do that, and there are many projects which are thinking of it this way. As I said, one must realize that debits are deep in chain, which will work. Then their main focus will be on their engineering. They have to get their devices to work. That's a very heavy piece of engineering. And they are all looking for lightweight blockchain setup where the economy can be bootstrapped quickly.
00:40:36.770 - 00:40:56.322, Speaker B: And they don't want to be involved in Dow and keeping the ecosystem up and all that. And these decentralized trust. Maintaining decentralized trust is a full time thing. So they would like to rely on other proof systems for that. That's what we are learning and that's what we are trying to enable. And as you can guess, this is not something which witness chain can do alone. It requires a roll up ecosystem.
00:40:56.322 - 00:41:07.020, Speaker B: It requires some coordinating chain. So we are trying to, I mean, there is some good progress here, and we are trying to enable that kind of ecosystem where all deepen chains are roll up of their own.
00:41:08.930 - 00:41:31.074, Speaker A: Great. Okay, so let's ask a question to zoom out a little bit out of, for example, roll ups and deep in, for example, and the different types of verticals you are servicing. What do you think will be the first one to see great adoption for now?
00:41:31.112 - 00:42:10.160, Speaker B: Roll up? I think the foremost, that's why we are prioritizing that roll up time is now happening today. I don't know what maybe, I would love to hear your thoughts on it, but there are many things happening in this particular. So I think we are starting a bull run and many things are happening right now. I think this is all modular is a major narrative right now. And I mean, we built during the bear market and now something is being tested and that narrative is coming to the forefront in various ways also about how to economics around modular ecosystem work. That's very interesting. It's very different from what people thought about how value gets approved and all that.
00:42:10.160 - 00:42:28.886, Speaker B: So we feel that roll up is the foremost one. It's happening now. It's just started and will continue. So there are a lot of roll ups on Testnet for orbit chain. There are a lot of roll up for testnet on op. They're on testnet, not on main net right now, but a lot like, I think there are close to 100 overall new roll ups. Right.
00:42:28.886 - 00:42:57.278, Speaker B: So that's a big number. So if I would have said there were thousands of roll up, people would have not believed seven months back. But already there are hundred of testnet. So this thousand roll up is not a big pending actually. And in fact it will be many, many thousands. So we are bullish on the roll up part because we see how that economy works, we see how the doers taking works, we see how communities are quickly built around those kind of things. Cosmos, similar thing is happening.
00:42:57.278 - 00:43:22.610, Speaker B: Cosmos chain are so exciting for similar reasons. Same thing can come to Ethereum through roll ups. And that's something very exciting and we are looking forward to that. So roll up is the foremost one and next one is deepen. And third one because technology is building so far, we don't have the appropriate proof system figured out completely is AI. But that's the third one. But maybe in a year everything will be just about AI.
00:43:22.770 - 00:43:27.526, Speaker A: Yeah, it seems like AI can go faster than we can imagine because you're.
00:43:27.558 - 00:43:33.286, Speaker B: Pouring the kerosene of funding on it. Yeah, it's going fast. That helps.
00:43:33.318 - 00:44:06.120, Speaker A: Definitely. Perfect. Actually, you talked a bit about, for example, the cosmos chain, and I think it's a great segue into my next question, which is for the future of wallops and the future of witness chain. Do you envision, do you see also interest and quality into other wallop ecosystem? Are you mainly focused on Ethereum right now? How do you see the competition for wall ups at the L1 stage? Basically.
00:44:07.370 - 00:44:42.480, Speaker B: That's a great question. So we are currently aligned completely with Ethereum, but you know that we were on filecoin, so that started was there, I think in the future. In fact, the future depends on these systems becoming more interactive, these boundaries blurring a little bit more. It already happens, right. If you see our design, even for rotation, we borrow a lot from Polkadot. Beautiful design. Who wouldn't? We are already borrowing technology where we see.
00:44:42.480 - 00:45:27.514, Speaker B: So if we are open about borrowing technology, I think it's like cross border trade economies thrive in cross border trade. And I feel that that will happen. That is happening and will happen. And I feel that watchtowers will have an important role to play in that because they can be common neutral party across those things. And this is something I think Eigen Layer's vision is also aligned with this. Eigen layer also wants to become this. I shouldn't speak for Eigen layer, but it looks like it's definitely appropriate for becoming a bridge between trust for different chains, because these are trust holders, but they are a little bit more programmable and detached from the core consensus protocol.
00:45:27.514 - 00:46:00.554, Speaker B: So they can do many things which can extend the trust to different chains. For example, I think this project, like polymer, which is borrowing from cosmos ecosystem and getting things here, those projects are coming in some form or the other. Since they can handle technologies of the two chains. That means they can also handle interaction between the chains. So I think it is bound to happen whether it happens in this year or next year or the next bull cycle. That part I don't think I have good insight about that. Bound to happen sooner than later.
00:46:00.554 - 00:46:02.460, Speaker B: Sooner than later is what I would say.
00:46:02.910 - 00:46:11.230, Speaker A: Great. So we can definitely expect in the future to see some watchtowers also for cross chain applications.
00:46:11.810 - 00:46:24.580, Speaker B: Absolutely. Cross chain is where watchtowers will thrive. Because this is the place where there's no where is the incentive in cross chain watching. Right. So this is a great place for neutral parties to watch.
00:46:26.710 - 00:46:32.946, Speaker A: Great. Yeah. So basically, when there is a gap in trust, there is a need for watchtowers.
00:46:33.138 - 00:46:35.830, Speaker B: Absolutely. I should make it a tagline.
00:46:36.490 - 00:46:36.998, Speaker A: Okay.
00:46:37.084 - 00:46:39.640, Speaker B: I'll print the t shirt on it. Okay. For sure.
00:46:42.330 - 00:47:01.550, Speaker A: Send me one. I'll wear it at the office for sure. Perfect. Just being conscious of time, of your time especially. I think we'll wrap this up. Where can we send the audience to learn more about witness chain? Maybe follow you on X or Twitter.
00:47:02.130 - 00:47:23.350, Speaker B: Yeah. So we are at witness chain on X, and we are also witnesschain.com. The website is getting revamped before eat Denver. It will be up and running and just a quick plugin. If you're coming for eat Denver and you want to talk about anything related to roll up, just drop a line. We'll be all there and would love to interact.
00:47:24.090 - 00:47:28.150, Speaker A: I'll be there at Denver and I'll definitely join.
00:47:28.730 - 00:47:30.040, Speaker B: Perfect. Perfect.
00:47:31.130 - 00:47:56.970, Speaker A: Well, him and Chu, thank you so much for your time. We love to have you on the podcast. And we would love to have you maybe again when the Avs mainnet is live and you can tell us much more about the warlabs that will be joining witness chain. But for now, we thank you so much and to the audience. Stay tuned for the next episode.
00:47:58.070 - 00:47:59.920, Speaker B: Thank you very much. Great pleasure. Thanks.
