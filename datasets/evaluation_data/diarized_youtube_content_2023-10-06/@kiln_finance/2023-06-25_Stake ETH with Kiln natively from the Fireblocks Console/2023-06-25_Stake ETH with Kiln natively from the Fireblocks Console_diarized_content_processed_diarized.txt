00:00:00.330 - 00:00:55.374, Speaker A: In this video I'm going to go through staking Ethereum natively from the fireblocks console. So you can see here I'm in the console on the staking tab. I can choose to create a new stake position for ETH now as well as Solana. I will choose the vault that I want to stake from, which is here I have just over 32 e, so that's the amount I'm going to stake for one validator. I pick kiln as the validator, confirm the terms and conditions, and then I can hit stake. Just before I do that, I want to call out that you will want to set up your transaction authorization policy to enable this. And there's an article that we're going to link in the description of the video that explains how to do that.
00:00:55.374 - 00:01:01.642, Speaker A: It's now very easy to do using the tap editor in the console. So once you've set up your tap.
00:01:01.706 - 00:01:03.246, Speaker B: And you can go through these steps.
00:01:03.358 - 00:01:18.710, Speaker A: And just go ahead and hit take, this is going to create a new transaction as all other transactions, it will go through the approval settings of my workspace.
00:01:20.170 - 00:01:27.714, Speaker B: If I click through to the transaction information, I can see the specific validator address that is being funded.
00:01:27.762 - 00:01:27.926, Speaker A: Right?
00:01:27.948 - 00:02:16.018, Speaker B: So this is a new validator that's been spun up automatically on the kiln infrastructure. And I can see that this is actually a deposit transaction into the official beacon chain deposit contract, which I previously whitelisted. There's the usual approval flow as with any transaction that you will see in your mobile app. And once the transaction is approved, you will see that it gets broadcasted. And going back to the staking tab, you'll see that the validator you've funded appears on the Ethereum tab of the staking interface. And you can see the specific status that it's in. And initially it's going to be activating.
00:02:16.018 - 00:02:28.690, Speaker B: Right. And there's typically an entry queue for the Vader to become active. So that's it. That was a little run through of how easy it now is to stake EtH natively from the Firefox console.
