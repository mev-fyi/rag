00:00:00.240 - 00:00:57.690, Speaker A: Eigen layer has this value prop of let's build in ethereum native protocols. Let's share security, because it's very unclear, as I mentioned, how much security a project needs. The value per bit helps us determine that metric, because again, if it's Gamefi compared to DeFi, well, the security concerns are completely different, right? A bridge is likely going to need way more security than a gaming roll up, because the bridge is far more susceptible to attacks and far more susceptible to just misbehavior, whereas the gaming roll up doesn't necessarily have a lot of embedded value in each transaction. So maybe their security concerns are different. But the interesting part is these applications sharing security helps reduce the overall cost for everyone in the system. So now shared security becomes like a cost efficiency dimension as well.
