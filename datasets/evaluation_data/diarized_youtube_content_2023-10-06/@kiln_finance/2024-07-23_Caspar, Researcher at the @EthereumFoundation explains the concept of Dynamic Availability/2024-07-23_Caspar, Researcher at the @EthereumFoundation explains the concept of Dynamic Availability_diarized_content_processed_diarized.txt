00:00:00.400 - 00:00:54.620, Speaker A: This liveness flavoring touch is like, the available chain keeps growing anyhow, and then if the chain stops finalizing, you kind of want to also be able to recover from that, instead of just hoping that at some point, all validators come back online so that you can finalize again. And the way you do it is that this kind of inactivity leak kicks in wherever I. The offline participants basically lose stake over time, as basically, if the chain doesn't finalize, this switch goes on where, hey, inactivity leak is active. And now everyone that's not showing up for their duties gets penalized extra harshly so that you kind of relatively quickly get to a point where the online participants control more than two thirds again, and then you're back to finalizing the chain.
