00:00:07.200 - 00:00:16.609, Speaker A: Hello everyone and welcome to the first episode of the Kilmondevous Bitcoin staking edition. Today we have David Z, co founder at Babylon Today. David, how are you doing today?
00:00:16.777 - 00:00:20.725, Speaker B: Very good. Very nice meeting you, aleca. And thanks so much for having me on this program.
00:00:21.505 - 00:00:41.685, Speaker A: Yeah, it's our pleasure to have you on. You're the biggest BK staking protocol. You recently reached a huge milestone. 23, almost 24,000 BTC, like $1.7 billion staked in a matter of hours. So it's a huge milestone. How do you feel about this?
00:00:41.985 - 00:01:04.225, Speaker B: Yeah, very good. So yeah, that was the cap two of our phase one launch. We got 23,000 on cap two combined with the 1,000 bitcoin cap one. That brings us to lovely 24,000 bitcoin within one and a half hours. So we really appreciate all the support from many, many players in the field.
00:01:05.805 - 00:01:29.235, Speaker A: Yeah, super impressive. We'll talk a bit more about cap raises and phases later on, but I want to start this off by talking a bit about yourself. I would love for you to introduce yourself, tell us a bit like how you started to, to get interested in the world of blockchain and how you decided to build and start Babylon.
00:01:29.575 - 00:01:57.145, Speaker B: Right, yeah. So I started doing research in the blockchain space about six years ago. It was around 2018 timeframe. But I've been a researcher all my career. Early in my career my research was focused on wireless communication. So a bunch of my technology protocols went into 3G and then 4G and 5G cellular technology. So that was my research in wireless infrastructure.
00:01:57.145 - 00:03:00.795, Speaker B: So I've always been interested in doing research at the foundational level of infrastructure. And as you know, impact of research at a foundational level is highest when the technology is in the early stage of development. So for example, about 20 years ago when I started doing research in wireless communication, that was the early days of wireless, wireless data. So in some sense, after 15 years of doing research in the wireless space, I was looking for a new direction, a new infrastructure. And I found this idea of bitcoin, this idea of blockchains, decentralized infrastructure, really fascinating. And so I decided to pivot my entire research group at Stanford to focus on this direction of doing infrastructure level research, focusing on things like consensus protocols, RO app scalability solutions, shared security. And these are all my research topics at Stanford, where my research group is.
00:03:00.795 - 00:03:50.495, Speaker B: And so after doing this research for many years in blockchain, and then I realized that if I want to make a real world impact, I should convert all these learnings that we had in research into really a product that people will use. And so that's how we started this idea of Babylon. Babylon is really sort of a combination of our research interest both in Bitcoin and also improve of stake protocol. So in some sense Babylon merchants or marry the two worlds together, taking bitcoin security and use it to secure proof of stake networks. And the protocol we're most excited about, that we're actively working on right now, building, is bitcoin staking, and that's how we got here. Bitcoin staking is a way of sharing bitcoin security with proof of stake ecosystems.
00:03:52.235 - 00:04:12.335, Speaker A: Yeah, that's definitely something that Atkin we find absolutely fascinating. We're very used to operate on proof of stake blockchains, the traditional ones, ethereum and so on. What made you pick bitcoin? What is the problem statement that you wanted to solve by enabling bitcoin staking on Babylon?
00:04:12.675 - 00:05:03.343, Speaker B: Yeah, so I should say that research is a winding path. Doing startup is also a winding path. In fact, we had come up with several different protocols of sharing secure bitcoin. But our first major thesis of why we start Babylon is the idea that bitcoin is the longest lasting and most secure blockchain in the entire crypto ecosystem. And we want to leverage that security to the benefit of the rest of the ecosystem. Observing that bitcoin as a chain, as an asset, has been quite isolated from the rest of the ecosystem and we want to bring the two closer together. And so we came up with multiple different security sharing protocol.
00:05:03.343 - 00:05:09.435, Speaker B: But after a few iteration, I think we came up with a pretty good one, which is bitcoin staking. So that's sort of the evolution.
00:05:11.455 - 00:05:37.315, Speaker A: Got it. I would love to go a bit deeper into how it works on the technical side, how you make bitcoin stakeable. I know that one key piece is that on Babylon, bitcoin is stickable from the bitcoin layer one. So you're not bridging your bitcoin outside of the layer one. You're not putting it. It's not an IOU on the Babylon chain. You're sticking from the layer one.
00:05:37.315 - 00:05:52.625, Speaker A: I would love for you to explain how you make the bitcoin stickable and especially like how does it impact other networks? How do you re hypothecate the bitcoin Economic security.
00:05:53.725 - 00:06:15.693, Speaker B: Yeah. So this idea, bitcoin sticking is in some sense a confluence of multiple different ideas. Okay. So any invention is never created from vacuum. Okay. So this idea of bitcoin sticking is kind Of a combination of several ideas. One is this idea of resticking.
00:06:15.693 - 00:07:07.115, Speaker B: Resticking which is pushed forward by eigenlayer. This idea that you can take a foreign asset, a foreign asset to secure a proof of stake system. I think this idea, we have to give credit to eigenlayer of pushing this idea, okay? However, what is interesting is that you take this idea, you push it to the extreme of this idea. The extreme of this idea is when the foreign asset is the biggest, right? So the idea of borrowing security from a foreign asset is because that foreign asset is bigger than your native asset. Otherwise what's the point of borrowing? You might as well use your own thing. And so if you carry this idea to the most logical extreme, it's actually bitcoin sticking. Okay? The native asset, the biggest foreign asset is Bitcoin and the most secure asset is Bitcoin.
00:07:07.115 - 00:07:48.509, Speaker B: So that's the thought process. Now, however, once you think about that, the problem with Bitcoin, there's several folks, okay? One is Bitcoin holders are very security conscious. Okay? So historically we know that Bitcoin holders do not like to bridge the bitcoin to other chains, okay. And so most vast majority of Bitcoin is on the Bitcoin chain. So how do we do that? Number one. Number two is the fact that on the bitcoin chain there's no smart contract. So K is a very experienced sticking company.
00:07:48.509 - 00:08:14.865, Speaker B: So we know that sticking is a lot is handled by smart contract improvement, stack system. Right? How to deal with unbonding, how to deal with bonding, et cetera. All these are smart contract driven operations. But Babylon, so sorry, Bitcoin doesn't have this. So. So basically that is the major technical problem we solved. So bitcoin staking is sometimes a combination of two ideas.
00:08:14.865 - 00:08:43.445, Speaker B: One is restaking, push to the extreme bitcoin staking, and two is how to overcome the lack of smart contract and can still do the staking natively on the Bitcoin L1 and thus using a technology that we developed through cryptography. So, you know, cryptography is kind of the core of the crypto ecosystem, because cryptography is what makes trustless protocols possible.
00:08:46.705 - 00:09:05.175, Speaker A: Got it. And I also believe that one thing that was foundational for Babylon to exist was the Taput upgrade that happened in 2021. Can you talk a bit about how this upgrade was game changing and how it enabled for Babylon 2 to build what it's building today?
00:09:05.955 - 00:09:50.839, Speaker B: Yeah. So the Taproot upgrade, okay, the Tabroot upgrade allows a more flexible use. For example, we have Multiple spending conditions on the Bitcoin contract and Taproot upgrade enables that. However, I should say that actually, interestingly, even though if there were no tablet upgrade, I believe bitcoin sticking can still be enabled, but not as easily. Okay. The major opcode that we use actually is this idea of a time lock. That's the major technology we use.
00:09:50.839 - 00:10:16.765, Speaker B: But that upgrade of time lock is, I think back in 2015 already. 2015 already. So that's kind of an old innovation in Bitcoin. But if you think about it, what is staking, right? Staking has two aspects. One is locking, and that's why the time lock is important. And two is slashing. Now, slashing is something that's happening on the proof of stick chain.
00:10:16.765 - 00:10:39.845, Speaker B: And so the innovation there is really how to use the slashing event to trigger a spending of distinct Bitcoin. And so that part of the story is entirely an innovation on using cryptography to bridge the gap, rather than using any advance like Taproot on Bitcoin to accomplish that task.
00:10:42.025 - 00:11:08.135, Speaker A: Got it. Yeah. I would love it if you can dive a bit deeper into how this slashing can happen. I think most of our audience that are bitcoiners, they would love to understand how Bitcoin, they can understand a time lock on the bitcoin chain. But understanding how bitcoin can get slashed under a specific condition is probably like the most interesting piece.
00:11:08.795 - 00:11:43.735, Speaker B: Yeah. If you're thinking about it, slashing is something that is very central to a lot of protocols, right. When you land something, you want to slash. And so enabling slashing is kind of our biggest breakthrough. So in proof of stake chains, okay, the most major slashing event is called double side. Okay, Double side is when you try to fork a blockchain. And slashing is used to prevent double sign by saying that if you double sign, then you'll punish the staker.
00:11:43.735 - 00:12:41.015, Speaker B: Okay. Now however, double signing is an event that's happening on the proof of stake chain. If you present that to bitcoin miners who is mining, they don't understand what this means. Okay? This is something completely uncomprehensible to Bitcoin. However, what we realize is that what Bitcoin script understand is signing as transaction, right? And what a signing and transaction needs, it needs a private key. Okay? So what we did is we basically used cryptography to create a special signature scheme, okay. On the proof of stake chain, on proof of stake chain, such that when you sign, normally blocks one by one, one block at each height, then completely safe, like any, like any normal Signature scheme, completely safe.
00:12:41.015 - 00:13:20.945, Speaker B: Your private key does not get leaked. Nobody can force your signature. However, whenever you try to sign two blocks in the same pipe, double sign. Then the private key of the signer, the validator will be leaked. And that private key is used to slash distinct bitcoin. So that's basically the reason why the protocol is trustless, is because we're using cryptography to guarantee that the private keys leave if and only if there's a bad event. And this bad event doesn't need to be controlled by anybody, any third party.
00:13:22.645 - 00:13:40.065, Speaker A: Got it. So basically the bitcoin stakers, they log their bitcoin on the Bitcoin L1. They are also signing a transaction, the complex transaction you talked about that enables slashing in the case of a double signing event.
00:13:40.415 - 00:13:41.007, Speaker B: Correct.
00:13:41.111 - 00:13:56.495, Speaker A: And then this bitcoin is being then staked and it counts as stake on the Babylon ecosystem. It's being delegated to validators, what you call finality providers.
00:13:56.615 - 00:13:57.319, Speaker B: Yes.
00:13:57.487 - 00:14:15.795, Speaker A: What do the finality providers do? Sorry to interrupt, but if you're into Babylon, here's some exciting news. Babylon's upcoming BTC staking cap raise starts Tuesday December 10th for seven days. Prepare for mainnet launch in quarter one 2025 and start earning Babylon points now.
00:14:18.855 - 00:15:31.145, Speaker B: So finally, Providers provides the bitcoin sticking layer of security on proof of stake chains. Okay, so think about Coke example, suppose you have a Cosmos chain, okay, so in the case of Cosmos chains you have so called connect BFT validators. Validating these blocks, signing these blocks. Okay, the finality provider that we have provides an extra layer of security by checking, okay, are these blocks signed properly by the validators? If they are, then we'll sign an extra layer of signatures. And these signatures are the special signatures we call extractable one time signature that I described earlier that has the property that if you sign more than one block then you will be slashed the fanatic provider. So this allows an extra length of security. Now this concept of fanatic finality is actually pretty much invented by Vitalik, so we should give credit to where the idea came from.
00:15:31.145 - 00:16:17.515, Speaker B: Vitalik, in 2017, 2018, timeframe published a paper called Casper the Friendly Ghost where he proposed this idea of adding a fanatic gadget on top of Ethereum at that time, proof of work, to give it some kind of proof of stake hybrid security. So you know, nowadays everyone talks about this modularity, right? Modularity, but in fact Vitalik was one of the early people who was thinking about modularity in terms of consensus is by adding a fanatic gadget on top of an existing consensus protocol. So that's exactly what we're doing here. Except that this fanatic gadget that we're adding is kind of Bitcoin stick fnatic gadget. It provides bitcoin level security.
00:16:19.655 - 00:17:18.255, Speaker A: Got it. So these chain, they get access to the most secure finality possible because it's backed by bitcoin state. And if a malicious action happens, if double signing happens, then the bitcoin will get slashed. But these ch, they also need, I would say, economic security from other pieces of their day to day to day ongoing processes. Like for example, on other proof of stake blockchains, we also see sometimes, especially in the Cosmos ecosystem, we see slash for downtime and we can even see sometimes penalties for just bad blocks being published on chain. These, these consumers of bitcoin security, these consumer zones, how do they tackle this piece of their blockchain security?
00:17:19.035 - 00:17:58.609, Speaker B: Yes. So if you look at like Cosmos slashing events, okay, so currently the highest penalty is double signing. Downtime is relatively minor penalty. And the reason is actually, this reason is actually explained by Shurang, an eigenlayer is because downtime slashing is actually not an objective. It's not objective, but double signing is objective. And so therefore our focus is on objective slashing event. Now for downtime we.
00:17:58.609 - 00:18:35.969, Speaker B: Because it's not objective. And that's why the penalty that proof of stake chain put is very low to avoid sort of penalizing a lot bad good guys. Okay, so that's the problem. And so the way we solve this problem right now is that we will be slashing for the reward. Okay, the reward part. So in other words, if you don't sign, then you don't get rewarded. But there's no way actually that you can use downtime to slash bitcoin stake because our staking is slashing is cryptographic, so it's objective.
00:18:35.969 - 00:18:40.245, Speaker B: So not doing something is not something you can prove to Bitcoin.
00:18:43.385 - 00:19:13.087, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. And that makes me think of the. You were just talking about the objectivity of an offense. And I know that Eigen layer has released the Eigen token to tackle subjective faults. So maybe this is also an interesting parallel. I just wanted to wind back a bit. We talked about how the bitcoin staking works on Babylon, and at the beginning of the podcast we talked about how much bitcoin was staked.
00:19:13.087 - 00:19:49.015, Speaker A: One thing I wanted your opinion on was liquid staking tokens, liquid restaking tokens, liquid restaking protocols, however you want to call it, to call them in the context Of Babylon, we see that of all of the bitcoin that is staked, I would say a very high majority right now comes from these synthesized layers. Do you see an issue on the current dominance of these protocols on bitcoin staking? What is, what do you think that it can impact the security?
00:19:50.555 - 00:20:20.455, Speaker B: Yeah. So, you know, every project, okay, I believe there's a bootstrapping phase and there's a steady state. Okay. In the bootstrapping phase. These new projects, LSTs, are very helpful to us in terms of growing the ecosystem because they're getting a lot of supply of bitcoin into the platform. And we appreciate that now on the longer term. On the longer term.
00:20:20.455 - 00:20:43.117, Speaker B: One reason I should say why in this Cap 1, Cap 2, this early phase, we have this dominance of LST. One reason is because a lot of the existing big custodial and morelet like Ledger have not integrated. Have not integrated with Babylon yet.
00:20:43.221 - 00:20:43.837, Speaker A: Okay.
00:20:43.981 - 00:21:24.321, Speaker B: So these are bigger organization. It takes some time for them to do the integration and do a lot of security audits, et cetera. So it takes them time and they all have a very strong reputation. So it's clear. And so my prediction is that in the longer term, when more custodians and more wallets get integration, then you will get a healthy mix of direct native staking from these platforms together with LSTs. That's my prediction. Because a lot of bitcoin, if you look at a lot of bitcoin, they are actually sitting on these custodians and Ledger wallet.
00:21:24.321 - 00:21:28.045, Speaker B: So these are where a lot of the bitcoins, a huge number of bitcoins are there.
00:21:29.105 - 00:22:00.415, Speaker A: That makes sense. Yeah. So, yeah, that's what you were saying. We are currently in the bootstrapping phase. So this is what you call phase one, where bitcoin stickers can lock their bitcoin and earn points. Can you tell us? So so far we've seen two cap raises, the last one being beginning of this month. Actually, actually, will there be like another clap race before the next phase?
00:22:01.915 - 00:22:13.015, Speaker B: So we have not made final decisions yet. We're still doing the planning, but the direction is we're thinking about another cap yet, but we have not confirmed the final decision yet.
00:22:14.435 - 00:22:38.415, Speaker A: Got it. So right now we're in phase one. We don't know if there's going to be a next cap raise or not. But phase two is, I think, a very interesting phase because it will be the launch of the Babylon chain. Can you tell us a bit, what will phase two bring to the bitcoin staking system? How will it change the game?
00:22:39.235 - 00:23:25.285, Speaker B: Yeah, so Babylon as a whole, the protocol is really running a two sided marketplace where on the one side there's a bitcoin supply, the bitcoin holders are supplying bitcoin, and on the other side there are the consumer chains, the consumer roll ups that is consuming this bitcoin stake. Okay, so that's the two side marketplace. So right now with Facebook, there's only one side. Because to bootstrap any two side marketplace, you should start with one side. You should never start with two side. So you should use one side to attract the other side. So we're growing up the supply side and now in phase two, we're starting the consumer side.
00:23:25.285 - 00:24:18.245, Speaker B: So the first chain, the first chain that would receive become a consumer chain of just bitcoin is. Babylon chain, is our own chain, the one that we designed. And it's like, what do you call it? Dog food chain. Eat your own dog food chain. Now this chain however, has also very important utility functioning of this entire Babylon ecosystem because it serves as a coordination layer between the bitcoin one side and all these other consumer chains that will follow in phase three. So therefore phase two is like somewhere in between phase one, pure supply, and phase three, when other consumer chains will come on board. And that's sort of how we structure the whole sort of launch process.
00:24:19.825 - 00:24:36.561, Speaker A: Can we say that in a way, phase two is like the proof of concept version of actually using the bitcoin economic security. And then phase two will be actually making that bitcoin economic security available to anyone that wants to build on top of it.
00:24:36.673 - 00:25:06.541, Speaker B: No, that's why we're saying that. But it's also that we have to launch the Babylon chain first before the other chains can use it also. So there's two. I think you said it right. There's sort of two reasons why we want phase two before phase three. One is it's kind of a proof of concept of what it means by a consumer chain taking bitcoin staking. So for example, there are, there will be some tokenomics involved there.
00:25:06.541 - 00:25:37.015, Speaker B: Right. So for example, one question that we're trying to solve right now is, hey, there are now two stake, the two types of stake on the Babylon chain. One is native stake and one is bitcoin stake. That's what I mentioned earlier before. Right. Okay, so how do you think about like splitting reward among these two stakers? All right, these two types of stakers. So these problems will need to be solved by almost any consumer chain that will use Babylon.
00:25:37.015 - 00:25:55.675, Speaker B: So we want to solve first we want to see, hey, we have this solution, does it work? Do we need to do governance updates to this solution? So in that sense it's a proof of concept number one. Number two, is it act as a coordination layer? That's a technical technological role.
00:25:56.995 - 00:26:08.215, Speaker A: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And so yeah, so it will be a needed phase. How long do you think the phase will need to be before we can get to phase three?
00:26:11.515 - 00:26:31.425, Speaker B: Wow. Right now we just focus on phase one and building out phase two. And now you're asking me the next step. So I must say at this moment we don't have any specific time frame for how long that phase is. But we don't expect it to be like years. Okay. It's going to be of the order of months probably.
00:26:33.165 - 00:27:22.195, Speaker A: Got it. And so now moving on to phase three. Phase three is when the Bitcoin economic security is being provided to people wanting to build consumer zones. You've call them consumer zones because it sounds a lot like consumer chains. Because these protocols will be firstly Cosmos SDK chains. Can you talk a bit about what is the typical chain that will use Bitcoin economic security at this point in time and do you think it will be existing shame reusing the Bitcoin economic security or do you think this will be a way for people to bootstrap more easily? Chains using the Cosmos SDK?
00:27:24.215 - 00:27:45.593, Speaker B: Yeah. So first of all, right now we are integrating with a bunch of chains. Actually I think the term that we come up with instead of consumer chain is called bsn Bitcoin stick networks. Okay. I think that's the term. These are our BD team thinking about these terms. Okay.
00:27:45.593 - 00:28:40.615, Speaker B: So in the past few weeks I've been pretty deep in the research mode, so I have not been updated with what's the newest term. But I think BSN is determining the code. With Bitcoin stick networks, we are integrating with multiple networks in addition to Cosmos, which was a starting point of our Babylon chain and servants Cosmos chain. So definitely we're integrating with Cosmos, but we're also integrating with roll ups like Optimistic Robs and so forth. So we have integration there as well. So we would imagine that when we launch the phase three, there will be a combination of Cosmos chains and perhaps also rops that would be taking the bitcoin security now. Sorry, I lost track of your question at this point.
00:28:41.795 - 00:29:13.225, Speaker A: You already answered it. My question was, and it was because I had the supposition that it would be only Cosmos chains at the beginning and I needed to ask you if you would see a future where existing Cosmos chains the Bitcoin economic security or do you think the Babylon ecosystem would be like a way for people wanting to build protocols using the Cosmos SDK and Babylon chain, facilitating this booster phase with the Bitcoin security?
00:29:13.805 - 00:29:41.285, Speaker B: Yeah, I think right now, since we're starting this right when we're starting something, of course there are many existing chains already, so we're talking to a bunch of existing chains. For example the Cosmos Hub, the Cosmos Hub, we've been working together for a while and that's an example of existing chain, but we're also talking to new chains, new roll ups. So it's a hybrid too. I don't think it'll be just exclusively one or the other in the phase three.
00:29:42.385 - 00:30:29.275, Speaker A: Can you talk a bit about what would be the decision process to use to, to use Babylon? Because using Babylon also means you need to pay a bunch of your rewards to Babylon. So for example, I am a staker on the Cosmos Hub or if I am a sticker on for example like osemosys and osmosis wants to use potentially Babylon as security, then the community needs to vote to say, well I agree to give out, let's say like 10% of the blockchain revenue to this. What do you think is the pitch of these, the pitch for this existing Cosmos chains to give out a piece of their revenue for the Bitcoin stickers.
00:30:30.815 - 00:31:22.825, Speaker B: Okay, so one of the thesis of the project of why consumer chains of BSN or these chains would like to have Bitcoin staking is because Bitcoin is a very big supply of asset compared to the native asset. Number one. Number two is many people holding Bitcoin anyway. So in other words, they don't have to go and buy Bitcoin to stake on the chain. Whereas for a lot of these native chains there's a need to buy. So therefore the yield, the expectation of the yield of a Bitcoin holder in a protocol like this would be of a significantly lower level compared to the yield you give to a native sticker. So therefore overall you are buying security at a cheaper cost.
00:31:22.825 - 00:32:15.949, Speaker B: And so therefore you can reduce the inflation, reduce inflation on a native asset and you can get the same level of security. So that's one of the pitch of why bitcoin staking on the long run is a good product. Now there's another dimension here which is a little bit more amorphous, but something that we're trying to make a little bit more concrete is alignment. So as you know, bitcoin is getting a second, brief second, what do you call it, Renaissance. At this moment. A lot of people are interested in sort of making better use of Bitcoin. And so there's a lot of projects which are interested in having a stronger alignment to Bitcoin and getting bitcoin security is one way of doing that.
00:32:15.949 - 00:32:52.345, Speaker B: And there's a very good way of doing that. And so a lot of our effort here is to sort of make this alignment sort of more concrete. What does it mean by alignment? Right. Is alignment just a marketing, a marketing, a co marketing effort, or can it be more concrete? So this is something that we're still working hard on and I think you should be hearing some announcement on this front in the not so far future about our effort of making this alignment more concrete beyond just staking, beyond just thinking, beyond just security.
00:32:54.295 - 00:33:46.965, Speaker A: Okay, that's very interesting. And it's even a bit hyping. I'll be sure to look at Twitter in the next few weeks to look for these announcements. Moving on to my next question, we've talked about phase three. I initially thought that phase three will only be for Christmas chains. You told me that it would be for much more than this. Will phase three be the final stage of the Babylon Protocol, or do you also have longer term roadmap items that you might want to include in the protocol that could potentially make us talk about phase four or phase five in a few years?
00:33:48.595 - 00:34:09.707, Speaker B: Yeah. So a good project never ends. Okay. A good project's roadmap never ends, it just keeps on going. It's like a shifting window. Right. So as I mentioned, when we started this project, our whole thesis was basically making use of Bitcoin as a resource for the rest of the ecosystem.
00:34:09.707 - 00:34:31.561, Speaker B: So that theme remains. We are loyal to Bitcoin forever. Okay. That doesn't end. However, the different protocols that leverage of Bitcoin can change over time. And as I mentioned, we already developed earlier protocols like Einstein protocol and now Bitcoin staking. And so we expect there will be more protocols going forward, more protocols going forward.
00:34:31.561 - 00:35:27.065, Speaker B: One thing I would like to say is that all the protocols we've developed are focused on trustless protocols, trustless protocol. And therefore we are very interested in doing research in leveraging our newest advances in bitcoin ecosystems in order to build these protocols. And one advance that we're very interested in, I should give you, is BitVM. So BitVM is a technology that enables Bitcoin to verify external conditions more generally. And so that is a technology we do a Lot of research on and I believe that we could potentially incorporate that into a roadmap, phase three, phase four, phase five, et cetera. But that is a little bit on the research stage right now. So I think I'll wait until a little bit more concrete before we sort of make it more public.
00:35:29.685 - 00:35:59.385, Speaker A: Interesting. There's also like talking about bdvm. There's also an old opcode of Bitcoin that used to be part of its core code that's called opcat. And there's a lot of talk at the moment on crypto, Twitter, on forums. There's a lot of people that want to re enable OPCAT into bitcoin. Do you have a perception there, do you think that opcat can bring a lot to the bitcoin ecosystem?
00:36:00.825 - 00:36:24.885, Speaker B: Yeah. So new opcodes or in this case a rejuvenation of an old opcode is always under discussion in bitcoin. Okay. However it usually is like once every four years you actually get an upgrade. It's like Olympics. Bitcoin is like Olympics. Once every four years you do something.
00:36:24.885 - 00:37:10.153, Speaker B: And so I should say in terms of this opcat, I should say from a different point of view, multiple point view. One is from the Babylon point of view, we don't want to build technology assuming certain opcode will be passed because his history tells us that's a very risky thing. And so all our technologies are built on existing opcodes. That's number one. Now in terms more specifically about opcode however, is that opcode people are starting to realize that whoa, this opcode opcat sounds very innocuous. Concatenating two strings together, what can revolve innocuous and that, but actually that one basic function. People are now discovering that you can do many, many things with it.
00:37:10.153 - 00:37:56.889, Speaker B: Okay. So for example, you can actually create analogy to ERC20 on Bitcoin. So this is much more powerful than existing like currency, like runes or, or nodes because those are actually not verified by the bitcoin miners. The energy ERC20 created using ALCO is currencies that you can be verified by the miners. So it's from a security point of view it's the same level as Bitcoin itself. The asset Bitcoin asset itself. So this is very powerful, but it's a double edged sword because if something is very powerful then it also means that once this is passed, you don't know what will happen to the chain.
00:37:56.889 - 00:38:31.415, Speaker B: You know, Bitcoin is doing well in 72 today, is what, 72K per Bitcoin now you have this ability to suddenly introduce many different assets onto the bitcoin chain at the same level of security as bitcoin itself. Is this a good, necessarily good thing? Not completely sure. So I think opcat is something that is not completely sure whether it's going to pass for sure or people at some point find out, whoa, this is too powerful. It's like we open this genie, what do you call it, this bottle, and the genie comes out and now we can't put it back in.
00:38:34.035 - 00:39:16.565, Speaker A: Interesting take, interesting take. Um, I, I've, I've talked to a lot of people that are a lot more bullish on opcat and I understand your, your, your worries and I think they are shared by a big piece of the community. Uh, but I, I also think that there are some reassuring power that the fact that it's already on, on the, on the bitcoin signet, it's been on other proof of work chains for, for a while. But you're true, you are completely right in saying that if you introduce something so powerful to the bitcoin chain, sky is the limits. But again, like you were saying, it's like the Olympics probably people were saying the same thing about Taput and then Taput got integrated.
00:39:17.025 - 00:39:17.885, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:39:20.105 - 00:39:43.425, Speaker A: Closing in a bit on bitcoin and I think the broader picture. How do you see bitcoin's future? There's a lot of people talking about the potential, a problem with the security budget. I personally don't, don't share these views. What do you think bitcoin looks like in 10, 20 years?
00:39:45.885 - 00:40:14.521, Speaker B: Oh, Bitcoin is definitely still around. In 10, 20 years, the security budget problem, I think, will be solved. How is it going to be solved? It's unclear, but I think overall. Right. Overall what we are doing and many projects are doing in this renaissance of bitcoin is really trying to add more value. Add more value, more use cases to the asset. And use cases bring value.
00:40:14.521 - 00:40:32.355, Speaker B: And bring value. Bring security. Right. So because after all, the miners have to get some value out of the operation chain. So I think we're all going the right direction here. And so that's sort of my take on the evolution of bitcoin.
00:40:32.775 - 00:40:41.875, Speaker A: Yeah. So your plan and the plan of other builders in this space is to create more demand for the bitcoin block space.
00:40:42.895 - 00:40:57.865, Speaker B: Yeah, more demand for the bitcoin block space, more demand for the asset. For the asset. Value of the asset goes up. Block reward also goes up. Yeah. So not to put dimensions here.
00:40:59.845 - 00:41:29.485, Speaker A: And do you think the end game for bitcoin is to scale modularly. We've seen a lot of instances of Bitcoin protocols like lightning network, like liquid trying to build proper L2s. It seems like none of them have clearly found the end all be all solution. What do you think is the future for Bitcoin's modular expansion? Do you think bitcoin sticking plays a role there?
00:41:30.425 - 00:41:51.815, Speaker B: Yeah. So in some sense, right, Bitcoin staking is playing the role of scaling Bitcoin. Because what we're saying is that bitcoin chain itself has very small block space. Okay. It's hard to do many things there. There's no smart contract. And so programming bitcoin programs is hard.
00:41:51.815 - 00:42:52.437, Speaker B: And so what we're saying is that one of the most valuable thing about Bitcoin is the security. And so what we're saying is that we can use Bitcoin security to support other chains. And you can think of all these other chains which get Bitcoin security is in some sense it's an L2 to Bitcoin, whether it's a cosmos chain, whether it's a roll up. In some sense they're borrowing security from Bitcoin and so they became an altitude bitcoin and each of them have their own application. So essentially what we're doing is we're scaling up Bitcoin already through bitcoin staking. And this scaling will become even more useful when people come up with secure bridge, trustless bridging from Bitcoin to these other chains so that even the asset can be bridged over in addition to security. And I think to me the most powerful combination is when the liquidity and the security go hand in hand together.
00:42:52.437 - 00:43:27.675, Speaker B: Because after all, if you have no liquidity on the chain, then what's the point of having all the security? Because there's no economy sitting on the chain. On the other hand, if you have, if you want a lot of liquidity, then you need a lot of security to protect that liquidity. So I think sort of the longer term vision is when liquidity and security can be sort of aligned and both in a trustless or trust minimizing fashion to these L2s side chains of Bitcoin. And that is a sort of a longer term scaling solution for bitcoin growth.
00:43:28.095 - 00:43:35.565, Speaker A: Yeah, it goes back to the debate on the layer one usage. You need to build the economy to pay for the security.
00:43:36.345 - 00:43:37.769, Speaker B: Correct? Exactly.
00:43:37.857 - 00:43:55.289, Speaker A: And to, to, to. We're closing in a bit on time. We're coming to our late latest question. I, I want to give you the opportunity to, to share a bit your. Your socials and to. To tell the audience where they can learn more about. About bitcoin sticking about Babylon and about what you're.
00:43:55.289 - 00:43:56.605, Speaker A: What you're doing yourself.
00:43:58.505 - 00:44:23.335, Speaker B: Yeah. So Babylon. Yes. So website BabylonLabs IO BabylonLabs IO One word. BabylonLabs. You can find out a lot about us. BitcoinStickingBTC S T A K I N G BabylonLabs IO is the sticking website.
00:44:23.335 - 00:44:35.829, Speaker B: You can go there. Q. My socials. Twitter. You can find me on Twitter. So Twitter, I've been experimenting. I've been tweeting more actively than I tweet before.
00:44:35.829 - 00:44:47.665, Speaker B: So yeah, I hope people like it. Just reminiscing my thoughts about research, about technology, about bitcoin. Yeah. So come give me some feedback.
00:44:49.085 - 00:45:08.755, Speaker A: Yeah. Yeah. One tweet today. They say it's the magical recipe. Last question before we. Last question before we end this. Outside of bitcoin, outside of bitcoin staking, what is the one topic in web3 in crypto that you're most interested in?
00:45:13.975 - 00:46:01.495, Speaker B: Yeah, so, you know, I come from a background and my research has been focused on the consensus side. Okay, the consensus side. But what is most powerful, I think, is the combination of consensus and cryptography, particularly zero knowledge technology. So one of my wish in the next while is that I can have some time to really learn deeper about zero knowledge technology and figure out ways to leverage off beta in how to do it in conjunction with consensus protocols, et cetera. So that's my wish that I could have some time to clear my table and clear my head to spend some time with that very deep and fascinating technology.
00:46:02.995 - 00:46:11.547, Speaker A: Very good. Well, we do hope that you stay busy with the bitcoin staking piece. But yes, your knowledge technology is definitely very interesting.
00:46:11.691 - 00:46:21.685, Speaker B: Yeah, this is definitely correlated with our roadmaps going forward phase for phase five, Phase six you're talking about requires research.
00:46:22.945 - 00:46:44.165, Speaker A: Perfect. So they will go hand in hand. It's even better at the end. David, this has been a formidable conversation. Thank you so much for joining. Looking forward to the next chapters of Bitcoin staking Babylon and to the audience. I'll see you on the next one.
00:46:44.585 - 00:46:45.745, Speaker B: Right, thanks a lot, Aga.
