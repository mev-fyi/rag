00:00:00.890 - 00:00:36.230, Speaker A: Hi. In this video I'm going to take you through staking Tezos using the kiln dashboard. So on this page you can see the different protocols we support. We're going to select Tezos. Here you can see some stats about the network and the mechanics of staking on Tezos, followed by some frequently asked questions on Tezos staking. On the right you can see the staking widget which enables us to go ahead and stake. So first we need to connect our wallet.
00:00:36.230 - 00:01:33.878, Speaker A: So I'm using the temple wallet, but as you can see we support a number of other ones. And here I'm going to select this demo two wallet. Now I'm connected and I have a balance of one xTz in this wallet, which in the Tezos network you can only stake the full amount of what's in your wallet. So there's no option to enter how much you want to stake. And then here I can see an estimate of the rewards I can earn based on my stake. Once I'm happy with that, I can just click stake. Now this generates the staking delegation transaction to delegate one XTz to the kiln Baker.
00:01:33.878 - 00:02:14.182, Speaker A: Here we are on the ethernet testnet in this case. So I'm happy with this confirmation. With this transaction I can confirm now the transaction has been sent out and once it gets confirmed on the network, we'll get a confirmation here. And there we go. So that went through. I can click through to the Tezzle Explorer to see the details of this transaction. And that's it.
00:02:14.182 - 00:02:17.170, Speaker A: That's the flow for staking Tezos using the kiln dashboard.
