00:00:00.280 - 00:00:37.088, Speaker A: Rollups and l two s are struggling with the problem today, where they have to compete with l one s for mind share, they have to compete with l one s for tokenomics, etcetera. And it's because costs are high. Sometimes their tokens don't have utility. You know, they're offloading computation, but they're not offloading data. Right? The cost of writing to l one is extremely expensive. So we want to create some mechanisms by which rollups can use their native token for effective value propositions. We want to create proper incentive alignment for them to pay to the Ethereum community.
00:00:37.088 - 00:00:56.400, Speaker A: So whether it's borrowing security through Eigen layer or paying for DA fees to Ethereum stakers and operators, again, there's plenty of DA solutions out there. So why Eigen dA? Because it's Ethereum stakers and ethereum operators that are holding your data and have the crypto economic guarantee of serving your data.
