00:00:10.160 - 00:00:48.566, Speaker A: From the native restaking section, start depositing 32 ETH and delegating to kiln. You will be prompted to read and accept the terms and conditions. The first time you use kiln DAP, you need to verify your wallet address. Then just click stake to get guided on the necessary transactions. To sign to deposit native ETH on Eigenlayer the first time you restake ETH, you will need to start by deploying a eigenpod, allowing you to manage your eigen layer position and link your ETH validators. Also, the first time you interact with kiln Dapp, you will be prompted to deploy a fee splitter allowing kiln to take a small fee. For running your ETH validators in our infrastructure.
00:00:48.566 - 00:01:32.466, Speaker A: You only need to do this once per wallets. Then we will generate validator keys and prompt a transaction to deploy your selected amount of ETH on one or many validators while linking it to your Eigenpod so that your validator can be restaked. The last transaction for now allows the delegation of your eigenpod so that you can generate rewards from avss operated by Kiln. You can track back all transactions on Etherscan. Please note that your ETH is not yet restaked. You need to wait between eight and 12 hours for the Eigenlayer Oracle to see your validator on chain and to enable restaking while connecting. After the eight to twelve h, you will be able to see the validators that can be restaked in your validator table.
00:01:32.466 - 00:01:51.834, Speaker A: You can click on restake to restake all validators that are ready. By clicking Restake again, we will generate the proofs you need to provide and craft the transaction that you need to sign to upload the proofs on chain and have your restaked balance fully generating rewards on Eigenlayer. So that's it. Thanks for.
