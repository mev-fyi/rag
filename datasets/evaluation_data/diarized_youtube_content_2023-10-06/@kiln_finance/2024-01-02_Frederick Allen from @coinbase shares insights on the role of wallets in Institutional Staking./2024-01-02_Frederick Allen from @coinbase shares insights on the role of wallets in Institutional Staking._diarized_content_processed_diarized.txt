00:00:00.250 - 00:00:27.602, Speaker A: What's the role? Probably being played by wallets. Also with institutional staking. I heard you launched a new project partially staking. Yeah, alongside kiln. So the importance of the wallet, I mean, the staking flow. You execute a stake through a wallet, through your wallet solution, whether it's a big custodian like Coinbase, or a smaller wallet, hardware wallet. So importance of wallets and the staking flow is critical.
00:00:27.602 - 00:00:35.940, Speaker A: You can't execute a stake without the wallets. And therefore, for us staking providers as well, we need to partner with these wallets and custodians as well.
