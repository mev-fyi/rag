00:00:05.130 - 00:00:31.986, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm very, very glad and very delighted to have this opportunity to organizing this panel with really excellent panelists. Thank you very much for taking the time and to come. So just once again, maybe to make a quick introduction. On my left, you have de Voiplan, who is a partner at Kramer Levin. And you have Natalie Linhardt from legal counsel from consensus.
00:00:31.986 - 00:00:37.590, Speaker A: So I will give you some words to just introduce yourself and then we're going to come to the subject.
00:00:38.090 - 00:00:48.154, Speaker B: Okay. Thank you, Mane. Thank you for inviting me to attend to this panel. I am a lawyer. I am sorry about that. I am a former banker. I am sorry again.
00:00:48.154 - 00:01:19.494, Speaker B: I am a former trader. I'm sorry, too. I am professor to the Paris Solo university, too. I have a long experience in various international banks. And I am involved on crypto since now nine years when I joined Kramberlevin private office ten years ago. And this is good to discuss on the subject because it is clearly, for me, it is something to see as it was a capital market 25 or 30 years ago. We discover everything.
00:01:19.494 - 00:01:27.880, Speaker B: Everything is new and we have to do something. And sorry, because I am quite maybe the oldest guy in the room.
00:01:28.350 - 00:01:29.500, Speaker A: No, it's me.
00:01:30.910 - 00:01:41.050, Speaker B: But clearly it is interesting for lawyers and people because it is like 25 years ago when the swap market, the capital market, was growing.
00:01:41.390 - 00:01:43.926, Speaker A: Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, Natalie.
00:01:44.038 - 00:02:06.866, Speaker C: Yeah, great. Thanks for having me. Very happy to be here and great to see so many of you here. Although I do have to wonder who's here to learn about regulation. And we're just waiting for Joe to speak after us. But anyway, so, yeah, legacy comes at consensus, focusing on everything from product policy and also regulatory landscape in Europe and us as well.
00:02:06.968 - 00:02:20.554, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you very much. I think that the most important thing you have like three legal persons here. So we really need to start with a disclaimer. Of course. I say this because I know there's going to be a lot of questions. I already see Alex here.
00:02:20.554 - 00:03:03.394, Speaker A: He's the guy who's having almost like set of 15 questions already. It's difficult to be his general counsel sometimes, but yeah. So given that it's just legal talk. So we are trying to express our opinions on certain amount of things regarding staking specifically. So whatever we said here, it's just our opinions and it will not engage kiln consensus or criminal eleven. So thank you very much for your understanding on that. So before I actually start, I think, let's say, with the real discussions about staking and regulatory landscape, I think that it's most important thing actually to distinguish what staking is and to distinguish.
00:03:03.394 - 00:03:51.138, Speaker A: To differentiate staking from other products like Defi and earn. CX earn products. So this is the most important thing. And probably discussions, all discussion will be oriented towards some of the conclusions about what staking is. So what we're trying to accomplish and what we're trying to make people understand that the staking providers are providing a technology, an IT system that permits validators to validate transaction on the blockchain, that permits actually to have a certain security of this validation. And in exchange of this, they will get these rewards, which is absolutely different from other products. For example, Defi products, where you don't have transparency.
00:03:51.138 - 00:04:47.670, Speaker A: Also with CX earned products, which is completely different, they're more focused on trading. You have users who is actually transferring the ownership of the digital assets towards different platforms and different companies. So basically, this is the main problems you have. CX earns earn products that are pretty much the mixture between staking and Defi products. So what we're trying to accomplish is really to express what staking, to define what staking actually is, and to have global opinion, regulatory opinion, global opinion about staking geographically, of course. So that's why actually I wanted to have you, Bert here, who is french qualified lawyer, and he's going to speak about Europe, and Natalie, who will touch the subjects regarding the US and the UK. So basically, I would like firstly to start with Europe and France.
00:04:47.670 - 00:05:13.138, Speaker A: So I understand actually that you have been in Rome recently, where you negotiate the guidelines for UNIDRA. And there is a lot of interesting questions about staking. The notion of undivided pool, which is pretty interesting, I read it's the first time, actually, that I see some reference, a european reference on the staking. Can you give us a little bit more information about that?
00:05:13.224 - 00:05:43.740, Speaker B: Yeah, maybe on the top of that, Uni is an international organization. It's more or less like to prepare and to propose international convention on specific aspects. The last one in the capital market was focusing on securities. It was 15 years ago with the Hague Convention at the Hague. The Hague convention is more focusing on conflict of laws. When UNIDROir is focusing on substantial laws, I. E.
00:05:43.740 - 00:07:02.786, Speaker B: Proprietary laws, to be short and UNIdroir at the demand of some member states have started working two years ago, maybe three years ago, for international principle guidelines for what is digital assets. And during the discussion, part of the discussion was focusing on, okay, first at all, we have to discuss on staking, on Defi. And most of the reference was coming from the US for a lot of reasons, because you maybe don't know that at the same period of time, the US uniform commercial code, the so called UCC, has been revised last year in January to introduce in article twelve a new definition of control. And the definition of control has a lot of direct impact to qualify what is a digital asset and specifically for the staking. And this is where the US have introduced in their new regulations a new UCC. This concept of control for digital assets coming, not coming, but with an interesting link with how we test. We will come back after where we have the undivided pool concept, if I may.
00:07:02.786 - 00:07:51.342, Speaker B: And the idea here is to discuss at UNIDroir how we can harmonize the vision of our staking and globally speaking, on digital assets to see whether or not digital asset is controlled by someone. And then if someone controls a digital asset, then there is a law for out of consequences as the ownership and the transfer and so on and so on. And you're right, it is the first time that we have seen in our official paper concerning digital assets, the notion of undivided pool. And with a lot of discussion about staking at the unidoir, to be short, because I am a lawyer, I can speak a lot, so interrupt me. But people who are working in unidroir are mostly academics, US and UK academics mainly, and their reference is from the US mainly.
00:07:51.406 - 00:07:58.750, Speaker A: So basically it's a harmonization of different, like is there any conclusions that we harmonization.
00:07:58.830 - 00:08:10.210, Speaker B: It is guidelines that then the next step when the principle will be approved by the board of Finidoir, each country can introduce those principles into their jurisdiction.
00:08:10.290 - 00:08:14.202, Speaker A: Is this just a recommendation or it's like having a specific legal force for the others.
00:08:14.256 - 00:08:16.278, Speaker B: No legal force recommendation.
00:08:16.374 - 00:08:41.614, Speaker A: Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you very much, Hubert. So let's travel a little bit in the UK. So basically I think that the collapse and black November was extremely worries everybody after FTX. And I see there are a lot of movements since I think January 2023 where there is a new financial regimes. So what's happening in the UK, Natalie?
00:08:41.742 - 00:09:21.230, Speaker C: Yes, so the uk government has published a consultation in February on the future regulatory framework and it primarily concerns CFI. So it's basically seeking to create a similar framework like Mika. So it would cover centralized exchanges, issuance of crypto, issuance of coins, custody, management of crypto assets. So it's primarily focused on CFI, but there is also section on DeFi. But the government is at the moment taking a phased approach. So focusing on CFI first, because this is where they identified that they are the biggest risks. Like we've seen centralized products last year.
00:09:21.230 - 00:09:32.302, Speaker C: And on DeFi at the moment, they are just collecting evidence, seeking industry feedback, and then later on they might sort of propose some rules.
00:09:32.366 - 00:09:39.110, Speaker A: When do you expect. So we should have very firm regulation like we have in Europe. Do you expect to have something like this?
00:09:39.260 - 00:10:15.550, Speaker C: Yeah. So on the CFI part, the consultation, sort of the final rules will be published in the coming years. It's not anything immediate on Defi. They're just collecting industry feedback. But there's also a section on staking, which to my mind is the first time that there is a consultation on staking specifically. There are a few questions that I think we as an industry should really respond to. One of them is around sort of what staking models would qualify as a collective investment scheme.
00:10:15.550 - 00:10:25.730, Speaker C: So this is quite concerning that they are already thinking about some staking models being an investment scheme. This is a term used for Stratfi investment managers.
00:10:26.810 - 00:10:33.750, Speaker A: Basically, if I understand well, they are progressing in the same path with staking, with the other type of products, correct?
00:10:33.900 - 00:11:06.260, Speaker C: Yeah, it's a progressive sort of. Then another question on staking. In the consultation, they're asking whether we should distinguish between lending, staking and provide liquidity, which to me is quite concerning to ask the question, because it's clear that these are very different products. So again, there's some opportunity for us as an industry to educate the government. And to that end. So the consultation is still open, it closes on the 30 April. So I would encourage everyone to respond to that.
00:11:06.260 - 00:11:31.580, Speaker C: Even if you respond just to the question, staking, it's still available for the government. And yeah, before we move to dvs, just wanted to pause for a second just to appreciate the fact that there is actually an open, transparent consultation. Industry can express their views and the government will then analyze it, take it into account. So we should be grateful that we had this opportunity.
00:11:32.190 - 00:12:22.218, Speaker A: It's pretty different from what's going on in the US, which is very positive. So speaking about the US, I think this is the main subject today. And what's happened with Kraken really disturbed a lot of people, especially, of course, staking providers. So just to give you a little bit of insights of that. So you probably know that in February this year, Kraken decided to settle with SEC. You know probably well that in us you have the situation when you have regulation, power, enforcement. Of course, this is not the tribunal decision, it's just the Kraken decided to settle because SEC considered that staking offer developed by Kraken is considered as a security.
00:12:22.218 - 00:12:49.890, Speaker A: So basically what's happened is that they simply qualify this as a security based on the Howie test. So what I would like to know, and probably if you can explain us how the SEC is functioning actually in the US, and I think that probably they didn't pass the Howie test. So can you please tell us more about how we test, why they didn't pass and what are the main principal points that you can eventually bring forward?
00:12:50.040 - 00:13:46.882, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So a bit about the SEC. So the securities and Exchange Commission, the US federal government agency, they oversee trotfire players like exchanges, broker dealers. And in recent years, they've also claimed jurisdiction over various parts of crypto. Now, like you said, they've chosen the path of targeted enforcement actions instead of publishing clear guidelines for crypto companies. And often people ask, why is that? Why don't they just publish guidelines like the UK is trying to do? And the reason is that it's just easier. They don't have to go through the whole legislative process where their proposals might be challenged, and especially where in situations where the SEC is trying to expand the scope of its jurisdiction to cover crypto, so there could be a lot of challenges.
00:13:46.882 - 00:13:51.682, Speaker C: So that's why they are choosing just to go after targeted players.
00:13:51.746 - 00:14:09.466, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe. Just one thing that maybe we forgot, it's that the fact that the consequence of this decision or this settlement is that Kraken completely discontinued its staking offer in the US. So what does it mean actually for the clients in the US?
00:14:09.648 - 00:15:10.174, Speaker C: So for Kraken's clients, their stake assets were returned, except for ETH, which remains staked until withdrawals are enabled. Otherwise, in terms of impact on other staking offerings, I would expect that to the extent that there are some very similar offerings in the US, then they might want to make some changes. But I would also say that every settlement or every enforcement action is tied to the specifics of the case. So it doesn't set the law, it doesn't set precedent. Ultimately, the law is decided by the Kurds. And in this case, Kraken decided to settle, probably because it makes sense from a business perspective, and also, I think because here the case was less clear cut. I think in general, the SEC tries to go after easy targets, low hanging freuds, where the action is quite easily justified, and Kraken was one of them.
00:15:10.174 - 00:16:02.000, Speaker C: But I do think that if the SEC chose to go after sort of more controversial targets, then the industry would probably unite and challenge the SEC in Kurt, because, like I said, ultimately the Kurt decide the law. And I think one example where this could happen is if the SEC goes after base layer staking or solo staking, where it staked directly, not through a provider, because that would really be fundamental expansion of the concept of securities. And there, I think the industry would really challenge the action incurred. I would also say that the chair in particular, Gary Gensler, probably heard him saying that crypto companies should just come in and register as if it was an easy thing to do.
00:16:02.450 - 00:16:21.894, Speaker A: Exactly. One of the questions that I have, if this is the problems, why we should just register? No, where is the problem? So why they don't register? And I heard somewhere, actually, that it's the part of their business strategy to settle more than to get registered. So why they don't register? Just what is the problem?
00:16:22.012 - 00:16:55.362, Speaker C: Yeah, so the securities act, which is the main part of the securities law, it's from 1933. So obviously then envisage the new products like staking programs. Players in the industry actually aren't sure how to register. Even with the best lawyers. They're actually not sure. For example, Coinbase said that even though they have all the means to go through the honors process, they're still not sure what to register as or what exactly to do. So that's one thing.
00:16:55.362 - 00:17:23.046, Speaker C: And also one of the SEC commissioners, Hester Pierce, she published a dissenting opinion in the Krakens case. She said that in the current climate, crypto related offerings aren't making it through the registration pipeline. So it even comes from within the SEC, sort of the acknowledgement that even if someone was a good faith actor and wanted to register, then even in that case, they probably wouldn't succeed.
00:17:23.238 - 00:17:52.206, Speaker A: Okay, thank you, Natalie Huber. Let's come back to Europe and make some kind of a comparison between the US and Europe. So do we have how we test in Europe? Of course, we don't have regulation for enforcement. This is for sure. And this is, I think, an advantage that we have in Europe. But how we are functioning in Europe, what is the main difference? We don't have how we test? Do we have the similar type of regulation? What are the main differences in terms know in these processes?
00:17:52.318 - 00:18:29.470, Speaker B: The main difference is, as in the US, they are targeting, sticking and other people to come, if I may, to the securities law and regulation in the EU. This is not the case. The question is about the definition of digital assets, whether or not an activity should be or will be considered or qualified as a digital asset in the sense of today's french law and tomorrow on the future. Mika regulation. We don't have the same debate. The debate in the US is whether or not a product or an activity should be considered as a security here. Clearly this is not a security.
00:18:29.470 - 00:19:01.610, Speaker B: This is not a security in the EU. In France, I suppose in the UK too, potentially it is a digital asset. And potentially it is a service which must be regulated by digital asset service providers. The future Casp, a crypto asset service provider. And the question today is whether or not the future e regulation will cover defi. Clearly not. And staking unclear, because it has been drafted before the growth of staking, if I may.
00:19:01.610 - 00:20:10.254, Speaker B: And it is the same for France. The french regulator, the IMF, has issued a few weeks ago, maybe two months ago. Now a questionnaire to some people, maybe to you too, to discuss on defi, not on staking, but more specifically to question on the defi. This is not an open debate as in the UK, because there is no target today to do something in the french law and regulation. But clearly some people are thinking about the possibility to regulate staking in France before to regulate the EU. If the mika is clearly too far in term of covering the sticking in the next months, because again, Zemica, which is supposed to enter into force now in a few months, because the official vote will be soon, but then it will be 2024, 2025, depending on the aspect of the mika. Clearly again, it doesn't cover defi, not sure it cover staking in such case some local regulators or local jurisdictions, as France will potentially prepare something.
00:20:10.372 - 00:20:16.290, Speaker A: And actually how the staking could actually be challenged by regulatory framework in Europe.
00:20:18.310 - 00:21:30.090, Speaker B: Considering it is a digital asset service activity, okay. Not a security, but this is a digital asset first, and digital asset service activity, which is supposed to be regulated. And this is why it is important to see on a case by case basis with chart flows, who is doing what, who is transferring what to see, okay? Who is providing a service potentially, if it is a pure peer to peer or pure technology aspect, there is no service and no service, no regulated activity. And this is why the process is quite long and unclear at the end of the day, because we don't have any guidelines or something special. Having the document published from the UK will clearly help us, even though it is from the UK, because it will develop and analyze in the UK law, but in the EU sense, because UK is closer to the EU than the US, if I may, on this sense. Absolutely. Having this document will clearly help people to see whether or not this is a digital asset service activity.
00:21:30.430 - 00:22:19.242, Speaker A: Thank you, Hubert. Maybe back to basics from the beginning. So when I explain what staking actually is and trying actually to figure out how different staking providers could actually be defined and qualified in the US specifically. Because when you read a complaint from SEC, you can practically, realistically actually realize that it's not all staking that is actually security. So, okay, we are scrutinized what's going on in the US. We spend a lot of time with our lawyers to understand and get a lot of things, a lot of legal opinions to ensure our customers. But what I actually seen in Kraken settlement is that it's not all staking that's considered a security.
00:22:19.242 - 00:22:53.106, Speaker A: It's more likely they are attacking how they design actually their staking offer. So I would like actually to find out, to specify this difference between, okay, this is Kraken, this is why they have settled like this. And what about other staking providers, what kind of research that they need to made and what kind of legal opinions they need to have in order to demonstrate what they're actually doing. So can you tell us a little bit more about that? Am I a good understanding about that?
00:22:53.208 - 00:24:05.802, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. That's absolutely right. So the Kraken's offering had some certain design features that, like I said, made it an easy target. And actually, the SEC, in its ruling, they distinguished clearly from solo staking, for example, in the way that as a solo staker, you receive all the rewards generated by the protocol automatically, whereas in Kraken's case, they sort of played with the rewards before sending them to the customer. So at least we have some guidance in the ruling that solo staking, the SEC sees it as different, but maybe going back to the HOE test and to sort of show how the SEC concluded that the Krakens offering was a security. So the HOE test is a test that used to determine whether something is an investment contract in the US, and there are four limbs, and all of them have to be satisfied in order for something to qualify the security. So the test is, is there an investment of money in a Kamla enterprise with the expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others? So the first lamp investment of money.
00:24:05.802 - 00:24:52.630, Speaker C: So in the Kraken's case, basically in general, the Kurtz for this test, they are looking whether the customer has put their assets at financial risk. So in Kraken's case, it was about custody mainly, and the fact that according to their terms and conditions, the ownership over the assets passed to Kraken. So customers lost ownership of their assets. And what this means for the financial risk is that customers essentially took an exposure against the platform, against Kraken, rather than against the protocol. So that's why they basically took a counterparty risk against the platform. So that's for the first prong. The second one, common enterprise, this was about pooling.
00:24:52.630 - 00:25:56.160, Speaker C: So Kraken pulled customers assets together, but also they then commingled the customers'assets, with their own proprietor assets. This was a problem because what the Kurds are looking at for this common enterprise test is whether the fortunes of the investor and the scheme promoter, whether they are tied together, whether they fluctuate in the same way together. And here, clearly, if you commingle your own asset with the customer's assets, then that's satisfied. The third limb about expectation of profit, that was about marketing. So the way that Kraken talked about their program was in terms of like, you will get this yield. They made it sound as if it was like an investment, like a bond, instead of emphasizing that staking is a data validation, it's not computer science thing, essentially. So because of the language that Kraken used, they created these expectation of profits among the public.
00:25:56.160 - 00:26:52.602, Speaker C: And the last limp expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. That was actually key, because what Kraken did, they went beyond just providing technical validation services the way that kiln does, or the way that the consensus staking offering works. What Kraken did was that they exercised discretion. They exercised more managerial and entrepreneurial efforts. And so through this, they were able to influence sort of the amount of reverence, also the way that the rewards were distributed, because they didn't just pass on whatever was generated by the protocol, they just collected it and they sent a portion of it to the customers, the portion they kept for themselves. But they had a more active role than just what, for example, kilndess.
00:26:52.666 - 00:27:28.198, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you, Nazi. Just maybe one question. It's more like a simple question, but I know that everybody, all staking providers probably will get their own legal opinions about that. But I've heard a lot of in the markets, I've read lots about this. And do you think that if somebody just say, we are not custodial, so we are not receiving the ownership of the digital assets from the user, is this sufficient just to say that we are not security, or we should have more elaborated research about that and making sure that all these four prongs are actually satisfied in order to get rid of any risks?
00:27:28.374 - 00:27:53.646, Speaker C: Yeah. So being non custodial helps. Definitely. It reduces the risk, but it doesn't eliminate it entirely. It helps in that customers would be able to withdraw their funds, they will still be able to send the exit message once withdrawals are enabled. So in the case of insolvency of the provider, they wouldn't have an exposure against the provider, but they would still be able to get their setback. So that's different from Kraken.
00:27:53.646 - 00:28:26.618, Speaker C: But what ultimately matters is what you do with the fund. So if you are non custodial but still have a more active role, for example, promising some minimum returns instead of just passing on the rewards to the customers, then you are still at risk of your offering being a secret. So the key aspect is whether you exercise discretion or whether you just perform the more technical administrative duties of validating.
00:28:26.794 - 00:28:39.330, Speaker A: Yeah, this is what I thought. So, Huber, is there any reactions in Europe, in France? So what's happening in the US, especially regarding Kraken, or it's pretty much silent?
00:28:40.630 - 00:29:07.722, Speaker B: Not specifically. And I think one of the main reasons is due to the fact that it does exist, a regulation in France and tomorrow in the EU with the mika one, as it is not the case in the US. Again, it is very important for the SEC or any other regulator. They don't have any reference. The only reference that they do have is the security regulation. They don't have as us the possibility to refer to a specific regulation on digital assets. This is the main difference.
00:29:07.722 - 00:29:42.694, Speaker B: This is why the question I come back a little on the discussion with Natalie. The discussion whether or not it is a security has no sense here. The discussion whether or not is it a digital asset regulated activity, and more specifically, the custody activity. Because if you look about the various activities in the Mikawan, clearly it is not a crypto exchange. Clearly it is not buy and sell on behalf of a third party. The only possibility to be regulated as digital assets in such case is the custody, who controls the key. And we come back to the concept of control.
00:29:42.694 - 00:30:51.820, Speaker B: And to respond to your question, not specifically, except in France, with the new amendment in the french regulation to increase the requirements from the french casp, the french crypto asset service providers, the so called Absan, you have maybe seen the french parliament to be short. There is in France today two possibilities, a registration or a full license. Full license is more or less like a broker dealer license, when a registration was or is quite easy to obtain, because it is only focusing on EML. And after this amendment to the french parliament, the idea is to have the same level of requirements with the full license, but except which is important, except the capital ratio and all the capital requirements. But for the rest, it will be the same. And this is the answer of the FTX, which has no sense, by the way, because it will not avoid the risk of fraud. But this is a political answer to say to the public, yes, we did.
00:30:54.350 - 00:31:36.310, Speaker A: So Bec, come to the conclusions. Of course, you can all ask questions, so we'll have the set of different questions that you might have. So what I understand from this discussion is that native staking have a little bit less risks to be considered as a security. For the reason that we have mentioned, we have to differentiate this from the specific earned products, but we need to be careful. So this is what I understood from this. Thank you very much for this part. So anyone, if you have any questions, we'll be glad to respond.
00:31:36.310 - 00:32:28.330, Speaker A: Alex? Yeah, okay, I can repeat it. I can repeat it. Sorry. So the question is whether we have any opinions about Asia or know. Unfortunately, we have just legal qualified lawyers for France, Europe and UK. And us for the moment, we didn't touch this subject, but it will certainly be part of our interest. Of course, there's so much interest.
00:32:29.600 - 00:32:31.500, Speaker B: It's a technical evolution.
00:32:31.920 - 00:32:34.610, Speaker D: I feel like everything is staking the last 18 months.
00:32:35.540 - 00:33:05.530, Speaker A: Why there is interest in staking, but probably because of this regulation. Probably because firstly, I don't know if you agree with me. We know when you don't have a specific legislation, who will manage this. And then you have like the CC settlement, SEC settlement, probably everybody's just panicking. So it's just as simple as that, I think. And probably there is not a lot of things written about staking. Just, we just explain.
00:33:06.140 - 00:33:44.100, Speaker B: They don't like to see an activity to the public, to the retail, when there is no one in the box. They want to put people in one box, whatever the box is. If it is commodities, if it is securities, if it is digital assets, if you provide an activity to the public, even though the public is professional, but not institutional, but professional. And specifically if it is a pure retail clients, yes. They cannot accept that there is a lot of activities out the scope of the regulation, especially if you market it as an investment.
00:33:47.560 - 00:34:25.844, Speaker C: I think we need to be, as an industry, very careful about the language that we use, the terminology. The US proof of Stake alliance has published some industry guidelines a few weeks ago on how to talk about staking. So I would encourage everyone to follow that. Basically, we should avoid using any financial terms like yield. My colleague Wilhelgs in the US, he said that he will beat over the head anyone who uses the term yield in the staking context. It's quite effective to introduce the same policy at kiln. And it's really about being clear about what staking is with the customers.
00:34:25.844 - 00:35:16.004, Speaker C: So if you talk about it as an investment, then you're actually mischaracterizing what staking is. You're misrepresenting to the users, and also you're doing disservice to your company because it can really come back to bite you later. For example, there was another SEC case earlier against library, where basically the library project describe or talk about their tokens in their adverts and promotions in terms of the tokens, that the tokens will go up in value instead of focusing on the utility of the tokens. And then it's very easy for the SEC to then come and point to those adverts and say that this created expectations among the public that this is actually an investment and that they will get profits from it.
00:35:16.122 - 00:35:44.110, Speaker A: Yeah, just remind me of one question. So there is a recent, in recent lawsuit, there is an attorney general in the US emphasized that Ethereum is a mean, of course it's not a decision, just emphasize in a lawsuit that Ethereum is a security. How can this actually be consequential for the staking providers? Because the Ethereum, it's in the heart of our business.
00:35:44.560 - 00:36:15.110, Speaker C: So not consequential. So first of all, the new orgatran general, it was just like a side comment in a broader case that also talk about Terra Luna and other tokens. And it doesn't set the law, doesn't set precedent. It's not even the SEC who said that. It's just the New York attorney general. And we've heard various comments about ETH being security over the years, quite a lot.
00:36:17.000 - 00:36:19.732, Speaker A: So do you agree with me just to say please don't panic?
00:36:19.796 - 00:36:25.016, Speaker C: Yeah, please don't panic. We had consulted, certainly. Keep going, keep building.
00:36:25.118 - 00:36:27.000, Speaker A: Great. Thank you. This is reassuring.
00:36:28.800 - 00:37:12.324, Speaker E: So we understand that we have guidelines in Europe and we have the enforcement law from the SEC in the US three years ago, we had some spreadsheets that was provided by the SEC in order to run tests on tokens in order to understand if there were securities or utility tokens. Do you think that the SEC, in order to provide some standard to the market and guidelines, are going to run the same process in providing some test for people just to qualify the service they are providing to their clients if it is a security solution. So asset management or technology service.
00:37:12.522 - 00:37:57.264, Speaker C: Yeah, we would like to see that. I think that's what the industry has been asking for for a long time in terms of how likely that is. Hard to say under the current chair, Gary Gensler, like we've said, that the path they've chosen so far was regulation by enforcement. If they wanted to issue some guidelines, they've had a chance to do that. So I think for now, the industry just needs to learn some lessons from the past enforcement actions. But ultimately, we need to realize that each enforcement action is really tied to the specifics. And also, it's important to say that Kraken didn't actually accept liability.
00:37:57.264 - 00:38:15.740, Speaker C: They just decided to settle because they didn't want to fight. It made business sense for them. Businesses settle cases all the time just because it's easier and it's a business decision. So, yeah, we can learn some lessons, but shouldn't panic again, but we would like to seek guidelines. Of course.
00:38:15.890 - 00:38:16.990, Speaker E: Any more question?
00:38:18.000 - 00:38:19.244, Speaker B: Sorry, just quickly.
00:38:19.362 - 00:38:45.270, Speaker E: That's a bit of my next question regarding what happened to Kraken and an exchange that is offering staking in the US. What do you think will happen to other exchanges, large exchange that are offering staking in the US? What should be their behavior? And do you think just changing the wording and taking the Posa proof of stake alliance kind of guidance would be enough?
00:38:45.800 - 00:39:44.868, Speaker C: Yeah. So, for example, Coinbase, a few days after the Kraken settlement was out, they published clear statement differentiating their offering from Kraken's and saying that their offering isn't security, for example, because the ownership of the asset stays with the customer. Even though Coinbase has a custodial service, the ownership is still with the customer. So the customer isn't taking counterparty risk against the exchange. But to the extent that there are some other offerings that are very similar to Kraken's that have those specific design features that made it an easy target, then they should probably change some of those features. But otherwise, Coinbase continues to offer their program. So, yeah, it again depends on how similar other offerings are to Krakens.
00:39:45.044 - 00:39:57.020, Speaker A: Thank you. Any other questions? Yeah. Okay, perfect. I'm surprised that I don't have questions from Alex Metz. Oh, plenty.
00:39:57.440 - 00:39:59.580, Speaker D: But I'm just trying to think of the formula.
00:39:59.920 - 00:40:02.192, Speaker A: Can you take a mic? Yeah.
00:40:02.246 - 00:40:11.756, Speaker D: So I guess my primary question would be, it seems like the wording is a big thing and it's also about the investments.
00:40:11.788 - 00:40:12.032, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:12.086 - 00:40:50.190, Speaker D: Because we also encounter a lot that the term staking is used in many different ways by many different types of crypto businesses, but it all comes down to guaranteeing or promising some type of yield to a retail audience. And I guess my question is, do you think that the hard take on the SEC of doing case by case rather than writing legislation might also have to do with the fact that they think this is unacceptable. We need to jump on this rather than really distinguishing what's happening behind the scenes with all these different individual companies. Do you think that that might be a large reason why this is so aggressive towards protocol staking, specifically because there might be a misuse of terms there?
00:40:52.900 - 00:41:28.772, Speaker C: Yeah, I think the terminology is important. And also we should clearly distinguish between different staking models. So custodial. Non custodial, solo staking. So, yeah, the SEC has chosen, in Kraken's case, to go after something that, in my view, probably most resembles a security. But other staking programs are different. So we need to be clear about the differences and just look at the specifics.
00:41:28.916 - 00:41:29.610, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:31.020 - 00:41:33.290, Speaker D: Maybe one small question after that.
00:41:35.580 - 00:41:38.716, Speaker A: We also see the last one. Yeah. Thank you.
00:41:38.738 - 00:41:54.636, Speaker D: So we see a lot of centralized exchanges also launching noncustodial wallets on the side. If they were to channel all of their protocol staking activities through the noncustodial wallets, would that be a potential route that would be deemed acceptable since there's no real asset management or counterparty risk?
00:41:54.828 - 00:42:52.348, Speaker C: Yeah. So the non custody would reduce some of the risks, like you said, the counterpart risk, but still depends what kind of services the provider provides. If it's just pure validation, just the technical service that kiln, for example, does, or consensus is taking, and then whatever fees and rewards are generated are passed directly to the non custodial wallet, then that's safe. And I'm not sure whether from a product perspective, that would be possible to have noncustodial offering, but at the same time, more active management of rewards or promising some minimum rewards. So far, I haven't seen any offerings like this, but potentially, in theory, that's possible. And in that case, to the extent that there would be no more discretion, more managerial involvement, then that puts you at risk.
00:42:52.524 - 00:43:05.830, Speaker A: Thank you very much, Natalie. I'm really grateful to have you today. This. It's a great honor for me and also for kiln. So thank you very much, and thank you for having us.
