00:00:00.090 - 00:00:50.174, Speaker A: Hi everyone, this is Ernest from the Kiln team. In this video I'm going to go through staking Ethereum using kiln and funds held in fortify. So here I'm in my fortify dashboard. You can see I have some Gori EtH and I have all that in a vault here called test and the fortify extension installed here. So it's very simple to stake with fortify and kiln. Basically here I'm in the kiln dashboard. On the EtH page I can see some stats on the left and on the right.
00:00:50.174 - 00:01:34.780, Speaker A: I can choose how much I want to stake. And in order to go ahead and stake, first I need to connect my wallet. So the fortify extension uses the same interface as metamask. So I select metamask, which I have also had installed, but I disabled it for this demo. And here I've now connected my fortify extension. You can see that the DAp shows up here. The wallet address ends in FD, capital f, which is the same as here.
00:01:34.780 - 00:03:15.070, Speaker A: And so I can go ahead and say I want to start one validator or two say I can go ahead and hit stake. So in the background this is spinning up two validators on kiln infrastructure and it's going to propose a deposit transaction here, right? So this transaction is for me to deposit 64 gori ETH into the beacon chain deposit contract on on Gori. And here I can see in my fortify extension the details of this transaction. If you have a policy in place, you might need to update your policy to make sure that you are allowed to do this and whitelist the relevant contract. In my case, I've got a policy that enables me to do this. And once I am happy with this, I can hit create. So in my fortify app I can see there's a contract call, the same contract call and I can choose to sign it.
00:03:15.070 - 00:04:03.068, Speaker A: Here we go. So now I've successfully signed a transaction using my fortify app on my phone and the transaction is now processed. So here we go. It shows up here on the Gordi Explorer. It's just being indexed by the network. And so yeah, I've successfully staked two validators. So hopefully this demo gave you an idea of how easy it is to stake Ethereum using fortify and kiln.
00:04:03.068 - 00:04:03.950, Speaker A: Thanks for watching.
