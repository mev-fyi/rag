00:00:00.170 - 00:00:51.290, Speaker A: The way you would build a web application back in 1995, right? You have to build your own server, you have to build your own payments, you have to build your own identity, you have to build your own database and then you have to kind of sell books, right? This is what Amazon was doing. They just want to sell books and in 2024 that's absolutely not how you do it. You go to AWS, you'll get like stripe for payments, you'll get Oauth for like identity, you'd get Mongod be for a database today in blockchains you have to go produce decentralized trust. So our vision was if you add a common pool of decentralized trust now people can build these services in cloud. This was called SaaS software as a service you write your software, you throw it on AWS and then every time people are using it you just have like an economic model which it's earning fee. It is very similar to what an aviator.
