00:00:07.210 - 00:00:54.960, Speaker A: In this video I'm going to go through how to stake several assets with fireblocks resigning API directly into kin dashboard with the example of Dot. This is also the case for Ada, Osmo and Atom. Here we're using fireblocks, which is the most popular solution for tech custody. Using the role signing API overcomes the challenge of the asset not being supported by fireblocks. Within the wallet connect integration let's go into it. In the dashboard I have to go on the stake tab, pick the asset I want to stake. So here dot I'm going to select the account I want to stake through.
00:00:54.960 - 00:01:40.654, Speaker A: So here it's going to be testing account I'm going to connect my fileblocks. In order to interface with fileblocks I have to input the API key, my API secret key and the vault id. For me it's number seven. I then have to pick the amount I want to stake. I click the stake button. Here I can see the transaction hash and the transaction serialized by the API. Again, click on the minital link.
00:01:40.654 - 00:02:24.620, Speaker A: This is an open source tool to decode road transaction into JSON object and get access to the transaction payload. Here you can see what you signed. My policy with fireblocks is to auto approve transaction here. So my transaction got signed and is now being processed. I received a validation message. I can click on the link to get sent to the explorer to validate that the transaction has been taken into account by the network. And I can see below my staked amount has increased by 0.1.
00:02:24.620 - 00:03:00.230, Speaker A: If I want to unstake in a similar fashion, I have to input the amount I want to unstake. So from this 3.4 west end the test token of dot I can pick 0.1 and I can click unstake. Here again the transaction is getting serialized by the API. I can check it with minutel. According to my policy, the transaction is also approved within my five blocks.
00:03:00.230 - 00:03:26.510, Speaker A: And now the unbounding amount, which means the amount that was unstaken has increased by 0.1, reaching 2.2 in real life dot I will have to wait 28 days to be able to claim this amount. Here the test network it's going to take two days, then I can click done. That's it for now. Thanks for listening.
