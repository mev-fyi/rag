00:00:07.400 - 00:00:20.994, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to a new episode of the Kiln restaking rendezvous. I'm Edgar, protocol specialist at Kiln. And today we have Jay from Silence Laboratories and we're going to be talking about the Silence lab avs. How are you, Jay?
00:00:22.054 - 00:00:24.234, Speaker B: Well, Jeff, thanks for having me.
00:00:25.054 - 00:00:37.094, Speaker A: Pleasure. Well, to start this off, maybe you can start by kind of introducing yourself, like your background and how you started to work in the blockchain space.
00:00:38.354 - 00:01:06.534, Speaker B: Yeah, sure, right, yeah. I'm Jay, co founder and CEO of Science Laboratories. It's a young company based out of Singapore, but pretty distributed, first of all. Yeah. Going with the history of the company, it comes from the academic research which we have been doing. All the co founders are PSD in cybersecurity. We have been doing our psds, particularly in infrastructure, designing better authentication algorithms and security.
00:01:06.534 - 00:01:33.582, Speaker B: So during. Yeah, right. Of doing our PhD, we have designing algorithms for seamless and real authentication. And that triggered the starting of our company, silence. And since the very early stage, our goal has been to create a privacy tech enterprise. And that's what drives us towards all the critical use cases which we encountered in blockchain space particularly. We started talking to digital asset players wallets.
00:01:33.582 - 00:01:56.164, Speaker B: And then we figured out that single point of failure in account management was a pretty interesting problem to hop on. And we didn't have decent background in maths, so yeah, we last on and we found a good problem to solve and that's how we started. Since then, things have been evolving, which we'll talk more. We have been evolving in our product, in our mindset, in our close to market.
00:01:57.144 - 00:02:19.506, Speaker A: Nice is more great. And so did the approach that you have right now was always the going to be the initial approach or did you try to tackle a cybersecurity problem in the crypto space at the beginning, that may have changed what is kind of like your background story in the context of gridview, right?
00:02:19.570 - 00:02:58.174, Speaker B: Yeah, it's quite interesting. So when we started, we had no idea about crypto, honestly. And this is about 2021, early 2021. We were trying to explore if the algorithm we have been developing in multifactor auth can be used for crypto wallets. That's how we started to interact with wallets. We went then to sell our two factor authentication solutions. We found multiple vulnerability into fact, authenticated solutions, published them in good conferences, and then we thought, okay, this can be useful for crypto wallets because we have been listening about multiple scams, facing scams and hacks.
00:02:58.174 - 00:03:41.594, Speaker B: But when we approached them, we found no, the problem which we were trying to solve is good, it happens, but the severity is not that high. The severity of key management, single point of relevant key is much more higher. We interacted with Compton like metamask in the beginning and then, yeah, up during interaction we figure out solving decentralization of keys is but something which is, which will be fully impactful and that actually introduce us to the mainstream crypto market or crypto economics. And yeah, then since then we have been focusing on that particularly. So, yeah, it has been an evolution with a slow way. We have been learning about this space.
00:03:42.054 - 00:03:48.078, Speaker A: Great. And so like you and your co founders, you, you met in the, in the academic space, right?
00:03:48.206 - 00:04:06.704, Speaker B: Right, yeah, we all make into academic space. My co founder and who is from Ukraine, we're doing this PlG in Singapore. And yeah, another co founder would be at MIT. Then we moved to Singapore and yeah, yeah, we all somehow aligned on this common problem around cybersecurity.
00:04:07.324 - 00:04:17.704, Speaker A: Great. And so the product that you are building today involves something that's called MPC. Can you remind the audience, what is MPC technology?
00:04:18.284 - 00:04:53.538, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. So probably before going into that direction, I will share roughly the vision of the company and then why we use MPC. So Cyrus laboratory is all about creating privacy preserving Internet. Our long term vision is to redesign the way access to Internet and processing on Internet and communication happens. Currently, as we will acknowledge, it's very centralized. We do have lots of assumption on this space, and it's not certainly privacy preserving, not transparent, not anymore. End to end auditable.
00:04:53.538 - 00:05:26.064, Speaker B: Our goal is to create a privacy preserving data economy. And to achieve that, we have broken the whole roadmap into two phases. One is to fix account management and access, and then to fix the way data collaboration happens. We will go in two phases. That's the whole goal of the company and NPC. The multiparty computation is a beautiful tool, which we believe can help us achieve that. And that's why we are heavily building cryptographic libraries centered around MPC.
00:05:26.064 - 00:06:08.616, Speaker B: Now, coming back to why MPC? Because the fundamental power of MPC as a concept is to enable you to compute any arbitrary function, let's say theoretically, on distributed data. Let's say we have a set of data d with three different parties. It can be anything. We can compute a function as if they were in the same space, same place, and get the same output. So yeah, MPC helps you to compute functions on the distributed datasets in a privacy preserving manner so that none of the party can see at each of those data. In the first phase of the company, that data is key share. Imagine metamask or any wallet has a key in one place in your browser.
00:06:08.616 - 00:06:43.934, Speaker B: Let's imagine a scenario where you split those key shares, not literally, but using MPC based decentralized scheme generation. One key share on browser, one key share on server, or maybe on phone. And then we use MPC based special signature algorithm to generate a signature. This is much more secure and much more resigned compared to a single point of key based signatures. And that's where MPC are. Kind of helps a lot. And similarly, it is d are data points can be your personal data, it can be your digital footprints, and you can compute arbitrary and refunds.
00:06:43.934 - 00:06:47.894, Speaker B: And that's part of the phase one of the company. Phase two of the company.
00:06:47.934 - 00:07:09.994, Speaker A: Sorry, that's, that's very interesting. I used to work at ledger before, so I kind of heard a bit of about NPC in the context of crypto wallets. So that's one thing that I kind of understood. Can you, can you give a bit more, like, can you give like a concrete example of what MPC would work in the phase two that you were describing?
00:07:10.474 - 00:07:59.340, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Let's imagine a wall where my financial transactions, my financial footprints are with a different entities, right? It can be with a crypto exchange, it can be with a bank. And we want to create a boring algorithm. We want to use our transaction trees across different policy institutions to get some credit line. The way it happens right now is there are companies which dumps all your financial history in one place, and then they will calculate your score. It has been working fine, but the problem with whole design is we are trusting that third party and they do cross sell your data, your transaction history. That's not going to be the mainstream train down the line.
00:07:59.340 - 00:08:38.702, Speaker B: And that's the beauty of blockchain. And what we are talking today can enable using PG tools like MVC or FNG. So what we do here is that using our infra, which we have been building, our libraries will be integrated with these forest institutions. And let's say our library is working with a rank, Wells Fargo one, and then exchange in one place, and then one bank in other place. And then these data or transition history can be d function. Here is scoring function, scoring function. You can compute the same score without actually revealing your transactions to another parties and then get the output exposure as an API.
00:08:38.702 - 00:08:46.114, Speaker B: And that's the inside we are trying to build using MPC and decentralized distributed computation in a privacy preserving manner.
00:08:48.254 - 00:09:20.854, Speaker A: Very interesting. I think this is important to remind the audience of the privacy challenges that exist in crypto today and the security challenge that comes with it. Crypto has seen a lot of hacks in its history and a lot of data leaks. Do you have something in mind, for example, that would never have happened if they were using a silent slab product?
00:09:22.234 - 00:10:14.016, Speaker B: Sure. All the single point of failures, whether it is web two or web3, wherever your data leaks happens on your identities, data on. There have been multiple misuse of attacks as well, where digital identity wallets expose all the information. And yeah, there was a recent news which came up a couple of days back you kicked claiming that there was some attack by China on their digital electronic data points. So all the single pointer failures could have been avoided if there was never data in one place. If we can distribute the risk using tools like MPC or Apache, certainly these things can be avoided and say for key management all the accounts via ten hack which happens because of keys being in one place. They could have been avoided.
00:10:14.016 - 00:10:34.454, Speaker B: If we use tools like MPC based distributor signatures and that's going mainstream, you will see many companies in the space building around. You have jain slide fire blocks, company like blockchain and many others operating in a more of enterprise setup. And then companies like us providing libraries and working with different digital assets companies.
00:10:36.554 - 00:11:12.264, Speaker A: Very interesting. Let's take a step back for a moment and remind ourselves that we are talking in the context of a podcast around restaking. So I think it's a great way to talk about like Eigen layer and your relationship with Eigen Layer. When you started to build silence lab, maybe you were not aware of that Eigenair was going to be starting as a project. When did you get convinced that you would need to integrate to Eigenair as an AV's to better your product?
00:11:13.324 - 00:11:57.424, Speaker B: Wow, that's something that happened a couple of months back. So yeah, we have been building since around two and a half years, but we came to know about Eigen around six months back when. So some channel id salt and we talked about social signatures and decentralized compute. And then we are lying. Oh yeah, this is certainly a problem which Eigen and us, if we build together console. So the very beauty of Eigen or similar infrastructure solution is that they are doing the heavy lifting of bringing economic trust, which we as a company. If we start to do, we will waste loss of our operational resources in doing that.
00:11:57.424 - 00:12:52.910, Speaker B: And this is valid for both our phase one and phase two, both for account management and data persisting in privacy prevailing manner. See why Eigen in this case. So let's say we were trying to build a decentralized key management or signature scheme. What would you do? What would we do? We will create multiple nodes of, let's say on GCP or AWS and talk to partners. Maybe we'll talk to some prestigious organizations and then tell them, okay, can you run a node and can we have a legal argument that, okay, you won't collude or we will trust you and all those things that would have been operationally very conscious and so in said, so we did not build any decentralized key management solution then because it was a hard territory. But the moment we heard about Eigen, it was a hard moment because yeah, now we can offload that part through seeking build the economic trust inside. And we will just cater to the cryptographic algorithms.
00:12:52.910 - 00:13:09.784, Speaker B: And that's a powerful tool which Eigen is building. And that's why we lash on to developing around it. And we can talk much more why it adds lots of value and create differentiation if we're not building using Eigen. And without Eigen, particularly about, let's say decentralized key management solution.
00:13:12.204 - 00:13:22.380, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's actually a perfect segue. I would love for you to talk more about the why behind the science lab Eigen layer collaboration.
00:13:22.492 - 00:14:01.456, Speaker B: Sure. So like I was saying, yeah. If we were not using Eigen to build a key management solution which is running multiple MPc node for signing on cloud, then there were. There was no trust and there was no incentive as such binded to the transactions that parties won't include. So what we are doing here is that each of the operators in Eigen ecosystem will have our MPC code for solar signing. And they will hold one key share of the user. So let's say we are starting with our system of around let's say eleven operators, right? Each will have one key share.
00:14:01.456 - 00:14:21.672, Speaker B: And we have two paradigms. Either user can have one key share or maybe not. So we support both mechanisms. When user has one key share, then we do use hierarchical signatures. Where user key share is at a higher hierarchy and network key shares are the lower hierarchy and network consign. Even if they meet the quorum structure.
00:14:21.808 - 00:14:22.840, Speaker A: Just to align everyone.
00:14:22.952 - 00:14:52.254, Speaker B: In MPC signing we can define a quorum. It can be two out of three or n out of n where. Where the autofl where t is a threshold. If tea parties can come together, they can create a value signature. So in this case what's happening is each operator has one key share. Now, eigenbrains inherent economic trust because they have restrict some value in network, right. There is a good amount of dollar which is at risk for these parties.
00:14:52.254 - 00:15:26.354, Speaker B: They won't just float and move away with all the fronts of the user, because it's not just one abs which they are working with, they'll be working with multiple AV's and they're also part of the ecosystem. So the collusion probability is super low. That's coming from the design perspective. But we have also added identifiable abort. So we can identify two things. If somebody operator is not replying, they are offline, they are not meeting the liveness guarantees, number one. And we can differentiate that from operating, which is trying to cheat, or providing some malicious message, or not complying with the protocol.
00:15:26.354 - 00:16:15.096, Speaker B: And once we know these two information, we can design slashing algorithms around it. That's part of the inherent our signing scheme, which is probably one of the first going to be in production in this particular setup. So because of these, there's a very heavy trust in the ecosystem, and then multiple retail wallets, whether it is UA based or whether it is smart account base, they can come and start building with us. And that's why comes what we are going to do next. So we have partnered with Bikonomi, which is one of the leading smart account infrastructure provider, and then we are going to create decentralized signatures, an account management tool on top of Eigen as an AV's. And it can be used by any wallets and then they can start building around it. They can build programs on when to sign injections.
00:16:15.096 - 00:16:47.344, Speaker B: So basically it's a programmable account management infrastructure, catering particularly to retail. But it can refer enterprise gate wallets as well. Because we are providing multiple niche features, which is non collusive. Networks can't collude. If you use the second paradigm when has a key share, we have identifiable abort where you can slash if there is some mischief happening. And we also have a feature wherein your shining is a function of the weighted state value. Until now people have been using multisig for that.
00:16:47.344 - 00:17:19.794, Speaker B: In typical, let's say crosswind bridge setup, where you're signing authority is a function of your weight staked value. We have adopted the same MPC setup. The computation happens off chain and you submit just one signature. So the cost is also pretty low. So you can design a weighted system signing algorithm. So because of these three primitives and economic incentives align with the whole ecosystem, it creates a very powerful tool for digital asset management. And we believe we will be onboarding lots of, lots of wallet designers onto this ecosystem.
00:17:21.974 - 00:17:39.614, Speaker A: Great. So yeah, it's clear that you guys will benefit tremendously from having economic security backing your protocol. My follow up question would be how much economic security, uh, with your protocol need?
00:17:40.794 - 00:18:07.604, Speaker B: Yeah, that's something which we are evaluating very honestly. We have been talking to regularly with different operators. It's something which we are still about to lock in, but we will keep it and what any times multiple of the maximum value of wallets, which our system will support. So certainly it will be a couple of double digit, multiple of the total accounts, which nonetheless can support.
00:18:10.784 - 00:18:45.804, Speaker A: Great. And so the follow up question is, the way you attract the secondary security is by providing revenue to that restate capital, basically. Can you talk a bit about how big you think the market is for people using who that will be using the silence lab protocol and. Yeah, and how basically, like how you plan to retribute this economic security, securing the silent slab abs.
00:18:46.424 - 00:19:30.780, Speaker B: Right. Yeah, that's a very interesting question, which I believe the whole ecosystem is trying to figure out. And we will see a sweet spot. So we will go in a stages, there is more as such, and we will try to understand how ecosystem is behaving. In the beginning, it's a sensor down of the revenue which the network will be getting from the wallets. Any, any company, let's say any wallet company which will use this infrastructure, will pay to the network price, which is fraction of numbers of transactions or numbers of accounts they will create. And we can easily imagine, I mean, based off, based on what you see from Metamask itself, right, the top three wallets, they have double digit, millions of accounts.
00:19:30.780 - 00:20:07.654, Speaker B: Right? So let's imagine a world where we shift all of these people, this ecosystem, you have around more than 50 million or 60 million active wallets, and that can lead to a very decent amounts of revenue coming in flow to the ecosystem. And that will get split between us on the operators. But yeah, that's something which will happen down the line. It's a slow process. We have to build trust first and then. Yeah, so the world that this is possible, a couple of things that are very important. Usability, laviness, guarantees from the operators and siding speed.
00:20:07.654 - 00:20:42.204, Speaker B: And we are quite, quite proud that we have adopted an algorithm which is potentially one of the fastest, called DKNS 23. It's much more faster, or we can say around ten to 15 times faster than contemporary deployed in production algorithms. So because of this, yeah, we will be able to onboard lots of these existing wallets in both EOA and smart account ecosystem. And we can imagine, yeah, hitting around a couple of millions of active wallets per day by end of this year that's our target while working together with players like Bikonomi.
00:20:43.864 - 00:21:04.800, Speaker A: Great. And these, these wallets, these underlying users, how in how will be the form of basically how will they pay basically for this service? And the reason I ask is also because our staker audience, they want to know like what type of asset they will, they will get as retribution.
00:21:04.952 - 00:21:29.744, Speaker B: Right. So we are trading on two things. Honestly, what is a fixed price at subscription and then play and then building a tokenomics around that. Tokenomics will a function of like I said, how we see the ecosystem behaving. We don't want to rush but in the beginning it will be a subscription based pricing as a function of transactions being done. And then yeah, eventually we will figure out the best fit spot tokenomics around it.
00:21:31.604 - 00:21:37.980, Speaker A: And do you already know if it's going to be e, if it's going to be USDC or something else?
00:21:38.172 - 00:22:09.120, Speaker B: I still figuring out, yeah, we will observe and then choose which one will yeah, we are going to absorb how I India and couple of other and yeah, then we will choose which sounds more selly for the ecosystem. But yeah, the first thing is we have to bring the volume, we have to bring all the wallets live and to use the infrastructure then yeah, the unit when you're sharing would not be tough, it would be quite promising.
00:22:09.272 - 00:22:27.774, Speaker A: Makes sense. And so yeah, you mentioned eigenva. The Davs Mainnet is something that's coming very soon. Talk a bit about your timelines for launch. When do you expect to be live?
00:22:28.394 - 00:23:04.434, Speaker B: Our current phases things are working fine in house. We are talking to operators and we are going to choose eleven operators in the beginning and yeah, we are talking with them and we will be giving them the whole package in a period of around ten days. We will let run the whole test phase for around year, sorry, around a month. And the plan is to go live somewhere around mid May when the things will go to proper production state. Yeah. And from there we'll see how things go out.
00:23:06.774 - 00:23:19.024, Speaker A: Great. And so do you already have like I guess on the business development side, wallets or users like waiting for the silent slab avs to launch in order.
00:23:19.364 - 00:24:03.016, Speaker B: To use the product? There's a huge push and that's again because the way we have partnered with Bioconovic we will see a great instruction account smart account management wallets and we will try to onboard many more. So if you track the whole space you have lots of social login based wallets, many more you have party based wallets. The way they are operating is they have passkey they can authenticate to a network and then that will create sign. Things are working fine over there. But those networks don't have same economic guarantees. They don't have slashing, they don't have weighted signing and all the primitive which we talk, which eigen brings. The amount of trust is not that high, so we should be able to shift them.
00:24:03.016 - 00:24:32.244, Speaker B: And we have been talking to many more, many such social login based wallets, many such parsky based wallets, embedded wallets particularly. And then yeah, level shift. We do have a waitlist and we are very happy to talk to any embedded wallet company, any key management company, and to work together with them to onboard to this infrastructure where the speed and usability is guaranteed at a much higher level compared to the contemporary infrastructure.
00:24:34.984 - 00:25:02.944, Speaker A: And talk a bit about how is it to run the silent slab Avs as an operator. Is it something, it sounds like it's something that might not be a very heavy lift at the beginning, but as usage becomes more and more complex, could the silence lab AV's and some operators face the risk of having to deal with a very expensive and heavy lifting?
00:25:03.724 - 00:26:00.202, Speaker B: Let's see the sage one. Our phase one is a small amount of computations or for each signature. We are not doing some heavy heavy computation at such on the MIA sites and the protocols are pretty optimized to do that. So there won't be a behavior lifting for phase one where it's just about account management. But for phase two, which is a much larger game where we are trying to bind the whole reason of privacy preserving Internet, then yeah, there we will have huge amount of data being pumped and processing happening, which is, which will be quite heavy. But the economics around it will be much more rewarding as well because the vision is to create subnets of applications, one subnet for finance, one subnet for healthcare, one subnet for fraud finding and compliance, and many more. And then the whole market is pretty big, which comes with the heavy lifting and data management.
00:26:00.202 - 00:26:31.484, Speaker B: But we will work together with operators and our partners to realize that. But yeah, in the phase one product on punishment, it's pretty, the leverage of lightweight competitions are very optimal. I'm not savvy. The one expectation will be to use proper lobbyist guarantee bit redundancy and also support conference computer securing supporting hardware because yeah, you have key management or key share statistic.
00:26:34.584 - 00:26:57.170, Speaker A: Understood. And so you mentioned earlier that you will be, you're starting with an active set of eleven operators. Do you plan on having that active set growing in the future? Do you have a future for a completely permissionless protocol where any operator can opt in.
00:26:57.362 - 00:27:31.274, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very nice question. It will take time to go permissionless. It's in our vision and protocol actually supports network increment without obstructing the user's private key. Users won't notice any change in their private key. They will able to perform transactions the way we're doing before. And we can change the quantum structure and network, we will increase it to provide higher economic trust and better decentralization. And slowly maybe move towards a permissionless, but not in the beginning.
00:27:31.274 - 00:27:48.984, Speaker B: Yeah, we don't want to inherently just jump on, create a change for a content management. First it should have add value, let people see the value and match to the experience and guarantees which a digital asset product needs. And then yeah, we will move to trustless.
00:27:50.844 - 00:28:13.932, Speaker A: Okay, and a follow up question. In the context of eigen layer, how do you see like what the, what the, what the operators in your set are doing with the rest of their AV's that they support? Like could you be like reluctant to share your economic security with like avss that maybe have like higher risk profiles?
00:28:14.108 - 00:28:18.180, Speaker B: I don't know what selling security, but yeah, for.
00:28:18.212 - 00:28:20.036, Speaker A: Yeah, in the context of pooled.
00:28:20.220 - 00:29:00.364, Speaker B: Pooled security, no, actually that's required for, for a sustainable ecosystem. We can't just tell our operator to just work with us and just take some value because ultimately they are here for making some revenue, right. That they have some economic expectations to meet. So the sustainable model is that our one operator serves across multiple aviations and we do, we need to work with them in that capacity. We will evaluate how the whole sharing and risk thing happens and accordingly we will choose eleven operators to work with us.
00:29:02.384 - 00:29:08.160, Speaker A: Do you feel like maybe also you would be using the attributable, the attributed saves?
00:29:08.352 - 00:29:21.914, Speaker B: That would help. That would be of good help to us. Right, sorry, that thing is coming up. I believe in sometime later in my ecosystem, that will also be a very, very powerful trust building parameter.
00:29:23.614 - 00:30:22.912, Speaker A: Yes, it's a good thing that you mentioned that slashing will not be available. And again, they are from the get go. There will be like, we believe to be like a six month period where there will be no slashing. So yeah, less, less risk for the risk takers, but of course more risk a bit for the protocols building on Eigenveil, slashing is something that will be needed along the way. Perfect. So I guess my last question would be what is your long term vision of Eigen layer you've seen as a protocol builder? What it enabled for you, how do you envision the future of the space and maybe not eigenaire in general, maybe retaking in general and what it's how what you can do with economic security from, from, from place e to be reused in place b.
00:30:22.968 - 00:31:20.162, Speaker B: Right, right. Yeah but see it's a quite a beautiful concept. And on the protocols like Eigen Babylon or a whale, these are enabling a walls where things can be built at pretty fast speed because like I said, they are doing the heavy lifting and all the operational things are done at the base layer. Now it's time for us as a company to build applications on top of it without worrying about all the operations working with different stakers. It's a quite nice parameter and it's a good order that's coming up in the whole global crypto economics setup. And yeah, the future which we see is there will be multiple, multiple avss kind of applications, multiple applications being built on these primitives. And for us what we want to see is creating what we are calling a subnets.
00:31:20.162 - 00:32:28.688, Speaker B: Like I told application oriented subnets wherein the operators will be having, they will participate in one subnet or many more that will be supported. But yeah, what we will do is we will create multiple applications around it like I told in phase two down the line where we have a privacy preserving Internet ecosystem growth and it will be usually used for, not just for access management but for data computation as well. If you try this space you have configured like Inco Zama and yeah, they are pushing heavily on g based ecosystem and similarly we are pushing MPC based ecosystem. And at some point in time we do envision where Fhe is ready to be used commercially. In practice setup MPC and FH will complement and then we can build a much more powerful privacy tool and privacy infrastructure where other companies can come and build applications. We will create subnets which can be programmed for privacy preserving applications. We will have a marketplace around it where companies will come deploy their algorithms and open up APIs for other parties to start using it.
00:32:28.688 - 00:32:36.724, Speaker B: So yeah, it's a beautiful world. The basis have been created and we will enable good infrastructure down the line.
00:32:38.904 - 00:32:49.400, Speaker A: Great. Do you maybe as last world have any advice for builders looking into building their own AV's? Take some.
00:32:49.432 - 00:33:17.384, Speaker B: You summon the Wolverine. So the best advice is to talk. They have been very supportive the whole ecosystem and the team from Eigen is quite supportive. Yeah, talked with multiple other users, learned from them because the tech part is easy. What is to figure out here is economics around and how to onboard different partners. And that can be done by knowledge sharing. So you know, active talking and engagement is something which will help.
00:33:19.954 - 00:33:28.162, Speaker A: Super nice. Perfect. Where can we send the audience to know more about you and about the about Senate?
00:33:28.218 - 00:33:49.184, Speaker B: So anybody can just read our website, we have a link at very top to book a call. And I can guarantee either I or our business heads or our CTO will jump on the call and talk whatever anybody is interested in around decentralized security, privacy and naming of the darker in case.
00:33:51.804 - 00:34:12.462, Speaker A: Well, Jay, it was a pleasure to have you on the show. Maybe we should do this another time when you start rolling out the negro radio for your AV's until I wish you like great success to the audience. We'll see you guys in the next.
00:34:12.518 - 00:34:20.814, Speaker B: Thank you very much. That's quite nice form for interaction and learning about what people are building. Thank you very much.
