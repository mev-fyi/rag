00:00:00.810 - 00:00:25.990, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. In this video I'm going to take you through staking Ethereum using funds held in defense. So here on the defense interface, I've got an account ready with some Eth on gori. And first what I need to do is link this account to the kiln dashboard. So here in the kiln dashboard, also on testnet, I'm in the Ethereum page.
00:00:26.060 - 00:00:29.254, Speaker B: On the left I can see some.
00:00:29.292 - 00:01:20.930, Speaker A: Details about staking Eth, but on the right is where I can choose which account I want to stake towards and connect a wallet. So here we're going to use the wallet connect interface. What I'm going to do is copy to the clipboard these connection details, then go back to defense and link this public key, which is the public key that's associated to this defense account, to the kiln dashboard. Right. So I can click here for this public key, click on Wallet Connect, enter the URI that I have just copied, and hit connect. Now I can see that this address is correctly connected and this is indeed.
00:01:21.010 - 00:01:25.750, Speaker B: The same address that I can see in defense.
00:01:26.490 - 00:01:55.410, Speaker A: And now I can confirm that this is the address I want to stake from. And hit stake. Now in the background, this is going to generate validator keys on the kiln infrastructure, one via data key. In this case here, the transaction is being sent to defense via the wallet connect interface for it to be signed there. Right.
00:01:55.480 - 00:02:09.830, Speaker B: And according to your defense governance rules, this will get approved or not. In this case, it's going to get approved because it falls within the thresholds that have been set up.
00:02:09.900 - 00:02:19.466, Speaker A: So it takes a tiny bit of time there for the transaction to be signed. And once it's signed, we'll see that.
00:02:19.488 - 00:02:24.970, Speaker B: It gets broadcast to the network and we'll see that our validator is funded.
00:02:40.890 - 00:02:57.990, Speaker A: Okay, here we go. So the transaction has been signed in defense and now it's being processed on the gorely chain. And here we go. It's now been confirmed and we can see here the transaction hash.
00:02:58.150 - 00:03:01.130, Speaker B: So this validator has been funded.
00:03:02.190 - 00:03:11.120, Speaker A: So that's it really. It's only in a couple of clicks you can actually stake ETH from defense using the kiln dashboard. Thanks for watching.
