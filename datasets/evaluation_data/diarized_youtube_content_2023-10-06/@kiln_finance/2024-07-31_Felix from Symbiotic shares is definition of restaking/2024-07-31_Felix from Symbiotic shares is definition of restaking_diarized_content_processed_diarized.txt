00:00:00.280 - 00:00:58.090, Speaker A: Some of the earlier shared security systems. They sort of mandatorily made the node operators run like more networks. For example, in Polkadot you have the relay chain and then you have the parachains and every operator has to run all the parachains. Mandatorily versus restaking is more like taking an approach of it's opt in. You don't like the same capital can be reused, but the operators can sort of like decide if they actually want to take part in this new network. And that brings like more optionality and is like a step in the right direction to sort of enable a more diverse, a better system that's not as rigid and less opinionated we'll get to like. And basically what we're trying to build is like the most like flexible, unopinionated system that allows builders to really build the system in a way that it can decentralize and that we can have different configurations that sort of fit your application use case.
