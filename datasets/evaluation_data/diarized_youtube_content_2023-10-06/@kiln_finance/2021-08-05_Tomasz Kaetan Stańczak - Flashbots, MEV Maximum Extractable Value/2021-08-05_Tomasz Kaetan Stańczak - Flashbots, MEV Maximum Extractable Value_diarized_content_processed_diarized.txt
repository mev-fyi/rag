00:00:04.160 - 00:00:49.920, Speaker A: Hi everyone. Okay, so my name is Thomas Tanzak. I work on Flashbot team also work on a few other projects, including Tendermind. So this actually allows to show you some of the prototypes today and some of the work that we've done in the past. We fly though with Tendermind, with Flashbot, and this talk will be on MeV on Ethereum two. So while everything that we've seen before was either at this stage of being on Testnet, or already operating in a massive scale, MeV on if two is obviously at the stage of researching, prototyping and experimenting. So I think this one will be slightly more dreamy and going between different potential solutions.
00:00:49.920 - 00:01:32.796, Speaker A: And if you want to follow the topic and look for all the other research and ideas that were here. So some examples would be at if research. So Vitalik's proposal on the proposal block builder split. We'll talk about it a bit then if to MeV with liquid staking. So the second one is the example of our prototype that we were building together with Lido and flashbots and mind for the Eve global hackathon. It was one of the winning projects and Amev after the merge. So this is the talk from Eve global presentations and we explore.
00:01:32.796 - 00:03:01.820, Speaker A: There are some ideas, and there will be at least one really fresh thing today that I hope that you enjoy. So, as a reminder for some and a good introduction for others on what really differs before the merge and after the merge, where the merge is the merge of Ethereum one and Ethereum two chains, and acting no longer as separate chains, but as two parts of the system, where one is acting as the execution layer and the other as a consensus layer. So Ethereum one becoming execution layer, delivering blocks, building the blocks, validating blocks, and the Ethereum two beacon chain and validators, acting as the block proposers and distributing them on the network. So nothing about building blocks, selecting transactions, preparing blocks and running all the state transition changes. But what changes after is how the block is propagated. So either we have the traditional proof of work, Ethereum one style distribution and random statistical assignment of who will be the next block proposer based on the hash power, or the preselected validator that we often know a few minutes, twelve minutes in advance on who will be proposing the block, and maybe as an introduction. So mev minor extractable value, which you've heard about already.
00:03:01.820 - 00:04:04.572, Speaker A: But why is it important in theorem two? Because it massively changes the revenue of the validators. So this chart actually shows the comparison of the blue line, no MEV and orange line with MEV projected revenue of the validator operators, it's a huge difference, like almost twice the revenue flow. There's more detailed numbers you can find in all those presentations. They explored it in details. There were some numbers being run by Justin Drake, by Alex Obadia from Flashbot, so you can find this more detailed, but just to show that it will be a big deal because it massively changes the yields that are achievable in the system, after Ethereum, one will come to play. So maybe first the solution that was suggested by Vitalik on if research. So let's look at it, how it works, and then we'll talk about two things that we explored in flashbots and prototyped.
00:04:04.572 - 00:05:13.376, Speaker A: So first thing is this, proposer block builder separation. So you no longer have the vision of one entity acting as block builder, and at the same time the one who distributes proposes the block to the network. But those roles are split. And because they are split, there is suddenly some assignment that the block proposer is the one who is finding the mev opportunities, and block builder is the one that finds mev opportunities. And block proposer is the one who later publishes the block after choosing what mev opportunities most profitable for the validator. And the idea behind this block proposal, block builder separation, was that it will be friendly for untrusted builder, which means you don't want to have the builders of the blogs that are particularly skillful or have to be trusted, have to be bigger than others, because you want to allow the small block builders to participate in a network. So you want to avoid the centralization of block builders.
00:05:13.376 - 00:06:16.116, Speaker A: The second thing is untrusted proposer friendliness. So similarly, you don't want to have huge block proposers to have to be trusted, but you want to have lots of smaller block proposers to be equally accessible for the solution, for the weak proposer friendliness. So this is a similar requirement. And then we want to have some simplicity, don't introduce too many layers over layers, commitments, reveals, slashings and so on. Want this to behave relatively simple. And as always with MeV, one thing that we really care about is that the bundles, so the MEV opportunities that are being sent and delivered by the searchers, the arbitragers, that they cannot be stolen, that someone cannot look at it and say, oh, actually, I'll just take it instead as my account and I include it in the block. And this is a short visualization of those two ideas within the proposal, block builder split from Vitalik.
00:06:16.116 - 00:07:13.276, Speaker A: So one is assuming that the block builders are sending just the headers commitments, payments to the block proposers. And then the block proposer selects the best of those headers, the one that promises the best MeV. And then the block builder either publishes the body or not, and depending on that, the fork choice rule changes. The body may arrive, may not, and the block is being broadcasted. The other proposal is slightly different. So the block proposer selects multiple different offered MEV bundles, chooses those headers that promise to pay to the block proposers, and then the bodies are being revealed. And then there is a second round where block proposer is selecting from among the few proposed headers that they committed to before, so they sign, okay, I will choose something from this list.
00:07:13.276 - 00:08:44.276, Speaker A: And later, when I learn about bodies, I can select one and say, this is the one that goes to the network, and we won't really dwell much more on those two. And now we'll go to some ideas that were coming from the research in the flashboard space, just to introduce, maybe once again, flashbots. Flashbots has nowadays this system that provides decentralized, democratized way of moving MeV outside of miners only, and miners private arrangements with the arbitragers, and provides the endpoints for searchers of arbitrage opportunities anywhere to connect to the network, send the bundles and those bundles being delivered to the miners, and the miners, including them in the blocks. And when you think about so far, what has been achieved, like miners from these operations, miners got around $110,000,000 already, and the total extracted value was probably around 800 million since the beginning of January. And over 300,000 blocks include on the main net in Ethereum, the bundles delivered by flashbots. And I think nowadays, 85% of hash rate is flashboards, 56% of blocks include some flashbot bundles nowadays, and so on, so on. So those numbers are really, really quite significant on mainet and these organizations.
00:08:44.276 - 00:09:52.684, Speaker A: I think it's very open with all the research. So if you are interested in participation in the research, there's lots of research opportunities published on the report. So the first solution that was being explored was the very basic one. We may think of it like as a naive implementation of what works nowadays in Ethereum one, and moving that to Ethereum two space. And we explored this as part of the IP global hackathon, and that was being worked together with people from Lido team and from Nandamind. So what happens here is you have the searchers that find arbitrage opportunities, they send it to relay, and the relay is the same relay that operates nowadays in flashbots, is a centralized service. In a way it can be operated actually by independent relayers, but nowadays really there is a one big flashbots relay that handles most of the connection with the miners relay, collects the bundles as MEV suggestions from searchers, sends it to the execution layer.
00:09:52.684 - 00:10:51.756, Speaker A: Client ethereum. One client that simulates all the bundles, verifies how much revenue they bring to the validator. Then as part of this block processing, what happens is we launch something that is called prism contract, that splits the payment into multiple participants, and it allows the MEV value to be paid between the Ethereum one node operator, the staking pool and validators. So stakers, validators and Ethereum one execution layer, depending on the dynamics of how powerful they are in this cooperation. So we can expect that maybe stakers are the ones that should get the most of the MEV. Maybe it will be validators, maybe it will be the actual block builder, or maybe it will be searchers. So whenever we see mev, there is this dynamics of who is managing to get the highest value, highest percentage of that MeV split.
00:10:51.756 - 00:12:01.972, Speaker A: Even nowadays it's a searcher miner. In this setup, we went for a most simple split of one third to everyone. But we assume that this is something that market splits later and after construction of that block that is being pushed to the validator, and validator publishes it next. And I think I've spent a bit more time on the second solution, which is practically something that we discussed recently and that we're quite excited about to explore. And we started building prototypes, and I think there is one prototype now in Netamindrepo, but soon there should be one on mevgas, and there'll be also coming, probably somewhere after FCC, an implementation on the ethersjs splashbox provider for this solution. So here the whole idea is based on something that Jason Pariani proposed, which is using the dev p two p layer for distribution of the MeV bundles. And that's something that we wanted to do for a long time, because it feels a bit more right than having this centralized relayer to push the bundles.
00:12:01.972 - 00:12:42.208, Speaker A: We wanted to say, oh, the bundles could actually travel the same way as normal transactions. But we were thinking for a long time that traveling as normal transactions actually means kind of normal transactions. We have to provide EIP and change the introduce a new transaction type to deliver bundles. Why do we want to deliver bundles in some special way? Because we want to encrypt them for specific validators. So you're talking about Ethereum two. However, later we realized that this solution can be also used even now in Ethereum one, so we can start testing it very soon. The idea is the searcher knows in advance what validator will be validating the block.
00:12:42.208 - 00:13:32.644, Speaker A: So they have a few minutes for that. They prepare the MeV opportunity and they encrypt the bundle for that particular validator. And then in a moment I'll show how. But they send it through dev p two p, and that's being picked by different nodes. But the particular validator that knows that it was addressed for them can decrypt it and include it in a block. And what comes together with this solution is that all the validators can register which block builders they accept, which block builders they are trusting, or which block builders satisfy their requirements on how to construct the blocks. And also coming also a bit based on feedback from the staking operators that there might be some arrangements where we want to construct the blocks in a specific way.
00:13:32.644 - 00:14:29.032, Speaker A: Maybe not necessarily MEV comes first, maybe there is a set of transactions coming first before MeV. And these rules have to be consistent between validators saying okay, these blocks are fine for me, and the block builder saying I cannot really deliver any blocks to validators that won't follow those rules because of my arrangements. So how do we build the transactions that are delivered with encrypted bundles? So to introduce the concept of carrier transaction and what carrier transaction does, it's absolutely normal transaction. It doesn't introduce a new type of transaction. It runs on the p to P network. And if we send it nowadays, it would be delivered to all the mempool nodes, all the nodes listening to Mempool. Why? Because it has the sender which is valid, it has a valid nons and it has a gas price that is covering the cost of transaction.
00:14:29.032 - 00:15:14.760, Speaker A: So it's simply passing all the rules that the transaction pool would use for validation nowadays. And where is the bundle? The bundle is encrypted in the call data field, in the data field of the transaction. Which means that you pay a bit more for the intrinsic cost of a transaction because all the bytes of the data have to be paid for. So it's a bit more costly, right? Because every searcher has to pay for each transaction they pushing to the network. But it also solves any problems of the denial of service attacks on the relayers or the miners. So whenever you send a transaction, either someone will unpack the bundle for themselves and discard the shell. They don't even have to include this carrier transaction.
00:15:14.760 - 00:15:49.104, Speaker A: Or potentially someone includes a carrier transaction and then maybe later from that block will extract the bundle and include it later. But there is really no chance of losing this transaction. It is paying for itself. And also, if we want to just flood the network, Didoz the network, then someone will say, okay, you're trying to attack it. So we'll include all of those transactions in blocks and we'll have to pay. And with the IP 1559, it means that as you start attacking, you'll be pushing the transaction cost up and up and up. And as for the construction of the block.
00:15:49.104 - 00:16:36.420, Speaker A: So that thing that we mentioned on, I mentioned on how we create a registry, and the validator says, I only accept this block builders, we can create a very simple definition of how the block builder creates the blocks. You can say, this is how I build them. If you want, as a searcher, to send mev to me, then maybe I will include first the section in the block space, which will be for a particular partner of ours. Then there will be flashbots, mev, or any mev. Then maybe I'll include the mempool. And then something that we often talk about, like the second lane of flashboards, which is privacy only, but it's cheaper because it's not Mev, it's just privacy. So I don't care to be in the front of the blog, but I care about being private and not being published anymore.
00:16:36.420 - 00:18:18.624, Speaker A: And this is just one example. And there can be a DSL that is publicly available and everyone can, as a searcher, can verify if I'm okay to work with this validator, if I can connect, find the connection of the validator and a block builder, which I want to use for sending the transaction around. Okay, and what else is big in MEV after Ethereum two? So this is just a hint. This is some bigger exploration that will be happening, and I will be researching for sure it's a multi block mev. So nowadays, if you think about mev extraction, it's all about looking at the mempole and maybe finding liquidations that are just about to happen, looking at the discrepancies in the pricing of multiple decentralized exchanges, finding opportunities to equalize the prices within a single block. But you never have a promise that your MEV will work over two blocks because you don't know upfront which miners will include it. And also, there is no transactionality in this, but in Ethereum two with a single validator pool or single validator registered in the registry, we can know in advance sometimes that they got assigned two slots in a row that they'll be creating two or three blocks in a row, one after another, which means that suddenly we can deliver the bundles that say, please execute this only if you have two or three blocks in a row, and execute it such that this happens in one block, this happens in the second block, and this happens in the third block.
00:18:18.624 - 00:19:16.890, Speaker A: And this has the potential of changing entirely some of the DeFi protocols, because they may simply fail in this environment. So what we've explored so far is some of the voting mechanisms may fail. Like, you can deliver the vote, initiate the vote, and then win the vote always, and so on and so on. So I think many of the DeFi protocols will be analyzing that more deeply and checking what kind of changes and redeployments they have to provide to avoid potential negative impact of this multi block meV. But also, it will be quite exciting to see what kind of positive impact the multi block MeV can bring to the network. Maybe there can be some periodical cleaning of some of the protocols that will happen every time this will appear. Okay, and these are my details, and I think here I'm very open to questions.
00:19:34.080 - 00:19:36.510, Speaker B: And reorgs still possible on e two.
00:19:38.020 - 00:20:22.030, Speaker A: So I think there is a very fresh piece of research from Georges and Vitalik about reorgs in if two word, because the if two definition of how you do the attestations or how you vote on the blocks, make the reorgs much less likely or much less viable. So we generally assume that all this noise about reorg attacks or ankle based attacks, this is something that mostly disappear or entirely disappears after the merge. And honey has to be defended against while we're still using proof of work.
00:20:28.390 - 00:21:10.770, Speaker C: I have a question about ethical mev. So, some front running are quite smart and are ethical and in the alignment with the web three, ethics. But there is some mev like sandwiching that is quite bad for the user experience. Does flashboard have a position on that, or any plans to protect a bit, the end user and the newcomers into this ecosystem who are using uniswap or that kind of broadly use dapps?
00:21:11.510 - 00:21:46.310, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So there are a few parts of it. One thing that can be unethical is more like interaction between miners and searchers when miners try to trick the system and steal MEV. Because with the current solution, Ethereum one, it's still possible, unless there are solutions like SgX. And the one way to approach it is by introducing the code of conduct for miners. And miners particularly care about the reputation with flashbots nowadays. So actually, this one slightly more centralized system that is trusted make it much more safer environment for searchers.
00:21:46.310 - 00:22:53.854, Speaker A: This is one place. The other place is looking at the interaction between the searcher and the user of Ethereum, right? So searcher extracting the value together with the miner from the user by sandwiching, by pushing the slippage, and so on and so on. So obviously, we see that as the categorization of the bad and good meV. However, you can start thinking of what kind of problems it introduces when you try to introduce any algorithmical or even worse manual approach of separating those two, because you have to start labeling things as good or bad meV. Like, is it an attack or is it a white hat trying to prevent an attack, right? Because algorithmically, very often, it will look exactly the same, like the white hat moving the funds to their wallet and then announcing that they secure that, and then distributing back to the owner will look like an attack. The attacker might be harder to find the sandwiches. You have to introduce some rules that can be, then it's a constant cat and mouse chasing and replacing.
00:22:53.854 - 00:23:54.600, Speaker A: So in a way, it ends up being feeling much more reasonable to stay neutral wherever it's possible, and assuming that the system and slowly introduce whatever solutions that work and that can improve the quality of MeV, because it's clearly arbitrage that it's needed, that makes the price discovery better operating, that makes all the DeFi protocols to be much more liquidations to happen. Right? We want the liquidations to happen fast, without delays, and so on and so on. But it's a tough problem to actually do that automatically say, okay, this is bad. So suddenly we are starting censoring things. Suddenly we start to be an operator. So it introduces all of the legal follow up of why you actually act and say, what is good, what is wrong.
00:23:57.050 - 00:24:28.110, Speaker C: Yeah, you're falling into the same camps of critics of some web, two social networks that are canceling some politicians or figures, but could it be a community led with the kind of votes on which operation it could be, I don't know, more expensive to execute or with implementing something more technical.
00:24:28.530 - 00:25:52.298, Speaker A: I think the best direction here to go is to make sure that the relay itself becomes a service that can be decentralized, that can be replicated and run by independent relayers that will offer different type of protection or decision making, or maybe like, introduce the dow on deciding what is right, what is wrong, and what they pass and whatnot. I think one of the areas of research for us now, which is MeVSGX, allows for the relayer that can be much more trusted, because by design, it cannot leak the bundle information, which means the searcher remains safe even if they don't trust the relayer because they pass the encrypted bundle. All of this can be verified, then the miner can receive it, can verify it, start mining on it, and only after deliver proof of work. Also based on SGX, they can be sure that they will receive the actual decrypted body. Obviously it uses SGX, which is also always a bit controversial and introduces some latency. But it's one area of exploration of how to improve the general decentralization of the service by not requiring this trust layer that currently is with flashboards. Just flashboards has a lot of trust of both searcher and minor community, and that's why it achieved this hash rate position.
00:25:52.298 - 00:25:53.020, Speaker A: Now.
00:25:56.480 - 00:26:08.624, Speaker D: Yeah, I have a little follow up question. So the fact that currently flashbots only allow including MeV bundles to the start of a block, so then it's a technical decision, not political one.
00:26:08.662 - 00:26:09.152, Speaker A: Right?
00:26:09.286 - 00:26:18.496, Speaker D: So currently it disallows to expect to do a sandwich attack using flash lawns, because no one can produce two block.
00:26:18.528 - 00:26:20.052, Speaker A: In a row, right?
00:26:20.186 - 00:26:33.320, Speaker D: So if you allowed to include bundles not only to the start of the block, but to some place of choice, then it could allow sandwich attacks.
00:26:35.260 - 00:27:13.928, Speaker A: As for placing the bundles wherever in the block. So the bundles construction actually allows you to include any transactions from the mempool within the bundle. So the sandwiching is possible in this way. It always happens within a single block. And we start to talk about multi block mev, because in Ethereum two, it becomes a big thing. Exactly. Because in Ethereum one, it's unpredictable who will be a producer of next block, or maybe even we don't consider this like probabilities of the mining pools having so much of the advantage of producing many blocks in a row that this is relevant for Ethereum one, but in Ethereum two, it's quite clean.
00:27:13.928 - 00:27:17.210, Speaker A: Yes, this will happen. Ac, thanks.
00:27:23.500 - 00:27:47.090, Speaker E: Coming back on the multi block producer mev. So how could you prevent bad impact of multi block mev? How can you still allow good impacts of it? Can you elaborate a little bit more on the good impacts you see?
00:27:48.980 - 00:28:41.024, Speaker A: Yeah, I think whenever we construct a DeFi protocol, and we think that it would be great if I could ensure that it happens one block after another in some specific order, this would be probably good impact, but I wouldn't be able to just bring a good example. But I would love to collect those and hear those being reported to flashbots or any of the research materials. If you ever code something, anything that would work really nice if I had control over many blocks. This is the situation. As for how to avoid the negative impact, I think that's a bit like with flashnose. The community and the technology will learn how to build more robust systems and how to prevent this. And this will be like one more checkpoint when designing the DeFi, and one more thing that will make the whole thing more stable in the long term.
00:28:41.024 - 00:28:50.660, Speaker A: Right? Because in a way, if we really push that far, someone could start introducing strategies like this with a lot of hash power, even nowadays.
00:28:52.940 - 00:28:53.496, Speaker E: Got it.
00:28:53.518 - 00:28:54.090, Speaker A: Thanks.
00:28:58.060 - 00:29:47.450, Speaker F: Thank you. I was just curious, because obviously, you guys are doing really amazing work in the open, in research, which is educating, and like you said, app systems can try to work around making their systems less meb sensitive and so forth. But how realistic, or I guess, also just what sort of things are in the works from what you're learning to make recommendations at layer one protocol, or layer two, or any other things that could be a system that would, whatever extent, reduce mev exposure, even if it's inside of the pool of the flash bots and not outside.
00:29:48.700 - 00:30:01.564, Speaker A: So, some mev exposure are saying it's just very natural and to always be there. This is this arbitrage part where the markets get deregulated, and it's simple arbitrage. It will always be there, and that.
00:30:01.602 - 00:30:04.190, Speaker F: Arbitrage is considered valuable. Right.
00:30:05.440 - 00:31:32.148, Speaker A: Any negative mev, I think this will be coming with the solutions that built on top of Flashbot's infrastructure, or mev infrastructure. So solutions like Kaoswap or others who find a way, I think it's all about what projects will surprise us and say, oh, this is how we solve the things. Like some kind of internal matching engines that avoid slippage on the protocols, and so on and so on. So this education happens, like showing searchers how to be more efficient, but also showing builders and sponsoring the hackathons, and sponsoring the teams that are building on top of MEV, and particularly promoting those projects that show how to make the systems better and the bad MEV not to happen. Also, I think being very active and showing that as an organization, that flashbots actually really cares about the health of the protocol. So I think there was lots of consideration taken when we started talking about the reorgs and showing how much effort we put into showing what defense mechanisms can we build, how quickly can we construct a research effort with top researchers that will tell how we defend, how much time we have, where we go next, what we should keep on the shelf, just in case there are any of the rear corporations from miners, and so on. Because we consider this is harmful for the protocol.
00:31:32.148 - 00:31:50.160, Speaker A: Very deep analysis says we go this way and it's like a negative sum game. Yeah. So it's a combination of the research effort, the research collective, inviting more researchers to the space, hackathons, funding and educating.
00:31:50.660 - 00:32:06.596, Speaker F: Yeah, I mean, one of the challenges for reducing mev, right, is that it's definitely a public good. By definition, you're removing money from the table that somebody who's looking to build a business around.
00:32:06.698 - 00:32:37.320, Speaker A: Yeah. I think the community, in the end, actually, maybe people, when they're given freedom of the protocol, then solo, they want to act as like, okay, that's laying on the table. But whenever we start talking about as a community, on something that lays on the table, but it feels a bit more like a bad mev, then as a community, we immediately will think about how to remove it. And actually there is an agreement that anything that strengthens the protocol and makes it more desirable for user is actually something that is long term valuable.
00:32:37.400 - 00:32:37.848, Speaker F: Yeah.
00:32:37.954 - 00:32:46.304, Speaker A: So I think that this challenge, luckily, in the satirium community as it is now, seems to be something that we deal with quite well.
00:32:46.342 - 00:32:47.410, Speaker F: Thank you very much.
00:32:50.610 - 00:33:07.910, Speaker G: Sorry. So I was just wondering about the latest thinking on multi block inclusion in that sense, and what are the criteria that are kind of being considered as part of the same, as part of the.
00:33:08.060 - 00:33:10.454, Speaker A: Sorry, cannot hear because. Sorry.
00:33:10.492 - 00:33:11.586, Speaker G: The multi bundle inclusion.
00:33:11.618 - 00:33:25.462, Speaker A: Sorry, multi bundle inclusion. So that was something that was introduced in flashback version. .2. Sure. So what are the criteria of multiple?
00:33:25.606 - 00:33:38.746, Speaker G: I was just wondering, I seem to recall that it was almost being done on a greedy basis, if one might call it that, in terms of the inclusion, based on the value extracted as well as the gas limits.
00:33:38.778 - 00:34:31.946, Speaker A: In some sense, it's more like quite simple extension of a single bundle. So you compare the value to the minor of a bundle as compared to the tail of the block, and as long as the bundles keep improving the miner's revenue, they'll be included. However, the miner has a chance to choose how many of the bundles to include in the block and how much of the block space to take. And this really doesn't differ whether it's ethereum one, ethereum two, and as for criteria on in what order they have to be included, they cannot really affect each other. So it has to be that the first bundle doesn't cause any difference in the revenue of the second bundle. So they have to be like disjoint and they sort it in it. And most of the miners will run something like three to five, maximum number of bundles to be included in a block.
00:34:31.946 - 00:34:33.954, Speaker A: Does it answer your question? Because I missed some?
00:34:33.992 - 00:34:42.500, Speaker G: Yeah, I think it does. I mean, I was just wondering if there were any particular criteria or optimizations that were.
00:34:42.950 - 00:35:40.998, Speaker A: There was lots and lots of discussions, I think hours and hours of discussions around how to sort the band offs and how to simulate them, because it introduces latency potentially if sorted perfectly. But some naive algorithms actually were giving quite good results. What's the latest one? The one that was applied actually brings some quite impressive improvement over there was a lot of discussion recently about did the multi bundle affect gas prices a lot on Ethereum? Did it bring the gas prices a lot down because of price gas auction participants not participating for the block space priority anymore because they no longer had to hope that, no longer were fearing that if they miss the single bundle in a block, then they're for sure they'll be excluded, and that every single additional bundle in a block decreases the push for the gas prices growing because of those wars between different bots operating on the network. I've seen some very convincing calculations on.
00:35:41.004 - 00:35:48.460, Speaker G: This one that's interesting. Yeah, especially about the simple optimizations being the best of us. That's pretty cool. Thanks.
00:35:54.170 - 00:36:09.500, Speaker B: So are there any concrete examples of mev opportunities that can utilize the multi block thing? And then also, how is it guaranteed that both transactions will be included in separate blocks? Because I could see ways that miners could exploit that.
00:36:12.110 - 00:37:09.934, Speaker A: So the actual construction doesn't exist yet. We simply mentioned that the multi block mev will be probably something big, and that we really invite people to explore it, research and give examples. I think that one potential solution to ensure that both transactions are included is that you only make a payment to the miner if you can verify that the state in the second block is as expected after the first block. So one can introduce the conditional execution and then the miner can. Miner or validator can simulate both blocks in a row and check if that payment happens, and then they can compare the bundles. So it happens the same way as simulation of a single block. Nowadays in ethereum one, but in ethereum two, what will be needed? Every bundle that spans over multiple blocks will have to be simulated over multiple blocks, and then it's guaranteed that the first one doesn't really provide any value if executed by itself, like doesn't unlock the opportunity.
00:37:09.934 - 00:37:26.610, Speaker A: There are some risks as the bundle will be split by the validator the same way nowadays, like the validator or miner could potentially split the bundle into chunks and act maliciously against the searcher against this code of conduct. But this remains unchanged.
00:37:27.270 - 00:37:34.440, Speaker B: And also, how much of MeV is going to the searchers versus the miners, and how does that differ depending on the opportunity?
00:37:34.890 - 00:37:46.790, Speaker A: So this is an interesting question, because I was checking. There are two dashboards available for flashbots. One is called explore flashbots. Net, and the other one is called dashboards flashbots.
00:37:46.870 - 00:37:47.114, Speaker C: Net.
00:37:47.152 - 00:38:34.460, Speaker A: And they give insights into multiple statistics about the network behavior and also like the searcher operations. And I'm yet to confirm the number that I've seen today on this dashboard, because we've introduced it recently, which shows 83% going to searchers. And I can't believe that, because in our internal conversations there were totally opposite numbers. They mentioned that 7% goes to searchers and 93% to miners. So I wouldn't like to confuse you. This is something to check on the dashboards in the soon future, because many people are asking actually what the speed is, and we really wonder what it will be in Ethereum too, like how much of the value validators will take. My intuition is that the validators end up with like 90 x percent of the value, but it might be different.
00:38:35.710 - 00:38:36.460, Speaker G: Cool.
00:38:37.550 - 00:38:39.100, Speaker B: Does anyone else have a question?
00:38:47.560 - 00:38:50.150, Speaker A: Any other questions? Yeah.
00:38:52.860 - 00:39:01.130, Speaker H: Sorry, we just got here. So I don't know if it's been discussed. Why do you think Ethereum doesn't take steps to actually eliminate the minor extractable value?
00:39:01.900 - 00:39:30.500, Speaker A: I simply think it's not something that can be eliminated because it's natural. It's like in traditional markets, MeV always exists. And as for this considered bad, evil MeV, which is related to the protocols allowing for the sleepage push and so on, the community wants that to be removed and there will be work to do that. It's just sometimes very challenging to remove it. So everyone wants it to be removed.
00:39:31.880 - 00:39:45.800, Speaker H: It's not that challenging if you think of some other protocols that mark transactions as they come in, so you don't let the reorder happen when they get picked up from the mempool. I mean, you could technically remove the at least limit it quite a lot.
00:39:45.950 - 00:40:26.736, Speaker A: So we've seen examples and maybe coming to one of the questions before, like layer two and side chains and so on, so on layer two. There were approaches with vdfs and so on, like saying that the transaction ordering has to happen blindly and then it has to be followed. It actually leads to many, many other complications. There are increased latency to the transaction execution, and also there is still some possibilities of generate multiple things in parallel and pick the best one. It's being explored. Yeah. Any research opportunity to give those further exploration.
00:40:26.736 - 00:41:05.596, Speaker A: I don't think this is possible without big, big compromise on the quality of the protocol and its swiftness and how quickly it operates. But things will be introduced, there will be multiple teams working on it and improving. And when we see sequencers on layer two, they are centralized. They can extract mev themselves. Right. So does it mean that they remove meV? No. I think we've seen this announcement now from optimist saying that until decentralized, the sequencer on Optimus will be collecting mev value and distributing it to the community, to protocols.
00:41:05.596 - 00:41:23.000, Speaker A: A bit like putting it into charity on this retroactive community funding, the public good funding. So these are examples of what people are exploring. They want to remove mev, or at least they want to use it well by the time it's removed.
00:41:24.060 - 00:41:25.050, Speaker H: Thank you.
00:41:40.840 - 00:41:43.696, Speaker E: That was quite intense. Thank you very much, Thomas.
00:41:43.808 - 00:41:45.110, Speaker A: Thank you very much.
00:41:51.900 - 00:42:53.640, Speaker E: So, for the late kids in the classroom, unfortunately, we have to wrap up. I think tonight was quite amazing, hearing from SSV, decentralized validation on staking east two from Lido, liquid staking, Vasili and obviously Thomas from east to Mev. And what's the future mev on Ethereum? Again, like, we are skills we company that run validators on e two, we support Lido. We're one of the nine providers supporting Lido. And we also staking for enterprises and any people that want to stake e two. And many of our team were here tonight and I think we were kind of mind blown by what we saw. So I hope other people in the audience had the same feelings.
00:42:53.640 - 00:42:55.130, Speaker E: Thank you again very much for coming.
