00:00:00.200 - 00:00:59.064, Speaker A: Restaking is actually, like, solve, like, one of the problem that new projects and protocols have. It's their need of for security actually very, like, complicated. Like, to build a community of value, to build and to maintain a community of validators. But ide layers, who invented, like, this concept of free staking, is building, like, this decentralized marketplace of trust where multiple projects that they call AV's in the Eigen layer world can plug two benefits from this security. And it's really cool because AV's can benefit from this security when restakers. You and me can also benefit from it by getting, like, more rewards. So it's kind of like a win win situation, like, for everyone.
