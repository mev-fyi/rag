00:00:00.280 - 00:00:37.376, Speaker A: We're using a very simple, like, design. So we have a staking script. So if you have your idle bitcoin, fundamentally you have a Utxo address. And what we advise right now, because, again, this technology is very experimental. So whoever wants to stake, make sure you just play with a fraction of the stake. So fundamentally, what you're doing is you're first moving a part of your bitcoin to a new Utxo, so you're not, like, really playing with your bitcoin wealth address. Now, whenever you have this fractional Utxo, you're coming in and you're basically signing a staking script, which has your Utxo address, which contains the bitcoin.
00:00:37.376 - 00:00:54.880, Speaker A: And it has two other parameters, which is the duration of the lock, as well as you're pre signing, a power that if you delegate your bitcoin for staking the validator to whom you are delegating, if he double signs, then you can slash the bitcoin.
