00:00:00.600 - 00:00:46.245, Speaker A: Morpho started with a protocol called morphozmander, which was an optimization protocol on top of AAVE and Compound. So AVE and Compound are lending and bond protocols. And we built a layer on top of those protocols that was composing on top of their smart contract, where if you use this layer instead of AAVE directly, you would get better rates on AAVE while getting the same liquidity, the same risk parameters, et cetera, et cetera. And just to give the brief intuition on how it works, on AAVE you have a large spread between the lending rate and the borrowing rate. And on Morpho, essentially we would map users. So let's say lending rate was at 1% and borrowing rate was at 3%. On Morpho you would get the mid rate than just 2%.
00:00:46.245 - 00:00:54.705, Speaker A: And so lenders and borrowers would get a better deal. And if there is no one to match with impure peer, they would fall back to the AAVE protocol.
