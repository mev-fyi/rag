00:00:00.250 - 00:00:52.650, Speaker A: So an optimistic rollup is a rollup where the canonical bridge does not generate a validity proof of the correctness of a state transition from the transactions wherein it asserts its state on an L one through a bridging mechanism that is optimistic. There is the sequencer writes the the purported block header or purported state to the L one, and then there's a fraud proof window wherein watchers of that network can submit challenges if the state purported by the sequencer is incorrect. So really, zk roll ups and optimistic roll ups are both bridging mechanisms for validity roll up signs, for sovereign roll up signs. And so a validity roll up or a zk roll up use proofs, in essence, to assert their state on the L one. In an optimistic roll up, you did an optimistic.
