00:00:03.210 - 00:00:18.430, Speaker A: Great stuff. Hi, everyone. Thank you all so much for coming. It's a pleasure to see you all. So I'm Ernest from Kiln. I'm one of the co founders, chief product officer. It's really great every year to see everyone at EBCC.
00:00:18.430 - 00:00:58.586, Speaker A: It's the most wonderful time of the year. That's not Christmas, it's EBCC. And we have an amazing panel right now with the leaders in the custodian market. Right, so I'm sure you all know, but custodians are the companies and technology services that we use to secure digital assets. And we have lots of different flavors of custodians here and the leaders in the market. So thanks so much to you guys for coming. And we're going to talk about the custody market, what everyone on the panel does in terms of different offerings and specifically about staking.
00:00:58.586 - 00:01:35.130, Speaker A: Right? Because kiln, we're a staking company. We're interested in understanding together what the staking landscape looks like for custodians. So that's kind of going to be our team, probably half hour max for this discussion, and then we'll have some time for questions at the end. So please keep your questions and make sure to ask them at the end. So, just to kick things off, can we do a quick round robin intros? If you could each give a quick introduction on yourselves and your company, and very briefly, how you position yourselves in the market. Sorry, Alessio, please start.
00:01:35.200 - 00:02:22.010, Speaker B: All right, so, Alessio Kaglini, I'm the founder and CEO of Hextrust. Hextrust is a licensed institutional custodian. We're born in 2018 in Hong Kong, so I would say one of the longest standing companies in the blockchain space. We started as a pure custodian in the B two b space. And right now we already offer a variety of services, including all the connectivity to d five, web, three on ramp, off ramp, and a number of staking services as well. We are on the regulated and compliant side of things. So we have licenses as of today in Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Europe, in Italy, and very soon in France and in the Bahamas.
00:02:22.010 - 00:02:50.130, Speaker B: And we operate the business from these jurisdictions, especially offering different types of financial services from these jurisdictions. Myself, I'm italian, just flew in from Hong Kong, an engineer by background. But maybe, interestingly, I used to work for the regulator before starting my career in finance. So I think probably I have a little bit of a different flavor on the perspectives of how I see the blockchain world developing.
00:02:51.030 - 00:02:52.206, Speaker A: Great. Sergio.
00:02:52.318 - 00:02:52.594, Speaker B: Hi.
00:02:52.632 - 00:03:31.034, Speaker C: I'm Sergio Silva. I lead a web3 bd at Fireblocks. We are a digital asset self custody provider. So for all the institutions that require wallets, that do not use a regulated custodian, that obviously not your keys, not your coins, they use fireblocks technology to manage their keys access staking through partnerships such as the one we have killing. We have 1800 institutional clients all around the world. We have offices in Europe, New York, Israel, a couple of other countries that I'm forgetting. And personally, I spent twelve years on Wall street, started my career at Goldman Sachs, and then I went to Barclays and I moved over to fireblocks.
00:03:31.034 - 00:03:38.900, Speaker C: Two years ago, I started. I built out the Latin America sales team first, and now again, web3, and we're a five year old company.
00:03:39.990 - 00:03:42.174, Speaker A: Great. Athena.
00:03:42.222 - 00:03:57.110, Speaker D: Yeah. Sava. Good afternoon, everyone. This is Athena. So I'm representing Sifu. So many people may not know Sifu very well, but we were formerly binance custodian. So we are new brand, but just rebranded from Binance.
00:03:57.110 - 00:04:53.510, Speaker D: So we are actually quite new to this space. And I think today I'm the only custodian solution that is backed by an exchange is a little bit different from the other custodian solutions. So compared with other solutions, what we are best is really to providing the bridging between custodian and the exchange so that we can provide the best liquidity and also security for the client who want to put their asset in the cold storage, but at the same time mirror them to the exchange, like binance, to provide them the best liquidity. So personally, I have been in binance for five years, so quite old here. And before, actually I was heading the NFT team and also the fiat business, global business. So before binance, I really have a very diverse background. So before binance, I was educated in London, and then I was working for the UN for the developing finance.
00:04:53.510 - 00:05:01.210, Speaker D: So very happy to share the experiences about blockchain, custodian and web3 today with all the panelists and audiences.
00:05:02.210 - 00:05:02.862, Speaker A: Great.
00:05:02.996 - 00:05:04.986, Speaker B: Daniel Bourgeois.
00:05:05.098 - 00:05:49.014, Speaker E: I'm Daniel from Metamask. Institutional, within consensus, a little different. We're actually not a custodian, but we do act as a connectivity lever between these different types of providers. Funny, before consensus, I used to work for Swift. And you probably all think Swift is just like a payments network, right? Yeah, it kind of is, but actually, like 50% to 70% of the activity on the Swift network is actually messages around security, settlement and reconciliation, right? And if you think about, if, you know, the securities kind of ecosystem, very diverse players, you got investment managers, custodians, broker dealers, central security depositories, exchanges. And really, if they all had to operate in like a many to many integration kind of framework, you wouldn't be able to buy a stock or a bond.
00:05:49.062 - 00:05:49.370, Speaker D: Right.
00:05:49.440 - 00:06:09.250, Speaker E: So when you think about the way that we're approaching web3, our mission with Metamask Institutional is to provide that same type of connectivity layer. So we maintain parity with metamask, and our mission is to provide unrivaled access to DFI, but with convenient custodial integrations. With many of our friends here, actually.
00:06:09.320 - 00:06:10.434, Speaker A: Yeah, most of them.
00:06:10.552 - 00:06:36.794, Speaker E: And in fact, as well, now that we're thinking about staking, really solving that matching problem as well. Right, so you can work with any custodian and any staking provider effectively. Right? And Quibono, who benefits? I think everyone. Right. So our customers get best in class custodial providers. Best in class staking providers, like kiln. Of course, the custodians have the benefit that they get to work with all these different staking providers without costly one off integrations always.
00:06:36.794 - 00:06:44.080, Speaker E: And then similarly, the staking service providers have access to our custodial. You know, we're really here for all of you.
00:06:44.610 - 00:06:45.786, Speaker A: Nice, Daniel.
00:06:45.818 - 00:07:29.594, Speaker F: Awesome. So I'm also Daniel, great name. So I'm a senior product manager overseeing our coin listing and staking product at Bitco. So Bitco is a regulated wallet platform. Along with us being a qualified custodian globally, everywhere we have licenses, we have a South Dakota trust license that allows us to operate globally to give all of our customers, especially the institutions, the right, the compliance approvals and all the regulated aspects, especially now institutions, they can't just oftentimes just manage their own keys. So they have to look for a regulated custodian who offers insurance as well as other services like staking, metamask institutions, some DeFi access as well as riskless trade that we have through bitco prime. And for myself, I've been in the fintech space for the last six years.
00:07:29.594 - 00:07:34.986, Speaker F: So anything around technology and how money moves, I've always been interested in, and I'm glad to be on this panel.
00:07:35.178 - 00:07:58.774, Speaker A: Nice. Thanks so much, guys, for the intro. So let's dive in a little bit into staking. Right? So I'm sure probably everyone knows. So very briefly, staking is the act of helping to participate in the security of blockchains. Right? You commit collateral to help these funds secure and propose new transactions. Sorry.
00:07:58.774 - 00:08:43.250, Speaker A: Propose new blocks and confirm transactions. And so sometimes at kiln, we talk about this as sort of the most natural reward source in crypto because you're helping to secure the blockchain and getting a reward from doing that. So maybe to dive into this topic a little bit. Maybe. And Sergio, let's start with you, because I know you have some info on this. How would you see the demand for staking from your customers? What kind of different flavors of staking are they interested in? Which networks? And how has that demand changed over time? For example, with big protocol upgrades like Chappella, which feels like years ago, but it was a few months ago. Yeah.
00:08:43.250 - 00:08:45.566, Speaker A: How would you qualify the staking demand?
00:08:45.678 - 00:09:31.326, Speaker C: Sure. So for us at fireblocks, and again, we power self custodial solutions for clients using NPC technology. Really depends on the institution that we're talking about when they're looking into staking. Certainly the upgrades, Chappella, and just the overall broader infrastructure, more secure that's being provided by the market has helped more institutions come into the staking space and get more comfortable with it. Regulation continues to be something that's top of mind. But as you said, given that this is the most native reward, most native yield, you can actually explain where the yield is coming from. You definitely see growing interest in participating in crypto this way, from traditional, even non financial institutions.
00:09:31.326 - 00:10:18.066, Speaker C: So not a staking customer of ours, but I love to use them for an example of who's doing this. Deutsche telecom. Right. Gigantic telecom provider that are staking ether and matic and some other chains, because they see the opportunity to participate and to grow within crypto this way. And so we see both financial institutions not really in the states, too big right now because of everything that's happening, but definitely interested in outside of the states, in coming in, participating, and actually being able to say, I am a native crypto player now, and not just taking it as Defi. And that's for native staking. On the liquid staking side, we see more of, like, the defi players, right? Obviously, liquid staking is more of a defi play, and so the traditional crypto hedge funds are the ones mostly involved in that.
00:10:18.066 - 00:10:55.098, Speaker C: I don't think we saw too much of a drop off on staking as we did in just traditional defi yield farming. On the flip side, with liquid stake and all these tokens that come out, really continue to see very high level growth and different primitives that are being built on top of that. So it's been moving in the right direction, and I think we'll continue to see that just growing. Maybe not so fast as everybody was expecting the dual market happen to everything, but definitely from long term players that are here for the right reasons and thinking 510 years. Really positive trends.
00:10:55.194 - 00:11:06.954, Speaker A: Yeah. And I think especially if these companies are long exposed to these assets, they often think they might as well stake because they're holding a long position. You might as well compound your position over the long term.
00:11:07.002 - 00:11:15.730, Speaker C: Correct. And it's just native right. On the end of the day, that's what really matters and you can explain it, which is super important for investors and for the management boards and everybody that's involved.
00:11:16.650 - 00:11:21.400, Speaker A: Great. Anyone anything to add on the demand you're seeing from your customers?
00:11:21.930 - 00:12:08.758, Speaker D: Yes, just echo to his point because different with Fireblock. So for us we are actually a centralized custodian so we are not really serving as an info. But I see actually also a growing trend on the demand side that more and more especially the tradefi client, they actually become interested in the space because it's very well explained to them. They are very easy to understand and because it's the passive interest that they can get from putting their token in. And however, I think the unclarity of the regulation still play a very big hurdle for them to really moving in. But I see they're actually moving slowly and quietly doing some research on coming into that space. So I think what they're going to expect is a different kind of options.
00:12:08.758 - 00:12:38.000, Speaker D: And also I always say that they want to achieve a balance between their security with their liquidity and yield they can get. Although maybe just using staking is not really a very high yield stuff that they can expect. This is actually part of their alternative investments portfolio that they can diversify their risk, which is very helpful for them to come into the space. So this is where I see like it's slowly, slowly develop, but very definitely a growing trend I can see.
00:12:38.530 - 00:12:39.182, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:12:39.316 - 00:13:05.782, Speaker F: Yeah, I would echo that where on the institutional side because they are very regulated. I think explaining staking to them at a high level is very easy to do. But once you start getting to the nuances, because every chain is different enough, that causes a lot of headache. That's where everyone here has the opportunity to kind of explain it. It's kind of an education thing where staking makes sense. You're putting collateral scare network. But once you get down to the nitty gritty, that's where it gets different.
00:13:05.782 - 00:13:47.794, Speaker F: And trying to abstract it away and make it very easy for the user is key for the institutions. And on top of that, what they kind of need is a lot of reporting where because every chain is different, having a uniform standard of explaining how rewards are generated. How you claim it, how you get it back is very key to increase adoption. As you mentioned with Chappella, we've seen like a huge upswing in ETH coming in, but then that led to a lot of confusion of there's an activation cube. What is that? Why is it 46, 47 days unstaking? What is that slashing? Why is that even a thing? So explain that. All for the institution is very key to making sure we increase the adoption. Keep going along with that on the exchange side, because we also do well platform.
00:13:47.794 - 00:14:20.000, Speaker F: It's kind of the flip side, where the exchanges, what they care about is, can you give us very generic APIs so we could make staking as a service? I know a lot of players are trying to do that, and especially for regulated exchanges, they kind of need that where not only do you need the right license to operate in specific regions, but having the right APIs, having the right reporting and having the right capabilities to offer this to their end users. Because like institutions, they're also going to be hit if their regulators come after them because they didn't do their proper due diligence or offer something that wasn't correct.
00:14:20.930 - 00:14:47.090, Speaker E: If I could echo just. Yeah, totally. To echo the part about reporting and portfolio management, I think the explanation and the demonstration that to a lot of these institutions is key. I mean, there's obviously a lot of Degen style funds that very natively get this and have been doing it for some time, but we are seeing increasingly new entrants and more traditional kind of financial institutions. If you want to feel good, you probably already do feel good. If you're feverishly refreshing, you're doing analytics pages. You know, people are staking.
00:14:47.090 - 00:15:05.200, Speaker E: But for us at least, we've perceived that over the past few months, in combination of direct and liquid staking protocols, we've seen the percentage or the proportion of staking activity in metamask institutional go from virtually negligible to about a third of our total activity since Chappella. So good job everyone.
00:15:05.970 - 00:15:14.740, Speaker A: Wow. A third of the total activity on the product is related, close to wow. That's great to hear. Cool.
00:15:15.750 - 00:16:25.826, Speaker B: Maybe just to wrap it up, a couple of use cases that I think have been coming to the market in the last few months. So the first one, obviously, after the failure of a number of exchanges, obviously exchanges were the main platforms where most of the, especially the retail, but also the institutional staking was taking place. So we've seen really a transfer of staking from how it is done on exchanges to native staking so I don't know how everybody's familiar, but basically, when you stake on an exchange, you're not really staking. You're lending to the exchange, then the exchange puts all the funds together, and then if they want, if they decide to do so, they stake, or they do probably something else, and they offer you a similar yield to staking. This model is kind of dying because people are not really trusting exchanges that much anymore. And they're moving to native staking, where you have your wallet either via a self custody solution or via a custodian. Or it can be a retail wallet or institutional wallet, and you stake directly to a staking provider or to somebody like kild.
00:16:25.826 - 00:17:20.710, Speaker B: So this is the first use case which has been taking shape in the last few months. And the second one mean, we've all heard about the etfs and how important is the application of Blackrock ETF, or fidelity or Embesco. But people are wondering why, for example, a spot ETF is so much more important than an ETF that is based on CME futures. Well, I mean, this is a very simple use case, right? So an ETH ETF based on CME futures cannot provide you the yield that is offered by the blockchain from a staking perspective. Right. So you're basically investing into something where you need to, first of all, pay the futures curve, which is usually upwards, and you're losing something like 5% to 10% a year. And on top of that, you cannot even extract the staking yield.
00:17:20.710 - 00:17:27.078, Speaker B: So having a spot ETF will actually spur the demand for on chain staking.
00:17:27.174 - 00:17:32.554, Speaker A: Because the assets will be actually held by the ETF. Unlike a futures ETF, where it's a synthetic instrument.
00:17:32.682 - 00:17:44.666, Speaker B: Exactly. That will be held in a wallet. And obviously, if the ETF allows investors to have that exposure, then those ETH in the wallet that will be staked to some staking notes.
00:17:44.778 - 00:18:19.530, Speaker A: Yeah, that's interesting. And just to plus one, your point on the risk from staking via exchanges. I think the SEC complaint against Kraken, it was quite clear that sending funds to the exchange when there is no transparency about how these funds would get used, how they're going to get staked, and when the exchange has discretion over what reward rate is going to get paid out and when. And that's the thing that is riskier than doing things in a more kind of open and transparent way.
00:18:19.680 - 00:18:19.946, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:19.968 - 00:18:38.014, Speaker B: I mean, riskiness is something, right? But the other part is, I think what the SEC was really about is the fact that it's not really a staking. But it's a common investment scheme where everybody puts money into something, and then there's an asset manager that decides how to allocate those funds to investment strategies.
00:18:38.142 - 00:19:07.866, Speaker A: Yeah. Cool. So, shifting gears a little bit, I'm curious for your take on how do you decide within your companies and product roadmaps what to build versus partner on? And maybe we can use also this question for you guys to give a quick overview of what are the big things you're working on. What does your roadmap look like? Any alpha you can share with the room on what's coming up? Anyone can take this one.
00:19:08.048 - 00:19:51.074, Speaker C: I'll jump on. Yeah. So at Fireblocks, we have staking partners with killing and another one of the competitors. We have one click staking directly from your Fireblocks workspace. So again, this is a self custodial workspace that's secured with MPC technology, where Fireblocks doesn't have access to your keyshards, only you have access to your keyshards. And you can go on our staking portal, select either ether or Solana, and directly deposit through our partners. But using your wallet native staking, we also provide API staking for a handful of other different chains, and we're working on making that also one click direct staking via the interface.
00:19:51.074 - 00:20:16.114, Speaker C: And how do we choose to build it? We go by customer demand. That's really what's our north star. We talk a lot with our clients. We're very, very lucky that we have leading DeFi funds as clients as well as big financial institutions. And so we get a really broad view of the ecosystem and what's coming on board and the interest that comes ahead. And so we take that. We take a lot of feedback and just decide what needs to be built.
00:20:16.114 - 00:20:46.522, Speaker C: And then we look at the landscape, and if there's providers that are market leading, that fit really are. Obviously security is top of mind for us. So I would say top ten things that we look at. The first seven are security security, and we find that they've really been value added to our clients through fireblocks. And we choose to partner, and we're really happy with the partnership we built so far. What's coming for the roadmap? Like I mentioned, we're doing one click staking for more chains. And we're always open to feedback as to what else clients want.
00:20:46.522 - 00:20:49.514, Speaker C: And we'll go out, and if there's enough demand, we'll build it.
00:20:49.712 - 00:20:50.460, Speaker B: Awesome.
00:20:50.830 - 00:20:57.934, Speaker A: Alessio. Actually, I think you guys have an interesting angle where you also run some validators in some cases, yeah.
00:20:57.972 - 00:21:50.800, Speaker B: We basically have three variables that we need to work with. The first one is whether we offer staking directly, kind of one click staking directly from the platform, or the second option is whether we use something like Metamask, institutional wallet, connect to basically connect to other platforms that allow staking. And the third variable is whether we operate our own node or we outsource this kind of node infrastructure to some of our providers. The way we decide across these three variables is basically or less the same about client demand and where client demand a little bit tactically and strategically, where we see actually the market going and developing and which protocols and areas we think that will be successful in the future.
00:21:54.610 - 00:22:32.666, Speaker F: As custodians, I would kind of echo the same thing. We also are very driven by customer demand. The whole point of staking, as I mentioned, is very complex. So the question is how do you make it very easy and seamless, which start with like one click staking reporting we have nine chains that we offer close to one click staking as we can. We also have MMI integration, so if they want to do defi staking, they could go through with that. But to your question of how does this drive our product roadmap or what is it ultimately from the institutional side, customers kind of come to us. We have a couple of validator partners, but ultimately the customer comes to us initially with kind of the validators that they have in mind.
00:22:32.666 - 00:23:05.400, Speaker F: And kind of what we're trying to plan out is we care about the institution and customers. So the question is, which partners are offering the best rate? Like kiln offers great rates on certain chains, others might be better in everything, and it's just offering that data to the clients to give them the best informed opinion. And there are chains where some partners just don't operate. So for those chains, we give customers the option to select other partners that they might not have thought about, but has availability on those chains. And that kind of helps drive our business strategy and product strategy as well, of what to kind of build next.
00:23:06.090 - 00:23:06.886, Speaker A: Makes sense.
00:23:06.988 - 00:23:52.278, Speaker D: Daniel Ratina so at CIfU, because we are operating as full custodian rather than a self custodian. So over the past two years, we have been actually moving from a fully centralized solution to a semi decentralized solution because of the client starting to lose trust over fully centralized exchanges as FTX collapse. So I think we are in a very low level of the trust right now to the centralized exchange. This is where after the FTX collapse. So a lot of the current market makers. And from trading on binance, they want to move to custodian solution where they can also have the access to the binance liquidity. So still this is the key product that we are keep building.
00:23:52.278 - 00:24:50.934, Speaker D: However, on the staking side, we start to see very big demand from the layer one, layer twos, and also some of the VC fund we are serving to have that kind of a passive interest gain from the native staking. So this is why from the last year, we started to put a lot of resources on developing the native staking solutions. So we're also actually in the process of working with some external staking partners like Colleen and also others, to try to expand our optionality to the client so that they can actually just putting their asset in the cold storage. They don't need to move it, but they also don't need to just put in idle. At the same time, they can gain all the interest from the onchain native staking. So we are currently only working with six blockchains, but we are going to expand further and further. But we want to make sure that we provide them the options for them to delegate, fully delegate where they also have all the options to redelegate to any validator from the blockchain.
00:24:50.934 - 00:25:02.378, Speaker D: So I'm recently working with Polygon. And so they also roll out their DKE EVM solution, which is very popular. So we keep just like innovation in this kind of space going forward.
00:25:02.464 - 00:25:03.350, Speaker A: Really exciting.
00:25:03.510 - 00:25:25.426, Speaker E: Yeah, I'd say we kind of have two kind of partners. We have partners in the family. We partner with Metamask. Right? So we have parity with Metamask. If you can stake with Metamask, you can stake with metamask institutionals. That's popular for a number of liquid staking protocols. On the other side, we have this wonderful community that we love to work with here in that we really want to solve that matching problem that exists again in traditional investment.
00:25:25.426 - 00:25:56.474, Speaker E: If I'm an investment manager, I don't want to have to choose between whether like Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs is my broker dealer. I don't want to have to choose whether State street or northern trust is my custodian. I want the best of all worlds. And to that end, I think on each side we try to find these excellent partners. So when it comes to custody, we want to give users the choice of MPC HSM. Is it a licensed custodian? Is it a smart contract wallet? Is it a multi sig? You don't necessarily have to choose. You may have different instances where you want to use these different players, maybe also regional support if you're a global institution.
00:25:56.474 - 00:26:30.658, Speaker E: On the staking service provider side, we love working with folks with excellent track records, decent amount of TVL security certifications, number of chains offered. And I guess the one place where we're really endeavoring to improve is to, if they offer it, we want to be able to let them offer it through us, right? So if your staking service provider allows you to pick different clouds, is it Google, Aws, Azure, different regions for the location your validators are specifying them, every lays we want in the coming months to be able to reflect, much like we have parity with Metamask, to have parity with our custodial partners and our staking service providers.
00:26:30.834 - 00:26:52.800, Speaker A: And I will give a shout out to you guys. Defined an API standard for node operators to integrate with. That was really nice for exactly this kind of reason, like kind of specifying customization options. See Johanne here as well. Basically led that project. So yeah, it's great to hear that you're looking to expand that to additional customizations as well.
00:26:53.570 - 00:26:53.982, Speaker B: Cool.
00:26:54.036 - 00:27:15.558, Speaker A: So maybe last question, what are you guys know if we zoom out a little bit out of staking, what are you guys excited about in the industry at the moment? What are you planning for this week in Paris? Any exciting plans or things you're looking out for? Maybe? Daniel, do you want to start this?
00:27:15.644 - 00:27:37.646, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm excited. We're metamask Institutional. There's more than one type of institution out there, right? And I think folks talk a lot about diversity of different staking service providers for the good of Ethereum. But I think for the good of us becoming like a mainstream technology, we're going to have to increasingly start to engage different types of institutions. So funds are great. If you want to make money, please call us. We'll definitely work with you.
00:27:37.646 - 00:28:07.458, Speaker E: But additionally, I'm interested in a number of markets I see where there are positive regulatory developments. I think a lot about Brazil. For instance, they have this huge exchange, Mercado bitcoin that's offered staking for a year. But recently some really cool developments in terms of the clarity they have from a regulatory perspective. I've seen a new bank is the fastest growing digital bank, I think, in the world and they're signed with our friends fireblocks here, or XP is the biggest broker dealer. Think of like the Scott trade of Brazil. They're signed with our friends bitco.
00:28:07.458 - 00:28:50.282, Speaker E: So it's very nice to see these type of traditional institutions entering and thinking about how we can support them. And then I guess the real wild card is I keep thinking about we work with a lot of folks in the NFT space and it's been like, I don't know, like 1927 months that a lot of brands are doing things with NFTs. Cool token gated experience and brand loyalty initiatives and customer engagement. That's great. But they're doing it strictly from the front of office ecommerce sales marketing side. And if they were doing something that generated for instance, I mean these things are often making proceeds in ETH and Maddox. If they were doing it and the proceeds were us dollars or euros on the back end they would have a corporate treasury strategy wherein they would be buying bonds and commercial paper and hedging out of those positions.
00:28:50.282 - 00:29:10.380, Speaker E: So I'm really excited to see, I don't know if it happens in three months or twelve months but it seems inevitable as a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders that if they are generating these proceeds through engaging in web3 that they start to have an approach for generating yield with these assets. And I think staking as we've all noticed is that kind of low risk rated return for them.
00:29:10.830 - 00:29:24.954, Speaker A: Yeah there was that Nike NFT drop that made them like tens of millions, I forget the exact amount yield on that. Right, let's take that. Anyone else? What are you excited about Paris wise?
00:29:25.002 - 00:30:04.110, Speaker F: I was here last Friday for Basil day so that was really awesome. Very lit, literally. I never saw that before. So highly recommend next year, but for bitco. It's funny you mentioned the Nike NFTs because we were helping them out with that. So what I'm excited about is kind of two front because more on kind of the b to B to c side, like how to help them build the infrastructure to do these kind of like NFT drops or how to help them with kind of the web3 strategy which is still kind of up in the air because especially for NFTs because of what happened last year. It's still unclear what corporate brands and these Fortune 500 companies want to do but we want to be ready for them depending on how the regulations or what they're strategizing with.
00:30:04.110 - 00:31:05.762, Speaker F: What I'm more tactically more excited about is as a wallet platform company we kind of offer multiple wallets. We have our custodial where bitco manage the keys and provide insurance for customers who just compliance wise and regulatory need a custodian to manage it. We also have a hot wallet solution more for exchanges or like hedge funds who just need very quick access but a very programmatic access to do so. We also have something called on prem wallets, where certain customers, based on regulations, need to have a cold wallet, but also needs to, also needs to have their keys self managed. So there's a lot of complexities around that and I think we have a potential way to kind of can't share too much secret around that, but I think we have a potential way of offering a good solutions for them that way. Whether you need a custodian to hold your keys, hold your keys online, or hold your keys in a cold manner, but in your own soil, that's kind of what we're excited for. That way customers have whatever options they need, either from a coin perspective and also from like a wallet key signing or key management perspective as well.
00:31:05.762 - 00:31:07.378, Speaker F: So that's what I'm really excited about.
00:31:07.464 - 00:31:10.334, Speaker A: That's great. When you want to launch this product, this room is yours.
00:31:10.382 - 00:31:11.026, Speaker F: Oh, perfect.
00:31:11.128 - 00:31:12.334, Speaker A: The painting is Paris.
00:31:12.382 - 00:32:13.158, Speaker C: Now I'll triple down on the web3 stuff. Obviously I'm a web3 guy. The JPEGs took me away from the traditional trading desk after twelve years. Yeah, no, we're really excited to see kind of like non financial companies come into the space, do it for the right reasons, really try to understand what value unlocks come from using nfts and different mechanics and the like to technology to really tap into this whole new world of consumers living in the digital world. I think at the end of the day, our main clients will continue to be financial institutions, but we have a growing number of non financial companies that are coming to us and saying, hey, we might never really touch ether, but we want to use blockchain rails for XYZ things. And given our technology is very, very flexible that we support 44 blockchains, you can spin up wallets via API in a second. We're coming out with noncustodial wallets as well, which are something we're really, really excited about.
00:32:13.158 - 00:32:45.118, Speaker C: So just really giving clients all the tools they need to explore blockchain beyond the financial or the speculation pieces, which obviously are a lot of fun and we all enjoy them, but I really believe mass adoption will come from people being able to use tokens as more than just betting vehicles. And then a lot of events this week. Just excited to back in Paris, personally studied here a couple of summers when I was younger and then I got engaged here a few years ago, so Paris feels like the european home, so just happy to be here. Jet lag and all.
00:32:45.284 - 00:32:46.910, Speaker B: Must have been romantic.
00:32:47.650 - 00:33:02.994, Speaker C: It was not romantic at all. So I was 13, the first time I came here and I saw a couple get engaged, I shumped them all. And I was like, I need to do that when I get engaged. So fast forward 20 years later and I'm there down on one knee and all these people selling me roses and champagne bottles and I ruined the picture.
00:33:03.042 - 00:33:03.842, Speaker A: Selfie sticks.
00:33:03.906 - 00:33:08.978, Speaker C: Selfie sticks, yeah. But 13 year old Mia is probably proud.
00:33:09.154 - 00:33:46.670, Speaker D: So I'm based in Paris, but actually I already here for one year, but I think this week talking about Paris and really loving to treat all my friends with some croissants and also learning practice my French. But apart from there, I think my mission is really about just one word. It's about mass adoption. I think currently our industry is a very tough time. No matter it's really regarding the regulatory environment or about every complicated things developings in the industry. But I still believe that it is actually still like we are in an uptrend. So we are just still in the process of the uptrend.
00:33:46.670 - 00:34:51.366, Speaker D: But I think lower the barrier for no matter the trade, five people or even the web, two people to come into the space is extremely important. So at C four, where at Binance, what we really our top priority is always to create a very simple product, very simple solution to let them come in, no matter to the extent of education, lower the barrier or just some simplified, for example KYC kyb solutions or security solution to let them understand the technology before using that. I think right now a lot of technology are developed for the purpose of being very complicated, but sometimes that use case is very important. Talking about NFT because personally I have been really underground doing NFT stuff, NFT marketplace for more than one years. So I think NFT itself is really, really a great innovation in terms of technology. But it's really the matter of how you utilize that technology to create a real use case. So unfortunately a lot of NFT project has been used for speculation rather than just like real assets or real commodity.
00:34:51.366 - 00:35:13.470, Speaker D: So I still say that this is actually just the beginning. So as we are introducing more technology tools and also education, I believe the industry can still know brighter. So I'm personally interested in a lot of CK and also RWA discussion this week. So see how this kind of a new thing can help us to really achieve the mass adoption mission.
00:35:14.210 - 00:35:16.058, Speaker A: That's awesome, Alessio.
00:35:16.154 - 00:35:17.780, Speaker B: That's what I'm excited about.
00:35:18.150 - 00:35:23.460, Speaker A: And your Paris love story, of course, that's for later. Okay.
00:35:25.270 - 00:35:52.798, Speaker B: Maybe just not very exciting, but let's go back to regulation. So regulation actually I'm very excited about regulation? I'm very excited. Probably you guys are mainly here in Europe, so you don't hear too much about what's going on in Asia. But I think Asia is now leading the world in terms of regulation. Just a couple of examples. So in the UAE, in Dubai. Dubai is configuring itself as one of the leading centers for blockchain business.
00:35:52.798 - 00:36:50.030, Speaker B: Now, there's a license for staking, which, if you think about it a few years ago, would be unthinkable. Even kind of having this conversation with the regulators, and even a regulator knowing what staking would mean, now they give you a license for that. And in Hong Kong, at the same time, there has been a complete U turn. So the regulator has turned extremely bullish and wants to transform Hong Kong into a global center for digital assets. Just to give an example, one month ago, we did a closed door meeting where the CEO of the central bank, the CEO of the regulator, and the financial secretary of Hong Kong. So basically, the three more most important institutions in Hong Kong were sitting on one side. On the other side, there were all the crypto companies, and on the third side, there were all the main 25 banks.
00:36:50.030 - 00:37:37.294, Speaker B: And the regulator was asking, okay, so we need to transform this one into the global center for digital assets. And all these guys, all these companies, they will need a bank account. So now you guys need to speak with each other, and you guys need to agree on what's needed from the banks in order to get these guys to get a bank account. So I think this is kind of revolutionary, because the whole world that we've been waiting for to come into the market is now actually coming to the market. Maybe it's not happening in the US yet. Maybe there's a little bit of lag, but it's coming from Asia, and this is a global world. It's not like the traditional securities market that is siloed vertically, and you cannot transfer an asset from one market to another.
00:37:37.294 - 00:37:57.160, Speaker B: Bitcoin is a global asset. If you cannot buy it in the US, you would buy it in Asia, and then the US would basically lag behind. So eventually, if somebody is moving fast, the other markets, they have to follow eventually. So it's going to be very exciting. It will take a little bit more, but a bright future is ahead of us.
00:37:57.610 - 00:38:11.290, Speaker A: That's really interesting. Great. Well, we're done with here. The questions we have, I think, a couple of minutes for audience questions. So now's your chance. Yep.
00:38:12.190 - 00:38:14.726, Speaker E: This question is for Daniel lynch.
00:38:14.918 - 00:38:23.318, Speaker B: So you mentioned earlier about one third of activity coming from institutionals, is that right?
00:38:23.424 - 00:38:42.894, Speaker E: Well, they're all institutions. It's about one third the proportion of. So we're pretty heterogeneous mix of kind of institutions. It's largely funds. So like crypto native funds, but you have like hedge funds and family offices are deploying smaller percentage of their portfolio. We have vcs, quite a number of vcs. We have foundations that have to manage their own treasuries.
00:38:42.894 - 00:39:29.426, Speaker E: We have these fintechs and exchanges that want to build structured products. And then we also have some of these NFT brand space folks. If you take a look at the total activity of all the metamask institutional clients who number in the hundreds, but they're those types of institutions we saw a lot of just like DeFi staking activity, liquidity, provision, yield, farming, there's a bit of NFT activity. And then suddenly around Chappella sense, I guess as a note of the derisking, that the proportion of the total activity of the metamask wallets started to metamask institutional began to represent about higher twenty s of the activity based in those wallets. And also just for the cameras. My wife is parisian. She couldn't get off work this week.
00:39:29.426 - 00:39:34.180, Speaker E: I'm so sorry. If you're watching at home, I'm not having any fun. I'm going to bed early.
00:39:36.470 - 00:39:38.054, Speaker A: Hi, mom. There we go.
00:39:38.092 - 00:40:13.434, Speaker E: Yeah, I actually didn't ask my question yet. Oh, sure, go ahead. My question was, why do you think that's the case? It's really puzling because some of the liquid staking, they had already mitigated some of the issues around liquidity. I think folks just like it when something feels derisk. I think financial professionals tend to feel the way with direct staking. I do certainly get waiting for withdrawals, but I think other folks just needed to see those events happen, to feel the type of confidence that they could to engage in certain strategies. So I think, yeah, we're being institutionalized.
00:40:13.434 - 00:40:19.860, Speaker E: This is the way folks act with proper risk strategies. And that's good, right? That's a good development in the web3 world.
00:40:21.030 - 00:40:26.646, Speaker A: Great. Maybe one final question, anyone? No?
00:40:26.828 - 00:40:45.420, Speaker B: Yeah, this is an open question. I don't have any particular person to answer, but I am curious from the insurance side on which type of insurance are the custodials implementing and if you see any way or what do you think is the future for insurance in web3?
00:40:46.590 - 00:41:24.326, Speaker C: That's a great question. I would say the market is wide open. There's a gigantic opportunity to provide insurance. I think you're going to need to do different silos. Just how broad the use cases are. When you say like web3 fire looks, we have a couple of insurance partners as well that we work with, and depending on your business line, our clients will get insurance from them for particular business lines or assets. But I would say, broadly speaking, it is something that I think presents a gigantic opportunity for somebody to really crack that problem.
00:41:24.326 - 00:41:33.930, Speaker C: The issue being, obviously, insurance regulation. And you start getting into a lot of the stuff that risk management that Mr. Regulator enjoys.
00:41:37.950 - 00:42:24.650, Speaker B: Actually, you made me think about, it's a huge market. We work with a lot of insurance companies. I hope there's no insurance company here in the audience today. But with all the respect, I think the traditional insurance companies that we all use, they don't really understand much what we're doing at the speed of which, I don't know if you've ever negotiated an insurance contract with them, the speed at which they operate is very different from the speed of the element of the market. So a contract that we signed today for a coverage of 100 million might not be actually claimable by the time a claim happens. And I mean, the funny thing is that I don't think there's been any claims so far, at least on the custody side. So we really don't know whether this thing is going to work or not.
00:42:24.650 - 00:42:48.794, Speaker B: So it would be actually extremely great if companies like Nexus Neptune. So the really on chain type of specialized web3 Defi insurance protocols, they emerge as potential really backstop solutions for the risk of the market and not only for custody. I don't know if they do offer, I don't know if leshing insurances exist.
00:42:48.842 - 00:43:19.046, Speaker A: Or not, but yeah, so it's funny, it's similar to what you're describing. I think you have the new players like Nexus Mutual, who have an opportunity to disrupt the kind of slower moving incumbent insurers. But we do hear also some larger insurance companies that are looking into the space, the pricing and the risk perception is still very high, which I think limits a little bit the amount of actual coverage that's being sold. There's a little bit of that.
00:43:19.148 - 00:43:21.754, Speaker C: And transitioning for the next panel?
00:43:21.882 - 00:43:22.862, Speaker A: Yes, absolutely.
00:43:22.996 - 00:43:23.726, Speaker F: Insurance.
00:43:23.908 - 00:43:30.620, Speaker A: So how to never need insurance is our next panel. And so, first of all, thank you so much to all our panelists. Thank you.
