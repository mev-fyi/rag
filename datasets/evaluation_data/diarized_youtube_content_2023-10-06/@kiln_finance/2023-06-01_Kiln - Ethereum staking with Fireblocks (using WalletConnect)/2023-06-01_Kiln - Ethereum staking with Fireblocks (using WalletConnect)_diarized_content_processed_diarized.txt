00:00:01.210 - 00:00:41.862, Speaker A: Hi there. In this video I'm going to go through how to stake Ethereum held in fireblocks. So on this page select Ethereum and here on the left you can see some stats about the network and the mechanics of staking eth. On the right you can choose the account that you want to stake towards. So here my treasury, how much you want to stake? I'm going to choose 64, which is two validators. I can then see the rewards I can expect to earn. And next I'm going to connect my wallet here I'm on the testnet environment.
00:00:41.862 - 00:01:32.454, Speaker A: So this is the Goldie Ethereum testnet. When I choose connect wallet, I'm going to select wallet connect because this is how we can interface with fireblocks. So from my fireblocks app I'm going to scan this QR code. I choose the vault that I want to connect to and the network. And then once I'm connected I can now see the withdrawal address here that will hold a claim to the eth that I staked. And this is the address of my fireblocks vault that I just connected. Once I confirm this address I can hit stake.
00:01:32.454 - 00:02:39.870, Speaker A: Now this is going to prepare validators on the kiln infrastructure and is going to propose a deposit transaction that will appear in my fireblocks and I can confirm an issue from inside my fireblocks. So here are the details of the transaction. In fireblocks I can see there's a new contract call request which is asking me do I want to deposit 64 e into Kiln's batch deposit contract that effectively forwards the deposit into the Ethereum beacon chain deposit contract. Once I approve this and go through the security of the pin code and face id on fireblocks, then that's going to issue my deposit. And right now I've accepted it. And the kiln platform has noticed this deposit is coming through. It's now processing it and is funding the validator.
00:02:39.870 - 00:03:13.250, Speaker A: So in a few seconds we should see that the validator has been funded. Here we go. And we have successfully staked 64 e. And so on the rewards page you can track or all your validators how much they have staked, how much they have earned and you can click through to the beacon chain explorer to see more details about each validator. So that's it for now. Thanks for listening.
