00:00:07.600 - 00:00:22.905, Speaker A: Adam, thanks for coming and joining Paris. Bonjour. Welcome. Thanks for also joining on the podcast. I would be very interested if you can introduce yourself and maybe explain a bit of your crypto journey.
00:00:23.025 - 00:00:56.413, Speaker B: Absolutely, yeah. Appreciate being here and this room is not too shabby and any excuse to be in Paris is a good one. So I'm Adam Levine, the SVP of corporate development and partnerships at Firebucks. And so real briefly, for those that are not familiar, Fireblocks were digital asset technology infrastructure. So I've been with the firm approaching three years now. But my, my journey with crypto started truthfully as a hater. I was working at a foreign exchange settlement bank, an institution that was designated systemically important in the US and the role of that company was, was to settle the world's effects.
00:00:56.413 - 00:01:21.141, Speaker B: So think about around 5 to 6 trillion dollars a day in at the time, 17 currencies. They were all flowing through our system. And so we met with this company at the time and they were explaining why we needed to support their currency. That company happened to have been Ripple. So this goes back about six or seven years ago. And I sat in a meeting having not really thought much about Bitcoin. I knew nothing about this at the time.
00:01:21.141 - 00:02:17.897, Speaker B: I thought a no name company called Ripple, um, and just listening to them explain what they're trying to do in a systemically important financial market infrastructure made no sense at all. Um, so it was a nice meeting, we left, nothing progressed and they back my mind was thinking like their pitch at the time was not what it is today. Um, but wow, there's a lot that that bank where I worked could do differently if we're doing things in a digitized or tokenized way. So started off being an absolute hater, thinking crypto was just silly and there was no point to the technology to quickly evolving and realizing damn, the market is working in an antiquated, outmoded way. And that same tech could be doing a lot. And that's what started to get me excited and really leaning into what's Bitcoin, what's Ethereum, what could you do on top of these rails, these technology when.
00:02:17.921 - 00:02:26.905, Speaker A: You tell yourself, okay, I need to move from trife to crypto and wi fi blocks there, there's a bunch of other companies in this space.
00:02:27.025 - 00:03:10.805, Speaker B: There are. I had a lot of experience dealing with regulators globally, so central banks in emerging markets, established markets, truthfully around the world, and really wanted to leverage that experience in an unregulated way. And so I went from one bank to another, both systemically Important and got to work really close with fintechs. This is when I was at BNY Mellon and I just thought the fintechs were doing the innovative stuff. That's what seemed really exciting. Understanding what a traditional player thinks about, but being able to do it in an unregulated way, supporting the technology, those are things that excited me. If I'm lucky, I spend the rest of my career not working at a traditional financial institution.
00:03:10.805 - 00:03:54.597, Speaker B: Not because they're not great, it's just not what I love. They're really important clients. Um, but for me the passion was how do you help innovate the, the ecosystem, innovate with those Trad 5 players. So that was my mission. And when I switched to BNY Mellon, I early on met some guy named Michael Shalov, founder of some company I never heard of. Over the next 18 months, got to develop a relationship with him and it was right place, right time where I thought they aligned with being a technology provider, not a financial service provider. Going back to the beginning of what I was talking about, where they seemed to understand what the technology could do for traditional financial services.
00:03:54.597 - 00:04:02.605, Speaker B: And then there was so much more. Firebox was within their ambition. So I consider myself pretty lucky to have made the move almost three years ago.
00:04:02.765 - 00:04:05.621, Speaker A: Right. And freezing crypto, it seems like your life already.
00:04:05.693 - 00:04:09.125, Speaker B: I had no gray hair back then. Now, yeah, now it's a little different.
00:04:09.245 - 00:04:35.439, Speaker A: I can just divide. Yeah. I mean you mentioned innovation and you thought Fireblocks is a tech provider platform for financial institutions with mind blowing products and team. Why do you think the Fireblocks platform is important for institutions? How would you differentiate it from other platforms in the ecosystem?
00:04:35.527 - 00:05:17.311, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a few things. The first, at its core, we're a cybersecurity company. We take security very seriously, physical security, cybersecurity, all aspects of it. And that comes from the DNA of the founders and definitely permeates the culture. I like to think about all the weird and wonderful things you could do with digital assets, but if you can't hold those assets safely and securely, the rest of the cool stuff doesn't happen. And so for us, all of the products that Fireblocks offer start with that core principle of it needs to be really safe and secure. But what's exciting about Fireblocks is this really complicated, sophisticated technology doesn't necessarily have a complicated user experience.
00:05:17.311 - 00:06:15.239, Speaker B: And being able to marry those two is a key differentiator. But when we think about the types of clients we support, it really ranges. We have over 1800 clients we have clients in every continent except Antarctica. And it goes from crypto Bros and chicks trading in their garage all the way up to systemically important institutions, central banks and everything in between. And it's really exciting to work in a company that has great product market fit and really strong technology in all those different use cases. And as we've expanded, at least in my three years there, drilling in on things like smart contract capability with tokenization with payments and some of the use cases around there and now the utility of NFTs. So not just pictures of monkeys, which is great, but what could you do with NFTs? Right? These are some of the things we're focused on and most recently a real pivot to reinforce our dedication to developers because that's where the next level of innovation is going to come.
00:06:15.239 - 00:06:25.839, Speaker B: It's hard to find another tech provider in the Web three that has such a broad set of products and offerings and a really strong fit in all those markets as well.
00:06:25.887 - 00:06:45.029, Speaker A: I mean, you said a couple of things that are interesting to me. First, security. You have an internal security team, right, in Tel Aviv and are trying to break your product on daily basis. Why this is important and why it might be different from some of your competitors.
00:06:45.117 - 00:07:22.065, Speaker B: Yeah, look, our CISO is amazing. Someone that not only has worked in TradFi, but worked in public institutions where they were protecting against nation state attacks. So it's someone who's seen all different types of challenges and he's built out a tremendous team. It's mostly based in Tel Aviv though not exclusively. And they have a version of basically a soc where you're in there and there's just across the wall. They're just monitoring every type of threat they could be thinking about. And that gives a lot of comfort to our clients.
00:07:22.065 - 00:07:58.129, Speaker B: It's not just for show they're actively using it, but when clients come and see the level of sophistication, there's. It rivals what some Tradfi institutions have. And I think just knowing that you have a team that is consistently monitoring not just our system, but threats that could be coming in across the board, it's a differentiator. The other thing I'll mention is we have a whole product team that focuses on security and proactively looking at threats in the market. Things we could be alerting our clients to that are outside of our system and we think about what more we could be developing. Those are really core differentiators. We want to be there.
00:07:58.129 - 00:08:16.097, Speaker B: Not we're not antivirus software. Not antivirus software. We're not there just to protect problems. We're there to enable business. But knowing that tech enables business and we're dedicating so many resources to thinking about security and those sort of concerns, that's a pretty special combination.
00:08:16.241 - 00:08:39.363, Speaker A: Yeah, the take enable the business and security is not like the focus of a small team, is the focus of the all product team because it's a mindset. And definitely some of the founders and this Israeli DNA made Fireblock very special on this. I want to talk about partnerships.
00:08:39.459 - 00:08:39.931, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:08:40.003 - 00:09:04.367, Speaker A: Because you mentioned 1,800 clients in the platform, soon 2,000. And there's a lot of offerings you could access from the Flagbox platform. It's staking, it's compliance, it's insurance. How do you approach partnership and why is it important to enable your customers?
00:09:04.511 - 00:09:47.477, Speaker B: So for me, partners are absolutely core, not just to what I do and my team focuses on, but what makes Fireblock successful. So first, what our founders have developed and the product and R and D team, since we do believe is amazing and a differentiator. But there's a lot that is outside our gift. There's a lot that there are other experts to focus on and our clients need that. And so finding the right partners that have the capabilities that we know our clients need, that meet our security standards, have the right cultural fit, we spend a lot of time making sure we pick the right partners. And so look, staking is something that is really important to clients. It's not something Fireblocks natively does.
00:09:47.477 - 00:10:30.461, Speaker B: And that's where we look to people like Kiln and the relationship we have, where it's really important to know that we share some values in terms of the quality of product security, but also focusing on what clients want and getting the client benefit. Those are things that I spend a lot of time making sure it's not just about what's your revenue share, what do the legals look like? But, uh, that's the easy stuff. It's once you've signed the agreement, how are you going to market in a way that you feel very comfortable knowing that your client's talking to your partner, that you have each other's back, and that you're delivering what the client needs. And we have a handful of partners that we've really been focusing on over the last year in a few different areas and really excited about some of the feedback we get from clients and.
00:10:30.493 - 00:10:44.123, Speaker A: Specifically on staking it. Tell us about how do you partner with Foundation? How do we build a product on the custody side behind staking side together so that we can go to market ticket together and help these foundation grow with their customers.
00:10:44.219 - 00:11:26.611, Speaker B: That's right. It's very clear there continues to be a proliferation of foundations and new protocols. One of the differentiators for Fireblocks, amongst others, is how many protocols we support. But we spend a lot of time and part of the team focuses on what makes the next protocol interesting. Why is the Cosmos ecosystem a thing? How can we get engaged in a way that's appropriate? And a big part of that is not just supporting it on the Wallet infrastructure, but making sure that we're supporting the other capabilities? And the staking goes hand in hand with that. When you have institutional investors that want to really engage with the new protocol, they're also expecting staking and they expect that to be a really strong capability. And that's what's exciting about the partnership for us.
00:11:26.683 - 00:11:34.285, Speaker A: If I'm an institution on Fireblocks and I want simply stake through the UI or other ways, how I can do it.
00:11:34.355 - 00:12:00.601, Speaker B: Yeah. So over the last year, our product team has built a really sweet, simple to use product offering. We're starting off with a limited number of protocols and expanding. But when you look in the ui, in the Fireblocks ui, it says staking. Right now it's Eth, Sol and Matic and it's really just a few clicks. Once you're in your workspace or the ui, you click on staking, you pick the protocol that you want to stake. We have two partners.
00:12:00.601 - 00:12:32.959, Speaker B: Obviously kiln is front and center there and you see the rewards at a certain level. If you're an institutional investor, we're able to work out commercials. But if you like the rewards, you click how much you want to stake. It's a stake now and within minutes the staking is already taking place. But obviously there's three and a half dozen other protocols we support on the wallet that are not in the staking. And that's where we're able to work closely and make sure our clients know to come to one of our staking partners and then from there they get the same capabilities.
00:12:33.087 - 00:13:04.757, Speaker A: I want to deep dive into one of the feature you have or products on the platform, which is very interesting to me because I think, you know, the ecosystem is going both ways. Non custodial, flow, part and war. Custodial was offering like etf and we can deep dive on it just after that. But I want to understand why you offered, I think September last year, the Wallet as service capabilities and why it's important for institutions.
00:13:04.901 - 00:13:26.695, Speaker B: Where do you see the use cases yeah. So the non custodial wallets or wallet as a service to me is a tremendous new opportunity for the market. Now, first and foremost, it's still leveraging the same technology underpinning Firebox. It's still the same security. At no point do we say, oh, it's a retail more focused use case. Let's, let's let them have some more risk. That's not how it works.
00:13:26.695 - 00:14:04.365, Speaker B: So it's important to reinforce this. But what we do is allows our clients to have a Web3 experience with their clients. Right. And so when we provide the non custodial wallets, it means that the client that we're working with can have a loyalty program with NFTs, they could have payments use cases with stablecoins. But our client doesn't need to be the custodian. As we know in certain markets there's a lack of regulatory clarity that being custodian can be challenging. In other markets there is regulatory clarity and they know they don't want to be a custodian, but they still want this Web3 experience.
00:14:04.365 - 00:14:39.429, Speaker B: And so we've been working with a variety of companies in a bunch of different arenas. Areas where telecom and communications looking to have that Web3 engagement with their end users, for example, even airline companies that are looking for that, it's a, it's a great way for, for the technology to be used without getting triggered under a custodial license requirements or some of the other regulation that comes with it. Doesn't mean it's less secure. It's just a different experience. And we're excited that it's starting to take off after we launched it.
00:14:39.517 - 00:15:26.321, Speaker A: And that's, that's an area where kiln is focused on quite a lot. Is building a revenue engine, is it staking or is it defi in the future? So that as a platform, as institutions offer an unconsolial offering to users, you can monetize and you can offer various type of rewards to your customers. On the ETF spectrum of things, this ecosystem has been growing and, and then flourishing and exciting since the beginning of the year. We've seen it in Europe, but definitely not the same scale as the us. Why do you think it's important for the space and how is five Blocks helping or interacting with the ET space at the moment?
00:15:26.473 - 00:16:08.660, Speaker B: So it's clearly been a pivotal moment. And the price of Bitcoin and ETH actually also both represented some of the ETH get a little bit of the benefit from the Bitcoin ETF because we're still in the early stages still of Web3, I do very much believe it's the rising tide lifts all boats. And the other thing we're seeing with the approval of the Bitcoin ETF is that there's serious demand from institutional investors, even in retail. Those that maybe didn't trust the retail experience due to FTX and others are jumping it. They don't want it. There's a little bit of FOMO. There's also those that maybe they only had their 401k as an opportunity to invest in.
00:16:08.660 - 00:16:59.295, Speaker B: Now, some 401k programs give you that chance to get the true bitcoin exposure through the etf. And I think it's really important for the remaining naysayers, the laggards in the space, to have something that's more approachable for them. ETFs are very well understood regardless of the asset class. So now when you provide a really cool asset class in a structure that people accept and understand, and right now the fees aren't too bad compared to what they were with grayscale before. It's tremendous for the industry and I think it's true. Truly good for the industry globally, but definitely in the us. So what we're seeing at Firebox, we're not a licensed custodian, we're not holding the underlying bitcoin, but it seems to be a real resurgence in the bitcoin ecosystem.
00:16:59.295 - 00:17:20.407, Speaker B: So people talk about all the L2s that are coming out in the space and how to leverage the bitcoin Rails and the bitcoin ecosystem. I think it's got a lot more credibility because there's so much excitement around the bitcoin etf. And we'll see what happens with the ETH etf. Latest news doesn't look like that main target going to happen.
00:17:20.471 - 00:17:22.015, Speaker A: Do you think it's going to be approved this year?
00:17:22.095 - 00:17:58.253, Speaker B: I think they're going to do everything they can to challenge it and move slowly. And it may come down very much to a political issue. The US has a presidential election this year and it'll be interesting to see if, let's say the US government's view of crypto and web 3, if that bolsters support or hinders support for our current president. So we'll see. But it feels inevitable when you have the likes of Fidelity and BlackRock and push in space. Yeah, they usually have pretty good connectivity to government and they're clearly pushing the issue.
00:17:58.429 - 00:18:38.365, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good point. 2024 at best. 2025, 2026 worst case. But still it's happening. And there's another use case that's quite big on the platform. Very exciting to us as we launching stablecoins yield aggregation layer and that's actually in the stablecoins I think it represents of volume on Fireblogs. Why is it important for the space and what are the different offering you present to your customers, PSP others? Where do you see the different use cases there?
00:18:39.465 - 00:19:06.755, Speaker B: The use of stablecoin for me is really exciting. Going back to how I first got interested in crypto. It was really around payments and moving money more efficiently. That's coming true. Last year the cliche for everyone to say at every conference or podcast was there's going to be a stable coin, a stable coin war everywhere. What we're seeing now is stablecoin usage pick up in a really material way. And I think it's for a few reasons.
00:19:06.755 - 00:19:46.225, Speaker B: In certain emerging markets, payments are still difficult. In the US we have a variety of retail payment systems and wholesale payment systems that work reasonably well. We could argue whether Web3 is better or not. I think it is, but that doesn't matter. But when it comes to cross border payments or domestic payments in certain markets, stablecoin is much more efficient. And especially in countries where their currency fluctuates significantly, having access to a stable stablecoin is critical. So what we're seeing is a real proliferation of stablecoin per payments.
00:19:46.225 - 00:20:20.955, Speaker B: So people talk about making payments with Bitcoin and that'll be a thing for sure. But they're used to making payments in dollars or in some cases their local currency. And we're seeing a real significant pickup even the last quarter, tremendous growth in number of payments use cases from our clients. And I think there's a few things coming together. One is circles going public. Coinbase already is public and everyone's going to see just how much money they've been making on in general income. Everyone's going to get a little jealous, right, with how strong USDC is.
00:20:20.955 - 00:20:54.301, Speaker B: You have some players like PayPal moving into the market with PyUSD, working with AXOS, and slowly but surely they're going to continue to enter. And then the last thing I would comment on is you look at Franklin Templeton and others that are doing tokenized money market and that's going to be a way for the end user to eat into some of that interest that Circle and Coinbase are making today, but still be able to know that they have a relatively stable token that they're able to make payments for. All that's coming together now.
00:20:54.453 - 00:21:38.311, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's less than 2% of stablecoins are bearing interest today. And one of the main reason we think is because real world assets and tokenized money market fund is are coming but are not here and there for regulatory or sometimes like simple technical or those such as like KYC NFT which which you are actually also launching on the platform. Another thing that you touched that is very exciting is I think the combination between payments and non custodial wallets because you, you mentioned in emerging markets, you know an Algerian getting exposed to a non inflating currency which is the dollar and but also having a wallet that is banker simulant.
00:21:38.343 - 00:21:38.559, Speaker B: Right.
00:21:38.607 - 00:21:47.567, Speaker A: Like how, how do you see these two combination play outs of products and why do you think it's important? Yeah, I'm personally very excited about.
00:21:47.631 - 00:22:28.433, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'll tell you the. If you want to take an altruistic view looking at certain countries where hardworking people have their savings and they wake up one morning and it's 40% or 80% devalued, think about Argentina, think about Afghanistan. The average person there needs access to something that's more stable. Right. And that's where you can think of digital assets and having your own wallet that you're not trusting on someone else that you could put stable coins in is tremendous. Then thinking about in terms of the non custodial wallet, this wallet as a service, we work with certain online marketplaces, right.
00:22:28.433 - 00:22:53.679, Speaker B: In a variety of capabilities and the suppliers, the purchasers, they're global. Right. And they want to be able to make payments. They want to be able to make their product quickly and have access to that cash as soon as possible. And that's where you're going to start to see a lot of adoption. Someone purchased something online, make the payment of stablecoins relatively instantly. They're getting their dollar and it's theirs.
00:22:53.679 - 00:23:05.935, Speaker B: Right. They're not relying on a bank if they don't want to. Of course there's a role for banks to play. That's the sort of use cases that we're expecting to see a lot of. It's still early but this is where the trend is starting to move for sure.
00:23:06.355 - 00:23:20.135, Speaker A: And that's a very exciting future. I'm talking about the Future, let's say three, five years, right. Like 10 years in crypto it's already two lifetimes. What are you excited about personally or fireblocks?
00:23:21.235 - 00:23:54.985, Speaker B: Yeah, so fireblocks taken on a lot and we're going to continue to. Right. We think about financial services payments and the utility of NFTs. And so we're going to continue to build in on providing technology across all those pillars. For me, one area that I'm particularly interested in and fireblocks is looking at this amongst other is you have a proliferation of so many different protocols. You're going to have assets on those protocols. Not just the native tokens, but thinking about commerce, there'll be real world financial assets that are tokenized and brought on chain.
00:23:54.985 - 00:24:30.869, Speaker B: And seeing the level of innovation when it comes to moving assets cross chain is an area of focus that I think is really interesting. There's a bunch of companies out there starting to solve for this. Some of our clients are starting to solve for this as well. But every time there's a hack of a bridge, it's bad for the industry. And so knowing that you have the EVM world, the cosmos world, a variety of other L1 is doing some innovative real work. How they work together, some degree of interoperability or being able to move assets across them is an area that's ripe for opportunity. It'll be really important for the industry.
00:24:30.997 - 00:24:36.749, Speaker A: Great. Thanks again Adam, for coming in Paris. I hope next time you come with your wife.
00:24:36.837 - 00:24:45.517, Speaker B: That sounds good and definitely the most impressive room I've been on a podcast on. We've set the standards, but we just love working with the Kilton team and really appreciate this.
00:24:45.621 - 00:24:47.989, Speaker A: Yes, we'll welcome you again anytime soon.
00:24:48.077 - 00:24:49.045, Speaker B: Excellent. Thanks, Messi.
