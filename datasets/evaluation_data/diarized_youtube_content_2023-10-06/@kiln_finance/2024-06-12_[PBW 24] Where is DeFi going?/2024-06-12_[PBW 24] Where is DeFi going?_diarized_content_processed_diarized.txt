00:00:03.880 - 00:00:33.014, Speaker A: Welcome everyone. Very happy to have you all in our office for this panel. So today we'll discuss Defi. Of course, that's a big topic. Last time, during a previous kin rendezvous, it was bear market. We discussed kind of the Defi opportunities and how we saw the next month coming into that space. And now that we enter a new cycle, the idea was to gather defi experts around this panel and try to discuss where DeFi is going in general for the next months and years.
00:00:33.014 - 00:00:54.094, Speaker A: So here we have four amazing persons. We start with, let's say the DeFi protocols representative. So we have Pablo from angle and Paul from Morpho. And maybe I'd like to introduce yourself, try to present what is angle and why did you start this project individually?
00:00:54.554 - 00:01:44.064, Speaker B: So, yeah, I'm a co founder of Engel. We are a decentralized stablecoin protocol behind so far two stable coins, Euro A, one of the biggest euro stablecoins, and brand new USD stablecoin. USDA, which is like classical USD stablecoin that tries to improve over the state of the market. The reason why we started doing stablecoins in the first place, and especially euro, was that we believe that we saw the power in a Defi infrastructure, but we also saw the critical legos which were lacking. And especially there was no forex in Defi. And if you build an infrastructure, if you're building finance on chain, you need the same building blocks as you have in a real traditional finance ecosystem. And so bringing a euro stablecoin made a lot of sense.
00:01:44.064 - 00:02:15.754, Speaker B: And especially like, at the time, DeFi felt a bit like exclusive when you came from Europe, because all you had access to was USD yield opportunities. And so after like several years doing this, we figured out that there was also a lack of like deep forex markets on chain. FX is one of the largest Defi vertical, but no one has really tackled it so far. And this is what has led us to start working on the USD stablecoin combined with the euro stablecoin offering. We have, we do a lot of other things, but this is basically the gist of it.
00:02:16.334 - 00:02:20.950, Speaker A: So Paul, what is Morpho and what was needed in the space in the first place?
00:02:21.142 - 00:03:05.712, Speaker C: So I'm Paul, I'm co founder of Morpho Protocol. And so we build lending and borrowing, decentralized protocols. And so essentially we came in this space two and a half years ago, looking at the current space of lending and borrowing platforms that were to us more like funds and brokers, where you would deposit your money and you had the Defi protocols that were more like Uniswap, where everything was immutable, efficient, and you did not have to rely on the team. And then you have the platforms like the Aven compound where you deposited your money, but things was not completely autonomous. You had to expect the daos behind the scenes to do some management. We decided to improve on that and do a landing and boring platform that's more like. Like uniswap.
00:03:05.712 - 00:03:20.324, Speaker C: So an actual immutable and efficient protocol that's completely permissionless and that serves as an infrastructure for any lending and borrowing use. Case in Defi, and also broader, with any kind of risk and compliance.
00:03:20.784 - 00:03:42.726, Speaker A: And to conclude this introduction circle, we have two representatives for the major wallets out there. So Pierre led BD at Tres Wallet and Daniel ed of Martianship at Metamask Institutional. So maybe can you present what users use, your platforms, and how do they interact with Defi today? So maybe, Pierre, you can start.
00:03:42.750 - 00:04:15.344, Speaker D: Pierre, I can start at Trustwallet. We are a retail software wallet mostly. So this means people can download our wallets directly from Android or iOS. So our users are very. In general, we have users all around the world. The biggest country, I mean, the biggest region where we have users are mostly Asia, Africa, Latam. We also have user, of course, in Europe and in the US or in Canada.
00:04:15.344 - 00:04:35.784, Speaker D: But, yeah, historically, trustwallet has been the largest in the first mobile wallet, launched in 2017. So all the region where all the people are more mobile first, especially in developing countries, tend to have used trust wallet a lot in general. So I would say, yeah, we have users all around the world, but especially in developing countries.
00:04:36.084 - 00:04:41.844, Speaker A: Okay, and Daniel, what is Metamask institutional and how user interact with DeFi threads?
00:04:41.924 - 00:05:08.930, Speaker E: Great, yeah, so I've worked a bit on the metamask side and the Metamask Institutional, and there's a lot of cohorts that use defi. Maybe I'll give you the most. The ones that use the most are the ones that use the least. I'll try to make this quick, because there's a lot retail, you all know retail. Retail uses defi, right? We do notice, though, that each cycle, the ones that didn't the last cycle, start to do more the next cycle. So people who didn't do icos to DeFi, the people that were just on centralized exchanges and Defi summer, are starting to do, like, restaking crypto funds. We have a number.
00:05:08.930 - 00:05:32.196, Speaker E: I would say I'd characterize those as anyone from, like, three guys in Miami with an LLC and, like, $9 million to, like, galaxy digital. They're obviously very much in DeFi. After that, VC's with liquid tokens. Many of them are in DeFi, though less than you would imagine. I also find that a little questionable. Like, if I was an LP, I'm like, hey, you committed to hold this token for eight years. Why aren't you lending or staking it if you have a fiduciary responsibility to me, so it's a call to action.
00:05:32.196 - 00:05:56.684, Speaker E: If you're a VC, use mmi, we'll help you out. But many, many use it, right? Dows and foundations as well. Those that can use defi for their treasury management, although it's challenging with governance. Then you get into kind of like the traditional funds family offices, those, we have hundreds of these conversations, which is fun, it's great. They're deploying like 0.5% of their portfolio. But when you step back, it's still like a very small number.
00:05:56.684 - 00:06:32.210, Speaker E: Because you think about the sheer number of funds and family offices in the world or in just the United States, very low. And many are doing very boring things. So some are just buying the bitcoin ETF, some are buying on centralized exchanges, and then some are buying like funds, of funds, of funds, of funds. It's like, why are you so dissert? It's a blockchain, man, just buy a token. But we do see some starting to do defi things. And then after that, I would say probably interesting is like fintechs exchanges and some neo banks that are starting to offer like structured Defi offerings. So like if you look at, and I don't mean launching a wallet, because anyone can do that, I don't begrudge them for it, it's a good business.
00:06:32.210 - 00:07:11.214, Speaker E: But like if I'm using a centralized exchange, I can send a coinbase, send to other wallets, trust rabi, whatever I get. They want to be more vertically integrated. But there are some doing interesting things like lemon is a fintech in Argentina, they have an offering for their users that's just like USD savings. And they nakedly say, hey, we take your USDC and we put into Aave. But they've structured it such that if you're a carpenter putting away in like Mendoza putting away like $7 a day, it's very nice to just click a button, get your 8% interest, and then on their side they have a trading desk that aggregates all the deposits at the end of the day. And then the last is the banks, right? And then I guess in some countries, I think it's Switzerland, they made like liquid staking. Legal for them now, so they're getting into it.
00:07:11.214 - 00:07:33.706, Speaker E: Some of these. Brazil has a nice regime. I think Colombia and Peru will pass them soon, so they may start doing things like lemon's doing. And then similarly, you also see some cool experimentation, but still very much experimentation, like when we helped JP Morgan do the Singapore dollar japanese yen swaps on a modified version of AAVE. So that's kind of like from the most defi to the least. I hope that was a good tour.
00:07:33.770 - 00:07:56.930, Speaker A: Yeah. Interesting, the full spectrum. So, yeah, for this discussion, I guess we can discuss kind of four pillars of defi. So lending, stablecoin, ux, and adoption in general. Maybe we'll start with lending, I guess. One of the big news in the industry in the past months was the launch of Morpho blue metamorpho. Can you tell us why this was needed and what it brings to the space today?
00:07:57.082 - 00:08:48.502, Speaker C: Right, so, before we launched Morphoblue, we had another protocol called Morph Optimizer, and it was a landing and borrowing protocol, but it was also using existing lending and borrowing infrastructure. It was actually like the biggest integration ever built on top of landing posts. So we've been spending a year and a half building on top of landing platforms ourselves, and we very quickly realized that you had a bunch of limits in terms of security, efficiency, and scalability. Security, because those things are not as autonomous as they seem to be. Like, in practice, they get updated quite frequently. Over the last two years, I've been in quite a few war rooms, I can tell you, and some of them also get hacked, and it's a fact. And so that was the main problem.
00:08:48.502 - 00:09:37.382, Speaker C: And at some point, we're like, okay, we can't keep building on top of those so called decentralized platforms that keep updating all the time. And then the second one was efficiency. We want to get better interest rate, better leverage than in tratfi. And now, okay, the market has been picking up. There's crazy rates, et cetera, et cetera. But in the normal market conditions, where the rates are not driven by crypto, but purely by financial activity, while the rates are not competitive with traditional finance, we are having a hard time figuring out true financial infrastructure that is actually more efficient. I'm sure Pablo can speak for it in the forex side of things, like, how can we use and leverage blockchain technology and defi to be more efficient than traditional finance like infrastructure in general? And then the last point was scalability.
00:09:37.382 - 00:10:42.974, Speaker C: The current lending platforms were offering one very specific risk. You know profile, very specific compliance profile. And so it made it very hard to list new assets, right? Like if you wanted to have lending and borrowing of new assets in the platform, you could not, because it would essentially require to add it into the avian compound, like funds which have their limited risk exposure, so they can't list all the assets, et cetera. Otherwise at some point it becomes too risky. And so with all of this in mind, we realized that what we needed to do was not trying to do more or better than existing lending platforms, but was actually doing less and just do the lending and borrowing engine. Because what we are at the end of the day, is a protocol that's connecting people that have an excess of capital and want to generate interest with people that have a need of financing. The question we ask ourselves is, what's necessary in order to solve this multi set it market? And turns out more for blue is doing justice.
00:10:42.974 - 00:11:06.354, Speaker C: So there is no risk management component. There is not even a management component at all. It's just a pure lending and borrowing market that's very similar to uniswap in that regard. So it's completely immutable. That's just 600 lines of code, fully permissionless. So you can think of it more as an Internet protocol rather than a financial product. And so that's more for blue.
00:11:06.354 - 00:11:51.912, Speaker C: And anyone can create their pool with any asset, with any compliance with any risk. Now, the downside compared to the aave of the world, is that Aave is a great product. Like you go on Aave, there is one option, one rate, one risk. You deposit your money, you don't think like lemon, they have their wallet, their money, they just deposit USDC without thinking. And then Aave is going to do all the risk management, et cetera, on morphle. Okay? You have to do the risk management yourself now, because the protocol is just pure landing engine. So this is why we have a second layer, which is called metamorpho, which essentially enables anyone that has risk or compliance management capabilities to express a specific risk profile, a specific compliance profile on top of morpho blue, which is the trustless and efficient base layer.
00:11:51.912 - 00:12:56.460, Speaker C: And so with this model, which is about unbundling AV into two pieces, well, you have the ability to express any risk profile and, you know, with optimal efficiency and security. And this enables us to capture a much broader market, which is not restricted to crypto native lending and borrowing, but can extend to, like, all the newer stablecoin, like for example, USDA or euro A or like, and then more regulated markets as well. Right. And being able to fulfill the requirements of more centralized and more traditional finance or fintech platforms that require certain guardrails in terms of finance, etcetera. TLDR is instead of having one monolithic financial product on chain, we're building finance in layers, like just the lending and borrowing Internet protocol, then the risk management protocol, then the UX layer, and it goes in layers. If you're complex enough, you interact directly with the base layer and you don't get to subscribe to the world monolith. Right? So, yeah, that's what we did.
00:12:56.532 - 00:13:19.084, Speaker A: Very cool. So overall, a more stable, more efficient, more composable platform that's bringing that to the space. And so as your perspective is from wallet technology providers or as stablecoin, what do you see in the landing space that's missing today? Or how do you view this space in maybe a year? Where do you want it to go?
00:13:19.864 - 00:14:13.172, Speaker B: I think it's same as pole vision. Like, what we're missing right now is still tooling, because once you get the base infrastructure, it's like having an operating system and you need to build software on top of it. And so it's not because you reinvent the engine that you need to, that risk management goes away. And so being able to automate risk management, being able to automate, I don't know, to make tools for people to liquidate easily, to make tools for anyone to take advantage of all the features you have built in. But that requires a lot of infrastructure, like, I don't know, taking leverage or doing some form of complex strategies involving multiple landing pools, this is what I expect to see the most in the space. So essentially, like lending and boring is becoming kind of commodified. And we could speak about this later on stable coins as well.
00:14:13.172 - 00:14:54.622, Speaker B: I believe it's also becoming kind of commodified. And for when you are a pure lending protocol, all you can do is just to optimize the tooling around it. You can try to optimize the core protocol. There may be research, and I think, like, it's not because you do finance on blockchains that the rules are different. You know, like the rules of physics remain the rules of physics, regardless of the infrastructure you use as a base layer. And so if you're doing lending and boring, you need to look into what's happening into the lending and boring space in tradfi, to see how you can improve over our limited experience in defi in the space. So yeah, commodification tooling is what I expect to see.
00:14:54.622 - 00:15:01.162, Speaker B: And if possible, some protocol improvements, but I'm not there to judge what needs to be improved in the space.
00:15:01.258 - 00:15:04.202, Speaker A: And Pierre, from more user perspective, what do you think is missing today?
00:15:04.258 - 00:15:41.630, Speaker D: From a wallet perspective, it's always interesting to look at the market and to see how protocol like angle or morpho they are keep innovating how they are evolving over the time. Because if we look back in 2017 when Trustwallet has been invented, it was mostly just to old tokens. And this is why Trustwallet has been a huge success. At the beginning for the auto indexer we had in the wallets where people could participate to ICO and to order token very easily. Then we saw all the defi narrative coming, the NFTs inscription. Now we are talking about restaking. Lending is also a key topic.
00:15:41.630 - 00:16:31.034, Speaker D: So during all these different phases, all the wallets on the market, including trust, we kind of evolve based on what the market and the protocol are bringing to us. So it started with the swap features, for example, inside trust wallet, where people were asking more interaction directly inside the wallet and not outside by connecting to Dapp. Then this year we launched staking, mostly with Kiln, where our users were requiring to be able to stake their assets directly inside the app. The next iteration, from a wallet perspective, it's mostly related to stablecoin for us, where we are going, and we want to provide users the ability to supply their stablecoin directly inside the wallet to enjoy yield. Considering this request from the market and the direction we want to talk the product, it's very interesting for us to see and to get the vision from both Pablo and Paul about it.
00:16:31.854 - 00:16:43.110, Speaker A: Cool. And Daniel, how do you see this lending space today? You see a lot of traction, for example, for more institutional users to start using these lending platforms.
00:16:43.302 - 00:17:16.694, Speaker E: Yeah, I mean, again, it really depends on the regulations and really the readiness of these folks. From an infrastructure perspective, we have seen in that hierarchy of folks, obviously the individuals and the crypto funds do a bit interestingly. We do see some of those funds and family offices we talked about that don't even necessarily always trade crypto per se, but they do tap the lending markets for additional liquidity without traditional margin mechanisms, which is a rather novel thing. You talk to them like, hey, I'm not a crypto fund, I'm an equities trader, but there's free money over here, so I'd be dumb not to take it. Yeah, sure.
00:17:16.814 - 00:17:36.154, Speaker A: And now let's talk about the next, let's say defi pure, also stablecoin, of course. So also one of the great news in the past month was the launch of your USD stablecoin and kind of the forex capabilities it enables. Can you talk more about that? And why is it important for you to launch this?
00:17:36.854 - 00:18:45.536, Speaker B: So I think it's important for the market as a whole, because we are paving the way for forex market to take place on chain. You know, one of the reasons when, when I joined the space was people selling Luke cross border payments remittances are going to be solved by crypto in the end. But turns out that it can only work, you know, like within a single currency. So if like circle has a bank account in the US and a bank account in Colombia, then yeah, I can send a USDC to someone in Colombia and the person can exit from Circle bank account in Colombia. It's dollars, but it's not possible to trade USD to euros on chain. And so all the people who, I don't know, are earning money in the US and have family in west african countries where their currency is pegged to the euros, they have no means to send this money easily and they get eaten up by the fees. That, I mean, wise is a cool product, but it's still super expensive that all these cross border systems are charging and having forex, deep forex systems.
00:18:45.536 - 00:20:11.524, Speaker B: Well, the interesting thing here is that it's the occasion to prove that finance and blockchain, because it's a driver of speed, of efficiency and of cost savings, well, it can be good for something beyond the speculation. And it's what interests me in building real use cases that can be a driver for people to use blockchains without even caring about whether the price of bitcoin is going to go up or down, but just for the efficiency it enables. And then, you know, if we look, if you look back into like the stablecoin space, and because this forex vision is very particular to us, but if you look into the stablecoin space, where it is going, I think that the trend is similar to what we're observing in the lending market currently with the commodification of stablecoin systems. A stablecoin is very often the composition of a lending borrowing system, what we call a price stability module, and potentially other systems like delta neutral systems, like the ones we see with Ethina, and more and more with new stablecoins emerging. We're saying that down the line, the mission of a stablecoin is to optimize its balance sheet under solvency and liquidity constraints. And this is, I think, the goal for us and for the whole industry for the next year is to show that stable coins, like you can innovate on the technology, be like 30% better. And it's what we try to do, I think, you know, than other incumbents.
00:20:11.524 - 00:20:32.554, Speaker B: But where you can truly stand out is on the risk management layer, on how you can connect all the different verticals that are making the stablecoin space. And I hope we stop seeing new stablecoins launching under like already battle tested primitives that are not bringing any value to the space when value is on the composition of the different key primitives you can have for stablecoin.
00:20:32.894 - 00:20:53.474, Speaker A: Interesting. And so you mentioned the deep integration with lending platforms. So Paul, how do you see this type of integration with this particular type of assets? And how do you view, do you think it will be one of the major asset of all, of all lending platforms in the future? How do you do that?
00:20:53.594 - 00:21:44.334, Speaker C: Right. So I can only agree with what Pablo said on how stablecoin need to behave to compete with one another. Obviously, lending and borrowing is like a very powerful infrastructure for stablecoins to develop themselves. Like if you think of stable coins as kind of investment banks, quote unquote, or central banks, they need to develop adoption of their stablecoin by lending it to different use cases. And lending and borrowing primitives are super useful because they underpin, at the end of the day, investment bank lend and borrow. They're very useful for stablecoin because stable coins are similar to investment bank. What we've seen in Morpho, and it's still the early days of Morpho blue.
00:21:44.334 - 00:23:05.134, Speaker C: We've been deployed three months ago, but we've been interacting with a bunch of different stablecoins already, and most notably was a maker that decided to transition some of their lending and borrowing activities. So they initially forked the AAVE free implementation in a protocol called Spark, and then they realized the security and efficiency and flexibility limits of it very quickly. And then this is where we started having conversation on having Morpho Blue and Metamorpho being the underlying infrastructure for what maker calls subdao. So like maker structure was like some kind of central bank, and then multiple investment banks and investment banks would use like Morpho Blue and Metamorpho as their credit lending engine in order to develop the stablecoin adoption. And so this is what they've done already, like, in order to get exposure to assets like Isna SUsde. So I think they've deposited more than 200 million over the last few few weeks in Morpho and they're looking to go up to 1 billion. And so that's a way for them to grow the revenue for a maker and navigate the different trade offs that Pablo was mentioning, which is risk management and composition of the backing, et cetera, et cetera.
00:23:05.134 - 00:23:31.814, Speaker C: And I think now that we're super unopinionated, as a protocol, there is no limit to who can use it, because it's super unopinionated. And so we've been working with angle as well, on many different things. Part of the USDA backing is on, correct me if I'm wrong, by the way, but I think it's deposited in metamorphos vault. I think it's just a fundamental primitive for any stable coin.
00:23:33.034 - 00:23:48.346, Speaker A: Daniel, from the users you've mentioned, what do you see today as the. The frictions in the stablecoin space in terms of adoption? And what do you think is missing for this particular adoption?
00:23:48.450 - 00:24:12.706, Speaker E: Sure. Yeah. When I joined consensys back in 2018, we had for many years a chief economist and chief tokenonymist. I hope I said that right, named Lex Sakalin. And in 2018, he was running around all these conferences telling all these fintechs that they were going to fail, or at least not be as successful as they were going to be. Turned out he was right, because he said that all industries, they have manufacturing and distribution. You manufacture a car and you sell it.
00:24:12.706 - 00:24:37.118, Speaker E: You manufacture lipstick and you sell it. And many of these fintechs were essentially offering nice distribution, a new ux, but under the manufacturing was just still the old bank rails. Now, in crypto, we're the opposite. We're like, no, we're really changing manufacturing. So this lending protocol, you don't have counterparty risk, you just have systemic risk. That's novel, that's new. Or I can tap liquidity quickly without being KYC or having, like, a credit history.
00:24:37.118 - 00:24:53.222, Speaker E: That's cool. But distribution, we kind of suck, right? So we gotta fix that. So it was essential to fix the manufacturing, but now we gotta do the table stakes of, like, how do you distribute it, right? And we think that's really kind of like two things at Metamask. It's like reading and writing. Right? They're fundamental. That's an. If Americans would get that.
00:24:53.222 - 00:25:12.026, Speaker E: It's a thing they say to you when you're a kid, but what do you do? You read data, you write data, you get it and you put it right. So where do we go wrong? Like writing data. Like, if you're. I love visiting dapps. I love using metamask. I'm sure you all do, but, like, visiting every dapp with metamask is not the ideal situation for many people. Right? If you want to trade programmatically or algorithmically, you can't.
00:25:12.026 - 00:25:33.260, Speaker E: Every defi protocol says, oh, we have an SDK. No one's going to connect to everything one on one. Like, no banks do that. They don't have, like, one to one connection with every other bank they join. Swift. Right? So you need to have, like, a single window for programmatically interacting with people, and then for newbies, like, no one's doing a defi interaction, their first crypto thing, maybe not even their hundredth or thousandth, they're going to be on a centralized exchange forever. And they go, okay, let me hit this defi protocol.
00:25:33.260 - 00:25:51.572, Speaker E: So we need a way that we can write data better, and then even for us, that love extensions and wallets, it's a huge surface attack area. How many things have we seen where there's just, like, an issue that's not like the protocol has been hacked, but, like, some front end dapp thing? So writing sucks now. Reading sucks. How many of you have a metamask? How many of you do defi? Put your hands up. Be proud. There we go. Okay.
00:25:51.572 - 00:26:13.134, Speaker E: Or any other wallet. Rabbi trust, Coinbase, all good. Good. How many of you are in defi? All right, how many are in defi right now? Okay, how many of you could tell me your p and l on your defi positions this week? If I asked you right now, all right, if I gave you a day to go home and do spreadsheets, how many? You could tell? You still couldn't tell me. You have no idea. You're like, maybe I made some money. So, again, reading and writing, they're broken, right? So we created this adapter standard.
00:26:13.134 - 00:26:42.562, Speaker E: It's open source, so others can use it, but then, at least for Metamask and Metamask Institute, oh, by the way, two great contributors right here. Morphos on our first helped us build it out, and angle contributed a great one, too. So, essentially, though, these adapters will allow us to do a few things. They're open source, so other people can use them for us in metamask, institutional, in our GUI, and through our APIs, you can get this p and l on all your defi positions. You can interact with defi protocols. We're going to start doing them, offer them to third parties. So, like, other wallets, custodians, fund admins, accountants, a lot of funds.
00:26:42.562 - 00:27:07.958, Speaker E: I know they go to their fund admin, accountant, they're like, dude, I got to work with these people legally for like Nav and taxes. But essentially, if I was doing equities, they would do work for me. I'm explaining everything, and then they're just giving me the paper back. Why am I paying? Well, I have to. But like, at least now with this, the fund admins and the accountants can actually do your taxes and stuff. And then we also will be integrating in the metamask portfolio dap this quarter. So from the reed perspective, if you have a position, you'll be able to see the p and l there and then in write.
00:27:07.958 - 00:27:28.364, Speaker E: It may take a little bit more time, but just think how nice it would be in the metamask portfolio. You're in one of these great projects. You want to withdraw or deposit more, you can just do it there without visiting the Dapp. So I think that's our vision around kind of fixing distribution, because everyone here who's worked so hard on manufacturing the past few years, great job. The fintechs did not do it, but we got to get back to the table stakes, like making it easy to use.
00:27:28.784 - 00:27:51.542, Speaker A: Cool. And yeah, talking about that, and also about Ux in general at Trustwallet, you launched smart contract wallet recently. Why do you think this type of product is needed in the space? And does it help in general? Like, what does it enable from a user perspective? For example, in the DeFi usage, I.
00:27:51.558 - 00:28:33.214, Speaker D: Think it's kind of close to the distribution issue we just mentioned. If you use the wallet, lots of things are still painful for beginners. I mean, for everyone. That coming from web3 in general, sending up a wallet, a passphrase signing every transaction, these are some painful steps for everyone. The smart contract wallet and the account abstraction help a lot for beginners to remove some of the friction from the wallet setup to the transaction signing. So from a distribution perspective, I truly believe that the smart contract wallet is going to help a lot to involve more people to crypto. What we just mentioned before, it's about lending and stablecoins.
00:28:33.214 - 00:29:05.664, Speaker D: These are the two easiest way for non web free people to start crypto because it's very close and related to what they know in the traditional finance world. Basically, it's a stable coins. It won't fluctuate. It's going to keep the same right that they have in their traditional bank account. And with lending and borrowing, they can enjoy yield. They could do it with their traditional products in the bank account. So basically, this is just new iteration, a more efficient way of doing what people used to.
00:29:05.664 - 00:30:09.400, Speaker D: So the next mission for that is to solve the distribution as has been solved, how we can make that product well known by everyone to make them drop, if I can say, to use their bank account for savings, for example. Since on chain products are way more efficient on chain transferred, cross border transferred with stablecoin as way more efficient. And soon, let's hope, forex is going to also be way more efficient on chain. So the mission of the wallet, it's from all these fabulous protocols built during the last five years. What are the protocol we want to push for our millions of users just to make them way more easier to access. Because if you start and download the wallet, how are you going to find the dapp you want to interact with? It's part of the mission of the wallets, especially the retail one, because we are not addressing qualified investors sometimes. So we have a mission about onboarding them, guiding them, and presenting them the right services, as we did for staking.
00:30:09.400 - 00:30:11.444, Speaker D: We are going to do it for lending too.
00:30:12.184 - 00:30:24.854, Speaker A: Cool. So we have, I think, two minutes left. Maybe you will take one question from the audience before the end. Anyone? Yep. Here maybe just a good one.
00:30:24.974 - 00:31:00.394, Speaker F: You mentioned, you mentioned how there's going to be this distribution kind of opportunity. We've obviously seen some big web, two players, such as revolut, introduce crypto and do it in an interesting way. For those of us who are crypto natives, it's obviously horrible because you know that you don't own your crypto, and it's just a very cool interface using fireblocks on the backend. How do you see your role? Kind of like as a wallet. And that also applies to metamask, like, you know, big metamask customer, like probably everyone here, but the interface still sucks. If you try and send it to, like, your cousin, which interface using, like, it doesn't.
00:31:00.474 - 00:31:01.746, Speaker E: Portfolio dab snaps.
00:31:01.850 - 00:31:18.564, Speaker F: It's better. It's better, but it's still confusing, you know what I mean? So you send it to your cousin and it's really hard. And so then you see someone like, oh yeah, you work in crypto. Okay, great, I bought crypto. And you're like, oh yeah, where? And like, oh yeah, I'm revolut. And then you're like, oh, fuck. So, yeah, I guess there's still a lot of work on the distribution.
00:31:18.564 - 00:31:24.684, Speaker F: Why are fintech still so good at doing this and we in crypto aren't able to do something there?
00:31:25.064 - 00:31:52.564, Speaker E: Like I said, number one is we've been focused on the manufacturing, which is more important, but we're going to get better. We all made a decision today that we're going to work better together on distribution on the metamask. I'll say two things. Number one, via those APIs that I mentioned, it will not for all right, so not your keys, not your coins, whatever. We all believe that. But even if you don't have your own keys, you can still have very expressive, vibrant services. And we hope by offering these APIs, someone like revolut or them can offer a real buffet of Defi, even though the user doesn't have their own key.
00:31:52.564 - 00:32:25.738, Speaker E: So it doesn't solve the sovereignty in custody thing, but it does solve the choice issue. And then you might not know it's metamask when the backend it is. So hit us up if you're a fintech. Number two, I will just say, just to address the metamask usability issues, people have to understand the extension for metamask is like a market infrastructure for DeFi, right? And it's very important that it always works, or, you know, works exceptionally well. So when people ask why it doesn't change all the time, we do innovate in the portfolio dashboard and in the Metamask Institute, you want to use metamask with fireblocks, integration, boom. Institutional, you want to see the p and l in your positions. You can do it in the pDap.
00:32:25.738 - 00:32:50.404, Speaker E: And that's an intentional decision we've made. And yet, new stuff, new cool stuff's coming to the portfolio dashboard. But if you want to see where the new fun stuff is, use our institutional product, use our snaps, use our portfolio dashboard or portfolio DAP, rather, in retail. But the extension by design is kind of where it's at right now. But we will have cool aliasing and stuff for sending coming soon. You'll see some good stuff.
00:32:51.664 - 00:33:36.230, Speaker C: I would even add that the non custodial aspect of it is what makes dux so hard to use. And if you remove the non custodial aspect of it, it, it's essentially web two development, right, for them. And, you know, they update the numbers transaction, they update them at the end of the day. And so it makes it so much easier if you don't have this constraint. And yeah, and I think most recently with like all the account abstraction, you know, workshops that have been going on, I think, you know, Coinbase has released three different wallet infrastructures for different use cases. And those kinds of abstractions are what will bridge the gap essentially between the two, in my opinion.
00:33:36.302 - 00:34:06.804, Speaker B: And beyond this, if I may, I think there is also a security aspect and regulatory blurriness which details many usual financial product distributors from actually distributing DeFi products. And if we don't solve the hacking issues and the regulatory issues with DeFi products, at least Europe tries to regulate. But they don't regulate defi yet. We won't get any major distribution. We won't be able to solve our distribution problems 100%.
00:34:06.964 - 00:34:48.405, Speaker D: Yeah. And at the end it's not a big deal. If private is doing good at onboarding people, I think it's even a good thing for the whole industry because they are going to educate people about what's crypto and the more people are going to be educated about that, the more they are going to move from revolts to self custodial. So it's like what we did at binance on a group level. Binance is a centralized exchange. We help them to launch web3 wallets, which is powered by Trustwallet. And basically it's kind of an intermediate step between the centralized exchange user who are very closer to web two user to try to onboard them in web3 with a sub step between leaving binance for trustwallet.
00:34:48.405 - 00:35:19.094, Speaker D: And I think Revolut is all these fintech and web two companies, they are playing that role. Currently they have a very huge user base, a young user base in Europe for Revolut where people could be interested in crypto, but they don't know where to start. Revolut is a good use case to educate them about it. And then once they're going to be educated enough, and they will want to do more with that, they want to do staking, to do lending, explore dapps, they are going to move on self studio wallet like trust.
00:35:19.754 - 00:35:26.954, Speaker A: Cool. Well, we have next panel in ten minutes with AsICs Z, so thanks everyone, and please round up.
