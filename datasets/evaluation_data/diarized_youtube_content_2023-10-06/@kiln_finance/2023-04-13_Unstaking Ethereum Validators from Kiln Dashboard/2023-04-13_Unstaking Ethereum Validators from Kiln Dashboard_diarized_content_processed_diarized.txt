00:00:00.170 - 00:00:42.470, Speaker A: In this video I'm going to go through unstaking ethereum using the kiln dashboard. So here I am in my kiln dashboard in my whalehouse account where I have a bunch of validators running. So here we're on the Gorely testnet and I can see my validators here. Some I've already requested an exit for, for just earlier today. Some are still running. And I'm going to take one of these validators, click on these three buttons and request an exit. So first I'm asked to connect the wallet that is associated to this validator.
00:00:42.470 - 00:01:56.860, Speaker A: So the wallet that has the withdrawal rights to this validator because that is the only wallet that can actually issue this request. So I'll connect this wallet here. Once it's connected, I can now unstake. So here I get a transaction proposed, I confirm it and what happens behind the scene is from this wallet I issue a message on chain that says I want to exit this validator and then kiln is going to automatically pick up this message and trigger the exit. Okay, so that transaction has now gone through and that means that my validator is now processing and in a short delay, depending on the size of the exit queue on chain, it's going to be automatically exited and your funds will go to the withdrawal wallet that you connected with. So that's it for the flow. Thanks for watching.
