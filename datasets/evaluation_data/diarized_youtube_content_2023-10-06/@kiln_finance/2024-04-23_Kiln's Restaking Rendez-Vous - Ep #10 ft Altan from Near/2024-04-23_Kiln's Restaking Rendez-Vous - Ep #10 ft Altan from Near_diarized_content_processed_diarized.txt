00:00:07.480 - 00:00:20.318, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to a new episode of the Kiln mistaking rendezvous. I'm Edgar, protocol specialist at Kiln, and today we have Altan from the near foundation to talk about the near five finality. AV's Altan, how are you doing today?
00:00:20.486 - 00:00:21.994, Speaker B: Good, man. How about yourself?
00:00:22.414 - 00:00:22.966, Speaker A: Great.
00:00:23.070 - 00:00:23.334, Speaker B: Great.
00:00:23.374 - 00:00:35.494, Speaker A: It's a pleasure to have you on the podcast. To start this off, can you introduce yourself first? Can you give the background story and how did you start working in blockchain?
00:00:35.874 - 00:01:34.864, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm Altan, grew up in Turkey, actually left Turkey when I was 18, studied computer science and math in the US, and then came to London in 2020 during the crisis that everybody remembers to study pretty much AI. So I did my masters in AI at Imperial College London. And the things I've focused on and always focused on has been simulation. So worked in virtual reality before and then ended up like, researching how to train a deep learning model in simulation. And how do you transfer that into the real world without training in the real world? So how has been sort of have interest in kind of simulation, but crypto has never been there, right. So it's always been like software, even hardware, if you think about robotics. And I ended up like in 2021, I was working in this vc called Antler, got really interested in this web3 own everything stack.
00:01:34.864 - 00:02:52.962, Speaker B: How do you. I always believe that everybody should own everything online. And that pulled me into crypto and studying like first studying ethereum, which now we're getting more aligned with to just land it on near. Particularly I was really interested in, well, sharding as a way to scale blockchains, but also I was pretty impressed by Ilya's background in AI, as one of the authors of attention is all you need. So did that, and then arrived in November 2022, did this hackathon in Niercon, which is near a conference in Lisbon, and ended up winning that hackathon. And a couple of folks at the foundation reached out to me saying, hey, we need someone technical that can program and code, but is not just technical. Does more of sales engineering partner engineering where help help partners code, but also explain Nier stack in simple terms, the joint foundation in that time, and been working with the foundation for almost a year and a half now.
00:02:52.962 - 00:04:16.194, Speaker B: And where I ended up sort of going to this near modular thesis is while we were sitting in August 2022, we looked and said, hey, what's the best use case for NIR's technology to bring into rollups, which at that time base just launched in l two. We were doing a study on base internally and said, hey, DA is the first thing to do. DA is very simple. We've already built a very robust data availability solution for sharding. Why don't we take that and then apply it to rollups? And then the second product is, well, we have FAS banality in, in year, which is called doomsluck. Can we bring that to roll ups? And the best way to do that is through eigen layer where you get some of the security and then help Ethereum rollups to settle between them pretty fast. That's what the two products we have is near the a and then obviously the pass finale layer that uses an ERDA as some sort of like a module, as a data availability solution to have that data available for operators to take the data and do something with it.
00:04:16.194 - 00:04:25.794, Speaker B: But yeah, it gives you sort of my story and a bit of how we came to build the products that we're building for rollups.
00:04:26.554 - 00:04:48.174, Speaker A: Great. Let's talk a bit about finality for a second, because a lot of our listeners, I'm sure, are users of rollups, but they don't necessarily understand why finality, and especially fast finality is important for rollups. And maybe you can talk about why it's important for specific types of roll ups versus others.
00:04:48.834 - 00:05:44.946, Speaker B: Yeah, so for, for example, when you're trying to withdraw your eat or in an exchange, let's start with an exchange even, and then go back down. Exchanges actually have to wait almost 64 to 90 slots for Ethereum to finalize, which is around like twelve minutes to give you your date, give you whatever Ethereum on altoos. A lot of exchanges actually don't do that. So if you look at the graphics, binance does it, but there's a lot of exchanges that are below that 64 slot. So basically they give you whatever money without even Ethereum finalizing. So they have to do this very complex logic for Ethereum for you to withdraw and deposit your ETH or any other tokens that you're trying to do. The other thing is when you're bridging actually.
00:05:44.946 - 00:06:21.474, Speaker B: So if you want to bridge from another l two to another l two, the problem with that is for, let's say roll up a and roll up b, for roll up b to take action on roll up a is anything, right? So they have to wait on twelve minutes to take that roll up a state. And the problems with that, if you think about it, is, well, Altan wants to move. Altan is on GMX. Let's say I long this token, I made some money now I want to go to op. I have to wait twelve minutes. That's quite tough. From the user's perspective.
00:06:21.474 - 00:06:56.104, Speaker B: What we do with the finality layer is let's just get rid of that twelve minutes. That's Ethereum's finalization for sure. The transactions will finalize there at some point. Well, let's create this another layer where whenever something happens on rollup a, that layer sees it and then gives that to the roll up b. So in three to 4 seconds, roll up b. Any application, let's say, is aware that this happened on oral pay and it's finalized by some ethereum security from angular. So I feel confident that I should be doing this action.
00:06:56.104 - 00:07:30.124, Speaker B: So the trust model obviously believes like it believes on trust security model, but it gives you this like very sleek user experience that you can design. And for example, I gave this example of Uniswap. Right? Like when you go to uniswap, you still have to do like, oh, you can only do swaps on optimism, arbitrum, whatever. But imagine you should be able to do optimism to arbitrum ETH or something. So that's kind of, yeah, from the problems perspective and how we're thinking about the solution itself.
00:07:31.384 - 00:07:38.684, Speaker A: So if multiple roll ups would share the same finality layer, interoperability would be much easier in the space.
00:07:39.064 - 00:08:36.502, Speaker B: Yes. But the thing is like, the beauty of finality layer is currently they don't have to post their data to anywhere, so they end up like doing their own stuff to Ethereum, whatever. This is another sort of like a sidecar product that basically there's this relayer that looks at the sequencer and says, hey, these are the order of transactions. The relayer takes that data, dumps it to new DA. But it could be just in practice, it could be any data available layer. It's just for us that near the is quite fast, right, two, 3 seconds to finalize. And then when that's finalized, an eigen layer operator basically takes that beta and then runs a full node of, let's say arbitram, right? And it's aware that the arbitrum state is at the point that it should be, and then gives as an API, like using an API gives it to an application that can take that and push it to, let's say optimism.
00:08:36.502 - 00:08:43.354, Speaker B: And then they have sort of like seen the state of Arp already into like in a very short amount of time.
00:08:44.174 - 00:09:20.860, Speaker A: Gotcha. And going back a bit, and you already explained a bit the origin story of Neon modular. My question is, why do you, why do you why did you try to build aliases with Ethereum economic security when you already have like the Niel ecosystem with like a lot of capital there? Why not use just economic security from nil and, but still service roll ups for other ecosystems?
00:09:20.962 - 00:09:49.808, Speaker B: No, that's a very good question. So for the first product near DA Nierd actually uses nearest consensus, which relies on near security. So near security is around, like obviously depends on the time that we're looking at the security. If we looked at it three days ago is like 7 billion market cap, today it was like five. Yesterday it was 5 billion, now it's 6 billion market cap. Right. It uses the staker.
00:09:49.808 - 00:10:56.724, Speaker B: So stake near is around 50% to 60% of near. So roughly around like three to 4 billion security. But for roll ups to sort of like, the first way we started with Eigen layer security is because rollups actually, since they settle on Ethereum and since they finalize on Ethereum, they prefer to have some sort of ethereum security. The product can actually be improved way better if you have this dual staking sort of model where actually Shuram has been talked about quite often these days, where you have two tokens that secure a network, right? So one is probably Eigen layer, and then for the finality layer later, we're actually thinking about another token that either near token or something else that people can stake and give us, like plus Eigen layer, plus near security, which gives more confidence to developers and developers and then the users as well. Yeah, we're thinking about how the security model could change over time and it could be improved.
00:10:57.584 - 00:11:17.272, Speaker A: And did you always have this in mind or did you just meet Eigen layer? And then the idea popped into, into your head, like, what's the, what's the, how was the origin of building an eigen layer?
00:11:17.328 - 00:11:46.554, Speaker B: Av's. Yeah. So we met Shuram, I think, in August, and Shuram had this idea, well, you guys have very fast finality, like, why don't we build something for roll ups? This is something I want, I want in the market. So we've started building just by basically talk to Shuram about it. And hey, this is interesting. And we're building these products that are almost becoming like a near modular team. But then the dual staking actually came through.
00:11:46.554 - 00:12:22.284, Speaker B: A lot of folks that were mentioning to me, oh, why don't you use the near security as well? And sometimes when you're building something, it's also nice to listen to people. You know, you obviously have your own ideas, but building on and just basically in a rabbit hole doesn't help because, like, market usually tells you what, what they want to see. So the dual staking model is definitely something that, like, every person that we meet is like, oh, maybe you guys should do this. And we're like, yeah, that's interesting. We haven't baked into the design yet, but it's something definitely works.
00:12:23.584 - 00:12:49.584, Speaker A: Cool. And there are other finite products building in the AV's space. Can you talk a bit about what's your vision for fast finity as a whole? Do you think it's a winner takes most market? Do you think they are like different trade offs and so there are different, basically options to be picked for every roll up. How do you feel like this competition will play out?
00:12:50.024 - 00:13:21.034, Speaker B: Yeah, so traditionally we did a lot of cross chain, almost like transactions using bridges. Obviously, if you live through the era of 2020 to 2022, you know how painful bridges can get. Right? So there was a lot of hacks in. Well, the ronin hack was there. Second, there was the, there was the wormhole hack. So there's this sort of like security issues. There's always security issues with bridges.
00:13:21.034 - 00:14:08.094, Speaker B: But now we get in this year, we get eigen layer security, and we'll see a lot of folks that are like, we'll try to do the same things. There's two ways to do this, which is crypto economic security, which what we're doing pretty much. And there's also the way to do cryptographic security where you do proof aggregation. That's what ag layer tries to do. We believe, like in the short term, crypto economic security is the way to go because there's already a lot of availability in crypto economic security and it's not as expensive as, as running a prover today. Right. So if you're running a prover, for example, my estimation to run a Polygon CDK roll up, for example, is like two hundred fifty k per year just from the, from the prover itself.
00:14:08.094 - 00:14:59.848, Speaker B: There's some teams that can afford that. There's some teams that can't afford that, right? So I believe the short term is crypto economic with long term being the cryptographic. Now, if we say, like, how do we win in this market? There's obviously the brand value that a lot of people trust, a product and abs that's built, built by near. I've been hearing that from a lot of folks. And I'm thinking also from a perspective of like, if you're actually operating, right, like first maybe you get your tokens through emissions, but if this product goes well and it becomes like almost like bridges. You're actually getting a lot of revenue, right. So if you've staked, let's say restake ETH, your basically yields might come from transaction fees.
00:14:59.848 - 00:15:36.660, Speaker B: And that's quite exciting because, and that's how I see the ABS market to play out because there will be a lot of abs in the bull market and we're already starting to see that. But I think bear market not so much because in the bear market, some of them will be like, well, we're not making money here, so I can't pay anymore. I can pay. And then operators will also just say, hey, this doesn't look right. I'm just going to opt into another product. So that's why I'm thinking. And the plus sort of benefit of our finality layer is that there's a couple of near roll ups that will use this.
00:15:36.660 - 00:15:56.704, Speaker B: They're basically using near DA and it's bundled as the same product. We'll work with these teams to integrate and ideate and then opera engineering services build these cost chain applications. That's why we're thinking how the ABS markets and this market will evolve.
00:15:57.204 - 00:16:13.884, Speaker A: Super interesting. And again, layer is basically like a marketplace for economic security to secure protocols that need a formal consensus. My question to basically all avss is how much economic security do you need?
00:16:14.744 - 00:17:21.256, Speaker B: This depends, right? I think like we start with very small. Like we've just announced the swell partnership which they're willing to give us like 5 million, 500 million security. But I think security is meme, right? Like if everybody can just like all these like rts be like, I'm just giving you a billion dollar worth of, you know, economic security. The form in our case, we need economic security for the number that we're transferring over time, right? So for us, let's say if we're using optimistic roll ups and if the application is like transferring 500 million, we need at least two x of that, right, over that period. So in that case, it's kind of nice to start with a billion. Just ensure that people are comfortable and let people move over 20 million, 10 million small amounts and then build up over time. Because you're actually, yeah, you're actually like transferring money, not some game.
00:17:21.256 - 00:17:42.480, Speaker B: But that's why I think like for games and all the other ones, economic security doesn't really matter. They can just like do deposit withdrawals and security model is not like that important. But for roll ups that want to do like for applications that want to do cross chain transactions, I think it's very important that number makes sense.
00:17:42.632 - 00:18:06.084, Speaker A: And do you have views already about, like, how you envision shared security, pooled security versus attributed security? Like, do you feel like you will likely ask the market for, like, let's say, a dedicated 100 million of value to be attributed only to the fast finality abs?
00:18:06.704 - 00:18:25.204, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is currently like, this. This depends on the traction when we go live. Right. So currently we're testing the software. We're not live on the main net. So this will. I think we'll work with all our teas and say, hey, this is the economic security we need.
00:18:25.204 - 00:19:23.264, Speaker B: Because the problem currently is if you're getting a billion dollar restate ETH, you actually need to be paying 50 basis points. That means, well, 5 million, if my math is correct, paid back almost to the restakers. It's okay to start doing that just to make everybody comfortable, but it's not a sustainable model. Eventually, I think, the yield paid back to restakers will be measured by basically by how much you can pay back. So eventually, we'll just ask these folks be like, hey, I don't think it makes sense to get 500 million. Well, let's go for 100 million. And we know that the revenue is coming substantial and it is sustainable because XYZ.
00:19:23.264 - 00:19:49.204, Speaker B: That's why I see the market being a lot of restrict Ethan going to bunch of ABS's and then eventually will fade out because there will be more options, too. So your job as an AV's is to, I think, and a lot of people will not agree with me then don't talk about it. Is to generate revenue at some point. Because if you're not generating revenue, you're like, your restake ETH might fly somewhere else.
00:19:50.064 - 00:20:12.984, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll talk about incentives a bit later, but for now, I'd like to ask you some questions about timelines. Can you talk a bit about the steps that you're currently following? And could you give us a bit of a hint towards what would be the main net launch or your ideas?
00:20:13.284 - 00:20:37.284, Speaker B: Yeah, we were thinking about Mainnet launch in Q two, Q three. Haven't decided yet. Date yet. So testnet operators will be testing the software in testnet this week. We might actually go faster. It depends on traction, depends on who wants to use it. But we're aware that whenever we go to Mainnet, we'll be paying back.
00:20:37.284 - 00:20:52.134, Speaker B: I would say Q three is a good target to have, but, you know, it's. It's like operators testing it and starting to ensure that everything is secure by, uh, by this, this quarter.
00:20:53.234 - 00:21:16.014, Speaker A: That's clear. And um. And so how many like customer slash roll ups do you expect to, to have at launch? And do you, do you want to have like kind of like a minimum to make sure that you can, you can pay the rest takers or how do you basically, how are you guys doing on the PDF?
00:21:16.354 - 00:21:51.844, Speaker B: Yeah, so currently there was no dedicated PD, so we've been pretty much working on the product. We've actually just started working with a couple of folks. Like some ecosystems, for example, let's say an alt ecosystem, we're talking basically might just commit and say, hey, we'll be using the finality layer to do crosswall transactions. All the near DA customers will get it just by default. Right, like this. So any of any, any applications that want to use this, like, we'll do it, but I think the target audience that we'll go for. And that's why I think Mainnet launch doesn't make sense.
00:21:51.844 - 00:22:20.042, Speaker B: In Q two is like applications that are, for example like Uniswap that want to do cross chain transactions, that it makes sense for them to do three, 4 seconds for the user. Right. It could be. For that reason Dexs are a good target to have also any lending protocols like Aave. All of those would be great. Just to highlight. Our team is four people currently, so we'll expand it over time.
00:22:20.042 - 00:22:37.624, Speaker B: It's like two VD, two engineering, because we've been incubated by near, but that will change very soon. So, yeah, we're thinking that. I think Q three is a good time to kind of like launch with partners in some way. Great.
00:22:38.044 - 00:23:11.544, Speaker A: And now, now let's talk a bit about incentives, because I think at the end of the day, in eigen layer economic security is not very, very, very hard to get. Like most avss, I expect will get more economic security than they actually need. And then my question is like, how do you guys plan on incentivizing that economic security to stay? How do you plan on incentivizing operators and restakers to run the AV's in the long run?
00:23:11.964 - 00:24:02.028, Speaker B: Yeah, so this is a good question. So in the beginning, it's easy. I think we can pay the 50 basis points in the future. What's going to happen is, again, we'll work with everyone to get more cross chain transactions. It could be even, I say, apps, but it could be some wealth manager that has, I don't know, like I have 50 million to move around between l two s and I'll use your, use your protocol to move money around and we won't charge as much as like the benefit of this is we won't charge as much as warmhaul. Warmhole doesn't do any of like ethereum, l two s kind of does, but mainly like l one s, but so we won't charge as much as them. But we will work on a model where we know like l two s will transfer a lot of value across the way.
00:24:02.028 - 00:24:45.934, Speaker B: Maybe we can do something like a portal wormhole ourselves to kind of generate that. But yeah, the domain focused after sort of like finalizing everything like testing pretty much will be on like how to generate sustainable revenue. And that will I think help us to. Again, what I said before is to, because there's a bull market, but survive the bear too. I think like a good product designer should be thinking about already about the bear market because bull market's fat. Like you know, they go up. And so I think incentives would be like in the beginning, like getting, giving maybe near tokens to do the.
00:24:45.934 - 00:25:02.674, Speaker B: To the restakers and operators, but eventually maybe some more incentives which we haven't sort of publicly committed, but eventually taking all those and building those cross chain transactions as we speak.
00:25:03.734 - 00:25:43.064, Speaker A: Interesting. You talked a bit about the form that those incentives could take. We're starting to see some AV's launch with, with Pointsystem. And I think what basically they are saying is that ultimately, like when they have their TGE, it will likely be emissions. Do you, do you plan to have a dedicated token for this AV's or are you working with like the financial. Internally to have some emissions of NIA allocated to AV's restricters? How does that work?
00:25:43.444 - 00:26:17.988, Speaker B: So at the beginning, I think it will be near tokens in the future. Maybe there might be something else. Hopefully we can share that pretty soon. But yes, the incentive would be that if you, let's say, state this so you get some emissions plus some of the revenue from the, from the protocol itself. And I really love that. Sort of what uniswap did is to like 20% to 30%. I think it's like 30% back to stakers.
00:26:17.988 - 00:26:35.964, Speaker B: Right. So. And that increased like grows the sort of crypto economic security. But also it gives some, something back which a lot of like some protocols, like obviously give it back from emissions, but this would come from like fee revenue, which excites me a lot.
00:26:37.064 - 00:26:58.660, Speaker A: Great. And now let's talk a bit about how it is to be an operator in the space kiln will likely be an operator of the near ads. What are the operator requirements? How heavy or light is it? To be a participant in the neo abs.
00:26:58.832 - 00:27:34.988, Speaker B: Yeah. So we did this some math pretty much like running an open. So you would be running full nodes of rollups. So depending on we'll probably start with the bigger l two s just because it's just easier. We know there's more volume there if you do the math. So let's say running for example on average running a node is I think it's a dollar per minute or something. And then we've done the math.
00:27:34.988 - 00:28:13.924, Speaker B: But it won't cost you as much as running. Let's say having one engineer that works on the team, I would assume that it's going to cost an operator plus one engineer or something to run the nodes yearly. Right. So, and that's like the stretch. Like if you really, if we end up running like bunch of full nodes, ideally we can improve the design, right? So full nodes aren't great. It's great to start with full nodes. We should be thinking probably how we should do light nodes because light nodes are way cheaper.
00:28:13.924 - 00:28:44.350, Speaker B: But for that we probably need some, yeah, probably need some zero knowledge, which again it costs us. Actually people talk about light nodes as cheap but actually light nodes are pretty expensive. Ck side. So there's a balance there. Right. How do you sort of prove, how do you restate eventually? That's why I think it makes sense to go to zero knowledge but not as of today. But yeah, our UlTR is that like it should cost you max one engineer.
00:28:44.350 - 00:28:47.222, Speaker B: But I don't think it's gonna be like that for a while.
00:28:47.358 - 00:28:47.798, Speaker A: Okay.
00:28:47.846 - 00:28:48.174, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:28:48.254 - 00:29:12.334, Speaker A: And that's really if we stretch it out and, and you guys like support like many many roll ups. Would you have also like a way for operators to do like specific roll ups and you also maybe plan to fragment your AV's in saying like this is the finality. AV's for this. This is definitely, this will look kind of like what ATL is doing with Mac.
00:29:12.454 - 00:29:40.634, Speaker B: Yeah we can do that. So what we can do is I mean there's like a bunch of operators, right? They aggregate. So they basically put a test station saying hey this is the state account. You can actually have a bunch of nodes that are doing like op, bunch of nodes that are doing Arp, bunch of nodes that are doing something else. And then within those like nodes that will go. And then eventually we'll go to aggregator again. If you have a lot of operators that's easy to do.
00:29:40.634 - 00:30:18.914, Speaker B: If you don't have a lot of operators that's not great so much. The goal is to be better than 14 guardians or 16 guardians for wormhole. But eventually the more revenue or the system will actually grow itself. Yeah, I think it's an interesting sort of design choice that you make at the beginning. Everybody will be running it because you don't have that many operators. If eigenlayer grows, and again, that's the bet everybody makes, then it's easier to agree that there's going to be a lot of operators that will join the network.
00:30:19.894 - 00:30:26.794, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely. And my follow up question is.
00:30:28.794 - 00:30:29.106, Speaker B: Do.
00:30:29.130 - 00:30:49.814, Speaker A: You plan basically to have this active set of operators to be pretty much permissionless or would you have a minimum of TVL at the beginning, for example, we're seeing eye candy that requires operators to have a minimum of 320 ETH to opt into their ads. How do you plan to do that?
00:30:50.194 - 00:31:18.814, Speaker B: We haven't thought about that yet, but it makes sense from an eigenvalue perspective that because they'll have immediately some customers that would want to use eigenvalue and demand that. So for us, this depends on how much volume we expect from transactions itself. Right. Like there's a lot. Yes. Will increase over time. The problem with 320 ETH is that actually becomes very centralized as a DA solution.
00:31:18.814 - 00:32:00.734, Speaker B: You don't want that to happen. You actually want smaller and smaller, like sort of operators to attest and then kind of gets, you know, they all get like attestations. But again, the availability of capital is like there's a lot of big sort of operators too, right. So kind of want to start from them and then go down the list just to ensure. But you want to, you know, you want to maintain a good number at least to say that this system is decentralized, just, you know, like nearest, probably like what? 200 validators, obviously 200 operators, very hard to get to. It's not going to happen for a while, but five to ten operators to start. This is probably good.
00:32:00.734 - 00:32:02.450, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:32:02.482 - 00:32:35.574, Speaker A: And about decentralization, do you feel like since there will pretty much only be a small numbers, number of operators, they'll be able to run a lot of AVss? Do you see this as a centralization risk because like maybe like one operator will be able to, to run a near fast finality, but will not be able to opt into Eigenv or some other AV's that is more restrictive with its active set? Do you see that as a risk in the long run?
00:32:35.874 - 00:33:04.114, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, in the short term, I mean there's not even slashing. Right. So if you think about it like there's a lot of, there's a lot of trust that you give to Eigen layer. I mean, all of us trust Eigen layer in some case. But in the future, I think, I honestly think the market will settle itself. The invisible hand, like from Adam Smith. It's very old book, but still, we'll figure it out itself.
00:33:04.114 - 00:33:38.732, Speaker B: I agree. There's going to be some abs's that are like, oh, well, I don't want to run this thing because the APY comes from some weird stuff. Not that it's here yet, but the market will get very saturated eventually. Those will be flushed out, be like, hey, and I think that's entry to the bear. You're going to see a lot of these kind of flush out and the ones that sustain will go through another cycle. So that's how I see it. I think there's a centralization risk in staking and everything.
00:33:38.732 - 00:34:28.624, Speaker B: If you think about like for example, you guys, right? You guys run a bunch of different stakers as well, right? Like, I guess like probably not near, probably around Solana, probably run any of these. I'm not worried about the operator side because they are more like as long as there's the incentive, right? There's incentives, emissions and stuff. But eventually, like kiln would say even to, let's say some ex AV's be like, I don't know, man, I'm not going to run this anymore. So you can just pull out eventually, maybe you end up running like two, three, because you trust. And there's like a couple that will run like ten. So the market will sort of resolve itself, right? Because it's a new primitive. And just like everything in crypto 2017, we didn't know what to do with this stuff, right? Like that, there's more exciting stuff going on.
00:34:28.624 - 00:34:30.984, Speaker B: So that's how I see it.
00:34:33.164 - 00:34:52.064, Speaker A: Great. And if we kind of zoom out now and we look at kind of restating as a whole, like what do you, what's your long term vision for how the Eigen layer ecosystem will evolve? What kind of AVss would you like to see in the future you think we'll see?
00:34:52.804 - 00:35:42.324, Speaker B: Yeah. So from our perspective, I really like this idea and vision for. I also expressed this in my Twitter as well. I see Eigen layer as a way to extend some great futures of near other l one and bring that to Ethereum. It is this intersection between for us, it's sharding fast finality, cheap transactions, all of that. And even think about this as kind of like intersection group, right? And then you have like Eigen layer as like flexibility, Ethereum security and then I want to be building in the intersection where I take great stuff from near or another blockchain. Right.
00:35:42.324 - 00:36:10.178, Speaker B: And then bring that to the Ethereum ecosystem. Right. I mean, today that's, that's for us is obviously like fast finality. Obviously DA is almost like it's possible to do DA as well. It's just that we've never thought about how you would do this with Eigen layer. But also I would think about more like if let's say something that's Ilia is pushing through on AI. That's basically something makes sense for people.
00:36:10.178 - 00:36:23.654, Speaker B: Also have a background. I would push that. Right. So like how do we build these sort of abs? A couple of AbS's in the marketplace that are using the superpowers of Nier but benefits others.
00:36:25.314 - 00:36:57.282, Speaker A: Super cool. What do you think about restaking as a whole and competitors Eigen layer? We've seen recently some competitors announced raises. So we now know that there will be competition on the restaking market. Technically, restaking was kind of started by the, the Cosmos hub. So it's not, there was never like only one actor. Like do you think there is room for more than one rest taking hub?
00:36:57.458 - 00:37:23.390, Speaker B: I think so, yeah. Just like any market. I think it's also healthy for the market to have different restaking options. You know, it always gives people better service. It will give everybody better security. I see like I've been seeing sort of start to see bitcoin restaking. I'm not sure how that would work because like you don't restate, you don't state bitcoin.
00:37:23.390 - 00:38:04.880, Speaker B: Right? Kind of like the idea that you would think is like you send an address, you block it and then there's a lot of trust assumptions. Maybe you build like decentralized nodes on top of that locked address. But I see that over time there will be, there's going to be just like every market. I see this market as like maybe one or two players. I don't see it as a like hundred players because there's this trust assumption. And like the more Eigen lair succeeds, the bit easier for everyone to come into Eigen layer and say, hey, I'm going to restake from there. But if there are some smart people that come in and have a better approach than Eigen layer, they will also capture market share.
00:38:04.880 - 00:38:35.874, Speaker B: Just like operating systems. Pretty much. I mean, you started with, I guess you have the main two, which is the windows and Linux. They have different approaches. Obviously, Mac uses the Linux based operating system. I think we'll see that two, three, and then depends on how we end up with this bull market. You never know in crypto, where something happens in security issue and everybody's perception of something changes.
00:38:35.874 - 00:38:40.674, Speaker B: Which makes crypto an interesting place.
00:38:41.174 - 00:39:13.744, Speaker A: Absolutely. And my last question is, Nier is launching avss, and in that it kind of is aligning itself more with Ethereum. This is a very interesting, interesting move from what we call vulgarly an outlier one. When we talk about ETH competitors, do you feel like other outlier ones will take the same path and try to provide value for the modular space in Ethereum?
00:39:14.364 - 00:39:57.082, Speaker B: Yeah. So we have an interesting positioning here because actually our founders, Delia and Alex, they wanted to build sharding for Ethereum back in the day. They actually have governance forums. They were contributing the governance. It turns out they wanted to build a sharded blockchain. But then when they were thinking about it, it was really hard to pass through the governance forums in Ethereum. They were like, it's actually more beneficial for us to build and shard a blockchain ourselves, not basically busting, going through all these governance stuff like waiting to build.
00:39:57.082 - 00:40:26.664, Speaker B: Right. So we have that unique positioning. A lot of sort of, when Nier came in, a lot of folks were saying that, oh, Nier is like Ethereum 2.0, sort of actualized. So we have that sort of historical relationship, and we still keep, like, we kept like a lot of sort of very friendly to Ethereum folks from over the years. So it was kind of easy for us to go and say, hey, we're actually doing Da. We're actually doing this.
00:40:26.664 - 00:41:11.864, Speaker B: So I don't like, not from the new generation l one's, I expect into this to this extent, but I already started seeing some of the paralyzed evms having their own stacks because, like, I know that Sei has its own paralyzed VM stack. So I see that happen, but not to the certain degree. I'm pretty sure there will be some older generation l one s that will come and try to build an abs. It wouldn't surprise me. But I don't think that's Solana. I don't think that's Solana. Folks are going to do that.
00:41:11.864 - 00:41:23.684, Speaker B: They have a very, they have a very different sort of approach to the world in terms of how they think about decentralization. So, yeah, that's how I see the market play out.
00:41:24.384 - 00:41:37.084, Speaker A: Great. Well, thank you so much for your time. Thanks for coming on the podcast. Where can we send people to learn more about the finality? Av's, where can we follow you on Twitter? Av?
00:41:37.384 - 00:41:56.068, Speaker B: Yeah, my Twitter is misteraltandotar. It's pretty basic. Just add mister in the beginning. So there is a documentation on superfast finale layer. It is not fully live, but I can send it to you folks how that would work. And then you can go nearmodular.com comma.
00:41:56.068 - 00:42:23.804, Speaker B: Also the data about Da it is prior EIP 4844 and how it's cheaper. It was cheaper compared to Ethereum. That data will change because we still haven't collected flow enough data after yeah, before 844 to be able to say hey, near day is this much cheaper. And then yeah, those are the main sort of three kind of documents that is useful.
00:42:25.224 - 00:42:33.104, Speaker A: Amazing. Perfect. Well, to the audience, we'll see you on the next podcast. And again, Adan was great to chat with you.
00:42:33.224 - 00:42:34.840, Speaker B: Thanks Edgar. Bye.
