00:00:07.360 - 00:00:21.130, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to a new episode of the Kiln restricting rendezvous. I'm Edgar, protocol specialist at KiLN, and today we have the pleasure of welcoming Felix from ARPA Network to talk about the ArPa abs. Felix, how are you doing today?
00:00:21.590 - 00:00:32.360, Speaker B: Great. Yeah. It's my honor to be on the show talking about ARPA network and our recent launch of ArPa Av's with Igalair.
00:00:33.060 - 00:00:45.932, Speaker A: Yeah. Very excited for this episode. To kick things off, maybe you could first introduce yourself and maybe give us the history of how you started working in the world of blockchain and crypto.
00:00:46.116 - 00:01:22.674, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So I was born and raised in Beijing, and then I went to New York for college at 17 years old. And during college, actually, I heard about bitcoin for the very first time from one of our professors. He actually transferred to each of us in that seminar, a little bit of bitcoin, but unfortunately I lost the wallet and it's long gone. But that was the first impression. And then I was working in a hedge fund and also a fintech venture capital for, you know, after college.
00:01:22.674 - 00:01:59.210, Speaker B: And then that was when I was, you know, introduced to bitcoin, read a white paper and decided to enter the industry. So I quit my job and started ARPA in early 2018. So it's been six years. It's been quite a journey and, yeah, so, like, you know, it's such a pleasure to work with you guys. Clean and also Eigen layer on the AV's, which I think is a great success. And also it actually makes a lot of business sense to integrate with Eigen layer to have more decentralized node network.
00:02:01.110 - 00:02:24.350, Speaker A: Yeah, we're definitely excited as well. One thing that struck my mind when I prepared for this meeting is that it seems that ARPA network has been around for quite a long time. This is not your first cycle and probably not even your. Your second. Could you talk a bit about the origin story of ARPA network and how the project evolved over the years?
00:02:25.410 - 00:02:56.770, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. It has been quite a long time, three cycles to be exact. And we have always been looking for new use cases and we actually pivoted several times. So when we started in early 2018, me and my co founders, we got PhD degrees in cryptography from Tsinghua University, one of the top universities in China. The four of us got together. We have business background, investment background, and also computer science and cryptography background.
00:02:56.770 - 00:04:05.542, Speaker B: So we got together and think about what can we achieve with cryptography like multiparty computation. At first, we wanted to do privacy preserving, data analysis, data analytics for companies, right. So that we can get results from all these analysis without exposing any, the part, any of the party's raw data. But later on, like we found, you know, there's a lot of obstacles when we talk to enterprises, none of them trust the technology, none of them trust, you know, a new type of cryptography, because back then, multiparty computation was like, very few people know about it. So we switched to crypto, and then we tried to get some new use cases using multiparty computation with blockchain. So that is how we entered into the crypto space. And we were at first exploring the general purpose multiparty computation, but turned out the communication overhead and also the computational overhead is way too heavy, uh, to, to be used with, with blockchain.
00:04:05.542 - 00:04:47.326, Speaker B: Right. And then, you know, actually in 2021, uh, we switched to a more specific algorithms called threshold signature schemes. And then we use threshold BLS signatures, uh, to be better combined with the blockchain. And now, you know, with threshold BLS network that ARPA network has, we can provide, you know, random number generators. We can be the infrastructure for cross chain bridges and a lot more use cases that we are in development. So that is a brief history of ARPA network. We are backed by some good investors like finance labs, Defi Capital, Nomura, etcetera.
00:04:47.326 - 00:04:55.930, Speaker B: So we keep working on new use cases and we keep trying to bring value to the blockchain ecosystem.
00:04:57.560 - 00:05:25.880, Speaker A: Great. And so you already started to dive a bit in the technicals. You mentioned threshold signature schemes, TSS and BLS. Can you talk a bit, try to explain to our audience how does these signature schemes differ from, let's say, ECDSA signatures and what can they enable for the webp space?
00:05:26.260 - 00:06:07.934, Speaker B: Of course. Yeah. So there are, so basically, like, you can think about the threshold signature schemes as a way to basically do the distributed key generation. So none of the parties hold a full key, like a full private key. So for a group of nodes together, they will generate, they will do the key, the key share distribution. And then whenever they submit a partial signature, they need to reach like a threshold, for example, three out of five, or like five out of ten. So that is a threshold to be able to submit, to combine the signatures and then submit to the blockchain.
00:06:07.934 - 00:07:05.040, Speaker B: So that is kind of the overview of threshold signature schemes. And the reason why we chose threshold BLS over special ECDSA is that there are several characteristics for BLS signatures. For example, BLS signatures are easier to do, the aggregation. You can combine thousands or even more of these partial BLS signatures together. Using very fast computation and the communication overhead is very low as well. Also, to combine these BLS signatures, deterministic, meaning that the threshold BLS signatures are not prone to a board attack or to like cherry pick. So that is how we build our first use case, like the random number generator called rancast, because it can only be enabled by threshold BLS signatures.
00:07:05.040 - 00:07:25.520, Speaker B: So there are superior characteristics about BLS signatures over ECDSA. That's why we chose BLS. However, the network itself can support different types of signatures if you want, depending on the use case. It's just like ARP. For our random number generator, we have to use BLS.
00:07:27.900 - 00:07:46.110, Speaker A: Gotcha. You already talked about verifiable random number generator. Could you talk a bit about something, the different types of products that ARPA is building, and more specifically what types of use cases they serve?
00:07:46.770 - 00:08:57.318, Speaker B: Of course, yeah, it's always good to talk about the real use case, whatever the value that the end user or the projects that need from an infrastructure project like us. For example, the random number generator product is called ARPA Rancast. We provide basically two values. One is a verifiable random number generator. Randomness is very important, like in computer science, there is no true randomness, because true randomness only exists in the nature, the noise in the atmosphere or the noise in the chips, the lava lamp, for example. However, like, the reason why we do verifiable randomness is that we try to verify like the integrity of the algorithms, right? So basically we can prove that algorithms are, you know, are righteously executed. So that is the, you know, that is the good part about VRF, verifiable randomness.
00:08:57.318 - 00:10:10.098, Speaker B: And the good part of verifiable randomness generated by threshold signature scheme compared to a VRF verifiable random function, is that threshold signature schemes use a group of nodes instead of using just one node, and it removes the single point of failure. And because of the threshold, it's harder to collude and to cherubic or to abort to get that randomness that a cheater wants. So it can be used in a lot of ways. For example, for example in lotteries, let's say community lotteries, gamblings, games, we actually make several experiments in fully onchain games, which we think is a very interesting niche. And if you talk about blockchain consensus, how to choose a node for the block reward, et cetera, you can also use verifiable randomness. That is the use case for verifiable randomness. The other thing that we innovate and we try to work upon is the developer experience for ARPA Rancast.
00:10:10.098 - 00:10:34.380, Speaker B: We provide a set of SDKs that Dapps can just integrate within a couple lines of codes. So it's very flexible. We actually build a lot of templates based on different use cases, from draw a lottery to roll a dice to more complex algorithms like sorting or other algorithms.
00:10:35.160 - 00:10:35.512, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:10:35.536 - 00:10:58.874, Speaker B: So basically it's very easy to integrate, is cheap, and it's also tamper proof and verifiable. That is Arpa Rancast. We are also working on several other projects on the application level that can leverage the ARPA network, for example, across chain messaging, protocol, and some other efforts that we are exploring right now.
00:10:59.042 - 00:11:14.490, Speaker A: Great. All of these products, the one you mentioned, they were existing before the existence of Eigen layer. Can you talk a bit about, from a builder's perspective, your choice to move to an AV's?
00:11:15.790 - 00:11:58.578, Speaker B: Of course, yeah. So I would say like, there are several aspects that I like about Eigen layer. So first of all is from the business perspective, when I first look at Eigen layer as a DeFi OG who played around all these different DeFi protocols during 2019 and during 2020 DeFi summer, it's very hard to find kind of the real yield for ETH. And that was when I first looked at Eigen layer. I was like, wow, you can use your staked ETH to do more work and then to get more yield, which is a really good business model. So that's why I instantly got interested into it. I got interested into Eigen layer.
00:11:58.578 - 00:13:06.490, Speaker B: And after that, as I dive deeper into the shared security and all these technicality of it, I feel like I talked to my co founders. We have to integrate, we have to be part of this initiative and try to be one of the first AV's to ever go live. And that is from a business perspective and from a shared security perspective, it's very hard for a network like a infrastructure project like us to Bootstrap, to be really as decentralized as possible. In the past, we also whitelisted some renowned node providers like instones, Rockx and several others. However, we always try to be more decentralized, try to onboard more renowned, respected, no service providers Eigalaire, give us this chance. Basically we can reach out to more people. And then there are a lot of new node providers that join on board, like you guys.
00:13:06.490 - 00:13:49.750, Speaker B: Also, because we try to combine the MPC aspect of ARPA network with Eigen layer. So basically, instead of staking ARPA now, no providers can stake eth. And maybe in the future, they can do dual staking everything. It's good for us, it's good for the network, and it's good for our clients who are using our random number generator. And in the future, we're going to have new applications that's holding even more security and even more TVL. I think that is a huge step for us to go more decentralized for open network.
00:13:50.930 - 00:14:12.850, Speaker A: Gotcha. It makes a lot of sense. And would you say that if you were to restart your ARPA journey today, you would make it? You would create a network that would solely rely on Eigen layer and restate e? Or do you think you would still keep the ArpA network with AHRPA as economic security?
00:14:15.630 - 00:14:50.538, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's a really good question. Several projects that built exclusively on Eigen layer. For me, I am more familiar with our architecture, which combined ARPA network with Eigen layer. I would probably go from that standpoint. I would say that the core for the ARPA network is the multiparty computation part. We adopt cryptography. It's not a purely economic incentives or economic security that we adopt.
00:14:50.538 - 00:15:27.800, Speaker B: It's more the cryptography and the math that's behind it. So I think pure shared security from the economic incentives is good. However, I think the ultimate goal is to still use cryptography or math to really do the verifiable work. At least that is my thoughts. Maybe when I started there's Eigen layer, maybe our architecture would be a little bit different, but it's a big hitch. Gotcha.
00:15:28.540 - 00:15:59.220, Speaker A: Talking about Eigen layer as this security marketplace. How do you feel, what do you feel your needs are in terms of economic security? And have you started to think a bit about like the different security that Eigen layer offers? There is shared security, attributed security, and even inter subjective security brought by the Eigen token. Have you already thought about like what you're going to purchase in this marketplace?
00:16:00.840 - 00:17:12.384, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean like, Eigalaire definitely has a lot of things that offers like, I'm still exploring, I'm still exploring the ecosystem as well. However, I'd say that for now, shared security from all these no providers to build ARPA network into a more decentralized network is good for our current product, verifiable random number generator. And if we build more applications that hold more tvl, I think it's super beneficial because it just gives us more confidence, gives our users, no matter if it's dapps or applications or end users, give us a lot of more confidence that this whole network is guaranteed by all these shared securities, we will definitely adopt more, I would say like adopt more share security from the marketplace depending on the use case. Specific use cases. Gotcha.
00:17:12.512 - 00:17:51.840, Speaker A: And maybe kind of a random question, but do you feel like it could also be possible that ARPA as an alias over base for economic security and that it could potentially like have some downside effect? Because like the, in a way, for an AV's, the economic security that you can get on eigen layer is kind of infinite because just for the sole reason that eigenvalue, RTVL and more broadly Ethereum staking market cap is so huge compared to any type of need that an AV's may have. What do you think there?
00:17:52.870 - 00:18:34.530, Speaker B: Um, well it's a, it's actually a tricky thing, right. Like, because right now there is no slashing Eigen layer. So, uh, you know, all these operators try to onboard as many AV's as possible. It's kind of like a test flight. Right. But you know, as Eigen layer matures, I think, you know, as a matter of time that we introduce the slashing mechanisms and at that time, people will care more about the risk reward, the operators and the risk takers will care about the risk reward. And it's actually very important to choose the AV's that operators participate in.
00:18:34.530 - 00:19:39.452, Speaker B: So, yeah, I would say that this is a whole new effort that is a whole new ecosystem that is still, people are still exploring into it for overpaying the shared security. I think it really depends on the use case. If you hold a lot of tvls, if it's very mission critical, holds a lot of money, then you definitely need more shared securities. But the reason why our first use case is to do the random number generator is that it doesn't hold that much money for a network that is not decentralized enough, like our old ARPA network, without the support from Eigen layer. That's a use case that is suitable for a small scale use case. Yeah, so I think it all evolves and we try to basically generate fair revenue for the operators. And I think we'll probably cover that in the later part.
00:19:39.452 - 00:19:49.420, Speaker B: But then we designed these tasks and then. So the operators can participate and get rewards. Yeah, so that's that.
00:19:50.440 - 00:20:40.844, Speaker A: Gotcha. Yeah, and also I wanted to take the time to congratulate you because you guys just released the ARPA AbS on Eigen layer mainnet. And I think that was last week, if I'm not mistaken. So congrats on that. And yeah, I would love to understand like in the context of Eigen layer and maybe ARPA more broadly. What's next on your roadmap? Like what type of actions are you going to switch to? What type of work are you going to ask from the Eigenaire operator in the future? And can you talk a bit about your roadmap for new product integrations or maybe updates on like business development wise on people using the random number generator, things like that?
00:20:41.012 - 00:21:09.038, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Right? So like we view that the Eigen layer is a great bootstrap on the supply side, right? So like, you know, it's kind of like a marketplace. Like ARPA network is also a marketplace, right? So like we have the suppliers, which are the operators, you know, the nodes. And that, you know, that can be as decentralized as possible, made possible by, by Aguilar. On the other side is the demand. The demand comes from our products. Like ARPA.
00:21:09.038 - 00:21:53.722, Speaker B: Rank has the random number generators. Right now there are more than a dozen of games fully on chain games, lotteries, et cetera. All these dapps are requesting random numbers, mostly on layer tubes. Currently we request operators to integrate with several L2s that we have live rancast service on it like base, Optimism, Redstone, etcetera. So I think on that part we will definitely go out and go out and advertise that right now ARPA network is more decentralized. The rank cast is even harder to manipulate. That is one.
00:21:53.722 - 00:22:36.508, Speaker B: The other one is we are exploring the fully action game, which is a small niche, but we built this interesting tug of war fully onion game called Deer Dear and it actually has been a great success. We had more than 3000 players on Redstone. It's a finite game, only lasts for two weeks for season one. Right now it's on base, which is our season two. And the stats is really good. We try to get some traction in the fully onchain game side so that more fully on chain game will integrate ArpA rancast for the randomness. So that is on the application side.
00:22:36.508 - 00:23:18.520, Speaker B: And we have a team that's building a cross chain messaging protocol and for that one that will definitely hold more TBL and require more shared security from Idleregh. So I'm really optimistic and really bullish on that part. That is something we always wanted to do, but in the past we were a little concerned because our network is not decentralized enough. That is the roadmaps that we have on the demand side. As the market evolves, we'll definitely explore into other use cases as well.
00:23:18.980 - 00:23:36.680, Speaker A: Great. And my question is then how does this demand translates into revenue and incentives for the restakers and the operators like kiln to support the ARPA network.
00:23:38.180 - 00:24:56.320, Speaker B: Definitely, yeah. So as of right now, so there are two parts of rewards. So the first part is the actual computation, submission of partial signatures, participation in the group rotation, participation as the coordinator to put all these verifications on chain. So there's a set of tasks depending on if it costs high gas fee and also depends on the computation difficulties of the test. So we designed different reward for, let's say like submitting a partial signature, which is the lightest, or being a coordinator to combine the signatures and put it on chain, which involves gas fee. And for all these gas fee heavy tasks, we actually refund the Gatsby to operators, including setting up the nodes, participation in the group rotation, et cetera. So we refund the fees and on top of that we will also give out ARP token as a reward for these computation tests.
00:24:56.320 - 00:25:54.380, Speaker B: However, these computation tests depends on the demand by how many requests of random numbers and also how many requests from cross chain transactions. It really depends on the robotness and also the demand of the network. That is the first part. The second part is we are still designing the reward mechanisms for operators so that as long as they participate and as long as they do the work, basically keep a high uptime, then we'll give out some ARPA token periodically. Yes. So we are still designing the second part. And maybe in the future if we adopt dual staking mechanisms, the reward will be also different from that category.
00:25:54.380 - 00:25:55.980, Speaker B: We'll see.
00:25:57.040 - 00:26:07.730, Speaker A: There might be a future where I like, I don't necessarily have to pay in ARPA for the ARPA network task, but I could potentially pay in either USDC.
00:26:11.190 - 00:26:27.080, Speaker B: Yes. Yep. Yeah. So I mean like as of right now it's all paid in ARPA. And in the future we definitely accept more payment methods for sure.
00:26:27.740 - 00:27:08.370, Speaker A: Great. Okay, great. We talked a bit about the incentives. Let's go a bit towards the costs and also the risks for the rest takers. Can you talk a bit about the way that you have designed the AV's? What are operators actually running in the backend and how are they being basically like prevented from not acting nefariously for the ARPA network? Have you already thought about the type of slashing constraints you're going to put on operators?
00:27:09.870 - 00:28:27.866, Speaker B: Right. So when we design ARPA network before Eigen layer, we put a lot of thoughts into security deposits, slashing, et cetera. The whole purpose is to foster this very hard to temper threshold signature scheme group, depending on how many nodes are there in the same group. And how long should we rotate the groups so that majority of the nodes will collude in the same? So that's how we have a lot of designs and mechanisms in place to prevent colluding. And uptime is also another factor, so we don't want to have failed requests from the Dapps. So basically in the backend, the nodes are running the multi party computation, more specifically threshold BLS signature schemes. And then so they do the DKG process, distributed key generation process, which not all the time, like not doing all the time.
00:28:27.866 - 00:28:58.480, Speaker B: So it's like once per period of time, and after that they per request they will submit partial signatures. And there's a coordinator, there are several computational nodes. The coordinator will combine the signatures and then put it on chain. So the cost associated to that is the gas fee for the coordinator. And for these computation nodes, it's more just the computation of the partial signatures. Partial signatures.
00:29:00.220 - 00:29:37.630, Speaker A: Makes sense. And last questions on operators. You clearly clarified the importance of decentralizing all of these operations and try to be as efficient as possible when it comes to uptime. Do you have a target of how big of a set of operators you want to welcome to ARPA network and to the AV's? Or do you think that you'll be able to achieve better efficiency in terms of network uptime if you have a smaller number of operators?
00:29:39.290 - 00:30:37.790, Speaker B: Right? Yeah. It also depends on the demand, let's say, because it's not like all the operators are in the same group. We rotate the groups and we have five or ten nodes in one group. So if we have a lot of demands, then we need to have more groups so that we can fulfill these requests in parallel. For now, our target is to have at least 50 nodes, some of them, they're already supporting the ARPA native nodes, some of them coming from eigen layer operators. As of right now, I think there are more than 25 operators getting onboarded. I think there are several already live, and most of them are going through the onboarding docs and we'll see.
00:30:37.790 - 00:30:41.470, Speaker B: Yeah, we expect them to go live within the next weeks.
00:30:42.930 - 00:31:19.650, Speaker A: Great. You mentioned earlier that you are very interested in eigen layer, even before deciding to build an AV's on top of this restaking hub. Can you talk a bit about your long term vision for restaking? What do you think that restating actually enables for the crypto space, and how do you think it will shape the ecosystem? And looking in, let's say, five years, one crypto cycle, what will have changed in the space that would not have changed if restating was not there.
00:31:21.220 - 00:31:56.778, Speaker B: Yeah. Okay. So also, I will start with the business perspective. I came from a business or a finance background. I studied finance and information systems at New York University, best known for their business school. So, like Wall street, recently sec approved ETF for Ethereum. The main difference for ethereum versus bitcoin is that Ethereum has a yield.
00:31:56.778 - 00:32:24.974, Speaker B: Staking yield. On top of that. Is the restaking yield coming from the abs or some other incentives? Wall street loves that. Wall street loves real yield. And I think that will eventually drive a lot of inflow from ETF or from Trev five or from like, boomers into Ethereum. Compared to even bitcoin, bitcoin is more like gold. It's not generating cash flow.
00:32:24.974 - 00:32:50.672, Speaker B: But if you can do a DCF on Ethereum plus the burn, then I think Wall street will go crazy on it. Maybe can be quite a strong driver to flip bitcoin. The ethereum to flip bitcoin because of that. So that was when I first look at Eigen layer. I was like, wow, you know, it's amazing. Yeah.
00:32:50.776 - 00:32:52.416, Speaker A: And that was two years.
00:32:52.488 - 00:32:54.460, Speaker B: That was around two years ago. Yeah.
00:32:55.680 - 00:33:14.830, Speaker A: Okay, so, like, we, right now the ETF's are getting approved. Unfortunately, they are not staked. So I think eventually we'll see some staked ETF because it makes sense. It's the risk free yields of the platform. But you would be predicting restate ETF.
00:33:16.090 - 00:34:05.380, Speaker B: Whoopsie. Yeah, I mean, like today, like, sec dropped all the investigation into east 2.0, right? So which means, like, maybe in the future we'll see like, the state ETH ETF, and just a matter of time that people ask for more yield. And if eigen layer becomes strong enough and then battle tested, time tested, no slashing whatsoever, then I think there's, yeah, I can definitely see a restate ETH ETF being approved and then being traded, which offers at least like 5% more yield than staked ETH, which is like super attractive to a lot of these traditional investors, institutional investors.
00:34:05.880 - 00:34:59.210, Speaker A: Yeah, very interesting and definitely true. I mean, this is, this is the, definitely like the, what's attracting, what will attract Wall street to, to ethereum in the long term. And you mentioned that this could be potentially a driver for ETH to, to slip bitcoin. And you don't see it clearly, but I'm wearing a haft, a bitcoin hats, so I need to defend my horse a little bit here and talk a bit about protocols that are building sort of restaking or they call it. Bitcoin staking, basically re hypothecating bitcoin economic security to pretty much build eigen layer competitors, and one of them is Babylon, for example. So what do you think about the competition there in the risk taking space? About not using ETH as economic security, but using bitcoin or other assets?
00:35:04.390 - 00:35:34.010, Speaker B: I've heard of Babelong. However, I'm not too familiar about their tech. I'm not sure if you can build complex smart contract or anything similar compared to Ethereum on top of bitcoins. I'm not too sure. I'm not familiar. I don't know. It seems to be like a plausible theory that you can also do the share security for bitcoin, which is even more decentralized.
00:35:34.010 - 00:35:39.970, Speaker B: Yeah, but I mean, yeah, I'm just not sure.
00:35:41.190 - 00:36:27.920, Speaker A: No worries. And maybe you've heard about the competitors of Eigen layer on Ethereum. We've seen recently the announcement of some raises and some big names joining the restaking race. And I think, in a way, it's interesting because it brings us back to the origin of restaking, in a way. Eigenaio was the first one to execute on restaking on Ethereum. But the idea of restaking and re hypothecating economic security dates back to concepts of the cosmos hub and the Polkadot parachains. Now, when it comes to Ethereum, we've seen, like I said, newcomers to this race, like symbiotic carac and nectar.
00:36:27.920 - 00:36:39.000, Speaker A: Have you had the time to look at the different trade off that these rest taking hubs were proposing? And how do you feel like this will impact the AV's space?
00:36:42.260 - 00:37:14.440, Speaker B: It's always good to see more competition. I think it's, you know, especially for like, a fast innovating space, like crypto. I think the more competition, the more competition the better. Right. So our developers spend a little time to look at symbiotic, and I think, like, their slashing mechanisms is interesting. I will definitely keep an eye on it. I think it's like, the design space is huge, like, in shared security space.
00:37:14.440 - 00:37:47.090, Speaker B: So, yeah, like, but then, like, I think Igor layer is still the leader in terms of the dogs and the smart contract. Like, everything. Like, everything that's like, kind of the infrastructure. I think it's definitely has, like, some lead time of the competition for symbiotic. I think they are still pretty early. Like, I think, like, for the code base is not too much to look at yet, but we will definitely keep an eye on it. Gotcha.
00:37:47.210 - 00:38:01.230, Speaker A: Well, Felix, this was a really interesting conversation. I had a great time. Thank you so much for coming on the podcast. Where can we send the audience to learn more about ARPA network and maybe give you a follow on Twitter?
00:38:01.730 - 00:38:24.480, Speaker B: Sure. Yes. So our Twitter handle is arpaofficial Arpa official, and my twitter handle is Felix. F e l I x m x u. That is my twitter handle. And also check out our website and check our dogs. Arpamnetwork IO great.
00:38:24.560 - 00:38:29.280, Speaker A: Well, Felix, thank you so much again and to the audience. I'll see you on the next one.
