00:00:00.330 - 00:00:23.630, Speaker A: You. Okay, so in this video I'm going to show you how to stake your Eth into the staking pool. So you open the kiln dap inside ledger live. But before we stake, let's just go ahead. Let's just go over and see what our current balance is. So at the moment we've got 32 Eth, just over 30, 32, 32.1 ETH staked in the pool.
00:00:23.630 - 00:01:18.470, Speaker A: So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to add another, let's just say 2.5. So I'll come back to the staking page. So I'm going to add 2.5. Let's go open my ledger device. Got to accept terms and conditions, hit stake. It's got to follow the on screen prompts and then review the transaction on my device and that's accepted. So we just need to wait for that transaction to successfully process and then obviously be broadcasted to the Ethereum network.
00:01:18.470 - 00:01:48.890, Speaker A: So we're just going to wait here just for a few seconds while that processes. So now if we go back to the withdrawal page, let's refresh that. So now you'll see that my balance has increased and that's as simple as that. So now we just wait for my stake position to do more rewards. Thanks for watching and happy staking.
