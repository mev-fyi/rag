00:00:00.250 - 00:00:40.274, Speaker A: So in the first stage allflare does one thing, it makes it easier for people to deploy these apps to sql up. So we offer this RAs service roll up as a service. And the goal is if, let's say you are a game builder and you do not understand how sequences work, you don't want to understand how data availability works, we can come to us and we will run and manage a roll up for you. So that's the first part. The second part is many of these roll up way they exist today, they're not very decentralized. So for example if you look at optimism or arbitrum or even CDK, all of them operate with a single sequencer. What we're doing right now with Eigen Layer is that we have proposed this idea of what we call restake rollups.
00:00:40.274 - 00:00:50.890, Speaker A: So essentially we take opstack, arbitrum orbit or any of the roll up stacks that are out there and we combine that with Eigen layer's restaking mechanism to build for example decentralized sequencing.
