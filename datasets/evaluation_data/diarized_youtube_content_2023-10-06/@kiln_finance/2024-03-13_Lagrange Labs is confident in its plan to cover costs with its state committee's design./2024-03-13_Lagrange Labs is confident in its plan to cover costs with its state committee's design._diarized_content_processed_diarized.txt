00:00:00.730 - 00:00:50.410, Speaker A: Whatever the price is for restaked ETH is going to be set by the market, the demand for restaked ETH versus the value that's generated from that. So I imagine early on the excitement is going to push up the cost of capital, but eventually that's going to converge to whatever the equilibrium dynamic is for the market where however much safety of restake ETH cost is, however much we're going to have to pay. And that's something that we're very comfortable with because the end of the day if you build a mechanism like this, you have to be confident that you can be able to support both the operational cost and then the cost of capital of your partners. And if you can't do that then the thing you're designing doesn't really have longevity and we've designed the state committees to be something that we're confident can derive sufficient yield to offset both those costs not just in the short term with inflationary mechanism but long term through real substantial Seville.
