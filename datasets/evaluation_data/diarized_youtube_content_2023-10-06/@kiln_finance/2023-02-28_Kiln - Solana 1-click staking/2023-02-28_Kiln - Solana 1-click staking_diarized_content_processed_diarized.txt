00:00:00.650 - 00:00:33.830, Speaker A: Hi. In this video I'm going to take you through staking Solana using the kiln dashboard. So on this page you can see the different protocols we support. I'm going to select Solana. Here you can see some stats about the network, the mechanics of staking Solana, and below some frequently asked questions. On the right you can see our staking widget where we can connect our wallet and proceed to staking. So let's do that.
00:00:33.830 - 00:01:03.682, Speaker A: As you can see, we support a number of different wallets. I'm going to use Phantom for this demo. So here I've connected my phantom wallet, which I had previously connected, so I didn't get the confirmation. But if you haven't done that, you will get the confirmation. I can see that I have 2.3 sol available on this testnet network. I can choose any amount above 0.1.
00:01:03.682 - 00:01:57.530, Speaker A: So here I'm going to choose say 0.5 and I can see how much I'm expected to earn in terms of rewards and I can just hit stake. Now this then proposes the staking delegation transaction on the Solana testnet. So once I review this, I can approve. And here we're just waiting for this transaction to go through on the network. Okay, it's now gone through and I can review it. So here is the block explorer where you can see that it's getting more and more confirmations, and soon it will be finalized and we'll be able to see that this is a staking delegation transaction.
00:01:57.530 - 00:02:15.330, Speaker A: So here we're initializing the stake account and then delegating the validation rights to the kiln Solana validator on this testnet. So that's it for Solana staking using the kiln dashboard.
