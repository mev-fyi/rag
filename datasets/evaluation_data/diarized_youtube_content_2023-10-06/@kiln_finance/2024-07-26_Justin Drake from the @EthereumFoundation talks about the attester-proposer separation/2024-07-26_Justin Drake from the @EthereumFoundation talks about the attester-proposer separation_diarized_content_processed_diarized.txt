So not only have we given the building to the wider market, but the proposing itself is given to the wider market. And so all the loose ends and the three of them, timing games, mev spikes and overloading of the proposal with things like commitments and preconfirmations, all that sophistication goes to the market, and it stays away from the validators, whose main role now is just attesting, which is super simple.
