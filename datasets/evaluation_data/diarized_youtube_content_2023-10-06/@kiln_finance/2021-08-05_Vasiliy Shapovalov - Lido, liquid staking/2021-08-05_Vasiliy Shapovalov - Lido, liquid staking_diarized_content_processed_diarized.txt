00:00:01.290 - 00:00:01.840, Speaker A: You.
00:00:03.970 - 00:00:39.270, Speaker B: And tomorrow I am going to give a longer talk about the challenges of actually getting there. So what we want to do, what are the changes we're facing, et cetera. So if you want more nitty gritty, I think so. That's for tomorrow. Today, mostly introductory, I think so, to understand where I'm coming from here. So I'm CTO of ptp.org. It's a pretty prominent staking provider.
00:00:39.270 - 00:01:28.646, Speaker B: I'm working there from February 2020. Basically the proto design of Lidar was the second thing I did on the drop because like it's pretty clear that 2020 was the year the Ethereum staking launch. And it will be the most important thing that will happen this year for proof of stake, not operators and maybe ever for everyone in 2020. Don't know. I know how stake works. We work a lot on that. We understand the market, the people who stake, the protocols, infrastructure, et cetera, et so.
00:01:28.646 - 00:02:32.042, Speaker B: And I am a co founder of Lida Protocol. We designed and launched it in December and we are remaining one of the team that maintains the code for it. So yeah, again, I kind of know what I'm talking about here. So what is Lido? Lido is a dao that builds a family of liquid staking protocol for everything. Basically was staking starting with Ethereum, that is our heartland and our headquarters on Ethereum. And that's what me and my team are working on. We've got about 650,000 of either as of today in stake, and that's a bit less than two billions depending on the price right now, $2 billion.
00:02:32.042 - 00:03:43.170, Speaker B: I mean, we've got nine node operators managing that stake and validating here. And it looks like we are continuing growing for now. And that node operators, we will increase in the set soon as well. So I'm going to tell you how Lidar works without any details, but like in an overview. And what's the current state? A bit about a grants program. And where are we getting at with Lido? Going to start from the basics like what is staking? That's a primitive in crypto economics that walks generally like that. Someone needs to lock up capital, then maybe perform some work, maybe expose themselves to some risks, like slash risks for validating proof of stake protocol and getting rewards.
00:03:43.170 - 00:04:49.726, Speaker B: The middle part is optional for cryptonomics design. The most important part is locking up capital. As we've seen in Defi summer, there is absolutely riskless staking as part of crypto dynamics, but it's mostly associated with performing some work and getting some rewards. So what's a liquid staking. Liquid staking removes the locking up capital part from it, basically dismantles the whole premise, right? So you stake and you get a liquid token that represents your position staking. So for example, on Ethereum, how it works for bitcoin chain, you send ether to Lido, you get staked ether. That is a token that represents your share of staked ether.
00:04:49.726 - 00:05:26.318, Speaker B: On beacon chain, that token, it's a rebasable token that changes balance every day. So far it's generally changing balance slightly upper because we're getting rewards and we don't get slashed yet. So that's how I think it will remain. But the protocol allows for slashing so the balance can be decreased if that happens on bitcoin chain. But so far it's up only. And that is a liquid token. It's transferable.
00:05:26.318 - 00:06:14.482, Speaker B: You can trade it. Right now we are incentivizing like a tonal liquidity on curve. The reason for that is that withdrawals are not enabled yet on beacon chain, and the only way to convert your staked ETH to regular ETH is to sell it on curve, basically. And we incentivize like two billions of liquidity there. You can trade it there to anything you want or lock up or indefice collateral. We've got a few protocols that allow that already, and working on integrating with maker, et cetera. And when withdrawals are enabled and lid is upgraded, you will be able to unstake either.
00:06:14.482 - 00:07:21.850, Speaker B: If you don't want to sell at the current price, you can just unstake it and get back your other. It's not possible right now, but it will be when the protocol, the beacon chain will stop changing under us and will have full features. It's got a pretty respectable APR of 5% on ether. Not much defy is giving it right now as no lending protocols, no farming. We are probably the best farm to get API at scale meta. And that is on token that you can put, for example in collateral right now you can put on ancient protocol in collateral, get some stablecoin and farm that stablecoin to 30% API more, for example. So that's a yield under your yield, basically a base layer of DeFi.
00:07:21.850 - 00:08:29.690, Speaker B: So what's good about liquid staking? It's DeFi compatible. It's not in the sense for a user. It's also regular staking with ether is at ODS with DeFi, because if DeFi opens up better opportunities for other than staking, it means that less ether will be staked because it's not a good, economical, rational decision to stake. And with staked ether, with liquid staking you can combine these things and they are not conflicting anymore. So liquid staking, unlike the regular delegated staking that we find in most protocols, has less drives for centralization at validation level. So liquid staking protocol tends to concentrate either in them and then distribute it between. And they don't have a natural force that drives them to stake with only one provider.
00:08:29.690 - 00:09:26.400, Speaker B: They can distribute it as evenly as possible. That's what Lidar does, basically. So liquid staking has a natural centralization drive that results in winner takes most dynamics in the liquid staking. Basically protocol that wins or doesn't win, but under that, on the validation level, it's actually the opposite. It has less centralized drives to stake with the best provider than most delegation solutions. So there is some value alignment with ethereum holders. So other holders stake with the staking provider that they find the best one.
00:09:26.400 - 00:10:15.200, Speaker B: It's less than self staking. For example, when you self staking, you are very value aligned with the staking because you own the stack and you validate and you are personally responsible for all that happens. Here we have some kind of principal engine problem. So there is staker who has the capital, he delegates it to Lido to be an agent of a user to stake it, and lido delegates it to node operators. So we have a string of agents that don't own the eth here. It's somewhat problematic from crypto network perspective. And liquid staking drives, the amount of ether stakes up.
00:10:15.200 - 00:11:02.670, Speaker B: That's a good force for ethereum. The thing to understand about liquid staking, it's not limited to lido and protocols. The simplest possible liquid staking solution that can exist, and exist for every stake token out there is staking. On exchanges, people send either or cosmos or atom or tezas or whatever to exchange, exchange, stake it and people can trade it. That's liquid staking. That's very easy to make, much easier than the protocol, and it's very convenient for the user. And that's like the current Ethereum stake distribution.
00:11:02.670 - 00:11:54.506, Speaker B: So lida has about 9.6% of the stake, but all the red parts is custodial solutions. That's how it looks. I think that if we remove lidar from picture, if Lidar didn't launch, it would look that either won't be here, wouldn't be there. Probably. It would be probably on exchanges or on other liquid staking solutions. So what lidar competes against, what it compares itself to, what choice it provides people is to stake with exchanges or staked with lido.
00:11:54.506 - 00:12:33.160, Speaker B: It's not a competitors to stake them by yourself. I'll talk more about this tomorrow in more details. Let's get to something more positive here. Lida's got a grants program called Ligo. The gist of it. It's designed to be extremely lightweighted and frictionless. It works like basically GitHub flow with pull requests and approvals.
00:12:33.160 - 00:13:38.236, Speaker B: Couple people can walk through a grant proposal in 2 hours with all the people who make a proposal. So we incentivize integrations, validator tooling content that is pertaining to lido or staking or Ethereum or beacon chain or something. And we have a special program for people who make lido for other blockchains and protocols. So that's lido's strategy for decentralization. We think that if there is only one team to do the development work, it won't be decentralized at any time. So when there is only one developer team, that's a natural point for centralization. But for most things, making the same basically product with multiple teams is not a good idea.
00:13:38.236 - 00:14:43.028, Speaker B: The exceptions here are like blockchain clients and some other things, but for staking protocols, that's just stupid. So the strategy here is to get teams to build Lido, like a separate team to build Lido for Polkadot, lido for Solana, for example, chorus one, a great validator team is building one here and they get terms on which they do that, like a big grant or revenue share or something like that. And they have a stable business with Lido and are one of the centers of power there. Does it? Ah, it's for the last slide. Yeah, I didn't save the last. So what's the future for us? We are working right now on more integrations. For Stackteeth, we are working on further decentralization.
00:14:43.028 - 00:15:39.790, Speaker B: Like just recently we swapped the withdrawal credentials of lidar to execution layer smart contract instead of threshold signature. We, we are onboarding new node operators soon for Ethereum and in the not so far future the most important topics for us will be implementing withdrawals when bitcoin chain has a stable spec for that and Mev, like everyone's doing MeV, we decided we want to do that too. Yeah. After the match, the MeV will be extracted by staking pools. And that's something that Lida will probably deep toss in. So that's the plan. Thank you.
00:15:54.160 - 00:16:17.640, Speaker A: Three or four questions. So you were talking about Mev. How do you think? Can you describe a little bit how the end user will benefit from Mav. How will you distribute the rewards for the end user, for the DAO, treasury and the providers?
00:16:18.860 - 00:16:59.750, Speaker B: Okay, I'm going to do a curveball here and describe it from the first principles. So MeV in proof of stake world will be very different than proof of work. The reason for that is that proof of stake is basically ethereum holders deciding how to validate, how to compose blocks. It's no longer a separate entity like minus. That may or may not hold eth, but that's not their profession to hold it. Their profession is to basically have some hash power. When proof of stake happens, that's much difference.
00:16:59.750 - 00:18:08.556, Speaker B: That means that immuv extraction will be much more aligned with Ethereum, with other price basically, than in mining context, because that's basically, you are mining with other, you don't want it to go down. And that means, for example, what it means for staking pools. That means that if you extract some mev and don't distribute it back to stakers, stakers are going to unstake and go to the different staking pool that does exactly that. If you don't extract mev, that happens again. So they unstake and go to another staking pool that provide them some revenue share. If you extract MV in a way that's harmful for network people unstake, you stop doing that. So that means, well, not to be strict, not harmful to the network, but harmful to other price.
00:18:08.556 - 00:19:18.832, Speaker B: These things are very close, but a big difference. So that means that decision space here is really tight. What's going to happen with mev and staking pools? Pools will be collecting mev in a way that is not harmful to the network and distributed to the stakers. Mostly, I think that it's going to be organized, it's going to be outsourced, because basically the collection will be outsourced because it's two different skill sets to run, not operator, and to basically collect mev. So it works much like with flashbots right now, probably with flashbots. And I think that there will be some revenue share with the software and arbitrage providers, like flashbots or something. But the gist of it is, it's going to happen.
00:19:18.832 - 00:19:24.640, Speaker B: It's going to be submitted to stakers, and it won't be too harmful because otherwise the stakers just unstake.
00:19:26.360 - 00:20:32.520, Speaker A: Okay, thanks. Yeah, I think hot Topic and Thomas will follow. Another question is on the note, provider part, how do you see frictionless node provider onboarding and what will be, in a sense, kind of decentralized acceptance of one provider in spite of another. Will it be on chain data like uptime? What data will you monitor to onboard new providers? And the other questions is linked. How many providers do you see staking on Lido or validating on Lido in two years? Is it 5150? And last question, linked as well. Like do you see user validator? So single validator runner using lido tomorrow?
00:20:37.260 - 00:20:39.130, Speaker B: I'll try to remember all three.
00:20:39.900 - 00:20:41.016, Speaker A: I can remind you.
00:20:41.038 - 00:21:24.920, Speaker B: No worries. Yeah, you'll remind me if I forget something. So for validator onboarding right now, the validator onboarding process, not operator onboarding process in lido is very basic. There is a dao voting that says we've got like nine slots for node operators and these nine slots will be filled by X-Y-Z et cetera. So basically white listing by Dow, that's a necessity. It's done like that because right now when you stake eth, it's basically hostage. With a validator there is no withdrawals.
00:21:24.920 - 00:22:21.070, Speaker B: If there were withdrawals, the validators need to initiate them. So until they send the exit message, you can't withdraw. So that either is hostage with a not operator. And that situation that when we started it was clear that it's going to be for a year or year and a half or maybe two years. That's how it played out right now. So we needed the set of not operators that are dependable and reputable and great at what they do and they don't like if they are suddenly beer market, they don't just exit and they don't say I'm out, going to be like a regular give ops or something. So we had to do a really good whitelist here.
00:22:21.070 - 00:23:46.728, Speaker B: When the situation is less dire in the regard when there is staking pool in shade withdrawals and withdrawals walk and we can restake, it's going to be much better that I got the decision space will be wider. So there is no design currently that we, like me personally or other people think that is best. And there isn't really even a discussion here. We are just sketching different models that can work here. But it's probably going to be some kind of permissionless, gradual step by step onboarding process where when you start, you are allowed to run like one key in SSv setting. When you first start staking lidar, a single regular staking or something. And to get better you need to have good performance that is demonstrabable on chain and probably some kind of risk insurance or something like people staking with you, some tokens that can be splashed if you are slashed or something like that.
00:23:46.728 - 00:24:39.370, Speaker B: And some degree of decision making by Ethereum stakers, by other stakers. So if people stake with Lidar and say that not operator is great, we want Lidar stake with them, that should be also taken into account. So that's a multifactor system that is combined some value function that says that validated that not operator gets more either and that one gets less because that one is trusted and great performance and has some insurance or cover back it in. And that one, we don't know anything about them. So they can run one key in SSV and that's it. So that's how I see it. But like I said, it's not even design, it's a sketch at most.
00:24:40.220 - 00:24:53.180, Speaker A: Okay, very last but not least, about the peg eth, what do you think could be the bigger risk of losing the peg?
00:24:56.160 - 00:26:07.924, Speaker B: So I was way more pessimistic about how it will hold up. Honestly, I think that by the time, well, when launched, I thought that PEC would be much less stable for staketees and it would deviate very much from eth, especially when the market downturned with sharp drops when people are exiting into stable coins. So I can honestly say I don't have a good read on this. My writ on this is way more pessimistic than reality. So I think that risk, I thought would be realistic for staketeeth pack. They have been realized already when we dropped from either from 4000 to 2000 and things like that, but that only disbalanced it for less than 1%, I think half percent or something. So what's left is like obvious slashing smart contract risk like exploit or something like that.
00:26:07.924 - 00:26:15.770, Speaker B: And I think, yeah, that can break the back, but I don't see market breaking it for the time being. For now.
00:26:18.460 - 00:26:43.490, Speaker C: I have a question by a show, how many people are using Lido as of now? Okay, so we've got about maybe 10% of the room. Do you have suggestion on what you would like to see on Lido for the coming months, quarters, decades.
00:26:46.070 - 00:26:47.010, Speaker B: Tezos.
00:26:49.350 - 00:26:51.970, Speaker C: More, more and protocol on liquid staking.
00:26:52.130 - 00:27:04.060, Speaker B: So if someone wants to build liquid staking of tezos with lido legos here to fund it, basically do that. I'd love to see it flourish here.
00:27:07.560 - 00:27:16.100, Speaker A: Okay, guys, do you have any other questions? I mean, I have a lot. I think I will ask it afterwards.
00:27:18.040 - 00:27:18.404, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:27:18.442 - 00:27:25.610, Speaker A: So without further to do because we also happy to. Thank you very much, Vasli. Thank you.
