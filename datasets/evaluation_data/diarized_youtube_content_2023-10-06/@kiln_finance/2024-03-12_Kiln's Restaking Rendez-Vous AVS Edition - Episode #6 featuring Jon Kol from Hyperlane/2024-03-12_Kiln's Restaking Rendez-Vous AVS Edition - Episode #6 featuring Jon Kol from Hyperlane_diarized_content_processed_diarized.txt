00:00:07.610 - 00:00:36.760, Speaker A: Hey there, and welcome to the latest episode of Kiln Restaking. Reneevu I'm Edgar, protocol specialist at Kiln, the leading enterprise grade staking platform. And today I'm not alone. I'm joined by Ben, my co host, who is also my counterpart at Coinbase Cloud because he's senior protocol specialist there. And joining us today is John Cole, the CEO and co founder at Hyperlain. Talk about the wonderful hyperlin Aps. John, how are you doing today?
00:00:37.930 - 00:01:24.870, Speaker B: I'm doing great. Thanks for having, you know, pleasure to be here and tell you really everything there is to know about hyperlane more broadly. And then kind of our plans for this abs and the different phases that we want to transition for it, because I think there is phase one that's cool, but not so cool, not as cool as we can get to. And there's a phase two, or let's call it a more endgame phase that I think is really impactful and really interesting, but will certainly depend on the risk appetite of the good folks who are restaking.
00:01:26.090 - 00:01:30.822, Speaker A: Super interesting. Ben, how are you doing? Can you maybe introduce yourself for the audience?
00:01:30.966 - 00:01:52.266, Speaker C: Yes, absolutely. How's it going, y'all? What do you call that name is Ben Rodriguez. As Edgar said, senior protocol specialist here at. You know, I interact with many different protocols, hyperlain included, you know, and, you know, we're just trying know, assess from a perspective of what we want to look at in terms of what protocols.
00:01:52.298 - 00:01:53.626, Speaker B: To support and all that fun stuff.
00:01:53.668 - 00:02:01.250, Speaker C: From the Coinbase side. I've been in crypto for ten years now. I'm an old guy when it comes to crypto.
00:02:01.910 - 00:02:02.946, Speaker B: Very old guy.
00:02:02.968 - 00:02:04.050, Speaker C: I'm a boomer.
00:02:06.310 - 00:02:17.640, Speaker B: You're doing both. I feel old for basically being around for. I've been working crypto for six years. I've been around for like eight. Yeah, but yeah, ten you are. Yeah.
00:02:18.410 - 00:02:59.190, Speaker C: Bought my first bitcoin 2024 now. Yeah, a little bit. There were some people before me, of course, but yeah, I've been at Coinbase for about two years now, and I cover the ethereum ecosystem, kind of like, if you think about it, the modular ecosystems. So I cover all of that. And that does include Eigen layer as like a validator, middleware type thing. And then obviously hyperlink being in an abs on top of, or about to be an abs on top of eigen layer, and also interoperability solutions, which hyperlain is going to be talking to us about today. So pleasure to see y'all.
00:02:59.930 - 00:03:12.890, Speaker A: Cool. Perfect. And we'll start this off then. John, I would love to have your background story, like, how did you start working blockchain? And what led you to build hybrid?
00:03:13.230 - 00:03:43.826, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. So I guess it's a funny story, at least for me, it's a funny story. I was at bonch, I guess, at the time I was selling bonds and then later on moved to trade bonds. Very fascinating, really interesting stuff. Most boring existence you can think of. And I'm at a friend's birthday party. This is like spring or summer of 2016, and I have this friend for us.
00:03:43.826 - 00:04:16.810, Speaker B: I went to school at Berkeley. This is a school friend, and he'd done really well. Even the time where we were students at university, and he had like a bunch of cash just sitting idle. He just comes up, he's like, hey, John, all my friends are putting all their money into Ethereum. Should I do it too? I think I should do it. What do you think? Is it a good idea? And he's coming to me because he's like, oh, well, you work in finance, so you should know something about money. I'm like, I don't know, dude.
00:04:16.810 - 00:04:33.138, Speaker B: I don't know. It's a good idea. I don't know. Bad idea. I just don't know. I've heard of people at Berkeley and we're talking about it like some friends, but I hadn't spent any meaningful time on it. And he's, you know, this is like a serious thing for me.
00:04:33.138 - 00:05:07.866, Speaker B: And I'm like, I know, dude, I know you're going to use that money for a. So, like, now you're talking, know, buying this random thing I've never heard of. And so we spend the rest of the next two days, basically, we just kind of hanging out, and we spend a bunch of time looking into Ethereum. And I go to work on that Monday morning, just super pilled. I'm like, you guys have no idea what's coming. You can't even imagine what's coming. What's funny is on our trading desk, we were working on the municipal bond trading desk.
00:05:07.866 - 00:05:51.094, Speaker B: And this is, as of at least that period in history, that was still the most opaque part and most illiquid part of the US bond market. And so it seemed like, oh, this will be the one where automation and tech innovation is going to take the longest. And what people were really concerned with were things like auto bidders, which is basically just like some type of algo that looks at the different bonds that are coming up and they're bidding them. And so that should obfuscate our expertise here as the trading desk. You're worried about the auto bidder. You don't know what's coming. There's going to be decentralized bond desks on Ethereum.
00:05:51.094 - 00:06:14.770, Speaker B: This thing is coming. I don't know when, but it's coming. And I gradually become more and more of a crypto nut. And I get viewed as that on this trading desk, and I'm fine with it. I've been like a weirdo. I've been kind of like on the outskirts of normal accepted beliefs my entire life. Even before crypto, I was kind of like the odball on the trading desk.
00:06:14.770 - 00:06:47.966, Speaker B: It fit people's mental models of what I was. And I spend the next year and a half is getting more and more into it. Like, February rolls around, you get your banker bonuses, those are great. I'm like, I got to get deeper into crypto. What should I do? Instead of like a reasonable, smart degenerate would say, I'm just going to take all of this and I'm going to dump it into Ethereum. I'm, at the time, I'm a bond guy and I had some family complications paying for the parents mortgage and whatnot. So I was very concerned about losing all of it.
00:06:47.966 - 00:07:11.042, Speaker B: So I was like, I'll do a safe thing, I'll find a crypto bond. And so mining is like a crypto bond. You got your money spent on gear that's like the principal, and then you get your mining rewards. Those are like the coupons, the cash flow. Huge mistake. But I don't know that at the time. And so live in Oakland.
00:07:11.042 - 00:07:53.326, Speaker B: I drive to the nearest best buy, start picking up GPUs, I go down to my parents in LA, I go to the fries electron. I somehow managed to raid up like 36 different Nvidia GPUs, set up like six X, six racks, and we're off to the races. So I'm now mining zcash and I'm mining Ethereum. And I spent the next year getting more into crypto as a miner. And eventually, like, end of the year, got my first job. I joined a macro hedge fund called Passport Capital that was opening up its crypto team and was an investor there and did a few things. I guess the most notable thing there, like my first DA, was the first funding round for Solana.
00:07:53.326 - 00:08:32.670, Speaker B: That was a fun one. And then from there went to Galaxy Nova's firm and worked with him there and co led the investment team at Galaxy for a few. You know, throughout all this time, I'm like super into crypto because of this concept of it's an Internet computer that anyone can use to do whatever the hell they want. But the idea that the computer you're using and the one that I'm using, they can't talk to each other. It seemed like, for a dummy like me, seemed very strange. And I got, well, this is going to be solved, like, in a year. And every year, it kept feeling like it's still a year away.
00:08:32.670 - 00:09:39.462, Speaker B: 2021 rolls around, and you're like, well, really, as far as we've gotten with this, is that we have some designs that let us move tokens around, but no one tried to do something deeper than that. So one thing leads to another. As an investor, I found myself to be on the far right edge of the distribution when it came to people who care about this and who were interested in it and who were studious about this topic. And so somehow, a few people end up in a room, and they start talking, and then before you know it, it's like, oh, shit. We are now working on this thing that is going to later on be known as Hyperlane. And so we started working on it, like, in earnest, late 21, and started the company, everything by the early part of 2022. And now, two years into it, I run what's called Abacus works.
00:09:39.462 - 00:09:59.500, Speaker B: That's, like, the development company that's the major contributor to the hyperlink protocol. We've also got at least six or seven other companies that are making, really, material contributions, which is awesome. And, yeah, could tell you all about it. Sorry, that was convoluted, but I'm having fun today.
00:09:59.870 - 00:10:05.450, Speaker A: Does that mean that in 2021, you were still running ETH minus?
00:10:05.890 - 00:10:25.990, Speaker B: No, actually, sorry, I didn't get that part. By April of 2018, I was like, fuck this. This sucks writing. I can't tell you how much I hate mining. I hate it. I think it's the worst thing ever. I think no one should do it unless they are willing to just make that their primary endeavor.
00:10:25.990 - 00:11:27.618, Speaker B: I think it is a complete waste of time. The only thing that was good about it is that it was so unpleasant to operate that I learned a lot about how chains work. And so the way I rationalize it, because I have to, because clearly the financial difference between taking that money and buying GPUs and mining with it versus just buying Ethereum, straight up, was massive. I'm like, well, you know what? If I just done that, I'd be one of those people. Because in San Francisco in 2018, there were lots of, call them kids like me who thought they knew something about investing and thought they were like, wizards, because they just bought some ETH, and it had gone way up. But in reality, they're just like, just dudes. So the way I rationalized, like, oh, if I'd done that, I'd just be one of those dudes, and I wouldn't be able to make them have the impact they've had in the industry or get as smart as I did.
00:11:27.618 - 00:11:32.730, Speaker B: I just think I was a wizard. And so that's my rationalization. I hate mining, and I've stopped mining.
00:11:35.070 - 00:11:37.850, Speaker A: You missed out on some nice MeV blocks.
00:11:38.430 - 00:11:48.846, Speaker B: I did, yeah. There was not a lot of MeV in 2017 and 18. Probably the most was, like, in December when cryptokitties first came around.
00:11:49.028 - 00:11:53.760, Speaker A: Yeah, in 2021. It was crazy.
00:11:55.010 - 00:11:56.430, Speaker B: It was banana.
00:11:57.750 - 00:12:04.098, Speaker A: You started to build Hyperlade. Was it like an interoperability protocol from the get go?
00:12:04.264 - 00:13:04.550, Speaker B: Yes. I guess there was one big change that happened with hyperlade, but it was always about interoperability. At first, it was about, how do we make it super easy for developers to connect any application across any chain? And we really focused on this notion of what I used to like calling shared state applications apps, that, why are you. Because people were deploying their app and still do on multiple chain, but they're basically like little islands. It's like, how can we create the pathways between them so that ave on Ethereum knows what's going on with Ave on Polygon? And then I think what we realized was, well, people actually, they like talking about it. They're not so interested in building it. And the need there, the tangible thing that someone gains from that is not very clear.
00:13:04.550 - 00:14:13.840, Speaker B: So in the common VCs like to talk about, oh, what is a painkiller? And what is like a vitamin? In 2022, the notion of connecting your app between multiple chains was certainly not a painkiller for anybody. Everyone was able to conduct business on those deployments on single chain, and there would be a real nice to have, but not necessarily something that changes their reality by doing that. Add to that that it's actually, like, substantially different paradigm to develop in on a single chain. Everything is atomic and everything is synchronous. And you have just, I would say, more than half of people who are building in crypto have never built anywhere else. And so the fact that the entire Internet basically is built asynchronously does not apply, because you have people who have their formative years as engineers happened in a crypto context where they're building on a single chain, and again, everything is synchronous, everything is atomic, and you go to an interchange environment. And now those two things break.
00:14:13.840 - 00:15:17.842, Speaker B: Anyone who tells you something about cross chain activity being atomic is basically just omitting the part where now you basically are creating another blockchain that just takes orders from other blockchains, but there's no escaping around that. And similarly, the issue of synchronicity comes in. So it's not insurmountable, but just there was a mismatch between that expectation on our part that like, wait a second, the entire Internet is asynchronous. People will figure this out. And the actual available expertise in the majority of crypto teams, which was like, we don't know how to build things asynchronously. Or even if we do know how to do it, we don't know how to do it for these types of crypto apps because all the existing ones where we would draw our inspiration from, they require that. And so sometime over the summer, I hugged my brother, I got him a gig working with Latice, like the folks who made the Dark forest game.
00:15:17.842 - 00:16:07.074, Speaker B: And these folks were like super into ZK. And at one point they started talking about how, yeah, you know, this zk thing is just not going to work for us. It's not there in the capacity that we need to. So we're giving up on it because optimism had built this thing at the time. It's called bedrock that lets anyone easily create a chain or a roll up that looks a lot like optimism. And then I was like, my word, these people have basically, like, for years have been evangelizing ZK, and they are now telling me that that's not going to work for them and this is what they're going with. I'm completely changing my worldview because I always thought there's going to be a lot of change, but this added zeros to that.
00:16:07.074 - 00:16:55.946, Speaker B: And I go back to my team and I'm like, from what our architecture is, we should be able to go to them. I'm like, I'm not sure about this, but I think we're the only interoperability protocol that's architected in such a way where actually anyone could put it anywhere. And they go, yeah, sure, great, okay, so that's what we're going to do. This is like, we're going to make a massive bet that this thing that basically a lot of people who were going to build some app are then going to have to reach their potential. We're going to have to create their own chain of roll up. And we will be the thing that solves that problem for them of how they connect with everybody else. It was clear that people were moving to making this increasingly easier and easier and easier.
00:16:55.946 - 00:17:28.410, Speaker B: But what good is it to have a chain that can. You could spin up a chain in five minutes, but then, well, it's an island. They can't talk to anybody. So what is going to be the corresponding linkage between these chains being spun up in five minutes that could be as easily spun up? And so that was that one change that we had going from, hey, wait, let's focus on apps to actually, no, let's focus on chains, but not all chain. This specific variant of chain.
00:17:30.130 - 00:17:30.858, Speaker A: Sweet.
00:17:30.954 - 00:17:32.670, Speaker B: So that's really cool.
00:17:32.740 - 00:17:36.510, Speaker C: I think this space evolves very quickly.
00:17:36.580 - 00:17:36.814, Speaker B: Right?
00:17:36.852 - 00:18:11.354, Speaker C: So a thesis that might have happened, like, two years ago is probably going to evolve into a new thesis like today, right? I think there's going to be kind of like a couple of interrelated questions here, more than happy to remind you and all that fun stuff. So the thing is, your protocol has been live for about two years now. I've been talking to you all since abacus, right? You were like, abacus protocol before and whatnot, right? I've known you all for a while. So you've been live for a couple of years now, right? Can you share.
00:18:11.472 - 00:18:12.330, Speaker B: Yeah, almost.
00:18:12.480 - 00:18:12.938, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:18:13.024 - 00:18:13.466, Speaker B: Right?
00:18:13.568 - 00:18:36.334, Speaker C: Can you share some of those learnings after being live for like, two? Expand a little bit on what you were talking about, and then why you decided to choose to move to Eigen layer. What has changed about your thesis around interoperability and your vision around interoperability around these course?
00:18:36.452 - 00:19:38.840, Speaker B: So, you know, I'd say on learning, especially if you are in a similar position, I think it's imperative to just have something out there. So, for us, around the summer of 22, around that time, we had a choice of, well, we could take longer and ship this thing with more feature. Like, one of the things we wanted to add was economic security, or we could just launch it in a very narrow proto form and just see what happens. See, learn from people trying to use it, have it go around hackathons, talk to different apps. And that was very useful. I think people are always afraid of doing that because once you do that, it's out there and people can observe it, and so it's no longer like a secret. And people like that period where your thing is still a secret, it's very reassuring because you don't know if it sucks yet.
00:19:38.840 - 00:20:15.798, Speaker B: No one's telling you that it sucks. No one's also telling you that it's great or not. But there's a real sense of security there from how people perceive themselves. It's not the right move for everybody, but certainly sometimes it is the right move. So I'd encourage people to do that. Adding economic security to our protocol was something we always, always, always wanted to do. So not so much a change in thesis, but more of a change in approach.
00:20:15.798 - 00:20:53.918, Speaker B: So how do we even end up talking to Sriram? We were talking, I forget who it was actually at this point, because it's so long ago, talking to someone, some friend, I was like, hey, yeah. We really see economic security playing a big role in how hyperlain chains connect to each other. He goes, oh, did you read this paper? And I'm like, you think I've got time to read these papers? Of course I don't, but I've heard about this guy. Okay, cool. I'll put you. You stuck the ceramics. And we started talking, and he said, hey, perfect.
00:20:53.918 - 00:21:14.500, Speaker B: We're working on just this thing. It should be live pretty soon. And I'm like, great. You're telling me, like, you're going to be live great. So we're not going to have to go and spend our time to build this big thing. We just have to spend our time building a little thing that fits on your bigger thing. That sounds great.
00:21:14.500 - 00:21:49.280, Speaker B: And so that's like now when our work with Eigen layer to get this abs is. So we didn't spend too much time talking about hyperlane, but with hyperlain, instead of having, like, enshrined security, you have just anything that could be a state attestation or a state proof can be used to secure messages that go through hyperlay. And so we want the Avs to be exactly one of these modules and to provide economic security wherever it's available.
00:21:52.930 - 00:22:24.330, Speaker A: Great. And if you had to explain hyperlain to, let's not say a five year old, let's say like a ten or 15 year old, and try to maybe work your way up to maybe a crypto expert. My understanding, and I'm not a crypto expert yet, but would be that it would be comparable to an IBC for chains that are not necessarily tendermint.
00:22:25.230 - 00:23:03.794, Speaker B: Yes. So it's very much like IBC inspired. I know some people get upset when I say that. I think of it as, like, a spiritual successor to IBC. Some of the people who built IBC helped us build hyperlane. And I think if you get those people in the room, a lot of times tell you like, oh, yeah, there's a whole lot we would have done different. So from a starting point of like, hey, IBC, what we thought in 2021 and 2022 was like the best way to do it, but the constraints that IBC had, we felt were too limiting.
00:23:03.794 - 00:24:08.054, Speaker B: And so how do we make different trade offs to arrive at something that is maximally extensible? Because that original goal that we drifted from slightly was to let any developer easily connect their app between any chain. And so the any chain part was really important. So you didn't want to just say, well, like, oh, only chains that look like, no, any chain take that seriously. And so how do you do that with IBC? Yes, it's true that IBC can actually support, it doesn't have to only be like light client verification, but that does require a rewriting of the IBC client. That's a ton of effort. Whereas with hybrid, we've created something which is just, hey, this system can pass any arbitrary byte between blockchains. It does it primarily in smart contracts.
00:24:08.054 - 00:24:48.406, Speaker B: Like as a developer, you're just interfacing with a contract. There is some off chain info, like notably the relayer, which is like an untrusted know. It basically is like a delivery guy. It just takes something from, say, ethereum and then initiates a transaction on Solana. And so wanted to again focus on maximal extensibility and allow for new security models to come and be developed pretty much by anyone. And so have the security be something that's expressed at the edge instead of so deep in the stack. Right.
00:24:48.406 - 00:25:36.386, Speaker B: It can't be that you need to reinvent hyperlane to be able to support a new security mode. You just need to be able to say, hey, here's a way of securing information. Here's a cool way to do state attestations or do state proofs. And I want to wrap those with some hyperlane, let's call them like idioms, and make it fit here. So, like right now, there is someone who's about to finish their work integrating the succinct prover as a hyperlink security module. What does that mean? It means that wherever someone is running that, like, it can be used to secure messages going out of hyperlink. And so in that sense, that's like a core difference from IBC.
00:25:36.386 - 00:26:13.938, Speaker B: But if you did a schematic of how the two things work, there's a lot of similarities, because again, we think IBC is a really first, completely game changing. Right? Like there's a reason you want to be its spiritual successor, because it did a ton, right? And then it's not to say that it did certain things wrong. It's just like, we don't like how it did those certain things. We wanted to do them different. And so that's why a lot of times people ask us, why not just work on IBC more? Like, you can go ahead and do that. It's a free country. They're not stopping you from doing that.
00:26:13.938 - 00:26:54.154, Speaker B: We just wanted to do this thing different, and I don't think we could consider it to be. It can run side by side with IBC, like as we do right now with a bunch of cosmos chains where they use hyperlink to communicate with EVM chains, solana, and different roll ups. But a lot of times, the assets that they're broadcasting are actually like IBCD noms. Like, isn't the case with some of our more popular Tia, the Celestia token? Like those routes. So these are the two things kind of working in concert. And sorry, this whole time actually didn't go into explaining hyperlink. So I could do that too, if you want.
00:26:54.292 - 00:27:06.146, Speaker A: Yeah, maybe start for the ten year olds out there that really want to understand how hyperlink works very harder. Pronounce service.
00:27:06.248 - 00:27:25.594, Speaker B: No, you're good. So, for the ten year olds, there are three components for hyperlink. There is a mailbox. This is just like a contract. Think of it like it's a program that runs on chain. It functions as the on chain API that a developer interacts with to send and receive information between chains. And that information could be anything.
00:27:25.594 - 00:27:51.886, Speaker B: It could be assets. It could be like function call. It could be like a text message. Not that you should do that. It could be. The second component is the security module. In practice, right now, a lot of the security modules are just like validator committees, varying sizes, but they can also take the form, as I mentioned, of different types of state proofs, like zk proofs.
00:27:51.886 - 00:28:37.982, Speaker B: They could also be like an optimistic module. And so we have a bunch that are coming online, and this is, again, if you're in the audience and even if you're a ten year old developer, but you're, like, interested, check out our bounty board. There's a bunch of work that you can take on to wrap different forms of state attestations or state proofs, or even like, other interoperability protocols, and wrap them as hyperlane modules. And this is the thing that basically will secure the communication. Like when you send that message from Ethereum to Solana, the module is like something that's observing the mailbox on Ethereum and saying, okay, this looks like this transaction was finalized, included a block and then finalized. Everything looks kosher.
00:28:38.126 - 00:28:38.626, Speaker A: Cool.
00:28:38.728 - 00:29:07.814, Speaker B: Sign off. And then finally, the third component is the relayer. Like we said, it's kind of like just a delivery guy. It's really not a trusted agent. Anyone can run one. In practice, it tends to be that either us abacus works or like, the different chain teams are running the relayer, and the relayer looks at the different mailboxes, it says, oh, okay, Ben, I see you're sending a message. And I see, oh, you also included a fee.
00:29:07.814 - 00:29:49.638, Speaker B: You're a great guy. I'm going to process this for you. So I take your message, I then look to see, okay, the security module has signed off on it appropriately. Looks great. I retrieve their signatures, and I take the signatures from that security module, and I basically initiate the processing of your message at the mailbox of the destination chain. It gets fed in those signatures, and as long as everything looks valid, the message will arrive at its destination. If they weren't valid, it just stops right there.
00:29:49.638 - 00:30:08.778, Speaker B: So it'll get included in a block on the destination chain, but it's never going to reach, like if you were sending Ben, if you were sending something to Edgar on Solana, it's never going to reach Edgar's address. That's like the very basic of how it. Thanks. Let's go. We could go a little bit deeper.
00:30:08.794 - 00:30:15.994, Speaker C: Into that, but I do want to talk a little bit, because you mentioned earlier about phase one and phase two. All right.
00:30:16.132 - 00:30:16.820, Speaker B: Yes.
00:30:17.350 - 00:30:18.098, Speaker A: Right.
00:30:18.264 - 00:30:22.798, Speaker C: Let's talk about that a little bit. And also let's talk about in the context of timelines.
00:30:22.894 - 00:30:23.154, Speaker B: Right.
00:30:23.192 - 00:30:43.418, Speaker C: In timelines, for example, Eigen layer is supposed to launch later on this year. In terms of hyperlane readiness to be an abs on top of eigen layer, what does that look like in terms of timeline? And how does that fit into your phase one and phase two? And then let's start out with what is phase one and what is phase two?
00:30:43.584 - 00:31:26.040, Speaker B: Excellent. Let's do that. So I should clarify, both these phases really only pertain to the hyperlane AVs specifically, and not like they're not broader hyperlane things. Let's start with timelines. Right now, based on what we know of the Eigen layer timelines, hyperlane should be there with its AVs in what I'll soon describe as phase one. Right around lodge, hopefully exactly at lodge. But timelines and software are sensitive things, so I think everyone has appreciation for that.
00:31:26.040 - 00:32:00.722, Speaker B: And later on, emerging into phase two. Now, phase two actually depends more on willingness of restakers than it does on any new software that needs to be built on Hyperlink. So actually, let me get into what these different phases mean. So you're a know you have your money in something like swell or kelp or Renzo or Rio. I don't want to forget anybody we talked to a lot. We love all of you. You guys are all amazing.
00:32:00.722 - 00:32:29.798, Speaker B: I'm running on like 4 hours of sleep, so excuse me if I've forgotten anyone. Please take no offense, but you have your money there. Why do you have it there? You have it there because you're like, well, my ethereum is just sitting. I want to earn more on it. And so you want to earn more, but you also want to not take a lot of risk. You want to minimize the amount of risk that you're taking. And for the most part, that'll pertain to keeping everything in house on Ethereum.
00:32:29.798 - 00:33:03.382, Speaker B: And so phase one is the AVs secures outbound messages from Ethereum. Because one thing I don't know if I clarified enough just a minute ago when I was talking about security. Security in hyperlane is unidirectional. It's always in the outbound direction. So there's a module, it runs, say, on ethereum. It then secures what goes out of Ethereum. And then on any other chain, you just basically subscribe or enroll to that module, and now you can receive that message.
00:33:03.382 - 00:33:55.350, Speaker B: So think of it as kind of like a broadcast. And anywhere where a hyperlain mailbox exists, that's like a receiver able to receive those broadcasts. And so phase one will just say like low risk to only say, there is not anything. The only thing putting your money at risk as someone who is working with Ravs, is like the slashing conditions we have on Ethereum. You can always observe them. So you have like high certainty that it's not happening by accident or it's not happening when it shouldn't be happening. Now, admittedly, that's actually not that interesting, right? I don't know what net new applications are made available because we will be providing economic security on Ethereum.
00:33:55.350 - 00:34:47.494, Speaker B: And I feel good about saying that right now. It does not seem to us that even major, major applications, like there's at least one that's already live, that's a major defi player that's already using hyperlink to send stuff from Ethereum, and they're doing it without economic security being present. So it does not seem that it is blocking or enabling anything like net new. So phase one is cool, but it's not game changing. Phase two, that can be game changer. Phase two is when different restakers are going to get more comfortable with securing the outbound from roll ups. So think of pretty much every optimistic roll up that you use.
00:34:47.494 - 00:36:06.900, Speaker B: Why does it have that seven day challenge period? Is because we want to have some type of certainty around the security there. And so what is it going to take to lower that time? Well, economic security on the amounts that are being withdrawn, I think most people would agree that's probably effective enough deterrent against any malfeasance. And so that is now you're getting into something that is like, I do think, enables net new things. I do think there are teams who are right now reluctant because of the absence of economic security to participate in things like that. And so the barrier is not going to be convincing rolos. They'll be signing up for this left and right. It's how do you convince the restaker that this is risk worth taking? Because an interesting thing happens now is how do they know when they should be getting slashed? Because unlike the case where it's on Ethereum, they can observe Ethereum very easily here.
00:36:06.900 - 00:36:46.640, Speaker B: What if they don't trust that roll up sequencer? Does that become a question? And so that's why I think it'll take more time. And I think that what will be the determining factor in how long it takes before we can go from one to two is just going to be like a market willingness. I think it's going to be one of those things that happen slowly, then suddenly. Because once someone does it and says, oh, it's like been like a month or two and nothing bad happened, I think a bunch of others will be like, well, why are we hurting? Get in there.
00:36:50.560 - 00:37:09.730, Speaker A: Okay, great. So it'd be like Ethereum at launch, and pretty much there will be clear incentives to get more protocols supported by the operators after that. And does that constitute phase two?
00:37:10.260 - 00:37:58.690, Speaker B: Yeah, basically, how do we transition this to now you're accepting risk that comes not from transactions originating on ethereum, but transactions originating on this wide variety of chains. I say, to my pleasant surprise, there is more willingness than I'd expected. Even at this early stage, no one is committing to anything which I not even expected. But when we kind of describe this to the different restakers we speak to, you see the glint in the eye, like, okay, I like that. All right, great. Pretty excited about it.
00:37:59.640 - 00:38:03.220, Speaker A: So maybe it would be from economic incentives.
00:38:05.240 - 00:39:18.812, Speaker B: It's always the most important thing, right? And that's actually what I think that's still the biggest open question with all of this is right now we get a lot of people saying like, oh yeah, yeah, I'm very interested in having economic security. It's great, budy, but what do you want to pay? Know, it's like, well, I'm interested in having a very nice house in Soho, but what am I willing to pay for? Not what it costs, that's why. That and actually not having the money are two reasons why I don't have one. But being interested is one thing. It's like, are you going to pay for it? Because I think you mentioned earlier, MeV and I like that part of the market because the one that is most clearly just like an open market, where incentives and costs and economic realities determine so much of it. I think the Eigen layer restaking market is going to be another place where it doesn't feel that way right now because the market isn't live. But as soon as it goes live, I think economic realities will play a very large role in it.
00:39:18.812 - 00:39:33.010, Speaker B: And maybe some of our assumptions will be wrong, maybe some of them will be proven right. But yeah, I'm interested in seeing how people's interest translates into willingness to pay. Yeah.
00:39:33.380 - 00:39:52.768, Speaker A: And actually, it's a great segue into my next question is, what kind of form do you think these services, this revenue will take? Do you think you will allow every roll up to ban its own roll up token if they have one? Do you think it will be only e? How do you kind of envision.
00:39:52.864 - 00:41:04.670, Speaker B: That's a good question. So I should say the form that we've thought about the most is one where the restaker ultimately gets ETH, but the end consumer, right. The roll up is paying in their token. And one of the reasons for that is actually just purely a technical one, where that is how hyperlink works today, for the most part, is that you always pay in the gas token of the chain you're sending from, and the relayer then pays on your behalf in that destination gas. And so when sending from Ethereum, like I mentioned before, if you're sending to Solana, Ben doesn't need to have Solana at the outset. Ben just pays in Ethereum, and the relayer spends Solana to process Ben's transaction. And so since this kind of like gas management mechanism exists, it would be, I won't say trivial, but it would be easier to convert that.
00:41:04.670 - 00:41:54.988, Speaker B: But I think we also might see people who are actually interested in receiving the end tokens. You might have folks whose business model is to be slightly more speculative, like this thing worked very well for certain staking firms where instead of selling their staking rewards on receipt, they would just hold on to some amount of them. And then every so often you get a jackpot and that completely changes the complexion of your firm. And so my expectation is that you'll see kind of both models, but I think that the former is going to be a little bit more dominant to start. And then maybe the market goes crazy. People will be more interested in the latter of like, oh yeah, I'll take your token. Why not? Because everyone here, we've been in crypto for a while.
00:41:54.988 - 00:42:05.040, Speaker B: You see this every time too. At first it's like no cash flow. We're selling the azodon receipt. Then the market goes mad. I'll take your token.
00:42:05.380 - 00:42:08.280, Speaker A: There is the bear market trend and there is the bull market trend.
00:42:08.380 - 00:42:08.836, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:42:08.938 - 00:42:09.590, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:42:09.960 - 00:42:16.790, Speaker C: But also let's be real bear or bull, there's always going to be those dgens in us and whatnot that will sink the top.
00:42:19.080 - 00:42:19.844, Speaker B: For sure.
00:42:19.962 - 00:42:26.330, Speaker C: There's going to be like, yeah, it's a little bit about me, but think about it too.
00:42:27.260 - 00:42:56.930, Speaker B: Going back to economic realities, who are the ultimate restakers at the end, it's not actually like swell or Rio or Renzo. It's the asset owners depositing their ETH. And for the most part, these are crypto heads. So I could totally see a strategy where just by design, like the operator says, you know what, I want to just get a basket here.
00:42:58.660 - 00:42:59.216, Speaker C: Hell yeah.
00:42:59.238 - 00:43:33.928, Speaker B: Hyperlain basically put us on, let us take risk everywhere in as many places as possible. And we want to basically go as early as we can. And we're not getting paid in east, we want to get paid in their thing. And it kind of becomes like this interesting accumulation strategy. If I get layer as successful as I think as it will be, I'm willing to like put me down for $1,000 by the end of year one of abs. And being live, there will be someone who wants to go with that strategy.
00:43:34.024 - 00:43:37.040, Speaker C: $1,000 or 1000 different kinds of tokens.
00:43:40.020 - 00:43:42.912, Speaker B: Are you going to start the. I'm like, oh boy.
00:43:42.966 - 00:43:46.130, Speaker C: Yeah, I have that little degen in me all the time.
00:43:46.500 - 00:43:47.568, Speaker B: I know you do.
00:43:47.654 - 00:43:48.336, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:43:48.518 - 00:44:23.260, Speaker C: All right, cool. Actually, speaking about operators, and thank you for those answers. Speaking about operators, I think one of the things, and I'm from an operator, right. So the thing that we always try to think about is how might it impact our operations, right. How light or heavy it is to be able to run different protocols. Something specific here is the hyperlain abs. So how heavy or light would you say it is to be able to run hyperlain.
00:44:24.560 - 00:45:14.124, Speaker B: Pretty light, pretty light. That was by design. So the hyperlink validator software is non networked. So you kind of run it in isolation and then all it really does is it observes some node that has for the chain you're validated. So like phase one, you'd basically just need access to an RPC endpoint for ETH. What you're doing there is you're observing the mailbox specifically, and then once you've observed the incoming messages, you just sign off on them and you post that signature somewhere like highly available. So for the most part, a lot of different hyperlink operators at the moment just use s three.
00:45:14.124 - 00:45:55.996, Speaker B: I'd say once different decentralized storage solutions are as performant and as available, meaning that their uptime kind of looks like what you would get with big cloud. I'd expect to see more of those being used as well. But right now a lot of it's on s three and that's really all they need to do. We tell people how easy it is to do and then they're always like, I don't believe you. And then they do it and they're like, shit. Really wasn't easy to do. And so it's both lightweight and like fairly low cost.
00:45:55.996 - 00:46:06.540, Speaker B: We're talking the s three bells on this are like in the single digits. And if you're super active on a bunch of chains, it might be like in the teens.
00:46:09.990 - 00:46:38.170, Speaker A: Cool. And let's talk a bit now about operator requirements, because also something that we're seeing different answers in the AVs space. Will you have an active set? Will it be fully permissionless from the get go? And also are you going to put constraints as to what other AES an operator is running? Could you say, for example, if you're running this Avs, I don't want to share economic security with this Avs because I know it's really risky.
00:46:38.670 - 00:47:32.474, Speaker B: It's a great question for us. It's actually less about the risk there. And again, it goes back more to that willingness to pay because this is the thing where restaking is fundamentally different than a lot of people talk about it as a form of rehypothecation and then they go into, oh well, look at different forms of securitization. But I think insurance is the better analogy. Like you have an insurer and they have a certain amount of assets that are like the available insurance pool. And so imagine if one of the other insured people, they have a claim so massive that they basically empty the pot. Well, you and I were paying premiums the entire time, and now when it's our time to collect, there's nothing in the pool and we're kind of out of luck there.
00:47:32.474 - 00:49:02.860, Speaker B: And so that to us, is not so much the actual risk as what's the premium we should be paying for an AVF that is also active in other places because we could be good citizens. Right? Like, all of the hyperlink usage might never force a slashing condition, but then someone else just forced a slashing condition, and we were paying premiums thinking we're getting, say, $10 of economic security, but now we only got six. That's an issue, especially in the hyperlain case, where you see, I think it's not unreasonable to expect that people would want to ensure that the security that they're getting to some extent matches the value that's being transferred. So you probably don't want to secure a $10 million transfer with like fifty k of economic security. And so I think willingness to pay is really important. And I expect that our willingness and by extent, our users willingness to pay for what is like shared security among multiple AVss as being much lower because of this risk of like, well, you might wake up tomorrow and suddenly the pool of economic security available to you that, by the way, you were paying for this entire time is now considerably smaller and has no way to recover itself. And so what do we do then? Do we get compensated for a pass for you? Probably not.
00:49:08.310 - 00:49:09.826, Speaker A: So it's really going to be like.
00:49:09.848 - 00:49:13.650, Speaker B: A marketplace within a marketplace, for sure.
00:49:13.720 - 00:49:14.050, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:49:14.120 - 00:50:06.430, Speaker B: Which is, I think that's part of why it's a little bit hard to reason about. And we won't know for sure until it's on. But you asked earlier, restrictions or preferences? I think we would have a preference to work with operators that are kind of, at least the amount they stake with our abs would not be touched. But it's not going to be like a hard restriction. Rather, I think there should be different classes very much. And again, this is more of like all that bond thinking coming into play. Again, where the AA tranche is the pristine, it's not being used to secure any other Avss.
00:50:06.430 - 00:50:41.760, Speaker B: And then you would have lower rated tranches, which is like, oh, well, yeah, this 5 million that we're getting from this LRT might actually be present on seven other abs. So our willingness to pay for that is much lower. And similarly, the prevailing yield should be different to those folks because from our perspective, we are getting just a fundamentally different. Our risk exposure is just.
00:50:47.810 - 00:51:21.980, Speaker C: You know, this has been a very fun conversation. We have like a broad question here, and then I believe Edgar will take us home. So at least for the broader ecosystem, for eigen layer, right. There are going to be, and there are other kind of interoperability protocols being built. We won't call them out here just yet unless you want to. But do you see them as competitors or partners? How do you reason about the ecosystem of interoperability going forward?
00:51:22.670 - 00:52:16.222, Speaker B: No, I think obviously we weren't even the first to try and build this. We talked about IBC earlier, which I guess is more of like a public good in a way. And there's other folks know Layer zero and XR all like really incredible teams. And so we have to be realistic about it and think that there is competition, there is things that people want to like how many interoperability protocols are you going to integrate into your route, into your chain? Right. And so it's certainly a competitive space for us. It's more about the thing we try to innovate on is like extensibility developer experience. And we don't so much try to innovate on the security side.
00:52:16.222 - 00:53:17.106, Speaker B: We think that's kind of like, I get it, it's cool in crypto, like, you achieve points by how many people did you nerd snipe with your new design? But your new design is always like X many units of time, whether it's months or years away from being broken by some more clever person somewhere else. And so for us, we wanted to have this thing that's kind of like on top of different security innovation. And then, oh wait, you just basically did the thing that now takes your zk approver now works in like 4 seconds and it's super cheap. Amazing. Guess what's the next ism that we're launching? That one. And then if you're already using Hyperlane, do you need to rip out everything? No, you were pointing to that module over there. So you had one address that you were pointing at.
00:53:17.106 - 00:53:40.280, Speaker B: Now you're pointing to a new address and that's it. So that's kind of how we think about it. But there are different players that we're more collaborative with because as a team, we're a very open team. Everything we do is open source. Everything's out in the open. We're pretty active in our discord. We have no secrets, really.
00:53:40.280 - 00:54:01.870, Speaker B: And so teams that want to work with us, we are generally fairly welcoming, but there's a lot of teams in the category that just have a different approach and no qualms with that. I totally understand why and I don't feel bad or upset with people for taking that. It's super reasonable, rational approach.
00:54:02.690 - 00:54:15.986, Speaker C: Just a quick follow up on that and then I'll pass it back to Edgar. Do you see this interoperability market, so to speak, as a winner take most market?
00:54:16.168 - 00:54:16.814, Speaker B: Right?
00:54:16.952 - 00:54:22.200, Speaker C: Because you said earlier, how many interoperability protocols are you going to be for sure?
00:54:23.210 - 00:54:33.020, Speaker B: I think it's going to be fragmented across different market segments. And with each one of those, it is probably going to be a winner take most.
00:54:34.590 - 00:54:36.300, Speaker C: Awesome. Thank you.
00:54:37.150 - 00:54:53.678, Speaker A: Great, guys. Well, it was amazing to have you both. Ben, I love to have you as a co host. Maybe you guys can share where the audience can follow you. Learn more about hyperlane Coinbase cloud. John, if you want, you can start.
00:54:53.844 - 00:55:13.960, Speaker B: Yeah, so you could follow Hyperlane at hyperlane, underscore XYZ on Twitter. Could also join our discord if you want. All the links are there. As for myself, I'm at the pale nimbus. Maybe I'll drop that somewhere. I'll tell you why. That name is one I've used for years.
00:55:13.960 - 00:55:25.180, Speaker B: And Ben, let me just say, you should definitely bring him as a connor, you're so good. I just assumed that you already were. Like, you're a natural fit for this.
00:55:26.670 - 00:55:34.062, Speaker C: I appreciate that. I appreciate that. Thank you. And Edgar, you said, if you want to reach out to me potentially, then.
00:55:34.116 - 00:55:34.814, Speaker B: What do you call that?
00:55:34.852 - 00:55:38.698, Speaker C: Coinbase cloud specifically, you could see their Twitter.
00:55:38.794 - 00:55:39.342, Speaker B: Right.
00:55:39.476 - 00:55:52.340, Speaker C: But me specifically, I'm XB one seven z on Telegram. Happy to potentially chat. And if you're a protocol and want to talk to me, more than happy to.
00:55:53.030 - 00:55:59.170, Speaker A: Great. Last question, John, math question. What does 1D equal?
00:56:00.410 - 00:56:01.334, Speaker B: What was that?
00:56:01.452 - 00:56:03.270, Speaker A: What does one B equal?
00:56:07.930 - 00:56:12.886, Speaker B: Ah. Next out. They have to bring me on again and I want to come on with that.
00:56:13.068 - 00:56:20.440, Speaker A: Perfect. Thank you guys so much for coming and to the audience. We'll see you in the next one.
00:56:20.970 - 00:56:22.200, Speaker B: Thank you so much.
