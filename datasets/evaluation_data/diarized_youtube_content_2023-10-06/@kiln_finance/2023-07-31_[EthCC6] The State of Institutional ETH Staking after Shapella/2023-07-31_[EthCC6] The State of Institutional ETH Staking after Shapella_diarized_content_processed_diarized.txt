00:00:03.450 - 00:00:21.994, Speaker A: Yeah. So I'm Laszlo Zebo, the CEO and co founder of Kiln. Thank you so much for coming this week. We're opening the week with one day with TRDC and Etienne. Right, one of the most famous VC in crypto. From homeless to vc, homeless to killin to killing.
00:00:22.042 - 00:00:23.950, Speaker B: Yeah. We changed the slogan.
00:00:24.530 - 00:00:47.706, Speaker A: And today we will host panel on restaking just afterwards with the Eigen layer team. We're very excited to have them on roll ups, on institutional staking, on different major custodians in the space. And I think, last but not least, we'll talk about smart contract security and staking. Yeah. Etienne, do you want to introduce yourself?
00:00:47.808 - 00:01:19.400, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. Thank you for coming, folks. Welcome to Paris. Again, my chance to see Laszlo and his team once a year. We're part of art, right? If you look at this, just stunning. In November last year, I was at a private equity event in Amsterdam with 80% of the room gray hair. Pension funds, banks and the organizers wanted to cancel the digital asset panel, so we had to convince them to keep it going.
00:01:19.400 - 00:02:12.530, Speaker B: And the question became at the panel, why are you still in crypto? Why do you still bother with blockchain and whatever? So it gave me a chance to go back to like, okay, what is my why? And it's good to recenter and work with founders like Laszlo as a fund globally investing, working with founders that keep executing, keep building this vision of decentralized finance, peer to peer transactions, peer to peer trading. We're excited about it and we'll keep supporting, I would say, almost a cause not to sound too dreamy. So, yeah, welcome again. Appreciate it. So, last row to kick it off. Great title. The state of institutional eat staking after Chappella.
00:02:12.530 - 00:02:26.838, Speaker B: For those that are not that technically inclined on the whole concept, could you just briefly touch upon two things, like a quick, super quick for dummies, even. What is staking? What is Chappella?
00:02:27.014 - 00:02:37.802, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, we can also open it to other questions, and we'll try to make this panel as short as possible to, again focus on the other panels.
00:02:37.866 - 00:02:38.654, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure.
00:02:38.772 - 00:03:40.578, Speaker A: So, yeah, Chapella is the upgrade on the Ethereum protocol that makes now anyone able to unstake their assets. So since the beginning chain launch in December 2020, you were locked a bit more than two years and you couldn't unstake your assets. And yes, since Chappella, we've seen a lot of, obviously, some people and some companies in staking, but because it derisk all the investors of using staking, liquid staking, kiln products or liquid staking for institutions or the lido friends on my left here, Chappella basically derisk a lot of the process of staking eTh. And now you are liquid to the extent of. There's an exit queue, right? So I think it's seven, eight days now. But yes, you are liquid in that sense.
00:03:40.744 - 00:04:07.466, Speaker B: Okay. So in a more general sense, if you would look back like past, present, future on staking or Ethereum ecosystem, we have folks from Eigen layer here today, Babylon coming out from different angles. What are your view on that? Look at yesterday, where we are today, what's coming, and maybe even touch upon what excites you in that space.
00:04:07.568 - 00:05:29.318, Speaker A: Yeah, of course, first of all, staking was retail products, right? You would invest in icos, delegate to validate it on Solana, other coins, and it became, I think, in becoming more and more an instructional product or a platform product. So you now stake from the ledger live, or you now stake from Coinbase or from any other exchanges, wallets, custodians, platform in the space, from retail to a platform, crypto platform product. And you will be able to use liquid staking product and stake on liquid staking protocol from platform in an easier and easier way. And last but not least, yes, I think it will happen the same to Defi. Right. Then, if you're asking me what is exciting in the staking space right now, we're going to hear about Eigen layer restaking, this concept of shared security. And obviously it brings some issues, but this concept of you're reusing the security of the Ethereum protocol to throw it to l two s or to other networks, that's very interesting.
00:05:29.318 - 00:05:48.502, Speaker A: It also brings an additional source of rewards to users. So that's a great opportunity. You were earning five to 6%. Maybe you're going to be earning ten to 12%. Of course, according to different risk profile. You have to know that. But that's a huge opportunity for the end user.
00:05:48.646 - 00:06:23.506, Speaker B: Okay, on that note, you mentioned risk. You talk to a lot of institutions, whether in and out of crypto, the industry. How do you sleep? Right? If you think of security, there's a hack on Twitter almost daily. I wake up, I'm like, not today, please, not today. How do you sleep? How do you mitigate that effect? I know you guys have security as a first principle. So if you could touch upon that for a minute.
00:06:23.618 - 00:07:37.550, Speaker A: Yeah, how do I sleep? And it actually is like you can ask the same to easy, right? How do people at Lido sleep, first of all? Sorry, we do meditate a little bit to sleep. We don't take pills, but no how do we sleep in operational staking, you have this validation key security problem. So being sock two type two, or making sure you have the best security set up and you secure your keys as best as possible is key. It's essential. And obviously when you start to offer staking experience through smart contract, then you have this smart contract security issue that you need to focus on. And we see security as the most important and also the biggest risk for the company or right now and all our products we offer to our customers. You need to do regular audits now kind of ongoing monitoring on smart contracts is also essential.
00:07:37.550 - 00:08:22.894, Speaker A: So not only the temp stamp of you being monitored, you be audited, but continuous monitoring on smart contracts, seeing if an attacker is not trying to steal our funds or to find a breach there and doing just like audits regularly. Right. It's not because you've done an audit with certic that you're good to go. You need to do audits every month, every two months, every three months. That's an ongoing thing. And we have some of our smart contract developers in the room. There's gotier, there's maxim just in front of me and yeah, because of them.
00:08:22.894 - 00:08:26.302, Speaker A: And I know they're amazing people. I can sleep at night.
00:08:26.436 - 00:08:50.040, Speaker B: Okay, jealous. Okay, that's good. Just to shift gear for a bit. As a founder in such a fast moving industry. We were out for dinner last night and someone mentioned FTX was two years ago. Right? It's that fast. You try to keep up.
00:08:50.040 - 00:09:15.886, Speaker B: Looking back, founder Killin. I remember our first conversation in 21. Looking back, as a founder with a product focused on institutions in industry, is there anything you would share to founders in the audience? Some things you would have done different or advice? Anything you would share on your journey from the first inception of killing to where you are today?
00:09:16.068 - 00:10:13.694, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm in the space since 2017 18, and I wished I understood staking earlier. Right. I've seen cosmos in staking in 2018 and I think I really understood it in 2020. So my advice, if I can give tips or advice, is really try to be as curious as possible. Try to talk to people, try to win open to innovation, because we are in the fastest growing or fastest innovating industry, in tech, so maybe in history, and it changes and there's new topics every 6810, twelve months. So try to have a long term vision still, because moving also from one topic to the other every six months is not the right strategy. But you should keep open to what's happening in the space innovation to make sure you not miss one.
00:10:13.694 - 00:10:14.526, Speaker A: Yeah, for sure.
00:10:14.628 - 00:10:19.874, Speaker B: Okay, so you don't provide staking for AI bots yet for you guys.
00:10:19.992 - 00:10:21.918, Speaker A: Yeah, if you have other buzzwords.
00:10:22.014 - 00:10:37.990, Speaker B: Exactly right. So anyway, is there anything you would like to, anyone in the audience would like to ask Laslow, what about insurances that back your products? Evertas. You mean Evertas?
00:10:41.870 - 00:11:29.210, Speaker A: Yeah, we're talking to you guys. And obviously Evertas seems to be an amazing company and offering amazing insurance product on staking, right? Yeah. So we work with chain proof. So that's kind of like ninja backed by minicray that, you know, this is, let's say centralized insurance. We could offer nexus mutual to our clients. So this is more decentralized way of ensuring the end user through a smart contract and a community that is pooling or that is investing or financing the insurance products. But that's a major topic.
00:11:29.210 - 00:11:52.880, Speaker A: This being said, insurance, it's a lot of marketing in institutions. It doesn't cover all the risk, but a good insurance product will definitely bring more users into the space and more user using staking. Liquid staking DeFi products in the future.
00:11:54.710 - 00:11:59.826, Speaker B: Beautiful. Anyone else? Justin, what's the most exciting thing in.
00:11:59.848 - 00:12:02.180, Speaker C: Your eyes in the staking world right now?
00:12:03.350 - 00:12:51.794, Speaker A: Yeah, I think the movement of liquid staking from retail to platform restaking eigen layer. I'm so excited to see how this is going to turn out and how it's going to evolve. Also, I would like to see more of the real world rates matched with staking. I consider staking as the risk free rate in crypto. I think we'll see money market fund, us treasury, european treasury bonds on chain tokenized. And seeing like this combination of two rates rewards mechanism, I think that's pretty exciting. Yeah.
00:12:51.794 - 00:13:34.926, Speaker A: Do you see anything from a regulatory and tax perspective that's going to affect how staking works? Yeah, that's a big topic. And first of all, it's good to mention that there's no staking liquid or deFi license in the world right now. So it's still very much a gray zone. What some people say, like c token will be taxable event, a token won't be maybe the two of them, it's hard to say. And obviously it will highly depend on which jurisdiction. Right. For example, in France, you're being taxed on when you move fiat to crypto.
00:13:34.926 - 00:13:59.180, Speaker A: Crypto to fiat. Right. In the US or in the UK as well, it's basically per transactions. So I don't know, it's hard to say if staking will be taxed more than liquid staking. If what kind of liquid staking will be taxed? And the other one not. That's really hard to say right now.
00:13:59.550 - 00:14:32.290, Speaker B: I can speak for the Netherlands, for instance, where I'm based, spoke with one tax advisor and he was like, it's income. Spoke with another one, just get a second opinion. And he was like, it's a dividend. It's a yield if you don't claim it, whatever the whole thing. And they asked the question to the IRS, basically the dutch IRS, and got an answer. And it was completely the opposite almost. So there's still some sort of, if you will, uncertainty there, like no clarity.
00:14:32.290 - 00:14:40.680, Speaker B: And as long as there's no clarity, we play along, right? We play along. Let's go.
00:14:45.450 - 00:15:25.750, Speaker C: Strategy to move on after all this crashing, not for developer or people that are having users on the crypto space, but general people that just heard about all of these crashes and all these frauds that we had, how do you think that is the strategy to move on in terms of marketing? Because a lot of people that never touch on crypto, just touch it in the last year and lost a lot of funds in Celsius and a lot of bad things. So how do you think is this strategy to move on right now and try to win again the confidence?
00:15:28.890 - 00:16:24.440, Speaker A: For example, Bilal was one of the founders that started in France with me. Same period we came into the space. 2017 1817 was the bull market. 1819 was so hard for a crypto company to be founded and to build a product, which is, I think, very different from this bear market, right? Where you have a lot of crypto vcs that have a lot of money still and that are still investing into projects. You still have a market. The market is less booming than a year ago or like a year and a half or two years ago, but still there are many more users than we had previous bear market. Personally, I haven't seen as many team building interesting products right now.
00:16:24.440 - 00:17:33.440, Speaker A: Eigen layer, restaking, account abstraction, real world rates, roll ups, all these topics, they're still ongoing and the teams are still being. And I think that's great that I think this bear market is much more sane even than maybe the next bull. Because I can tell you that in a bull market, you're not finding product market fit. It's just a bull market, right? So it's the best way right now to find real users that really understand your product. That takes time to give you feedback, and then it will be roller coaster again. This being said, coming back to your question, yeah, I would say just try to keep building, get a few very interested users, get funded from the money you can find in the market, and then be prepared for the roller coaster, because when it's coming back, you better have a product that is ready to be used.
00:17:36.130 - 00:18:30.350, Speaker B: If I might touch upon that, I think after 22, we all lost meaning to your point with regards to trust of anyone participating or even thinking about participating, coming into this industry, we all lost whether or not you lost a dollar or $10. So I think that's definitely a part we need to work on still. Hence why there was a DeFi security summit two days ago, attended. I'm happy to see the size of research that's being done in that space. No vcs in the room, just guys looking at. On code level. Looking at code level, how to make this space more secure without relying on trusting guys like Alex from Celsius.
00:18:30.350 - 00:19:23.662, Speaker B: Because you think about it, there's a contradiction there, right? The industry is supposed to be trustless, yet we trust Celsius with our assets, or FTX with your assets. Right? So that's already a friction that, from an educational standpoint, we need to go back to that. Hence why, I think, of course, D, five platforms did two x, three x in their volume and user base, which again, proved why we bother with that in the first place. Right? So I think definitely there, the research is picking up. So I guess we need that trauma to refocus of why we're doing this. And I'm confident that after each blow, we keep building and keep growing, and it's getting better because remember, we came from Mount Gox, right? We came from Mount Gox. And I'm telling folks this every time, FTX is not the first bomb in crypto.
00:19:23.662 - 00:20:09.680, Speaker B: We had many before that, right? Even finance didn't stop after Lehman Brothers, right? So you keep going, you keep building, and things will get better. I still remember the first time I used a credit card online. Like, holy shit, like, what am I doing? Right? But you still try it. I got scammed once or twice, right, on a website. But you keep going, right? And of course, insurance is one part of it, gives you that sense of safety, but we keep going. And in human history, progress is a given, change is a given, and you support anyone that is pushing that needle. All right, we're going to shut down this part.
00:20:09.680 - 00:20:17.342, Speaker B: Thanks, everyone. So what do we do? We have many great speakers coming. Who do we have next?
00:20:17.396 - 00:20:21.306, Speaker A: The next is restaking, actually an eigen layer. So a big topic.
00:20:21.418 - 00:20:26.020, Speaker B: Big topic. Give us one or two minutes to prepare and we'll be right back. Thank you.
