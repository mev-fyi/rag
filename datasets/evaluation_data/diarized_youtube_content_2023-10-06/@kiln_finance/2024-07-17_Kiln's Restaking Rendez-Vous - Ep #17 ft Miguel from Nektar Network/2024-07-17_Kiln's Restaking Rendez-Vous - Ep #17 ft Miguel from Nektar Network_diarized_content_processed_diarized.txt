00:00:07.240 - 00:00:25.210, Speaker A: Hello, everyone, and welcome to a very special episode of the Kinerie's taking rendezvous. Today we have Miguel Prada, and Miguel Prada is going to be talking to us about Nectar Network, one of the few competitors to Eigen layer that exists today. Emil, how are you doing today?
00:00:26.040 - 00:00:32.040, Speaker B: Pretty good, thank you very much. And thank you for inviting me here to be part of this episode.
00:00:32.200 - 00:01:06.160, Speaker A: Yeah, super excited to do this. You are the first guest that is not linked to the eigenaire ecosystem, and we're really hoping that this podcast goes much further than just one restricting protocol. We think restaking is going to be a primitive, not only on ETH, but on many different chains. So we were very, very happy to have you on today to kick things off. Could you just introduce us what's your background and what led you to work in the world of crypto?
00:01:06.460 - 00:02:05.180, Speaker B: Sure. So yeah, my background is what they call telecommunication engineering, even though they are specializing microtronics as well, hardware, security models, cryptography. So I entered into blockchain around 20 1314, and it was mainly on startup wicking event where a friend of mine told me, like, do you know this thing about bitcoin? And they were surprised. What is this? Is this something about the deep web? What is it really happening? Dig deeper. And then I realized that it was super exciting, the possibilities of the technology be brutal. So yeah, I started to follow unblocksy system, but didn't really give the step to start working on blockchain full time as I did later. So this whole path started with IBM research, where I was working after my PhD here in Switzerland.
00:02:05.180 - 00:02:37.800, Speaker B: And yeah, they invited me to be part of the thing. I was happily working there, but at some point I decided that I needed a change. I wanted to work on our own project. We saw a lot of this on DVT, liquid staking, and now restaking. So we gave the step together with another colleagues from my region there in Spain. And yeah, we started launching what it was at the beginning, diva. And now we are launching this project of rest taking as something that we see can provide a lot of value to the ecosystem.
00:02:38.580 - 00:03:10.546, Speaker A: Great. Yeah, you just said it. And we're going to be talking about Necktown networking in a couple of minutes. But I would love to have your vision on why you started working on diva then. For those who doesn't know, Diva is a liquid sticking protocol that uses DVT. And maybe you can also explain to us what DVT is sure on Ethereum, I'd love to have your vision there. Why do you think that this LST DVT was needed in the ecosystem?
00:03:10.698 - 00:03:28.794, Speaker B: Sure. Yeah. So we have been always very eth maximalist, to be honest. We have been involved in Ethereum since the very beginning. I've been very close to the community participating in the dev console. So. So we wanted to build something that contributed to Ethereum first and foremost.
00:03:28.794 - 00:04:26.150, Speaker B: Like we, we are part of this, we want to protect Ethereum, and we saw needs, given the centralization of all the liquid staking, and the staking in general, we saw a need for a liquid sticking protocol that was really decentralized, something that could really bring the staking from normal node operators, people at home that want to participate and bring decentralization to the ecosystem. So the idea started together with a friend, Edwin Tunnel from Dubnot. He had the initial idea of joining DVT with liquid staking, and we started a hackathon with Lisbon in 2021. So participated, didn't win anything, as it's usually happening in the hackathons. But we thought that there was value here. So we continued with this project, couldn't continue with it, unfortunately, because he was in many other businesses in parallel. But I formed this team and we created a bigger team to develop the concept.
00:04:26.150 - 00:05:07.412, Speaker B: And then we raised some funds and developed in diva. And what it does, basically, is that, well, you generally have the liquid sticking layer that we all know. You deposit ether, you don't want to care about how these nodes are being operated, how these validators are operating. So you just want to deposit and receive some you, even though a fee is sticking from you, which is perfect. But there are other people that also want to run notes, they want to participate in higher Geo. This is a concept that at the beginning was introduced by Rocketbook, where you can have a share of a validity. So what we bring is the two sites, people that want to run nodes together with people that want to deposit ether, we bring them together.
00:05:07.412 - 00:05:58.220, Speaker B: But instead of creating validator, centralized and controlled by a single entity that runs and operates the keys, every validator in diva is created by a random set of people. So that way you deposit some etherse, an event is triggered, you create a validator, and the validator is not run by a single person, but it's split it like in pieces. So you basically run just share of the validator, and that allows many properties, like you have much more security and resiliency. So if one person goes down, doesn't matter, the validator will continue to perform well. So it provides this DVT technology coming from distributed validator technology is just that, it distributes the validator across many people. So if it fails, if something goes wrong, it continues running.
00:06:00.120 - 00:06:41.460, Speaker A: Very interesting. And yet this distributed validator technology is different from like, let's say like other liquid staking provider, because it does not rely on one single validator, but on many, like every validator relies on many different node operators. But we could also say that, for example, in the context of Lido, Lido is not being run by just one operator. Lido is being run by between 30 and 40 operators. So there is that type of distribution there. It maybe does not give the same level of decentralization at the validator level, but it's still not like one entity.
00:06:43.010 - 00:07:17.960, Speaker B: There is a key difference here. One, there are a few questions that people should always ask about liquid sticking protocol or liquid restriction protocol protocol, which is, can I join the network as an operator permissionlessly without asking anybody? The answer is yes or not. That will depend. In lido, this answer is no. There is a list permission that needs to be approved and so on. So since there is no collateral, there is no skin in the game for the operators, you need to be approved, and therefore it's not a permissionless protocol on the operational side. It is on the sticking side and not on the operational side.
00:07:17.960 - 00:08:16.260, Speaker B: And the other question is, when creating the validator is always the same set of people, the ones running the validator, even when using DVD, the answer is yes. It's really not decentralized because you have just the same cluster. So it doesn't matter if you have five people, each one from 1000 ether running 200 validators, or if you have five people, all of them using DBT, and then you have the thousand validators divided into, again, the five of them. So it's still the same thing, it's the same people, still permissioned and closed. The difference with diva is, as everything is random, it could be anything at any point in time. So when you create a validator, the operators of those validators are completely chosen at random in any point in time. Meaning that if you want to do any kind of collusion, any kind of attack, you will need to collude with virtually all the network in order to be able to control all the validators, because no one controls a full validator with the same set of people.
00:08:16.260 - 00:08:32.272, Speaker B: Could it happen that that is really controlling the same set of people, more than one validator? Yes, but it's probabilistically very, very rare. So yeah, that's the main difference that exists in D. But this randomization of.
00:08:32.296 - 00:08:59.576, Speaker A: Validator, gotcha, just to discuss a bit. To go back to what you were saying, how does. So you explained a bit what DDT and what different trade offs that DDT protocols and liquid sticking protocols were taking. Can you explain specifically, for example, with other major DDT solutions like SSD and oboe, how diva differs?
00:08:59.648 - 00:09:22.326, Speaker B: I. Yeah, so we have envisioned Diva at the time as a vertically integrated thing. So the DVT is natively in the liquid sticking. So everything is one. We don't envision the DVD without the liquid sticking. So it's all tied together. OSSV are only as DVT technology.
00:09:22.326 - 00:09:57.440, Speaker B: They are not a liquid sticking technology. They are used by liquid sticking protocols as a plugin. Therefore, they are tools for node operators and for protocols that want to run their operations on a more decentralized way. So they want to run like, they want to manage their DevOps a bit more decentralized. That's completely fine. So what you do in Innovo is they have like a middle layer that basically everybody's created is created via their clusters. And something similar happens around the validator layer on an SSD.
00:09:57.440 - 00:10:10.160, Speaker B: But you don't, yeah, you don't require any liquid sticking protocol. They are agnostic to the linguistic protocol, while we have just fully vertically integrated protocol where the DVT is a key core pointing of every validator created in diva.
00:10:11.540 - 00:10:30.010, Speaker A: Gotcha. Okay, so I think now the audience has a bit more context. We'll get into, like, the, the most interesting questions. What is the process for a DDT protocol, like the one you're building to evolve into a restaking hub?
00:10:31.870 - 00:10:40.070, Speaker B: So what is the process for the whole dvd to be used in rest taking know how? Yeah.
00:10:40.110 - 00:10:44.610, Speaker A: So for your own team, like, why did you make the decision to make that move?
00:10:46.320 - 00:11:28.830, Speaker B: Yeah, so Diva was, I think, we believe it was a very valuable technology. We have been this, in my case, for two years and a half, a little bit more. So we believe that the technology was sound and it was like, almost finished. So we are now in the process of launching the debug protocol, but it's not sufficient. As you can see in the market, linguistic and protocol is becoming a commodity. So even if we make the most successful, biggest, more challenging technology, advanced, anything you want, linguistic and protocol, it doesn't mean it's going to be sufficient. You need to have something else.
00:11:28.830 - 00:12:23.906, Speaker B: And we believe that leveraging via a new protocol, nectar protocol, what we built on Diva, we could have built nectar on top of any other protocol, on top of Lido, on top of Rokopo. It could have been built on top of anything. But of course, we believe that the best layer to be built this on top of is we built as another project, this nectar protocol, leveraging the rest taking. And by doing so, it has additional benefits. The way we design nectar, for instance, the VVT has very beautiful properties. Like if you have an operator that is misbehaving, you can expel them or penalize them even though it's not cooperating, because the rest of the cluster is able to expel them from the set. So this doesn't happen when you have a restricting protocol where each valid is run by an operator.
00:12:23.906 - 00:12:49.170, Speaker B: Because if they don't want to copy, they can keep the ether hostage on the consensus layer and never exit until we have at least EAP 7002. These kind of properties allow for a more customizable and much more powerful restricting protocol. We believe that Diva was the key choose. Of course we are a bit biased on the selection of the liquid sticking protocols from nectar, but how not to.
00:12:52.830 - 00:13:12.230, Speaker A: Great mixer absence? Could you just remind for the audience, like just give us like a zoom out of like, what is actually restaking to put it in, just in layman's term, like, what are the infant parties involved in restaking? There are different parties involved. Who are they and what are their goals?
00:13:12.770 - 00:14:06.108, Speaker B: Sure. The way I like to see risk taking is that if many people are familiar with the cosmos ecosystem or the Polkadot ecosystem, this is like bringing delegated proof of stake on top of Ethereum, where you have a layer of people that deposit ethere as collateral and that centralized amount of security into certain contracts, into certain operators, allow you to secure other things, other protocols, other services, other things that you're going to launch. And these other things are the ABS's. That's why the name active validator services, they are things that validate services that validate stuff. In Cosmos, it generally has been the other chains, like chains connected to the IVC. So that's why people use the Cosmos SDK. And some in Ethereum will be something else.
00:14:06.108 - 00:14:53.530, Speaker B: But the important thing is that they all depend into a single security office, a single security capital that is depositing to an operator. And this dependency that allow you to first bootstrap your protocol. If you are launching a new protocol, like a new chain, it allows you to bootstrap and give security and credibility to your protocol because you have a lot of real capital ether, real ethers backing your protocol. It allows you to bootstrap and attract more people to your network because you are able to gain the network effect from all the ecosystem, and it allows you to attract operators. So when you want to bootstrap a new network, you don't have operators, you don't know how. How to get them. By being part of this ecosystem, you can easily bootstrap all of these things at once.
00:14:55.870 - 00:15:38.820, Speaker A: Great. Okay. So very, very like you explained it, I think, very, very well. Now, I guess my follow up question is, what are the design choices that these nectar made up, say nectar made to build this restaking hub? And how do they deliver from other ways to do restaking, the main one being eigenaire. But we've also seen a lot of competitors raise money, announce their launch, and even for building or staking protocols on other chains, like what Babylon is doing for bitcoin, for example.
00:15:39.260 - 00:16:09.136, Speaker B: Yeah. So, yeah, we have made certain different decisions compared to Eigen layer and others. So the main ones have influenced us. We, this is one of the most sucky ones. We are not accepting any asset. We are not being a multi asset risk taking protocol. Why so? Well, when you accept any kind of assets, you are basically saying accept any type of token.
00:16:09.136 - 00:17:07.790, Speaker B: And this is like, what's happened when you collateral. What happens when you collateralize stuff with things that may or may not have value? In Ethereum, we know all, and we agree all the ethers are valuable. But what if the USDT, what if they wrap bitcoin, not the bitcoin, because that's different. But what if the bitcoin, which is, in the end, the representation of a promise of a bitcoin, loses its value because the company backing them just go bankrupt or something like that? Well, then all that collateral or that backing goes to zero. Now, we believe that mixing all these, all these risks is really complex, and we prefer to always keep the risk separated. So if you want to just do liquid sticking, you want to know what is your risk? If you want to do risk taking, you want to know what is your risk? So that's why we keep with the same philosophy of everything integrated only with a single thing, everything very clean. If you want to do all things, you can do it, but on top with further risk.
00:17:07.790 - 00:17:41.976, Speaker B: So in nectar, every validator created is created via viva to simplify the risk. So you know that every validator has the same risk profile. Every ether, every deposit has the same risk profile, because it depends on the dvd that is powering the. So you are unifying that part. Another addition that we are doing is on the ABS side. I know the Aigen layer has been working mainly with a lot of ABS, is trying to do a lot of serial, a lot of integrations, custom integrations. We are being more generic.
00:17:41.976 - 00:18:33.872, Speaker B: We are giving the voice to the ABSs. We believe that this is going to be a matter of numbers, of course, quality as well. But bringing a lot of abs bring a lot of value to the network. So we want to give them the voice to decide how the slashing needs to be done, how all these criteria, because no one better than them knows how to penalize their network or their operators if they are misbehaving. So they need to have the tools and the capabilities of penalizing the operators if they believe that is misbehaving. We of course, certain railways to guarantee that they are not just slashing a discretion without, you know, or if they becoming malicious or something like that. So there will be safe words in case something happen.
00:18:33.872 - 00:18:37.620, Speaker B: But yeah, they have the power to decide.
00:18:38.320 - 00:19:00.030, Speaker A: Okay, but yeah, you say the aliases, but when I hear alias, I also think about the risk takers and, and of course the dual rifles. Kearney is an operator. So I guess, can we say that at the end of the day, it's the market that will decide relationship between rewards and slashing?
00:19:01.650 - 00:19:58.982, Speaker B: Yes, of course, not only the market, but even just let's go basics to a single operator. When an operator decides to run a binary and say they collateral that people are depositing in me, my deposits, my restrict funds, I'm going to guarantee this thing that I'm running with the task that people put on me. They are also analyzing the risk and the reward of running such a binary. They need to decide if it's worth the risk. So when people deposit into the operator, when they restate into the operator, they need to also value. Okay, is this kilometer you guys are running? This and this and this abs, is it worth it to deposit on you? Because the rewards I'm going to extract from the areas that you run, together with the ethers that you deposited into you are going to be higher on risk reward. So everything is about risk reward in risk taking.
00:19:58.982 - 00:20:07.662, Speaker B: Everything, including this case, both for the selection of the operators choice of the abs to be run and for the rest takers. Yeah.
00:20:07.766 - 00:20:20.700, Speaker A: Okay. And just to, just to clarify something, so the operators choose the number of AV's and like the type of AV's that they want to secure. And then the restakers, they opt into a specific operator strategy or.
00:20:20.780 - 00:20:57.030, Speaker B: Exactly, exactly, exactly. So it works like that. In ECL, an operator can have more than one strategy. So you can have also a variety of strategies in which each one can obtain. So let's say you want to have only a if only reset strategy and you want to have an if plus this EBSS risk strategy. So then you can mix in and me as a risk taker who decides to deposit part in one with bigger risk or a part with lower risk. And I manage my portfolios based on the risk reward that I want to get, but I know where I'm risking and what I'm getting.
00:20:57.330 - 00:21:23.770, Speaker A: Yeah, gotcha. Okay, just zooming out for an instance, take into account also like the liquid staking part. Does that mean that now I can interact with diva and have a liquid analyst which is would be deep and also interact with the rest taking hub. Does that mean that the end product of that is an LRT or is.
00:21:23.810 - 00:22:08.020, Speaker B: That ETH locked people can build LRtail on top of that's the only thing we have enough, right? That's the only thing. We are not building lrt's. So we welcome and we are working closely with many alerts to be part of Nectar. But yeah, if anybody deposits either or ether or DV either into a contract or risk taking, the LRT may issue them an LRT token, a representative of ether deposit into into them. But yeah, that's part of the LRT's duties. Nectar provides the capabilities to do so. But we are not launching another ourselves.
00:22:08.440 - 00:22:30.200, Speaker A: Yes, makes sense. Interesting. And when it comes to timeline, we've been very excited about Diva for a long, long time. Ever since you did that vampire attack on Leidos TVL a while back. I think it was in fall of 2023. When can we expect to start testing with Diva and Necktar on Testnet?
00:22:31.260 - 00:23:01.680, Speaker B: Very question. So with Diva you can already test stuff? We have a testnet running since August of last year. Of course, it has evolved, it has different phases. And we are preparing the last version of the Testnet prior to the mini launch. So our target is to have everything ready by the end of July. We know it's very tight, but we want to try to see if we can make it. And ideally we want to launch Diva and nectar by them.
00:23:01.680 - 00:23:30.920, Speaker B: So that's mainly the timeline we have. The audits has been completed for the contracts and the client. But of course we are working on the fixing based on the reviews that the auditors did. So all the part is done. And yeah, we want to polish and make sure that everything works correctly before Maine. Because the thing is that by being a protocol that we cannot control, we cannot control the operators, we cannot just stop it. It needs to work.
00:23:30.920 - 00:23:45.270, Speaker B: There is no space for any kind of error or mistake. It's a challenge in that I know that the Wang, Wang, Wangenhe, it's the superior question, but it's a hard one.
00:23:47.090 - 00:24:02.070, Speaker A: And Miguel, just out of curiosity, would it not have been interesting for you guys to, I would say launch diva, the LST part before the restaking hub? My question is, why are you waiting to release both at the same time.
00:24:03.850 - 00:24:56.000, Speaker B: Right now? It's not the waiting, it's just that d one needs a bit more time to be prepared because as I mentioned, we cannot stop the operators running the validators because it's going to be purely decentralized, permissionless. So we want to make sure that that works. And right now, we're still fixing some issues found on the audit. So the thing is that by serendipity, both things will be ready more or less at the same time. So we can just launch both things at the same time, just because in time it makes sense. Beside that, I think that given the current market, we have seen that, again, liquid sticking has become a commodity. Right now, it makes more sense to just launch something that is much more like compact focus on Nectar.
00:24:56.000 - 00:25:21.220, Speaker B: Diva will be a layer that is the one that really runs all the validators. But Nectar could be run independently, as we mentioned, we could have run this independently and it's just that it coincides in time. We are not waiting. We don't have it like diva just waiting there without Nectar. Yeah, I wish.
00:25:23.360 - 00:26:02.410, Speaker A: Gotcha. And I guess my follow up question is to be next for the web app. So let's say that the Testnet goes live in July. Do you already have a sense of when we're going to be able to be basically preparing for Mainnet? Are you planning to also onboard aliases into the testnet phase and start testing for stashing and rework flows at the testnet phase? Are you going to like going, are you going to maybe go faster to mainnet two, attract the TVL early? What's your plan there?
00:26:02.790 - 00:26:44.940, Speaker B: Yeah, so our target is actually to launch as soon as possible. So there are slashings in Ethereum, but we won't have a slashing in Nectar at launch time as any other protocol. Like we all know by now that slashing of ABSS is complex topic. It's not something to be done quickly. It takes some time. So what we will launch will be the rest taking protocol where avss can easily plug in, but there won't be a slashing enable into the protocol at launch. And hopefully, yeah, by, by July is when we, we try to target.
00:26:44.940 - 00:27:18.202, Speaker B: We have been already with testnets for a long time. That's why we, we believe that we have enough confidence in that, that the network works in terms of latency and performance. Everything looks promising. We will launch a version horse key that people can test before the main launch, but it will be more like an iterative process. Similar again to what happened in Cosmos where you have always a test networking with the next upcoming release to be deployed in Mainnet. You test there. When you see that everything works out, you move that release to Maine and you keep transferring their leases from Testnet to Mainnet.
00:27:18.202 - 00:27:32.520, Speaker B: So we want to first launch testnet has. Okay, everything is ready, let's test it. Is it okay? If we feel comfortable, we launch it in Mainnet and we keep the releases on Testnet until we transfer them to Mainnet. So that would be the main flow.
00:27:33.220 - 00:28:22.752, Speaker A: Okay, interesting. And when it comes to your go to market strategy, you are not the only one in the restaking race. I would say like as a hub Eigen layer has, I would say like a clear headway. But since it hasn't launched stashing and rewards, we can really say that that TVL is locked yet. What would be when you release your mainnet, like your speech first to the risk takers to attract this tv, like are you planning to have an incentive program similar to what has done like for example on Eigen layer in the past? And I guess same question goes for the AVss that would build on top of nectar. Yeah.
00:28:22.776 - 00:29:25.840, Speaker B: So right now we have already points program that is being updated and changed depending on the things we are launching. There will be more news, if I recall correctly this week. So yes, there will be incentives. We will try to attract as many people to build on us, not because we want to shield them, but because we believe that we can provide a lot of value to them. So hopefully they think so as well and they opt in to work with us regarding the incentives to attract AVss to do that in a no more long term future together with these license that will depend I on the community. I will say like we need to decide what is best, we need to talk to the AbS's, we need to talk to the risk takers, we need to talk to. Yeah, I think it's not well understood how all of this plays out.
00:29:25.840 - 00:29:40.170, Speaker B: It's not well understood how AVss are going to plug into rest taking, but we want to work with abss to shape it together and. Yeah, and have an answer for that.
00:29:40.550 - 00:30:08.260, Speaker A: Gotcha, sorry, I got you. And what would you say like, what would be like your top argument when you talk to an Avs? Would you say that it is the. I would say the freedom in design of the rewards and the slashing, like I would say the. The configurability of the entire system that would be like the. The thing that makes nectar better than competitors.
00:30:09.440 - 00:30:44.630, Speaker B: Yeah, we believe so. We believe that. We don't want to be the ones dictating how your thing works also because there is too much variability on the options that what an ABS can look. So we believe that the one that knows best is you as an Abs. Anybody that wants to build something on top should have all that freedom. Yeah, we believe that's powerful. I think that's the feedback we got from many people is that, that's something interesting, I guess that more people will start to do the same.
00:30:44.630 - 00:30:59.270, Speaker B: Many other liquid sticking protocols, probably because we believe that's where the market is going to have the flexibility to keep the slashing to do the abss instead of controlling that ourselves.
00:31:01.170 - 00:31:53.750, Speaker A: Great. Closing on this discussion, I would love to have your long term vision for what a risk taking primitive can bring to an ecosystem. Do you think that like restricting was something that was clearly needed in the ethereum space and that clearly, like the crypto space would have had another face today if, let's say like a restricting primitive was invented like five years ago? Like a lot of things that we usually hear is that. For me, like if we're sticking hub, had it been invented five years ago, like we would have seen like a lot less half layer ones. How do you feel like restaking will impact the crypto ecosystem in the next like five to ten years?
00:31:55.890 - 00:32:37.254, Speaker B: Yeah, I think I agree with you. I think restaking could have brought a completely different picture here. Coming back to the well, repeated similarity with Cosmos, many people launched there because it was easier to launch something there was easier to use. SDK integrate. You were automatically connected through IBC to many other protocols. So this is what we believed restaking can bring to Ethereum and it can provide a lot of value to the ecosystem. Now, would that have changed in the past? I think the market was focused on other topics.
00:32:37.254 - 00:33:23.660, Speaker B: We passed by Defi, we passed by nfTs. Infrastructure wasn't really something that many people were focused on. And whoever wanted to build something, we're building them in another layer, l one, as you mentioned, or in other blockchain just directly. So I think that maybe people would not have seen what this kind of technology can provide them in the past. I think this is the right time right now where people want to build new, innovative solutions and want to attract a lot of people to their protocol. So we believe this is the right time right now. Earlier will have been more difficult to get something like this working, but yeah.
00:33:24.680 - 00:34:00.720, Speaker A: Cool. Gotcha. And do you feel like what AE's use case are you most excited about? Are you most excited about like the decentralization that AVC will bring in the how l two s work are you more interested in, I would say more exotic use cases for avss? Like, we've definitely seen aviass doing some very interesting things. For example, NPC technology and stuff like that. Like how, how various do you think the alia space can be in the future?
00:34:01.570 - 00:34:54.187, Speaker B: Yeah, good question. I think the most valuable stuff that risk taking can bring HST ecosystem, all these things and the scaling, as you mentioned, because it will allow the whole Ethereum to grow and to grow in community, to grow in things built on top of. We all know the bigger the ecosystem, the more network effect it has, the better has been for all Ethereum in general. So that's the one that I'm most excited about, about giving the possibility for any project to easily build on top of Ethereum without needing to think too much so that you can really get something built on Ethereum easily. I think that's, that will be the one that I'm excited. But on the geek side. On the geek side of.
00:34:54.187 - 00:35:37.348, Speaker B: I've always been a fan of multiparty computation. Obviously we have in diva multi party computation via distributed key generation for all the validators. And particularly I love everything related to fully homomorphic encryption since a very long time. So I'm really eager to see if the speed of terminology. Has it happened with the zero knowledge proofs will come also to fully monetary encryption? If so, the applications that this kind of technology will bring will be astonishing. So I'm really bullish on Sama and other people beating on full demographic encryption to bring this to the table. Yeah, I think that will be great.
00:35:37.348 - 00:35:49.100, Speaker B: That will be in the next technological challenge and breakthrough if you've done well. Let's see. Question mark to see how it plays out.
00:35:49.560 - 00:36:32.360, Speaker A: Very interesting. We're definitely, I mean, I'm definitely close to some people in the Zama team, so it was my heart that you mentioned them. I would say like closing question, what do you think generally about. I would say the competition in terms of restarting, how do you think it's something that's. Do you think it's a good thing? Do you think it's a win uptake, smooth market. Do you think that the different trade offs in the way that they are set up enables for different application, different avss and that that means that different will survive or is it a winner of the XL market?
00:36:33.900 - 00:37:18.352, Speaker B: I think by now we set a statement quite clear in front, like you know from, from us, that when Lido was saying there is only going to be one liquid sticking, we said we're going to build diva, and we believe in diva still. We haven't of course, like we need to launch, okay, we need to launch, but we believe in diversity of liquid sticking. When people say this only going to be one Eigen layer, it's going to be part of Ethereum say okay, and now we see caragon, now we see symbolic and now we see as well, right? So we have a variety of restricting layers. I don't believe anything in blockchain should be a single thing. Not even on the protocols. Diversity is richness and we have a lot of diversity in ethereum clients. We have a lot of diversity in liquid staking.
00:37:18.352 - 00:37:59.510, Speaker B: Why not having it also as well on risk taking? Because each one of the risk taking protocols is also providing different features and different capabilities. And that's not bad in a sense, because each one attacks a different niche on the market of different needs, of different type of ABS's, of different builders that want to build with one type of feature or another type of feature. And that shouldn't be something that is one for all because there is much value to be provided, especially on the building capabilities, than just centralizing there. Because winner take it out. So yeah, I really don't believe in the winner take it all because the market always proves that you can always be disruptive and have competition.
00:38:00.900 - 00:38:07.196, Speaker A: Does that mean that there is also space for other rest taking hubs on other course like bitcoin, Cosmo?
00:38:07.268 - 00:38:41.430, Speaker B: Yes, yes, and all in other layer ones. In Ethereum, anywhere there is always a space for competition. And competition is what thrives innovation and what drives trying to improve your protocol, trying to make everything better. Otherwise you is comfortable with any competition you don't improve and then the users will pay the cost of not having the innovation or the improvement of the network until someone comes and does it. So innovation is something that always comes one way or another.
00:38:42.890 - 00:38:52.510, Speaker A: Fantastic. Well, Miguel, this was great to have this conversation with you. I really enjoyed it. Any closing thoughts for the audience?
00:38:54.900 - 00:39:21.534, Speaker B: Not really. I would just say, as usual, I know there are many haters of free staking. There are also many believers of staking as the famous sentences with great power, responsibility. That's what the speed of Uncle Ben said. We believe so. I think it needs to be taken with care. There are risk on risk taking, but there are also a lot of benefits.
00:39:21.534 - 00:39:59.698, Speaker B: There is also a lot of value to be provided. So look at everything with care. Take a look at what are the risk. And if there is value, is it permissionless, is it decentralized? What are the trade offs? And analyze everything with care. But I think there is a lot of value. And I really appreciate that you invited me to talk about Nectar network and, yeah, to be able to share with the people what we are building. So really exciting and really appreciate it.
00:39:59.714 - 00:40:10.070, Speaker A: It was a pleasure. Thank you so much for coming. And just before we finish off, where can we send the audience to learn more about Nectar? Diva? Maybe follow you on Twitter.
00:40:10.730 - 00:40:40.200, Speaker B: Yes, they can go to Nectar with Ka Nextar network or the same in Twitter. Twitter or X Nectar network. And they can read more. And there are this core over there. So, yeah, Nectar with Ka Nectar network. And, yeah, we'll be there waiting for any questions, thoughts, feedback, complaints, anything that people want to share.
00:40:41.260 - 00:40:49.550, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, Miguel, thanks again for your time. You've been very generous with us and to the audience. We'll see you on the next one. Bye bye.
00:40:49.850 - 00:40:50.802, Speaker B: Thank you. Bye.
