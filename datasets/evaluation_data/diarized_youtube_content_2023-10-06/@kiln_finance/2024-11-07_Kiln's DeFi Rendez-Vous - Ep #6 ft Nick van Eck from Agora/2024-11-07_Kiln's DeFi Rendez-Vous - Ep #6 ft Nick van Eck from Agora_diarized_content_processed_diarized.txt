00:00:07.320 - 00:00:18.805, Speaker A: Welcome on the podcast, Nick. So maybe quick reminder, I'm Las Rosavo, the CEO co founder of kil. Today I'm glad to be joined by Nick Benek, the CEO and co founder of Agora.
00:00:19.665 - 00:00:20.885, Speaker B: Thanks for having me.
00:00:22.345 - 00:00:54.185, Speaker A: Thanks for being on the podcast. So just today we'll be diving into DeFi, a revolutionary financial system heavily reliant on stablecoins. The stablecoin market is skyrocket to nearly 170 billion with projections of reaching 3 trillion in the next decade. With your pivotal role in the space, it's great to have you here, Nick. Congrats on the recent fundraising, the launch of the Agora backed AUSD stablecoin. What a journey.
00:00:55.085 - 00:01:38.375, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you. It's been a busy couple of months and we've gotten a lot done in the last year. We actually started the business almost a year ago to date of this podcast and launched the product about three months ago on eth. But we're already now on Avalanche sui and by the time this podcast come out we'll have been able to share that we're on Mental as well. Natively doing about 10 million plus in on chain volume a day and nearly 100 million minted. So quite a quite a big few months and we're just starting the sex rollout so. And the centralized exchanges will be coming very rapidly, so a lot to talk about.
00:01:39.275 - 00:02:01.655, Speaker A: Congrats. Yeah, that's definitely a topic. I would like to deep dive in the different ecosystem, the chains, the different geography you're looking at and I would say maybe before we deep dive into Agora and your strategy and the places you're at, could you maybe introduce yourself, your background and your journey in crypto?
00:02:02.015 - 00:02:54.751, Speaker B: Yeah. So I grew up surrounded by markets and investing. My family runs in an asset management business and so I think I got exposed to that sort of thing much earlier than most. I remember when I was a very young kid getting handed the Wall Street Journal or Barons on the weekend by my dad and being told tell me the most interesting thing that happened this week. It was all financial news and so I had you developed an interest in investing and markets and always thought that I wanted to be an investor. So I spent a lot of time both in high school reading biographies of the best investors and then through college trying to figure out what in the investing world I wanted to do. And inevitably that led me to looking for working for a hedge fund.
00:02:54.751 - 00:03:38.215, Speaker B: I spent the summer at a hedge fund in 2016 and all the partners there were actually buying Bitcoin PA. It was right before the second halving Murray, the founder of the firm, had stumbled upon crypto and was intellectually curious enough and contrary enough to dive in. It's like, why are there these 3,000 plus crypto assets? And so he took a hard look at bitcoin, had a thesis that it was going to hit 100k by 2030. And it seemed like a relatively simple thesis. Right. Demand goes up, price goes up, and you had a fixed fixed supply. And I had a lot of familial experience with the gold market.
00:03:38.215 - 00:04:25.122, Speaker B: So Vaneck, which is my family's business, runs the largest gold miner fund in the world. And so I grew up getting cougarands from my grandfather. And so I understood the gold thesis and said, hey, you know, this is much more interesting because you have this open source global network that this is running on. It's like 10 to 100x better than gold. And so that's when I first got into crypto. But I spent the next five plus years as a technology investor focused primarily on enterprise software, where I developed a much greater understanding and appreciation for open source technology and got sucked back in to crypto right around defi summer. Um, and you know, for the first time there were real like applications that I wanted to use.
00:04:25.178 - 00:04:25.370, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:25.402 - 00:04:47.857, Speaker B: Like using Uniswap Aave for the first time was like magic. It was like using your, the iPhone for the first time. And to me it was very clear that blockchain was going to eat financial services and payments. Um, and I think, you know, throughout cycles there's always sort of this like, oh, the institutions are coming, institutions are coming and like this is going to be it.
00:04:47.921 - 00:04:48.525, Speaker C: Right.
00:04:49.185 - 00:05:32.705, Speaker B: To me it's like the institution is already here. But these things take 20 to 30 years, just like the cloud transformation and transition. But at the end of it you're going to have a hundred plus public companies, you know, trillions of dollars in value. And I feel like we're just at inning number one or two. Whereas I got into the investing world in enterprise software probably inning six or seven. And so that's what sucked me back in, you know, convinced some of the managing partners to let me invest in the space while I was a general catalyst and then decided to go build a company that I believe should exist. So I left in October of 2023 and, and here we are.
00:05:34.005 - 00:05:45.835, Speaker A: Fantastic. Yeah, that's, that's quite exciting journey. And do you see any synergies between the family business and what you're building?
00:05:46.895 - 00:05:51.279, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's a, there's a lot of synergies on the asset management side.
00:05:51.327 - 00:05:51.511, Speaker C: Right.
00:05:51.543 - 00:06:45.961, Speaker B: So when you're running a stable coin, it's really important that you manage those assets well and custody them at reputable financial institutions. And you know, when I was looking at the market, but also what was going on with sort of chokepoint 2.0 and all, all of that stuff in the United States, it was very, it's very hard for crypto companies to get access to US banks, much less the largest US banks. And what we actually have done is structured it so that Vaneck is the investment manager behind Agora's reserves. And so you have a 70 plus year old asset manager that manages 100 billion plus dollars managing the assets. And then we also have State street as the cash custodian and fund admin. And so the assets are custody, that one of the largest G sibs in the world.
00:06:46.033 - 00:06:46.457, Speaker C: Right.
00:06:46.561 - 00:07:00.889, Speaker B: And so you know that they're safe, secure, they're not at, you know, some sort of offshore bank or it's super opaque where you know who's actually controlling the assets or at a small regional U.S. bank.
00:07:00.937 - 00:07:01.145, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:01.185 - 00:07:30.201, Speaker B: That might be at risk of, you know, solvency issues which we saw obviously in, in the past. And so we wanted to start the stable, you know, with institutional grade backing and support and really infinite scalability, we could take in $100 billion tomorrow. And I don't say you, I don't want to say that that wouldn't matter or wouldn't raise any flags, but the bank could support that really easily. Whereas that's not true for 99% of global banks.
00:07:30.343 - 00:07:30.669, Speaker C: Right.
00:07:30.717 - 00:07:45.505, Speaker B: And so starting with institutional grade scale was really important for us. And so that's how we're working with Fanac today. That's really their only involvement is just managing the reserves. But I'm sure there's things that we can be doing with them in the future.
00:07:46.765 - 00:08:09.885, Speaker A: Right. And maybe just a last side question before we deep dive in Agora that you should only kind of start to pitch. You were mentioning that there were investors that you were looking at when you were younger. Were these investors were the ones that you were looking up to, getting excited about?
00:08:10.585 - 00:08:39.455, Speaker B: Yeah, a lot of ones that are not as well known. I mean, Stan Druckenmiller is one who's more well known, but his ability to compound his portfolio at double digit percentage, 20, 30% a year for decades is crazy. Like it's, it's, you know, just as impressive as people like Tom Brady who were at the top of their game for 20, 25 years.
00:08:39.795 - 00:08:40.535, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:41.875 - 00:09:20.649, Speaker B: And it requires A tremendous amount of discipline, intellectual curiosity. And that's what like really got me interested. I also would say at an early age you think that, you know, people in finance, it's like, you know, one of the highest competition environments with some of the smartest people in the world. And like that to me is interesting and exciting because people are putting their money where their mouth is, which is I feel like not the case in most of society today. There's a lot of pontificating on the Internet but people aren't really backing it up. And you know, as an investor you have to.
00:09:20.697 - 00:09:21.169, Speaker C: Right.
00:09:21.297 - 00:09:36.125, Speaker B: And there's, you know, there's no way to sort of massage the truth. It's like either you perform or you don't. The numbers are there and they don't lie. So Sandra Rockenmiller is one nava a lot of deep respect for.
00:09:37.865 - 00:10:15.095, Speaker A: Right? Yeah. And it's going to be even more and more so the case on blockchains where this data is accessible completely on chain of the Dune dashboard and on daily basis you won't be able to lie any. Your performance will be the source of truth. So I guess coming back to Agora, you kind of mentioned it institutional based, very scalable compared to most of the other stable coin in the market. Can you maybe introduce Agora and is that true? Do you see other differentiator that you bring to the market?
00:10:16.395 - 00:10:28.251, Speaker B: Yeah. So when I was still in my seat at my prior firm, I was looking at the market and you really only had two stable coins, centralized fiat coins that mattered.
00:10:28.283 - 00:10:28.475, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:28.515 - 00:11:22.401, Speaker B: Tether and circle. Tether was sort of part of this 1.0 class of stables. They were the first digital dollar brought on chain, non US focused, non US issued and they really kicked off this market and they famously don't really work with that many people directly. And then you had the second wave of stables that got going in 2018, 2019 with USDC BUSD GUSD a lot of these exchange backed stables and they started to have a lot of demand because they replaced BTC as a quote token on many of these exchanges. Yeah, I got back into, I got into crypto in 2016. So I remember the days when bitcoin was used as a trading pair against everything.
00:11:22.473 - 00:11:22.801, Speaker C: Right.
00:11:22.873 - 00:12:41.285, Speaker B: Like from Iota to Cardano and like feather coin and Ravencoin, all this stuff. And so these exchange backed stables started to replace BTC as the quote token. And then you, since then you've had this explosion of different market participants, whether it's staking providers, chains, different VMs, different custodians regional exchanges, wallets and the markets change very dramatically. This whole explosion of defi, like defi didn't really exist in any material way until 2020. And what you now have is this big conflict of interest problem, right, where you have about 150 billion of fiat coins outstanding between Tether and Circle, but no one else is really a participant in that economic system other than Coinbase who receives half of the income from generated from usdc, Tether and Circle. And to me like this is fundamentally like wrong. These assets would have no value if it weren't for the businesses and their users choosing to use them.
00:12:41.285 - 00:13:09.275, Speaker B: And it kind of seemed worse than the banking system. And I was like, this is not why we started crypto. And so I wanted to change that and felt that I was in a position to do so. And so at the time there were a lot of these yield bearing stable coins coming out. And I think that is a really tough sell from a centralized participant.
00:13:09.395 - 00:13:09.699, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:09.747 - 00:13:30.855, Speaker B: I think if you're a decentralized model that works, but if you're centralized it doesn't for a few reasons. One, your security in 70% of global jurisdictions, right. Which really limits or utility. And also the people that can interact with you like whether it's a market maker or someone else.
00:13:30.935 - 00:13:31.555, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:31.935 - 00:14:35.481, Speaker B: And so that's number one. Number two is they really don't have any margin for liquidity development, which is really important and because they're giving it out to everyone. And so I think that's why you saw a lot of these centralized yield bank stable coins fail to take off in a meaningful way. You know, we launched three months ago and we're already doing, you know, over 10x the volume on a daily basis of, you know, the two largest participants in this market. Which I think highlights the challenges of the centralized yield bearing model. And so from our perspective, you know, we were looking at the market and we're like, okay, how do you get all these different businesses and participants into your network? And so what we've designed is a one to one stable, it's issued outside the United States. We focus on the non, non US market and then go to businesses, whether it's applications, exchanges, fintechs, whomever, and say hey, for services that you provide to us, we'll share the majority of the net income with you.
00:14:35.553 - 00:14:36.165, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:36.985 - 00:14:51.417, Speaker B: Whether it's 60, 70, 80% and ultimately that means it's effectively your unstable on your platform, you're capturing the majority of the value. But then we're going out and doing the things like Building the compliance program.
00:14:51.481 - 00:14:51.705, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:51.745 - 00:14:56.369, Speaker B: Getting the licenses, building liquidity, building the network building infrastructure.
00:14:56.497 - 00:14:56.809, Speaker C: Right.
00:14:56.857 - 00:15:11.945, Speaker B: And so it enables all these different institutions that are using USDC or USDT to swap in a USD and suddenly be making a significant amount of cash flow that would have otherwise been going to one or two players.
00:15:12.025 - 00:15:12.517, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:12.641 - 00:15:25.141, Speaker B: And then these businesses can then use that cash flow however they want. Right. And better, better their business and better the service for their users. And so that, that's the model and that resonates with people.
00:15:25.253 - 00:15:25.905, Speaker C: Right.
00:15:26.445 - 00:15:36.665, Speaker B: Because a lot of these businesses feel like they're leaving money on the table. And it's, it's because they are. So I'll pause there, but that's a little bit on us and what we're doing.
00:15:37.285 - 00:16:05.495, Speaker A: No, that's super clear. And actually, I mean, we can only agree that to compete on supply, the large ones, if they will one day will have to give back a part of their revenue to the ones that distribute them. That's for sure. And do you see maybe to pause on this, do you see these businesses giving back the rewards to the users or keeping it for themselves? Is it a mix? What do you see there?
00:16:05.795 - 00:16:45.111, Speaker B: I think it depends on the business. Right. So, right. We interact with like B2B payment companies, right, where they may just be holding funds for a few hours and they don't really have the end users where it would make sense to maybe share, share income with them. But for applications or centralized exchanges, you can imagine that they'll probably try to run some of those programs and see if it, if it makes sense. And if it does, they'll probably lean into them as a, as a source for growth. So we definitely expect that, you know, some of these businesses will try different programs and ones, some will lean more heavily.
00:16:45.111 - 00:17:20.943, Speaker B: On this marketing, marketing side, I would also say what's important is like money needs to be credibly neutral. And that was one of the issues that we saw is like if you had, you know, USDC on Solana or like you in Fireblocks or on Bybit, you have the revenue generated is going to coinbase who has competing products. I think that's something really that we want to highlight is like we'll work with anyone, we just need to kyb them. And we think it's your platform, your user is your money.
00:17:20.999 - 00:17:21.215, Speaker C: Right.
00:17:21.255 - 00:17:28.075, Speaker B: And you should be able to use that however you like and that can continue to resonate with people.
00:17:28.535 - 00:18:05.687, Speaker A: Yeah, definitely see the pitch for Asian exchanges, right. If I have one of these leaders at one of these very large top 10 Asian exchange why I would use Agora instead of the competition. I guess that's part of my following question. You mentioning you're focusing on every market outside the US you didn't mention outside Europe with the MICA regulation that is now in place. And so yeah. Can you explain what is your geographical expansion, why these regions matters before I go?
00:18:05.751 - 00:18:12.479, Speaker B: Yeah. So something that was really important for us from the get go is just focusing on the non US Market.
00:18:12.567 - 00:18:12.815, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:12.855 - 00:18:25.095, Speaker B: It's why we've issued outside of the United States. We don't serve US businesses as primary participants because if you think about where stablecoins are really valuable, it's outside the United States.
00:18:25.175 - 00:18:25.487, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:25.551 - 00:19:22.515, Speaker B: It's making cross border payments easier serving em or developed market dollar demand. Like those are the two things that are really driving this market. Whereas if you're an American it's pretty easy to move money within the country but when you get outside the United States that things become really challenging and it's 100x improvement. And so we're focused on Asia but also Latin America and Europe and we want to really build that, that sort of global institutional grade, credibly neutral fiat quan and so that's what we're planning to do. I'm headed to Buenos Aires tonight to meet with some of our partners down there. But that's why we're focused on the non US market is because we really believe that to be the opportunity and it's fortunate for us that our largest competitor is working with the largest US exchange because that's not really where we want to be going anyways.
00:19:24.345 - 00:20:14.895, Speaker A: That's right. Makes sense. Makes total sense. Why traveling to Buenos Aires I think tonight or tomorrow or you're spending a lot of time in Asia in general and there are other continents, maybe Africa. I'm sure part of your focus coming back on your go to market strategy, you mentioned the exchanges, the wallets, the custodians, the crypto native people. Crypto native companies but also the payment companies moving forward, maybe the fintech, the Neo banks and the and the PSP using stablecoin as we as the market grows. How do you see this go to market engine? When do you think these non crypto native companies will move into the space and start to use stable Coin in their flow?
00:20:15.725 - 00:20:45.727, Speaker B: Yeah, I think you're already starting to see it if you look at our customer base today. So we've onboarded over 50 businesses in the last few months. About 80, 90% of them are pretty crypto native but about 10 to 20% are really more web2 focused and I think stablecoins are the first stepping stone for a lot of these traditional businesses to get into crypto, so to speak.
00:20:45.791 - 00:20:46.279, Speaker C: Right.
00:20:46.407 - 00:21:44.799, Speaker B: Because moving, you know, with stables and you know, fiat coins like us, all you're doing is just moving money cross border. It's like not, it's not as complicated as, you know, interacting with AAVE or Morpho or you know, staking providers. And so a lot of, for a lot of these companies, it's not just 10x better, it's 100x better using stables to move money cross border. And so we're starting to see some startup companies leveraging stables to provide a better service to the incumbents. But also some of the incumbents are starting to move in themselves and I think this is an opportunity for us to go serve them right. You know, you saw PayPal launch their own stablecoin. I imagine that they'll be doing, using that for a lot of internal mechanics for their businesses and then, you know, we're there to serve their right because they're all these payment companies aren't going to be using their competitors stable.
00:21:44.799 - 00:21:50.231, Speaker B: And this is why I think it's really important to be credibly neutral because the market is so much bigger.
00:21:50.343 - 00:21:50.615, Speaker C: Right.
00:21:50.655 - 00:22:04.833, Speaker B: We can go to the thousands of payment companies and say, hey, use ausd. You know, we'll share the majority of the underlying revenue with you for services that you provide. To us. It's basically you're stable but you don't have to do any of the work.
00:22:04.969 - 00:22:05.289, Speaker C: Right.
00:22:05.337 - 00:22:27.765, Speaker B: And by the way, you're not using your competitor stablecoin and effectively funding them. And so we're seeing a ton of payment companies in Singapore, a lot in Colombia, Mexico start coming to us actually some in Africa as well. And so we're excited to continue to help pick up share from that side of the market.
00:22:28.605 - 00:22:57.605, Speaker A: That's super exciting. 50 clients, 80% crypto native, 10 to 20% are web2 or non crypto native already. And in all of these jurisdictions. And do you have to get go to market people on the ground to serve these clients or is it only you? I mean I know you're traveling 90% of your time these days or maybe 80% all around the world. Is it scalable? They have to get people on the ground.
00:22:58.065 - 00:23:33.615, Speaker B: Yeah, we do. We are expanding the team soon. Right now it's a two man show. It's myself leading a lot of the BD and customer relationships as well as Patrick, who's our head of BD in Asia prior to Agora Patrick was head of institutional sales at Paradigm, the options platform. So he knows every single trading firm in the world and so has been super helpful in building out that network and holds the fort for us in Singapore for now. But we're definitely going to need to build up our ground game as well as our developer game in the coming months and plan to do so.
00:23:36.795 - 00:24:10.109, Speaker A: Perfect. Just give me a second, I need to close the door. So we'll cut that part. The time spent so far. I just shot it and thanks for the transparency. I guess one of the follow up question I had after geographical expansion, there's definitely this geographical expansion in crypto, which means which protocol you support. I think today you support Ethereum, Avax and Swede.
00:24:10.109 - 00:24:20.075, Speaker A: That's what you mentioned inside it in the beginning of this podcast. What about the others and why protocol expansion matter in the first place?
00:24:20.575 - 00:25:12.073, Speaker B: Yeah, so native stables are much better than bridge stables for security reasons, capital efficiency reasons, and if you are a company that's building on any of these networks, you want to have a native fiat coin and be able to work directly with the issuer. And so I actually think it's a massive unlock for a lot of these chains that don't yet have a native stable and are using Raptor bridged versions. For us, we want to go where the puck is going. And so if we really believe that the future of financial services and payments is blockchain, we want to work hand in hand with some of the best organizations that are making that happen.
00:25:12.129 - 00:25:12.345, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:12.385 - 00:25:28.137, Speaker B: And so networks that have, you know, very high throughput, low finality in terms of the timing and really also like, are just professionals in every sense of the word and execute.
00:25:28.201 - 00:25:28.425, Speaker C: Right.
00:25:28.465 - 00:26:16.065, Speaker B: And so that's why, you know, we chose to work with, you know, Avalanche and the SUI team so early in our journey. There's many more chains that we're coming to natively in the next few months. We're going to have two big announcements over the next month that I think folks will be really excited about, but we want to work with those high quality teams that are pushing the frontier of the space. And Interop is a big topic as well. And so we're working with Wormhole on that as well to complement our existing native and future deployments. But you gotta be native. If you're a chain and you wanna have real businesses building on top of you, you have to have native stables.
00:26:16.065 - 00:26:33.731, Speaker B: And I think Avalanche is a great case study of they're obviously a very successful ecosystem, have billions of dollars of stables already on the chain and in defi. So one might ask, okay, well why do you need another one?
00:26:33.803 - 00:26:34.415, Speaker C: Right?
00:26:34.715 - 00:27:18.093, Speaker B: And I think the answer is that it's very clear that, you know, the future of stablecoins are, you know, regulated, institutional grade. And also that this rent seeking model that the existing incumbents have pursued is not tenable over the long term. And you need a credibly neutral player that has this open partnership model. And we really are the only one in the market that is doing that because a lot of these businesses want to capture a lot of that value back for themselves. And so we launched on Avalanche about two months ago. We've been up and to the right in terms of volume and usage. So we actually just are passing 100 million a weekly volume on Avalanche this week.
00:27:18.093 - 00:27:58.365, Speaker B: We have a few big exciting announcements around their summit, which is what I'll be going to actually in Buenos Aires. And so even if you're a large established ecosystem, we fit right in as a complement to the existing players that, that sort of, that ecosystem. And I think businesses are really demanding this. Like it's, you know, they see the tens of billions of dollars that are going to tether and circle and saying hey, you know, we're actually the ones that are driving the usage of these assets. Like we should be part of that economic network. And so that's what we want to build is this economic network where the businesses are capturing the vast majority of the value.
00:27:59.345 - 00:28:36.021, Speaker A: Right. You also talked about high throughput, very efficient, low cost blockchains, Sui Avax, I guess Ethereum and L2s that you will continue supporting. Do you see other like Solana or even Tron that, that we kind of, I remember we had this discussion. Tron is, is a massive player in the stablecoin market. 36% of stablecoin are sitting on Tron. Do you think these ecosystem could be part of the roadmap in the coming months?
00:28:36.213 - 00:28:49.215, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. I think Solana is just like outlined, right? They already have an established ecosystem, billions of stables, but you know, for every dollar that USDC generates on Salana, half that's going to coinbase, you know, who's, who's competing directly with base.
00:28:49.255 - 00:28:49.431, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:49.463 - 00:28:57.375, Speaker B: And a lot of these chains feel that, you know, base is a direct competitor to them.
00:28:57.415 - 00:28:57.567, Speaker C: Right.
00:28:57.591 - 00:29:39.835, Speaker B: And they don't like that. So like we, you know, a mantra of ours, you know, is we're never going to be competing with our customers. I'd also say to your Tron question, the chain expansion is very much part of our geographic strategy as well. I talked to you Know regulated Nigerian Exchange founder two weeks ago and I'm always trying to learn what are folks using. And I asked him what are the most active networks in Nigeria and he says everyone uses Tron or bse. It's like that's it, nothing else matters. And so if you want to be global, you have to be on a lot of these different networks that in some ways have localized users even though they're global networks.
00:29:39.835 - 00:30:04.305, Speaker B: And so that's going to be an important part of our strategy. And it's interesting too, this is why I spend a lot of time on the road is like I want to meet these people in person, I want to learn. Because if you just sort of stay trapped in your environment, right. In the United States everyone's talking about base, right? Because Coinbase is monopoly exchange in this market. Can you go to Asia, go to Africa or Latin, no one cares.
00:30:04.465 - 00:30:05.165, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:05.505 - 00:30:17.609, Speaker B: And so you really have to be open minded and meet your customers where they are, which I have. You know, we have an ability to do. It's also why we constructed our cap table the way that we did.
00:30:17.657 - 00:30:17.913, Speaker C: Right.
00:30:17.969 - 00:30:44.175, Speaker B: So you Dragonfly, let our seed round. They obviously have a large presence in Asia. We also had several different of the largest Asian exchanges as well as a friend of a firm that's close to U.S. exchange Invest, we had people like Consensys, Winter, Mute Galaxy. We wanted to build this coalition of various different partners so that we can be global from day one.
00:30:45.275 - 00:31:40.735, Speaker A: Right, that makes sense. Also very, very excited about Tron usage. I think it's definitely a big one in Africa that you mentioned. Turkey, Southeast Asia, one of the most, if not the most active chain with third world country users transacting in stablecoin every day and being exposed to the dollar. One thing you touched on was the fact that natively yielding stablecoin being centralized won't flag specifically in terms of regulatory requirements in most of these jurisdictions. What about the decentralized stablecoins? Do you see a place for decentralized stablecoin in markets? Yeah, decentralized stablecoin versus centralized. What do you think there?
00:31:41.035 - 00:31:44.135, Speaker B: Yeah, I think they ultimately serve different user Personas.
00:31:44.835 - 00:31:45.267, Speaker C: Right.
00:31:45.331 - 00:32:00.281, Speaker B: So and the way that I like to think about this is like sort of like the fixed income market is like if someone wants to buy like a Treasury bill, they'll buy a Treasury bill. If they want to buy like a junk bond because they're okay with like the risk and like the know in the reward, like they'll buy the junk bond.
00:32:00.313 - 00:32:00.433, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:00.449 - 00:32:07.209, Speaker B: And I think a lot of People kind of glom the whole stable coin universe together when they really have different users.
00:32:07.257 - 00:32:07.657, Speaker C: Right?
00:32:07.761 - 00:32:18.481, Speaker B: You with us, we're, we're one to one institutional grade and we want to be that like really highly credible, high utilization, high liquidity dollar asset.
00:32:18.593 - 00:32:19.033, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:19.129 - 00:32:23.925, Speaker B: Super flexible payment companies can use us. We're going to be using defi, use this quote token on exchanges.
00:32:24.275 - 00:32:25.015, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:25.515 - 00:33:05.377, Speaker B: I think that will always be the largest market, the centralized US fiat coin market. But I think decentralized stables are great products and serve a different user Persona who may want additional risk or to not be touching the banking system in some way. My co founder, Drake, one of my co founders, Drake was actually the lead dev at frax. So we work very closely with the FRAX team and I think there is absolutely a need for these different types of models. Just like how in sort of the fixed income world you have all these different types of products that have different compositions underneath.
00:33:05.441 - 00:33:05.953, Speaker C: Right.
00:33:06.089 - 00:33:59.557, Speaker B: So all of our assets are in overnight reverse repo or very short dated U.S. treasury bills. But with decentralized stables like you can have sort of a mix and match like maybe you have and you'll see this, you'll have AUSD backing some decentralized stables as well as maybe like USDE or like other different types of CDP or structured products. And if users want to be holding sort of dollar denominated assets but have like natively higher yield, like decentralized stables are the best product for that. And the reason I think centralized stables aren't a good product for that is because you know you can't be interacting with the banking system and pay non kyc to individuals like that doesn't fly. And even when with Mika you've seen this start to play out, right? They say okay, you have the centralized stables, you can't pay yield or interest to anyone. And it's very clear.
00:33:59.557 - 00:34:06.197, Speaker B: But they sort of left a little window open for these decentralized providers that are innovating in a sandbox.
00:34:06.261 - 00:34:06.821, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:06.973 - 00:34:25.355, Speaker B: And so I think if you're looking for higher risk or yield opportunities, these decentralized stables are a really good opportunity or vector to get that. But I think centralized stables will not be in most global markets.
00:34:25.975 - 00:34:26.599, Speaker A: Right?
00:34:26.727 - 00:34:27.635, Speaker B: No, I agree.
00:34:28.695 - 00:35:24.785, Speaker A: And of course with tokens, program and more DEFI and pure crypto usage at your risk having higher rewards. But for most of these day to day usage, having a stable, institutional scalable stablecoin makes a lot of sense. But there's another category in the market that we see emerging are securities tokenized or real world assets. As they say, how do you see this market evolving Regarding the two categories that we mentioned, centralized tables and decentralized ones. Yeah. Is it something also Agora could be close to or even launched their own version in the future?
00:35:25.405 - 00:36:08.647, Speaker B: Yeah, I think this market is even earlier innings than stables. I think the market for these types of products today are primarily crypto users. So it's a very small market to be going after. There's a lot of things that we're actually doing working with these tokenized treasury issuers which we'll announce either later this year or early next because we're non us, we're uniquely able to serve. So we want to be working with all of them and be like that interoperable stable between them as like this market continues to grow. So that's sort of how we view the market. I think you'll start to see these institutional grade yield assets.
00:36:08.647 - 00:36:49.225, Speaker B: Right. Yield products like tokenized Treasuries really start to take over as collateral on some of these centralized exchange venues over the coming years as folks get the institutional parties get more comfortable with them. And we want to be that interoperable stable, right. Where you can sell 50 million of USYC or Biddle into AuSD 24 7, you know, whether you're on BYBIT or Deribit or wherever. And so I think this is, you know, one of the next big market movers. But I still think it's early days and moving really slow. I don't see tokenized funds really taking off for another four to five years.
00:36:49.225 - 00:37:40.211, Speaker B: And the reason for that is because you need for them to be 10x better than, you know, the existing tokenized treasury products on the nas, you know, on the New York Stock Exchange you need to have all the banks, custodians, prime brokers and you know, market participants comfortable interacting with these products at scale. For that step one, you need regulation. We don't really have that in the United States in a clear way. That is fostering experimentation with this. So you just, you know, a lot of the banks up until recently were unable to really custody crypto assets on behalf of their clients. And it gave, which you may know well, Coinbase, effectively a monopoly on the ETF market.
00:37:40.283 - 00:37:40.491, Speaker C: Right.
00:37:40.523 - 00:38:08.435, Speaker B: Which is like a bit ridiculous. And so you need these players comfortable interacting with these assets. They're not there yet. Uh, so I think that takes a few years. But once this starts to happen, I think you're really going to see a dramatic inflection in the, in the usage of these assets. Um, and so I think the Market's still small today, but it'll be enormous in 15, 20 years. But we still got another like five issues until that starts to take off, I think in a, in a meaningful way.
00:38:08.435 - 00:38:21.349, Speaker B: Because you know, even today, you know, there's a couple, I think there's a couple billion in tokenized treasuries, I guess teeny relative to the stablecoin market and it's even tinier relative to the traditional tokenized. You're in the traditional treasury market.
00:38:21.397 - 00:38:21.917, Speaker C: Right.
00:38:22.061 - 00:38:23.865, Speaker B: So we're not there yet.
00:38:24.845 - 00:38:43.785, Speaker A: Right. But you're preparing for this market by building bridges between all these real world assets so that you are the stable coin that link them. Or at least you can move from a real world asset tokenized treasury position in exchange to Agora very easily, one way or another.
00:38:44.465 - 00:39:15.619, Speaker B: That's right. And we want to again be credibly neutral with all the different asset managers, whether they're crypto native or established ones. We're working actually with both some established ones on the banking side as well as traditional asset managers, the Franklin Templetons of the world as well as some of the crypto native ones. And then we just want to be that credibly neutral interop layer and help actually facilitate the usage of these products.
00:39:15.787 - 00:39:16.139, Speaker C: Right.
00:39:16.187 - 00:39:43.805, Speaker B: Because one of the challenges today with them being used as collateral exchanges is they rely on the traditional banking system. So you can't off ramp them 24 7. But what you could do is maybe off ramp to stables 24 7. And so there's ways that will help facilitate that without credit. And that's, that's what I'm really excited about. And as they come with additional products to market, we want to work with all of them. Again, like it's important to be credibly neutral.
00:39:43.805 - 00:39:49.485, Speaker B: And so that's how we're going to sort of leverage the growth of that market.
00:39:50.345 - 00:40:13.945, Speaker A: That makes sense. That's smart. Very smart. I guess two last questions for me. First, what is the end game for Agora? How do you see the company in five, 10 years? What will you be building? Which customers you will be serving? Where do you see Agora and Digital Dollar that you have today? But any other products or services that you might offer?
00:40:15.405 - 00:40:19.421, Speaker B: Yeah, ultimately we want to be the most liquid global digital dollar.
00:40:19.533 - 00:40:20.141, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:20.293 - 00:40:42.513, Speaker B: So we're going up against two very large incumbents. It's not the easiest goal, but it's a lofty one. And we also want to make access to the dollar easier and cheaper for everyone. A large part of our mission isn't just servicing crypto but servicing people that have been left behind by traditional service systems in their own country.
00:40:42.649 - 00:40:43.305, Speaker C: Right.
00:40:43.465 - 00:41:20.169, Speaker B: In Mexico, you have 50% of the population is unbanked or underbanked. And it's because many of people in these different countries either there's not good rule of law or they're bad customers. And by bad, I mean the banks say, hey, we don't want you because we're not going to make enough money off you. And that's ridiculous. If you don't have the freedom to transact, like you don't have freedom at all, in my opinion. And as a fiat coin, we can leverage the blockchain to be that bank for all these people. And so that's an important market that we're going to go after.
00:41:20.169 - 00:42:26.255, Speaker B: I think in future products you'll see us leaning into infrastructure more as the issuer. A lot of things sort of flow from you, right? You've seen a large stablecoin continue to raise off ramping fees and that affects everyone downstream, whether it's the infra providers or the businesses themselves. Like, we always want to be the easiest and cheapest option for these businesses. And so we'll start to lean into that a bit more. You know, ultimately we're sort of going after Visa's market like this global open network. And you know, we're nowhere near big enough to even remotely, you know, be in a conversation with Visa today. But I do hope that in five to 10 years, you know, we can be going to merchants and saying, hey, like do you not want to pay 200, 300 basis points anymore? Like, what if you only pay like 50 basis points or 25 basis points? And so that's, that's how we're thinking about it.
00:42:26.255 - 00:42:33.115, Speaker B: And yeah, making as big of an effort to get there as fast as possible.
00:42:33.935 - 00:42:57.855, Speaker A: Right. I mean, that's very ambitious. Tether Visa, if you hear us, Gore is going after your business. And that makes complete sense today. 3 or 4 or 5 or 8% on and off renting to access this tablecoin. It's ridiculous. I agree.
00:42:57.855 - 00:43:40.855, Speaker A: And once, by the way, you are on chain, this fee costs you less than 0.1%. So I guess there will be other business models emerging. And we think actually the rewards business model is an interesting one because you might have a saving account if you not pay. And if you start to move money around, then you get out of the saving position. Maybe. Last question on your view of the market, crypto in general, what excites you outside stablecoin, outside Digital dollar that you haven't seen maybe when you started entering the space about 10 years ago.
00:43:42.515 - 00:45:36.661, Speaker B: I think infrastructure is finally in a good place. There's not one, but dozens of like really strong high throughput, low latency blockchains and I think we're ready for the scale. Like you've seen even this you this week with Avalanche is the off the grid, right? Like millions of users like just all of a sudden like started using Avalanche behind the scenes and it's working right? Like with Suise, Solana, like Mantle, like there's like all of these different networks that can service very large, a very large user base and users of activity. So I feel like the infrastructure is finally in a good place. Something that like I, you know, beyond stablecoins and sort of the adjacent things that we're touching that I'm excited about is the ability for users and individuals to just like use chains as their bank, right through like applications like AAVE or Morpho and like the different companies that are pulling this together in all one interface for like a consumer, right? Where you know, in the back end they're you know, let's say plugged into aave, right? And Morpho and it's like okay, if you want to save like 5% or 10%, you know, deposit AUSD into these, like earn vaults, right? And then oh like they're also hooked up to an on and off ramp provider. So if you want to cash out to dollars or euro or Mexican peso, whatever, you can do that too. Like I think like that is going to be an explosion of consumer finance is like you're going to have these fully blockchain based neo banks which is going to be awesome.
00:45:36.661 - 00:46:36.185, Speaker B: I would love to be a consumer of one but I live in the United States so it's a little bit tough. They mostly geofence us. I still think I can buy ETH via Metamask, but that's the really cool stuff to me because that is the holy grail of an open permissionless financial system and like making it really easy for consumers to just use it and like not necessarily feel like they're interacting with something super complicated or crypto native, right? It's like, oh this is just like my bank, right? And like the settlement layer is Eth or Avalanche or Solana or Sui or whenever it is like, you know, Morpho is like ARAV is like the lending market and you can swap assets on Uniswap or now maybe Unichain. Like it's like that and bundling that up into a really comprehensive and user friendly experience is to me very exciting.
00:46:36.845 - 00:47:21.735, Speaker A: Interesting and that's definitely what we're trying to build with scale defi aggregating all of these opportunities and make it easily accessible, easily integratable and so that the platform can monetize it on chain. Yeah and even thinking of you know you have you you have a native Token Eth, Solana or others that you can you know put on AAVE and Morpho and and get stables as you know that that you borrow on the other side of the spectrum and then pay with the credit card in the real world whatever service of good you you want to pay. That's that world seems very exciting to be and not completely far away. If you agree.
00:47:23.505 - 00:47:24.965, Speaker B: I think it's almost here.
00:47:25.665 - 00:47:45.725, Speaker A: Right. Thanks Nick for your time. It was amazing to have you on the podcast and yeah, I hope to see you soon somewhere in the world. Maybe in Hong Kong in a couple of weeks in Latam, I don't know. But congrats on what you're building and thanks again for being among us.
00:47:46.145 - 00:47:47.345, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you for having me.
