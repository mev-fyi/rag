00:00:07.130 - 00:00:34.120, Speaker A: Hello and welcome to the latest episode of Kinghodevru on Eigenve edition. I'm Edgar, protocol specialist at Kiern, the leading enterprise grade staking platform, and I'll be your host for today. Today we're very happy to have Amrit CoO at Atlayer, the company behind the ads iflayer. Amrit, hope you're doing well. Could you introduce yourself?
00:00:35.690 - 00:01:05.418, Speaker B: So, okay, thank you very much for inviting me. So my background is, I guess, a typical engineer's background. So I studied mathematics in India, and then I went to Paris. So I went to ecological technique. I did my engineering at equal polt technique for four years. And then in my fourth year, I left Paris and I went to Gronobe. There's this engineering school called NCMag there, and it's an engineering school that people go to for your fourth year if you're polytechnic.
00:01:05.418 - 00:01:31.590, Speaker B: So I went there. I studied computer science for the last, I would say, three years of my engineering, and then I did a PhD in computer science in Garobla. And this was the time when blockchain was becoming kind of interesting topic for academic researchers. People were studying computer science. They were starting to look into blockchain at that time. Before that, it was more like, hey, it's a bitcoin thing, it's for developers. This may be interesting thing, but it's not for academic interest.
00:01:31.590 - 00:02:17.046, Speaker B: But that was changing in around 2016 or 2015, around the time when Ethereum was being developed. Right? And so I was also looking in, or my colleagues were looking in bitcoin and blockchain in general. And I felt like maybe I should go and do some work in the blockchain space as well, because it sounded very exciting. However, when I asked my advisor if I could go and work in a blockchain kind of project, the answer that I got was, you're funded by a certain project and you have to kind of work in that area. And so I couldn't work in the crypto space at that time, but I was finishing my PhD very soon. So this was around 2016. So I finished my PhD, and then I was looking for a job as a researcher in the blockchain space.
00:02:17.046 - 00:02:43.674, Speaker B: And this was the time when ICOs were happening. So this was outside 2016, 2017. And I guess there were two key countries or areas where a lot of these crypto projects were emerging from, right? One was Switzerland. A lot of projects were actually doing fundraise or setting up their foundations in Switzerland, and the other place was Singapore. I felt maybe I should go back to Asia. So I went to Singapore. And then I joined a local university in Singapore.
00:02:43.674 - 00:03:12.040, Speaker B: It was called National University of Singapore. And this was the place where Vitalik used to come, by the way, at that time, quite frequently, he used to do sessions to explain. So he was doing this, I guess, grassroots marketing at that time. So basically onboarding developers into the Ethereum vision and Ethereum ecosystem. I remember there was a guy in our lab called Lloyd. He was one of the founders of Kyber Network. So this was one of the first, earliest Dexes in the Ethereum space.
00:03:12.040 - 00:03:51.798, Speaker B: So I think everyone in the space in the lab were working on crypto space in the blockchain space. And so when I joined in, I wanted to work in blockchain. So I asked my advisor and said, hey, can we work on something in crypto? And he said, unfortunately, there's nothing interesting to left to do anymore in the crypto space. Why don't we do machine learning? I was quite disappointed because everyone else in the lab was working on blockchain. I was the only one who was kind of assigned. It was kind of the new guy, and the new guy is supposed to do something new, and that was supposed to be machine learning anyway. So I persisted, though, and I kind of kept pushing and checking and talking to other colleagues in my lab.
00:03:51.798 - 00:04:34.834, Speaker B: And eventually my advisor gave up and said, hey, there's this interesting project called Monero. This was, again, 2017. And Monero was, I would say, probably at that time, there were three cryptocurrencies which were privacy preserving. One was Dash Monero and Zcash, mainly three at the time. And Monero was becoming quite popular, especially for people who were transacting on the dark web. And so my advisor said, why don't you go and look at Monero and see if there's anything interesting to do there? And so me and some of my colleagues in the lab, and we had a french intern, by the way, so he was also from ecompany. So he was doing the last year in a foreign country.
00:04:34.834 - 00:04:59.420, Speaker B: And so me and m and some of the other colleagues joined hands, and we started working on Monero. And we published a paper on Monero that showed that about 95% to 98% of transactions that happened on Monero were not actually very private. Anyway, so that was my entry into the blockchain space. So I studied Monero white papers first, and then went to go and stand how bitcoin worked, and then, of course, ethereum. So, yeah, that was, I guess, my journey into the crypto space.
00:05:01.390 - 00:05:18.178, Speaker A: Great, so you started with Monero, then bitcoin and now you're building Adnair, which is simplify a bit, something that services roll ups. Could you remind the audience what is a roll up?
00:05:18.344 - 00:05:48.038, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. So roll up is basically an off chain system that attempts to scale a base layer. So consider for example, Ethereum. It has a TPS of maybe 20 maximum tpS per second. And so if you attempt to transact, let's say more than 20 or even close to that per second, that creates spike in gas fees. And that affects everyone, right? Simply because it's a shared network for everyone. And so one again, Ethereum foundation and the researchers in the core Ethereum team that is trying to scale Ethereum at the base layer.
00:05:48.038 - 00:06:27.810, Speaker B: But it's also kind of well understood that as a base layer, it's going to be very hard to scale a blockchain like a layer one. And so the idea is to basically build off chain systems that would execute transactions on behalf of users. And then ethereum as a base layer will verify whether this system is operating correctly. And that's exactly what a rule up is. So for example, if you take arbitrum optimism, or Zksync, or polygon CDK, they all operate in a model where you have a server or a set of nodes that are called sequences. So you as a user, you will take your transactions and you will send your transactions to the sequencer. Sequencer will execute your transactions.
00:06:27.810 - 00:07:14.466, Speaker B: So it will order your transactions form a block, and then it will execute the block, and then it will put all the transactions on Ethereum, and it will say, hey, if you execute all those transactions in this order, you will get this output. So this will be the state of the system, and then anyone can go and verify whether that state is actually valid. And so nowadays you have two main ways in which you can build roll ups. One is where you have fraud proof. So basically when the sequencer puts a state on Ethereum and puts the transaction data on Ethereum, anyone in the system can actually check whether this is actually valid. And so if you feel like something has been posted or committed that's wrong, you can go and challenge. So you have to basically say that, hey, I have detected that this transaction has not been processed correctly.
00:07:14.466 - 00:07:45.806, Speaker B: And here's the proof. So that's what's called optimistic roller, where you don't check every single time you check, only when you believe something has gone wrong. So that's optimistic roll up. The second model is what we call what's called ZK roll up, or a validity proof model where basically for every single transaction that you're putting on chain, you're also creating a proof that says, hey, this transaction was indeed processed correctly. And here's the proof. And that proof gets verified by Ethereum network. So at a high level, rollups are basically an off chain system that execute transactions on behalf of users.
00:07:45.806 - 00:07:50.370, Speaker B: And Ethereum basically verifies that that off chain system is behaving and operating correctly.
00:07:54.390 - 00:08:08.630, Speaker A: Okay, super clear. So in this context, could you explain a bit what is add layer and what add layer is trying to achieve using eigen layer?
00:08:09.130 - 00:09:03.210, Speaker B: Of course. So the thing about roll ups is that when you build a roll up attached to a pastry like Ethereum, you are actually moving execution out of Ethereum, right? So you are saying, hey, all executions that used to happen, Ethereum will not happen on Ethereum directly, it will happen on the rotator. Now, when you move execution out of Ethereum, you can do interesting things because you're no longer limited by Ethereum's, let's say, smart contract, let's say the runtime environment that Ethereum offers. For example, let's say if you want to have a new opcode, for example, or if you need to have customize your runtime in some way, you could do that through roll ups. So for example, people today, they're building move VM people, move based roll ups, people are building solar VM based roll ups. You can imagine all sorts of new and new things that you can build and innovate on the roll up side. That doesn't need to happen.
00:09:03.210 - 00:09:50.950, Speaker B: That cannot happen on Ethereum. So what that has done is people have started to build application specific roll ups. So imagine you are building a fully origin game, and your game contract is so huge that you simply cannot deploy that on Ethereum because Ethereum has certain constraints on how large your contract can be. And so what you could do is you could say, hey, I'm going to build a roll up and I'll put my contract on this roll up, and I can customize my roll up in a way that allows me to deploy a larger contract. And so this is one example of how roll ups can allow you to not just scale Ethereum, but also customize Ethereum in some ways. So you're not directly customizing Ethereum, but you're customizing your own environment in which you can run your contracts. And so basically, that has led to this birth of a lot of application specific roll ups.
00:09:50.950 - 00:10:43.482, Speaker B: And this was the idea that we started back in 2021 where we felt like, hey, app chains like Cosmos are great, but it's quite painful to go and bootstrap an app chain like Cosmos, because you have to go and find hundreds of validators, you have to incentivize them. And if your token does not do well, the validators have no incentive to continue and operate the network. Or if your network doesn't do enough transactions, you're basically paying a lot of money for free to these validators, which are actually not really doing much because the transactions are not there. And so a good model would be something like app roll ups, because all you need is one sequencer and that can still process transactions, because in the end, ethereum is the one that secures your rollups. You don't need hundreds of validators, right? So your cost to bootstrap a network becomes much cheaper. And so allclair had this vision of app specific chains will become big. And I think we are seeing that today.
00:10:43.482 - 00:11:37.420, Speaker B: And one, because all these prominent rollups like optimism, arbitrum, ZK, sync, Polygon, they're all building their own stacks now. So now you have op stack, you have arbitrum orbit, you have ZK Stack, you have Polygon, CDK. And what they basically try to do is they are saying, hey, now that you have optimism from, let's say, arbitrum and Zksig, you can actually build an app specific instance of these chains for your specific application. So you can take Opstack and say, build your own chain or build your own roll up on which you can go and run your application. So in the first stage, or here does one thing, it makes it easier for people to deploy these app statistic roll ups. So we offer this RAs service, roll up as service. And the goal is if, let's say you are a game builder and you do not understand how sequences work, you don't want to understand how data availability works, we can come to us and we will run and manage a roll up for you.
00:11:37.420 - 00:12:07.940, Speaker B: So that's first part. The second part is many of these roll up the way they exist today, they're not very decentralized. For example, if you look at optimism or arbitrum or even CDK, all of them operate with a single sequencer, even though having a single sequencer is not a huge security risk. But there are liveness issues with the sequencers. For example, if the sequencer goes down, it's quite painful to go and get your transaction processed. I mean, there are caveats around. Yes, you could still go and deposit, send your transaction to the L1.
00:12:07.940 - 00:12:55.410, Speaker B: But in case of arbitrary, for example, there's a 24 hours delay, and it complicates a bit of users life. And so it's good to have decentralized sequencing in built with a roll up. And what we're doing right now with Eigen layer is that we have proposed this idea of what we call restake rollups. So firstly, we take opstack, arbitram, orbit, or any of the roll up stacks that are out there, and we combine that with Eigen layer's restaking mechanism to build, for example, decentralized sequencing. So the simple way to understand this would be if you are building an op stack roll up, and you say, hey, I want to have five sequences, sort of just having one. And you would say, if you want to become one of my sequences, you have to bring a certain amount of economic collateral. So you would say, if you bring $10 million worth of economic collateral, then you are allowed to become one of my sequences.
00:12:55.410 - 00:13:32.654, Speaker B: And then enough people deposit these collateral, they're allowed. They would eventually become your sequence, they would operate your role. So basically this whole thing runs as an ABS, which is the short for actively validated system. And so service, where basically you would say, hey, my sequencer network is an AbS. And if you want to become an operator for that abs, you have to bring an asset to secure this abs. And this could come from St ETH or any of the assets that Igale supports. And as long as you stake that through Igale or restake that through Igale, you can become and secure the system.
00:13:32.654 - 00:13:40.690, Speaker B: And so that's how basically orgler operates. We offer restaking rollups, and that comes Igale's restaking mechanism with roll ups.
00:13:44.740 - 00:14:02.820, Speaker A: Okay, fantastic. And so if I had to sum up, there is one side, which is the restaked roll ups. So everything that you're doing there and one other side, that's the RASM, the roll up as a service. And my question is, are they both leveraging eigen layer?
00:14:03.580 - 00:14:54.330, Speaker B: So it's kind of like Ras today is centralized. So when you go and talk to RAS service, RAS vendor will go and run your sequencer for you. Right? And the ABS component, the restaked roller component, is more of a decentralized version, version of RAS. So imagine saying, hey, I don't want to have a RAS vendor, and I want to get my committee involved. So, okay, the problem with Ras is, one, if you're talking to, if you're using a RAS service, one, you are centralized number one. Number two is the Ras vendor has no incentive to let you go. So, for example, if, let's say you're using a RAS service and you want to at some point in the future want to bring the entire service in house, you can't do that because there's no incentive for RAS vendor to let it go because they will basically lose the.
00:14:54.330 - 00:15:39.844, Speaker B: So it's not in their best interest to actually allow people to basically move away from Ras. But as a builder, you actually want that, because what might happen is if you stay with the RAS vendor, you may have signed a contract with them and the contract says, hey, you have to use our services for maybe one year. And then at the end of one year, if you go and reach out to them and say, hey guys, we want to renew the contract, they would say, hey, yeah, now you have to pay double the fee that you're paying previously. So there's a platform risk of using a RAS service, even though in principle you can go and move from one Ras vendor to another one. Actually it's not so straightforward. Right. And Ras vendors do not make it easy for you to go.
00:15:39.844 - 00:16:18.930, Speaker B: And so it would be good to have some sort of a decentralized service that allows you to either bring everything in house or make it more decentralized where you can go and get your committee involved. So imagine today you are using a rasp service with a single node or single vendor compared to, let's say, you have, let's say a five node or six nodes or ten node system where you're asking, let's say one of the validators in the ethereum ecosystem to come and operate your roll up. Imagine figment and some of the big guys in the market who could come and operate Europe. So you get a lot of ecosystem, I guess, benefit and marketing benefits of engaging your broader community. So I would say ABS is more of a decentralized version of a RAS system.
00:16:21.380 - 00:16:44.650, Speaker A: All right. Okay. And so I think you're describing many, many things. Are you describing one big AVs or are you describing multiple different AVs? And my other question is, does that mean that operators and restakers will have the choice which set of AVSSs within the ones you mentioned to support?
00:16:44.960 - 00:17:18.256, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically in the restake framework, we offer three kinds of AVss. So basically there are three main products. One is what we call squad, which is basically decentralized sequencing. So you would say, hey, I want to have five sequences, and this squad will basically act as an AVs for decentralized sequencing. So that's number one. Number two is what we call vital, which is an ABS for verification and the reason you want verification is because if you look at arbitrum today, you have these nodes that check whether the sequences are behaving correctly.
00:17:18.256 - 00:17:50.844, Speaker B: And if not, they would do fraud proofs, right? They would challenge. It'd be good to bake that system directly into application specific rules. The idea is, once you start a rollup, you will have these nodes that will verify the system for you and will check if everything is operating correctly. And the third one is what we call Mac, which is an ABS for faster finality. So it's kind of like when you send your transaction to sequester today, they give you this kind of pinky promising, hey, I have seen your transaction. At some point in the future, I will put those transaction on Ethereum. But that guarantee is very weak.
00:17:50.844 - 00:18:24.952, Speaker B: And so the idea is, can you bring economic guarantees behind it to offer finality? So this is what Mac does. So, at a high level, there are three different OEBs, one column squad, vital and Mac. Now, the thing is, each one of them can be dedicated to each specific roll up. So you could have, let's say, a gaming chain. A gaming roll up will have its own squad, Mac and vital. Then, let's say, defi project will have its own squared Mac and vital, and so on. So, in principle, there will be many, many of these AVSSs per roll up, basically.
00:18:24.952 - 00:18:52.230, Speaker B: And then operators will pick and decide which avs to support. For example, there could be a roll up that's really big. So imagine tomorrow, uniswap does a roll up. Let's say, for example, everyone in the space would like to serve that roll up, right? And so it will also depend on which operators decide to serve which roll up. Because maybe, depending on the. It may depend on the risk, it may depend on the reward. It may also depend on the publicity and how big that project is or how big that roll up is.
00:18:56.440 - 00:19:17.720, Speaker A: Okay, and is it also possible for roll ups to only pick specific pieces of these three verticals? And where is the focus of ad layer? What do you think is the most valuable thing that Adler brings for the rollup ecosystem out of those three?
00:19:17.790 - 00:19:38.416, Speaker B: So, yeah, the answer to your first question was yes. They are all built as a modular component, and so you can pick and choose which one you want. So, roll up would come and say, hey, I only want decentralized sequences because that's what's most important to them. So they don't have to use vital and Mac if they don't want. So, yeah, that's the first component. And. Sorry, I forgot the second question.
00:19:38.416 - 00:19:39.472, Speaker B: What was the second question? Sorry?
00:19:39.526 - 00:19:47.300, Speaker A: The second question was actually, which one of those three do you think brings the most value to the world of ecosystem?
00:19:47.640 - 00:20:49.796, Speaker B: I think they're all equally valuable depending on who you talk to. So, for example, if you are, let's say, building a DeFi project, you want to make sure that a DeFi project may have a large TVL. So imagine building a perps or something of that kind, which brings a lot of TVL in your roll up, and you want to make sure that that TBL is secured. And so if you have a sequencer, you want to make sure that the sequencer, if it posts transaction data on Ethereum or somewhere those steat are actually verified properly, that may not be so interesting for someone like, let's say, gaming company, right? Gaming company may not have a huge TVL, so they don't care that much about security. What they do care about is latency. They want to make sure that when I send up a transaction to this roll up, my transaction gets finality quite quickly. And so a faster finality would be ideal, because if today, if you go and use ethereum as your finality layer, it will take you something between twelve to 15 minutes to actually get your transaction finalized.
00:20:49.796 - 00:21:08.190, Speaker B: And you cannot wait for that. And so I think it depends on which sector you're targeting. I would say gaming companies would be more inclined towards faster finality, or D five projects would be more inclined towards something that gives them more security for the assets that are held there.
00:21:11.460 - 00:21:50.484, Speaker A: Okay, fantastic. And that's actually a good point, because my next question is around what are the role of that you're currently working with, talking to? And how do your Avs usually compare with, for example, the competition? Like for example, for decentralized sequencing, there is espresso, and there might be other AVSs or totally different chains that might compete with you on those verticals.
00:21:50.612 - 00:22:27.788, Speaker B: Yeah. So let me ask the second question first, because it's more pertinent, and then I'll come back to the examples of which clients and we are working with. So, decentralized sequencing comes in many shapes and forms. And as you said, one form is like what espresso offers, or AStri offers, which is called shared sequencing. And the model in which espresso works is you as a user, you will take your transactions and you will send that to espresso. And espresso network will then order your transactions. And once they have ordered the transaction, they will send it back to you and say, hey, we have run a consensus protocol on those transactions.
00:22:27.788 - 00:23:33.036, Speaker B: And here is an order that we propose, and then the rollup node will go and process transactions. So for example, let's say in a RAS context, RaS provider will take the transactions from the RPC, it will send those transactions to the Espresso network specific network will return that back, and the Rasputa will then execute those transactions. Now, there are several things, several differences between a decentralized sequence in which AVs operates like squad, and the way espresso operates. One difference is that when you're a roll up and when you want to use espresso, you do not control who becomes your sequencer. Espresso, the whole network is basically your sequencer in some way. And so if, for example, if, let's say if you're a gaming company and if you wanted Ubisoft or Bandai or some of your partners to become your sequencer, you cannot do that because Espresso has its own way of onboarding validators and sequencers for your rollup, right? So that's the first thing. The second thing is you do not get to decide the sequencing policy that will be applied on your roll up.
00:23:33.036 - 00:24:13.496, Speaker B: So for example, espresso validators may have this policy of hey, let's go and maximize Mav for ourselves. So let's go and do sandwich attacks. Let's go and do all sorts of things that we could imagine and let's extract as much value as we can from end user transactions. Maybe this is the policy that you may not like as a roller builder. You could say, look, my users are of utmost importance to us and we would not like any sandwich attacks happening on our users. And so you cannot control the sequencing policy in your case, right? Because you are basically using espresso as a shared network. So espresso will have a common policy for all the ruleups that are attached to them.
00:24:13.496 - 00:24:46.876, Speaker B: While when you're using decentralized sequencing in the ABS model, you control the sequencer. So you say, hey, this is my friend, this is my ecosystem partner, this is my custodian, or this is my gaming partner. I want these five people to become my sequencer. If you don't like them, you can kick them out. So maybe through a governance mechanism, maybe through some mechanism you could say, hey, every year I'm going to select five people and if I don't like them, I'm going to kick them out maybe after a year through governance mechanism. So you literally control who becomes your AVs operator in the end. You also control the sequencing policy that you want to impose.
00:24:46.876 - 00:25:35.596, Speaker B: So you could say, hey, if you want to become my operator in my abs, you have to abide by this policy, which is, let's say minimize MeV, not maximize MeV. And if any operator is detected that they're actually sandwiching or front running users, then they will be kicked out. And these, you don't have that flexibility if you use something like espresso. So I would say that's the kind of main benefit or difference between what we are doing versus what espresso does. There's another, I guess, similarity with another kind of project abs, which is called the witness team, where basically what they do is they operate what they call watchtower network. So basically it's a network of nodes that observes roll ups and checks whether anything is detected as malicious. And what they do is then they will raise an alarm.
00:25:35.596 - 00:26:06.076, Speaker B: They will say, hey, your SQL server is not behaving correctly. Here's something that we noticed, but washtower network generally does not go and does challenge. It doesn't do anything beyond that. It only raises alerts. It doesn't do beyond that. And what we do with vital is you actually can go and do a challenge and you could say, hey, I have seen this, but here's the proof that I've seen this, and here's the proof that you cannot contest. So it goes a little bit step further than just watching the network and actually doing and taking actions at over there.
00:26:06.076 - 00:26:38.570, Speaker B: And also our EVs vital can also apply to ZK rollups as well. It doesn't necessarily have to be optimistic. So I would say these are the main differences with something like espresso as a decentralized sequencing and something like wash tower network that also does a witness chain that offers this wash tower service. Now, coming back to the second question, or the first question, I suppose, which was, which are the partners that we are working with? Overall, we have spoken to almost 200 clients so far. Many of them are already signed up with our RAS service. So at the moment, our ABS is still being built. It's not fully ready yet.
00:26:38.570 - 00:27:11.520, Speaker B: So most of the clients that we have, they are currently using our RAS services, and the idea is to basically transition them to AVs format. Once that's ready. We have gaming companies like, there's a gaming company in France, by the way, called commerce. They have their own orbit chain called cosmic. And this is a chain that will have its own gaming game built on that. We have, I think, about ten other gaming companies working in Asia and beyond. There's another called, I think it's a belgian one called punishing monsters.
00:27:11.520 - 00:27:43.288, Speaker B: So we have seen quite a bit of demand across gaming. I would say about 90% of our clients still come from gaming sector. Simply because gaming is one area where people have felt that if you want to offer good gaming experience to end users, you have to build your own roll up. And so that's kind of reason why we have seen quite a bit of demand from gaming companies. We're also seeing a lot of defi nowadays, especially on the derivative side of things. So people building options, perps and so on. We also work very closely with a gaming company called Double Jump Tokyo, in Japan.
00:27:43.288 - 00:28:00.332, Speaker B: So they have some of the best, I guess, IPS, web two style IPs developed by Bandai and some of the best web two gaming companies. And the idea for them is to basically take some of those gaming IPs and convert them into Web 2.5 or web3 games.
00:28:00.476 - 00:28:03.010, Speaker A: Sorry, we're losing you.
00:28:03.940 - 00:28:05.200, Speaker B: I'm sorry. Can you hear me now?
00:28:05.270 - 00:28:11.110, Speaker A: Sorry, we lost you for a couple of seconds. Could you just rewind a little bit?
00:28:13.160 - 00:28:34.140, Speaker B: Yeah. So, basically, we're also working with a gaming company called Double Jump Tokyo. They're based out of Japan. And they have some biggest IPs from Bandai and Ubisoft and the others. And the idea for them is to take those IPs and convert that into a Web 2.5, web3 games. So you have one of the exclusive partners to offer those games to be on the roll up.
00:28:34.140 - 00:28:44.160, Speaker B: So, yeah, I would say 90% of our companies, of our clients are still using RAs, but we plan to convert them to roll ups. And they're mostly gaming companies. And some of them are actually now building DeFi products as well.
00:28:44.230 - 00:29:02.150, Speaker A: Fantastic. So my follow up question, Amrit, is you have a very big ecosystem of rollups. When do you think that IPO will be ready to launch its abscess on Eigen layer to support these?
00:29:02.600 - 00:29:21.488, Speaker B: Yes, and we're planning to actually follow Eigen layer itself. So, Eigen layer. We're waiting for Eigenve's minute to go live. Because I think it'd be risky to go mainet on our side before Eigen layer goes main. Even though in principle you could do that. But I don't think it's a good idea to do that. And so we basically will be following Eigen layer.
00:29:21.488 - 00:29:32.990, Speaker B: So I believe it'd be sometime in Q two. Again, as I said, it depends on iglan, but we're targeting Q two internally to be prepared when the eigle goes minute. We will go minute right after that.
00:29:34.400 - 00:29:39.280, Speaker A: Okay. You'll be launching in conjunction with Eigenda.
00:29:39.620 - 00:30:01.960, Speaker B: Yeah, so eigenda, and generally speaking, all the eigle, let's say contracts going minute ready, right? I mean, even though the contracts are live, we still kind of need the, I get the blessings and stamp from Eigenve team say, okay, these contracts are ready to be used in production. And eigend, I think, probably, may, probably will go alongside AVs contracts, I suppose.
00:30:04.300 - 00:30:53.640, Speaker A: Well, we're definitely excited for all of these Avs coming to market. My next set of questions would be around revenue. So we're trying to represent the risk takers and all of the Avs that you have mentioned, all of the services that you're going to be providing with roll up. How can a restaker think of the revenue potential for all of this? And Agile is going to attract a lot of staked economic security. So it's always very challenging for us to understand if all of the revenue that the AVs would be generating will be able to provide meaningful added rewards for risk takers, of course.
00:30:53.710 - 00:31:39.044, Speaker B: So I think there are many ways or many forms in which the revenue or the incentives will come. So one is, let's say you have a roll up that actually generates a lot of revenue itself. So for example, today, if you look at arbitrum, arbitrum generates a lot of revenue from sequencing fee, right? So imagine similar roll up that comes out and it generates revenue from sequencing fee. And the basic idea is user puts, let's say the gas fee is one dollars. So $1 is what the sequencer has to pay to Ethereum to secure that transaction, basically. And so sequencer will basically charge something on top of that, and that basically will go back as sequencing revenue. So the first thing would be sequencing revenue that would be shared with the restakers.
00:31:39.044 - 00:32:05.440, Speaker B: Because if you become an ABS for, let's say, decentralized sequencing, you would have access to the sequencing revenue. So that's the first thing. The second thing would be we also have our own token. So that will also be used to incentivize people to come and serve these abs. So that's number two. The third one would be the token that the roll up may have. Right? So let's say I'm building a gaming roll up, and I'm asking a certain operator to come and serve as a sequencer for my roll up.
00:32:05.440 - 00:32:35.716, Speaker B: Then I would have to provide some incentive for them. And so there will be some incentive that comes from the DAP token itself. And then potentially, if Eigen layer team is generous, there could be potentially some incentive from Eigen layer team itself, right? I would say there could be three or four different layers of incentives that I think it could vary depending on which roll up you're talking about. So there could be a big roll up. They may have huge sequencing revenue. There could be other roll up. They may not have that huge sequencing revenue.
00:32:35.716 - 00:32:56.960, Speaker B: So they may have to compensate a little bit more with the token side, the one that generates a lot of revenue. They may not have to do compensate of the token side. So I think there'll be different ways in which some of these roles will incentivize. But of course, there's one component that would come from our side as well, which is our token to incentivize some of the people who are building and supporting ABs that are secured by Allstayer.
00:32:58.820 - 00:33:30.736, Speaker A: That's a great segue to my next question, and I don't know if you have already thought of all of the tokenomics around the outlayer token, but one thing that's very interesting is how do you think of revenue in Asayo token for risk takers? How do you allocate the outer revenue that will be providing operators, depending on the different types of jobs that they may be doing in the alt layer ecosystem over the years?
00:33:30.858 - 00:34:24.140, Speaker B: Yes, it will again depend on normally, imagine if you're building a roll up, and let's say you don't have a token, right? And then in that case, Alt becomes alongside, let's say an LST or staked asset. It becomes kind of the dual token model where you will have Alt and you have any of the LSTs that are securing or that are being restaked. In that model, we'll enforce a certain percentage that has to come from alt token or percentage that comes from, let's say, the restaked assets, right? So for example, it's going to be 50 50. You haven't fully decided on how that would look like, but there will be a percentage. So you'll be forced to bring at least a certain amount of tokens that will have to come from all tokens. And then again, the revenue will basically, or the rewards will basically get divided accordingly. It's kind of like the quorum model that Eigenair has, where you have basically two pools, and then the incentive will go according to that pool.
00:34:24.140 - 00:35:05.080, Speaker B: In a model where the DAP already has a token. In that model, we potentially may have a three token model where you could have the DAP token, the all token, and the restaked assets. And again, the incentive would be divided accordingly, depending on which part we want to incentivize. So of course there will be incentive for people who stake all tokens. But again, I think we still have to see and go by the year a little bit and see how those numbers actually look like. We haven't finalized concrete numbers yet because there are certain moving parts around, whether DAP has a token or not has a token and so on and so forth. But yeah, ALT will be used as one of the key token that has to be staked alongside any staked assets.
00:35:07.100 - 00:35:20.960, Speaker A: Okay, so just to summarize, the restakers expected revenue will come from the ad layout token, potentially ETH as well, and potentially even the rollout token that they're securing.
00:35:22.900 - 00:35:47.480, Speaker B: So sequencing revenue. So whatever money that sequencer makes, I think they can share a portion of that all token as rewards. And then the DAp token, if the Dap has a token, because if a Dap is. Because in the end, ABS is not serving, all player ABS is serving a certain roll up. And so roll up has to provide certain incentive for the ABS operators to actually go and serve that ABS. So there has to be an incentive that has to come from the underlying DAP.
00:35:49.580 - 00:36:05.468, Speaker A: And what happens, for example, if a roll up is not profitable enough for the Altaya operators to run? Is there like a committee to decide on which roll up will have to leave the alt layer set? How does it work?
00:36:05.554 - 00:36:59.756, Speaker B: Yeah, so there's something, again, we have to see how this will work, especially in the LRT model, right, where LRTs have to somehow decide which AVss to support and which AVss they will redirect the restaked assets to. I feel like at some point, if the incentives for an operator is not large enough, then I think the LRTs will have to kind of rethink and say, look, the guys, this abs is not interesting enough for us, and so we have to vote them out in some way. So I think it will all boil down to incentives and how the incentives plays out eventually, and then how the LRTs behave, how the LRTs decide on which avs to support and things like that. I think it's a little bit of open in the air. Even when I talk to some of the LRT providers, they're still kind of discussing how to assess the risk and reward kind of scenario for all these AVs that they need to select. So I don't have a form answer to it. I think.
00:36:59.756 - 00:37:45.132, Speaker B: I guess in some ways there will be some sort of governance mechanism where the operators will say, look, this AVs is not interesting enough for me. And by the way, it doesn't apply to roll up as well. So imagine like alt layers, roll ups are one kind of rule up, right? You could have other rule ups as well, right? Other kinds of AVs as well. So for example, you could imagine an ABS for liquidity layer. So people building a liquidity layer as an ABS, people building chain link as an ABS. And again, the LRT providers have to somehow decide which avs that are really, really valuable for them in terms of incentives and reward. And then at some point through governance, they will have to say, okay, this abs we should stop supporting because either it's too risky for us, maybe it's not just about reward, it's also about risk as well, right? Because it could be too risky for us.
00:37:45.132 - 00:38:32.524, Speaker B: It could be the case where this abs has a very long and bonding period. So imagine, I don't know, I have an ABS, and that ABS is super. It gives you a huge incentive, but it locks your assets for maybe, I don't know, three months or four months. Kind of like the voted escrow model that we have popular in the defi space, right? So if they lock you for three years, you will have a huge incentive. But is it worth it? I don't know. I think the LRT providers will have to kind of assess or operators have to assess, which was really makes sense for them. And if at any point of time they feel like it's not worthy enough, I think they would stop supporting them in the same way that happens in the POS chains today, right? If you're supporting as a validator a certain POS chain, if at some point, let's say the token drops or incentives are not strong enough, you stop supporting it, right? You kind of pull out.
00:38:32.524 - 00:38:36.350, Speaker B: And so I guess it will be similar social style model as well.
00:38:38.320 - 00:39:23.276, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. I guess we can finish by talking a bit about the world as a service platform that Atlaya offers. We've seen recently dimension, the Cosmos chain launch just yesterday actually, which is also, I would say, something similar than Atlayer. It enables users to launch their own wallapps. So how do you see at layer's solution compared to others? We can use dimension, maybe dimension is very typical, but we can also use Caldera and conduit as example.
00:39:23.458 - 00:39:52.068, Speaker B: Yeah, I think Caldera and convict are probably a better example for RAS. I mean, dimension is slightly more than that, I would say they also have a settlement layer. And I think the focus, not necessarily pure RaSp, but a little bit more than that. A good example for RAS would be something like Caldera and convict. And so if you compare RAS service, they are more or less the same. I would say there's no fundamental difference between Caldera's RAS service or layer's RAS service or conduit's RASp service. They're more or less the same.
00:39:52.068 - 00:40:41.892, Speaker B: All they're basically doing is they're taking a certain SDK and saying, hey, we are taking, let's say roll up SDK like op stack, and we would run and manage the sequencer and the rest of the service for you. My belief is that it is something that we internally strongly believe that Ras, in the long term, does not have a long term mood. And the reason why you see is that, in a sense, what you're doing is you're taking a certain SDK and you're wrapping it around an AWS or doing your DevOps spread and hosting that. And that doesn't build any network effect, that doesn't build anything. And so in the long term, we believe that Ras have to become decentralized. It cannot just be where you have a vendor and you ask your vendor to run the system for you and they will run it. Maybe initially when you are talked to.
00:40:41.892 - 00:41:34.496, Speaker B: And by the way, this is why we started with the restaked roll up idea. Because when we talk to all these clients that come to us for our services, they say, hey, it's good that you serve us this roll up as service, but what if in the future, we wanted to bring this whole service in house? What if we wanted to run this sequencer ourselves at some? So that was the first question. The second question was that, hey, what if we wanted to decentralize the system? What if we wanted to move away from your service and move to Caldera, for example? How do you do that? And so I think the main problem was that Ras in general is a very closed system, right? And it doesn't work and doesn't work very well with the blockchain ethos of openness and decentralization. And so the restricted idea actually allows people, so Ras vendors to actually compete in open market. So, for example, let's say, if you say, hey, I want to have five sequences. One of the sequences could be run by Caldera, the other one could be run by conduit. Third could be by Altlair.
00:41:34.496 - 00:42:11.520, Speaker B: Fourth could be done by dimension, for example. So it makes the system much more open. Where you're not logged by legal contracts that you have signed with Kelden or conduit or Altlair, you're much more driven by the market dynamics. If, let's say, committee says, hey, all these RAS services that are serving my sequences should bring a certain amount of collateral, they have to bring that collateral as well. I think it becomes, there's a lot of skin in the system as well, game as well. And I think it becomes much more decentralized and open. I would say Ras services in the end will become more decentralized and will resemble a lot like decentralized sequencing.
00:42:14.590 - 00:42:15.434, Speaker A: Perfect.
00:42:15.632 - 00:42:16.042, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:42:16.096 - 00:42:28.090, Speaker A: And talking a bit about that long term future for us and maybe for roll ups in general, how do you see the longer roadmap of Ethereum? Regarding rollups?
00:42:28.850 - 00:43:40.942, Speaker B: Ethereum has already committed to this roll up centric roadmap, and we have seen that over the last two, three years with Starknet, arbitrum, optimism, zkissing, and a bunch of others. I think what we didn't realize back in the day, like two years ago, that we will have so many roll up instantiations, right? We will have so many SDKs that will allow people to deploy roll ups. And literally in the last, I would say, seven or ten days, we have onboarded at least 15 clients who want to use apps like app specific roll ups. That shows the promise of how people want to have their own instances. Maybe not everyone will survive. Maybe in the next two, three years, many of these rollups will realize that, okay, it's not probably the best model for them, but I think it's pretty clear to me, and I think it's pretty clear to the space that if you go and want to have a consumer facing application, let's imagine Farcaster, right, which is quite hyped in the last few days with the launch of frames. If Farcaster really becomes big to a point where it handles even one 10th of Twitter's user volume, it has to go on this own chain.
00:43:40.942 - 00:44:20.474, Speaker B: There's no way a general purpose chain like base can handle all of that. They have to go on an app specific chain, and they may want to customize their chain for different needs. Right? And so sadly, we haven't seen a huge consumer facing application quite yet in the crypto space. We have seen uniswaps, we have seen Aave and compound and Opensea and whatnot, but still has not touched an average user on the street. Right? If you go and pick a random person on the street, they probably would not know what a uniswap is. And I think if we're just waiting for the time when you will have a consumer facing application, and if you have a consumer facing blockchain application, it simply cannot run on a general purpose chain. You have to have an app specific instance to capture value, to offer better experience to users.
00:44:20.474 - 00:45:07.006, Speaker B: And the fourth worst thing, know, if you look at Ethereum or in any general purpose chain today, right, when you send a transaction to Ethereum today, you are paying a fee to the applications. For example, if you're trading on uniswap, you're paying a fee to uniswap, but you're also paying a fee to Ethereum validators. Right? And if you think about it, right? That's very counterintuitive. If you look at the web two world, when you tweet on Twitter, you don't pay Twitter and your retested service provider every single time you make a tweet, you don't do that. And so this model that you have to pay fees at two different levels every single time you send a transaction, I think it's a bit of very poor user experience. And you can change many of that if you build your own app specific roll up, because you could customize in many different ways. Right.
00:45:07.006 - 00:45:20.740, Speaker B: I do believe that to offer people better user experience, to be able to customize the experience, you will need an app specific roll up. So I think eventually you will see a lot of the bigger apps will definitely go and have their own shape, for sure.
00:45:24.750 - 00:46:00.530, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. And this is also like a vision that we're sharing internally at Kian. A lot of our team members are very excited about the future for worldups and something that we take very seriously. I guess one thing to finish up is do you have any recommendations for future risk takers that are listening to this podcast? Anything to look at in the context of ad layer, anything to search in general to better understand what's at stake with Eigen layer as a whole.
00:46:00.680 - 00:46:23.978, Speaker B: Yeah, so look, I mean, for those, there are two kinds of people. One who are still holding ETH in their ledger wallet and whatnot, get involved. I think ILA and the broader restaking ecosystem is growing by the day. I think the next six, eight months is going to be huge. The IglA is going to grow tremendously in the next six, eight months. Many of the Avs are going to go live. Many of the LRTs are live, but they're not serving any of the Avs quite yet.
00:46:23.978 - 00:47:38.980, Speaker B: But I think that will change quite quickly in the next six, eight months. So if you're holding, get involved, of course, do understand the risk, but do get involved in the ecosystem and those who are already involved do understand different EVs that are operating in the market. Again, Altlay is one of the EVss and we would love to have your assets used to secure our EVSs, but also look beyond. I think there are many interesting things being built in the EVs space and I think as a riskaker, you also have a responsibility to basically convince the operators to pick a certain abs of your choice. Because what you don't want is, hey, I'm staking with, let's say, one of the LRT providers and the LRT provider on its own decides a certain ABs based on their risk or reward policy, which you may not like. So also get involved in some of those conversations where you can say, hey, I have my asset staked with a certain provider, but I want to also make sure that the Abs that I like and love gets involved or gets supported through my assets. So learn a lot about ABs and use that knowledge to pass it down to the LRT provider or any of the operators that you're using and convince them to go and support your favorite EVs that you are excited about.
00:47:41.210 - 00:48:20.410, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah, and Kym is definitely aware of its responsibility in better understanding AVss and being able to also help risk takers make an educated choice. Amit, thank you so much for participating in our podcast. I would love to have you on for maybe like another session when the AVs launch is imminent, and maybe you have more details on tokenomics and so on. Last question for you, baby, is will you be at East Denver?
00:48:20.570 - 00:48:33.960, Speaker B: Unfortunately, no, I won't be at East Denver, but my colleague Yao Chi, he will be there. I think he's speaking at quite a few events. So if you're going there, I'm sure you will meet him at one of the icon lay events or one of the events for the ABS operators on AVss in general.
00:48:35.210 - 00:48:46.550, Speaker A: Perfect. We'd be shocked to talk to the Atlayer team. Now is your time if you want to show some of your socials, if you want to share a Twitter or something about atlaya.
00:48:46.890 - 00:49:11.226, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Look, the best place, of course, in the crypto space is Twitter. So if you are not following us, go and join follow. Our Twitter account is Alton Scone Layer and this is where we update on our progress. And so once some of the EVs are live and ready, you would be able to learn more about them. And also, we also post about different roll ups that we support. So eventually many of these roll ups will go to the EVs route.
00:49:11.226 - 00:49:33.158, Speaker B: So the sooner you learn about these roll ups, the better you can make choice on which roll ups to and which Avs to actually support eventually. So follow us. Follow our Twitter account. That's the best place to learn more about offlay and again, website and docs if you want to dig deeper into how these different EVs that we are building will operate once it's fully ready. And again, thank you very much for inviting me and for those who are.
00:49:33.164 - 00:49:48.240, Speaker A: Listening, it was our pleasure. It was our pleasure. Thank you so much again Amrit and to the audience. We will see you soon in the next episode of Upload. Guest series. Stay tuned. Have a nice one.
00:49:48.240 - 00:49:52.700, Speaker A: Our.
