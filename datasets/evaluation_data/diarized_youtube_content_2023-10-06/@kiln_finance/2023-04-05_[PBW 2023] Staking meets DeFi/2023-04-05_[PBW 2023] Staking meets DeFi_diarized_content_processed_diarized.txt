00:00:03.210 - 00:01:30.646, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, let's start with the first panel of the afternoon when staking meet DeFi. And we have the chance to have three experts on the subjects, with first, Nicola, CTO of Swissburg, then Paul, that is CEO and co founder of Mo Lab, developing the Morpho protocol, and Pierre, with leading revenue initiatives at Trustwallet. So thank you all for coming. We're going to tackle topics of staking, liquid staking, and DeFi, see what's the evolutions of these products, and see also what are the risk, the challenges, and how can institutions access these yields in the future. So maybe just quick introduction about staking. Just wanted to remind you, in case you forgot, coming from the inflation of each protocol, in the case of Ethereum, for example, and with fees, also of the network fees plus Mev, maybe, Paul, can you also remind us what you think of DeFi is compared to staking? And just as a reminder, staking is not DeFi protocol yields. DeFi is everything that is happening on the execution layer.
00:01:30.758 - 00:01:46.800, Speaker B: Yes. So crypto is about transferring money with our banks, while DeFi is about doing all sort of financial primitives with our banks. So it's basically replacing traditional finance with algorithms. And in the case of Morpho, it's replacing lending and borrowing with an.
00:01:48.450 - 00:01:56.340, Speaker A: Thanks. Thanks for that definition. And maybe, Pierre, do you want to quickly introduce what liquid staking is?
00:01:57.030 - 00:02:25.690, Speaker C: Yeah, sure. So if staking is the way today to secure the network and to validate transaction, liquid staking is kind of a fix or a patch on staking to bring more value to the person who is going to stake. Basically, liquid staking will correct efficiency for the liquidity by not locking your assets. So liquid staking is kind of staking 2.0 for the users.
00:02:26.350 - 00:02:50.046, Speaker A: Thanks for that. That's super clear. Nicola, at Trismurg, you're using these three kinds of products, right? Staking, liquid staking, and defi. Can you maybe explain us what are the risks of these three kinds of product? And what is the difference between what we call in crypto, CFI.
00:02:50.078 - 00:02:50.274, Speaker B: Right.
00:02:50.312 - 00:02:55.342, Speaker A: Centralized finance compared to these open finance kind of yields.
00:02:55.406 - 00:02:59.806, Speaker D: Okay, cool. So there's a lot to unpack in here. Yeah, take your time.
00:02:59.848 - 00:03:00.534, Speaker B: Take your time.
00:03:00.652 - 00:03:03.158, Speaker A: You have time? Okay. Take your time.
00:03:03.244 - 00:04:06.390, Speaker D: All right, so if we start with the beginning and there is like a staking. So the level of risk is more like a systemic risk against the chains. And this is like, what is the risk that you have? So if there is like a 50% attack, 51% attack on the chain, then perhaps your stake can be dangerous and stuff like this. So then if we look at DeFi, we are at another layer, because then the counterparty risk includes the smart contracts, but also a bad actor that could do financial attack. So for instance, we can all remember the attack on mango that happened in otten, where basically was a huge manipulation with noracle and a token that has a small market cap. So an attacker can manipulate this and then drain the value of the DeFi protocol. But it's not like kind of technical.
00:04:06.390 - 00:04:53.418, Speaker D: So it can be either technical or financial attack. And then the other question was regarding liquid staking. So before talking about the risk, more like the interest, and why do we have liquid staking? Right. So the point is that you're always kind of like looking for more. So in a sense that when you're participating in a proof of stake, your asset is at rest, and if you want, you are staking it. But then your question is like, what can I do with it? So typically, if you tokenize this, then you can start to have some other utility. So for instance, if you go on a borrow and lending platform, and you lend if, well, that's cool, you can have like a certain interest.
00:04:53.418 - 00:05:13.460, Speaker D: But then if you go on a liquid staking token, you can have the staking yield, plus the yield coming on the borrow and lending platform, so you can have more. And so it's always this concept that if you tokenize the yield, you can then use this as an asset, a yield bearing asset, and do some other stuff.
00:05:14.470 - 00:05:16.420, Speaker A: That's very cool. No, that's great.
00:05:17.190 - 00:05:21.010, Speaker D: And then the last question was finally, like the C five.
00:05:21.080 - 00:05:23.730, Speaker A: C five versus staking liquid staking, D five.
00:05:23.800 - 00:06:20.374, Speaker D: Yeah. How I see is that ultimately some are the same. Right? So I would say a 16 z was making this analogy. So this american VC funds that is not so well known, they said that there was like the DeFi mullet, Defi in the front, Defi in the back. And I would say that's kind of like what Swissborg is in a sense that at the end it's a question of convenience. There is a lot of people that are, okay, I want to own my keys. And there's some other kind of person that, for instance, we have tons of person that are still not managing passwords correctly, still being scammed when people are asking, oh, I'm the technical support of that company, just give me your password, they're going to help you.
00:06:20.374 - 00:06:44.094, Speaker D: And then your email has been hacked or whatsoever. So now just imagine that this private key is your entire wealth. Then this is gone. So for certain person that are educated well, custody system are the best, and from some others, they're going to need help. And in that sense, CFI systems are going to be like this intermediary that are going to be helpful for this.
00:06:44.212 - 00:06:56.190, Speaker A: That makes sense. Paul, I know you have a take on that. What do you think are the advantages of opens finance and DeFi versus Defi?
00:06:56.550 - 00:07:52.702, Speaker B: Yes, so I would say there's many, but I think the one that is the most striking when you think about DFI versus traditional finance, is the fact that if you look at traditional finance today, like banks and credit unions, you have ton of them. You have approximately 50,000 different banks in the world. They all have their DevOps team, like their buildings, like their algorithms to lend and borrow assets, for example. And DeFi is a common infrastructure that is the same for everybody. So you have one development cost for everybody. Ethereum is the common infrastructure, and then DFI is the common application layer for finance. And instead of having 50,000 times a development team working on basically the same algorithm, which is closed source in every single entity, well, here we're all working on the same primitive.
00:07:52.702 - 00:08:49.798, Speaker B: So morpho protocol, for example, is fully open source, and anybody can contribute and get paid to contribute to that protocol. And the paradigm shift here is that you divide the cost by 50,000, basically. And so this is one of the advantages that is really striking. But obviously, you have many others. I would say basically you have three main things, like the openness, the optimality, efficiency, and the resiliency. So, in terms of resiliency, you have the idea that the infrastructure on top of which defi is sitting, which is a blockchain, is obviously very resilient and very neutral, which is a good thing to have when you're building a financial service. When it comes to efficiencies, there is the argument which I made, which is about development costs, which are very, very low.
00:08:49.798 - 00:09:47.446, Speaker B: If you think about the Uniswap protocol that last Sunday, or maybe one week ago, did 5% of the Nasdaq volume, approximately with ten billions, I think in terms of volume, in one day. It was made literally by two people, or three people in the very beginning, the Uniswap view and algorithm. And this is impressive to see that the development cost of coding these 700 lines of code of Uniswap is minimal compared to building the forex exchange worldwide. So this is where the true economic value is. And then you have, of course, the social value, which is in the openness, the neutrality of algorithms, where basically anyone can access those code, anyone can see where the money is, where it's flowing, and also every single line of the algorithm, how customers are treated, if they are treated equally, not equally, et cetera, et cetera. So I could talk very long on this subject because there's many advantages, but yeah, I think I stopped there.
00:09:47.468 - 00:09:48.710, Speaker D: I would add composability.
00:09:48.870 - 00:09:49.820, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely.
00:09:52.190 - 00:10:18.210, Speaker A: Frankie, that was amazing. And I want to come back later on Defi versus CFI on your specific application of lending. But before that, Pierre Nicholas kind of started to explain what liquid staking is. Right? If you want to add your definition, please go ahead. And where does liquid staking sit in the defi stack and why it is important for the rest of the Defi ecosystem?
00:10:19.670 - 00:11:21.750, Speaker C: I think at the very beginning, and still today, staking is the first product of the deFi. I mean it's the easiest one for traditional people to onboard them in crypto because it's the DeFi product, the closest of the token itself. Staking interact with the native token of the chain so it's easier to understand for everyone. And liquid staking come to fix some issue normal people could have with staking, your funds won't be locked, you can exit your position when you want. For example, on Ethereum, liquid staking allows everyone to stake, even if you don't have 32 e on a self custody way. So it's a huge improvement of making these services, the staking available for much more people inside the ecosystem.
00:11:23.210 - 00:11:55.710, Speaker A: Yeah, I agree. Staking is the primary value of proof of stake blockchains and liquid staking with a receipt token should be the first deFi protocol, at least at the bottom of the defi stack, and should bring the inflation and the fees value from the protocol back to the rest of different deFi protocols, such as lending or options and so forth.
00:11:56.690 - 00:12:26.582, Speaker C: It should be the first step for everyone who would like to interact with DeFi should be to stake your native token to get a liquid one and then to go on Morpho, for example, to use it as a collateral. Liquid token are the safest collateral on a daily basis because it's the only token who is going to see its value increasing over the time without doing anything thanks to the yield. So this will reduce the liquidation risk for every holders on the lending protocol.
00:12:26.726 - 00:13:31.040, Speaker A: Yeah, and just to mention disclaimer, it's not an investment. Of course you shouldn't forcibly go on Lido and then more to stake your assets. So coming back on centralized lending versus decentralized lending, I want to come back to an event that happened this earlier last year, at the end last year where FTX, I mean, we all know that FTX collapsed. And the largest creditor of the FTX was genesis. And obviously, the fact that several billions were missing in genesis balance sheet kind of applied a dominion effect on all decentralized lending that was managed by genesis and the rest of the markets. So, Paul, can you explain what kind of happened there? What was the problem and how DeFi decentralized lending? And maybe I'm still doing a bit of publicity there, but Morpho solved that.
00:13:31.650 - 00:14:34.450, Speaker B: So I think there's two points to make. There's one risk that DeFi does not solve and one that it does solve. So there are two problems here. You have the fact that they were all intricated with one another, and this is not something that DeFi solves, because in DeFi we have protocols that are basically composed with one another. This was a great advantage of DeFi, which I did not mention before, but you can basically compose uniswap with whatever, like Morpho, et cetera, to do more complex financial services. And because of this, it can happen that, for example, if you have some collateral deposited on a protocol and this protocol gets hacked, you have this chain of event that also happened in DeFi as well as in CFI, that says there's really good advantages in being in DeFi. Is that in the case of FTX specifically, no one had any idea of what was going on.
00:14:34.450 - 00:15:17.826, Speaker B: Like, I personally had a lot of trust into FTX until the event, so I had no idea what was going on. I think it's the case for most of people, and the reason why that is, is that because there was no possibility for people to actually check what they were doing. Like, at no point in time you were able to check their balance sheet, et cetera. So you have obviously advantages in that in terms of privacy. But maybe at some point you could expect some trust anchors in their processes, which they did not have. And I think that obviously, if we had those, it would at least have constrained the way they behaved. Because, for example, in the US, you had FTX in the Bahamas, but also FTX in the US.
00:15:17.826 - 00:16:00.510, Speaker B: In the US, there were constraints, and you had those trust anchors not through DeFi, but through regulations. And people were able to check that they were not doing like, nonsense. And in DeFi, you don't have really the need to even have this kind of regulation because it's all trustless and it's a continuous verification of what's going on on the Morpho protocol, for example, you know, at every second where every single cent is deposited, where it is, you can track everything, you know exactly what's going on. So I think that's a very preventive way to have fund managers, for example, to do complete nonsense with their finances. So I think that's one of the great advantages of DeFi.
00:16:01.010 - 00:16:20.774, Speaker A: Yeah, I completely agree. And, Nicholas, can you also maybe expand to, what's the vision of Swissborg versus centralized app? And again, like, offering all these staking, liquid staking Defi yields to your customers.
00:16:20.892 - 00:17:23.740, Speaker D: Yeah. So, regarding Swissboard, the point is really to be able to make it easy to access those products, because one thing that we haven't touched on is that DeFi is in a very early age, and it is not easy for anyone to kind of figure out who are the trustless protocol that founders are there to do good jobs. There's also been a track record of founders trying to kind of take advantages of those protocols. So Swissborg is here, in a sense, that we do a curation of the protocol, and then we do a management of the positions. Because on most of the protocols, just passively providing liquidity sometimes is not enough. You might want to have more to be able to protect your assets. And that's what Swissborg is about, is to really help anybody to kind of access the DeFi product.
00:17:26.830 - 00:17:53.140, Speaker A: And that's a question I also have for Paul. We've been talking about DeFi and sometimes retail customers that you have on Swissborg. But how do you see also institutions coming into the space? What are kind of the challenges for these institutions to be exposed to liquid staking and defi yields? Maybe starting with you, Nicola, and then Paul, I would love to have your view on.
00:17:55.830 - 00:18:20.966, Speaker D: So I would say for us, the biggest question is that as we are pulling assets from our users, it's kind of like increasing what's at stake. So it's really about security, safety, and being able to protect this efficiently. So that's the number one concern of Swissborg and the value that we provide to our users.
00:18:21.078 - 00:18:24.042, Speaker A: Got it, Paul?
00:18:24.106 - 00:19:13.370, Speaker B: Yeah. So my opinion is that, to be honest, currently, I think DeFi is made for DeFi people. And this is why you have tools like Swissborg that enable people that are not in the DeFi world to interact with DeFi. But also, it has been structurally imagined for people with very, very low regulatory constraints. For example, if you go to lending protocols, it's fully permissionless. There's no constraint or barriers to entry, which is obviously a big problem for many, many big financial institutions. So if you take Morgan, for example, they're not willing to share money with a country that is not necessarily, that is in a sanctioned list or whatsoever.
00:19:13.370 - 00:20:10.398, Speaker B: So I think that as DeFi will mature and need to tackle broader markets, it will have to evolve in such a way that it enables a separation between users, depending on the conditions that each and every of those users have, considering their regulatory constraint, their risk constraint, et cetera, et cetera. So if we take an example, obviously you have the KYC, which is very famous in the traditional finance system. So, for example, ave another lending protocol, decided to bootstrap a protocol which was KYC gated. Right. Only people that performed a certain KYC could enter the pool. But the problem then is that everybody has a different KyC, et cetera, et cetera. So I think that in general, defi infrastructure has to evolve to adapt to the constraints of the real market.
00:20:10.398 - 00:20:45.098, Speaker B: When I say real market, I'm not saying that DeFi is not a true market. I'm just saying that it's very, very small compared to traditional finance usage. And it's also very not sufficiently connected to the real world usage. It's like today, I've been working in DeFi for three years now, and most of the usage is still very speculative. And every month, every year, we're getting away from this for real world use cases. But I think new infrastructures that enable more selectivity on the users will be pre module. That's one thing.
00:20:45.098 - 00:21:34.278, Speaker B: And also you need a good risk reward ratio. And in DeFi, the risk reward ratio is not so obvious because there's a ton of risk regarding smart contract, regarding markets, et cetera, except for one use case, which is staking. And staking is, in my opinion, the incentive for people to jump into DeFi. It's like literally very low risk compared to a very important reward, in my personal opinion, not financial advice, but yeah, I think this is definitely an entry point for institutionals in the sense that the yield is sufficient. Institutionals are bearing a reputation risk. They're bearing a compliance risk if they jump into DeFi. So the reward has to be sufficiently high such that they're willing to make that risk and to take that risk.
00:21:34.278 - 00:21:39.050, Speaker B: And this is why I think staking is going to play a major role in this institutional adoption.
00:21:40.210 - 00:22:08.722, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I can only agree, but maybe just very quick question. So you touched about KYC, you touched about staking, you also touched about this, I think, challenge that we need to see more CFI DeFi connection, maybe CFI products with the same DeFi experience openness, transparency and easiness of use. Can you expand a little bit on that?
00:22:08.856 - 00:22:56.218, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. Obviously I'm not saying we should put KYC on DeFi. What I'm trying to say here is that if you look at the email, the way emails works is that you have the SMTP protocol. So it's a small algorithm that is going to state how the content of an email is going to be forwarded from one person to another. It's completely neutral, permissionless, anyone can use it. Whether you have terrorist activity or whatever activity, you can use SMTP and then you have the interface, the client, which is potentially like Gmail or Hotmail. And obviously Gmail and Hotmail are what you could claim as being the equivalent of CFI in DeFi.
00:22:56.218 - 00:23:47.700, Speaker B: So you have some sort of parallel where you have SMTP, which equivalent would be Uniswap or morpho in DeFi, and then you have like Gmail or Hotmail, which uses SMTP. And then you would have CFI, like Swissborg, for example, that is going to provide access to SMTP, sorry to Morpho or Uniswap, but through enforcing regulations, for example, or enforcing a certain level of trust that is required by an institutional, for example. And I really like to see it this way because you don't want to impose constraints at the lower level. Like for example, imagine the nightmare it would have been if HTTP had to be constructed with KYC constraints from the start. This doesn't make any sense. I don't know if this is specifically your question.
00:23:48.390 - 00:23:51.718, Speaker A: That was very interesting. And do you see that that way?
00:23:51.884 - 00:24:46.550, Speaker D: Yeah, absolutely. That kind of goes in the same direction I was saying before. Is that how we see it? Is that at the moment going in Defi is still like rough, and we see the role of Swissborg of making it more accessible and easier, right? So that, I don't know, when you go to see a bank and you want to do an investment, you don't need like 20 hours of studying all the details and knowing everything about your money. You kind of like, okay, that fits my needs in terms of risk profile and what I'm going to earn of that. And then you sign up and go, and Swissborg wants to be those trusted partner to be able to do that the same way. So we're all about facilitating so that anybody can embark in a crypto journey and benefit from it easily.
00:24:47.610 - 00:25:05.280, Speaker A: Do you think it's the role of trust wallet as well, to be this trust gateway decentralized way of being a bank and offering these yields to the world to trustwallet customers.
00:25:06.130 - 00:26:01.514, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, at Trustwallet we try to be the front door of web3 and Defi for traditional people. We want to have our users responsible for the action. We do not have the private key or python at the opposite of central ad services. So in the meantime, we are not going to have a KYC on the operation as we are not responsible for our users activity. But we try to always educate them and to bring them the more relevant information to let them take the best decision. For example, inside the app, before a user is performing any action, we can show him a security scanner, depending on the smart contract or the address he's going to interact with just to prevent him. Hey, you are going to interact with something who could be fraudulent.
00:26:01.514 - 00:26:20.040, Speaker C: Are you sure you want to perform this action? But we are not going to fraud these assets or to forbid him to perform any action. Everyone at trustwallets are the owner of the assets and this is the main difference with centralized services, as Morpho said.
00:26:20.730 - 00:26:41.790, Speaker A: Amazing. So before we open it to the audience, a lot of friends there, I can see if you have a crystal ball, right? And you can tell how do you imagine staking, liquid staking and defi in five years? Starting with you, Pierre?
00:26:42.930 - 00:27:40.634, Speaker C: I think Defi in general are full of promises for everyone. And the main reason is, in my opinion, because at the very beginning of Defi we didn't have any rules except code is low. But above this, we didn't have any regulation. So we tried to build an ecosystem as fair as we could. And this is a massive change compared to the traditional finance. But now we are at some point we need to still increase the user experience to involve more and more people inside DeFi without using traditional finance or centralized services. But in the same time, if we want to have huge inflow of cash from institutional investors or institutional companies who are heavily regulated, we have to find a way of how we can fit the requirement from the regulators to let these institutional investors to come inside DeFi.
00:27:40.634 - 00:28:02.070, Speaker C: So if I could have crystal ball, I would say, I think the main point would be how we are going to increase the user experience to be as frictionless as we can, to involve everyone in DeFi, and at the same time to be sure we are going to be compliant with as many house regulation we can on the long term.
00:28:02.890 - 00:28:08.018, Speaker A: That makes a lot of sense. Paul, what's your vision in five years?
00:28:08.204 - 00:28:53.430, Speaker B: I believe that with time we'll be able to build abstraction layers at many levels. So what I mean by that is, it's also coming to user experience in some points is like you have ETH, and in my personal opinion, soon you'll have only liquid stakes. You won't have really much ease, and you would not be paying gas with your ease. You'd probably be paying gas with liquid stakes. So all of this experience will be completely abstracted for the user. It will be natively better without you knowing what's happening in the back end. When you'll be using maybe not five years, but maybe a little bit more, but when you'll be using whatever bank account behind this, you will have blockchain technology.
00:28:53.430 - 00:29:34.098, Speaker B: And maybe it's going to be a private key that is in cloud in your phone and you don't even know about it. So what I believe is really going to push this space forward is probably abstraction of all those different layers, whether very technical, but whether they are pure user experience. And I don't think the blockchain technology in general is something like AI, where you can witness and see, oh, wow, this is amazing. This is completely new. I think it should not change anything in our life, except that the services that we use are more resilient, they're more open and they're more efficient. And except for this, it should not be changing much our lives. That's how I see it.
00:29:34.184 - 00:29:40.280, Speaker A: Very exciting. So, blockchains, when using your bank account in not five years, but five years and a half, right, you said?
00:29:40.890 - 00:29:42.182, Speaker B: Yeah, approximately. Yeah.
00:29:42.236 - 00:29:44.066, Speaker A: Okay, Nicholas.
00:29:44.258 - 00:30:34.166, Speaker D: So now when we look, how many of you are exposed to the bonds of your government? Very little. Usually it's repackaged product. And at the end, when we look at the natural yield of any currency being the US dollar or the euro, very few of us have access to it. And this is really what crypto is about, is about now removing all the barriers, because in traditional finance, there is the so called accreditor investors. So basically, not everyone deserves to have access to certain products. And now we can finally break those barriers and offer the natural yield of the platforms to everybody. And I believe this is really what is everything about here.
00:30:34.348 - 00:30:35.320, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:30:36.010 - 00:30:36.760, Speaker C: Cool.
00:30:37.550 - 00:30:48.300, Speaker A: That was amazing. But do you have any questions for these gentlemen in the audience? Questions, raise your hand.
00:30:51.150 - 00:30:52.960, Speaker D: Willem. I have a question.
00:30:53.890 - 00:30:54.314, Speaker C: Paul.
00:30:54.362 - 00:31:09.970, Speaker D: Right. Do you think zero knowledge tech is going to open up Defi to institutions by allowing things like KYC, non invasive KyC?
00:31:10.550 - 00:32:14.840, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. So one of the requirements of institutionals I did not discuss it was privacy because obviously blockchain is great because everything is transparent, but blockchain is bad because everything is transparent, and you don't want everybody to know what your finances are, what is a state, et cetera, et cetera. However, you may want it to be verifiable and selectively verifiable. And this is what zero knowledge tech is quite useful about, is that it helps people being able to prove a certain state of their finances to a certain set of people, which I think is quite extraordinary. And by the way, without revealing the finance itself, I believe zero knowledge tech is somehow very complementary to blockchain tech in so many different ways. And privacy is one of them, and it should be able to fill the different constraints that they have in terms of privacy. Some of them, it's not just about their privacy, it's just a constraint that they have.
00:32:14.840 - 00:32:43.394, Speaker B: That said, I think there's still a lot of work to do in that front. I'm starting to see a bunch of solutions, just starting. But it's not ready yet, in my opinion, to be fully used in the world. At least. I did not see major use case leveraging this tech. I'm sure it will happen, and maybe I'm wrong, and there is one big one for me. Yes, it's a clear yes.
00:32:43.394 - 00:32:47.140, Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, thanks, guys.
00:32:47.750 - 00:33:16.540, Speaker E: I had a question about liquidity being fractured across different chains. Do you have maybe both on the Swissborg side and trustworthy side, a view on how to improve the user experience there, either via interfacing with different bridges, or maybe just your view on how the ecosystem will evolve? Are we going to have more chains that keep capturing fractioning liquidity, or do you see a consolidation there?
00:33:18.030 - 00:34:08.140, Speaker D: So I would say how I see it is kind of like the same way that tech has been working in the past, in a sense that at the moment, every possibility is being tried out in crypto. So that we see, and organically speaking, some will be more successful at attracting than others. So I don't think that we are going to have the one system rule them all. I don't think that this is going to be the case, but I think a handful of ecosystem are going to trump others and become more predominant. So I think the liquidity will tend to converge towards those and some after just niche products for particular use. Case.
00:34:09.950 - 00:34:58.250, Speaker C: On my side, I think liquidity will always follow the opportunity. I mean, if you have a new chain with a higher yield, because protocol will overpay with their own mining program, liquidity will follow this path. But at some point, like with torswap or with XLR, I think we are going to have some defi tools to move the liquidity from one chain to another on a very simple way without using complex bridge or anything like, for example, one inch or paraswap did for EVM chain by moving the funds. I think we should have the same for real cross chain activity with some protocol who are going to just allow the mass market users to move their liquidity from one chain to another one very simply.
00:35:01.550 - 00:35:19.420, Speaker A: Okay, I think maybe one question. No, it's up to Marie if it's a quick one. Okay, if you have one question, be quick, anyone? Okay, thank you very much.
