00:00:00.650 - 00:00:55.138, Speaker A: Hi. In this video I'm going to take you through staking Ethereum using the kiln dashboard. So here on the stake page you can see all the networks we support and here we're going to select ETH. Now on this page you can see some stats about the network, some details about the mechanics of staking on ETH, and below some FAQs about ETH staking. On the right is our staking widget which enables you to first select the accounts that you want to stake towards. So I want to add to my treasury and stake for that portfolio. Here you can choose how much you want to stake in multiples of 32 ETH, where each validator gets funded by 32 Eth.
00:00:55.138 - 00:01:39.420, Speaker A: Here's an estimate of the rewards you can expect to earn. And then to actually go through this we're going to connect our wallet. So I'm going to connect a metamask wallet. With wallet connect you can use a bunch of other wallets such as fireblocks. So here's my metamask prompt. I'm going to choose this wallet and once I've connected it I'm asked just to verify the wallet address because this is the address that will hold the claim to the stake and the rewards. And once I've verified it, I can click stake now.
00:01:39.420 - 00:02:46.530, Speaker A: So in the background here, kiln is spinning up a new validator with a new validation key that's been generated. And here is a deposit transaction that is proposed to the user for funding one validator. So 32 e which gets sent to the beacon chain deposit contract in order to fund this one validator that I want to start. So once I verify all this, I hit confirm. So here I'm sending 32 go early Eth into the deposit contract and that's gone through now. So we have seen this transaction on the network and we get this congrats message. We can then go into the rewards page here where I can see all my stakes here for my treasury portfolio.
00:02:46.530 - 00:04:04.866, Speaker A: And each row here corresponds to a validator. So here we can see the validator that I have just staked for has appeared. So yeah, that's the basic flow. Just also worth saying two things. One is that this widget, there's no special business logic here, so we can provide you the source code for it if you want to integrate it into your own application. And the second thing to mention is the docs link here which takes you through bit of how our product is architected and the APIs that you can use to do these staking operations programmatically right. So starting the validator programmatically and then generating the deposit transaction programmatically, and then monitoring for each validator, monitoring the rewards that have been accrued.
00:04:04.866 - 00:04:23.020, Speaker A: So this is something you can, can do with an API key, and you can generate this API key from the applications tab here. So that's it for now. Hope that was useful. And don't hesitate if you have any other questions.
