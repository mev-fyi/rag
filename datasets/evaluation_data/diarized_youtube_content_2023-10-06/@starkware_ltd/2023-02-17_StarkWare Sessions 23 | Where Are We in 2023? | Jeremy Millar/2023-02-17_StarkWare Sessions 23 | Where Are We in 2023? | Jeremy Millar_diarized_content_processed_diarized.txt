00:00:00.330 - 00:00:00.880, Speaker A: You.
00:00:03.170 - 00:01:00.510, Speaker B: Hi, my name is Jeremy Miller. I work for a company called Consensus, and this is going to be a relatively nontechnical presentation on where we see the state of metropolitan Ethereum in 2023 and what we're doing about that. So if we look back over the last seven, eight years, is Ethereum has really developed out of the scaling trilemma, right, the trade offs of scalability, trust and decentralization. And it's not to say that those issues are largely solved, but they are well on their way to being solved. But the question is, why does this matter? Well, basic ledgers have already been demonstrated that for simplistic value transfers we can do that. We can do that relatively effectively at relative scale. However, that doesn't unlock a set of web3 use cases that go much beyond basic payments and trading.
00:01:00.510 - 00:02:40.270, Speaker B: So if we look at what's happened, we can scale Ethereum, right? I mean, even with optimistic roll ups, we're able to scale Ethereum into the hundreds of transactions per second, right? We're up sort of two to three x over where Ethereum mainet is, just through the use of relatively primitive EVM hacks, which is all, most of the current optimistic l two s really are. And what that means is we are seeing, even through the winter, TvL continues to increase into something that's quite sizable. But what's more important behind the scenes is the ability to, if you look at Vitalik's sort of five stage roadmap for scaling Ethereum is we're seeing progress on multiple fronts, in parallel. And to take them, you know, in the context of being here at the starquare sessions, there's tons of work going on around zero knowledge. Now, the work we do at consensus mostly focuses on, well, in terms of our own technical development, building a ZkevM, though in terms of our products, we support and we plan to support arbitrary technologies. But in addition to that, we're seeing, as we saw in the celestia presentation, modularity and the separation of consensus, data execution and settlement into varying layers is something where there is lots of activity and a variety of approaches being tested, none of which where we really know where things will land.
00:02:40.340 - 00:02:40.718, Speaker C: Right?
00:02:40.804 - 00:03:10.230, Speaker B: Like we don't actually know what a Zke EVM layer two will look like, let alone what that will look like with the additional layers of modularity. And then in parallel with that, we also have these app specific chains that are going on, whether it's polygon supernets, or what people are doing around gaming, which are taking sort of existing technologies and saying, if we apply these in narrower use cases where we constrain the design to address a narrower set of problems. What can we achieve?
00:03:10.310 - 00:03:10.940, Speaker C: Right?
00:03:12.270 - 00:05:57.840, Speaker B: And so when we go and look at the ecosystem, we really think that the focus that we see, if you actually go and dig into all the projects that the big l, two s and the big ecosystems are doing, really focus around zero knowledge and modularity, right? And what's going to happen when we get there? And the answer of course, is going to be that we are going to unlock high throughput, high data intensive applications, which is where we think the value really comes from. So we've sort of proven that even with our relatively primitive scale capabilities that Defi will work. But what we're seeing, regardless of where you look, is the desire to go into bigger and broader use cases in addition to the things that get the headlines from large brands. If you look at something like trying to run a large scale event in a metaverse, right, if you actually practically try and go and run a 5000 person event in Decentraland, what you see is very, very low levels of transactions relative to the number of people that attend. And that in part is because of the throughput that's available, doesn't yet support the types of use cases people want, right? But there is clear market demand to try and push the envelope out further and get there. And so in particular, and if you think back to the prior slide, 60% of VC capital went into gaming last year, if you narrow it down into look at our space, right? And that's why we're seeing sort of app specific chains emerging alongside sort of the more r and d and hard computer science problems that are going into modularity and into zero knowledge. And similarly, we see things like lens scaling, ens and identity reputation systems, plus the plus plus dows, all of these use cases currently start to look like a combination of a web two web3 mashup rather than a pure web3 application, right? And so if you think about what the architectural requirements are to build, say, a social network at scale, you will need things like data persistence, right? Where are you going to store all the images? How are you going to do fast real time messaging? What are you going to do if dowels really become the way we all work every day? Well, 30 transactions per second won't cut it.
00:05:57.840 - 00:06:25.798, Speaker B: So what we're doing at consensus is we believe that there is a positive feedback loop between trying to scale out developer infrastructure and user access. And so that there is a feedback loop that happens between providing infrastructure that will work at scale and enabling users to have seamless access to it.
00:06:25.884 - 00:06:26.182, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:26.236 - 00:06:43.754, Speaker B: So we really focus on two products, infura and metamask. And so what we do, for example, in the layer two world is we provide RPC endpoints to all the major l two s. That then allows us to provide the network access inside of metamask.
00:06:43.802 - 00:06:44.206, Speaker C: Right?
00:06:44.308 - 00:08:04.338, Speaker B: So the more and more capable we are at adding capabilities at the network layer in infura, the more and more networks we can provide in metamask. The other part that's really important to us isn't just continuous innovation, but it's permissionless innovation. So how do we enable both infura and metamask to become permissionlessly extensible? So with metamask, it's through the metamask snaps framework. And I think Alex Jupiter isn't here, but I think he's giving a talk on snaps somewhere in this event. And then with Infura, we've announced Xfura, which is our efforts to decentralize infura, to allow multiple hosting applications, which we have here. If you federate this out, right? So the goal here is to provide, if you allow for going back, if you allow for modularity, then how do you federate? We want to see other members of the ecosystem be able to take our products which have achieved substantive scale and be able to add to them, as opposed to having us restrict them and build for our own purposes. One of the areas that we're probably most excited about, and we're not the only company in the world that's doing work on this, is around zkevms.
00:08:04.338 - 00:08:48.802, Speaker B: And our goal, there are three major and probably a dozen total ZkevM projects out there. From our perspective, it's really not possible to decay today who is actually furthest ahead. And that's because most of the ZkevM implementations today have gotten one bit of it right. And sure, you might be able to build out the opticals and what have you, but if you go and compare, say, scroll, and what we're doing and what polygon is doing and matterlabs and go and look at them, you'll find that one will be better at this versus that. So one will be better at circuits, but won't have a very efficient prover.
00:08:48.866 - 00:08:49.480, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:50.090 - 00:08:55.826, Speaker B: The thing that we did that's particularly striking is the ability to do hash functions efficiently.
00:08:55.858 - 00:08:56.054, Speaker C: Right.
00:08:56.092 - 00:09:13.998, Speaker B: The EVM loves hash functions, and they're kind of expensive to do in a traditional, they're expensive to do in most EK implementations. And we figured out a way of solving that. But I think if we take a big step back, we're not here just to solve theoretical computer science problems.
00:09:14.084 - 00:09:14.622, Speaker C: Right?
00:09:14.756 - 00:10:03.198, Speaker B: Really what we're trying to figure out is how to build web3. And web3 is going to require an overall computer architecture that allows us to have the ability to build large scale applications that can rival and supplant web two. And that's going to take us several more years to get there. But if you look at the evolutions that are going around the metropolitan ethereum ecosystem, there's clear evidence that we will get there, and hopefully faster than anyone anticipates. Okay, so with that, I'm happy to take a few questions. I'm also happy to go for lunch. Thanks.
00:10:03.364 - 00:10:04.318, Speaker A: Great talk.
00:10:04.484 - 00:10:20.558, Speaker D: So I know that stable coins are also a very hot topic, especially with onboarding. Developing nations are looking into it as well. How do you see that playing out with regards to just the broader ecosystem and landscape for crypto?
00:10:20.654 - 00:10:26.466, Speaker B: So if you look at metamask download. So we don't track user data in metamask.
00:10:26.498 - 00:10:26.694, Speaker C: Right.
00:10:26.732 - 00:11:24.440, Speaker B: But if someone downloads, but we can see when someone downloads a piece of software where the downloads coming from. The highest growth areas geographically for metamask tend to be emerging economies. So Nigeria, Thailand, the Philippines, India. So I don't think it's a question. So it's great that we can go out and build stablecoins and solutions that go and target people, but what's happening, I think, from a practical reality is if you don't have access to anything and then something is available, you're going to go and try it. So, sure, stablecoins are great and they help a lot, but that onboarding in underserved financial economies is happening with or without it, because the need is so great. Next question.
00:11:25.530 - 00:11:36.570, Speaker A: Between the different dkems, do you think the main determining factor for which projects will be first time market, or is there a different throughput or price aspect?
00:11:37.170 - 00:12:02.742, Speaker B: Right now, the goal in the ZKE EVM market is to win the marketing competition. So, look, if you look at what happened in e two clients, right, there is a big network effect of being first. There is clearly a big network effect of getting first, which is why people are announcing main nets with products that are not feature complete.
00:12:02.876 - 00:12:03.414, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:03.532 - 00:12:47.470, Speaker B: So we don't really know how ZkevM l two s will actually work. We won't. And we get to go and have these discussions with all the other people that are building them. And should it be one standard and allow us to run multiple zkvms on one, some collaborative l two, or are people going to build at specific chains, or will you build it into a wallet or into a dex? We don't know the answers to that. So what's happening is everyone's announcing main nets in order to try and achieve what you were saying, which is to be first to market whether or not the product is done right. It's a very traditional hack. Back in the used to say if you put it into PowerPoint, you've implemented it in software.
00:12:47.550 - 00:12:48.180, Speaker C: Right.
00:12:49.990 - 00:13:03.110, Speaker B: But that is where we are. There is a very hard set of technical problems to solve that are being solved in the context of a much larger set of scaling solutions for Ethereum.
00:13:03.190 - 00:13:03.482, Speaker C: Right.
00:13:03.536 - 00:13:21.870, Speaker B: Like what was modularity, separation of the layers, et cetera, et cetera. And then there's this desire to be first to mainnet for sure. And that is about trying to win market share in the marketing war, regardless of who has the best technical solution.
00:13:27.470 - 00:13:31.440, Speaker A: If somebody donates there.
00:14:01.200 - 00:14:21.860, Speaker B: The follow up question, of course, is when? Token. But I think we have time for one more question, and with that lunch.
