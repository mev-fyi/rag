00:00:00.720 - 00:00:08.610, Speaker A: What's up? The stream is live. I think we're live. We're live. How are you both doing?
00:00:10.270 - 00:00:11.926, Speaker B: Very well. How about you?
00:00:11.958 - 00:00:35.280, Speaker A: Learn? Good, good. Okay, so we have joined today to talk to the carbonable team about what they are up to, titled nfts on Stocknet with carbon Bulba. It's misleading. It should be real world assets on stocknet with comparable. Let's start with introduction. Do each of you want to just introduce yourselves and give a bit of a background of who you are, where you're from?
00:00:37.140 - 00:00:59.064, Speaker B: Sure thing. Very happy to be here. Thanks, Aaron. Thanks. Starperknet. Guillaume, co founder of Carbon engineering background, french engineering background and then moved to Canada, did an MBA over there and we're doing like 810 years leading digital products, always involved. Also on the.
00:00:59.064 - 00:01:19.240, Speaker B: On the environmental front, did some. Some work at the board of a non profit on that front and also some consulting for Care International. And at some point, like along with Ramsey, the opportunity to actually bridge those two worlds, digital and environmental and through carbonous.
00:01:21.930 - 00:01:50.066, Speaker C: I think I take the second run. So yeah, it's really interesting because we're not the common engineer coming in the space. So we are coming from. Actually we did the same school with Guillaume before he went to the commercial schools. So we did industrial engineering. So our specialization is more on the supply chain side, let's say. In the beginning, again, for us, from my side, I stayed from this side of the force, let's say, worked around ten years in the industrial sector.
00:01:50.066 - 00:02:30.676, Speaker C: So for PNG, then coti and total energy. So main part of it was in the retail side, working of information system master data. I did all the roles in supply chain, actually in master data and systems in this case. And I finished by being the supply chain director for. For Europe, for France, plus Benelux, to be honest. And it was some transportation variants on the Europe side. So we are pretty pragmatic, focused on operation and yeah, when we talk with Guillaume, and I'm teasing a little bit, the story that's after.
00:02:30.676 - 00:03:06.060, Speaker C: So we saw that they could be like there was a gap in the ecosystem of the sustainability based on having the right informational systems to manage the assets. And actually with what we came from, we had a lot of discussion with the players on the ground, let's say, and come with an idea of bridging integrity, scalable integrity with the real life usage, more supply chain applicated to the real world assets that is specific to the environmental assets. And here we are with carbonable.
00:03:07.720 - 00:03:15.300, Speaker A: Awesome. You said a lot of stuff with Fulan Pac. But first they. How did the two of you meet? You went to school together?
00:03:15.960 - 00:03:30.112, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Like super simple. We were at the engineering school together, created bonds. Like we were friends. We've been friends for over now, what, 17 years or something? So, yeah, it's been a while. We're okay.
00:03:30.136 - 00:03:30.464, Speaker A: Wow.
00:03:30.552 - 00:03:42.146, Speaker B: Yeah. Long friends and partners and yeah, it came naturally. They. Oh, you muted Larry, Ellie and Uri.
00:03:42.178 - 00:03:49.350, Speaker A: Have joked to me that they spend more time, co founders spend more time with each other than husband and wife do.
00:03:52.410 - 00:03:56.394, Speaker C: Yeah. Okay.
00:03:56.442 - 00:04:17.790, Speaker A: And then the. I want to talk higher level before starknet, how did you get, what are carbon credits? You know, even I think people take for granted because it's in the news so often. Let's assume the average person missing doesn't even know what they are. What are these carbon credits? Who's buying them? What's the whole market looking like?
00:04:18.850 - 00:04:48.958, Speaker B: It's a very good question. That's good to start with this, actually. So not to over complexify things, there are two types of carbon markets. There is the carbon, like the regulatory carbon market and the voluntary carbon market. Regulatory carbon market is more so a carpentry type of market where, you know, companies have a limit of emissions. They can do, if they go beyond, they have to pay. If they go under, they can sell those good performance to other companies.
00:04:48.958 - 00:04:50.846, Speaker B: So that's like the regulatory market.
00:04:50.918 - 00:04:56.610, Speaker A: Are these limits set on a national level or like a international standards?
00:04:57.840 - 00:05:31.060, Speaker B: So we are specializing more so on the other market. But to answer your question, indeed, it's per type of like, it's per geography. There's not like an international, let's say regulatory market. It's more so like PI type. Like, so you have North America, you have EU, you have all this. And so the intent here really is to put a price on emissions and to, you know, sort of put an incentive for companies to reduce their emissions. So that's like, that's one side of the carbon market and that's the one that has been the most famous for.
00:05:31.060 - 00:06:39.226, Speaker B: And there's been a lot of accusation of greenwashing because the idea is like, okay, but where does the money of those taxes go to? Like, the idea is like, it doesn't go necessarily to actual, like true solutions. It's more so like money, you know, generated based on emissions. And on the contrary, you have like the voluntary carbon market. And that has been designed to actually finance solutions that either absorb or avoid carbon credits, avoid carbon emissions. So to make it simple, it fits into what we call what is called the net zero road. That has been pushed by the EU, that has been pushed by the cop, cop 28 and one of all the cops lately where you've had those commitments since Paris, agreements of, okay, we need a common net zero by 2050 if we want to go below two degrees increase in the atmosphere. And so with that net zero, what does that mean? It means any company generates emissions.
00:06:39.226 - 00:07:15.352, Speaker B: And those emissions, even if you reduce them at the maximum capacity, you will have what we call incompressible emissions. Know, you're a human, you generate carbon. We use computers, they generate carbon. Any activities generate carbon in a way. So we can reduce them to the top, to the minimal level, which is going to be like the incompressible level. And you will use those then carbon credits to actually counterbalance those leftover in terms of emissions. So what you cannot reduce, you will actually finance solutions that either absorb or avoid carbon emissions.
00:07:15.352 - 00:07:47.310, Speaker B: And so another way to put it is like carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is sort of like an asset that drives investments or funding into solutions that remove or absorb carbon. So they are like crucial. If you look like, if you look at the latest reports by the biggest scientists of the world, IPCC or whatnot, this plays a critical role in our civilization to actually reach a. Okay. Level of global warming.
00:07:49.130 - 00:08:14.900, Speaker A: Gotcha. Okay, so there's basically this whole market for you to get to net zero. You finance these projects, can offset your emissions. And you're a happy person. Very. No, it's super interesting, the two, to understand that, like this, um, this market has come up. Like, I don't think, I think I spoke to you a few weeks ago about it offline.
00:08:14.900 - 00:08:31.860, Speaker A: I always imagine this, well, we own that first direction where you're basically paying, paying fines, effectively for emitting carbon here, emit your carbon just being at zero through other efforts and finances efforts, and that can create jobs and, and do good stuff as well.
00:08:33.040 - 00:09:15.818, Speaker B: But to this point, maybe, and maybe it might lead to the next question is. So that is the concept. And the concept is really like, per se virtuous. It's you finding solutions that help, you know, reduce global warning and stuff. This is really like, well thought. The truth is, like, the execution is a different story since then. Like, the fact is, up to now, we could consider that this market has been and is still a little bit like the Far west, where you have countless of players which are all disconnected, all stating things, but not necessarily having the data to actually prove it or reliable data to base your decision on.
00:09:15.818 - 00:10:08.520, Speaker B: And so that's why a big problem that we're resolving with Carbonomol is to bring data integrity, to bring proofs of validity. And so of course, through startnet and Renz is going to be very well placed to explain the ins and outs of this. But on top of that, it's also like to enable action. So reinforcing trust because huge trust issue in this market and reinforcing easiness of action because right now it's super complex to understand and super complex to execute. So our mission really at carbon Noble is and will be like to empower organizations and individuals to move from environmental commitments to a provable action. So in here there is really like action and provo.
00:10:09.820 - 00:10:47.102, Speaker C: I think it's right. Yeah, maybe just quickly. On addition, I think there is a big, it's key to understand a little bit the philosophy of the carbon credit. As Guillaume said, the importance of putting in our financial parts, including in the p and l, the cost of the pollution generated, the emission of CO2, to be able to balance it. The best theory we have, the better one, the scientific one, is to be able to achieve carbon neutrality. We should reduce, but also calculate a way to offset the emission for the non reductive. Okay.
00:10:47.102 - 00:11:29.550, Speaker C: And my previous boss at PNG industry was saying there is no bad theory, there's always only bad execution. And the topic we are facing now is why do we see greenwashing? Why do people think about bullshit or thing like this when we are talking about carbon credit? It's because it's not working. The execution of the plan, of the strategy of the company that tried to go on this market failed. And we had a lot of stories in the news. And all of this goes to wrong execution. And wrong execution don't comes from the fact that people are trying to do things bad. It comes from the fact that people, our organization are limited in terms of capability.
00:11:29.550 - 00:12:15.950, Speaker C: Are we in space where the capability that is required? Right here we are, we are talking about traceability, about transparency, about integrity, is the trust, it's the lack of trust of world ecosystem. We know it's really interesting in the money side because you have a lot of different counterparts and a lot of people decentralized. And it may be we will discuss after about the people that are needed to run this complex market. But this market is complex. They require a lot of people on it. And today, the technology we have, the classical one, the centralized one, is limited. And people using it cannot achieve this execution.
00:12:15.950 - 00:13:13.130, Speaker C: And are facing issue coming from a lot of different, a point of friction regarding the trust. And what we are trying to do, and this is what we will serve with carbonab, our role is to find a way to proper execution to guarantee the integrity, and we will deep dive into it. But it's important to differentiate the philosophy, the theory, which is interesting, pretty good and scientifically correct, versus the execution, the previous execution. And why is the execution not working and what could be a solution or a good exploration. And you are not the only one thinking about how decentralized infrastructure could help achieving this kind of interoperable and trustless mechanism. We try to answer it with integrity and scalable integrity. So this is all about it.
00:13:13.550 - 00:13:38.990, Speaker A: What I love is that you've defined the problem so well before. You've talked about the solution, which in this industry of the blockchain, often people, they don't formalize the exact problems that they're solving. So you've done a good deep dive into the problems. Explain to us how blockchain, and maybe specifically how stocknet solves all of these pain points and issues that you described.
00:13:42.370 - 00:14:42.136, Speaker C: We were talking about where we struggle in term of challenges for the execution. The challenges for the execution is to have the right operational system. Okay, so the operating system that fits the needs and the usage of the field of the, we call it the metier, but I forget the name, Guillaume if you have it, how we say metier, but the skills or the capability in general. So the challenge is how the companies could operate in one system to guarantee an operable data and where you can trust the data you are reading. Because the challenges and the lack of challenging and the lack of operating, why it's not a success. It's coming from the fact that you don't trust the data and because of the fact that you lose information when you exchange them with other counterparts. So this is where it comes from.
00:14:42.136 - 00:15:20.882, Speaker C: So far as the blockchain, and we're going to talk about stocknet, we lost. Okay, continuing on that, on that topic. But the question was, I'm continuing the question on why we are using the blockchain. And it's a really interesting, important question. Why do we need the blockchain? So the layer of technology we are working on to provide the services is how we could. What is interesting in it is to provide integrity on the data, to have an operational data, to trace the data. We are manipulating the assets, but also to be able to interoperate with other counterparts.
00:15:20.882 - 00:16:18.082, Speaker C: When you are talking about carbon credits, the end to end process is pretty huge. The life cycle of a carbon credit is pretty huge. It goes from the measurements to measure your emissions to the funding to the generation on the registry of the certifier. Because this is not a tangible asset. The current credit is synthetic based on the certification made by a specialist of the market, what you call the certifier that will put his legal certification on the fact that certain type of trees have been planted and that he recognized it and it went until the exchange for the brokers and the usage and after the auditability. On that topic, you have many companies, many project holders, many certifiers and so on. And so there is a lot of standards that are different.
00:16:18.082 - 00:16:54.044, Speaker C: So why the blockchain? The blockchain is the need is simple, is to provide like standards and integrity and security. Actually the blockchain for us, it's like a database that provides the security and that is interoperable. So this is the secret. And when we talk blockchain, we are manipulating data. Okay, so we are doing applicative, like an ERP, what you are calling an ERP that is decentralized. It's not possible to we need security, but we cannot pay a lot of money for simple transaction of data. There is no money in it.
00:16:54.044 - 00:17:45.830, Speaker C: So it's only about costing. And when we are talking about security and cost and application for us, it's simple to understand that what we need when we are doing this, it's having access to scalable integrity. So how we can provide scalable security to data when we are doing applicative. And for us the insert is pretty clear. It's whether we go on a L2 or even on an app chain. And for us, Stacknet is a right challenger for that topic, because we are doing, we are irritating from security of Ethereum and having access to a cost and scalable access to accessibility to the security. And another topic that is interesting, but to be honest, we're here on Stacknet for that topic.
00:17:45.830 - 00:18:24.030, Speaker C: But the other point is regarding the energetical efficiency, the zero knowledge when you are doing consensus is meant to be more efficient of providing security when you are comparing security and energy consumed to provide this level of security. So a lot of things that make sense and value shared that where we need to go on the blockchain and where it's important for us to be efficient in terms of energy consumption and access to integrity on a lot of data.
00:18:26.450 - 00:18:58.510, Speaker A: Laughing as you're saying it, like the irony of doing this on a proof of work blockchain. It would be very sad to see that happend. Guillaume, can you talk about the user experience? I assume that your target market is not a stock net degen, or maybe also. But in addition to that, you're looking at non crypto native teams, companies, individuals. How has their onboarding experience been like?
00:18:59.890 - 00:19:55.750, Speaker B: That's a very good point. Just to summarize in a different way what Rosnia said, and it will actually go into the direction, you know, we have like, let's say two type of, if we break it down, like carbonable is sort of like the backbone, technological backbone is powered by Starknet. This is like the infrastructure that we're building to provide integrity into, like to prove the integrity of the data. And on top of that, we are building different, you know, applications and services that we offer to our targets. Our targets are indeed, let's say, to summarize, we have two main targets. One, which is the historical one, the one we've started with, which was actually users. So funders, funders being individuals or small companies, we provided them access, and we still do provide them access to trusted funding opportunities.
00:19:55.750 - 00:20:33.138, Speaker B: So one part of the value prop that we offer is, okay, we're going to find great projects trusted because they go through our technology. And you will be able to prove the integrity of these projects from a to z. And we will make it accessible, whatever the budget, by leveraging, let's say some sort of like web3 crowdfunding. If we make it simple, that's how we've started. And we still continue that because there is a market fit. There is a strong need for individuals and for corporations of all sorts. Now, the second target is the one that we've developed recently.
00:20:33.138 - 00:21:30.118, Speaker B: And the one we see also huge potential is actually like the ERP piece, and for that is like operating system for large corporations and large funds to operate their carbon assets. So if we make it simple, you're a company, you have like, you know, million tons of CO2 to offset every year. You will invest into like several projects, into several offsetting solutions to manage all of this, all the different projects under one umbrella and monitor them and report on them, et cetera, is a nightmare. Today. What they're using is Excel sheets and if not, nothing. So what we're doing is we're making it like we're modelizing those assets, bringing them all together under one umbrella, and helping them to drive their offsetting strategies from a to Zenith seamlessly and with integrity. And so in both cases, the UX is super keen.
00:21:30.118 - 00:22:44.474, Speaker B: Like it's super important for large corporations. Our goal is actually like, you know, blockchain abstraction in a way, because those users, they don't like, they almost don't need to know, you know, what is the technology below? And they don't need to have like those blockers of, you know, like a web3 native type of application. So we're working hard on this to make it as seamless as possible for non one three users to leverage carbon and for the individual ones, which was the first target that we discussed. We started as web3 native. We still have this, but we're moving towards a goal as well, which is blockchain free in a way, because the idea is anybody could be interested in funding nature based solutions. It's not like we don't want it to be like web3 specific, it's just like web3 is the technology behind, like it's the backbone that is empowering concrete action and seamless action. And so that's really like our, our goal is we know that we're building pioneering technology, but we want it to seem as seamless as possible and to feel as, you know, like just web whatever, two three.
00:22:44.474 - 00:22:50.190, Speaker B: We don't mind, it's just like it needs to feel seamless for any type of user.
00:22:51.690 - 00:23:30.516, Speaker C: Just a quick addition on the user. What is important. So of course the main user that you are targeting is the b two b because he's the one that need to manage his asset, he's the one that need to run his accounting regarding emission versus offsetting. But actually at the end, the end user is the citizen. So for us, having an access to integrity is important for everyone. So when you are buying a brand and this brand is saying that it's carbon neutral, for now you can only trust it. So you have to trust this brand and you have to trust what is behind, et cetera.
00:23:30.516 - 00:24:11.636, Speaker C: So what if you could verify it and you could be sure that when you are going to an event and this event is carbon neutral, that you know how it's happening. And this is the idea to give access to everyone. This is a usage, but also usage could be something that is interesting. So companies need to do two things to offset. So because it's a financial decision, okay, so based on your available cash, you decide to anticipate your future emission or to pay on the spot market for current emission. And you need spot market and the spot market needs forward funding actually. And it could come from the institution, it could come from the company themselves, but also citizen could be involved in it.
00:24:11.636 - 00:24:53.530, Speaker C: Imagine tomorrow when you are trying to provide your, put your savings in the real world assets, you can put it for now on actions, on options. And what if you could also put it on. You can put it in real estate, but the idea is also to provide green position for the future and for your savings. And this could be also like an evolvement of the citizen from the beginning to the end of the process. So we are exploring all the users, but of course we are focusing on one thing is addressing big corporation and also addressing blockchain free accessibility to our user.
00:24:54.750 - 00:25:18.278, Speaker A: One example I like to use is that you don't know. You go on a website, you don't know if they're using MySQL or postgres or node JS in the background. You don't care. The way I perceive it, you are not a blockchain company. You are credits platform. You happen to use blockchain in the bank because it's the best solution out there. You have to use Stocknet specifically when.
00:25:18.294 - 00:25:49.410, Speaker C: You are using your bank account on the phone. For example, we have revolut in France that is called revolut. But I think a lot of other application exists. You don't care about what is the technology behind. You're just putting your savings and you just want to be exposed to Tesla for example, and you don't figure out what is the technology behind. So the idea, if it's more efficient with the blockchain, why not to go through it? The idea is that whether on the blockchain or not on the blockchain is not about infrastructure efficiency. And for now I think it's that efficiency is from the, from this side.
00:25:49.910 - 00:25:52.010, Speaker A: Speaking to your go ahead. Yeah.
00:25:53.070 - 00:27:04.926, Speaker B: To go further on, what you just said is it's hard for us to define ourselves, to be honest, because we are a web 3d company in the sense that we are really powered by and we've invested a lot of time, money, et cetera, in it, because we know all the value it provides and also indeed the end users don't care about it for the most part. So it's tricky because we define ourselves both on the web3 fronts. What pushes us even, why we don't want to say we're not a web3 company is because what we're building is an infra. And this infra so far is serving carbon offset as a purpose, because this is the immediate need and most crucial need that we've addressed through this. But we know that we could leverage it for other use cases in the future as well. So that's where it's just to say we are a combination of indeed carbon offset specific one and web3 powered. And who knows, in some time the infrared we're building could be used for other use cases of carbon upset specifically.
00:27:04.926 - 00:27:38.500, Speaker B: I'm just saying, for example, biodiversity credits. This is another type of credits that will, that will arrive water credits generating proofs of integrity on the sustainability front from other type of data providers. There are so many, let's say other use cases that we've identified already that we could leverage our infra for. So that's why I just wanted to say we're, we're really like at the intersection and we define ourselves as a web3 powered, indeed, like offset specific solution.
00:27:41.520 - 00:28:16.232, Speaker A: Yeah. Here you say you don't want to limit yourselves, so you don't be just a carbon credits company. You want to be real world assets more broadly. Okay, let's just, practically speaking, an institution comes and wants to buy credits on your platform or finance a program on your platform. Are they downloading a account abstraction wallet on stocknet? Are they just doing it on your end? And then you're like, practically speaking, how do they need to have the user experience on the blockchain side is just.
00:28:16.256 - 00:28:55.810, Speaker C: Abstracted away from them for the governance of big companies. So the maturity is still been building up. Okay, so we are discussing with them, the CTO is not, is not used, let's say, to the usage. It could be something frightening and so on. So as we said, for now we are working on providing a UX that is blockchain free and adapted to the IT governance, the corporate IT governance procedures and so on. So we are trying to do like vulgarization and exploration with them. So, which is interesting because we are addressing like something that is not business critical, but is important for us, for them.
00:28:55.810 - 00:29:30.046, Speaker C: So it's interesting to have a use case like ours to like build maturity on the blockchain ecosystem, let's say. So for now we are doing it the tricky way. We are providing like you doing it for them. So this is the v one version of how we could onboard them on the blockchain. So they have services, but they can have approach to the dashboard, to the reports and so on. And when they digitalize it, we manage them. We manage it for them now by ourselves in the beginning.
00:29:30.046 - 00:29:40.518, Speaker C: And the idea is to provide them to like to help them to level up and to build maturity on it little by little. Okay.
00:29:40.654 - 00:29:50.490, Speaker A: Makes sense. And there's a lot of benefits. Even if they're not behind the scenes, they still have the verifiability, the immutability and they can inspect the transactions, etcetera.
00:29:50.950 - 00:30:37.054, Speaker B: And that's, and that's true for the, for the big players with who were working, but for the more so like you know, SME's small and medium enterprises, some of them are actually already like geared up with stocknet wallets. And our goal, and to go back to our question like, you know, our discussion right before the why also we're, we're sort of at the intersection because our aspiration is really to bring on board as many off chain companies as possible on chain in a way and through in a way that they don't feel it. But the goal is to bring a lot of real world TvL to the web3 ecosystem through this use case, which is actually critical for big corporations.
00:30:37.222 - 00:31:27.436, Speaker C: Very good point Guillaume, because we don't imagine what is behind the impact for companies. So the first question you had with small companies because we have an opportunity for them, for the small one, because what they are doing is that they are answering RFQ. So to big offers and today being carbon neutral means they participate to the roadmap of the carbon neutrality of bing companies. So they can win like offers easier with us with an easy access to carbon neutrality than they were used to and they can do it also for their employees and so on. But today having convincing small companies to have a stacknet address is pretty easy. But we don't imagine that the accounting need to have information how they manage it, how they manage NFT that is related to real world assets. So we are working also on that side.
00:31:27.436 - 00:31:57.936, Speaker C: So we decided to make a note with our accounting to explain how you manage the carbon asset that are digitalized on the blockchain. So for example. But it's really interesting. But for now what is really interesting is that it's working so they don't have any pushback from that side. But it's a lot of work. It's a lot of it's. The road is long to have it really easy for them to understand from things for all the impact it could have externally for them.
00:31:57.936 - 00:32:03.860, Speaker C: And we are doing the work taking charge of all of this, of course, makes sense.
00:32:05.120 - 00:32:14.990, Speaker A: Shifting gears, can you talk about the competitive landscape? Are there other teams doing similar stuff in general more broadly and more specifically using blockchain as the backend?
00:32:19.130 - 00:32:21.190, Speaker C: Yum, you're on mute again.
00:32:26.130 - 00:33:17.800, Speaker B: Yeah. So 1st, first and foremost, let's say overall technological agnostic wise, we are some of the pioneers on the actual, like carbon assets management. There's been a lot of players playing like there are a lot of players already into the, you know, helping companies find projects that this is a market which is, you know, 3d let's say crowded. The, once you've invested, how do you manage all of this? How do you make it into like a seamless, you know, like a resource planning system? We are pioneers, truth be told. There are not so many. And we are realizing that actually, like, all the big companies that are working with us are realizing the need as we speak. So we, you know, we're sort of the first movers, let's say one of the first movers.
00:33:17.800 - 00:33:54.100, Speaker B: And now, obviously, like, you know, more and more companies are starting to realize that there is a big need. And of course, they're, they're, they're starting to move on in that direction. That said, we have a very strong competitive advantage is that we, we are web3 native. We've started, like with this. And any other companies that are currently, currently starting to move on that front are web two powered. And in that case, they don't answer one of the main need of the market, which is trust. And so that's why we think we have, we think we hear it from the different companies we're working with.
00:33:54.100 - 00:34:39.855, Speaker B: We are first movers on the operational front and we are ahead in the technological front. So we are in good position. Let's say this is our, our goal, bold and simple, is to become the authority in the, you know, carbon assets management. And so that's why also, like, we are actually, like, we're going to start a run. We're going to start a run show for fundraising. Number two, actually, like fairly soon because we've onboarded some, like, giant companies. We have a pipeline, which is very big, and we've done it with a team, let's say fairly small.
00:34:39.855 - 00:34:51.739, Speaker B: What we want to do now is to accelerate both on the technological front and the commercial front. So that's, let's say the next big move on our side is fundraise to actually accelerate.
00:34:52.399 - 00:34:57.979, Speaker A: If any teams listening are investors, please feel free to reach out after this call.
00:34:58.530 - 00:34:59.550, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:35:00.650 - 00:35:08.670, Speaker A: Starkware, I think, are proud investors. In your previous round, that was, I think, two years ago. And if you want to give an overview of the historical funding.
00:35:09.890 - 00:35:52.690, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. We've started with, it was like a pre seed round, mainly business angels. Then we did a seed round a bit more than a year ago, and that's where startware actually entered. And in that round, it was also involving, like, two other key players. One of the web3 front, which is ether adventures, and another one on the more institutional front, which is exchange, which is like a big, like, european, let's say, institutional DC. So those like, and it was our wish, let's say, to have both like a web3 fund and a institutional one, because this is like we were right at the intersection of both worlds.
00:35:53.790 - 00:36:25.340, Speaker A: That's a very beautifully said. Okay. Practically speaking, apparently there are 2000 people listening at some point. Now, I assume the average person there is not a CFO of a big multinational co op looking to buy offset their carbon emissions. So for the average retailer listening here, what can they do on carbon? Apparently you have this green chip campaign going on. How can they get started? Can you tell us more about the campaign, what they can do, how they can get involved?
00:36:26.640 - 00:37:04.010, Speaker B: Yeah, so a bit more like back where we were saying, we have two main targets. Number one is like individuals and small and medium companies and other is like big corporations. So let's focus on the individuals and small and medium companies. We are a gateway to trusted and tailored funding of carbon assets. So you're an individual and you want to offset your own emissions. You can do it through a carbonable, you're a company and you want to offset your emissions. You want to plan your offsetting for the next decades at a lower cost than what you would do by buying carbon credits on spot market.
00:37:04.010 - 00:37:38.100, Speaker B: You can fund tailored projects through carbonable. So that's one big way, let's say, to first kick off your interaction with, with carbonable to do so. Quite easy. You're a company and you're wishing to invest into tailored projects. Reach out to us. We have actually already a bank of projects that we can activate your individuals. Wait for the next public funding that we will publish.
00:37:38.100 - 00:38:28.238, Speaker B: Kara, two, rule one was one, we ended it. So it raised over three hundred sixty k. I don't have the official number, but 369k, something like that. This was like the funding of a project which is a mangrove project in Myanmar. Very prime project, super good in terms of social impact, super good in terms of biodiversity impact by a project developer that has run already like several projects. And the idea here for the investors was to get a supply of carbon assets. And those carbon assets, then as an owner, you can either use them for offset purposes or you can say you can, hey, carbonable, please find some buyers for those carbon credits.
00:38:28.238 - 00:38:31.770, Speaker B: And in that case, we tap into our network of B. Two B.
00:38:32.350 - 00:39:13.106, Speaker C: This is the DGN mode, let's say, of Carbonab. You can do it. What you are doing is enabling, providing you access to like investment opportunity that you don't have access in general that is reserved like say to big corporations that are doing it by themselves because it requires a lot of legolandity, infrastructural costs that are pretty big. So what we are making it is that we are dividing it and using the blockchain to guarantee the same level of ownership that you can have with legal entity and so on, and making it accessible. So DGN Mod, you want to be exposed to this market. It's easy to do it. So for now you could go on the secondary market and buy position in project to be able to have.
00:39:13.106 - 00:40:00.766, Speaker C: There is like three different projects. I think for four different projects at that moment you can choose, do your own research and be exposed to one of the project you trust will make the difference. I think we are choosing it like pretty precisely and doing the due diligence also on it. But it's your decision, we are providing the opportunity and you take the responsibility and you take the decision to be exposed to it. And what you are betting when you are doing this is that the regulation that is coming will push all the companies to find very quickly solutions to offset their emission, to be compliant with the regulation. And that the price of the carbon credit could increase. And if you want to be exposed on it.
00:40:00.766 - 00:40:37.424, Speaker C: So in your degen, you can also take this scenario and be, and be exposed it. And the idea what we are offering you with carbonab is to do it like in the proper way, in the proper way, but also to expose you to the reality. So what you are at the core of what you are doing is the integrity. So if the project fails. So for example, when you are buying a house, if the house burned, you lose the opportunity because something happened to the house. When you fund a project of regenerative nature, if the forest burn, there is a risk. The risk is not huge, but there is a risk.
00:40:37.424 - 00:40:54.080, Speaker C: If something happened and we are putting the right thing to monitor the thing. Because what will put the value in the carbon credit? It's the trust. The more trust you have in the carbon credit, the more cost efficiency it becomes. And this is what we want to provide. So it comes with a risk. So you can lose your things. But it's in line with the reality.
00:40:54.080 - 00:41:27.880, Speaker C: And what you are offering carbon, with carbonab is infrastructure to be exposed properly to this market. And you can choose whether you want to be a DJN and to invest in it and in the future. And how your savings working for the planet and for your, and for your money, let's say. But you can also use it for cost efficiency. And to say, okay, I want to be carbon neutral in 20 years and I start today because it will be cost. It will cost really much more in the future. So I start being positioned today and, and it will be like a good decision in the future.
00:41:28.220 - 00:42:01.610, Speaker B: That's a good way to put it. And we use it and companies are using it is the cost of inaction. All forecasts are clear. Price is going to increase. And it's not like by two or three, it's like all forecasts are saying tens and more. So the cost of inaction for a company to nothing act today is pretty significant. And so that's why like big corporations now are moving as of today, planning their, their net zero.
00:42:01.610 - 00:42:48.710, Speaker B: And so that's why I think like more, so like more and more now, small and medium companies are realizing also that they should as of now. And if you look at this like the cost of opportunity is actually vice versa for investors. And so that's why like, I not only like the gens, you have actually funds, you have big funds which are investing in those nature based solutions and like carbon removal projects because they know that investing in projects right now is going to generate carbon assets, which value is going to increase like drastically over the next years and decades. So this opportunity is both like a risk for big companies and an opportunity for investors. And of course, like we are addressing both depending on the hats that you're wearing and you want to interact carbon with.
00:42:50.410 - 00:43:43.930, Speaker A: Interesting. So if you want to buy some credits today, had your exposure for 20 years, whatever it is, go to Carbonball today. Very nice. We're running out of time. Do either of you want to share some final comments? What I didn't mention probably some more formal announcements to go on around this, but starkware as a company is in the process of purchasing carbon credits on carbonable, both in the spot market and also in the financing category. And we are also on this journey learning a lot about this whole world of carbonous credits, of protecting the world, protecting the environment. And we discovered you because of stockinette, obviously.
00:43:43.930 - 00:43:48.610, Speaker A: But it's been a nice journey and a nice outcome.
00:43:50.030 - 00:44:03.970, Speaker B: And we are really delighted to collaborate by our technology provider. In a way, if we make it simple, you know, it's a natural, you know, binding.
00:44:04.950 - 00:44:46.370, Speaker C: What we like about being here and being, showing the value we have in common is about the integrity and the notion of going beyond the commitments. We don't want to say we are contributing to carbon neutrality. We want to go on the proving side, prove your action instead of commit on what you will do. And this is what you are trying also to build, prove you scale ethereum instead of selling it. I like also the comparison to other ecosystem. So this is what we bring and this is the shared value that we trying to work on before, before we go special mention to all the teams. So we are a lot working in carbonable and we are always the boats facing, facing the camps and the things.
00:44:46.370 - 00:46:02.452, Speaker C: But today we have like we are around twelve people working. We are going to the south next week of France altogether, by the way, and to have a good time. But a big part of the team is a technical team, of course, but we are having also people that are working in finance, in working with the corporates, at the events and so on and that are doing a great job with all the patients of trying to contribute to make this theory and this execution better than it is today and to enable actions toward reducing carbon emission and finding ways to limit, to find ways to the objective of carbon neutrality and so on. And special mention also to the teams today. It's also important and it's also let know people that we are not only two and that we are twelve working on it. We are a young company, of course, but working with the major players on the industrial ecosystem and sectors, mainly in France for now, because, you know, Europe is like maybe mainly leading the regulation toward this. Europe is good at doing a lot of regulation, but it has its good side.
00:46:02.452 - 00:46:22.890, Speaker C: So we try to be the standards and we try also to lobby our standards to say, hey, this is how integrity could be included in the process and process the interest of having a scalable one is pretty interesting. So this is awesome.
00:46:23.830 - 00:46:50.690, Speaker A: Well, that was a great note to end off with. So if people want to learn more, they can check you out on Twitter, go to your website and also reach out to me on the stockware team. We can direct you over to the Commonwealth team. We're looking forward to hearing about your successful fundraiser. Hopefully some big partnerships and happy that this is all being secured and verified on Stocknet.
00:46:52.190 - 00:46:54.390, Speaker B: Thank you very much for the opportunity and.
