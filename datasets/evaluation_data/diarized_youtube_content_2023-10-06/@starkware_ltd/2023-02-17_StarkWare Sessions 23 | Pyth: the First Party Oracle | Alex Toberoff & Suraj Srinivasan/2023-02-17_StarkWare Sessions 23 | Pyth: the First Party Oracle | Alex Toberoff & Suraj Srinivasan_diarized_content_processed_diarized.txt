00:00:03.280 - 00:00:10.820, Speaker A: Cool. Hi, guys. My name is Trini Vasin. I graduated from MIT studying math and cs. I'm a researcher at Jump.
00:00:11.320 - 00:00:50.930, Speaker B: I'm Alex Toberoff, graduated from Columbia last year, and I'm also a researcher at Jump. So, kind of broadly, we're both on the R D team where we focus on contributing to open source infrastructure as well as kind of focusing on protocol design in development. And we're both kind of core contributors to pith, which we're going to be talking about today. So the broad agenda can be split into three parts. So the first is going over the general pith architecture, and then kind of what specifically in this architecture makes pith different and unique from sort of other oracles in the crypto? And lastly, what kind of new innovations and protocol design does this pith architecture allow for?
00:00:52.340 - 00:01:36.960, Speaker A: So, fundamentally, we think that defi sort of has this demand for speed. Recently, there's been an explosion in on chain trading, and in order to have longitudinal success, you really need a low latency oracle with accurate pricing for consumers. So pith is an extremely low latency oracle, which we think enables two main things. One is greater capital efficiency, and the other is that it expands the protocol design space. And we'll actually go into an example of how it does so later. So how does Pith fundamentally work? Pith sources data from first parties, so that is trading firms, market makers and exchanges, and they receive their pricing information by interacting with Kex and OTC trades. This information is then published to Pithnet, which Alex will discuss later.
00:01:36.960 - 00:02:11.608, Speaker A: And finally, that price can actually be taken from Pithnet and relate to any destination chain. So we believe that Pith is different than existing Oracle solutions for three main reasons. The first is that Pith leverages first party data publishers. The second is that Pith publishes price feeds that include confidence intervals. And finally, it includes this novel pull based model that we'll get into. So, first of all, as I discussed, pit sources data from over 75 different market data providers, which I'll refer to as mdps. So these are trading firms like Jane street or jump.
00:02:11.608 - 00:02:55.992, Speaker A: They're exchanges like finance gate, IO, Huobi, et cetera. And what that enables us to do is offer the most accurate pricing. The price information that these market data providers are sourcing are directly from the exchange, meaning that pricing on chain is now less susceptible to front running and is ultimately more accurate. Now, what pith also enables is any price feed is provided with a confidence interval as well. Now, Pits currently supports over 190 price feeds that range across cryptos equities, FX and metals. And basically, these confidence intervals enable three main things. So this graph to our top left, the confidence interval that Pitt supports is robust manipulation.
00:02:55.992 - 00:03:49.240, Speaker A: So what does this mean? Basically, if we have a malicious MDP who's reporting far outside of everyone else's range, PIF's price feed will reflect the most accurate price with the highest confidence. That's robust manipulation. The graph you see on the top right shows that PIF's aggregate price weights data sources with different levels of accuracy. So if we have two mdps, the ones in blue and yellow, reporting with extremely high accuracy, and two others in green and red, reporting with much lower accuracy, the pith aggregate price will more accurately reflect higher accuracy. Price feeds. And finally, on the graph on the bottom, we see that the aggregate confidence interval reflects the variation between publishers'prices. So since our mdps are all around the world, we recognize that pricing is different around the world, which means that prices can often be dislocated.
00:03:49.240 - 00:04:01.310, Speaker A: So the confidence interval that pith actually provides varies based on how confident our publishers are and are ultimately robust to manipulation. I'll turn it over to Alex to sort of show how this actually looks and discuss the pull model.
00:04:02.500 - 00:04:42.376, Speaker B: Sure. So this is kind of a live demo of a particular price fee, basically updating on a millisecond time basis. And you can see the actual confidence band kind of getting a little smaller, then expanding as it's going. So you can look at this for any price feed on the pith website, if you're interested. So, kind of going into this kind of novel pull based architecture for pith. First, just to discuss how typically an oracle will work on chain. So effectively, there's some aggregate price computed off chain, and then that gets pushed on chain at fixed intervals, typically by one whitelisted party, obviously depending on the fixed interval.
00:04:42.376 - 00:05:34.236, Speaker B: But typically this is done on the order of every kind of ten to 20 minutes, if we're talking about ethereum. So of course that can lead to a bit of. That can lead to actually quite inaccurate as well as quite inaccurate and stale data. So conversely, for pith, it effectively is this pull based model where Pip operates on this separate on, effectively its own blockchain called pithnet. It then streams the prices, aggregations on on chain that then gets sent through. See, once that's verified, then any entity, any person, no whitelisted entity, can effectively take that verified price, submit it to the pith contract at any point in time. So effectively, what that unlocks is that, let's say I'm a user or I'm a protocol and I'm doing something particularly latency sensitive, like pricing derivatives, for example, then I can take the most up to date price, which would have been up to date, which would have been updated in the, perhaps in the past, like, I don't know, second or so.
00:05:34.236 - 00:06:22.856, Speaker B: So there are a few kind of clear advantages of that. Of course, you have lower latency, safer and far more accurate pricing. So for a lending protocol, for example, it might be a little bit less sensitive to having the most up to date price. This can still have a large impact because you're going from a price that's up to date every 20 minutes to a price that might be at the max like 5 seconds, 5 seconds stale. So we want to present a particular case study that I think is quite illustrative of the difference between this kind of typical push based model and the pull based model that pith is kind of pioneering. So before, the way synthetics typically works, this is sort of at a pretty high level, is that a user will queue a market order for some derivative on the platform. The keeper will then use the last push price to confirm the order and effectively now it works afterwards, same kind of first step on the user.
00:06:22.856 - 00:07:44.730, Speaker B: However, now the keeper, instead of referencing the last push price, which could be up to 20 minutes stale, now they will take the latest kind of on chain price that has been verified, submit it to the pith contract that verifies the price, and then that's considered the new canonical price for that particular price feed. So as a user, I'm getting far better pricing for whatever derivative that I'm trading, and then on the protocols behalf. So for instance, it's quite a bit safer because let's say you have some, in the event of like a liquidation, for example, you could have over a 20 minutes period, there could be quite a large kind of price dislocation between the oracle and the actual true price of true centralized exchange price, which can of course present a lot of liquidation risk of the protocol. So as you can see in this diagram here, it's comparing the sex price for finance pit and then a competitor, Oracle. As you can see, the competitor oracle here is updating kind of on the order of like ten to 20 minutes, and it's kind of this pretty long step function where pith is tracking the sex price pretty accurately. So through this point in time, like let's say between 1420 and around 1430, that's actually a pretty big difference in price that could potentially, let's say it's large size on, like a lending protocol, for example, could lead, could potentially create a lot of bad debt for the protocol itself.
00:07:46.380 - 00:08:25.670, Speaker A: Yeah. So this graph actually came from a report we did for synthetics. And what we find is that on expectation pith price lags, the finance price on expectation on less than 5 seconds, and the competitive oracle at that point, the average on expectation lag from finance or average update time was over 200 seconds and the price dislocation was over 20 basis points. So fundamentally, we believe that pith is an oracle that stands apart due to its more robust data and lower latency price feeds, and ultimately leads to better ux, better capital efficiency and improved protocol design space. We're happy to take any questions. Thank you.
00:08:36.340 - 00:08:47.490, Speaker C: Are there any examples of different ways in which lending protocols and protocols utilize confidence intervals and anything innovative you think new protocols can.
00:08:50.910 - 00:08:51.660, Speaker B: Do?
00:08:52.110 - 00:09:24.470, Speaker A: Yeah. So we think fundamentally, confidence intervals can lead to more effective risk management. So for a given lending protocol, it can be the case that with a far wider confidence interval, you're much less likely to let an individual take out much higher collateralized loan. Given that we saw what happened in mango markets, for example. Right. That sort of thing could have been mitigated with more effective risk mitigation, which is enabled by that confidence interrupt, because, you know, that sort of, that price is varying wildly on centralized exchanges.
00:09:31.450 - 00:09:33.640, Speaker C: Do you have to pull data?
00:09:37.920 - 00:09:38.236, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:09:38.258 - 00:09:56.630, Speaker B: So let's say you're doing something you don't care too much about having the most recent price. Then whoever updated the price last, that's stored as public variable in the pith contract on whichever chain you're using. So you don't actually have to pull it yourself. You could also, of course, run a crank at some particular time step update the price.
00:10:09.590 - 00:10:35.264, Speaker A: Yeah. So we think that bringing pith to Starknet will definitely help to sort of improve the protocol design space, and we hope to, at some point, integrate pith onto Starknet. And, yeah, we'd love to bring this protocol. All right, cool. I think we'll lend our time to the next speaker. Thank you.
00:10:35.302 - 00:10:35.710, Speaker B: Thanks a lot.
