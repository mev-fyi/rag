00:00:11.160 - 00:00:29.345, Speaker A: Hello everyone and welcome to a new episode of Stark Struck, a podcast where we talk about the building journey, we talk about tech in general, blockchains in specific and very specifically, usually about ZK rollups and starknet in particular. Today I'm with Vitaly Yakovlev. Hi Vitaly.
00:00:30.125 - 00:00:31.065, Speaker B: Hi Henry.
00:00:31.405 - 00:00:38.025, Speaker A: And Vitaly is working at zkx. What is exactly you do at zkx, Vitaly?
00:00:39.925 - 00:01:27.451, Speaker B: A lot of things. My official, I have two official heads. The one is the business co founder and under this I do a lot of business development, a lot of education into the ecosystem. I talk a lot with developers, I talk a lot with users, traders. My second official hat that I wear most of the time is I'm the CTO in the business, which means majority of decisions in terms of how we grow the business, how we build the business, how from the technical perspective, the architecture, the technical side is in my commands, I'm in charge. But at the same time I have in every capacity, I have very simple motor in my life. If you are the smartest guy in the room, you're in the wrong room.
00:01:27.451 - 00:01:59.285, Speaker B: And because of that I'm trying to work with people that are much smarter than me, that can think faster than me, that generally better people than me. And through that the team I work with and team I've assembled in the last 2, 3 years from the engineering capacity with the UIU, Extreme Design or whatever it be, I'm super proud. And majority of things we do, I only take false for things we don't deliver. But if we do something great, that's actually their achievement, it's not mine.
00:02:00.145 - 00:02:02.285, Speaker A: Nice. So how many people work at ZKS.
00:02:03.905 - 00:02:52.537, Speaker B: So full time in house? We are I think above 30 now 32, 33. We have a few contributors as well, quite a few. Now majority of we are tech first business, so majority of people we have in the business are engineers. But also we have great marketing team, we have great BT team and business development is the big time and big thing for every blockchain or crypto based business. Simply because there are so many amazing things that are happening in the ecosystem that you need to have someone full time finding these partnerships, finding smart companies doing something very, very amazing or innovative. So this is an important part for the business as well.
00:02:52.681 - 00:02:58.605, Speaker A: Nice. And we didn't say what does zkx? What is zkx? What does ZKX do?
00:03:01.105 - 00:03:03.201, Speaker B: I should give a very simple and.
00:03:03.233 - 00:03:07.033, Speaker A: Clear answer because in a nutshell, what.
00:03:07.049 - 00:03:15.885, Speaker B: It is ZKX in a nutshell is a professional swaps trading platform. Built on stacknet.
00:03:16.225 - 00:03:40.775, Speaker A: Nice. Okay, cool. Thank you. So we'll get deeper into that because it's really fascinating. I know there are a few people attempting to build one, but it's a big task and I'm really keen to hear on how you're tackling this. Before we dive into this, I'm curious to hear a bit more about you. Can you tell us what's your background? Where, what did you study?
00:03:41.875 - 00:04:22.332, Speaker B: Sure. How much time? No, I'm kidding. I'll try to be very, very, very quick with that one. I think everything that happened in my life had a precursor for that and had a reason for it to happen. I've studied in the, in Saint Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation. The reason why I got there is I've got my first computer when I was 6 years old and it was very basic thing. It was BK1001 or something like that.
00:04:22.332 - 00:04:57.979, Speaker B: It was 16 bits, I think it's 16 bit PDP11 compatible. It had no, it had no interface ports, it had no software. It was just very basic thing with literally the only language that was loaded there was basic. It was, I was absolutely exciting and fascinating with that thing. Whatever kid wants to do, I want to do the same. Wants to have games and play these games. There is a small issue that you have no games because there is no applications at this very basic computer.
00:04:57.979 - 00:05:34.035, Speaker B: Which means that naturally if you want to play game, you have to write one yourself. Even if it's like tic tac toe or something very basic, it shouldn't be a problem. But you're a six year old, maybe at the time seven year old and there is no books, there is no manuals, there is no Internet to tap into. So I was super excited and I spent literally a few years trying to get as much information about how I can do things. Copying books and rewriting books. I had, I create my own reference of the language for the basics. I know what I can do with it.
00:05:35.855 - 00:05:37.903, Speaker A: Could you still write in basic today?
00:05:38.039 - 00:05:53.017, Speaker B: I think I can. That's not something I should be proud of, but I think I can. But it was interesting. Amazing time when we didn't even have like cassettes for the, for the, for the, for the programs, for cases. It was like literally audio tape where you can still explode from.
00:05:53.081 - 00:05:57.881, Speaker A: And where do you find those? Like at the library. Would you buy them at a store?
00:05:58.073 - 00:06:52.215, Speaker B: It was mostly in the libraries. And the fun fact, because of that, the first, I shouldn't say commercial application but the first application that had some commercial use, I've created a very basic catalog system for the local library. So one thing after another. It was a time when I discovered either net and built in both systems and that blew my mind because now it's not just me and there is no need to trying to find the book or buy it or order it in the library. You can actually talk to people, you can find things. And that was way before Internet obviously but it was the first real fight on it. Yeah where you have to cope with your modem and it was a BBS style system where you can ask questions and upload files and download things.
00:06:52.215 - 00:07:27.705, Speaker B: Having, being a kid having the. It was initially it was tally with some keyboards and then it was the. I think the biggest upgrades was when I managed to get myself was it386sx the first IBM proper computer. That was. I think that was a slippery slope down the hill to be honest. Because when you manage to open this magic box and you have literally unlimited access to things that change you forever. So that was the moment when I decided I would have more of that.
00:07:27.705 - 00:08:05.195, Speaker B: And to quite excitement of my parents I dropped myself into the different school where they had a better math class. But what's more important, they had better computers. They had computers. And through that I was exposed to computer Olympiads, to mathematical Olympiads. And I think that was the first point in my life when I've managed to see that there are so many people that think of the same things I want to build. They talk about computers, they talk about engineering, they talk about software. And I wanted to have more of that.
00:08:05.195 - 00:08:43.874, Speaker B: And because, and because of that the natural choice of the university for me was the St. Petersburg State University of Aerospace Instrumentation because at the time it has the best access to computers, to science. And again these were the reason I've joined. I've managed to drop myself into the university. Through the university I've managed to get very well education. I'm master of science in computer science in math. Obviously it all comes hand in hand with aerospace and everything around aerospace.
00:08:43.874 - 00:09:13.495, Speaker B: So I'm kind of very often joking that you can actually tell that I'm a rocket scientist by trace. And that would be true but obviously majority of my time in unit was all about computers and computer science and networks and math. But at the same time I think that was the first deep into the. I don't know how much you know about the real time operating systems but I wasn't.
00:09:13.655 - 00:09:23.015, Speaker A: Oh wait, you mean the kind of operating system that you find in say like an inertial central inside of system.
00:09:23.055 - 00:10:22.635, Speaker B: On chip, system on chip, stuff like that, embedded system, system on chip I was involved. This is completely brand new world for everyone when they first tap into it. The difference is I was involved with one of the biggest companies I was working for a company called qnx. They are I think one of the biggest supply of Unix like embedded systems. And the difference between like normal engineering, a normal programming I've seen before and real time operating systems is you cannot be wasteful with normal engineering. With normal programming language you can write a software that will do its job but it's suboptimal, not very well organized arrays, weird mapping of data, wasteful loops. But when you do something in the real time operating system, you only have X amount of ticks accounts of the operations.
00:10:22.635 - 00:10:34.457, Speaker B: So if you really want it to happen on time and that's the only possibility for the loyalty operating system, you have to really think hard about how you would make it happen on time otherwise it just simply won't work.
00:10:34.561 - 00:10:55.735, Speaker A: And you also have to think about what happens if things go wrong, right? How do you deal with errors and how do you deal with. I mean if you're programming something for a plane and stuff like that. There's a component here where if your systems crash, it's not just the catalog of your library that is not going to be available. It is. You'll have a bad time.
00:10:57.915 - 00:11:37.089, Speaker B: Planes are bad. And when you write a software to some instruments sold in planes, that's, that's, that's definitely bad. But there is also one of the biggest application is the nuclear energy. And I was first hand involved with software for nuclear stations, for telecom, for airspace and I think all of that understanding that you have to think very hard on how you structure everything and how your app, application or particular code will work and what will happen if it won't and how you make sure that it will post a certain structure in how you approach engineering in general.
00:11:37.217 - 00:12:27.331, Speaker A: So I actually have a question maybe going forward a bit early but you. So you're talking about critical systems design and a while back I think in 2019 or 2018 there were reflections in the Ethereum space of people saying hey, you know, we're designing smart contracts like JavaScript's code, maybe we should start thinking about them about like critical systems. You know, there it's the backbone of the financial world. Maybe we should start looking at how people develop critical software for planes, nuclear power plants and Aircom systems. Is this something you've given some thoughts using knowledge and experience and methodology from building critical system into building the smart contracts of ZKX or not that much.
00:12:27.483 - 00:12:57.025, Speaker B: I think in general when you have this experience there is no way back. Everything that you plan and architects and create, you see it from the perspective that there is no safety net. There is no ability for you to. Yeah, I'll do it later. That's not important. I don't care about this particular potential problem with the memory or space or data pattern. I don't think that I applied just in ZKX.
00:12:57.025 - 00:14:04.059, Speaker B: My engineering career covers probably more than 20 something years now and I think that was the paramount for in every company, in every development for me where you just use this approach, whatever you do. I don't think there is critical systems and not critical systems because even if I don't know, you can say that social media is bad but if Facebook will go down for a day it will be a massive thing for everyone because businesses won't be able to get new customers, they won't be able to talk to your mom, Someone won't be able to get their tickets to some event. So it will be crucial. It's just maybe it's not what's on top of everyone's mind but I think there are no such thing as non critical system. It's just the how you see it really. And for even if you don't have the catalog of books as a librarian in the library that can be very very bad if you think about it for someone who works in a different business, maybe it's not. But I think that whatever you work is on top of your mind 24 7.
00:14:04.059 - 00:14:05.495, Speaker B: So things are important.
00:14:05.795 - 00:14:16.095, Speaker A: No, makes sense. And it's important to put care and attention in whatever you build to make. To make it efficient and resilient. So yeah, it makes sense.
00:14:16.955 - 00:14:17.955, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:14:18.115 - 00:14:27.975, Speaker A: So you worked. So you worked you mentioned for 20 years in the aerospace and in this field or did you specialize in something before moving to the blockchain space or.
00:14:29.605 - 00:15:20.675, Speaker B: The embedded systems Was the beginning of my professional career then I think about 15 years ago or so I've moved into the more obviously with what we see now Internet clients of replications ability to write software as a service that what we see normal. I think I've seen the very first days of all of that. So I would say probably 15 years ago. So I've moved into the big enterprise B2B and B2B 2C applications mostly in retail, E commerce, real time data processing, big data, what else? Advertising. I think there is always different angles that you combine together and you can use your Previous knowledge to apply in the new sector.
00:15:21.065 - 00:15:29.921, Speaker A: I was going to say it must have been quite a ride because the IT landscape over the past 15 years has changed a little bit. Let's say it that way.
00:15:30.073 - 00:15:46.785, Speaker B: It's completely different. What we've seen 20 years ago is not what we see now. And I know that what we'll see in 20 years time will be very different to what we see now. But that's exciting. Part of it, I think there are many industries where they stay the same for generations and we work. Good for us. That's amazing.
00:15:46.785 - 00:16:10.533, Speaker B: We work in the industry that changes every day. So while standing in the same industry, we experience so many different things, so many different approaches, so many different technologies. And I think that's the best thing after the sliced bread. That's what makes it interesting. Imagine working for 20 years in the industry that it won't change. And you know, it won't change for me, it will be boring. There are people who are absolutely fine with that.
00:16:10.533 - 00:16:21.285, Speaker B: But I think for me and you, it's different because we're lucky enough to be involved in the industry that is constantly changing while staying on the really sharpest edge over the future.
00:16:21.585 - 00:16:25.385, Speaker A: And when you're a lifelong learner, you never get bored. Fair enough.
00:16:25.545 - 00:16:45.083, Speaker B: And there is always something to learn. There is always something that you don't know. And this is amazing. Amounts of things that are happening in the global space is just mesmerizing. And I'm not talking about just simple things like frameworks, but there are new languages, there is new approaches to things, there is new way to do things. It's just amazing.
00:16:45.219 - 00:16:58.215, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I totally agree. And then it gets also discouraging sometimes because you spend a lot of time learning a new tool, learning a new language, and you use it for a while and then boom, not useful anymore. Move on.
00:16:58.915 - 00:17:02.643, Speaker B: That's. That's true. That's true. That's exciting as well. You always push.
00:17:02.779 - 00:17:13.815, Speaker A: You're always outside of your comfort zone, which is pretty good. But it's. It is quite interesting when you look back a little bit and you're like, oh, I spent so much time doing this and now it's so easy.
00:17:15.125 - 00:17:16.885, Speaker B: But that's the beauty of it. That's the beauty of it.
00:17:16.965 - 00:17:24.785, Speaker A: Yeah. So how did you get into the blockchain space? What was your first interaction or the first time you heard about crypto?
00:17:26.325 - 00:18:08.087, Speaker B: Okay. Like, probably everyone in, what I'd say 2010, I think I had my computer, my desktop. There is thing called bitcoin, which means money and on your computer you can connect to a network, you can run the node, you can actually mint money from the comfort of your bedroom. How amazing is that? That was the first interaction with blockchain. Again, I don't think we even use word blockchain as much as we use it now because previously like 2010, it was like, what was that, that Bitcoin. Ah, blockchain. That's blockchain, that's bitcoin.
00:18:08.087 - 00:18:16.735, Speaker B: It was almost the only thing there. So I think that was the first time when I, when I touched it and it was amazing for a number of reasons. For a number of reasons.
00:18:17.075 - 00:18:22.415, Speaker A: So you, you heard about it and then you ran it on your computer and you immediately saw value in it.
00:18:23.475 - 00:18:46.485, Speaker B: I've seen enormous energy bills, that's for sure. And what I've tried to calculate if actually mining makes any sense, I realize it doesn't. The electricity in Britain is quite expensive and at the time, as you remember that bitcoin didn't cost as much as it's today. Complexity of mine minting was different, of course.
00:18:46.645 - 00:19:20.589, Speaker A: I think it's still pretty much the case. Like mining is a very competitive industry and in general it boils down to two factors. What hardware do you have access to and do you have access to it before other people? And how much you pay for electricity. And for most people with retail price of electricity, mining is basically like you're going to spend the same amount of money on your energy bill as if you would buy bitcoin off an exchange, but you have those big ass machine that make a lot of noise in your living room so might as well just buy them.
00:19:20.677 - 00:20:11.139, Speaker B: I think I came to the same realization because I think literally year two years after I've started mining and start using Bitcoin, I've realized that there are two different factors. There is a factor of excitement of running the nodes and mining, but also there is a factor of monetary value. And monetary value at the time was much easier to get through the exchanges. And this was the time when I've opened my first account with Coinbase, which I still have 10 plus years since it started. So for me it was a diversion into the trading as well as tech side of it. And I think these were first steps where I realized that it's very multifaceted thing. There is exciting technology, there is exciting community of people.
00:20:11.139 - 00:20:50.071, Speaker B: Because I think at the same time I found Bitcoin Talk, it was Bitcoin Talk forum which was, wow, we have thousands of people actually that know what they're doing. And I don't how did it happen? I have to read, I have to learn, I have to understand. But also I can have people that can understand what I'm talking about and can bounce ideas of them. That was exciting and I think that was one of the best time in my life when I realized there is a completely new segment in the industry, in the technology that I had no idea about. And now it's there and I want to be part of it.
00:20:50.183 - 00:21:18.078, Speaker A: And there are other people with whom you can talk about. This is great. So. And at that point, so I imagine you were still like this was still a hobby, there was something on the side. So now you're obviously all in on. I mean you're building a native product in web 3. How did you make the switch from having a traditional or let's say like traditional career to diving into the unknown with web3?
00:21:18.385 - 00:22:08.779, Speaker B: 2 things. The first one, I think for me the transition was very natural and native. I think around 2016 or 2017 maybe I was developing a massive, massive logistical and transportation problem in the Middle East. We've managed to create and build amazing business there. And the foundation of technology was used by top five carriers and couriers in Middle East. So we had amazing team, we had amazing technology and it was very kind of normal B2B2C and B2B developments using normal technology and normal approach to development. And then it was around ICO boom.
00:22:08.779 - 00:23:14.117, Speaker B: I realized that how logistic works in the way of you move things from A to B to C to D to E to F and you have to track this, you have to track this in a way that is immutable and you have to have the way for everyone to access this data and see this data. And this is probably the prime best example of how you can use ledger. And that was the time when we've started to extend the platform to be on chain within Ethereum smart contracts. So for me it was very natural move from classic traditional developments into the web free development. But also the second part of that is I personally do not believe that web free development should be different from your traditional Web2 approach. And the main reason why I believe that's the case is there is quality assurance. There are ways to write web free application in the same way like you would create and develop your Web 2.0
00:23:14.117 - 00:23:53.885, Speaker B: Mission Critical Application, use the same approach, quality assurance, test coverage, TDD, BDD and then the deliverables are within Web3. But how you do the developments is same to Web2. And I was saying for many Many years that I believe that Web3 started as almost like a wild wild west type of development because it's just using a new bedroom, doing something amazing. But it moves towards very classic type of very well structured delivery of the software because it just gives you a more efficient way to deliver and to create what you want to create.
00:23:54.005 - 00:24:11.155, Speaker A: Yeah, Web two didn't come up with methods out of just wanted to come up with methods. These methods are used in Web2 and in traditional development because they make sense and they allow to ship better software in General. So if Web3, if Web3 manages to to use these methods, it's a net positive for everyone.
00:24:11.735 - 00:24:12.223, Speaker B: Absolutely.
00:24:12.279 - 00:24:55.703, Speaker A: Interesting. So you were working on supply chain and you saw Web3 as a tool to make your existing business better and you used it in that direction. It's really interesting. And yeah, I agree with you say, oh, you joined Web3 as if it's a totally separate industry. And I think to be fair, at least the assets you move and probably the subset of people right now they use, Web3 is kind of isolated from the rest of the world. You don't see many interactions aside from on exchanges, but you don't see many interactions between the web free economy and the legacy economy. I hope that will change.
00:24:55.703 - 00:25:11.055, Speaker A: But for now at least that's the case. But in terms of software development, there's no reason why this dissociation should be so important. So what was this company called?
00:25:12.555 - 00:25:18.067, Speaker B: Dravel Dribble is the driver in Kuwaiti.
00:25:18.251 - 00:25:25.415, Speaker A: Nice. Cool. And how did you move from there to zkx?
00:25:28.285 - 00:25:36.145, Speaker B: It's either a story I should be ashamed of or super proud of. I'm not sure how much you know about Wall street bets and Reddit.
00:25:37.725 - 00:26:08.707, Speaker A: I, I know, I know. I don't know much about it. I know that they made headlines a while back because there was this dude with long hairs who made a call about GME who said, who is a company? I have no idea what they do. It's Gamestop. So it's something kind of store that sells video game. And he was saying, oh, these guys are doing cool stuff. And the big boys, the big financial people were shorting GME and this dude on, on the Wall street bets was saying, no, no, no, GME is the, it's going to be good.
00:26:08.707 - 00:26:44.425, Speaker A: Let's all long. Then you have this, you had this kind of moment where the, the hive mind of Wall street bets started saying, yeah, yeah, he's right. Let's all put our money where Amarph is. Then they, they started putting money and it started to grow into being a problem for the big boys who were losing too much money. Up until the point where the big boys had to go cry to daddy for the regulator, say okay, stop now. And they just pulled the plug on the whole thing. The people at Wall street bet ended up not making as much money as they could have and the big boys saved their money.
00:26:44.425 - 00:26:49.177, Speaker A: That's, that's the very cliche view I have of this. Does it make sense? Is it what happened?
00:26:49.281 - 00:27:42.165, Speaker B: Which is very cliche but it's, it's very much what happens. The GameStop as the movements was amazing. I think what we were saying is can't stop, won't stop. GameStop it is very well popularized story right now. But how WellStreetBets started is with people like minded people that trying to in a very self humbling way try to find a very detailed intrinsic due diligences on different types of trading, different types of companies. And the reason why I've joined it and started to participate in Wall street best was because of my interest in trading. And again I did tell you that most of the things that happened in my life have a precursor for that.
00:27:42.165 - 00:28:40.107, Speaker B: So I've discovered Bitcoin. Then I've discovered that there is reason for me to just trade rather than mint it and mine it. And then I became a trader. Maybe not the greatest one, but I start to understand the financial side of different things. And that led me to community where the fundamentals and understanding of how things work on the fundamental level was super exciting. And that how I've joined Wall street bets it was, it was before the JME wave because on top of Jamie, I think lots of people came to WallStreetBets that just wanted to have either revenge because it was like a small man versus a man versus Goliath. And again frustration especially in stasis is so, so big that there are corporations that steal from regular people that don't allow regular people go and make money while they mean billions and billions in dollars.
00:28:40.107 - 00:29:34.377, Speaker B: Lots of people came to Wall street bets on that wave out of frustration or feel of revenge or feel of a community spiritual. But the core community was about doing very interesting due diligence on different things, stock markets, particular stocks of the different companies, trying to understand what to expect from the next earning calls before it happens. Which require a lot of time to do this research but also requires lots of understanding of how financial system works and lots of people I'm super friendly with or my very close friends I've met online and most of the time. For most of the people that's not the case. We keep close. We have people that are close to us that we know from school, from university, from work. For me it's surprisingly slightly different.
00:29:34.377 - 00:30:13.275, Speaker B: Of course I have people from union from work, but a mind blowing amount of people that are my friends came from online and I'm lucky enough to live in the sense of the world. London has amazing connections everywhere. You can buy tickets and in next 12 hours it can be anywhere. So for me it was very easy to have real IRL experience with people that's been I only met online and this was the case with Wall street bets and two guys. I don't know, they're just nicknames but they're amazing. We share the same values. We have ton of fun.
00:30:13.275 - 00:30:20.543, Speaker B: These guys are actually Edwards and Naman that are my co founders in ZKX right now.
00:30:20.719 - 00:30:47.007, Speaker A: Nice. So you made them on an online forum which is Wall Street Bet, which is more than just the story about GME where the way you describe it it sounds like a research dojo where you train to do research with a very high exigence and you share with peers and you learn with peers, which sounds really inspiring. And so. So you met them before dj?
00:30:47.071 - 00:30:47.715, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:30:49.935 - 00:30:51.355, Speaker A: Before. It was cool.
00:30:51.735 - 00:30:53.275, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Yeah.
00:30:53.735 - 00:30:59.275, Speaker A: So you met them there and you, you flew to to meet them and how did the.
00:31:00.175 - 00:31:34.419, Speaker B: Yeah, I think, I think sometimes it just clicks. You meet someone for the first time and it just clicks. I think we had, we just wanted to have a call to discuss. I can't even remember what exactly but like some DD or it was like, yeah, let's just talk. And then for me it was instant click where I've realized that I do want to spend more time with these people. And for me it's most of the time when I do something, I actually do work. My hobby is my work.
00:31:34.419 - 00:32:10.595, Speaker B: And that is the reason why I wake up every morning and I truly enjoy what I do. And the only way for me to spend more time with someone is actually to work with that person. I know it sounds extremely sad, I understand that, but that's true. So I've realized that I want to spend more time and almost I think same time or maybe next couple of weeks after that they said, well, we're trying to take something off the ground. It has no name. We don't know what we're going to do. These are rough idea of how we plan to do that.
00:32:10.595 - 00:32:29.325, Speaker B: I think instant. I said okay, let's meet somewhere. We're all from different countries and we all travel a lot. So I think we've decided to met in Istanbul I think because it was closest one for everyone.
00:32:29.455 - 00:32:32.385, Speaker A: You're in London and where are Edward and Naman?
00:32:32.505 - 00:32:58.469, Speaker B: Edwards at the time was in Lisbon and Naman at the time was in Delhi as far as I remember. So it was kind of. Yeah, yeah. So we decided to meet there. We didn't have, we didn't, we had rough, rough idea what we want to do. We knew for a fact that it has to be blockchain based business. We had few ideas on what we wanted to do initially.
00:32:58.469 - 00:33:34.675, Speaker B: It wasn't. I won't embarrass myself, but I won't tell you what the first idea. It was funny and amazing and interesting. We didn't have name at the time and I think very, very shortly after that we came to the conclusion that we actually do want to build this thing together. We enjoy massively chatting on any topics we want to chat. And I think then after that few months in, we've had an exercise of okay, we do want to work together, we want to build it. What exactly is going to be? And we've spent some time trying to understand how this thing, how this thing will work and what it's going to be.
00:33:34.675 - 00:33:37.955, Speaker B: And yeah, the rest of this story now.
00:33:39.175 - 00:33:58.315, Speaker A: Well, I'm actually curious, which platform did you, how did you start this? Did you start with the products? Did you start with the platform you wanted to build on? Like did you take, did you take a look at existing capacity and figured what can we do with that? Or did you start with we want to start solve that problem? How do we find a proper platform to do that?
00:33:58.355 - 00:34:53.035, Speaker B: Sure. Two things that massively, massively were drivers for what we do now. The first one is actually for me started probably 10 years before that meeting. One of the things that excited me most when I discovered blockchain and bitcoin was it is something that no one can have control over. You can't pull a switch on a server, you can't close the company, you can't find a hub that you need to shut down to shut down the network. The ability to have something that has its own media to live in. The decentralization part where you really, really, truly do not, do not control and no one can control.
00:34:53.035 - 00:34:57.599, Speaker B: This idea was just mesmerizing for me and that you.
00:34:57.647 - 00:35:10.063, Speaker A: The autonomous, the autonomous aspect of it is fascinating. Like this structure lives whether you care for it or not, it will be there and something will happen there that's, that's there's no other systems like this.
00:35:10.159 - 00:35:46.615, Speaker B: That's just it. It is truly mind boggling, mind blowing. Wow. It's a thing on itself. You can't shut down Facebook, you can shut down Amazon, you can shut down Google, but this thing, no you can't. And I think it's not a well known story, but a few years after I've discovered Bitcoin, more than three years, the Ethereum appeared. And Ethereum as the network initially had very different foundations for how they want to do things.
00:35:46.615 - 00:36:16.161, Speaker B: And I think I've understood the idea of smart contracts instantly thinking wow, this is wow. This is wow. This thing bitcoin, awesome. But this is wow. But at the same time I think I could put a label on me at the time as the bitcoin maxim because bitcoin is, it's there, it's everything. The Ethereum is cool, but bitcoin, wow guys, this is amazing. Ethereum is cool, but Bitcoin wow.
00:36:16.161 - 00:36:31.737, Speaker B: And obviously the what I've tried to do, maybe not obviously, I don't know, but I've tried to build something to bring ability to have some sort of smart contracts on Ethereum to Bitcoin.
00:36:31.881 - 00:36:33.045, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:36:33.545 - 00:37:18.645, Speaker B: In fact my nickname is is still from that time my nickname is Bit pactum. Bit is short for bitcoin while paktum is contract in Latin. So I've tried to create a system where you can have smart contracts on top of bitcoin. And I've pitched this idea to a lot of people on Bitcoin Talk forum and later on the Blockchain and Reddit. I was absolutely laughed out of the room. I think I spent like six months just drafting the idea and writing the foundations for that and fundamentals for how it will be going. I was absolutely laughed out of the room.
00:37:19.545 - 00:37:21.165, Speaker A: That must have been frustrating.
00:37:21.905 - 00:38:08.197, Speaker B: And the reason was that as now I understand. I think sometimes you have ideas that people just I wouldn't say not ready for but you have to spend more time explaining why it might be a good idea. The main thing that for everyone was you shouldn't make blockchain big, you shouldn't overload with the data. It has to be lean, it has to be small. So you Vitaly, with your idea of making smart contracts, that's laughable, that's not how it should work. But guys, guys, what if we'll have it like somewhere on the site and then we'll have ability to run it and then somehow we'll link these to system that's not bitcoin, that's not blockchain Bollocks. Rubbish.
00:38:08.197 - 00:38:10.381, Speaker B: No, go away, go away. I have no idea what you're talking about.
00:38:10.493 - 00:38:18.709, Speaker A: Can you try to explain briefly how it worked technically? How would you have brought smart contracts to bitcoin?
00:38:18.877 - 00:39:04.945, Speaker B: So the idea was that it was way before toproad, it was before rgb. The idea was that I will run a servers where you can in the sandbox run any type of program that will return a fixed type of value or fixed type of variable. With the type, it will constantly listen to new blocks on blockchain. On bitcoin blockchain, if there is a message in predefined format, it will trigger something on this network, this network will do something and then at the separate place in the bitcoin it will mean the message with the results of the of the execution.
00:39:05.065 - 00:39:13.165, Speaker A: Have you taken a look at how ordinals work and how BRC20 work for example? Because there is something to that aspect there.
00:39:14.905 - 00:40:07.931, Speaker B: Since that I did a lot of research, I did a lot of things thinking that is it a good idea, is it a bad idea? The rootstock is amazing example of how this can actually be executed. And it was obviously before rootstock, before taproots and bitcoin has capacity for that right now. But at the time I think I didn't have a proper idea of how I can run this in a trusted way. Because in my head it was still just not decentralized. A set of servers as cluster of servers which reads the data, process the data, does something and then brings it back. There is no element of trustless setup. There is no elements of how you can prove that this data is actually calculated correctly.
00:40:07.931 - 00:40:38.881, Speaker B: So as the concept, I think it was great as the technical implementation. Absolutely not because I would trust someone running this. But that one was the things that roughly 10 years. After less than 10 years. But yeah, give or take. Now back to ZKX, we had two questions. The first one is the original idea was more towards single side liquidity.
00:40:38.881 - 00:41:35.447, Speaker B: So we always want to do real world assets and for us it was super important to the idea was that we want people to trade real world assets, not just digital assets in the way where they can trade whatever they want. Any type of asset, any type of. It doesn't have to be a stock, it doesn't have to be a forex of fiat. Anything you want to trade on amount of rainfall in London, go for it. You want to trade on any, any signal that is changing in the real world, sure, go for it. This requires different approach to how you create orders and Positions you cannot do this with the single site liquidity. So the only way to actually take this off the ground was that we have to run order book, limit order book and the elements of.
00:41:35.447 - 00:42:24.361, Speaker B: I always wanted to have something truly decentralized where it can run without me. I wanted to have the system where we can take anything from the real world and bring it to on chain. That was the original idea. Then we start to think okay, obviously it has to be handset on chain, handset on chain order book as well. How can we do that? Where we can do that? Let's calculate how much it will cost to run it on Ethereum L1 Oof. Okay, maybe not. What else can we do? And then we did our research and I think me always believing in idea of you can run your kind of side chain or obviously 10 years ago that we didn't have roll ups.
00:42:24.361 - 00:43:26.655, Speaker B: But the idea that I always wanted to try is when you have your some sort of network and then you have side network. And because I was thinking about that for years at the time the START net as the way to implement and run smart contracts and calculations for the perpetual swaps trading was literally the thing for us, the way to unlock how we can build this product. And then obviously we realized that majority of things should happen on chain. And because of that is stacknet as a natural choice. But also the order book we have to run cannot be on chain but it has to be decentralized. And this setup where we have on chain execution with off chain but in decentralized way processing of the order book was kind of the aha, wow, wow. Okay, let's try moment for us.
00:43:27.235 - 00:43:50.231, Speaker A: Nice. So you're building an app. So the infrastructure you're building the logic of exchanging the assets and calculating the price, most of it is on chain in a smart contract. But the order book, the infrastructure will be off chain and decentralized so that you will have various people running the order book. Is that accurate?
00:43:50.383 - 00:44:17.721, Speaker B: Correct. Yeah. So the order book is run order book on top of our ZKX decentralized node network. And the idea is that everyone can run it because again the only way to have trust is when it's not someone who controls it. It's open source and it's open for everyone. So you can see how it's done from the software perspective but also you can participate and run the network. So it's almost.
00:44:17.721 - 00:45:04.093, Speaker B: We. We used to call this as the layer 3 but obviously we've stopped because Stacknet itself started to talk about how you can do Stack Net on top of the start net on top of the Stark net and fractal extension and fractal scaling. So L3 right now is kind of slightly different term in the industry, but for us initially it was like, okay, so we have L1 where we take the level of security and liquidity. L2 with Starknet where we do a lot of computation for positions and funds and everything. And then we have L3 where we do heavy lifting, where we do heavy computation that should be there. Plus the because order book is massive and you really shouldn't load L2 with the data that is not required to be there.
00:45:04.229 - 00:45:17.517, Speaker A: I see what you mean. So you used to describe L3 as the off chain architecture of your application, whereas now we tend to refer to L3 as things that are on chain but not really on chain, but that are proven somehow.
00:45:17.661 - 00:45:32.735, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the concept is still the same. We obviously it was long roads. We do what we do for what, almost three years now. Two something I can't remember now. So the concept is still the same. The architecture is ever evolving.
00:45:32.735 - 00:45:56.055, Speaker B: We had first big test of if we are right with our testnet launch that we had back in April and May, we've got a lot of very interesting metrics proving that what we're trying to do is correct. Also, we've figured out a few bottlenecks that needs to be resolved.
00:45:56.935 - 00:46:04.035, Speaker A: So who are the people using ZKX today? Are they traders, are they retail users?
00:46:04.535 - 00:46:53.987, Speaker B: So we have I think combined 65,000 traders, which is I'd say respectable number. Majority of these, I would say 80, 20, 80% are retail users and 20% are heavy lifters. What we do in terms of the trading itself, we always wanted to have perpetual swaps. Perpetual swap is the form of future stock trading. But in the normal futures, you always have the date when you get into the contract and you always have maturity. And because you always have maturity, you can be forced out of the deal at the known price. With the perpetual swap, if you're not happy with the price you see, you can say, well, actually I don't want to close this deal.
00:46:53.987 - 00:47:27.053, Speaker B: I want to weather out the storm. I want to keep going. Which means that the professional swap cannot inherit the same properties as your futures options and things. We've realized that lots of people, lots of traders want to have traditional financial tools. They want to create strategies. But every strategy that you have traditionally applied on the futures options, Butterfly, iron, condor, they work with the maturity date of the contract. While you don't have it in Perpetual swap.
00:47:27.053 - 00:47:56.957, Speaker B: So what we had to do we had. We have amazing quant now team. We had to invent calculation for how these traditional strategies can be applied with the perpetual swaps. And I think our strong suit is ability to offer very familiar trading experience and trading tools and trading strategies while staying in the ecosystem of perpetual swaps within on chain trading.
00:47:57.101 - 00:48:07.885, Speaker A: So how do people interact and with zksync how do they use it? Do they use a wallet? How is the interaction with zkex and where do you see this going?
00:48:08.045 - 00:49:07.045, Speaker B: So we have lots of things changing after the testnet because we've gathered a crazy amount of feedback in the first iteration we had. It was all done through your MetaMask account. So you have MetaMask, we create an account for you using derivative of your signature of the message on metamask and then you have your L2 position stored sorry position stored on chain. Every order that you send to the network is signed so you can prove that it's the thing that you actually want. It has the auxiliary metadata with prices with the features of your order and then it's all calculated, matched within the order book and then the ready to be consumed batch is then sent to the on chain execution where you have the actual execution of the trade.
00:49:08.025 - 00:49:35.855, Speaker A: Interesting. Okay, so that sounds, I mean that's the architecture part of it. I'm curious like as far as users are concerned, like you mentioned that they will have a very familiar trading experience. Will it be seamless to them whether they're using a traditional trading platform or zkx?
00:49:38.155 - 00:50:54.983, Speaker B: So the, I would say that the general approach with what we're trying to have in ZTX is provides this seamless trading experience or mostly for users at the emerging markets because right now they deprive of access to bigger platforms. And I think this is the ultimate goal, kind of short term goal being able to present something familiar similar trading experience for emerging markets. Because in lots of markets, me and you, we can go and buy Tesla stock or Apple stock or something else. In lots of emerging markets it's either very difficult or prohibitively expensive. But also one of the goals for us is to have truly be truly decentralized and we want to be dao run protocol because it's not for me to decide if we want to trade this particular type of stock or this particular type of asset. I really believe that community needs to decide if they want to bring new type of asset, real world asset or digital asset. They have to decide what can be traded and we only have to empower Them with ability to trade any type of assets.
00:50:54.983 - 00:51:19.327, Speaker B: We need to empower them with the ability to say, I want to trade this. I found this amazing bike manufacturer in Vietnam. I think they're awesome, but I can't buy them being in the Indian market. But I think it's amazing. And our idea is to give the tools and ability for our traders and our users to do what they seem as the best trading opportunity for them.
00:51:19.511 - 00:51:47.469, Speaker A: Nice. Okay, that's super interesting. Thank you. Vitaly, we're reaching the end of of our discussion. I have a last question for you. So you've been building a lot of different stuff and you've built a lot of different companies. I'm curious if you can give us an insight as to, you know, when you're building stuff, sometimes you get frustrated about stuff and there are some obvious pain points that everybody talks about.
00:51:47.469 - 00:51:52.345, Speaker A: What are frustrations when you're building a business that nobody talks about?
00:51:54.455 - 00:53:03.955, Speaker B: Huh, That's a good one. What I'm going to say with my founder, co founder hat on will sound absolutely weird because every business founder should think about the value added and financial value added. So this should be paramount for every business founder. But with my CTO hat on and with my experience as the engineer, I would say that the biggest frustration is we work in the industry where ideally, what you want to have, you want to reward people that are offering something unique, innovative, amazing, complex, complicated, multilayered, something that really is on the edge of technology and the edge of innovation. This is how I believe should be. But in our industry, in our space, I think, unfortunately there is the element of people who are. Or protocols or projects that are most loud are rewarded higher than people who actually work behind the scenes creating something amazing.
00:53:03.955 - 00:53:12.235, Speaker B: So for me as the business founder, I understand the reason for that. But for me as the engineer, that's just not right.
00:53:14.055 - 00:53:30.373, Speaker A: I see what you mean. You're saying that sometimes you get very. You. You see a lot of value in technical work, but it doesn't feel like the reward is there. And sometimes just shouting out loud gets you more reward than doing cool stuff. Technically.
00:53:30.549 - 00:53:32.045, Speaker B: Yes, exactly. Exactly that.
00:53:32.085 - 00:53:49.355, Speaker A: Yeah, I see what you mean. I see what you mean. I wonder if this is something that will change. I wonder if this is something that is unique to our industry to. I don't know, maybe during the. I wasn't around during the dot com boom, but was it the same thing? Where.
00:53:49.935 - 00:54:18.113, Speaker B: I don't think it was the same thing. And I think the main difference is the dot com boom definitely came with money. And investors throwing money at you. But I think it was more thought true at the time. Blockchain, and especially the crypto, comes with a stigma of it's all about money while.com hats it's all about tech. And this is the biggest difference.
00:54:18.113 - 00:55:13.651, Speaker B: While in reality, I don't like to say that with the crypto business, I don't like to say we're working in crypto because I see ourselves as working in blockchain. And with what we do, we're trying to unlock possibility for other traders and other businesses to create something in the decentralized fashion. I do believe that defi is the answer to lots of problems that we have in the financial industry. And my biggest goal in this is to shift the perception of why should we defi the perception of why it's not a defi. Right now you have to explain why you do defi rather than tradfi or centralized. I want this perception to change. And everyone working with any business or protocol will ask, guys, are you defi? No, we're not.
00:55:13.651 - 00:55:16.575, Speaker B: Why not? And I think this is how it should be.
00:55:17.075 - 00:55:30.695, Speaker A: Makes sense. Vitaly, thank you a lot for those wild words and thank you for this discussion. I really enjoyed it. Where should people go if they want to give a spin to ZKX and try it?
00:55:31.205 - 00:55:50.413, Speaker B: Zkx Fi. Go and check it. Go check out Twitter. Go check my Twitter. It's bitpaktum. We have lots of things happening all the time. Our discord is, I think, 70 or 80,000 people strong, maybe, I don't know, 70, I think.
00:55:50.413 - 00:56:10.935, Speaker B: Now we have a lot of things happening and just go and check and see for yourself. I'm very proud of what we've managed to achieve in this year. I'm very proud of the team we've managed to assemble. And I think the good things are coming our way and every builder in the ecosystem that work on the fundamentals.
00:56:11.395 - 00:56:15.451, Speaker A: Wonderful. Thank you, Vitaly, and we'll see you soon. Cheers.
00:56:15.563 - 00:56:16.675, Speaker B: Thank you. Thank you for having me.
