00:00:00.360 - 00:00:50.245, Speaker A: So on the gaming vertical that is very strong. On starknet we have some builders who are using session keys because of course, if you have an ancient game, you don't want to sign each individual transactions. So they implemented some session key mechanism where you can use some session keys for the duration of the game. But of course it's limited to a specific context, like it can interact only with specific contracts, only with specific selector and so on. That's one example. Another example is of course Paymaster and we will extend the native account substraction to also have non substraction that will enable to send multiple transactions in parallel without having to execute them sequentially. Another aspect which we start to explore is social finance wallets and social recovery wallets that can be very powerful with native account abstraction.
00:00:50.245 - 00:01:06.995, Speaker A: A very good example is Cartridge. They implemented the wallet that you can an account that you can control by unlocking your face ID on your iPhone. So it's totally seedless, you don't have any seed phrase. So you just unlock your face ID and you interact with your smart contract.
00:01:07.695 - 00:01:11.915, Speaker B: Interesting. I mean, in that case, where are the underlying keys stored?
00:01:13.775 - 00:01:24.295, Speaker A: In the secure element of the phone, basically. Yeah. It's using the curve on the iPhone and implementation logic in kios. Exactly. Yeah. Okay.
