00:00:00.420 - 00:00:00.970, Speaker A: You.
00:00:03.500 - 00:00:31.250, Speaker B: All right? Welcome, everyone. Thank you. So we've got a really awesome panel where we're going to talk about enterprise, blockchain, financial services, what's working, what's not working, which there's a fair amount to get through. And. Yeah, so I'll introduce the panel and then I want to do a couple of ground rules. We're going to do this a little bit differently to make it, I guess, more fun than you would a normal panel. But let's start with the introductions first, please.
00:00:31.780 - 00:00:49.300, Speaker C: Hi, everyone. I'm David Levecki. I'm CEO and co founder at Canvas. We're bringing real world finance to blockchain using L2. So applying it to CBDC, stablecoin and real world asset projects, and bringing privacy, low cost and high speed transactions using Starkx.
00:00:52.200 - 00:01:25.772, Speaker D: Hi, my name is Adim Benari. I'm the founder and CEO of a company called Applied Blockchain. We're a development studio that specializes in blockchain. We started in 2015 and we've built a whole range of different types of applications. We spent the first three years working in enterprise, so my background is 20 years working in telecoms and banking and insurance. We worked with companies like bank of America, Toyota, Barclays, Vodafone, Shell, so a whole range of big enterprises. And most of those projects were really proof of concept on blockchain.
00:01:25.772 - 00:01:45.370, Speaker D: And then we spent the subsequent three years building everything on crypto. So NFT marketplaces similar to the one you've just seen, Defi protocols, bridges, oracles and so on. So we've kind of got a perspective on all these things and we think Starquare could be interestingly positioned to really take the space forward.
00:01:46.540 - 00:02:16.720, Speaker E: Thank you. Hi, I'm Louis, facilitator for maker on Starknet. So rebuilding maker on Starknet for those who are wondering why, I'm on this panel for Enterprise. So first off, a lot of enterprises are going to maker to understand what they can do in the space. So we have a number of deals in the work with big banks. And before joining maker, I work for financial data companies on utilities, helping them with their blockchain strategy.
00:02:17.460 - 00:02:46.132, Speaker B: Awesome. Okay, so how we're going to do this panel. So, first of all, I find panels where the moderator asks a question, and then you go in a row, and then you go in. I find them very uninspiring. So I'm encouraging the panelists to have strong opinions, to disagree with each other, to be respectful, but we want this to be more of a conversation than in a row. Also, I'm happy to take questions from the audience during with a couple of caveats. The question can't be a speech.
00:02:46.132 - 00:03:09.536, Speaker B: Like a question is short, so make sure it's short. And also, I have the right to veto the question if it's like off track or something like that. But we have three very accomplished, very smart, pretty technical people on stage, and I know that we have the same thing in the audience. So I think it's going to be a lot more interesting if we can actually get questions from you guys. So don't wait for the last end to ask questions. If you have a question, put your hand up. We'll get to it.
00:03:09.536 - 00:03:19.860, Speaker B: Like, if I don't call it straight away. Don't worry, I've seen you, but let's have a bit more fun with this. All right, so, first question, does enterprise blockchain suck?
00:03:22.300 - 00:03:28.410, Speaker C: I think if we define enterprise blockchain as private blockchains, 100% yes.
00:03:29.420 - 00:03:31.784, Speaker B: Do you want to define enterprise private blockchains, please.
00:03:31.822 - 00:03:46.700, Speaker C: Private blockchains, unlike public blockchains, like Ethereum, public, permissionless, decentralized, where anyone can come deposit their assets, as opposed to setting up a private quorum, private intranet, it's no better than a private database.
00:03:48.960 - 00:04:26.248, Speaker D: Yeah, I'd probably define enterprise in the first place as a very big company that's making a lot of money, that has an existing business model, probably nothing to do with blockchain, and it's probably become very, very risk averse. So they defend their model, and most of the organization is probably making sure that nothing goes wrong. And as soon as you put them next to something like a blockchain, there's a lot of things that they have to get their head around. So it's not really surprising that the first generation that we saw was these private blockchains, which kind of ticked the boxes for the enterprises, but basically undermined the good stuff of the technology.
00:04:26.414 - 00:04:33.132, Speaker B: So you've had experience with enterprise blockchain. Can you just give us a bit more detail in terms of what hasn't worked in the early days?
00:04:33.266 - 00:05:10.810, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, the first thing was that most of the enterprises, rather than looking at what the technology could do in the long run, and we'd always encourage, like, start of a blank sheet of paper in your industry, they would just look at their current business processes and say, oh, we could do that a bit better, a bit faster. And so the blockchain wasn't really an asset registry. It was a place where they could run business process with their partners and so on. And if that's all you're doing. Then what you're putting onto the blockchain isn't asset, it's usually data. And then they didn't want to share their data. And that's why the private blockchains look the way they do.
00:05:10.810 - 00:05:29.010, Speaker D: But then they're not really decentralized is the main problem. The whole security model of the blockchain and the strength of it is in the way that the consensus is reached and the history is secured. And if it's a small group that could easily collude, then you basically undermine that.
00:05:32.900 - 00:06:05.272, Speaker E: I don't think it sucks, but I think all the tools to onboard the enterprises are not here yet. You have to tick the box. You have to say that you're doing blockchain. So the innovation officer is going to invest blockchain project and it will never go anywhere. To be able to convince the top, you have to basically come with something that's kind of a small step. And I feel like today it's very binary. Either you're doing blockchain and you feel like you're trying to relaunch your legacy business on a new stack, or you don't do blockchain.
00:06:05.272 - 00:06:22.320, Speaker E: And I think there is a lot of interesting thoughts and tooling to be built around having something in the middle. Financial data marketplaces is a very good example. You can build it on a blockchain fashion, but then Goldman Sachs can see that fidelity is consuming that data set so it doesn't fly.
00:06:23.540 - 00:06:31.460, Speaker B: So what industries do you think? So you talked about financial services. Do you think that financial services is the industry that will actually start to use blockchain in production at scale?
00:06:33.880 - 00:06:35.270, Speaker E: I think you guys know.
00:06:35.640 - 00:06:53.390, Speaker D: Yeah, I think the financial industry is the one that is enjoying, let's say, the inefficiencies of the current setup. So I think it's actually the consumers of those financial services be those other enterprises, other companies and consumers who will be the first ones that will want the cheaper, faster, better.
00:06:55.200 - 00:07:27.152, Speaker C: I take the contrarian view. So you just heard from Kai and they were talking about how visa is integrating USDC and stablecoins and cbdcs. I think that's it's really, it delivers such huge gains. Like the fact that you can't move money outside of business hours is just ludicrous in this day and age. And we just take it all for granted because it's just a natural part of blockchain. So I'd agree that it's more of the back end, the heavy lifting that's going to change and the consumer side and paying with your stable coins. You need mass adoption around wallets.
00:07:27.152 - 00:07:36.840, Speaker C: There's a lot of things that have to happen first as dependencies, but a lot of things can happen in the back end very, very quickly, or at least on a shorter time cycle.
00:07:37.420 - 00:08:13.700, Speaker E: Yeah, I would second that when you look at other verticals that are using blockchain. So I'm not going to name all of them, but few. So insurance is going to do pools to finance insurance before putting all the due diligence and all the contracts and all the data points on the blockchain. If you take science, decentralized science, they are first going to be financing projects before putting scientific collaboration on the blockchain. So it feels like it's really like the financial primitives that are going to unlock some industries first and then maybe on top of that they'll build more on decentralized storage or on the blockchain.
00:08:14.920 - 00:08:50.476, Speaker D: Yeah, I guess I see things a little bit differently as well. I think what's actually happened, again, the sort of enterprise 10 was really business processes, it wasn't assets. Then an interesting thing happened when crypto took off with NFTs and DeFi was that we saw financial institutions starting to invest in crypto on behalf of their customers. So that was a new touch point. And the second one we saw was nfts. So enterprises, big brands, start to engage with nfts. I think that what we're going to see going forward is enterprises creating their own assets.
00:08:50.476 - 00:09:11.940, Speaker D: So real world assets and different types of, let's say, financial assets that live within an enterprise that could be tokenized and these could be new business models and new revenue for the enterprises, and that cuts across a whole range of industries, but it's not an easy thing to achieve. So like anything of enterprise.
00:09:12.920 - 00:09:21.828, Speaker B: Henry, can you talk a little bit about what Makerdao has done with society general? I think it's probably the best example we've seen of tokenizing real world assets and actually using them on chain.
00:09:22.004 - 00:09:49.804, Speaker E: Yeah, for sure. So we had a number of project finance projects. So those big projects where you finance equity, you finance debt, you build stuff highly illiquid. So I think we're really realizing that maker has a mandate around not falling apart, basically, and censorship, resistance and real world assets is really an issue because real world asset can be saved.
00:09:49.852 - 00:09:50.304, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:50.422 - 00:10:44.710, Speaker E: So for Maker car, really the thinking at this point is three months treasury builds are probably the safest thing we can do, but you will learn more in the next few months. And quarter Maker has this endgame plan with basically the idea of making it easier for people to build on maker, use Dai and those entities on top of maker, that basically we would delegate the real world asset strategy to. The other big challenge for Maker is that if you have a legal entity, you are not censorship resistant anymore. So there is really, I think, literally even businesses to be built that would be legal out of the box to build an insurance protocol, legal out of the box to build an equity on debt vehicle protocol, for example.
00:10:46.600 - 00:11:26.480, Speaker D: I want to talk about starboard in particular, because I think there's an interesting angle here when we look at the enterprise, the blockchain platforms that were built for enterprise. So r three, corder, hyperledger, fabric and quorum as well. If you look at the way those platforms are engineered, they're built so that two parties transacting, they're the only two that know about each other's transactions. Right. No one else knows about it. And so there was this concept of having a ledger that everybody has consensus around kind of disappeared. And so those blockchains can't actually be used for assets because you don't have the history of an asset.
00:11:26.480 - 00:12:05.310, Speaker D: And if you look at public blockchains, they're very difficult for enterprises to work with for a lot of these use cases because so much is revealed. And then if we look at zero knowledge proofs and privacy layers that you could put on a public blockchain, these probably go too far because everything's hidden, and that's also too much for an enterprise. Starkware and Starknet could potentially fall somewhere in the middle where you get the security from a layer one that's rolled up to a layer one. You get the privacy that you might get on a private blockchain. And so you can potentially see a way of ticking the boxes maybe for everybody.
00:12:06.080 - 00:12:09.196, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, David, you guys were kind of very early to this realization.
00:12:09.388 - 00:12:39.336, Speaker C: I think the key difference is privacy versus anonymity, and those are not the same things. And this is one of the beautiful parts of Starkx. And to some extent, Starknet with data off chain. What can you do with that? Just that simple primitive of having privacy from L1. So there's still some record on l one, but all of the transactions that are happening on l two are confidential. And that's just critical for enterprise adoption. And that's something that we're very, very focused on.
00:12:39.336 - 00:12:43.400, Speaker C: And we think that that's actually one of the killer use cases for Starkx.
00:12:44.320 - 00:12:49.740, Speaker B: There's a question from over here before we jump down the regulatory rabbit hole, because that really is a rabbit hole.
00:12:51.680 - 00:13:50.630, Speaker A: I think you guys did an interesting and very important transition, enterprise blockchain, because it was defined as companies sponsoring their own blockchain. And of course they don't want to cannibalize business. So you're going to get a great outcome then. I think where you all took it though is instead of enterprise as sponsor of own active private chain, it turned into enterprise as consumer of blockchain services. I think that's a very important distinction because not want to blow up their own business. There are all sorts of services they use, there are all sorts of functions that they hate. And generally it's not theirs, it's the external community hasn't gone after as aggressively as we should have because there's business attitude.
00:13:52.170 - 00:13:55.560, Speaker B: Sorry, is there a question?
00:13:56.090 - 00:14:04.426, Speaker A: I was going to encourage them to continue down that thread because I think that's where big opportunities have not yet been tapped to the degree they should.
00:14:04.528 - 00:14:10.810, Speaker B: Sorry. So this is use cases within business as opposed to business to consumer enterprise.
00:14:10.890 - 00:14:13.390, Speaker A: Using blockchain to unlock efficiency.
00:14:14.530 - 00:14:39.542, Speaker D: I think you're absolutely right. One of the great things I think about public blockchains is composability. And when you have these private blockchains, it's really a small group in an industry that are saying we're going to build an application to our own benefit. Really. And you don't have that composability. Whereas you look at the public chains, obviously you create an asset, you can take it to Makerdao and so on. I think that's spot on.
00:14:39.542 - 00:14:54.090, Speaker D: The value that they could potentially get from those other services that they could then interact with in a different way is very interesting. It's actually why I got into the space in the first place, because my background was integrations. I just saw blockchain as a new paradigm for enterprise integrations.
00:14:54.670 - 00:15:10.430, Speaker B: Yeah, Nadi. I mean, your customers have really been, by and large, non financial services or non financial services, using it for financial services. Are you bullish on non financial use cases being the ones that actually scale web3 and enterprise?
00:15:11.750 - 00:15:57.710, Speaker D: I think the killer use case that we've seen in the last couple of years is Defi. And Defi for me is financial services, but it's completely reengineered. And so far it doesn't involve the traditional large financial institutions that we have. So I see if you're a company that has assets that wants to tap into Defi, then it'll be out there and you just need to shape your assets in that way, make them compatible and so on. So that's why I think it's really for the customers of financial services industry to get the real benefits. And the financial industry could. Those who are smart enough will see the writing on the wall, will see that the industry is changing and will adapt to that, but many probably won't.
00:15:58.530 - 00:16:04.450, Speaker B: How good are enterprises building in web3? Like actually writing smart contracts?
00:16:10.790 - 00:16:50.030, Speaker C: I think going to an enterprise and saying that they have to write in solidity or in this room in Cairo, that's a big step up. They've got existing systems, they've spent years, millions, hundreds of millions of dollars building and having to rewrite it into new languages and recreate existing processes is a big challenge. I'm sure you put up with that. And so I think simple APIs and sdks that allow them to get the uplift and the huge benefits of blockchain without having to rewrite. Just simple, easy integration that lets them extend their existing applications and get the benefits of being on chain, but without having to do a complete rewrite.
00:16:51.110 - 00:17:16.490, Speaker D: I think many reimagined decentralized services kind of go against the dna of many enterprises. And so I think it's back to your point that they could be consumers of these services and play different roles in the services themselves, rather than it's changing their offering or creating a new version of their offering.
00:17:16.910 - 00:17:27.020, Speaker B: What's maker's experience been with enterprises actually developing on ethereum or kind of like engaging with your protocol kind of at the developer level.
00:17:28.290 - 00:18:30.480, Speaker E: So far we have flagship deals with big enterprises. We have a number of SMEs that we're working with for development, but it's been honestly pretty limited, but just to how they are doing it. I think the two other points of friction is wallet infrastructure that's easy to use. And the second one is that if you have a legacy business with all your data on centralized servers, if you tell them that they have to start from scratch on the blockchain, you're not making it easy. And I don't think there is any good solution today that would provide some level of certainty around the data that's on the web two server for them to become an oracle, an oracle of their own business, where for example, you just put the financial settlement layer, your data marketplace for a financial sector, you keep your data stuff on web two, but you just put the settlement layer on web3. I think there is a lot of tooling to be built around that.
00:18:31.090 - 00:19:07.370, Speaker D: Yeah, we've done a little bit of work in that space because it's something that we've seen through the work. So we've built a privacy preserving oracle called silent data. It's built on top of Intel SGX. So the data goes into an enclave and then we can provide evidence of the data without revealing it. And it's very early, but we think that this type of tooling is exactly what's going to be needed in order to bridge all of that web two data, especially about understanding risk in finance, where the previous financial activity was off chain, in order to be able to run things automatically in DFI and on chain.
00:19:09.890 - 00:19:40.434, Speaker B: Okay, so tooling needs to improve. We didn't talk about regulation, but we kind of squared around regulatory. Clarity is required, a willingness to either cannibalize their existing business or create net new businesses. So these are like substantial hurdles. What should we be optimistic about? Because I do think we should be optimistic and I think we're seeing some real opportunities. But what are you guys optimistic about kind of in the next few years as it relates to enterprise blockchain, I'm.
00:19:40.482 - 00:20:13.940, Speaker C: Optimistic to see that now. Multiple reserve banks around the world are issuing cbdcs. Multiple banks around the world are issuing commercial banks, stablecoins or tokenized deposits. So this says to me that there's an appetite for it and there is real use cases coming towards blockchain, and there's real world finance that's coming to blockchain, and there's solving a distinct need and improving intraday liquidity and allowing for new applications that were not otherwise possible before.
00:20:15.350 - 00:21:11.250, Speaker E: Personally excited about real estate, so that's the first one. So the notaries in Europe are now starting to use a blockchain. It's not going to work and it's going to take ages, but this is going to move right now. If you want to invest in real estate as an individual, you don't have access to premium deals, but all of a sudden this is going to be possible. The second thing I'm personally excited about is the decentralization of allocation of capital, and I think it will change a lot in innovation and science. So think of Angelique type of companies that are based on the blockchain and that are making it very easy for people to have investment opportunities, which requires again, the legal infrastructure of the box and all the tooling to make it super easy for companies and enterprises to move on to blockchains.
00:21:14.070 - 00:21:50.540, Speaker D: I think blockchain represents a transactional efficiency that we just don't have in the world today, in the world of business and commerce. And I think we've been in the space seven years and just watching it mature and I think what we're seeing here in these next couple of days is a big part of that, and it just means that it's becoming easier and easier for companies to be able to tap into that and to get some of that efficiency and to put some of their business onto the platform. Ultimately, we could really start playing out some of those use cases that have been talked about and have proof of concepts for years. Could actually start to become real.
00:21:51.350 - 00:22:07.330, Speaker B: Awesome. Thank you. I think, for me, the fact that I found out that we were working with Visa after Visa had already built the project, I thought it was a pretty good leading indicator. Look, you guys are doing awesome work to actually make this a reality. So thank you for everything that you're doing. Thank you for your time. Thank you guys for being here.
00:22:07.330 - 00:22:07.630, Speaker B: Cheers.
