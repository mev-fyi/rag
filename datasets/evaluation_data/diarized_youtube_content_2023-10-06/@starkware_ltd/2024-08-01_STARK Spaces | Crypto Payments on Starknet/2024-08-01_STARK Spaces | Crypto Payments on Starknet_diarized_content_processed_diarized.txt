00:00:03.080 - 00:00:21.845, Speaker A: Hi, everyone. Welcome to our Stark Space with Pulsar Money. I'm here with Stefana. I'm Devorah. I work at the marketing department at starkware. And we're really excited about Pulsar Money's recent launch on starknet. It's a super cool app and we're really excited to speak about it today.
00:00:21.845 - 00:00:25.645, Speaker A: So, Stefana, could you tell us a little bit about yourself and a little bit about Pulser Money?
00:00:26.295 - 00:00:47.115, Speaker B: Yeah. So, first of all, hi, everyone. Hi, Deborah. Thanks for having us. We are super excited about the launch. Since we've launched last week, it's been like crazy, crazy traction within Twitter and within the starknet ecosystem. So we're super excited about that.
00:00:47.115 - 00:01:24.035, Speaker B: Yeah. So I'm Stefana. I'm lead at Pulsar Money. Just to answer your question, I've started a couple of years ago within web3 after some years within a more conventional space, let's put it like this, corporate. And it's been a lot of fun since then. A lot of fun around the things that we've built already with Post Armani and the things that we have in mind from now on within our pipeline and within the goals that we ultimately want to reach with Pulsar.
00:01:25.415 - 00:01:33.595, Speaker A: Awesome. Can you tell us a little bit about where the idea for Pulsar Network came from and how it began development?
00:01:34.735 - 00:02:25.535, Speaker B: Right, so first of all, for us at the beginning, it's more of, like, gathering the team together, proving that we can. That there's synergies within the team, that we can actually do something together. And then we kind of like, looked into, like, the payments industry and the payments vertical. And our goal, or our question at the beginning was, okay, how do we reimagine this industry? Because when we think about payments particularly, well, payments are actually not fun. Right. They are most of the time pretty boring, slow, and sometimes also, like, expensive. So the question for us was, how do we, like, reimagine all of the things? It's much better than where we started with payments.
00:02:25.535 - 00:03:23.267, Speaker B: We can see it in the adoption, in the volumes, in the traction overall. But, like, the question is, how do we make it more seamless? How do we, like, build all that fun around it so that we can ultimately also reach the adoption that everybody's talking about. Right. So our goal at the beginning with Pulsar Money and with the whole app was to make payments more fun, more to make the users interact more with payments, envision something different for this and make it even more seamless. So this was like the ultimate goal. And from There like things added up on the go. We, we kind of like started with the fun part within, adding the fun part within payments, but then developing towards even more tangible, complex use cases.
00:03:23.267 - 00:03:33.695, Speaker B: We've developed this whole app towards both B2B and B2C. So yeah, that was for us from the beginning.
00:03:34.595 - 00:03:59.793, Speaker A: It's awesome. One of the things I love about Pulsar is it in this technology age I have like my phone and my, and my computer and all of these different things. It's so confusing that like I. Not everything is in one place. And I love that with Pulsar network you just go on Twitter, you type in the thing and you make your payment. It's so easy and seamless and a great, great user experience. So I would love to see a little bit more about Pulsar.
00:03:59.793 - 00:04:02.485, Speaker A: You have anything you would like to show us?
00:04:03.025 - 00:04:56.489, Speaker B: Sure, I will definitely do it. Just to give you some more context, we started with Pulsar one year ago. We are already live on another layer, one where we built the whole app and of course we're going to develop it even more. But now we brought it on startnet with a particular module that we wanted to engage the community more somehow bring the community together to engage with payments overall with the StarkNet ecosystem and so on and so forth. So I'm going to share my screen to give you a quick demo on the module that we currently have on starknet. But super excited on what we're going to build on top of that from now on. And also specifically for the social pay.
00:04:56.489 - 00:05:18.373, Speaker B: This is just the first version. There are a lot of use cases that we can build and we're actually going to build on top of the social payment. This is just the first version and I think it's a really, really, really fun one so far. So let me just share my screen. Okay. Right. Let me know when you can see it.
00:05:18.509 - 00:05:19.829, Speaker A: Yeah, we can see it.
00:05:19.997 - 00:05:45.993, Speaker B: Great. So I'm now in within the app I already linked my wallet. So you just need to like link your wallet. Then you are in. I can see here my dashboard with like the B. I can send, receive, swap tokens directly within poster money. And then here I have a dashboard with widgets that I can customize.
00:05:45.993 - 00:06:37.545, Speaker B: I can see my social payments, I can see my tokens, my NFTs. So this is just like first let's say impact within the app where you can see everything as a hub, everything you have within your wallet and within Pulsar money. And then on the left side you can see some of the modules that we have in plan to build on Starnet as well. But the first one and the one that we launched last week is social payments. So if I go on the, on on social payments, I can see here my social payments dashboard. I already linked my X account, so my Twitter account. The first thing that you need to do is to just link your Twitter and then you are almost set for the social payments.
00:06:37.545 - 00:07:26.887, Speaker B: Then what you need to do, you need to make sure that you have topped up your social pay balance. So if you want to send tokens and tokens via Twitter. So this is kind of like the ultimate goal with the social pay, we can now send tokens directly on Twitter on Starnet. And this is like a really cool use case for several things that you can do. For example, you can just tip your favorite contributor by just tagging their Twitter or you can tip someone within a campaign. You can send the rewards within the campaign directly on Twitter in a really seamless way. You don't need to ask for wallets, send them manually.
00:07:26.887 - 00:08:10.569, Speaker B: You can do it directly on Twitter or you can drive campaigns. I also like show it to you live. It's just about how you set up everything for the campaign to drive the campaign. So you need to again link your Twitter account. You need to make sure that you have topped up your balance. So for example, if I want to send now 10 stark, I already have one star within my social balance. I can just add nine more star and then I'm all set to drive a campaign on Twitter.
00:08:10.569 - 00:08:39.019, Speaker B: Give me one second, I need to do it again. Oh, it's disconnected me. Let me just log in again. I think I was inactive within the app for the past half an hour or something like that. So it just disconnected me. Now back. I just want to send for example Stan Stark.
00:08:39.019 - 00:10:03.511, Speaker B: I need to top up my balance from the wallet, waiting for the transaction to go through and then I'm all set to send the token via Twitter and discord. And for this we have custom commands. So I'm just going to go on Twitter second just waiting for the transaction to be so the transaction is successful. I'll just refresh it. And now I can see that I have 10 stars within my within my social page, right? I now go on Twitter and I say I want to send you Devora for example, I want to send you five star, right? So I'm going to tag Pulsar Starknet which is the bot for driving campaigns. And I'm going to say send five Stark to add devorah, right? I'm Posting it and that's it. In a couple of like minutes you will receive your stark within Pulsar money.
00:10:03.511 - 00:10:32.675, Speaker B: You just need to log into pulsar, link your social so your Twitter account and you will immediately see your tokens within Pulsar money. And the cool thing is that even if you don't have your Twitter linked to Pulsar money by the time I send you the start, you can do it after that because the smart contract stores the data and once you log into Pulsar you will be able to claim your tokens.
00:10:33.095 - 00:10:36.847, Speaker A: What happens if nobody claims the tokens?
00:10:37.031 - 00:10:38.847, Speaker B: It will revert back to you.
00:10:39.031 - 00:10:51.015, Speaker A: Okay, very cool. Someone's comments. One of the somebody commented in the comments, wow, this is so convenient. It really is. It's so easy to use and really, really, really simple.
00:10:51.355 - 00:12:14.003, Speaker B: Yeah, right. So you can see the bot already like responded. You will be able to see your start and this is just one of the things that you can do. The other thing is if you don't want to like do it P2P so just directly reward you or my community or my contributor or whatever, I can do it. For example, in a fun way where I say pulsar start net, send, send five star to let's say 10 reactions, right? And then I'm just posting it, right? What happens here is that 10 people that will react to my posts, so like retweet comment but make sure you also retweet it will receive a fraction of the amount of tokens. So all of this will be trans will be processed by our bot within the first 24 hours and basically randomly, 10 people that react to my post will ultimately receive a fraction of the amount of tokens. So for example, if I go back to my account, I can see here, for example, then one minute ago I sent you the Vera five star, right? And then I posted another command, another campaign with 10 reactions.
00:12:14.003 - 00:12:27.935, Speaker B: So basically once those reactions are filled, within the first 24 hours it will be processed and again, 10 community members will receive the rewards directly on Pulsar money.
00:12:28.755 - 00:12:38.215, Speaker A: Very cool. We have a question from the audience from Mason. How does Pulsar money plan to deal with potential cybersecurity threats given the decentralization of the platform?
00:12:39.005 - 00:13:21.585, Speaker B: Well, of course we have our anti bot system, for example, right? So first of all, the first thing that we do, we distribute the rewards randomly. So this is one thing that we make sure that we are like avoiding bots. We also have our anti bot system. So we are kind of like looking into all of those use cases that can threaten our app and try to always encounter that and try to avoid those kind of threats within our app.
00:13:22.045 - 00:13:31.185, Speaker A: Very cool. Awesome. So I wonder what's your favorite feature of Pulsar and what do you feel like is your favorite use case for this?
00:13:31.565 - 00:14:17.351, Speaker B: Well, in terms of the social pay, because this is the first one that is already live on starknet. I'm pretty excited about the way you can like reward individual contributors and within giveaways. For example, you can use like a really cool system when you are driving giveaways and you can reward the winners directly on Twitter. It's like really seamless, transparent. It gives you like the sense of, okay, this is like really something transparent that you can do. But then I'm super excited of the things that we can build on top of the social page. So of course now we have like the social pay as P2P and as campaigns, as reactions.
00:14:17.351 - 00:14:55.323, Speaker B: But for example, we can do a lot of like, custom commands. Build a lot of like custom commands on top of it. If you want to like, distribute just to some NFT holders, right. Or some specific wallets or there are a lot of like, custom commands that we can do. And the ultimate goal is to like, drive engagement towards those use cases. For example, if you want to like drive engagement to a platform, we can do that. Like, we can filter towards like only the users of the platform to receive the tokens or only some specific NFT holders.
00:14:55.323 - 00:15:11.805, Speaker B: So the social pay is cool. This is the first version that we, we have and it's a really powerful one. But I'm super excited also about the things that we can build on top of the, on top of, on top of the social pay and how we can play with this, with this commands, you know.
00:15:12.265 - 00:15:17.073, Speaker A: Yeah, I saw that there was going to be future integrations with Discord and Telegram and Instagram.
00:15:17.249 - 00:15:51.369, Speaker B: Yeah, super interesting this as well. Right? So to like ultimately also have it live on all those social media networks because you want to be where your community is and you want to do the things there where the community, your community is. You know, you don't want to like, take out this part of like rewarding the community outside the platforms. You want to do it transparently on the social media networks. So we have all of those things in the pipeline.
00:15:51.537 - 00:16:07.931, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting that you guys are planning to go live on Instagram, which is very much not generally web3 platform. It's more of a web2 platform. I wonder if, like integrating with more of a web2 platform will bring web2 users to web3 making it easier for them to use their apps.
00:16:08.083 - 00:16:53.341, Speaker B: Well, definitely. And this is like the ultimate goal, I think, for all of us in terms of like adoption. This is why I was saying in first place about like payments as an industry and how we can make it more fun, how we can like talk about that adoption. If we don't, like, bring the use cases and the technology that will eventually also bring those people within Web3. And I think that we should start with like, payments. Right? Because payments, again, is something that, you know is here, will stay forever within, whether it's Web two, Web three. But the question is how we can make it more seamless, how we can make people like, interact with it in a more seamless way.
00:16:53.493 - 00:17:19.155, Speaker A: For sure. Especially because people in, in Web2 or in you want to call it the real world use payments are so seamless right now. I don't know what they use in where you're from, but Venmo is a really popular thing in America. You could just pay someone with a click of a button. People are so used to that. And on Web three, when it's not like that, it's very hard. It sounds like your goal is really to bring that seamless payments to the Web3world, which is amazing.
00:17:19.495 - 00:17:20.275, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:21.055 - 00:17:31.934, Speaker A: Cool. Let's talk a little bit about Pulsar and starknet. I know we touched on it a little bit, but could you talk a little bit about your, your journey on starknet? Why did you guys decide to build on starknet and how you got involved?
00:17:32.674 - 00:18:31.895, Speaker B: Well, first of all, when we started looking into Stargnet, I think it was a couple of months ago when we first had first discussion with Abdel, I think it was. And he introduced us more to the Stargate ecosystem, the vision there. We really looked forward to the technology, the vision and everything. But the thing that excited us the most about the StarkNet ecosystem was the community. Because of course, having this like, community driven, like product where we wanted to like leverage this social pay, we kind of like looked into the community and this is something that was really in sync with our vision, with our goals. So we just decided to do it and, you know, to like, leverage all the products that we have into like bringing the StartNet ecosystem closer together and engaging within the. Within the ecosystem more.
00:18:32.875 - 00:18:41.699, Speaker A: Very cool. Cool. How has your experience been like, building on Starknet and yeah, tell us a little bit about that.
00:18:41.867 - 00:19:51.865, Speaker B: Right. So of course I'm not on the technical side, so we will need to ask our technical team how was the experience so far? Of course, on our first layer one, where we deployed first we wrote everything in Rust, so then with the deployment on start it, we needed to like rewrite everything in Cairo. So that was a challenge, I have to admit, for the whole team because of course building something from scratch is not easy, regardless of whether you're writing it at Rust, Solidity, Cairo and so on and so forth. So that was a challenge. But we managed to like do a lot of cool things in terms of like also the technical integration, the technical possibilities that we have on Star were something that we were pretty much looking forward from the, from the beginning. And yeah, that was like. Just to come back to your, your first question about how we like started to, to look into starknet and so on and so forth.
00:19:51.865 - 00:20:42.481, Speaker B: It was like the idea first of all was to bring the social pay live to bring the community together, but then build everything. On top of that, we're going to another module that I'm super excited and I'm pretty bullish. Let's put it like this on. It is the next module that we have in pipeline for the StarkNet that we've already started working on, which is Airdrop. I think that with airdrops there's a whole narrative around it within Web three, everybody, everybody's talking about it. All the communities are engaging with airdrops. They are expecting airdrops from their projects.
00:20:42.481 - 00:22:03.215, Speaker B: And I think that this module, particularly this module that we're going to launch on starknet, is going to really change how big projects are launching and are, are distributing their tokens and are driving their airdrops. So it's going to be, just to give you a quick insight into that, it's going to be like a whole airdrop infrastructure where we're going to have a point space system, we're going to have different classes all dedicated towards different allocations within the community from the project allocation, StarkNet allocation, StarkNet ecosystem allocation, to other communities within the space. But also a whole, let's say challenges part where users and community members join in, tap into the module and just do the challenges, gain the points and then in the end if you don't log into the platform, if you don't actively involve with the airdrop, you won't be eligible for claiming your tokens. So in this way we also want to ensure just genuine activity, that only genuine activity is rewarded within the ecosystem. So I'm super excited about that module as well.
00:22:03.995 - 00:22:09.575, Speaker A: Awesome. So let's say, let's fast forward five years. Where do you see Web3 payments?
00:22:10.595 - 00:23:36.643, Speaker B: Well, it's Definitely again I'm mentioning again, it's definitely we've seen a lot of progress from where we started and I think again we should be like be proud of having payments as an industry within, within web3. But there are a lot of things that we need to like do and build on top of payments to like really make it as seamless as possible. Right. So to answer your question, where do I see it in five years? It's like maybe I would just say from our perspective, from post harmonies perspective for us it's like important to build this super app for everything payments. So I think that community members, users need a whole app where they can do everything within it. And I'm going back again to like how seamless can we make payments is to build like an app where users can join and do everything related to payments there from I don't know, transferring swaps to like interacting with digital assets and everything you can do on top of that. So for us this is the ultimate goal to make this super app where users can identify with the app, can engage with the app.
00:23:36.643 - 00:23:53.735, Speaker B: There's going to be a whole gamification system to it as well. So you want to make payments first of all seamless, then also fun and just want to give users a way that they can interact with payments in a really cool way.
00:23:54.125 - 00:23:59.585, Speaker A: Awesome. Besides for Pulsar, what's your favorite use case for Web3?
00:24:00.925 - 00:25:50.185, Speaker B: Well, I wouldn't say that Pulsar is specifically a use case, so I will link it to payments as a use case within Web3. What's also interesting for us and what we're looking into particularly within web 3 is the NFT space and not necessarily how we have like experience it so far as I don't know, being a whole collectibles artwork kind of like industry. But actually what excites us most about NFTs is more of like the technology and what can you do with with the technology and how can you actually use the technological layer of, of the NFT industry to like build on top of it? We are just to give you some example of how we use the NFT technology within Poster Money. For example, we have this whole vesting system where we offer projects a whole like A to Z solution to vest their tokens towards their investors. And we integrated the NFT technology where each and every investor they receive an SFT and with that SFT they can claim their allocation according to the tokenomics and the vesting schedule. So we are pretty excited about the NFT space and again we think that there's so much more than just, let's say collectibles artwork around it, but it goes more into like the defi part of things, digital identity. So yeah, super excited about that as well.
00:25:50.515 - 00:25:55.815, Speaker A: Awesome. Cool. So where can we find Pulsar Money on socials?
00:25:56.595 - 00:26:47.015, Speaker B: Well, you can find it definitely on Twitter. That's where we are the most active at Pulsar Money app on Twitter. You can find us on LinkedIn, on Instagram, just by the name of Pulser Money and of course on Telegram and Discord as well. So we are pretty much active everywhere and we are looking forward to having as much of you as the as possible from the community, join us, interact with us, ask us questions. We are pretty much very looking forward to like answering all the questions from the community members. We want to like make sure that Postermine is like really understood from, let's say, use case perspective. So and there's a lot of things that we do on Telegram and Discord as well.
00:26:47.015 - 00:26:56.043, Speaker B: We're going to start some cool AMAs on Discord, some cool contests. So join, join our social media networks.
00:26:56.219 - 00:27:13.363, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, it seems from all the comments here, everyone's saying awesome, awesome to see something so new and unique in the space. Someone else said it's so cool. Glad to be here. So it sounds like people are really as excited as I am about Pulsar. Cool. Any closing thoughts, Anything else you want to leave our audience with?
00:27:13.539 - 00:27:42.811, Speaker B: So same on our side. We are super excited to being here within the ecosystem again. And Social Payments was just the beginning, just the first version. We're going to do a lot of things on top of it and we're super happy to have the community by our side and interact with them and engage again. As excited as everyone. We're really looking forward to all the things that we're going to build.
00:27:43.003 - 00:27:45.333, Speaker A: Amazing. And we're very excited to see what happens next.
00:27:45.379 - 00:27:49.217, Speaker B: Next. Definitely. We'll keep you, keep you updated.
00:27:49.401 - 00:27:53.745, Speaker A: Amazing. Okay, thank you so much for joining us. And that's all. Goodbye everyone.
00:27:53.865 - 00:27:54.625, Speaker B: Bye Bye. Bye everyone.
