00:00:08.110 - 00:00:27.900, Speaker A: So thank you everyone for coming. Welcome to Starquare session, and welcome to Tel Aviv. I'm Louis Gutman. I'm ecostimulator at Starquare, and let me introduce my beloved boss and Starkware founder Ellie Benson. And.
00:00:37.360 - 00:00:38.572, Speaker B: Hello. Hi.
00:00:38.626 - 00:00:39.390, Speaker C: Good morning.
00:00:41.860 - 00:00:43.010, Speaker B: You go first.
00:00:43.620 - 00:01:03.700, Speaker C: Hi everyone. I'll go first. So welcome to Starkworth Sessions two. I hope you're enjoying this beautiful winter. The Tel Aviv winters are very gentle. The first Starkworth sessions took place four years ago. It was a much smaller affair.
00:01:03.700 - 00:01:58.760, Speaker C: I think there are about a thousand people in town this week for this event and a bunch of related events, lots of talks and panels and lectures, and I think a pretty massive hacker house and parties. So there's a fair bit going on. I wanted to say a few words about decentralization, though not of computer networks. You're going to hear a fair bit about that, but actually of human networks. I'm a member of two professional such networks. One is Starkware and the other is this, of this ecosystem. And when we talk about decentralized networks, there is this focus on the resilience of the network that's this very elusive property that we aim to ensure.
00:01:58.760 - 00:02:43.844, Speaker C: How do we ensure the network continues uninterrupted, even when a node is down? And naturally, there is very little attention to what happens to that node when it goes down. So I wanted to tell you a bit about that experience, that emotional experience as one such node in this network. In early November, I was in London on a business trip, and I went down. My family and I, we discovered that my wife is in fact very ill. And I came back home promptly, and I immediately went on an open ended leave of absence. I'm still on that leave of absence. I'm far from done.
00:02:43.962 - 00:02:44.356, Speaker B: Sort of.
00:02:44.378 - 00:04:00.150, Speaker C: This past week I was able to resurface. And in the weeks that followed, I watched with a sense of relief, Starkware and the ecosystem continuing to operate, completely unfazed, unperturbed by my disappearing act, I went on from one day to the next. I just vanished. And with a sense of relief, because it meant that I can focus 100% of my energy on my family and my wife and my kids, where it was, and still very much is needed. But I must admit, also with a sense of joy and pride to know that I took part in building such a resilient human network. And a lot of people in this network reached out over this period with prayers, depending on how you count, probably half a dozen different religions and recommendations for healthier diets and books to read and tv shows to binge on, and many offers to drink coffee, and just very simple messages saying, we're thinking about you, and you're missed, and we hope things are getting better. That is a very touching experience.
00:04:00.150 - 00:05:26.592, Speaker C: It also magically, it injects the node with resilience, which I don't think happens in computer networks. So in human networks, the network is actually able to reach out to someone and help them regain their footing, which is an astonishing thing. So what can you learn from this observation of human networks, also known as life? You can learn a pretty trivial thing, and that is that you really want to be part of and build out such resilient networks, because by definition, it means that they're made up of the most talented and creative and supportive and caring and optimistic, very optimistic people. And that's a good thing to have on a good day, and it's complete bliss to have on the bad days. I think Starknet is one such ecosystem, and I urge you to take this week to strengthen your connections within this ecosystem. I think Ellie is going to be talking about the value of face to face interactions in this context. Before I hand it off to Ellie, Ellie epitomizes all these traits in my book.
00:05:26.592 - 00:05:57.340, Speaker C: I wish upon each and every one of you a co founder like him, and a friend of 35 years and counting like him. I wanted to thank the Starquare team for putting this together, this whole beautiful event, and our sponsors and partners and the many speakers you'll hear over the next couple of days. And all of you, so enjoy, and God bless. Don't go anywhere.
00:06:01.200 - 00:07:37.660, Speaker B: So, just relating to what UwI said when this proverbial bus hit him, and also meaning it hit all of starkware and Starknet, it was just the same time when FTX was imploding. And a lot of people in the weeks afterwards in conversations would ask, are you dealing with all this? Are you affected? And so on. And of course, to everyone at Starkware and also at Starknet, it was the. This that we're trying to deal with and which is really affecting us is of course, not related to all kinds, all these scams that imploded, but actually to the fact that our leader and the person that did most for having this vibrant ecosystem ticking and running is suddenly not available. And it's very good that he's now slowly reemerging, even if it means that my own ability to take a nap or go windsurfing or do all kinds of things is going to maybe slightly diminish if he's around because major part of his job was to make sure that some people come on time to various things that they were supposed to come on time for anyways. But we'll take it. Please come back as soon as possible.
00:07:37.660 - 00:08:12.710, Speaker B: We need you. So I want to say something about conferences. So we all sort of forgot this art through the three years of COVID and we're all zoomed out, and that's what we're used to. But reflecting back, conferences made a huge difference. Like face to face, conferences like this one made huge differences in my professional career. I've said this many times in the talk I'll give soon. I'll actually repeat it again.
00:08:12.710 - 00:08:48.320, Speaker B: The watershed moment, the point where I got red pilled with blockchain, was at a conference. I heard about bitcoin many times before, but it was the event of spending time with other people. Those were bitcoiners. There was no chain other than bitcoin at that time. It was in 2013. I entered it one person, and I left it a completely different person. And my professional career has completely shifted.
00:08:48.320 - 00:09:39.824, Speaker B: And was at that moment, it was a conference. And it's interesting because the white paper, I'm talking about an event that happened in 2013. So I could have read the paper, could have read a large number of papers that I never got to read, but that's one of them. And I could have learned about it from other means, but it was this event of spending times with other people like minded that really changed my career. I hope for the better. And it was also another conference in the fall of 2017 that I organized back then. It was at Technion, where I was teaching, in which Uri got sort of.
00:09:39.824 - 00:10:56.308, Speaker B: So he's been doing startups and entrepreneurship work for all of his career, and I was talking to him about blockchain and so on. And again, he could have been convinced by other means, but a really crucial part in, I think, his decision, maybe you want to say some words about it, was at a conference. And why am I saying this? I'm saying it because I wish upon everyone here that you take these two days to connect to people who are like minded in caring about long term scale blockchains and what they stand for. Validity, proofs, zk proofs, deep and important and profound math that helps with integrity, and come out of here, I hope, transformed in a good way. And I hope that at least some of you will look back and say, there was this event, starcore sessions. It was a face to face conference, and it made a real difference in my life. If a handful of you in five years will say such things, then I think we've succeeded.
00:10:56.308 - 00:10:58.028, Speaker B: Do you want to say something about.
00:10:58.194 - 00:11:05.550, Speaker C: The first person I met at that conference? You brought me there. I just came as your friend. And he said, well, this guy, his name is Vitalik. I said.
00:11:09.700 - 00:12:06.850, Speaker B: Yeah, it was a very eventful conference. There were a few of the sort of snake oil selling kind. It was ico season, so there were all kinds of, I don't know, diamond coined and gold coin and banana coin, including the inventor of banana coin, was there. It was also a place that I know that conference was also influential for Ethereum in the sense that that's where Justin Drake met Vitalik for the first time in that conference, and they started working together. So I hope again that many of you will be able to say similar things. I just want to say that if you see folks with starkware shirt, they're probably with starkware. So I urge you to reach out to them, ask them what they're doing, get connected, talk to us, and of course, more important, do similar things with others around.
00:12:06.850 - 00:13:10.644, Speaker B: So the original plan was we were now supposed to introduce professor Shafi Goldwassel, who really started this whole thing, this whole technology that we are all implementing. She's the co inventor of interactive and zero knowledge proofs, and together with Sylvia Michali and Charlie Rakoff, and she won the Turing award for that and many other awards for her amazing work. And she was supposed to arrive, but she's COVID positive in New York, so she's not able to attend. And because of that, we did a small shift in the program. So my talk was supposed to be after lunch, but I'll be speaking next, so ui, if you want, you can introduce me, or I could always introduce myself and say, I am very happy to be able to be here.
00:13:10.842 - 00:13:13.350, Speaker C: He's very happy to be able to be here.
00:13:14.120 - 00:13:21.730, Speaker B: I'm kind of happy in a general sense, so I can go off the stage and then.
