00:00:00.720 - 00:00:31.815, Speaker A: Let's just talk about games on starknet. I mean it's. The bottom line is exactly the summary of what Liron said. You can execute tons of computation. Very, very inexpensive games is a very natural use case where you talk about a lot of computation. It's something that is very hard to run today on, let's call it traditional blockchain. And it's very easy and is getting better every day, every month on Starknet.
00:00:31.815 - 00:00:43.275, Speaker A: And we definitely see a future not in like five or 10 years but very soon where tons of computation will still be very inexpensive to run and therefore games.
00:00:46.135 - 00:01:57.945, Speaker B: I'd say that since you wanted all of us to answer, my answer would be that you exactly see that the benefits of being like something that is novel and next generation developers wanting to have on game, sorry on chain experience, right. They understand that you can't do it on Ethereum and you can't do it on you know, the optimistic roll ups and you can't do it on the evm. It, it won't scale like long term and you're going to invest so much time in building a game, right? Give building a proper game is like you know, two years of work just on the front end or something like that of a large student studio. So you need something where the engine can, can actually handle it and the most plausible candidate is actually you know, Cairo and starknet. So a lot of wise developers are saying since we believe on chain gaming is the next thing, not just creating the NFTs and putting all of the logic off chain. And I think they're right. They're asking okay, where, which is the platform where we can deliver this both now and also to scale to global scale.
00:01:57.945 - 00:02:40.607, Speaker B: Because I mean here's the thing about all projects, they start small, right? So you're building something. But your aspiration, your hope is that everyone uses this, that this is a game that will go ballistic. Now those of you who've been long enough in blockchain may remember the crypto kitty's craze which is. Or you know, then it happened with Axie Infinity. What happens if your system actually succeeds? Well, if you don't have the right technology that can actually scale, it just won't work. And that's what the successful projects have found out. So all of the Stark customers that came to us came to us because they succeeded and they were bleeding gas and they, you know, couldn't service their customers.
00:02:40.607 - 00:02:59.845, Speaker B: And, and the ones coming to us now are the ones with the enough of a vision to see that if you want to succeed and you plan to succeed and you go past the, you know, whatever an airdrop or funding or a grant, you want something that will actually dominate gaming, you need to put it on an engine that can scale. And Starknet is it.
00:03:01.345 - 00:03:23.859, Speaker C: One thing we missed is just naming teams. I'm always scared to do this because I'll always end up forgetting a team. So if anybody's listening, if you're not listening, I apologize. My goal here isn't to pick favorites, just to whatever is on top of my head. There's an Influence team that has actually a live alpha. You can go and try Influence IO. I think there is also Cartridge gg.
00:03:23.859 - 00:04:00.257, Speaker C: They're also running on chain games. There's Loot Realms, which sort of evolved from those. What was that called? Those eight words that were worth like hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last bull market. They've also done some on chain gaming stuff. Brick the game Briq is like basically Minecraft on chain. They've also formed some of them a community called Dojo Dojo, which is building the tooling for unchained gaming. They've got the sequence called Katana which uses the blockifier sequencer that public stock uses.
00:04:00.257 - 00:04:24.989, Speaker C: But it has some wrappers around that that are optimized for gaming and also just has a strong community around that that's again using on chain games, not just on chain assets. And then whatever Topology is another team that's built a Shoshin S H O S H I N G that you can actually like. I encourage people just go to that website and just try and play the game, see what it's like. Again, I might be missing some teams. That's not my intention.
00:04:25.037 - 00:04:25.205, Speaker B: Apology.
