00:00:01.840 - 00:00:04.274, Speaker A: Okay, so I guess it's already working now.
00:00:04.814 - 00:00:34.242, Speaker B: Okay. I guess we are live. So I'm happy to have Brian from Arc project and the CEO of Screenshot Labs who created one of the best NFT collection ever. I would say I'm a bit biased, but we'll discuss about my bias later. So I'm very happy to have you, Brian. So thank you for joining us. How are you?
00:00:34.418 - 00:00:55.044, Speaker A: Yeah, really good. Really good, man. I think it's been a. It's been a while since we wanted to initiate this movement on stagenet and super happy to get everything ongoing. And I think the market is getting into a new shape as well. So I think it's pretty exciting times, those days. So super happy to see that where we're going to go.
00:00:55.204 - 00:01:22.544, Speaker B: I'm very excited by this potential movement that you started. And I hope that we'll see plenty of collections on Ethereum using the bridge that you created to migrate to stocknet. So can we start by a brief introduction of yourself and also about Everi and screenshot? Let's focus on Everi and sketch first and then we will talk later about the art project.
00:01:22.724 - 00:02:04.464, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. No worries. So maybe a critical information about me and the team. So we have been into entrepreneurship for the past 810 years now. Screenshot Labs is basically the third company that I've founded. So we have co founded with Christophe and Remy that are my as well that are not here today on the podcast, but that are doing all the background work on the development side and there is all the team as well, which is behind. So now it's been like three years we've been working into the space, specifically on Ethereum.
00:02:04.464 - 00:02:14.228, Speaker A: So everything that we've made so far has been made on Ethereum up until everything that we are doing right now on Stacknet, I think we are.
00:02:14.316 - 00:02:16.784, Speaker B: Stacknet is still part of Ethereum, so. That's.
00:02:18.684 - 00:02:23.260, Speaker A: Right. So it's kind of a logical extension of where we wanted to go based on all the problematic.
00:02:23.412 - 00:02:27.388, Speaker B: You are not leaving Ethereum to go on a shitty l one. So it's not.
00:02:27.436 - 00:02:55.724, Speaker A: No, no. Well, we took our stance. Right. So that's our point. I think we throughout the different. So throughout the screenshot lab's life, we've been actually doing a lot of things like. And basically we've done consumer applications and one which was called Game of Blocks, that was made by Christine and Remy based in 2017, which is today the collection that we've bridged from the l one to the l two.
00:02:55.724 - 00:03:10.844, Speaker A: And we move toward as well to developing more part of an infrastructural side that we think are key to develop great applications tomorrow on Ethereum and indirectly through stocknet.
00:03:13.624 - 00:03:22.352, Speaker B: Can you give me a bit of the story, the inception of the Fy collection? I'm very curious. I know a bit about the story, but I can share with the story.
00:03:22.528 - 00:03:55.096, Speaker A: Sure. So, you know, back in 2021, we had the chance to meet, like, together a group of people that were really amazing. Part of those people, they were part of people that were from red games. There were people, part of people that were part of the world of anime as well. With Mehdi, which is a great artist from on the anime among us, french as well, and with our son of.
00:03:55.120 - 00:04:03.336, Speaker B: Medieval, like, the guy walked on very famous anime like Dragon Ball Z movie and whatnot. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
00:04:03.480 - 00:04:51.544, Speaker A: He's been working on great anime like Dragon Ball Zen Naruto as well. Yeah. So we've been so part of my team and us, we all been part of a. A big fan of anime, video games and entertainment, I think, as a whole. And we successfully gathered this team and trying to create an ip that we were proud of, and we thought it would be great to start from. And so that's how we initiated the first steps of the collection with Arai. So the purpose was to try to create a story that was expensive and ambitious and to be starting to do it through the first main character of the story.
00:04:51.544 - 00:05:55.648, Speaker A: That was kind of those mecha robo robots that we have right now today as a PFP. And so we started from there. And so we launched this project altogether with Mehdi, all the team and the people from Earth and everything around March 2022. And so that's how the genesis of everything started. And we have tried to develop many, many different parts of the story and of the ip in different manners in video games, in the lore, in token economics games, in many different ways. And eventually, I think the state of Ethereum back in 2022 was still, in my opinion, and I think in our opinion, in terms of the team pretty early back then to develop, like, really end consumer application. And I think what we, what we tend to, me and my team, what we tend to look for is to be able to build things that matters for the masses.
00:05:55.648 - 00:06:40.076, Speaker A: And so there was kind of this echo bubble that we have just touched a few amount of people within, within the web3 space, and that we wanted to be able to extend towards a much more broad audience. And that's why, actually, we came out with our project that was okay. So we were able to do things and interesting things within the web3 space. But we were as well asking ourselves how can we actually enable more things much faster? And we started to think about those bricks that we wanted to. That we thought that we needed to be able to build a functional and. And an application that was looking to be broadening itself. So that's basically how we started.
00:06:40.076 - 00:07:10.264, Speaker A: And on the way, of course, we've met you quite like I think in 2020, end of 2022, around like this. Christian Remy was a big fan of the tech of Stocknet. We met as well, Louis, that discussed and talked with us about the all the stack and everything that was about to come. I think it was pretty early back then. There was just a few amount of people. There was not that much of people around in ecosystem and stuff.
00:07:10.344 - 00:07:14.152, Speaker B: We met in person for the first time around it. Amsterdam, right? Yes.
00:07:14.248 - 00:07:49.258, Speaker A: So yeah, I met you in the first time. And Chris and Remy, they made the really first meetup in Paris, the french one. So with actually everything. So it was a pretty, pretty funny time back then. But everything has evolved a lot since then. And of course, like on our way, we're always thinking about, okay, so we think Ethereum anyway, is the place where we want to build. But eventually it doesn't answer all our problematics in terms of like how do we onboard people tomorrow? How do we.
00:07:49.258 - 00:08:27.270, Speaker A: With an easier onboarding when they come to an application, how do we make them pay less fees? How do we. How do we create a better overall user experience for everyone? And so that's all the way. I think even stockinette was pretty early back then. But everything started to get more mature. And every month that was passing like more people was joining. We have a lot of friends as well in the ecosystem that are all builders at the moment. And Silva was part of the early one of them that initially introduced us to the topic and person border much faster and you as well.
00:08:27.270 - 00:08:46.126, Speaker A: So step by step we figured that actually Stagnet would be an amazing place to be trying to put our mind share for much more longer term, to try to reach our vision, to try to onboard much more of the masses.
00:08:46.310 - 00:09:32.404, Speaker B: Yeah, actually I think your story is very interesting also because when we talk about Stagnet, it's clearly not only about the tech, but also the humans behind it and the community and the social layer kind of because it's pretty common that I heard this kind of story where people come for the tech and then stay for the community kind of. I think that Gardin from focus three beautifully said it in an article, but again, it was true for you as well. You met very incredible people that are welcoming and willing to help each other. And I like to see a lot of synergies between the projects. And I think we can talk about it more later. But it's pretty natural in stockman ecosystem to see synergies, collaborations, partnerships between the projects in ecosystem. Because it's like a big family.
00:09:32.404 - 00:10:11.486, Speaker B: Of course it's hard to scale this culture and whatnot. I want to talk more later about the culture, the cultural aspect, because I think it's fundamental. One not only for blockchain, but also for NFT projects in general. And I think that there are actually a lot of correlation in terms of the importance of the cultural aspect for blockchain and for nfts. But yeah, can you share also a bit about like. Because recently, like you created and deployed the arc project bridge to bridge every nfts from the layer one to Stocknet. But even before that there were actually some connections with every NFT in the stocknet community.
00:10:11.486 - 00:10:22.748, Speaker B: Even before the bridge, like many people started to use it as PFp. At some point there was a clash. There were two main schools in terms of NFT. The ducks versus the robots kind of.
00:10:22.926 - 00:10:51.174, Speaker A: You can check. Yeah, for sure. I mean like, you know, so it's been a while since. As soon as we started to think, okay, so we, we think Stagnet is a good place for us to expand and to move forward with every. We first, like wanted to make a. At the first we wanted to make a bridge just for ourselves and to be able to pass through with the collection through on Stacknet. But meanwhile, while we were doing this, actually we, we've been in discussion with, with the team at Stockware.
00:10:51.174 - 00:11:11.294, Speaker A: And it came the eventually that we could actually not only just build a bridge for ourselves as we wanted to move there, but I actually tried to build a public good that would be usable by any creators or any people that would like tomorrow to be using it to come over stagnant.
00:11:11.874 - 00:11:54.396, Speaker B: Yeah, actually, if I may, I think that's another interesting aspect in the stagnet community. The fact that it's also pretty common to see people like you who are not doing stuff like in a pure selfish manner. In a way, many people like you are investing a lot of time to build public good infrastructure that anyone can use. And I really like this mindset because it stimulates really this idea of we are all in the same boat, we have the same mission and we work together towards this goal. So I really appreciate the fact that you guys are also building with this mindset about, it's not about you alone, but it's a bigger ecosystem that is bigger than all of us. So I wanted to shoot out you guys for this.
00:11:54.460 - 00:12:27.014, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, like, I think you see it when you see all the people within the ecosystem, what has been made with the Cairo book, and I think about any and all those guys and Fico Ben and stuff, all the people that contributed to this stuff, everyone that is contributing to the open source and the public goods. Indeed. I think it's quite a natural extent of our culture, I would say. And so, and so, yeah, I guess we try to do part of our job, and I think what is even cooler right now today is. So we've done it with the bridge. We've done it with the right.
00:12:27.014 - 00:12:50.626, Speaker A: We are about to publicly announce some stuff with our project in the coming weeks, and we have other stuff in mind as well for what's going into the future. And everything goes into this direction of trying to build, you know, like, decentralized, open source, infrastructural aspects. And I think it's pretty much the same for everyone. So it just feels natural somehow, you know, today to go into this direction.
00:12:50.810 - 00:13:09.454, Speaker B: Yeah. We will come back later to the stuff you announced for the future because I don't want to stay on that. You might have to do some teasing about some stuff later. Can you talk about the arc project bridge that is like for a week or something like that? Can you already share like some metrics and numbers?
00:13:09.944 - 00:13:49.344, Speaker A: Yep. So across the past, so we've been like, started initiating the publicly the bridge. So just to be precise, like, at the moment, only the right collection is whitelisted because we wanted to do it step by step. So the bridge is at first just open to whitelisting collection. So anyone that wants to use the bridge at the moment can use the bridge. And, you know, that's what we discussed publicly as well with starkware, but I think we can say publicly. But if there was any entity or any people that we think could be enabling someone to cross the bridge, we could provide him the access to the spark contact so it could enable the whitelisting.
00:13:49.344 - 00:14:41.508, Speaker A: It's just like for NFT, the problematic is quite different than for fungible assets, because on one side you have the ownership of the contract, and if you pass through the unique asset, on the other side, you need as well to have an ownership owner of the smart contract on the other side. And so according to this reason, and notably, like a Guillaume for gleam for our team, Pierre Bertin, that was working with us, like highlighted those probiotics quite early into the, into the bridge. And so we said, I think the easiest way to go through the bridge at first would be to make a whitelist mechanism. So we sure like first we test with security the safety aspect of it and as well, just to be sure of, you know, if we wanted to make it permissionless, what it would look like for an NFT bridge. And I think it would be a second step if we want to move further into this direction in the future. But yes. So just today to be precise.
00:14:41.508 - 00:14:42.212, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:14:42.388 - 00:15:42.392, Speaker B: By the way, I think an interesting aspect to mention about NFT bridges between layer one and L2 to highlight the superiority of ZK rollops in comparison to optimistic rollops. The fact that you don't have the dispute period, like as a reminder for people, the dispute period is something that is needed for optimistic rollouts to work, but because basically they assume that everything is okay until proven wrong. So it means that you need to have a sufficient time where people can monitor the network and submit some fraud proofs if they detect. So, so this is in theory because you need to actually have fraud folks for it to work. But let's say they have four proofs activated, then you need this period. And usually this period is seven days. So it means that the actual finality when you do some operations between the layer one and the L2 is actually seven days.
00:15:42.392 - 00:16:16.924, Speaker B: So for ERC, 20 grades for normal tokens, you can bypass that usually because there are some providers in between that can enable to bypass the dispute period. And in exchange you pay small fee on top and so that you can bypass the seven days period. But it works only for fungible tokens, for NFT tokens it does not work because of the non fungibility aspect of the nfts. So I just wanted to highlight that the fact that validity rollops are way better in terms of ux for bridging of nfts.
00:16:18.824 - 00:17:10.220, Speaker A: And so yeah, so actually today the whitelist mechanism is on its way. So if there is any creators within the ecosystem right now that wanted to bridge through, they can totally do it. Like we have a forum within the dark bridge that they just can click on it and we can provide access to them to the bridging mechanism if they were willing to. And in terms of statistics so far, so I think we have got around close to 1000 every bridge over to staghnet. And so as of now it's fully open. So people can bridge there anytime they want. And of course now our big aspect is to figure out and to start to build all the future of Arai on stocknet.
00:17:10.220 - 00:18:03.874, Speaker A: And that's where all the rise actually would make sense to be on stagenet and to be totally different on this as well. What we've done with the team is that we have, we have incentivized people to bridge as of whenever they can because we are going to at the moment and during the time of the quest. So it's going to be in the next ten days that are coming, we are going to reimburse all the fees that they are spending to bridge across stocknet. So because of course there is a fees on ethereum that need to be paid and the fees on stagenet. But the fees on stagenet is, you know, insignificant, to be frank. So it's not really important. But depending on the gas cost on the layer one, it may, it's maybe it may come from $9 to 25, $30.
00:18:03.874 - 00:18:41.018, Speaker A: So that's kind of was part of the first phase, in the first phase of the Everi bringing to stocknet. And we are going to start building more applications now on stagnet. What we aim to do, and you were talking about this just before that, we aim to develop the cultural aspects within stagnet. I think that's the essence of the Evri IP is to, you've kind of initiated this as well. And we wanted to be part of it. And so we started to give for free by ourselves. We paid the.
00:18:41.018 - 00:18:54.778, Speaker A: And we give to every builders within the ecosystem some ivrai and I think that's something that we, that we still want to push. You know, we have given some merch as well to some people. We have given some, some other stuff. And, and the merch was amazing, by the way.
00:18:54.826 - 00:19:08.610, Speaker B: I remember the shadai pack. It was very beautiful. I want to take inspiration from it actually, for something I will start soon, by the way, small alpha. So please give me some context about the people you worked with to make this match.
00:19:08.642 - 00:19:09.658, Speaker A: There. We have this here.
00:19:09.826 - 00:19:12.074, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. It's amazing notes.
00:19:12.234 - 00:19:50.372, Speaker A: No, the merch was amazing. And I think that's funny because, you know, we see, we oftentimes see in the stocknet office in Paris and we see like people who are still wearing it right now after, after a year and a half. So, so that's pretty cool. But, but for sure, like, you know, so what we're going to try to do, I think we're going to. We're going to try to keep pushing this community sentiment, this culture within the stagnet ecosystem and to start building like end use cases that are valuable for the masses as well. So. And when you think about an anime or kind of an anime style of PFP and robot and mechanics and stuff, what comes to our mind for sure now is to push and to develop the story.
00:19:50.372 - 00:20:18.554, Speaker A: And so we are on our way right now to develop a lot more use cases. And specifically we are about to release a manga in the coming weeks on stagenet. So what was going to be nice is that the manga is going to highlight kind of the stagnant story. So it's going to be a cool, a cool kind of story to relate as part of who we are and what we want to build as a culture. So we want to push towards this direction as well.
00:20:18.714 - 00:20:27.374, Speaker B: Nice. Pretty exciting. So you will include some figures of stocknet in the story or something like that.
00:20:28.514 - 00:21:07.854, Speaker A: So at first we made it agnostic at the moment. So we are going to highlight some projects and companies within the ecosystem that are going to be in the manga. But. But for sure, I mean, so what? So there is going to be a part of this thing, but, you know, people eventually don't want to be looking like themselves within the manga or whatever. So here is about another part of Evra which is coming by the. In the year, it's going to what we call the pilots. So of course now we have the mechs and the robots and what are going to be related to the pilots are to the mechs are going to be the pilots and.
00:21:07.854 - 00:21:18.886, Speaker A: And so we are going to initiate on stacknets. It's a similar project that looks like Nonsdao kind of, you know, if you.
00:21:18.990 - 00:21:22.034, Speaker B: Can you explain for those who don't know.
00:21:22.574 - 00:22:01.646, Speaker A: Yeah, so basically nouns, Dao generates every day a random PFP or network of. I would say it's a generative PFP that is going to be generated for. From, you know, I don't know. I don't know when it started exactly, but up until forever because the mechanism is going to be always there. And so somehow we've been inspired by this and we thought it would be great to have pfps within the ecosystem that are highly qualitative. So we don't want to make it generative as such. We wanted to push it to put it to a much better quality.
00:22:01.646 - 00:22:50.294, Speaker A: And so what we've decided to do is like every once in a while. So every once in a week, for example, there is going to be auctions on Stocknet and people will be able to make a bet to try to get to win this auction. And whenever they're going to win this auction, what we're going to do is actually we are going to ask them what they want to be looking like in the Avi universe. And so we are going to have our artists that are going to draw as the people want to be looking like within the nerves, the specific characteristic of their character. And so every once in a week you're going to be able to bet on an auction and to be able to have, you know, one on one artwork that was initially with your insights initially and made by our artists. So that was very cool.
00:22:50.454 - 00:23:04.054, Speaker B: Okay, great. Can you talk again a bit about like the importance of the cultural aspect? How, how do you see the importance of the culture in NFT in general and in blockchain?
00:23:04.434 - 00:23:23.694, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I guess, you know, there are, there are always like different type of job, people and Persona within the blockchain ecosystem. And I think there are some people that relate more to maybe the speculative or the financial aspect, which is, you know, one that's unfair because blockchain is about creating an alternative economy. So I guess.
00:23:29.094 - 00:23:43.794, Speaker B: Foundation. Yeah, I wanted you to have to join us because we will speak also about some stuff related to the foundation and related to the foundation and NFTs and whatnot. So thank you, Henri, for joining.
00:23:44.614 - 00:23:45.310, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:23:45.422 - 00:23:47.514, Speaker C: I'm happy to be here. Thank you for having me.
00:23:48.814 - 00:24:50.424, Speaker A: And. Yes, no, yeah, I mean about the crucial aspect, I guess, you know, the NFT relates as well to much more at the moment was more relating to some visual aspects and community rating sentiments. So that's what eventually we wanted to initiate back with Evrai and I think there are some projects that have initiated like the docs were part of them team from Starkwabu, from Stagnant, AZ. And I think anyway, every team that are building stuff on stagenet like realms influence all the gaming side cartridge and stuff. So there are plenty of people that are building things that bring other use cases and that you may have just on the pure defi side, but that may be really related to the financial aspect as well, but are going to be really interesting. And more recently we saw as well that Stocknet is going to push a lot on the gaming within the ecosystem and hopefully it's been.
00:24:51.344 - 00:25:03.404, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a very good transition to Sir Henri, actually, because I wanted Henri to talk about the different initiatives run by the Stacknick foundation around gaming nfts and stuff like that. So yeah, Henri, the floor is yours.
00:25:04.024 - 00:26:06.034, Speaker C: Sure thing. So around gaming NFT in specific. Well, around gaming the foundation announced the creation of the gaming committee a few weeks ago, which is an initiative that gets a bunch of smart people from the ecosystem to think about what can be done to support gaming on the starknet ecosystem. And we've debated a few ideas, and hopefully we'll be able to announce various of those in the coming weeks or so. One program has already emerged out of this, and it's the Starknet Propulsion program, which is a program that gives game developers the ability to apply for a grant that is up to $1 million for games that see tractions on Starknet. So if you have a game that is live on Starknet that will be live in the next six months, you can apply for the Propulsion program. The applications are open right now and for the next two weeks.
00:26:06.034 - 00:26:55.720, Speaker C: And for that first round, we have room for up to 20 games. It's by the program. So we'll monitor the success, we'll see how it works and what people who use the program think about it, and then we'll probably make extension to it and grow it to make sure that people building games on Starknet are able to finance their business and do cool stuff. Aside from that, we'll make an announcement of an announcement. We'll have a nice Twitter thread about initiatives for builders, including people doing gaming at the end of this week. So follow the Starknet Foundation Twitter and the Starknet Twitter to get more info on that. I also want to say that in general, we are very supportive of people building games.
00:26:55.720 - 00:27:25.524, Speaker C: We have a whole set of community initiatives to connect people to other people who build games. And we do give builders grants to people who want to try games. We also finance hackathons and we support, for example, the Dojo game jams. So. And we also support the development of the Dojo framework. So, yeah, that's where I would point people building games or looking to build games in the stagnant ecosystem.
00:27:26.824 - 00:27:48.866, Speaker B: Yeah, we sent the link of the propulsion program in the chat. So if you are a game builder, please have a look at the link. You have all the announcement from the stack metalization and how to apply. Yeah, thank you very much, Henrik. Yeah. By the way, I wanted to ask you something that I forgot, I think. Never mind.
00:27:49.010 - 00:27:49.734, Speaker A: Sorry.
00:27:51.714 - 00:28:16.754, Speaker B: Yes, we can maybe talk about the features of stocknet that are very powerful to build new use cases for nfts. So mainly we can probably discuss about account abstraction and potentially app change as well. So I think it can be. It can be great to discuss about that. Oh, before. Yeah, I remember. I wanted to comment about someone in the chat.
00:28:16.754 - 00:28:39.112, Speaker B: Who said that? He said, I need Henri to open an ASMR YouTube channel. For real? Yes. This is not the first time I see that. And it's true. You have such a calm voice, an appeasing voice, and it's always a pleasure to hear you. So if at some point you want to do something else aside from stocknet, you know what to do.
00:28:39.208 - 00:29:02.646, Speaker C: Well, if things don't work, if things don't work out, I'll know what to do. But you know, my plan is actually not this. I think that I'm just waiting for. I think one of the biggest thing I've lived in games was the GTA radio, right? They had so many super cool programs. So I'm just waiting for somebody to ship a game with that as a radio. And I can be the late night DJ. Radio.
00:29:02.646 - 00:29:08.054, Speaker C: Welcome to radio structured, guys. Keep building. Cairo's the shit, man.
00:29:09.394 - 00:29:15.930, Speaker B: That's amazing. It's another reason for you guys to build such game. Beside the grunts, it's an even more interesting reason to.
00:29:16.042 - 00:29:18.854, Speaker C: I'll do the voiceover for free. Count me now.
00:29:20.594 - 00:29:21.314, Speaker A: Nice.
00:29:21.474 - 00:29:36.868, Speaker B: Okay, great. So yeah, talking about the tech, the stockinette tech that can enable new use cases for NFTs. Yeah. Maybe we can mention before first account abstraction. So only I know you are a master to explain icon abstraction, so I will let you.
00:29:36.956 - 00:30:17.364, Speaker C: It's funny that you go with account abstraction for what it can bring to NFT. I'll mention generative arts or AI to bring like, I think there's a lot of stuff in the, in the actual NFT you can build. But, but I'm happy to talk about account abstraction. I think in general, like how would I explain account abstraction? Account abstraction is a way to dissociate your blockchain identity with your signer. Right. When you, today when you do an action on Ethereum, you sign with a private key and your identity is your public key and both are intimidating, are entirely linked. You can't decouple your identity from your private key and you always have to go through this kind of identity.
00:30:17.364 - 00:31:27.064, Speaker C: Account abstraction makes a difference. Instead of forcing you to use one specific logic to link both, it allows you to add whichever logic you like in the middle through a smart contract. So instead of having the authentication process being art coded, it allows you to customize it. So it allows people to build wallets, to design the blockchain experience they want for their users. They can decide if users are entirely sovereign or if they have a way to add somebody to safeguard their, their, their account if they need to, at some point they have a way to add delays or limits on the assets that can be, that can be, can be spent. They have a way to segment what different players can do with their wallet. So what, what I like most about account abstraction is that mostly it allows developers to meet users where they are instead of having them install exotic wallets, or exotic, or use exotic procedures such as storing a seed phrase to secure their asset.
00:31:27.064 - 00:31:38.444, Speaker C: It allows to meet them by using face id or by using their ub key or whatever process they're used to in their daily lives. And I think that's extremely powerful.
00:31:40.264 - 00:32:08.984, Speaker B: Yeah, I like this way of framing it. Like meeting the user where they are and what they are used to use. Yeah, that's a very good way to frame it. Yes. And yeah, then we can talk also about app chains you mentioned also some good use cases, Henri. We can talk about them a bit later, but yes, maybe Brian, first you can explain what are your plans for our project and so that we can map the features to some technical aspects. Yeah, yeah, for sure.
00:32:10.564 - 00:33:12.442, Speaker A: So you know, our project is supposed to be one of the key infrastructure within the ecosystem of stacknet data that will enable any builders that want to integrate nfts within their applications to make it in a much smoother way. And when we talk about applications, I can talk about any typology of applications, be it a marketplace, building in app directly themselves, or being it in a wallet. So basically we aim to build all the key element of infrastructure that are required for nfts to all the builders that will come within the stagnet ecosystem. The first thing that we've done obviously more recently was the bridge. So from the layer one to the L2, the second things that we found, the thing that we've been building in parallel was the NFT indexer that we've been building. So we believe as well that there are of course some improvements be made on this side. And we are currently discussing about the subjects with you guys.
00:33:12.442 - 00:34:10.850, Speaker A: But we think that we need to have powerful indexers and APIs to be provided to all the applications. So we have a much smoother experience and much more reactive interfaces within the ecosystem. So this is a part of one of the key elements that is required, I think both for us and for any application within the, that we are trying to improve and to be part of. But because obviously the indexers and the APIs are serving what we define as our decentralized order book. So basically what we do and the key element of our project is that we provide for any applications that want to integrate the marketplace within their applications, the backend order book, to be able to do so. And so we are currently doing this with what we call the arc chain. So it's basically an l three that we've been building on top of, on top of stocknet to be able to manage much, much easier the cost back then.
00:34:10.850 - 00:35:08.950, Speaker A: Today actually it's a much, it's much less of a constraint since the blobs obviously, but we have done this as well to be able to what we foresee as to be the stagnant ecosystem. And when I talk about the stagnant ecosystem I talk about eventually the L2 today and the app chains are going to be built on top of it as how do we create a coherent global environment within the stagnet ecosystem. And so yeah, so our product is going to be able to provide the liquidity within Stacknet L two and on any applications at first and then within the different chains that are going to be able to grow. So we collaborate with anyone on this and all the key people from Arjun Stacknet id carbonable cartridge team, the Madara team. So I know any one of the ecosystem that are building anything there. So that's kind of the big, you know, the big roadmap for us in the, in the coming of.
00:35:09.142 - 00:35:24.384, Speaker B: Okay, so in short like the plan is to have best of both worlds where you have an app chain and the sovereignty that comes with it, but you can still solve the potential problems of ux fragmentation and liquidity fragmentation. Okay yeah. So you can have best of both worlds.
00:35:24.534 - 00:35:58.586, Speaker A: Exactly. So I mean it will always be, it will always depend on the use cases of course. Right. But I think with our solution we are going to be able to bind privacy with interoperability. That is something that was eventually impossible to do at the moment because you need to make a choice whether you are going to make the acquisition on your app chain directly or if you want to make it open to everyone. And so that's kind of the extension that we're going to bring actually to the ecosystem.
00:35:58.770 - 00:36:34.834, Speaker B: Amazing. So that's another example of what we discussed earlier about the collaboration mindset in the ecostem because you mentioned already a bunch of teams and projects in the custom that are collaborating with you on that and then to make also the link with the foundation. This is also a way to stimulate this because for example, one of the important piece in all you said is madara. So the framework to build stack and chains and now this is some public good that is maintained by multiple teams through some programs with information. So maybe, Henri, you want to discuss about that, about how it works under the hood, like this kind of stuff?
00:36:36.214 - 00:36:40.014, Speaker C: I didn't hear. You cut up a little bit, so I couldn't hear. Can you repeat your question, please?
00:36:40.134 - 00:36:55.538, Speaker B: Yeah, so the question is about like the collaboration mindset in the ecosystem and specifically about some public good infrastructure pieces. And I mentioned Madara as an example of that, and I wanted you to explain how it works under the hood to maintain this public good infrastructure.
00:36:55.706 - 00:38:02.124, Speaker C: Yeah, absolutely. So the foundation, since it starts, has been funding open source project building public good infrastructure. So the way it goes is usually we work with partners in the ecosystem. Startware is a big one, but we also discuss with other key partners, such as Nevermind, to identify people who do meaningful work in the ecosystem, to build some things that other people can build upon. We're looking for people who are building Lego bricks that can then be helpful to shape product and base product on. And indeed, Madara is such a project. It was started by Starkware, and then a bunch of other projects came of other companies and individuals came in and started contributing, and the project gained a line of its own and the foundation started supporting it in order for it to be a full kit that anyone can use to launch their own chain, operate their own chain, design it for their own needs and with their own constraint.
00:38:02.124 - 00:39:10.766, Speaker C: So in general, we do this for a lot of key open source, for a lot of key open source public goods. I think what we're looking to do for the next year is really to make sure that there's no area that is essential to the growth of the ecosystem that is left out. So we make sure that the key pieces that are needed are looked after. Then we want to make sure that people who build key pieces of infrastructure talk with each other so that the wheel doesn't get reinvented every time and people can capitalize on other, on other people's work. In other words, we have a lot, a nice set of Lego bricks. Now we need to catalog them and try to help people make sense of what brick they can use and so that they can combine them and build bigger things. So we're going to put a lot of emphasis also on showcasing the work that people are doing in, in the context of those partnerships, because a lot of the time it's mind blowing, but you don't hear so much about it on crypto Twitter.
00:39:10.766 - 00:39:16.950, Speaker C: So we want to remedy this. We want people who do good work to be known about. Does that answer your question?
00:39:16.982 - 00:39:29.530, Speaker B: Abel, completely. Yeah. Totally answers my question. Thank you very much. Okay, maybe we can now talk a bit about. About. Yeah, what's next.
00:39:29.530 - 00:39:37.122, Speaker B: What's next for Everi? You mentioned a bit about the manga. Yeah. Can you talk about the different initiatives?
00:39:37.298 - 00:40:23.660, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So, you know, as part of the, as part of what I was saying, the Everi transition from ethereum layer one to stack net. So as for ambition for us to be able to create more applications on top of Stacknet and to leverage the overi P and the Evri community there directly and to obviously leverage the different, like the different tech use cases that we've discussed about, you know, the account abstraction, the app change eventually, if we can, the video games environment that we think are going to. Is going to explode within the. Within the next month and years within the ecosystem. And so to be able to keep pushing and keep developing the ip, we've decided to. To the sense of developing a manga.
00:40:23.660 - 00:40:54.420, Speaker A: And so the manga is something that has been started since September last year, actually. So we've been contributing with our community and every people that own the Nevri is able to participate and to contribute to the choice of the direction of the IP. So that's kind of the first key block. And we do this actually in collaboration with snapshots. So with our voting system. And so that's what we've done on the manga. So the manga is supposed to be a collaborative, you know, IP generated based on the ecosystem environment.
00:40:54.612 - 00:41:02.732, Speaker B: Oh, nice. So can you explain concretely how it looks like, let's say I'm every year older, I want to participate in this. What should I do?
00:41:02.868 - 00:41:38.950, Speaker A: Yeah, so there was a different phase. And so the first. So we have built the first chapter of the manga. And so it was from September to, I think, November last year. And so with Yoavara, you were able to vote on the different part of the story, which character was the main character, which eventually, like, skills he had, which part of the story was unlocking which. So we had actually as well, like three different storyline that was possible to be chosen. And so the community has chosen one.
00:41:38.950 - 00:42:02.040, Speaker A: And so this was the first chapter. We are going to do a second chapter. So again, the purpose for us is to involve the community and to enable them to vote and stuff. And then the manga is going to be released. And so we are going to release. To release this and to display all the people that have been working on it and participating within the AP itself. And so this is more like part of the manga.
00:42:02.040 - 00:42:33.674, Speaker A: So the purpose there is to really develop the narrative and the story there. To keep constructing the stagnet culture and relate to something that is really tangible somehow. So this is for first, like the first stuff that we've done and we keep going to do. Because for us, the manga is a really good basis to later build upon, you know, video games to build eventually. You know, whenever the IP has enough. Has enough fund. It has enough capacity to build an anime.
00:42:33.674 - 00:43:02.052, Speaker A: So we can keep pushing, you know, the development of the AP and the strength of the AP and the culture of the stagnant ecosystem. And that's really what we aim to do with everyone. So the manga is kind of the emphasis on all of those. On kind of what we aim to attach every. To the stagnant ecosystem and to develop it together. So that's kind of the first brick that we have. And then the second brick that we plan to do, as I told you, is like the pilots.
00:43:02.052 - 00:43:25.814, Speaker A: And so the pilots are going to be, I think, the. Maybe one of the future, you know, I think good artwork collection on stagnet. So there we are going to have really high qualitative artists. That are going to build, you know, qualitative artwork for the community. And so, you know, we hope that this is going to be one of. One of the good, good artwork. Really good artwork.
00:43:25.814 - 00:43:52.964, Speaker A: Project 101 that are going to be emerged. But part of, you know, as well, the ducks as well. And, you know, to be. To extend on this. And from then onward, like we are going to start, you know, trying to figure it out. The, I guess, more collaboration within the ecosystem. We are thinking of, you know, how can we actually enable video games to maybe leverage our own ip to use it without, you know, our demanding us and to be, you know, to be decentralized fully.
00:43:52.964 - 00:44:13.384, Speaker A: So, you know, they could use the video games without even asking for us to use the IP. So we are doing all this work to really be able for that. Evri is. Is really, you know, usable by all the people within Stocknet. And that can be a leverage for them to develop their project games community, whatever.
00:44:14.764 - 00:44:44.994, Speaker B: Okay, nice. That's super cool. And yeah, again, I hope to see a movement from quality collections on l one that will follow you and bridge to Stocknet. I'm wondering, by the way, how we can help those collections on the time to do the jump. And because even like when you have a fully commissioned less bridge, what can we do to stimulate this? I don't know. Yeah, it's an open question.
00:44:46.614 - 00:45:21.504, Speaker C: It's the same question when you're asking what any l one app can gain from going to an l two. And to me I see two main areas where people can, can do cool stuff on l two, using assets that are on l one. One is ux, you can provide a much better ux to l one connection. You can provide a secondary market that is much faster. And that's just one thing. You can provide just ux that is much better for the same thing. Or you can extend your protocol, you can do other stuff that you couldn't do on l one.
00:45:21.504 - 00:45:53.054, Speaker C: And for a lot of those stuff you can probably do it in a transparent way. But if l two s are seen as a way to retain ownership and retain the strongness of the l one asset and then extend and do way more stuff on l two, think about video games. It's like you have an extension, it's the same game, but there's more features, there's more, a more rich gameplay, a deeper thing to go inside. I think there's a lot of room to, to grow here.
00:45:53.094 - 00:46:30.744, Speaker B: Yeah, definitely. I think you are you totally, it totally makes sense because also this, those collections, they designed that project also with the constraints, they had the constraints of the l one, but now that we unlock and we remove those constraints, then now they can expand their protocol and add more utilities, more stuff on, on top because they don't have any more problems of scalability and expensive fees. So yeah, totally. It's not only about migrating, it's more than that, it's expanding the scope of their projects. Who migrating to Stacknet. So yeah, for all NFT projects out there. So you have a chance to expand your project and add very cool features.
00:46:30.744 - 00:47:05.364, Speaker B: And as we discussed a bit about Stocknet is very welcoming of games and whatnot. So there are a lot of natural connections between NFTs and games. So if you want to put very interesting stuff on chain and not just the assets, it's the time to migrate to starknet and, and to make this happen. So yeah, and again, we will help you, support you. As Brian said, the ecosystem is very welcoming, people are really helping each other and we see it in action every day. It's very natural to see collaborations between the projects. So if you come on Stocknet, you won't be alone, we will be there to help you, to support you and guide you.
00:47:06.064 - 00:48:07.092, Speaker A: So yeah, to be actually completely concrete. Like if there is anyone in the chat or people like seeing the, the event right now that are willing to ask questions or you know, to be that are curious about know how is going on in the stagnant ecosystem. Like more than keep that. Send me a DMR personally and I would be more than happy to chat with you guys about what's going. But, but for sure, like I think, I think one of the biggest change that has been for us, to be frank, in the ecosystem stagnet, is that we came from being by ourselves within Ethereum, even though we were part of a big, a larger community, for sure. But it's true that the culture, and specifically I think we are well served in France with all the people that are building in our ecosystem, but as emerged really, really good and great culture within our system. I think here too that everybody helping each other is trying to push the, to push the boundary.
00:48:07.092 - 00:48:13.384, Speaker A: So yeah, that feels great to not be just by yourself when you build stuff for them.
00:48:14.204 - 00:48:37.906, Speaker B: By the way, now that you mentioned it, I think we are not a good example of the diversity of stagnant here in the call, because we have one bite on the custom that is french. One person from Sakura that is french and one person from the occupation that is french. But I can tell you for sure that we have plenty of people in many different places. I can name a few places, but for instance, we have an amazing community of leaders in Africa. Like really amazing. They are so well organized. They have leaders in each country.
00:48:37.906 - 00:49:02.854, Speaker B: Like we have Stocknet Nigeria, Stocknet congo, Stocknet Kenya. They're organizing a lot of events, hackathons. They are shipping and building like crazy. Stocknet India also is big stocknet Vietnam. We start to see a growing community in LAtam, many places. So even if you don't see it in this call, yes, stack net is very diverse across the world and we want to expand and welcome people from all the countries. Don't be shy and come.
00:49:02.854 - 00:49:18.078, Speaker B: So yeah, I will let you like the final word, Brian and Henri, if you want to say a few words and then we can wrap it up. What I will ask first, what would you, what is your call to action, to people hearing us from the foundation point of view?
00:49:18.206 - 00:50:05.174, Speaker C: I want to see people come do crazy shit with NFTs on Starknet. Like I'll give you an example of something that could happen and that I want see more experimentation with what could be done. You know, the big promise of NFTs was it was those assets that were composable and unique. And right now a lot of what nfts are, is they're unique because of their hash, but not because of their kept their, their specific, you know, properties. A lot of nfts they have like they're defined on chain by their ash, but their properties live off chain, they live on servers and that, and that's fine. The issue I have is not necessarily with the storage of chain. It's the fact that the smart contract has no way to use the data that is in those storage because it's way too expensive.
00:50:05.174 - 00:50:52.098, Speaker C: I'd like to see people just trying to build protocols that are, that allow people to use an l one asset and import on chain the characteristics that are embedded in the JSON that defines why this NFT is particular. Why is your MRI the way it is? What makes it special? What is his exact characteristic? And then leverage that data to build something meaningful. In other words, take data that is dead data on ethereum and make it alive. Revive your nfts, give them more depth and extend them. I really want people to do just ambitious stuff. Start dreaming again with what you can do with blockchain because you have the capacity, you have the compute at your power. Do things that are inspiring, try to just redefine what is possible on chain.
00:50:52.098 - 00:51:10.254, Speaker C: I think that's the main thing I want to say. And that's the main thing I'm excited about for Stackman because I know those crazy people are out there and I know that some people are going to do crazy stuff. So I'm just, I'm looking forward to all the crazy things that are going to happen in the, in the next few weeks, months and years ahead.
00:51:10.874 - 00:51:15.054, Speaker B: Amazing. Yeah, that's a beautiful message. And Brian, you can wrap it up.
00:51:15.444 - 00:51:56.310, Speaker A: Yeah, sure. So thank you very much for you guys to come over and to discuss and to have enabled us to come aboard this wonderful ecosystem. And I'm super happy that we are joining you this environment and I hope we provide like an amazing experience to our community, the ecosystem, the ethereum ecosystem as well over the past weeks and months. If anyone is interested to know more about what we've done and our story and stuff, feel free to reach me out. I'm more than happy to do so. And if I can, I can give some hints as well about, you know, any question that you have on building on Stacknet. We are, we've been battle testing the environment for the past a year and a half now.
00:51:56.310 - 00:52:06.514, Speaker A: So I think we can provide some good information as well on this side. And yeah, thank you very much for everyone to listening and looking forward to what's coming for us.
00:52:06.854 - 00:52:13.992, Speaker B: Thank you very much mayan. So I think we can wrap it up. So thank you everyone for listening today. This space. It was a pleasure to have you. Thank you.
00:52:14.048 - 00:52:14.240, Speaker A: Bye.
00:52:14.272 - 00:52:14.768, Speaker B: Bye.
00:52:14.896 - 00:52:16.384, Speaker A: Take everyone. Cheers. Cheers.
