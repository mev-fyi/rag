00:00:00.280 - 00:00:36.394, Speaker A: Okay, so we had layer one, like Ethereum, with its scaling issues. So we built L2, like Sparknet, for solving them. Then we discovered there are certain applications that have additional requirements, and for that we built layer three. So layer three allows applications to have more deterministic control over fees and costs of system operation. Layer three can allow hyperscalability on top of L2, and layer three can also provide privacy, hiding transactions from Starband, for instance. In fact, we can implement privacy also as a layer four on top of layer three.
