00:00:01.240 - 00:00:40.543, Speaker A: Hi everyone. I hope you're doing well. In my previous video about Dojo, I mentioned the game Loot Survivor and that's exactly what we will be talking about today. So what is Loot Survivor? It's an on chain game currently still running on testnet where you fight against different monsters of various levels and tiers. For example, these guys right here. In order to win, you need to choose your equipment, such as your armor or your weapon, very strategically, and then decide which traits you want to invest in. The traits are, for example, charisma, intelligence, dexterity, and so on.
00:00:40.543 - 00:01:12.753, Speaker A: But I recommend you read up on those because they have very different impacts on how you perform in the game. Now, let me just quickly show you what this all looks like. After you've set up your account and chosen your first weapon and name, this is what you'll be seeing. On this side you have your own overview with your coins, your health, and your equipment, for example. On the other side, you have the information of your opponent. And in the middle you have your actions. Now, since this is my first round, I don't have enough dexterity to flee yet.
00:01:12.753 - 00:01:34.395, Speaker A: So we're just gonna have to go ahead and attack this fairy. So let's do that and see what happens. Great. We won the battle against the fairy. Now it's time to choose which traits you want to level up on. I'm gonna go ahead and choose Charisma. So here you can fill up your health and buy new equipment.
00:01:34.395 - 00:02:00.995, Speaker A: For the sake of this video, I'm just gonna go ahead and buy a new weapon. Now we are ready to continue. Your new opponent or some natural disaster or obstacle will be awaiting you very soon. Anyways, I guess it's game on. Let's see who has what it takes to reach first place. And don't forget to post your scores on Twitter. Alright, have a wonderful day.
00:02:00.995 - 00:02:01.355, Speaker A: Bye.
