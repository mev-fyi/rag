00:00:01.400 - 00:00:21.845, Speaker A: Is starknet unaligned? And you can interpret that question as you wish, but do you feel that starknet is somehow unaligned? When I say unaligned, I'm talking about Ethereum, the Ethereum ecosystem, the Ethereum technology. So I don't know. Eddie, do you want to go first?
00:00:22.145 - 00:01:21.935, Speaker B: Yeah, I definitely want to go first. So I'm right now in the middle of this amazing biography of Einstein by. I forgot it's like a recent one. The same guy who's now writing the, he wrote the biographies of Steve Jobs and recently of Elon Musk. So he also wrote one on Einstein and well, Einstein was deeply unaligned with, you know, physics and everything and so on. And I certainly as a researcher was unaligned with a whole bunch of things. And I think unaligned is means, you know, thinking about what it actually, you know, what is actually important and where are you heading and saying this is, you know, where we need to go or this is what makes sense and to this, to the extent that the world is aligned with you, then you're going to be aligned.
00:01:21.935 - 00:01:52.495, Speaker B: I don't know if this is a good answer. So we are aligned with the long term vision on what integrity webs are, what starknet is, what integrity means through our technology. And I think to a pretty large degree we are aligned with what Ethereum aspires to be and stands for. But it's far more important to be aligned with the vision and goals than to answer the question of what exactly Ethereum is aligned with and are we aligned with that?
00:01:55.805 - 00:02:50.125, Speaker C: Yeah, I'd say that we are not. We don't love, we don't like to change things, but when we feel it's needed, we are not afraid to change things. So we'll go with everything that is we, we will, we will definitely participate in all the discussions, we will lead all the innovation and development. And when we recognize there is an important goal and it requires a change, whether it proving capabilities for scalability, account obstruction, I can name like probably 10 different things. We will go the unaligned way and we will change them. But it doesn't mean really unalignment just means that we are taking the direction of getting 100% of our targets and we do that while improving Ethereum.
00:02:52.105 - 00:02:54.365, Speaker A: Later on. Do you feel like you want to weigh in here?
00:02:54.825 - 00:03:31.337, Speaker D: I'll tell you a funny anecdote. Jeff Bezos says he always has to speak last at meetings. So like, because otherwise people will just like repeat what he said. So if you told me to speak after Ellie and I'll be here. I'm a bit scared, but I think that there's a misconception in the community that alignment means copying the same stuff that already exists. So something I often say is one of the boldest decisions at Star Query was to develop Cairo and not do use solidity to develop the stock proofs. And that's done precisely because we want to scale Ethereum.
00:03:31.337 - 00:04:15.455, Speaker D: Because of the Importance of getting 100x the throughput of Ethereum at 100x the decreasing the costs, you have to make bold decisions like developing a new smart contract language. And that at first glance looks like unalignment, but it's actually the most aligned thing. In contrast, some teams are so worried about alignment that they are so committed to EVM and solidity that they then delay stuff like fraud proof implementation, which is a bit of a shame. So alignment? Yes. Does that mean that doing exactly the same as everybody else? No.
