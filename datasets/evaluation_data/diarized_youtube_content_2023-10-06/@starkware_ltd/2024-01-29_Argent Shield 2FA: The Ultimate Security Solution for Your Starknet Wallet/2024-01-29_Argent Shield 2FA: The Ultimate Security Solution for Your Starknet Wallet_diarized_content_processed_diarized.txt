Ever since argentX launched its 2fa Argent Shield in 2023, they've been successfully adding an additional layer of protection against hacker attacks. Disclaimer this is not financial advice, and in case you haven't bridged the Starknet yet, be sure to check out my tutorial on how to do so. So what is Argent Shield? It's a security service that protects your funds by using your email 402fa. You can imagine your Argentx account is like a house where you keep all your precious items, like your funds.
00:00:35.771 - 00:01:08.235, Speaker A: Normally you have a key, in this case your seed phrase, to enter this house. Now with Argent Shield, it's like adding a security guard, which would be your email, who stands at the door. Even if someone were to steal your key, in this case your seed phrase, they can't get in because the security guard will ask them for another form of identification. Now let's take a closer look at how you can opt in and use Argent Shield. Head to the browser extension Argentx and go to Settings. There you'll see this message. Click on it, then next enter your email address and type in the six digit code that you'll receive.
00:01:08.235 - 00:01:16.735, Speaker A: From there you can click Add Argent Shield, confirm the transaction and you're all set. Alright, thank you very much. Stay safe.
