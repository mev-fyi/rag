00:00:03.320 - 00:00:22.412, Speaker A: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. And today we are going to talk about creating new ecosystems beyond solidity and the EVM in the blockchain world. I have with me Greg Wai from only dust, Sam from Notguardian, Milan. From what?
00:00:22.466 - 00:00:23.800, Speaker B: From Starkness foundation.
00:00:23.880 - 00:00:45.368, Speaker A: Oh my God. From the Stark foundation and Giwuk from Dorlab. Cool. So the goal of this panel is to try to identify, obviously, I think, who here in the room knows what is the smart contract language of Starknet. Yeah. Okay, cool. So it's obviously not solidity, right.
00:00:45.368 - 00:01:14.770, Speaker A: So onboarding people to a new platform with a new smart contract language with a bunch of new stuff is a challenge. The first thing I wanted to kick start the discussion with is, according to you, what are Ethereum and EVM's developer modes? Meaning we often think about, oh, solidity. Solidity is the obvious one, but there are a bunch of others, and I was curious if some of these came to mind. Gilbo, you seem to.
00:01:17.700 - 00:02:08.452, Speaker C: Oh yeah. I think one of the biggest one is dev pools. So if you have some problems, or if you have some trouble with your project, or if you have some bulks and you don't know how to solve it, you can easily find some experts to get help. But in this starkness ecosystem, it's hard to find one. So if you have a problem, then you have to check. I mean, you will google it, right? And then you will notice that, oh, there is no data on Google and you need to find from discord or from telegram. Right.
00:02:08.452 - 00:02:14.710, Speaker C: So I think that's one of the biggest mods on Ethereum. Yeah.
00:02:15.400 - 00:02:49.388, Speaker A: Interesting. So the first thing you mentioned is relatively intangible. So it's the pool of developers and it's indexed content on Google and SEO. That brings me to one other aspect. When you mentioned the community, which is how do you create link between builders and the concept of mentoring? Milan, you did a little bit of that, right? On Starknet with developers. I'm curious, what was your experience mentoring people and teaching them about this new platform with which you were maybe not that familiar?
00:02:49.564 - 00:03:01.270, Speaker B: It was always very positive, I have to say, even from my side. I learned a lot just talking to people and figuring out their problems together. Yeah.
00:03:02.120 - 00:03:08.388, Speaker A: So you mean it wasn't comfortable because you felt like you learned as much as the person you taught to?
00:03:08.554 - 00:03:31.896, Speaker B: A little bit of that as well. Yeah. I think Sarknet attracts very smart people. So at the beginning, maybe our level, just because I'm longer on, like our level is different, but they catch up very fast and then I don't actually have much to teach them anymore, I think. And just because they are smart, they're so smart. Everyone's smart.
00:03:32.008 - 00:03:34.988, Speaker A: But isn't it the best kind of teaching when you also learn something?
00:03:35.074 - 00:03:38.352, Speaker B: Absolutely. That's why I love it. That's why I do it. I try to help people as much as I can.
00:03:38.406 - 00:03:41.600, Speaker A: So embrace the unknown and make new friends. Nice.
00:03:41.670 - 00:03:42.096, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:03:42.198 - 00:03:45.968, Speaker A: Sam, any other developer modes of the EVM you think of?
00:03:46.134 - 00:04:30.880, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, of course there is like this situation where you need to troubleshoot why something is not working. It's very well documented, or it's very likely that someone already ran through your problem and you have of course templates, tooling and a lot of things that are already existing, which makes all of this gives a better developer experience. And Cairo has always been, as I like to say, some kind of filter for the starknet ecosystem because it's definitely not the easy path to take. But it seems that people are choosing Cairo because there are some specific components, characteristics of starknet that they want to leverage, be it account abstraction or something else. And so that's my take, of course that leads to a better overall.
00:04:32.820 - 00:04:33.564, Speaker A: Developers.
00:04:33.612 - 00:05:22.764, Speaker D: Are a bit more, let's say, committed when they're building on Starknet and sometimes maybe a bit more tech savvy than usual. But that's also something that slows down the growth of the ecosystem. Also because Cairo VM is very specific to starknet and Cairo, the language when you're building assets on for, with Cairo it's only for Starknet. While when you're doing something in solidity, you can already think about redeploying this to other EVM systems or like Altel one EVM chains or EVM compatible roll ups. So it's a lot of trade offs and a lot of things to take into account. From a business standpoint, should you choose to go with Cairo, you also have to take this in consideration. But yeah, it is a great thing and it comes with some drawbacks.
00:05:22.892 - 00:05:31.140, Speaker A: So why do you think people build on emerging ecosystem? What are the advantages for people to build on emerging ecosystems?
00:05:34.520 - 00:06:37.876, Speaker D: Well, I think that you can capture all these ecosystems that are growing, are meant to become big. And coming early, of course, means onboarding like the first wave of users that might end up being the most involved in that ecosystem. Of course, that's something that's not always true, but I think that coming in early is definitely something relevant. And you also go with the idea that Starknet is going to capture a lot of value and because of the design choices done by Starknet and the choice of Cairo, you also go with the assumption that this thing eventually at some point is going to find a bigger adoption, mass adoption. That's why you're initially going there and being there early and sharpening your skills where there aren't that many people that are currently building. Being one of the first will definitely give you an edge on the long term. You will know the best practices you will master and ship code that is safer, more robust.
00:06:37.876 - 00:07:18.984, Speaker D: And that's a very important edge because when you come in an ecosystem that's already mature and highly competitive, it's not easy to catch up and it's not easy to build trust. Well, if you are well established and involved at an early stage, not only true building, but in the governance, and you actually shape how the platform is going to be to fit your needs better as a developer, but also to make it fit for your users, then that's a big deal. And you don't have this opportunity on matcher stacks that are very like that do not change much. So it's a great opportunity to come early so that you can have an impact on making the thing match suit you best.
00:07:19.102 - 00:07:24.920, Speaker A: So it's investing in your reputation and building your. Investing in yourself essentially.
00:07:25.500 - 00:07:27.336, Speaker D: To some extent, yes.
00:07:27.518 - 00:07:28.650, Speaker E: I don't agree.
00:07:29.020 - 00:07:30.068, Speaker A: Please expand.
00:07:30.164 - 00:08:07.652, Speaker E: Yes, I think it's just a bad idea to come very early in an ecosystem, but just very know we like the frontier. But I think, for example, Lancelo is here since one year. I think it's from Rick the legend. I think it was very hard for him. It's his one year. It's life, just a nightmare. But right now, for example, a guy like Elias from Caca Rot is with us since three months and I think he cannot compete with Lanslow, but it's not very far from him and just he didn't waste a year.
00:08:07.652 - 00:08:27.180, Speaker E: So I think if you love adventure, if you love the frontier, if you love the tech, it's very cool to come early. But I think you don't have an edge on people who are coming one year or two year after you. It's not the same if you are coming like five years after. So I think just because you like adventure, I think it's the only advantage. Be very early, just a pain, I think.
00:08:27.250 - 00:08:32.120, Speaker A: So you have cool stories, but not necessarily a tech advantage or a business advantage.
00:08:32.200 - 00:08:42.690, Speaker E: Yes, completely. And I think you can be very well on board in an ecosystem one year after. Sorry, but it's not very. I don't know. Yes, I have to say that.
00:08:43.380 - 00:09:41.030, Speaker D: I beg to differ slightly. But still, when we're looking for the know, let's say for the sharpest Cairo engineers, we usually go towards nethermind or maybe actors like Veridais that have some kind of track record, even though it doesn't mean that intrinsically they're the best Cairo engineers, developers, you still want to go with them because they've constituted the track record. So to some extent there's still an advantage when you're involved early, I think. But of course, as you said, Eliascom starts contributing on Kakarot three months ago and has a level that's similar to Lancelo. I don't know if that's true. I don't know if Lancelo agrees, but yeah, if I give you one year to play around with the language and I give one month to another person, I still think that these eleven months of difference are going to make a big difference. Yeah, I still think it's an important difference.
00:09:42.040 - 00:09:46.390, Speaker A: Okay, Milan, Gilg, anyone want to contribute here?
00:09:46.760 - 00:10:01.640, Speaker B: As I want to say, I think it also makes a business sense to come early and build early because you then are the recognized brand on the rocket ship that's about to get about to launch. Right. So it does make sense to be early.
00:10:01.790 - 00:10:44.868, Speaker A: Interesting. Thank you. So it is true though that a lot of builders or companies that came early ended up saying, okay, so I'm going to use this component that I'm used to using in Ethereum and build my thing and oh wait, it doesn't exist yet. And then you have to build it, right? So a lot of the tooling you have to rebuild, you have to respect it, you have to go around building the things in order to build your product. And as easy as it sounds, because you may think, oh, well, we know what we need to build, it's not always that simple. Right. I was wondering, Gregwa, if you have some insight in that, because at only dust you've helped a lot of projects, bootstrap, community infrastructure projects.
00:10:45.044 - 00:11:21.460, Speaker E: Yes, in fact, it's very hard for new business. For example, we are talking with the guys of Cismo, very smart guys, and we're like, we can't come in because we need this. It's Garrega, it's a project from Bruno. And so yes, it's very cool because people of the ecosystem have. So if you want to come innet, sometimes you have some issues and you need to develop something. And if you are alone as a company, it's very hard to do this because you have engaged your own funds and I think it's the role of the stacknet foundation to say, okay, you are a business, you want to come with us, it's very cool. You need this, this and this.
00:11:21.460 - 00:11:49.836, Speaker E: I will help you with the community. And a lot of builders who are here, are available here for the tech, for the adventure are like, okay, I want to create this from scratch. It will be very hard, but it's exciting for me. It is why I will do this as a business. Excitement, adventure, tech, it's not a good idea. I think if you want to create a successful business, it's not the way to do this. It's cool, but it's not the way to do this.
00:11:49.836 - 00:12:03.490, Speaker E: So I think it's very cool to use the real spirit of the frontier of the stocknet ecosystem. People who came early to help business, more rational to come in. And I think it's a perfect fit.
00:12:04.340 - 00:12:47.330, Speaker A: Thank you. So we talked so far a lot about builders, about devs. I'm curious, where and when do you see the need, when you want to onboard people to a new ecosystem, to create content specific to people who are non devs, or let's say more broadly, how do you select the people you want to reach and onboard to the ecosystem? And I was thinking she had some insight on this because at doorlabs you have run various educational programs. So who are the people showing up to hear about new ecosystems? Are they very proficient in programming or with blockchain? Not that much. How do you address them and who do you see stick around after teaching stuff to them?
00:12:54.420 - 00:13:34.316, Speaker C: Yeah, we've. Okay, so we run the first Cairo bootcamp, Korea in last October. And we found the depths because like web three depths because we thought blockchain is quite hard to enter at first time. And especially we want to teach Cairo. Right. So it's not l one, it's l two. So you need to understand about what Ethereum is and then you can learn about Cairo.
00:13:34.316 - 00:14:06.330, Speaker C: So we thought, okay, we need to teach web three devs. Who doesn't know what Cairo is? That's why we contact ZK cell. It's one of the biggest ZK community in South Korea. So many ZK cells members were coming in and learned about Cairo. And. Yeah, that's where we found some depth. Yeah.
00:14:06.700 - 00:14:38.390, Speaker A: Thank you. And to expand a bit maybe on this with Milan. So Greg, Sam, you are both based from France and France is a big community. Milan, you're not, you're from eastern Europe, there's less starknet people there. Gilwok, you're based in Korea and there's less people there. How do you see the barrier of English, of language, to the adoption of Starknet? And how can the community help you grow the communities locally where you are?
00:14:42.520 - 00:15:22.428, Speaker B: That's a good question. I don't have a good answer for. I think from the foundation point of view, we want to support people all around the world. So, like in South Carolina, well, you don't need any more support in Paris, I would say. But everywhere else to actually do meetups, bring builders to the ecosystem, help them out with grants, and kind of do whatever we can. So also the community is distributed all around the world. So I've been going around talking to people, trying to find who can be, how to find these ambassadors that will actually bring the builders, the new builders, to starknet.
00:15:22.428 - 00:15:24.860, Speaker B: I don't know if that answers your question sufficiently.
00:15:24.940 - 00:15:38.170, Speaker A: It does. And what about you? What do you think about having content specific to your regional language versus having content in English, but managing the trade off between having localized content and accurate and up to date content?
00:15:41.180 - 00:16:40.500, Speaker C: Okay. Actually, to be truth, if you want to be a web three devs in South Korea, you need to learn English first, because there is none of korean docs in South Korea. Of course there is some, but if you learn about web three, then you need to learn English. So actually, in South Korea, when you make some web two guys, when you want to make web two guys to web three guy, you don't care which language he use. I mean, we just give english documentations. And of course we can teach using Korean, but most of the docs and repos are English. So, yeah, I think everyone use English in South Korea.
00:16:40.580 - 00:17:25.770, Speaker A: That's a very valid answer. Thank you. So you mentioned earlier the difference between web two devs and web free devs. Sam, you're doing a lot to onboard web two devs to the web free world in general. I'm curious, what's your take on how do you onboard people to new ecosystems who are not EVM? Do you take them through the EVM first or not? And there are advantages and disadvantages in both cases, right. If you onboard web three devs, they know a bunch of stuff already, but there's much less of them, whereas there are a lot of web two devs, but you have to teach them a lot more. So I'm curious, do you think we need to go for the EVM or to other stuff?
00:17:28.860 - 00:18:18.104, Speaker D: Okay, so the way we would do it at node Guardians is. So node guardians for now, is a platform that provides challenges for solidity only. And we're planning to add Cairo 1.0 and we're only focusing on that segment which is seasoned developers, as there are already a lot of solutions to get familiar with solidity that are out there. So we can try to focus on content that actually caters and challenges developers that are a bit familiar with the solidity stack. We try to define all the components to give you some kind of roll up about what the stack is about, how to build with it, what are the design patterns, the standards when it comes to building. And if we plan to add a new domain specific language or something like Cairo for instance, we will try to focus on the aspects that really stand out on this platform.
00:18:18.104 - 00:18:58.228, Speaker D: So whether it is, I don't know, l one l two messaging account abstraction whatsoever, we will try to insist on these new concepts. I don't know if that answers the question, but we really try to give the context. We start with a proof of concept that covers solidity in an exhaustive fashion. And now that we're starting to fork out towards other stacks, we try really to insist on what makes these languages different and how to build with them. Then yeah. You also mentioned about finding the right audience, getting the word out. It's good to abstract the complexity, explain what the stack is about and share educational content that cater to actually everyone.
00:18:58.228 - 00:19:35.990, Speaker D: This we historically did through a media I co run called Journal Ducoin. So we basically publish articles that explain how that stack works. And then when it comes to getting more involved and building, we have that brute force approach where we will have some resources or some events that Qatar do, developers that we will organize in the cities where they're like Paris for instance, or Lisbon, and try to see how they react with the stack, how we can build better challenges that make most sense for them. So this is the approach we would take to train them.
00:19:36.360 - 00:20:10.030, Speaker A: Thank you, Gregor. I'll extend the question to you. You have a web two background. Well, I guess like everyone but you recently moved to relatively recently moved to web free. Not talking about devs, but talking about builders, company builders and entrepreneurs. What does Web free has to offer to web two builders and how do we communicate that to them? What kind of resources do they need to understand what web free is about?
00:20:12.080 - 00:20:19.090, Speaker E: It's a good question. I don't agree.
00:20:19.940 - 00:20:24.544, Speaker A: What do you mean you don't agree with the fact. Well, expand. What do you mean? Do you think Webfree doesn't have much?
00:20:24.582 - 00:20:33.156, Speaker E: No, it's a joke when you don't what to say. I don't agree. It's a tips for the audience so.
00:20:33.178 - 00:20:34.548, Speaker A: What would you wish you had?
00:20:34.634 - 00:21:02.716, Speaker E: Yes, I lived earlier. The problem with entrepreneurs, it's not like developer. If you check the graph of developers, you see that the tech attract them since ten years. And if you check the graph of entrepreneur, it's a grid. They see opportunities, business opportunities. They're like, okay, if I want to raise money at a big valuation, it's not the case right now, but I have to go to web free. So it's a new tech, I will check it.
00:21:02.716 - 00:21:35.476, Speaker E: So I think it's fundamental difference between tech. They are searching for, I think, sorry for adventure, but I think when you are web free in starknet, since one year, you are just looking for an adventure. When you are businessman, you are looking for an opportunity. And I think it's not the same. And to attract them, we need to say, okay, this starknet for example, or web three more generally, it's the future. You have to build on this. You have to create some hype.
00:21:35.476 - 00:22:15.910, Speaker E: And I think it's a problem. For example, about dows, I think it was very funny because last year when I was onboarded in web free, there was like 200 Dow tools and like 50 active Dow, very active Dow. There is nonsense, but there was this big opportunity for all people like, okay, if I am doing Dow's tooling, I will raise a lot of money. So it's a big problem. So I have to go there. So I think we need to create this highlight opportunity, create hype. And yes, it's not the same automation that developer, but I think it works.
00:22:16.840 - 00:22:38.300, Speaker A: Thank you. And one last question that goes out to all of you, I guess. How do we measure success when we create new ecosystem and we're trying to do something differently? If you forecast yourself in one year, what thing would make you say, yes, we did some things.
00:22:38.370 - 00:22:41.020, Speaker E: Well, monthly active developers.
00:22:41.600 - 00:22:43.840, Speaker A: Okay, monthly active developers.
00:22:47.380 - 00:22:57.056, Speaker D: Overall, the value that's on the network and active addresses. But yeah, I would say that Milan.
00:22:57.088 - 00:23:01.430, Speaker B: Gilwok, if my wife knows what starknet is.
00:23:02.200 - 00:23:02.950, Speaker A: Nice.
00:23:07.960 - 00:23:16.452, Speaker C: Many projects and many Twitter followers and many people in discord and like that.
00:23:16.506 - 00:23:41.900, Speaker A: Yeah, nice. Yeah, I'll say one last active meetup communities, people meeting regularly in their local place to share the excitement and go on an adventure together, whether it's a business or not. You can help with that. Reach out. All right, I think we're at the end of this panel. Thank you again for bearing with my questions today. And, yeah, please clap for our guests.
