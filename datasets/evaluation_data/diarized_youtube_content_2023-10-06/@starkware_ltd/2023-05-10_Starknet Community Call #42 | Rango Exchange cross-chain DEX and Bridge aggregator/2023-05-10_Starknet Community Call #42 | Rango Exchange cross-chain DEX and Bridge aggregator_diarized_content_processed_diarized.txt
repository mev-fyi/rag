00:00:00.170 - 00:00:57.840, Speaker A: Um, we developed Bengal, as I said, in August 2021. So we started integrating all the main blockchains and bringing priority between them because we thought that one of the flaw that market has is all the blockchains are isolated and both new, new users and expert users into Defi have a problem for, for example, sending their money in the non custodial ways. So we start integrating all the best bridges and dexes around the crypto to minimize this. You know, instead of using multiple uis, users can just go to dot exchange and send their money, for example, BTC to other blockchains, for example such as Starknet, with just one.
00:01:00.290 - 00:01:09.586, Speaker B: Nice. So you're, is it fair to say you're a cross chain bridge or is it more of an exchange? How do you integrate both?
00:01:09.768 - 00:01:37.610, Speaker A: We are both cross chain and Dex bridge aggregator. We don't have any liquidity. We integrate other liquidities into our UI and using both smart contract or maybe for other blockchains that doesn't support smart contract, we just integrate them in our backend. So we supporting both one step single transaction and multi step transactions.
00:01:38.430 - 00:01:46.720, Speaker B: Interesting. And in that work that you guys are doing, which chains are you live on currently?
00:01:47.570 - 00:02:14.600, Speaker A: Right now we are totally chain agnostic. We don't rely on other chains. We are deciding to launch our token in one chain, but hasn't decided yet because we want to check with our investors and then start for launching our token. But yeah, we don't have any chain right now.
00:02:14.970 - 00:02:23.930, Speaker B: No, my question is, which coins and which chain can your users interact with on wrangle exchange?
00:02:25.870 - 00:02:45.330, Speaker A: They can use all. I mean, wrangle is supporting 53 blockchains including alivms, Utxos, ZK Rollabs, for example, Startnet. So users can swap from 10,000 tokens to these chains.
00:02:46.390 - 00:03:13.338, Speaker B: Wow, 10,000 token and 53 chains is a lot. How do you manage to maintain a tech stack that spans 53 blockchain and how do you manage to maintain knowledge in your team, like 20 people to manage 10,000 assets seems like, yeah, it's pretty hard.
00:03:13.424 - 00:04:03.100, Speaker A: And our team is really experienced both in financial and tech, especially our dev teams, and they are updating themselves very fast. For example, when we want to integrate starnet, it's a really great journey for them because they should do some rnds because it's very different with other EVM blockchains. So yeah, our team is really sharp and they easily investigate around other blockchains as well as our dev business teams because they should see the trends and tell our devs, hey, this is the next trend, and we should integrate it or we should expand our protocol in there.
00:04:03.630 - 00:04:13.454, Speaker B: And where is most of the volume on wrangle going to or from right now? What is the chain? Most of your users are using the.
00:04:13.492 - 00:04:56.330, Speaker A: Important chains right now. Most of them are evms, but we recently integrated, as I said, the roll ups, Starknet and ZK sync era. And we have a marketing plan to start some trading competition to bring the volume in there, especially in Starknet, because we want to do adoption, I mean, more user adoption in these chains as well. But right now, the most popular chain is, I think, BSC, arbitrum. Polygon and optimism.
00:04:57.070 - 00:05:12.240, Speaker B: Interesting. So you mentioned that you guys integrated Starknet recently. Can you talk a little bit about this? How did the process go? Did you write code in Cairo? In Cairo, one. How did you. Did the process?
00:05:12.690 - 00:05:52.700, Speaker A: Oh, regarding the process, I mean, in detail for the development, since I'm not a dev, I don't know the details, but for bringing a starknet, I mean, in procravity from other chains to a starknet, we integrated orbiter finance, but we are looking for layer swap to integrate it as well, because we want to have two or more bridges between other chains to a start net as well as right now. We integrated ten K swap, but we want to integrate Jedi swap as well.
00:05:55.710 - 00:06:19.510, Speaker B: Okay, really nice. Interesting. So, can I ask, what's the flow when you do an order on wrangle? Is it custodial, or how do you manage to do something cross chain? Does the user send you money and then you convert it and send it the other way? Is it custodial? Is it trusted? Is it.
00:06:19.660 - 00:06:58.610, Speaker A: Oh, it's not custodial. Users can just connect their wallets. For example, suppose that users want to go from arbitrarion to starknet, they can connect their metamask and argent, and after that they can, for example, send their money from arbitrum to starknet, because, for example, for arbitrum to a starknet, we have orbiter, but I think it's already halted. Also for onchain swap. Again, we have ten k swaps in starknet, so all things is in an uncustodial manner.
00:07:00.470 - 00:07:05.720, Speaker B: Okay, so you're providing an interface for people to use ten k swap, is that correct?
00:07:06.250 - 00:07:11.000, Speaker A: Exactly. If I can present it. Let me just change.
00:07:24.760 - 00:07:37.930, Speaker B: There's a bird behind you. So if you click on present, you should be able to share your screen, and then I'll add it to the screen.
00:07:39.100 - 00:07:45.310, Speaker A: I think I can write now. Can you see my screen?
00:07:47.120 - 00:07:48.350, Speaker B: We can now.
00:07:49.840 - 00:08:58.788, Speaker A: Great. Now you can see my screen, for example, suppose that right now is startnet. I mean, orbiter is halted. So I want to swap from startnet from east to die if I just click two. Let me do another example for you. For example, from BSC to osmosis and you can see the routes, for example, bnb to acceler, USTC, and after that from USDC osmosis to osmo and we did something. If, for example, we have orbiter again back online.
00:08:58.788 - 00:09:07.450, Speaker A: This is the same route that happens when users go from, for example, bsc or osmosis to a starknet or from other.
00:09:12.140 - 00:09:31.872, Speaker B: Want to, for example, if you want to swap from BSC to Starknet and you're using, know, I haven't used orbiter yet, so I don't know how well connected it is to, for example, BSc. How do you deal when you need to go from, for example, from one chain to another and there's another chain in the middle? Can you do this?
00:09:31.926 - 00:10:10.476, Speaker A: Oh, that's a great question. I can't show you right now, unfortunately. But I can tell you theoretically, for example, users want to go from BnB to starknet and orbiter doesn't support BnB. So we do another swap and breach to go from eth in Ethereum or maybe arbitrari. It's based on the best rate and the fees. I think the arbitrum is the best for the fees. And after that the routes goes through our orbiter and then start.
00:10:10.658 - 00:10:14.220, Speaker B: So there is a delay, right, when you want to execute such a swap.
00:10:14.720 - 00:10:27.410, Speaker A: Exactly, because, for example, we should manage it and go from more routes. So for example, we add one bridge and swap again.
00:10:28.180 - 00:10:38.790, Speaker B: Interesting. Super cool. So how should people who have a DeFi protocol on Starknet reach out to you in order to get integrated into.
00:10:39.560 - 00:11:01.980, Speaker A: Oh, that's a great question because right now we develop our infrastructure, both API SDK and widget. We also had a couple of discussions with other projects in the Starknet, so they can, for example, reach out to us or have a telegram chat, discord chat, et cetera, and we can share with them an API key and they can use our infra.
00:11:03.040 - 00:11:09.150, Speaker B: Wonderful, right? So when do you think people will be able to use target? Is this live already?
00:11:09.840 - 00:11:33.590, Speaker A: Yeah, it's already live, but they can do just on chain swap. When the orbiter back online, they can do sophisticated swaps. I mean, brilliant. Swap from other chains to Starknet. But we will integrate layer swap, have two backup in the Starknet, and Starnet will be always.
00:11:38.920 - 00:11:58.156, Speaker B: So you've integrated Starknet, what's on the roadmap for Wrangle, do you plan on providing more swapping services, integrating other chains, moving to also other areas? Would it be possible, for example, for me to, I don't know, lend money on chain a and borrow money on.
00:11:58.178 - 00:13:00.290, Speaker A: Chain b in Ringo? Because right now we have all important chains except for up to source three. But we want to bring this interoperability as well as mass adoption to these chains. We want to have all marketing campaign with all those important chains again. And after that we may have other site projects near Rango, for example, not decided yet, but we should decide in for example 2024 and 2025 for being in cross chain yield aggregator or something like that. Another interesting area is cross chain NFT breach that. If for example, great project starts building something like this, we can start integrated as well.
00:13:05.160 - 00:13:21.784, Speaker B: I'm answering questions on the chat. Some people are asking will wrangle be an l free on top of Storknet? From what I understand, you're more like an aggregator, so it doesn't seem like you're going to be running your own chain, is that correct?
00:13:21.982 - 00:13:33.580, Speaker A: Exactly. And Rango is totally free just on chain fees. So we didn't charge or we won't charge any extra fees for our users.
00:13:35.600 - 00:13:39.070, Speaker B: Interesting. If I may ask, how do you guys make money?
00:13:41.300 - 00:13:57.750, Speaker A: We make some revenue model for ourselves. For example, we have a deal with other dexes and bridges that we are integrating with them to, for example, have this revenue sharing model or something like that. Yes.
00:13:58.360 - 00:14:12.280, Speaker B: Okay, interesting. All right, look, are there specific features you want to present or specific things you want to announce?
00:14:13.820 - 00:14:33.420, Speaker A: No, I think just I want to update the Starknet community about Wrangler that we brought these interesting features and interoperability between other chains to Starknet. I hope to see orbiter back online again for Starknet. And users can use Rengo.
00:14:34.240 - 00:14:38.800, Speaker B: Wonderful. Can people try it? So it's on mainnet right now, right?
00:14:38.950 - 00:14:39.650, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:14:40.100 - 00:14:42.000, Speaker B: And there's nothing on testnet?
00:14:42.740 - 00:14:45.360, Speaker A: No, it's just on Mainnet.
00:14:46.280 - 00:14:53.590, Speaker B: Super cool. All right, thank you. Is there anything you want to mention.
00:14:55.320 - 00:15:07.050, Speaker A: Right now? No, but stay tuned. We want to start some cool stuff with the startnet in the community. So we will update you guys again.
00:15:07.580 - 00:15:09.900, Speaker B: Okay. All right, thank you, Martin.
00:15:10.400 - 00:15:11.244, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:15:11.362 - 00:15:22.350, Speaker B: So we'll make sure to share your socials on Twitter. We'll retweet them. And by the way, they're also on our profile. You can find Ringo exchange on.
00:15:22.720 - 00:15:24.944, Speaker A: Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.
00:15:25.062 - 00:15:26.572, Speaker B: Wonderful. Thank you, Martin.
00:15:26.636 - 00:15:29.104, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you for having us. Thank you.
00:15:29.222 - 00:16:13.588, Speaker B: Please. So we still have a bit of time for the community call. So I'm going to make a very small update about the latest version of Starknet that went live yesterday on Starknet. I think it's on Testnet. It's zero point 11.1. The main thing you'll be interested to hear about in zero point 11.1 is that the compiler version for Cairo, one for Starknet has been updated, so you should now update your dev workflow so that when you deploy a contract you use the latest target version of Cairo.
00:16:13.588 - 00:17:07.180, Speaker B: One part of the exciting stuff that this enables is that you'll now be able to use loops in your smart contracts. So that's the latest thing that was updated on Stocknet. Next major version will be zero point twelve, which we'll talk about extensively in the upcoming weeks. And zero point twelve will be mostly about the new rust sequencer. So expect throughput enhancement. You'll be able to send your transaction much faster on Starknet. And the Europa twelve is also going to be a pretty big milestone because it's going to be the first major version that ships with a significant amount of code that was written by somebody else than Starquare.
00:17:07.180 - 00:17:50.380, Speaker B: It's one of those silent processes or little processes that you don't necessarily pay attention but are really important. But the process of developing and maintaining Starknet is slowly decentralizing and moving to more and more ecosystem players, and we are very happy to be releasing this new version soon that includes code by other people in Starquare. So we'll talk about this in the upcoming weeks. If you have questions around zero point twelve, don't hesitate. Send them here, send them on Twitter and that's it. We'll talk about this more extensively in the upcoming weeks. I don't have much too much else to mention.
00:17:50.380 - 00:18:13.520, Speaker B: Let me check on Twitter and YouTube if there are some questions. I don't see any for now, so that should be okay. All right, so let's wrap it up. Thank you everyone for your attention, and I'll see you in a week or so. Bye.
