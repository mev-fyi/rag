00:00:03.700 - 00:00:39.670, Speaker A: Hi, my name is Leron. I'm a business development manager at Starquare. Today's panel is going to be about DeFi on Starknet. If you were in the previous panel, I think you heard a lot about the production journey of deploying an app on Starknet learning. Cairo, the migration to Cairo 1.0, the Regenesis. A lot of that stuff might be covered again in this panel, but I think with the more of it, we'll try and put more of a light on the apps going into production in the DFI space.
00:00:39.670 - 00:00:51.004, Speaker A: So, on that note, let's do a bit of introductions, maybe present who you are and the protocol that you're representing. We'll just go in clockwise.
00:00:51.072 - 00:01:32.660, Speaker B: So, hello, everyone. It's a great pleasure to be here. Starburst session is an awesome event, and I think it will be one to remember after many years ahead. And also, it's a great pleasure for me to be in the same panel with Richard again, and of course, with this gentleman here with whom we have a collaboration. So, my name is Aris, I'm Debril in hashtag, where we build ZK native money market under collateralized lending protocol where we can facilitate loans of up to three x your collateral and without credit scores.
00:01:35.560 - 00:02:18.960, Speaker C: Yeah. Hi, guys, my name is Vitali, I'm the co founder and CTO at company called GKX. We've started our protocol business trading platform. What? Year and a half ago? You've probably seen my presentation year ago, half a year ago in Amsterdam. What we do, we develop a trading platform for perpetual swaps with lots of complex trading instruments and financial instruments that you usually see in traditional industries. We've managed to bring it to perpetual swaps, which wasn't easy. We have another product which is the universal bridge from, well, one to l two, called Starkway.
00:02:18.960 - 00:02:33.260, Speaker C: Lots of things, lots of developments. We have team we're proud of and thank you very much for having me here. It's amazing event. Thank you very much, guys, and shalom.
00:02:33.840 - 00:03:03.440, Speaker D: Hey, everyone. So I'm Richard, head of product at Nostra. And what is Nostra? So, we are building the liquidity layer on Starknet. And liquidity layer is comprised of three core products. So one is Nostra money market, where users can simply lend and borrow crypto. The second is Uno, which is an over collateralized stablecoin, collateralized by ETh. And then the third is Nostra swap, which is a stablecoin Dex.
00:03:03.440 - 00:03:15.690, Speaker D: And together, collectively, we call that the liquidity layer. And we think that that's going to be the one stop shop defi solution for users that we can grow and scale with.
00:03:18.700 - 00:03:38.930, Speaker A: So in, I was just saying before the people coming in now, the previous panel talked about a lot that we wanted to cover. So I'm trying to focus more on the product side of Defi, on Starknet. So maybe I'll throw out a few terms, get a bit of your opinions on this stuff. So, under collateralized lending, is that something that's possible on the blockchain? How are you planning to solve that?
00:03:40.180 - 00:04:25.740, Speaker B: Yes, of course. And there are projects facilitating that, like, let's say maple finance, but they are focused towards institutional players and they have heavy KYC and credit score checking. So what we thought it's the best way to facilitate that, because Snida, it might seem. Okay, easy. And it's been an ask for quite some time now. So how we build it is, I will tell you with an example. So a user comes and pledges, let's say $100 as collateral.
00:04:25.740 - 00:04:53.060, Speaker B: Okay. And let's also assume that they choose to take the maximum as a loan. So $300.03 x. So they have also the ability to withdraw off chain almost instantly, up to 70% of their collateral. So from the $300 they took, they can take $70 to do whatever they want with it. But the rest, 230 can be utilized as in platform trading capital.
00:04:53.060 - 00:05:17.740, Speaker B: So these assets do not leave hashtag. But in order for them to have the incentives initially, we have credible dapps integrations, so they can go and trade them, for example, like Zkx or pantex swap, et cetera, so they can have some significant gains.
00:05:19.040 - 00:05:20.110, Speaker A: What's that?
00:05:21.380 - 00:06:06.064, Speaker C: You won't like my answer. I do believe that it's not possible on DeFi. And the reason why is because DeFi comes in all types and flavors. If we say that anything that runs on blockchain is DeFi, then absolutely yes, it's possible. But if we really talk decentralized architecture, decentralized organization that runs it, that natively means that you won't be able to run KYC on your clients. You cannot have any sensitive information on your clients. And if we take DeFi to extreme, and I would argue that extreme that is now is something that will say as a normal DeFi few years from now, then it won't be possible.
00:06:06.064 - 00:06:27.190, Speaker C: We will find a way to do ungolarized assets. We'll find a way to do the risk appetite management, risk management in general. But as of today, if we talk about DeFi as anything that runs on blockchain, yes. However, if we talk DeFi in terms of truly decentralized finance, then I don't think it's possible.
00:06:28.680 - 00:07:05.196, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, I would also agree with that point, but I think there's solutions to it, which is the road ahead. I think. I think capital inefficiency in DeFi is known. Like, things can't be over collateralized forever. That's not the world that we live in today. So if we kind of want to retrofit the current sort of markets into crypto, we have a whole bunch of leverage and debt that is under collateralized by nature, by fractionalization. So I think the fact that people are anonymous, it's permissionless.
00:07:05.196 - 00:07:33.720, Speaker D: Yes. There's no recourse to anyone, any bad actor taking a loan out and running away with the money and what have you, having a good time. So I think when it comes to online digital identities, or blockchain identities and soul bound sort of NFT wallets, I think that's probably not wallets, but nfts attached and bounded to your wallet or your identity. I think that's where perhaps we can progress further into reducing the collateralization requirements.
00:07:34.220 - 00:07:35.536, Speaker A: You want to add something, Arith?
00:07:35.588 - 00:08:27.310, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. So I totally get the skepticism from the guys here. But first of all, since the assets do not leave the ecosystem, so there's no way for the protocol to be in jeopardy at any time. And in the KYC thing, I think the ZK proofs can help hugely towards that. So no sensitive data of people will be sent to either us or any other entity. And because sooner or later KVC will be kind of implemented from governance. But with ZK proofs, I think we can bypass that with huge success.
00:08:29.360 - 00:08:48.880, Speaker C: Literally. One thing to add, I think there is the difference between DeFi run by centralized organization, that stands behind it, and DeFi run by DeFi organization. And this will set the rules and structure for how it can be run. Hence the difference in approach. Obviously, I tend to agree.
00:08:48.950 - 00:09:28.860, Speaker A: My goal was to find something that the panelists would disagree on, and I think I succeeded, which is, I'm happy with the next point on DeFi I wanted to pick up on. For those who've traded on DyDx or other stockx instances, you're probably familiar with this, this idea of having an off chain order book, or like, just for a bit of picture for those in the audience, uniswap on layer one Ethereum, you have these automated market makers, liquidity providers, are putting funds into a liquidity pool. They're not like putting in granularity. I want to buy at this price, sell at this price. What are your opinions on this whole order book architecture? I see the smile Vitali in the DFI wealth, let's call it broadly.
00:09:29.020 - 00:10:04.472, Speaker C: Thank you Leron. Guys, we have another 40 minutes. I have things to say that's true. So I don't know if you know, we run the first and only decentralized order book. Decentralized limit order book, which is partially on chain and partially within, sits within our decentralized node network. We always had a choice to go with Amm, like lots of businesses do. But for us, the difference between running a good balanced amm and running decentralized limited order book is level of control you can have over your trading.
00:10:04.472 - 00:11:12.640, Speaker C: And this is especially important when you talk to very experienced traders, when you talk retail, and when you talk about very experienced institutional traders. The order book itself is the difficult tool to build. Decentralized limit order book is almost impossible to build. I don't know if there are anyone here in the audience that know the complexities that sits behind the order book, but effectively it's the speed of matching, speed of execution, which can be achieved when you sit in the centralized environment, and there are very good protocols that do this with the off chain matching and computation and execution. But when you bring decentralized aspects into this, it becomes ten times not difficult. But there are challenges that needs to be resolved and we've spent almost two years solving these challenges. So obviously I will always say that decentralized audiobook in general is a better approach than amm simply by how much control you can have over your trading.
00:11:14.900 - 00:11:48.270, Speaker B: Yeah, I totally agree with Vitali on this, and I will answer from the perspective of a trader. I used to be one initially. Almost everyone probably starts like this, so it is definitely an improvement in your experience when you're trading in a decentralized environment, having order books, no doubt. I don't think anyone can disagree on that.
00:11:49.760 - 00:12:00.450, Speaker A: So let's just play devil's advocate. How do you solve for challenges? Like a market maker wants to cancel an order, but they're concerned that a validator might trade against that order instead of canceling it.
00:12:01.940 - 00:12:55.936, Speaker C: It's not the problem of timing of execution, it's the problem what you give as the time step for the execution. If you agree on super fast transaction, on super fast closing of the order book, then it's not a technical issue. What we operate, we operate what we call partial knowledge of the state, which means that we have a massive, massive order book where we find the best price for your order, for your position and for your order. It doesn't necessarily mean that we check all order book across the network because that would be impossible in terms of the closing in certain amount of time. But as long as we can guarantee through the ZK that we find the best price for you within the tick of the system, then it works. And we prove that works. And on top of everything, the tps we have in our testnet is.
00:12:55.936 - 00:13:06.870, Speaker C: Again, I'm not naming any competitors, but we are roughly ten x to 20 x in terms of the TPS of the order book, which is decentralized. I cannot stress how proud I am of that.
00:13:07.560 - 00:13:08.576, Speaker A: It is my baby.
00:13:08.608 - 00:13:12.570, Speaker C: I know, but what you can do now with the technology is amazing.
00:13:17.020 - 00:13:44.930, Speaker A: Okay, the last thing on the defi side, and then we'll shift to the starnet side, maybe just like Eli Benzason talked about his mother a lot today, let's pretend his mother's in the audience. Just describe the use case of a typical user using a protocol. Why are they using the protocol? What are they benefiting? Like, what else would they be considering? And what are they benefiting from using you?
00:13:46.980 - 00:14:30.156, Speaker D: With that in mind, I remember quite vividly 2009 financial crisis. I don't know if anyone's from the UK, but there was news going out there and people were lining outside banks trying to get their money right. Doors were closed, typical, kind of like bank run, but there wasn't enough money to give to people. And that's a centralized entity that everybody entrusted with their money, their savings, and they can't get access to it. And I think that's key, and that's always stuck in my mind. And I've worked in traditional finance for just under ten years, and it's the system that we live in today. But I don't think that's the right thing for tomorrow.
00:14:30.156 - 00:15:23.164, Speaker D: And I think having the ability to be your own sort of self sovereign, self custody, I guess guardian of your own assets is key. I think right now it's lagging because of the UX. It's a bit of a hurdle for people to understand. But I think the benefit is that the core benefit of DeFi, at least in my view, is that you have your own assets and you own your assets, you always have access, and nobody can sort of revoke that away from you at any point in time. I think that more and more as government censorship occurs and this skepticism around centralization and central entities having control over your life, your crypto, your data, I think DeFi is the answer in crypto.
00:15:23.212 - 00:16:00.732, Speaker C: In general, I literally cannot second this more. And the reason being, as the co founder of the DeFi protocol or DeFi business, the question I hear most is why Defi? Realistically speaking, it's time to change the narrative here. And rather than saying why Defi, we should ask, you're doing centralized finance. Why? Why it's not DeFi. So rather than why DeFi, it has to change. And the reason for that is we've seen times and times how the centralized financial institutions fail. And it is inherently because of the structure of how they set up.
00:16:00.732 - 00:16:46.030, Speaker C: So the moment when we change the narrative and we say that DeFi is your go to way to set up a financial instrument, a financial company and institution, I think will resolve lots of issues here. And the beauty of DeFi, that, yes, it does have different flavors of, we do it on blockchain, hence it's DeFi. Yes, it's still controlled by one account and one wallet to the stage of it is truly DeFi, truly decentralized. If we'll stop saying that companies like freelancers are DeFi, then we'll be in a better place to start with. So for me, it is change of the narrative from why DeFi to DeFi is the only true way to build a business that won't fail to build a protocol that won't let you down.
00:16:47.760 - 00:17:13.780, Speaker B: Yeah, for me. Okay, guys, touched the center core of Defi. And I totally agree, of course. But adding some. One, two more points. First of all, DeFi is more fair. If we see the current traditional finance landscape, you're basically getting zero interest when you provide them liquidity.
00:17:13.780 - 00:17:54.450, Speaker B: This is not the case in DeFi. It's way more fair. Secondly, the transaction fees are at the hundreds of times less. And most of all, you have that privacy thing where you don't need to bring out your life story and sensitive data, which in many cases, we have seen that they can be touching the point of fundamental human rights, so they get aggregated and used in malicious ways.
00:17:55.540 - 00:18:52.230, Speaker D: I think just also another point that I just thought about is we're kind of moving our trust from humans to computers in a way, and trying to build this trustless system, right? And I think over time, we've seen many bad actors come in human form and rug pull people, right? Whether that's name your Ponzi. I think trying to abstract or remove that away, that risk and move it into contracts, is sort of the way of tomorrow. And then also you have the banks and the financial system and the amount of rent seeking that they have, right? There's a huge amount of bonuses and huge amount of inefficiencies in that system. I think as humans, we look to improve on things, and I think those are two sort of vectors to look at.
00:18:53.480 - 00:19:52.712, Speaker C: Absolutely, yes. And there is also a factor of integrity. There is a saying that integrity is when you do the right thing, when no one's watching. And integrity in this sense implies trust. So if you work with organization or type of business or type of protocol where you have way to act, maybe in a way that doesn't support integrity in how you deal with the client funds or funds in general, if we build a system, if we build a narrative where you simply have no way to act in a way that is not inherently trustless, doesn't require trust, then half the problems here will be resolved from the get go. So integrity is important when you require it as the setup of the trust. But working in the environment where it's not required gives you way more freedom in a way, how you work with your clients and the client funds and.
00:19:52.766 - 00:20:33.844, Speaker A: Other businesses add to this, most of my day job is talking about Starkex and selling it to businesses. DydX, as you know, is powered by Starkex. There are a few other exchanges and a few marketplaces powered by it. And when you go on these educational journeys with the customer and suddenly this coin clicks inside them, that you can have this self custody while still being able to trade, and it's the same on these platforms as well. That's a very powerful value proposition. And it's one of these things you only appreciate when it's threatened. You have funds on FTX, you'll never see them again.
00:20:33.844 - 00:21:11.490, Speaker A: Probably your funds on a defi protocol. There are smart contract risks, there are other risks, but at least this idea that on a theoretical level, you have self custody while you're still able to trade, there's real value out there. Shifting gears, let's talk about Starknet a bit. So perhaps maybe each of you can talk a bit about your Cairo journey, the ups and downs, maybe a bit more about the ups and downs. The journey towards Mainnet together with starknet itself going through some changes and upgrades and where you're at now.
00:21:14.020 - 00:21:59.472, Speaker C: If there is one particular thing that I'm proud of, that is coining the term Kurzelik. I don't know if you guys remember or have seen my presentation from Amsterdam much last year, but I was talking about how long it takes to bring new developers into Cairo. And I found the term kerslic, from Swedish, that means kind of happy place. And at the time I said that it takes two weeks to two months for a good developer to completely be onboarded to the system. And from that perspective, I think the timeline in this year and a half hasn't changed. For us, what has changed is amount of things we can explain to a new developer that comes to the engineering team. It still takes two weeks to two months.
00:21:59.472 - 00:22:56.332, Speaker C: But amount of things we can talk about, amount of tutorials, amount of hackathons we can show, amount of screencast is incomparable. It was an uphill battle even a year ago to explain how it works. The intrinsic is off of zero knowledge, the carrots of the starknet, especially when someone's coming from solidity. And we even found that it is easier to bring someone with very basic solidity knowledge because the experienced solidity developers are very sad in their ways. But now things are different. One of the issues for me as the person who hires the engineering team in our business was how can I convince a developer to even join us? Because like Cairo, I mean, what's that? It's completely different now. Everyone knows what the Cairo is, everyone knows what the GKE is, and amounts of materials that are available is just staggering.
00:22:56.332 - 00:23:17.080, Speaker C: And this is the biggest, biggest change I've seen in the last year and a half. Amazing. And this is all not just because of us, not because of this panel, but because of every developer that is working in an ecosystem. This is really truly the best ecosystem in blockchain I've seen in all my years. And I've seen a lot. It's brilliant.
00:23:18.940 - 00:23:54.260, Speaker D: Yeah. So I'll come from a non dev perspective, but I've got the gospel from the mean. We started developing Nostra, I think in sort of May last year, and we've recently launched Alpha on December. Quickshell, sorry. But yeah, go and check it out. So I think at the beginning it was fine. The devs are pretty well stacked, we've got a great team and it took a few weeks, but I think the only bug in issue for them was testing.
00:23:54.260 - 00:24:13.820, Speaker D: I think testing was a bit of a pain from what I understand. And I think that majorly improved with Starknet, hard hat plugin and proto star coming into play as well. So I think from that perspective, our development cycle and development timeline is a lot more smoother.
00:24:15.120 - 00:24:22.940, Speaker C: I have literally printed one of the slides from that presentation in Amsterdam that I put in my office that says debugging is the bane of my existence.
00:24:23.700 - 00:24:25.200, Speaker D: Agreed. Confirmed.
00:24:27.540 - 00:25:42.336, Speaker B: Thank you. So our journey started early last summer where we started digging a bit around what Starknet is and what benefits brings with it if we deploy. And it was a no brainer that after not so long that, okay, this is definitely, we will definitely launch on Starnet. And we announced our strategic partnership around August. The problems are more or less what the guys said here. So when as a developer you are used to work in solidity and you feel this is the norm and this goes to every sector, not only blockchain, it kind of feels strange to migrate and learn something else and it comes with a skepticism also. Okay, will I be good at this? What problems will I face, et cetera.
00:25:42.336 - 00:26:30.490, Speaker B: But if you are a good dev, then yes, you can adapt. And the two month period is how long it took to adapt and be at a very decent level. Okay, Cairo has the challenges that it's a language that continuously evolves. So once you feel you conquered something, then something new update comes out and you have to go back to school. But I think now with the Cairo 1.0 we will have quite of a different scenario and a more stable framework where all these things will be scaled down.
00:26:32.220 - 00:26:33.624, Speaker A: Did you want it?
00:26:33.822 - 00:27:13.876, Speaker C: There is also one additional trend that I think worth mentioning. My background is initially in traditional software engineering. I'm in the field of software engineering for last 25 years. What I've seen even five years ago in the blockchain industry is the protocols and projects working in the blockchain industry do not apply. Same way of development and engineering as you would see in the normal businesses. What I mean is proper sprints, quality assurance test coverage, ability to run normal tools for linting and for debugging. Now it started to change.
00:27:13.876 - 00:27:41.790, Speaker C: I talked to a lot of different protocols and things have changed. Now the type of approach you have in engineering in Cairo, in blockchain in general, becomes similar to traditional approach where quality is the paramount. It hasn't been like that even two, three years ago. Now you talk to other protocols, other engineers, and quality of the code is the paramount. Now that's massive change.
00:27:43.120 - 00:28:30.940, Speaker A: I'll just anecdotal on my side. So many teams who come to us and say, oh, but you're not in solidity. Often what they're saying between the lines is, well, we wanted to fork Unisop v two and not do any work ourselves, but now we're not able to because you're not in solidity, you're in Cairo. So being forced to write in a new language and actually do some hard work yourself really builds a fantastic organic community. And I think one proof of this is having protocols like you on the stage and not having l one apps that are just being redeployed on another evm chain without actually any new work being done. The other big difference with Cairo versatility is really the tooling. You mentioned Protestar, but then Cairo gets an upgrade in protestars two months late with the release.
00:28:30.940 - 00:29:20.840, Speaker A: That is something that just takes time. But like you're saying, the traditional world also has migrations to new code bases frequently and grid engineers just overcome that hump. We have 1 minute left. Any questions from the audience? I don't see any hands, so I will ask on behalf of the audience. Oh, there we go. One guy. Understand we're hard to instantiate.
00:29:37.190 - 00:30:01.974, Speaker C: That is superb question. Thank you very much indeed. One thing that we didn't mention here is TPS is good, scalability is awesome. Low cost brilliant. The thing that I love most in stocknet is account obstruction. This is really game changer for us and for any other DeFi protocol. The ability to run account abstraction in Stacknet is literally, I'm not kidding, the best thing I've sliced bread.
00:30:01.974 - 00:30:11.610, Speaker C: So if we talk about two things that we enjoy, TPS, obviously we have business to run, so we need to have lower costs, but account abstraction and what you can do with it.
00:30:11.680 - 00:30:15.266, Speaker A: But we have to otherwise, brilliant question though.
00:30:15.288 - 00:30:16.514, Speaker C: So thank you.
00:30:16.712 - 00:30:26.210, Speaker A: So we'll just wrap up here. Thank you. To Aris, to Vitali, to Richard. You're welcome to come up and ask questions, but let's clear, we're going to clear this floor so the next presentation can come up.
00:30:26.280 - 00:30:27.086, Speaker C: Thank you, Mash Leon.
00:30:27.118 - 00:30:28.100, Speaker B: Thank you very much.
00:30:28.470 - 00:30:28.880, Speaker C: Thank you.
