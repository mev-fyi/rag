00:00:00.630 - 00:00:20.966, Speaker A: You. It's not a pitch competition. There are no prizes, no judges, only positive feedback. And it's not a demo day. It's going to be 14 short pitches, one after the other, two and a half minutes each. And after the pitching session, you're invited to hang out outside. We're going to have tables.
00:00:20.966 - 00:00:59.580, Speaker A: On each table, there's a small sign that says a name of one of the teams. So, founders, please find your table. And the purpose of this is basically to connect. Like, we have a lot of investors in this room. I know that we have guests from Andreessen, we have Joey from Pantera, who's also a board member at Starkware, who's going to come up and say a few words in a second, and many, many more great vcs. And we have a lot of founders, and we have a lot of founders to be maybe people who came here to feel the energy, and maybe they're planning to start working on the startup soon. So everyone's welcome.
00:00:59.580 - 00:01:32.390, Speaker A: A few more words about logistics before we hand it over to Joey. So here's the lineup. That's going to be the order in which teams are going to come up. So if you see your name here, please line up on the side so that teams could change quickly. And the QR code here is for the investors in this room. You're going to see this QR over and over between each presentation, so there's no rush. This is basically going to lead you to a form that you could fill, and through this form, we will help you make intros to the teams.
00:01:32.390 - 00:02:06.160, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's it for logistics. One last thing is that I'd really ask teams to not go over the two and a half minute slots that they're allocated. There's a secret door here on the floor that's going to open up if you go over the two and a half minutes. And there might be an auditorium downstairs, maybe there are people there. So I'd recommend not going over your time. There's a stopwatch down here. You can see how much time you have left.
00:02:06.160 - 00:02:10.180, Speaker A: All right, so, Joey, what do you want to say? A few words.
00:02:14.230 - 00:02:54.640, Speaker B: Awesome. This is really cool to see. I remember when we invested in Starquare, like five years ago, we always envisioned that people would build on it, but it's cool to see so many people in one place actually building on top of Starquare. I'd say I look forward to seeing the pitches I'll be around after. The only advice I'd have is a two and a half minute pitch is really difficult, and I would say maybe talk about the problem you're solving and why your solution is special, because you don't really have time to get into why your team is amazing or all the intricate features of your product when you have such little time. So that's kind of the only bit of advice I would have for people.
00:02:56.610 - 00:03:10.790, Speaker A: All right, and now I'm going to hand it over to Jocelyn from alliance. She's going to talk more about what alliance is, but I'm just going to say that we're super thankful to alliance for helping us set this up and prepare some of the pitches together with the founders.
00:03:11.290 - 00:03:25.050, Speaker C: All right. Hi, everyone. Welcome. My name is Jocelyn. I'm with alliance, the leading founder and web3 accelerator. So I'm excited to be your mc today, but to not take the limelight from our founders, I'd like to bring our first team up at Lendis.
00:03:29.630 - 00:03:57.634, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you. How does it work? Okay, cool. Hi, everyone. Hi, I'm Alex C. Co founder of Atlantis decentralized private debt marketplace. The private debt market is the fastest growing market in the credit sector and one of the largest market in the world, sizing at a whopping $1.5
00:03:57.634 - 00:05:11.530, Speaker A: trillion. But despite its importance, this market is exceptionally opaque, illiquid, and reserved to a few high net worth individuals. Accessing this market is done through large institutions such as private debt funds and investment banks that have a high entry cost and offer poor visibilities regarding global opportunities. Atlantis is a permissioned and permissionless protocol that is transparent and capital efficient and allows real world businesses to borrow digital assets on chain and receive funds in fiat directly on their bank account. Fintechs and institutional borrowers can access loans on chain through dedicated borrower pools that they can withdraw from whenever needed. Funds are immediately converted to fiat and transferred to their bank account, thus abstracting the crypto complexity completely. Anyone can earn an attractive and sustainable yield by selecting their rates and depositing funds directly through all order book style pools that in return allowed them to have granular control over depositions inside the protocol.
00:05:11.530 - 00:05:58.954, Speaker A: To date, Atlantis has over 5200 unique lenders and issued more than $6 million in loans with zero default. I was an early DeFi engineer at Consensus, where I met my two cofounders, Stefan and Charlote. Charlote holds two master's degree, one in quantitative finance from EPFL and one in machine learning from telecom Pytech. Stefan led multiple technical teams at consensus and holds a master of engineering from local polytechnic. We raised $5.5 million from top class investors and be on the lookout as we'll be releasing Ov two in April and doing a series a later down the year. We also aim at being one of the first protocol to pilot its infrastructure through Stocknet on the layer two while keeping its liquidity on the layer one.
00:05:58.954 - 00:06:02.540, Speaker A: We'd love to talk to you about any of the next challenges. Thank you very much.
00:06:05.490 - 00:06:09.470, Speaker C: All right, thank you so much. Up next we have Redstone.
00:06:18.660 - 00:07:04.108, Speaker D: All right, good morning everyone. My name is Marcin, I'm a co founder of Redstone Oracle providing data just in time. So decentralized finance has getting more and more sophisticated solutions such as options, derivatives and perps. Even though in the last year the DeFi space has shrinked five times, these kind of protocols doubled in TVL. The problem is that such sophisticated DeFi protocols require high frequency data which is just too expensive to push on chain. Currently you have to cover gas costs even though you don't necessarily need data at a given moment. Hence, currently oracles provide 100 price feeds every ten minutes.
00:07:04.108 - 00:07:55.150, Speaker D: We cannot build the next generation of finance on such platforms. Even modems in 80s were quicker than that. So we created data delivery network that provides data directly to DAP with signatures of data providers. The data packages get on chain and are verified over there, so you get the same security with the fraction of a cost. We've been live on mainet for ten months already, so we are very happy to announce our first integration outside of EVM chains, which is Starknet, because we see the builders over here. We got a couple of audits. Hence such projects as Delta Prime, ZKX or Olympusdao trusted us.
00:07:55.150 - 00:08:41.736, Speaker D: I'm an ex program manager at Google Cloud, co creator, co founder of Eve Warsaw Hackathon. Last year I won Eve Bogota Hackathon. My co founder Jacob is the Gigabrain x Openzepoline smart contract auditor who also won couple of hackathons. We also have two other co founders who are seasoned engineers. We are all based in Poland. We've raised so far seven and a half million dollars from top tier vcs, from the web free space. And what we are looking for right now are warm interest to protocols that would like to revolutionize DeFi and get like a cutting edge with our oracles and also contact with us if you're willing to hear more about our future fundraise.
00:08:41.736 - 00:08:42.750, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:08:47.220 - 00:08:51.040, Speaker C: All right, fantastic. Up next, we have Giza.
00:08:57.940 - 00:09:42.008, Speaker E: Good morning everyone. I'm Frank, co founder of Giza fully trustless protocol from on chain AI at the moment. If you want to empower the blockchain with AI. You need to rely on oracles for using for gaming NFTs or DeFi, something that can lead to model downtimes or delays. On the Oracles and basically highly complex architectures. We are focused on the gaming NFDs and DeFi markets where we plan to power these different markets from 20 billion that is at the moment, for example on gaming to 200 billion by 2030 with a stable 35% growth per year. What we present is a fully trustless way to deploy train a models.
00:09:42.008 - 00:10:32.960, Speaker E: As a smart contract. We remove all the risk for deploying these models and using auto inspire we convert the models into these smart contracts that are composable so protocols can build on top. We don't need oracles to do that. Can be able, so people can own the models, can be traded, can be owned by the DAO, can be traded and also can generate usage fees as well as staking rewards for the owners. So also the stakers can be people in order to create the best models possible into the ecosystem. We have a very strong team of three founders. I'm the head of machine learning engineering at Adidas and me two other co founders are four times, three founders of different protocols.
00:10:32.960 - 00:10:52.490, Speaker E: And we have a very strong product roadmap and we plan to release by the end of the year. And we have more than 1000 people in the waitlist. We are currently looking for a seed round to help us release our latest product. And thank you very much everyone.
00:10:57.500 - 00:11:01.000, Speaker C: All right, thank you. Up next, we have garage.
00:11:10.510 - 00:11:44.118, Speaker A: Hello. All right, thumbs up. Hello everyone. My name is Zach, I'm a co founder at the Amherst Labs. And today I'm happy to present you the Gurig, which is the Ziki snark optimized interblockchain communication portal between Cosmos and Ziki rollabs. So some of you already know what is Cosmos hub is. So if somebody who doesn't know, it's a large number of interconnected blockchains who are also connected between IBC to each other.
00:11:44.118 - 00:12:37.190, Speaker A: And it currently has a market value of 11 billion. And there is currently 54 IBC zones connected to that and about 0.8 million of daily IBC volume. So what is Gerrick in a simple term? Since we have a very short time, I wanted to describe in a much simpler term. So if you think blockchain is the independent city and Giric is a new blockchain part city where Ziki chains meet with the independent roll ups. So in a way that we are creating a new way of how blockchains be able to choose and their compatible provider based on their preference and needs. And the current IBC architecture has several issues with the compatibility when it comes to caution.
00:12:37.190 - 00:13:31.974, Speaker A: Non centric Cosmos chains, we're able to minimize the gas efficiency with the Ziki snarks. And in the short term, we are being able to extend the security measures to it as well. So this is our team, and our team member yogurt has also contributed the Stocknet software development kit. So we first building the Chira architecture between Stocknet and Cosmos app. And if you have more information to that, please scan this so you can know more about what we are building with Ampere's labs and how we are envisioning the future of cross chain ecosystem. So we're here to go to finding our lead investor. And yeah, we wanted to see somebody who really sees how the crosschain is going to be important and moving on with Emperor's labs.
00:13:31.974 - 00:13:32.780, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:13:36.270 - 00:13:39.630, Speaker C: All right, up next, we have death Machine.
00:13:42.450 - 00:13:43.440, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:13:47.170 - 00:14:09.426, Speaker F: Thanks for having me. First of all, before I start, just want to say thank you to Starquare. I think there's a lot of really smart people in crypto, and there's a few really good people, and it's really rare for those to intersect. And I think with Starkware, they intersect perfectly. So thank you for having me. This is my project Death Machine. It's a zero knowledge game powered by recursive snarks.
00:14:09.426 - 00:14:50.050, Speaker F: I think crypto gaming is getting a lot of attention right now. And the thing that really excites me about crypto gaming is it allows you to deal with really abstract and complex subjects or ideas and kind of boil them down into something that's really manageable, that you can grasp and think about. So where crypto is today, and I think the thing that has everybody here is blockchains really face three big problems, and blockchain games face those problems as well. The first is they're slow, they're expensive, they're public. And when you're making a game, you have to face all of those things. And as I've been building games in the space over the last year, I've seen those really firsthand. But I want to talk about where we're going and why it makes me so excited.
00:14:50.050 - 00:15:42.434, Speaker F: So this is the future of crypto, and this is what's going to happen in the next year, in the next two years, and it's going to happen really fast. On one hand, we have the scaling, the l two scaling, like Starknet, that are coming up and are massively increasing the efficiency of these systems. But on the other hand, we're also seeing these massive breakthroughs on the client side, on the user side, on what can happen on the actual user computers that is being powered by recursive ZK snarks. New repos are coming out almost every week on this technology, and the amount of breakthroughs that are happening are just incredibly powerful and incredibly exciting. And we're looking at a future where people are going to be able to do incredible things with their phones. And the way I think about it, that I think everybody can think about it, is imagine having an l two on your phone for like 5 seconds or five minutes, that then disappears after it proves it, and that's really powerful. So how do we get there? So this is my game called Death Machine, and this is the front end of it.
00:15:42.434 - 00:16:33.090, Speaker F: And I think I'm just going to walk you through really quickly, show you what it is, and maybe that illustrates the technology a little bit. So users generate an actual game board, and that's generated on chain, and that's immutable on chain, but the rest of the game logic is exported to the actual recursive snarks, and we're offloading all the rest of the computation. Users input their actual commands here, and then they generate a proof of those commands which runs through the actual game logic and is able to offload a tremendous amount of computation. Okay, this is our roadmap. Our first prototype is complete. We're really going towards our alpha launch February 20. I'm working on our technical write up, and then we are doing a hard launch, not a soft launch, main net on April 7.
00:16:33.090 - 00:16:49.334, Speaker F: About myself, my name is Simon Judd. I go by Big sky on Twitter. I've been very active in crypto since 2020. I was at a project called Index Co op where I raised a lot of money and helped them grow a lot. And before that I spent six years as an infantry officer in the United States Marine Corps.
00:16:49.382 - 00:16:50.140, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:16:52.670 - 00:16:56.810, Speaker C: Thank you. And up next, we have fibris.
00:17:06.110 - 00:17:48.470, Speaker F: We are here for fibris Finance, which is developed by Starknet turkish community and it's a Dex aggregator of Starknet. I am lush and I'm giving my. Hey, I'm Jennar. So you know that there is a DeFi ecosystem in the starknet is growing rapidly with many of the new Dapps also the other chains Dapps is rebuilding by Instagne. So this growing into the value for stocknet with an important way. But the Dex liquidities are fragmented into the manipul and that causes not optimized swaps for users. And also current dexes are not serving easy UX for users.
00:17:48.470 - 00:18:46.350, Speaker F: Many of the using the copy design and also have poor experiences. So there is not any Dex aggregator combines the many pools for the best route. Also there is no single just one Dex not good enough for giving the best price for the users. So there is fibris finance. There is fibris finance. Fibris finance scans all pools in Starknet defi ecosystem to find the best routes for each trade. We have a special algorithm which makes recursive calculations to offer the best trading route and offers this route for the users so that users can easily interact with our UX and perform their trades in our app where all of the dexes of Starknet are combined.
00:18:46.350 - 00:19:42.340, Speaker F: You can check a special picture from our offered route. We have completed our first testnet phase in one month ago with two K users and 25k transactions and we were planning to open next Testnet with improved algorithm and improved UX with fixed bugs, but we decided to delay it for a few days due to the earthquake in Turkey and we have a project community in Starknet. Turkey and Starcrack holders will be able to perform their trades without fees in fibrous. There is no investment round for fibrous finance yet, but please, we are open to strategic investors integration and development partnerships, so please use our app in Testnet. Thank you.
00:19:48.390 - 00:19:52.370, Speaker C: All right, thank you so much. Up next we have Neptune.
00:19:58.550 - 00:21:02.860, Speaker B: Hi, I'm Alan, co founder of Neptune. A future proof, privacy preserving layer one cryptocurrencies have gone from to $1 trillion in less than 14 years, and certainly the market potential is far higher going forward. However, transparent ledgers are terrible for privacy. Existing layer one privacy solutions don't scale and layer two solutions inherit the security vulnerabilities of their base layers and you cannot fix quantum insecurity with an upgrade. At Neptune, we believe that ZK starks belong on layer one. It will give us scalable privacy and programmability as well as post quantum security. At Genesis, we already have a stark engine called Tritonvm as well as a compiler for it.
00:21:02.860 - 00:22:08.880, Speaker B: The next step is to build a recursive verifier and to integrate it into the blockchain client. We expect a launch in summer of this year between my co founder partner and me, we've authored influential scientific articles and tutorials on the topic of snarks and starks, and built a crypto vault that today secures more than $3 billion worth of crypto assets. We're following the template of bitcoin's launch and governance as closely as possible. The company behind Neptune will dissolve on December 31, 2025. The pre mine is less than 2%, and we are offering it to privacy minded individuals to raise funds. So ask yourself what the future global financial infrastructure needs to look like after quantum computers are activated, and what part in that transition you want to play. Welcome to Neptune's safe haven.
00:22:11.010 - 00:22:12.000, Speaker A: Thank you.
00:22:14.870 - 00:22:19.890, Speaker C: All right, thank you so much. Up next, I'd like to invite radius to the stage.
00:22:29.510 - 00:23:36.842, Speaker D: Hi, I'm AJ, co founder of Radius, the sequencing layer for roll ups on Ethereum. In DeFi, the TVL reached $55 billion and trading volume is over 2 trillion, which is still growing because it's transparent, public, and composable. But unfortunately, because these transactions are transparent, over 90% of Ethereum validators are extracting values from users through toxic trading strategies called mev. So within two years, users have lost almost $1 billion to meV. So Defi apps are working with the validators to minimize those harmful meV, such as front running and sandwich attack. But that's not enough because the power of ordering transactions still belongs to the centralized validators. So in order to mitigate this centralization, radius is replacing the sequencing role of validators for roll up.
00:23:36.842 - 00:25:05.990, Speaker D: So our sequencing layer ensures that user funds are protected from a bad meV. Based on our own ZK scheme and verifiable delay encryption, we will provide trustless sequencing to roll ups. The transactions are hidden while sequencing and their validity is proved by ZKP, our sequencing layer cannot manipulate them. Also, because variety of rollups share a single sequencer, we can provide optimistic and bridging across roll ups for maximization of cross roll up arbitrage. We will open this opportunity to traders or MEV searchers to make our own revenue. We just launched our Alpha version and in discussion to collaborate with roll up as a service and a DeFi projects to onboard them as our first roll ups interacting with our sequence layer. I was at Samsung Research for 13 years working on security and privacy research and ICTO is PhD in distributed system and then our CRO is running the biggest ZK research community in Korea.
00:25:05.990 - 00:25:17.500, Speaker D: We are looking for our investors. We are raising for precede round and looking for Defi projects and roll up service to deploy as f chain layer three on stocknet. Thank you.
00:25:18.350 - 00:25:22.350, Speaker C: All right, thank you. Up next, we have Carmine Finance.
00:25:31.170 - 00:26:18.270, Speaker G: Hi, I'm Marek. I'm a founder of Carmine Finance, a fully on chain insurance platform. The blockchain insurance is estimated to be 40 billion by 2030, with an annual growth rate of 70%. Traditional insurance companies are heavy on manual labor and have decades old processes for the end user. It makes it slow and costly. Companies like Pinkan, Axa alliance and so on have decades old processes that are heavy on manual labor. Often they don't even do claim assessment, especially for the low value claims and for the rest is done at least partially manually.
00:26:18.270 - 00:27:19.566, Speaker G: Carmine provides an insurance that is automated fully on chain at a fair pricing and fast. We are capital efficient. We provide fair pricing of the standardized risk through Carmine options Amm. We will allow for specific insurance events to be insured and we will have automated claim assessment process. So far we are testing our alpha first product, the Carmine options amm, and we've got over 300 users to give us qualitative feedback on the options amm. I worked as a lead for high frequency trading company both on and off crypto in chainkeepers and Quantlain. I worked as a CTO for a project called Equala.
00:27:19.566 - 00:27:43.100, Speaker G: My co founders David was a front end and DevOps engineer in Cessnam. Andre worked with me in chainkeepers as a quant and Andre was a smart contract freelance developer. So far we have raised two hundred and forty k and we are raising additional round and we are looking for investors. Thank you.
00:27:46.030 - 00:27:49.290, Speaker C: Thank you. Up next we have Beamer Bridge.
00:27:57.050 - 00:28:23.470, Speaker H: Hi, I'm Fred, CTO of Beamer Bridge. A roll up to roll up ERC 20 token bridge scaling Ethereum has been the elephant in the room ever since the Genesis block was mined. We have seen ease killers coming and going. Now we see users coming back, but not to l one. We see them coming back on rollups. Arbitrum, optimism, Starknet. They all agree on using Ethereum as their global settlement layer.
00:28:23.470 - 00:29:19.758, Speaker H: However, users are stuck inside of these silos. If they want to use their assets on another roll up, they have to either go back to Ethereum or use some sketchy bridge which requires to trust a centralized entity or unaudited code. And we all have seen how that went. Actually, lots of bridges are just custodial, multisix and on the other side we see good teams building two complex solutions which introduces the risk of unnoticed bugs in the code. That's why we decided to build Beamer, a simple and highly secure roll up to roll up only bridge. A bridge where users get an amazing ux with almost instant finality while being secured by Ethereum itself. Beamer is a market making protocol where liquidity providers bridge tokens immediately by leveraging optimistic design.
00:29:19.758 - 00:29:50.570, Speaker H: And in the event of a dispute. Beamer uses Ethereum for correct resolution. This is similar to how optimistic rollups work. We are live on Mainet. Since October last year and just two weeks ago, we have released our second version, bridging between arbitram and optimism. In the past two weeks, just Beamer facilitated over 9000 transfers and a total of 700,000 usd. This makes Beamer under the top ten most used apps on both rollups.
00:29:50.570 - 00:30:20.558, Speaker H: The team Brainbot Technologies, the team behind Beamer is a venture builder in the space. We've been deeply rooted in the Ethereum ecosystem since March 2014. This is even 18 months before Mainet launched. Last year, we raised our seed round. Bima raised a total of 2.65 million, and this year we will start our series a seeking for an investment of around eight to 10 million. There are no specific figures yet, but we are here to look for a lead investor for the upcoming round.
00:30:20.558 - 00:30:25.640, Speaker H: So if you're a potential candidate and want to know what's next fast, please reach out. Thank you so much.
00:30:28.970 - 00:30:31.670, Speaker C: All right. Up next, we have aura.
00:30:36.410 - 00:31:04.126, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Does this thing work? Cool. So my name is Adar. I do research and smart contract development for Aura protocol, which is a stablecoin system being developed by Lindy Labs. So let's talk a bit about stablecoins. Stablecoins are one of the killer use cases of crypto today. Companies use them for payments, people use them for payments.
00:31:04.126 - 00:32:24.940, Speaker A: It's really one of the things that actually has, like, I guess, a real world use case currently, and right now, the stablecoin market is largely composed of centralized stablecoins. So USDC, USDT. But we expect that over time, decentralized stablecoins will make up a larger and larger portion of the stablecoin market. So I'm sure many of you guys have heard of the blockchain trilemma, where blockchains have to make trade offs between decentralization, security, scalability and stablecoins similarly face a trilemma between decentralization, capital efficiency, and solvency. And just for reference, something like USDC completely throws decentralization out the window and instead optimizes for capital efficiency and in theory, solvency. Although solvency is harder to audit with centralized stablecoins, and something like liquidy optimizes for decentralization and solvency, but its capital efficiency suffers. So existing decentralized stablecoin solutions like liquidy and Maker have had to make various trade offs within this trade off space.
00:32:24.940 - 00:33:19.638, Speaker A: So, for example, maker sacrifices decentralization in favor of maintaining a tighter peg and liquidy has a looser peg, but it goes all in on decentralization, and both of them are less capital efficient than they could be in varying ways. So I'll get into what that means in a sec. So, for example, maker has a very sole liquidation mechanism, and it also uses USDC in order to maintain its peg. Right now, a third of all DAI is actually backed by centralized stablecoins. Not that great if you want to be decentralized and liquidy. While it has faster liquidations, it only has eth as collateral and it only has eth as collateral and it has a looser peg. So let's look at aura.
00:33:19.638 - 00:34:04.300, Speaker A: Aura is a censorship resistant stablecoin system that takes advantage of the cheap computation made available by starknet in order to achieve higher capital efficiency while also maintaining the peg and providing a nicer borrowing experience for users. Some of Aura's flagship features are adaptive interest rate controller for stabilizing the price of the stablecoin dynamic liquidation parameters, a multilayered liquidation system and cross collateral borrowing. And that's more or less it. We're raising, we have audits scheduled for q two and we're aiming to launch shortly after. So come chat with us. Thanks.
00:34:08.130 - 00:34:16.880, Speaker C: All right, thank you so much. Up next, I'd like to invite Starknet ID. Come on up.
00:34:28.670 - 00:35:09.094, Speaker A: Yes, thanks. Hello everyone, happy to be here. So I'm here to present Stacknet ID. So what we do first, I'm going to present a bit the market. So right now on chain identity is a plus 20 billion market. You might not know it, but to me right now, this is one of the biggest product markers fitting crypto, because identity is all about PFP first, but also Ens names and names in general with the domains with unstoppable domains, ens, et cetera, et cetera. So the two main product market fit that we saw in crypto for identities is pfps and username right now.
00:35:09.094 - 00:36:11.546, Speaker A: So it's still a pretty big market even in bear market. So right now, the problem is that there is no real on chain identity because web free identity is captured on different chains and different apps. So especially when you want to build on stocknet, you have to rebuild all the identity infrastructure, query 18 different APIs, nt different contracts in order to retrieve all the data that you need as a protocol, as a game builder, et cetera, et cetera. So a user will have to add their username again, add their profile peak again, add the twitter again to your protocol, add the koisi again, et cetera, et cetera. And this is not at all what we want to do in web free, because by definition, web free is something with interoperability. So this is the problem that we aim to solve with stacknet iD. So our solution is stacknet id empowers the user to create an unchained passport that unifies all the fragmented data representing your unchained id.
00:36:11.546 - 00:36:42.450, Speaker A: And we specialize for the moment on stocknet. So that's the solution. And this is like a drawing to show you how it works. So basically you're going to create a small passport, which is an NFT. And on this NFT, you'll be able to write different data, so you'll be able to write your stock name, which ends with stock your ens soon. We announced it yesterday, your social media, et cetera, et cetera. Proof of humanity, kyC.
00:36:42.450 - 00:37:13.550, Speaker A: We can add a lot of things, pfps, et cetera, et cetera. We can add a lot of things. And this is basically what we do right now when it comes to the tractions. Right now, we have 64,000 identities created on the main net. We launched one month and a half ago, and we have 29,000 domains and ten integrations live. The team, it's me and my co founder Thomas. We are basically stacknet native guys.
00:37:13.550 - 00:37:25.460, Speaker A: I sold the web two company. He's an Oli Cairo dev since more than one year right now. And my ask basically, is just to connect with builders right now that are building in the identity space. Thank you.
00:37:29.130 - 00:37:32.070, Speaker C: All right, up next, we have Sphinx.
00:37:41.650 - 00:38:17.574, Speaker B: Everyone. So, I'm park, I'm one of the co founders of Sphinx, and we're on chain order book building on Starknet. So crypto trading today is a $45 billion market, but actually 90% of that still happens on centralized exchanges. And the Dex market share is definitely growing. So actually grew ten times over the last two years. But the problem is the Dex infrastructure is still not ready today. So existing solutions like Amms suffer from impermanent loss and capital inefficiency.
00:38:17.574 - 00:38:55.606, Speaker B: And you have off chain order books which are not composable or censorship resistant. There are other onchain order books, but because they're restricted to a single blockchain, they're actually less convenient and more liquid compared to centralized alternatives. So our solution is Sphinx. We're building a natively cross chain order book, Dex, which is designed to compete with sexys both on convenience and execution. And by building on Starknet, we're leveraging two features. So one is massive scalability, and then the other is trustless cross chain bridging using something called storage proofs. So, just to explain a bit more how that works.
00:38:55.606 - 00:39:50.826, Speaker B: So basically we allow users to trade remotely on our protocol from other chains like Ethereum, using nothing more than their native metamask wallet. So this is done using a combination of typed EIP 712 messages as well as bridging via kind of storage proof. So basically we do a storage proof to bridge to Starknet and then a snark proof wrapper to bridge back. So as a fully on chain order book, we're designed to compose with amms and other DeFi applications. So this allows us to share liquidity and also revenues. So last year, after winning two hackathons and also launching MVP on Testnet, we basically started early conversations with market makers and other DeFi applications, building in the space to discuss integrations. And basically our team formed after ECC hackathon last year.
00:39:50.826 - 00:40:28.290, Speaker B: So myself, I'm a financial analyst turned software engineer. I most recently worked in crypto VC at Fabric Ventures and also at Google. And I'm also a lead delegate at Makerdao and Ave. And my co founder Remy, is a web3 founder fellow at South Park Commons. Previously he co founded a protocol called Parallel Finance, and he was also a software engineer at Google and Microsoft. And just quickly finishing off here, we're looking to connect with investors interested in our protocol, as well as market makers and other Defi projects building on Starknet. And you can check us out at sphinxdex on Twitter.
00:40:28.290 - 00:40:30.520, Speaker B: So, sphinxdex, thank you.
00:40:32.970 - 00:40:37.800, Speaker C: All right. And for our last presentation, we'd like to invite Converse up.
00:40:40.910 - 00:40:59.870, Speaker A: Thank you very much. Hey, everyone, how are you? Raise your hand if you're good. Okay, you're good. I'm the last one. I'm trying to put good energy here. I'm Paul. I'm co founder of Converse, which is a web3 messaging app based on the XMTP protocol.
00:40:59.870 - 00:41:38.422, Speaker A: Today, web two applications drive billions of users on their app every day, and they capture their attention. Yet none of these apps let you own your conversations. It means that they can block you for no reason. They can prevent you from using the client of your choice, and or most of them can actually read all of your messages. There are web3 attempts that tried to actually fix this, but they didn't really succeed yet. First, they are all siloed, so they are trying to win alone rather than doing it altogether against the big ones. Second, they are focusing on wallet to wallet communication.
00:41:38.422 - 00:42:22.730, Speaker A: So Azerox talks to a zero x and they are not really taking fully advantage of the web3 identities that emerged over the last few years. So we are building converse, which is the first identity to identity web3, messaging app based on the XMTP protocol. So the UX is as simple and efficient as the web. Two apps that you already know. And we are taking advantage of the power of web3, interoperability. So, on one side, you can access all of the conversations that you already had on the XMTP network, such as lens apps or wallet roulette. And on the other side, you can reach out to any ens handle, lens handle, or even pfps.
00:42:22.730 - 00:43:01.926, Speaker A: So, within one month, we manually embodied more than 100 beta testers. The active users use the app five to six times every single day. And we are in close relationships with the XMTP team in order to build the best client for their protocol. We are two people in the team, myself and Noe. We've been former cpu and CTO of startups. We met each other twelve years ago at one of the top engineering schools in France. And we built experiments before converse, such as pixels, first on chain art, experiment on Stocknet, Starkey token gating app on Stocknet as well.
00:43:01.926 - 00:43:14.300, Speaker A: And wallet roulette, which was one of the first experiments on top of the XMTV protocol. We are going to raise a seed round in the next two months. So if you're interested in participating, ping me at polygategetconvert app.
00:43:19.310 - 00:43:25.870, Speaker C: All right, thank you so much, and thank you for all of our presenters today. I think I'd like to pass it off to gal.
00:43:31.650 - 00:43:55.102, Speaker A: Let's wrap it up. Thank you, everyone, for enters and for everyone who attended this event. Here's again the QR code that you can scan and fill a form. And through this form, we'd help you connect with the presenters. And you're welcome to hang out outside. Every team, every presenting team has a table with a little sign that says its name on it. So, teams, you're welcome to hang out around your table.
00:43:55.102 - 00:43:58.200, Speaker A: And, yeah, thank you for coming.
