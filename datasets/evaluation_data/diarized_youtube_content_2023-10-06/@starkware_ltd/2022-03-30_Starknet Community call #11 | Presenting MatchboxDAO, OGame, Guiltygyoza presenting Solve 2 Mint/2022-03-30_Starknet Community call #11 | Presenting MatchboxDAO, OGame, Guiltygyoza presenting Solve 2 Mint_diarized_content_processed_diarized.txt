00:00:00.090 - 00:00:01.310, Speaker A: YouTube stream.
00:00:01.810 - 00:00:03.120, Speaker B: Yeah, we're ready.
00:00:03.490 - 00:00:24.998, Speaker A: Let's go then. Lock and load. We're live. Cool. So, hi, everyone. If you're on Discord, I'm going to post in the community call channel the link to the YouTube live. And you'll be able to see the screen of our.
00:00:24.998 - 00:00:46.600, Speaker A: Our presenters for today's posted. All right.
00:00:51.090 - 00:00:53.070, Speaker B: Alessandro, can you mute?
00:00:55.250 - 00:01:20.040, Speaker A: So. Right, so, okay, guys, you are presenting your screen on YouTube. You're not on discord yet. That I can see. So it would be great if you can activate your voice on discord so that people who are on Discord can hear you. People who are on Discord. If you want to see the screen of our presenters today, I invite you to follow the YouTube link I just posted in the community call.
00:01:21.370 - 00:01:29.838, Speaker C: Henry, if I'm joining Discord at the same time, I'm hearing you twice. How can we do so? We'll not hear twice.
00:01:29.954 - 00:01:33.734, Speaker A: There's no good solution for that. There's a bit of an echo.
00:01:33.862 - 00:01:45.450, Speaker B: You can actually mute Henry on discord by right clicking his name. And Henry, I'm on Discord, but you would have to make me a speaker on vstage.
00:01:46.770 - 00:01:50.986, Speaker A: Are you there? So invite to speak. Who else should I invite to speak in Discord?
00:01:51.178 - 00:01:56.482, Speaker B: Jonathan and eventually Alessandro. And then guilty also when he's here.
00:01:56.616 - 00:02:15.080, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm going to invite everyone to speak. And you can mute your mic and then take the floor when you feel like it. Okay, so I invited guilty user. Invited to guilty user. Who else should I invite? Alex, inside.
00:02:15.930 - 00:02:24.490, Speaker B: Alessandro, you. It would be cool if you could connect on discord as well in the starknet discord and join the community call stage.
00:02:25.230 - 00:03:04.214, Speaker A: Okay, cool. All right, so I guess we are ready to start. I'll add Alexandro once you get there. Okay. Hello, everyone, and welcome for our 11th community call. As usual, you can follow Discord in this call in voice only on discord. Or if you want to see our faces and the screen of our presenters today I invite you to join the YouTube link that I just posted on the community call channel.
00:03:04.214 - 00:03:34.782, Speaker A: You'll get everything voice. You'll get voice and image and everything. So worth clicking there. And today, for our community call, we're going to have free presentations by our members. And we can follow up with a short AMA, if useful, on Starknet generally. Today we'll have Matchboxdao presenting what they're doing, what their mission is. Then we will have Alex presenting ogame.
00:03:34.782 - 00:03:46.210, Speaker A: And finally we will have guilty Gioza presenting solve to mint. So, yeah, without further ado, Matchbox the floor is yours.
00:03:46.790 - 00:03:58.220, Speaker B: All right, thank you very much. I think before we begin presenting Matchbox, it might be a good idea to dive into our backgrounds a bit. And Yoni, can you maybe introduce yourself?
00:03:59.230 - 00:04:30.690, Speaker C: Everyone, I'm Yoni. I'm in crypto for almost ten years, mainly building stuff. Previously built a privacy coin and NFT museum and investment Dao and other things. And the last couple of months I've been obsessed with on chain games. And now? Now Matchbox.
00:04:31.830 - 00:05:15.718, Speaker B: All right, my name is Fractimus. I've been a vocal member of the Ethereum community basically since 2017 when ico surfing. Then I briefly lost interest, but came back when my interest was rekindled in 2019 when DFI basically came to be and maker Dow went live with Dai. And ever since I've been just deep diving into Ethereum and scalability and then quickly found my way to rollups, which was super exciting. And now I ended up with Starknet. And I've written some blog posts for Starknet. I'm doing some community management on Reddit, and I'm also running a weekly starnet newsletter, which I can very much recommend if you want to keep up with everything that's going on on starnet.
00:05:15.718 - 00:06:10.558, Speaker B: And then I got basically brought into Matchboxdao by uni, who was very convincing about this vision for on chain games, and that's what we're going to dive into today. So what is Matchboxdao? In very simple terms, Matchboxdao is a collective of developers, artists and designers building the infrastructure of on chain games on Starknet. And so it's important to distinguish between on chain games and blockchain games, because blockchain games are not necessarily on chain games. So it depends. So if we think about an onchain game, then the source of truth for game data should be the blockchain, right? So it shouldn't be like some kind of server that's sitting somewhere off chain and which does all the computation. And then you just post the results back to the chain because that's not immutable and that's not trustless. Then the next thing is that the game logic and the rules are implemented via a smart contract.
00:06:10.558 - 00:07:03.182, Speaker B: So the actual game and all the game logic is on chain and all the computation happens on chain. The game should also be developed in accordance with open ecosystem principles, which means that you should basically open source as much as possible and don't use closed source things. And the next point is that the game should embrace real world value digital assets. So it means basically that you have some kind of token or tokenized assets and it should be like crypto native. So you don't pay for things with like USD or something like that, but you embrace crypto values. And so we've based this on the strongest crypto gaming thesis by Gupsheep, which is an amazing article, and I recommend you check it out and read it. And so why are we so excited about onchain games? Because it has very distinct advantages.
00:07:03.182 - 00:07:53.202, Speaker B: The biggest advantages is composability, which I will dive into in a minute, but also persistence, which means even if the game developer and game operator disappears, then everything is on chain and is still persisting. So it should still work. That's a big advantage over traditional games, because if in traditional games they shut down the server or something, then you're left with a game that doesn't work anymore, right. Then the next thing is trustlessness. Thanks to Starknet, we can actually implement the game logic on chain in a trustless manner. So we do not anymore have to trust the game developer, but we can rest assured that the execution of the on chain logic is immutable and trustless because it's all on chain. And so this is where our motivation for Matchbox Dow is basically coming from.
00:07:53.202 - 00:08:59.634, Speaker B: So Starknet isn't just fast and cheap, which is of course great, but Starknet actually allows us to do things that were previously impossible on any other blockchain. So on any other blockchain, on Ethereum, l one, on avalanche or Salana, you cannot actually put complex game logic on chain because the computation would just be too complex and too expensive. But on Starkland we can do it. And so that's a very unique situation we're in. And a great opportunity because this is a prerequisite for composability, right? Because previously it just wasn't possible to do this on chain. But now that it's possible to actually put all the game logic on chain, we can harness the full power of composability, right? Because every game that will be on Starknet, ideally, of course, will be completely on chain. So what does this mean? We can compare this to defi and defi Lego blocks, right? So you have certain primitives in Defi, for example stablecoins or amms, and they are like the foundation of DFI, like Uniswap or other amms.
00:08:59.634 - 00:09:24.826, Speaker B: They have been forked like ten thousands of times. They're on different chains. They can be used for options trading, for leverage trading. You can add so much functionality to them and just put these Lego blocks together and you get so much power out of this. And that's just the power of composability. And so how does this relate to on chain games? We believe that the exact same thing is going to happen to on chain games. On chain games will benefit immensely from composability.
00:09:24.826 - 00:10:48.170, Speaker B: Once we can actually put everything on chain, then you can think of an on chain game no longer as just a game, but actually as like a development platform for developers, right? Because you can use these smart contracts, you can reuse them, you can fork them, you can add functionality, you can stack these lego blocks on top of each other and develop new and cool stuff. And so that's a really powerful narrative. And we are convinced that this is going to happen to on chain gaming. So why matchboxdao? We are trying to act as a focal point for game developers on Starknet because Starknet is still like a nascent ecosystem. So we are trying to bring the devs together so we can better cooperate and better standardize things. And why do we want to standardize gaming related things? It's actually very straightforward because if someday we will have hundreds of onchain games on Starknet and we have like 20 different NFT standards, then that's not very composable, right? So we want to kind of get things right and collaborate on different standards, which could be NFT, interoperability standards, token standards, social graphs, wallet ux, various other protocols, for example. How do you present achievements in games and stuff like that? So we're trying to come together and standardize things so we can harness the full power of composability.
00:10:48.170 - 00:11:47.822, Speaker B: So how does matchbox operate? We have like this general high level operations team, which consists of Uniton of me, of Durket, of magic and Jove, where we just organize the high level stuff of matchboxdao. And then we have people that we call core contributors, and they consist of developers and of people that are more into the content and coordination side of things. So for the developer side of things, we have grantees, which we will dive into a bit later. And we have basically just coiders from existing projects, right? So we have people from BRIC, we have people from influence, from Yagify, Bitmapbox, Rams, C casino. We have the guy that built the memo's pool on Zigzag. We have Terrence from dopwars, and just many, many more people that we can't list right now, all of them. And they're just coming together to ideate on things, to discuss things, to figure out how do we build this stuff the correct way? And then on the other side we have content and coordination people.
00:11:47.822 - 00:12:12.200, Speaker B: So we have people that host workshops, we have a weekly developer call, we have people that write blog posts, Twitter threads, because we of course have to somehow get the message out about this new narrative about on chain gaming and the power of composability. And now Yuni can dive a bit into our accelerator model and how we actually structure this, everyone.
00:12:13.690 - 00:13:43.220, Speaker C: So basically the way we are doing it is that very similar to how in a regular accelerator you have in one side like mentors and in the other side participants with Matchbox, the mentors are the core contributors. So those are established game developers that have a better sense of how the future looks like. And they just lack in time because they have so many ideas and they are willing to mentor new people in helping building this future, but they don't have enough time. So on the other side you have a lot of people that are interested in building in general applications, but mainly games on Starknet and they don't actually know what to build. So we created a program that we call the Matchbox Fellowship. And in this program we are helping people from not knowing what they want to do or being just in the beginning into building a proof of concept. And basically the way we are doing it is that we either get people to propose their idea or build out of list of open ideas that we have, or join to one of our existing working groups and product that we're already building and partner with someone that is already starting building something.
00:13:43.220 - 00:15:32.120, Speaker C: Can you move one and. Okay, so this is some examples for things that we are currently working on, which also guilty and Alex will introduce after this presentation. So just some examples are procedural word generation, which is on chain Minecraft, but basically this Minecraft can be used as an application and can be used as a component. So everything that we are building we are releasing as an application first to be used from day one, but also it's a component so others can use this thing in order to spin out their game very quickly. So basically what we see is as we go forward, we're building more and more and more of those games and primitives that basically every new developer that are coming, it's easier for him to create his own game because he's taking like one of our primitives or two of our primitives and tweak it and create something out of that. So that is kind of our eventual goal that in the future when a new developer will come to Matchbox, he will be able to create something within a week where now it takes like some few months because we need to build the first building blocks and infrastructure. Is there any other? Okay, that's our gun program that I've spoke about.
00:15:32.120 - 00:16:39.158, Speaker C: If you can move another one. Okay, so besides building products, another thing that we are doing that we found useful for our members is weekly workshops. So every week we are doing one workshop that basically introduce a library or introduce a tool that can help our members and basically educate them regarding how to build things using those tools. So until now, we had like three of those workshops. And the next workshop will be with Francesco about the react library that he built. And another workshop will be about a specific primitive that we built. And we want people to use it in order to build potentially a game out of which is called mental poker or it's basically a primitive that can generate a deck of cards.
00:16:39.158 - 00:17:32.160, Speaker C: So that's the next two workshops. But feel free to follow our next workshops every week. That's about the workshops. Okay, so basically our plans for the future is build more stuff. So if you are talented developers and you don't know what to build on Starquare, feel free to reach out and we can walk you through all of the things that you could build and help you to understand what can be built and give you some ideas and potentially get you into our fellowship program to start building it. So that's kind of our main goal, to expand the primitives that we are building, hopefully into 100. Right now it's ten.
00:17:32.160 - 00:18:29.774, Speaker C: Another thing that we hope to expand is our suite of services. And basically our goal is to serve developers. So we are listening into the developers needs and if we'll find more things that could be helpful, we would do it. The last but not least is to create. So one of those things is to create a player base. So what we understood is that to be a guild in onchain games is not to be a guild in traditional games, because the players that are using on chain games are much smart, not necessarily much smarter, but much more kind of sophisticated players. And another thing that we feel that will be very helpful for our members is create a user base for them.
00:18:29.774 - 00:19:03.260, Speaker C: So that's what we are going to use the solve to min for, basically to create an initial user base that will get different incentives and access to different things. And with time, we'll have a growing community of beta testers, which are users that want to be the first users of those blockchain games. So yeah, I'll let guilty Geosa expand on the soft to mint but yeah, that's basically it.
00:19:11.390 - 00:19:22.480, Speaker A: Okay, thank you, Yoni. So do you want to move forward with the presentation of Alessandro or are you.
00:19:24.470 - 00:19:27.150, Speaker C: Finished? Yeah, I'm finished.
00:19:27.310 - 00:19:40.674, Speaker A: Wonderful. So thank you for that great introduction. It's really interesting and very ambitious. And so Alessandro will present one of the first projects that is incubated by Matchbox. Is that it? Wonderful.
00:19:40.802 - 00:20:22.020, Speaker D: Hello everyone. Yeah, what I'm presenting today is O game, which it was very popular online browser game in the early 2000. It's a space team multiplayer where player can build structures to accumulate resources and build ships to make trades and attack other player to steal their resources. The game had a very big community around it in the 2000 and.
00:20:23.830 - 00:20:24.194, Speaker C: Used.
00:20:24.232 - 00:21:31.450, Speaker D: To bring a lot of people together. And what happened after is that the company who runs it started to add pay to progress options, which in a sense they ruined the game a little bit and now is not really popular anymore. So my idea is to bring the good things about the game together with the good things about onchain gaming. In this case, it would be the planets which constitute the base of the game will be nfts. And then the resources which are main three kind of resources will be ERC 20s token. And possibly in the future there will be also integration of ERC 1155 tokens. So what I'm trying to do is bring in together few standards and also bring proprietor make the player be owners of the time they spent on the game developing their own assets.
00:21:31.450 - 00:21:34.780, Speaker D: So yeah, this is the idea.
00:21:44.290 - 00:21:59.090, Speaker A: Okay, thank you for this presentation. That was fast. Do you have an estimate for when this will be released or usable?
00:21:59.670 - 00:22:12.470, Speaker D: Yeah, the back end of the first version is almost ready and we are now working with Matchbox at the front end. Super cool, possibly in a month time.
00:22:12.540 - 00:22:38.910, Speaker A: It would be very nice, if I may know. We often talk about the capacity of Starknet to do more than just hosting assets on Starknet. I don't know if while designing an o game this is something you were able to play with for now. Did you put mostly the market logics in the backend or did you implement some kind of physics?
00:22:41.250 - 00:23:15.306, Speaker D: So at the moment in the back end, is the gain logic implemented? The market side will be implemented by other people. The ERC 20 order book will be implemented by someone from Meshbox, which is Mortimer and Francesco. I know Francesco is working on an NFT primitive to allow smart contract for exchange of nfts to be integrated in the game.
00:23:15.488 - 00:23:19.180, Speaker E: So those are also very cool.
00:23:20.830 - 00:23:33.630, Speaker A: It sounds like you have a lot of people from different background and different time zones to work together. Is this a challenge in your developing process and in the experience of creating ogame?
00:23:34.290 - 00:23:47.720, Speaker D: I will probably know in a month time when the first version logic will be ready and I will start to integrate all these parts from outside. And I will probably let you know after that.
00:23:48.490 - 00:23:54.600, Speaker A: Okay, cool. So when you do launch, don't hesitate and come back on the community call to tell us more about.
00:23:55.450 - 00:23:56.422, Speaker D: Course, of course.
00:23:56.476 - 00:23:57.080, Speaker E: Sure.
00:23:57.950 - 00:24:22.770, Speaker A: Cool. Thank you. And so following Alessandro, we have guilty Gioza presenting solve to mint. Very nice. Thank you. Swag. So we can see Swag's screen.
00:24:24.580 - 00:24:26.400, Speaker E: Can you hear my voice?
00:24:26.820 - 00:24:32.052, Speaker A: I can hear your voice. I can't hear it on discord though, right?
00:24:32.106 - 00:24:34.884, Speaker E: Do you want me to unmute on discord as well?
00:24:35.002 - 00:24:38.490, Speaker A: If you could, that would be ideal, so that people there can also follow.
00:24:51.340 - 00:24:52.330, Speaker E: I see.
00:24:56.140 - 00:24:58.952, Speaker A: Hello, we can hear you now.
00:24:59.086 - 00:26:11.104, Speaker E: Great. So, softimid at topology, we believe that we are all building alternative realities additional to this world that we live in. And we believe that the richness and complexity of these realities is determined by the sophistication of the physics that is underlying these realities. And so, topology is building physics simulation and physics engine in Cairo. And one of the first proof of concept for this endeavor at topology is the soft to mint concept, which Matchboxdao is collaborating with us to productize it and to get more awareness on the interestingness of this framework. And to talk a little bit about soft to mint framework, we can take a look at the prominent NFT auction model. When it comes to NFT auctions, or in general, how nfts are distributed to people, there is roughly two features.
00:26:11.104 - 00:27:15.252, Speaker E: The first one is there is sort of an artificial scarcity defined by the NFT project developers ten k 8888. These rather artificial figures. So that's the first property. The second property would be you are asking people to commit capital in order to acquire an NFT from you. And in that sense, you are filtering people with the amount of capital that they feel comfortable or they would like to commit to the project. And in that sense, you're also filtering out and rejecting people that might not be able to afford the NFT or the auction, but they have knowledge and they have enthusiasm for your project. So softement is a concept that said, let's use knowledge to filter people, not the amount of capital that they are willing to contribute.
00:27:15.252 - 00:28:15.950, Speaker E: Soft to mint is essentially solving a puzzle to mint an NFT. And this puzzle is verified on Starknet in Cairo. So there is no middleman. The criterion for a solution to a puzzle to be accepted is transparent in Cairo contract. Now the soft to mint, and also coming back to the first property, which is most NFT projects have a relatively artificial scarcity defined by the project developer. With the softer mint, there isn't necessarily a scarcity that's known apriori, which means we as developers and launchers of the softer mint projects don't necessarily know how scarce or how abundant the solution space is. And if we give one NFT to one solution, then scarcity of the NFT is determined by the size of the solution space.
00:28:15.950 - 00:28:57.288, Speaker E: This may be a little bit abstract, so let's go into an example. As a simplest example, you look at soft to mint and look at class c. Class C is the weakest class of softer mint. So example, we can put a polynomial equation in the smart contract and we ask people to submit solution to that equation. This is relatively simple. Anyone reading the Cairo contract can extract the equation and solve it very quickly, or plug it into Wallframe online and get the solutions very quickly. But the field is a demonstration of the system.
00:28:57.288 - 00:29:58.750, Speaker E: Now, going to class b, which has moderate difficulty, you would have a problem, a numerical problem, that there's no closed form solution to it, so you don't solve it easily. You have to run, for example, numerical simulation, or you have to rely on your heuristics in order to find solution. In a sense, this can be said as MP problem. And this is interesting, because now you have a numerical puzzle enforced by a transparent Cairo contract sitting on Starknet, and you're inviting anyone who may have a solution to submit the solution to the contract and get verified, and then get an NFT in return. Now we can also enforce that only the discoverer of new solution can get an NFT. So if a solution is found, you don't get to rediscover it. It's already found.
00:29:58.750 - 00:31:08.132, Speaker E: The protocol here would incentivize people to find new solution and to find other corners of the solution space that is not explored yet by the previous participant. So this is class b. Well, class a is perhaps the strongest of the softening concept, and this also requires some technical capacity, and starknet is a wonderful playground for implementing this. So what class a is that? As participant, you're not asked to submit numbers or just a solution to the puzzle. You're asked to submit a Cairo contract that can solve the puzzle for you. And the verifier contract on Starknet will interact with your solution contract and essentially test with random problems whether your solution contract can solve them all. Now this is a very complex system, so we are starting with class B as of now.
00:31:08.132 - 00:31:43.324, Speaker E: So class b coming back and review it. It's a numerical problem that's verifiable on Starknet in the Cairo contract. And everyone is welcome and incentivized to submit new solutions to the contract. And I think that matchboxdao is going to release the first Softman concepts in a week of time. That is what I believe to be so swag. Yoni, feel free to correct me. And I won't say too much about the puzzle because it's meant to be a puzzle.
00:31:43.324 - 00:32:48.230, Speaker E: However, the puzzle is using the physics engine that topology has built in Cairo. So it's a numerical physics puzzle. So as a participant, you roughly have a couple choices. You can guess solutions randomly, you can go to the website and put in random numbers and hope that it's six, or you can dig into the Cairo contract, which is completely the spirit here, asking you to dig into the Cairo contract and learning a Cairo while solving the puzzle, and to learn about the nature of the physics puzzle that is enforced by the contract and come back to the website. Or if you like to go raw, you can go to Voyager and submit your solutions there as well and find new solutions. And perhaps the third approach is for people that have some programming background. You can run some physics simulation locally to help you solve the puzzle better.
00:32:48.230 - 00:32:57.460, Speaker E: I will only say so much, it's a physics puzzle. And feel free to dig into the contract to learn the true nature of the puzzle.
00:33:05.900 - 00:33:42.400, Speaker C: I can just add the matchbox context to that puzzle. So basically, we are going to release this puzzle in order to attract solvers that will get special access inside of Matchbox and will be future participants in the creation of other puzzles and also be the first one to use other games that we will release. So, yeah, I highly recommend trying to solve the puzzle.
00:33:43.080 - 00:33:44.112, Speaker A: Thank you, Yoni.
00:33:44.176 - 00:34:47.892, Speaker E: I think I can add a little bit color to what Yoni said at least. There are two ways to apply this concept. The first is to apply this concept for Dow admission, and the second way is for general Cairo education. So in terms of Dow admission, of course you can ask people to invest in your Dow token, but again, you're gating people on their willingness to contribute capital. So the alternative here is to use some kind of self amendment concept where you have puzzles representing the nature of the Dow, and you ask people that can submit solutions that's verified by the contract to have a chance of entering the Dow. And so you have a way to gauge people's knowledge and evaluate your prospective members that way. Well, in terms of education, because softtime system requires you to study the Cairo contract.
00:34:47.892 - 00:34:56.540, Speaker E: So you're having fun while learning Cairo at the same time. So it's going to be something that serves multiple purposes.
00:34:58.880 - 00:35:10.690, Speaker A: Thank you. How comfortable should people doing the solve to mint challenge be with physics, like in general?
00:35:11.300 - 00:35:59.260, Speaker E: Right. Well, in the upcoming soft to mint puzzle, it's very rudimentary physics. You can say that you don't even need to know precisely how numerical physics work. It will be ideal if you study the chiral contract and learn just the nature of the puzzle and you can visualize it on paper. And you can already, I believe you will have heuristics, you will have a sense of how to solve the puzzle without ever running any equation solvers or programs. So I think that the first puzle is fairly simple. If you can learn the nature of it and if you can visualize it yourself, you'll be able to find good enough solutions.
00:35:59.260 - 00:36:02.080, Speaker E: Probably not the best solutions, but good enough solutions.
00:36:03.860 - 00:36:18.730, Speaker A: Okay, very cool. Thank you. So from what you said, the soft dominance challenge will be released around the end of this week, right? Will you guys also be presenting this at the encode Akaton in two days?
00:36:22.060 - 00:36:22.810, Speaker C: Yes.
00:36:24.060 - 00:36:35.084, Speaker A: Very nice. And the challenge will be running for an indefinite period of time, right. So people will be able to compete and play for a long time.
00:36:35.282 - 00:36:36.910, Speaker C: Yeah, but we have.
00:36:37.280 - 00:36:39.400, Speaker A: We can't hear you on discord, yoni.
00:36:39.560 - 00:37:13.450, Speaker C: Oh, sorry. 1 second. I will unmute myself. So, yes, it will be indefinite period of time, but we'll have basically a special NFT for the first solvers. I think it's the first 20 solvers or the best 20 solvers. I need to check out the announcement post. So there will be a special NFT for the best solvers, but in principle it will be for a longer period of time for people to try out.
00:37:14.300 - 00:37:21.180, Speaker A: And let's say I know somebody who knows the sequencer of Starknet. Is there any way he can cheat?
00:37:22.480 - 00:37:23.500, Speaker C: Guilty.
00:37:27.840 - 00:37:31.036, Speaker E: Sorry, can I get the question again?
00:37:31.218 - 00:38:21.980, Speaker A: Sure. It was a joke, basically. No, I mean, it's a joke, but it's half a joke. My joke was, if I'm the sequencer of Starknet, can I manipulate that in any way? Implying that I'd be trying to win by cheating, but I don't need that. But more globally, my question is, this seems like a concept where we'll discover a whole new avenue of MeV. I mean, gaming on the blockchain is great, but being able to have gameplay on the blockchain and it opens up a lot of perspective. I was wondering if it's something you're considering, if you think there are interesting sports around that or not necessarily.
00:38:22.400 - 00:39:19.020, Speaker E: Right. So this is a fantastic question. Well, I think in the short term we ask Starquare to not cheat, but over long term we need to really look into how MeV works when it comes to the context of on chain games. Well, so going into a little bit detail here, as a sequencer, theoretically, you know what transactions are submitted and you can execute it. And so if you find a solution, a transaction that includes a solution, and as a sequencer, if you know that that solution is a wonderful one, you can front run it. This is the first order response to this. So I think there will be a roster of very weird bribing mechanics, incentive mechanics to either ask cheater to not do this or bribe cheater to share some profits with the solution summit.
00:39:19.020 - 00:39:23.010, Speaker E: But it's going to be a very weird future that's waiting for us.
00:39:25.060 - 00:39:51.740, Speaker A: Maybe this is also the way we'll finally get privacy preserving techniques on the blockchain whales. Maybe don't care that much about privacy. I mean, not a lot of them, but pro gamers for sure do. Nobody wants to get frontrun when you are solving a hard challenge or when you're about to complete a quest. So maybe gaming will be the way we democratize and develop interesting privacy techniques.
00:39:53.600 - 00:40:05.040, Speaker E: Fantastic. I do see that it will be very important to implement some privacy mechanics that works together with the software mint concept.
00:40:08.820 - 00:40:35.108, Speaker A: Great. Thank you. So from what I understand from solve to mint, so you will release class a and class b. So class a will be more accessible. People will be able to either solve this with a traditional math problem. So wall frame or something. What kind of tool should we get familiar with? For example, it's been a long time since I haven't used the mathematical software.
00:40:35.108 - 00:40:41.290, Speaker A: Last time I used something was Matlab a long time ago. Should I install it again? How do I get set up with.
00:40:47.690 - 00:41:44.410, Speaker E: Yoni and Swag can? Correct me if I'm wrong. I think the subtle puzzle that will be released very soon is a class b system. I think it may be desirable for us to release a class C sort of as a tutorial introducing people to class b. But I believe that the one that's upcoming is a class b directly. And I think that personally, I think that as a hint, the physics here is very intuitive when you understand what is really going on in the contract. So the only thing that you as a aspiring NFT mentor need to do is to study the Cairo contract which will be released as public GitHub repository. Together with the puzzle, that's the only thing you need to know once you understand what is really going on.
00:41:44.410 - 00:41:51.740, Speaker E: It's a very intuitive puzzle. You can solve it by visualizing yourself, and on paper you can find solutions. That's what I believe.
00:41:54.110 - 00:42:38.602, Speaker A: Very nice. Thank you. An extra question there. Maybe it's more of a programming question, maybe it's a bit fuzzy, but let me try to explain it. In the solve to mint challenge, you basically have all players playing against a machine, right? Against the same equation. There's a physics puzzle that we need to solve, but I'm guessing it means that each person has its own relationship with the physics itself. But various players are not aware of each other and can't interact with each other.
00:42:38.602 - 00:42:59.700, Speaker A: However, theoretically you could use the same physics engine to have different players be part of the game and have player versus player. But it raises a whole lot of question as to how do you represent the state of the game and move it forward. I was wondering if you had some insight on that. Does my question make sense?
00:43:00.150 - 00:43:47.390, Speaker E: I think so, yeah. So the concept here as of now is restricted to single player experience. It's only you against the puzzle. And the puzzle is transparent. It's literally you against a threshold in knowledge you have to cross in order to solve it. When it comes to player versus player mechanics, and also about running more complex physics, there are some constraints that come to this. For example, if you want to run more complex physics, and this is meant to be for Cairo developers in the audience, you will run into the resource constraint per transaction on Starknet.
00:43:47.390 - 00:44:45.022, Speaker E: And this would go back to another project in the matchbox style roster or portfolio project, which is Yagi Finance. Yagi Finance is building an automation system on Starknet. So when it comes to stop the mint that has a complex physics, what Yagi Finance can help is to carry on the simulation. So if I have a very complex simulation that takes ten transactions to complete, Yagi Finance can jump in and call the contract and help me finish the simulation. And so this would relieve the developer of the stress or of the responsibility to continue the simulation. It will also relieve the player of the stress and also the gas fee required to complete the puzzle. So I guess that's coming back to Yagi finance.
00:44:45.022 - 00:44:46.900, Speaker E: This is definitely not a stage question.
00:44:48.310 - 00:45:29.150, Speaker A: Great. This is really interesting. This is nothing to do exactly with that here, but we were discussing with someone who is looking into music on Starknet and we're saying, yeah, you could have the soundtrack of a video game being played by an algorithm at every block, and you could use Yagi to push it forward. Anyway, related to video games, but not directly. Okay, guys, thank you a lot for your presentation. This is a really insightful and really interesting. Where do we follow you? Where do we see Softsumint being pushed? Which Twitter account should we follow and retweet?
00:45:29.490 - 00:46:08.106, Speaker B: Yeah, so definitely follow matchboxdao on Twitter. It's matchbox underscore dao. I think we also have a mirror where we publish this blog post that you just saw on screen about Softsimmer. We also have a discord server where we have discussion channels for all of the different working groups, for all the different projects and primitives we have, where a lot of discussion is going on and all the smart minds come together to figure this stuff out. And I just want to say one more thing. We are going to release a blog post soon outlining our grant program. So if you have any idea, if you dream of building anything related to onchain gaming or Starknet, you can wait for that.
00:46:08.106 - 00:46:19.760, Speaker B: Or you can also reach out to us right now. We will be happy to talk, happy to support you. And definitely go check out others. Go check out the working groups, see what sparks your interest. I'm sure there's something for you in there.
00:46:23.760 - 00:46:51.684, Speaker A: Amazing. Thank you. All right, so I think this concludes the presentation for today's calls. It's been pretty quiet. I haven't seen many questions in the community call channel on Discord, and I haven't seen many on YouTube either. If you have questions, don't hesitate and ask them there while we still have a few minutes. Otherwise, I think we can.
00:46:51.684 - 00:47:20.620, Speaker A: Thank you guys for your contribution, and we're really looking forward to what you guys have in store for the future. One extra question quickly. What kind of video games do you guys play? What is the universe you guys come from in terms of video games? Are there any specific ecosystem or games you guys are really into, or is the team each and everyone playing in a bit of different games?
00:47:21.520 - 00:47:25.250, Speaker B: Are you asking about on chain games specifically or games in general?
00:47:26.180 - 00:47:27.932, Speaker A: More broadly, any games?
00:47:28.076 - 00:47:55.290, Speaker B: Okay, sure. So I really enjoy shooters, but I also enjoy, I have a thing for games that really make you addicted to them. So, for example, which is why I'm so excited about Ogame, the sprouts browser space game, because I played it back in the day and it was super addicting. Right. And so Alessandro is building that on stuff, and I can't wait to check out the first release and see how it goes. I'm super excited about that.
00:47:58.220 - 00:48:13.330, Speaker A: Thank you. There's a question by Dt. Davis. I understand and appreciate the phases on physics puzzle, but will there be more Cairo specific ones like the Cairo games? That's a good think.
00:48:14.420 - 00:48:14.784, Speaker C: So.
00:48:14.822 - 00:49:27.510, Speaker A: The Cairo games, for those who are not aware, were a set of games and mostly math and cryptographic games that were released. A few, I was going to say back in the days, it's not that far in the past, but it's sometime in the past and that were really focused on the Cairo language and zero knowledge proof. I think right now here I'm going to take a step back and talk a bit more about educating people on Cairo and Starknet provable program and Cairo in general and Starknet in particular are a very new programmation paradigm and it's really hard to see exactly what will emerge on top of it. I think that's one of the most. That's both very exciting and very frustrating. It's very exciting because once you wrap your mind around the fact that there is raw power at your disposal and you can do new stuff that you couldn't do before, this is really stimulating to a lot of people. It's also very frustrating because when people say, hey, so what's going to be built with that? It's hard to come up with an answer.
00:49:27.510 - 00:50:31.784, Speaker A: The future by definition is not defined. So it's hard to say this will happen, people will build that. And so what's really cool about the initiative of salt to mint, for example? It's people who are enthusiastic about something, who are looking at a new technology and thinking, how can I apply this to my particular vertical, to my particular passion? So that's why they're focusing on physics, because it makes sense for physics to be applied to games. Now there are a lot more things you can do with Cairo, and I'm sure we're going to see some cool initiatives emerge in the future. If there are some that you'd be interested in, reach out. I'd be curious to know what you think are cool stuff we could imagine and build on top of Cairo. And if there are some things you want to develop and games and challenges to tickle people's brain and make them interested in getting to build with us, with all of us, that would be fantastic.
00:50:31.784 - 00:51:28.780, Speaker A: So reach out for that. Also, I'd mentioned also that it was announced yesterday that we're going to have a Cairo underhanded context contest, which is basically not a capture the flag. It's basically a competition where you have to write malicious code and you get to write malicious code and people need to try to figure out why it is malicious. So it's a competition for malicious code, but it's all friendly and nice. And hopefully this has interesting and simulating discussions around Cairo and it helps underline and outline attack surface on top of Cairo. So if you're interested in these kind of games, also join these and if you're interested with challenges so they're more around usability of starknet. But we have a bunch of tutorials that we released that revolve around ERC 20.
00:51:28.780 - 00:51:57.030, Speaker A: So how to do an IcO on Starknet? Customize an ERC 20 to do an IcO ERC 721. So customizing ERC 721 to raise animals. We recently released one about messaging bridge. So how do you have an action on l two have some impact on l one. So we're writing all of these as kind of challenges. You can collect points. We're trying to gamify it to make it fun to play.
00:51:57.030 - 00:52:38.056, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a long answer, but something specifically like the Cairo games, we know there's interest in doing something like that. Right now what matters is bandwidth. How do we get to address all of these things people want? At the same time, if you want to help and you want to get involved doing these things, please do. We're happy to have you. And I think we've covered home. There are more questions on YouTube, so zero knowledge is asking. And that's a question for you, Matchbox.
00:52:38.056 - 00:52:51.800, Speaker A: I think, how do you plan to monetize open source tools for devs? Is there a sustainable model with opening tools? With opening tools to the public for people to use, et cetera?
00:52:54.060 - 00:53:09.052, Speaker B: I can take this. So the plan is basically to have a repository of open source tooling that anybody can use, or even game components, and then we can actually productize the games that are built on top.
00:53:09.106 - 00:53:09.372, Speaker A: Right.
00:53:09.426 - 00:53:35.280, Speaker B: So the underlying tooling and components are open source, but we can spin those out into games and then we can monetize those games. So if Matchbox is, for example, incubating a game, then we can have an agreement with the game that we get to invest into the game. But all of the underlying things that we build are all open source, so there's nothing there that we would monetize directly. So that's the model that we are following.
00:53:35.440 - 00:53:45.720, Speaker A: Thank you. That's interesting, because in a game, ultimately what matters is not just the technology, it's also the community and the people involved with the game. Right. This is harder to fork.
00:53:46.540 - 00:53:47.930, Speaker B: Absolutely. Yeah.
00:53:48.380 - 00:54:07.250, Speaker A: Cool. We have another question on YouTube. How does the on chain game logic work on Starknet? Do you perform action on the server and verify the settled state with a Cairo contract? Or is every action of the game specified in the yeah, do you guys want to answer this one?
00:54:08.660 - 00:54:13.650, Speaker B: I think I'll defer this to guilty, who has probably a much better understanding of this than I do.
00:54:17.320 - 00:55:06.880, Speaker A: So I'll try to answer I think the difference between Ethereum and Starknet with regard to computation is the following. On Ethereum, if you do the computation off chain, you can post it on chain and Ethereum basically has to trust you on Starknet. Right now what you would have is you would have to do the computation on chain. So the computation is done on chain and is part of the proof that will ultimately get settled on Ethereum. This is because we don't have yet in Starknet the capacity to verify a proof. But eventually you're right, we can imagine a lot of other stuff. You could imagine something Allah Dydx, where the logic is executed off chain and just the proof is submitted to Starknet.
00:55:06.880 - 00:55:14.196, Speaker A: But it is not something that is possible right now. Do you guys want to add something?
00:55:14.298 - 00:55:19.320, Speaker B: Matchbox I think that was a very good explanation.
00:55:22.060 - 00:55:50.530, Speaker A: Thank you. Okay, so I think we've covered most, I mean, all the questions I have seen. If you still have some, you can post them in community call channel and we'll be happy to answer them. And other than that, I invite you to check the community call channel. There's the matchbox, Twitter and discord, as well as a description of their mixture and activity. And I think we can conclude today's community call. Thank you again for your time.
00:55:50.530 - 00:56:30.700, Speaker A: Thank you for your brain time in two weeks. So the next two community calls are going to be a bit different. We're probably not going to have member or team presentation in two weeks. We're going to talk decentralization. We will have Ohad from Starkware presenting concepts and ideas we have around decentralization of Starknet. It's basically going to be a follow up on all the shaman's post he pushed recently. So if you want to come prepared and with questions, do go read this post.
00:56:30.700 - 00:57:23.152, Speaker A: This is an important topic and it's going to be a really interesting discussion. So be there in two weeks and then in another two weeks, community call will basically happen during the Starknet hackathon in Amsterdam. So I don't think we're going to make a formal call, but it will probably just be me with a computer walking around the hackathon and saying hello to everyone and presenting teams and you'll be able to pitch your project if you're at the hackathon. So this is what's going to happen for the next two events. By the way, I wanted to mention something else. We have a hackathon in Amsterdam right after Devconnect, so if you want to attend, there are still some tickets. Do register because I think it's going to be sold out at some point.
00:57:23.152 - 00:57:58.832, Speaker A: So register. Come prepared by doing some cairo before and try to find a team. On discord. I also wanted to mention that on discord there are some people writing a tool that help you aggregate what happens on a discord server and publish it as an excerpt. It's called wrap up and they're present on Discord. I'm going to publish a link to what they're doing on our server. It's basically a tool to try to make it easier for you to manage your discord management.
00:57:58.832 - 00:58:11.436, Speaker A: So take a look at their tool. They're looking for feedback and they'll be happy if you send them some. And with that being said, thank you again, everyone, and let's conclude the call for this week.
00:58:11.618 - 00:58:13.804, Speaker B: Thank you so much for having us. Was great.
00:58:14.002 - 00:58:16.280, Speaker C: Thanks, Henry. Bye.
