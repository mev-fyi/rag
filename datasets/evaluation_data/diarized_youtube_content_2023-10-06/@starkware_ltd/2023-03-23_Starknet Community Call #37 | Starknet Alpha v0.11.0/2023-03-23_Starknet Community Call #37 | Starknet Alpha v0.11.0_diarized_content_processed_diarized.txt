00:00:00.170 - 00:00:30.742, Speaker A: All right, YouTube seems to be up. I'm going to press go live on YouTube and we should now be live. All right, everyone, I'm Henry. I'll be your operator for today. Today we have a special community call regarding Starknet version Zero Point eleven. This is your AMA, this is your time to ask any questions you may have about zero point eleven before the first starknet governance vote. Okay.
00:00:30.742 - 00:01:10.510, Speaker A: All right, everyone, welcome. So we're doing a special community call today because yesterday on Testnet we had actually zero point eleven be deployed. So first I want us to give a big round of applause for that. We have been waiting for so long. It is here. And now is the time for anyone here, Dev passerby fishermen, to ask questions about whatever they want on Cairo Zero Point eleven before it gets voted on. Today with me I have Silv and Devin, who are the governance facilitator.
00:01:10.510 - 00:01:55.890, Speaker A: I have Manor from Starquare who is also working on the governance facilitation. And I have Ariel, aka feed the fed with the person who is going to answer most of your question. All right, so I'll be monitoring the questions in YouTube as well as on Twitter. And we have the first comment on YouTube with guide boot saying sup? So I'm not sure we can answer much. You know, keep these questions coming. We are very grateful for your participation. Let me see if we have something on Twitter and let's share the link for the community call in a broader forum.
00:01:55.890 - 00:01:58.530, Speaker A: Has someone shared it on corestars?
00:02:04.040 - 00:02:05.270, Speaker B: I'll do it.
00:02:05.960 - 00:02:06.710, Speaker A: Nice.
00:02:10.780 - 00:02:13.080, Speaker C: I posted in the community forum.
00:02:16.140 - 00:03:22.172, Speaker A: Wonderful. All right, so while we are waiting for question and for people to connect, Ariel, any specific thing you want to talk about on version zero point eleven? Last time we had this community call or a similar community call, we went through the change log and documentation about zero point eleven and we covered everything that was going to be implemented in zero Point eleven. Since then, zero point eleven happened and the process was a bit different than what we would expect. I think zero point eleven was rolled out to integration and then there has been five or six versions of this before it reached Testnet. Do you want to, I don't know, talk a little bit about the process, how it happened, what happened, so that we had six versions and what we're looking forward to for Testnet. Will there be six versions for Testnet or not really? Yeah.
00:03:22.226 - 00:03:27.920, Speaker D: So I'll try to answer that. TLDR is no, we now have this one version.
00:03:28.420 - 00:03:29.170, Speaker E: Cool.
00:03:30.420 - 00:05:17.760, Speaker D: So from now on, every startnet version will be associated with a specific compiler version under the hood. And I recommend everyone to check out the docs about why do we need Cairo one and Sierra in the first place? And what else is it except a much nicer language than Cairo zero. But the short version is that every compiler can basically use a specific set of functions that we call lead funks and only some of those are allowed. Each such function has to be audited because the important property that we want from Sierra, that every contact execution will be provable, depends very much on how exactly the compiler compiles your lib trunk. So between version one and version six of the compiler, we improved those found issuing those, and fixed them to make sure that the ones that are live on Testnet, at least to the best of our knowledge, have this property of always being provable. And that aside, there were many starknet features that were added in the meantime. I think Alpha one up to something up to four, had basically zero of the system calls, which meant pretty much standalone smart contracts or contact calls.
00:05:17.760 - 00:05:32.764, Speaker D: And now we have basically every system call that was available on Cairo Zero, also available with Cairo one contacts. So it's a combination of features and security guarantees.
00:05:32.912 - 00:05:50.012, Speaker A: Nice. So we've had to wait a little bit longer, but we've got more as a result. That's pretty cool. So you mentioned that there were some issues that were fine while on integration. What should I do if I find an issue in a leapfunk while it's on testnet? Who should I reach out? What's the kennel to raise an issue and say something's wrong?
00:05:50.066 - 00:06:12.724, Speaker D: Guys, first of all, I think such an issue can only be discovered if you look through the Cairo assembly generated by the compiler. So it's not like you're writing Cairo one and you're doing stuff. And you'll notice, I don't know. If you're not looking for it, you probably won't find it. But if you do find it, you.
00:06:12.762 - 00:06:16.116, Speaker A: Don'T know these people, Ariel. They will look for everything and they.
00:06:16.138 - 00:06:20.390, Speaker D: Will yell on every channel especially.
00:06:22.120 - 00:06:30.650, Speaker A: Is this actually the process pinging everyone? Like what should people do? Should they ping you, should they ping me? Is there an email? Is there a process or is just trying to reach us?
00:06:30.960 - 00:06:46.130, Speaker D: The Cairo one channel on discord. I think most of the discussion, language discussion today happened there, which I think is nice, mimics the early days of Cairo Zero, and I think that would be a good place to start.
00:06:46.740 - 00:07:26.990, Speaker A: Wonderful. So Gaet boot is asking, do you think the one week trial is enough to minimize mistakes before deploying on main net? I think here there's probably something we didn't talk about enough. So zero point eleven is on testnet and zero point eleven is going to move to main net, provided the governance votes for it in a week. But Cairo one won't be usable on main net straight off the bat. Is that correct? Ariel, can you explain the rationale behind that and what will be the process to get and the timeline to get Cairo one deployed on main net, please?
00:07:27.600 - 00:08:44.980, Speaker D: Yes, exactly. So once eleven reaches Mainet, if the vote is successful, then declare v two transactions, which are the way to add Kyle one contracts won't be accepted by the sequencer initially, the version will be pretty much identical. Everything would be identical except this feature flag will be off. And after, let's say a few weeks to up to a small number of months on testnet. If we feel comfortable, we'll start accepting Kai one contracts on Main. The issue that we want to try out on testnet first and not have to handle on Mainet is the case where some contracts reach Mainet and they don't have the property that we desired from Sierra because of some bug. And we hope that this period of experimenting on Testnet will help to expose those in addition to all the audits, both internal and external.
00:08:47.720 - 00:09:19.520, Speaker A: Fantastic. All right, so earlier today I published something for people to deploy their first chiro one contract. And the Cac Tariq wrote, I wanted to try Sierra's ability to include a failed TX. So I wrote a dump function that failed. However, I can't send a TX because it fails and it isn't sent to the sequencer. Is there a way to test the feature? And I think the answer is it doesn't exist.
00:09:20.980 - 00:10:18.260, Speaker D: Yes, and that would be the short answer. So while we moved to Kyo one and Sierra, we're still not using all the capabilities of Sierra. For example, we're not proving reverted transactions just yet. They're still treated the same way by the sequencer, even though internally this is captured as an error. In one of the next versions, we will add the notion of reverted transactions to starknet, which we didn't have so far and we still don't have, but now we have all the infrastructure required to have those. And with this new notion, a simple transaction that fails, I don't know, division by zero or whatever reason caused your transaction to fail. It will be included in a block and the sequencer will charge fees up to the point of failure.
00:10:20.360 - 00:10:36.628, Speaker A: Okay, very nice. It makes it much clearer. So Sierra will give us failed transactions, but they haven't been implemented yet. Very nice. Let me check if there are other questions. So Gaba is saying GM, GM Gaba.
00:10:36.724 - 00:10:40.810, Speaker D: Happy to have you here, but it's almost evening. Makes no sense.
00:10:42.940 - 00:11:00.176, Speaker A: If you've devbed all night long trying to deploy your first carawan contract, now is a good morning. It's always morning, know. Okay, let's see on core star, if there are questions. No questions that I see.
00:11:00.358 - 00:11:55.090, Speaker B: There's a question on Twitter, which is what's the criteria for voting? It's a bit of a broad question, but I can try and take that one, please. Alpha V eleven is the first version on which the starting community is going to vote on the upgrade. So as Ariel have explained, we just released the stockware, just released the update on Stocknet testnet girly. And currently we have a six day period to vote if we want this upgrade to be enacted on Stocknet mainet. So the current token holders have the ability to vote on this. So we have a dedicated snapshot space in a proposal that is currently running. I think we have 54 voters so far.
00:11:55.090 - 00:12:00.992, Speaker B: I think all of them have voted in favor of the upgrade.
00:12:01.056 - 00:12:11.432, Speaker A: I'm actually checking. And some people voted against. We have 53 million stark voting against. And 21 million. I mean, 33 million. 53 million. Sorry.
00:12:11.432 - 00:12:18.712, Speaker A: Voting against. 21 million stark tokens abstaining. And then 1.5 billion voting for.
00:12:18.766 - 00:12:21.724, Speaker B: I think you're looking at the test one we had done.
00:12:21.922 - 00:12:27.100, Speaker A: Oh my, you're right. Okay, I embarrassed myself again.
00:12:27.170 - 00:12:27.932, Speaker B: No problem.
00:12:28.066 - 00:12:30.252, Speaker A: We have 300 million voting for.
00:12:30.306 - 00:13:33.436, Speaker B: Then we have 300 million token total that have voted. Their current distribution of voting power is the following. A third of it are investors, a third of them are co contributors and development partners, clean companies that have developed key infrastructures, partners that have built a part of the starting ecosystem. And our third is 23% is the builder council, which is a council of 17 builders chosen by the Startnet foundation to vote as a voting block. So I'm the governance facilitator in charge of the builder council. We're going to reconvene in the coming days to discuss this upgrade and whether the builder council is going to vote for or against this upgrade. So that represents 23% of the voting power and the remaining 10% are delegates that were chosen and appointed by the Stockholm foundation.
00:13:33.436 - 00:14:09.390, Speaker B: So we have about, I think, 90, 95 delegates in total that have been delegated 500 million worth of voting power. So so far we've seen a pretty big turnout of these delegates. And we really encourage, if you're a delegate or if you have any opinion regarding the upgrade, we really encourage you to vote. Your opinion on the community forum on the Devin has written a post regarding the 00:11 do not hesitate to ask any question there if there's any problem.
00:14:10.480 - 00:14:38.870, Speaker A: I think something interesting also is that right now, delegates are people, right? Independent people. But eventually, nothing prevents a delegate from saying, hey, I'm going to create a dow that becomes a delegate, that organizes the way we vote in a different way. Right. You can decide to have your own forum, to have your own calls, to have your own folklore. Because I think the builders consul, when you guys meet, you have this special attire, right? You have to wear a builder's hat and something like that. Is that correct?
00:14:39.320 - 00:15:04.640, Speaker B: So it's actually a building competition. So we all get little lego blocks and we have to build the highest tower in the shortest amount of time. And then you get to vote. So the builder council, for instance, the voting power has been delegated to a multi sig. And so we vote, and then we decide to enact the decision on the multi sig directly.
00:15:06.260 - 00:15:14.284, Speaker A: It's not like it's a vote. You vote on the call and then some signers enact the vote as one voice.
00:15:14.412 - 00:15:46.700, Speaker B: Yes. Because if you do it through a multi sig, you can't necessarily have all the layers and the complexities of an actual vote, because it's usually, okay, do you want to approve this transaction or not? What we want here is actually to have a discussion. So abstaining. Or you can't have, for instance, one person saying no, because it will invalidate the entire transaction. So this is why it's not actually a vote. It's like you're enacting the vote on chain.
00:15:48.000 - 00:16:08.848, Speaker A: So many layers of governance. All right, so we have Devin Matthew saying GN. So I guess is somewhere where it's night. Oh, wait, you're in Japan, David. Yeah, it is. It makes sense. Ramsey saying, sup.
00:16:08.848 - 00:16:22.600, Speaker A: Then we have Atakan saying, hey, Atakan from Goplus security. Greetings from Istanbul. Will there be any difference for current security tools such as fuzzers, static analyzers, or formal verification tools?
00:16:26.900 - 00:17:29.460, Speaker D: I think yes, but depends on exactly what component are you looking at? If you're looking at, let's say, fuzzers, then I think most of the work is on the kyo one side. So you'll have changes for obvious reasons, because it's a new language, you need new tooling. Formal verification, that depends. Just like formal verification on Ethereum can happen either on solidity or on EVM. Here you can choose to look at Cairo, one, Sierra, or Cairo assembly? Cairo assembly is unchanged, so everything that was developed for Cairo assembly is still useful. I think that companies whose expertise is formal verification usually go to the lower level setting. So they will probably still continue to look at Cairo assembly.
00:17:29.460 - 00:17:49.820, Speaker D: But yeah, I'm not an expert here, so I can't really say. But this layer remains unchanged. So the only question is, do you have something to gain by looking at the new intermediate layer?
00:17:54.330 - 00:18:24.494, Speaker A: Thank you, Ariel. So Adekbeta Demola is saying hello, I am following the GitHub repo to deploy my Carawan contract, but I am experiencing a blocker at the point of setting a new account for the tutorial. I'm getting the error account not found. Exception account for network alpha girly not found. How do I resolve this? Well, you need to deploy an account. Basically it's the CLI telling you you haven't deployed an account yet. So there's a small part in the tutorial telling you how to do this.
00:18:24.494 - 00:18:49.938, Speaker A: So go for that. All right. I actually have another question for you, Ariel. So I saw a question pass somewhere, somebody saying, oh, here's a crazy id. A lib funk called execute as Int that gets a sierra function and runs it as an int. What's the point of doing that? What would that achieve?
00:18:50.114 - 00:18:51.670, Speaker D: Sorry, can you repeat?
00:18:52.590 - 00:19:05.942, Speaker A: Yes, the question here's a crazy id. It would be a lib funk called execute as hint that gets a Sierra function and runs it as a hint.
00:19:06.086 - 00:19:07.500, Speaker D: We should give proper.
00:19:11.390 - 00:19:26.462, Speaker A: So this is a crazy id from Shah. It's something that is internal. So it's definitely. I'm not sure how much of. I don't think it's fully confidential, but I didn't get it. And it sounds interesting. So can you explain what this achieves?
00:19:26.606 - 00:20:03.182, Speaker D: Shahar is ten steps ahead of everyone. So I must admit that I don't really understand the idea completely. I think this can be a quick solution of adding hints to Cairo. So if we're looking at Cairo Zero, Cairo Zero had hints, and these had to be whitelisted to be operational on Starknet. But the mechanism was exactly the same. If your hint was whitelisted, you could have used it on your smart contract. Cairo one does not have this concept, at least at the moment.
00:20:03.182 - 00:20:20.514, Speaker D: There are no hints. There are only lib funks. You're writing Chiro one this compiled to Sierra, and Sierra has lib funks. If you want new fancy logic, let's say verifying a signature on some different new curves, then you may want a lib funk that does this.
00:20:20.552 - 00:20:24.118, Speaker A: Let's say, why can't you do this in Cairo one?
00:20:24.284 - 00:21:19.510, Speaker D: Yes, so you can do it in Cairo one and it will work. But let's say it takes too many steps in Cairo one, and you're thinking to yourself, oh, but I'm thinking of this hint I can use, and then this would have been a lot faster to verify the signature. So this you can do in Cairo one. And if you want some logic that is relying on hints, you have to introduce it to the system as a lib funk, which has to have all the important properties that I've briefly mentioned before. For example, there can be a flow where the generated Cairo assembly fails. So that's the analog of having new fancy Cairo zero logic, which uses hints. Here you would have to introduce a new lib funk that makes use of those hints in a way that is safe.
00:21:19.510 - 00:21:40.590, Speaker D: This bypasses the need to have hint syntax in the language, and you can still use the power of hints for a certain logical unit. In starknet, unlike Cairo Zero, where either you had hints or you whitelisted or you didn't.
00:21:41.570 - 00:21:50.654, Speaker A: Does this mean that essentially it allows you in your chiro one contract to have a small window where you can run CR code directly, which gives you.
00:21:50.692 - 00:22:22.346, Speaker D: Different the idea that you mentioned. If I understand it correctly, it's pretty much it. I think the motivation is, let's not have, I don't know, a long period of development around adding hints to Cairo, but let's just add this specific lib funk that takes Sierra code and executes it. And we can use this as the hint syntax for Cairo one, which may.
00:22:22.528 - 00:22:23.850, Speaker A: Sierra hints.
00:22:24.350 - 00:22:55.560, Speaker D: Yeah, Sierra hints. I think it means you're replacing pythonic hints with Sierra. And there are some trade offs here, which I don't completely understand. But yeah, the whole motivation is some quicker way to add hints to Kyle one, but just to be clear, this is not a priority for Starknet, because you don't really need those. What you need is fancier lib funks that you will have.
00:22:58.010 - 00:22:59.720, Speaker A: Starware is writing them.
00:23:00.170 - 00:23:32.340, Speaker D: Yes, and something that we have to figure out is how exactly we're externalizing this process, because you can't have a lib funk, which isn't safe, but you don't want only a small number of people writing lib funks. You should think of them maybe as analogous to pre compile. It's also not a trivial process to add a new pre compiled to Ethereum. It's not something that you can do without proper thinking, but there is a process for that. And I think we need to converge on something for Startnet as well.
00:23:32.870 - 00:23:58.010, Speaker A: Cool, thank you. All right, so there is another question Machek is asking. There are missing features in Cairo. One, for example, the ability to store structs in storage. Unless you want to write a lot of ballard plates or primitive types like I 256 or bytes 32 et cetera, or for loops. What's the development timeline around those missing features?
00:23:59.150 - 00:24:53.258, Speaker D: So can't really commit to anything. But the nice property for language features is that they do not rely on a starknet upgrade. Anything that doesn't require new capabilities from Sierra and just uses existing primitives, but just gives nicer higher level syntax. This can be done seamlessly, so I'm not sure off the top of my head what are the current language features being worked on. Loops are definitely in this list, in the planned list. I'm not sure about all the types that you mentioned, but I guess so that sounds reasonable. Struct in storage I am not sure if this is work on progress or not, but I'm sure that if you'll tag papino on discord, he will let you know.
00:24:53.258 - 00:25:01.598, Speaker D: And if you'll tag him enough times, maybe he'll just do it overnight and implement it. Don't say I said it, it's recorded.
00:25:01.684 - 00:25:04.910, Speaker A: Ariel, there's a red corner on the top of the screen.
00:25:05.060 - 00:25:06.320, Speaker B: Do quote him.
00:25:07.890 - 00:25:44.406, Speaker A: All right, I hope this answers your question, but interesting insight here is that there are two compilation process one from Cairo, one to Sierra, and another one from Sierra to chasm. The compilation from Sierra to Chasm is tied to Starknet. So when we need to upgrade Sierra to move Sierra from one version to another, we need to move Starknet from one version to another. However, for the higher level compiler from Quira one to Sierra, this one, we can upgrade it various times without having to upgrade Starknet, which is pretty cool. Is that correct, Ariel?
00:25:44.598 - 00:25:45.050, Speaker D: Yes.
00:25:45.120 - 00:26:00.180, Speaker A: Now, where does governance fit in? Does governance fit in just for the Starknet upgrades, for the Sierra to chasm upgrades, for the Cairo one to Sierra upgrade, I want all the power. I want to vote on everything or not, I don't know.
00:26:00.550 - 00:26:11.030, Speaker B: Before answering that one, I have a follow up question coming from Nicola from Ledger. He's asking if there are any contract accounts on zero point eleven.
00:26:12.730 - 00:26:17.560, Speaker D: If there are any Cairo one account contract, you mean?
00:26:18.010 - 00:26:22.334, Speaker B: I would assume so. I'm just going to ping pong.
00:26:22.482 - 00:26:32.860, Speaker D: We have on the compiler repo an example account contract. I'm not sure if someone declared it yet, but it should work. So go for it.
00:26:34.270 - 00:26:35.020, Speaker B: Okay.
00:26:37.810 - 00:26:50.450, Speaker A: Yeah, but we could probably ask the guys at ledger if they're working on it. Yeah, right now I think the cli still uses Cairo zero contract.
00:26:51.430 - 00:26:54.340, Speaker D: Yes, the account in the CLI is Cairo zero.
00:26:55.430 - 00:27:00.290, Speaker B: Okie dokie, you just said. Yeah, I was looking for a Cairo 1.0 contract.
00:27:01.030 - 00:27:14.680, Speaker D: Yes, so in the compiler repos somewhere there's a set of examples and one of them is a basic account. If you can find it just write in the discord and I or someone else will link it.
00:27:19.120 - 00:27:25.760, Speaker B: Got you. So your question already was what are we voting on? Is it?
00:27:25.830 - 00:27:29.650, Speaker D: Yeah, I don't know if I should leave it to you or manor to myself.
00:27:31.380 - 00:27:33.300, Speaker B: Yeah, I'll hand it over to manor.
00:27:35.400 - 00:28:09.130, Speaker E: Okay. Hi. So on the first phases of stocknet governance we're definitely going to vote only about the stagnant upgrades and not on the kygo one upgrade. In the future we want to have more and more governance mechanism from other stuff on the other components of the network, but in the first phase for sure, and the next phases as well, we'll only vote on the stagnant upgrade. Okay Henry, answer your question?
00:28:09.740 - 00:28:34.502, Speaker A: Yeah, pretty much. All right, let's see if there are other questions. There's no other question on YouTube. Let's see. Actually something just popped up. Some matchek is saying some types should be reflected in the AbI. Yeah, there's probably something missing in the compiler.
00:28:34.502 - 00:28:45.310, Speaker A: Don't update in flag bugs. If people have feature requests or bugs they want to signal on Cairo one, where should they go on the Cairo repo? On the Cairo land repo.
00:28:48.850 - 00:29:08.200, Speaker D: Not the Cairo land repo, that's Cairo zero or stocknet stuff, but on the Cairo repo with the Kyo one compiler. So you can either leave an issue there or if it's something minor which you're not sure if is a bug or not, then discord specifically the Kyle one channel.
00:29:11.770 - 00:29:25.920, Speaker A: All right, so Marto law is saying we are finishing our account contract at Oz, there's an open pa you can look into. It's missing tests only. So that was for your question, Silv Openzeppelin is on the case.
00:29:26.530 - 00:29:33.920, Speaker B: Perfect. And I also got a message from Arjon saying Arjon is also on the case, so it's a race to the finish.
00:29:39.010 - 00:30:12.810, Speaker A: Cool. Then Adekbite is saying oh, I have created an account and it generates the account, address it at the point of running the command darknet deploy account that I get the error. So Adagbyte, do send me a message on Discord, I'll try to answer it, but short answer, did you fund it. Did you specify the name of your account? Okay, following up on questions, Marto is saying there's actually a couple interface details to be agreed on. For example is Valin signature can now return true thanks to Sierra. Interesting. So standardization around wallet is still ongoing thanks to Sierra.
00:30:12.810 - 00:30:38.340, Speaker A: All right, so Machek is saying sometimes should be reflected in the ABi, which sounds like a starknet upgrade. I'm not entirely sure what this means, so if you can give more details, I'll be happy to answer them then. Julia oh my God, we have a lot of people building wallets in the chat. Julia N is saying is one week between the deployment testnet and the government and the governance vote enough?
00:30:40.490 - 00:30:56.090, Speaker D: Back to the answer about Cairo one. Needing some extra lag to reach mainet TLDR feature flag declare v two s will be off on Mainet for a period of testnet experimentation.
00:30:57.470 - 00:31:31.426, Speaker A: But I think the point still stands. Okay, so you're saying Cairo one won't be available from on main net before sometime, and we want to push zero point eleven to mainnet in the meanwhile because it has nice improvements for stocknet. Fair enough. But still people are not voting for Cairo one, they're voting for zero point eleven. So they're also voting for these improvements to Stucknet. Is one week enough for them to be comfortable with the vote? I'd say the question is for them, not for us. But I don't know.
00:31:31.426 - 00:31:33.060, Speaker A: Do you have thoughts on that.
00:31:35.590 - 00:31:54.178, Speaker E: For six days enough? Well, we said it seems reasonable and we will start with that. And if we will see that after the first vote, we will have comments to make it longer, we'll do it. We're supposed to give enough time for people to check and ask question and discuss and then get decisions. So if it's not enough time, we'll be happy to hear your feedback.
00:31:54.294 - 00:31:56.426, Speaker A: Where should people give this feedback?
00:31:56.618 - 00:32:04.720, Speaker E: Definitely on the community forum. We have a specific discussion thread regarding this specific vote and we'll be happy to hear it.
00:32:05.170 - 00:32:54.958, Speaker A: Okay, so sending back the question to you, Julian N, if you think this is too short, make your voice heard. Write it in the community forum and let's open the discussion around that. And Marto is saying, julian is saying, given that we're only deploying contracts now, one week might not be enough to detect issues. Fair enough. So again, for Cairo one, you'll get more time. Then Marto is saying it'd be very valuable to formalize our expectations and scope of the builder's vote. What does approval mean? Yep, that's a good we does it mean we consider it secure? Does it mean that it has no bugs, that it is feature complete? Does it mean that it doesn't break in a week? I think here, yeah that's a good question.
00:32:54.958 - 00:32:59.620, Speaker A: What does the builders console saying yes we approve mean?
00:33:04.070 - 00:33:55.906, Speaker B: The scope of what we're going to approve is obviously we can't have the full on deluxe verification of having two weeks on testnet. Us saying yes within the allocated timeframe means that we are confident enough that it can go there. If we do feel that it is not the case or it would mandate a bit more time or anything else. This is something that we can voice and obviously as Mano has said, if we feel that this is not productive and that we need more time to test or something else, this is what we're going to do. We'll enact this further in the other roads. As it stands currently, this was already, the six days period was already what was happening. When stockware deploys a new version on Testnet we have to wait six days and then it gets a rid of the main net.
00:33:55.906 - 00:34:11.960, Speaker B: It's just that we're adding governance on top of it without changing much here. If we do feel that it would be relevant to increase that time or to set expectations for the vote, I think we should do it.
00:34:12.890 - 00:34:36.000, Speaker A: But I think the question here is, what is the question being asked? Like do you approve of Starknet? Zero point eleven going on Starknet? Does it mean, do you think it's safe? Do you think it's useful? Do you think it's a nice trade off? Do you want to try and see what happens? And I guess it's more of the latter actually, yes. Nice.
00:34:36.530 - 00:34:50.834, Speaker E: I think it's kind of altogether right. So if you approve it to go to minute, it means you approve that this is going to be the next version of Starknet. It's supposed for you to make sure that you feel that this is secure and it's important for the.
00:34:50.872 - 00:34:52.034, Speaker A: Secure enough.
00:34:52.232 - 00:35:14.060, Speaker E: Secure enough, exactly. But not in a way that you have to specifically do the full audit circle with your own right. It says like I take a look and it seems vimmable and it seems like the right people that I know push it forward, et cetera. And if you want to take it to do the whole thing by yourself it's great. And if you need more time just let us know.
00:35:16.510 - 00:35:54.090, Speaker C: I think there's also like a very solid action that is going to happen as a result of this governance vote which is Mainet will be upgraded to this version that you can go and review and test on testnet and really about the criteria for how we decide whether that action should be taken, which is like, do we consider it secure? Do we consider it complete? Do we think this upgrade is good or not? I think really kind of falls on the voters themselves. And I'd almost be afraid for us to define that expectation about what people should consider correct. For an upgrade to be upgraded to mainnet.
00:35:58.910 - 00:36:20.820, Speaker A: Makes sense. Marto is saying, me as a builder, what's my responsibility? Should I code review the upgrade? Should I review the feature list, look for bugs, name says? Right. Exactly. Which I think is an answer to. We don't expect people to do it because they took too much time. It required. Not it.
00:36:20.820 - 00:36:30.760, Speaker A: All right, so in a nutshell, we all agree to all the ends and jump together in the pool, which is cool.
00:36:34.920 - 00:36:36.416, Speaker B: Governance, baby.
00:36:36.608 - 00:36:37.510, Speaker A: I'm sorry?
00:36:38.040 - 00:36:39.540, Speaker B: Governance, baby.
00:36:41.080 - 00:36:55.400, Speaker A: Nice. All right, I don't see more questions. Let me check. Have you received any over, anyone from the chat from special back channel telegram?
00:37:00.910 - 00:37:05.260, Speaker B: Well, all quiet on the western front on my end.
00:37:06.110 - 00:37:26.562, Speaker A: Nice. All right. Should we call it a day? Yeah. All right. So thank you for everyone who joined us. You can always ask these questions. We're making these calls because it's funnier when we get online and say stupid stuff.
00:37:26.562 - 00:38:14.194, Speaker A: And interesting ones also, of course, but it's funnier to get people online. But these questions are really important and we want people to engage in this process and ask these questions. So do ask them on the community forum, do ask them on telegram. There's no dumb question, there's no offensive question. So please voice your voice and make sure that you're comfortable with what's happening. All right? Agree, gentlemen, I'll see you soon. Gm gn enjoy your day, enjoy your night, and I'll see you soon.
00:38:14.392 - 00:38:15.358, Speaker B: Cheers, folks.
00:38:15.454 - 00:38:19.470, Speaker A: All right. Have a good day. Bye.
