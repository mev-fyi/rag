00:00:00.240 - 00:00:02.394, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're alive now, so it's good.
00:00:03.294 - 00:00:04.194, Speaker B: Hi, everyone.
00:00:05.694 - 00:00:15.966, Speaker A: Hey. Hey. I realized I think we are.
00:00:16.070 - 00:00:20.954, Speaker B: I think. I think we're alive. Yeah. Awesome.
00:00:22.094 - 00:00:24.114, Speaker A: Awesome. Sounds good. Okay, we are.
00:00:27.864 - 00:00:30.644, Speaker B: So your search for is starting.
00:00:32.344 - 00:00:35.564, Speaker A: So I'm losing a bit. Just the sound. So can you repeat?
00:00:36.144 - 00:00:39.284, Speaker B: I'm asking if I should start or you should start.
00:00:39.984 - 00:00:56.652, Speaker A: Yeah. Oh, sure, I can start. So no worries. So, yeah, like, hey, thanks for having me, man. Like, it was a pleasure. Always, like, talking in person, and now we can also do, like, you know, live streaming, so it's always good. Yeah, some interesting stuff on importa side, so, yeah, happy to have a chat also this way.
00:00:56.652 - 00:01:05.364, Speaker A: So, yeah, so maybe, yeah, maybe I can do like a short start. What do you think about Nimbora in general? Like, so, like, just to introduce.
00:01:05.404 - 00:01:57.354, Speaker B: I mean, in this case, let me, let me, let me, let me start. So, yeah, so, okay, so in this case, I'm just gonna start and serve as the host. So the first question is, I mean, let's introduce yourself very briefly and introduce myself before. So I'm Louis. I'm the head of product market strategy at Stockware. I've been in crypto for each of four and five and a half, and today I'm very happy to be with my dear Eddie that now I've been knowing for like two years and a half, almost since he joined the stock ecosystem and starting to work on various awesome stuff. And if you can start to sort of introduce yourself, who you are, what you do, what Limbura does, what is your path to crypto and how you get to starknet and why do you love it so much?
00:01:58.734 - 00:02:45.712, Speaker A: Yeah, why I'm so hooked now, you know, it's like, yeah, so, like, my journey Webtree, like, started in 2017 1st, you know, before that, I worked like, you know, enterprise Java, boring stuff and so on as a developer. But then an opportunity came to work on something that's called Zocratis, which some of you know as a toolbox for Zkstniks and Ethereum. So back in the day, the idea was to build this high level DSL, something that Starknet is doing this today to make basically onboarding to ZK easier. Five years ago, it was like, you know, too far away and so on. So, like, that's why I decided to switch to solidity teams and spend basically there for like almost two and a half years. So I was a core dev, basically. There led something that's called sourceify, which is kind of automatic verification tool for smart contracts and that's how the story started.
00:02:45.712 - 00:02:54.164, Speaker A: And then we had the amazing stuff for something that's called Defi Summer. So you know, like those who remember are old enough to remember how crazy it was.
00:02:55.144 - 00:02:58.564, Speaker B: I woke up at 05:00 a.m. to mean those things.
00:03:00.144 - 00:03:21.848, Speaker A: We had shifts over the weekend who like clicks, what and so on. The aprs were crazy. I remember like first meetup we have in Croatia. Like there were three of us and we were pitching to ourselves because nobody knew about this. Everybody was like, okay, you're crazy, sponsonomics is going to die. And look, we are still building those kind of things. So you know, it takes, it takes basically a bit of faith to start this thing.
00:03:21.848 - 00:04:01.146, Speaker A: But yeah, like back in the day, you know, like Defi started and so on. So we were like, but we are like working on this like protocol stuff in Ethereum foundation and it's kind of nice, but it would be fun to like start some product work, try something and so on. And I was a dev, you know usual dev, jumping into the product like waters, don't know nothing, trying to build stuff. But when you think about it, back in the day, everybody was a dev. Like even community managers, everybody basically was a dev. So basically that's how we started and that's how Shard labs basically started as a company. You know, we basically, a bunch of us like gathered and started building stuff, started experimenting and then obviously during that time, Sharp Labs as a company grew up as someone.
00:04:01.146 - 00:04:31.302, Speaker A: We built a bunch of prototypes. One of the biggest projects basically out there was light on Polygon, which is like the biggest LSD on Polygon to this day. Biggest LSD of Matic. So some stuff were built that really, really kind of survived test of time and tried. But my personal passion was always ek because back in the day I scratched the surface with Socrates and so on. And then I think Tom had a presentation in Paris or somewhere about starknet making. You know, it's kind of becoming public and so on.
00:04:31.302 - 00:05:09.136, Speaker A: Like it was pre mainnet. I was like, wait a sec, is this the thing like they managed actually to build this? It actually kind of works. I can build apps. Of course. Everybody was like, oh, just come build like dapps and so on. And that's how basically the journey of starting it also started. So you know how we started tackling it? Like first thing we want to build some defi stuff and then we figure out, oh, but there is like tooling missing, so can we contribute on tooling side? So that's how we kind of started on that front and yeah, like two and a half years already I think on the ecosystem and it's been amazing to be honest because when you think about Louis also like back in the day how it was and now with all these teams ecosystem, how many people there are.
00:05:09.136 - 00:05:39.368, Speaker A: When I see like electric capital reports, like how many 3400, 5500 people building, it's like back in the day it was like 10, 15, 20 people. So you know everybody. So it was really good. But yeah, like the ecosystem evolved and so does the possibilities what we can build on top. So that's why basically the idea of Nimora. So like I know we have this meme that like stark should be unaligned, ethereum unaligned. But we are trying to help it move in the wrong like different direction.
00:05:39.368 - 00:06:07.454, Speaker A: So the whole idea behind Imura is actually quite simple. So like the idea is like we have l, we have a local liquid there and we have this cheaper execution on l two s, in this case darkness. So why wouldn't we use that to scale this. Actually I think you're one of the first articles I read about this was actually yours on the starkware block or something like that back in the day. So maybe you are also to blame for the Nimora story. Who knows?
00:06:08.734 - 00:06:45.404, Speaker B: I mean, I mean that, I mean I did write a couple of articles and back in the day and I'm working on making more now. Super exciting. And as you said, you've been here for a long time. You've been building a lot of tooling for the infrastructure, for the ecosystem as well. Now I'm in Bura. I'm curious you to hear more about what Nimbura actually does and what do you think that brings to the market. So I'm reading the message.
00:06:45.404 - 00:07:16.184, Speaker B: I can't. I mean, oh God, I can. I literally cannot read. Okay, so yeah, so I'm curious to know, so you've been an infrastructure project. You build infrastructure, you build like applications. So maybe you can just walk us around what is Mimbura and what is from your perspective as a builder the difference between one of the others?
00:07:16.964 - 00:07:37.730, Speaker A: Sure. Let's start with the biggest issues with like we have like ldwana and you have like stark and so on. So what kind of biggest issue is like you have this synchronicity on when you want to bridge from like Mainnet to starknet. It's kind of easy. You can do that relatively fast and so on. If you, when you want to bridge back, you have to wait for proofs. So you know, it takes some time and so on.
00:07:37.730 - 00:08:29.836, Speaker A: So like, there is a synchronicity with this, but users don't usually understand these things and you have to explain them. And then you have like l one strategies or l one defi, which works only on l one. So how do you kind of bridge it to the users so they can use it from l two without knowing the whole bridging kind of logic, asynchronicity, you know, having to wait for stuff, having to like, do these multiple steps. Can we create one click defi that moves across boundaries? So that's the idea behind embora. So this kind of like infrastructure that basically abstracts all the bridging part, aggregates users in the batches, and that way decreases the cost per user also, and enables them to interact seamlessly with l one defi. I mean, one of the promises of like, roll ups in general in Zk rollups is to scale ethereum, and this is directly way to do so. And in this case, that was kind of the liquidity defi pooling per se.
00:08:29.836 - 00:08:54.796, Speaker A: When we have like five users on l two, let's say you want to borrow against liquidity on l one. We aggregate that we've reached out as a one kind of asset. Let's say there are five of us, everybody deposited like one e. So we have five eth. We've reached that to l one deposit into liquid withdrawal, borrow l USD against that and bridge it to l two. But the issue with that is you don't know what the gas and mainnet will be in the future. You have delays on that and so on.
00:08:54.796 - 00:09:09.004, Speaker A: So the current iteration we are building with Nimbura is actually, you don't care about l one fees, you just care about l two stuff. And we basically give you this experience, but without exposing to l one gas fees and stuff like that. So that's what's coming.
00:09:10.104 - 00:09:25.794, Speaker B: So what you're describing, and if I'm saying correctly, in Bura, it's, it's a one, one click defi, you said, but not from starknet. It's one click defi. You're basically batching from l two. Two l one and back and.
00:09:28.574 - 00:09:29.394, Speaker A: Forth.
00:09:30.894 - 00:09:48.994, Speaker B: So it starts with this, but it also involves things like direct withdrawal. Right. So if I understand the mirror asking if I understand correctly, basically you're trying to make talking to like, interaction between layers invisible for the users. Is that a correct?
00:09:49.754 - 00:10:26.434, Speaker A: When you think about the Internet, it feels kind of asynchronous, but you don't know. It's kind of asynchronous. Lot of components, information going around. So why would we have to expose users to all these things? Why can't it feel like synchronous? And they're basically like for the deposit obviously of the assets you deposit real two, you don't have to care about l one, all the pieces that are moving around. And then you want, when you want to withdraw, you're also basically l two user that wants to do this faster or slower depending basically how much are willing to pay. But you never should touch l one, you never should bridge and those kind of things because issues happen there. We need to make basically these things abstracted.
00:10:26.434 - 00:10:49.974, Speaker A: And one of the beauties of starknet is account abstraction. So you know, like we can do wonders with this, like you know like multiples and stuff. So you can do whatever. So let's say you want to like stake with Lido but you don't have it. You have stables, you can do like multicols here, like swap with Avenue and then deposit to in Bora Vault. And then we aggregate all those things and you can do multiple of these things. And that's the beauty of the whole thing.
00:10:49.974 - 00:10:54.434, Speaker A: So that's why we are building on Stark. And one of the reasons basically it's really good.
00:10:56.654 - 00:11:18.264, Speaker B: It makes a lot of sense. And so I mean we discussed basically your motivation historically to transdarknet. My question now is like on term of l two network infrastructure, what makes you stay, what made you choose darknet over another environment or even deploy on cross layer as many does?
00:11:19.444 - 00:11:46.418, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I mean one of the things is community. So like one of the key things you can never buy where you can never like, you know like artificially create is obviously the community. When you have a strong community on the ecosystem, people that are building this like it's one of the key ingredients. And I always joke that Cairo is a feature and a bug because like it's harder to get started. But once you get started you can just easily go and deploy somewhere else. You have to build on top of this.
00:11:46.418 - 00:12:31.366, Speaker A: So that's why, one of the reasons we believe is because of the strong community products building on top and so on is that basically starting is going to be here and it's going to thrive in like two, three, five years, ten years and so on. And obviously like this is a long like long term like architecture, you know like infrastructure that we are building that we also need on the, on the striking side because we go step back so we can do this kind of l one defi things and so on. But the key point would be integrating that locally to all too is because let's say you will stake it lite though, but you want to withdraw faster. You go to local Dex and basically like withdraw from there. Maybe you want to do some leverage on money markets. Maybe you can do it locally and so on. So Nibora can kind of like, you know, like use both layers to do this.
00:12:31.366 - 00:12:31.846, Speaker A: So.
00:12:31.870 - 00:13:05.682, Speaker B: Yeah, makes sense, makes sense, makes sense. And, and so just 1 second. And so, and so when it comes to Nimbira, the, this is currently the main project you guys are building as an app on Stocknet. My big question is what's the first go to market? What's the first product you're going to release or what did you release and what does it do? How can users use it? And I guess make money with it, of course.
00:13:05.828 - 00:13:45.860, Speaker A: So the idea is to target like we all have three tiers, like low risk strategies, medium strategies and high risk strategies. It's all about yield and getting basically assets on your like money. So the first basic ones we're going to like integrate a simple one like s dyes, like replace it and so on, some rest taking and those kind of things. So theoretically you can kind of get exposure to maybe ignore points plus some yield from like heat plus maybe some Nivora points, stark and so on. So like there is a bunch of basically stuff bundled and for the user it will be one click. They basically just come to the UI as we released in a couple of weeks. They choose which strategy to use and just deposit the asset and whatever else they have in the wallet.
00:13:45.860 - 00:14:01.396, Speaker A: We are figuring out the way to get it there. And that way basically they start passing learning on this. So you can kind of play like it's yearn but cross chains and so on. So you don't have, you have basically strategies that can be components of both sides. So you can think about it like that.
00:14:01.540 - 00:14:07.684, Speaker B: And so, and so how can someone, so right now, which is available and what can someone build on top of it?
00:14:08.384 - 00:14:42.094, Speaker A: I mean any yield generating strategy. So like technically you can build anything. But for example like with liquid integration, the issue is LUSD, you borrow doesn't bring you yield, doesn't bring you any additional income. And then the whole kind of who pays the l one gas by cost doesn't work. So what we did is we abstracted that, say okay, we are going to take ten profit fee, 10% profit fee on l two. You basically don't pay l one gas. So all the yield stuff that basically is out there like morpho finance like any Aave lending to Aave for example, or whatever, you can scale these things to start.
00:14:42.094 - 00:14:55.486, Speaker A: It can be seamless for users. So let's say you have some stables you want to get exposure to Aave on Mainnet. You can use it also to hit this and so on. So there can be a bunch of stuff like the possibilities are, let's say limitless on this kind of thing. So anything that generates deals.
00:14:55.550 - 00:15:01.474, Speaker B: Yeah, and so, and so do you already see people building using nu. Is it something that you hope for and.
00:15:01.954 - 00:15:24.322, Speaker A: Absolutely. We just basically see like the second strategy today. Like some like restating stuff like integration, basically. Like the guy be like, I'm amazed to be honest. I didn't expect this to be completely frank because we released the SDK like when? Three weeks ago or something like that. And people already started building that, that three teams basically different stuff. I'm like amazed to be honest.
00:15:24.418 - 00:15:25.534, Speaker B: That's amazing.
00:15:25.994 - 00:15:30.042, Speaker A: Yeah, that's amazing. What really, you know, I mean, you.
00:15:30.058 - 00:15:59.974, Speaker B: Know, that's it starting with three and end up being a doubt people. I've been there. I don't. That makes a lot of sense. And so, and so what would you wish for people to be building? What do you expect people like, what is the next thing that is going to be exciting for you builders? If there is builder in the assembly right now, what kind of cool idea, what kind of value can you give them to build?
00:16:00.934 - 00:16:29.914, Speaker A: Absolutely. So like one of the key points we want to iterate on is like as I mentioned, like strategies on both sides. So let's say you have SDai, so you have spark on mainnet you want, you have some like stables you want to basically help spark. You get 5% on that. But then you have SdaI which you can maybe Lp to some like, like Dex on the, let's say kubo or my swap or whatever. You can possibly lp there so you can get additional things and then people build legos atop. And the whole idea for us is to expose this.
00:16:29.914 - 00:16:54.050, Speaker A: So if you're a Cairo dev, you can easily build whatever l two strategy you want. If you're kind of solid dev, you don't even need to know. Basically Cairo, you can build strategies on top also that leverage target as an engine to scale, which is even more amazing because Cairo is like so good for building all the stuff on the starknet side. But even if you don't know it in short term, you can still build stuff for the starknet users now using.
00:16:54.122 - 00:17:16.734, Speaker B: Solidity thanks to nimbus. That's a very quick site and so, and so any sort of. So I just could mean, I've been to the Nbura website right now. I only saw liquidity. Is there other strategy coming up? Like what should we expect and are we expecting integration within the wallet? Like how do you see the future coming up?
00:17:17.114 - 00:17:56.106, Speaker A: Absolutely. So the first basically like iteration will be like integrating like Lido's, SDais and so on, restaking products, you know, those kind of like some indexes and so on. We are discussing about those things also like getting some large possession from Mainet and so on. So that would be like the first step. And then obviously natively integrating this into devs because we believe, okay, well, Nimbara will have its front end. You know, you can use it from there, but it's ultimately an engine and SDK that anybody can build on top, can build on all front ends and basically can integrate into their own dapps. So what we believe will happen down the road is we're kind of building an engine to creating cross chain strategies and people will leverage this to build stuff on top and so on.
00:17:56.106 - 00:18:08.294, Speaker A: We already seeing that crazy ideas. We didn't even think about that people basically are building on top. But like with a simpler kind of first step would be like this simpler strategy that you will get exposure to and so on.
00:18:09.314 - 00:18:15.854, Speaker B: Amazing. And so, and so we discussed partnership on there too. But you also see partnership with their own project.
00:18:16.614 - 00:19:06.458, Speaker A: Absolutely. So like l one is part of a strategy. So l one project scaling to start because they want to come to start net, but it's harder sometimes to build Cairo stuff to, you know, to like do all these things which they don't have a domain knowledge. We are offering them basically this to scale those l one protocols to start directly. And then obviously we want native integrations on Star Trek with Dexs lending, boring markets, you know, money markets, wallets and so on to have this natively because you know some stuff is happening, you know, like some new like amazing thing is happening and so on, both on Ethereum side and Stark side. And I feel like Stark is finally maturing to full production version, you know, like quote unquote, some people mention token and so on and that will open a lot of possibilities and so on. So like, you know, some call it money time, I call it production time because you know that will enable a lot of stuff.
00:19:06.506 - 00:19:48.364, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I mean that's, that's many times I've been the word on the mouth of a lot of people lately. That's quite true. There have been like a couple of memes that have been surrounding starknet, the list line, build different, build different. The more tps that the various emojis, what sort of strike you out, the more culturally significant one, what do you think the most expressive? What do you think about the stocknet culture as a community and how do you see it grow in the future?
00:19:49.464 - 00:20:22.062, Speaker A: To be honest, it reminds me of Ethereum one back in the day when I joined Ethereum foundation. Basically it was like it was a wasteland like the bear market after 2017 and so on. There wasn't a lot of builders out there and there wasn't a lot of products building on top. And the same ethos are focused on building, focus on long term and enough caring about short term profits, scamming people and so on. But I won't name names like some other. Basically, there are some other egg systems that kind of have more of this. We have a lot of builders that are focused here on building long term, which is good.
00:20:22.062 - 00:21:06.762, Speaker A: And I kind of feel now like we are entering from this developer phase. Everything is built for developers, by developers and so on. We're kind of maturing fast into this amazing ecosystem that will kind of power a lot of stuff. You know, when you think about it, obviously Starcare as a company is kind of, you know, like people in it and co founders event help these things and kind of let the space forward and so on. And it's important that like, this builder culture is something that we enshrine and have, have for the future and, you know, like push forward and so on. And that's what's kind of driving us also here because like, okay, Star Treknet is the best technically. Like at this point, maybe in the future, all the zkvms or whatever will come to the same level, blah, blah.
00:21:06.762 - 00:21:18.490, Speaker A: I don't know. But you can kind of get this same feeling of builders, a lot of like support that you get around and so on. It's like, it's just built differently and that's basically so.
00:21:18.642 - 00:21:21.098, Speaker B: So you prefer build differently than.
00:21:21.226 - 00:21:27.334, Speaker A: Absolutely. All of those are good. More TPS, daddy, like, was always the best.
00:21:30.124 - 00:22:13.104, Speaker B: Yeah, that's for you guys. That was good time. It was good time. And so, and so, like, so, you know, so as an ecosystem that we say we're growing, we keep growing all the time. Right? And my question to you is, like, what kind of alpha do you have for builders out there? What kind of, and for the user? So it's two part, like, what, what sort of, like would you say to newcomers that wants to build doesn't know where to go, doesn't even necessarily fee wants to be a good app, make money, make a good product, make a good company, or for the user, what they should explore, what they should have fun with, where can they also find the best opportunity, both economically for them and in terms of experience?
00:22:14.124 - 00:22:31.084, Speaker A: Absolutely. So, like, we, like, obviously, discord. Discord. Discord is always the best answer to all those questions because our team is on Discord and we invite you all guys to join the discord and so on. So, like, we recently just opened it. So, you know, like, if you. If you join now, you're still early and.
00:22:31.084 - 00:23:14.144, Speaker A: Yeah, like, for the. Basically, the idea behind the strategies for people building on top is that in the future, Nibora will have its point system where basically part of our fees for the strategies and profit will be shared with them. So if you build a strategy on top, if you build the stuff on top, it will be basically shared between you and the Nibora as a protocol. And for the end user is basically like a bunch of frontends that will arise from this because, like, we already have builders which are building their own front end show this, you know, like, using basically directly, or you can come to Nimbora website, which is Nimbora IO, and in like two to three weeks, use all this certain kind of stuff. So it will be live soon. So, you know, like, brace with us for like two, three more weeks until we polish all the stuff and then we'll move to production.
00:23:14.724 - 00:23:25.904, Speaker B: Okay. And so. And for the user, what kind of, what can they already try? And do they have good yield? And do they have, you know, a way to sort of be an early participant of Nimbura?
00:23:26.364 - 00:23:46.668, Speaker A: Absolutely. So, like, the best is to come to join the discord and then you will give you access to some of the alpha basic version of it. You need some referral key and so on to join and so you can use it. So that's, that's basically best way to come. And then we'll progressively open it and so on. So, like, the best place, again, is to come to discord. And then you will get, you know, some, like, early access.
00:23:46.668 - 00:24:23.576, Speaker A: Like, yield obviously is going to be really interesting because we combine both l one yield plus the l two yield, which is in my, like, my, like, opinion, perfect home. So, like, we get best of both worlds. So, yeah, pretty soon, I believe there will be a lot of demand and people, like, a lot of users will use this, but for them, in the end, it's like, it's just one click. They won't need to understand all the complexity of logic. Like all this stuff is happening in background because I believe that's how we should build stuff usually like builders built for other builders. So it's like more complex. But yeah, products are like intended to be easy to use for normal people.
00:24:23.576 - 00:24:25.884, Speaker A: That's kind of like, like my motivating.
00:24:27.384 - 00:24:46.404, Speaker B: Okay, so that makes a lot of sense. And so, so, and so how do you see the future of scaling onwards? What's going to get you excited? What is like the next generation of stuff that we love that will? And what can you see the future then?
00:24:47.604 - 00:25:20.658, Speaker A: So one of the most interesting for starting in general, you will have hundreds and hundreds of rollups and then you have fracture liquidity. You will have a lot of change that you need to use on your wallet. You have all this stuff that you need to change and it's like we are basically breaking the user experience a lot. So it's not really a great user experience. And on stack with I expect a lot of l two s, l three s and so on to happen. But we need to abstract this from the users again. So like I'm all basically how can we build this cross chain functionalities that users don't need to know? Basically all those things.
00:25:20.658 - 00:25:57.094, Speaker A: Maybe wallet aggregation stuff, maybe, you know, this like strategies that move across stocknet roll ups or options and whatever. And maybe even Nimbora will have its roll up in the future. We don't know. Everything is a possibility. So that's all the ideas. But in the end, kind of the North Star is any basically chain you run, any wallet that you use, it's one click for you so you don't have to care about all this bridging complexity and stuff as you know, that's quite of, it's like a big goal, but I believe, you know, nothing, nothing except like huge goals and big goals is there to do. And that's one of the biggest.
00:25:57.754 - 00:26:04.778, Speaker B: And so what do you expect? What do you expect the Nimbura chain to look like? What's the end goal there?
00:26:04.826 - 00:26:49.434, Speaker A: Like, so yeah, yeah. Madara maybe like the whole thing for the user like is we need cheaper transaction cost and we basically needs, you know, like seamless experience and so on. So one of the ways to achieve that is go layer down or go layer up, whatever you call that, l three s and so on or using external DA is like, you know, like Celestia Avail and so on. So that's actually active area exploration. But still, even if you go that route, I still believe that having access to public, public start and mainnet and so on shouldn't be dampered by that. Because if we create this like, like friction where you have to bridge if you want to get this strategy or you have to bridge there if you want to get another strategy, it won't work. And that's why defi pooling.
00:26:49.434 - 00:27:17.464, Speaker A: And this pooling with faults is a key point there. So we can kind of abstract that from the users. But yeah, I definitely believe that, you know, some of the stuff on the starkness side, both Madara and custom startnets or like this volition mode and stuff will improve user experience a lot because we'll kind of, you know, be, be the first ones to use. So imagine, so imagine, I would say imagine like did you miss maybe revolut or did you use some neo bank or earn program? You're probably just like a legion like me. So you just stay punching.
00:27:17.504 - 00:27:19.964, Speaker B: But yeah, exactly, exactly.
00:27:20.784 - 00:27:46.092, Speaker A: But basically they're like for example with like this neo bank. So what usually happens when you buy crypto is they are custodian of yours and it's like, you know, oh, you have crypto but you don't. But it's easy because it's an app, so you won't click. So imagine that. But it's self custodial, it's on chain gas is abstracted from you and you kind of passively earn from this. And the basically wallet is saved on your phone and so on. And when you think about it, we are not that far from it.
00:27:46.092 - 00:28:06.180, Speaker A: We are basically can build this on the striking stack, potentially not today, but in a couple of months, a year and so on. So I believe this kind of user experience can like bring us to the mass market. Obviously one roll up won't scale enough for all the users in demand. But you know, that's why fractal scaling maybe is a solution for this.
00:28:06.372 - 00:28:21.264, Speaker B: Awesome. That makes a lot of sense. And so another dimension that is quite interesting in the context of NVRA is bridging. And so I'm curious, what's your thoughts on cross layer bridging and how we would go.
00:28:22.464 - 00:28:53.300, Speaker A: It's a mess. It's a short answer. And yeah, because like the biggest issue with all those things is, okay, l one, l two communication. You have canonical bridges which kind of, okay, under, you know, roll up underneath kind of depends on the security of that bridge. So it's kind of one and the same with that. But let's say you want to do l two bridging, let's say from, I don't know, polygon to start or optimism to start. How do you do that? You have to trust third party bridges, liquidity bridges to kind of bridge from one side to the other, which is not the best.
00:28:53.300 - 00:29:24.092, Speaker A: And then basically there is a whole area of exploration now where, how do you do this? Like, there is like this proof aggregation networks, potentially that can happen that, you know, you have, in my opinion, what will happen is you will have liquidity on its origin. So let's say eat is issued on Mainnet. I don't know, like Stark is issued on Starknet and so on. And you won't bridge it to the other side. You will just prove you have it on that chain. You will lock it in the vault or something so you can kind of move it from there. And then you have all these kind of things, intents aggregated on some separate things.
00:29:24.092 - 00:29:41.020, Speaker A: Is it off chain? Is it like three or roll up or something? But like, stuff won't move on its own. And then you can kind of get this experience for like, it's kind of cross chain decks or whatever. I mean, you can build like a bunch of stuff there. But bridges in its core today, liquidity bridges are like cross chain dexs, let's be frank.
00:29:41.052 - 00:29:55.120, Speaker B: So, yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And so, in the context of bridging, which one is the most interesting? So, like stack or tools you've been looking at and, and cross layer?
00:29:55.232 - 00:30:35.452, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, you have like two kind of things. You have like storage proofs and those kind of things, which is kind of like a ZK focus proofs and so on. And you have like, you know, economic security ones, like eigenoler and so on. I believe, like the, the answer is somewhere in between, because, okay, like, I can learn those kind of things. You have security guarantees which kind of get can get you to the point. But maybe combining that with storage proofs for like ultimate finality could be a thing to do. Still, we didn't solve the liquidity bridging part of that because, okay, we can like transfer messages from one side to the other, but still, you know, how do we get this token? Let's say that this eid that is bridged to optimism is not the same need that is bridged to start.
00:30:35.452 - 00:31:15.728, Speaker A: And they have price discrepancies and so on. But we are basically exploring that. We're exploring like Chainlink, CCIP, maybe even CCTP from, from basically circle. There is a bunch of these things, I believe, like the, the aggregation layer, there would be really interesting because you have like polygon is building this kind of like aggregation layer for their own ZKVM chains and then maybe starting hole build that optimism is building this separate cluster is also the arbitrary who does the connections in between? Do we do it only across layer one? Maybe. And that's basically the part we are doing now. So l one, l two communication, all economical bridges. And then basically we'll handle the rest maybe in the future.
00:31:15.728 - 00:31:30.364, Speaker A: So you can kind of use, let's say you deposit on polygon, we bridge kind of this deposit to Starknet and then settle it via stark and so on. Because it like at one point we have to aggregate to like layer three or Starknet or somewhere. So we have to settle this somewhere.
00:31:31.064 - 00:31:45.484, Speaker B: Makes a lot of sense and so on. The context of existing team, did you talk, you know, to, I mean, the warm hole, et cetera, layer zero of the world? Like what do you think of them? How do you see them if they competition partners?
00:31:46.664 - 00:32:07.294, Speaker A: I mean, they're partners because like we are basically doing l one, l two communication. We are building strategies on top. So we are not a bridge project per se, but obviously we have a bridging infrastructure and so on. Under the hood. We're using Stargate at this point for starting communication to l one to l two. And then down the road we'll have to partner with some of those projects. So like we are like talking with all of them.
00:32:07.294 - 00:32:33.454, Speaker A: But the issue with the, as you know, like there are multiple parties, they have all token standards for bridging and so on. So you have ended lock ins there. You know, it's all flavors of gray. There is no one silver, like one gold solution that works for everybody. So, you know, we'll see how it goes. But yeah, that's definitely active ever exploration. So like we are focusing towards stocknet and ethereum scaling that and they will figure out the rest down the road.
00:32:33.914 - 00:33:02.046, Speaker B: And so in some of. So there is one aspect that we haven't touched so far, which is, you know, as opposed to many solution. There is a high concept, oh, you know, of what blockchain tends to, which is synchronicity and embryo is very much into asynchronous messaging. How do you see this? What do you see? What do you like what's going on there? What can we expect there? Sure.
00:33:02.070 - 00:33:29.528, Speaker A: So like, as I mentioned, like Internet is also synchronous. All the stuff that is happening kind of in normal world, non web3 world is also asynchronous. So we can either go to in the terms of like blockchains. Or you can go to Solana and just build everything there, which kind of can scale to a point, but can scale ultimately. Or we can have like Ethereum roadmap, which is scaling with back in the day with charting, now with rollups. If you ask me, it's a flavor of the same thing. It's a different technology.
00:33:29.528 - 00:34:01.588, Speaker A: But we will basically again come to sharding at one point. But the point with the asynchronousity is you have to embrace it. The whole thing is you have to handle it in the background. For the user, though, it shouldn't be exposed and users shouldn't be exposed to it as much as possible because users are used to getting seamless experience. Let me go. Step back even to like, let's say how Robin Hood works. Like when you want to trade something or Robin Hood or whatever, you feel it's like synchronous, but you actually don't have the.
00:34:01.588 - 00:34:05.964, Speaker A: You're kind of like creating the derivative there. Yeah, I'm going too far now, but.
00:34:06.004 - 00:34:18.184, Speaker B: Yeah, no, no, no, absolutely not. That's a very super interesting. I just read, I just read a question that I found interesting or talking about, which is beacon scaling with Cairo. I get happily discussing that first.
00:34:20.664 - 00:34:36.040, Speaker A: Actually, when you think about the design of Nimbora is similar to how beacon chain communicates, let's say lido, how basically deposits and staking and unstaking work. It's quite similar to that. So we already have a synchronicity within Ethereum, but people like users are not exposed to that.
00:34:36.192 - 00:35:00.634, Speaker B: Yeah, makes a lot of sense. And so, okay, so now we touch a lot of ingredients, we touch a lot of petrolabs in context of maybe more macro or more global industry. What sort of application do you see blowing under the new upcoming bull market that will reach us one day if the God of bulls wants to wake up?
00:35:01.574 - 00:35:35.238, Speaker A: Promise of a bear market. A bull market, yeah, exactly. So one of the main things is this ultimate scalability of ZK. I believe, or at least I'm optimistic that this will market. We can actually achieve the scale of ZK rollups that are bigger than the existing optimistic and everything else. And we have that, we have rails like AWS. Was exploration basically for the Internet, for the cloud computing back in the day, because you have this seamless expansion and on demand scale, which is crucial because with blockchains at this point, we didn't have on demand scale.
00:35:35.238 - 00:36:13.300, Speaker A: And then Bora comes as a part where you tap back all this layer and make it feel like it's synchronous communication and you abstract all these complexities going from chain and so on. So that's kind of there. And then what we can build on top is a bunch of stuff like this. Infra will help you get normal users from web two that can use an account obstruction wallet like in their kind of apps without even having to know all this stuff. Because gas is kind of like a feature, but it's a bug for the end user because it changes what are the fees there and so on. You need pain masters, you need wallets that work on their own. You need all these things.
00:36:13.300 - 00:36:27.812, Speaker A: And starting is kind of promising that. And when you have like multiple start networks that are connected via nymbora or otherwise, well, you will have a lot of potential applications that work across shards. And I like to call them, but yeah, they're like close roll ups about kind of shards.
00:36:27.868 - 00:37:07.476, Speaker B: So, yeah, so, I mean, I just want to start touching a couple of points. The question that I asked, which I found very interesting. So there is a journal directly. So I'm just going to enter them as they were ask and maybe we can continue with more questions for you. First of all, another question. But are ZK rollup readily any better than optimistic product? Consider the highest cost. So ASICT, if you go to l two fees right now, they can roll up and I have to give it to my dear colleagues as Zeke sync are now cheaper than object roll up, and they're going to be even much cheaper under 44.4.
00:37:07.476 - 00:37:36.454, Speaker B: So are they any better? The short answer is yes, yes, and yes. And I'm writing a whole thesis about something called progress servers. I'm going to make public to the word soon, which is that VK is going to finally make a lot of ideas that we've seen in the space of crypto for a long time. Revive them in a way that would make finally successful. So, yes, they are much better. And to a point which is not even negotiable. Okay, so now there is another question, which was about bitcoin and BVM.
00:37:36.454 - 00:37:55.004, Speaker B: So I happen to be a bit of a bitcoin fan. I have to say. I will. I do have proof. I do have proofs. That's my personal guilty pleasure. And if you can even find video of me in 2022 arguing that bitcoin makes a better l one for settling than Ethereum.
00:37:55.004 - 00:38:24.664, Speaker B: It was an Ethereum conference, and I have to admit it was not well received. But it was good this time. Scaling bitcoin through Cairo. There is an obviously a very short answer is yes. Yes, yes, yes. But I would say, by the way, it's even true only for Ethereum, for if you. Things like Kakawot is rocking right now to become a type two, then a type one vkvm and zero sync is here to basically make approval.
00:38:24.664 - 00:38:50.478, Speaker B: Bitcoin ready to production, which is almost ready there. BitVM is not a roll up, just to be clear. It's. How can I say that? It's a sort of better version of a state channel, which it's like, sort of like a fraud proof base. It's like. It's a fraud proof. It's a fraud proof.
00:38:50.478 - 00:39:08.074, Speaker B: It's an optimistic roll up. Sort of the reason why they ex case, just to simplify the model they're working on. But it's basically a lupus. It's not there yet. First of all, BVM is very exciting stuff. I mean, I'm going first. Bitvm is very.
00:39:08.074 - 00:39:36.606, Speaker B: It's a fraud pro mechanism. Citria, which is using BitVM, is a fraud proof. But. And so the reason, actually, the interesting thing about BitVM is that it sort of spun out from the work that zero sync did and that stock where MacArthur's finance and co developed. So the transfer bitcoin scaling through Caro is already happening. It's going care of zero sync. And I think there is a lot more to come in the direction in the near future.
00:39:36.606 - 00:40:18.534, Speaker B: So again, I'm very excited about this. So we can start to love questions. Is there any questions for my girlfriend Eddie here, which are not the ones, you know, I'm going to answer because they're very annoying and not like so, but, yeah. So what else can I say? I do have a couple of comments about our ide, sort of. I mean, I actually made a comment about the others here and involved with community, because Eddie has been involved in the community for a very long time, and the person who is in charge of endura is someone who was also in the community and got basically hired or a recruit by Eddie.
00:40:19.154 - 00:40:34.710, Speaker A: He joined the team. No, no, he joined the team. When we build stuff I don't believe in, there is a boss, and they're leaders and followers. Like, we're building it together. So that's kind of the key point and difference here. So just want to clarify that.
00:40:34.742 - 00:41:03.644, Speaker B: So, yeah, so, you know, it's like, very cool when I see all those people who have been in this space for, like, so long. And so we finally ended up working together and building companies together. And so on this is very exciting stuff. And I kind of got, I find extremely fascinating to see all those guys and what Eddie and Sacha has been doing in bureau. So I want to congratulate them for their work and maybe ask questions for me.
00:41:05.064 - 00:41:33.594, Speaker A: I mean, like, it's really interesting. As you mentioned, bitcoin, that's one of the Pandora box that is going to be huge, especially if this tech starts to work where you can scale kind of bitcoin. So imagine now, like using stark to scale bitcoin or like zero sync. So to maybe even scale bitcoin at one point. So you can do with Cairo much, much more than you can do on any KVM. So maybe that's also like one of the things, you know, what we could build in the future. I don't know, that's like a long, long way there.
00:41:33.594 - 00:41:55.374, Speaker A: But, you know, like, that's why I like this existence. It's like, it's a bit different. It's not like, oh, we have an EVM, we have to be compatible with that because blah, blah, blah, that's the mainstream. But let's experiment. Let's build new things. Like, it wasn't built overnight and it wasn't built like, oh, yeah, we have this clear roadmap we are going to do. Back in the day, actually, when I was starting, like, I started playing with hyper leisure fabric.
00:41:55.374 - 00:41:57.022, Speaker A: I don't know if you remember hyper.
00:41:57.078 - 00:42:00.446, Speaker B: Oh, I remember. Wait, I remember that time.
00:42:00.470 - 00:42:11.974, Speaker A: That was a mess. That was a mess. Yeah. That's funny when I think about it. Now, imagine if those kind of things succeeded. Enterprise, change and so on. They didn't, but because like Ethereum, like was this kind of new thing.
00:42:11.974 - 00:42:21.294, Speaker A: They're trying to explore new things and, you know, was focused on ideals and trying to like, you know, focus on long terms in the short. That's why I like star query also. And start as a mechanism.
00:42:22.994 - 00:42:53.384, Speaker B: Awesome. Great. So that makes so much fun. I mean, I would just say to the users here, to the user here, who wants to. There is a good question from Ezra before we end up finishing the conversation, but the scaling versus scaling through starknet versus Solana. So, I mean, Solana. So people don't really.
00:42:53.384 - 00:43:00.524, Speaker B: This is a very good question because people don't really understand what scaling means. And I love to talk about this. It's one of my favorite.
00:43:01.424 - 00:43:09.792, Speaker A: Exactly. I mean, we can run it on Aws. Why even use the blockchain? It scales. You know, like you can like spin out as many machines as you want. So.
00:43:09.848 - 00:43:40.534, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. So this is what I really find funny, because people talk about scaling, but they kind of miss the point. Which is so because, for instance, when you compare the TPS of, let's say, Solana versus e versus bitcoin, I mean, you're comparing a nap and norwegian Ferrari. I would say that sentence. I would say that because it's basically not the same thing at all. Bitcoin target machine is a raspberry PI. Ethereum is basically my MacBook Pro 2021.
00:43:40.534 - 00:44:12.664, Speaker B: And so that is a $2,000 machine per month. I mean, oh, and this is the machine they want to use. So the second you still using stronger hardware, of course you can go faster. But it's kind of funny to me that people sort of compare them out of the box and people don't understand that. You know, if you're a key Nigeria, then you're not going to have a MacBook 2021 because it's out of your scale. But if you are a company, if you're, and if, even if you're a rich kid from, from say, the US, even renting a $2,000 machine per month is expensive. So we're really not talking about the same thing.
00:44:12.664 - 00:45:00.030, Speaker B: And where ZK comes to play and solve this is because it allows you to verify what someone did on a data center and verify it on your phone. This is where the scale comes from. So Solana approach to scale. And so this is just a verification from. But what Solana is actually optimizing for execution and anything that solid other customers could do, we actually don't take that path because we think that the way solar scale is access list, it's a very annoying process for dev to write using it and for the front end. And we prefer to make it easy for dev to build while remaining, optimizing also for parallelization, other things. So thread is great tooling, but it's kind of leaky interstruction.
00:45:00.030 - 00:45:17.204, Speaker B: To load the scale, we try to take another approach which will not be as leaky. So we should get to 1000 tps by probably end of year, if. I hope so. I wouldn't touch wood. I mean, I touch wood, but I wouldn't commit to it. But if we go to 1000 tps, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised.
00:45:18.424 - 00:45:36.246, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And one of the key points is trust. With ZK, it's trustless. That's kind of the way when you kind of generate spruce and stuff, like it's completely different then, you know, Solana, okay, you trust these guys who are running bit machines, you know, it's fine. There is kind of a consensus. You cannot have it. But, you know, still, you know, the network goes down and stuff.
00:45:36.246 - 00:45:39.438, Speaker A: It's fine. You know, it's early, but, yeah, I.
00:45:39.446 - 00:45:55.320, Speaker B: Mean, by the way, there is someone saying I took a hit on the jerry. Actually not. I'm not taking a hit on Nigeria. I'm actually referring to one special guy in the ecosystem that is. I mean, I won't name who he is. He wouldn't recognize himself, who learned to code on paper because he could have access a computer. And so.
00:45:55.320 - 00:46:29.776, Speaker B: And the first line of code they ever wrote was on the. On a five inch phone. So it has nothing to do with me saying that Nigeria doesn't have access to computers. I just mean that as a key. Nigeria, you have, of course, less likelihood of accessing the machine that you require to run Solana. I had myself the angry thing of being a rich kid from France. I don't have the capacity to buy Solana to buy a computer in Solana.
00:46:29.776 - 00:47:03.014, Speaker B: It's a joke. It's making a joke, but you know what I'm saying. And so there's one question before we finish, that is, have you fired the eBay? Your intern who actually promoted it, became the end of ecosystem now, and he's doing very well. I know, I know, I know, I know. I know about the joke. But I wonder the reason why I always think about Nigeria when I think this example is because it's because of this guy. I won't name him because I know if he wants me to name you.
00:47:03.014 - 00:47:15.640, Speaker B: So name him. But he's a very well known figure in the stock ecosystem. And he literally told me that he learned to quit on paper at 15. And I was like, what the fuck, dude? That's how cool. Imagine that will.
00:47:15.712 - 00:47:22.160, Speaker A: Exactly. He will, like, achieve much more people. Like, oh, like, my laptop is, like, from 2031. You know, like, I need a new one.
00:47:22.352 - 00:47:47.492, Speaker B: Right? I mean, that's the difference. And so this is like, I actually want nigerian person in mind when I see a sentence. But to go back and to go back as you go. Said, like, you know, to the guy who asked me if the beggar intern got fired. No, I got promoted. He's now in charge of all the ebakers, and now he's in charge of exploration and ecosystem team. So that's very exciting.
00:47:47.492 - 00:48:12.514, Speaker B: He actually took my, took over my role, and I moved the word towards you. See, I bring my point. You bring my point. That's it. I think we covered it as other things to do is either the question in chit chat. Otherwise, I think we're going to close. And I want to thank you, everyone for joining and asking those fun questions and all the ridiculous.
