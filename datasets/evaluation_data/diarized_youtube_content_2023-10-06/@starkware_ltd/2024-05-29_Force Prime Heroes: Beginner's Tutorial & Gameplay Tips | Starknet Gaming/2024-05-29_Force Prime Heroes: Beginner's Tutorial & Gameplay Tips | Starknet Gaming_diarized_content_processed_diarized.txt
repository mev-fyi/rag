00:00:00.520 - 00:00:29.358, Speaker A: Good morning. Welcome back. It has been a while. I hope you're doing well and enjoying life and touching lots of grass. And let's check out force prime heroes. Force Prime Heroes is an on chain game that's inspired by the series heroes of might and magic. For those of you who are familiar with it.
00:00:29.358 - 00:00:55.210, Speaker A: And the cool thing about it is that it's very easy to start playing. You don't even necessarily need a wallet, but it still contains a lot of strategic depth. So in other words, it's easy to get started but tough to master. Now, let's check out some of the objectives. You need to explore the map with your hero, this little dude here. And you need to grow your army, defeat enemies, and kill the bone dragon to win the map scenario. Some general tips to succeed to reduce your casualties.
00:00:55.210 - 00:01:29.672, Speaker A: Have a bigger army, higher ranged units to avoid casualties in battles against weak enemies, and don't attack enemies that are too strong. Let's check out some definitions. Days and weeks represent the number of turns you take, so let me quickly elaborate. Every day you get 200 movement points, and moving one square costs ten points. The day automatically restarts as soon as you run out of movement points. You can, however, manually restart the day by just pressing next day. With the start of a new day, your movement points are restored and you get your base income of 100 plus income for all your own properties.
00:01:29.672 - 00:02:06.112, Speaker A: With the start of a new week, new units will also appear in your buildings. Now, let's look at the units. There are two types. Melee, which, I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing it wrong, which is close combat and ranged, for example, archery, and fun fact. While I was doing research for this game, I learned that the prussian army developed a genre of wargaming in the 19th century to teach battlefield tactics to officers. And these games contained rules for a hand fight or close combat, which were also referred to as melee. Anyways, check out the force prime git book to get more information on the units, their attack and health points.
00:02:06.112 - 00:02:41.914, Speaker A: And the same goes for the enemy units, which are, for example, young ents, skeleton mages, genies, and so on. As I mentioned before, the bone dragon is the final boss, and you have to defeat him or her, I don't know, in order to win the map. Now, if you want to nerd out about the combat system, check out the git book as well. I myself prefer to f around and find out which is exactly what we will be doing now. Okay, so head on over to Forceprime IO, and then you can either connect your wallet or don't. And then you'll get to this page. So you'll see the different season maps that are currently running.
00:02:41.914 - 00:03:07.144, Speaker A: You'll have a leaderboard, how to play, just a quick overview and more details here in the kitbook that I mentioned, your profile. And that's pretty much it. There's a tutorial here that you can play, which is really good. I suggest you do that because it just kind of gives you a feel for how everything works. And then, yeah, there's lots of different maps that you can choose from. Some of them are even part of a tournament. And we're just going to go ahead and check out map number two.
00:03:07.144 - 00:03:42.182, Speaker A: Okay, so here's the map. You can see your different enemies, how much power you need to defeat them, and places where you can hire units, and ultimately the bone dragon. So we need 4000 power to defeat this guy. And as you can see, see, we're nowhere close. So we're gonna have to do some stuff before we go there. I don't have a strategy. I'm just gonna go for it.
00:03:42.182 - 00:04:16.434, Speaker A: Might make it, might not. We'll see. So first things first. I go and collect all the gold. And I am aware I'm probably not using my movement points very wisely, but it is what it is. Then these altars, I don't know, they let you level up on defense or attacks. So we're gonna go there, here, one that gives you attacks.
00:04:16.434 - 00:04:39.470, Speaker A: And then here you can capture these towers to higher units, which is always good. We want big armies. We're gonna go all in and hire these guys. And then here you can see our melee and ranged. So what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna attack these two because they're pretty weak. And here you can see 167. So easy.
00:04:39.470 - 00:05:13.154, Speaker A: Peacey. Now, as I mentioned in the beginning, it's better to have a bigger army to reduce casualties, which is exactly what I'm working toward, trying to capture as many as I possibly can. Higher. So now we have all kinds. We probably need a bit more ranged, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. Okay? Not going there. Here.
00:05:13.154 - 00:05:35.114, Speaker A: Let's go here. Obviously we gotta collect gold and then we're gonna go get some gimli's. He looks like Gimli here. See, he totally looks like Gimli. Max. Higher. Okay, so that's good.
00:05:35.114 - 00:05:52.202, Speaker A: We have a pretty cool army here. Oh, we're not gonna go there. Nope. We're not gonna go there either. Nope, nope, nope. There's an option. Let's see what kind of stuff do.
00:05:52.202 - 00:06:30.542, Speaker A: Oh, wait. Where am I? Where's my dude? Here. Okay. Yep. Okay, so this was just a quick speed run. I'm not done yet. It's gonna take me fucking ever.
00:06:30.542 - 00:06:52.794, Speaker A: But I hope you enjoyed it. I hope you understand kind of what the game looks like, and I hope you're interested in playing. It would be awesome if you would share your scores on Twitter so we can kind of see how you guys are doing. And, yeah, I hope to see you soon, and take care in the meantime. All right, bye.
