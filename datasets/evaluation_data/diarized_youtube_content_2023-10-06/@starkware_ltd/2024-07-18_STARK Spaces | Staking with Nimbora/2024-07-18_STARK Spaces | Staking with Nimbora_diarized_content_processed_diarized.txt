00:00:02.520 - 00:00:31.565, Speaker A: Okay. Hello everybody. Welcome to another episode of Stark Space. I'm a first timer at hosting this. I'm sure you'll forgive me. With us today is Eddie from the Spaceshells team, specifically talking to us about the Nimboa project and application. Eddie, maybe you can start with introducing yourself and what you do.
00:00:32.265 - 00:00:45.105, Speaker B: Sounds good. So yeah, thanks. I think you will be good. So you're good in these things. So you're fine. So yeah, just a short intro. I mean I was out space with Luis like last time so basically can do a short one.
00:00:45.105 - 00:01:13.105, Speaker B: I was a core dev in Ethereum foundation back in the day solidity and then three years ago decided to switch to start and to start building here. Basically got start filed and so on and on starknet we are building a bunch of stuff From DevNet to StarkNet JS and what's important basically in Umbora, which is the idea behind Inbora is quite simple to make savings account available to everybody. And with the starting tech we are aiming to do so.
00:01:14.125 - 00:01:33.255, Speaker A: Okay, amazing. Yeah. So indeed you are a very important member of the Starken ecosystem and community. I know that you just came back from etc. Said hello yeah in the meetings and what are your impressions from ATC and from the starting community, the Aqua House.
00:01:34.675 - 00:02:10.269, Speaker B: I mean it was quite interesting because like you know the bear Marketish like vibes are like all over but in like starting hacker house and in the in the inventive was quite positive. People looking forward and so on. That's why I like this ecosystem. You know it's like long term focus focused on like the things in the future and so on. So we don't need to be bothered with short term things like some others and so on. And there was a bunch of stuff from payments as one of the biggest things like native account obstruction and users coming to Stargate again obviously there is less FUD now which is good for everyone. I think the vibe is overall positive.
00:02:10.269 - 00:02:32.465, Speaker B: There's a lot of people in the hacker house, some interesting teams there. I was also a judge. It was quite interesting to hear some of the new like stuff. I'm really bullish on like new projects coming and obviously circumcision is always like a family gathering with new friends and family and you know, getting larger and so on. So it's a special feeling like feels like the Ethereum foundation back in the day to be honest. Like. Yeah.
00:02:33.525 - 00:02:55.487, Speaker A: Wow, great. Yeah, it's really amazing to go there and see everyone just focused on building and like mapping what's missing for Us very good feeling. So yeah, maybe you can give us high level view of Nimboa, what is it and specifically how it evolved since the last time you introduced it here.
00:02:55.671 - 00:03:35.819, Speaker B: Absolutely. Let's start with the problem. So like usually when you use Defi or like when you want to use it, you need the Ph.D. which means that you need to know what is doing this, what is doing that and so on and the whole kind of like the thing that Nivora wants to do to make it simple. So imagine the savings account you have on Revolut or some like Neo bank or like bank that you have usually. What's the issue with that? Well you deposit money into there and then something happens and they're custody and you're like assets and so on and you never know what will happen with it. We're seeing with FTX and with Celsius when you have custodians it's not really the great user experience especially when the market goes down so the assets can disappear or get locked and so on.
00:03:35.819 - 00:04:08.949, Speaker B: So imagine that we can bring this seamless interaction with Defi. You can kind of get the savings account fully unchained, fully decentralized, but still that the gas fees are negligible because one of the next frontiers in our opinion would be to enable Web2 kind of experience but fully decentralized and on chain. That's kind of what Nibora is trying to do. And for now the feedback is pretty good. So the users like it, it's simple. But one of the things we don't want to cross is like this custodian way of the things the others are doing. We want to be self custodial and so on.
00:04:08.949 - 00:04:51.977, Speaker B: And second is a deal for this because native account abstraction, amazing improvements in tech now just like when I heard about Stu and how big improvements are going to be all like 100 dex how again you managed to do it. So kudos to also the striker team for that. It's like really striking, has always been on the edge of the possible and that's why we are building on starknet and using starknet to scale this. And we want to build the Nibora as a fully decentralized savings account on chain and Starkins is the best comp for that. So that's it. And what we kind of changed from last time, obviously we had borrowing and so on. We introduced the Earn program so you can just deposit the assets and so on and you can kind of use them that way.
00:04:51.977 - 00:05:00.535, Speaker B: So you can passively earn using Nomura and there are some big announcements also in the future that we can discuss a bit later, the plans and so on.
00:05:01.035 - 00:05:27.945, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah, great. I think that as a like person from Stockport, it's really amazing to see all the projects develop with time and when starting capabilities grow, their capabilities grow very soon after that. So it's a nice, nice evolution game. So maybe you can like double click into what users can actually do on those saving account with nimble like is it just manage for them? Do they define strategies? How does it work?
00:05:28.285 - 00:05:47.109, Speaker B: Sure. So for now basically it's curated strategies because like for now we kind of create a strategy specifically for the users. So depending what you want to get exposure to. So like let's say I'm just a normal user. I would just want to have like DAI or USDC or usdt. I don't want to risk buying like, you know, risky assets. Well, you have, we have a strategy for that.
00:05:47.109 - 00:06:32.595, Speaker B: Obviously the simplest one and the lowest risk is the spike. You know, the DSR of Spark where you basically you invest there and you get kind of returns on that. And then on the more legion side or the more, you know, like riskier side, we have LRTs like you know, Etherfi and so on where you can invest and get additional points and stuff. But the whole kind of point is with one click from StarkNet all this is possible and you don't have to think about anything. So what happens under the hood is actually quite interesting because we, I think Louis or somebody from the Cyclone team also like invented defi pooling or at least kind of coined the term and went into that direction. But the idea is quite simple and quite amazing. You have L2 which is kind of behaving like a co processor of Ethereum, like Starknet, scaling Ethereum execution.
00:06:32.595 - 00:07:02.107, Speaker B: How On Starknet we have vaults, we aggregate user deposits. Let's say I want to invest into Spark, I have 10 like Dai, you want to invest into Spark, you have 100 and somebody else has like, I don't know, like 90. So we have 200. But there was also somebody who already did invest and wants to, you know, spend money on the holidays or whatever or his wife has for. I don't know, she needs to he. She needs to like buy some new shoes or something. So he wants to kind of take the money out.
00:07:02.107 - 00:07:59.777, Speaker B: We match that locally on startnet and then just the delta of that we shuttle through the Stargate on Mainnet, deposit into strategy and get basically, you know, like yield generating assets for the user. So user doesn't see bridges, doesn't see any complexity of starknet only thing you do is basically starknet Wallet and some assets on it and that's it. And in the future, ideally when we have better on ramps on Starknet it can be fully like Web2 based like because we can abstract gas fees, we can like you know, with Paymaster and so on, users can kind of have on their mobile phones this kind of experience which feels and looks like a web2 thing but it's actually fully decentralized. So that's kind of it. And then obviously in the future staking is one of the main things that's coming to strike is strike staking which I think is a great thing not just for earning money, obviously that's a kind of a side thing, but because the circuit is finally getting decentralized. So we're talking about this thing for like years now. Yeah, it needs to get decentralized and so on.
00:07:59.777 - 00:08:29.373, Speaker B: And now finally, basically it's becoming a reality and this will make it fully, fully kind of like production ready in my opinion. Because now when Stark Query is not the ones only running sequencers and provers but you actually have the community participating and doing this, it's basically resistant to censorship and everything else. So we can actually truly scale this to the global like level and with stew and other stuff, maybe even to the masses maybe like the mass adoption is around the corner. So you know, I'm bullish on that.
00:08:29.429 - 00:09:13.875, Speaker A: So yeah, yeah, definitely feels like the adoption is growing in the entire ecosystem and not only starknet which is very positive. And yeah, we'll touch stacking and sync in very details a bit later. But yeah, I just love to see like get your perspective. Obviously Nimboa sounds like a very good strategy for people that are like new to the DEFI ecosystem. Right. I don't want to have a lot of obstacles. So what's your take on this? What measures have you taken to make it UX friendly and not frightening and reduce those barriers for non web 3 people?
00:09:14.575 - 00:09:54.123, Speaker B: I mean it's quite simple when you think about what you as a user want, you want basically you have some assets and you want to earn maximum money on it. But maybe you're not comfortable with high risk. Maybe you want a lower risk thing or something. That's basically what Nivora does, it curates. Okay, this strategy is low risk, it gives you a bit less return but you know, it's less risky and this one basically gives you higher and so on. There are complex strategies in the background, you know, like things like looping, like you know, going to main net, harvesting rewards and so on. But users are abstracted from all of those things because, you know, if you already know how to do those things, you're probably, you know, arbitrage, you know, like arbitrage or something.
00:09:54.123 - 00:10:17.775, Speaker B: You're advanced user so you don't need that. And with Nimbora all those kind of things are abstracted but still their own chain. So you can kind of verify them and so on and see where the assets are and that you can kind of validate them. But yeah, like again like Stripend is the home because of the scale of the tech and the maturity of it. So you know, NZK obviously is the future. So no op rollups on this thing on this side.
00:10:21.155 - 00:10:35.175, Speaker A: Yeah, so I'd love if you can add and expand a bit more. Like I saw recently that you launched the S Stark vaults. Can you expand a bit more on what is it and why? It's exciting.
00:10:35.635 - 00:11:23.745, Speaker B: Sure. So when you think about like savings die, why is it so magical? Because you don't really know what's going on under the hood. Like you don't know which specific strategy each die goes to. But you know, on average you get these returns and you know, on average, basically this is how you earn money. The idea with Stark is for the users who want to hold Stark, who believe basically Stark will be a big thing that we believe basically that will go long term, will be sustainable and so on, is that we can optimize multiple strategy for you that you don't have to think about. So there are a couple of phases. Obviously this is a genesis phase where we are attracting the early users to join the savings obvious next step would be when staking comes that we optimize, you know, like that you get some LSD exposure to that.
00:11:23.745 - 00:12:15.631, Speaker B: So like you basically can automatically, when you participate in saving strikes, you automatically participate in staking. So you get basically base yield from there, which will go anywhere we'll see like in production but you know, we expect around 5, 6, maybe even like higher percent. And then on top of that what you can get, which is a differentiator from like other LSDs, you will get additional strategies that you can choose to opt in. So you have kind of like the levels, okay, I can just do LSD, that's fine. I get like 5% and I don't want risky stuff. Or you can also do looping where you can kind of leverage the position like a couple of times and then have higher like Rewards, let's say 10, 15% instead of 5 but it's basically higher risk. So we want to curate it for the users from those who are like really, really don't want to mess with their thing and just want to hold it and want to expose to that to the other side which is completely on the djen side, let's call it like that.
00:12:15.631 - 00:12:27.835, Speaker B: So we want to offer basically this kind of range of products that is actually basically saving start so you as a user can choose which risk profile you present and we automate basically everything for you.
00:12:28.535 - 00:12:33.231, Speaker A: Wow, very impressive. So that means when you think about.
00:12:33.263 - 00:13:01.195, Speaker B: It it's a UX thing, it's a convenience thing because you can also go stake, you can also go on lending market, on money market and do something but if it's automated then we track basically that your portfolio is not liquidated, that your portfolio is healthy, that you basically we manage this for you. It's kind of a convenience thing and users obviously like that. I mean I think we just crossed like 10 million TVL on strikeness or we are close to that. So it's been pretty good on that front.
00:13:02.095 - 00:13:04.439, Speaker A: 10 million on emborium not on stock.
00:13:04.487 - 00:13:11.167, Speaker B: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. Like 10 million on stack. Yeah would be a small number.
00:13:11.231 - 00:13:20.823, Speaker A: So yeah exciting special to pass. So if I understand correctly you'll allow people from Nimbua to actually participate in stock and staking, right?
00:13:20.999 - 00:13:50.677, Speaker B: Exactly. So like that's on the. And then you'll be able to choose basically which like we'll offer also basically like LSD on our side because like we built like in the past like other LSD protocols like on Polygon which is biggest basically on Polygon like before switching to start. So we know how to do these things at scale it was a couple hundred million dollar protocol. So we know what everything basically entangles and how much work there is. And then on the other side we want to also offer what yearn offers on top of that. So it has advanced strategy on top of it.
00:13:50.677 - 00:14:04.685, Speaker B: So it's basically again a convenience tool for somebody who is coming to starknet who wants to possibly manage basically position to just join the saving strike and choose basically their risk profile and then we optimize basically it for them.
00:14:05.145 - 00:14:26.615, Speaker A: And like can people expect this saving stock to be launched immediately after staking is a live right, because just full context of your staking will be live only 15 months and of like scam sites that allow you to do it already. So don't be fooled by this discussion it might take a few months. So stake S stock will be a live just Visit that's the plan.
00:14:26.785 - 00:14:51.507, Speaker B: So there are a couple of things. Basically we can already with start do strategies like you know, like on money markets we can do looping and those kind of things. So we can offer you leverage and then when staking comes we'll add that as a basically layer to it. So you can kind of use it also just like staking or you can use basically also the leverage on that and so on. So the phase, basically that's what we are calling this genesis. We are just using the stack directly. We are not using the stake stack or whatever.
00:14:51.507 - 00:15:05.625, Speaker B: Like LSD will be like bring down that staking and then in the future we'll switch the strategy to be underlying will be like stake sarc and then on top of all these things and so on. So you'll be able to choose basically what you want to do with.
00:15:06.045 - 00:15:22.783, Speaker A: Wow, very exciting. So this seems like very exciting plans for the next, I don't know, four to six months. But what are your long term vision plans for limbo? What do you plan to take this amazing idea look like it's going to.
00:15:22.799 - 00:16:13.753, Speaker B: Become Robin Hood of Web3 like fully self custodial Robinhood where you can kind of go and join Defi. But when you think about regulation like currently now regulation is not really prone to, you know, stable coins are kind of regulated. You have EU regulation Mikael, which is not regulating Defi. That's kind of the next big thing. And when you're talking even with institutional institutions and so on, they really are looking forward to DEFI because DEFI optimizes a lot of like CEFI issues and so on. So in couple of years when we reach the scale with a tech like circuit will reach a scale where gas fees can be abstracted, where you have like a really good like onboarding experience where kind of you have a web2 like mobile wallet abstraction on your phone, you'll be able to have a savings account like you know, for the whole world like easily like this. And then you know, fully abstracting, you know the gas fees and abstracting you on the chain.
00:16:13.753 - 00:16:51.255, Speaker B: And actually on the conference there was a couple of guys I wear Nimora kind of shirt like swag and some people like oh, great product. I was like okay, nice. Did you go yeah, my wife used it and she put some money on vechain is it? I was like okay, that's really interesting because if you don't even know the tech under the hood when we achieved something. Because if you abstract the, if you don't have to sell you Know like a cult. Oh, this is the best tech because X and Y. No, because users use it then we achieve what basically we aimed and that's what we want to do with this. So like that Nivora is this kind of a front end for Defi but still has to be convenient and user friendly.
00:16:52.355 - 00:17:20.398, Speaker A: Wow. Yeah, very impressive. I totally agree that our goal is to have people that are just agnostic to the fact that it's Darknet and I think we have great features that allow it. I have some questions I saved for the end around your look and perspective from the position of a stack builder on how things go. So if you want to say anything more about Nimbora, that's the chance before we change the subject.
00:17:20.486 - 00:18:30.013, Speaker B: Sure. So inviting basically everybody to join on Discord to kind of join us to test it and so on. The idea on the Nibora side is also decentralized the stack. So in a couple of months we'll switch to fully mainnet which will enable anybody to launch a strategy. So you as a developer on starknet we'll be able to launch the strategy easily and even if you know just solidity you'll be able to launch new integrations in just like 40 or 50 lines of code. So this way we are trying to, we'll try to create an ecosystem around it and then for the users obviously follow us, you know we have announcement like weekly or bi weekly like almost like every week now we're trying maybe we'll have a big break in the August because of the vacations but yeah, we'll continue shipping and stuff and give us your feedback, what you're missing, what you want to use and so on and then integrating all the sealed assets down the road into the Stark net, into the Dexes, into the money market. So instead of just having base assets like they are now like usdc, usdt Stark and Eat, which don't generate yield by design that we focus on the more generating yield size like stake Stark staking of eth, other yield generating stables.
00:18:30.013 - 00:19:00.601, Speaker B: So like by design Stark becomes a hub for scaling not Even just Ethereum L1 but also Bitcoin L1 because that's one of the magics that's going to happen in some time. Hopefully Coffee Cap gets merged relatively soon because striking will be in my opinion the best hub to scale both things and still make it really convenient and cheap and I don't know, I don't know what else anybody needs to join starting this. It's a no brainer basically to join and start Building. Wow.
00:19:00.633 - 00:19:06.073, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, yes. Like with every month that pass, I'm a bit more excited about that.
00:19:06.249 - 00:19:06.745, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:19:06.785 - 00:19:13.401, Speaker A: It's like, you know, it's not always have been like that. It's over the past four or five months. It's like that.
00:19:13.553 - 00:19:32.313, Speaker B: Yeah. Like, you know, there are always downtimes and upsides and so on. But we told this like it was amazing. Like first like bitcoin. Okay. We're going like, you know, circuitry is like scaling that way and then you know, the stew and I feel like every two months you reinvent your guys yourself and you like create something and magnificent. So you know, like it's, it's.
00:19:32.313 - 00:19:37.245, Speaker B: Maybe I'm a geek. I am. But you know, that's, that's what like makes me happy also.
00:19:38.465 - 00:20:26.077, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. I have one last question about like your perspective on the ecosystem. In the meantime, if you have any questions from homes that you'd like me to continue ask after, feel free to write them here. In the chat I see quite a few, but I'm not sure which ones we've answered already. So please repose the questions if you have them. You explained a lot on Emboar, but I want to ask you on the development process of it first, if I'm a developer first, as a very veteran member of our community, where do you suggest me to start and how can I get involved? Secondly, can you give maybe a few words on the work you had with the foundation and how much it supported you and maybe how much new developers can hopeful support.
00:20:26.077 - 00:20:42.461, Speaker A: And like over the last year the foundation extend from like 5, 7 people each to 30 and it started to do a whole lot more things. I just took it from the side of I wonder how do you feel it and how do you think newcomers to the ecosystem will feel it?
00:20:42.653 - 00:21:12.947, Speaker B: I mean there is so many opportunities from seed grants to like what. What amazes me to be honest is everybody's approachable. You can ping anybody and they answer. They're like really attentive, they try to help you and so on. And there's really a good process from like dev rails which help you on onboarding. Starting with, you know, we just like learning Cairo and getting first step in into the later, you know, like on the foundation side from the business support to growth. What do you need? What help? And that's what I like because there is no like, oh, I don't have time or I have to do this or that.
00:21:12.947 - 00:21:56.305, Speaker B: It's like so open and this is not normal thing. This doesn't happen everywhere. So this is the thing like I'm really, that's why I'm like, you know, pushing even with the hard times. There are like some market goes down, you know, token goes down, blah, blah, blah, whatever. But still like the amount of support we got, you know, from all the fronts, I mean, you know, even you or anybody basically in Starquare, you know, when we have some crazy idea we want to hack or something to break something new, you're always like, oh, let's see how we can help and support foundation. Then again, you know, from all the sorts of stuff and people care. That's, that's kind of the core important thing here because it's like for the long run, not focusing on the short term, you know, helping the builders to build and so on and start is really nascent still.
00:21:56.305 - 00:22:14.965, Speaker B: When you think about the blockchain it's like just now maturing, you know, with the block times, with the maturity of the devtools and so on. It's now finally maturing to be really production ready. End users are coming back so I don't know, just come and build things, just come and build next unicorns because this is the place to do so.
00:22:15.625 - 00:22:36.039, Speaker A: Yeah, totally. When looking on our developer community and it's so crowded and I was really excited by some of the StarkNet projects have their own events on etc. It was a very interesting development and those events I didn't manage to go there unfortunately but I heard very positive vibes from them.
00:22:36.087 - 00:23:15.625, Speaker B: I did on some. It was really good. It was really good. And that's the community. Usually what you have, I won't name names but let's say load this ZKE, VM, ZVMs or whatever L1, L2s like it's easy to pivot from one chain to the other and then what developers team do they deploy one chain, it doesn't work, deploy on the other and other And I always try to explain to people Cairo is a bug in a feature because once you decide to go in you get so much new improvements. Obviously there is a friction to get again, you need to learn it and so on. But you open another dimension of what you can do and that's kind of the difference between not just doing forex but we can innovate and so on.
00:23:15.625 - 00:23:56.585, Speaker B: I mean Nimbora is one of those things, you know, it hasn't been built anywhere else actually now we're just finally starting to see some others like, you know, like building something similar which is amazing because you know like we started, you know, something that's going to potentially be one of the standards in cross chain scaling and you know, doing, doing stuff across chains and so on. Like the whole ethereum like ecosystem is still nascent and starknet is there early. So you know, if you want to bet on something, Starnet is a good place to do so. So especially with all the community builders maturing, you know, now into their own products. I know I need to stop but you know, it's so exciting that you know, these things are like, you know, evolving so fast.
00:23:57.115 - 00:24:17.495, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, I get what you mean. Like because I think that until like 6 to 12 months ago we're in position where like every 3 months other things broke and we were still developing this technology and now it's like stable and ready and I see that people just moving forward without having to get back every two months and then it feels like getting the powers from it.
00:24:18.075 - 00:24:37.665, Speaker B: Exactly. But it's normal, you know, like the whole kind of problem like starting alpha and then moving. I think yeah, we enjoyed more than three years ago pre Mainnet. I remember everything was really rusty. But that's why you go through the phases. That's why I really believe now is the time to get into this and start building and scaling.
00:24:38.125 - 00:24:52.865, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. Very exciting to have this conversation with you. We have one question from the crowd since I gave my permission to ask questions. So that's what will Nimbura look like in five years?
00:24:54.325 - 00:25:39.095, Speaker B: So you won't even know that you're using Nibora, but it will be on every phone and it will be your savings account. So basically it will be behind every wallet, behind basically every, you know, wherever you are. Nobora basically will be your place you, you, you kind of earn with. But the idea is not that you have to know about Nimbora. You don't have to specifically go to Nimbura, you don't have to specifically go to Sergeant, you just going to use it like you use your like mobile, some mobile app and so on. It's going to be there and that's when we achieve the thing because when people don't have to know, oh, I need to go here, I need to click this, I need to download this. There's so many friction points still when we polish them, it's natively on your phone and then defi becomes mainstream like and basically hopefully we manage to convert like masses.
00:25:39.095 - 00:25:46.595, Speaker B: That's where basically Nibora becomes the successful. When people don't even know they're using it but they're actually just using it for savings.
