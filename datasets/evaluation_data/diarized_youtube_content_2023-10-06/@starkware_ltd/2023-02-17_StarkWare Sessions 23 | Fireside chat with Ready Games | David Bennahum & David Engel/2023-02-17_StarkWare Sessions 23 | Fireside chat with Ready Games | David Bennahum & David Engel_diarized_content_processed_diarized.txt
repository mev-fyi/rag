00:00:03.160 - 00:00:20.604, Speaker A: All right, last one of the day. Thank you all for sticking with us. We'll do some questions at the end, so hopefully that'll incentivize you guys to pay attention and stay along. I'm Dave Engel. I'm the head of business development for Starquare, here with David, CEO of Ready. You want to go ahead and introduce yourself, please?
00:00:20.642 - 00:00:42.552, Speaker B: Yeah, I'm David. Can you guys hear me? It sounds okay. Cool. Dave Bennehum, co founder CEO of Ready Games. My background is in mobile gaming. Been building mobile gaming products for the last 15 years. And about two years ago, we've been building essentially game operations tools for game studios for some time.
00:00:42.552 - 00:01:32.280, Speaker B: We began to see an opportunity to help game studios enter web3. So traditional game studios actually entering into web3. And we got to that realization as we ourselves as a game company, started getting into running certain experiments on chain and realizing that the friction to just enable basic things was so high technically. That kind of led us onto the opportunity here, which is to really create the whole tech stack necessary for especially an existing game studio to take those titles, things that are on Android, on iOS, on PC console, and bring them on chain with an eye to mainstreaming access to just traditional gameplays. Right. So a lot of the people we work with now are just dealing with regular game players who are not necessarily by any means web3 native or blockchain experienced in the least. So a little bit.
00:01:32.280 - 00:01:38.820, Speaker B: My background is technical. It's also just business development and working on this pretty awesome project with help from Starkware.
00:01:38.980 - 00:01:49.276, Speaker A: All right, I want to talk about the tech first, then we'll talk about the economics, and then we'll talk about kind of where you guys are heading and where your successes are. Why is it hard to build a game on web3?
00:01:49.378 - 00:01:59.008, Speaker B: Yeah. So for those of you who are, who here has ever programmed a video game, I'm just curious. Raise your hand if you've ever worked. Okay, so there's one there. Excellent. We have two. Thank you.
00:01:59.008 - 00:02:38.348, Speaker B: So in the gaming industry, especially for games that are multiplayer or have any kind of persistent state, which is like most games these days, have some sort of persistent state, a lot of stuff is happening server side. And there's a whole situation where the state of the game, sorry to get so technical here, is the right crowd saved on things like Amazon Cloud, Server, Azure, Google Firebase and so on. And that data is canonical. It's actually what makes the game fair and the game studios have to do a lot of data management. Now. Imagine taking those pieces of data and saying, we want to bring them on chain. Why? Because we think there's value in doing that for players becoming owners of their own game data.
00:02:38.348 - 00:03:19.636, Speaker B: But the decentralized nature of doing that on chain and the cost of doing it in this sort of permissionless way is meaningful, right? There's transaction time, there's a gas fee. And when we go back to, for people who work in the industry, the amount of data that could be produced in a game, in the web two context is massive. Like as player just procedurally going through something like Call of Duty, for example, which I happen to play way too much of, I know that I'm spawning like a giant firehose of data behind me. Every minute that I'm in Call of Duty. It's everything from what map I'm on to how fast I went through it, many me, tracking movements I made on the map. And all of that stuff is used for analytics. It's also used for targeting me better, et cetera, as a player.
00:03:19.636 - 00:03:49.152, Speaker B: So you want to take all that stuff, bring it on chain. It's so cost prohibitive that it becomes really challenging. And so from a technical standpoint, the studios don't even know where to begin to build this type of data structure on chain. They are not tech companies. It's really easy to forget that a game studio, just because they use tech, it's an entertainment company, it's closer to Hollywood than it is to Google. And to go to those companies and say, hey, man, build Google level stuff for your game is just a fool's errand. Like, they don't want to do that.
00:03:49.152 - 00:04:18.140, Speaker B: That, by the way, destroys their capital expenditure. It destroys a lot of their economics. They want to be focused on releasing awesome games. So in the game industry, there's a huge ecosystem of third party tools that thrive. Things like very famous, like Unity, which is a big game engine, Unreal engine, which you've probably heard of, which is another game engine. These things are successful because if game studios had to build their own game engines, they would just be clawing into all of their cash reserves. For what? Who gives an f about having your own game engine? You want to build a hit game.
00:04:18.140 - 00:04:51.332, Speaker B: And so the minute I'm getting into building Cortech, there's a high chance I'm losing the story as a game studio, and I'm going to lose money. So we saw that huge pain point technically. And so what we rolled out was basically an SDK, which is in unity and unreal. We rolled out an API, which has a whole bunch of methods that allow to synchronize the game data in real time. We use a hybrid web two web3 infrastructure on the web. I'll explain in a minute why it has to be hybrid on the web. Two side it is Google Firebase, on the web, three side it's ethereum, it's darkware, it's other layer twos potentially.
00:04:51.332 - 00:05:23.260, Speaker B: And why is this all relevant? It's that the canonical game data can go on chain. Things like the user identity, the user wallet, certain key game events, key kind of assets they might own, like an NFT backed achievement. And then non canonical data will sit in Google Firebase. The way that works is there's a JSON file. That file has a universal id which is back on chain. That universal id is essentially in the player's wallet and so you can publicly inspect the JSON file. But we as a company are the custodian of that JSON file by definition sitting on Google Firebase.
00:05:23.260 - 00:05:49.992, Speaker B: The goal over time is to move all of that stuff out of those files on chain into the player. We'll get into the economic benefits of the player in a minute. About that. People like Starkware, really important zero knowledge proofing. If we start thinking about that huge trail of data I'm producing that's currently sitting in Google Firebase, I want to start moving more and more of that out. Zero knowledge proofing is one way to get there because the cost, the latency makes it possible. So we're excited to kind of scale into this over time.
00:05:49.992 - 00:06:05.680, Speaker B: We do have this hybrid model for now. So we're not blocked on onboarding the studios, which we'll get into in a second. We're not blocked on doing the first efforts at all, but we have a roadmap over time that enables all this to distribute down to the player level, which is where it needs to go eventually.
00:06:06.020 - 00:06:14.112, Speaker A: So there's a spectrum between, let's call it NFT management and full on chain gaming. What do the studios care about?
00:06:14.246 - 00:06:37.092, Speaker B: So the studios actually care about the full gaming piece. So where there been a business opportunity for us at ready, which is the following. When this sector was really understood, I'd say almost 18 months ago, the low hanging fruit was this NFT management. And there's a whole bunch of things that got created that are famous. You guys probably know what they are that you're like, oh, but they do that. And it's like, yeah, they do this NFT management stuff. What does that means, you know, minting an NFT.
00:06:37.092 - 00:07:11.876, Speaker B: Basically the problem is that that has nothing to do with core game functionality. Right. So what the game studios are running into is, yeah, maybe I want to sell nfts related to my game, but to link the game services to the blockchain itself beyond just the NFT minting. Right. The stuff we were just talking about two minutes ago, those services will sort of throw up their hands and say, well, I don't know. Don't you have an engineering team like finger it out? And the answer is back to, yeah, if we do that, we're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars out of our precious cash reserve to do something that might fail. So no, we're not going to do it.
00:07:11.876 - 00:07:54.928, Speaker B: So a lot of those services have been stuck now with adoption issues because their customers actually aren't going live with games because they have this problem that that provider can't solve, which is this core gaming operations piece. So we come in and do that. A lot of our partners now are increasingly people who do NFT minting services actually want to work with us because they have a backlog of customers ready to go that are not going because they can't do their live game data on chain. So that's sort of the piece here that the studios really, really want. And the reason now we're signing a big studio a week. Like the cadence is really ferocious now in terms of sign ups is because the studios that have been doing diligence on web3, this is their pain point. This is what we offer and as far as we know, nobody else offers it at this level.
00:07:54.928 - 00:08:02.230, Speaker B: The way we are like really purpose built for that gaming industry, for that web two native gaming publisher to enter web3.
00:08:02.600 - 00:08:32.520, Speaker A: And so just sticking on this whole spectrum idea, why do they care? I get like nfts allowing ownership of specific assets, but moving from that then to full on game, like full on chain gaming is substantially more complex. So what kind of games or what segments are you finding that are saying? We actually both understand the value and are willing to invest in working with someone like ready to actually do getting the gameplay really fully on chain.
00:08:32.600 - 00:08:46.804, Speaker B: So you see how I'm doing this magic gesture, which the production team will appreciate. It's called advanced slide and it doesn't actually do that. The reason I'm trying to do that magic gesture is to show you guys, the studios who are signing up. There we go. Thank you. Perfect. I figured they would help me out.
00:08:46.804 - 00:09:09.656, Speaker B: So this is updated. We try to update this every week and it's hard, it's already out of date. But these are publishers that are live in development and in process. And so why am I bringing up this slide? Because you may not recognize these names. I'll just give you a little visibility into them. But this is a huge diversity of game studios that range on the. I guess it's going to be.
00:09:09.656 - 00:09:31.330, Speaker B: I'm doing this from memory. Your top left, Aria Games Canada. This is one of the largest mobile publishers in Canada, based in Toronto. They've been around for over ten years. They do like super nice, beautiful Android and iOS games. They want to start migrating those essentially like mid quarter to casual games on chain. We'll get into more of what they're going to make money off of doing that.
00:09:31.330 - 00:09:50.500, Speaker B: And so the first game is in production. It has 250,000 existing monthly players. Robot rescue, survival. And then you go to all the way over to the end of that road, says Zula. Some of you may know Zula. It's a free to play first person shooter on pc. Completely different than the AriA studios model.
00:09:50.500 - 00:10:02.132, Speaker B: Right. You're now on a pc, you're free to play first person shooter. It's much more hardcore. They're working with us to bring their game on chain. Now they have 40 million lifetime players, 5 million currently active. And then you go just below them. Toro.
00:10:02.132 - 00:10:15.880, Speaker B: Fun. Probably never heard of them, but they're actually pretty big. They have 10 million monthly people. They do social casino on open browser. Oh my God. Totally different model. Right now you're in open browser games and it's social casino.
00:10:15.880 - 00:10:50.392, Speaker B: It's pretty obvious why a social casino game might be interested in some blockchain integration in terms of things you can win and assets you can own in those contexts. And then in between all those things, I'll just point out one other apptoid. This is not done yet, but this is a third party Android App Store. So what is that? It's a competitor to like Google Play. They're really big. Outside of North America and Europe, 400 million monthly visitors on that App Store there have 2600 games in a specific vertical. They want to create an NFT backed game pass model within game rewards that creates customer loyalty around provisioning games from apptoy to not going to Google Play.
00:10:50.392 - 00:11:20.528, Speaker B: Right? And then there's a relationship to the phone carrier. Now we're getting into this awesome sauce of the phone carriers want to start disintermediating Google, in particular Android, and have the billing relationship. So you could theoretically purchase these things through your phone and have that go on your phone bill and not through some other payment thing like PayPal or blah blah blah. So you've got an Android App Store. You've got a free to play thing on pc. You've got the social casino thing. You've got Aria doing high performance, like beautiful, casual games on mobile.
00:11:20.528 - 00:11:48.844, Speaker B: And more and more and more and so collectively right now, I think, can we do another click, maybe go forward? Let's see if it works. I'm talking to the production team. Is it possible? Oh, there we go. Maybe I'm doing that click. But look at the wallet growth. I mean, this is basically what's happening now. We went live with the product to do this basically in November of 22, and it's now, I guess February of 23.
00:11:48.844 - 00:12:24.520, Speaker B: And so the reason there's this sort of monstrous burst now is that these big studios are coming on. One of the first things they want to do is take their existing web two players, get them engaged to focus on web3. And one way to do that, claim your wallet, like get going, is to do like an NFT, airdrop, et cetera. They have the data store with all the web two players. They can message them directly. And so Zula is the one that's moving in first to do all this stuff, we targeted the 5 million current active players, and so now they're all claiming their on chain identity. So as that game then goes live in web3, they're going to be prepared to start doing transactions.
00:12:24.520 - 00:12:41.180, Speaker B: So why on earth are the publishers doing all this? Sounds fun. And I am clicking it myself. Yay. It's basically, sorry for a somewhat noisy slide, but this just tells the story of money. Money, because that's the only reason they should do this, is money. Let's be clear. There's no philosophy here other than make money.
00:12:41.180 - 00:13:07.744, Speaker B: So this is unit economics. These are coming out of the first games we did that were hyper casual, that we moved on chain. And these are horribly thin unit economic games. And what you see here are the web two cohorts versus the web3 cohorts and how they behave. So I'll say top left, basically, in a free to play game, you're trying to convert your players to purchase. Benchmark was four and a half before transition. The web3 cohorts showed up 40% made purchase decisions.
00:13:07.744 - 00:13:27.512, Speaker B: Okay, first mover, early adopter. But, okay, that's a ten x increase in purchase interest that's going to cool down over time, right as you move out of the early adopter. The thing right next to it is the average revenue per daily active user, the Arpdao. That went from $0.11 in web two to $0.30. In web3. So now you're seeing basically people spending more on those digital assets.
00:13:27.512 - 00:13:53.156, Speaker B: Why? Because they have more perceived value as a player. Why? Because they actually can do things that a web two asset can't do. Oh, really? Like what? Well, you're the legal owner contractually of the asset. You can resell it and trade it. It can potentially give you a dividend or yield if it's infused with the ecosystem token that we offer, which we encourage every publisher to do. So now you can essentially stake your digital collection and get yield. You can potentially destroy the asset, extract the underlying token that's in there.
00:13:53.156 - 00:14:28.828, Speaker B: If the game that it correlates to stops being successful, you can potentially interoperate it in other games. And the license and the right to your ownership of that asset can be recognized by another developer, which now is the next frontier. Why would publishers cooperate with this, that they're worth more? So something that was once sold for a dollar can sell for $3 because it has these new features. Yay, I'm making more money. And then I'll just mention bottom right, look at the organic installs for web two versus web3. That means what? Well, these are non attributed installs, meaning they didn't come from Google Ads, Facebook ads demand advertising networks. They came through potentially word of mouth.
00:14:28.828 - 00:15:10.636, Speaker B: Well, in web3, word of mouth and affiliate marketing is the way it's going to work more than display ads. And the way that is going to kind of target is based on the onchain data. So essentially in the web3 environment, what you're doing as a publisher is you're looking at people's on chain data, their game history, and you're making offers to them to try a new game. But now what's so cool is you can do the deep in app attribution to the onchain identity and say not only try this game, but within the next 40 hours, play down to level five oh and get above up 10,000 points on level five oh. If you do all those things, boom, boom, boom, we're going to release to you these NFT backed assets in the game or other rewards. And there's no real fraud there, right? Because that identity is canonical on chain. And by the way, Google can't stop it, Apple can't stop it.
00:15:10.636 - 00:15:27.100, Speaker B: No IDFA horse crap, which you may be familiar with, gone, doesn't matter, can't stop us. And finally, who loses in this equation? Definitely Facebook. Definitely Google. They're black boxes. They do this matchmaking, they take a ridiculous amount of money, they're worth half a trillion dollars. Why? Nobody knows. It's all secret.
00:15:27.100 - 00:15:54.556, Speaker B: But now with this stuff, it's the player getting the benefit, the player is getting the reward, and a lot of the media spend is going actually to the player, to the player to get the reward, to try the game. So all this requires on chain data at scale, requires ZK proofing, requires people like starkware to help us do this. And in the meantime, we are running this hybrid web two, web3. But the bottom line is make money. That's why publishers are doing it and that's why we're signing a big publisher a week at this point, and it's growing so fast.
00:15:54.658 - 00:16:03.452, Speaker A: So I assume that that data is from more like NFT management type games as opposed to the progression to on chain data.
00:16:03.506 - 00:16:09.900, Speaker B: Is that data? Yeah, it's basically NFT related, right? They're buying NFT type assets.
00:16:09.980 - 00:16:37.736, Speaker A: So I think what's really interesting, what you said, I just want to understand more. Do you have data around the quality of the ad targeting? It clicked in my head that the benefit of an on chain data is then the quality and the ease and the kind of open network of actually understanding customer data and then being able to target them more effectively. Is there any precedent to understand? Because this is like the front door and you're already seeing how they're more engaged and then the cream is then your ability to remarket to them far more effectively than you can in a closed ecosystem. Do you have any data on that.
00:16:37.758 - 00:16:41.576, Speaker B: Yet in terms of. I didn't understand, what data question are you asking exactly?
00:16:41.678 - 00:16:56.092, Speaker A: So you mentioned that the quality of your ability to then remarket to these customers because the data is on chain is much better than in a closed ecosystem where you're using Google Analytics. So do you have any data around the upside that you get remarketing to these customers relative to an enclosed ecosystem?
00:16:56.156 - 00:17:18.596, Speaker B: Yeah. So basically what happens when you have the game data on chain associated to the profiles? You can't trade that data. So that data is not sellable. Right. You can't move it to somebody else. It's really your data now. That data tells people stuff about your behavior in the game, from your skill level to the amount of time you play, potentially to who you play with based on that data.
00:17:18.596 - 00:17:47.164, Speaker B: And we provide some of these tools. You can create what's called a lookalike profile, essentially, and you can kind of identify other people that look like this type of data. This is what you want to see. People who did this well in this game would be probably interested in my game. And because it's all on chain, it's essentially viewable without us having to control it that way. Like it can be viewed. Now you are trusting that the publisher is writing good data onto the player's profile, but you making those decisions can choose to dismiss publisher data that you think is stupid or that publish.
00:17:47.164 - 00:18:24.180, Speaker B: So if publishers put stuff on a profile that you think is noisy, you would just not use that for your targeting. So it gets into quality of publishers. By the way, some publisher data will probably be more valuable, like more prestigious than others, which gets to the player then has something called reputational capital. From all this data, they can monetize it. And that's one of the beauties of web3, is you're accumulating reputational capital to your identity. And the quality of that capital is going to correlate to the quality of the offers you get, the quality that you provide as a user. So there's a reward here to being a loyal user, actually, and insisting that games recognize your identity.
00:18:24.180 - 00:18:36.988, Speaker B: You want them to because you want to add more data to your identity now. And so, ready identity. We provide the wallet, we provide the user identity, and we provide the technology to do all those read write operations for the game studio to achieve that.
00:18:37.074 - 00:18:43.344, Speaker A: That's actually really eye opening to me. The amount of additional upside that you get from remarketing as well. I hadn't even clicked on that.
00:18:43.462 - 00:19:11.688, Speaker B: I hate to say it, but this is the second derivative piece that will be huge over time. It could turn into hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of value, if not more, because, dude, it's finding people who are relevant. To try your product is the hardest damn thing, as you know, on the Internet. And being able to do that more efficiently is just such a massive unlock. And for 15 years, we've been in the shadow of these demand advertising platforms that are just total monopolies and are extracting ridiculous rents because they can. So, wow, that's a huge unlock to be able to finally break that down.
00:19:11.774 - 00:19:20.412, Speaker A: All right, last question. You have done, like, extensive due diligence on different blockchains. You worked on Ethereum, you looked at Starkx significantly as well. You landed on Starknet. Why?
00:19:20.466 - 00:19:26.784, Speaker B: Yeah, well, I think for us, Starknet, it's the opportunity to really create our own custom Starknet. Honestly, we need all these.
00:19:26.822 - 00:19:28.064, Speaker A: Can you explain what that is?
00:19:28.182 - 00:19:29.650, Speaker B: No, but maybe you can.
00:19:30.980 - 00:19:31.648, Speaker A: I can.
00:19:31.734 - 00:20:18.412, Speaker B: Okay. A custom starknet is basically a version of Starknet that is purpose built for a specific need that an enterprise might have, like ours. And so the reason we want to do that is that the smart contracts and the way the data transits and a custom starknet is more purpose built also, we can then silo off essentially little mini, let's just say the Starknet, not to get too layery here, is like a layer three ish kind of moment. Then you start going into each studio, becomes like a layer four on top of that layer three. And we can kind of make all that work and make sense. And this is all just more and more efficiency and how the data operates. And so Starknet gives a level of flexibility to achieve that where we have a level of control and sort of quality assurance that's really important for our customers because these are AAA studios that expect a really high level of quality assurance.
00:20:18.412 - 00:20:23.292, Speaker B: And that's where the custom Starknet environment is really appealing.
00:20:23.356 - 00:20:37.856, Speaker A: Yeah, and I think just doing my job. The other upside is that you substantially mitigate the risk of congestion pricing where you can actually control the block size and control the throughput. And how have you guys found building in Cairo?
00:20:38.048 - 00:20:54.348, Speaker B: Well, we're pretty good at it. And everyone says that's supposed to be so hard and impossible. And I don't know. We recruited people who know Cairo and they wrote the smart contracts and it seems to be okay. So I wouldn't want to say, I mean, it's not a point of friction. I'll just leave it at that.
00:20:54.514 - 00:20:57.144, Speaker A: Look, I think that's as positive feedback as we get about Cairo.
00:20:57.192 - 00:21:01.390, Speaker B: I don't know. She's fine. It's not a blocker. I'll just put it that way.
00:21:02.400 - 00:21:20.084, Speaker A: Awesome. No, look, we're super excited to have you guys building up gaming on Starknet. I think that you are really the first real example of kind of what bringing web two to web3 gaming on Starknet will be. And the progress that you guys have made is like. Is just awesome. So thank you very much for your support and look forward to working with you.
00:21:20.122 - 00:21:28.096, Speaker B: Yeah, and I'll just thank this audience. And do we have time for questions or am I overtime? I'm overtime, so we don't have questions. You do have my little link tree thing here apparently.
00:21:28.128 - 00:21:29.028, Speaker A: Or you can just stop them on.
00:21:29.034 - 00:21:32.276, Speaker B: The way out or you can come talk to me. So. Yeah, thanks guys for listening. I appreciate it.
00:21:32.298 - 00:21:33.030, Speaker A: Thanks everyone.
