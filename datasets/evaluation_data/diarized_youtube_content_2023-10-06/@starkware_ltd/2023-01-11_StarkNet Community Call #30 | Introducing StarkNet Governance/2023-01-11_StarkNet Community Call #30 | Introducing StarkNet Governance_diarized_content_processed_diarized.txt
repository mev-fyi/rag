00:00:00.090 - 00:00:21.502, Speaker A: Board. And we're live. So hi everyone. Everyone on Discord, everyone on YouTube. And welcome to this 30th Starknet community call. I don't know when we should start celebrating numbers for community calls. 30 is pretty good.
00:00:21.502 - 00:00:53.294, Speaker A: I'm guessing 52 is going to be nice because it's going to be one year, even though we do them every two weeks. So it doesn't really mean one year, but for some reason, I don't know, 52 will feel nice. 30 is pretty gold still. And today we're going to be talking about Starknet governance. So we have free guests with us today. You should be able to hear them on Discord, but better you can watch them on YouTube. They have a nice presentation for you.
00:00:53.294 - 00:01:35.610, Speaker A: So you can get there, see what they're presenting, what they're talking about, and you can ask your questions. So you can ask your questions on the community call channel, and you can ask your questions on the YouTube comments also. So feel free to write stuff and I'll pick up your question and ask it. And let's get right into it. So we have three guests today. We have manor from Starkware, we have Silv from Brick and Devon from Nevermind. Though I will say that Silv, Devon today, you're not really representing Nevermind or brick, right? You're representing something else.
00:01:35.610 - 00:01:44.300, Speaker A: Can you talk a. You know, I was starting your presentation instead of you. Why don't you go ahead and present Sylvie? You'll be more accurate than.
00:01:46.910 - 00:01:47.626, Speaker B: To unmute.
00:01:47.658 - 00:01:49.680, Speaker A: Yourself on discord when you're talking.
00:01:52.050 - 00:02:17.240, Speaker B: Okay. Can you hear me, Henry? Is that good? Okay. Hello everybody. I'm Anur. I'm a PM at Starquare, working on Starknet in the new or so in the last month. I'm working together with Silv and David on the governor's committee for Stacklet. And of course, Sylv and David will present themselves down the road in this call.
00:02:17.240 - 00:03:19.862, Speaker B: So we're going to talk today about stacking governance, first phase, and I will explain about it in a minute. Silv, can you move forward with the slide? And I'm going to give some background regarding stacked governance, stuff we posted a few weeks ago, and I mean the whole wide view of it. And then Sylvan David will speak about details regarding the first phase and we're going to answer some questions regarding what's next, etc. Okay, so the big picture, can you move forward? Thanks. Okay, the big picture. So, as you know, we announced Stocknet now have a foundation which is not Stackwell, it's something else. And the foundation has a mean, actually they have few objectives inside this mission, but the main mission is to make sure the vision of Starcnet is moving forward in the right direction.
00:03:19.862 - 00:04:19.306, Speaker B: Right. And all the details of the foundation we have in the post. There's a lot of small details regarding that and I don't want to deep dive to it now I'm just going to say that our committee is part of the foundation. So the seven board members of the foundation asked me, David and Silv to work together for a few months, just like a small mandate period of time, and to propose the proposal for how we think the stagnant governance first phases should look like. Okay, great. So just for the background, can you move forward please? Okay, so very wide background. So when we have stocknet roadmap we talked about, we must have the basic functionality first, and then we want to make sure we have the good performance, right, cost, throughput, latency, et cetera.
00:04:19.306 - 00:05:02.798, Speaker B: And this is where we are focusing right now. And then we want to make sure that Starknet fulfilling its vision as a decentralized network and we want to move forward with decentralization. So we don't have the perfect performance yet, but we already started working gradually on the decentralization path. Okay, great. And when I say decentralization, I wanted to specifically explain what we are talking about. So as we see it, in order to have decentralized network, right, decentralized Starknet, there is one section and it's talking about decentralized protocol. We need to have open source different sections in Starknet, hopefully all of it.
00:05:02.798 - 00:05:58.094, Speaker B: And we want to have decentralized system components, right? So decentralized sequencer, decentralized proverb, like a consensus mechanism between different participations, et cetera. And the other section we're talking about that the protocol will be able to change over time, right? So being able to have time mechanisms for decision making regarding protocol changes. And this is the part that the governance committee, Sylvia David is responsible for for a few phases, and this is what we're going to speak about today. So different mechanisms for changing in the protocol. Okay, great. I think we move forward. So just the process of building mechanisms for this component, right.
00:05:58.094 - 00:07:17.442, Speaker B: How we're going to get the decision making or decentralized decision making post darknet, this is like things that are going to be like basic guidelines for us. So it's definitely going to be open and we're going to do it, we're going to do it together with the community and we want to have everybody involved and we're going to speak about it a lot later in the call. We want to do it gradual because step by step, like experimental things, because we don't have all the answers now and it definitely can look forward too far and we want to make it flexible. So if we are going to make mistakes down the road, we can take it back and try to do the right thing for the present. Right, not only not pay for the past mistakes, and we want to do it very responsively and conscious because doing mistakes on governance stuff could be dangerous for stocking to disinfoc. Okay, I think, I hope this was a good background for phase one. I will pass it to silv.
00:07:17.442 - 00:07:37.520, Speaker B: I just want to say it's very important to remember that all the details that I talked about from now, it's just our proposal for the first few months of startup governance. Okay, so just for the first few months, it's not the whole plan for the future. Okay, great, thanks.
00:07:42.450 - 00:07:46.834, Speaker C: All right, taking over here. Can you all hear me? Does it work?
00:07:46.872 - 00:07:47.460, Speaker B: Only.
00:07:48.310 - 00:08:23.694, Speaker C: Okay, so nice meeting you all. I'm Sil from the co founder of BRIC, one of the biggest NFT projects on stocknet. And I'm also helping the stocknet foundation, along with Manor and Devon for the governance committee. So as Manor explained, the purpose of the governance committee is to help kickstart governance in the first month of its life, so that later on we can have a thriving, decentralized ecosystem. So we're not here forever. It's more like just jumpstarting everything. So we can start with a good.
00:08:23.732 - 00:08:26.320, Speaker A: Basis to do this.
00:08:27.410 - 00:09:11.420, Speaker C: The Stacknet foundation decided to have a first, let's say tryout of governance on stocknet. This is what the first phase is. As you know, the stocknet token does exist, but is not necessarily widely distributed. The network still needs to evolve technically. So in order for us to get trained as an ecosystem around governance, we thought that it was not a good idea to just go right out of the bat with full on decentralization. And we very much wanted to have a gradual approach. So the first phase of governance is going to last, we don't know just yet, about six to nine months probably.
00:09:11.420 - 00:09:59.750, Speaker C: And the purpose of having the first phase of governance is to frame what can be voted on during this first phase. So we will be voting on protocol upgrades during this first phase of governance, the Stocknet foundation will propose the topics up for votes. And these topics are only restricted to protocol upgrades. So it's mainly about, okay, Stocknet version 2.27 is now running on Testnet let's vote so that we decide if it should go on main net in production. This allows us to have a much more reduced scope and very much understand the implications of having everyone vote, understand how the delegation system works and everything else. So who can vote.
00:09:59.750 - 00:10:54.990, Speaker C: So the voters currently are the stocknet token holders, meaning the delegates. Devin will speak a bit more about this, the builders council, which I'm taking care of, and any other token holders. This does not mean that only these people are involved in governance. Anyone can be involved in governance, but only these people can vote. And we very much want to have anyone's input in the community forums and everything else about how things should be run. So in order to represent builders, and let's say like early adopters of stocknet, we decided to set up what is called the Builders council. So the Builders council is a group of 17 builders from the ecosystem.
00:10:54.990 - 00:11:57.060, Speaker C: They are builders such as people from cotrage, Shardlabs, EKln Star in Africa, snapshot that have made like a contribution to the ecosystem at large and represent the community at large as well. And the stocknet foundation will delegate a portion of its voting power to the builders council, which amounts to approximately 23% of the whole voting power. So this builder council is a bit like. Not necessarily like the Supreme Court, but like a group of builders to which you can talk to, you can act, you can interact with that, can voice their opinions as builders regarding what is going on with governance. The way the builders council works is the following. Every time there is a new vote, we gather around, we record a call, we record meeting notes, and we have a simple majority vote about whether or not we should go to production. Then we vote on chain to enact that change.
00:11:57.060 - 00:12:28.140, Speaker C: This builders council is not set in stone. It will only last for the first phase of governance, after which the mandate will be reviewed and maybe will not exist anymore or will have a different organization. This is again the first phase of governance. We're just getting started and we believe that this is a good addition to the overall system. The other leg of the first lease of governance is delegation. And I'll let Devin talk more about this.
00:12:31.230 - 00:12:43.040, Speaker A: Do you want me to ask questions now or later? Because I already get a bunch. Maybe let's do the present. Like, do you want to finish the presentation? And then we get into questions. What do you guys feel like?
00:12:43.890 - 00:12:45.806, Speaker D: I think this is the last slide.
00:12:45.998 - 00:12:51.634, Speaker A: All right, so I'll let you present it in the last question. All right, cool.
00:12:51.752 - 00:13:50.950, Speaker D: My name is David. I'm a CSO at Nethermind and also partake in some research. But here at the Starknet foundation I'm kind of leading the initiative around delegation. So what delegation is basically is that it allows the decoupling of the voting power associated with tokens and the actual ownership of tokens itself. And that's actually a really cool primitive because someone that owns a bunch of stark tokens and if they don't want to partake in governance can actually elect a delegate to vote on their behalf. And that's a really powerful tool because it enables community members, Starknet community members, to be able to gain a lot of voting power not based on their token holdings, but based basically on their reputation within the community. So a few weeks ago we released a couple of announcements and one of those was the delegate profile thread.
00:13:50.950 - 00:14:43.330, Speaker D: The link is there sitting on this slide. We've had about 80 community members post delegate profiles. And if you're kind of confused about what that is, it's basically just a post on the Starknet community forum saying, hey, this is my platform, you can delegate tokens to me to this address. This is how involved I plan to become. Yeah, and around 80 members is a lot. And one of the initiatives that we're working on now is being able to connect these people that have proposed themselves as delegates with actual delegators. And we're working on some things around delegate discovery programs and website where all of these things can be hosted centrally.
00:14:43.330 - 00:15:32.150, Speaker D: Something that's interesting about delegates that isn't necessarily true for some of the other stuff we've talked about is this is not a single mandate. Delegates will, if you apply for a delegate now, the delegation will carry on completely throughout the entirety of Starknet governance until someone undelegates to you. And this is not something the foundation has control over. So delegation is completely a permissionless process. And as well as on the community forum, we are allowing anyone to apply themselves as delegates. We're not going to close delegation at any point. So two months down the line, three months down the line, if you decide you want to become a delegate, we will continuously add more resources for you to be able to post a profile and gain delegation.
00:15:32.150 - 00:16:27.026, Speaker D: That being said, I would urge anyone that's considering this to apply as soon as possible because there probably will be a first round of delegations going out. So if you want to obtain voting power for the first vote, it would be best to apply as soon as possible and just a little bit about the roles of a delegate. So one obviously partaking in starknet governance votes, which votes will pertain to protocol upgrades, but there's actually a lot more than that because we're talking about upgrading a network. There's a lot of discussion that happens before these upgrades are made, and that's really kind of where the heart of governance is. So delegates are also expected to kind of engage with different snps, talk about prioritization for upgrades within the community forum. And kind of the last step of that is actually voting. So if you have any more questions about that, feel free to ask in the chat or reach out to me personally.
00:16:27.026 - 00:16:29.254, Speaker D: I'm happy to connect on that as well.
00:16:29.452 - 00:16:53.134, Speaker A: Fantastic, Devin, perfect. This is very clear. So I'll also say that while you're listening to the call, you can make questions on the community calls channel on Discord. It's under category community support. You can also send your questions in YouTube by monitoring the comments. So feel free to ask your question. So I actually have a question for you, Devin, to make sure I understand correctly.
00:16:53.134 - 00:17:18.140, Speaker A: So what you're saying is basically token holders will be able to vote. Token holders who don't want to take an active part in governance or better said, would like to delegate their voting power to some people can. So the delegation is that system, right? Anyone can say, oh yeah, I'll take part in governance and you can delegate your voting power to me. Is that correct?
00:17:21.230 - 00:18:02.630, Speaker D: Yeah, that's absolutely the idea. And just to kind of draw clarity on a few concepts, one, if a token holder delegating, they don't put their tokens at risk whatsoever. They still retain full ownership. They can undelegate at any time. They can redelegate to another individual delegates are also at least how it's set up right now and this may change in the future, are able to actually override votes that delegates make. So if they particularly don't like a decision that delegate has made, they have the option to override those votes. That typically doesn't get exercised and is just kind of a phase of feature of our current platform.
00:18:02.780 - 00:18:05.990, Speaker A: That's pretty cool. Is that liquid democracy?
00:18:07.390 - 00:18:14.102, Speaker D: Yeah, it's basically at any point in time, there's no election cycles that go on delegation.
00:18:14.246 - 00:18:21.100, Speaker A: You're continuously on campaign and you can continuously get ousted from office. Right. That's pretty cool.
00:18:21.950 - 00:18:22.314, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:18:22.352 - 00:18:28.042, Speaker D: And also the opposite is true. At any point in time you can enter the community and become a large voter.
00:18:28.186 - 00:18:43.410, Speaker A: Yeah, that's really nice. A question like if I can override the vote of a delegate I gave my voting power to, when does a vote become final? Is there like a time window for you to say, oh, I disagree with this vote.
00:18:44.470 - 00:19:26.366, Speaker D: Yeah. When a proposal comes out, actually all of the voting power that everyone that votes on that proposal, their voting power is measured at the beginning of that proposal. So if say a proposal comes out and one of the delegates votes, and I don't like how they vote, voted, I actually don't have the option to redelegate to someone else and have them vote on the same proposal. I could redelegate to someone else and have them vote on the next proposal. But yeah, at any point I'm allowed to override the vote of the delegate, the person I'm delegating to while the.
00:19:26.388 - 00:19:28.482, Speaker A: Vote is still open. Is that correct?
00:19:28.616 - 00:19:43.666, Speaker D: This is while the vote is still open. Manol can maybe speak to this, but I believe there's like a five day window to a seven day window where voting is open. So between that period, that vote can be overridden until the last minute that the vote is active.
00:19:43.778 - 00:20:08.062, Speaker A: So folks, make sure your delegates vote early. That way you can make sure that it can be an actual criteria to judge delegates. Right. How early they vote, that they get you time for revision of their votes. And I'm not saying this is necessarily something you would want to check, but it's an interesting mechanism. I got some questions regarding. Oh, Manor, you want to say something?
00:20:08.116 - 00:20:37.378, Speaker B: Yeah, thanks, Devin. I just want to explain a bit about the process because this is maybe a part of it. So once we have the next version ready, next version is version zero point eleven. We're going to deploy it to integration, make sure everything works okay. And then we're going to move it to testnet on Gary. And when the version is going to be deployed to Gary, we're going to open the vote. Right.
00:20:37.378 - 00:21:11.700, Speaker B: And then people can watch the code, test it, play with it, see what they think regarding that, and vote. And in the first phase we thought seven days will be enough time for people to vote, but we will see if it's not going to be enough time, we're going to make it longer. We just want to make sure we have a final period of time to vote. And then once the vote period is over, if we have an approval, we move forward and deploy tomorrow. This is the process.
00:21:13.190 - 00:21:44.800, Speaker A: Perfect. I understand. Thank you. So I have a question. If the delegation process is fairly solidified, right, because it will carry over in the next phases of governance, can you come back a few slides earlier? I have some question around exactly this. When you say who can vote, the delegation is implemented, the builders council will vote and token holders will vote. Where do exactly do the builders council derive their power from.
00:21:49.310 - 00:22:15.300, Speaker C: Let me quickly unmute myself from everywhere. So we are getting this voting power directly from the Stocknet foundation. So the Stocknet foundation is delegating a portion of their voting power to the builder council. So you could consider that it's like a group of people to which a significant portion of the voting power has been delegated to.
00:22:17.270 - 00:22:45.050, Speaker A: Okay, this makes sense. So technically, this governance phase is not really a starknet governance phase. It's a starknet foundation governance phase. Right. It's not something that is interestingly linked to what the network mechanism for voting is, because token holder can vote. It's just that the foundation decided to allocate part of its voting power to the builders console. Is that correct? Yeah, that's.
00:22:45.050 - 00:22:50.780, Speaker A: Oh, manor, you want to say something?
00:22:51.630 - 00:23:33.126, Speaker B: Yeah, this is exactly right. And you can even say more than that. So the foundation. Okay, during the first phase, Darkware one's going to vote at all and not going to participate directly in the voting, and the foundation going to participate only like two representatives. The foundation won't vote directly. During the first phase, the foundation will delegate voting power for once, the builder council. And second, as David told before, to several delegates who are going to propose themselves from the pool.
00:23:33.126 - 00:23:46.430, Speaker B: So we're going to have the foundation kind of giving voting power to other parts from Stockholm's community, and giving them the power to influence and be part of the government during the first phase.
00:23:47.090 - 00:23:58.850, Speaker A: Understood. Question around that. What's the balance between how much voting power is delegated to builders and how much is delegated to delegate for the foundation?
00:24:04.400 - 00:24:23.920, Speaker C: I'll take this one. So currently, the foundation has 50% of the entire voting power, and they will be delegating of the overall voting power 23% to the builders council and 10% to other delayed.
00:24:24.820 - 00:24:34.550, Speaker A: Okay, so that's 32% that the foundation will use. Where will it use the remaining 18%? Or will it just not vote with these ones?
00:24:37.920 - 00:24:40.540, Speaker C: It will sit tight, if I remember correctly.
00:24:43.820 - 00:25:28.360, Speaker D: Sylv, I don't know if you have access to it easily, but if you have the official token allocation breakdown, I believe that basically the foundation is kind of custodying a lot of funds that don't necessarily belong to the foundation, but will be distributed through different means. Will be distributed through different means over time. I believe, and I may be wrong with this, that the portion of tokens that the foundation is talking about distributing is that 10% that is directly linked to just the foundation.
00:25:30.780 - 00:25:52.640, Speaker A: Wait, I'm not sure I understand. So, from what I understand, the foundation holds 50% of the tokens of these 50, 22 will give their voting power to the builders council, 10% will give their voting power to delegates. Will the remaining 18% remain silent?
00:25:54.820 - 00:25:55.570, Speaker D: Yes.
00:25:56.660 - 00:26:28.190, Speaker A: Perfect. And so we talked about the 50% from the foundation. What about the other 50%? So part of it is Starquare who said they would remain from voting for the first phase. What about the rest? How much does it represent? And can these people vote? Basically, I guess my question is like, can we get an overview of who are the people with the ability to vote for this first phase and to get a notion of the distribution of power here?
00:26:30.240 - 00:27:09.720, Speaker B: Yes, sure. Just to make sure everybody is on us up until now. So it's with us up until now. So during the first phase, as you all know, we don't have board token allocation. Right. So the only token holders right now, during this first phase is actually like investors and core contributors and the foundation. And the mission of the foundation is to allocate all this 51% of the token to the community through different channels and ways.
00:27:09.720 - 00:27:33.890, Speaker B: Right. So during the first phase, this is why we did this system for delegate voting power. The way it looks like. Actually, I think we have a slide on it, right? Somewhere. Maybe it will be better to just show it. Help us to explain.
00:27:35.060 - 00:27:41.844, Speaker C: You mean the token distribution? I have the article if you want.
00:27:42.042 - 00:27:46.288, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm looking for it. Also, I'd like to see the breakdown.
00:27:46.464 - 00:27:53.288, Speaker B: Yeah, I think we have a slide on our presentation, right? I'm not sure.
00:27:53.454 - 00:28:09.260, Speaker A: Okay, so I see the medium post here. So I can see 50.1 granted by stockware to the foundation. So that's the foundation part. I see 17% stockware investors. So I guess these guys can vote. These people can vote then.
00:28:09.260 - 00:28:24.370, Speaker A: 32.9 core contributors at Starkware and its employees and consultant and starknet software developers and partner. So of these, I'm guessing part of it will be Starkware and will refrain from voting in that first part. Is that correct?
00:28:25.220 - 00:28:28.848, Speaker B: Yeah, that's the.
00:28:28.934 - 00:28:31.570, Speaker A: Is the proportion of this public.
00:28:34.340 - 00:29:09.888, Speaker D: Silv's actually showing the first phase voting breakdown right now. So this is actually of the voting power that's going to be available to be either voted with or delegated. So investors hold 33.3% of the voting power. Starknet's early core contributors, excluding Starkware, because Starquare said that they're not going to be exercising voting power, is 33.3%. And then the foundations in totality is going to represent 33.3% of the voting power.
00:29:09.888 - 00:29:18.000, Speaker D: And that's further broken down in 23.3% to the builders council and then 10% to various delegates.
00:29:18.820 - 00:29:31.220, Speaker A: Okay, this makes it very clear. And I don't have any further questions on this. Thank you. Sorry for being a bit fur. I just wanted to make sure I get things correctly. Thank you. So I'm guessing my next question is, this is fine.
00:29:31.220 - 00:30:09.350, Speaker A: We're going to. So the process you described is this is a first phase. We're trying to do that. I guess we can say that governance is in Alpha, kind of like Starknet, which is pretty cool, right? One thing we do though, for Starknet Alpha is we have a testnet and we have an integration network. How do you test net governance? How do you see what things work? Because we're launching this phase and it's in production already. Voting power is allocated and is distributed. I'm curious, how do you approach testing governance mechanism when you don't have a way to test it? Or should we have a way to test it?
00:30:13.320 - 00:30:18.150, Speaker D: I think. Sorry, mano, would you like to go?
00:30:20.880 - 00:30:21.630, Speaker B: Okay.
00:30:22.000 - 00:31:19.788, Speaker D: I think that there's kind of a few things to this. One is that we've kind of watched a lot of other communities deal with the problem of governance before, whether that's other blockchains like Ethereum dealing with its EIP process, or thousands of dows that have kind of paved the way, and a lot of these toolings as well. So we kind of have a lot of examples to follow. Well, the idea of l two governance, a starknet governance, does have some very unique challenges as well. There is also kind of the idea of progressive decentralization. Well, this is like, yes, we are kind of hitting the ground running in production. We're going to have a first vote that's actually going to count, and we're onboarding delegates for votes that are actually going to count while we are acting in production.
00:31:19.788 - 00:31:58.670, Speaker D: There's still some kind of, I guess, like training wheels on us where we're slowly focusing on the foundation is basically going to use 10% of its distributed voting power to make sure that delegates are actually able to vote and do receive voting power. Also, kind of the initiative with the Builders council is to make sure that all application developers and infrastructure developers on Starknet have access to voting power to be able to vote. So there are a few initiatives that we're doing to make sure that although we are in production, we have as many players as possible to have a successful vote when that time comes around.
00:32:00.720 - 00:32:03.870, Speaker A: Very cool. Anyone want to add something?
00:32:05.200 - 00:32:31.064, Speaker B: No, I totally agree with David. I just wanted to add one of the ways we are trying to do it with a testnet, right. Is doing it gradually. We're not starting with having the whole system governed by the community with a lot of complex mechanisms and everything we're doing step by step, learning from each step along the way. And we think this is a good way to test our assumptions. Right?
00:32:31.182 - 00:33:06.850, Speaker A: Yeah, but still, what if you give power to a faulty governance mechanism? Once you've given power, it's hard to take it back or reallocate it or synchronize around doing it. That's what testnets are for, right? I'm obviously talking about something that doesn't exist. So I know that it's kind of a stupid question. Just figure that it's interesting to draw a parallel. And I was wondering how you approach it. Though deploying these step by step does make sense for sure. Devon, you mentioned that you have some.
00:33:06.850 - 00:33:11.270, Speaker A: Okay, let's go, Sylvan. Devon, you want to say something before I jump on another question?
00:33:11.800 - 00:33:46.110, Speaker C: I wanted to also add that because this is quite experimental, this is the reason we rely on trust and tested architectures. So we use the compound delegation module. It's something that's been test and tried tremendously. So we're not playing with things in production. The good thing is this has already been tested. This is already running on Ethereum Mainet. So we very much reduced the exposure to catastrophic events doing this.
00:33:49.280 - 00:34:57.850, Speaker D: One thing that I think is really interesting to think about is that the idea of the builders council, and yes, we are using it to be able to distribute voting power to a bunch of different application developers and infrastructure developers on Starknet and be able to bring all these actors into Starknet governance. But in my opinion, I think it kind of opens the door to a lot broader question about how the idea of voting councils and how they might interact with starknet governance, I mean, there's really nothing from stopping anyone from starting their own version of the Builders council and obtaining delegation. So I think while yes, there's a lot of unanswered questions about how we approach and how we pilot these things, I think we're kind of doing it in a somewhat safe and controlled environment and defining what the relationship between a voting council and starknet governance looks like. And then as the token becomes more widely distributed, I think that we'll see a lot of these foundations that we're setting spin off into really unique things that the foundation doesn't actually have control over.
00:34:58.780 - 00:35:22.290, Speaker A: Super cool, Devin. Earlier you mentioned that we can draw conclusions and see what works and what doesn't from other Daos and other existing system that are in production today. Can you name a few dows or projects that you think have interesting governance mechanism or active governance processes that you like or that you thought were interesting?
00:35:24.500 - 00:36:07.016, Speaker D: Yeah. One to say, Silva mentioned it earlier, but the compound, Governor Bravo. The model, that compound kind of started and then open zeppelin generalized and it's also used by uniswap as well. The governor Bravo and ERC 20 votes model is a really strong one. And I think it's been the foundation for a lot of dows and that's just kind of the basics of token based voting. It's been really interesting to see how that plays out, how the interactions between delegates and delegators and paid contributors kind of plays out in those communities. I think some other interesting examples.
00:36:07.016 - 00:37:04.830, Speaker D: There's like the idea of makers, the way that maker treats delegates. Makerdao actually has an official onboarding process for delegates and then if they onboard, they actually receive compensation based on how active they are in discussions, how often they're voting. And that kind of adds a little bit more. There's a larger incentive layer to the whole delegation process and I think it's actually proven very well in that community and they're kind of paving the way for delegate compensation. Yeah, I mean, on top of that optimism is doing some really cool stuff around different kind of separation of powers with their kind of citizens house and token voters house. And I think there's a lot of things that we can pull from these communities and learn from, whether it's to implement them ourselves or implement them differently. Yeah, and I think over time there's tons of different dows doing insanely, insanely different things.
00:37:04.830 - 00:37:18.228, Speaker D: And I think figuring out how we can apply those lessons to starknet is going to be something that just the three of us aren't going to be able to do on our own. We're really going to need a lot of community feedback, which is why we're having calls like these.
00:37:18.394 - 00:38:11.590, Speaker A: Pretty cool extending a bit from dows and ethereum and blockchain paradigm. Governance of commons is not something that is unique to blockchain systems. There are a lot of examples of trying to govern commons in the legacy world. I like to say legacy world, it's a know pediatric, but still I like saying, you know, there's a lot of example for that and going back centuries. Right. I'm curious if you have one example I really like is the mutual insurance example in France, which has a lot of interesting features and also a lot of drawbacks. I'm curious if there are also other governance mechanism, governance structures that you enjoy and that you think are interesting to draw inspiration from, or not necessarily sales.
00:38:13.000 - 00:39:13.450, Speaker C: I'll take this one. It's actually completely true. And the more you think about what a foundation is, the more it looks like a government, but it's a government about something, about a very limited aspect of something, like the entire society. So it looks very much, as you said, as like Commons management. And there is a whole breadth of literature about these things, like Eleanor won a Nobel prize, the equivalent for economists on these specific topics. And it's very interesting to look exactly at how it works in, let's say web two. For instance, if you look at the Linux Foundations foundation, if you look at the Python foundation, if you also look at other extraterritorial bodies such as ICANN or anything else, these are like the webs and the structures of power that actually underpin the entire Internet, and they do work.
00:39:13.450 - 00:39:47.860, Speaker C: So the cool thing that we have with blockchain is we have new primitives, we have new affordances that help us build different channels of governance. But I completely agree with you. It's something that we've been doing for a really long time. And it's the reason, for instance, that in the foundation board, Peter has been widely involved in web two Internet foundations such as ICANN, for instance. That's the kind of overview and experience that he can bring to the table.
00:39:50.520 - 00:39:50.932, Speaker B: Cool.
00:39:50.986 - 00:40:13.772, Speaker A: That's really interesting. Thank you. Extending from that a little bit. So you mentioned the comments about the Internet standardizations of protocols like let's say, HTTP, SMTp. This kind of stuff. This kind of stuff hasn't moved for years. It's solidified after a while and it's the basis of the Internet we have today.
00:40:13.772 - 00:41:12.670, Speaker A: And some people argue that not evolving things is what makes one substrate good for building, because then you don't have the ground shifting below you. And that's the approach that bitcoin is taking to a certain extent, right? Kind of refuses to evolve, but in a way that also makes it a very sturdy foundation for people to build on. Ethereum is still evolving, and as an ossified and solidified, I'm guessing it's way too early to solidify Starknet. Obviously it's just in alpha. So why would we talk about retiring the governance of starknet or whatever? But I'm curious if you have thoughts on this concept of functional escape velocity, whether in the sense of how it should apply or how it applies to Ethereum. And if it's something that we should have a vision for, for starknet yet, or if it's too early, does that make sense?
00:41:14.480 - 00:42:06.364, Speaker C: It's funny because it really dovetails with the talk that Vitalik gave at the CC in Paris in July 22. And the gift of the presentation was, let's simplify, Ethereum. It very much dove into the endgame article from Vitalik where he said that, okay, Ethereum is going to become sort of a settlement layer, and all the different layer twos will just publish to Ethereum. And he said, in that future, it means that the innovation will move away from l one and probably will move towards layer twos. And Ethereum has to become a bit more simple, as you mentioned, solidified. I don't think we're there yet for stocknet. I still think that the experimentation grounds.
00:42:06.412 - 00:42:09.810, Speaker A: Are still grandiose, so to speak.
00:42:10.740 - 00:42:47.212, Speaker C: But this will naturally occur as the technology, as we find the affordances and different primitives that can be used for layer two. It took a long time to understand how it works for layer one, and that's the reason a lot of other blockchains are taking inspiration from the EVM or say that theory is incompatible. It's going to be the same for layer two s and the year three s after that. So I think it very much depends on how long it takes to find the design patterns. And that's why it shouldn't be constrained right from the get go. We still have a long way to go.
00:42:47.346 - 00:43:37.976, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes sense also, and I tend to think that there is no such thing as perfect governance. Good governance is legitimate governance, which means that good governance is the governance that is recognized as good and legitimate at a given point in time by a given set of people. So it's important for governance to be able to evolve, especially for networks that are in their infancies, like Starknet. One other topic I wanted to discuss is, Devin, you mentioned all these daos that you mentioned, compound maker optimism. You mentioned the set of smart contracts they use to govern their apps, which I guess is an important part. But there's also the other part. You don't talk on the blockchain, you vote.
00:43:37.976 - 00:43:46.320, Speaker A: So where do you talk and where does the discussion for the starknet upgrades and the snps happen? Where should people go to get involved in governance?
00:43:49.620 - 00:43:51.410, Speaker D: That is a fantastic question.
00:43:53.460 - 00:43:53.824, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:43:53.862 - 00:45:17.020, Speaker D: So the place that you get involved is on the community forum. There's a new, and still is pulling up right here, but there is both snps and governance topics there. So I guess the place where things would usually start is within the snps section. People will propose starknet improvement proposals which will discussion will happen around them. And really I guess the way that I would describe starknet governance in the simplest way possible is like the Ethereum EIP process and upgrade process, except for we hold token based votes before the upgrades actually happen. So for those of you not super familiar with the EIP process, but eips are proposed, core eips, which are the ones that are actually changing the protocol itself, are proposed and they're discussed off chain within on the community forum about hey, what are we prioritizing? How would these get implemented? These eips, they get implemented onto client code and then we agree upon like okay, these five core eips we're going to bundle into a single upgrade. It's going to be shanghai hard fork and that upgrade is going to happen on this day.
00:45:17.020 - 00:46:07.820, Speaker D: So that last part where we're talking about that upgrade, this is what we're bundling together for this upgrade. We'll actually see a Starknet governance vote before that's agreed upon and we decide that we're going to have this fork happen on this day. So yeah, a large majority of Starknet governance will be taking place on the Starknet community forum. Same one that Sylv has pulled up on his screen right now if you're watching on YouTube. So if you are interested in getting involved in governance, the best way to do that is apply. Well, the best way to do that is just to get on the forum and start commenting on snps and start voicing your opinion in the governance thread. When proposals and upgrades get announced.
00:46:10.960 - 00:46:31.764, Speaker A: Do token holder vote on snps. Also, because snps and network upgrades are not the same thing. Right. An upcode upgrade is when we deploy something to the main net or testnet. Snps are mostly like conventions. There's a snip around how you do. I haven't looked at the repo in a while, but there might be snps around how you do.
00:46:31.764 - 00:46:42.010, Speaker A: You build a bridge. So it's a conventional pattern. So how do you vote on which Snip, like what is Snip 751 for example.
00:46:43.420 - 00:47:40.636, Speaker D: Sorry, you're exactly right. Token holders do not vote on standards. And the reason I was trying to draw the parallel between eips and core eips, which core eips are Ethereum improvement proposals that actually require a network upgrade. So any discussions around anything that will require an upgrade to the actual starknet network, not just new standards, anything that requires an upgrade is what will eventually be bundled into a proposal that token holders will vote on. And to be clear, token holders don't vote on individual core snps, quote unquote, token holders will only vote on the bundled upgrades. So there'll be kind of an upgrade saying update to starknet version zero point eleven. And within Starknet version zero point eleven there will be a ton of different features listed inside of that.
00:47:40.636 - 00:47:50.460, Speaker D: So these individual features aren't voted on, but the kind of aggregate features that exist within a single upgrade will be voted on in a single vote.
00:47:51.280 - 00:48:31.000, Speaker A: We were talking about test netting governance, maybe voting on names of snps, because at the end of the day when you vote on a SNP, you're just voting on the know this pattern is the number. This for snps. This can be a low stake environment to test new governance mechanism. One thing we could vote on, for example, Sean Han is saying, oh, we're saying snps, not Simps. I prefer, you know, this changed a while back and more people expressed that they preferred snps. So we went, so simps got snps and now that's snps for Starknet, Starknet improvement proposals.
00:48:31.980 - 00:49:23.550, Speaker D: I think something also that the community should be open to and us as a governance committee are open to, is having not necessarily structured votes in the same way that upgrades are going to happen. But potentially we might see a lot of community polls saying it's like, hey, how do you feel about this process? Just to kind of gauge the community that may happen through token based voting, very likely. More likely it'll happen not through token based voting and just through discussions on the community forum, but however that gets implemented. Part of participating in starknet governance is participating in these conversations, which it's really kind of a huge goal of this committee to make sure that those conversations are open and accessible for everyone that wants to, to participate in.
00:49:24.080 - 00:50:04.970, Speaker A: Amazing. So I'm guessing we're going to start seeing you more and more on these calls so that we can talk about governance, new upgrades. We talk about upgrades on these calls, but we mostly talk about it from the technical point of view. I'm guessing that now there will be less of, oh, this is the upgrade we plan and it's going to be on that date. And a bit more conversation like this is the upgrade we'd like to do. What do you think about it? Where will this happen? Will this be on public calls, closed calls? Will the builder council hold a town hall where you get to speak your voice and the builders council listen?
00:50:08.130 - 00:51:00.670, Speaker D: Yeah, I think that's like right on the money. Just in general. I think really the goal of Starknet governance and the Starknet foundation in totality is really to kind of open up these processes to the community and slowly hand over keys to the kingdom and control. I mean, if you look at Ethereum governance today, it's not the Ethereum foundation coming out and saying, hey, we're going to do this upgrade. Is everyone good with it? It's a ton of different actors talking back and forth about, hey, this upgrade should include this, this and this. And some people think that certain features should be prioritized over others. So really what Starknet governance is about is opening up conversation to the community, opening up access to really the early process of creating these upgrades.
00:51:00.670 - 00:51:18.614, Speaker D: And that's going to happen slowly over time to get started. We're really going to be focusing on voting on the bundled upgrades in aggregate. But I think, yeah, there will definitely be a lot of initiatives about opening up conversations along every step of the process.
00:51:18.812 - 00:51:59.602, Speaker A: Really cool. I also really like what you said, that the delegate system technically doesn't prohibit anyone from saying, hey, I'm going to be a delegate and I'm going to run a public town hall every two days and then I'm going to vote on what people say there. So if you think there are good mechanism for public consultation to implement, you can do it. And you can like it's a plug and play governance, that's pretty cool. I'm wondering which is something that politicians can do, at least in know, politicians can't. In France, politicians can't run a poll and say I will abide by the vote of this poll. They're prohibited from law, by law to do this.
00:51:59.602 - 00:52:02.434, Speaker A: Nothing prohibits you from doing it on Starknet, though.
00:52:02.632 - 00:52:38.030, Speaker D: I'm wondering what's the first dao that's going to get involved in starknet governance? I think that, yeah, it's a really interesting concept. And again, I think the builders council is kind of an interesting pilot to how does a voting block interact with starknet governance? And because these tools are permissionless, it's really the community's decision about do we want to support these kind of initiatives? Are we going to allow which ones are good, which ones are bad? I really think that anything can happen and it's so exciting to watch unfold.
00:52:38.930 - 00:53:18.070, Speaker A: Super cool. All right, I think we're reaching the end of this. Have, is there something we forgot you want to mention? I'm going to renew my call for questions. I've seen some observations on YouTube, but not a lot of questions. Again, it's a bit late for questions now for this call, but if you have questions for Manor Silv Devon, you can reach them on Twitter or for me, you can reach me also on Twitter, on Discord. You can also tag us in a public channel and we'll be happy to answer. The goal with this is to experiment.
00:53:18.070 - 00:53:46.154, Speaker A: We're experimenting on the technical side with Starknet. Let's experiment on how we make decisions together with governance. So get involved, voice your opinion and let's move forward in a constructive way. Wonderful. I also want to mention that it's winter and it's really unfair that menor, you're here outside enjoying the sun, but I saw you being a bit chilly, so now I feel a bit better, a bit chilly.
00:53:46.202 - 00:53:52.720, Speaker B: But you're all welcome to Tel Aviv. We have a conference in February and the weather is great.
00:53:53.410 - 00:54:22.586, Speaker A: That's true, you're right, we should talk about that. There's Saraqueware sessions at the beginning of February, so if you want to take this time to enjoy a bit of the sun, great conferences, nice talk with cool builders, be there. We'll all be there and we'll be more than happy to talk with you. Governance or other stuff. All right, people, it was nice talking with you. And on the community call front, we're going to have another call next week. Actually, we.
00:54:22.586 - 00:54:36.650, Speaker A: This call was supposed to happen last week, so we're going to have another call next week. So stay tuned. We're going to talk sequencers rust and speeding up Starknet. All right, thank you for joining. Have a good day. Cheers.
00:54:44.350 - 00:54:44.870, Speaker B: And we're.
