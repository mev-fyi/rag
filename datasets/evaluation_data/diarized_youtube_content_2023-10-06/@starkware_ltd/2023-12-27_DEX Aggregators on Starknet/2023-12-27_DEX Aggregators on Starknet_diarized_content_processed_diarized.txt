00:00:00.570 - 00:00:36.742, Speaker A: Imagine a marketplace where you can trade digital currencies directly with others. Imagine a marketplace where you can trade digital currencies directly with others without having to rely on a middleman such as a bank. That's what DEXs short for decentralized exchanges do. There are lots of different dexes on ethereum layer one, or on Starknet like for example, Jedi swap, Sith swap, my swap, and so on. Going through them manually to find the best deal would be time consuming. And that's exactly where Dex aggregators come in. They're kind of like personal shopping assistants that scout various dexes to find the best trading opportunity for you.
00:00:36.742 - 00:01:06.878, Speaker A: It's like checking flight fares on ebookers instead of going to the airline's websites individually. Alright, so let's use an example to illustrate how this works. Say I want to exchange USDC for as much ether as possible without an aggregator. I would go through the different dexs and compare the rates. Using an aggregator would save me much more time because it automatically checks different dexes. It also allows me to split my trade depending on where the rates are lowest, which results in a better overall deal. The aggregators do this by pooling liquidity from various sources.
00:01:06.878 - 00:01:43.930, Speaker A: They also enable lower gas fees by optimizing trade routes. So this means they automatically find the most efficient path for a trade across various dexes, minimizing the number of transactions and therefore reducing the overall cost in gas fees. In conclusion, Dex aggregators are super useful tools in the DeFi space. They simplify the trading process, they ensure better pricing and they make the overall experience more efficient.
