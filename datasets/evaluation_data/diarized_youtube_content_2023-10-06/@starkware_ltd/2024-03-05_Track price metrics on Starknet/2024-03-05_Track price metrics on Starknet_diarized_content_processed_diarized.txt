00:00:00.490 - 00:00:55.406, Speaker A: Hello and welcome back. I'm starting off today's video with a very big not financial advice since we'll be focusing on market information platforms on Starknet. Market information platforms on Starknet serve as information hubs for users where they can access, interact with and analyze data and analytics for their digital assets. This means that you don't have to go through your wallets manually and check your accounts one by one. In other words, market information platforms offer a single click overview, providing information for you to manage your portfolio and access data, all while offering a very user friendly interface that even tops some traditional banking front ends. For this explanation, I will be using Avenue Market, Argent portfolio, Gecko Terminal and Dex screener. Let's start off with Avenue Market.
00:00:55.406 - 00:01:32.440, Speaker A: The newly added Starknet Market shows an overview of the different tokens on Starknet. To see more details, click on the one that you're interested in. Here you'll see data such as volumes and TVL. Next, we're looking at Argent portfolio. Argent recently launched the first portfolio tracker tool on Starknet. You can simply connect your wallet, email address or starknet ID and you'll see all your tokens, AMMLP assets and JPegs. You'll be able to track your bags in a more efficient and time saving manner.
00:01:32.440 - 00:02:03.020, Speaker A: Moving on to Gecko Terminal and Dex screener on the left side. Click on Starknet to access Starknet pools. Here you'll get an over view of the different pools on Starknet. You can easily filter them to your liking. Similar to Avenue Market, you can click on a token pair for more in depth information. Now it's extremely important to do your own research and to triple check legitimacy before you confirm anything. Alright, I hope this was helpful to you and thank you very much for listening.
00:02:03.020 - 00:02:03.500, Speaker A: Bye.
