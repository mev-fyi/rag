00:00:00.250 - 00:00:40.090, Speaker A: So on the gaming vertical, that is very strong. On Starknet, we have some builders who are using session keys, because of course if you have an unchained game, you don't want to sign each individual transactions. So they implemented some session key mechanism where you can use some session keys for the duration of the game. But of course it's limited to a specific context, like it can interact only with a specific contract, only with a specific selector and so on. That's one example. Another example is of course paymaster. And we will extend the native account subtraction to also have non subtraction that will enable to send multiple transactions in parallel without having to execute them sequentially.
00:00:40.090 - 00:01:08.158, Speaker A: Another aspect we start to explore is social finance wallets and social recovery wallets. That can be very powerful with native account abstraction. Yeah, and a very cool example is cartridge. They implemented a wallet that you can, an account that you can control by unlocking your face id on your iPhone. So it's totally seedless. You don't have any seed phrase, so you just unlock your face id and you interact with your smart contract. Oh, interesting.
00:01:08.158 - 00:01:24.260, Speaker A: I mean, in that case, where are the underlying keys stored? In the secure element of the phone, basically. Yeah. It's using the curve on the iPhone and then the R one logic in Cairo. Exactly. Okay.
