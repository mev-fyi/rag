00:00:02.240 - 00:00:27.245, Speaker A: Hello and welcome back. Hi friends and welcome back. This one's for the gamers among us. Today I'm introducing you to Dojo. Dojo is a provable on chain game engine. Now let's quickly break down what that exactly means. On Chain means that all of its actions occur on the blockchain.
00:00:27.245 - 00:01:17.265, Speaker A: Provable refers to using cryptographic methods to confirm that the actions have taken place as desired. And Engine means that you don't have to start from scratch, but I'll go into more detail afterwards. Now this whole combination enables games with true ownership, interoperability and extensibility. This means that the digital assets you buy in a game actually belong to you, can be used across multiple games and allow you to create extensions on top of existing features or games. The Dojo engine provides a software framework for game developers. It has tools and libraries that prevent developers from having to start everything from scratch, such as physics, graphics and game mechanics. Very similar to how traditional game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine work.
00:01:17.265 - 00:01:58.235, Speaker A: This of course significantly reduces the building time and complexity of creating crypto games. It runs on starknet where affordable computation and the security from Ethereum enable computation hungry gaming use cases that probably wouldn't be possible on a traditional blockchain setup. Now dojo powered games like Dope Wars, Influence, Loot, Survivor from Realms, Cafe, Cosmos and many many more are setting the bar very high in this rising trend in on chain gaming. Be sure to check out Dojo and the games they are building with it and I hope to see you soon. Bye.
