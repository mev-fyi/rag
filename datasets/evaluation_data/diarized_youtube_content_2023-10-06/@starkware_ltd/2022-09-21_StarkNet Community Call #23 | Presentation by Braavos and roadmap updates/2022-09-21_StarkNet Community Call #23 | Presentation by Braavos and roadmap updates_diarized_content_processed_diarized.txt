00:00:00.330 - 00:00:33.590, Speaker A: You now be live on YouTube. There's a slight delay between Zoom and YouTube so it's about 20 seconds. Right. So for everyone who is joining us on YouTube, hi and welcome. We're going to start our 23rd community call soon. We're going to wait just a few minutes for people to connect. Today we have the bright folks at Bravos and Nostra presenting, so stick around and likewise for people on discord.
00:00:33.590 - 00:01:17.800, Speaker A: We are live for the community call. We are going to wait a bit for people to connect. If you want to see our faces and the presentation of our attendees, you should get on the YouTube link and follow the call there. I'm going to deactivate the sound when people join the room. There we go. All right, cool. Let's give this a couple more minutes.
00:01:17.800 - 00:02:11.750, Speaker A: I have usually that many people on community call. It's nice there's six of us or maybe more. I don't know if some of you are various behind the screen, but it doesn't look like it at least. All right, let's start. What do you think? Okay, let's go. So let's start our community call with just a few announcements. So today we're going to have Bravos and Nostra presenting.
00:02:11.750 - 00:02:38.302, Speaker A: Before we start and I introduce our guests, I wanted to mention a few things. The first one is that the Starknet.edu team has started a newsletter for educational sources about Cairo and Starknet. So it's free. You can subscribe very easily. I'll share the link in the YouTube description so that people can subscribe. We've sent two of these.
00:02:38.302 - 00:03:17.062, Speaker A: The id is that we want to send these once every two weeks, not more. It's always actionable items, tutorials and thing for you to learn how to code on Starknet and exchange ids. We're obviously not going to sell these emails anywhere. You can unplug whenever you want, but if you're after interesting tutorials, check it out. We're also creating a list of upcoming events and I wanted to mention that there are a bunch of meetups coming up tonight. There's going to be a meetup in Paris and tonight, well, I guess it depends on where you are in the world. But tonight in Buenos Aires.
00:03:17.062 - 00:04:05.738, Speaker A: So in the middle of the night here there's going to be another meetup in Argentina. Then tomorrow there's a meetup in Georgia, in Tvlici. Next week there's a meetup in London, in the UK and followed by. So the meetup in London is on the 29th, on the 30 September there's a meetup in Belgrade, and on the 4 October you'll get a meet up in Brussels. And finally we're going to get a meet up on the 20 eigth of October in Mexico. So if you're interested in joining any of these events, make sure you. Well, you can subscribe to the newsletter or you can look these events up online.
00:04:05.738 - 00:04:30.180, Speaker A: You'll find them very easily. There are also more meetups coming that I haven't mentioned because I don't have the information yet, but it will come soon. Also wanted to mention know, maybe there's a meetup in the city next to you, but not in your city. And you. Ah, why is there not a meetup in New York? Or why is there not a meetup in Rome or in, I don't know, which cities are you guys in?
00:04:33.270 - 00:04:34.290, Speaker B: Tel Aviv.
00:04:34.970 - 00:05:03.230, Speaker A: So why is there no meetup in Tel Aviv? Right. And maybe a good option for that is for you to throw your first meetup there. So we are super happy to assist you in doing that. If that's something that's of interest. It's not that difficult. It's just about gathering a few committee members, exchanging ids, talking things and seeing where this leads. So if this is something that sounds interesting to you, reach out.
00:05:03.230 - 00:05:23.294, Speaker A: We'll be happy to help you organize this. Cool. I think we can start. We have a few people in discord. We have a few people on YouTube. So let's go. So we're going to start today with Bravos.
00:05:23.294 - 00:05:49.340, Speaker A: So, Moti, you're from Bravos. Can you tell us a bit more about what is you do at Bravos and what Bravos does in general? Wait, I need to invite you as a speaker on discord. Where are you? Perfect. Nice. You're there. You can speak and we can hear you.
00:05:50.130 - 00:06:26.550, Speaker B: Excellent. Thank you. Thank you for the invitation. And as a side note, I must say, it's really cool to hear the vast amount of community activity that is going on, like all over the world. You just counted? I don't know, I stopped counting how many meetup only this month. And this is very cool to hear, to see the progress of the network from where it was like six, seven months ago. So extremely nice.
00:06:26.700 - 00:06:32.140, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a lot of dynamism around this.
00:06:33.150 - 00:07:06.626, Speaker B: Yeah. Cool. So, as Henry said, I'm Otti, I'm the co founder and CEO of Bravos. And I thought of sharing with you a bit today what we do at Bravos, what our goals are, what we did so far, and what we will do, or what our plans for the near future. So Henry, if this is ok, I will share a very lightweight presentation. Don't worry.
00:07:06.818 - 00:07:12.566, Speaker A: Awesome. Super excited. I think you can share your screen.
00:07:12.748 - 00:07:18.940, Speaker B: We'll take you through that. So I'm sharing my screen now. Just let me know that everyone can see that.
00:07:20.990 - 00:07:21.980, Speaker A: We can.
00:07:23.790 - 00:08:10.680, Speaker B: Very cool. So I want to start in our goal at Bravos. We are the founding team of Bravos. It's a team, we know each other, I think for almost 15 years. We walk together for many years in what you can say, a classic web two company. And when we came into the space, we found crypto, like real crypto, decentralized crypto, self custodian crypto, very intimidating, very cumbersome. Although we all have a very deep technical background, even for us, there was a learning curve in even using crypto, not to mention understanding the technology.
00:08:10.680 - 00:09:31.138, Speaker B: And our goal in Braavos is, as the slide says, is to make crypto intuitive and secure for everyday users. So even not for technical, but for everyday users that come into crypto, that they will have the power and the ability to easily take control over their assets. I think one of the amazing statistics that I learned when I came into the space is even current crypto users, the early adopters of crypto today, the vast majority of them uses centralized solutions. So we are talking about 80 90% of crypto users worldwide uses centralized solutions like Coinbase and FTX and finance and used to use Celsius and these kind of solutions. And frankly, you know, you can blame them, because currently these centralized solutions give a much better experience than, let's call it the native crypto, the decentralized crypto and the self custodial crypto. But hand in hand, they are not really crypto. And we saw that in recent events in the market and with the live example of Celsius and others.
00:09:31.138 - 00:11:03.780, Speaker B: So our goal here in Bravos is to bridge that security and that experience gap. And we have decided to build on Starknet because we feel that Starknet, besides its amazing technology, it gives a very good opportunity to scale Ethereum and blockchain at large and help us mitigate those gaps. And I will touch upon that a bit further. So really quickly, what we did so far. So first of all, when we started, we created a standardized library that enables any DAP on Starknet to connect to any wallet, both existing and future, and wallets that will come in the future. So removing the burden of handling and developing the connections to wallet to each and every DAP from the start and having a community lib which you can see the GitHub URL on the slide gets starknet that by importing a simple line of code, each and every DAP can simply connect to any wallet on Starknet. Currently there are only two.
00:11:03.780 - 00:11:57.700, Speaker B: Once we did that, we've released I think four or five months ago. The first version of the wallet was a browser extension, browser extension on Chrome with the basic functionality and some more we introduced into Starknet having nfds inside the wallet, having the classical regular image nfds, having 3d images that users can see and play with in their wallet, of course audio nfds and video nfds. So all that came with the first version. We also added support for multiple browsers. So you can access Darknet not only from Chrome but also from Firefox. Brave. And if you have to you can use edge as well.
00:11:57.700 - 00:13:31.402, Speaker B: Following that, we added a feature for developers that we call headless mode. This is for developers who use the development network, a local devnet devnet. It's unique to them and it actually allows a streamlining of automatic testing using the wallet so developers can create end to end test of their Dapps and protocols using the wallet in its full functionality without the need to break the test on each and every transaction. From there we continue to introduce transaction explainer on Stocknet. Also like the other features, we were the first to introduce that. And that was extremely important to me because when I started in crypto and I saw the things that wallet asked me to sign on, it was very non intuitive to understand what am I signing on? And it was really important to us to let the user know what the protocol or what a specific DAP requested them to do. So if they request, for example for an unlimited approval to access their funds, then the user should know that and should take a conscious decision whether to sign that transaction or not to sign that transaction.
00:13:31.402 - 00:14:46.322, Speaker B: And I think this is part of a better user experience that we are looking for bringing on Starknet. Another thing that we added is protection from transferring funds to a non existing account. We can utilize the fact that every wallet on Stocknet has an account on chain. We can verify that the destination exists even before a user sends the money and in that way we can protect users from typos or miscopying addresses, et cetera. Another thing that we did, we deployed and published our mobile wallet both for iOS and Android. Now everyone can have stock proof crypto in their pockets. And not only that, we also allow from within the wallet access to all of Starknet dapps from the mobile.
00:14:46.322 - 00:14:59.030, Speaker B: So actually this is the only way today to access, the only native way to access Stocknet from mobile, interact with dapps and sign transactions.
00:15:00.210 - 00:15:00.960, Speaker A: And.
00:15:02.930 - 00:16:28.062, Speaker B: Last lately we also added an exchange built in in the wallet itself, so users can easily swap between their assets, currently only five on Mainnet, but as the network will progress, also the assets themselves. So this is like a very short summary of what we did in the past four or five months, and maybe a bit about what we plan to do in the future. And that's mainly to focus. I would say that. I would say that up until now, we introduced and delivered the bread and butter features of a wallet, the basic one with signing and having nfts and exchange within the wallet. But our main focus now, and you will see it in the upcoming releases of Bravos on our platform, is to utilize the fact that we have a smart contract on chain that can really help us both increase user security and improve the user experience. And two classical examples are two factor authentication, or even multifactor authentication, if you will, and account segmentation.
00:16:28.062 - 00:17:35.614, Speaker B: The fact that I can limit my daily spend in a specific account. We think that these are features that users are used to from centralized solution, from web two. And here with stocknet we have a great opportunity to implement it also in a decentralized, self custodial nature. And these are just two examples of a lot more things that we plan to do in the future utilizing the smart contract nature of the wallet. And another thing is, we don't want only exchange to reside within the wallet, but also to allow users to earn yield on the tokens that they have in the wallet itself. So these are things that are on the immediate agenda with much more to come further down the road. So basically that's it.
00:17:35.614 - 00:17:42.960, Speaker B: I promised a short presentation and hopefully delivered. We'll be happy to take questions.
00:17:44.530 - 00:18:13.802, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you. Actually, I have a question, there's a question in the audience, so Fiori is asking. I have a question to the Bravos team. You said many dapps in crypto are not really decentralized. Could you explain what ensures decentralization in your app? Thank you in advance. I think globally it's interesting, smart contracts wallets are a new kind of entity, let's say.
00:18:13.802 - 00:18:25.680, Speaker A: And can you explain a bit what role Bravos the company plays for Bravos, the wallet? And how independent are the users from the developers of the smart contract, please?
00:18:28.370 - 00:19:26.420, Speaker B: Of course, naturally, currently Bravos as an entity, as a development group, is fully centralized. But since we strongly believe in decentralization, we believe that having people easily and securely having full control over their asset is a necessity, then our plan is to decentralize the protocol down the road. Of course, the smart contract layer, which is inherently decentralized, but also the applications itself. What will be exactly? The nature of decentralization is still TBD, but no doubt that that's the end goal that we strive to.
00:19:28.790 - 00:19:45.960, Speaker A: But even if you go away, if you don't consider the future right now, if I want to use my wallet without going through your servers, I can, right? I mean, I can interact with the smart contract, sign something and send it and you have no way of moving my.
00:19:48.410 - 00:20:43.740, Speaker B: Of course, of course. So thank you for this clarification, Henry, because I didn't realize that the question directs to that point. So Bravos as a company has no servers. The wallet itself is a client side wallet that communicates with the smart contract that are on the starknet blockchain and there is no intervention whatsoever from, let's call it a bravo central entity to the Bravos wallet. We don't even have statistics or analytics that we send out of the wallet that can expose anything about the user or can jeopardize in any way its security. So Bravos as a client software currently and as a smart contract on chain is completely decentralized today.
00:20:44.670 - 00:21:54.130, Speaker A: Really cool, thanks. I've heard somebody make the point that decentralization for wallets and self custody is as much of a need for users as it is a need for operators, meaning that it's important for users to be able to be sovereign with their asset. But what we see with the world today is that a lot of people are comfortable with giving trust to some entities to manipulate their assets. We can mention the traditional world, obviously, but we can also mention Coinbase, Kraken, all of these big entities. So it seems that it's important, but a lot of users maybe don't value this as much, but that the custody risk, bearing the risk of holding user asset, if you can avoid that as a company, this has a lot of value and it's a liability you don't want to take on you. Is it something you guys consider? Like the fact that we're very happy to do a wallet, but technically we have no responsibility, or a limited responsibility with safekeeping the funds of our users.
00:21:55.910 - 00:23:44.826, Speaker B: So actually we look at it from the opposite direction. So I think it's a conscious decision and this is what we believe in, that no entity should have control over your assets. I think it's as I said at the beginning and Henry, as you mentioned, this is easier for users and currently centralized solution, custodial solution that holds user money are easier to use, but they are easier to use until something happened. And I think that only in the past few months we had quite a few examples of things that happen, that the user thoughts that their funds are secured and they had no access to the fund all of a sudden. And we can mention at the beginning of the year what happened with trucker protest in Canada, that the government, in an emergency act law, decided to, without due process, to actually deplatform everyone who was suspicious to participate in the protest out of the financial system. And never mind what you think about that protest and whether these guys were right or they broke the law or whatever, but doing that without due process should alarm anyone, especially in a western democracy such as Canada. We see the war now in central Europe that prevents civilians from both sides to access their funds.
00:23:44.826 - 00:25:10.030, Speaker B: We saw in the latest crypto crash, we saw centralized entities that simply crashed and user thought that they had their funds secure and they had even a lot of funds, but actually they don't have any access to their fund and they are waiting for the core to decide what remaining of their original assets if and when they will get. So for us, it's not that it's easier to not have custody on user funds. I think it's not easier. I think that the technology and the UEX and security hurdles that we need to solve are much harder compared to centralized solutions. And they bring a real challenge into the table. But I think that if and when we will solve that, we will get a much better crypto and much better new financial ecosystem in which people on the one hand have full control over their assets, but on the other hand, they don't bear the enormous burden of understanding seed phrases and private keys and having a single small mistake, and I get all my money taken away or lost. And I think this is the real challenge that we try to take upon on Bravos.
00:25:10.850 - 00:25:44.710, Speaker A: That's really interesting and a really interesting counterpoint. Planning for the worst and planning for the long term is difficult. And I think even for web two company, it's difficult. I don't know. There are five people on this call. How many of you have set up some kind of system for whatever happened? If you disappear, who gets a hold of your email account? Have you? I have. Anyone else? Nobody.
00:25:44.710 - 00:26:40.460, Speaker A: See, so that's like, I think that these questions, as you mentioned, they're legitimately hard, because it's really hard to figure out how do we recover in the digital world when something happened in the physical world and even in web two, this is not solved. It's not really clear what happens to your Facebook account, to your Gmail account. There are some processes, but they're very opaque, they're not very transparent, and there are some tools, but we don't have the hindsight of time. You will get a very good service for what should be done with a user's email when he dies. Once, a large number of people will have died and this will take a long time because these services are much younger than the average life expectancy of a human. So I think this is, even for web two, this is an unsolved problem, and I find it fascinating that you guys are trying to tackle it.
00:26:42.290 - 00:27:29.958, Speaker B: Maybe just one small comment. I think that it's true regarding your Facebook, Instagram, et cetera account and email account, but I think when we talk about finance, it sometimes has dramatic effect on people's life. So if someone died and he has one hundred k million dollars or whatever number that you want for a specific family, it's like their entire budget and only that guy had an access to that account. Then let's call it in threatfi. There is a solution for that. But here, this is something which is simply a must in order for the system to thrive.
00:27:30.134 - 00:27:56.050, Speaker A: No, you're absolutely right. But to me, this mechanism of you die and somebody has access to your bank account. This is not a digital path, it's a paper path. It's something that existed before the Internet and we implemented something on top of it. It's not something that is digital native. And for things that are natively digital, handling death seems like a new thing to me. But you're absolutely right.
00:27:56.050 - 00:28:03.880, Speaker A: These processes, you don't need to reinvent them fully. There is something existing in tradfi and we can draw a lot of interesting ideas from this.
00:28:04.410 - 00:28:24.074, Speaker B: Yeah, so the point is that it exists in tradfi, and in order to bring the everyday users into crypto, we need to give them the same level of functionality, let's call that. But we don't have the luxury of being centralized or being custodial in real crypto.
00:28:24.202 - 00:28:32.318, Speaker A: That makes sense. Moti, thanks a lot for coming and talking with us. Where do people find you?
00:28:32.404 - 00:28:33.134, Speaker B: Or Bravos?
00:28:33.182 - 00:28:36.290, Speaker A: How do people read more things about Bravos?
00:28:37.670 - 00:29:11.520, Speaker B: So I'm at Twitter handle motilen. M-O-T-T-Y-L-E-N. Bravos is Twitter handle at my bravos. Bravos app. This is the website with links to all the apps, Chrome, store extension, Android, iOS, and also our blog posts that elaborate more on the things I touched upon in the presentation and the discussion with Henry. So if you are interested, then you are most welcome.
00:29:12.130 - 00:29:30.420, Speaker A: Fantastic. Thank you. Let's go with our second guest. Let's now welcome the team at Nostra. Hi, guys. So how many of you are there? There's 1234 people. Nice.
00:29:30.420 - 00:29:40.882, Speaker A: Can you introduce yourself, please? Oh, wait, maybe you need to talk in discord. I need to add you in discord.
00:29:40.946 - 00:29:41.560, Speaker B: Yes.
00:29:42.330 - 00:30:07.630, Speaker A: So can you raise your hand or something like that? You should be able to talk. I can see one. I can see RTP. I can see mijovic Oxtoro. So I got three people. One is missing. Olaf.
00:30:08.370 - 00:30:11.920, Speaker C: Yeah, I think he joined accidentally to this call.
00:30:12.950 - 00:30:28.440, Speaker A: Hi, I'm just listening in. Okay, fine. No problem. Okay, so welcome to the Nostra team, guys. Can you introduce yourselves in a few minutes, please?
00:30:29.690 - 00:30:48.250, Speaker D: Sure, I'll go ahead. So my name is Richard. I'm head of product at Nostra. And yeah, I just try to solve problems with the team. Got a banking background in banking. And perhaps you can tell I'm from England, London.
00:30:52.130 - 00:31:03.070, Speaker C: I can be the next. I'm the technical co founder of Tempus or Nostra. And before that I worked at Ethereum foundation on solidity.
00:31:04.850 - 00:31:05.920, Speaker A: Very nice.
00:31:08.130 - 00:31:36.918, Speaker E: Yeah, you hear me fine. I'm not sure how this double channel got perfect. My name is Tony. I'm the head of marketing at Nostra. And yeah, in the last couple of years, I was the head of communications at Hermes Network, which is a CK rollup working to scale Ethereum. So I'm quite familiar with the zero knowledge technology. Although I'm not as technical as, say, Georgia.
00:31:36.918 - 00:31:42.910, Speaker E: Yeah, very happy to be here and very bullish on the starnet ecosystem.
00:31:43.890 - 00:32:02.420, Speaker A: Super happy to have you. So thank you for joining us today. So, Nostra. I think I heard about Nostra pretty recently. Right? Is it because I think you guys rebranded, you were at Tempest before. Can you tell us a bit more about what it is you do, please?
00:32:04.550 - 00:32:46.706, Speaker D: Sure, I can take. So the team behind Nostra is Tempest. And Tempest was our first product, a fixed income product on Ethereum mainnet. And we recently rebranded to broaden the scope of our defi sort of product line. And Nostra is the first of that scope. The reason why we've done that is because as a team, we're on a mission to increase the adoption of defi and make it more accessible. And a fixed yield, sort of interest rate swap product is not quite that product that we feel is going to do that.
00:32:46.706 - 00:33:28.430, Speaker D: It could be the timing, but it's also if you think about sort of like Apple, you have iPhone, you have iPad, iMac, and so all products to penetrate different market needs and solve different problems. And so we think the same thing with Defi. And so we split up Nostra to be the liquidity layer of Starknet. Now you think about sounds good, right? What does that mean? I like to think of it like Ethereum is bringing the security layer, Starknet is the scalability layer, and Nostra is the liquidity layer. I know you like l three s and we're talking about layer threes. Well, here we go. Henry.
00:33:28.430 - 00:34:15.646, Speaker D: First and foremost, we announced a good few weeks ago about our money market product. Just think about a simple borrow and lend experience where if you have an asset you want to earn from it, you can deposit into our money market. And at the same time there's another side to that. You have people who want to perhaps express their view in the market, be that leverage, be that in any sort of way, shape or form, they want to borrow an asset. And so there's a two sided marketplace there. And so that's sort of like the kind of base layer almost of our product offering. It's also very versatile the way we thought about it.
00:34:15.646 - 00:34:49.174, Speaker D: I mean, of course it's not new. Money markets have been there since compound and rv, et cetera. But with innovation, there's always iterative improvements that we can do. And albeit Ethereum main net money markets have a limiting factor of their speed as well as transaction costs. So this is one thing that starknet enables us to do and to increase that DeFi adoption that we had a mission to.
00:34:49.372 - 00:34:55.130, Speaker A: So does this mean that you can do more with your money market protocol? You can add more logic into your transactions?
00:34:55.550 - 00:35:25.650, Speaker D: In the future, yes. In the future, yes. I mean, it makes it definitely a lot cheaper. You think about the average retail person who perhaps saves a small amount of their wages every month. You don't want to pay two pounds or $2 or $5 for a transaction. I think the average transaction on Ethereum over the last few months have been like $30. And so that's not really feasible, right? That's a large percentage of someone's craft allocation.
00:35:26.230 - 00:35:26.870, Speaker B: Makes sense.
00:35:26.940 - 00:35:33.350, Speaker A: And what kind of tokens do you guys plan on listing? Big ones. Can anyone list any token?
00:35:34.330 - 00:35:34.982, Speaker B: Yeah, sure.
00:35:35.036 - 00:36:22.594, Speaker D: So initially it's going to be sort of permissioned in the sense that we will sort of manage our risk and only sort of list high quality assets. So be it ethereum, WBTC, DAI, USDC, et cetera. But over time we want to sort of like on a roadmap to make that permissionless. And so any asset could be listed based on demand, based on the Dow, et cetera. Obviously, dow infrastructure and starknet still needs to be sort of built out. But also we have tokenized assets, right? So we have kind of four positions that people can have. You can deposit your token and do nothing with it, and we call that sort of just a simple nostril token.
00:36:22.594 - 00:36:41.462, Speaker D: Right. It could be Eth, but it's not out on the market for lending and you're not borrowing against it. So that's sort of one option. There's another one where you want to borrow against your eth. And we call that like itoken C. So it's a collateralized token. And then we have itoken.
00:36:41.462 - 00:37:07.590, Speaker D: So you're not borrowing against it, but you're lending it on the market so you can get some rates back. So we've kind of tokenized these asset positions where you won't necessarily find that on all types of market just to make it versatile and the thick and composable. Also some key features is we have sub accounts and asset tiers to help our customers and users manage their risk accordingly.
00:37:10.570 - 00:37:14.920, Speaker A: Very interesting. Thank you. But you guys also launched a stablecoin, right?
00:37:15.850 - 00:37:54.110, Speaker D: Correct? Yes. So last week we announced the first native stablecoin on Starknet, which is uno. There we go. There we go. That's party boppers. And what that is is it's an overclateralized crypto backed stablecoin. And we thought we looked at the current designs out there, and that is for us the safest sort of place to be in terms of like algo stablecoins and sort of fear backed stablecoins want it to be crypto backed one because it could be censorship resistant.
00:37:54.110 - 00:38:34.766, Speaker D: We've kind of seen what happened with the likes of other coins where there's a censorship risk. And so because of that censorship risk, we want to eliminate that. And so for now, initially, we're only going to be accepting ETH as a collateral to back Uno. So that's one key decision that we made. Another thing is that we want to integrate our stablecoin with Nostra. There needs to be some sort of synergistic benefits there. And so what we're doing is allowing our users to deposit EtH to mint Uno, but also get yield on that eth while they're using uno.
00:38:34.766 - 00:38:57.350, Speaker D: So their ETH will be going into the nostril money market, earning the yield over time that would accrue to the minter. And so we think that's really kind of unique and also beneficial in that if the person that the minter wants to spend, they're getting a yield and it's being productive in the background.
00:38:59.790 - 00:39:31.730, Speaker A: Doesn't this mean that technically, when you're depositing money and you can mint uno, I imagine you're going to pay some rate. So the rate for uno will be in competition with the rate you pay to borrow, say, stablecoins, other stablecoins in your wouldn't, shouldn't the rate of borrowing uno and the rate of borrowing, say, USDC, if it's a stable coin, shouldn't they converge?
00:39:32.310 - 00:39:55.574, Speaker D: Well, there wouldn't be any rate to borrow. You'd earn. If anything is negative. So it's going to be free to mint. There's going to be no charge to mint and no charge to redeem. Right. But in the background, where there's a yield of, say, 10%, a small percentage of that is going to Nostra as a fee.
00:39:55.574 - 00:40:00.330, Speaker D: So we're not taking any front load or front end or back end fee.
00:40:02.290 - 00:40:20.740, Speaker A: Understood. Thank you. Okay, so now I have a follow up question for your dev team. So I'm curious, who is based in London here? You, Richard, who else? Tony, you're in London or somewhere else?
00:40:22.630 - 00:40:25.842, Speaker E: I used to be pre pandemic, but no, not anymore.
00:40:25.986 - 00:40:28.840, Speaker A: Okay, and mijovic, where are you?
00:40:31.450 - 00:40:35.110, Speaker C: Yes, I'm based in Belgrade, Serbia.
00:40:35.850 - 00:40:39.820, Speaker A: Okay, so you guys are spread out. How many people are in the team?
00:40:41.070 - 00:40:56.960, Speaker C: Well, in team in total, we have, I think right now, 24 people. Development team itself is five back end and five front end. So maybe ten in total.
00:40:59.250 - 00:41:02.030, Speaker A: That's decent. And you guys all do Cairo?
00:41:03.650 - 00:41:22.034, Speaker C: Not everybody. Five people from the back end team work full time on Cairo, and front end team is working on the actual product and with a large help of, let's say, research and product team, we are very happy how we progress with Kaira.
00:41:22.162 - 00:41:46.030, Speaker A: Nice. You mentioned earlier that you worked with the ethereum foundation in the. I mean, I imagine that having to learn a new language, I don't know, how does it feel to try a new language? And how does it feel that that language is Cairo? What has been your experience so far with Cairo?
00:41:47.250 - 00:42:42.320, Speaker C: Yeah, that's a very good question. For Cairo specifically, it was very painful at the beginning because you lack some features that you are used to and you use some other languages. C plus plus solidity in my case. But for us, it's getting better and better and we learned so many new patterns that we are forced to use when we use Cairo and it went really well for us. We are very happy, but I think we'll be much more happy when Cairo 1.0 release is there. I think some parts of the code will be much simpler in our case and will look much nicer and altogether safer, let's say.
00:42:46.390 - 00:43:28.480, Speaker A: It feels a bit like we spent so much time learning this new language, learning these new patterns, and then something new comes up and it will change. But I think that's for a lot of context. That's how software development works in general and especially for younger languages. But I'm glad you guys were able to make it work. And so you guys onboarded a bunch of people to Cairo and you recently announced a 5 million ecosystem fund. Can you talk a bit more about it, what it is? How can people benefit from it? I think Richard is the right person for this question. Right.
00:43:30.690 - 00:44:07.034, Speaker D: So yeah, I'm just trying to unmute myself on the two platforms here. Yeah. So we announced our 5 million die ecosystem fund pretty shortly after we launched our brand, well launched Nostra. And the reason being is because we know that how important it is for other protocols and other projects to build on Nostra. As I said, we kind of want to position ourselves to be a liquidity layer on Starp. And so for that we believe having liquidity network effects is important, I. E.
00:44:07.034 - 00:44:38.582, Speaker D: Being fully embedded. And so we want to make sure that any projects out there in starknet ecosystem can be supported by us. Right. And if they're short on resources technically or economically, we want to support that. And so that's on the technical side as well as on the community side with a lot of things. Crypto and web three is about digital ownership, et cetera, and democratizing financial assets and self custody. So we know the importance of community.
00:44:38.582 - 00:45:06.080, Speaker D: And so for now, since we haven't open sourced our code yet, which it will be after the audit. Audit, we're sort of allocating or focusing this fund on the community. So we've got lots of missions for the community to get involved with creative means, all sorts of funding gains to help sort of cultivate that community and help support us. So yeah, that's slow down.
00:45:07.410 - 00:45:54.190, Speaker A: Very nice, thank you. So I want to come back a bit, if we can, to Cairo and your experience around it. So you have five devs working on Cairo. What was the process of getting these people on board? Did you all on board at the same time? Did you hire some people and then train them on Cairo? And what would you suggest to people to onboard people to Cairo? I think there's a connection, right. Also with your ecosystem. Part of it is to onboard people to Cairo. Any ideas on how you can leverage the grants to onboard people to Cairo?
00:45:56.130 - 00:47:28.010, Speaker C: Yeah, so for us it was most of the time, actually what happened is one of the devs from the team started earlier, started learning, and then it was much smoother experience for us because we have his experience, let's say, because he was the first one to see. But in general, after our road to learning Cairo, we actually found that it's very important to share our experience with everybody, like in the starknet community. And we started actually writing Twitter threads on Cairo and its features. Of course, it started with very basic stuff because we think not only smart contract devs should learn Cairo sometime in future. All devs that want to learn, like web three, no matter if they already know rust or solidity. So we started with very basic stuff, but some more advanced topics are coming and we also kind of, as we mentioned about our fund, we would benefit a lot by getting more devs learning Cairo because then they can build on top of us or integrate with us, work together. And I think this can help everybody in the starknet ecosystem.
00:47:29.310 - 00:47:46.290, Speaker A: So when you're talking with a web free dev, say you meet a Webfree dev and you talk to him about what you're doing today with Cairo, how do you get him excited about that? What's better, what's exciting to you that you usually tell to people, hey, you should write Cairo. Why should people write Cairo, in your opinion?
00:47:49.030 - 00:48:20.566, Speaker C: First of all, for us it was huge benefit that we can do a lot of computation which is advanced. We have been building on, let's say Ethereum and EVM based blockchains. It has its own limitations and it's really hard to do some advanced thematics without like it's even impossible. And for some of them you need to pay huge amount of gas, which is unusable in my opinion.
00:48:20.678 - 00:48:21.594, Speaker B: So this is the first.
00:48:21.632 - 00:48:26.910, Speaker A: Do you have an example of things like mathematical things you can't do on the EVM and you can do in Cairo?
00:48:27.330 - 00:49:22.282, Speaker C: Yeah, for example, if you look at the formula, I will mention the third team here, for example, seedswap and the exchange they are building. For example, the formula they used. It's impossible to calculate on EVM blockchain because it has not square roots, but like third grade rules and stuff like that. Also, Cairo is basically the only way right now to build on Starknet. And I think there are some efforts to translate some other languages to Cairo, but I think it's much easier to write actually native code because you can benefit of a lot of different things. And of course I really believe that Starknet is the choice for layer two. That's just my opinion.
00:49:22.282 - 00:49:24.900, Speaker C: So it's not any advice to anybody else.
00:49:26.070 - 00:50:05.274, Speaker A: Cool, thank you. So I obviously tend to agree with you. I like Starknet also, still, I think that it's nice, we have a nice platform, it works. You can write provable code, you can do a lot of interesting things and a lot of interesting mathematics, but it's still a network. And a network has value when it has participants and it has a vibrant community and it's something that we need to cultivate. We need to grow the community around Starknet, around Cairo. And to a large extent you guys have the same thing around Nostra.
00:50:05.274 - 00:50:27.030, Speaker A: You're trying to grow the community around Nostra to get more people to integrate it, to use it. I'm curious if you have some. What's your approach towards building a community around Nostra? If people want to join the community, how would they say, what's your call to action to them? When people say, hey, I like what you do, what's the next step for them to get involved?
00:50:29.290 - 00:50:32.230, Speaker E: I guess I'll take this one. That's.
00:50:34.730 - 00:50:35.046, Speaker B: Mean.
00:50:35.068 - 00:52:04.050, Speaker E: Like, I don't want to sound too much like this, like Silicon Valley ish, the series, not the bay, but it just comes down to connecting people, right? We live in a time just full of distractions. There's people competing for your attention. There's always this new thing coming to give you dopamine. But if we manage to create a place where people can have fun and just enjoy the vibe and the memes and you find maybe a good environment to collaborate with others towards common goals, that's when you found a community you like, right? And I think our task, as I don't even know how to call it, like web three marketeers or whatever, is to facilitate these connections, right? To make a cool server, a cool place to hang out and to meet others and enable participations. Listen constantly to the community members and be, say, open to experiment with them and to co create with them and let them expand this brand that we created at the beginning, but just let them expand it and turn it into something bigger, turn it maybe into a culture. Probably my favorite sentence that I keep reading from. One of the community leads in the Nostra Discord server, which we call La Familia.
00:52:04.050 - 00:52:32.942, Speaker E: He keeps saying, we're building this together and I love that because it captures perfectly this new way of building community it's not a team telling setting this up. We're doing this actually together. And the good thing also is there's plenty of options. There's a place for you, there's a place for everyone. So you may try a discord server or a telegram group. You may not like the vibe or the means or whatever. That's no problem.
00:52:32.942 - 00:52:57.800, Speaker E: There's literally thousands of places around, so you can try until you find a place that resonates with you. And speaking of our say, if you want to try out where we're cooking at La Familia, just head to Nostra finance and you'll find a big discord button. Hit it, join the server and let's see if you enjoy the game. We are waiting for you. As my t shirt in Starnet said, as well.
00:52:58.490 - 00:53:03.000, Speaker A: Nice. And if I design a cool meme, will I get a shirt with the meme on top of it?
00:53:03.850 - 00:53:18.250, Speaker E: Well, actually, we had already won first, like, some meme competition, and we may turn those memes into t shirts in the not so distant future. So, yeah, you may as well submit yours.
00:53:19.150 - 00:53:48.262, Speaker A: Very nice, guys. We're reaching the end of our community call. I want to thank you for joining all three of you. And Moti from Bravos from joining earlier. I will conclude this community call by saying, again, we didn't talk that much about technical stuff. Zero point ten is behind us. There was a big announcement last week about Cairo 1.0.
00:53:48.262 - 00:54:24.014, Speaker A: We didn't talk about it this week. If it's something that is of interest to you, dear listener, please let us know. The goal of this community call is kind of like what Tony said. We're doing this together. So we get cool builders from the ecosystem presenting what they're working on. Sometimes we get architects or engineers from Starquire presenting what they're doing or presenting the roadmap. Let us know what you like and what you want to listen, and let's have the next community call fit what you guys want to hear.
00:54:24.014 - 00:54:30.400, Speaker A: Anyway, thanks again to our guests, and I hope everyone has a great week. See you soon.
00:54:31.250 - 00:54:31.898, Speaker B: Cheers.
00:54:31.994 - 00:54:32.650, Speaker A: Bye bye.
00:54:32.730 - 00:54:33.454, Speaker E: Thank you.
00:54:33.572 - 00:54:34.970, Speaker D: Thank you. Bye.
