00:00:02.240 - 00:00:44.386, Speaker A: Take your time, bud. Our brains have gotten so used to the satisfaction of watching YouTube videos or scrolling through TikTok and Instagram for hours on end, to an extent where some of us can't even motivate ourselves to exercise or read a book or just go outside, which is really tragic because there's so much more to life than just being glued to your phone all day, every day. The good news is there is a solution for you to improve your relationship with your phone. And that's focus tree. Focus tree offers a gamified approach where you can earn tiles by focusing. And these tiles are part of a garden that you can create with your friends or communities. Now I'll show you what that looks like.
00:00:44.386 - 00:01:09.344, Speaker A: First things first. Head on over to whatever app store it is that you use and download focus tree. For the beginning, just follow the instructions on screen and then you'll probably end up here. So this is the focus area. Here you can choose a time that determines how long you will be focusing. And right next to it, you have the gardens that you are a part of. So in my case, darknet and Emerald Grove for my Baldur's gate friends.
00:01:09.344 - 00:01:45.844, Speaker A: And when you press on edit, you can actually see these gardens. This one's still fairly small, but once you focus, you can collect these tiles that you can see down here, and then you can simply add them to your garden as you wish, and you can create a really cool little world. And then next to that, you have an overview of all your tiles that you've collected over time. Some of them are very rare tiles that you can mint. For example, this one, the red Bridge. And the cool thing is that they're all part of a theme. So for example, vikings or pirates or ancient Egypt and things like that.
00:01:45.844 - 00:02:20.722, Speaker A: Then next to it are the leagues. You can join a league once you've invited three or more friends. And then next to that is the airdrop area where you can find information on that. And let's say today I want to focus for ten more minutes. I choose ten minutes and I click focus. And then once you've finished focusing, you can scratch to reveal your tile, and then you can continue. You can see your streak, your points and water levels, and then you can go ahead and add that new tile to your garden.
00:02:20.722 - 00:02:37.306, Speaker A: So this is how focus tree works. And I hope this reminded you of all your tasks that you've been putting off for weeks. And. Yeah, what are you waiting for? Download it. Focus. Get your shit done and everyone's happy. All right, thank you very much for tuning in and talk to you soon.
00:02:37.306 - 00:02:37.714, Speaker A: Bye.
