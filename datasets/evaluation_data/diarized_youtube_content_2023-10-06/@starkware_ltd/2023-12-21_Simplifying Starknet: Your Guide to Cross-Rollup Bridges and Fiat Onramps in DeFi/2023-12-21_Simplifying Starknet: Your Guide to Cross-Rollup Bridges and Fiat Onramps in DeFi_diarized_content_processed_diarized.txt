00:00:00.600 - 00:00:47.855, Speaker A: Following up on my recent videos about AMMS and Dex aggregators, we're continuing on the DEFI path. Today's topics are cross rollup bridges and on ramps. Cross rollup bridges are apps that allow for the transfer of funds between different layer 2s, and on ramps allow users to convert their fiat currency like US Dollars, Swiss Francs euros directly from their credit card or bank account into cryptocurrency. Quick disclaimer, this is not financial advice. In other words, onramps open the gate from web2 to web3, whereas cross roller bridges allow movement between the different layer 2s on Starknet. There are quite a few onramps currently running on mainnet, such as RAMP, BankSA, Xbank, or the Centralized Exchange Integration OkX. For Crossrollup bridges we have Rhinofi, Orbiter Layer Swap, and more.
00:00:47.855 - 00:01:35.595, Speaker A: Now let's dive into crossrollup bridges. Their main benefits include interoperability by enabling seamless transactions between different layer 2s, increased liquidity by making asset transfer across chains easier, reduced transaction fees compared to operating within a single chain, and enhanced user experience by providing more and simplified options and flexibility in asset management. The downside is that there are more trust assumptions compared to a native canonical bridge. To better understand how cross roller bridges work, let's take rhinofi as an example. To start, head to App Rhino Fi and from there you can specify the amount and token you want to bridge. Then you'll choose the origin of your transaction and which L2 you want to bridge to. As soon as that's done, go ahead and click Bridge.
00:01:35.595 - 00:01:43.415, Speaker A: Approve it in your wallet and you're good to go. That's all for today. Thank you for listening and see you soon. Bye.
