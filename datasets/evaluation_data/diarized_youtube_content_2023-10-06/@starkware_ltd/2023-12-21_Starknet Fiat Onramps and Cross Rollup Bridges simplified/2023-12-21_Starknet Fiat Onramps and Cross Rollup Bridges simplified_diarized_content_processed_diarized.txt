00:00:00.410 - 00:00:47.850, Speaker A: Following up on my recent videos about Amms and Dex aggregators, we're continuing on the DFI path. Today's topics are crossroad bridges and onramps. Crossrolla bridges are apps that allow for the transfer of funds between different L2s, and onramps allow users to convert their fiat currency, like US dollars, swiss francs, euros directly from their credit card or bank account into cryptocurrency. Quick disclaimer, this is not financial advice. In other words, onramps open the gate from web two to web3, whereas crossrollup bridges allow movement between the different L2s. On Starknet, there are quite a few onramps currently running on main net, such as Ramp, Banksa, Xbank or the centralized exchange integration OKX. For crossrollup bridges, we have rhinofi, Orbiter, Layerswap, and more.
00:00:47.850 - 00:01:38.760, Speaker A: Now let's dive into crossrollup bridges. Their main benefits include interoperability by enabling seamless transactions between different L2s, increased liquidity by making asset transfer across chains easier, reduced transaction fees compared to operating within a single chain, and enhanced user experience by providing more and simplified options and flexibility in asset management. The downside is that there are more trust assumptions compared to a native canonical bridge. To better understand how cross roller bridges work, let's take rhinofi as an example. To start head to app rhino Phi, and from there you can specify the amount and token you want to bridge. Then you'll choose the origin of your transaction and which L2 you want to bridge to. As soon as that's done, go ahead and click bridge, approve it in your wallet and you're good to go.
00:01:38.760 - 00:01:43.450, Speaker A: That's all for today. Thank you for listening and see you soon. Bye.
