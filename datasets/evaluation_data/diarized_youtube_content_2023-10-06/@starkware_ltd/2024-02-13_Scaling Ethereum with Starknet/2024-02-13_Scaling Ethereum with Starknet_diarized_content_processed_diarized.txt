00:00:00.250 - 00:00:02.480, Speaker A: Yeah, I think we're live now, so it's good.
00:00:03.330 - 00:00:04.240, Speaker B: Hi everyone.
00:00:05.730 - 00:00:06.480, Speaker A: Hey.
00:00:14.370 - 00:00:15.134, Speaker B: Are we live?
00:00:15.172 - 00:00:16.240, Speaker A: I think we are.
00:00:17.090 - 00:00:20.880, Speaker B: I think we're live. Yeah. Awesome.
00:00:22.450 - 00:00:25.238, Speaker A: Sounds good. Okay, we are if.
00:00:25.364 - 00:00:30.600, Speaker B: Great. So Joe start. Shall we start?
00:00:32.890 - 00:00:35.750, Speaker A: I'm losing you a bit. Just the sound. So can you repeat?
00:00:36.170 - 00:00:40.422, Speaker B: I'm asking if I should start or you should start? Yeah.
00:00:40.476 - 00:01:02.094, Speaker A: Oh sure, I can start. So no worries. So yeah, thanks for having me, man. It was a pleasure always talking in person. And now we can also do live streaming, so it's always some interesting stuff on imboros side. So yeah, happy to have a chat. Also this way maybe I can do like a short start.
00:01:02.094 - 00:01:05.870, Speaker A: What do you think about Nimbora in general? Just to introduce.
00:01:08.870 - 00:01:57.460, Speaker B: Let me start. In this case, I'm just going to start and serve as the. So the first question is, let's introduce yourself very briefly. I'm going to introduce myself before. So I'm Louis, I'm the head of product market strategy at Starkware. I've been in crypto for HR for five and a half and today I'm very happy to be with my dear Eddie that now I've been knowing for like two years and a half almost since he joined the startup ecosystem and starting to work on various awesome stuff. Eddie, if you can start, introduce yourself, who you are, what you do, what Limbura does, what is your path to crypto and how you get to Starknet and why do you love it so much?
00:01:58.710 - 00:02:37.022, Speaker A: Yeah, why I'm so hooked now. My journey web3 started in 2017, 1st before that I worked like Enterprise Java, boring stuff and so on as a developer. But then an opportunity came to work on something that's called Zocratus, which some of you know as a toolbox for ZK snacks and Ethereum. So back in the day the idea was to build this high level DSL, something that Sharknet is doing this today to make basically onboarding to ZK easier. Five years ago it was know too far away. And so like that's why I decided to switch to solidity teams and spend basically there for almost two and a half years. So I was a core dev.
00:02:37.022 - 00:02:52.900, Speaker A: Basically there led something that's called sourceify, which is kind of automatic verification tool for smart contracts. And that's how the story started. And then we had the amazing stuff for something that's called D five summer. So like those who remember, who are old enough to remember.
00:02:55.190 - 00:02:58.600, Speaker B: I woke up at 05:00 a.m. To mean so things.
00:03:00.170 - 00:03:21.500, Speaker A: We had shift over the weekend who like clicks what and so on. The ApRs were crazy. I remember like first meetup we had in Croatia, there were three of us and we were pitching to ourselves because nobody knew about this. Everybody was like, okay, you're crazy. Sponsor nomics is going to die. And look, we are still building those kind of things. It takes basically a bit of faith to start.
00:03:21.500 - 00:04:01.254, Speaker A: But yeah, back in the day defi started and so on. But we are working on this protocol stuff in Ethereum foundation and it's kind of nice but it would be fun to start some product work, try something and so on. And I was a dev, usual dev, jumping into the product like waters, don't know nothing, trying to build stuff. But when you think about it, back in the day everybody was a dev. Like even community managers, everybody basically was a dev. So basically that's how we started and that's how Shardlabs basically started as a know. We basically a bunch of us gathered and started building stuff, started experimenting and then obviously during that know Shardlabs as a company grew up and so on.
00:04:01.254 - 00:04:32.766, Speaker A: We built a bunch of prototypes. One of the biggest projects basically out there was light on polygon, which is like the biggest LSD on Polygon to this day. Biggest LSD on matic. So some stuff were built that really kind of survived test of time and tried. But my personal passion was always ek because back in the day I scratched the surface with Socrates and so on. And then I think Tom had a presentation in Paris or somewhere about you know, it's becoming public and so on. Like it was pre mainnet.
00:04:32.766 - 00:05:20.740, Speaker A: I was like wait a sec, is this the thing like they managed actually to build this? It actually kind of works. I can build apps. Of course everybody was like oh just come build like Dapps and so on. And that's how basically the journey of Starknet also started. So you know how we started tackling it? First thing we want to build some defi stuff and then we figure out, oh, but there is like tooling missing so can we contribute on tooling side? So that's how we kind of started on that front and yeah, like two and a half years already I think on the ecosystem and it's been amazing to be honest because when you think about Louis also back in the day how it was and now with all these teams ecosystem, how many people there are, when I see like electric capital reports, like how many 3400 people building, it's like back in the day it was like 10, 15, 20 people. So you know everybody. So it was really good.
00:05:20.740 - 00:06:02.720, Speaker A: But yeah, the x system evolved and so that's the possibilities what we can build on top. So that's why basically the idea of Nimbora. So I know we have this meme that starting should be unaligned, ethereum unaligned. But we are trying to help it move in the wrong different direction. So the whole idea behind Nimora is actually quite simple. So the idea is we have l, we have a local liquidity there and we have this cheaper execution on l two s, in this case darkness. So why wouldn't we use that to scale this? Actually, I think you're one of the first articles I read about this was actually yours on the starware blog or something like that back in the day.
00:06:02.720 - 00:06:07.570, Speaker A: Maybe you are also to blame for the Nimora story. Who knows?
00:06:11.910 - 00:06:49.950, Speaker B: I did write a couple of articles back in the day and I'm working on making more now. Super exciting. And as you said, you've been here for a long time. You've been building a lot of tooling for the infrastructure, for the ecosystem as well as now Nimbura. I'm curious you hear more about what Nimbura actually does and what do you think that brings to the market? So I'm reading the best at the time of. Hilarious. I can't.
00:06:49.950 - 00:07:16.280, Speaker B: Oh God, I literally cannot read. Okay, I'm curious to know. So you've been an infrastructure, you've built infrastructure, you build applications. So maybe you can just walk us around. What is Mimbura and what is, from your perspective as a builder, the difference between one versus others?
00:07:17.610 - 00:07:48.482, Speaker A: Let's start with the biggest issues with you have held one and you have Starknet and so on. So what we have, the biggest issue is you have this asynchronicity on when you want to bridge from Mainnet to Starknet. It's kind of easy. You can do that relatively fast and so on. When you want to bridge back, you have to wait for proofs. So it takes some time and so on. So there is a synchronicity with this, but users don't usually understand these things and you have to explain them and then you have like l one strategies or l which works only on l one.
00:07:48.482 - 00:08:37.966, Speaker A: So how do you kind of bridge it to the users so they can use it from l two without knowing the whole bridging kind of logic, asynchronousity, having to wait for stuff, having to do these multiple steps. Can we create one click defi that moves across boundaries? So that's the idea behind iMora. So this kind of like infrastructure that basically abstracts all the bridging part, aggregates users in the batches and that way decreases the cost per user also and enables them to interact seamlessly with l mean, one of the promises of roll ups in general and Zk roll ups is to scale ethereum, and this is directly way to do so. And in this case that was kind of the liquidity defi pooling per se. When we have like five users on l two, let's say you want to borrow against liquidity on l one. We aggregate that. We've reached that as a one kind of asset.
00:08:37.966 - 00:09:07.466, Speaker A: Let's say there are five of us, everybody deposited like one eat. So we have five eat. We've reached that to l one deposit into liquidity troll, borrow l usd against that and bridge it to l two. But the issue with that is you don't know what the gas on main net will be in the future. You have delays on that and so on. So the current iteration we are building with Nimbura is actually, you don't care about l one fees, you just care about l two stuff. And we basically give you this experience, but without exposing to l one gas fees and stuff like that.
00:09:07.466 - 00:09:08.682, Speaker A: So that's what's coming.
00:09:08.736 - 00:09:49.000, Speaker B: Basically what you're describing. And if I understand correctly, in Bura, it's a one click defi, you say, but not from Starknet, it's one click defi. You're basically batching from l two to l one and back. So it start with this, but it also involves things like direct withdrawal. Right? So if I understand the Murati, basically you're trying to make talking to interaction between layers invisible for the users. Is that a correct?
00:09:49.770 - 00:10:23.634, Speaker A: When you think about the Internet, it feels kind of synchronous, but you don't know. It's kind of asynchronous. A lot of components, information going around. So why would we have to expose users to all these things? Why can't it feel like synchronous? And they're basically like, for the deposit, obviously, of the assets you deposit to l two, you don't have to care about l one. All that pieces that are moving around. And then when you want to withdraw, you're also basically l two user that wants to do this faster or slower, depending basically how much you're willing to pay. But you never should touch l one, you never should bridge and those kind of things because issues happen there.
00:10:23.634 - 00:10:50.266, Speaker A: We need to make basically these things abstracted. And one of the beauties of Starknet is account abstraction. We can do wonders with this multiples and stuff. So you can do whatever. So let's say you want to stake with lido but you don't have it. You have stables, you can do multiples here like swap with Avenue and then deposit to Nimbora vault and then we aggregate all those things and you can do multiple of these things. And that's the beauty of the whole thing.
00:10:50.266 - 00:10:54.480, Speaker A: That's why we are building onstarch. And one of the reasons basically it's really good.
00:10:56.610 - 00:11:18.440, Speaker B: It makes a lot of sense. We discussed basically your motivation historically to join Starknet. My question now is like on term of l two network infrastructure, what make you stay, what made you choose Starknet over another environment or even deploy on cross layer as many does.
00:11:19.450 - 00:11:59.106, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. I mean one of the things is community. So one of the key things you can never buy or you can never artificially create is obviously the community. When you have a strong community on the ecosystem, people that are building this, it's one of the key ingredients. And I always joke that Cairo is a feature and the bug because it's harder to get started, but once you get started you can just easily go and deploy somewhere else. You have to build on top of this. So that's why, one of the reasons we believe is because of the strong community products building on top and so on, is that basically striking is going to be here and it's going to thrive in like two, three, five years, ten years and so on.
00:11:59.106 - 00:12:31.280, Speaker A: And obviously this is the long term architecture infrastructure that we are building that we also need on the striking side because we go a step back so we can do this kind of l things and so on. But the key point would be integrating that locally to all two because let's say you will staked it, Lito, but you want to withdraw faster. You go to local decks and basically like withdraw from there. Maybe you want to do some leverage on money markets, maybe you can do it locally and so on. So Nibora can kind of use both layers to do.
00:12:39.810 - 00:13:05.686, Speaker B: Just 1 second. When it comes to Nimbura, this is currently the main project you guys are building as an app and starknet. My big question is what's the first go to market? What's the first product you're going to release or what did you release and what does it do? How can users use it? And I guess make money with it, of course.
00:13:05.788 - 00:13:48.498, Speaker A: So the idea is to target like we'll have three tiers like low risk strategies, medium risk strategies and high risk strategies. It's all about yield and getting basically assets on your like money. So the first basically ones we're going to integrate, a simple one like sdais, like reptile steeps and so on, some restaking and those kind of things. So theoretically you can kind of get exported to maybe iguare points plus some yield from like eat plus maybe some Nibora points stark. And so like there is a bunch of basically stuff bundled and for the user it will be one click. They basically just come to the UI, it will release in a couple of weeks. They choose which strategy to use and just deposit the asset and whatever asset they have in the wallet, we'll figure out the way to get it there.
00:13:48.498 - 00:14:01.580, Speaker A: And that way basically they start passive learning on this. You can kind of see like it's yearn but cross chains and so on. So you have basically strategies that can be components of both sides. So you can think about it like that.
00:14:03.470 - 00:14:07.820, Speaker B: So right now it is available and what can someone build on top of it?
00:14:08.350 - 00:14:42.254, Speaker A: I mean any yield generating strategy. So technically you can build anything. But for example, with liquid integration, the issue is Lusd, you borrow doesn't bring you yield, doesn't bring you any additional income. And then the whole kind of who pays the l one gas cost doesn't work. So what we did is we abstracted that, say, okay, we are going to take ten profit fee, 10% profit fee on l two. You basically don't pay l one gas. So all the yield stuff that basically is out there like morpho finance, like any ave lending to Ave, for example, or whatever, you can scale these things to start it.
00:14:42.254 - 00:14:55.850, Speaker A: It can be seamless for users. So let's say you have some stables you want to get exposure to aave on Mainnet, you can use it also to hit this and so on. So there can be a bunch of stuff like the possibilities are, let's say limitless on this kind of thing. So anything that generates yield.
00:14:57.070 - 00:15:01.280, Speaker B: Do you already see people building using nibira? Is it something that you hope for?
00:15:01.970 - 00:15:22.354, Speaker A: Absolutely. We just basically see the second strategy today, like some restaking stuff. Igular integration, basically. The guy, I'm amazed, to be honest. I didn't expect this to be completely frank because we released the SDK like when? Three weeks ago or something like that. And people already started building that. Three teams basically building different stuff.
00:15:22.354 - 00:15:24.386, Speaker A: I'm like amazed, to be honest.
00:15:24.488 - 00:15:27.302, Speaker B: That's amazing. Yeah, that's amazing.
00:15:27.436 - 00:15:28.440, Speaker A: What really?
00:15:30.570 - 00:15:34.360, Speaker B: It starts with free and end up being 1000 people.
00:15:34.970 - 00:15:35.720, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:15:36.090 - 00:16:00.160, Speaker B: I've been there. I don't. That makes a lot of sense. What would you wish for people to be building? What do you expect people? What is the next thing that is going to be exciting for you builders? If there's builder in the assembly right now, what kind of cool idea, what kind of value can you give them to build?
00:16:00.930 - 00:16:29.974, Speaker A: Absolutely. So one of the key points we want to iterate on is, as I mentioned, strategies on both sides. So let's say you have SDI, so you have spark on main net, you have some stables you want to basically lp spark. You get 5% on that. But then you have SDI which you can maybe lp to some decks on the, let's say a kubo or MySop or whatever, you can possibly lp there so you can get additional things. And then people build legos atop. And the whole idea for us is to expose this.
00:16:29.974 - 00:16:54.420, Speaker A: So if you're a Cairo dev, you can easily build whatever l two strategy you want. If you're a kind of solid dev, you don't even need to know basically Cairo, you can build strategies on top. Also that leverage starknet as an engine to scale, which is even more amazing because Cairo is like so good for building all the stuff on the Starknet side. But even if you don't know it in short term, you can still build stuff for the starknet users using.
00:16:54.870 - 00:17:16.966, Speaker B: Thanks to I've been to the Embira website right now I only saw liquidity. Is there others usually coming up? What can we expect? And are we expecting integration within the wallets? How do you see the future coming up?
00:17:17.148 - 00:17:56.146, Speaker A: Absolutely. So the first basically iteration would be like integrating like lidos, SDAIs and so on, restaking products, those kind of like some indexes and so on. We are discussing about those things also like getting some leverage possession from Mainet and so on. So that would be like the first step. And then obviously natively integrating this into devs because we believe, okay, well Nimbora will have its front end, you can use it from there. But it's ultimately an engine and SDK that anybody can build on top, can build on all front ends and basically can integrate into their own dapps. So what we believe will happen down the road is we're kind of building an engine to creating crosschain strategies and people will leverage this to build stuff on top and so on.
00:17:56.146 - 00:18:08.440, Speaker A: We already seeing that crazy ideas we didn't even think about that people basically are building on top, but with a simpler kind of first step would be like this simpler strategy that you will get exposure to and so on.
00:18:09.290 - 00:18:15.980, Speaker B: Amazing. We discussed partnership on there too. But do you also see partnership with l one project?
00:18:16.590 - 00:19:00.314, Speaker A: Absolutely. So like l one is part of a strategy. So l one project scaling to start net because they want to come to Starknet, but it's harder sometimes to build Cairo stuff to do all these things which they don't have a domain knowledge. We are offering them basically this to scale those l one protocols to start net directly. And then obviously we want native integrations on Starknet with Dexter's lending, borrowing markets, money markets, wallets and so on to have this natively because some stuff is happening, some new amazing thing is happening and so on on both Ethereum side and Starkin side. And I feel like Stark is finally maturing to full production version. Some people mentioned token and so on and that will open a lot of possibilities and so on.
00:19:00.314 - 00:19:06.762, Speaker A: So some call it money time, I call it production time because that will enable a lot of stuff.
00:19:06.896 - 00:19:41.442, Speaker B: Yeah, I've been the word on the map of a lot of people lately. That's quite true. There have been like a couple of memes that has been surrounding Starknet. The list align different. The more TPS daddy, the violence emojis. What sort of strikes you out the more culturally significant one. What do you think the most expressive.
00:19:41.442 - 00:19:48.440, Speaker B: What do you think about the started culture as a community and how do you see it growth in the future?
00:19:49.450 - 00:20:22.066, Speaker A: To be honest, it reminds me of Ethereum one back in the day when I joined Ethereum foundation. Basically it was a wasteland like the bear market after 2017 and so on. There wasn't a lot of builders out there and there wasn't a lot of products building on top. And the same ethos of focus on building focus on long term and not caring about short term profits, scamming people and so on. That I won't name names like some other. Basically there are some other ecosystems that kind of have more of this. We have a lot of builders that are focused here on building long term, which is good.
00:20:22.066 - 00:21:01.822, Speaker A: And I kind of feel now we are entering from this developer phase. Everything is built for developers by developers and so on. We're kind of maturing fast into this amazing ecosystem that will kind of power a lot of stuff. When you think about it. Obviously Starcray as a company is kind of like people in it and co founders event half of these things and kind of led the space forward and so on. And it's important that this builder culture is something that we enshrine and have for the future and push forward and so on. And that's what's kind of driving us also here because, like, okay, Starknet is the best technically, at this point.
00:21:01.822 - 00:21:17.400, Speaker A: Maybe in the future, all the zkvms or whatever will come to the same level, blah, blah. But you can kind of get this same feeling of builders, a lot of support that you get around and so on. It's just built differently. And that's basically.
00:21:18.650 - 00:21:21.174, Speaker B: So you prefer built differently than.
00:21:21.292 - 00:21:27.400, Speaker A: Absolutely. All of those are good mortps. Daddy was always the best.
00:21:30.090 - 00:21:43.770, Speaker B: Yeah. Let's start for you guys. That was good time. It was good time. As an ecosystem, as we say, we're growing. We keep growing all the time. Right.
00:21:43.770 - 00:22:13.160, Speaker B: And my question to you is, what kind of alpha do you have for builders out there and for the user? So it's two point. What sort would you say to newcomers that wants to build, doesn't know where to go, doesn't even know anything, wants to build a good app, make money, make a good product, make a good company, or for the user, what they should explore, what they should have fun with? Where can they also find the best opportunity, both economically for them and in term of experience?
00:22:14.170 - 00:22:30.570, Speaker A: Absolutely. Obviously. Discord. Discord. Discord is always the best answer to all those questions because our team is on Discord and we invite you all guys to join the discord and so on. So we recently just opened it. So if you join now, you're still early.
00:22:30.720 - 00:22:31.130, Speaker B: And.
00:22:31.200 - 00:23:14.250, Speaker A: Yeah, basically the idea for the strategies for people building on top is that in the future, Nibora will have its point system where basically part of our fees for the strategies and profit will be shared with them. So if you build a strategy on top, if you build the stuff on top, it will be basically shared between you and the Nimbora as a protocol and for the end users, basically like a bunch of front end that will arise from this. Because we already have builders which are building their own front end, showing this using basically directly. Or you can come to Nimbora website, which is Nimbora IO, and in like two to three weeks use all this certain kind of stuff. So it will be live, like brace with us for like two, three more weeks until we polish all the stuff and then we'll move to production.
00:23:14.750 - 00:23:26.178, Speaker B: Okay. And for the user, what can they retry and do they have good yield and do they have a way to sort of be an early participant of Nimbura?
00:23:26.374 - 00:23:56.870, Speaker A: Absolutely. So the best is to come to join the discord and then you will give you access to some of the alpha basic version of it. You need some referral key and so on to join and so you can use it. So that's basically best way to come. And then we'll progressively open it and so on. So the best place again is to come to discord and then you will get some early access. Yield obviously is going to be really interesting because we combine both l one yield plus the l two yield, which is in my opinion perfect almost.
00:23:56.870 - 00:24:26.820, Speaker A: So we get best of both worlds. So yeah, pretty soon I believe there will be a lot of demand and people like a lot of users will use this, but for them in the end it's like it's just one click. They won't need to understand all the complexity of logic. Like all this stuff is happening in background because I believe that's how we should build stuff. Usually builders build for other builders, so it's like more complex. But yeah, products are intended to be easy to use for normal people. That's kind of like my motivation and the team in general.
00:24:27.430 - 00:24:46.520, Speaker B: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. So how do you see the future of scaling onwards? What's going to get you excited? What is the next generation of stuff and what do you see the future then?
00:24:47.530 - 00:25:20.722, Speaker A: So one of the most interesting for starter in general, you will have hundreds and hundreds of roll ups and then you will have fractured liquidity. You will have a lot of chains that you need to use on your wallet. You have all this stuff that you need to change and it's like we are basically breaking the user experience a lot. So it's not really a great user experience. And on stack rate I expect a lot of l two s, l three s and so on to happen. But we need to abstract this from the users again. So I'm all basically how can we build this cross chain functionalities that users don't need to know, basically all those things.
00:25:20.722 - 00:25:55.678, Speaker A: Maybe wallet aggregation, you know, these strategies that move across darknet roll ups or upchains and whatever, and maybe even Nimbora will have its roll up in the future. We don't know. Everything is a possibility. So that's all the ideas. But in the end, kind of the north star is any basically chain you're on any wallet that you use. It's one click for you so you don't have to care about all this bridging complexity and stuff. As you know, that's quite a big goal, but I believe nothing except like huge goals and big goals is there to do.
00:25:55.678 - 00:25:56.960, Speaker A: And that's one of the.
00:25:58.930 - 00:26:05.220, Speaker B: What do you expect the Nivira chain to look like? What's the end goal there?
00:26:07.830 - 00:26:54.186, Speaker A: Yeah, Madara maybe the whole thing for the user is we need cheaper transaction cost and we basically need seamless experience and so on. So one of the ways to achieve that is go layer down or go layer up, whatever you call that, l three s and so on, or using external das like Celestia, Vale and so on. So that's active area exploration. But still, even if you go that route, I still believe that having access to public startnet and Mainnet and so on shouldn't be dampened by that. Because if we create this friction where you have to bridge if you want to get this strategy or you have to bridge there if you want to get another strategy, it won't work. And that's why Defi pooling and this pooling with faults is a key point there. So we can kind of obstruct that from the users.
00:26:54.186 - 00:27:36.106, Speaker A: But yeah, I definitely believe that some of the stuff on the Starknet side, both Madara and custom Starknet or like this volition mode and stuff, will improve user experience a lot because we'll kind of be the first ones to use. Imagine, I would say imagine, did you use maybe revolute or did you use some neo bank or earn program? You're probably just like a DJ like me, so you just stay on chain, but yeah, exactly. But basically they're like for example with this neo bank. So what usually happens when you buy crypto is they are custodian of yours and it's like, oh, you have crypto but you don't. But it's easy because it's an app, so you won't click. So imagine that. But it's of custodial, it's on chain.
00:27:36.106 - 00:28:06.230, Speaker A: Gas is abstracted from you and you kind of passively earn from this. And the basically wallet is saved on your phone and so on. And when you think about it, we are not that far from it. We basically can build this on the starting step, potentially not today, but in a couple of months, year and so on. So I believe this kind of user experience can bring us to the mass market. Obviously one roll up won't scale enough for all the users in demand, but that's why fractal scaling maybe is a solution for this.
00:28:06.380 - 00:28:21.420, Speaker B: Awesome. That makes a lot of sense. Another dimension that is quite interesting in the context of NVR is bridging. And so I'm curious, what's your thoughts on prosper bridging and how we would go.
00:28:22.450 - 00:28:53.366, Speaker A: It's a mess. It's a short answer. And yeah, because the biggest issue with all those things is, okay, l one, l two communication. You have canonical bridges, which kind of, okay, roll up underneath, kind of depends on the security of that bridge. So it's kind of one and the same with that. But let's say you want to do l two bridging, let's say from, I don't know, Polygon to Starknet to the other way around, or optimism to Starknet. How do you do that? You have to trust third party bridges, liquidity bridges, to kind of bridge from one side to the other, which is not the best.
00:28:53.366 - 00:29:20.014, Speaker A: And then basically there is a whole area of exploration now where, how do you do this? There is this proof aggregation networks. Potentially that can happen. That in my opinion, what will happen is you will have liquidity on its origin. So let's say ETH is issued on mainet, I don't know, like Stark is issued on Stark, and so on. And you won't bridge it to the other side. You will just prove you have it on that chain. You will lock it in the vault or something, so you can kind of move it from there.
00:29:20.014 - 00:29:41.510, Speaker A: And then you will have all these kind of things, intense, aggregated on some separate thing. Is it off chain? Is it a web3 or roll up or something, but stuff won't move on its own. And then you can kind of get this experience for like, it's kind of cross chain decks or whatever. I mean, you can build like a bunch of stuff there. But bridges in its core today, liquidity bridges are like cross chain dexes, let's be frank.
00:29:41.930 - 00:29:54.282, Speaker B: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And so, in the context of bridging, which one is the most interesting stack or tool you've been looking at, and.
00:29:54.336 - 00:30:26.818, Speaker A: Cross layer, I mean, you have two kind of things. You have storage proofs and those kind of things, which is kind of like a ZK focus proofs and so on. And you have economic security ones like Eigen layer and so on. I believe the answer is somewhere in between. Because, okay, like eigen layer and those kind of things, you have security guarantees, which kind of can get you to the point. But maybe combining that with storage proofs for ultimate finality could be a thing to do. Still, we didn't solve the liquidity bridging part of that, because, okay, we can transfer messages from one side to the other.
00:30:26.818 - 00:30:58.894, Speaker A: But still, how do we get this token? Let's say that is eid that is bridged to optimism is not the same Eid that is bridged to strike. And they have price discrepancies and so on. But we are basically exploring that. We're exploring like chain link, CCIP, maybe even CTP from basically circle. There is a bunch of these things. I believe the aggregation layer there would be really interesting because you have like polygon is building this kind of like aggregation layer for their own ZKVM chains. And then maybe Starknet will build that.
00:30:58.894 - 00:31:23.062, Speaker A: Optivism is building this separate clusters. Also the arbitrum, who does the connections in between? Do we do it only across layer one? Maybe. And that's basically the part we are doing now. So l one, l two communication only canonical bridges. And then basically we'll handle the rest maybe into the future. So you can kind of use, let's say you deposit on polygon. We bridge kind of this deposit to starknet and then settle it via start.
00:31:23.062 - 00:31:30.490, Speaker A: Because at one point we have to aggregate to an embroidery like layer three or Starknet or somewhere. So we have to settle this somewhere.
00:31:31.070 - 00:31:45.790, Speaker B: Makes a lot of sense. The context of existing team. Did you talk to the warm hole, et cetera, layer zero of the word. What do you think of them? How do you see them? Ac competition partners.
00:31:46.930 - 00:32:07.318, Speaker A: They're partners because we are basically doing l one, l two communication. We are building strategies on top. So we are not a bridge project per se, but obviously we have a bridging infrastructure and so on. Under the hood. We're using Stargate at this point for starting communication to l one to l two. And then down the road we'll have to partner with some of those projects. So we are talking with all of them.
00:32:07.318 - 00:32:24.954, Speaker A: But the issue with the. There are multiple parties. They have on token standards for bridging and so on. So you have ended locked ins there. It's all flavors of gray. There is no one silver, like one gold solution that works for everybody. So we'll see how it goes.
00:32:24.954 - 00:32:33.440, Speaker A: But yeah, that's definitely active ever exploration. So like Narien focusing towards Starknet and Ethereum scaling that, and then we'll figure out the rest down the.
00:32:35.490 - 00:33:01.080, Speaker B: So there is one aspect that we haven't touched so far, which is, as opposed to many solution, there is a high concept of what blockchain tends to have, which is synchronicity. And embroidery is very much into asynchronous messaging. How do you see this? What do you see what's going on there? What can we expect there?
00:33:01.690 - 00:33:28.622, Speaker A: Sure. As I mentioned, Internet is also synchronous. All the stuff that is happening kind of in normal world, non web tree world is also asynchronous. So we can either go to in the terms of blockchains or web3. We can go to Solana and just build everything there, which kind of can scale to a point, but can scale ultimately. Or we can have Ethereum roadmap, which is scaling with back in the day with sharding, now with roll ups. If you ask me, it's a flavor of the same thing.
00:33:28.622 - 00:34:01.658, Speaker A: It's a different technology. But we will basically again come to sharding at one point. But the point with the asynchronousity is you have to embrace it. Like the whole kind of thing is you have to kind of handle it in the background. For the user, though, it shouldn't be exposed and the user shouldn't be exposed to it as much as possible because users are used to getting seamless experience. Let me go a step back even to, let's say how Robinhood works. Like when you want to trade something or Robinhood or whatever, you feel it's like synchronous, but you actually don't have the.
00:34:01.658 - 00:34:06.620, Speaker A: You're kind of like creating the derivative there. Yeah, I'm going too far now, but yeah.
00:34:10.590 - 00:34:18.060, Speaker B: Super interesting. I just read a question that I found interesting or talk about, which is bitcoin scaling with Cairo. I can happily discuss it.
00:34:20.690 - 00:34:36.162, Speaker A: Actually. When you think about the design of Nimbora is similar to how beacon chain communicates, let's say lido, how basically deposits and staking and staking works. It's quite similar to that. So we already have a synchronicity in Ethereum, but people like users are not exposed to that.
00:34:36.296 - 00:35:03.470, Speaker B: Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Okay, so now we touch a lot of ingura, we touch a lot of petrol labs in context of maybe more macro or more global industry, what sort of application do you see blowing under the new upcoming bull market that will reach us one day if the God of bulls wants to got promise of a bull market.
00:35:03.540 - 00:35:47.914, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. One of the main things is this ultimate scalability of ZK. I believe, or at least I'm optimistic that this bull market, we can actually achieve the scale of ZK roll ups that are bigger than the existing optimistic and everything else. And we have that, we have rails like AWS. Was exploration basically for the Internet, for the cloud computing back in the day, because you have this seamless expansion and on demand scale, which is crucial because with blockchains at this point, we didn't have on demand scale. And then Imbora comes as a part where you step back all this layer and make it feel like it's synchronous communication and you abstract all these complexities going cross chain and so on. So that's kind of there.
00:35:47.914 - 00:36:27.960, Speaker A: And then what we can build atop is a bunch of stuff. This syncra will help you get normal users from web two that can use account obstruction wallet like in their kind of apps without even having to know all this stuff. Because gas is kind of like a feature, but it's a bug for the end user because it changes what are the fees there and so on. You need painmasters, you need wallets that work on their own, you need all these things. And Starknet is kind of promising that. And when you have multiple starknet networks that are connected via Nimbora or otherwise, well, you will have a lot of potential applications that work across shards, as I like to call them, but they're like cross roll ups, but kind of.
00:36:31.050 - 00:37:07.574, Speaker B: Mean. I just want to start touching a couple of points. The question that were asked, which I found very interesting, but there are no way to you directly, so I'm just going to answer them as they were asked, and maybe we can continue with more questions for you. First of all, there was a question, but are ZK roll up readily any better than optimistic roll up. Consider the highest cost. So a 60 if you go to l two fees right now, ZK roll up. And I have to give it to my dear colleagues at ZK sync are now cheaper than optistic roll up, and they're going to be even much cheaper under 44 four.
00:37:07.574 - 00:37:43.770, Speaker B: So are they any better? The assurance, yes and yes. And I'm writing a whole thesis about something called proverb servers I'm going to make public to the word soon, which is that VK is going to finally make a lot of ideas that we've seen in the space of crypto for a long time, revive them in a way that would make finally successful. So, yes, they are much better and to a point which is not even negotiable. Okay, so now there is another question, which was about bitcoin and bitvm. So I happen to be a bit of a bitcoin fan. I have to say. I do have proofs.
00:37:43.770 - 00:38:27.854, Speaker B: That's my personal guilty pleasure. And if you can even find video of me in 2022 arguing that bitcoin makes a better l one for settling than Ethereum. It was an Ethereum conference, and I have to admit it was not well received, but it was good. This man scanning bitcoin through Cairo, there is obviously a very short answer is yes, but I would say, by the way, it's even true only for Ethereum. I would say, also it's true for Ethereum. Things like kakawat is rocking right now to become a type two, then a type one, vkvm and zero sync is here to basically make approval. Bitcoin ready to production, which is almost ready there.
00:38:27.854 - 00:39:01.960, Speaker B: BitVM is not a roll up, just to be clear. How can I say that? It's a sort of better version of a state channel, which it's like, sort of like a fraud proof base. It's a three stick fraud up. Sort of. The reason why they use ZK is just to simplify the model they're working on. But it's basically optimistic roll up. It's not there yet.
00:39:01.960 - 00:39:31.522, Speaker B: First of all, BVM is very exciting stuff. I mean, I'm going first. BitVM is very. It's a fraudful mechanism. Citria, which is using BitVM, is a. So the reason actually, the interesting thing about BVM is that it sort of spun out from the work that zerosync did and that stockware and Mongodharis finance and co developed. So the bitcoin scaling through Caro is already happening.
00:39:31.522 - 00:40:18.610, Speaker B: It's called zero sync. And I think there is a lot more to come in that direction in the near future. So I'm very excited about this. So we kind of touched a lot of questions. Is there any questions for my dear girlfriend Eddie here, which are not the ones you know I'm going to answer because they're very annoying and not like so, but yeah. So what else can I say? I do have a couple of comments about, actually, some meta comments about the others here involving the community, because Eddie has been involved in the community for a very long time. And the person who's in charge of Nbura is someone who was also in the community and got basically aqua hired or a recruit by Eddie.
00:40:19.190 - 00:40:35.240, Speaker A: He joined the team. No, he joined. When you build stuff I don't believe in, there is a boss and there are leaders and followers and stuff. We're building it together. So that's kind of the key point and difference here. So just want to clarify that.
00:40:35.610 - 00:41:03.600, Speaker B: All right. So it's very cool when I see all those people who have been in this space for so long and finally ended up working together and building companies together and so on. This is very exciting stuff. And I find extremely fascinating to see all those guys and what Eddie and Sasha has been doing in Rio. So I want to congratulate them for their mean. Maybe Eddie has questions for.
00:41:05.330 - 00:41:31.610, Speaker A: Like, it's really interesting. As you mentioned, bitcoin that's one of the Pandora box that is going to be huge, especially if this tech starts to work where you can scale kind of bitcoin. So imagine now, like using Starknet to scale bitcoin or like zero. So to maybe even scale bitcoin at one point. So you can do with Cairo much, much more than you can do on any ZKVM. So maybe that's also one of the things what we could build in the future. I don't know.
00:41:31.610 - 00:41:45.918, Speaker A: That's a long way there. But that's why I like this egg system. It's a bit different. It's not like, oh, we have an evm, we have to be compatible with that because blah, blah, blah, that's the mainstream. But let's experiment. Let's build new things.
00:41:46.084 - 00:41:46.462, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:41:46.516 - 00:41:57.410, Speaker A: It wasn't built overnight and it wasn't built like, oh, yeah, we have this clear roadmap we are going to do. Back in the day, actually, when I was starting, I started playing with Hyperledger fabric. I don't know if you remember hyper.
00:41:58.950 - 00:41:59.970, Speaker B: Wait, I remember.
00:42:00.040 - 00:42:21.260, Speaker A: That was a mess. Yeah, that's funny when I think about it. Now, imagine if those kind of things succeeded. Enterprise change, and so what? They didn't. But because ethereum was this kind of new thing, they're trying to explore new things and was focused on ideals and trying to focus on long terms and not short terms. That's why I like starware also. And Starknet doesn't make.
00:42:24.350 - 00:43:00.630, Speaker B: Great. That makes so much mean. I would just say to the users here, to the user here, who wants to. There is a good question from Ezra. Before we end up finishing the conversation, Ezra is asking, but the scaling through starknet versus a very good question because people don't really understand what scaling means. And I love to talk about this. It's one of my favorite.
00:43:01.450 - 00:43:10.018, Speaker A: Exactly. I mean, we can run it on AWS. Why even use the blockchain? It scales. You can spin out as machine as you want.
00:43:10.204 - 00:43:44.100, Speaker B: Exactly. So this is what I really find funny, because people talk about scaling, but they kind of miss the point, which. So because, for instance, when you compare the TPS of, let's say, solana versus e versus bitcoin, I mean, you're comparing a nappa and Noren and Ferrari. I always say that sentence. I always say that because it's basically not the same thing at all. Bitcoin target machine is a raspberry PI. Ethereum is basically my MacBook Pro 2021, and Solana is a $2,000 machine per month.
00:43:44.100 - 00:44:24.926, Speaker B: And this is the machine they want to use. So the second you're still using a stronger hardware, of course you can go faster. But it's kind of funny to me that people sort of compare them out of the box and people don't understand that if you're a key nigeria, then you're not going to have a MacBook 221 because it's out of your scale. But if you are a company, even if you're a rich kid from, say, the US, even renting a $2,000 machine per month is expensive. So we're really not talking about the same thing. And where Zik comes to play and solve this is because it allows you to verify what someone did on data center and verify it on your phone. This is where the scale come from.
00:44:24.926 - 00:44:55.754, Speaker B: So Solana approach to scale. And so this is just a verification problem. But what Solana is actually optimizing for execution. And anything that Solana has been doing, other customs could do, we actually don't take that path because we think that access list is the way Solana scale is. Access list. It's a very annoying process for dev to write using it and for the front end. And we prefer to make it easy for dev to build while optimizing also for parallelization of the things.
00:44:55.754 - 00:45:14.880, Speaker B: So Solana is great tooling, but it's kind of leaky in terms of abstraction to a load of scale. We try to take another approach which will not be as leaky. So we should get to 1000 TPS by probably end of year, if. I hope so. I wouldn't touch woods. I mean, I touch wood, but I wouldn't commit to it. But it's difficult.
00:45:15.330 - 00:45:32.514, Speaker A: Mean, I wouldn't be surprised. Yeah, exactly. And one of the key points is trust. With ZK, it's trustless. That's kind of the way when you kind of generate proofs and stuff, it's completely different than Solano. Can you trust these guys who are running bit machines? It's fine. There is kind of a consensus.
00:45:32.514 - 00:45:38.680, Speaker A: You cannot have it, but still the network goes down and stuff. It's fine. It's early, but yeah.
00:45:40.090 - 00:45:59.630, Speaker B: By the way, there is someone saying I took a hit on Nigeria. Actually not. I'm not taking a hit on Nigeria. I'm actually referring to one special guy in the ecosystem. I won't name who he is. He wouldn't recognize himself, who learned to code on paper because he couldn't have access a computer. And the first line of code he ever wrote was on a five inch phone.
00:45:59.630 - 00:46:35.226, Speaker B: So it has nothing to do with saying that Nigeria doesn't have access to computers. I just mean that as a kid, Nigeria, you have of course, less likelihood of accessing the machine that you require you to run. Solana. I as myself, the angry thing of being a rich kid from France, I'm not having the capacity to buy Solana, to buy a computer at Solana. It's a joke. It's making a joke, but you know what I'm saying. And there's one question before we finish.
00:46:35.226 - 00:47:14.070, Speaker B: There is agri fired the e beggar intern who actually promoted it. Abdel became the end of ecosystem now and is doing very well. I know it was a joke, but the reason why I always think about Nigeria when I think this example is because of this guy. I won't name him because I don't know if he wants me to name you to name him, but he's a very well known figure in this technical system. And he literally told me that he learned to code on paper at 15. And I was like, what the fuck, dude, that's hardcore.
00:47:14.730 - 00:47:15.750, Speaker A: Imagine that will.
00:47:15.820 - 00:47:16.150, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:47:16.220 - 00:47:22.234, Speaker A: He will achieve much more people like, oh, my laptop is like from 2021, I need a new one.
00:47:22.432 - 00:47:47.550, Speaker B: Right. I actually want nigerian person in mind when I say a sentence. But to go back and to go back, as you said to the guy who asked me for the ebegger intern got fired. Now I got promoted. He's now in charge of all the. Now is in charge of exploration and the ecosystem team. So that's very exciting.
00:47:47.550 - 00:48:17.622, Speaker B: He actually took over my role and I moved towards you see, I free my point. You free my point. That's it. I think we covered the thing to do. Is there either the question in chat? Otherwise I think we're going to close and I want to thank you, everyone for joining and asking those fun questions and all the regulars. I have to say any, you're funny. I don't know which game is called any on the chat, but it's funny.
00:48:17.622 - 00:48:18.860, Speaker B: I did laugh a lot.
00:48:20.850 - 00:48:23.374, Speaker A: Yeah, it's always fun, like with a community like this.
00:48:23.492 - 00:48:52.230, Speaker B: Yeah. By the way, they're going to be conference talking about Nigeria. There's going to be a conference in Nigeria, I believe, in April. I'm not sure exactly the date in Lagos. So it's. Yeah, I mean, the Nigeria example is a very concrete. So thank you so much, Eddie.
00:48:52.230 - 00:49:00.970, Speaker B: Best luck for Nimbura. Nimbura is doing a really good job and I really love what you guys are building and looking forward to chat again and probably see. Are you going to be in Denver?
00:49:01.790 - 00:49:06.646, Speaker A: Absolutely. I will be in Denver. Let's meet and chat.
00:49:06.838 - 00:49:07.674, Speaker B: Exactly.
00:49:07.872 - 00:49:12.366, Speaker A: Having me pleasure as always. Like on coffee. I enjoy it every time.
00:49:12.548 - 00:49:13.280, Speaker B: Always.
00:49:13.730 - 00:49:15.360, Speaker A: That's what I like. Always.
00:49:17.890 - 00:49:37.174, Speaker B: Okay, so in this case, to all the participants who listen to us. Thank you so much for listening. Asking the body question. And I'm looking forward to my nigerian friends. As I said, I might be coming actually. And otherwise, looking forward the upcoming future of Starknet. See you guys.
00:49:37.174 - 00:49:39.058, Speaker B: Bye bye. See you. Bye.
