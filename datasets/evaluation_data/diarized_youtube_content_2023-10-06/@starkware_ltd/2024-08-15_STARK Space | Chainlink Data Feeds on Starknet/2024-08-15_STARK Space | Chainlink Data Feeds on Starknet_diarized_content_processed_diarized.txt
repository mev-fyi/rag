00:00:03.680 - 00:00:15.685, Speaker A: Good afternoon everybody, and looking forward to another Twitter spaces here on the stockware side today we have William Riley from Chainlink. William, you want to say hello and introduce yourself?
00:00:16.145 - 00:00:42.399, Speaker B: Yes, of course. Thank you for having me today. Super excited. Yeah. So, William Riley, I lead our solutions and strategic relationships partnerships over at Chainlink Labs. Really love and enjoy our partnerships with the starkware team. And yeah, been in the crypto space around seven plus years and been working at Chainlink for almost four helping Oracle adoption in this space.
00:00:42.399 - 00:00:44.595, Speaker B: So really great to be here. Thanks.
00:00:45.215 - 00:01:06.325, Speaker A: Awesome. Well, thanks for joining. Today we wanted to just talk about chainlink data fees and stock Net, specifically in the context of Chainlink supporting Stock Net. Maybe we'll start with Oracles more generally. Do you want to start with explaining the role of Oracles in the blockchain ecosystem, why they're essential?
00:01:08.985 - 00:02:25.855, Speaker B: Yeah, excellent. Great starting point. So blockchains have no conceptualization of the outside world. It's an internal ledger running 24 7, you know, processing transactions in the world that it understands when it comes to actually providing utility, allowing value transfer, the creation of financial markets, ultimately enabling smart contracts to do the very interesting things that we'd love to see them do. Whether this is a lending and borrowing market or a perpetual trading platform, or even know a, a gaming platform, they, these, these smart contracts, they need external data, they, they don't know what the weather is, they don't know what the price of Bitcoin is. So ultimately what an Oracle does is it provides data to smart contracts on a blockchain that allows them to consume and then operate, you know, their, their goals. So whether this is liquidating any type of collateral that's being lent or borrowed on chain or performing a perpetual trade in the market.
00:02:25.855 - 00:02:29.947, Speaker B: So, yeah, that's kind of the core feature of Oracles.
00:02:30.131 - 00:02:53.165, Speaker A: Yeah. So connecting this decentralized abstract blockchain world to the real world. Now, one challenge here is there's this issue of deciding what the actual state in the real world is. So how do you ensure the security and reliability of data as you provide it to blockchain networks?
00:02:53.465 - 00:03:20.351, Speaker B: Of course. Yeah. This is the hard part. Right. So when Chain Link first started getting going, we noticed a problem in the market that there was plenty of options for Oracles, but quite often people were being manipulated, taken advantage of. There was tremendous amounts of downtime or just lack of general reliability. And when you have a smart contract that needs data on chain 24 7, reliability and security.
00:03:20.351 - 00:04:07.819, Speaker B: So the actual ability to know that the data that you're consuming on chain is Accurate is of utmost importance. So Chainlink's approach is a decentralized Oracle network approach. We go for a trust minimized approach of data aggregation. So we're not just taking one party's word, we're not using one single node to deliver data to chain, and we're performing a multi aggregation process, typically in three pathways. So in terms of pricing, what we work with is premium data aggregators that are watching both centralized and decentralized markets at any given time. What they're doing is in their own proprietary method coming to an index or a spot price from the world that they see it. Now.
00:04:07.819 - 00:04:55.407, Speaker B: Any given chainlink data feed has many different data providers, sometimes it could be in the dozens, all providing their output of what a price point would be for a crypto asset. Let's just use Ethereum as example. So what we do at the data aggregation level is first they're looking at the exchanges, they're coming to their price point. Then at the node operation level, or the decentralized Oracle network, which we call DONS for short. Each one of these nodes has a subset of the data providers feeding data into them. And what they're doing at the node operator level is producing a median. Once the median is produced at the node level, there's a consensus mechanism that's done at the chainlink protocol level.
00:04:55.407 - 00:05:39.805, Speaker B: This is medianizing all the data that's coming through the nodes and then delivers the data point to the chain. This type of aggregation and methodology really inhibits any type of market manipulation of the actual data points that's being delivered to chain. And this also allows for extreme reliability. We have a minimum of 16 nodes typically per don, aggregating answers at any given time. We require a supermajority of responses. And this is allowed Chainlink to deliver data to blockchains in a highly secure, reliable way for over four years, even in periods of extreme volatility or crazy market events.
00:05:42.025 - 00:06:02.965, Speaker A: Great. Yes, something like a median. It really helps with anomalies. If somebody has an extremely mispriced asset, it's not going to pull everything if you're doing average. Yeah, perhaps. I mean, you answered this in the previous question, but some. What are some key advantages of Chainlink's decentralized Oracle network over other solutions?
00:06:03.745 - 00:06:48.821, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. Decentralization is the core vision for chainlink. Being a part of the decentralized ethos from day one has always been what we've been about. With that comes additional levels of security and reliability. Well, we're seeing others in the market, they're able to move fast. However, they typically, from our perspective, cut corners on security, reliability, they have lots of downtime issues. And then they're also, you know, incorporating data sets from folks that may be financially incentivized to manipulate the markets that they're providing data to.
00:06:48.821 - 00:07:27.595, Speaker B: So at Chainlink, we provide a gold standard of decentralization and security and reliability. We're the most used Oracle network across all of DeFi. I think we're powering somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% of DeFi at any given moment. And we've enabled trillions of dollars of value in transactional volume to flow through the Oracle networks. And at any given moment, we're securing tens of billions of dollars in the market. I mean, if you look at all the other competitors put together, ultimately they would maybe roughly equate to the amount of value that Chainlink is securing at any given time.
00:07:29.295 - 00:07:52.361, Speaker A: Very, very impressive and nice. Let's transition a bit. We talked about Chainlink at a higher level and Oracles more generally. More. Let's talk specifically about the stock net integration and perhaps we can start with how the integration of Chain link price feeds can help benefit Defi apps that exist in stocknet today.
00:07:52.553 - 00:08:50.145, Speaker B: Yeah, perfect. So one of the main benefits is as chains start to come to life, they need adoption from developers. Chainlink's user interface is the same across all deployments that we've had. So your standard Ethereum developer is going to be able to pick up the interactions with ChainLink services on StarkNet very swiftly and easily. And one of the main benefits that they get is, is not only they get access to maybe a pricing Oracle, but they also get access to things such as automation, cross chain services. There's a whole bunch of Chainlink products that these developers get to engage with. And ultimately, once you start having things like price feeds delivered to chain, you're able to start spinning up these financial markets, whether these are money markets or lending or borrowing markets, or perpetual trading markets.
00:08:51.525 - 00:09:01.905, Speaker A: Great. So maybe just a practical question. If somebody building a DEFI app in stock and is listening, how can they leverage your data feeds today?
00:09:02.685 - 00:09:40.125, Speaker B: Yeah. So if you're looking to start developing today, you can either go to Data Chain Link or Docs Chain Link and you'll have a full walkthrough of how to use and integrate Chainlink price feeds. And of course, if there's any type of difficulties in this integration process, you're more than welcome to reach out to the Chainlink team. There's intake and contact to the team forums located on these pages that I've referred to. And yeah, you're able to start integrating today. The feeds are live and running as we speak.
00:09:42.075 - 00:10:02.535, Speaker A: Great. And also people can reach out to us if they can't get through the chain link and we can make the connection too. I'm just thinking like Ethereum has very high gas fees, especially during periods of high volatility. How do you think that chain links capabilities can complement stock nets, fast transactions and low fees?
00:10:02.955 - 00:10:50.035, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. So in these periods of volatility, things often get difficult to use, which means chains like starknet with their fast transaction and low fees are able to handle and maintain this type of volatility. And ultimately chainlink being available 24,7, it just really makes it easier for Chainlink to deliver these services to StarkNet. Overall, we actually deploy quite a lot of effort to maintain our products on an ecosystem like Ethereum. So ultimately starknet's ability to have this type of architecture allows Chainlink to just be even more readily available and usable on demand.
00:10:50.575 - 00:11:19.733, Speaker A: Yeah, it makes sense. Okay, great. Yeah. And also think I was looking today since, since blobs came, transaction fees here are like. I mean subsent is extreme. Like it's sub a tenth of a cent. Even so you can get really, really creative here with even having the Oracle pricing updated as a separate transaction to the transaction to the actual defi trade.
00:11:19.733 - 00:11:43.777, Speaker A: Do some really cool stuff that maybe not be feasible in higher gas contexts. Okay, shifting more just to. Let's just dig deeper on the technical questions. So what methods does Chainlink use to gather and verify the accuracy of the off chain data? Like you described this median before, maybe you can just expand on that.
00:11:43.961 - 00:12:25.293, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, of course. So what Chainlink does is our node operators engage with premium data aggregators. So this isn't just free API pricing services. These are folks that as a data aggregator or data provider, their sole purpose is to gather market data and outputs. Now how do we verify the accuracy of this data? This goes through the aggregation methodology that I touched on before. Ultimately, if you're taking data from one single data provider, you have a couple of big issues on your hand. One, you have a centralized point of failure.
00:12:25.293 - 00:13:34.371, Speaker B: So if this data provider ever had a pause in their ability to deliver data as an output, this would subsequently impact everybody downstream. The other one is reliability. If you're only taking one source of truth for your data, you're ultimately susceptible for that entity or persons manipulating the output of the data for their benefit. Whatever, whatever benefit they may have for the outcome downstream on chain. What we do is we work with many, many different providers from all over the world and including our node operators and this disallows, you would have to have some very extreme level of collusion across the entire world to have a false output. So due to the decentralization, due to the methodologies of aggregation, this is how we're able to gather price and verify the accuracy of the data ultimately through an off chain consensus mechanism. Great.
00:13:34.403 - 00:13:55.419, Speaker A: Then you also avoid the issue of having a single point of failure and maybe that also answers like how do you handle scalability and ensuring timely data? Like if, let's go through a scenario like if a node doesn't provide the data, what are the protection mechanisms to ensure the data is still delivered?
00:13:55.587 - 00:15:25.725, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. So for like a maybe one or two nodes not being able to provide data, all of our decentralized Oracle networks, there's one created per price feed, for example. So there's a don powering what's the price of Bitcoin? Right now there's a separate don powering what's the price of Ethereum and so on and so forth. So if there was ever an issue with a don or a node of one don, it wouldn't have a rippling impact across the entire services that we provide. Now in terms of looking at just one don, if a node or two does not report this has which does happen from time to time, this has no impact on our ability to deliver pricing to chain because we do have so many nodes in the Oracle network, they're enterprise level. So we're talking about folks of T systems of Deutsche com, we've got LexisNexis, we've got AlphaNode Steakfish, some very prominent alchemy, some very prominent well known enterprise level dev operations running these known systems and they're all over the world. So if there was some type of world event or weather event that caused an outage for a node provider, the Oracle network is still providing data without fail.
00:15:25.725 - 00:15:34.725, Speaker B: Of our course of being over four years being live, we've never experienced any type of downtime when it comes to our price feeds.
00:15:35.955 - 00:15:47.135, Speaker A: That's fantastic. I mean can you talk historically about like March 202050 drop in one day. Any anecdotes on like what happened?
00:15:48.475 - 00:17:02.529, Speaker B: Yeah, but I mean ultimately it's a really good stress test on an infrastructure provider. You're seeing lots of activity on chain even though the markets are going down. So block space is being congested, people are fighting to get in. And of course having chainlinks data point for pricing available in these Moments is ultimately when they're needed the most. So we have natural, what we call gas pumping and abilities but ultimately we have the ability to dynamically shift our ability to get into a block space such that we're never booted out when we go to right to chain. So when pricing is collapsing like this and everybody's rushing to their lending markets, maybe trying to control their health or control a liquidation event or maybe get out of a market and sideline themselves, us at Chainlink, we're able to just deliver as we have, whether it's a steady market or a highly volatile market.
00:17:02.577 - 00:17:26.605, Speaker A: Like, like this day was very, very impressive. I'm sure gas fees would also be insanely high. Yeah, so you mentioned reputation systems like some of these nodes are doxed as Tier 1 infrastructure providers globally. What's the consensus algorithm that's used to maintain data integrity amongst the nodes?
00:17:27.025 - 00:18:01.637, Speaker B: Yeah, so right now we have and Chainlink has gone through many iterations of its consensus mechanism. Some years back we used something called Flux monitor. This was a direct on chain aggregation. It was extremely gas intensive. Since then we've been able to increase in decentralization and while decreasing gas costs through a new type of consensus algorithm called off chain reporting or what we call ocr. It's some really high level cryptography. It's a bit over, over my head.
00:18:01.637 - 00:19:05.543, Speaker B: We've got some really fantastic cryptographic researchers and scientists that have put it together but ultimately on the consensus algorithm level that's what's powering the chainlink decentralized Oracle networks. Today when it comes to a represent a reputation system, we're constantly evaluating and working with node operators on uptime responsiveness. Ultimately there's kind of like a health scoring that goes on in that and we're on a daily basis engaging our node operator community to ensure that they have everything they need and all the, all the support they need from us to be as responsive as possible. Lastly, you know it's only in its, I would say in its infancy but we have introduced staking and slashing as a, an improved security and consensus mechanism into some of our feeds on the Ethereum network and we do have plans to expand this out to all chains in the future.
00:19:05.719 - 00:19:14.515, Speaker A: Oh, so the slashing would happen on Ethereum like it wouldn't happen on your own decentralized network of chain.
00:19:15.015 - 00:19:22.505, Speaker B: Yeah, so it would be on a chain by chain basis and it would be value secured directly to that chain.
00:19:23.885 - 00:19:29.865, Speaker A: Okay, very, very interesting. Do you, can you share off timelines or. It's still early to tell.
00:19:30.245 - 00:19:37.665, Speaker B: Oh yeah, it's still a bit too early to tell. I wish I could to give a little bit more after today. Unfortunately can.
00:19:39.565 - 00:20:00.515, Speaker A: Okay. I wanted to also ask. A lot of times people talk about pull models versus push models with Oracles. I think you've described it, but just for the sake of the more novice listener here, do you want to describe the two differences there between Oracle models and where Chainlink sits on that spectrum?
00:20:00.855 - 00:20:53.669, Speaker B: Yeah, certainly. So there is actually to your point, there are two distinct Oracle models. And also to just be clear, Chainlink does provide both models. What I've been describing throughout our discussion today is the historic chainlink mechanism of delivering data to chain which is a push Oracle methodology. This is where data is getting written to chain based upon deviation thresholds or timed updates. So we call this a heartbeat on the time conditioned on chainlink feeds. This allows pricing to be pushed to chain and then readily available to be consumed on demand whenever an application needs it.
00:20:53.669 - 00:21:56.415, Speaker B: So if a liquidation event needs to happen on a platform such as maybe aave, they have the data point existing on chain ready for this immediately available now. Excuse me. A pull based Oracle solution essentially means that an on chain protocol or DAP is running a request response model. So it sits on chain and says hey, I would really like a price right now and then in the following block it receives a price to be useful. We see this is actually a pretty well adopted methodology for Oracles on the pullbase side for derivatives market. So perpetual trading. And in terms of Chainlink, we do provide our push based feeds, we call these data feeds, but we also have a separate product called Chainlink Data streams and this is our pool based model as well.
00:21:58.315 - 00:22:19.191, Speaker A: Cool. And I think that's another benefit of having low fees and high throughput is it makes the feasibility of a pool model more manageable for adapt that wants to just pull the prices for some specific fee that might not be on chain already and pay the gas fees without having to worry about the usable apps need to be paying for this.
00:22:19.383 - 00:22:20.635, Speaker B: Yes, exactly.
00:22:23.095 - 00:22:41.885, Speaker A: Let's just shift gears to something a bit more open ended and the future of Oracles. Yeah, we've talked a lot about defi. Can we. Do you have any ideas about innovative use cases beyond Defi Perhaps like within NFTs and gaming other applications?
00:22:42.905 - 00:23:35.091, Speaker B: Yeah, so I mean we are starting to see curiosity development as well as some implementation. Dynamic NFTs are interesting in a number of ways. This can be readily applicable to gaming environments where you have an NFT that represents, let's say a weapon or a skin or a piece of armor. And as you go throughout the game, it dynamically updates based upon your actions. This is really cool for folks in the gaming community because you can add on and actually build additional utility for these NFTs. You can sell them so you actually have ownership, then you can actually bring them to other games. So if other games have the ability to port over your nft, you can start carrying this dynamic NFT with you from game to game and it just naturally updates based on your actions.
00:23:35.091 - 00:25:04.425, Speaker B: Now it's on the gaming side if you want to look at something more tangible or in the quote unquote, the real world. Now there is interesting concepts coming out of some major car manufacturers where we could use a dynamic NFT to update the life cycle of a vehicle, whether this is maintenance records, bills of sales titles, liens, etc. And this could even go into such things as on demand insurance, which ultimately would tie it back into environmental applications. We are starting to see things like Oracles being used for insurance payments done on a blockchain where we have maybe an IoT device recording the amount of rain that's happening in a certain area. And you know, some farmers in Africa who typically don't have banking services would be allowed to complete an insurance transaction or payment based upon the amount of rain that was, you know, be captured. So all of this to say to go back to the very original point here, blockchains can do really, really cool and exciting things, but if they don't have data from the exterior world, like how much it rained in a certain part of the world, they won't be able to do that. So this is kind of some really interesting and exciting things that I'm seeing come in the market today.
00:25:05.845 - 00:25:17.665, Speaker A: Very interesting. Even on the NFT front, it just clicked for me that like an article is also, I mean a bridge between two chains is a subset of what articles do. Like if articles providing.
00:25:18.035 - 00:26:02.585, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure, yeah. Because one blockchain has no concept or understanding of what another is doing. And from my perspective you can look at push oracles, pull oracles, cross chain communications even we have automation services. At the end of the day, it's all a data feed in my perspective, it's all some exterior data set that's existing off a specific blockchain that could be readily available or useful in another one. And how it gets in lands that chain. To some points that we've talked about before, it really comes down to security and reliability and that's what chainlink focuses on.
00:26:05.525 - 00:26:17.387, Speaker A: Very interesting. Let's Talk about some of your upcoming features or improvements that you're working on. I think you mentioned a few throughout the space, both for Stockinet and for other networks in general.
00:26:17.571 - 00:27:17.455, Speaker B: For sure. Yeah. So I mean we're very, very focused on cross chain I think is extremely valuable and interesting. We're working on, you know, not only continuing to improve the security and reliability that we already offer today, we do consider Chainlink CCIP the gold standard and secure methods for delivering cross chain communications or token transfers. But we're also working on things, on enhancing the cost basis, making it more affordable for users to use, having it become faster in time to transfer things of this nature. We're very excited about, we're very focused on improving these in terms of other types of Oracle feature sets. We're really looking to expand the number of markets that we're delivering on a day by day basis.
00:27:17.455 - 00:28:05.685, Speaker B: We're also looking at how can we improve the user experience or the user interface on chain such that it unlocks new creativity and new exciting use cases on chain. Historically, for years we've provided one single price point. This would be a settled spot rate on our data streams, our pull Oracle. We are now starting to provide multivariable outputs. So we actually have a liquidity weighted bid and ask that's also provided with a spot price. So progressing in this form with more data points for developers to use and improved user interfaces, that's, that's definitely top of mind for us.
00:28:07.265 - 00:28:36.435, Speaker A: Yeah, the more granularity the possible the better. I think the Bitcoin order book having a sudden spread is very different to a much more thin token with less liquidity. Very exciting. And then yeah, just maybe as a final question before we turn to the audience, what's next for Chainlink? Like then we're talking about small product features but like bigger picture, what's the plan?
00:28:37.735 - 00:29:41.463, Speaker B: Chainlink is long term. We have a very, very strong relationships that we're developing and cultivating with institutional traditional finance players. This is from my perspective, the place to be in the future state. We already have fantastic relationships with folks like the DTCC Swift. You know, we are working with the likes of Paxos Circle, those are a bit more crypto native, but even traditional ETF providers and ETP providers like 21 shares. So seeing these folks actually have one on chain use cases or on chain data points that they're, that they're trying to deliver has become very exciting. And the discussions that we're having about their future plans of how they're going to be involved in the decentralized space in the near future.
00:29:41.463 - 00:30:07.685, Speaker B: I think this is what we're mostly focused on is how we're going to support their entrance into a decentralized world and how we can really provide the security and reliability propositions that we've allowed for Web3 and DeFi native folks for so many years to these financial incumbents, but are now entering our world and Web three.
00:30:09.665 - 00:30:31.225, Speaker A: That is very exciting. I think we all agree that tradfi onboarding is the future and to have something like chainlink providing infrastructure that is invaluable. Cool. I think though, that ends the formal questions. Do you have any perhaps comments or anything else you want to share or maybe we can turn the tables and you ask me some questions?
00:30:32.485 - 00:30:58.685, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I really enjoyed being on here today, so thanks again for inviting me. Super excited about what the world is to come for Web3 and DeFi as a whole and super excited about what's going on in your end. Do you have any kind of future visions you could share with us on the call for starknet and starkware team?
00:30:58.985 - 00:31:59.993, Speaker A: Yeah, I can talk about stock more generally. I think our first product that we shipped before StarkNet was Stark Apps app specific app chains that we would spin out. So we have that for perpetuals. The most famous One is DYDX v3. We also have that for some NFT marketplaces and the Oracle providing The pricing for DYDX v3 is chain is the chain is a chainlink Oracle. And what was really cool there was we discovered that because of the magic of ZK proofs, you could actually have multiple Oracle price updates within a proof and amortize the gas costs for all of those updates across the whole proof. So you're no longer sorry, you're no longer punished as it were, for sending us an Oracle.
00:31:59.993 - 00:33:09.413, Speaker A: Each single Oracle price update on chain, whether it's a pool or push, you have this architecture now where you send multiple price updates in one proof. That proof is then what's sent on chain. And because you're anyways verifying proof, which is roughly effectively speaking, constant gas price for verification, you actually have this benefit of yes, let's send as many price updates as possible within this proof. That was a really nice benefit we saw of the architecture originally with Stark X. Yeah, now that we've pivoted to not pivoted but added onto the stack. Starknet, like the public decentralized network, there's a lot going on in the defi space, a bunch of amms, also some perpetuals dexes and also in the stockware front, we're also very like watching closely the perpetuals and we hope to see teams using very solid and reliable oracles like Chainlink to get those perpetuals dexes running smoothly. There are, yeah, there's some non trivial challenges like ignoring even the decentralization component.
00:33:09.413 - 00:33:51.355, Speaker A: Like let's say there's a meme coin trading with low liquidity on Solana and you want to go and trade a perpetuals of that coin on Stock Net. What is the actual source of truth of what is the price that this asset is trading at? And as maybe it gets added to other exchanges or other blockchains, how do you then go and update that pricing? Interesting challenges we have and I'm sure you deal with them daily as an Oracle provider. Yeah. So we're looking forward to sort of integrations with Oracles and teams building derivatives platforms that use those sort of Oracle solutions to answer those challenging problems.
00:33:52.665 - 00:33:55.325, Speaker B: Yeah, beautiful. Yeah, exciting stuff.
00:33:56.945 - 00:34:31.235, Speaker A: Great. If people listening in have any questions, feel free to write it in the chat either on Telegram, on Twitter or on YouTube. Maybe we'll give 30 seconds for that before we wrap up. Another nice thing that I saw with the ChainLink integration is StarkNet, as is infamously known, is not EVM. So it was not a trivial integration. I don't know if you can speak about that whole journey.
00:34:31.935 - 00:35:11.535, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure, definitely. Chainlink is expanding itself beyond EVM families of chains. Starknet obviously being one of the first. You know, you guys have the Cairo language as well, so this was a unique aspect. To learn how to utilize the Cairo language within our integration and have everything flow smoothly. Definitely was a learning experience. But we're very, very happy that we went down this journey together.
00:35:13.205 - 00:35:59.505, Speaker A: Yeah, it was not an easy journey. We had the whole issue with Cairo zero that then got upgraded to Cairo one and code has to be rewritten but the code is now stable, backwards compatible. We're very happy that this journey has come to main integration. Anyways, William, thank you so much for your time. It was really great to learn about Chainlink Oracles in general and your work on Stark Net. Anybody has any questions with integrating the depth with Chainlink?

00:36:25.115 - 00:36:30.635, Speaker A: Okay. Very good. Thank you very much for your time, and have a good day, everyone.
