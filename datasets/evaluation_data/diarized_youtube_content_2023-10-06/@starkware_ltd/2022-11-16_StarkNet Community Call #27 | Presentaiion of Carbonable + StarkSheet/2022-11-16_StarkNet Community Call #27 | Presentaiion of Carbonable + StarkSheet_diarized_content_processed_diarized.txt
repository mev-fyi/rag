00:00:00.170 - 00:00:02.350, Speaker A: It's party adespati.
00:00:05.650 - 00:00:46.182, Speaker B: And we're live. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our 27th community call. I now activated this sound on Discord also, so you should be able here to hear me on Discord also, so hey, everyone, and welcome to this new community call. Um, I realized that I didn't program the community call on Discord beforehand, so that's why it may come to as a surprise to some of you. Fear not though. The call is recorded, so you'll be able to catch up later on. For today's call, we're going to have two guests, or really like a bunch of guests, but two guest projects.
00:00:46.182 - 00:00:53.680, Speaker B: We're going to have carbonable who will talk about what they are building on Starknet. Carbonable. Can you raise your hand?
00:00:55.090 - 00:00:55.706, Speaker A: Yay.
00:00:55.818 - 00:01:07.662, Speaker B: Free people. And then we're going to have Clemo to talk about Starksheet. Hello, Clemo, nice to see you. We can't hear you on Zoom.
00:01:07.806 - 00:01:13.170, Speaker C: Yeah, I was mute, but I'm here. Just make some noise when I'm not supposed to.
00:01:13.240 - 00:01:28.040, Speaker B: Awesome. If you can connect also on Discord. That's amazing. And yeah, so without further ado, let's start. So, carbonable, the floor is yours. We're lifting what it is you guys are building.
00:01:29.470 - 00:01:59.054, Speaker D: Hey, Ari, nice to be talking with you. Thanks for the opportunity. So, carbonable. Carbonable. We're a web free based platform that makes it easy to manage an end to end carbon neutrality strategy. So we have like a pioneering approach that converts carbon sequestration projects or carbon removal projects into digital assets. And by doing so, we open the door of the investment opportunity in carbon removing to individuals and companies of all sizes.
00:01:59.054 - 00:02:29.580, Speaker D: So that's the first one. Like, let's say the investment opportunity. And further, we provide a turnkey solution to companies that provides actually unparalleled benefits. So cost reduction, risk diversification, asset liquidity, optimization of the portfolio management, automated accounting, et cetera, et cetera. So all those elements, we can review them together with a closer look, if that makes sense.
00:02:30.510 - 00:02:40.240, Speaker B: Definitely. I want to hear more about it. So I guess my first question, do you guys have a slide? You want to present something or can I ask questions?
00:02:41.090 - 00:02:45.170, Speaker D: So we have a slide. Definitely. Ready. We can go through it.
00:02:45.320 - 00:02:48.066, Speaker B: Let's go. And then I'll bug you with my question later on.
00:02:48.168 - 00:02:53.230, Speaker D: Awesome. You have to activate the screen share capabilities.
00:02:53.390 - 00:02:57.262, Speaker B: I always fall for this. There you go. You should be able to do it now.
00:02:57.416 - 00:03:24.682, Speaker E: Maybe Guillaume to have a small suspense on that. We should have a very sharp presentation of carbon Abel and have the opportunity of the question of re that I'm sure will be really specified and really interesting to have something different from what we usually say. So maybe it will be interesting to have a good mix today. And. Hi everyone. By the way, I was taking care of my baby, newborn baby right now, so this is why I'm a bit late.
00:03:24.746 - 00:03:26.574, Speaker B: How old is he or her?
00:03:26.772 - 00:03:27.760, Speaker E: One month.
00:03:30.850 - 00:03:36.340, Speaker B: So you're like in that phase where you sleep fractions every day, right?
00:03:36.950 - 00:03:49.670, Speaker E: In French we say I'm touching wood because I think I have some chance. My baby only wakes up in the night, so every four or 5 hours. I think it's a benediction. So I wish.
00:03:50.170 - 00:03:51.174, Speaker B: Good for you.
00:03:51.292 - 00:03:52.486, Speaker E: Yeah, it's good for me.
00:03:52.588 - 00:03:57.558, Speaker B: Hey Ramsey, can you connect on discord also, the people can't hear you over there.
00:03:57.724 - 00:04:01.130, Speaker E: Okay, going there. No worry. Go on mute and I connect.
00:04:01.200 - 00:04:09.020, Speaker B: Thank you. Awesome. Do you guys see your screen? We can see your screen. So you can see them now.
00:04:09.550 - 00:04:57.994, Speaker D: So we're going to do it sharp. As Remy said, the idea is also to have your questions and to also have the opportunity for Baltazar and Tariq to speak more about the technical aspect of what we were building. But to give you a little bit of visibly of what coburnable is here is the presentation that we have for companies because we are also like a b, two b based company. So carbonable. We present ourselves as the carbon neutrality arm. So we help companies to achieve carbon neutrality. What we say is, you guys know as more than ever, this is the moral duty, ethical duty of everyone now to act towards climate change and to act positively towards climate change.
00:04:57.994 - 00:05:29.246, Speaker D: And what we say is if organization actually apply a real environmental leadership, it connects to their consumers. So it's a good thing to do. So that said, it's a really complex challenge to go towards carbon neutral. It might seem easy, but it's very pressing and it's very complex. It's a niche expertise. It requires a lot of resources to actually do an efficient one. It involves heavy investments, risky investments, et cetera.
00:05:29.246 - 00:06:10.350, Speaker D: And there is a big lack of transparency. All that combined is just to say, okay, they need to do so. But it's not that easy as it seems. And so what we are and who we are is really like what we say, like an arm for them to do it seamlessly and end to end. So we are the ultimate tool for effective net zero action. So from the identification of carbon removal opportunities to investment facilitation, but also like portfolio management, monitoring and brand image, we tackle the end to end journey. Let's say, towards effective net zero action.
00:06:10.350 - 00:06:39.594, Speaker D: And I would say only two more slides. So maybe people realize a little bit more what we're doing. That one, I think is really important. What we're doing is what we are saying is to do. So what we're doing really is converting carbon removal projects into a collection of digital assets. And by doing so, it unlocks unparalleled benefits for companies. So that's really what we're doing.
00:06:39.594 - 00:07:19.414, Speaker D: Instead of having $1 million, let's say project, what we say is that there are 10,000 pieces of $100. And by doing so, you make this investment opportunity available to everyone. And I think that slide also is really important for everyone to understand because we're talking about carbon removal projects. And I think for the majority of the people, it's not something that is really, let's say, known. So it's worth actually explaining what it is. A carbon removal project is when you invest in a project that actually captures carbon. And so those projects are protection of nature or regeneration of nature.
00:07:19.414 - 00:07:53.234, Speaker D: And when you finance those projects as a reward, you have like carbon credits. So that's a financial reward that exists. And so the investment opportunity here is pretty clear. If you invest in a carbon removed project, it's actually like if you were freezing carbon credits price for the time of the project. So let's say 20 to 25 years. So that's that line. If you invest in a carbon removal project versus if you buy carbon credits on the market, you will buy them at the market price.
00:07:53.234 - 00:08:43.140, Speaker D: And the market price is expected to do by 50, by 100, by 200 in the next few years. And that's based on Bloomberg, McKinsey and all other experts that analyze this market. So that big Delta here is, as an investor, is either a gain, like a revenue that you can earn, so a yield, or as a carbon offsetter, as a company, this is the cost savings. So this is the difference between what you would spend if you would actually buy carbon credits versus what you would spend if you would fund carbon removal projects. And I think we could go further along with all the different advantages of carbonable. But I think we can go to questions and explore maybe more like the technical side.
00:08:43.910 - 00:09:38.258, Speaker B: Yes, definitely. Pardon my french. Can you go back one slide? Yeah, absolutely. Sure. I'm very wary of slides with gradients and promises of huge gains. So please explain more what this is, because where is that money coming from? How can this become more? What is the funding price? What is a carbon credit in the first place? How does that money get created? Yeah, because if I understand correctly, right, you're taking a traditional finance mechanism, which is carbon credits, and you're tokenifying it and putting it on the blockchain. So essentially you're using web free as the back end for something that is more tradfi.
00:09:38.258 - 00:09:39.206, Speaker B: Right.
00:09:39.388 - 00:09:55.180, Speaker D: So you raise an important point, and I think it's important to clarify, is that we're not tokenizing the carbon credits itself. We are tokenizing the project. And that's a huge difference. We're not tokenizing the carbon credit. You have other.
00:09:55.950 - 00:10:03.886, Speaker B: Okay, so can you explain what is a carbon credit and describe an example of a project in which people invest in, please. Yeah.
00:10:03.988 - 00:10:16.482, Speaker D: So project that we support are, let's say a regeneration of nature. So, for example, it could be like a mangrove regeneration in a place where mangrove has been destroyed or project.
00:10:16.616 - 00:10:18.350, Speaker B: So like planting trees.
00:10:18.510 - 00:10:39.914, Speaker D: Exactly. For example, so that it's nature regeneration. So we regenerate, let's say a natural ecosystem. And when you do so, you have, as I said, a financial reward, which are carbon credits. So you finance this and to thank you, to finance this, you will receive carbon credits.
00:10:40.032 - 00:10:46.890, Speaker B: Where is that coming from? Who pays for that? And is it money? What is carbon credit? Pollute.
00:10:48.350 - 00:11:14.690, Speaker D: So carbon credits are definitely not a right for pollute. They're more like, actually like, let's say the opposite. What you have to pay because you pollute. So I think it has to be seen on the other way around. It's putting a price on the fact of polluting. So before they exist, they had no cost about polluting. Now it's an incentive to actually stop polluting, which is, in a way, good.
00:11:14.840 - 00:11:21.110, Speaker B: Ideally, kind of like the thing people paid way long ago when they send to the church.
00:11:22.170 - 00:11:23.302, Speaker D: I'm not aware of that.
00:11:23.356 - 00:11:56.754, Speaker B: I don't remember how this was called. You know, back in the 15 hundreds or something, there was this shift between inside Christians, between Catholics and Protestants and Protestants. One of the basis for protestant to move on is was, I think in French it's called obligation or, I don't remember, indulgence. Yes, exactly. Indulgence. I know this is not this, but if I understand correctly, like carbon credits, it's like it's a government incentive, is it something like.
00:11:56.952 - 00:12:32.662, Speaker D: So it's hard. And we enter directly into the technical part, but let's say current credits, originally they were just like. Indeed like a national based type of regulation with big polluters, big industries such as aviation symmetries, et cetera. So those guys had to respect the quota of emissions in the atmosphere. So it's like as any company you pollute by default, you cannot have a net zero company by itself. Any activity on this planet generate emissions. Now the idea is they wanted to limit those emissions and they defined quota.
00:12:32.662 - 00:12:52.626, Speaker D: If you went above, you had to pay. If you went below, you could resell your quota. Now this was like the original carbon credits. That is called the regulatory carbon credits. Now comes to play what we call like the voluntary carbon credit. And that voluntary carbon credit is applicable to all companies in the world. Anyone can actually use them.
00:12:52.626 - 00:13:00.920, Speaker D: And it's defined by the law of market law. So it's not like regulated by every country. It's just based on demand and offer.
00:13:01.290 - 00:13:20.730, Speaker B: Okay, so it's kind of like these fair trade labels. It's not something that is enforced by one specific government. It's more like something that is emergent, that defines, hey, these people are taking out carbon from the atmosphere or doing something good for the environment. So by paying this, you compensate for your impact in another bucket.
00:13:22.850 - 00:13:54.966, Speaker D: That's the way of putting it. That's a good way of putting it. The idea is you have international certifiers. So those are entities that are legally allowed to actually provide certificates for current credits. So they will study projects. They will say, okay, this project in 25 years, I as a certifier affirm that there would be 100,000 tones of co2 that would be carpetured. So you will have like 100,000 carbon credits generated by this project.
00:13:54.966 - 00:14:42.278, Speaker D: And when they do so, then it means that any company could actually buy those carbon credits and apply them to their carbon neutrality map. So they do a carbon footprint, let's say analysis. They know that they emit x quantity. They reduce the maximum of what they can because the idea is for them to reduce a maximum. And when they reach what is called the incompressible emissions, so what you cannot reduce, then you would apply compensation like carbon neutrality compensation or contribution, which are those type of carbon credits. And by doing so, you reach what we call net zero as a carbon footprint, maybe.
00:14:42.364 - 00:14:44.550, Speaker B: Okay. It's much clearer. Thank you.
00:14:44.700 - 00:15:24.890, Speaker E: I don't know if you heard me, but I wanted to react on one subject pretty precise. I think here it's important to difference what is the mission of carbon app and what is the carbon credit market. And I think the carbon credit market, we are not inventing something already exists. It's the carbon credit market. We exist because there is decarbonization project that are financed by companies. Today it's really big companies that can afford this kind of project. And there is an incentive behind the philosophy behind this incentive is to say, okay, we need to find a solution where every goods that you buy everywhere have a negative impact on the planet.
00:15:24.890 - 00:15:47.610, Speaker E: We need to find an institutions to push the companies to compensate this negative impact on the planet. And to do so. The carbon credit was the good terrorist that was placed since Kyoto. Today, what we are saying, we are expert of the field. We are like business expert. Let's say we know how it works. We don't replace everyone.
00:15:47.610 - 00:16:54.580, Speaker E: We don't want to make a new kind of carbon credit. We want to work with the people already working on the fields, with people already doing certification, with people already selling goods, and to find the solutions to fight the bullshit behind the greenwashing. How do you fund the bullshit behind the greenwashing? Is to facilitate the whole process, to facilitate and to provide traceability, remove the opacity and provide a qualitative audit that can give you status of the project at any times. Today I give you an example of a kind of issue. There's companies that finance decarbonizations and the accountings of the carbon credit is really complex. So what do the certifier is? They provide all the carbon credit at the beginning of the project where a product is supposed to durate like 20 years. So it happens sometimes that companies use carbon credits that is not absorbed by the project.
00:16:54.580 - 00:17:37.294, Speaker E: That don't make sense. Today we have something called smart contracts that enable vesting of carbon credits on a period with full liability. And there's also a way to manage the trustability and the transparency for every time a carbon credit is consumed to link it to the project from where it's minted. Here today, what we are seeing at carbonable is the issue is not on the marketplace, it's not to tokenize the carbon credits. We think that the issue is making a good supply of carbon credit, a good supply of project. Project that makes sense. And to do so, we need to work on the tokenization of what makes sense.
00:17:37.294 - 00:18:13.754, Speaker E: We don't want to put blockchain everywhere. We want to put blockchain where it makes sense. Blockchain makes sense to have trustability. Blockchain have sense to finance easily and to have a crowdfunding type of activity. Blockchain makes sense when you want to manage accountings and finance for vesting of carbon credit on a long period of time without having depending on companies, for example, carbonal today, you don't need to trust carbonable to receive your carbon credit. We manage with the certifier. It's not us.
00:18:13.754 - 00:18:24.222, Speaker E: With the project holders, we manage a contract where we attach a real contract that have been said with a smart contract. And the smart contract manage the distribution of the carbon credit.
00:18:24.356 - 00:18:50.982, Speaker B: That's really cool. So this means that technically, if you're holding the token of the investments, like say, I'm taking an example. Let's take a forest, right? Reforestation. You have a project of reforestation. If I buy the token, I'm not buying a liability to carbonable. I'm buying directly into that project of rejuvenating a forest. And as it absorbs more credit, I get to emit more carbon credit.
00:18:50.982 - 00:18:52.374, Speaker B: And that's how I benefit from it.
00:18:52.412 - 00:19:27.682, Speaker E: Is that it actually what you buy? You buy nfts from carbonal. But today, what we decided the easiest ways to work with today, what happened without carbonable? Today, if you want to invest in the nature, you have to have the capability to detect good projects. You have to have capability to finance this project, which will be huge. And you have capability to be subjected to a risk for this project. Today what we do is that. And you need to go to finance it through legal entity. For example, today, trust.
00:19:27.682 - 00:20:08.682, Speaker E: When you invest in real estate, you use an SAE or any other, for example. So today what we find is that the proof of participation, the proof of exploitation, could be incubated in an NFT. Today, what we are selling is NFT. The NFT is like a shares of a project, of a specific project. It's exactly the slide that you have on the screen that gives you all the information of the project. We decided to choose NFT because we want to build the traceability, the opacity and fight against greenwashing. But we want also to think new way of user experience for tomorrow.
00:20:08.682 - 00:20:43.946, Speaker E: Imagine tomorrow if you buy your cheese, industrial cheese at the market. You can have a QR code that provide you all the information of where these products have compensated his negative impact on the planet. The idea is to make it simple. We are a decarbonization service. As a service with all the package of finance, accountings and so on, which is actually. You were talking about paying the money to the church. It's like taxes, actually.
00:20:43.946 - 00:21:10.542, Speaker E: For example, you have buy a computer tax that you pay to contribute to. You don't know why God is taxed. Actually today, blockchain enable you to have more than taxes. That can enable you to go from end to end, from the end user, which is the consumer, to the trees being planted. I'm stopping here because I can be like sometimes long. It's a passionate.
00:21:10.606 - 00:21:39.740, Speaker B: No, it's a really interesting topic and I've been a bit stingy in my question on purpose. I think it's an interesting topic and I really want to understand it well. So I think I understand what is you guys are building. And I think we have on the call Tariq and Baltazar, who are more on the technical side. Do you guys want to talk a bit about how you guys are using Starknet for that project and what are things that work, things that work a bit less and what you guys are looking forward?
00:21:40.450 - 00:22:12.434, Speaker F: Yeah, sure. I can start. So I won't go too deeply in the technical aspects. The purpose is to show you what we do and what we use. Our GitHub repository is open source, so if you have similar needs, feel free to benchmark us. And if you have a question, please feel free to ask us now or later. So to match what Ramsier Gim said on the blockchain.
00:22:12.434 - 00:22:41.310, Speaker F: So we basically have set of four contracts to do. So the first one is the carbon project contract. So this is a token collection of a single real world funded project as described Ramzet guillum. And so far it is an ERC 721. Okay. And the second contract is basically a minter. So this is a homemade minter contract.
00:22:41.310 - 00:23:31.690, Speaker F: It allows everyone to invest into projects and it manage also a whitelist process using a Merkel tree. So both the project and the minter works in a pair. And so if we need to fund a new project, we will deploy a new pair of contracts of a minter and a project. For now we also have a third contract which is a vault. So this is a homemade vault. So it locks the user tokens for a period of times if they want to deposit in it. Of course it computes the shares for each users looking the tokens and it also deploy a vesting contract which is set up accordingly to the shares.
00:23:31.690 - 00:24:27.618, Speaker F: And finally, the last contract is a vesting contract as I described and deployed by the vault, which is basically the starkvest contract proposed by Abdel a few months ago. And it allowed to create linear vesting for each users. And users can claim directly their reward thanks to this contract. And basically we have two kind of vaults which have the common features on it. So basically the user will have the choice to lock into a vault for offsetting their credit carbon that are emitted by the real project. So to become natural carbon. Or they can also decide to lock into another vault to resell the credit carbon and have yield regarding this.
00:24:27.618 - 00:25:15.302, Speaker F: Okay. And basically the users can switch between one and other. We have a lock period to ensure, because there is a lot of process off chain for now, which are to define how many credit carbon we have to offset and how many we have to sell. So we have a locking period that is something like one month and that's it. I will finish quickly to don't take so much time. But we have also an aside contract, which is ERC 1155. We use it as a benchmark and a test to interact with all the starknet tools such as Marketplace, block explorer and so on, such as Aspec, Minsquare and Sascan.
00:25:15.302 - 00:25:29.990, Speaker F: So we mix stuff with this to ensure everyone is going fine. And we use also this contract to reward our community for now on the testnets. And that's it. I don't know if you have a question.
00:25:30.060 - 00:25:31.480, Speaker B: Fantastic. Thank you.
00:25:32.410 - 00:26:20.786, Speaker E: Quick one, Ari, just to maybe clarify for everyone that just listened to Baltesar, who are the end user of carbonable today. Just to make it clear, this is why it creates complexity from our side today we enable two kind of NFT buyer. It could be b, two b, an enterprise that want to buy NFT to get the offsets and not to get a yield or anything. And it will be the huge part of the buyer of carbonable. It's really interesting for us today because it's a big opportunity, independent from the beer or the bull market, which is really interesting. And on the other hand, you have also the consumer, the citizen that want to contribute and to have collocation of project with big company and that buy it to get rewards. Actually it's a yield.
00:26:20.786 - 00:26:59.886, Speaker E: It's like real estates. The rent come from the resale of the carbon credit to the company that want. Because the company have two way to buy carbon credit. Whether they finance a project that will enable them to get capacity during 20 years, or it's a proactive approach. They have also a reactive approach which is buy what they need year after year. So you have two kind of, maybe this small precision, just to let you, everyone understand who are the end user of carbon. Abel today and tomorrow, it could be like an infra, like from Iavi.
00:26:59.886 - 00:27:09.494, Speaker E: We are building an infra that will enable even a smart contract to call hours to have a real time compensation strategy that is in the fundamentals of project.
00:27:09.612 - 00:27:26.090, Speaker B: Yeah, that was actually going to be my next question. So you guys are using the blockchain as your back end and to facilitate a lot of market function. And I think it makes perfect sense. I'm curious what kind of integrations you're seeing with the broader blockchain ecosystem and defi ecosystem.
00:27:28.590 - 00:28:05.426, Speaker E: Short about this one. Today, carbonable is working on the fundamentals today. So we are working on the fact that we have a tool that facilitates from end to end. But we have vision about the integration at the end in the future. Today, the ESG, the social and environmental responsibility of the companies is something that is bigger and bigger. Today, some companies put it at the same level as profit. But on profit you have SAP, you have a bunch of product of it tools that enable you to pilot your profit.
00:28:05.426 - 00:28:57.966, Speaker E: On ASG, there is a lot of money, but there is only excel that rule everything. It's good, but it implies a lot of responsibility, of pressure on the companies. So today we see it as a fundamentals. We need to do OTC. We need to do little by little, provide the best user experience, the best b two b experience. But for tomorrow, we imagine a web three world, a decentralized world where the code rules the accountability and the financing. And the idea for us is to build something that could be called by any infra web tree, infra decentralization, infra, that want to manage, that want to put the responsibility, the compensation and the environmental responsibility in the heart of its fundamentals.
00:28:57.966 - 00:30:04.718, Speaker E: For example, a blockchain that want to compensate the energy consumed during the validation of transactions can connect with, could connect with something that we could propose to compensate as going business transaction or batch after batch, which make more sense because we don't want to create to consume more energy that we compensate makes sense. But the idea is here we want to be compensate as a service and to be compensated as a service. If you look at what is happening in the Webtree world, it's something that totally makes sense. Actually could be the same for taxes. I think we are working on a use case which is voluntary participation compensation. But tomorrow we can imagine with regulation. I don't know, it's not my wish, but it's kind of use case that could be applied in a lot of subject like, I don't know, royalties, also taxes and so on.
00:30:04.718 - 00:30:12.650, Speaker E: That's where you want flexibility from end to end, from payment to end user or a service that is provided.
00:30:12.810 - 00:30:23.700, Speaker B: Cool, thank you. It is clear. I just want to mention to people listening to us, if you have questions, you can ask them on the community calls channel. Tarek, I think you wanted to mention.
00:30:25.590 - 00:30:27.302, Speaker A: So can you hear me?
00:30:27.436 - 00:30:31.062, Speaker B: Yeah, we can actually hear you pretty well. Your mic is good. Perfect.
00:30:31.196 - 00:30:33.494, Speaker A: So just to talk a bit more about the.
00:30:33.532 - 00:30:43.210, Speaker B: You're deactivated on discord though, let me check. Okay.
00:30:43.360 - 00:30:44.042, Speaker A: Is it better?
00:30:44.096 - 00:30:46.794, Speaker B: There you go. Now we can hear you. Perfect.
00:30:46.912 - 00:31:05.506, Speaker A: Just to add that right now. So first we are open source. So we are trying to add a new public good to the stocknet community. We are implementing ERC 35 25. So it's a new kind of token. It's called SFT, a semifungible token. Why we're doing this, just first because it's fun.
00:31:05.506 - 00:31:59.042, Speaker A: Second, because it really applies to our need, because we have a real world asset and it's really not fungible, but it has some fungible parts, so it makes sense to have a semifungible token. It's kind of a mix between 1155 and an SD 20. And so it's like one token to build them all, because you can create a lot of like, you can create vouchers, you can create bounds, you can create shares of a real world assets, anything you like. So trees and parts of, if you have three trees, part of a mangrove, et cetera, et cetera. The repository is open, everyone can have access. So it's still ongoing. I will share some info about 35 25 and that's it.
00:31:59.176 - 00:32:00.930, Speaker B: Fantastic. Thank you. Tarek.
00:32:01.830 - 00:32:52.686, Speaker A: I just have a question about stacknet naming functions. Okay, so it's probably a question to you or to the whole stacknet community. Do we plan to have overloading of function names? Like for instance, if we want to have compatibility with Openzeppelin in our specific case, we need to have a function that have the balance of a token id instead of the balance of an address. And you cannot do this. Either you have retro compatibility with 721, or you have compatibility with 35 25 eIp. But you cannot have both because the function name will be the same. So the entry point will be the same because of the hash.
00:32:52.686 - 00:33:01.234, Speaker A: But it seems that you could still have overloading if you hash with the types of the argument.
00:33:01.362 - 00:33:41.250, Speaker B: I see what you mean. And the last time I asked this question I was told overloading is dumb. It makes no sense. Okay, I guess it's a debate though I will say that there's no plan in the short term to have overloading of functions. That being said, you're right. Compatibility with former stacks and solidity, for example, is one is an issue. So I would suggest to do it through interfaces, maybe through APIs, or through specific interfaces that will, I don't know, make you able to target which function you want to call.
00:33:41.250 - 00:33:43.300, Speaker B: I think that's the best way to do that.
00:33:43.750 - 00:33:47.054, Speaker A: Okay, thank you. Yeah, I just wanted to open the debate, maybe some people want to join.
00:33:47.102 - 00:34:19.390, Speaker B: But I think it's an interesting debate. I think it's a nontrivial change, though, to basically change the way you ash the name of functions is changing the compiler, and this is kind of heavy. So it would be a big thing for benefits that are through which you can get workarounds. But that's a good question. If you have a strong opinion on that, you should definitely write the topic in the community forum. I see. Thank you.
00:34:19.390 - 00:34:53.180, Speaker B: Right, I have one question, a really quick one that actually, Clemo, our next guest is going to be able to answer right after. My question is about the branding of nfts. How do you guys manage having environmental projects selling nfts when nfts are associated with people who burn gasoline for fun? And I guess my question is like, I think the term NFT is dead. I think we're not going to be able to market nfts for the next ten years. We're going to have to rebrand this. Do you guys have ideas around that?
00:34:54.750 - 00:35:39.674, Speaker D: Well, I would say in general, what we're building is really like, we want to put trust and transparency and traceability in the front door of what we're building so that really people can understand that nothing is bullshit about what we were talking about. All sources are here. You can dig as much as you want into all the information that we provide. So I think being bulletproof, in a way, is one of the way to actually prevent that type of bashing. Also, it depends on who you are talking with. Right? Like with companies in general who are not familiar with web three will use digital assets. We won't put nfts because this is what it is.
00:35:39.712 - 00:35:39.914, Speaker F: Right?
00:35:39.952 - 00:35:52.830, Speaker D: Those are digital assets. When we talk to actually the web three enthusiasts, we can be specific and mention like, yeah, nfts, because we use this type of ErC, et cetera.
00:35:53.250 - 00:36:09.520, Speaker B: And maybe you're right. For a long while, tokens were a bad world. Like following the ICo craze, tokens were like, no, please, no token. And now we're getting back to it. So maybe nfts will become. Will be good again.
00:36:10.050 - 00:36:26.354, Speaker D: I think it's really like our mission, our vision goes even beyond nfts as such. It's just like, of course, bad reputation in the past, not later than FTX.
00:36:26.402 - 00:36:26.614, Speaker B: Right?
00:36:26.652 - 00:36:29.320, Speaker D: What happened? So the idea is really.
00:36:31.710 - 00:36:32.362, Speaker C: To be.
00:36:32.416 - 00:36:35.946, Speaker D: As bulletproof as possible, as trustful as possible.
00:36:36.128 - 00:36:43.100, Speaker B: Yeah. And I think it's a great strategy. What I mean is just that the term itself is loaded now. I don't know. Do you have thoughts on that?
00:36:43.710 - 00:37:23.500, Speaker E: Yeah, just wanted to say that we are focusing on the use cases, on the fundamentals. So it's every time the same. So today what is interesting for us is what we can do with the object that we have today. It's called NFT. But you saw Tariq and Baltaza are bringing with two new EIP, which is ERC 1155 and 33 25, which is very interesting actually tomorrow what is interesting for us is to see what is the best use case, real life use case that we can contribute to improve. We know that we are really low in term of maturity of the technology, in term of application use case. Application, real life application.
00:37:23.500 - 00:37:51.554, Speaker E: We are putting our stones, we are contributing to it. And of course, maybe it's not the right naming, branding or, I don't know, we are focusing on providing value on what makes sense for us. And you're right. But actually we don't spend a lot of time on that part. We focus on the use case. But it will be interesting to see what will be our contribution to the branding of the NFT in the future. Or will we need a new name for it.
00:37:51.672 - 00:37:55.774, Speaker B: Nice. What do you think, Lemon? Is the NFT term dead?
00:37:55.902 - 00:38:01.394, Speaker C: Yes. I was just wondering if I should unmute on Zoom or on discord. On boss.
00:38:01.522 - 00:38:09.030, Speaker B: We can hear you in zoom. Let's check. We can hear you in zoom. And you should unmute yourself on discord.
00:38:09.190 - 00:38:10.540, Speaker C: Discord as well.
00:38:11.470 - 00:38:12.540, Speaker B: Like that.
00:38:14.750 - 00:38:15.946, Speaker C: Like that. It's okay.
00:38:16.048 - 00:38:20.880, Speaker B: But now you have an echo. So when you're not talking, you should mute yourself.
00:38:22.130 - 00:39:01.786, Speaker C: Okay, so I was thinking the same. I mean, the NFT world is definitely bad for someone that just build a product that uses digital assets as the base layer for storing users data or different things that need to be transferred. I'm personally contacted a lot by scammers on LinkedIn that just because there is somewhere NFT region, I think in the doc tells, okay, I can help you sell your NFT. And people also that buy NfT because they think that they can have some value after a scarcity I did. Or something like that. So I always tell them I'm not building NFT project as you think it is. So if you're interested in scarcity, I'm not.
00:39:01.786 - 00:39:08.074, Speaker C: And go find other things. So there is an issue. Might not be in the long run, I guess.
00:39:08.272 - 00:39:16.894, Speaker B: Nice. Thank you. Well, I guess that's a good introduction. So you're not building nfts in the traditional term. What is it you're building? Clemo? Yeah.
00:39:16.932 - 00:39:44.950, Speaker C: So very good. Question and thanks for letting me present here a bit what Starsheet is. So Starsheet has been around for almost six months, but I guess that no one actually understand what it does because either myself, sometimes. I'm also hesitating with the end goal of the product. So I think that the best would be to directly share my screen and to talk commenting.
00:39:46.810 - 00:39:53.994, Speaker B: Please do. Please give us a sweet Demo. I'll mention that if you have questions for our guests, you can take a look in the community calls channel.
00:39:54.192 - 00:39:55.420, Speaker C: I need to.
00:39:56.110 - 00:40:27.560, Speaker B: And if you want to check Clement's demo once he has reinstalled zoom, apparently always when you're live with 100 people watching you, that you're going to have to reinstall. But if you want to follow the demo, you can go on the YouTube link that I've shared in the committee calls channel. So I'm guessing we have like what, a minute or two before Clement joins back? What should we do? I can sing a song. I maybe make some elevator music.
00:40:28.730 - 00:40:31.800, Speaker E: I do the rhythm. Go on, do.
00:40:36.650 - 00:41:07.278, Speaker B: Welcome to Stocknet's community call. We'll be back shortly. Our guests are facing technical issue. Please be sure that we're doing our utmost to make sure everybody is back on track. Actually, let's talk a bit more about what you guys are doing while we're here. Like most people now, I work remote and I have a lot of questions. I'm curious.
00:41:07.278 - 00:41:12.820, Speaker B: You guys seem to have worked a lot in the carbon credit or carbon industry in the past, right?
00:41:13.750 - 00:41:35.882, Speaker E: Actually, lot in the tech and in the operational, actually, but not on the field. We are not people from the field. We are people from the business. We know how to put together technology and business use cases. So this is our growth. For example, yummy. From the tech.
00:41:35.882 - 00:41:45.520, Speaker E: I'm from the supply chain. I did. I was director of a warehouse and a transportation website for fragrances. If you want to know everything.
00:41:47.090 - 00:41:48.880, Speaker B: I always want to know everything.
00:41:49.490 - 00:42:24.730, Speaker D: But yeah, we've been digging a lot. We've been digging a lot in the field itself, like talking to all the experts, like businesses, certifiers, project developers, et cetera, et cetera. So the idea that we have today, like the product that we have today and what we've presented is the result also of all this digging that we've been doing. So we didn't just build something reading through just halfway one market, we really spent a lot of time actually understanding the ins and outs of this market, which is actually fairly complex to understand.
00:42:24.880 - 00:42:41.582, Speaker B: It shows. Thank you. Okay, I think Clemon is ready just want to mention something. Clemon, can you go back to discord please? So the icon I was talking about is on the bottom left. See the headphones one? No, lefter. Lefter, yeah. Here.
00:42:41.582 - 00:42:55.090, Speaker B: This one. Not this one, the one on the right. Yeah. If you click here you're not going to hear any echo anymore. Right. But you need to reactivate it when you talk so that people on discord can hear you. Anyway, go ahead, the floor is yours.
00:42:55.090 - 00:43:00.310, Speaker B: We can't hear you on zoom.
00:43:03.610 - 00:43:09.020, Speaker C: Okay, the basic idea with started.
00:43:10.990 - 00:43:11.354, Speaker B: To.
00:43:11.392 - 00:44:16.686, Speaker C: Start with the beginning, I did say four NFT projects on Ethereum mainnet, just focusing on on chain NFT project. So building all the rendering on chain without any use of neither IPFs nor external storage nor any kind of things, and creating this on chain rendering, I realized that when you want to render an NFT, actually you can use as input to this rendering function, I would say as many data as you want that is already available on chain. So to render the image of one NFT, you don't need to just use something bound to this NFT. You can use, for instance, to render a token number two, you can use value or something that comes from token number three or number ten, or maybe you can have sort of a cumulative sum. You can say that token number one is rendered with one, but token number two uses the data from one and two and so on and so forth. You can imagine it. Anything that you want, you can use data from other contract if you want.
00:44:16.686 - 00:44:22.720, Speaker C: You can render a token using the balance of the people calling the rendering function if you want.
00:44:26.470 - 00:44:54.486, Speaker B: I think it makes sense. So what you're saying essentially is that most nfts today point to an external image. What you call the rendering is actually the creation of the image, right? So it's like composing the asset that shows on screen. What you're saying is that if you don't delegate this outside and say yes, this string is where the image is, but if you say from the blockchain this is the image, then you can take inputs inside the blockchain.
00:44:54.598 - 00:45:31.666, Speaker C: Yes, definitely. And this really makes sense and appears because I was doing unchained NFT. Lots of people are saying that unchained NFT are nice because they are decentralized, and you are sure that IPFs nor AWs will never be corrupted. So you do have your own JPeg for life and even longer. I don't care about this usage and I think that this is as fake as scarcity. And it makes no sense. While the fact that while putting the NFT fully on chain means that the NFT can use the composability of the chain.
00:45:31.666 - 00:45:54.066, Speaker C: So that was the basic starting idea of a stock sheet. And then we looked for, I would say a cool illustration of this, and I realized that the spreadsheet, and I'm a spreadsheet lover, so I do a lot of things with Google sheets, and I do add ons at Google sheet as well, and application with Google Sheet. Anyway, I'm a spreadsheet.
00:45:54.118 - 00:45:57.840, Speaker B: What's the most stupid thing you did a sheet for?
00:46:01.010 - 00:46:54.350, Speaker C: No, but seriously, because I use sheets just for small things, like everyone. But you can do cron jobs on Google sheet very easily. You can deploy your own code, you can use sheets as backends for application, and you can also use these backends in no code application. I love glide as well. So we are not here to talk about glide apps, but uses sheets. So my idea was that if you consider a cell in a spreadsheet, a cell typically has an internal formula that you see it only if you enter the formula, or if you enter the cell, or if you look at the formula bar and it has a rendered value, this rendered value may be constant, or use different value from other cells, or different rendered value from other cells. So that I'm starting to think that, okay, this was a good idea to illustrate the fact that the token can be anything computed from this environment.
00:46:54.350 - 00:47:25.690, Speaker C: So this was the basic idea of starfit. And it boils down to something that looks like a spreadsheet, but where? And so I have opened different tabs, but I will stick here on testnet. So you can type in cells anything you want. So each cell is actually an ERC 721. You can type in what you want, constant value. You can type in with exa notation as well. So it's not the same.
00:47:25.760 - 00:47:26.730, Speaker B: No strings.
00:47:27.230 - 00:47:29.900, Speaker C: Yeah, you can type strings less than.
00:47:30.770 - 00:47:33.358, Speaker B: It will be represented as a felt. Okay.
00:47:33.444 - 00:47:48.020, Speaker C: Yeah, it's always like a felt, but actually each cell is indeed any contract call that you could do. So it's a high level.
00:47:50.470 - 00:47:50.946, Speaker B: I would.
00:47:50.968 - 00:48:26.720, Speaker C: Say high level language, high level syntax to call anything that you could possibly do on chain. So I have a bunch of example here. So if you type just an address here, it's an address. But when you type an address and you append the dot, then the front end will automatically fetch the API. So that as a user, you tell that you want to interact with the contract behind this address. And the front end helps you with this, putting the ABI and displaying the functions that are available.
00:48:29.730 - 00:48:31.566, Speaker B: This is nice if you click on.
00:48:31.588 - 00:49:18.078, Speaker C: Something like that get it's just for the user to. So it's an enabler. My end goal was that we have all this data available on chain. I mean not so much data currently on Starknet, but it will grow up fortunately with time. We have all this data available on chain and we have basic excel users that are not so dumb actually, because I'm an Excel lover and that would really be able to sort of code, get this data directly from the chain, mix different things and we just need a smooth interaction with the blockchain. And I've guessed that the spreadsheet was nice. So if you type in a number, we should get here if it works.
00:49:18.078 - 00:50:05.802, Speaker C: Yeah, so this is an address. And the nice thing is that as you would do in a spreadsheet here, you can reference from the previous result. So if you type j free, you manipulate the results so the output of the previous call. So you can, without really noticing it, build your own multicol or graph multicol directly from this interface. And because in the end everything is stored on chain, when you actually want to render one single token, it can be invoked or it can be only view. You actually make one single transaction. That may require quite a lot of transaction to eventually result to the final target node that you are rendering.
00:50:05.802 - 00:50:07.360, Speaker C: I don't know if I'm clear.
00:50:08.130 - 00:50:31.720, Speaker B: It makes sense. So what you built is sheet where you can query data directly from within the blockchain. And cells are interdependent so you can build stuff that call on each other. And so it's kind of an easier way for you to query data on the blockchain and display it here.
00:50:32.810 - 00:51:30.198, Speaker C: Yes, and it's not only displayed because displaying is nice, because when you use a block explorer you may want to query different kind of data and maybe you click on one function, then you reload the page, you click another one. You cannot really build small dashboards. There are already applications to build dashboards if you stick to the view part. I think that might not be available directly on Starknet today, but I think that June analytics or memory nonsense or nonsense or different high level application may do the job. The difference here is that I'm betting on the fact that there is enough logic on chain and I can just add some more if it's required. Like the basic ops I have added here. I have added a contract for doing this one, some prod div, just basic mat operation.
00:51:30.198 - 00:51:52.394, Speaker C: There is enough logic on chain, so you don't need to deploy your own logic to create in the end, anything you want still on chain so that you sort of not deploy in your contract, but you create a graph of logic. So any logic you want, just reusing what's already available. It's a way to compose existing code.
00:51:52.532 - 00:51:57.602, Speaker B: And take pieces of code and assemble into something new.
00:51:57.736 - 00:52:30.140, Speaker C: Yes, definitely. So yeah, you compose, you pick and compose and you post again on chain so that you actually, it could be stored off chain and we could just use the account abstraction native feature of Sacnet, I would say, to resolve a token, just ordering the right way, all the transaction required to eventually do the last one. So I've decided to go unchained first. This might actually not be the most.
00:52:30.910 - 00:52:32.414, Speaker B: But it's definitely depending on the use.
00:52:32.452 - 00:52:42.218, Speaker C: Cases I think that people may want to store on chain or others may not care about saving this cost of unchained storage and just relying on a provider.
00:52:42.314 - 00:52:51.220, Speaker B: So when does the transaction happen here? Every time you mint a cell, every time you click save, I guess you are minting the cells that.
00:52:52.950 - 00:53:40.210, Speaker C: It just saves the old workspace. So it saves the diff between what you had before and what's now. So I have an error, I don't know what's. Anyway, it saves the diff between all the current changes, and when the front end detects that the transaction is not meant to be view but it's meant to be invoked, then it displays a green cell instead of blue one. And when you double click it will trigger the actual, so it's called render cell, but the execute. So it will execute the graph of computing. It's not here on this sheet, and it takes maybe half an hour to build.
00:53:40.210 - 00:54:06.540, Speaker C: But you can build, for instance, a sheet where you have a column of address, and you do, in one single transaction a transfer to ten address. Like you take your own balance and you say my balance divided by ten, and you have listed ten addresses in one column, and then you have one is transfer, transfer, transfer in ten rows, and then the final rows is like all, and you group all this transaction into one single transaction. So it's somehow transaction builder as well.
00:54:08.350 - 00:54:15.946, Speaker B: So how would you advise, like, if people say, oh, this looks fun, what is some fun experiments you'd like people to do with stocksheet?
00:54:16.058 - 00:54:59.980, Speaker C: So this is a good question. Stocksheet is meant to be, I would say, an application to build with and to play with. So if you want to. I had this idea, for instance, I was lucky enough to get money from a Gitcoin 00:15 but I received money in five different tokens while at the end of the day, I wanted just to have USDC. You can take 20 minutes of your time, a new sheet, and you build multiswap from a list of tokens to target token, just one. And with a single transaction you have sort of small application that can do a multiswap. So this is really easy.
00:55:00.590 - 00:55:10.510, Speaker B: So if you're more comfortable with sheets than with Javascript, for example, you can do this swap in a single call very easily. Yes, restart sheets. Very nice.
00:55:10.660 - 00:55:49.162, Speaker C: Yes, you can do this kind of thing. And also, I started to talk with Juliana from Marjorie as well, because since each one of those cells are NFT, like standard NFT, they're rendered in the wallet. If you look at here, you can see all the cells that you have. It makes you laugh. But these values are dynamic, which means that if something here change, so it changed the final rendered value of a cell, as you would expect in the spreadsheet, and so it changed in the image of your wallet. So your wallet becomes somehow dashboard as well.
00:55:49.296 - 00:55:51.440, Speaker B: That's nice. That's really cool.
00:55:52.450 - 00:56:09.554, Speaker C: And now it's not integrated. But if the wallet was detecting, as I do in the front end, that some cells are meant to be called, are meant to be invoked and not only viewed, then it could allow the user to have in their wallet some.
00:56:09.592 - 00:56:11.666, Speaker B: Sort of click or something.
00:56:11.768 - 00:56:31.260, Speaker C: Yeah. Predefined transaction, predefined action that you could build on stacksheet and run from your wallet directly. So these are all the ideas that we have. It's for builder with a higher level of interaction. So not people, not developer, but thinker, I would say.
00:56:32.030 - 00:56:46.574, Speaker B: Very nice. Cool. Look, we're reaching about the end of our community call. This was a really insightful demo. So thanks for this. Clemont, your call to action is clear for people to go and experiment and.
00:56:46.612 - 00:56:53.022, Speaker C: Test how give me feedbacks and things needs to be changed. Not as smooth as they could be.
00:56:53.156 - 00:56:54.820, Speaker B: So how do people reach you?
00:56:55.350 - 00:57:08.310, Speaker C: But we have a Twitter, we have discord. I don't check it so much, but maybe at least once a week. And there is also telegram group stocksheet beta tester that it's open to join, I guess.
00:57:08.460 - 00:57:09.480, Speaker F: Very nice.
00:57:09.850 - 00:57:13.000, Speaker B: Okay, so stocksheet, what's the website?
00:57:13.450 - 00:57:15.030, Speaker C: Stocksheet. XYZ.

00:57:25.770 - 00:57:36.110, Speaker B: Very nice. We didn't ask that for coverable earlier. Where your website guys, how do people find out about you on FTX? On what? FTX?
00:57:36.690 - 00:58:03.158, Speaker E: I'm kidding. Yeah, I'm going just to unmute myself on discord. I know, it's good. So same here. We have carbonal underscore IO on Twitter and carbonable IO on Internet. We have discord and a lot of things to do on crew Tree, for example, to be part of the community. So, yeah, please come and do deal before doing.
00:58:03.324 - 00:58:20.798, Speaker B: Fantastic. Well, guys, thank you for visiting us today on the community call. It's always really cool to see people building and building so different stuff and experimenting. So I'm grateful to have you here and, yeah, we'll be in touch.
