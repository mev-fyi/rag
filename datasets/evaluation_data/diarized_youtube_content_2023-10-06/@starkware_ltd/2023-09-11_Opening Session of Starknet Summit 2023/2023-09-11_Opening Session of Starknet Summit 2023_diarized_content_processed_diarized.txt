00:00:04.550 - 00:00:17.578, Speaker A: Hello. Good morning, San Francisco. Hi. Very, very excited to be here today.
00:00:17.744 - 00:00:31.074, Speaker B: And it's great to have you all here. We'll try to keep it very short as there's much more interesting stuff ahead. It I just want to share some thought that I had as I was.
00:00:31.112 - 00:00:34.110, Speaker C: Watching the excellent movie Oppenheimer.
00:00:34.190 - 00:00:36.580, Speaker B: How many of you have watched it? Raise your hand.
00:00:36.950 - 00:00:38.340, Speaker C: Good movie, right?
00:00:41.130 - 00:00:44.520, Speaker B: You probably know that the story of.
00:00:44.970 - 00:00:47.478, Speaker C: Quantum mechanics is also a story of.
00:00:47.564 - 00:00:51.010, Speaker B: Some arcane fields of mathematics that then.
00:00:51.180 - 00:00:53.914, Speaker D: Things like complex and imaginary numbers that.
00:00:53.952 - 00:00:57.594, Speaker C: Then made their way into technology that.
00:00:57.632 - 00:01:01.770, Speaker D: Has changed life for all of us in inconceivable ways.
00:01:01.920 - 00:01:04.442, Speaker C: And as I was watching the movie.
00:01:04.506 - 00:01:17.634, Speaker B: I was thinking that what's happening with Starknet could one day be something of that sort, where very arcane fields of mathematics and computer science are turning into.
00:01:17.672 - 00:01:19.794, Speaker C: A technology that has the potential to.
00:01:19.832 - 00:01:24.980, Speaker D: Transform life in human society for everyone, and hopefully for the better.
00:01:25.670 - 00:01:27.618, Speaker C: And we've come such a long way.
00:01:27.704 - 00:01:37.254, Speaker D: From purely theoretical research. And you'll hear from some of the founding fathers of this research today, like.
00:01:37.292 - 00:01:49.340, Speaker C: Professor Shafi Goldwasser, who invented zero knowledge proofs. Dan Bonet, Professor Dan Bonet, who invented pairing based cryptography. Professor Noam Nisan, who invented algorithmic mechanism design.
00:01:51.070 - 00:01:55.006, Speaker D: These fields are being transformed into a.
00:01:55.028 - 00:01:57.982, Speaker C: Technology that everyone is using via things.
00:01:58.036 - 00:02:12.834, Speaker D: Like Cairo, the programming language that is the best next generation programming language for smart contracts that I guess a lot of you have dabbled in.
00:02:13.032 - 00:02:16.206, Speaker B: And it's just very exciting and inspiring.
00:02:16.238 - 00:02:25.330, Speaker D: To see all of this. And we're personally grateful for all of you devoting the most precious of resources.
00:02:25.410 - 00:02:33.174, Speaker C: Which is your time and devotion to this vision. So I'll let Uri, my dear founder.
00:02:33.222 - 00:02:33.434, Speaker E: Hi.
00:02:33.472 - 00:02:38.282, Speaker F: Good morning, everyone. So, as I think always for me.
00:02:38.336 - 00:02:47.360, Speaker G: I'll talk about the human layer, which is the thing that motivates and drives me in this story.
00:02:47.890 - 00:03:04.174, Speaker F: So I want to talk about the way it's been handling the progression and evolution of the network over the past period. And there are periods of rapid improvement, and spirits are high and everyone's ecstatic.
00:03:04.222 - 00:03:06.366, Speaker E: And then there are periods where everyone's.
00:03:06.398 - 00:03:10.550, Speaker G: Heads down, building and challenges and some frustration and all that.
00:03:10.700 - 00:03:16.866, Speaker E: And to see over the past, this year, for sure, to see the ecosystem.
00:03:17.058 - 00:03:18.886, Speaker F: Working through these things and always in.
00:03:18.908 - 00:03:24.842, Speaker E: Good spirit and always with goodwill and always with a positive attitude, is something.
00:03:24.896 - 00:03:29.674, Speaker F: That we're very grateful. And I constantly think about how we.
00:03:29.712 - 00:03:37.626, Speaker E: Maintain that spirit as the ecosystem grows. Now we're trying to turn San Francisco into the new Paris for Starknet.
00:03:37.658 - 00:03:43.646, Speaker G: We'll see how we replicate the success we've had elsewhere here.
00:03:43.748 - 00:03:45.726, Speaker F: I think that will require a lot.
00:03:45.748 - 00:03:49.120, Speaker G: Of the same magic that we were fortunate to have.
00:03:50.850 - 00:03:52.994, Speaker F: That's, that's the thing that I think.
00:03:53.032 - 00:03:56.754, Speaker E: Excites me most about what's going on here.
00:03:56.872 - 00:03:59.106, Speaker F: And in this regard, I think the.
00:03:59.128 - 00:04:02.006, Speaker E: Person, from our perspective, is going to.
00:04:02.028 - 00:04:08.966, Speaker G: Be the one who shepherds the ecosystem through these challenges and this evolution in.
00:04:08.988 - 00:04:18.954, Speaker E: The years to come is Diego Liva, who is the CEO of the Starknet Foundation. I think we've been working very closely over the past several months.
00:04:18.992 - 00:04:24.090, Speaker G: He's been at it full time since March, I believe, and it has been.
00:04:24.160 - 00:04:27.510, Speaker F: A pure joy to see him calmly.
00:04:27.670 - 00:04:42.960, Speaker G: And intelligently and with great optimism, sort of work through all the different challenges ahead and build a team him, and start building out the development partnerships that he'll be sharing with us. So with that, Diego, please.
