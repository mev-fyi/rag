00:00:00.900 - 00:00:44.452, Speaker A: You. Hi, everyone. I'm Itamar, one of the founders at Argent. Today's talk is called buckle up, because we are very, very excited, obviously, about Starknet. We believe 2023 will be the year Starknet takes off. And we want to share a bit of view on how we think about Starknet and how we think every day about how we can help the ecosystem growth accelerate. If we go back a few years ago, Arjun was rebuilding the first smart wallet on Ethereum l one.
00:00:44.452 - 00:01:10.872, Speaker A: At the time, you had Argent and what was called Nosisafe. I would say they were the two options there. And we started obsessing about abstracting all the complexity of dealing with crypto, and we did an amazing job. I believe we were ready to take off. We had abstracted everything. So you didn't have a seat phrase to deal with. You didn't even pay the gas.
00:01:10.872 - 00:01:50.292, Speaker A: So we had the brilliant idea of paying gas for our users. It was brilliant at the beginning, and then, I believe all my gray hair happened in the defi summer when gas increased 1000 x between the time we started and that day. So we couldn't take off exactly where we wanted. And so we started looking at solutions there. It was still early days, so Starkware existed. Starknet wasn't there yet, but the vision of Starknet was there. And so we started obsessing about the technology and started thinking how we can make it reality.
00:01:50.292 - 00:02:43.940, Speaker A: How can we contribute? I think Eli this morning mentioned to go fast, we go alone to go far, we go together, something like that. So we're like, how can we contribute to the ecosystem growth? So we started with simple things. So started contributing to anything we could contribute. So you had at the time, it was more than a year ago, I think Sean from Starscan maybe in the room with some more. Team member Yanx starting working on Starknet Js the first library to interact with Starknet. Then we started working on get Starknet to allow daps to integrate wallet. Then started thinking about all the learnings from l one to contribute to the work starquare was doing on the account interface, bringing things like Multicol, which for us was so critical, so we could get rid of ERC 20 approved forever on Starknet.
00:02:43.940 - 00:03:20.340, Speaker A: And we had that chance. We could really build things the way we envisioned from day one without the legacy we had from Ethereum. So when that was done, of course we needed a wallet. We're talking a year ago. There was nothing. So builders needed to be able to test their early prototype. Then you had early explorer, and we started adding features that you would expect from a wallet, whether it's NFT contract deployment for builders swaps, integrated in the wallet and started to look like an exciting complete wallet.
00:03:20.340 - 00:04:10.752, Speaker A: And all of that, from all the libraries to the wallet, all open source. And that's really something we encourage the ecosystem to do, is like, the more we could open source, the faster the ecosystem could be built, people could reuse component building blocks and just focus on shipping. And I think today alone, between all the different talks and Eli announcement ten minutes ago, I think I've seen three projects announcing more open sourcing. So I think that says a lot about the Starknet ecosystem. So we're very proud of where we are today. So a year into that journey, Argent X, our chrome extension, had more than half a million install. Around eight out of every ten people joining Starknet choose Argent.
00:04:10.752 - 00:04:45.500, Speaker A: So very, very proud of the team. It started as a very, very small team within Argent. We have Jillian there, and I think one or two people in the team started getting excited about Starknet, and a year later, that's where we were, that's where we are. But all of that, if you look at Argent today, it's still a normal wallet. I would say it's really the foundation of a wallet that you would expect on any chain. Some account abstraction element like multicol were there from day one. But now we can finally focus on really unleashing the power of account abstraction.
00:04:45.500 - 00:05:39.088, Speaker A: We've been talking about that for four years, and now that we have the foundation there, we can focus on shipping more. So today we'll announce the first in a long series, I think, of features in that area, which is two Fa for Argent X. So I couldn't make a live demo people asked me to record. So what it will be is you have your normal Argentx account that you all know. So we're showing here that it's a normal account, sending a few funds, it goes through the way you are used to, and we'll simulate someone taking control of that. So in argentics you can extract the seed. So here you have really someone in control of my seed going in a fresh new browser, fresh new install, putting the seed there, and then you will see back the wallet with the same balance, the same address.
00:05:39.088 - 00:06:19.600, Speaker A: But if they try to transact, they will be met with a two Fa challenge. So here we use a very simple authentication. We use an email, you need the code, and then you are unlocking that wallet on that trusted device. And it doesn't matter whether you would use RJNX or just terminal or another wallet. You cannot transact on that account without that two Fa challenge. It will be released in the coming weeks as part of what we call Argent Shield, which will have a series of security related feature we'll be able to anyone fully opt in. So we're very very excited about what I think is probably the first case of two Fa.
00:06:19.600 - 00:06:53.204, Speaker A: Of two Fa on, I would say on a self custodial account. And I think these are very important point. If you look at Argent Shield, it's fully non custodial and censorship resistant. So we build it from the ground up. And again, only smart account and account abstraction enable that. You could imagine having fraud monitoring providers and argent, someone else, they could misbehave. You have the control, you can remove them from the loop.
00:06:53.204 - 00:07:26.068, Speaker A: So at no point in time someone has control of your wallet. You could add two Fa backups. So obviously we're working with the ledger team. That would be an amazing option there. You get out of band authentication, so really you can use another channel like an email to really understand what's going to happen. So you prevent all type of attacks around taking control of your computer, men in the middle, et cetera. It's one off today for untrusted devices, so it's opt in, but it's also not invasive at all.
00:07:26.068 - 00:08:14.380, Speaker A: You only do it when you switch device and then you don't have to think about it. And the future will be bringing more risk based to FA challenge. But we also know that desktop extension are used a lot today about the extension for wallets. But the world, two thirds of the world, is using a mobile phone, so the future of web three has to be mobile. So for us, the second announcement we feel will really contribute to the ecosystem is announcing that we'll have of course, starknet on our native iOS and Android apps. So we are super excited about that. We'll launch it with Scaro 1.0
00:08:14.380 - 00:08:54.070, Speaker A: and we'll have direct bridging through and from the Argent vault on layer one. What that means for the ecosystem is hundreds of millions of dollars will be one click away for users to bring into starknet because these are the TVL of Argentvault. Someone recently told me that Argentvault has more TVL than Solana. So I think if we bring that to Starknet, we'll be in a very good place. So now these were, I would say, the obvious stuff. We had to fa in some way on our layer one wallet. We had proven that security model.
00:08:54.070 - 00:09:37.742, Speaker A: Actually people don't know, but one day we had one single Argent wallet on layer one with a user depositing half a billion dollar. So we have proven that you can trust a very simple experience without complex setup where people can put a significant amount of money. And of course, we were born through mobile. And so after doing that, we're like, okay, what can we do more? What does the Starknet ecosystem need? Or how can we contribute? To be fair, it's not us biomagic having all those ideas. A lot of those came from builders here in the room. And they tell us we need more, we want to go further. It's still too long as an onboarding.
00:09:37.742 - 00:11:02.762, Speaker A: So we listen to you. You want no app, you want no download, you want no friction. So the third Announcement today is the web wallet. So what does it mean at dub developer? As DAP developers, there is no more excuse. You can onboard your users the way you would onboard a web, two user, you can onboard it. I would say the way sorare does it sore has proven they've done an amazing job with, I would say, an experience in that vein. It's seedless, it's non custodial.
00:11:02.762 - 00:11:35.340, Speaker A: So argent has no access to the funds. It's built on the argent account, which means in the future, a lot of flexibility for users maybe to move between different setup, whether it's for security or Ux. Small details you might not see in the video, but it's really persistent across dapps. So you log in on one Dap, you go on the next DAP, you are still logged in. It's really seamless. You can spend a long time enjoying web three without worrying about the wallet. And we have integrated onramp, so we are very excited to start that today.
00:11:35.340 - 00:11:58.658, Speaker A: We have a few early friends from the community that worked with us that are working on testing this, on integrating this. So a big, big thank you to all of them. Without you, we couldn't build that experience. So come talk to us at the booth. We have one at the entrance. You can start integrating today. So we will not wait for Kero 1.0.
00:11:58.658 - 00:12:22.826, Speaker A: You have been asking for that for too long. So now is the time. So that's three announcements. That's two. Fa for improved security and peace of mind with your assets, mobile and web wallet. So we are very excited to be shipping all of that. But something I've wanted to do for a very long time is one more thing.
00:12:22.826 - 00:13:11.530, Speaker A: So you guys came with way too many ideas and again, we fell some big, big pain points that needed to be solved, things we didn't do in the past. Ethereum because other people in the ecosystem were doing it very well, but some stuff were missing. And one question we're asked all the time is that literally every day? And so, no, I'm not announcing an argent token, but we saw other people announcing tokens. So Starquare has deployed the argent token. And clearly more and more project will need to store tokens on Starknet. We'll have treasuries, daos companies. And so we are very excited to also announce the Argent multisig for teams and for daos.
00:13:11.530 - 00:13:56.758, Speaker A: So it's hard to do a demo of something that just looks exactly like a normal argent account. And that's really the power of Archon abstraction. It's just there, it's part of Argent X, it's part of your experience. You can interact with layer trading, you can use any dapps you would with Argent and then several parties will each be able to confirm the transaction. And again, that's uniquely possible because of account abstraction. It's fully integrated into argent and proposition to the way Argent worked on L one or Nosis, for example. Because we have native account abstraction, that means it's integrated experience.
00:13:56.758 - 00:14:28.354, Speaker A: The account pays for its own gas, you don't need another account to control it. The multistig will pay for its own gas. You will access all the Dapps like you would with any other account. And this will be launched after audit with Kero 1.0. So that's it for now. I think that's already a lot. I think last thing I can say is how to get started.
00:14:28.354 - 00:14:44.546, Speaker A: Download Argent X on Argent. Explore the ecosystem. Just play with Dapps. Whether on Testnet, on Mainnet, you can go on dapplan.com to discover them and then come meet us. Meet us to integrate web wallet. So we are at the booth or you can find me on Telegram.
00:14:44.546 - 00:15:20.370, Speaker A: But also meet us to tell us what you need. What can we build? We have grown more and more and we can ship even more. And more importantly for us, we're hiring for an ecosystem lead because this only works if we work together with you. And we believe that person is very likely to be in this room. So come see me and let's talk about that. And then maybe the final word is a big, big thank you to Starquare for everything they've been building. We are so excited to be part of the journey and keep Darknet strange.
00:15:20.370 - 00:15:39.848, Speaker A: If people want to ask questions, apparently we can do that now. So happy to do it. We have a few more minutes. You might have to scream. Here. Is one there? Yeah.
00:15:39.934 - 00:15:53.276, Speaker B: Hi, my name is Dory, I'm at Starquare. I have a question about the two factor authentication. You said that if you only have a private key, that's not enough to sign and control the wallet, right? You'll need an extra step, right?
00:15:53.378 - 00:15:53.836, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:15:53.938 - 00:16:01.616, Speaker B: So if I want to take full custody of my wallet and my digital assets, how do I export that now?
00:16:01.798 - 00:16:29.812, Speaker A: So first, by default, you are the owner. There's one key you sign, you're all good. If you opt in for the service, then you will need that second key. If for any reason you want to get out of there, there are two options. So first, you can disable, and for example, let's say the second key is argent fraud monitor, and we are behaving properly. You and I signed that you are back to a single key setup. But now more importantly, and that's why I mentioned it's censorship resistant.
00:16:29.812 - 00:16:44.270, Speaker A: If we misbehave, if we decide we will stop signing for you, we don't like you and we stop signing, there is a time lock and you as the owner, you can just remove this from the equation with the time lock and you are good to go.
00:16:52.600 - 00:16:53.350, Speaker C: Here.
00:16:55.260 - 00:17:25.692, Speaker A: So yeah, I will quickly take that one and then you. So how is the web wallet working? Seedless. So basically, as you saw in the demo, the first iteration, very simple, we have a password. The password is a low encryption so that argent doesn't have access. But then we have a few extra tricks. We'll try to build the right blog post on that for things like password recovery, because users should be able. So right now you can already have password recovery on a trusted device.
00:17:25.692 - 00:17:52.590, Speaker A: So if you have ever used that device before, there will be an extra encrypted key and we'll be able to provide you with that decryption key for that trusted device. And then we'll be launching more model around social recovery. Basically you have more is it so we can store you stored in the browser, the encrypted key, and we can store the encrypted key too, but only you can decrypt it.
00:17:54.320 - 00:18:06.688, Speaker D: I think you may have answered it right now. So the two factor authorization key, is it custodied by argent or is it custodied by the trusted device that I opted for two Fa for?
00:18:06.774 - 00:18:28.084, Speaker A: So on the two Fa, technically it's anything and any key. It doesn't matter. The default mode we would suggest is one key we control because we can do a lot of automated stuff like security, risk assessment, et cetera, of a transaction, and then a second key. That could be, for example, a ledger. It's up to you. You don't have to. Even with a single key.
00:18:28.084 - 00:18:48.424, Speaker A: And we censor you. You can kick us out, but with a second key, like a ledger or even another wallet you could sign at any time. But the reality with that model, you could also decide that you hold the key. Number one. It really doesn't matter. We have a last one.
00:18:48.462 - 00:18:56.064, Speaker C: Or is there anyone who wants to ask a question? See any raise hand? I think we're done.
00:18:56.102 - 00:18:57.696, Speaker A: I think we're good. Thank you.
00:18:57.878 - 00:18:59.500, Speaker C: Please, a round of applause for Itamar.
