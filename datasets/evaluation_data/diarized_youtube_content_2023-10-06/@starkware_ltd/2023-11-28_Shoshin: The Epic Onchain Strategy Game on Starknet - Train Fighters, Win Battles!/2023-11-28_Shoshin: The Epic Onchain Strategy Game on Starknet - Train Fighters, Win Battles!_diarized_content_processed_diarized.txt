00:00:00.760 - 00:00:34.195, Speaker A: Hello everyone. Welcome back. Today I'm introducing you to the game Shoshin by topology. It's a TPS agnostic asynchronous strategy fighting game. Asynchronous strategy means you can train your fighter whenever it suits you best without having to wait for your opponent's turn. TPS agnostic means that the game doesn't rely on transactions per second. The game is executed in your browser via the Cairo VM and starknet then validates your score without it having to be computed, which enables a much faster and smoother gaming experience.
00:00:34.195 - 00:01:26.659, Speaker A: Okay, so I'm going to show you a glimpse of what Shoshin looks like. But before we start, check out their crazy cool soundtrack. Okay, so there's this one on one fight and your moves are based on if then statements. So for example, if not within 100, move forward and if within 100 slash, you can add different layers up here. Once you're ready with your moves, you can start the fight and then watch the battle unfold. Okay, so these two moves were very basic, but as you progress, your opponent gets tougher and more resilient. So you'll have to create complex strategies.
00:01:26.659 - 00:01:50.335, Speaker A: For example, by using unique attack combos. At the start of the game, there's a super helpful and in depth tutorial, so be sure to check it out before you start. Alright, have fun and see you soon. Bye.
