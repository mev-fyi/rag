00:00:00.410 - 00:00:32.006, Speaker A: Hello. It's good to see you again. Today's digital age. Our screens have become a very central part of our lives. But with constant notifications and endless scrolling, staying focused has never been harder. This is where focustree comes out of the woods. Their goal is to help you build a healthier and more sustainable relationship with technology.
00:00:32.006 - 00:00:58.638, Speaker A: Now, let me show you how focustree takes a gamified approach toward enabling more time to focus. You start by joining or creating a community garden. This is a digital space where you and your gang can build together. By focusing, you can earn tiles. And these digital items come in different rarities, and they change based on themes. So, for example, we currently have a japanese theme. To build your focus streak, try concentrating for at least ten minutes each day.
00:00:58.638 - 00:01:03.210, Speaker A: And keep in mind, the longer your streak, the better the perks. All right, bye.
