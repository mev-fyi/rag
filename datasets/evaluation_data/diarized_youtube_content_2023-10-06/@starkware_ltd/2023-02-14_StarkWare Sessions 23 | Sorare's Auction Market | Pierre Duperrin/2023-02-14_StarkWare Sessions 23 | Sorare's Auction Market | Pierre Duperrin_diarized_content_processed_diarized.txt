00:00:03.300 - 00:00:50.428, Speaker A: Hi everyone. I'm Pierre Duperam, blockchain lead at Sora. And today I'm going to talk about the Sora auction market. So the goal of that presentation is to show how you can build ux first experiences on top of like, simple blockchain primitives. For blockchain, we use Starkx. We migrated to Starkx almost two years ago, in 2021. So for those who don't know, Sor is a fantasy game where basically game items are licensed collectibles that are represented as nfTs.
00:00:50.428 - 00:01:35.492, Speaker A: So here, there's two here. One from Erling Allen, which is licensed by the Premier League, and one from LeBron James, which is licensed by the NBA. Just to give an introduction of how the Sora games work. Basically, you can collect and trade those game items, those nfTs, you can either purchase them directly from Sora or you can also trade with other managers. We happen to call our users managers because they kind of manage a club, right, with their cards and trading and all of that. Then you play and compete into competition. It's a fantasy game.
00:01:35.492 - 00:02:38.564, Speaker A: So it's basically you're going to set up your team and based on real life performance of your players over the weekend, you'll get points. During that weekend, you can enjoy live experience, you can play with your friends, you get live notifications, and at the end of the weekend you get rewarded depending on where you have ranked, basically on the leaderboard. And you can earn either other NFTs, also east, but also physical items like game tickets, jerseys and special experiences. So during the World cup, we had like one special experience for the winners of the competition. They had the ability to go and play with Zenidin Zidan in Marseille. A few numbers on where we are right now in terms of volume. We have over 1 million weekly active users.
00:02:38.564 - 00:03:11.590, Speaker A: About 30,000 cards are traded on the platform every day and about $7 million are exchanged on the platform every week. So now if we go to the auction market. So this is basically what the auction market looks like on Soar.com. So you have a bunch of cards. Auctions work like this. Basically they are listed for a set price. All cards start at the same price.
00:03:11.590 - 00:03:38.890, Speaker A: The duration of the auction is fixed, could be a few days, could be more. And then people just bid on the auction. It's an english auction. So basically you have to bid more than the previous bidder. There are small rules. If there is a bid that is put like at the last second of the auction, we'll put one more minute on the clock. So that other people that want to buy that car can still bid on that car.
00:03:38.890 - 00:04:09.776, Speaker A: And at the end of the auction, when the auction expires, basically we take the higher bid and we settle the trade. So why using an english auction to sell the cards? So there are a few reasons. The first one is price discovery. So we don't have to set a price for a card. The market will set the price. The second one is licensing constraints. For instance, we deal with the Premier League or with Paris and Jarma.
00:04:09.776 - 00:04:36.540, Speaker A: And in those contracts, basically we cannot sell players differently. We cannot say we're going to sell Kilian Mbappe for 100,000 cards and $100,000 and other players for like $100. We don't have the rights to do that. We have collective rights. So it's a way to put the players at the same price on the market. And finally, it's a game within the game. I mean, the auction market can be strategic.
00:04:36.540 - 00:05:17.020, Speaker A: The last minute of the auction can be quite intense for those who are bidding can be fun to watch as well. So that's why we are using english auctions on our marketplace in terms of ux constraints. So there's a few ux constraints for those english auctions. It has to be fast, right? Users want to have immediate feedback when they put a bid, it's a payment. When users pay and don't have immediate feedback, they kind of stress out. So it's super important that it is fast. It's a multiplayer game because multiple players can bid on the same auction at the same time.
00:05:17.020 - 00:06:01.700, Speaker A: So you have to take that into account. And finally it has to be secure, right? It's still a payment, it's a purchase and that's why it has to be secure. And that's where basically the blockchain comes in. So this is the auction lifecycle, how it works. So the first stage is to mint the NFT to one of our Sor's accounts. So at this stage, basically the owner of the card is a Sor account. Once the card is minted, we can list the auction, so we can set an auction on the market, a starting price, a duration, all of that.
00:06:01.700 - 00:06:51.250, Speaker A: Then it's the auction duration where basically people will put bids to win the card. And finally, at the end of the auction, we will settle the auction where the NFT will be transferred from the soar account to the user account in exchange for an east payment. So I think something that is super important is in this slide. So we only touch the blockchains at two places here. When we mint the NFT and when we settle the NFT, so all the auction mechanism is off chain. And I say for people that build on top of blockchain, you should only use the blockchain when you have to because ux on the blockchain is not perfect. Right.
00:06:51.250 - 00:07:37.090, Speaker A: Whereas if you have a web two experience, it's better ux. So yeah, I guess that would be the main thing to remember is don't build on chain what you don't have to. So I'll enter a little bit on the detail of how that works actually off chain. So whenever a user wants to submit a bid, he basically sends us a commitment. That commitment says I want to buy that NFT for that amount of east. And that's what they send. Basically that's how it looks like there is a signature which they basically sign that commitment with their own wallet.
00:07:37.090 - 00:08:25.978, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's basically how it works. So every time someone bids, we basically collect something like that, which we call a commitment. So at the end of the auction duration we've collected all those commitments and it's time for settlement. And the commitment I showed previously is like it's what we call a limit order in the Stackx context. And basically to settle we just need to match two orders. So at the end of the auction, Sor will produce an order that we will sign with our account saying we sell that card for that much amount. And the party b order you see is the one I showed previously.
00:08:25.978 - 00:09:13.290, Speaker A: So basically we have those two matching orders. We bind them together in something that we call a settlement request and then we send that basically to a Starquare gateway. And then basically for those who don't know, Starkx is some kind of a SaaS platform. It's an application specific roll up that basically does minting trading of tokens. Could be east, could be ERC 721. I think they just added support for ERC 1155s as well. So basically we submit that settlement request to Starquare, they generate a ZK proof and then this gets applied to the L2 state and then is committed on chain.
00:09:13.290 - 00:09:58.710, Speaker A: So there is one thing that is quite important. So as all the auction is off chain, we have to manage user balances off chain. As I said, a bid is a commitment and users should not be able to retract from a bid. Otherwise it kind of breaks the whole auction process because you could just come in, put a high bid and actually not pay and then basically you break the auction market. So how do we do that? So we have a concept of balances. We have two types of balances for every user. There's one we call the total balance, which is the exact amount of ease they have on L2.
00:09:58.710 - 00:10:42.850, Speaker A: And then we have a concept of what we call the available balance is the user total balance minus all the pending commitments. So they can bid on several cards at the same time. They can also make an offer for a card. So someone can come to my gallery and say, I want to buy this card for one east. That's also a commitment. So we keep track of all those commitments. So whenever a user makes a bid, we have to check, is that bid amount less than the available balance, same when he does a withdrawal, is that less than the available balance? If yes, we honor what the user is asking for.
00:10:42.850 - 00:11:39.300, Speaker A: You might ask, so what about, like, self custody if we have to approve withdrawals and payments? So Starkx has a mechanism called the escape hatch, where basically user can retrieve their funds to layer one without having Sor involved in the whole process. The good thing for us is that this whole escape hatch mechanism has a duration. It lasts for seven days. So basically the user will initiate an escape and it will only be able to actually retrieve the fund seven days later. So what that means is that all our auctions are less than seven days long. So we make sure that we can spend every commitment before a user makes a full withdrawal. So that's how we manage user balances and still be self custodian.
00:11:39.300 - 00:12:18.160, Speaker A: So on this, I wanted to do a demo, but I don't have access to a computer, so I recorded this. So basically, this is two users, one on the left, one on the right. They bid on the same card. So what is interesting to see is basically notifications of bids are built with websockets. So whenever someone bids here, it will reflect immediately for the other user. What is interesting as well that you can track is the balance here. It automatically updates when I bid, so it's instant feedback for the user.
00:12:18.160 - 00:12:29.250, Speaker A: And same if someone bids, basically the amount of my previous bid goes back to my balance. So this is what the UX looks like?
00:12:36.900 - 00:12:48.020, Speaker B: It, yeah. Okay.
00:12:52.900 - 00:12:56.050, Speaker A: Doesn't work. Okay.
00:12:58.900 - 00:12:59.650, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:13:03.080 - 00:13:31.440, Speaker A: Just one more thing. So we've talked about, like, normal bidding, but we also take advantage of one of the feature of StarkX, where basically you have limit orders. So the idea is that you can leverage partial settlements. So if someone sells a card for 0.1 east and you got a commitment from another user for 0.2 east, you can settle for 0.1 east.
00:13:31.440 - 00:14:09.596, Speaker A: And basically we launched a feature maybe a month ago, two months ago, which we call auto bidding. So basically you set the maximum amount you're willing to pay for a card and then basically we would bid on your behalf. Whenever there's new bid, we will bid just over the new bid but still below your max payment. And at the end we can settle for the actual auction price. So kind of optimizes how much you are going to spend on an auction. If an auction, because we have like auctions running twenty four seven. So if it's in the middle of the night at 02:00 a.m.
00:14:09.596 - 00:14:33.232, Speaker A: 03:00 a.m. You might not want to wake up at that time. So you can just set a max speed. So that's it for the auction market. So I think it's quite interesting. You can build like very good ux on top of Stackx. I've heard a lot where the past talks about account abstraction.
00:14:33.232 - 00:14:57.050, Speaker A: I think Stacknet, sorry, account abstraction could also bring a lot of ux possibilities in the auction market. So something we would like to look at as well. Thank you. If someone has questions.
00:14:59.660 - 00:15:10.200, Speaker B: Yeah. Yes.
00:15:10.270 - 00:15:19.790, Speaker A: So you can withdraw your. So nfts are minted on L2 and you can withdraw them to Ethereum main net. Sorry.
00:15:23.740 - 00:15:24.490, Speaker B: Yes.
00:15:26.300 - 00:15:48.000, Speaker A: So the question was, can you move your cards to layer one? Can you sell them on openC if you wish to? So the answer is yes. Basically you can go on any card you own and on the web app you can click on the button and say, I want to withdraw this card to this address on Mainet and then we handle all the withdrawal process for you and you can list it on Opensea.
00:15:55.060 - 00:16:11.300, Speaker B: Already locked enough balance for any reasons. For instance, the same client is engaged.
00:16:15.160 - 00:16:35.064, Speaker A: Yeah, that's a good question. So the question is, is there a risk that a user cannot actually make the payment at the end of the auction because he used some of his balance for something else? So right now we are built on Starkx, which is a siloed application. So basically you have to deposit east into the L2.
00:16:35.102 - 00:16:35.592, Speaker B: Right.
00:16:35.726 - 00:16:49.090, Speaker A: And that L2 is only used by us. So there's no other way of spending money than through us on that L2. So we control every payment and we can keep track exactly of what your balance is at any time.
00:16:57.670 - 00:16:59.860, Speaker B: If I get a rare card, can I.
00:17:03.370 - 00:17:37.710, Speaker A: So what can you do once you've purchased the card? Can you sell it on soar? So we have a secondary marketplace on the website where users can sell their cards, list their cards. So you cannot list auctions, but you can list for a set price. So the card that you purchase, you can say, I want to sell it for 1.2 east. And that is then there is a public marketplace where so our users can go to filter all of that and they can purchase your card from there. Or you can also make direct offers to other users, like more in an OTC fashion.
00:17:53.930 - 00:17:54.294, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:54.332 - 00:18:24.058, Speaker A: So the question is, when Starknet is mature, would we migrate to Starknet or would we stay on Stockx? What are the benefits? So I would say like today, Starkx is a single application, L2. It does minting and trading and it does it fairly well. It's optimized for that. So in terms of cost, it's really good, it's performant. So we're quite happy with that. The downside is that it's siloed.
00:18:24.074 - 00:18:24.266, Speaker B: Right.
00:18:24.308 - 00:18:57.930, Speaker A: So you cannot deploy custom logic. And if you want to use your cards elsewhere, you have to go through layer one, which is costly. So Starnet would offer that. I mean, there's multiple options, right? It could be publicnet where would be like any chain where you can then use your asset directly on that layer. It could be a private stacknet. Private startnet means that it's still only Sor, but we give the ability to the community to deploy custom code. Community or ourselves.
00:18:57.930 - 00:19:02.760, Speaker A: So yeah, I mean, it's a hard question. We haven't decided yet.
