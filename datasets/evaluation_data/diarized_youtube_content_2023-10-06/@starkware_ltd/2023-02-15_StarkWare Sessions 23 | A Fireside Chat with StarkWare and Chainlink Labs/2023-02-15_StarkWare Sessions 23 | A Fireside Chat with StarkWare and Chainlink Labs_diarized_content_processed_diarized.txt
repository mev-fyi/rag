00:00:03.140 - 00:00:38.850, Speaker A: Hi everyone. So I'm Ohad Barta from Stockware leading the Stocknet applications product team. And I'd like to introduce you to Todoris Caracostas. He's a blockchain partnership manager for Chainlink Clubs, the entity that helps to build Chainlink leading industry web3 services. Basically they connect real world data and services to the blockchain. So first of all, it's great to have you here.
00:00:39.220 - 00:01:01.704, Speaker B: Yeah, thank you very much Ohad, and thank you the whole team for the invitation. I don't know about the rest of the folks, but really for me the last couple of days have been really great. The talks have been very interesting and with all the people I spoke with, they all share the same passion for Ziki technology and for Starquare's roadmap, which is very, very energizing to see and engage with.
00:01:01.822 - 00:01:50.730, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, I think we both share this excitement actually. We work together for the better part of a year now and it's always been a pleasure. So yeah, I really want to announce an exciting news from our part and then we'll continue to discuss the implication with Todoris. So basically we formally announced like a partnership with Chainlink. So this partnership will greatly help to accelerate the growth of the Starknet ecosystem. It would help developers over Stocknet. And as part of this partnership, channeling feeds will be available on Starknet and Starknet will join the scale program that Chainlink has.
00:01:50.730 - 00:01:58.620, Speaker A: So yeah, maybe Todor. We can start by give a bit more background around Chainlink and what it is.
00:01:58.770 - 00:02:42.596, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. And yeah, honestly we're very happy to have the testnet feeds live and the main net feeds soon to follow in the imminent future. We see it as a great milestone. So happy to see that come to life. So for Chainlink, I'd like just to take a step back just to make sure that everyone is on the same page on the value Chainlink provides. I think we're all in agreement that we are in blockchain space and smart contracts because we really believe that they can reshape the world as we know it. The agreements and commitments we make in everyday life and smart contracts are pushing towards that goal by sharing some very key properties.
00:02:42.596 - 00:03:36.056, Speaker B: They are deterministic, they are reliable, they're temper proof. Now, smart contracts are great and these innovative advantages can help towards that direction. But by design, they do not source or they do not look for off chain data, they do not ingest that. That is a limitation which we have to solve if it is for this technology to gain adoption and change the world, as I said before, to fulfill that vision. And that is the oracle problem. Chainlink is the leading middleware solution, solving that exact problem for a variety of services and enabling trillions. We're over seven trillions now in transaction volume across defi, nfts, gaming, insurance, you name it, across many, many different verticals.
00:03:36.056 - 00:03:53.100, Speaker B: So in short, to wrap it up, Chainlink expands the capabilities of smart contracts by allowing access to off chain data or off chain computation that helps propel the space forward and advance and bring advanced use cases.
00:03:53.260 - 00:04:14.760, Speaker A: Yeah, amazing. So soon we'll do a more deep dive into the potential for developers from the great services that you'll have. But first, maybe just for the scope of the partnership will be more known. So what is exactly the scale program that Starknet is now joining to and what does the partnership and the fact that we joined this program mean from your perspective?
00:04:15.660 - 00:05:41.760, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a really critical question. I think it also ties a bit more as to why chain link and starkware as well, and then how that partnership helps bring that collaboration into fruition. Now, in terms of Starknet and Starkware, I remember Ellie's talk yesterday during the presentation that he gave about that great overview of history of Starknet and that fit that he easily observed between blockchain technology and starks. Now, leveraging Ethereum security while enabling DApps to scale in an advanced way with higher throughput, a higher number of transactions is a critical enabler for the industry. We're out. It means that projects now have the capability, through these technological advancements, to rival web two applications in terms of functionality, in terms of experience, without sacrificing any of the decentralization benefits. And that really has been actually confirmed, like over and over with Tarkax and the success you've seen by powering prominent protocols, but also attracting protocols from Ethereum to come and deploy on Starknet.
00:05:41.760 - 00:06:17.468, Speaker B: So as you said, we've been following that, the advancements from your end. We have been in touch for more than a couple of months, let's say we're over a year now. So I am very happy to see that coming into life. And the scale partnership in particular is, I see it as a vote of confidence from Starknet and a way to enable fast track the ecosystem to have a more data rich environment for the developers to innovate quickly on so that you can gain in adoption much faster.
00:06:17.644 - 00:06:43.252, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah. So maybe it's time to finally deep dive into what developers could do with your offering. Like how can one use your price feed and how and most notably, I'm personally always excited about things that Starknet and generally scalable systems allow. That wasn't possible before on Ethereum. So do you have any plans to make your offering different than Ethereum thanks to operating on Starknet?
00:06:43.396 - 00:07:48.412, Speaker B: Yeah, this is a long conversation going on between us as well as on a personal level. So with the testnet feeds now available and soon, as I mentioned before, the main net ones, Arcnet developers have access to the most secure and reliable data feeds. And before we go into the use cases, I just want to highlight that bit because it's very important. As we mentioned before, some key attributes of smart contract is security reliability. But if the input they ingest does not share the same standards, then it can be false or manipulated. Then the output of the smart contract, even though it operates 100% properly would also be false, would do something that is wrong, will be manipulatable if someone can actually manage the price, move the price. So the one major key offering of Chainlink and one that we pride ourselves on is that bit.
00:07:48.412 - 00:08:39.568, Speaker B: That's why the vast majority of the industry uses leverages Chainlink data feeds and that's why it is regarded as the industry standard and requirement from top protocols. Now when it comes to the particularities of Stacknet, the approach we'll have is we're going to start launching the service and maintain the same service level as with other chains because we've seen that being like a first point of demand. But we acknowledge that and we've already spoken to a big portion of your ecosystem trying to understand the particular needs, the capabilities that they have with Starnet. And we already collected that feedback and working on it actively to customize and provide advanced offerings for Starknet.
00:08:39.764 - 00:08:57.616, Speaker A: Amazing. Yeah, I'm looking forward to see what more things will create together. So you mentioned that previously that the scale program would allow developers to really lower the cost, right, and develop faster. Can you elaborate a bit more on what's the connection between the two?
00:08:57.718 - 00:09:39.196, Speaker B: Yeah, of course. I don't know if I mentioned that definition before about Chainlink being a decentralized oracle network, but typically that's the first thing people know of chain link. If we want to be 100% accurate. Chain link is a collection of decentralized Oracle networks. It's not a single one. And every dawn, as we call it, is responsible for putting the price of one particular asset on chain. There are high quality independent node operators in each one, sourcing from premium off chain APIs, coming to consensus and then posting that price on chain.
00:09:39.196 - 00:11:04.792, Speaker B: They are in fact responsible for the computation required and the security guarantees through the process to make sure that the price is posted in the right way. So for node operators to do that, there needs to be a financial incentive, they need to be sustainable, right? And with Starkware joining the Chainlink build program scale program, I'm very sorry, build program helps cover the operating costs and in an easy way fast track and supercharge the available data that these node operators can bring onto the chain. So by helping them achieve sustainability and financial, and reach the financial means goals, Starquare offers their developers a wider variety of data across many different assets. A higher update frequency given that now there will be faster update on chain that also is powered by it being an l two. So the costs are much cheaper already, but you can imagine multiple times that because of the support from starkware. And third, their price will be lower because there will not need to be sufficient on chain demand from protocols for these particular feeds before they become available. That will be in the future as demand grows.
00:11:04.792 - 00:11:10.750, Speaker B: But you make available a testing bed with different data points for developers to innovate on.
00:11:11.840 - 00:11:33.008, Speaker A: Yeah, very nice. So yeah, anything more you'd like to share with the audience around? So we have testnet live feeds of all the prices available now, maintenance soon. Anything else you plan for the next year in the context of stocknet or in general for Chainlink?
00:11:33.184 - 00:12:19.904, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a great question. So Chainlink, by now it's not only about data feeds. It encompasses a collection of different Oracle services, proof of reserve, chain link automation, any API, VRF. There are multiple different services now under the Oracle umbrella and we are constantly working in iterating and improving them, but also launching new products like CCIP, across chain interoperability protocol. All of these advancements are things that will be put on our roadmap. But I would like to kind of turn the tables a bit and show how we think from a shailing perspective, how we operate when it comes to a roadmap. We have very, very big plans for 2023 and beyond.
00:12:19.904 - 00:12:57.276, Speaker B: But what we find the most critical part for us is to keep an ear on the ground, to the ground, and hear user feedback, market feedback. What is the stuff you want to prioritize? What is stuff you want to see? As we spoke before about customizing because of Startnet, please reach out to us to let us know. Like if you test the testnet feeds, go on our docs page, check them out, try and see what can they service you, whatnot, and give us feedback. That's why we are here myself and Halcyon. I think he's there. Thank you. Because I cannot really see with the lights on who's who.
00:12:57.276 - 00:13:06.220, Speaker B: But please reach out to us. We're happy to hear what you would like to prioritize and market feedback has always been the driving force of our roadmap.
00:13:06.380 - 00:13:18.000, Speaker A: Yeah. I can testify from my experience working with you are always very adaptive to the need and very professional. So I'm sure more feedback will do us all good for continuing this integration and expanding it.
00:13:18.070 - 00:13:19.552, Speaker B: Thank you. That's very kind of you to say.
00:13:19.606 - 00:13:21.530, Speaker A: Yeah. Thank you.
