00:00:02.570 - 00:00:39.880, Speaker A: This should be the second spiciest panel, I guess, to the builders at the other side of the now, we'll keep it a little less extravagant, but my name is Ria Vannouver from Brevin Howard digital, here to learn, like you all, about what validators are doing. Kubi and I were discussing what the title is. I said he didn't put it in, but my title was our proposers, or validators, dumb. So today we're going to find out if they're sophisticated or just passing messages or signing them. But why don't we start with just quick intros, kind of go down the line. We've got a good mix of participants here, so it should be good. Victor, want to start?
00:00:40.490 - 00:00:59.840, Speaker B: Hi everyone, my name is Victor Boynan. I've been working on staking stuff for the last five years, originally with a company called Bison Trails, and then we got acquired by Coinbase. And I've been Coinbase for the last three years. We're the largest staking operator. We run a lot of Ethereum, Solana, and a bunch of other networks. And there I work in protocol stuff, help them figure out which protocols to work on and how they work and all that good stuff.
00:01:00.690 - 00:01:18.318, Speaker C: Hi, I'm Steve Flanagan. I build Ethereum engineering at figment. So all the engineering that powers our APIs are self serving Ethereum staking app. I'm the one who, when we talk about forking MeV boost and adding ten features and all that, I have to figure out whether we should actually do it. So eager to talk about it.
00:01:18.504 - 00:01:36.422, Speaker D: Yeah. Hi everybody, I'm Michael. I'm head of research at course one. We are validator. We have around 3 billion in assets. Now, some of you might know our paper on latency games and the cost of artificial latency. Others might have read our paper on MeV on Dydx four and how that can be mitigated.
00:01:36.422 - 00:01:42.140, Speaker D: So we've done a lot of research on Mev timing games for json things and. Happy to talk about it.
00:01:42.670 - 00:02:04.420, Speaker E: Hi everyone, I'm Ernest Opetti. I lead the product team at Kiln. So we are a Paris based staking company focused on Ethereum. We run about 40,000 e validators at the moment. Obviously, time and games is a topic we discussed a lot internally these days, and so super happy to chat about this.
00:02:05.750 - 00:02:44.574, Speaker A: Nice. That's great. Yeah, it sounds like they're sophisticated, not too dumb, which is good. I thought it'd be good to just kind of start with some baseline questions. And obviously maybe these views are your own and not your employers. Or maybe you can kind of caveat some of this stuff, but I'm just kind of curious, what part of the risk spectrum do you guys sort of play in? Is it frontier where you're trying out the newest, latest and greatest, maybe latency or other client changes, or is it, we're still not doing that and just try to get a sense and maybe it's like we have internal discussions so you don't have to talk about everything. But it'd be really curious to kind of just see the risk appetite of different participants up here.
00:02:44.574 - 00:02:45.886, Speaker A: Maybe we start on the other end.
00:02:45.908 - 00:03:56.280, Speaker E: Ernest sure, yeah. So I think we're both very risk averse and we are sophisticated in the sense that we do participate in timing games, but we do it extremely carefully. So we did it on testnet for a while and now we're doing it on main net. We are continuously tuning things and we really look at the impact that it has such that we don't have an adverse effect on the network. So we've done a lot of measurement on this and actually published some of our research on e three research. And the reason we got comfortable with doing this is that we don't notice degradation in the attestation rewards of the subsequent slot when we perform delays, intentional delays and other metrics as well. So that's what got us comfortable with doing it.
00:03:56.280 - 00:04:03.740, Speaker E: But it's something we're continuously kind of like monitoring to make sure that we don't have this adverse effect.
00:04:04.910 - 00:04:05.858, Speaker A: Let's maybe go to the next.
00:04:05.884 - 00:04:06.938, Speaker B: And two, I'd be curious, what does.
00:04:06.944 - 00:04:09.850, Speaker A: It mean to be risk averse? Is it just don't miss a slot?
00:04:10.690 - 00:04:45.414, Speaker E: Yeah, well it's obviously like slashing first secure. That's the asymmetric risk in ethereum staking, but then it's ensuring we don't miss a slot. And obviously it's about tuning things carefully. It's about having also a very diversified setup. So we run Prism, Techu and Lighthouse on the consensus client. We run a majority nethermine now on execution client and in two different clouds, adding a third soon. So that gives you resilience as well.
00:04:45.414 - 00:04:47.622, Speaker E: So that's what it's about.
00:04:47.676 - 00:04:54.362, Speaker A: I got you. I thought you were just going to say don't piss off Justin Drake, but much better answer. Let's keep going down the line.
00:04:54.496 - 00:05:06.942, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So I'll address this by starting with your second question first. What is the risk? Right, so let's make a quick attempt at a risk taxonomy here. I think one risk is the idiosyncratic software you run.
00:05:06.996 - 00:05:07.214, Speaker A: Right?
00:05:07.252 - 00:05:45.594, Speaker D: So if you fork something, there's of course a risk of a bug. There's a risk of maybe you're doing something on the network level now that might not work out the way you think it works out. So there's this type of risk. The second type of risk is missing a slot, which is something which we've been able to mitigate fully. So we feel good about that side of things. And then I would say the third type of risk would be the negative externalities that you impose on Ethereum. And the way we've gone around mitigating the deferred type of risk is by basically publishing a 20 page paper which tells people what we do.
00:05:45.594 - 00:06:20.146, Speaker D: It's very clear about the externalities that might arise from it. And then, like Ernest said, we also run parameters which are relatively conservative. So we balance things out this way. Then, of course you have to try things out. Right. And the way we reflect that is we have one cluster which we run with internal capital. So we've been around for a while and are lucky to have a strong balance sheet, and there we can try things out on Mainet to make sure that they're in good shape by the time they hit client validators.
00:06:20.146 - 00:06:40.380, Speaker D: So what we do is, yes, we take risk, but we take the risk ourselves. And then once we roll something out to clients, it's been tested for a really long time, for example, for timing games. We've been doing this since summer, so we have six solid months of data, and that was kind of the minimum which we needed to roll it out client side.
00:06:43.070 - 00:07:07.166, Speaker C: So these guys have both touched on. This is how we think about deploying to testnets and seeing if it works technology wise, which is definitely like, I won't repeat that, that's essential. And you can get really good insight into how likely are you to suffer some kind of bug from your fork and miss slots. I guess the only other thing I would add as well, though, is that there's an economic element here, right. If things work on Testnet, that's all well and good, but on main net there's actual funds at stake.
00:07:07.198 - 00:07:07.346, Speaker A: Right.
00:07:07.368 - 00:07:26.794, Speaker C: And you'll see slightly different behavior. So using your own capital is a great way to test that. That's something we do as well. We also are able to roll things out to different cohorts within our validator set. Right. We have validators in various regions, and we can test if it works in this region well. And that region well, which ties into these latency games are very related to your infrastructure, right.
00:07:26.794 - 00:07:59.480, Speaker C: How closely are you connected to the relays? And so for us, that's something we're often trying to observe, like use our data science team and tap on them to say, hey, how many mainnet players have you observed doing this? And what is the sample size for whether or not we can be confident that we won't have builders playing some kind of interesting economic play. So for us, it's definitely all about trying to observe the actual economics as well as the technology risks and using known risk parameterization to figure out whether it's something that makes sense to try.
00:08:01.210 - 00:09:03.002, Speaker B: So I guess we're the dumbest ones of everybody. I think that the way that we look at it as companies cloud is we try to run things in a way that's not only performant, but extremely secure. And so when we think about these customizations, modifications, timing games, I think that the spotlight on a player like Coinbase is very different from the spotlight on other folks. I think the customers that we service have different things that they're optimizing for oftentimes. And so of course the reward rate is always going to be important. But when you're thinking about the decision makers of these very, very large asset holders, when you think about the decision makers of folks like Brevin Howard, right, and other institutions, you often find that the reward rate there's an acceptable bound and the optimization around rewards are actually not as big of a driver of the decision making as you would otherwise think. I think that over time that will change.
00:09:03.002 - 00:09:34.740, Speaker B: And I think probably in the next five years, as the space continues to get more institutionalized, as more larger players come in, if we end up having ETH ETFs at some point, which would be quite nice, that is going to change. But I think right now we just haven't seen it to be as big of a decision making framework. And so from our standpoint, we've shied away from making these different customizations and modifications, and we focus entirely on just running our things in the most performant way and the most distributed way that we can multi cloud, multi region and so on.
00:09:35.350 - 00:09:36.194, Speaker E: That's good.
00:09:36.312 - 00:09:56.620, Speaker A: And maybe I'll do it. I'll save one question for Victor, but ask, you know, how do you think about investing in resources towards these changes? Are there, I don't know, war rooms of teams, someone's doing something, you notice it, and all of a sudden you get the whole team on board, or what drives the decision making? How do you guys sort of think about that?
00:09:59.150 - 00:10:45.260, Speaker E: So it's like how do we prioritize doing this work? Yeah, I would say for us it was like looking at the discussions with other operators. And there is, I would say, maybe contrary slightly to Victor's customer base, for us, we have seen an interest in these slightly higher rewards that we can achieve in some. Yeah, it was about testing things out and then putting some engineering resource on it, but it wasn't a crazy amount of engineering resource either. For us it was a gradual thing, but it made sense to do it.
00:10:46.430 - 00:11:13.106, Speaker D: Yeah. So for us, I think our path is a little unusual in that this started off as an academic interest. We just wanted to understand how PBS works as good as we can. And this is something which seemed like an idiosyncrasy that can be exploited. And so the next logical step was to try things out and to see if theory holds up in practice. And that did quite well. And then from there we started exploring with customers.
00:11:13.106 - 00:11:33.820, Speaker D: And again, much like Ernest mentioned, our client base likes to be at an attractive spot and have the risk reward curve. We have clients that are super risk averse, like Coinbase for example, and they have the option to opt out. But for others it's attractive. And for that reason we already had everything in place from our exploration and we took it from there.
00:11:35.870 - 00:11:40.506, Speaker A: Yeah. I don't know if you have more to add. If not, I can ask you guys a separate question. I don't know if you know.
00:11:40.688 - 00:12:16.120, Speaker C: So for figment, I mean, we're trying to give the best risk adjusted reward, right? And so from our end it's really about you can quantify this risk and you can say, hey, given this sample size, we know that no one has missed a proposal doing this yet, but with an n is of like 900, we can tell you what is likelihood you will in the next year, right? And if you're getting 7% APR versus 6.9 for nine months, but then get slashed, right, it wasn't worth optimizing for that. So for us it's about presenting to the client, showing them what the risk actually is in a quantified way, and then they trust us to steer them to the best reward over years rather than months.
00:12:16.650 - 00:12:43.118, Speaker A: And Victor, maybe I'll ask you less making adjustments, I guess. What do you see changing in the market structure? Maybe from this you kind of touched on know your client base, which people like Brevin just want a safe place to stake for now. But what are the kind of the market structure things that you kind of see coming and maybe even all the way to things like DBT if you guys were to try to run a cluster with someone else that had modified their client, maybe. I haven't thought about that yet, but be kind of curious around some of those things.
00:12:43.284 - 00:13:01.058, Speaker B: Yeah, for sure. I think that there's a clear trend in terms of where assets end up. And if you think about it, the industry started being literally 100% self custodial at the time that Satoshi mined the very first block. And I think that over time that's going to continue moving towards these asset aggregators.
00:13:01.074 - 00:13:01.206, Speaker D: Right?
00:13:01.228 - 00:13:55.350, Speaker B: So custodians, exchanges, ETFs, banks, fintechs, et cetera. And so I think those parties offering that service to their end users are going to be risk averse, right? And they're going to be extremely conscious around the decisions that they make. And so I expect that trend to continue over time. And I'll say it personally, a bunch of my friends have gone fished or have gotten hacked. More and more folks and more and more OGs even that have self custody for years are now storing a portion of their assets at Coinbase prime, for example, or the vault product within Coinbase. And so I expect that trend to continue and these folks will be much more considerate in their decisions. Having said that, there are always going to be hedge funds and other asset managers that are going to be extremely yield conscious, and that's going to be a very active part of the market as well.
00:13:55.350 - 00:14:11.470, Speaker B: And so if you're creating, for example, financial products that leverage ETH staking in some way, or you're trying to somehow give people exposure to that in a way that's like super high performance, you're going to obviously make different choices than if you're Morgan offering it to your retail end users.
00:14:12.450 - 00:14:13.278, Speaker E: That's good.
00:14:13.364 - 00:14:37.780, Speaker A: And I don't know who wants to answer this, but I'm curious on your takes around the skepticism the community has with making client adjustments. Is it justified? That's why I was trying to hit on what does it mean to be risk adverse? Is it just about missing slots? Is there skepticism about screwing with consensus? I'm just kind of curious if anyone has views whether it's justified or not.
00:14:38.710 - 00:15:10.142, Speaker C: I think it screws with consensus. I think increased latency does increase the risk of reorg. Just if you think about what latency means, right, and how you're going to propagate to the attestation committee. But at the same time, that means the fix needs to happen at the protocol level. If you build a protocol that incentivizes this behavior, you then need to enshrine a fix for that and enshrine the right incentives and penalties for it. So when you're in a world like crypto, and you're in a world where you have profit seeking actors serving you, you need to pay them to do the behavior you want. So maybe Electra has something around this, maybe the upgrade after that has something around this.
00:15:10.142 - 00:15:21.780, Speaker C: But I do think the negative sentiment is justified from like an idealist, I want the best network possible framework. But I also don't think know profit seeking actors are doing anything wrong by behaving as you're paying them to.
00:15:22.550 - 00:16:09.822, Speaker B: Can I actually touch on that as well? I strongly agree with that point. And I think at the end of the day, if you look at any kind of system that's designed in the real world, whether financial, otherwise, there are these bounds that you approach over time, at which point things are too bad. And I think that here we're extremely lucky in that because of the open nature of these things, we see the block proposals, we see the misses, we see the reorgs. And so there is an upper bound to how bad things can get. And so if you see that this particular provider is actually worsening network performance in a way that is actively noticeable, then that is a very clear signal to the market. It's visible to everybody, and people can actually action upon it, even outside of fixing protocol stuff. But just like applying social pressure, and I think that's where the social layer of ethereum is extremely important.
00:16:09.822 - 00:16:33.130, Speaker B: That's where core devs are extremely important. And ultimately, clients vote with their feet, right? Nobody wants to stake with, with somebody that's a bad actor, right? If you're staking it, like on Salana, for example, people were doing this thing where they increase their validator fee 100% and then decreasing it back down to zero so that they would take all the rewards. It's like if you see that kind of behavior and you're staking with that player, obviously you're going to switch, right? And so it's just about shining a light to those things. And that's where I think Ethereum really shines.
00:16:34.270 - 00:17:25.290, Speaker D: Yeah, sure. So happy to take this as well. I think one other way of looking at blockchains is of looking at them as very resilient, decentralized systems, and systems that are resilient to things like self interest and to competition. And for that reason, I think if there's a flaw in the system, that can be, I don't want to say exploited, but that certain parties can benefit from ignoring it is not going to be a solution. Right. I think the system should be set up in a way to be resilient to things like that. We wouldn't do it without being public about it, but now that we've published our paper on it, and we look forward to engaging with the community and to making sure that all of that happens in a manner which is aligned now in that way, I think it's very consistent with the blockchain ethos.
00:17:25.950 - 00:18:25.226, Speaker E: Yeah. Maybe just to add a bit on your point about the market structure changing, potentially. So I think there's this interesting thing that there's also like unintentional delays. So validators running in regions that are basically not Europe and the US earn higher MeV rewards on average because they have latency. And so they're sort of like delaying in the slot. Actually, the optimized validators are penalized in a way, so I think that should get solved somehow. And then in terms of the other thing we're seeing that's interesting is the delay being introduced at the relayer level with, I guess like blocks root is one of the first ones to do this with a paid product to do that, I think it's a bit risky because the relayer has less of a view on the validator's performance.
00:18:25.226 - 00:18:43.906, Speaker E: So, like, the validator, I think is better placed to actually perform these timing games in a safe way because they can see their sort of propagation times better than the relayer can. So that's like an interesting thing to monitor. I think that's good.
00:18:43.928 - 00:19:14.622, Speaker A: That kind of leads into the next question I have is just around vertical integration or verticalization of this whole stack. Maybe if you're doing it now, talk about it. If not, where do you see it going? Is Coinbase going to start running a relay? I don't know, maybe not, but I'm just kind of curious around that. And if not, like how you engage with relays, the feedback loop that takes place, that's one great example on the latency side, but everyone wants to take that mean.
00:19:14.676 - 00:20:39.030, Speaker B: I'll answer, Coinbase is not running really, nor do we have plans to. I think the way that we look at this know in some ways also answers the previous questions around market structure, we try to always use as credibly neutral and decentralized systems, processes, protocols, infrastructure that we can. And so from that perspective, I think the value of us staying in a perfect world. What I want, right, if Morgan starts staking, I want for all validators, including ones that are run by Morgan, to be unappinionated to be credibly neutral. And so when it comes to a lot of that stuff, there's this inherent trade off of, like, you in many ways, want to keep validators dumb, right? You want them to be unappinated. You don't want to introduce this kind of vertical integration, and you want to minimize the amount of opinions or perspectives that you have on anything, but you want to be able to outsource that work to these systems that you do believe are credibly neutral and so like the equivalent of Mevboos or maybe like suave in the future when it launches. And so from that perspective, I think we're very, very keen to continue to use those technologies and to participate in those ways without trying to stake our claim and be like, yeah, we own all the things and run all the things and so on and so forth by trying to do this vertical integration.
00:20:39.610 - 00:21:16.274, Speaker C: I love that. I'm really glad that's how you're thinking about it. I would even say just also from a pragmatic perspective, relays are quite hard to build and quite hard to do well. And builders also, these are really specialized skills that take entire technology stacks that are different from how you might build a staking provider. They have a different compliance burden than staking providers do. So I also just think it would be very difficult to run a business that is doing what staking providers do and do that really well, and then also do what relays do and then also do what builders do. I think the scale of that business would have to be like billions in manpower, which maybe that does happen one day.
00:21:16.274 - 00:21:26.390, Speaker C: But from my perspective, I think being a great staking provider is already quite a lot to bite off. And I don't know if you'd still be a great staking provider if you were also trying to run relays personally.
00:21:27.770 - 00:21:34.442, Speaker D: Yeah. So far, I think relays are still primarily a cost center, and for that reason, we really wouldn't want to go there.
00:21:34.496 - 00:21:34.762, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:34.816 - 00:22:06.760, Speaker D: It makes sense for a builder, doesn't make sense for a validator, and then by extension, it doesn't make sense for us to become a builder. And the reason for that is that MeV is basically a transformation on order flow plus information. So let's say statistical arbitrage. We don't have one or the other. And for that reason, I think that the hurdles here would be unrealistically large. No plans of that nature, but happy to work with people and to kind of explore that.
00:22:07.450 - 00:22:39.214, Speaker E: Yeah, I agree with what's been said. So proposal builder separation is important. For sensitive resistance. From a pragmatic point of view, we are not our job at Kiln. We don't see that as our job to get into the relay builder game. I will say that it's good that there are new relays coming online, including fine folks sitting at the first row here at Titan, because there needs to be more, better relays. There's some issues there still.
00:22:39.214 - 00:22:51.762, Speaker E: I think maybe the incentives are not always good enough for some relays to run, but. So, yeah, we're really happy to have more coming on board. That's important things to look out for.
00:22:51.896 - 00:22:52.482, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:22:52.616 - 00:23:25.066, Speaker B: And if I can just self show something that we did for a second, because you were talking about how relays don't have this great business model. So one of the things that Coinbase did, we contributed one hundred K to the PBS foundation, and its goal is not only to fund PBS research and trimen and all that stuff, but it's also to help fund the relays that are in operation right now and to enable them to kind of tide over until some of these questions are figured out around how they have a sustainable business model. So we're happy to give back to the ecosystem.
00:23:25.098 - 00:23:55.400, Speaker A: From that perspective, if anyone's building a relay. Sounds like there's some grants out there. Yeah, just one more. I want to talk kind of about the future, and I'll let you guys take this in any direction. I'm really interested, though. Maybe it's outside of this, but are there other demands from your clients other than latency or other ideas you're willing to share if you're making adjustments to clients or investigating areas of research that could increase rewards but may not be latency related? I guess one of those is geolocate. You kind of hit on that.
00:23:55.400 - 00:24:04.300, Speaker A: I don't know if there's things like that, but if not just something about the future, of what it means to validate a block in Ethereum and where you see it going over the next few.
00:24:09.950 - 00:25:35.960, Speaker B: You know, one of the things I think is that it's in some ways going to be less important to be a validator on Ethereum over the coming years in that so much of the economic activity, and therefore the MEV, is moving to roll ups, that over time, just the percentage of economics you get from a lot of these games and things like that on Ethereum is going to be really quite small relative to the amount of economic activity that's happening on roll ups and happening cross chain and so on. And so from the total amount will increase, but as a percentage, it'll shrink. And so one of the things that we're thinking a lot about is what will the roll up space look like? Right? Is it that we as an infrastructure provider should be running sequencers or backup sequencers, or participating in systems like espresso or suave and so on? And so the thing that I think a lot about is how do we, if there's a metric to kind of look at, it's almost like, what percentage of economic activity does coinbase cloud support across the crypto ecosystem? Right? And that's validators, that's sequencers. It might include bridges, it might include oracles, it might include anything that requires infrastructure. And so that to me is a little bit of a different way of thinking. That's bigger picture, whereas I see the, especially the MEV stuff and the latency games on Ethereum just becoming a smaller proportion of that picture and therefore less important over time.
00:25:36.890 - 00:26:24.440, Speaker C: I think from our side, at any given time, we probably have like 100 cool ideas and experiments we're running for, how can we increase rewards, how can we optimize? So it's very hard to see any subset of those actually make it into customers hands right now. All of these have complicated risk profiles. I think a pet favorite of mine, at least, is looking at opportunities for cross chain Mev and cross venue Mev, trying to match more interesting data sources of like what's happening on one of these l two s. Are we participating in a decentralized sequencer and seeing interesting activity? And maybe we're getting the chance to participate in that while we're also proposing on Ethel one. So I think that's like a really fertile space and really unexplored. So that's what I get really hyped up about. That's not a promise we're going to do it, but I get really excited about it.
00:26:25.290 - 00:26:48.238, Speaker D: Yeah. So at the moment, in a timer games context, the value of any additional millisecond you save, that's kind of going down marginally. Right. And for that reason, really, every dollar we spend now has decreasing returns to some extent. But we have some things in the pipeline. We have a quarterly research report. It's called the quarterly insights, if somebody wants to catch up with that.
00:26:48.238 - 00:27:40.720, Speaker D: And one thing that we are going to roll out pretty soon is we've noticed that the auction is not always timed consistently. So one thing you can do in a timing games context is you can take that into account and then it helps you on the reward side, but it also helps you on the risk side. So that's one thing. I think a second thing is we've noticed certain things just on the network layer, and I feel like some of this stuff might also be transferable to other networks. So Ethereum is the elephant in the room. But we've been around Cosmos and tendermint for a long time, for example, and block times there are getting faster, which means if you understand kind of the p to P layer, and if you understand the way the network works, there's definitely new shores that you can have a look at. And that's what we are going to do in the next few months.
00:27:42.130 - 00:28:08.760, Speaker E: Yeah, I would say we don't have any precise plans to improve further overperformance, I would say. Or like the performance of our validators. It's really about tuning and stability and continuously plugging into new relays, that kind of stuff. This is e Denver 2024, so I should say we're looking at restaking as well.
00:28:09.690 - 00:28:11.160, Speaker A: So waiting for that.
00:28:11.610 - 00:28:31.600, Speaker E: That's another big area of focus for us right now. And then also, like DVT, we're live on, on SSV and soon on oball as well. So it's also about giving our customers more customization options in terms of the exact pattern of how we're staking for them.
00:28:32.210 - 00:28:37.390, Speaker A: Well, I think that will wrap it up. Thank you to all our panelists being open, more open than the builders.
00:28:38.210 - 00:28:38.700, Speaker E: Thank you.
