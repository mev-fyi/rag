00:00:05.450 - 00:00:24.966, Speaker A: On chain with Eman Gunsira. Hi, everyone. Welcome to a new edition of the podcast with a brand new title this time, and a fantastic guest with me today. I have with me Tim Roughgarden. Welcome on board, Tim.
00:00:25.028 - 00:00:25.730, Speaker B: Thanks, Ken.
00:00:25.810 - 00:01:10.334, Speaker A: So Tim is a professor of computer science at Columbia University. He is also the head of research at a 16 z crypto. So that's Anderson Horowitz, I think, the top VC firm in the country and probably the world. Tim, welcome. And I think it's good to sort of give some context to the audience about who you are and your involvement in crypto. So I know you, of course, from your days at Cornell when you were a Cornell PhD student, just as I was starting out to be a professor, a young professor. And for the audience's info, there are two kinds of computer scientists.
00:01:10.334 - 00:01:38.682, Speaker A: I always think of them as wearing different hats. So I'm on one extreme, the sort of the hard hat wearing, engineering extreme. And then there is the supremely mathematical theoretical extreme, which I always think of as wearing conical hats. So it's a different wizard hat. So wizards and builders, if you will. And Tim is obviously a very good example of the latter. But tell us a little bit about your involvement in crypto, how you got into it.
00:01:38.736 - 00:01:55.246, Speaker B: Yeah, absolutely. So thanks for having really, really fun to be. So it all started with my whole career, my calling card has kind of been working on topics at the boundary of computer science and economics. So you alluded to back when we first met. Now it's a little over 20 years.
00:01:55.268 - 00:01:57.140, Speaker A: Ago, 23 years, kind of crazy.
00:01:59.590 - 00:02:33.066, Speaker B: And you actually came to my practice job talk, and you gave me some great feedback before I sort of went out and looked for academic jobs, which I'm still very grateful for. So back then, I was thinking about game theory in the context of networks, specifically sort of routing and networks, and this big field of algorithmic game theory just kind of exploded. I was really sort of at the right place at the right time at Cornell. Avatardosh was my advisor. We worked together on initial algorithm game theory problems. A bunch of other people got excited, and the field just became a very vibrant area with lots of different application. So I sort of rode that wave through a lot of my career.
00:02:33.066 - 00:03:03.298, Speaker B: There just were application after application coming up in computer science that needed economic or game theoretic reasoning. And so know, fast forward to when sort of crypto comes along. First bitcoin and then all the other kind of blockchains that sort of started coming out. And it obviously got my attention immediately because you go back to the original Nakamoto paper. You go back to that white paper, and there's game theory. Nakamoto very clearly understood the game theory around sort of the 50% threshold and this kind of thing. That was kind of relatively simple game theory.
00:03:03.298 - 00:03:54.066, Speaker B: In the Nakamoto paper, he was thinking about specific types of private chain attacks and this kind of thing. Honestly, goon. I mean, in your paper with the Taiya, maybe that's kind of the ten year anniversary now, I think. So that paper also really got my attention at the time because it's like, oh, wow, not only is there game theory in this technology, but there's sophisticated game theory in this technology. That's actually a pretty hard paper, pretty interesting paper. So it was on my radar screen kind of very early, and so I kind of monitored it, honestly, for many years. And I was like, okay, is this an area that's just going to have one great paper, your paper, with its eye, or is there actually going to be, like, an area here? Are there going to be PhD students writing their thesis in this area? Is there going to be enough depth? And honestly, I had to follow along for several years before I really became convinced, because one thing that was clear to me early on is that if I was going to work in this area, it was going to have to be a full time affair.
00:03:54.066 - 00:04:41.314, Speaker B: Like, being a dileton in this area just seemed like a waste of time. And so I was like, okay, well, if I'm going to bet a chunk of my career on this area, I want to have some conviction that it's going to be not just one that'll be meaningful technology that affects people's lives, of course, but also just that there's going to be enough scientific depth that it's worth me spending sort of several years of my career on it. And so eventually, so I started getting kind of calls from lots of people, maybe 2016, 2017 calls from people saying, like, we really need a computer scientist who knows a lot about mechanism design. And I kind of thought they were like, a prank call at the time, because especially when you're a theoretician like me, that is just, like, not the daily experience, like people knocking down your door for what you thought was esoteric expertise, basically. So that obviously also got my attention. At that time, I was at Stanford. I shared a wall with Dan Bonet.
00:04:41.314 - 00:05:01.174, Speaker B: Joe Boneau was Dan's postdoc at that time. So all of these things, forces were sort of coming together, and I was learning more and more about the area. And I'd say by 2019, or so I was ready to go all in. I finished up some other projects. I saw that there was sort of interesting mechanism design. I saw there was interesting cryptography. I saw there was interesting sort of consensus and distributed computing.
00:05:01.174 - 00:05:33.494, Speaker B: And that's just at the infrastructure level, let alone kind of at the application layer. And I said, okay, there is actually many years of work minimum to do here. And I wound up being great timing, because then in 2020, the Ethereum community reached out to me, asked for my help in sort of assessing this transaction fee mechanism that they rolled out, EIP 1559. That was literally just maybe six months after I decided to go full time into this area. So I devoted many months of my life trying to understand that fee mechanism and its sort of mathematical properties. Since then, I've really just been all in.
00:05:33.692 - 00:06:15.398, Speaker A: Yeah, you have. And you've worked on quite a few different topics, which I hope to cover in a second. But tell us a little bit about the recent transition from being a professor to venture capital research within venture capital. So that's a really exciting new thing. And I have to give kudos to a 16 z. So, just so everyone knows, a lot of venture capitalists will say all sorts of things about how much they work to build up a field. And you see people hiring people on people who make noise, perhaps, but you very rarely see a VC firm actually going in and getting the best in the base.
00:06:15.398 - 00:06:35.174, Speaker A: And a 16 Z nailed it. They got, I think, a star spangled cast. So you're heading in. Tell us a little bit about that transition. And there are so many other questions I'm going to have to ask you, starting with, of course, how come you're not wearing a typical VC vest? That's, of course, on all our minds. But tell us a little bit about that. What prompted it, and what have you discovered?
00:06:35.222 - 00:06:46.094, Speaker B: Yeah, not as funny. No. It's been an amazing opportunity and experience. As far as the vest thing, I'm not that young, as you know. Right. I don't know.
00:06:46.212 - 00:06:54.574, Speaker A: I went to an A 16 Z event. I got a vest. I have one. So it's really interesting to see one without, in any case.
00:06:54.612 - 00:07:07.582, Speaker B: Fair enough. Yeah. Actually, honestly, this story kind of continues where I left off the answer to the previous question. Right. So end of 2020, I put out this sort of long 58 page report. Assessing. Yep.
00:07:07.582 - 00:07:32.220, Speaker B: 50 59. And it got a lot of attention. And at Andreas and Horowitz, honestly, like a lot of people there I knew back from my time as a standard professor, many of them took courses from me, in fact. So a lot of them knew who I was and knew I did algorithmic game theory. But until that paper came out, I don't think any of them knew how all in I was on this area. It was like, whoa, okay. Evidently, Tim thought it was worth the time to spend to write a 50 page paper.
00:07:32.220 - 00:08:03.526, Speaker B: And so I think that probably gave them the idea that maybe they should reach out. Beginning of 2021, I joined just kind of in an advisory capacity. That's the same capacity that Dan Bonet has worked with them for many years. And so then they got to know me a little bit better over the course of 2020. I mean, this is in the depths of COVID This was all kind of zoom, but still, they got a sense of me. I got a good sense of the people there with the nature of the work, all those kinds of things. And so toward the end of 2021, they approached me with this opportunity to really found a new research lab.
00:08:03.628 - 00:08:06.182, Speaker A: You got that? How many researchers now?
00:08:06.316 - 00:08:12.838, Speaker B: So we have seven full time people, plus one or two who are kind of in a one day a week capacity.
00:08:12.934 - 00:08:23.310, Speaker A: So just for the audience, I think, how many university departments are there with seven top notch theoretical researchers?
00:08:23.810 - 00:08:28.782, Speaker B: You'd have to go to the very big departments. Yeah, there's a couple, but it's a short.
00:08:28.836 - 00:08:30.734, Speaker A: It's a center of excellence that's been built up.
00:08:30.772 - 00:08:32.240, Speaker B: It's a short list, for sure.
00:08:35.090 - 00:08:40.442, Speaker A: How is it organized? Tell us a little bit about the areas that you guys cover.
00:08:40.596 - 00:09:14.694, Speaker B: Absolutely. So many people just say the personnel, first of all. So the founding team, there are four of us on the founding team. Myself, Joe Bono, who I mentioned earlier, who's kind of a real og in the space. He sort of co wrote the early bitcoin textbook. Larry Nicolenko, who was a PhD student of Dan Bonet's, who worked on the DM blockchain for several years there, Scott Commoners, who's an economist, he's actually a professor at Harvard Business School, works in market and mechanism design. And then since then, we've hired a fifth senior hire, which is Justin Thaler, who was a professor at Georgetown.
00:09:14.694 - 00:09:50.730, Speaker B: He's sort of one of the world experts in sort of ZK and snarks. So he's with us full time. And then we have two junior researchers on the mechanism design side who worked with me previously at Columbia, Pranav Garimiti and Miriam Barani. And so the group is oversimplifying. It's kind of loosely split half half between people on the cryptography security side and people on the sort of incentives and mechanism design. Know, some of us have some coverage, also distributed computing, and know between myself and Lara. And then there's a person, one of the people who works with us once a week is a political scientist named Andy hall, who's a professor at Stanford.
00:09:50.730 - 00:09:57.494, Speaker B: So he sort of adds expertise on the governance side, and that's sort of the current layout.
00:09:57.622 - 00:10:15.834, Speaker A: Excellent. And tell us a little bit about how has your academic background made you different in this space, or how has it influenced how you approach the business of crypto, the business of venture capital investing, and how do those two things interact?
00:10:15.962 - 00:10:28.882, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it's actually been very healthy having that sort of academic background, and in particular, really kind of the focus on, I would say, first of all, on principles rather than on specific projects.
00:10:28.946 - 00:10:54.426, Speaker A: I knew that word would come up. It's impossible for a Cornell graduate to not use the word principles. Is one thing that Cornell does incredibly well is turn out people who are principal. So actually, does the audience even know what that you know, what does it mean to be principal? I had to actually talk to someone about being principal this morning. I had a mentee, and it's hard to define.
00:10:54.538 - 00:11:20.182, Speaker B: It is a little bit, and it can mean a couple of different things. I mean, the sense that I mean it right now is that ideally, you can understand a project as the application of certain kinds of principles. For example, this is a rich design space, like l one protocol, something like this. Right. And a principle approach to understanding it would be you break down the different components of what the protocol has to do to the extent that you can.
00:11:20.236 - 00:11:20.406, Speaker A: Right.
00:11:20.428 - 00:11:53.806, Speaker B: So you kind of have the consensus aspect, you have the execution aspect. You maybe have the sort of fee aspect. You have the civil resistance aspect, and sort of, you understand that there are different design choices for each of these components. You understand trade offs between the different design decisions you could make and then how they sort of interact when you put them together. And if you understand the nature of the building blocks and the possibilities for assembling them, all of a sudden, you can very quickly assess the trade offs that different projects are making. For example, for different l one designs, as opposed to going to a white paper and kind of just sort of saying, oh, they did this, then they did this. Then they did this, then they did that.
00:11:53.828 - 00:11:54.206, Speaker A: Absolutely.
00:11:54.308 - 00:12:00.370, Speaker B: Then you're really just understanding the details of the project as opposed to sort of the trade offs, the fundamental trade offs that they've made.
00:12:00.440 - 00:12:38.366, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I try to always explain it in terms of exactly like you did, the two different approaches that are possible to me, principled means you're based on solid, scientific reasons for how you built something. And not being principled means you built something. And in this space, there are a lot of, as you know, there are a lot of people who just come in and they're like, hey, we've got a white paper. We got yet another blockchain. And it's kind of like, I always give the example of building people who are trying to come up with a way to shield you from the rain. Right. You could always take a hat, put a feather on it.
00:12:38.366 - 00:13:12.726, Speaker A: It's a novel hat, right? Okay. It protects you from the rain a little bit, and it's like every other hat. But is it new? Is it novel? Did the world need that thing with that feather on it? It's definitely unique, I will grant you that much. But it's not necessarily the best way to shield yourself from the rain. And it's important to be in command of the science so that when someone comes in and opens up an umbrella, then you suddenly go, oh, that's different. That's a different way to protect yourself entirely. And it's different not by adding a feather, but it's a different technology altogether.
00:13:12.726 - 00:13:33.198, Speaker A: And it's knowing when you need to build the umbrella or the awning or the building or whatever, that you be scientific about it. So in a universe that's in a crypto universe filled with a lot of unprincipled work, how has being principled affected your approach? How does it drive you day to day? What do you do day to day?
00:13:33.284 - 00:13:56.178, Speaker B: Day to day, yeah. So the work at a 16 z, it's a mix of, I would say three things. So, first of all, really, there is, and all credit to a 16 z for this. And I emphasize fundamental research. And members of my team, they are expected to publish. Expect to publish in top venues. They're expected to give seminars and conference talks, serve on program committees.
00:13:56.178 - 00:14:28.914, Speaker B: Obviously, we're hiring people where when the fundamental research they want to do is very much relevant to a 16 Z crypto. But that's really a big part of the job now. Another really big part of the job is just helping our portfolio companies. It's interesting. One thing that surprised me before I took this job, I think surprised a lot of other people when I tell them about it, is due diligence. There is some aspect of due diligence for the researchers, but not as much as most people would think. And I think, honestly, honestly, it's just, I think a credit to sort of the deal side.
00:14:28.914 - 00:15:03.150, Speaker B: You just have very, very technical and experienced people on the investment side. So they will bring researchers in for sufficiently exotic projects. If it's option pricing or advanced cryptography, usually they'll tap the research team, but like 95% of the projects they see, they're already technical enough to assess sort of themselves, which means for us, means our time is much more focused on projects they've already invested in, which I love, because then it's like the most. Everybody's objectives are kind of exactly the same. Right. The objective is to help these projects succeed. And one thing that's sort of special about the crypto space is, one, it's just really hard.
00:15:03.150 - 00:15:17.370, Speaker B: I don't have to tell you that. Two, it's just not that well understood. And so a lot of startups are stuck on genuinely, like computer science or economic research problems. That's literally the blocker, for sure.
00:15:17.460 - 00:15:32.850, Speaker A: How big do you think the gap is between the game that people talk and then the game that people end up being able to walk? That is, what's the gap between what people sell to the masses as being necessary, coming down the pipe, et cetera, versus what they actually deliver?
00:15:32.930 - 00:15:53.006, Speaker B: Well, this is a lot. Goes back to your answer to the principal's question. Right. And there's no question what you said, recognize something as a mild variation of something that exists versus something new. Obviously, on the investment side, they have to be making that call all the time. So there's good projects, there's bad projects, and I think that's fine. But the point is, you see this.
00:15:53.006 - 00:16:16.062, Speaker B: I see this regularly. You come across really smart people doing sort of really good work sometimes. Honestly, what's interesting is sometimes people just have done good work instinctively, and they can't always articulate those principles by which they led to it. And then you kind of reverse engineer it. That's kind of a lot of what we do as researchers, sometimes even. Right. So maybe Nakamoto could have written down proofs for all of those properties, but they didn't.
00:16:16.062 - 00:16:23.622, Speaker B: Meanwhile. So computer science researchers said, like, oh, well, here's a way you could have actually invented bitcoin had you started from those principles, which I think is actually very important work.
00:16:23.676 - 00:16:56.130, Speaker A: Right. But it's also important. Let me just actually chime in to not be a gatekeeper, which I know you're not, and I know I take great measures to never, ever try to gate research. That is, you don't need a PhD to make contributions to what we know to humankind. You don't need to have published in peer reviewed venues to be able to come up with something that would pass peer review. Right? So that's true. And yet, on the flip side, of course, there are a lot of people who are larping at research.
00:16:56.130 - 00:17:15.750, Speaker A: There's a lot of people that are writing things that look very well formatted for a peer reviewed paper, but lack the most important piece that should be in any scientific publication, which is a scientific basis, a proof for why it would work, or something that goes beyond my gut told me that this would work and therefore I designed it this way.
00:17:15.900 - 00:17:31.402, Speaker B: But that's a great point. I mean, one thing that has been really fun about this space is how many sort of nontraditional pedigree people are making really meaningful contributions. And I felt like, interestingly, I did these moocs, these algorithms courses that have been running online for like twelve years or something.
00:17:31.456 - 00:17:32.822, Speaker A: Massive online courses.
00:17:32.886 - 00:17:33.834, Speaker B: That's right.
00:17:34.032 - 00:17:35.514, Speaker A: How many people just signed up for?
00:17:35.552 - 00:17:41.390, Speaker B: Over a million have done it over the course of the last twelve years. Especially in the early days, I was very involved, so I interacted over a million.
00:17:41.460 - 00:17:42.490, Speaker A: That you taught?
00:17:42.650 - 00:17:43.166, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:43.268 - 00:17:44.250, Speaker A: That's insane.
00:17:44.330 - 00:18:18.442, Speaker B: Yeah, no, it was one of the early ones. It got a big audience. And so in the early days, I interacted a ton with the students over the forums. And they were just people from all over the world, all different walks of, you know, I'd just be like talking to some programmer in Kiev or something and learning about what they are interested in. And so, I don't know. So just being able to teach so much outside of the ivy plus classroom, I interacted with so many brilliant people. And even though maybe they're not going to write down some formal proof of something perfectly, but they know the stuff.
00:18:18.442 - 00:18:28.986, Speaker B: They know the stuff, right. And so it's something, I didn't know this before, but that gave me a really visceral appreciation for just how many brilliant people there are outside of the kind of traditional sort of academic setting.
00:18:29.018 - 00:18:49.010, Speaker A: Yeah. Starting with Satoshi for sure. And there have been many, I've been very lucky to encounter quite a few. Building in the space in general. Building on top of avalanche, for sure. Okay, so shall we dive into a couple of the topics that I know are near and dear to your heart? So let's start maybe something. Maybe let's start with fees.
00:18:49.010 - 00:19:33.854, Speaker A: I know you've thought a lot about fee markets. I think the audience knows the term a fee market fairly well. The bitcoin folks have paid a lot of attention to creating a robust fee market. I think it's no secret that the future of bitcoin relies very much on the creation of a robust fee market. The developers behind bitcoin have said this repeatedly, that as the halvings continue and fewer and fewer bitcoin are produced, bitcoin will have to rely on the fees to make up for its security budget. And at the same time, I'm sure the audience knows very well how important fees are. When you want to get the transaction in, you want to be able to have predictable fees.
00:19:33.854 - 00:19:57.494, Speaker A: You want to be able to attach a fee to your transaction and have some assurance that it's going to go in in about the time frame that you have in mind. Right. I tried to outline some of the things that are on top of my mind when it comes to fees. But tell us a little bit about your involvement in analyzing fee markets for blockchains. How did you approach it? What do you think are the fundamental trade offs?
00:19:57.542 - 00:20:18.706, Speaker B: Yeah, no, I could talk about this till the chaos come on. Sure. One thing that I think is super interesting about fees is it's really kind of a superposition that I've really never seen before of microeconomics and macroeconomics. And those are two things that usually don't, frankly, mix all that much. In fact, if you know any academic microeconomists, they probably will never.
00:20:18.808 - 00:20:26.734, Speaker A: They never talk to the two different courses when they go to have lunch. They probably sit at the opposite ends of the table.
00:20:26.782 - 00:20:48.326, Speaker B: Probably different methods. But for people who care about this technology, for people who are trying to build kind of the best blockchain protocols, you actually have to sort of master aspects of both of those fields. And they interact. They interact in a way that I have actually never seen before. It's really interesting. For example, you mentioned kind of the bitcoin having. So bitcoin obviously has had block rewards since the beginning.
00:20:48.326 - 00:21:47.194, Speaker B: And the motivation for the block rewards, you can think of it as a sort of micro or game theoretic motivation. You want to incentivize people to sort of contribute hash rates around the protocol and secure the protocol. But there are macroeconomic consequences of that decision. You have inflation if you have block rewards. And so Nakamoto basically made a macroeconomic policy decision for all time, for all time, of a fixed supply, which then has these microeconomic consequences, which is that in the absence of rising transaction fees, the game theory, the incentives for contributing security are going down. Another sort of very stark example of that would be EIP 1559, which is the current transaction fee mechanism used in Ethereum, where they made the, at the time, somewhat sort of controversial choice to burn a share of the transaction fee, something I know that avalanche has actually done earlier for a long time. Pre EIP 1559, Ethereum.
00:21:47.194 - 00:22:31.802, Speaker B: All of the transaction fees were passed on to the creator of the block producer of the block. Post EIP 59, there's a so called base fee, the revenue from which is burned, and the motivations, at least as I understand it, the original motivations for that decision were, again, microeconomic. You wanted to basically be resistant to certain forms of collusion, which then precluded passing those base fee revenues onto the block producer. Then you would have these kinds of incentives to kind of have these sort of side channel sort of payments to evade what the base fee was trying to do. But here again, the mechanism design decision driven by microeconomic considerations has a macroeconomic consequence, namely deflationary pressures. And so this is something that a lot of, for example, ETH holders were very excited about at the time. They're like, Eth becomes deflationary.
00:22:31.802 - 00:23:08.338, Speaker B: Fantastic. Although it's funny, if you talk to a sort of a non crypto macroeconomist, who am I kidding? Every macroeconomist is not crypto. If you talk to a macroeconomist and you say ETH is deflationary, they're going to say, like, oh, that's a crap project that'll never work. Just do some homework on Japan in the 1990s. And are they right? Are they wrong? Honestly, we don't have great science to assess that kind of skeptical reaction. I mean, my sense is that comparing a blockchain network to a sovereign country is not like that great a comparison. I'm not convinced.
00:23:08.338 - 00:23:16.182, Speaker B: That's a very strong comparison. But I would love to see you talk about scientific reason. I would like to see the scientific reasons backing up that intuition.
00:23:16.246 - 00:24:15.550, Speaker A: I would love to see the same, exact same thing. So when we were doing avalanche, when we were designing the initial network, we had an economist on the team, and she was quite adamant, incredibly adamant, that the deflationary design was going to be the end of any economy. So when they say economy, of course they mean a sovereign country economy, where there's debt, the debt is denominated mostly in the currency itself to people inside the country, and you have other goals, like employment and so on. So that framework does not necessarily, in my opinion, apply to cryptocurrencies. And we ended up through a lot of gritty discussion, and she could hold her own, and I hope she's watching today. She's one of the people I respect the most in this space who straddles the space of crypto and econ. But ultimately we ended up with the design that we had with a supply cap on avalanche.
00:24:15.550 - 00:25:00.434, Speaker A: And so that went counter to orthodox economic teaching. And mainly because we thought that the parallel to sovereign economies isn't there and it's more like other commodities with a finite supply. But time will tell, and I fully agree with you. I would give my left arm to whoever is going to bridge that gap, bring econ together and hopefully bridge macro, micro and crypto. That's a rare combination. But tell us a little bit more about the fee structure. So not only does one have to worry about the ultimate sort of macro conditions, which is what you talked about, there are also micro considerations.
00:25:00.434 - 00:25:37.170, Speaker A: Right. I send my transaction, what's the fee? I attach. I need to know that. And when you started your research, I think contemporaries, I was doing some work on transaction fees as well. When we started ours, the only mechanism known was an auction. I think we all converged on similar ideas. Do you want to tell the audience about what's wrong with doing fees? The way, the simple way, which is you attach a fee, you submit your transaction, it goes up into a public mem pool.
00:25:37.170 - 00:25:59.150, Speaker A: Other people can see what you're doing, and then they attach their fees to their transactions. And you may or may not get priced into the block. Your transaction might not make it to the block. If there is a congestion period, you might not make it to the block for a very long time. So that's sort of the big problem that was facing everybody. Do you want to describe what the sort of the.
00:25:59.220 - 00:26:28.034, Speaker B: Sure, absolutely. And let me actually separate a couple. The spirit of this teasing apart the principles. For example, the auction is not the main reason that bitcoin has sort of a fee market problem, for example. So there's two distinct issues. So one is just a supply demand sort of consideration. So basically, the fees you roughly expect to see sort of, for transactions in a blockchain is kind of the marginal value of the last person who gets to enter that blockchain protocol.
00:26:28.034 - 00:27:27.014, Speaker B: So basically you expect kind of at equilibrium, on average, the price to be just high enough so that the people willing to pay it actually fill up and use all of the block space. So bitcoin's fundamental problem as far as kind of the fee market, you go back to that Tanakamoto's white paper, they already speculate that transaction fees sort of should rise. What we've sort of seen, in my opinion, is that bitcoin has really done extremely well as a store of value, right? Less so as kind of a medium of exchange. So it has a ton of value, but not a lot of necessarily transactions accordingly. And so because the demand for bitcoin block space is not zero, right, but it's not super high. And therefore the transaction fees are not super high, not enough certainly, to make up for the lowering block rewards. So one thing is just kind of forget about the mechanism, forget about the way by which users might figure out what they should be paying if you just sort of fast forward to like a competitive equilibrium that's going to be higher or lower depending on how demand compares to supply.
00:27:27.014 - 00:28:29.018, Speaker B: So that's the first thing. Now, as far as the auction that you mentioned. So what's wrong with kind of the way that bitcoin still does sort of transactions? Now there's a couple of things, but the one that's the most strongly game theoretic is just about ease of fee estimation, right? So if you're a user of, for example, bitcoin, you are responsible or your wallet is responsible for attaching a bid to that transaction. And in bitcoin, if your sort of transaction is included, that bid is just going to be transferred directly from the submitter of the transaction to the miner who produces that block. And so the question is, you actually have to now formulate it. It's like, are you going to pay $10, you're going to pay $40, what are you going to do? You can try to look at sort of recent data about sort of the fees that people paid in blocks, but as you say, it can be very volatile, right? All of a sudden, maybe there's a little less relevant on bitcoin, but you can imagine if it's an l, one that supports NFT drops like avalanche, then all of a sudden the demand can spike very quickly if you suddenly have a mint.
00:28:29.114 - 00:29:08.550, Speaker A: Actually, can I say something about this? Because Maureen O'Hara did a fantastic job of looking at ratcheting fee behavior. So I'm sure the bright members of the audience are following along will suggest, hey, what about a simple thing in my wallet where I look at what's happening on chain and the wallet estimates whatever the fees are in the last period and then suggests some number like that. This seems incredibly, incredibly tempting. And this is what some bitcoin wallets used to do. In fact, the default one, I think, had this for maybe a hot month or so. And you can immediately see what the problem is going to be. The problem is then the fees will ratchet.
00:29:08.550 - 00:29:25.698, Speaker A: If they ever go up. There's no reason for them to come down. Right. So you estimate what it was, and let me just pay whatever everybody else paid recently. Okay, well, if you do that, once the fees go up, there's just no sort of reverse process, no game theoretic sort of force field.
00:29:25.864 - 00:29:26.882, Speaker B: They weren't dampening it.
00:29:26.936 - 00:29:30.594, Speaker A: There's no dampening at all. That was a bad design.
00:29:30.792 - 00:29:32.466, Speaker B: As you can see, it's easy to.
00:29:32.488 - 00:29:43.186, Speaker A: Say from the armchair, takes a millisecond for the mechanism design expert to say, that's not going to work. But it seemed good to get to the practitioners at the time. Okay, so go ahead. Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
00:29:43.218 - 00:30:21.234, Speaker B: No problem, no problem. One question would be the simplest design basically outsources the problem of figuring out what to bid to the users. And like with so many things you can argue about, should sort of the burden of some kind of computational task be put on the users? Should it be done kind of like internally by the protocol? And reasonable people can disagree on this for sure. Right. So I think it's not unreasonable to say, like, you know what? Let the users figure it out. Let the wallet designers come up with smart wallets, much smarter than that design that do an okay job. An alternative approach, which is what the approach that the FP 50 59 took was.
00:30:21.234 - 00:31:00.634, Speaker B: Let's actually do more work inside the protocol to make lives easier for users. Right. For example, this base fee that's really just kind of acts as a reserve price, and that's programmatically adjusted, sort of based on sort of the sizes of recent blocks. So if you've seen small blocks, then you interpret the current reserve price as being too high, so you lower it. If the blocks are sort of bigger than you'd like, then you raise the base fee to kind of, sort of reduce the amount of demand willing to pay the next one. And as a result, if that base fee is set roughly correctly, if it's not way off, then as a user, it's really kind of ideally as easy as like shopping on Amazon. You would just show up to a blockchain protocol.
00:31:00.634 - 00:31:32.742, Speaker B: It would just say, hey, posted price, $10 a transaction, take it or leave it, just like you would on an Amazon page, decide whether to buy the thing or not at the posted price. So too here, would you decide whether or not to submit your transaction right now, given the current price of block space? Obviously a lot of nuances, right? I mean, so what if the demand suddenly shoots up and the reserve price is sort of way too low? Then you're kind of back to sort of the original problems. But I think in many people's view, this is an improvement to do a little bit more work inside the fee mechanism to make it a little bit easier for the users.
00:31:32.806 - 00:32:32.490, Speaker A: I think from a user perspective, I think it was night and day. So people who are used to using chains from 2016 17, I think you guys are all, you know, how badly it can go, right? The fees spike, and I don't want to eat into our precious time with Tim, but I will say this, I did have a role to play in the formation of EIP 1559. Okay, you may or may not know about this. We had started work at Cornell, so I and a graduate student, Sumi Abasu, we had started working on building a fee market where people attach their true value to their transactions. And our goal was, let's just get the gaming out of it right? So what I want, really ideally, is a scenario where I want to get a transaction in. The transaction is worth $1,000 to me, or maybe $10,000, or whatever it is, there is a fee, or maybe it's worth $10, whatever it might be. I'm not with the set up then.
00:32:32.490 - 00:33:02.774, Speaker A: I was never going to put that number as my fee, because I'll be charged that amount. I'm willing to pay up to $1,000. I'm trying to pay back a loan for a lending service, let's say, and it's very important that I get it in before I get liquidated. So it's very high value to me, but I won't necessarily attach that high fee. So the mechanisms back then forced me to game it. It's like, well, at the moment, everybody is putting in 50, so maybe I put in 60, et cetera. Maybe 70 will be enough to get away with it.
00:33:02.774 - 00:33:49.922, Speaker A: But then other people see your public transaction, and you can still get priced out and get liquidated and lose huge sums of money. So we came up with what we call a k price auction. And in a case, price auction, you say, I'm willing to pay up to this amount, but then the price you pay is actually guarded by the lowest fee in the block. And there are a bunch of mechanisms to make sure that miners don't mess with. So anyhow, it's a truthful mechanism, as I know undoubtedly, you know very well from theoretical work in the space. And the funny thing was, Vitalik was visiting Cornell, and it was like, hey, Vitalik, you know, we've been working on this thing. The bitcoin crowd has been making a lot of noise about the fee market, but their fee market will always be unstable.
00:33:49.922 - 00:34:35.262, Speaker A: There won't be predictability to it because people are constantly playing games. They're trying to see how little they can get away with, whereas this is just a truthful declaration of how much you're willing to pay up to. And Vital said, oh, yeah, there's been some thought in that area within the ethereum community as well. Let me trigger those people to write up their thoughts. And EIP 1559 was a response to me and Sumia bugging Vitalik and saying, look, this is what you guys should do. And he said, well, we've been thinking about a slightly different mechanism. And it turns out, after much analysis that you did, that I enjoyed very much reading that the mechanism in EIP 1559 is in some sense equivalent to a Kate price auction.
00:34:35.262 - 00:34:37.350, Speaker A: Right? Do I remember this correctly?
00:34:38.250 - 00:34:49.294, Speaker B: Let's see. So in sort of the common case, I would say yes. So the common case where the reserve price is set correctly so that it's roughly scaling with demand.
00:34:49.362 - 00:35:01.910, Speaker A: Yeah, I think there are some really interesting cases that we have to revisit when you have a very fast block time, when you have big blocks, and of course, spiky behavior in terms of congestion.
00:35:01.990 - 00:35:35.750, Speaker B: One thing that was nice about your design is it fit particularly well with this idea that blocks have lots of transactions in them. So that's something we've sort of known, sort of a principle of traditional auction theory that if you have large auctions, things get nicer. But a lot of auctions in sort of practice, if you think about traditional auctions, they're not large. You're selling a painting or you're selling a small number of spectrum licenses, whereas with the blockchain setting, you naturally have these, like you say, big blocks, lots of transactions. And that just makes, actually, there's so many things going against you as a mechanism designer and blockchain protocols, that's one thing that's actually going for you.
00:35:35.900 - 00:36:28.438, Speaker A: All right, well, I want to change gears a little bit and talk about another topic that I think is quite exciting, which is the design of automated market makers. So we've seen with Uniswap, Trader Joe and the slew of protocols that came behind after them, that automated market makers are here to stay. People love using them. So I think the immediacy they provide is something that is clearly very valuable to people. And at the same time, they have all these issues such as slippage, such as front running, et cetera, et cetera, mev extraction, et cetera. So you've given this matter a lot of thought at the very highest level, what do you think are the currently outstanding problems with existing amms?
00:36:28.534 - 00:36:47.930, Speaker B: Yeah. Good. Maybe let me start by popping up sort of one level a little bit. So certainly what I think is obviously here to stay is decentralized exchanges. So the idea of doing trade while preserving self custody, I mean, this to me is just, this is amazing. This is fantastic. This is just fundamental.
00:36:47.930 - 00:37:32.742, Speaker B: If you don't believe in that, you don't believe in this technology either way. Now within decentralized exchanges you can have different designs, right? So for example, you can try to copy what like Wall street does. You can have a kind of limit order book in principle. You try to copy that. Amms are a different design. And so one high level question is, are amms here for the long term? I kind of believe yes, but that's something I think reasonable people could disagree on, right? The sort of pushback would be like, oh, well, as sort of blockchains get so powerful and the sort of transaction throughput becomes so large, all of a sudden you can just implement order books. And why would you ever do anything else? But I think there are reasons you would want to do other things, especially for long tail assets, especially if you have thin markets where you don't have necessarily lots of traders.
00:37:32.742 - 00:37:59.234, Speaker B: I think then amms I think will endure as a useful tool. So that's the first thing I wanted to say. So I agree with you, but I think there is kind of an interesting debate to have there. Okay, so automated market makers, so how do they handle the problem of thin markets? Well, they're basically just always open for business, right? They're quoting a spot price. They're always going to take a buy or a sell at that current spot price. But then your question is, wait a minute, who's the counterparty? Exactly, right. Like in an order book.
00:37:59.234 - 00:38:41.982, Speaker B: Like if you're buying, you're buying from someone. If you're selling, you're selling to someone. So the point is, it's just like amms, right? They have this sort of deposit of tokens, right? And so they're just being automatically traded through trades. Where do those tokens come from? Well, they're provided by liquidity providers or lps. So why would you ever bother to be an LP? Why would you bother to put your hard earned tokens into one of these amms? Just so the traders can sort of trade them back and forth? Well, the obvious reason is you're going to get a share of the revenue, of the trading revenue. And so then you see that and you're like, okay, wait a minute. But then why would I not deposit all my hard earned tokens into an amm? But there is actually kind of a subtle cost to providing liquidity, which is something known as adverse selection.
00:38:41.982 - 00:38:52.040, Speaker B: And so this is not just about amms, this is just about market making in general. So if you quote a price and then someone actually takes you up on it, all of a sudden you're like.
00:38:53.130 - 00:38:55.142, Speaker A: What did they know that I don't know.
00:38:55.196 - 00:39:23.514, Speaker B: That I don't know. Right. And in traditional markets, you tended to be worried more about private information, like insider trading or something like that. You might expect to sort of lose money as a market maker. But what's funny is in amms, you actually even know there's adverse selection due to public information. So, for example, if the price discovery of an asset is actually happening on, like, a coinbase or some centralized exchange, well, then the spot price of the aMM will. Until there's an arb trade, the spot price of the AMM will be stale.
00:39:23.514 - 00:39:57.690, Speaker B: It'll reflect some previous world. And so then the sort of good news is that if the spot price goes out of alignment, there is an incentive then for an arbitrature to correct it through a trade. But that arbitrage profit comes at the expense of the liquidity providers. So anytime there's an ARB trade on a pool you're supplying liquidity to, you are losing money, in effect, as an LP. So if you want an LP, or if you're thinking about it, really, the cost benefit analysis you need to assess is, let's look at how much sort of revenue we're making from our share of the fees. That's very easy to measure. Compare that against your adverse selection costs.
00:39:57.690 - 00:40:01.562, Speaker B: Okay, but how do you measure those?
00:40:01.696 - 00:40:02.186, Speaker A: Right.
00:40:02.288 - 00:40:23.554, Speaker B: So that's sort of one of the research topics I and several co authors have been looking at a lot over the last maybe twelve to 18 months or so. And so in particular, we proposed something that we call lever. That's an acronym, LVR, which stands for loss versus rebalancing, which, in our opinion, is the correct measure for these adverse selection costs. There was this sort of term called impermanent loss, divergence loss that you'd hear about.
00:40:23.592 - 00:40:27.700, Speaker A: It's a terrible term, terrible term. And, like, so permanent. This is true.
00:40:29.670 - 00:41:15.266, Speaker B: Even the person who coined it sort of regrets coining it that way. Yeah. And I will say, I think a lot of the experts knew it was an imperfect measure, and the question is just, what's the right measure? And so in our opinion lever is the right measure. And basically what you do is you compare your profits and loss in the AMM. Compare that to what it would have been had you made the exact same trades on a centralized exchange at the correct market prices, as opposed to at the stale prices in the AMM, which is when the arb trade happened. So that is the definition of lever. So how much better off would you have been doing all of those same trades except at the actual market price, instead of a stale version of the market price? And so one thing that's nice about that, it's very easy to take to data.
00:41:15.266 - 00:42:01.822, Speaker B: You can sort of just look at sort of trades in the amm you're lping for. You can look at just sort of what price data from, say, binance during that time. You can just literally just compute the empirical lever and see how you've done. And then the concept also just plays really nicely with traditional continuous time finance models. So if you want to make predictions about future lever, well then you need to have some kind of model for the evolution of the asset prices. But you can just use a standard geometric browning motion, like a black scholes type formula. And for a given sort of amm, whether it's x, y equals k or something else, you can literally just compute, often in closed form, exactly what the expected lever is going to be, which then you can feed back into your decision process like, okay, what do I expect Macbes to be? Is that going to be more than what I expect the lever to be? And that informs the decision about whether to do liquidity provision.
00:42:01.822 - 00:42:08.322, Speaker B: And then obviously, if you're designing the next generation automated market makers, this gives you something that you want to focus on.
00:42:08.376 - 00:42:19.906, Speaker A: So I want to focus on that, actually, not that I'm designing the next generation of amms. I think other people should be doing it on top of avalanche. But how would you design a new amm if you were to start from scratch?
00:42:20.018 - 00:42:47.006, Speaker B: I'd say there's mean. I'm very excited in that there are many, many projects exploring different approaches. And to some extent, I think we're just going to see survival of the fittest happen among couple things, because I love that. So in some sense, I feel like I don't have to make a prediction. I can just sort of watch the experiment happen. But just to talk a little bit about what I'm seeing with all the projects that are telling me about that are working on this, I'd say there's sort of two high level approaches you can take. You can incorporate an oracle.
00:42:47.006 - 00:42:59.414, Speaker B: A price oracle or not. If you had a perfect price oracle, the problem kind of goes away because you would just kind of ignore the reserves of your amm and you would just accept, buy or sell at whatever.
00:42:59.452 - 00:43:02.054, Speaker A: You know, the market takes away the arbitrage opportunity.
00:43:02.172 - 00:43:30.094, Speaker B: That's right. You've basically kind of taken it away. Exactly. So the obvious, so what's unclear about making this really practical is price oracles are not perfect. Even in the best of scenarios, they can be manipulated. So you need to worry about that kind of risk. So how do you blend not totally trusted, not totally perfect price oracle into kind of the way amms work today? So I'm not saying that can't be done, but it's not obvious that that can be done in a way that's going to work.
00:43:30.212 - 00:43:45.966, Speaker A: Also not sure. It's not clear to me that it's desirable from the designer's perspective because they want volume, they want to be ranked high. These amms are always ranked by how much volume they do. And an inefficient, badly designed amm will have high volumes thanks to Arbtrade.
00:43:45.998 - 00:43:51.974, Speaker B: Well, if the LPS stick around. Right, lps get smart because there's competition between the amms. Right.
00:43:52.012 - 00:43:53.318, Speaker A: Game theory is actually really cool.
00:43:53.404 - 00:44:04.554, Speaker B: Yeah, it is. And that's something that's totally open, actually understanding sort of competition between amms for liquidity. I haven't seen a single sort of thorough paper about that.
00:44:04.672 - 00:44:08.540, Speaker A: Trader Joe guys versus the uniswap guys, for example, we'll have to hear about.
00:44:11.070 - 00:44:36.514, Speaker B: That's, that's one approach which I think could work. I think it's also not obvious it's going to work well. Use oracle. The other way would be to almost kind of, in some sense outsource sort of the estimation of what the lever is going to be. So there's a couple of ways of doing this. But for example, you could imagine designing an amm where there's one special person who gets to trade without fees. Now, how is that person chosen?
00:44:36.562 - 00:44:46.742, Speaker A: Sam and Caroline. Oh, God. You have reinvented the frame with me, though.
00:44:46.796 - 00:44:50.410, Speaker B: That was not my intent. No, you scared me out of the frame with that comment.
00:44:52.350 - 00:44:55.386, Speaker A: So this molecule amm, we've already named it.
00:44:55.488 - 00:45:26.690, Speaker B: All right, special person. So it could either be a whitelist or you could imagine doing an auction for it. So you auction off the rights to be the no fee person for the next fantastic idea. And now what's cool is, if you think about it, the only person who's really going to be doing the arbitrage trades is going to be that person with no fees, right. Because they will pick them off immediately. I mean, there's gas fees you have to worry about, but let's put those aside. They'll be able to pick off the arbitrage opportunities before they become profitable for anyone else who does just have to pay fees.
00:45:26.690 - 00:45:41.370, Speaker B: But on the other hand, if that auction is competitive, you would actually expect the clearing price of that auction to be roughly commensurate with what those our profits are going to be. They're all going to go back into the amm that they can distribute how they see fit, for example, distribute back to the lps. So that's another sort of approach that I'm seeing.
00:45:41.440 - 00:45:44.380, Speaker A: That's very cool. Has it been explored yet?
00:45:44.990 - 00:45:50.458, Speaker B: I don't know that there's one that's deployed, but there are definitely teams that tell me they're building such things.
00:45:50.544 - 00:46:27.090, Speaker A: I see. Well, we have one such team visiting avalabs even as we speak. So cavalry is doing some really interesting cutting edge amm design and I'll introduce you. You should connect me there after our chat's over. So that's really fascinating though. And I think the audience can see that there is so much more room for mechanism design. There's a lot more to it than you just go trade with it from the liquidity provision point of view, the oracle point of view, or these privileged players whose actions actually kick back into the LP pool.
00:46:27.090 - 00:46:50.874, Speaker A: So really fascinating work. So that's really fun stuff. Let's talk a little bit about the third and final topic. I think it's always the rule of threes. I know you worked on snarks. Let's maybe describe to the Audience what snarks can do. They've been held up as the savior of a lot of protocols.
00:46:50.874 - 00:47:30.394, Speaker A: There are many, many people waiting for the next generation of snarks. We couldn't do x until now, but with this new thing coming through with snarks, we're going to be able to do XYZ. So they're one of the many godot's that a lot of communities are waiting for. And I don't know if they will solve scaling for this l one or that l one. But I do know that there is something fundamentally very cool about snarks. The technology is really exciting and we'll see exactly how it's employed. But do you want to tell us a little bit about what snarks do? And then my next question is going to be what's their application to blockchains? Well, let's start with the simple one.
00:47:30.432 - 00:48:11.494, Speaker B: Sure. Great. And just to be clear, this is in my own research area. Justin Thaler, I mentioned, is one of our senior researcher on my team, and so he's kind of one of the world experts on this. So a lot of what I know, I just know because Justin sort of taught it to me, basically. Yeah. I mean, I'd say the high level is, how do you convince someone a computation was done correctly without forcing them to redo it from? So, in particular, how can you do this with completely general computations? Because, especially if we have an eye toward programmable blockchains, we don't want to make any assumptions about the nature of the computation being done.
00:48:11.494 - 00:48:45.940, Speaker B: Literally, no matter what the computation is, you should be able to convince someone quickly that was done correctly. So that is the point of a snark. And I got to say, there is no reason operatori to think this should be possible for general computation. Actually, this kind of still blows my mind when I think about really, it's like an arbitrary circuit, like anything, like any circuit. And somehow you can compress it down, right? So somehow you give people the answer. You sort of give people, you show some of your work in some sense to help them verify it, but they can verify it much more quickly than just doing computation from scratch. Crazy.
00:48:45.940 - 00:49:28.094, Speaker B: What's even crazier is one of the first proof of concepts that snarks exist. Follow from what's maybe the deepest theorem in all of theoretical computer science. Something known as the PCP theorem, or PCP, is probabilistically checkable proofs. And so those were originally invented primarily for applications and hardness of approximation. But basically what it shows is that sort of any computation can be reformulated so that any error in the computation becomes highly replicated. Let me get a little bit technical here, but basically, any satisfiability formula, any truth assignment. Normally, if a truth assignment fails to satisfy a satisfiability formula, you say, oh, here's a clause which it doesn't satisfy.
00:49:28.094 - 00:49:53.974, Speaker B: Maybe all of the other clauses are correct, but this one clause is going to be wrong. But it turns out you can kind of repropare the satisfiability formula, make it like a little bit longer, add some redundancy, so that if it's unsatisfiable, no matter how you try to satisfy the assignment, the variable assignments, I can just pick a random clause. It's going to be wrong. It's going to be wrong. It's going to be wrong everywhere. And that's actually kind of, I think, for me, has some of the intuition about why snarks are possible. Right.
00:49:53.974 - 00:50:18.290, Speaker B: Because how would you convince someone that a computation was done correctly? Well, prepare the computation in a way that if it's wrong, it's wrong everywhere. And then the person can just do random challenges. Just say, well, just point to me what you did at this step. Point to me what you did at this step. Right. And if it's wrong everywhere, they're going to catch you very quickly, much more quickly than it would by actually sort of reviewing your entire solution. So for me, that's my intuition about why snarks are in fact possible.
00:50:18.290 - 00:50:44.426, Speaker B: It reduces to this other thing, which seems also very magical, the PCP theorem. Anyways, tying this back to blockchains. Like, why would you want to do this? How do we scale blockchains? Obvious thing. Let's do some of the computation off chain. Let's have some computation which doesn't have to be done over and over and over again by all of the validators. It's done by one or a small number of parties, and the validators can just sort of check that it was done correctly. And so now you say, like, oh, my God, snark is exactly what we need for this to make any sense at all.
00:50:44.426 - 00:50:53.642, Speaker B: There needs to be a way to take this off chain computation and sort of give something to the validators so that they can check it much more quickly than redoing it from scratch.
00:50:53.786 - 00:51:02.622, Speaker A: Right. I think the example that I've heard about that I often use when it comes to snarks is the where's Waldo? Example. You've heard this?
00:51:02.676 - 00:51:03.054, Speaker B: I have.
00:51:03.092 - 00:51:22.022, Speaker A: So this is the case of I know where Waldo is, and I can prove to you that I know where Waldo is. And it's very simple. Here's my big picture. I know where he is. I cut a little overlay sheet. I cut a hole in the shape of Waldo. I ask you to close your eyes.
00:51:22.022 - 00:51:41.142, Speaker A: I put it right on top of him, and I say, look through the overlay. You can see that that's Waldo over there. And this is sort of the super dumbed down version. I think your version like a little bit better because it's a bit more closer to what really goes on with the circuits and the satisfyable clauses in them and then the probabilistic checking.
00:51:41.206 - 00:52:15.346, Speaker B: So let's also separate two different things, because one aspect is the privacy aspect, another is the aspect. So whereas Waldo is really kind of like the ZK, the zero knowledge part, how do I convince you that I know something without actually kind of just telling you what it is, which again, how is that possible? It's sort of magic. It's amazing. Right? So obviously privacy is one super interesting topic for blockchain protocols. But even setting privacy aside. Right, so snark per se, it's just this computation compression. So even if you don't care about privacy, snarks are still super important for blockchain protocols.
00:52:15.458 - 00:52:55.730, Speaker A: Right. Let's keep in mind, of course, that even when we use snarks, snarks are great for succinctly summarizing the result of a computation. So we took a bunch of funds off chain, we did a whole bunch of transactions, we're going to move them back onto the chain. And I want to prove to everybody that I computed everything correctly. If I want that computation that was off chain to be performed in a decentralized fashion. I still need a fast blockchain, I still need a sovereign chain. If I want a bunch of witnesses, if I want a bunch of participation, if I want an open system, I still come back to all having to solve all those problems on my l one that I tried to punt into l two.
00:52:55.730 - 00:53:34.850, Speaker A: So there's always a centralization trade off in any of these off chain solutions. But the snarks, there are so many different ways of using them. The common way that they come up is this succinct result from an off chain computation. But there are many, many other use cases for this, and I can't wait to see them applied to blockchains. I want to come back to sort of the zeitgeist, if you will, in tech circles. I know you're obviously very well connected to what's happening in Silicon Valley. Let's get into, I think, what we just lived through the summer of AI.
00:53:34.850 - 00:53:53.922, Speaker A: From your vantage point, what do you think is happening with AI? What do you think? Especially I hear a lot about AI and blockchains coming together. I personally have not seen all that many great use cases at the intersection. I would love to hear from you what you have seen as both an academic and also a person in the vc circles.
00:53:53.986 - 00:54:19.866, Speaker B: Yeah, no, happy to. Maybe one quick sort of digressions. And I wonder if you had a very similar experience. But one question I get a lot. I'm sure you get it even more, is from people kind of impatient that we don't have a billion users. Kind of three, yes. Like where are the applications? Oh, ergo, this technology must be useless if you don't have a billion users 14 years after sort of the Nakamoto paper, right? And meanwhile, there's all this justifiably.
00:54:19.866 - 00:55:02.670, Speaker B: So there's all this excitement around sort of generative AI. And really, I would say this dates back to really more than ten years now, when you started seeing fundamental breakthroughs in computer vision and natural language processing with sort of deep neural networks. I think it's kind of been a continuum over that period. And just for the younger people in the audience, for the first big chunk of my computer science career, neural networks were a joke. And machine learning and AI more broadly, they literally were a joke. Like my professors, right? When I was an undergrad in the 90s, mid 90s, my professors would make fun of any kind of statistical machine learning approach. They just thought it was incredibly stupid.
00:55:02.670 - 00:55:33.298, Speaker B: Obviously, they were really wrong. Okay? But the thing to remember is there was a 60 year period where neural networks didn't prove themselves, right? You can find above the fold articles in the New York Times saying the perceptron is going to give us, like, robots within two years or something, right? So the technology can take a while for it to really find its sort of full blossoming. So I want people to remember that because these comments like, oh, AI is applicable and blockchains are not applicable. This is a much longer historical.
00:55:33.394 - 00:56:07.170, Speaker A: I remember this really well. So I was an undergrad, late 80s, early ninety s, and neural networks were big back then. And in fact, I worked very closely with someone who built the world's largest neural network using CRT technology. So he etched a bunch of gates onto a giant piece of glass and triggered the neurons using a CRT electron beam. And just fascinating work. And of course, they didn't scale with the technology back then, nor did we have the data to feed into them. And when those two things came by, then you have today's explosion.
00:56:07.170 - 00:56:35.340, Speaker A: You said it so beautifully that people look at this and like, oh, look at AI. Well, they forget the 60 years that preceded it, especially the last 20 years when I remember when AI was being taught that neural networks were like, oh, this discarded technology that never will blossom. And why would it work? Why should it work? It can't even explain what it learns. Come on. This is clearly going to be a failure. And yet every one of those people are now folding back in to work on AI technology.
00:56:36.030 - 00:57:14.598, Speaker B: Honestly, just as, like, a computer scientist, I just love seeing these really brilliant ideas from the, like, valiant Batnik. All those seeds that they planted now sort of blossom into what it is today. I don't know. It's a very cool thing just from a purely intellectual perspective. As far as the application perspective, I agree. I think a lot of people right now are feeling that surely the rise of AI and the rise of crypto web3 should, there should be synergies between them. I think a lot of people are still trying to figure out exactly what that's going to look like.
00:57:14.598 - 00:57:43.890, Speaker B: One idea actually ties back into this notion of snarks, actually, right, where if you have sort of a very large model, machine learning model, such that even inference is kind of difficult, inference is not something you would do, certainly not on your phone, maybe not even on your laptop. And so you have to outsource inference like prediction to some third party and you want them to convince you that they did it correctly as opposed to just making up an answer that wasn't related to your query. That could be another sort of killer application of snarks going forward.
00:57:43.960 - 00:58:13.898, Speaker A: Brain snark. A brain snark. This is correctly computed output of a neural network. That's an amazing thing to work on. Fascinating. So can we go to the other thing, the digression that I find to be a fascinating thought, because I do face this, we're in the depths of a bear market right now, even as we speak, and I do face this objection to blockchains every now and then. Where are the next billion users? Why aren't they here yet? Why aren't we on the moon? Why haven't we colonized Mars? Kind of a.
00:58:13.898 - 00:58:22.620, Speaker A: And so what's your take on this? What's it going to take to get us to the next billion users? And why does blockchain get a bad rep? These.
00:58:24.670 - 00:59:04.122, Speaker B: Know, I think it's a few things. I mean, certainly like the hype cycle, just like the hype cycle hurt AI over the decades. I think there's some of the same aspects sort of in blockchains and crypto. I think by virtue of being fundamentally about ownership, enabling ownership of new types of assets, that necessarily leads to markets. So it necessarily leads to a financialization, not necessarily the whole thing. I'm not saying all applications are going to be financialized, but that's definitely in some sense part and parcel with applications. I think some people react as negatively have negative sort of connotations around financial applications as well.
00:59:04.122 - 00:59:41.074, Speaker B: Those are, I think are some of the things. But honestly, once you have the killer applications, I think all of that stuff sort of blends into the background. At some point you stop having arguments once everybody is kind of just using it on their phone without even knowing that they're using it. This is probably just like the academic in me, I tend to take a little bit more of the long view. I can tell you things that the application layer that I'm seeing a lot of excitement around by people on the investment side and so on. Two really obvious examples that I know are sort of well represented on avalanche as well. One would be the gaming.
00:59:41.122 - 00:59:41.890, Speaker A: Gaming.
00:59:42.050 - 01:00:18.714, Speaker B: And again, so to me, the fundamental. So just backing up a little bit, I told you I was trying to sort of muster up conviction to go all in in this area, like in 2019 or something. And so again, part of it was like, do I actually think the technology is going to be impactful? Part of it is the scientific depth there. And on the first point, do I think the technology is going to be meaningful? The way I convince myself there was just realizing that it really gave us a profound sort of power that we had not had up to that point, which is narrowing the gap between the types of property rights that we enjoy for physical possessions and those that we have historically not enjoyed for digital possessions.
01:00:18.762 - 01:00:18.974, Speaker A: Right?
01:00:19.012 - 01:00:39.586, Speaker B: I mean, property rights obviously fundamental to modern democracies like the United States. So, for example, you buy something and yours, you go to a shopping mall, you go to a store, you buy some clothes, you don't have to return the clothes when you leave the store. You don't have to return the clothes when you leave the shopping mall. The shopping mall could burn down to the ground. It doesn't matter. You still have your clothes. It's fine, they're yours, right? You build something with your bare hands, right? You go source some driftwood, you make a cool piece of furniture.
01:00:39.586 - 01:01:08.320, Speaker B: You didn't buy it, but it doesn't matter, it's yours. Right? So you have rights to it, right? What do you buy sort of in the digital realm? Well, maybe you'd buy. So again, this is where video games, I think, fit in so nicely. Maybe you buy in game assets, you buy skins, right? Are they yours? No, everybody knows they're not yours, right? Epic Games goes out of business, you lose it. Obviously, you can't port them to other games and so on. Something you build with your own bare hands, well, that could be something like, say, a social media profile. It could be your sort of Twitter follower list, right? And everybody knows they don't own the Twitter follower list.
01:01:08.320 - 01:01:25.266, Speaker B: That's just kind of obvious, I think, to all of us, right? And so that's why. So in addition to the gaming side, decentralized social, I think, is another just really obvious kind of application area. Like just imagine a version of your favorite social network. But were you, in some more meaningful sense, own sort of your part of the social network?
01:01:25.458 - 01:01:32.458, Speaker A: You don't have to imagine this. I think the audience will know this from Starzarena that I don't know if you played with it.
01:01:32.544 - 01:01:33.162, Speaker B: I have no.
01:01:33.216 - 01:02:25.834, Speaker A: So this was a social fi application that was so fun to use with all this token and census built into it, where you actually owned tickets to people that actually had function that allowed you to do things like slip into their dms and discuss with other followers of theirs, et cetera. And there was an economic game being played, and it was so well designed as a product that incentivized people to essentially give money to new. So that's a very OD setup and was very fun to use for that reason. But anyway, so, socialpi, I fully agree with you. I just got a glimpse of what Elon could do if he was a little bit more crypto savvy and a little bit more tech savvy. And I can't believe I'm saying those words. He wasn't as good as stars arena guys.
01:02:25.952 - 01:02:54.114, Speaker B: So say gaming is one thing. Do I know for sure that web3 gaming is going to be huge? No, I don't. I think it's very plausible. It will be. But even if it's not, do I know that decentralized social is going to be huge? No, I think it probably will be. But even if it's not, to me, I just come back to the idea that, look, this technology gives us something we didn't have before, something very profound. Right? So stronger notions of ownership, self custody of digital assets, we literally didn't have that, by the way.
01:02:54.114 - 01:03:24.010, Speaker B: This also just has created a more than trillion dollar asset class. Everyone sort of seems to take that for granted now. But that already, if you stop and think about that, you're like, what? I mean, it's nuts, actually. So even let's set that aside. So the idea that you would bet against human creativity to the point that having stronger ownership for things in the digital realm, no one could find a use for that, that a billion people would care about. I can't falsify that statement, but that seems like a crazy bet to take, and I'm happy to obviously bet in the opposite direction.
01:03:24.090 - 01:03:46.834, Speaker A: Amazing. All right, last question. So I think everyone saw the fire hose that Tim is, and I'm sure there are many people in the audience who would like to take a journey along the same path that you have taken. What would be your suggestion, especially to young folks who are listening, who are interested in mechanism design, game theory, theoretical computer science in general?
01:03:46.952 - 01:04:24.766, Speaker B: That's a great question. I feel like there's sort of two versions of the question also. One more focused on sort of building up the kind of chops, like the principles that we talked about. Another actually sort of getting into the trenches and actually trying to help with projects. So on the first topic, sort of just building on principles, I've definitely always spent an irrationally large amount of my time trying to get resources out there to sort of help people level up. A lot of things in this space are complicated, and a lot of things in this space are actually not that complicated. It's just hard to find them sort of explained in a transparent way.
01:04:24.766 - 01:04:26.174, Speaker B: You do a great job of this.
01:04:26.212 - 01:04:26.974, Speaker A: By the way, in your writing.
01:04:27.022 - 01:04:56.186, Speaker B: I appreciate that. Thank you. And so for game theory and mechanism design, I actually have a very accessible one. So I have a bunch of sort of YouTube playlists. One is called incentives. In computer science, a 6th of that is about blockchains, but it's more kind of broadly, sort of how, as a computer scientist, can you think like an economist, and why is that useful? And lots of case studies, and that's really kind of freshman level. So really kind of anyone should be able to watch the incentives in computer science and hopefully get a lot out of it.
01:04:56.186 - 01:05:38.760, Speaker B: And then something more blockchain specific is I've been developing this YouTube series called foundations of blockchains. It's like, I think, 30 hours now or something crazy of videos, and some of it gets technical, but a lot of that's actually, I think, quite accessible discussion. So just to kind of pitch my own kind of resources that I put out there, those are sort of two examples. And for those of you that kind of are less feeling like you want sort of the academic stuff and you more just want to get your hands dirty. I mean, one thing that's amazing about the space, and has been for years, is how you can just do that. You can really just sort of join projects, get on their discord, contribute to sort of the open source code they're building. And I would just say, get in there, right, and get down and dirty with like a couple of projects, learn about sort of the tech, learn about the community.
01:05:38.760 - 01:05:50.430, Speaker B: And I think pretty much everybody is really happy to have additional help with their projects. I would just say, don't waste time, don't wait for the cavalry, just go do it.
01:05:50.620 - 01:05:59.854, Speaker A: Perfect. On that note, let's thank Tim. All right, and thank you so much. That was amazing. That was a fire hose and thank you for sparing your time. All right.
01:05:59.892 - 01:06:00.302, Speaker B: Thank you.
01:06:00.356 - 01:06:00.700, Speaker A: That's it.
