00:00:03.800 - 00:00:34.514, Speaker A: Welcome back, everyone, to your newspaper of the imagination here. Big shout out to strange thing. And don't be so Vasya for the tweets. Welcome all new new subscribers to the pirate ship here. Artist Journal, March 16, 2023. Broadcasting the world from a very sunny Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and the fun continues with spagels Maskinen and his fabric fabulous screensaver series.
00:00:34.514 - 00:01:32.798, Speaker A: Do you know what my favorite part is? Can you guess what is your favorite part? Looking at this. This is one of only 50. This is only one of 50 works. So he made a ton, I think, you know, for me, the. My favorite part here is how this screensaver, which is the name of the series, not only goes beyond the black screen here, it goes beyond the hardware of the screen to the negative space that surrounds the screen just over here. And that, my friends, takes it from just a kind of cool, patterned, you know, whatever filter, whatever is going on here, rendition of a screensaver processed, however, and turns it into a work of art. Right? I mean, I was thinking to myself, I just came back from the gym and I was crossing the street and I was thinking this whole idea of rationality and how hard it is to be irrational.
00:01:32.798 - 00:02:11.344, Speaker A: And I think one of the reasons driving actually works is because we actually. We have to be rational because people aren't going to go through a red light unless they're not paying attention, unless they are, you know, out of it or whatever. But if they're paying attention, they're aware it's almost impossible. And to me, that's kind of a lesson in how we need to be rational. We are irrational creatures, mostly. You might even argue 90%. But that rational component, I think it's in the frontal, you know, cerebral cortex, or I'm probably getting this all, you know.
00:02:11.344 - 00:02:37.712, Speaker A: But in the front area here, the executive functioning, I think that's where the rational. We'll have to go through all this to make sure. But all to say, we have to be rational. And I think driving is an excellent example. So when we see stuff like this screensaver acting so irrationally, it just. I think that's part of the reason why we like art and poetry so much. This is one of the reasons, I would say.
00:02:37.712 - 00:02:52.672, Speaker A: It's just. It plays with that irrational side of things and. But there is a logic to it, you know, a different kind of logic. Anyways, we shall continue here. You can get this for three. So these were all minted. Screensaver number 44.
00:02:52.672 - 00:03:02.800, Speaker A: These were all minted. And I just clicked the first one I found. And I was like, that's beautiful. I can go with that. There are more. Look at this. And also going out of the screen.
00:03:02.800 - 00:03:24.868, Speaker A: So clearly a conscious decision on Spagels Maskinen's part. And yeah, they're a little slow to load here. But anyway, it is an awesome series. Go check it out. Yeah, unfortunately, foundation doesn't really cache. But anyway, maybe we'll see some of these show up. I'll let these load up a bit.
00:03:24.868 - 00:04:12.196, Speaker A: Maybe we'll come back. Thank you, everybody who attended yesterday's spaces with purple drank, also known as Drank Frazetta. It was a really awesome discussion. Again, as I say here, he kind of represents for me, he's a very nice guy and he's a very prolific artist. And for me he just kind of represents in a lot of ways this kind of spirit of this scene. He's just kind of a raw, unvarnished version of this spirit, like, who represents this, you know, nft underground spirit? And I just would probably turn to him for what that's worth. I mean, maybe it's not even worth mentioning, but anyways, he's just like, every scene kind of has their classics and I just consider purple drink to be a classic.
00:04:12.196 - 00:04:37.242, Speaker A: And he's great artist, too, and we learned a ton about bitcoin ordinals and all the different things that he's trying out. It was a very fun conversation. Me and Roentoon had an awesome time. So thank you everybody for attending. And a lot of people are listening afterwards too. We're at 189 listens here and Spotify is happening. I'm just having kind of weird issues with the feed from an old feed, which is getting confused.
00:04:37.242 - 00:05:01.332, Speaker A: And so the old feed shows up. So anyways, I am working on it. I am on it. These are going to be on Spotify shortly. I will let everybody know. Don't be so vasya with some bitcoin works, bitcoin compilation, volume one. Would you like to see some on chain NFT publishing? Some of my first ordinals on generative XYZ, which seems to be one of the main, if not the main marketplace.
00:05:01.332 - 00:05:16.814, Speaker A: One of the main marketplaces, one of one and additions from 0.0069 BTC. All works available in the links. And here are the works. And so this is generative XYZ. Here's don't be so Vascia's work. So very cool.
00:05:16.814 - 00:05:49.182, Speaker A: So what is this? Skulls and money and some, maybe Windows 95, maybe skulls and retro imagery. All sorts of stuff. Humanity versus clippy. And there's clippy so anyways, all the good stuff that we love here, digital art is a category on generative XYZ. So here's just like a taste of what's happening here and my understanding. So a mix of what we learned yesterday, which is you don't mint on bitcoin. It's a different process.
00:05:49.182 - 00:06:28.166, Speaker A: You inscribe. So it's not like Ethereum. And apparently you can do it for as little as, like, $5, from my understanding, if you're willing to wait, which I was surprised to learn. And also, I think, and this didn't come up, but just from me reading, I think you only get one image per satoshi, which is the smallest unit of bitcoin per sat. And I think there's maybe, I don't know if there's 100 million, however many there are. I think it might be limited according to how many sats there are. So you might want to, you know, put one on before all of a sudden the bots come in or whomever, and there are no more sats to mint on.
00:06:28.166 - 00:06:54.118, Speaker A: But I'm not positive on that. But anyways, it's really cool. And again, bitcoin could be around for a very, very long time, possibly. So it kind of makes things. It makes you want to mint on it, doesn't it? Thank you for all the comments from everybody. Vito, Mary, Migraine, Mark, Fendel, retro, Manny and Popple. He found it interesting.
00:06:54.118 - 00:07:10.630, Speaker A: Excellent episode. I find it interesting that in the rite of reply, they use both clair Silver and clair Silver. Twelve more ambiguity and already murky water. I think the idea there is, again, it was a very legal document. Not sure if I brought it up here. I did. Yeah.
00:07:10.630 - 00:07:54.966, Speaker A: And there's a couple of things I just want to mention just as well that I kind of realized after, first of all, in regard to this, I think they're doing that just, again, from a legal perspective, if you're mentioning someone, they're mentioning both the account and the person. So maybe that there's no ambiguity or wiggle room, because there was mention, I think, in her previous tweet that coindesk, in an update had mentioned that she was talking about legal action. So now they're covering themselves. And so in order to do that, they're saying, okay, they're making sure from a legal perspective, this is my theory, okay. We are discussing both the person and the account, right. So that there's nowhere a defense would be. Oh, well, actually, you weren't referring to me.
00:07:54.966 - 00:08:56.624, Speaker A: You're referring to, you know, so that is my take. On why the right of reply was done in that way. And again, the right of reply from a what I think it is kind of thinking it over is this is a legal notification. Two also, I think it might be also to variety, coindesk and NFT, now that there was misrepresentation in their stories. This is just me theorizing. I'm not a lawyer and I have no information, but I would, I suspect, because they mentioned in this tweet here, I think this is, and again, starting with right of reply, in case you didn't see last episode, I think this is a legal way of notifying the people who may have infringed on Paris blockchains who may have misrepresented Paris blockchain, according to Paris blockchain. So this is their way of kind of.
00:08:56.624 - 00:09:26.482, Speaker A: It's a legal notification is how I interpret it. And I'm not a lawyer, so to me, this kinda is a way of kind of. This is the process of actually litigation. I don't think anything's going to happen here, but this is their way of reserving the right to litigate if things keep on getting out of control and people keep attacking them. That is my interpretation. Thank you, Edmarola. And this is actually super duper important here.
00:09:26.482 - 00:09:52.044, Speaker A: Rune tune. It's pronounced Ed Rusche, not Ed Russia. Okay? He was born in Omaha, like me, before moving to California. So thank you for that, Rune tune. That's very important, these kinds of pronunciations. Just like, it's not art Basil, it's Art Basel. Okay? Because it may sound like a moot point and oh, well, who care, you know, like, but you show up to art Basel and you start pronouncing it art basil.
00:09:52.044 - 00:10:11.190, Speaker A: It's just like, it's just one of those things. So I totally appreciate it. Rune Toon, you chiming in there. And so it's Ed Rusche. Ed Rusche. So we are slightly more sophisticated today, thanks to Roon Tune, than we were yesterday. So anyways, thank you all for the comments.
00:10:11.190 - 00:10:30.826, Speaker A: And let's keep going here. And we had something else here. This is what I wanted to go to. Skomra had a very interesting comment. A preface to crash or an introduction to crash. My copy published in 1997 after the movie. I was a Cronenberg fan first.
00:10:30.826 - 00:10:57.626, Speaker A: Doesn't have a preface. I remember people walking out of the movie, too, thinking that Cronenberg knew it would happen. And I think I got it wrong. It wasn't France that banned crash, it was actually England. And France actually, I think, gave it like an award at the Cannes, I believe. I can't remember what award it was, but I think they actually got an award at Cannes. And it was England that banned it.
00:10:57.626 - 00:11:33.646, Speaker A: And this is extra ironic because then, like, ten years later, they wanted to knight JG Ballard. And then he was like, no, thank you. You know, and him kind of point. And he pointed out, he named names. He said, you know, there's this guy who claimed to be a very kinda for the people, you know, a politician or movement kind of guy. And then he accepted, you know, who is. He's basically saying, there's a famous socialist who had been working his whole life and then accepted the knighthood, which in Ballard's view, was kind of a classist sort of thing to do.
00:11:33.646 - 00:11:46.584, Speaker A: And he saw a kind of hypocrisy there, which is. So he didn't accept the knighthood. So it's not Sir J. G. Ballard. And, yeah, so a rebel till the end. Original thinker till the end.
00:11:46.584 - 00:12:11.198, Speaker A: And finally. So, yeah, so this is what I wanted to say about this, and thank you for the comments. Gomorrah there. The introduction to crash is not always there, as you point out. And it's actually pretty hard to find. There are few editions, actually, that do have it. What I recommend you do.
00:12:11.198 - 00:12:35.610, Speaker A: There's actually two different ones. The 1995 one is the one we kind of touched on the other day. You actually want the 1974 introduction to the french edition of Crash. Okay. And that one is much longer. And this is basically a manifesto of sorts. It is a fascinating, an absolutely fascinating read.
00:12:35.610 - 00:13:17.586, Speaker A: It took me years to really understand what's going on here, but one. But once you start to get a feel on it, you see the gravity and the weight of Ballard as an original thinker. So I'm happy to go through this at a certain point. Maybe there should just be a show on the introduction to crash because maybe not everybody wants to hear about that, but maybe you just do a show, because I'd love to almost, like, parse that out piece for piece. And whoever wants to watch it can watch it continuing on here. So it is not a tamagotchi that oxine made and the jokes started flying. It is just some sort of, I guess, pocket organizer from Nakia.
00:13:17.586 - 00:13:30.778, Speaker A: And I think I brought up. So it was based on this. This work here is what I was discussing. And I thought this was a tamagotchi, and it's not. It is this. It is a Nakia. I'm guessing this is like a pocket organizer.
00:13:30.778 - 00:13:58.148, Speaker A: I've never even seen one before. So shout out to Aksi scene high back. And then indio robot put out this, which is totally hilarious. An actual tamagotchi with Uksin's colors here, the purple and the green. It's expertly done. Indio robot and Euxine's skull inside with even all the little glitches expertly done there. So that is hilarious.
00:13:58.148 - 00:14:21.014, Speaker A: So anyways, it is a Nakia pocket organizer, whatever you'd call it. I didn't look it up, but that is what it is. And while we're on Xing here, he's been releasing a little bit of mysteriousness here with these cards. You wonder where he's gonna put them. So anyways, there's a FOMO card. Maybe he's gonna put these on bitcoin. Rug pull.
00:14:21.014 - 00:14:38.586, Speaker A: So having fun with the cards here. So not sure where this is gonna go. Rug pull. Trading card, extra super rare. Maybe he's just having fun. Very cool. And finally, the name of the photography museum that I couldn't think of is c o Berlin.
00:14:38.586 - 00:15:07.674, Speaker A: Okay. And here's just an example. And when you look at these works here, like, again, like, I think the works we look at, you know, even some of the AI works, I mean, again, remember, we're talking about strange thing. Like, I mean, I think it would be pretty head turning if you put a strange thing on here. Let's put it that way. And it is, interestingly, finally on this, it's a private exhibition space. It feels like a public institution because it's big and it has that feeling to it, but it's actually private for photography and visual media.
00:15:07.674 - 00:15:36.174, Speaker A: And it's close to zoo station Zulugischer Garten in Charlottenburg here in Berlin. It's a big place, so I didn't realize it was private. So we keep learning here. So a couple of interesting stories just on the NFT scene here. So Instagram is sunsetting digital collectible. NFTs features will be disabled across the platform. Now, I don't know if anybody ever actually got it working.
00:15:36.174 - 00:16:08.808, Speaker A: Like, I kind of, I think I attached my metamask at one point to my instagram, but I still couldn't figure out a way to make things for sale. So some people feel that this is a bearish thing. I feel like they put a half effort into it. So. And maybe they're doing this, I suspect, for. It's kind of always back to this legal issues, I think, for, because all this regulation that's coming in the last thing. Because all of a sudden, if these are considered let's say an NFT is considered a security.
00:16:08.808 - 00:16:40.910, Speaker A: All of a sudden, Facebook or meta could be considered selling securities. So I don't really see it as bearish as I think could be perceived. I think it's just like, okay, this is getting rough out here. Let's just take this stuff off. I don't even know if you could actually buy or sell on it yet. So maybe they haven't done any infractions, and maybe they just don't want the attention because it's expensive, I mean, and they can always restart it. So they're probably getting a sense of, you know, a crackdown coming in.
00:16:40.910 - 00:17:13.324, Speaker A: Crypto. Now, another kind of big thing that happened here, which I found totally mysterious, was form function, which is the main one of one platform on Solana, basically. You might call it the super rare of Solana. They're shutting down, which I think is just the weirdest thing ever, because it's so hard to build a brand like they've done. They have a great name. It's so hard to actually just get that brand recognition. And where artists believe in you and the collectors believe in you.
00:17:13.324 - 00:18:04.310, Speaker A: So here it is. We have some sad news to share today. Form function is shutting down on March 29. This was an extremely difficult decision. However, after much discussion and careful consideration, we've come to the conclusion that we cannot continue to operate form function, kind of a circular. There's no reason given, other than we cannot do it, which was kind of interesting in and of itself, and we're proud to help creators. And so, you know what I would do? Like, I'm, again, why aren't they selling it? It kind of reminds me of hen, like, isn't this worth money? Isn't this worth, like a million bucks, at least even in this environment, isn't this worth like 250,000? I don't know why they're not selling it, because when I see this, it's like, you know what, I think they could or should or anything.
00:18:04.310 - 00:18:56.384, Speaker A: Just speaking from the sidelines here, and I don't know how hard it is, but what I'd love for this very good looking, good feeling platform to do, wouldn't it be great if they had gone multi chain? And they were early on dot, and they were early on Cardano, and they just went multi chain, and then you maybe add the notifications from object, you add the curator tools from foundation, and all of a sudden you have a behemoth, potentially, and something that's already good to go. You get started on dot or whatever your blockchain phantom. And then also, I mean, so I don't know why it's not being sold. That's what I don't understand. But maybe there's more to it, and maybe I don't even understand, you know? So I'm. I say that from a very layman's perspective. Like, I don't understand and I literally don't.
00:18:56.384 - 00:19:14.034, Speaker A: So they may have very good reasons why they're not doing that. This was kind of funny, Sabato. And we will get to the art very shortly. But there is a lot of just kind of 48 hours in our newspaper of the imagination here. This platform rejected. This is Sabato. This platform form function, which was a.
00:19:14.034 - 00:19:37.364, Speaker A: You had to apply, okay? It was like, just, like, super rare. This platform rejected my application last year, sent me a condescending email, kept me on their mailing list. Lol. But now they are sad, broke, and I am still selling out my arts. I guess the gatekeep walled garden approach didn't work out for y'all. I guess not. And so I think a very.
00:19:37.364 - 00:20:04.238, Speaker A: I think Sabato has the right, and I don't want to say he's dancing on their grave, and maybe he'd laugh at that characterization, but I think he has the right. I mean, and Sabato is one of my favorite artists in the entire space. Okay. And it does kind of bring up this question. I brought it up, I think, like, four months ago, how they. Cause he had mentioned in another tweet how form function had rejected this piece, which, when he applied. And so he's putting it on, like, exchange art.
00:20:04.238 - 00:20:24.954, Speaker A: I think it ended up on ethereum, one of his great drawing studies. Right? So all to say, and you know what? I was. I was joking to myself. It's like, sabato, because he's selling out his arts, he should buy form function. And that would be like. That would be the final exclamation mark on the whole thing. So see you later.
00:20:24.954 - 00:20:42.764, Speaker A: Anyway, so. Yeah. And here is. I'm not gonna go in depth here, but here is the information here. It was really hard to get a reason. It seems like they just got tired of it. So I don't know why.
00:20:42.764 - 00:21:24.352, Speaker A: Again, it's sort of like hand. Like, why don't you just sell the website? Is there no buyers? I mean, I would think someone in the web3 space would want to buy this. And again, like, again, in my little fantasy world with endless budget, I'd just be like, can we build this on dot two and on Cardano? And you know, ETH and everything. And then all of a sudden, and again, I mean, I said it before, you put notifications, you put curator tools, just take that whole idea and like, holy. And then you open it to Sabato's point and then what? What are you left with? Like, because the thing is, is it's a beautiful interface. Okay. And finally, edge queue.
00:21:24.352 - 00:22:06.514, Speaker A: So I was going to mint on Sol via form function, but form function is going to close the 29th, it seemed like. Again, it seems like they were doing quite well. So what sole marketplace do you peeps recommend? I only know exchange art and I've never minted on Sol. I've wanted to, right when I was about to is when it kind of, we had the big FTX things. So all of a sudden it's like, okay, maybe this isn't a great idea, but yeah. So anyways, continuing on, unknown collector, speaking of curators, curatorship and artists or just enjoy. So he's use chat JPT to get the conversation going or just enjoy some beautiful art in the unknown self curated collective drop in foundation worlds tomorrow, which is today.
00:22:06.514 - 00:22:57.694, Speaker A: More info in my pinned tweet. So here, unknown collector is putting a whole like trailer for the, for his curated collection here that he's put together, or showcase, as you know, some people might put it. And we're gonna keep looking at the word curator. Look how cool this is. And it's like, this is very disruptive in my opinion, too. You know, like if I'm super rare and I'm looking at this, it's like, well, do we have trailers, you know, or do we have curators that are coming in like they have curators? But again, this open sourcing it back to kind of what Sabato was saying with the art, it seems to work. And what is the secret of object success has been this open sourcing, I would argue, because nobody had to apply.
00:22:57.694 - 00:23:30.768, Speaker A: And, you know, with form function going down and again, you wonder about object one, you know, we'll just keep watching it and have fun, you know, with it and, and see what happens. This is also something that's happening. So just a ton of business in 48 hours here. Tezos TZ creator will be available to early access users in three days. The countdown begins. And this seems like a manifold XYZ type thing. Early access users who have signed up will be able to build and deploy contracts, own your smart contracts and mint nfts and tokens in Tezos.
00:23:30.768 - 00:23:52.662, Speaker A: So it sounds like this is the manifold Xyz of Tezos, potentially. And popple is interested. So I love how, like, this is a true community. I mean, there's popple on the YouTube comments. There's popple on this story. You see how small this scene is, and it's a golden age over here. You gotta love it.
00:23:52.662 - 00:24:07.304, Speaker A: Mid journey five. So here is this. Maybe probably a lot of you have seen this. This is, like, 2.4 million views. So I don't want to belabor this, but I do want to just point out. Let me see if I can.
00:24:07.304 - 00:24:26.224, Speaker A: I just want to show you very quickly, because people like my mom and other people might not have. Might not be seeing these tweets. So mid journey has a new update. So there's v four versus v five. So this is mid journey v four. And here is the new update with the same prompt. Okay, so you can see like, this.
00:24:26.224 - 00:24:42.154, Speaker A: It's just becoming ever more convincing here. Same prompt. And what's great is they actually show the prompt. So there's a lot to learn from here. And so here's one prompt. And here's the new one. This looks like a vogue photo shoot here.
00:24:42.154 - 00:25:07.494, Speaker A: And we have that one. Here's another one. V four and v five. So you see they're starting to iron out the distortions in, like, the eyes, for example. Here you still get a tiny bit. And here they're really starting to. Some people are saying, oh, it's not that big of an update, but getting stuff like that ever more perfect is actually a pretty big update.
00:25:07.494 - 00:25:21.242, Speaker A: Here's some more. So this is v four, I believe. And this is v five. Some air force ones. Those look fantastic. So you do see an improvement here. Someone from the 1990s era photo of a young man sitting.
00:25:21.242 - 00:25:43.906, Speaker A: So here's the v four and v five. It is that much more persuasive. It is that much more. I'd almost call it photographic. So now the keyboard here still has that, what I'd call some AI distortion, but it's less than you'd find in your traditional v four. You see more distortion here. So, anyways, just kind of interesting.
00:25:43.906 - 00:26:08.416, Speaker A: And a strange thing is experimenting and having fun with v five. So goodbye sleep. Exactly. And so anyways, so people are experimenting out here. Here's another one. I've been adapting my prompting for mid journey V five to include more natural language, and it's working and freaking me out how good there's. So, anyways, pretty impressive AI rendering here.
00:26:08.416 - 00:26:43.860, Speaker A: It looks like it's getting closer and closer to photography. You think in a year or two, we won't even be able to tell. And probably a lot of you saw this as well. Someone was able to create a pong game from basically one tweet, I think, or one prompt in under 60 seconds. So maybe there was a few. But basically they created the pong game in 60 seconds using chat GPT, asking it to make the code and everything. And clownvamp to me, actually had the most stunning tweet on the mid journey.
00:26:43.860 - 00:27:05.784, Speaker A: V five. Looks like V five is super, super sensitive to word order. Interesting observation. Experimented and found this worked decent. Edgard Degas painting of a Disney princess head and shoulder portrait. V five stylize zero. So you can change stylize from zero to a thousand.
00:27:05.784 - 00:27:28.848, Speaker A: Some of these are pretty convincing. De Gah. Like, it's not entirely like this. Almost. May be too refined, say like the face, it might be too sharp, weirdly. But you look at the background here, it really does have a Degas feeling to it. So very, very interesting stuff going on here.
00:27:28.848 - 00:27:56.518, Speaker A: And back to Sabato, the ever quotable Sabato. The feeling you get when you realize that post photography means that everything is now photography. So maybe just commenting on how, you know, look at the five fingers here. You still get that. Maybe just commenting on how. How photographic the new mid journey is. You see there's still that extra, you know, finger here and there's.
00:27:56.518 - 00:28:14.124, Speaker A: So that is interesting. Still getting that distortion. And check this out. Flora Marquez, I think I never showed you these stickers from the Mirandanga Republic. I'm trying to figure out how big these are. They are very cool. And how apropos to make these stickers.
00:28:14.124 - 00:28:27.660, Speaker A: I mean, stamps these days are stickers. So I just love it. I'd love to see how big these are. And I wonder if they're for sale. Like pretty interesting. And here's the latest. Flora Marquez.
00:28:27.660 - 00:28:49.628, Speaker A: Rain inspires me. And this was actually done for Camp Creme, interestingly. And we're gonna look at the latest camp creme. Are we doing here? We have to run through this episode. So anyways, Flora Marquez does her version of camp, which is really cool edition of one. And let's very quickly just see. Sold for 17.
00:28:49.628 - 00:29:11.528, Speaker A: So very wonderful there. And Greco with working on another painting. And so that's looking cool. You see the painter's tape here? My painter's tape is green. I'm not sure what the blue tape is, but it's probably similar. Looks like he's painting on Masonite. No, actually he has taped probably a piece of paper to a piece of Masonite.
00:29:11.528 - 00:29:39.404, Speaker A: And that is probably what's going on. Anyway, just cool to see the work in progress there. And finally, rustic digital art with all the commentary. It's almost a third commentary this show today. Rustic digital art experimentation should have no fear and limits. So remember, rustic from yesterday or Tuesday, had the photography works with the crop Marios and the just super bold work there. Rustic has commented on that.
00:29:39.404 - 00:30:10.430, Speaker A: Courageous works. As I was saying, experimentation should have no fear and limits. Have a good night. So absolutely, absolutely rustic and a great thought, and that's why I share it here. And Yuri, speaking of which, between Sunset and dawn, this is from 2021, but I thought it just fits so well with Rustic's statement that he just said here, because I see a photograph in the middle of this really edgy digital painting. I mean, I'd almost. If I was writing a book on this scene, I'd almost want to call these.
00:30:10.430 - 00:30:42.494, Speaker A: And this is just my first past draft, as I say this, the experimentalists, you know, and I'd put Yuri J. In there and rustic digital art, like, the guys who are really unafraid to take aesthetic risks and, you know, using the mosaic filter, putting the crop Mario in just, like, a semi blurry photograph. These are really edgy things to do. It's kind of back to this idea. Like I was saying, with the cars, it's very hard to be irrational. Okay. Like, for me, I trick myself.
00:30:42.494 - 00:31:06.714, Speaker A: I'll do my work on several layers, and then I remove layers. That is how I can be irrational, because it's so hard. Okay, continuing on, Anna. So this is a new work by Uri J. And I thought a really interesting work. Again, you see the experimentation in the digital processing here in the hair. Slightly reminiscent of those pfps that we were seeing by.
00:31:06.714 - 00:31:37.284, Speaker A: Was it hasdrubal waffle? And also, gosh, I'm forgetting his name. Also kind of in that kind of niche scene over there. Gosh, I'll come back to that person. But where, you know, the hair will be treated one way, the face will be treated with a different process. So, again, it's this idea of profile picture as a template to experiment with. And so the shirt will be done a certain way. I have to catch up with that project.
00:31:37.284 - 00:32:02.660, Speaker A: I'm not sure if they're still putting out stuff. Anyways, a new work from Lorna Mills on super rare, which is always an exciting occurrence. And so, as she continues to push her limits, I think here, like, she's bringing in a lot of different stuff. Like, look at this. See this mask here? This is, like, I don't recall this being Lorna Mills. So this is great. You know, I love the experimentation.
00:32:02.660 - 00:32:29.264, Speaker A: There is a lot going on here. It's not just one subject, you know, the eggs. And so anyways, I'm really enjoying watching it and still instantly recognizable as her work list. Price of two ETH and super cool prores 422 Hq version available. Interesting. Again, Lorna Mills almost comes from that contemporary art world. I think she does, actually.
00:32:29.264 - 00:32:56.914, Speaker A: At least I remember Wolf Leeser from the digital art museum as the person who introduced me to Lorna Mills work. Maybe in 2017. That's how I have heard of Lorna Mills before I've ever heard of crypto. And so this is almost like reminiscent of contemporary art where they actually give you the USB, the file on a USB. So anyways, very cool work from Lorna Mills on super rare. And this is don't be so Vasya. Big shout out.
00:32:56.914 - 00:33:13.046, Speaker A: And they are on this new platform. I think it's ninfa. Look at how big this is. Please don't crash my mic here. Are we gonna make it? We are gonna make it. Okay. So anyways, really interesting work as ever.
00:33:13.046 - 00:33:46.664, Speaker A: And again, I think we have a graphica Png, who I love to group. Don't be so vascular with just really interesting experimental digital art, you know? So this is latest bid, 0.07. So these are going for very cheap, $116. And so, yeah, so that is out there on Ninfa IO. And here's another one on foundation. And this sold for very cheap, 0.069. To who? To lawyered.
00:33:46.664 - 00:34:13.080, Speaker A: That is the theme of the last couple of days. And this is part of a collection called Nocebo coronated chaos. So again, just super interesting work here from don't be so vasya. And here is graphica Png. Maybe it's all about the jpegs you got along the way. And again, just these really wonderful distortions here. Again, we're back to this irrationality.
00:34:13.080 - 00:34:36.910, Speaker A: And when you start to tweak that irrationality, it just feels like art. It looks like poetic art, you know? So just beautiful work here from graphica Png. This could almost hang with it as well as asleep, sleepy head. And this is on object. And I just saw this on Twitter. And playing again, just like really edgy experimentation. You see the.
00:34:36.910 - 00:35:00.994, Speaker A: What looks like a photoshop canvas in the background and some AI figures, almost like Varya in the foreground. And do we have some Varya here? No? Yeah, we were looking at Varya's work yesterday. But anyways, you can see how all these artists could hang together works by Rosatio, and they're doing quite well. Sold for. .1 new noise. This is on foundation.
00:35:00.994 - 00:35:26.394, Speaker A: And this, I believe Rosatio was mentioning, was from looking at Michael Macasso's work on this show. Actually, Rosatio put out a tweet about that. So that's super cool. And that is a pixelated version of this egg here. So it keeps being interesting. So we were watching this work in progress, and it has sold, and it was minted on the 14th. And there are a few more here.
00:35:26.394 - 00:35:47.086, Speaker A: Let me just bring them up. I like the change in color. I wasn't, you know, I've gotten used to the black and the black, the kind of matte black, and it looks beautiful. But this is also really cool, too. This sold for one, and they're all selling. Like, if you go to the page, look at this. I mean, you basically are list.
00:35:47.086 - 00:36:18.988, Speaker A: Rosacea is listing it very cheap, which is actually a brilliant strategy because it forces the work to be moved. So if you put it to your minimum that you. If you're willing to take $100 for your work, which, frankly, I think a lot of artists in Berlin with their, you know, physical works, if it's not some huge painting, most of the work is not moving. So, again, the promise of this scene is the work moves, you know, so you put it cheap, it'll move. Like those works from the peloponnesian war that I sold. Those are all the cheapest that I listed for. And those two started moving.
00:36:18.988 - 00:36:46.824, Speaker A: So. So it's a lesson to me. And I see it here again. And here's another one playing with the skulls in a different color, playing with kind of a blue here, really cool, kind of yellow kind of sun with an arch around it or a circle around. It went for 0759. And the collectors are thrilled because for, you know, $150 or whatever the case may be, or $120, they're getting a one of one from Rosatio. So all very cool.
00:36:46.824 - 00:37:11.716, Speaker A: And this one went for 0.08. And look, by the end of it, Rosatio looks like they're gonna have, like, you know, 0.35 ETH. Not bad, right? A third of an ETH. So, you know, bringing home the bacon as an artist, right? Look at this super cool work from Ed Marolla, I think. Is this the second work? It is the third work. So look at Ed.
00:37:11.716 - 00:37:28.980, Speaker A: Everything is selling. Everything is selling. So how cool is that? Everything is selling 0.15.29. So ed has just started out on foundation. As far as I understand. And it's doing fabulous. So that is really cool.
00:37:28.980 - 00:37:46.994, Speaker A: And this work here, Golden Hill, a pretty nice work, if you ask me. So I imagine this as well will sell and. No bids yet. No bids yet. Marolla dreams, I think a really, really nice work. It might be hidden because we were on the main page. Like it could be in the collections.
00:37:46.994 - 00:38:05.726, Speaker A: You see that. So as a collector, there are opportunities when. Yeah, just in. Sometimes things get hidden a little bit when you put them in collections. Super rare is the same. And this is on Tazos Mustache Mountain Valley from Edmarola. So another interesting work.
00:38:05.726 - 00:38:37.812, Speaker A: The lighting is quite interesting. I mean, when you zoom out and look at this, you see almost like this kind of stage lighting which seems to be going with what seems like another fire here. And this beautiful moving background, which is trademark. And Ed Morolla, like in the sun that's being kind of disrupted. Or moon, probably this half drawn moon. So anyways, and then this person here. And then almost kind of back to this almost ritual, ancient kind of feeling in nature.
00:38:37.812 - 00:39:09.246, Speaker A: Mustache Mountain valley. Let's see. It sold for 90 within 8 hours. So you see this price point is very interesting, isn't it? You know, collectors, if you like, because things are selling fast. If you're willing to sell them for between your works for between 75 and 150 works are really selling in a very bear market, you know, continuing on here. So 90 tezos for this. This hasn't moved yet from Edmarola.
00:39:09.246 - 00:39:27.034, Speaker A: So another one of one with the more trademark purple and some great textures here in an awesome frame. What is this called? Noob. So that is interesting. And this was just listed today. And. Okay, so Camp Cram. So I'm gonna have to run through this episode here.
00:39:27.034 - 00:39:42.826, Speaker A: So anyways, here is the latest. We're going to take a look at Sabato's work. And I'd love to look at everybody's. But here is just the latest. We look at edge queues too, on Camp Creme. So they're having a ton of fun. There was Flora Marquez that we looked at.
00:39:42.826 - 00:40:10.214, Speaker A: We're going to look at this one as well. And this one. So we're going to do a little sampling here. But a ton of fun is being had here on Camp creme. So here is Sabato. So he did another basically, you know, gaudy sports car with like a, you know, or gaudy angel, you know, with that kind of fake gold plated angel, I guess silver in this case. And with a quote from the Old Testament.
00:40:10.214 - 00:40:35.250, Speaker A: This time it is Jeremiah so hilarious. And I'm a huge fan of humor in art. Again, go back to Andre Breton's essay. Essay on, I think it's called black humor, what we'd probably call dark humor today, camp creme edition. So hilarious. Like, it's just, you know, the Jeremiah quote. And it goes beautifully with the other one created with mid journey.
00:40:35.250 - 00:40:56.604, Speaker A: So isn't this interesting? And processed with deluxe paint. So now he's taking his renderings from mid journey and then processing them. You gotta love it. And it sounds like a very quick process. And you got to love a good little business, right? I mean, it's. Or put it this way, you got to love a good. A way of being prolific in an interesting way.
00:40:56.604 - 00:41:15.926, Speaker A: I mean, look at Warhol. We love Warhol's works. And how many could he make a day? Probably like 200, right? So, yeah, now, Bezaya also released one. And that looks like Dennis Rodman. I'm not sure who that is. Dennis. And all the color and Donatella, maybe Versace.
00:41:15.926 - 00:41:29.870, Speaker A: There we go. And so that is for. Also for american camp. And let's just see what happened here. It has just been minted. So anyways, classic bazaya and beautiful. And also waste man.
00:41:29.870 - 00:41:45.290, Speaker A: Gold minevish. No, belle vacance. So also joining the fun here with Camp Creme. And here is just some classic waste mine. Gold mine. Vic, you got McDonald's balloon, you got a pepe, you got a clown. All we need is the failed.
00:41:45.290 - 00:42:07.044, Speaker A: Maybe this is the failed artist who is now a boxer or something. I don't know what's going on here, but available for 420 edition of 15. And also mota Mt. Heaven can wait. So also playing with the camp here. And we have a unicorn that appears to have run into the wall here. And more.
00:42:07.044 - 00:42:22.696, Speaker A: More flying creatures here and everything. So people are having a ton of fun with the camp. And continuing on, Daniel W. Divine inspiration. Second piece from Camp Creme. Divine inspiration. Interesting.
00:42:22.696 - 00:42:50.584, Speaker A: I'm not sure I understand this work. There seems to be a lot going on, I guess the campiness. And again, anybody out there, feel free to correct me. I assume it's maybe with the wallpaper and maybe the vase and, like, the classic kind of plant here, you know, divine inspiration. I think of the phaedrus, which is Plato's phaedrus. The four kinds of inspiration. The four kinds.
00:42:50.584 - 00:43:24.438, Speaker A: And divine madness, which Lee Perry actually liked to quote. Yeah. So is one of the four forms of. We're going to go back to the phaedrus. This is incredibly important because gogolitis brought up inspiration in our Twitter spaces and how important it is. He was really highlighting inspiration and he actually, I should quote that and put it in a work on TikTok and on YouTube shorts. But all to say, we're going to come back to this idea of inspiration, it is a key.
00:43:24.438 - 00:44:00.784, Speaker A: You know, I was thinking to myself as I was having some wine with a friend, how did I put it? Inspiration is what happens when you allow yourself to be possessed, which is almost kind of a platonic, Plato's phaedrus. But it's sort of like when you forget yourself, when you allow me even talking here. You know, this isn't planned, right, you know, so it's kind of tuning, it's allowing yourself to be possessed. That is what inspiration is. So, anyways, we're a little off topic here and behind schedule, as per usual. Let's keep going. This is hilarious from FAIC aifashion, who is a very nice account.
00:44:00.784 - 00:44:22.966, Speaker A: And they're super cool. Go follow them on Twitter. And they have some great, beautiful campy shoes here with some leopard print and some really interesting camouflage. So very cool, stable diffusion in Photoshop. So shout out to them. And here's some more. I mean, again, these are so campy that they look like they could sell.
00:44:22.966 - 00:44:47.286, Speaker A: Like, I could see people wearing these. Like they're actually, you know, back to AI fashion, right? So someone calls. Strange thing. And yeah, I think they actually already know each other, so no call is probably required there. And here's another one from edge queue. Let's see if we can get the music going. So there's Susan Sohntag, camp icons.
00:44:47.286 - 00:45:25.868, Speaker A: And is this Roger Waters, John Waters, Terry Mugler and Ziggy Stardust there. So some real cool creativity here and great music, you know, for the party. In my head, the Tezos party, that human model, I believe is the name, was gonna do maybe edge q also is in the lineup there. I mean, there's some really good musicians in this scene. Here's one more from camp. Creme tesseles roseus AI artwork made with mid journey, edited in gimp by AI tiquities. So interesting.
00:45:25.868 - 00:45:47.410, Speaker A: Kind of almost like the mosaic filter a little bit. Not a bad looking work. Kind of interesting. And edition of five, only two tazos, so still available. Two still available. Now moving on from the camp robocop or robo rip from Haiti Rockette. So putting out a very cool one.
00:45:47.410 - 00:46:07.226, Speaker A: I snagged one. I saw the tweet, ran to the computer, and I was able to get one edition of 13. So pretty low edition. Yeah. So just a really cool Nintendo rom glitch from Haiti, Rockette, and another one from Glitchtown Arcade. And this is on foundation. Where are you? So a couple of.
00:46:07.226 - 00:46:44.626, Speaker A: Let me see. Oh, and there's so some interesting music. And anyways, Vito has put out another one. Kind of cool music, isn't it? So anyways, the Nintendo glitch ROM experimentation continues and into pixel art. Stalomere private control station. I saw this courtesy of Gogolitis, who retweeted this with some nice comments. Really interesting piece, isn't it? I mean, Stalomere is a one of a kind of like the Sci-Fi pixel art could hang in the same show as actually popple, but maybe like have its own room.
00:46:44.626 - 00:47:12.274, Speaker A: You know, you put popple's works in a room, or maybe, you know, you put them together, but they kind of hang. I think they actually could hang well together because they have a bit of an alien feel to it, a lot of the work. So anyways, Sci-Fi pixel art available for twelve tezos set on secondary. Yes. How much? Let's just see the primary, because eight tazos, so, you know, sold out at 22 people. Pixel art is incredibly popular. And here's another one, I think, also retweeted by gogolitis.
00:47:12.274 - 00:47:33.458, Speaker A: So gogolitis is helping the community there. Notorious men XTZ and this is called departure 350 tezos. And I think this is still available. Again, we're back to the Sci-Fi pixel art. There's a. Yeah, there's an idea which obviously other people have had. And here's some other works by notorious man XDZ.
00:47:33.458 - 00:47:51.534, Speaker A: I've never heard of them. Self destruct by lighting of pixel art. So anyways, interesting artist that looks really cool. Almost like Nicholas Dietrich type pixels. Fascinating. And Roccano has a couple of works relegation. So a couple of just experimental abstract pixel artworks.
00:47:51.534 - 00:48:06.570, Speaker A: So that is cool. And here is another one. Love parade, which. Yeah, doesn't happen, I don't think, anymore here. And prism for serenity. So these are a couple more from stipin pixel. So we looked at the first two.
00:48:06.570 - 00:48:30.148, Speaker A: And here is more experimentation with these interesting kind of pixelations here. Prism for adventure. And another work of a building. And just treated with this heavy pixelation. Just interesting. A bustling city with towering skyscrapers and neon lights, inviting you to explore and discover. And continuing on, a beautiful work from Elbie glitchy.
00:48:30.148 - 00:49:02.496, Speaker A: And look at this desire on foundation. So, as we keep saying here, the different blockchains, different platforms, bringing about a different kind of work. And so this is quite beautiful where the waterfall kind of gets glitched out here. You see this almost surreal computer screen with an arm coming out of it. Almost like, almost could. Like the horse has a bit of a camp creme feel to it. And the roti, the, you know, orbiting the marble.
00:49:02.496 - 00:49:18.728, Speaker A: Orbiting the bigger marble here. I wish, I wish my love was real. Very cool work. This is kind of like very stylish work. I feel like this could hang in Paris or something on a. You know, if you have a gallery on the street, I feel like this would go really well. Available for 0.22
00:49:18.728 - 00:49:37.598, Speaker A: eths, available for a song. I wasn't sure if Santiago was being for real here. Mid journey five. I couldn't tell. You can't tell with mid journey. So anyways, wherever this came from, I thought this was a pretty good looking abstract. So curious to know if that actually is mid journey five.
00:49:37.598 - 00:50:17.676, Speaker A: I'd be pretty impressed. And continuing on, Buboy has a new work, a new illustration in a trademark style, and this is listed for 815 ETH in a space world. So just a really nice look at how well that fills the screen there. So just really cool kind of work. He'd hang really well with that retro Sci-Fi artist who also has these muted colors, almost like print colors. That's what that looks like, as if it was printed on paper, so it's not as bright as screen colors. And Fokkek super rare has a couple of just interesting works.
00:50:17.676 - 00:50:42.924, Speaker A: I'm just building a circle of virtual punks, underground art, retro nostalgia, technology, blockchain geeks, etcetera. Yeah, so I thought it was just kind of. I don't know what he's up to. Cool music too. Status enemy walk. So I have no idea what's going on here, but it sure looks cool, which is why I show it to you. And here's another kind of just building different music.
00:50:42.924 - 00:51:42.228, Speaker A: The fun, as Gogolite has said, you know, the joy, the joy. You know, I've recorded this program, and when I've one time where I went to hit stop on the video, and then I hit stop on this recording, and then I had to redo it because I don't edit my videos for the most part, except for unless the microphone dies at the end, like yesterday. Anyways, Kinect Zapata, who just continues to impress from over here, really. Again, back to these experimentalists, these digital experimentalists, and not letting go of an idea. You know, this rainbow that Kanexepoda was working on months ago that we're showing and really just unafraid to test the limits. And it's looking actually pretty good looking here from an aesthetic point of view. Just interesting.
00:51:42.228 - 00:52:20.874, Speaker A: Eighties landscape with 2020 computational power continues to be interesting. And look at this stunning, stunning self portrait. AI self portrait by Mister shapeless. This is a beautiful work, and it just looks like it has the richness of an oil painting. Like the, you know, oil painting before the screen. I'd argue oil painting had the most saturated colors in existence that we know of that we've, other than maybe looking at the sun or direct sunlight, but that doesn't really count in my world, you know, like our reds. And I think that's why we like oil painting and why it's kind of achieved its status.
00:52:20.874 - 00:52:44.772, Speaker A: This kind of reminds me of that. And this is a self portrait, and it's a poetic one. Look at the arm. That looks like it's facing the front, but the head is facing the back. This gorgeous sky, this saturated, beautiful blue. And it looks painted. I mean, you almost imagine in the prompt, like, oil painting is there or something.
00:52:44.772 - 00:53:14.424, Speaker A: It is beautiful. Right now, is it only 0.25 ETH with 3 hours to go, so lemonade too, may get a steal of a deal here. Continuing on, Godfrey by clownvamp. So, Clown vamp's second work on super rare and accepted an offer of three ETH. And I believe this was a. I believe this was a commission, and this is of a famous director who actually, I have to admit, I haven't heard of.
00:53:14.424 - 00:53:41.296, Speaker A: My film is my. Yeah, I'm almost a film illiterate, I'm half embarrassed to say. A birthday present for Godfrey Radio, commissioned by his loving friend Shrimp Doe, an AI assisted piece by clownvamp. AI assisted. Interesting part of panic land and exploration into moral panic. And he wrote a bit, a tribute to legendary filmmaker Godfrey Rajo. And for.
00:53:41.296 - 00:54:11.404, Speaker A: And it was actually commissioned by Shrimpto for Godfrey's 82nd birthday. So maybe this was actually sent, or maybe just in the celebration of the birthday, not sure. But anyways, just cool work. And here again, filmmaker behind Koya Nick's Catsy and Katzy trilogy, and early critic of digital technology, critiques that now seem prescient to him. These gizmos have been entering our lives and disrupting our very ways of being. So this is from the singularity blog. And so.
00:54:11.404 - 00:55:04.334, Speaker A: But it's not technology in some addition to our nature, but rather that it is becoming nature itself. Well, this is a huge argument. I remember bringing this up in, actually, my ancient philosophy class, like, 20 years ago. Which is, if technology comes from us, doesn't it kind of make it natural in some respects? Like, is this a false distinction or a false. I don't know if you call a false dilemma, but, you know, is this a false distinction to say that this is not nature, that technology is not natural? Now I understand why we distinguish it and we can put reasons to it, but this is a very, very, very interesting subject and I don't really have too much more to say about it than what I've said here. It's just interesting to think about. Anyways, let's keep going here.
00:55:04.334 - 00:55:29.084, Speaker A: Shout out to Pavetchi or Pavetzi, if I'm pronouncing that right, and their series wanderlust, I think Pavetzi tweeted, like, how do you get on this show? And I was like, I think you just. Yeah, I think. Yeah. So anyways, I heard a legend that if you tweet something. Anyways, I thought, let's show. Is it Pavetzi? Pavetzi's work here. And this is beautiful.
00:55:29.084 - 00:55:49.160, Speaker A: When's this gonna be minted? I love this kind of grand, you know, rich, luxurious home. I want to live in a home like that with wonderful light. Maybe we will one day, my friends. Maybe we will last sold. So selling out 0.1 ETH. See that really attractive price point that people are willing to pay for art.
00:55:49.160 - 00:56:16.680, Speaker A: Wonderlust collection currently have sold out, but new artwork's coming this week. And so I think this is also a part of it. Or maybe another one coming up. And here is one of this figure here, almost this great Gatsby like figure looking at a painting at an interesting perspective here. Very interesting. Another artificial memory from images of the week. And so I just love these works here.
00:56:16.680 - 00:56:44.402, Speaker A: Again, they scream Rauschenberg to me, but completely original. So AI and collage, as far as I understand. And there is another one here. Just beautiful. Yeah, we'll have to bring those rauschenbergs up. If more of these come out and there's more time, I'll compare it to these beautiful, kind of smudgy Rauschenberg works which are not super well known. So anyways, cool work from images of the week.
00:56:44.402 - 00:56:54.082, Speaker A: Sold out at five tezos. So very reasonable. There's Aylay, there's ghost shoes back on the scene. That's great to see. Not a number. Mother and Sobach, 1965. So very cool.
00:56:54.082 - 00:57:17.400, Speaker A: And going into physical work here. Here is walk with some cleats. So I really like how walk is doing drawings as well, with colored pencils. It shows range, and it's just really cool. So interesting too, right? And really interesting subject matter. Don't forget he did Cinderella with the remember that in black and white. That was super interesting.
00:57:17.400 - 00:57:40.706, Speaker A: A couple of works from Instagram, Julia Cassina drawings, moon people. That was pretty interesting work. And you can see some of her other work here. So beautiful. What is this in terms of the medium here? It's hard to tell. It looks like kind of watercolor. It looks like a watercolor that's been desaturated, actually.
00:57:40.706 - 00:57:56.642, Speaker A: Black and white watercolor. Fascinating. And here, oil on canvas. We've looked at Mark Belden before, so here's another one. Oil on canvas. Just interesting, beautiful colors. We looked at a few variations on this and the great paper that Mark Belden uses.
00:57:56.642 - 00:58:14.998, Speaker A: And look at this. Yeah, this is awesome. Nugget brain, one of my favorite follows next week in Hong Kong. So nugget brain is doing very well, but still like an up and comer and just an awesome, awesome artist. You see it here. He can do anything. Petro Canada.
00:58:14.998 - 00:58:30.984, Speaker A: I wonder if he's canadian. This is a beautiful one of a plane taking off. So anyways, the f one and f one is kind of popular. I think there's a Netflix show because my nieces are into f one, which is the weirdest, craziest thing I've ever heard. Anyways, thank you for joining us, everyone. Until tomorrow, take care.
