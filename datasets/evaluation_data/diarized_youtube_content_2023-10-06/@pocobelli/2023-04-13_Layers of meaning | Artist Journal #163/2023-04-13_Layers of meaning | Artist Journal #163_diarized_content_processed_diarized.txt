00:00:07.560 - 00:00:19.910, Speaker A: We're flying through this once again. Welcome back, everyone. Look at this. A surprise around every corner. Boo boy. This beautiful homage to Picasso's Guernica. Beautiful, beautiful.
00:00:19.910 - 00:00:47.854, Speaker A: We'll do the comparison. Artist journal, April 13, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from a sunnier and sunnier Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. And again, it's like there's no shortage of just beautiful, interesting, provocative works to discuss. Thank you, everybody who showed up to the Twitter spaces yesterday. It was a great crowd and it was a great conversation.
00:00:47.854 - 00:01:09.008, Speaker A: I'm still editing it. It was kind of longer. We went a little long, so it's taken me a little longer to edit, but that will be out today if everything goes according to plan. And it should. So anyways, here is Buboy with this awesome. With this awesome homage here. Buboy in Guernica world just sold for 1.3
00:01:09.008 - 00:01:22.864, Speaker A: ETH. It came out yesterday. And bit of a bidding war, too here. Start at 0.1. Just shows, I guess you can start really low and then just see what happens there. I mean, that's pretty nice. From 0.1
00:01:22.864 - 00:01:46.050, Speaker A: to 1.3. And here's the write up. I've taken you guys to many places. Today I will introduce myself to some of the masterpieces of my beloved artists. This is the first black and white work, and it works. Just stunning, doesn't it? We'll look a little bit at the overview of Buboi's other work. And we've looked at Buboi before, and it's not often done a black and white work by Buboi.
00:01:46.050 - 00:02:05.834, Speaker A: It's very special to me. My main inspiration is Guernica by Picasso. Hope you enjoyed and continue fantasizing with me. 5700 by 4200. Nice size, too. So a lot of just great stuff going on. I mean, you gotta like the textured background, frankly, like, I didn't notice it before.
00:02:05.834 - 00:02:41.892, Speaker A: I guess that's probably a boo boy trademark to actually use a textured kind of background here. It's pretty effective because it just gives the whole thing a more richness. We were discussing texture yesterday on the Twitter spaces. And anyways, so again, just this monochromatic grayscale, I guess we could call it. Maybe that's more accurate. You know, when you see a lot of the familiar tropes, the horse, the woman screaming in despair, the light in the eye. And so everywhere you look, you see a reference.
00:02:41.892 - 00:03:06.144, Speaker A: But you know what's interesting? So, okay, we have this, the homage, and here is the original. It looks surprisingly simple. When you go back to this work here. So, buu boy, really, like, let me just show you the contrast here. I mean, really made it Buboy's own. Like, this is a much simpler work. And so I thought it just a brilliant homage.
00:03:06.144 - 00:03:53.082, Speaker A: And so glad I saw it. And yet. So this is in Madrid and we see all these very. Each little part of this painting feels so familiar, doesn't it? And I'm not even a huge. It's not like I return to this painting over and over, but I think we have over the course of our lives, it's such a famous image that we do. And the light here, interestingly, the electric light bulb, a reference to technology in a certain sort of way, it seems this electric light, but also the sun, also kind of an eye. So a lot of punning, visual punning, you know, is, you know, it's the equivalent of pun, you know, of ambiguity and punning in poetry, right? So it adds the aesthetic layers of meaning.
00:03:53.082 - 00:04:39.414, Speaker A: Right? So anyways, one more time here. Brilliant work. And then, you know, putting boo boy into it, too, with all the happy faces and, you know, tropes and so really, really nice piece. And Guernica, just for our information, was made in 1937. It is oil on canvas, and it's huge, three and a half meters by 776. And as you see, you see in that little flash up there, this is quite interesting, too, just on a purely historical level. Picasso painted Guernica at his home in Paris in response to the 26 April 1937 bombing of Guernica, a basque country town in northern Spain that was bombed by Nazi Germany and fascist Italy at the request of the spanish nationalists.
00:04:39.414 - 00:05:35.278, Speaker A: So, you know, if you think World War Two happened overnight, this is April 1937, that already things were happening here before the big war started. So an ominous time, you know, maybe not dissimilar from where we are right now. An ominous time. So anyways, here is Guernica, you know, attempting to call it prophetic back in 1937. You know, if you look at Freud's, and we'll move on here, but if you look at Freud's civilization and its discontents. When was that written? Because you look at the last paragraph, civilization and its discontents, and it was very pessimistic ending to this book. Let's just look at the date it was published.
00:05:35.278 - 00:05:54.812, Speaker A: It says 1930. There was a second edition, though, and I think it came out in like 39. Let me just put second edition and then we'll move on. Second edition. There you go. First published 1930. And we have the PDF here.
00:05:54.812 - 00:06:32.044, Speaker A: This is going to be all worthwhile, everybody, because we want to get the date, because we want to see how prescient Freud was on this second edition. Do we have, I think it was 1939, though. And here we should have the PDF first published 1930. Okay, the final sentence. Exactly. Now, this is important. Let's actually look at this very quickly.
00:06:32.044 - 00:07:04.424, Speaker A: So this is how Freud. And then we'll move on to the rest of our show. Ends civilization and its discontents. The final sentence was added in 1931, so it was only a year later when the menace of Hitler was already beginning to be apparent. So this is super famous here. Let me make it a bit bigger. The fateful question for the human species seems to me to be whether and to what extent their cultural development will succeed in mastering the disturbance of their communal life by the human instinct of aggression and self destruction.
00:07:04.424 - 00:08:12.784, Speaker A: It may be that in this respect, precisely the present time deserves a special interest. People have gained control over the forces of nature to such an extent that with their help, they would have no difficulty in exterminating one another to the last person they know this and hence comes a large part of their current unrest, their unhappiness and their mood of anxiety. And now it is to be expected that the other of the two heavenly powers, eternal Eros. So there being the death instinct, is it thanatos or thanos? And Eros will make an effort to assert himself in the struggle with his equally immortal adversary. So the death instinct to separate and break apart and the love instinct to bring together on a very basic, organic, biological level, according to Freud. But who can foresee with what success and with what results? So kind of a pessimistic final sentence here. So all to say, the jury's out, according to Freud, as to how this is all going to end up.
00:08:12.784 - 00:08:42.354, Speaker A: So you see, I mean, here, 1931, we're in 2023, as the French say, la plus a change. The more it changes, the more it's the same. So, interesting. Anyways, that was a big detour here, but I just thought, kind of interesting how early that was. I was surprised to see that here's some of buboes other work and. Yeah, so anyways, look at how well it's selling, actually is something I just wanted to mention here. Then we will run through the rest of this episode.
00:08:42.354 - 00:09:04.864, Speaker A: Two ETH, one ETH, 0.5 ETH, 0.84. I mean, boo boy is doing really, really well. Was that Pablo Puncaso who picked this up? You know, continues to do really well. And you can see, actually a development here, because these went for 0.2. So having almost a bit of a breakthrough here. The more you appear, the more just convincing and persuasive it is.
00:09:04.864 - 00:09:25.368, Speaker A: It's kind of like repetition is very powerful. It's maybe one of the most powerful, you could say, forms of PR. It's just repetition. I mean, we just keep seeing Boo boy. And so all of a sudden it's like, well, this. It starts to feel more and more significant. So it's, you know, all about kind of, you know, keeping persistent.
00:09:25.368 - 00:09:40.792, Speaker A: It's kind of a lesson in persistence to a certain degree, is the repetition. Anyways, we're all over the place here. Thank you, everybody. Again, horror 66 tuned in, which is pretty rad. I think it was 99. We're actually in the space. And then a few people have listened after.
00:09:40.792 - 00:10:07.834, Speaker A: Again, I'm editing this today, so that'll be on YouTube and Spotify today. So anyways, that was so much fun and big shout out and thank you to hastrubal waffle for showing up. That was just. I was just so pleased to do that show yesterday. And here actually, for those that are wondering, hastrubal mentioned some markers and I'd never heard. And it's always kind of an interesting thing. Tools copic markers.
00:10:07.834 - 00:10:24.254, Speaker A: And Roentoon was also a big fan of these. So I'd never actually heard of copic markers. I've heard of Molotov. And what's the other one that starts with pull? That's super famous. Anyways, it's always interesting to hear what materials people like. Here's copic. They're not cheap, actually.
00:10:24.254 - 00:10:57.274, Speaker A: See that? â‚¬236 for just a few markers. So probably pretty elite markers. And next episode, I think we're going to do something with museums. A discussion on museums. So Rune thun actually met up, as you saw in the photo yesterday, if you watched with Doctor version at MoMA and Runetune actually put out a big thread here. So go check that out at Runertune. And you can just see Runetune's in depth assessment of the AI work at MoMA.
00:10:57.274 - 00:11:27.674, Speaker A: And we're going to talk about that also in next week's spaces, if everything goes according to plan. I'm looking to see if doctor version can show up too. Roon tune is checking anyways, so check that out. And I just thought this was kind of interesting. Jerry Saltz's take on the. I didn't see this, but Runtoon linked to it in his thread. And so this was from February 22, so I guess a month and a half ago moments glorified lava lamp.
00:11:27.674 - 00:12:15.434, Speaker A: So a pretty brutal assessment. Refic. Anadol's unsupervised is a crowd pleasing, like generating mediocrity by Jerry Saltz so not pulling any punches here at the work. And I kind of had my own skepticism when I saw it at first. I thought, you know, the works we see with AI, I think I said at the time when this came out, like, why not? Strange thing with that, you know, the masterpiece thug lord, I'd rather just see thug Lord was one of my sort of. Or like, you know, I feel like there's so many great works, but then people actually went to the show and they're like, actually, it's phenomenal. Someone mentioned on a Twitter spaces, the previous Twitter spaces.
00:12:15.434 - 00:12:42.696, Speaker A: But so anyways, it's interesting just to hear these different views on this work. Clearly it's creating conversation and a little bit of controversy. So maybe that's the happy ending to all that. So we're going to discuss that next spaces next Wednesday, hopefully, if everything goes according to plan. Thank you for the comments, demon ego. So we're looking at the end of last episode at the physical works by demon ego, which are stunning. Made in notebooks.
00:12:42.696 - 00:12:53.640, Speaker A: Right? And so it has this horizontal composition. Thank you, Adrian. Happy to see my works all in real life. Works of mine are in collage books. Very interesting. Some kind of notebooks. Yes.
00:12:53.640 - 00:13:57.794, Speaker A: And I want the scanner marks, dark areas around the edges and the drawings, glue marks, paints and folds on the previous next pages to appear in the background of the new work. So interesting. Right. And I think the more, the more you're kind of using the technology of, say, the scanner and of getting the background, the more it does become a new work, you know, because if you just did a pure representation, just a clean scan, and then it starts to be like, is this just a pure, you know, it brings up the whole debate of the physical NFT, which we had very early on in this show, and, you know, how collectible is that? But because it has all this other stuff, it does become a new work. And the more of that kind of stuff you keep, drawings, glue marks, paints and folds, the more I think it does become a new work. I don't want to have a clean, sterile final image while creating my works. The real world parts and process being visible add more richness every time.
00:13:57.794 - 00:14:14.484, Speaker A: I totally agree. And shout out, gogolitis. Mannitol is very talented. It's my first nFt collected on Solana. I agree. I haven't picked up an NFT on Solana, maybe ever. But I had a couple of Saul just waiting for that and I had to pick up the cat supper.
00:14:14.484 - 00:14:51.634, Speaker A: And also thank you, Santiago. Great comment there. Thank you Rada and Edmorola, aka Edward Eduardo Pulitzer. It's straight out of mid journey, so we're going to look at that work one more time because we were discussing how Ed probably had used mid journey as a reference for a work, and it turns out that we were right here. And shout out to Stalka and to moda Mt. It's just so awesome to hear from everybody and Debbie T. Thank you so much for featuring my work in the journal on your journal Pokebelly.
00:14:51.634 - 00:15:20.613, Speaker A: It's always such an honor to be a part of your episode. And for anyone wondering, those glyphs definitely have meaning. So they do. And it's funny, looking from a distance here, I realized when I was looking at the thumbnail yesterday, I thought, oh, this is just like an illuminated manuscript. That seems to be some of the inspiration here. And sometimes they'll put that huge capital letter classically in these illuminated manuscripts. So apparently the glyphs have meaningful.
00:15:20.613 - 00:15:59.904, Speaker A: So that's interesting, too. So anyways, great to hear that and shout out, Mister Shapeless. Thank you for the comment. So anyways, we're all having a lot of fun over here. Teganhof had a really interesting comment and I just kind of want to open the conversation, and we don't need to say too much about it here today, but I think it's kind of a worthwhile discussion. Which are these texts that you often find in the gallery or museum, the entertainment level of the talks we're referencing. So we're talking about art talks and how sometimes it can be really kind of abstract and obscure.
00:15:59.904 - 00:16:22.332, Speaker A: Thank you, Adrian, for being practical and pragmatic. You're welcome. And continuing from Teganhoff here, the entertainment level of artist talks probably depends on the artist and interviewer and. Absolutely. And, you know, huge generalizations here. I've been to amazing ones. Of course, what I often find incomprehensible are the exhibition texts.
00:16:22.332 - 00:17:01.008, Speaker A: And this is particularly true of, say, contemporary art. I think it's actually improved in the last three or four years. But yeah, in the museum, I take the paper for Einfach Sprache, if available, and that's basically plain language. In Germany, my girlfriend's actually an expert in this whole subject matter. In Germany, they have, you know, what's called Einfalch sprache, or plain language texts often accompany, because not everybody can read super technical stuff. So Tienhof is saying takes the Teigenhoff, takes the plain language version for the tour. The other text I read at home.
00:17:01.008 - 00:17:19.243, Speaker A: If at all. Yeah, if at all. Exactly. So anyways, just kind of, I just want to open that up as an interesting subject, you know, glitch beyond binary. So they have redone the show. It has been curated. I think we have it here in the next tweet.
00:17:19.243 - 00:17:50.256, Speaker A: Next by Donia, who is also known as let's glitch it, and Dina chang. So I guess they got rid of the last guy as they highlight the diverse artist communities that make up glitch art. He's probably still working there and everything. Who knows? I don't know. So anyways, and here, and we'll go back to the Sotheby's page in a second. But here is Donia Darkstone. And so anyways, you can come here and read all about it.
00:17:50.256 - 00:18:13.392, Speaker A: Here's Dina Chang. And here's a work by Ina Vare, who I think we just started showing on this show, if I'm not mistaken, you know, Sky Goodman. So they've added people space. Case is excited there. So here it is. I thought it quite a smart title, actually. But beyond binary, the glitch between zero and one, and, of course, many meanings there.
00:18:13.392 - 00:18:38.468, Speaker A: Rosa Mankman. So this is someone who is very prominent. I'm not an expert in glitch, so I leave it to people that know more than I do on this. But anyways, here is a quick look at some of the names and the new people. So they kept a lot of, if not everything, or at least a lot of what was there before. And it seems like they just added a whole bunch. So Donia Darkstone.
00:18:38.468 - 00:18:57.844, Speaker A: So you see, neurocolor was there before. There's uxine and more. So King Xerox Sabato, wasn't that great. I'm thrilled to see Sabato there. That's cool. Neurocolor in Avare. So you see, it's a much larger group here.
00:18:57.844 - 00:19:16.368, Speaker A: Bongdo Xerox, empress. Trash has been added. Crash blossom, who I never heard of. So anyways, these could be very famous people within the scene. Marta Timur. So anyways, we continue to learn here. And here we saw the tweet from Sotheby's metaverse.
00:19:16.368 - 00:19:47.758, Speaker A: So righting the wrongs. And here is Rosa Mankman. And so this is from 2000 920 ten, which is another kind of debate we sometimes have had here, whether minting old works, is there something less collectible about it? I think it's fine. The more I think about it, especially if it's a digital work. Now, interestingly, look at this. So I wasn't actually quite sure what to make of this. Like, so I guess it's not a canvas, but it is on stretcher bars.
00:19:47.758 - 00:20:07.254, Speaker A: So I wasn't quite sure because it looks pretty good, right? So I'm just kind of curious. It's an NFT. And here, print, jpeg. Gicle print. A gicle print. That is super interesting. 101 by 77 cm.
00:20:07.254 - 00:20:26.974, Speaker A: This work is unique aside. Is unique aside, one artist's proof. So there's one artist proof. And then there's this work, which is a unique. So a one of one nft here. So I guess if you buy it, you get both, which is interesting. So always interesting to see the mechanics here.
00:20:26.974 - 00:20:57.804, Speaker A: Continuing on in avari. So interesting work here. So probably, of course, using some sort of glitch technique, seamless looping, Gif showcases in a various expertise in combining analog photography, raw digital video footage, and glitch techniques. And Sabato, let's just put this. I dreamed that I was somewhere all too familiar. That almost looks like deluxe paint a little bit. I wouldn't be surprised.
00:20:57.804 - 00:21:20.404, Speaker A: And so I think Sabato put out a tweet that he was working overtime to get this thing done because he probably had a pretty tight deadline. And so it looks like this is where Sabato started. Really cool series. I can't seem to recall the person, however. Nice glitching. Beautiful glitching here. Beautiful textures.
00:21:20.404 - 00:21:36.314, Speaker A: So pretty cool work by Sabato. Origin story. Kind of poetic. And here's euxine. Let me just minimize that. So kind of seems like slightly more saturated colors here. Cheers.
00:21:36.314 - 00:21:53.454, Speaker A: And really cool work. And I just love the painterliness of all this stuff on the side. That's where my eye was drawn to, was all. I just love this noise. Awesomely done. Again. It just feels like paint drops, right? Feels like paint drops.
00:21:53.454 - 00:22:15.154, Speaker A: So that's just great. Continuing Empress trash, human rights. And this is a one of one mp4. So purely digital. Let me just see. I didn't see anything. The artist synthesis of AI and video editing editing techniques breathes new life into the imagery.
00:22:15.154 - 00:22:35.350, Speaker A: So interesting. So maybe a little bit of AI here from Empress trash. So pretty cool. And continuing on, John Cates, another prominent glitch artist. I thought I'd just throw in here. Good evening out in AI glitch western, y'all. So it seemed to kind of fit with everything.
00:22:35.350 - 00:23:04.750, Speaker A: So this kind of looks like analog film. You see it on the side here, these kind of, for the spool here. That's what it looks like to me. So anyways, and this looks like a kind of like a western southwest, you know, not grand canyon, but some sort of, you know, cowboy western image here, landscape. So cool work from John Cates, also out there in the larger world. Sasha Styles. Good morning, New York City.
00:23:04.750 - 00:23:30.448, Speaker A: Conceptual, semi asemic AI poetry. So it's AI, interestingly, on a billboard in Times Square. Finding it hard to believe this. Thank you, art crush, and Matthew France, for your ongoing Matthew France, for your ongoing support and everything you do. Looks really good, doesn't it? And I would never have guessed that it was AI. It's almost like asymmetric writing. Might even work better as AI.
00:23:30.448 - 00:24:29.202, Speaker A: Like. That's beautiful, isn't it? Nice color, too, the green on the black. And continuing on, I thought this was an interesting solution for displays. We talk about the awkwardness of tvs all the time, and I thought this was a pretty smart solution, which is you make the work as big as you can, and then with the negative space, instead of leaving like a big black rectangle, let's say, on top and below, instead, you put some nice text, you put the QR code and everything. I thought it was kind of just an interesting solution to a tough problem because, you know, it's hard to make projectors for all of this. Again, I'd be tempted to, is what I, you know, you make a slideshow and then you just have one big projector, but who knows what the like. There could be a lot of technical challenges here, and maybe some people prefer this.
00:24:29.202 - 00:24:57.368, Speaker A: And again, you can keep the lights on full blast and everything. So anyways, I just thought I'd never seen that solution employed because, you see, these are different, like, ratios, so it kind of solved it without having to crop your image. Interesting. So Ed Marolla left a comment. This is the mid journey output. So remember, if we can find the work, this work here, we're speculating. This looks like mid journey was the source.
00:24:57.368 - 00:25:26.644, Speaker A: And sure enough, this is the mid journey output. So you see here the three people. So kind of a window a little bit into Ed's tracing process. This looks great, too, these outputs. So I'm kind of 120% with Ed in kind of using AI as a source, a compositional tool. It works wonderfully because look at all this. Just interesting things you can put together, you know, even these stripes.
00:25:26.644 - 00:25:45.818, Speaker A: It's like you can just interpret this. And again, tracing, I love it. And then all of a sudden, you have an original work. And so now, interestingly, I was looking. I looked for a good ten minutes to find myth maker of the 20th century JG Ballard's essay on William Burroughs. Right. It's in this book.
00:25:45.818 - 00:26:18.234, Speaker A: I may have to get the Kindle now, the Kindle version for us. Now, I found an earlier essay on JGballard, CA, which actually has a lot of essays. Burroughs reviewed by Ballard, terminal documents. But this isn't the essay that I have in mind. And the essay I have in mind is much more analytical as far as everything that Burrows is doing. This is also analytical, but more just in terms of looking at the narrative. But this is what I want to highlight in the context of what Ed's doing and what I was discussing the other day.
00:26:18.234 - 00:26:56.842, Speaker A: The language of the present, the visual language of the present. So this is Ballard talking about Burroughs writing. Whatever his reservations about the mid 20th century, Burrows accepts that it can be fully described only in terms of its own language, its own idioms and verbal lore. So this is a very important concept. And that's kind of what I see going on here with Ed. Ed is taking, you know, a trope that only exists now, you know, this mid journey, four square thing, you know, and is using it as a subject matter. So that is what I.
00:26:56.842 - 00:27:51.734, Speaker A: Why I wanted to find that essay. And I'm gonna find, I may have to buy it, that book in kindle so that I can show it here. But, you know, Burroughs shows that it can be fully described only in terms of its own language, its own idioms and verbal lore. So an art of the present, as we've said many times here, axin with just a cool work on Twitter, and you see a GM coming out of the printer again, with what I'm tempted to call, like a bit of a Warholian technique, where you put the layer of black on the top. You give a whole bunch of different treatments here, in the sense is what seems to be going on here, not positive of image, and kind of different bitmap izations, different filtering, however you want to put it. And then, I'm sure, treated, and who knows what he's doing. And a GM coming up, and then a layer of black on top.
00:27:51.734 - 00:28:28.164, Speaker A: And then it just all kind of holds together, and you get all this wonderful kind of edges here and everything kind of textures, which seems to be a reoccurring theme here. And if you listen to the hasdrubal waffle, I'd wait till I edit it, but you can listen to it now on Twitter. It's pinned up there. Hasdrubal was obsessed with texture, interestingly. And, you know, so, and we see in Hasdrubal's work, we have one coming up, this. How important this kind of digital texture idea, you know, is basically what I'm trying to say here. So this happened yesterday.
00:28:28.164 - 00:28:55.682, Speaker A: And I thought this was also a very interesting work. This is brolket. And we've looked at one of Brulkett's works in the past, and I thought it was just kind of a cool work, minted a few days ago. Nice piece. And brolket, of course, did this work here, this kind of choose work, which you might remember from maybe a month ago. And so selling the work, I think all of these have been sold. So that is cool.
00:28:55.682 - 00:29:13.210, Speaker A: Let's just see what happened here. It was minted, but I don't see owner the edge. Minted by the edge. So I'm not exactly sure actually what happened here. Maybe that's the same person. I'm not sure. Anyway, Francoise Gamma.
00:29:13.210 - 00:29:33.708, Speaker A: I'm tempted to think this is older work because it kind of reminded me of the older work that Francoise minted on foundation the other day, I think from 2006. Anyways, I thought this was a beautiful work. This is on Instagram. Just kind of cool. Look at that. So, yeah, very nice. And here is a minted version.
00:29:33.708 - 00:29:50.304, Speaker A: Kind of reminds you of the momo work. And we looked at a color version of this yesterday. So here's a black and white version. This has been minted. Pretty cool. I think I almost like it more than the momo work here. Looks great.
00:29:50.304 - 00:30:13.340, Speaker A: So anyways, continuing with the, you know, the person walking theme motif, exmortal. So just a few more kind of glitch works here. So just some nice looking, I guess you'd call it noise. Noise study by exmortal. Here's another one. Just kind of nice. I like these noise studies.
00:30:13.340 - 00:30:26.878, Speaker A: It's a great title. Let's just see what they're selling for here. 15 tezos. Very reasonable. And I'm sure there are. Here they all are. So several, I think a really smart strategy because collectors love.
00:30:26.878 - 00:30:49.682, Speaker A: There's something about the one of one which you really just are tempted to buy. And if you had made something like, okay, simple noise studies editions of 20, I'm not sure they would fly out the door. Just as simple noise studies. But you make them one of one and they're flying out the door. There's only one look. It's all sold out. This one's going now for 350 on secondary.
00:30:49.682 - 00:31:25.672, Speaker A: So if you're trying to move work, make it a one of one is not a bad idea, is one of the lessons there. Here's Klaus with a cool work. Let's just load this up. So more kinda, I think you could call this glitch and a video art and these beautiful errors here in here. And just kind of an abstract work here. These triangles, real time generative graphics made in quartz composer. It's fed through analog video hardware like Panasonic, ederal, Sony, tachyons.
00:31:25.672 - 00:31:47.534, Speaker A: So I don't think we looked at this yesterday. Maybe we. Or on Tuesday, I think this came out the other day. We may have looked at one that was similar, though. Kurt hustle collective with some skateboarding turtles. This one was quite beautiful, I thought, with the galaxy and just space in the background. And we have a turtle on a skateboard with a UFO going through it, edition of ten.
00:31:47.534 - 00:32:10.774, Speaker A: And this is already sold out on primary for seven tezos each to many familiar faces here. Here's another one. This is still available. Sober turtles, Stanley Shell. So more a daytime look with almost what looks like the devil there from the puppet pioneers. So interesting. Sober turtle, Stanley Shell.
00:32:10.774 - 00:33:13.584, Speaker A: And here's turtle hustle. This looks like Kurt Hussle with the eyepatch here and a cigarette and the piece of hay going through the landscape here. And here's another kind of work, also by Kurt Hussle collective, that was released right before alai master video compositor artificial intelligence module, brought to you by Kurt Hussle Collective. Looks like a photo of a screen, doesn't it, the way that the texture is here of this image. Interesting solution to add interest to the image, this is available for one Tazos 97 edition of 97 human kernel with a new work, war underwater. And this looks like it's using one of those JavaScript tools that I believe Santiago was it waffle draws that Santiago made. And shout out to Santiago for joining us on the spaces.
00:33:13.584 - 00:33:36.640, Speaker A: It was the first time, from what I understand, that Santiago and Hasdrubal waffle actually talked in person. And I think they've been in communication for months and months, and it was the first time that they had actually talked on that spaces yesterday. So that was awesome. Anyways, here's one by human kernel waffles draw. Yeah. Okay, so there you go. So anyways, interesting work.
00:33:36.640 - 00:34:04.152, Speaker A: War underwater. And here, this was actually sent to me by Hasdrubal waffle right before the show. So thank you for the gift and shout out to Hasdrubal waffle. I sent one to Rune tune. He actually sent me three copies of this beautiful work here. And, you know, we learned an absolute ton of how hasdrubal works, and we'll go into that. But sometimes there's like one layer, one undo, like there's a lot of limitations.
00:34:04.152 - 00:34:29.274, Speaker A: Another interesting thing that Hasdrubal said yesterday, he releases like 15% of his work, so there's a ton that's unreleased as well. So. And he's just kind of doodling. He's just kind of doodling. And I thought to myself, in an indirect way, it kind of has a basque feel, because I didn't put that together beforehand. But once I saw it and it's like, yeah, it's just someone writing. It's doodling.
00:34:29.274 - 00:34:54.120, Speaker A: Right? And that's almost what Basque was doing. So, interesting bootleg. Cool title too. Yuri J. Little houses at the seaside so this also came out yesterday. So a cool work with a piano. Again, similar to how we see with human kernel and his dribble waffle, where each area is treated differently here.
00:34:54.120 - 00:35:14.928, Speaker A: This wall is treated a certain way, the floor is treated a certain way. We always have that kind of, for lack of better term, awkward space, kind of malformed perspective. A forced perspective, almost. With Urij. Anyways, nice composition. A square piece and with a windmill. And this looks like a window of sorts here.
00:35:14.928 - 00:35:41.604, Speaker A: Looking off to a windmill, little houses at the seaside. And edition of 15 and just minted. And Santiago with a really cool work. This may have been sent to me. And yeah, this was also April 12. Name eight things and forget them. Poster and ticket for an event in a hypothetical metaverse made of cork cardboard and thought in the year 23 33.
00:35:41.604 - 00:36:10.898, Speaker A: So pretty cool. It does kind of look like a concert poster with text at the bottom and image on top. Anyway, very interesting piece. Thank you. Santiago. An nzfs who I'm tempted to think is Santiago and I never know, but it kind of has a Santiago feel to it, doesn't it? So, Fuente Abril 2023 anyway, nice piece here. Seemed to hang very well with Santiago.
00:36:10.898 - 00:36:21.682, Speaker A: And here's another one by nzfs. And it may be someone just completely different. I don't know. Puente. And so anyways, some interesting works. I don't. Maybe we looked at this one before.
00:36:21.682 - 00:36:45.758, Speaker A: So this is April 5, here is April 10. So this also seemed to kind of fit a bit of a miro Juan miro feel to it. Postcard by Moonsun diamond. And kind of a nice piece here with interesting textured background and everything. It's a taxi. That is great. So this is, you know, interesting solution.
00:36:45.758 - 00:37:12.152, Speaker A: The yellow of the taxi bleeds into the whole composition. And so this is representational work. So anyways, interesting piece here. Moonsun diamond, Kristen roose with a new piece here. And again using retro tools. Trademark raster bar cuboid. This work combines vertical raster bars and color cycling techniques associated with the history of personal computers and video computer systems.
00:37:12.152 - 00:37:36.532, Speaker A: Fourth one of one on Tezos blockchain. Let's just see Kristen. Yeah. Listed for 777 and sold 4 hours later to stateless. So yeah, Kristin Rus is doing very well and has a really strong collector base. Here's another one by Kristin Rus. Interweave weaving draft interwoven with color cycling.
00:37:36.532 - 00:37:58.140, Speaker A: And so interesting color cycling here. Not much to say about it, just a study. And again, using retro tools and everything. So nice work from Kristen Rus. Plants open two des microdexts. So this is of course Kapton's. I think we call it a pseudonym.
00:37:58.140 - 00:38:19.354, Speaker A: Found in the depths of a lysergic dream by Captain Hayes. And using a similar style. Again, colors are in movement and then contrasted with black and white. That's static here. I really like this. You know, I'm big fan has ruble was mentioning this yesterday of how loose works. You know, being really loose with the drawing and whatever.
00:38:19.354 - 00:38:44.870, Speaker A: That stuff tends to sell right away, but works, you really work on getting kind of perfect that doesn't have as much of a market, which was really interesting thing to say. And I kind of echo the feeling though, because look at this. This seems kind of loose, this frame here. And it looks great. So interesting, isn't it? Another work by plants. Really interesting work here. And kind of a low resolution.
00:38:44.870 - 00:39:10.624, Speaker A: And almost going to a much earlier series that Kapn had worked on. If you go to some of Kapman's really older work, you almost see these kind of Picasso esque works that look kind of like they're very horizontal. I picked up a few of them. They're like editions of five. Anyways, returning to that theme here with a whole bunch of plants. Indr Garden. And here's one by stippin pixel.
00:39:10.624 - 00:39:27.224, Speaker A: Frozen breath for refuge. So just cool pixel artwork by stippin pixel. Very unique pixel artist here. Interesting. I like the simplicity and the colors too. Just two colors. Here's a cool work by Tito.
00:39:27.224 - 00:39:47.914, Speaker A: Some nice drawings here. This is only a Tezos 50 edition of eight. Two left. Might have to pick that up. So anyways, cool work by Tito. Just a really nice illustration here. The snake coming out of a skull almost looks like he man or skeletor type armor here.
00:39:47.914 - 00:40:04.480, Speaker A: So anyways, interesting work. And of course Ezra Eslin with order. And it's kind of funny. Again, sometimes I'm slow to the draw here. I thought, oh, this is just a normal still life. And then I saw the knife with the blood. But anyways, really cool.
00:40:04.480 - 00:40:28.256, Speaker A: I love the perspective. Like the composition, it's kind of like this overhead composition. And it's just kind of about the hands, but it's also about food and about the chopsticks and then adding kind of trademark. Ezra Eslin. A little bit of drama here with a knife and blood eating sushi. So very, very cool. So this is an artist that I think is new.
00:40:28.256 - 00:40:47.392, Speaker A: Jajang std jiazhengst. And so thought we'd show this. So anyways, cool work here. And this is notice tolands on foundation father and beginner in NFTs. I love naughty, weird shapes. Enjoy. Come to papa.
00:40:47.392 - 00:41:12.764, Speaker A: Okay, so here is the first one by Jajang Std Jajangst. Let's call it Jajangst. Here's another artist that I just kind of came across on twitter. Portrait of Lydia. You know, speaking of bhuboy. Kind of a Picasso feel to it, isn't there? But much flatter and interesting texture. You know, to go back to that texture theme in the background.
00:41:12.764 - 00:41:41.216, Speaker A: So this was minted March 24. And is there a reserve? There's no reserve on it. So here's will AK, indonesian self taught artist who's inspired by super flat art fiction and the real life as a fiction with absurdity around it. And so anyways, interesting illustrator here. Quite a bit of work actually. This one's super rare out of Indonesia. And here is a work by mental noise.
00:41:41.216 - 00:42:02.624, Speaker A: A cool kind of rabbit phone booth with some coke. So anyways, coke sign. A nice illustration here with some cool graffiti. Very cool. And colors here on the ground. So what is this called? Six societies. So anyway, edition of 50 for 495 on secondary.
00:42:02.624 - 00:42:27.620, Speaker A: So this sold out for three tezos on primary. It looks like it went pretty quick too. Or transferred a lot and then sold out within a couple hours from the looks of it. 3 hours. And so anyway, sum reusi with a work soulmate and a poem. So nice to see new work from sum. I like how sum is returning to the carpet subject.
00:42:27.620 - 00:42:53.924, Speaker A: I think it's a really cool motif and almost looking like a combination of photography and, you know, digital painting here. Interesting cutout here. So it looks like drop shadow put on top. So anyways, smoking a cigarette. Interesting work here. And this is an edition of eleven and I think this might have just been minted. And already two have gone for ten tazos.
00:42:53.924 - 00:43:20.400, Speaker A: So interesting. And geek doing a little bit of Dante from the looks of it. El Purgatorio. So 2000 by 3000 in autodesk sketchbook and we are almost done here. And so anyways, a nice take on Purgatorio. So going up and I guess heaven is on top. And so, yeah, I guess I'm not sure where purgatory is.
00:43:20.400 - 00:43:44.820, Speaker A: Maybe that's here where these people are carrying things. And then maybe here, I'm guessing, is the division between purgatory and maybe paradise. I'm not sure I should find that out. Flora Marquez with some more cool work. The color is coming along, this new pink added to the mix here. Everything will be fine considering the circumstances. Still available for 20 tezos.
00:43:44.820 - 00:44:05.768, Speaker A: And here's another one. Still available for 20 tezos. I feel ready for new challenges. So more cool work from Flora Marquez Bidala with a couple of really cool, kind of illustrative AI works. April birds number one, available for 850. I'm pretty sure this is AI. I actually may be wrong on that digital painting illustration.
00:44:05.768 - 00:44:27.414, Speaker A: Maybe this is just an illustration. I thought it was AI, but I may not be. This might just be illustration. Anyway, here is Aprilbird's number one and April birds number two. Yeah, no mention of AI here, so probably just an illustration. Anyway, it looks great, doesn't it? Edition of 15 for 850. This is AI.
00:44:27.414 - 00:44:49.994, Speaker A: And this looks like straight out of a 1970s art book, doesn't it? This is by leprochant Laburnius head as his dog. Fisu by leprochant AI painting stable diffusion. Pretty impressive. This looks straight out of an art book from the seventies or something. So that is pretty cool. I love the color. Again, it feels like a faded print, you know, art book.
00:44:49.994 - 00:45:16.012, Speaker A: This gorgeous work. A language of emotions by Marina Amadova. Beautiful, beautiful work. Kind of crystallizing, I'd say a lot of things that Marina has been working on. This work, like sometimes a work just really hits and captures the essence of what you seem to be trying to do as an artist. And I just feel like this is one of those works. I mean, Marina might feel otherwise and, you know, but that's just how I see it.
00:45:16.012 - 00:45:35.688, Speaker A: I feel like whatever Marina has been trying to do, the twins and everything, this one just really hits. So anyway, I just think, beautiful. It almost seems like two works put together. This background is super interesting. You know how it divides up. It all works beautifully. And this was turned into a poster only 0.13
00:45:35.688 - 00:45:54.744, Speaker A: ETH reserve for this gorgeous work. And here you see it's part of a digital gallery based in New York, the lower draw digital gallery. Obscura maybe is the name of the show a language of emotions. NFt New York City so maybe a part of NFt New York City. Congrats on that. This looks great. Absolutely great.
00:45:54.744 - 00:46:13.472, Speaker A: I almost started with that. Above and beyond. The artwork expresses one's pursuit to explore oneself by surpassing their limits. So here's an AI work by Etkin, an artist I'd never seen before. So I thought, kind of interesting. I thought the rainbow and just everything about this was just kind of interesting. So nice work from Etkin.
00:46:13.472 - 00:46:40.820, Speaker A: This is an open edition available for one tezos each. And here's Etkin's other work. So a photographer and. Yeah, so anyways, a lot of AI work, kind of reminiscent of delta sauce. A little bit in the feeling and color here in some of them. This definitely has its own feeling too. So anyways, cool work and strange thing, kind of pushing the content a little bit now, tackling basketball with this super cool work.
00:46:40.820 - 00:47:09.534, Speaker A: And you can tell we've been looking at strange things for a long time. So embracing again the AI distortions here in the shoes, which really do create their own aesthetic sense. And you see it in the basket here, which is kind of screwed up but very charming. So really cool work from strange thing. NB four or NBA. The four being an a NFT on sale for 24 hours with super chief and foundation. Check story for link.
00:47:09.534 - 00:47:41.232, Speaker A: So very cool. And here's some more strange thing. And I want to show this because look at how photographic this is becoming here. So an upgrade to the 1630 Milan vapor mask from a previous post. So if we have another pandemic, maybe you want a mask like that. Very good looking vapor mask. And finally, one bit horror in the real world, someone has a one bit horror t shirt, one bit fan Williams sporting the cursed t shirt out and about.
00:47:41.232 - 00:47:56.264, Speaker A: Hopefully consumption fills the void where God should be. So a dark statement from the ever mysterious one bit necro, also known as one bit horror Instagram. And that is your show, everyone. Thank you for joining me once again. Until next time, take care.
