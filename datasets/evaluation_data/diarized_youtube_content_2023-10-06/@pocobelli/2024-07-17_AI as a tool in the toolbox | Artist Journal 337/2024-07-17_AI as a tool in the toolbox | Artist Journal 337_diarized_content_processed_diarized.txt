00:00:05.960 - 00:00:18.010, Speaker A: Blades, camera, action. Scotch tape, duct tape, scissors. Lee Perry. Terrence McKenna. JG Ballard. Welcome back. Artist Journal, July 17, 2024.
00:00:18.010 - 00:00:43.964, Speaker A: Broadcasting everywhere from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Focabelli. Welcome back. And here we are. Let me zoom in here. This is not typical fair for the COVID of the newspaper of the imagination. Not because of the bona fides of the artists.
00:00:43.964 - 00:01:17.628, Speaker A: Bona fides, bonafides. It is because of. It's kind of hard to see, that's why. And as people are walking by on the sidewalk, passing the. The newsstand, so to speak, you kind of want something big, powerful in the sense of colorful and everything. But there are times for exceptions and die with the most likes, you know, one of the most prolific, consistent artists in this entire. In the entire digital art space.
00:01:17.628 - 00:02:03.326, Speaker A: And of course, I only really track what's on, I guess, X and Instagram, you know, that's kind of my main fodder. And then whatever else I happen to pass across on the web, which is not as, you know, who goes to websites anymore to a certain degree, I guess you go to object. I go to object still. But, you know, it's like you go to x, you go to these platforms. In a sense, object is a platform. Video is consuming everything, isn't it? I mean, how do you consume your news? I mean, how often are you going to read the article? We're off topic here just a little bit. But I'll just say again, this is not typical fair, but when we zoom in, we kind of get a closer look.
00:02:03.326 - 00:03:03.370, Speaker A: So die with the most likes again, I'd say one of the greats, frankly, of the what's. I think we could loosely call the crypto art scene. Right? I mean, die with the most likes, I would say, kind of walks a beautiful tightrope where, in a sense, he has 1ft, I would say in, you know, in kind of the deep crypto art scene, and 1ft where he just does whatever the heck he wants and it's all his. It's not like he puts pepe on every single work. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but, you know what I'm saying. It's not like there's an ethereum logo everywhere once in a while for satirical reasons. And this is a very important point, as we try and understand what is going on in this work, is, I think we could call die with the most likes a satirist of a sort, you know, in the tradition of Jonathan Swift, William Burroughs, maybe, especially in its harshness.
00:03:03.370 - 00:03:46.420, Speaker A: Let's take a look at, uh, let's first take a look at this work. Then we'll bring up, actually, uh, die with the most likes, uh, Twitter, not my notifications, but let's just do a quick search here on Dai with the most likes. Toad. I never understood toad Swebak. I've never understood that. It's probably something obvious to everybody else. We'll bring this up in a, we'll look at this in a second because it's important to kind of get a sense of how much work is not minted, since this is on Ethereum.
00:03:46.420 - 00:04:26.920, Speaker A: Sold for a lot of money, by the way. Vincent van Doe, I mean, minted. Die with the most likes on July 15. So two days ago, purchased for eleven ETH and 60 911.69 eth by Vincent van Doe, the same day. Kind of a weird, you know, I thought at first I was really impressed, and I still am, but I thought kind of a weird first bid, to be perfectly frank. I mean, but maybe Vincent Van Doe, a patron of the arts, particularly of the crypto arts scene, we could say maybe Vincent Van Doe, it's a kind of patron, so to speak.
00:04:26.920 - 00:05:02.814, Speaker A: You know, giving patronage to all the work that die with the most likes. Does that is not sold. And again, remember, again, seeing this, and for those that don't know, I mean, Ethereum, what is it at? Let's just guess at 3300. I mean, we're talking like $37,000 for this digital artwork here. Major sale coats we once wore by die with the most likes. So let's look at the work. So here it is on art of this millennium, which, again, is what I'd be tempted to call, as far as I understand it.
00:05:02.814 - 00:05:26.170, Speaker A: Was it, say, I was going to say a crypto art platform. Art of this millennium is a global gallery specializing in contemporary digital art. And from just, yeah, I'd say it's got a very, you know, I'd be tempted to call it. And they don't like the capital c, the crypto artists. But I was going to say a capital c crypto art out here. Although again, with die with the most likes. Who's to say this is just maybe we just call it digital art.
00:05:26.170 - 00:05:59.170, Speaker A: So coats we once wore. And let's look at this little write up, because I think it gives us a clue as to this. Kind of hard to understand, hard to see, at least on this screen here, work. We went to the bar where Vonnegut wrote slaughterhouse five. And this is a very important part of die with the most likes work is the writing. There's constantly this kind of very edgy satirical writing which kind of never lets up. And watched an 80 year old in a slipknot shirt.
00:05:59.170 - 00:06:27.100, Speaker A: Warm frozen patties on electric grill. And a man read a newspaper from two days ago and wondered where the moon got so full or where our coats got so heavy. So pretty, actually obscure. And here it is a little larger. So let's see if we can discern a little bit. Kind of a classic dye with the most likes imagery would be these kind of frames in the background you see here. It's hard to tell if there's screens or photos that are being hung.
00:06:27.100 - 00:06:55.466, Speaker A: Right. Hanged, I guess. And so that is in the background, kind of these highlights of what maybe is this bar. And then you have these. And you get this great contrast here, too, between, say, these frames in the background that move. And then these still figures here. And again, I always think of Kappen, you know, who will kind of animate half the pixel artwork, and then half of it will be static, which makes a beautiful contrast.
00:06:55.466 - 00:07:45.040, Speaker A: You see it here, right? The contrast between the movement and the still frame. It kind of adds a kind of poetic weight, I would be tempted to say to the figures here, as we can see, almost like drooling eyes kind of, you know. You know, basically blotted out, you know, even the cheeks, everything, you know, so. And even the. Almost like the sweating. Is that sweat? Is that some sort of skin issue that these figures have? And here it kind of looks like a burger, right? Or something in this kind of barbecue. But really, we see these kind of spaces, these heads, almost like a cannibalism of a certain kind.
00:07:45.040 - 00:08:12.930, Speaker A: We see another kind of move here with this kind of older figure. Again, the rosy cheeks, like. Almost like a clown. And then these little figures, if you can see that just in here, almost coming from the tears, so to speak. Or are those the nerves, you know, the optic nerves of. And here seems to be just a regular taco. But even here, you could argue there are figures hidden in.
00:08:12.930 - 00:08:47.478, Speaker A: And this beautifully kind of one off. You know, in a sense, die with the most likes deserves a lot of credit for his line drawings. He has a very nice line, doesn't he? And again, after you see, we've all seen who are paying attention to this scene, have seen hundreds of works by die with the most likes. It seems like there's, like, two or three a day, the guys. And last I heard, I don't know anymore. Last I heard, maybe a year or two ago, he was still working a full time job, amazingly. So you really have to.
00:08:47.478 - 00:09:11.424, Speaker A: It kind of reminds me of axin, who I believe also works a full time job. And, you know, they're able to. I marvel at that because I feel like I am always just struggling to get to my computer, iPad, iPhone and make some work. So. And this show should be shorter. Let's hope so. As long as I don't wax too long here on this work.
00:09:11.424 - 00:09:48.340, Speaker A: But there's other things to see. So this seems to be a grill. It's ambiguous. And you see here, the hands actually seem like they are cut off. They look like they are on the grill with maybe a video camera here and here outpouring the blood. And here on the barbecue is really what looks like suburbia. You know, maybe one of the great subjects that die is, you know, portraying here, and interestingly, even like, the power lines you would find, and I think die of the most likes, if I'm not mistaken, is out of the midwestern us.
00:09:48.340 - 00:10:39.508, Speaker A: So even these power lines that you'll find along the freeways of these, you know, this isn't New York City, where you're going to find these power lines. But I grew up in Saskatchewan, midwest of Canada. And, yeah, this is not an uncommon sight. You know, power lines from the 1950s, probably strung across the landscape here. And here they are what, across what seems to be a barbecue. And I only say it's a barbecue because of the write up, which mentioned a barbecue. So, again, blotting out the eyes here, beautiful color and beautiful combination of movement and stillness, dynamism and staticness, we might say, in static lines and even the rendition of suburbia here.
00:10:39.508 - 00:11:25.450, Speaker A: And, of course, beef being arguably the main subject matter, or at least the one we attribute to die with the most likes. More than anything, this kind of ground beef obsession, one could say almost these houses here in this kind of suburban looking street almost seem as if they're portrayed as meat, which wouldn't shock me at all. And they're, you know, these chopped off hands photographing it in all its splendor. So quite a work, isn't it? Let's look at the title one more time with all that in mind. Coats we once wore, pretty ambiguous. Our coats got so heavy, you know, so pretty powerful, pretty interesting. Pretty beautiful.
00:11:25.450 - 00:11:53.918, Speaker A: So big. Congrats to die with the most likes and Vincent van do for that work. Now, I did want to just show, because it's very important to understand this artist, to see the X or Twitter profile, die with the most likes. Create nothing, consume everything. Legalize beef. The lips and holes of a generation non award winning energy drink die with the most likes places we used to go. So.
00:11:53.918 - 00:12:23.570, Speaker A: And of course, you know, here, you know, again, does it again July 11. Now, is this even minted anywhere? Right? And of course, makes physical work. Right. I think we saw this one the other day, actually, in the show in the physical art section. And here again, kind of, you know, very topical, a modern day satire. We see these like, tablets with like chopped off hands. We see the lights that you use if you are recording.
00:12:23.570 - 00:12:58.520, Speaker A: Right? A lot of the youtubers have these kind of lights. I have one of these lights which I use if the. If it's at night, you know. And so an interesting move here, actually, on the faces. But this is just an example of like a pretty nice artwork, right? Even the color and the black and white contrasting does not minted, you know, kind of rarely mints. And I think of AhEC, Joshua Sobel, where he was saying, you know, don't flood your market. It's not necessarily in your interest to over mint.
00:12:58.520 - 00:13:37.350, Speaker A: Maybe this is a good example of what AHEC is saying, because they're die with the most likes, collecting a cool, you know, annual salary for his work. And as you can see, pretty rough stuff. But, you know, as anybody who's kind of very Burrough, frankly, very William Burroughs. And there is the artist, and it looks like a collaboration here. Not sure entirely, and doing a ton of physical work. And again, you know, the squiggles, which we've seen, turning it into ground beef here. And of course, the squiggles were looking at the market like a week ago, two weeks ago.
00:13:37.350 - 00:14:04.314, Speaker A: Right here is the pepe. I guess he was doing the pepe, but as ground beef and the flies. Right? I think started on tezos, interestingly, and kind of makes fun of the spam that he gets, I assume. And super rare bought. Look at this. And this sold to Vincent Van Doe July 16 for $22,000. So, I mean, I never even saw this one.
00:14:04.314 - 00:14:22.670, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this is new or not. Shall we look very quickly, but we have another hour cut off here. I think we're going to make it, though. When was this minted? It's always kind of hard. Here we go. Activity. This was minted back August 2, 2022.
00:14:22.670 - 00:14:47.326, Speaker A: And 22,000. So, okay, so that is a secondary sale. Vincent van do cancelled the auction, made an offer. Accepted bid. Okay, so not exactly sure what happened here with the cancelled, but all to say, this just sold for $22,000. So pretty impressive now. Yeah.
00:14:47.326 - 00:15:16.838, Speaker A: So let's just leave it there. So die with the most likes. Again, almost everybody who pays attention to this scene is familiar with and yeah, just again, doesn't mint a ton. Should probably be featured more on this show. Like, it's totally a. It truly was, is an oversight and we have shown actually quite a lot of die with the most likes work, but deserves more attention, frankly, but has no shortage of attention at the same time. Let's continue here.
00:15:16.838 - 00:15:32.860, Speaker A: Tuna kuna, regular Jake. Yo, I'm pumped for this. Gonna be on the spaces today. Try and make it if you can. Lots of new stuff to talk about. So do check it out. I'm going to try and upload it before so people before the space so people have time to see this.
00:15:32.860 - 00:15:56.404, Speaker A: I'm very excited about this. One of the great collectors on Tezos and I'm just curious as heck to hear what Tunakuna, also known as regular Jake, is going to say. So come join us. And what's this? Okay, so that's something different. Okay, so awesome. Quick look at the comments here. I changed the title after Yuri J was after Yuri J's comment.
00:15:56.404 - 00:16:07.556, Speaker A: We'll see you in a second. GM Adrian, beautiful selection as always. Rada. Awesome to hear from you. Rada, as ever. Thank you for the comment. And I believe that is it for the comments on YouTube.
00:16:07.556 - 00:16:24.836, Speaker A: And here we go to X. John Cates, GM. Awesome to hear from you. Great western glitch artist Philip Francocci. Thank you so much for featuring my work, Adrian. The piece you showed is a collage of a physical drawing and AI outputs based on my work. Fascinating.
00:16:24.836 - 00:16:56.432, Speaker A: With the black and white part being made up of me being made up of manipulated mid journey outputs. So again, I remember that comment from last show where it's like, you better mint before AI comes, and nobody's gonna know what's. I'm not sure. It just shows like, this is how artists, I would argue a lot of artists are using AI. They're using it as. It's kind of like Uri J using the effects. Like, it's kind of like an effect of a sort, to a certain degree.
00:16:56.432 - 00:17:17.756, Speaker A: Just the effect is, it's like a tool. AI is a tool in the toolbox, but it's not like the, you know, I think people sometimes run away with and then we're never going to have to have artists again because, you know, and as, and so we'll continue this discussion. Thank you. Filippo Francocci. Fascinating. Really interesting in regard to our discussion. Retro.
00:17:17.756 - 00:17:39.292, Speaker A: Manny, awesome. Coffee ready. Finally get. Get to get a bit of downtime to enjoy an episode on its actual release date. Yeah, I'm trying to get back to the regular kind of schedule here. As you imagine, this is a one person show out here. So I always appreciate the patience of this crowd if I don't put out a show or it's late and everything.
00:17:39.292 - 00:18:27.328, Speaker A: So awesome to hear retro Manny little cakes. On the topic of the artsy article. The cost of running a physical gallery and selling physical works is astronomical. Not just the rent, but the crating, the shipping, the storage and so much more. It's amazing that any gallery can make it, even if they are regularly selling work. Completely agree. And I suspect, little cakes, this is becoming truer and truer in a world where it's almost becoming like there was even stories I think we saw maybe a month or two ago, maybe two months ago, where some blue chip galleries were looking to collaborate with smaller galleries, because the business for smaller galleries is basically dead, so to speak, or non existent.
00:18:27.328 - 00:19:05.530, Speaker A: So I think this is becoming truer and truer. And what does that mean if you're an artist, if you're not in that kind of top 3% of already at Cogosian? And, you know, I'm looking at some of the Gagosian, like, I'm even wondering if things are going to start to crater there. That's what I wonder to myself. And actually, we have stories on this coming up. All to say, I think this digital space continues to be a wonderful, attractive place. Keep building before the masses come is still my mantra here as far as how I see this space. Like, I don't know why everybody's not here.
00:19:05.530 - 00:19:24.970, Speaker A: I really don't. $100, I think they don't know about it. I think it's that simple. I think if you know. So again, I'm kind of back to what I said last episode. Enjoy the fact this is small, because it may not be small forever. And I've been saying that for a couple of years now, and I just think we're fortunate.
00:19:24.970 - 00:19:51.014, Speaker A: Let's continue chromevoid, because it's not so small that nobody's. That we're not making money. If you put out work, most people are selling, even if it's for a few bucks here and there, which is kind of very good for the soul as an artist, to actually just get a couple of bucks here and there, you start to put your mind to work. Let's continue Chromevoid. FYI, this is the wonderful cider Flower work is a collab based on nice day jewels flower project. So thank you so much, chromevoid. For mentioning this.
00:19:51.014 - 00:20:29.122, Speaker A: I miss this. And actually I have the openc here. So we're going to come back to this in a few tabs here where we're going to look at this project specifically because I didn't realize it was a collaboration between cider and nice day jewels. We'll go deeper in this in a few tabs. Has dribble waffle still is a good intro for sure. A hip classmate made me a cassette closer on one side and Debaser closer by Joy division closer on one side still is a good intro for sure. A hip classmate made me a cassette closer on one side by Joy Division and debaser by pixies on the other.
00:20:29.122 - 00:20:50.018, Speaker A: Understood pixies. Joy division was a very slow burn until much later. Very true. Joy division is an acquired taste. But once you kind of acquire that taste, it becomes you never let it go. It's like riding a bike. Like you never unsee it, you know, or unhear it.
00:20:50.018 - 00:21:12.940, Speaker A: Bendigging surgeon I believe the techno artist. I actually listened to a mix after this comment by surgeon for deliveries lately, for what it's worth. So a famous, famous techno artist again on some of Jeff Mill's early mixes there from the nineties. Oh, and Nintendo 64. Mario artist on the sink project. Okay, so n 64. So waffles.
00:21:12.940 - 00:21:39.962, Speaker A: Unafraid of trying any software and just doing what what waffles can with it. So thank you for the comment. And as I was saying, actually to waffles, Joy Division, a very slow burn. I remember the second day I was ever in Berlin. This is true. And I ended up at Burgain by, you know, I hadn't even heard of Burguyne, even though I was very familiar with techno. But I didn't know that was the, you know, world's kind of most famous club at the time.
00:21:39.962 - 00:21:51.474, Speaker A: And surgeon was playing. And that is true. And I think that was the moment I decided to move to Berlin. And that is a true story. No hygiene. Awesome to hear from you, Cuompa. Awesome to hear from you too.
00:21:51.474 - 00:22:20.434, Speaker A: Thank you everybody for the comments. Comments quick look at the community here. Biviki GM posting a sky Goodman work collab between Marcel Mancianu and Olga Fedorova. GLB digital sculpture fashion bliss so very cool. Fascinating. Someone almost wearing tvs, you know, why haven't we seen more of that on the Runway? I wonder to myself as I see that very cool. Texadelic.
00:22:20.434 - 00:22:42.414, Speaker A: I think we saw this last episode and there it is. Awesome. Celebrating us, celebrating everyone here. Thank you. Texadelic 69 ghosts, another interesting, kind of strange, almost video game esque, pixel art abstract, post human fairy tales work series. Fascinating. And simulacro.
00:22:42.414 - 00:23:09.570, Speaker A: Here's our newest piece. We're very happy with it because we're getting to rehearse about the body and its limits. Simulacru's work always looks like it belongs in some sort of institution or something. Very cool from Simulacru and Chris war. A new chapter is coming for audio visual experiences on Tazos, so more from Chris war. Very interesting with a beautiful glitch here. And finally Rosatio from my early collection on Opensea.
00:23:09.570 - 00:23:24.050, Speaker A: Thank you rosatio, for posting. Look how beautiful that is, the color. And 69 ghosts, us in the mirror. And Juan Pez, the new collection on object.com. so very cool. Physical there. And Ariel, we have this work.
00:23:24.050 - 00:23:38.870, Speaker A: Zhu Ziliang, thank you for posting. Very interesting work as ever. There's a robot dog underneath texadelic and Austin. And we saw this last episode. Thank you everybody for posting. And just some comments. Yuri J.
00:23:38.870 - 00:24:12.590, Speaker A: Who made this work here, who we started with last episode. Thank you, Adrian, for your words. Outlines of our lives probably will go to my bio. Yeah, I actually changed the title of the YouTube to this after you wrote that. Hilariously, it was too late to change it here. Evolution of a process is fine too, but I thought YouTube's probably going to be around longer than people finding the videos on x, so I figured maybe I'll switch it over to that. I did this little digital study in just 1 hour as a little gift on Santiago's three year hicket nunc or Han birthday.
00:24:12.590 - 00:24:48.430, Speaker A: And here's a bit of the process of variations that were mixed to make a tree. So here is this landscape. So almost like an impressionist here, en plein air, or at least using a photo for reference. Look how kind of vertical this photo is. And then you see everything that goes into the tree. These look like all the layers here, or at least the process of getting the layers, I mean, so, and here is a bit of the process of variations that were mixed to make a tree. Now, as you can see here, this is the tree.
00:24:48.430 - 00:25:08.538, Speaker A: Oh, wow. So these were also. So I was saying this is kind of a weird tree, right? This is a weird tree because it's kind of got this really big trunk. But really what's going on is it's being repeated. And there's a virtue in working fast. There really is. You can really, because you don't have your.
00:25:08.538 - 00:25:39.830, Speaker A: I'd argue your rational mind isn't stopping you from taking risks, and you just have to do what works. And what's amazing about doing just putting in stuff almost randomly and fast is how much works. That is one of the shocking, weird things of being an artist that you realize is how much works. So, you know, so very interesting. Thank you, yuri, for the posts there and for the comment. This is hilarious from Santiago. If Uri J.
00:25:39.830 - 00:26:14.330, Speaker A: Didn't exist, could you make a yuri J with AI? So the question from last episode in regard to AI, and oh, no, you better make art before AI comes because nobody will be able to tell what's real and what's not. And, yeah, and, you know, I talk a lot here. I don't remember everything I say. I was glad Santiago highlighted this because I actually think it's a powerful point I was making. If yuri J didn't exist, could you make a yuri j with AI? Interesting question. And I think, actually didn't yuri, I thought, and actually, it's somewhere buried here. Just for the record.
00:26:14.330 - 00:26:28.112, Speaker A: For the record, yuri j replied, and the answer is no. The answer is no. So fascinating. Thank you for posting that. Very interesting. Brain dead. I admit that this one is a bit confusing yet.
00:26:28.112 - 00:26:54.410, Speaker A: Thanks, dadrin, for diving deeper into my purgatory room collection day by day. And, yeah, forgive me, sometimes I just have to go through these, you know, fast enough to not know. So I can't give it, you know, the full treatment. Currently, I'm working with the fifth piece, and soon it's gonna be minted exclusively on super rare is my ethereum genesis. And by the way, that is a crib right here. Okay, so thank you for letting me know. Fascinating, kind of surreal pixel art here.
00:26:54.410 - 00:27:18.532, Speaker A: And we're going to see actually, braindead actually bringing in 0.33 eth on that genesis. So very impressive. Okay, so here is the flowers project. FYI, the wonderful cider work is a collab based on nice day jewels flower project. And so I brought it up here. So this is nice day Jules, who I think is a prominent collector as well.
00:27:18.532 - 00:27:39.192, Speaker A: It's 51 of one photographs from nice day jewels. Each flower dynamically reacts to the ebbs and flows of Ethereum in real time. So kind of on chain art. Interesting. So the glitches respond to the Ethereum data, I think is what's going on here. And cider seems to have remixed all of these works. And thank you.
00:27:39.192 - 00:28:04.268, Speaker A: And we heard from Jules. Thank you, CV Chromevoid, for the shout out here. Very cool to see cider flowers highlighted here. And here is the thread. And it's too long to go through here, but let me just show you. Back to flowers began in January 2020. As a daily practice, I sought to rediscover my creative voice, which had faded after a decade of client work, or working, let's say, in the corporate world.
00:28:04.268 - 00:28:35.640, Speaker A: Woke up every morning before my nine to five, drove to the flower depot, picked a flower that spoke to me most, shot it on my lunch break. Rinse, repeat, experiment. 100 days later, my voice was coming back. So very cool. So here it is. So you can read all about it or hit pause on your video if you want to read the whole thing. The flowers project was my first venture on the blockchain, a body of work I promised to continue to pay homage to.
00:28:35.640 - 00:29:04.238, Speaker A: So it's two years since the mint and the next step in the project. So now cider has remixed some. There's maybe going to be other versions. So long live crypto art, long live flowers. So jewels with this project here, look at the floor. Two and a half. Ethan, so congrats to nice day Jules on that work.
00:29:04.238 - 00:29:23.892, Speaker A: Margot eath GM artists and collectors. So I hadn't seen this, at least not for a while. And I kind of, again, there's so much going on in this space, it's easy to miss. I'm thrilled to be featuring Mikhail Knowlsson on NFT art Discovery. So this is a website. We're gonna bring it up in a second. Definitely an artist to keep an eye on within the solana community and has been doing fabulously on the Solana community.
00:29:23.892 - 00:29:48.774, Speaker A: Of course, Mikhail Knowleson, one of two people, along with Chi Moscow Jackson, who actually encouraged video on this show when it was still a Spotify experiment. So big props to them. And here's the website, NFT art discovery. It's quite nice. Latest discoveries. Mikhail Knowlson and a whole, you know, right up here were actually interesting. So not too much of a write up.
00:29:48.774 - 00:30:18.618, Speaker A: And then you hit links and then it just takes you. I actually really like that because who's going to read, you know, three pages, four pages? I don't know, anybody. If you think of your friends, like, or are you? And so this is brilliant. Just a couple of paragraphs. And then here are the links. Smart format, if you ask me. So, okay, so this was posted by Alain surveillance, who, again, I love the Twitter feed.
00:30:18.618 - 00:30:58.492, Speaker A: And we were looking at the brain the other day in response to psilocybin. I wanted to highlight this because there's something very interesting here. Scientists reveal a fascinating neurocognitive trait linked to heightened creativity this is on Scipost. And again, tweeted or posted by alliance surveill. And there was, and I had it highlighted here a second ago. And where is it now? Let me, it's this idea that creative people respond. Here it is.
00:30:58.492 - 00:31:38.102, Speaker A: In other words, creative people might. Here it is, Gross told Cypost. So gross, being one of the researchers, I believe here it is. Our study found that creative individuals do not perceive unusual information as odd. They process it similar to typical information. And this is a very interesting tidbit here, because, like, when I think of visual art, I like to call myself radically unsnobby in terms of what I consider art. I feel like a billboard can truly be more profound and more beautiful and powerful than something that's put in a gallery.
00:31:38.102 - 00:32:07.090, Speaker A: Just because you put it in a white cube, so to speak, does not necessarily infuse it with some sort of special magical property. In a sense it does, but this is an illusion, is where I'm going. You can find graphic design, and in a sense, this is kind of, I'd say what Warhol did. He took popular imagery, transformed it as we were discussing a couple of shows ago, and voila. Right. So I just wanted to highlight this. Our study found that creative individuals do not perceive unusual information as odd.
00:32:07.090 - 00:32:31.764, Speaker A: They process it similarly to typical information. So they don't start categorizing things too quickly. They just kind of accept it. Very, very, very interesting. Let's continue. And I thought this quote of John Cage by lone Wick actually fit perfectly with what we're discussing. So John Cage, the famous composer who used randomness, prepared piano.
00:32:31.764 - 00:32:58.230, Speaker A: Wherever we are, what we hear is mostly noise. When we ignore it, it disturbs us. When we listen to it, we find it fascinating. Kind of another take on what we were just discussing. Instead of being, oh, this is not typical information noise. We need to get rid of it. It's all just data that we're just kind of looking at, kind of objectively, so to speak, and not unassumingly, perhaps.
00:32:58.230 - 00:33:47.064, Speaker A: So. Interesting quote there from lone Wick. We have another one coming up. Lsurveyed the art market confidence indicator this month hit its lowest point in four years despite a sense of optimism earlier in the year. Confidence levels have been dampened by lower sales in the global art market during the first half of 2024, stifling any signs of recovery. And anybody who was optimistic on the contemporary art market earlier this year I think was clearly deluding themselves. It was very clear that the appetite is not there for the contemporary art market and spending huge amounts of money on, you know, you know, debatable pieces, shall we say? Or edgy, shall we say.
00:33:47.064 - 00:34:11.566, Speaker A: So alliance survey weighing in on that. And also another post by alliance survey. Another great link here, one of my favorite Twitter accounts, or x accounts. Alliance survey. This is on Art News. Christie's auction sales down 22% in the first half of 2024. So again, more signs.
00:34:11.566 - 00:34:33.730, Speaker A: Again, I keep calling this a liquidity market. If it's a Warhol, it does fine. If it's kind of more on the fringes, as you see in the stock market, then it starts to have more financial liquidity issues, so to speak. It's not as easy to get in and out of. It's not so. And therefore it doesn't do as well. It becomes a less attractive investment.
00:34:33.730 - 00:35:07.664, Speaker A: Christie's, the world's largest, largest auction house, reported Tuesday that it generated $2.1 billion in live and online sales in the first half of 2024, a figure that represents a 22% drop from the same period last year. I'd say still not bad, but not huge, actually. I thought, at first, I thought, wow, that's a lot. But you know what? That's not huge, considering, you know, some of these. And that was last year in the middle, like, I mean, when was the bear market? 2022 to 2023. I mean, so this is down from last year.
00:35:07.664 - 00:35:24.920, Speaker A: Do we have 2022? The figure was already down 23% from 3.5 billion generated in the same period in 2022. You see? So we're almost down by half. Since 2022. We're at 2.1. Pretty interesting, Dan. Control.
00:35:24.920 - 00:35:41.982, Speaker A: I don't care about the low market, the little money, the small influx of buyers. Long live. Creating and exhibiting in a serious way. I will do it as long as I can. Beautifully put, Dan. I couldn't agree with you more. I just couldn't agree with you more.
00:35:41.982 - 00:36:15.990, Speaker A: If I earned some money every now and then, I wouldn't mind. I mean, this is exactly how I feel about it. And if you can earn a lot, even better. But it's sort of like, the point is, if you're an artist, you just love to do your practice and you love to put it out there, and money is great, but time is your ultimate judge, and you may not be here, you know, to witness. I was just at an exhibition the other day, and it was someone very famous. What exhibition was I at? Oh, it was Caspar David Friedrich Friedrich. Caspar David Friedrich.
00:36:15.990 - 00:36:39.880, Speaker A: Big exhibition here in Berlin. Famous, you know, romantic painter center. Compositions remind me of William Blake. Interestingly, another romantic and died poor. And I don't mean to laugh, right, but I mean to the point, you know, like. But was David Caspar, David Friedrich, you know, and the king, I think. I can't remember the king there.
00:36:39.880 - 00:36:57.266, Speaker A: It was Frederick the great, I think, bought a few of his works. So it's not like he always did badly, but had a stroke. So maybe, you know, and this wasn't. Wasn't the time of Social Security, okay. Or workers compensation or anything like that. So. So Caspar David Friedrich.
00:36:57.266 - 00:37:21.370, Speaker A: But does he have any regrets looking back? Were his angel or his soul to look back? Probably not. Probably not. But who's to say? But all to say, I completely agree with Dan control walk. Who, of course, I follow the great walk. That is a glitch on x. When you load up a billion tabs, words collection actually sold out. So.
00:37:21.370 - 00:37:36.014, Speaker A: And look at this. For 0.01 eth, you know, so what is that? $30, I guess. Is that right? $30. So. And how many here? 24524? No, 2600 bucks. Beautiful works and people getting deals.
00:37:36.014 - 00:37:56.624, Speaker A: Because I think you get the physical, too. I mean, is that right? Maybe you pay extra for the physical. Not sure, but just awesome. Beautiful. And again, remember we were talking about Christopher Wool? We were looking at Christopher Wool's work last week, you know, almost no line break with the text. Kind of a similar idea here. Cider.
00:37:56.624 - 00:38:19.620, Speaker A: One day, all my collectors will have signed prints. That's my dream. At the beginning, it was hard to manage that, but it looks like it will become reality. So, cider continuing to make progress, it sounds like, on the physicals, very important. Very, very important. Lone wick. I'm constantly amazed by the power of stepping away from a project and returning in a different state.
00:38:19.620 - 00:38:42.836, Speaker A: The break can be an hour, a day, a week, or longer. Much of the creative outcome is directly affected by what I eat, quality of sleep, and even just how recently I've eaten or slept. At one moment, the task is like trudging through mud. The next moment is zero effort for the same task. Luckily, these tend to flip from difficulty to easy within 24 hours. Very interesting. It all rings true to me.
00:38:42.836 - 00:39:20.470, Speaker A: And the good news is, if you're having difficulty, it can flip right back to easy before you know it. My sort of take on this is if you haven't made work for a while, or if you're kind of hit a block and you feel like you can't make another masterpiece in your own mind, what I say is, don't worry about what you make the first day. Just make work. And if it's terrible, that's fine. And if you keep doing that, what you're going to find is usually the second day it starts to look a little bit better and you start to be kind of encouraged. That's looking better. And by the third day, you're like, off to the races and you feel like you've got a whole new work thing and masterpieces are coming down the pipeline.
00:39:20.470 - 00:39:51.104, Speaker A: So it's an interesting thing. My general sense of this is we're much better than we think. We tend to undermine our own abilities. And I'm constantly kind of surprised when I'm working and in the heat of, of how many great things will come out, at least things that I think are great as an artist. So grounds for optimism, really. Unknown collector. With everything that has happened, we still have a core community we need to speed up here, creating, showcasing, collecting and talking about art and web3.
00:39:51.104 - 00:40:05.674, Speaker A: So many things in crypto and NFts have disappeared over the years. Projects, community types. So much came and vanished again. But we are still here because we care. This is not something that can be taken away from us by falling crypto prices. Exactly. Kind of back to Dan Control's point here.
00:40:05.674 - 00:40:46.264, Speaker A: Lack of outside interest or fewer collectors. The foundation of this web3 art scene exists because it needs to exist, driven by the need to love art together beyond everything else. In a sense, the momentum's there, so it's hard to stop now. So also a rare token. So super rare, of course, the famous platform, one of the pioneers in the whole space, considering this is by super rare perkins. So I think one of the people at super rare introducing rare, the ethereum l two for art. So a proposal for the dao to turn the rare token into a L2 for art.
00:40:46.264 - 00:41:19.232, Speaker A: Very good idea, if you ask me. We were kind of discussing this maybe a month or two ago, how there should be an art blockchain. And even if you can start making, you know, put everything on chain, can you get rid of international or interplanetary file service like I would love, if you can just put everything. I don't know why they don't build that. Maybe it's a technical issue. Artie hands, how do you get ETH off base in less than a week? So, of course, L2s are not the be all, end all you. Yeah, they're orbiter finance.
00:41:19.232 - 00:41:33.440, Speaker A: A lot of people use this. And actually, that's if you're on Zora as well. If you're trying to get your eth right away, it doesn't work for me. Anyways, that's what I did. Do your own due diligence on all of that stuff, though. Stalka, who, of course I follow GM. Guys, it's been a minute.
00:41:33.440 - 00:41:48.466, Speaker A: I'm working back. So awesome to see Stalker again. Back on the scene. Cool work. Just an awesome illustrator of what I'd call contemporary illustration, especially this work here with the video camera and the figure. Just kind of awesome. Can't wait to see stalka.
00:41:48.466 - 00:42:20.908, Speaker A: So as we move into the pieces here, Dan control, I have what you need. So I didn't see, maybe we touched on this before, but these colored stripes are a very interesting addition here in this very graphic exhibition. More meat here. Here we see pigs heads with this beautiful kind of lavender side. We see meat with a kind of this minimal, you know, background here. Just the stripe and the head. I mean, it's.
00:42:20.908 - 00:42:41.840, Speaker A: It's kind of horrifying. It's probably supposed to be. And then this deep red, very powerful by Dan control. And here's another work from that exhibition. Just a simple matte black background. And you see here things that, you know, if you ever go to a butcher shop, you will see, or even the grocery store auctions starting under 0.1 upside down.
00:42:41.840 - 00:43:17.836, Speaker A: So this is from the meat collection that we've been looking at in the last few days here. Here's waffles, also known as kujeb, with some new sinks. So these are made on Nintendo 64. So, and these gorgeous clouds here that we're looking at here with a pink sky and some tape over top. It looks like, you know, this is copy and pasted maybe from the Internet, and then kind of processed, you know, transformed. We could say, here's a heaven and there's a star for you. So more goodness from.
00:43:17.836 - 00:43:33.836, Speaker A: Look at that hilarious outline from Kujib. Sync zero seven. We sync twelve. I'll let the viewers read that. And again, one of these beautiful kind of cloud skies. And here we see another face here. And classic kind of waffles works.
00:43:33.836 - 00:43:50.162, Speaker A: Kind of looks pasted in from that other work that we saw. And thank you. Waffles actually sent me, actually, a work that we're looking at the other day, thrillingly. Thank you for that. Sync eleven. Here's a popsicle. So this kind of, again, looks like a combination of stuff.
00:43:50.162 - 00:44:05.972, Speaker A: Like, it looks like a Nintendo 64. You can paste in work from other softwares or at least do a copy and paste. Right. There's, again, the clouds in the background. So kind of like a profile picture project to a certain degree. Cinco nine. And here's another one.
00:44:05.972 - 00:44:31.514, Speaker A: And again, you see the clouds in the background, different colors and the tears and everything. So just very interesting. And settling for only twelve tazos. Good deal. $10 for a hastrubal waffle, one of one Euxine make. So here, interesting work here has the hat and then some brush strokes coming out of it, but almost suggesting the head. Very nice painterly work from Euxine.
00:44:31.514 - 00:44:53.030, Speaker A: And we have some more. Look at this. And this is details. And of course, I follow the great Euxine here. Look at how cool this is when you look up close. Very pixelated, isn't it? We have some other works, so still kind of pixelated, interestingly. I mean, and here's some mushrooms, kind of a fuzzier outline on this one.
00:44:53.030 - 00:45:22.054, Speaker A: And then you have almost like these hoses going into the mushrooms. Anyways, just fascinating work from uxine. Here's one more kind of looking. I think maybe we looked at this one already. Not sure. And looking like the body being sent into the flames or the skeleton minus the jaw. Interestingly, as ever, an interesting framing device here with the matte black in the background and around, almost a passepartout of sorts, digital passepartout ornamental hermit.
00:45:22.054 - 00:45:41.602, Speaker A: So here is gloom tube. Still on the scene. Awesomely. This, for whatever reason, this reminds me of the Picassos on the beach, the surreal phase of Picasso's career. Kind of like the pinks and. Or actually the kind of the beach colors and the pinks and everything. So here's gloom on the beach with this.
00:45:41.602 - 00:46:15.414, Speaker A: Looks like kind of a hand or a crab coming out of a Del Monte or something. Some kind of monster coming out of a Del Monte. You know, sweet peas, aluminum cans. Kind of a wild one here from gloom tube ornamental hermit edition of 100, selling for aptezos 50 and still available, by the way. 69 still available. And here's a one of one for 250 tezos and bug out. And here, just hilarious, but more satire, really.
00:46:15.414 - 00:46:44.596, Speaker A: Here's Raytheon, the weapons manufacturer, with what looks like a huge kind of cockroach or beetle on top with gloom there. So, of course, bugs, death raytheon. Interesting work. And what is this in the background? It's almost like a plane, like, or something with the sky and everything. So more satyr, in a sense. You could do a show of the satirists in this scene. Here's Yuri.
00:46:44.596 - 00:47:02.018, Speaker A: J just a casual kitchen. Not sure if we've seen this one before. I don't recall it. So again, eerie. J at work here, with all the wonderfulness the outlines of our lives, as we say out here. So very cool work. Here's Pamela Cerrone on object.
00:47:02.018 - 00:47:25.790, Speaker A: DJ Pam. Really thrilled to see Pamela Cerrone back on the scene. And just the energy and dynamism of the work is just really great to see the originality, the prolificness. Edition of five for 420. Just great to see Pamela there, just minted. Here is Katarina create lost somewhere. Edition of ten for three tezos.
00:47:25.790 - 00:47:47.090, Speaker A: So again here, all animated, all across all the lines. Interesting. Kind of almost a fishbowl kind of frame here and here. Flowers growing around it. So just cool work. This could almost be like on a ceramic or something, the way it's presented. Maybe, you know, we're back to the physicals.
00:47:47.090 - 00:48:13.520, Speaker A: Who was it that I was looking at, who was doing sculptures? And it was just like, so impressive. I don't know if it was die with the most likes or someone else may have been die with the most likes. But again, imagine Katarina create makes a ceramic, for example, you know, starts putting, was showing, has some physical works on the instagram page. I. Very interesting. Okay, we gotta run. Mumble boy, eat in.
00:48:13.520 - 00:48:39.840, Speaker A: So, of course, eating in rather than eating out. And here, more mumble boy, just collage here, beautiful piece. Edition of one for twelve tezos. Again putting out almost a piece every day. Here's a collaboration between mumble boy in Santiago. A robot turtle drives away as everyone wonders, where's the piece? Interesting use of negative space here. Very interesting.
00:48:39.840 - 00:48:56.968, Speaker A: And there's a figure here that mumble boy does here. It seems like a bit of. Look at this. Look at Santiago's wild kind of vector abstract. Who knows? I know not what. Just beautiful work. Here's another super minimal work by Santiago.
00:48:56.968 - 00:49:12.090, Speaker A: I don't know if we looked at this one. I find these minimal works weirdly powerful. And I feel like, unless it's my screen, there's a little bit of a gradient coming across here. Very interesting work. Very, very interesting work. That's Santiago. Here's R.
00:49:12.090 - 00:49:30.190, Speaker A: Presti Estrato. I think this was in the community. Thank you for posting. Awesome work. And a pixel art abstract here, a pixel art kandinsky of sorts. Very cool edition of four for seven tazos, just minted. And here, the wonderful zuozo, also prolific, prolific golden hour.
00:49:30.190 - 00:50:03.078, Speaker A: Let's just wonderful digital goodness here. Just a small kind of clip. Beautiful pinks. And there's the plant. Super interesting art that sold for 30 tezos ozo on a roll. Bringing in real money. If you're making even 30 tezos a day, that's real money if you're getting it consistently.
00:50:03.078 - 00:50:17.990, Speaker A: Kind of like Nev 1914. That's real money. Here's Sui soichi Raisa, a junior. Very interesting portrait. Kind of like video game esque, but more like. But you know, like it's kind of retro monitor, but more. Very nice.
00:50:17.990 - 00:50:36.720, Speaker A: Here's another one, Suizoichi. Kids are not alright. Version one, Ragnarok. Online editing. Just very, very interesting digital textures. Here's Kappen lost and found by Kapn. This is on rodeo, which is, I think, kind of foundations equivalent to Zora, where I think it's kind of free mints and everything.
00:50:36.720 - 00:50:57.834, Speaker A: I'm not totally sure on that. So putting out kind of like something from Kappn's gift shop. And there's foundation on the. That's very cool. I like that on the three and a half inch floppy disk, of course, I follow cap in there. And here's Rakuin, a pixel artist on Instagram. Very interesting.
00:50:57.834 - 00:51:15.634, Speaker A: They could make a fortune, I think, on the blockchain, but I'm not sure if they post there. I haven't seen them ever on the blockchain. Here is. And here it is. Here's purgatory, room five by braindead. So the genesis mint on super rare. And so here it is.
00:51:15.634 - 00:51:45.586, Speaker A: And again, very cool. Just a lot going on. These two pigeons kind of flying into each other the time the pixel art machine. So really taking things like what a year Braindead has had, right? I mean, remember the hospital issue, the broken jaw? And then now selling for $1,200. The first work on super rare. Look how good the super rare sites looking, by the way. So bid here, 0.33
00:51:45.586 - 00:52:00.528, Speaker A: eth. So very nice. Now this is super fascinating. I was even tempted to start with this. This is rip cash. Now you say, oh, okay, it's some rip cash is kind of boiled down to two colors. Bitcoin is a swarm.
00:52:00.528 - 00:52:32.002, Speaker A: Okay, interesting. But for me, this is super fascinating because it brings up the whole issue of remixing. Anybody that's kind of really spent a lot of time with digital art, I would argue, has run into this thing where you see like there could be a million different variations of this. You can change the colors here. It's a very nice kind of orange, deep orange and gray. This could be green and yellow, this could be black and white. This could be whatever.
00:52:32.002 - 00:52:58.540, Speaker A: Again, very screen printable. It's like a one layer screen print where you paint underneath and then you screen print or you do one color and then, I mean colored paper, whatever. You like, this is. And again, it's put it this way, like, say, like, I see. And it's like, I've thought the same thing. Let's say, you know, you make a synth, and it's like, you know what? Every digital art make could be a thousand other artworks quite easily without too much work. You put some rastering.
00:52:58.540 - 00:53:20.208, Speaker A: You know, you put some bitmapping, whatever. This is very interesting. So props to ripcache for posting this, because maybe that's the revolution. It's not that. Like, we. If you've worked in digital art, you've seen a million versions of your work that you can make. It's actually posting it and going because, yeah, so, to me, this was incredibly.
00:53:20.208 - 00:53:40.846, Speaker A: This was kind of, like, to a certain degree, that was the headline in my head today. But, yeah, so very, very, very interesting. From ripcash, kind of a casual tweet. Bitcoin is a swarm element ly object. So kind of a different direction. The last few works from element lis. So it's gonna be really interesting to see what they do.
00:53:40.846 - 00:53:59.422, Speaker A: It looks like four or five colors. Daily art. So continuing to put out work every day. Here is a beautiful work by manital. And I think this is just manital by themselves. Let's watch the sunset together with the cat. Almost making reference to the old video cameras with the text over here.
00:53:59.422 - 00:54:15.220, Speaker A: And this beautiful, very charming work of the cat at sunset. And we even see a little bit of a glitch on the left there. Brilliant. 77 dezo cents, practically free here. This was on the front page. Object. Nice work in curating from object this morning.
00:54:15.220 - 00:54:29.196, Speaker A: Losing game Shigarov. Very nice. Followed this artist press start. Very cool. Just very, very interesting artwork here. New discovery. When your own shadow strikes farther than the shadow of the tree.
00:54:29.196 - 00:54:49.504, Speaker A: This is demon ego edition of Tanzan. So new work by demon ego again, combining physical digital collage, painting, everything, and even animation. Ten tezos and three gone so far. Congrats to demon ego. Here's Kyle Flemmer. And I really want to keep this under an hour. Look at how beautiful this is.
00:54:49.504 - 00:55:02.816, Speaker A: The hamburglar dream. Big, fantastic works. Work from Kyle Flemmer. Just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Edition of ten, 1690s, sold out. You know, you want to sell work. Makes a McDonald's work $3.50.
00:55:02.816 - 00:55:20.248, Speaker A: Very reasonable price, by the way. And, of course, the work itself ultimately sells that work. Beautiful. Da nyris Expo 4% tentezos edition of ten. Very interesting. Very, very interesting. Beautiful kind of glitch here, Nikita.
00:55:20.248 - 00:55:39.046, Speaker A: This is called wrath. Just an interesting digital artwork here. See some rasterizing in here as the lightning kind of color from the lightning shimmers through the whole work here. Interesting. Another kind of digital passepartout of sorts here. And another super interesting, Lena Eckhart. Look at this.
00:55:39.046 - 00:56:02.126, Speaker A: Digital radical. Really cool animated abstract from Lena Acart. Very nice. How much is this edition of ten? Five tezos. Have any sold? None sold yet. You can always just burn it down to one and probably sell it for like 30, 40, 50 drinking. Here's another one that is on Instagram.
00:56:02.126 - 00:56:17.734, Speaker A: Interesting combination of digital. Looks like a figure there. Here is Vitek visuals with another animated abstract. This is on Instagram. Continuing on, acidboy GM, y'all. New full week of creativity. So acidboy on the scene here.
00:56:17.734 - 00:56:39.074, Speaker A: A little preview of what might come. And continuing on, here's Renki with another. Always keeping it fresh here. Interesting crop, interesting black background here. Kind of, you know, similar to that dan control. We're seeing that kind of two color background, minimal background. Very interesting.
00:56:39.074 - 00:56:56.356, Speaker A: You see these spheres kind of move across the screen. Always fascinating from Reinke. Here is x mortal with a beautiful landscape here. So glitch art landscape. Loving the nature works. Here's also exmortal. Beautiful landscape here.
00:56:56.356 - 00:57:08.412, Speaker A: Look at that sun, wonderful textures here. Warm sand at night. Edition of ten. I think this sold out. So a very selective market. Hey, it's either sold out or nothing, practically. Here's Max capacity.
00:57:08.412 - 00:57:29.186, Speaker A: Another artist that frankly hasn't gotten enough attention on this program. Just another oversight which I'm trying to fix here. N 1010 edition of 60. This came out in June. Sold out of. So another really interesting analog video glitch artist. And here is Klaus, composition 157.
00:57:29.186 - 00:57:43.898, Speaker A: So this is an older one, actually. Maybe we've seen this one because I think we're well past 200 now, so. Indeed we are. So that popped up in the feed. So very cool. Yeah, we're at 242 from Klaus. Amazing.
00:57:43.898 - 00:58:10.090, Speaker A: Here is Salawaki, episode two, the president. So this. Just giving a little clip here. Looking, referencing the debate seemingly. And again, always looks this also like simulacro. Looks like it belongs in an institution. It's pretty cool.
00:58:10.090 - 00:58:27.860, Speaker A: I mean, it looks and feels like contemporary art, doesn't it? So very cool work. Open edition, only a tezos, 50. How many have sold? 45. Nice work. 82, actually. Some people buying more than one. Here's Stefan Deibas.
00:58:27.860 - 00:58:42.240, Speaker A: I'm going to cut it off here very quickly here. Baby, don't hurt me. What is love? Okay, so Steven Deibas with a work on object. Very cool. Olivera Durdevic. Very cool. AI based digital artwork.
00:58:42.240 - 00:58:55.860, Speaker A: Very interesting. Digital art, pixel art, AI art. Vanishing .7 tazos. Here is tuques. Another clue. Kind of reminds me of early miro, actually somewhat in this series.
00:58:55.860 - 00:59:08.760, Speaker A: So a bit of a reveal there. Here's Santiago with an awesome AI artwork. Let's just zoom in on this. Look at these textures. Look at that. Very futuristic and wild looking. Beautiful.
00:59:08.760 - 00:59:22.602, Speaker A: And here's another work by Santiago. Kind of has more of an anime feel. These are brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. Here's aile rainbow landscape. Abstract vision. So beautiful. This is using improps.
00:59:22.602 - 00:59:39.718, Speaker A: Beautiful digital painting here. And here's another one by aylay. Some skulls and the american flag. Very topical. And here is Sulkian aerodynamic on arzora. Just a wild artist here. I think I'm going to see Salkien in Argentina.
00:59:39.718 - 00:59:58.318, Speaker A: Excitingly. Here's machine, hilariously with the italian boots. Wearing the italian boots, I think. Totally hilarious. Why haven't we seen this before? A brilliant idea. Here's another work by machine, randomly spraying my followers. Okay.
00:59:58.318 - 01:00:29.630, Speaker A: And here is. Right, she's doing portraits of her followers here. So people that submit a photo. Here is Martin Bruce doing more work with the airbrush. So joining the Airbrush party here, another cat, hilariously. And here's Bondozo Bandido, also with kind of using, you know, an airbrush artist, we could say super fun. And a painting, also a beautiful painting here by Bondozo Bandido.
01:00:29.630 - 01:00:41.766, Speaker A: Just a huge talent. And here's nugget brain. Look at this video here. You see a lot of the brilliant. Look at that. I've never even seen that work. Just a wonderful painting.
01:00:41.766 - 01:01:04.198, Speaker A: This is part of a show at Albert contemporary. Look at the sculptures. This is the artist I was thinking of, you know, doing sculptures, doing that. Brilliant work, works in progress. And you're going to see nugget brain paint the sky a little bit, I think, in some of these. In one of these works. Again, sculpture should really be thinking about that.
01:01:04.198 - 01:01:23.418, Speaker A: Look at this sculpture. Just kind of adds to the whole heft and vision of the show, doesn't it? Mysterious music intensifies. So fascinating. Look at this. More sculpture. Okay. And sculpture actually lends itself quite well to nugget Brain's work.
01:01:23.418 - 01:01:51.816, Speaker A: So look at that volume. I mean, really great artist here deserves the attention. One of my favorites. I'd love to have an original of this artist now. Yeah, I think we can see the sky being painted in a second here because I want to show that, because it shows how raw this artist is. Might just have to move on here. But you see up close, beautiful texture.
01:01:51.816 - 01:02:03.240, Speaker A: Here it is. See that? Like no special technique there. I mean, there is, but. And there's a sculpture. Anyways, that is your show. My friends, thank you for joining me. And until next time.
01:02:03.240 - 01:02:07.520, Speaker A: Maybe I see you on spaces with tuna. Until next time. Take care.
