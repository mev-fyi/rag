00:00:07.760 - 00:00:29.205, Speaker A: The dumpster fire is underway. It is election week. And of course the newspaper, the imagination had to celebrate it. We have our own takeover here. Welcome back artist journal, November 4, 2024. Screaming into the unknown called this microphone in front of me. My name is Adrian Pocabelli and welcome back.
00:00:29.205 - 00:00:53.535, Speaker A: Massive show note. I got the regular music back. I was tempted. I was like, maybe I should keep the two minute music intro kind of adds another flavor to the whole. You know what it does, it adds unpredictability because the unpredictability being when will I turn down the music. And it actually could add excitement to the intro. Massive show note.
00:00:53.535 - 00:01:19.591, Speaker A: So I go to. I begin my journey to Bangkok through Munich on Wednesday. So the show, this kind of season, so to speak, is we had a good run there from I think mid September. Where are we starting November. So this kind of. I've realized these are seasons that I'm kind of putting together here. So I will continue to broadcast, but it will be more sporadic in the coming days.
00:01:19.591 - 00:01:53.443, Speaker A: I go to Bangkok on Thursday, direct flight from Munich. So that is fabulous. And from there it's a pretty epic trip, actually. Then I go to Rome and then see some relatives and bologna and then to find out about my genealogy a little bit. That is where the family part of the family is from. Then I go to London and then I go to Toronto to visit family and then I go to Saskatoon to visit family and then I go to Seattle, so. And then I come back to Saskatoon.
00:01:53.443 - 00:02:17.215, Speaker A: So it's a gigantic trip. I don't think I've ever gone on a trip this big. I'm not sure I'm quite ready for it in a lot of ways. And so all to say, I am going to broadcast. My mom has great Internet in Saskatoon and I'm going to broadcast along the way. But it's going to be more sporadic. It's not going to be the, you know, mechanical Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
00:02:17.215 - 00:03:24.405, Speaker A: So just so you know, and thank you everybody for all of the support throughout. It just makes life, you know, so much more enjoyable. You know, it's like this digital life out of A friend actually was Runtune, my good friend Runetoon who was describing on a space, maybe you heard it, I think it was last week or the week before, maybe a couple of weeks ago, where the he works with, you know, younger people, as he calls them, and how they have these other digital lives and how like they might be kind of quiet and just keep to themselves at work, but then you look at their TikTok and it's like this wild, out of control, hilarious kind of feed and how they almost have these analogous lives. And so all to say, I'm just very grateful for this Internet situation that we have here. Just doing what we do here, you and me. So just a big heartfelt thank you. It is nice, you know, a nice, you know, alternative, so to speak, from the everyday, you know, from the physical world.
00:03:24.405 - 00:04:00.973, Speaker A: So all to say, I put physical in quotes. All to say, yeah, so it continues is what I'm trying to say. So here's Sabato, hilariously the perfect front page for the newspaper. The imagination this week. It is election week, of course, the story that will dominate all stories and even it hits us in the world of imagination. Here it is seeping through and a hilarious actually work. Let me see if I can actually get election anxiety.
00:04:00.973 - 00:04:20.763, Speaker A: This is from Sabato's alternative account, marginalia still available, by the way. I need to pick one of these up. There are still, I think 23 left. I don't expect that to last. Who knows, I will pick one up. I hope to remember after the show. So this.
00:04:20.763 - 00:05:09.047, Speaker A: So of course a ballot box and there is anxiety and there's a lot I love about this work and both sides, of course, you know, not to get into the politics, but there is a sense that both sides will not accept the outcome. So. And hopefully we're all wrong, you know, this, that sense is wrong. Right. So I think Sabato is zeroing in on this and what I really loved about this work is what you could call a quasi political work. I mean, it's not. The reason I say quasi is because it's not trying to hammer home do this or you should think this, you should think that this isn't an election ad, this is a commentary on the election itself, one could argue.
00:05:09.047 - 00:06:00.361, Speaker A: And this sense of anxiety, whatever side people are on or non side. And that's what I love about it. This is, you know, and I brought it up here and we'll come back to Sabato's work here in the earlier version I believe was there, but it really reminds me of this, which is Warhol's dollar sign. And it brings a very important subject for me, which is you've heard me say in the past, quoting my friend, my good friend Mark, Liam Smith, who's like a sensation on TikTok, by the way. I watched him, he does drawing exercises and now he's getting like millions of views. So shout out to Mark Smith out of Toronto. What a great story that was he put out a book and everything.
00:06:00.361 - 00:06:22.869, Speaker A: Wow. But as my friend Mark, as my friend likes to say, as my friend Mark likes to say, you know, his joke about when you go to the gallery and then the commentary is, well, well, it's too didactic. Right? And what does didactic mean? It means it's too literal. It's too clear. Let's say you have, you know, it's not. It's not vague enough. Like, it's not.
00:06:22.869 - 00:07:02.287, Speaker A: And maybe vague's not the right word. It's not ambiguous enough. And to me, this Warhol dollar sign has always been one of the perfect examples of this. Because is this a celebration of criticism of capitalism with the dollar sign and of money and materialism? Is it a criticism of capitalism and the dollar sign and of money? So is it a celebration? Is it a criticism? Is it neither? Excuse me. It's unclear. It's ambiguous. This, I would argue, is not didactic.
00:07:02.287 - 00:07:17.127, Speaker A: And this is, you know, bringing it back here. This is the great move I would argue Sabato did here. He kept it ambiguous. There's no sense of. Again, it's not didactic. It's not literal. It's not.
00:07:17.127 - 00:08:11.433, Speaker A: Otherwise, where's the poetry? And, you know, this is, you know, sometimes I call, you know, what we do in the art land as a kind of meta politics. It's not like, I mean, there can be the left, right, you know, entering into politics. You think of Diego Rivera, right out of Mexico, kind of had left leanings. You think of Dali, who is probably more conservative, right? So it does seep in. But ultimately, I would argue, and Dali wasn't overly literal about it, I would argue, say, Dali putting the portrait of the head of Germany during World War II, that little portrait, you know, in there, one could argue there's ambiguity in there. It's. It's kind of doing the same thing here, which is.
00:08:11.433 - 00:08:41.353, Speaker A: It's not saying good, bad, as the surrealists, you know, say. Like, we have no kind of. It's not about giving a kind of didactic or a moral, moralizing to the crowd, which is something, it's worth saying, that you often see in the museums. We remember that comment. I believe it was absurd deity. I think, if I remember right, or I think it was them, I'm not positive. Excuse me.
00:08:41.353 - 00:09:01.443, Speaker A: Someone was commenting, you know, how going to the museum, they feel like it's. They're being preached to a little too much. And again, this is why I like this work. And who knows if Sabato intended it that way, but at least for Me. That's why I love this. It's not preaching. Right.
00:09:01.443 - 00:09:28.657, Speaker A: It's more going into what I would argue is the meta of the situation, which is the anxiety around the election. Right? It's going around. The bigger. The sense of, like, the world's like, you know, the stage of the world will be looking on. At what is, you know, the world will be looking on this election stage. You know, every. I'm sure it's almost on every adult's mind in the world.
00:09:28.657 - 00:09:57.215, Speaker A: Right. I mean, it's the biggest show in town. And so what I love about this, again, is it kind of zeros in on the iconography, the voting booth. And I think there was even a story around. There were burnt ballots or who knows or so, and kind of zeroing in on this anxiety around, you know, the politics, the. The of the being a fair election. Right.
00:09:57.215 - 00:10:22.705, Speaker A: And this whole thing. And I love that. So all to say, super rad artwork here by Sabato. Now, just a couple of things. On a formal basis, I want to look at here, which is, first of all, this little. It looks like a little figure here. And I don't know how much this is based on the actual election ballot drop box, you know, official ballot drop box, if there is even one.
00:10:22.705 - 00:11:17.027, Speaker A: I think there are, but I think Sabato seems to have anthropomorphized it, you know, turning it into this little kind of robot machine where this is almost like the, you know, the eyes, so to speak, of this little robot. Interesting color with the gray and the pink, which I think is super interesting. We see kind of like E boy in the stars of the flag here. I think the flag is actually rendered beautifully, I have to say. The light, the hard color here, the hard contrast here between the light hitting this ballot box and the other side, that's kind of dark, almost to the point of it being metaphoric. So just really cool. And again, adding almost a touch of humor, if I'm not mistaken, by almost making it look like a little robot.
00:11:17.027 - 00:11:37.451, Speaker A: Right. And then so again, kind of transforming the whole thing into this almost again, giving it personality. Almost a portrait of our anxiety. Right. Or of the world's anxiety right around this whole, you know, election. Right. And it's almost like the anxiety.
00:11:37.451 - 00:11:56.905, Speaker A: Yeah. It's captured by the uncertainty and this whole fairness, whatever side one's on. So very cool. Interesting gray. I guess it's like a cement type floor. And then here, the gradient at the background, and of course, the smoke kind of burning here. This robot on fire.
00:11:56.905 - 00:12:34.423, Speaker A: This is us To a certain degree, capturing. So really capturing the moment here beautifully. Only $5.95 addition of 44. And what's cool here? And of course, I follow the great Sabato here. It's ballot season, so this came out, I think, a few days earlier. So you see kind of a window is, you know, Sabato was kind of massaging this work, right? And to me, this is a good reason not to release your work too quickly because it could be tempted here.
00:12:34.423 - 00:12:51.587, Speaker A: Okay, I've done the work, you know, blah, blah, blah, like done. But no, let it seep in. There are. There is a time. There is a time and a place for letting work seep in. As an artist coming back to it two days later. Does this need something? And here it looks like, hey, first there were two ballots.
00:12:51.587 - 00:13:08.001, Speaker A: No, two ballot boxes. Now we'll just do one. Maybe the, you know, flashing light here in what looks like the robot eyes, you know, what I'm calling. But which is really the place where you put your ballot. Maybe that needs to be developed. Maybe it should be on fire. Right? Maybe we just need one.
00:13:08.001 - 00:13:32.365, Speaker A: And maybe the color in the background could be slightly more saturated. It's ballot season, so just very interesting and, you know, to see the works in progress like that. So a wonderful way to get started here. So thank you everybody, for the support last episode. The great Kurt Hustle Collective. And let's. Yeah, I love how I can just put all the old videos as we scroll down here.
00:13:32.365 - 00:13:49.991, Speaker A: Let's go to the comments. Human Boy vibes. Human Boy, excellent episode as always. The artists in this scene never cease to amaze me. Indeed. Really hoping I can see clownvamp's junk machine robot in person. Such a brilliant idea for bridging AI art into the physical world on demand.
00:13:49.991 - 00:14:10.689, Speaker A: And of course, we looked at that last episode briefly in the community. Yeah, clownvamp, I would call. It's a bit of a cliche to say thought leader, but a bit of a thought leader, I would say. In the whole AI camp, we've had. I think I've had Clown Vamp on more than any other guest in the. On the spaces. And every time it's just show.
00:14:10.689 - 00:14:20.049, Speaker A: Just a great show on the latest on AI, among others. So great to hear that. Human Boy. David Nunn. Hi. Thank you. Big shout out to David.
00:14:20.049 - 00:14:36.469, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment. K Town crypto king. Wow. At 47, trying to remember what was there. And did I write totally. I can't remember what was there, but I did look and I remember being impressed. T08Y232 first spooky.
00:14:36.469 - 00:14:54.345, Speaker A: So thank you for the comments everybody. And also on X Massive, this is a huge 11,064 retweets, 13 bookmarks. Great response. Thank you for the support. As ever, Iowa. Happy Halloween. Thank you.
00:14:54.345 - 00:15:05.881, Speaker A: Clownvamp. Thanks for the shout out. You are more than welcome. Kurt Hustle Collector. We love Kurt Hustle Collective. We love you too. So just rad Kurt Hustle Collective making this just brilliant work of art.
00:15:05.881 - 00:15:23.321, Speaker A: The love and the joy in these works are just inspiring is really what they are. And that old work that we looked at, oh, it's just wonderful. Rosetio, great to hear from you. Lan Luc Yan, Lucas Migone, great to hear from you. Happy Halloween. Kiro. Yes, another long one.
00:15:23.321 - 00:15:33.073, Speaker A: Keep them coming. You're welcome. Indeed. It is very difficult to not make them long. Libra Block. Thanks for speech featuring my spooky pumpkins. You're welcome.
00:15:33.073 - 00:15:46.241, Speaker A: We ended the show with those beautiful works there too. Walk. Great to hear from you, Kels. Great show. So many fun and beautiful works. Especially loved but true by Denise Cormaz. It is indeed hand drawn.
00:15:46.241 - 00:15:56.657, Speaker A: Okay, excellent. Thank you for clearing that up. And yeah, I think we looked. Yeah, we looked at at least one work by Denise Cormaz last show. Ex Mortal. Awesome to hear from you. Great show, Adrian.
00:15:56.657 - 00:16:07.257, Speaker A: Great title too. Indeed. Embracing the Glitch. That was a fun. That was a fun one. Rosacho, thank you for highlighting our collab. So here is the Exquisite corpse.
00:16:07.257 - 00:16:29.287, Speaker A: And remember I was kind of like not remembering exactly how the exquisite corpse was made. Well, look at this. That's right, we did the exquisite corpse digitally instead of folding paper. Since digital paper doesn't exactly fold, I set up a template file in Photoshop. After finishing each part, we covered it. We covered it with a layer, leaving a small hint for the next person to continue. So.
00:16:29.287 - 00:16:44.807, Speaker A: Exactly. So you can't see what's happening. You just got. So what a great animation here to show us. Just radio digital exquisite corpses. Just more reasons to love what's going on over here. Venta.
00:16:44.807 - 00:17:01.271, Speaker A: Thank you, Adrian, for. For a wonderful highlight of my work. Yes, you are correct that those who collect the digital painting will get the AI version airdropped to them for free. Very cool. And so that's good to know. Venta doing very cool experimental work there with AI and digital painting. Seti.
00:17:01.271 - 00:17:12.963, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. Universal Reality. Always great to hear from you as well. Kyle Wiles. The glitch must be embraced. JNK of Kurt Hustle Collective. Awesome to hear from you.
00:17:12.963 - 00:17:23.971, Speaker A: And Dario Desienna of Super Rare. Love how you go deep in the details of every artwork. Really loved. Really great to watch. Awesome to hear from you, Dario. Great to hear and Vaheed. Thank you.
00:17:23.971 - 00:17:47.757, Speaker A: So thank you everybody for the comments and support. Also jumping in the community very quickly here, here. This is pretty rad. I thought art commission needs some trash art. So I don't know. So it looks like the. It's like an image of these game cartridges and the label has been changed here.
00:17:47.757 - 00:18:11.199, Speaker A: It's kind of a cool. Cool. Would you call it a pastiche or kind of intervention, shall we call it? Nice work there. Ernesto Ash with a couple of abstracts here. This is one of ones which are 100 tezos on tazos on object. Cool abstracts. Minimal color.
00:18:11.199 - 00:18:35.569, Speaker A: Three colors there generally red, white and black. Always a nice combination. Tornado Rodriguez to answer Pocabelle's question about how I make gifts of the processes of my works. It's like this saving an image every time I make a change I feel is relevant. So super interesting. I think I might have brought this up later as well actually. So how cool is that showing? So basically taking a screenshot.
00:18:35.569 - 00:18:55.023, Speaker A: So really being conscious about it. Right. Which is kind of well worth your while as an artist. We saw Sabato putting the work in progress. Again, I say this to myself as much as anybody else. It's such a great thing to do because it just opens the world. It gets people interested in your art.
00:18:55.023 - 00:19:17.611, Speaker A: As I always say, work in progress is basically the best marketing artists can do because it's really inviting people and people are fascinated. It's like my friend again, Mark William Smith. You know, people love watching people draw. You know, like it's. It's quite a thing. So it's just gets people interested. So great to hear from you, Tornado.
00:19:17.611 - 00:19:30.739, Speaker A: Thanks for sharing. Peterel Ambition. One so cool. Minimal abstract pixel art piece with a little bit of texture in the background there for good measure. Thank you for sharing. Interesting color. And Nahid, thank you for sharing.
00:19:30.739 - 00:19:51.167, Speaker A: That looks almost physical. That is on Tazos Cheerful Woman. Doesn't that look almost physical? It's getting hard to tell if it's digital or physical work. I think this is physical, but it is getting increasingly hard to tell. Interestingly. Centero Jaguar Tech digital collage. Every element of this composition, it's called Kansas.
00:19:51.167 - 00:20:04.075, Speaker A: Everything was taken from the Atlas of Human Anatomy and surgery. Wow. By J.M. bougerie and N.H. jacob Lincoln. Comments. That is cool.
00:20:04.075 - 00:20:21.807, Speaker A: I didn't even. Yeah, I'm reading that for the first time now. I saw the image, I was like, I'll read it on the show. That is cool. Creating a landscape out of an anatomical diagrams. Very nice. Very cool.
00:20:21.807 - 00:20:46.281, Speaker A: Is this minted? And if not, when and where will this be minted? There it is. Object. Shall we quickly look? That is so brilliant. We are going to take some time here. Just a minute and look at that Bridget. New York City listing. And is it sold out? It is one at 890 and sold out at only a Tezos.
00:20:46.281 - 00:21:05.321, Speaker A: So maybe a newcomer on the scene. Let me make sure to follow Centero. Okay, so that's an older work. More where that came from. I would just make an entire like body of work around that. You could just take it beyond landscape too. Because you know what it reminds you of? What is? I always forget his name.
00:21:05.321 - 00:21:32.937, Speaker A: I want to call him Pontero or something. But that's not right. The artist who makes the faces out of fruit. Right? Famous, you know, Renaissance artist. And so this is just a great substitution. Speaking of fascination, we fascinate over the body and the internal. Like it's just kind of Ballard always got a very rich kind of imaginative content, so to speak.
00:21:32.937 - 00:21:49.315, Speaker A: Acid reindeer. Thank you for posting. Very interesting combination of mark making and square kind of pixelation and graph. What looks like graph paper. Martin Jo GM And Happy Halloween to Martin Joe. The Very cool. And there's the ghost.
00:21:49.315 - 00:22:10.839, Speaker A: The Halloween cup. So very cool work from Martin Jo as ever out of Argentina. Fatima, thank you for sharing. Kind of looks like procreate paintings. These look more digital, don't they? Interestingly, Andre Summer Blues Digital Exquisite corpse. Got six editions minted. So here one of the three artists here.
00:22:10.839 - 00:22:27.679, Speaker A: There's Renny Fish, there's Rosaceo and Andre Summer Blues. So very cool. They look great, don't they? So just pretty awesome. Libro block. And there we are, we are through. And there's the Clown Vamp junk machine. For those that are interested to know more.
00:22:27.679 - 00:23:01.175, Speaker A: It's in the community. So thank you everybody for sharing. As we go into the wider world here on artnet. Really interesting. Just more as we try and get a picture of what's going on out there from an art perspective. We have the art detective Katya Kazakina. The LA art scene was booming and many of you who are in the contemporary art world, you know, you'll have heard of LA from the last 5 to 10 years as being like a big hub, kind of a really great place to be because it wasn't always like that.
00:23:01.175 - 00:23:17.935, Speaker A: Traditionally seen as the greatest art place. But in the last. Let's call it 10 years. It did kind of get that reputation. So it was booming. And now galleries are suddenly closing. At least 10 galleries have shuttered since 2023, and more may soon.
00:23:17.935 - 00:24:01.205, Speaker A: And those are probably major or well known galleries is what I would assume, because probably more than just 10. Los Angeles has been a major source of optimism for the art world in recent years, with dealers flocking west like a new gold rush. Megas like David Zwerner and Hauser and Wirth have been making big bets on the city, and enterprising smaller outfits have been opening too. But some have found the situation on the ground to be trickier than they had hoped, especially when galleries are tightening their belts with alarming regularity. Galleries over Tinseltown have been closing, reducing their footprints or decreasing their programming. Hiatus is a frequently heard word taking a break. And there's an expectation that more spaces are set to shutter soon.
00:24:01.205 - 00:24:43.385, Speaker A: Artist Amir Fallout, who I think is on the blockchain by the way, noted on threads last month that several galleries had closed. And he was just pointing out that many galleries were pumping out shows and selling tons of work during the pandemic. They were getting a lot of attention at the time, but the writing was always on the wall. Growing too fast, raising the prices of artists too high, and only focusing on transactions and not long term artistic growth for the artists they represent. It's an interesting question. This was brought up. Was it Evelyno who was saying, when I was being too hard on galleries, like, part of the gallery's job, one could argue, is to foster the talent and everything.
00:24:43.385 - 00:25:44.867, Speaker A: I think it's all that makes sense that there should be this long term artistic growth, but only from like a gallery is a business like any other and ultimately if you're not making money in that business, it will eventually, you know, decline and disappear, right? I mean, one would think so. You know, as long as that's good. In a sense, you could argue the business model was too short term rather than being long term. I would argue though, they were responding to a hot market and once the market kind of got unhot and cooled off, maybe the best thing to do is just shut down. I mean, there's no sense trying to, you know, from a purely business perspective. So I'm not sure this would have made sense, like in a sense, by going, getting as much as they could and raising prices as much as possible to get the collector. Maybe that was the best thing they could do for their business and made the most money, interestingly.
00:25:44.867 - 00:26:09.335, Speaker A: So now again, we can't go through the whole thing. But I do want to just read a little bit more here. The art market has been in retreat for two years. We shouldn't be surprised. The same scenarios playing out in New York and Hong Kong. LA stands apart, LA though, stands apart because LA has a decentralized art scene because of the specific circumstances of its closures. It's hard to paint a picture of what's happening.
00:26:09.335 - 00:26:45.705, Speaker A: So. And then they go into Vito Schnabel open something. But calling it just an experiment. Lauren gallery closed down because clients stopped buying art. Right. And Nino Meyer abruptly, abruptly shuttered his three spaces in la. I mean this is, I mean if money and you know, is the ultimate goal here, and I'm not saying it should be by the way, but I'm just saying from a purely business perspective, why stay open? Why spend all that day in the gallery if you're not making.
00:26:45.705 - 00:27:32.275, Speaker A: You got your, you did well and then there's no sense staying open from a purely business perspective. Carlisle Packer, an emerging art dynamo who put Lauren Haisley in a group show back in 2017, gave up her space in Silver Lake and has been doing pop up exhibitions. I don't want to litter an already littered landscape. I work with artists and I sell artworks no matter if I'm living in my living room or in a physical location. So and so a lot of kind of what you'd call probably major galleries in the LA scene shutting down, interestingly. And so just kind of fitting another puzzle piece as we kind of come to understand what is going on out there. Here's an interesting quote.
00:27:32.275 - 00:28:08.061, Speaker A: Bill Powers, whose New York based Half Gallery has been staging exhibitions since 2022, said he will suspend LA programming till next spring. Quote Part of the reset right now is refocusing and consolidation. You want to be smart about resources and from sold out to hold out. This was an interesting comment, I thought here too. Niels Kanter, a local dealer selling and buying art is no longer a rookies game and more of a venture for established collectors. These aren't sellout shows and maybe that should be normalized. So yeah.
00:28:08.061 - 00:28:34.553, Speaker A: And Stephen Simkovitz, a pretty well known art personality, said he estimates that top tier galleries are seeing a 25% drop in revenue. On average it's 35 to 40% decline and the really weak players are down 50 to 70%. Quote There are a lot of closures that are quiet, people moving into smaller spaces. You're seeing a consolidation of square footage across town. You're just seeing a contraction. Business is bad. This was Interesting too.
00:28:34.553 - 00:29:11.705, Speaker A: Finally, relating to the crypto NFT scene, here is Lauren. Let me get the name Lauren, who has come from LA to Hong Kong, represented young emerging artists with prices ranging from 10,000 to 20,000. Maybe it's just one name there. Here it is. Quote, everyone stopped buying at the same time, he said, referring to new collectors who made money in crypto and NFTs, which both crashed at the time. Quote, after months and months of zero sales, we decided to close both spaces. I lost so much money.
00:29:11.705 - 00:29:44.781, Speaker A: Interesting. Now, remember the article that was in Bloomberg? It's not the artists, it's the market. We looked at that maybe a week and a half ago. Maybe there is something to be said for that. I kind of lightly criticize that in the sense. But put it this way, I think what's happening, part of what's happening is a market issue with, you know, less speculation. But I kind of feel there's something else going on here, which is why I keep harping on it.
00:29:44.781 - 00:30:37.241, Speaker A: And I think what's happening is there's too much supply, but it's really, there's something bigger going on. There's like a secular shift in contemporary arts. People are bored is what I would argue. And there are huge exceptions. I saw a great show on the weekend, you know, I saw a couple of great shows, two great shows, you know, Captain Petzl and Nagel Drexler both had fantastic shows. So I'm not saying this is all terrible, but I would say generally speaking, there is a sense of tiredness in the market and that it's becoming. Intellectually it's running out of gas, I would argue is what's going on here and you're seeing the market is kind of, you know, because put it this way, I would argue on Tezos is very small, but you are.
00:30:37.241 - 00:31:09.147, Speaker A: You don't really see it running out of gas. If anything, you're seeing kind of excitement build, as we're going to see here. So I don't, you know, and the probably, you know, as probably being described here, art is too expensive. There's too much of it. It's become like, I think I heard somewhere there's 40,000 graduates out of Fine Arts now per year. I don't know if that's true, but I mean, you know, the market can't sustain that. And each year and how many artists do really get talked about in the whole.
00:31:09.147 - 00:31:48.725, Speaker A: In a wider world. And all of a sudden it's like, you know, object starts looking pretty attractive in that environment. It's smallness that Kind of tight community is a virtue that should be appreciated for every day that it's here because it could get really big. And before you know it, you're going to have a hard time getting those collectors if you're competing with 40,000 other people. For example, another just kind of. To me, this is just more circumstantial evidence here. This is Dexter Wimberley, I think, a prominent curator, if I'm not mistaken, sometimes out of Japan, but I believe American, and conversation with the critics, the future of the New York art scene.
00:31:48.725 - 00:32:43.575, Speaker A: And to me, again, this is more circumstantial evidence of a kind of identity crisis, so to speak, for contemporary art as the market kind of pulls the liquidity out. And I think there's this kind of like, okay, what does this mean? And where are we going? And this kind of going back to, you know, now that the money's getting pulled out, it's like, well, what are we doing here? And I think this is why you have this kind of talk. The future of the New York arts scene. I mean, if it's booming, do you need to have kind of discussions about where this is all going? Right. Like I'd argue, no, you're going, I can't believe this amazing movement that's happening. So just more circumstantial evidence of a secular change and the global art scene is where I'm kind of going with this. So I suspect we're just putting out our antennae here, our news antennae.
00:32:43.575 - 00:33:14.969, Speaker A: But that is my sense in building the case here over months. Just another significant show here, Gustave Caillebotte, a once in a generation show at Musee d'alc in Paris. So of course, who did this fantastic work here? One of the. I don't know if you'd call a post Impressionist, a collector of the Impressionists. And this is, you know, donated. Donated the collection of his. Of his, basically his Impressionist friends.
00:33:14.969 - 00:33:49.595, Speaker A: Here's more by Caillebotte, and this is. I just wanted to highlight this. Gustave Caillebotte was so modest that when bequeathing paintings by his Impressionist friends to France, which is the foundation of the Musee d'Orsay's great collection and it is one of the great Impressionist collections in the world, he omitted his own. He didn't include his own. His most adventurous pictures to startling, startlingly starting startlingly modern to appeal to conservative French taste. Subsequently found homes abroad, but now they're back at the Musee d'alc. So just very.
00:33:49.595 - 00:34:20.925, Speaker A: Sounds like if you travel around, if you're going to be in Paris. This sounds like a show to see, a once in a generation show. That is quite the statement. Alain Survey I thought this was kind of funny and many of you know I love to follow Alain Survey kind of again, this account that doesn't get nearly the attention it deserves. This great commenter on contemporary art and just all things interesting. Ariel Buddick even manages to make old Masters exciting. I thought this, you know, I almost.
00:34:20.925 - 00:35:17.421, Speaker A: I usually relate a lot to what Al Ancesrve says, but for all of his great links and he's fabulous here even, you know, I thought this was a kind of a. Put it this way, these Siena old master paintings, they do not need Ariela Buddick or another put it this way, they don't need a reporter to make them interesting. I would say so kind of a. Maybe it was just Alain Survey's way of saying what a great article. But I thought it was kind of a weird, you know, comment 1300-1350 golden generation brought back to life at the Met and we looked at this in an earlier show, some of these works and you see how spectacular this show looks. Again it's at the Met and I got a message from someone who said it's going to be in London I think in January. So all those people in Europe, I will try and go it looks like a must see show here.
00:35:17.421 - 00:35:45.613, Speaker A: Unfortunately, paywall on this article. I, I thought this was kind of funny and I just wanted to touch on it. So Henny Editions who put out work with Damien Hirst in the past. Limited edition hand signed prints. Less than 48 hours left to apply to. So it's almost like a white list. Like I feel like this is very 2021, this whole like you can apply to buy it, you know, like is that the market we're in and maybe there is that much demand.
00:35:45.613 - 00:36:10.275, Speaker A: But I thought kind of a. I found kind of humorous actually. Let's continue. Alejandro Cartagena I thought this was interesting. We won't read all of it, but there's an interesting point here. NFTs kind of skewed the idea and expectations of what it means to be an artist. The reality is that doing art is going to be a perpetual bear market for 99% of artists.
00:36:10.275 - 00:36:54.295, Speaker A: And this is the reality. Only 1% of artists sees financial freedom from making art. It is the same in most industry and creative spaces. Why would you expect it? This is what I've always said here, which is we have to be incredibly grateful for the situation that we have here in the Digital kind of blockchain world. And I have to say, especially right now on Tezos, but what previously was existing on Zora, you know, and what was before on Ethereum, there was a nice like. And there are still sales on Ethereum. So just like this whole blockchain, you know, as Spiegels is doing fabulously on Ethereum, so, you know, there are still sales being made here.
00:36:54.295 - 00:37:35.649, Speaker A: But also all to say we have to be incredibly grateful that there's all this liquidity in the crypto scene that and this interest in digital art. So I agree. And they were commenting on a comment by Alejandro was commenting on a comment by Jedi Wolf. Some of the greatest artists lived through the bear market for their entire lives. And this is so true. So, you know, because you have seen comments, I think it was Max Osiris who was saying, why would you want to sell for pennies on Tezos or a dollar? I mean, it's better than Nothing to get 100 bucks for your work. That's great.
00:37:35.649 - 00:38:07.049, Speaker A: I mean, that continues. You continue to make work. So I don't want to overstate how wonderful it is, but it's fantastic actually to be able to get 100 bucks for your work. You know, Sabato, there's addition of 44, 10 tezos, there'll be 440 tezos. What is that, like 250 bucks? And he will sell out, right? So I mean, that's pretty good, right? And it's like that's probably going to put out two or three other works this month, right? So let's continue. Woman. Woman NFT sold 300 Tezos in additions in the past 10 days.
00:38:07.049 - 00:38:49.781, Speaker A: Ardan Tezos is the alpha. So again, bringing in probably like 160, $70. Fantastic. I mean, this is real money, right? And sometimes it gets even better. So congrats to Woman nft. Amidon Ardon Tezos will probably be that thing which wasn't valued enough at the time to warrant your attention and will seem stupidly obvious in hindsight that it should have, it's hard to imagine it not doing well. Not financial advice, but when you think of the quality, the interest and importantly the consistency and dedication to art making that is here.
00:38:49.781 - 00:39:59.543, Speaker A: We're seeing artists that are here for years, right? And we're seeing them evolve and get better and push their craft and doing it in a what I'd call a fairly new medium in new ways, talking about relevant, you know, making a relevant art, at what point does that, you know, become worthless? You know, at what point is that where like, it's not. And I would argue it's just, you know, surprisingly small is how I keep describing the scene. Like, you might think an edition of 44 by Sabato is really large, right? It's like, whoa, 44 at 10 days. You know, when you think of a global art scene and what could happen here and look at the play that this got 33,000 views here, 131 tweets. When you think of the amount of people that could end up collecting Sabato's work 10 years from now, especially if he keeps going. And he will, I bet I venture to bet he will or they will forgive me. You know, I'm sure that, you know, that's, you know, is that only going to, you know, is that not going to appreciate.
00:39:59.543 - 00:40:17.823, Speaker A: Who knows, maybe the blockchain gets killed, like. But I'm just saying, you know, I totally agree. Object. Object.com to our incredible Tezos community. The crypto world has its ups and downs, but we're here for the long haul. Huge thanks to the Tezos foundation for their support.
00:40:17.823 - 00:41:08.395, Speaker A: So I'm not sure if they got some sort of funding, but my understanding right now is the Tezos foundation, which has gotten a mountain of criticism over the years, sounds like, you know, perhaps justifiably. I think they finally. My impression is they've got the message in the last six months, maybe longer, but maybe around that, that actually, you know, the front end to their blockchain is really Object, as I like to call it, and that, you know, they have a wonderful thing going on right now on their blockchain and could, you know, So I think they're starting to really. So I wonder if they, you know, basically gave OBJECT some support. We're proud to be part of such an innovative space with all of you. Get ready. 2025 and beyond is going to be amazing as we scale up our team and offering.
00:41:08.395 - 00:41:25.049, Speaker A: So I don't know if Tezos Foundation. I hope they are because they really should be making sure Object, they should be pouring in investment really into that. So. And there's hp Love Bucks. Awesome. So just interesting and kind of bullish. Coldy.
00:41:25.049 - 00:41:58.049, Speaker A: Serious question. I hear a lot about the worry that eth layer 2s won't survive long term due to upkeep and funding. If those are. Yeah, very possible. If those are the reasons, would that make BASE an outlier as they have coinbase backing with team and funding? It's an interesting question because of course, BASE is a L2 now. It uses, from my understanding, the optimism I don't know if they call it Super Stack or Super Chain, right. So I guess it would depend if as long as optimism's around, then base would be around.
00:41:58.049 - 00:42:46.569, Speaker A: But if optimism stops developing, who knows? Kind of an interesting question, put it this way, it doesn't feel. Yeah, you know, putting a work on, you know, you do wonder, you know, with L2s. I think it depends on the L2 actually, you know, for, you know. And so yeah, I mean in base it's just an interesting question. I don't know if I have a good answer for this, but I think it's a fair question, you know. Now some people say the same thing about Tezos and they go, oh well, I'm not sure you want to put your work on Tezos for the long term, is it because going to be around in five years, Remember Patrick Amidon, you know, it wasn't that long ago was saying, you know, in 2027, Tezos will be over. Right.
00:42:46.569 - 00:43:23.107, Speaker A: And now you know, okay, so who knows is the big question. But these are, you know, for those that are from the outside wondering, these are some of the questions that a modern day digital artist on the blockchain faces. Where do I, where do I put this thing? It's a real question, you know, like I put a lot of my work on bitcoin, if I can I even make work that's small to put it on bitcoin and why? Well, as long as they don't get rid of this ordinals protocol could be around for a very long time. It'll be hopefully more resilient. So we saw this work by Tornado in the community there. So thank you Tornado for posting. Really cool.
00:43:23.107 - 00:43:51.455, Speaker A: You could almost mint those. But that would maybe, I don't know how that would work, but you could, I mean, you know, maybe that's what Rodeo was always intended for. Who knows? Quampa, look at this. So I don't know if that's Quampa or maybe Quampa's dad or maybe it's Quampa, I don't know. But look at that pretty cool work here. Like when you see it on the big screen. Like this work is designed for like projector or a big screen.
00:43:51.455 - 00:44:07.705, Speaker A: Look at that monitor. I wonder if that's Quampa future me doodling on steroids is my pathway. So that's cool. Okay, that's his, that's Quampa's uncle looking at the work. So how cool is that? Very cool. Here's Popple. More printing tests.
00:44:07.705 - 00:44:36.867, Speaker A: So square moving from the trading card format. So this is super rad. I mean, is this worth, like, I see value here. And again, you know, we're having this whole. An Laramie was bringing up the debate on physical versus digital. And who was it there was. I don't know if it was flannel capital or one of these accounts that I think collects digital art was saying it should go hand in hand.
00:44:36.867 - 00:45:03.387, Speaker A: I see this as a different artwork here. Like, I think if Popple wanted to sell edition of 20, let's say, of this work that was previously minted, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think it makes sense. The digital, if anything, I would argue maybe even increases the value of the digital being kind of the original medium where it came from. Right. And then all of a sudden it's like, oh, and then here's the print, maybe. Like, I don't think they should have to go be sold together.
00:45:03.387 - 00:45:19.179, Speaker A: And look at. Finally, look at how beautiful they are. This dithering, I imagine. I wonder how this was done. Is this on black paper? Because it sure looks like it. So how do you get white on black paper? Right. This isn't.
00:45:19.179 - 00:45:39.835, Speaker A: Put it this way, this is not inkjet, is it? Are these screen prints? What is the printing process? More printing tests. Very cool. Can't wait to hear more. Here's Ripcache material tests from earlier this year. Acrylic on canvas. And so very interesting. Let's see if we can make this a little bit bigger here.
00:45:39.835 - 00:46:10.907, Speaker A: Very nice. So again, the contrast of the physical and the digital. The geometric perfect pixelation here succumbing to the vicissitudes of physical reality here in this, when you go up close here. But this is part of the charm. And further, this is why it's a different work. Let's say this work here, for the sake of argument, was made as a digital work. I mean, this is a different work.
00:46:10.907 - 00:46:41.345, Speaker A: The digital will be straight, and in theory, it would be all crisp and everything here it's kind of bleeding. The paper matters. It's a different artwork. It's a different iteration of the artwork. And so. And here you even see it's almost like Rauschenberg style, right? Looks screen printed here. And then you see, it's just like Warhol could release, you know, 50 different Elvises, if not like 200 different Elvises or Marylands.
00:46:41.345 - 00:46:58.965, Speaker A: Right? It's the same thing. Each one is different. Right. Maybe you change the color a little bit. You try and, you know, you don't want it to be exactly the same. So all to say, super interesting as we continue to kind of sail forward here on the bleeding edge of. You know how to do this.
00:46:58.965 - 00:47:22.935, Speaker A: Let's continue. Look at the great Zozo. So we go into the works. It's called Lotus, I think. Just beautiful, so soothing. Lotus meditation. I picked one up.
00:47:22.935 - 00:47:52.611, Speaker A: Zozo could make an album, I think, with these beautiful synths. And so that sold out at 15 tazos. And so now on secondary, if you're 77, rad work. It's great. I was looking at, you know, Zozo used to sell one of ones for like 15, 25 tezos. Now you're getting like editions of 15 and selling out, you know, which is pretty exciting. Here's Canxapita, also doing very well here.
00:47:52.611 - 00:48:13.047, Speaker A: This went for 71 tezos. Beautiful work here. Nice kind of still version is this. This is max size. And again we see this cellular automata process, which I'm still trying to figure out. I'm going to reach out to Canaxapita shortly and then hopefully we get some more information here. But again, kind of playing with manga.
00:48:13.047 - 00:48:31.913, Speaker A: Look at the eyes on this. Maybe we can make this bigger, you know, like, look at these eyes, how rich they are. Here we go. And so just very interesting. Beautiful textures here from Canxapida. Here's another one with some Greek writing. Automat.
00:48:31.913 - 00:48:48.281, Speaker A: Automaton is, I believe, the title of the show in Greek. Ancient Greek, I think. Image made with a Python script of. So another work in this series here. So these are doing fabulous and adding some gif. Gif. That's a png.
00:48:48.281 - 00:49:18.693, Speaker A: Is that a png? Maybe it's a gif. If I had to guess, I don't think you can animate PNGs, but I could be wrong about that. So that is listed on object a couple of more by Kanxapata. These are AI, which are seeping into the front of the show. You know, when you start combining all of these techniques here, mom and his sister. A Cibitai output blend with other outputs in midjourney, animated with Python. So again, just super interesting textures here.
00:49:18.693 - 00:49:49.725, Speaker A: We're seeing this kind of degradation, so to speak, of the pixel, which is kind of beautiful and it's not kind of, I would argue, in a weird way, I'd say it's not easy, even though it is. Put it this way, there's an appetite, I think, for this, you know, imperfect pixels. Sometimes you can see it through AI, sometimes it's through processing different ways and everything. Anyway, beautiful work here, Mom. And his sister. A nice portrait. Walking with Friends.
00:49:49.725 - 00:50:15.447, Speaker A: Here's another work which looks like in the same series here. And again, these kind of pixelated figures, almost cut out figures in a kind of landscape. Here edition of one and going to unknown collector for 35 tezos. Here is head number five. So that is October 17th. So maybe I'm not sure if we've seen this one. And so I think they call this he.
00:50:15.447 - 00:50:29.999, Speaker A: Spiegel's called this Tezos Night. So this is on Tezos again. This is a multi chain PFP series, so to speak, with an old retro tv. Very carefully done with a lot of. Made with a lot of care. 100 tezos at auction. And check this out.
00:50:29.999 - 00:50:43.115, Speaker A: Rugged Kingdom doing fabulously. 12,000 views. 73 retweets. Spiegels with a very fun work here. Columns, grids, just playing with elements. It almost reminds me of Dan Control. It's like he probably already had the column ready.
00:50:43.115 - 00:51:03.025, Speaker A: Maybe if I repeat this, make a grid. Even the carpet, the rug may be from somewhere else. Almost looks like a magic carpet to a certain degree, the way it has a life of its own. This is on Tolo Gallery, I think. So Interesting. Or maybe that's the people who collected it. Here's Cat, the poet Engineer.
00:51:03.025 - 00:51:29.701, Speaker A: Kind of interesting here, as you see kind of text and image. It starts with number at the top and text. But you see these different variations with kind of what looks like a script animating it just kind of interesting. And I have to say I love the name here. Cat the poet Engineer. It really does look like engineered poetry. Very cool.
00:51:29.701 - 00:51:45.445, Speaker A: Enigmatic Train station, rush hour. 85 people, 13 missing. And look at that. You wonder where this is from. It kind of looks like facial recognition or person recognition. And then these are the. Maybe the people that aren't recognized.
00:51:45.445 - 00:52:09.283, Speaker A: So then maybe, you know. It's kind of creepy, isn't it? Like you. Makes you wonder like, is this what's going on? It probably is. Like, it probably looks like a real situ, like, you know, kind of sourced image. So anyways, interesting art. ASCII great ASCII artist and igmatras and putting visual ASCII on the train. Pretty heavy.
00:52:09.283 - 00:52:19.827, Speaker A: A lot of work on this one. So very cool work there. From enigmatic. Here's another one. ASCII shoes. Beautiful colors here. And again the ASCII covering.
00:52:19.827 - 00:52:36.789, Speaker A: Visual ASCII covering the shoes. And then some text, kind of numbers and mathematical signs. Shoes modified by ASCII elements. Looks like there's an intervention there of a certain kind. ASCII Shoes by Enigmatis. Here's Yuri J. What looks like.
00:52:36.789 - 00:52:56.749, Speaker A: I think it's from. At first I thought it was a coffee, but I think it's from a bathroom. Yeah, you see here, it's like a bath. And maybe this is a hot bath with the water kind of steaming here. It's kind of what that looks like. Maybe that's a shelf with products. So beautiful work here from Uri J.
00:52:56.749 - 00:53:22.249, Speaker A: And that is 100%. A couple of others posted on X from Urij. So kind of looks like a pan, right? Or a pot in the kitchen. And you see the doubling here. And this is a work in progress because as you see here, this looks like perhaps it's further down the road. So again, very interesting to see how artists kind of the work in progress develops. Maybe getting rid.
00:53:22.249 - 00:53:44.335, Speaker A: Maybe this is earlier, you know, because there's the second one. Maybe got rid of the second handle there. Hard to say. Just different, you know, it shows that with a digital artist can really release like 10 or 20 different works based on their work. Right. Opens up a whole bunch of, you know, interesting questions. Here's Hasdrubal Waffle pcb.
00:53:44.335 - 00:54:11.489, Speaker A: Love this work here. What I love about it is it kind of has a game board feeling to it. And it's playing with probably some sort of stamp that comes from one of these games that makes this kind of joker clown figure. And then just different textures. But it looks like almost like it's maybe a video game or a board game. It has that structure. So very nice piece here.
00:54:11.489 - 00:54:25.167, Speaker A: Nice texture. Just makes it look so easy. You wonder if this is pasted in. I do wonder that to myself, but maybe not. Maybe it's just different brushes depending on the software. Very cool here. It looks like a different software.
00:54:25.167 - 00:54:42.975, Speaker A: One imagines different ratio here too. And again, just more just kind of beautiful textures. These are both on Rodeo, by the way. You can get them. And 91 doing quite well, actually, on rodeo here. 91 minted on that one, 62 on that one. So I picked up both of those.
00:54:42.975 - 00:54:56.145, Speaker A: So cool work here. Kind of looks like a frog down there. And what was the title? Cosmic Pessimism. So more humor. This was great. Akseen who, of course I follow Impossible Spring. So doing some flowers here.
00:54:56.145 - 00:55:17.443, Speaker A: Here was Impossible Spring number one. And here Impossible Spring number two. Cool combination of different kinds of brushes and renderings. Here you see kind of kind of one bit rendering on. In the kind of negative space here on the shadow. But then here you see a larger brush. It pays to combine.
00:55:17.443 - 00:55:35.555, Speaker A: All right, back to combinate the power of combination, as I love to call it. Here's impossible. Spring number three. So kind of a different kind of series here from Xing doing flowers. Of course with Xing doing flowers, there'll be crying skulls here. Or skulls, I should say. So cool series here.
00:55:35.555 - 00:55:53.619, Speaker A: Not sure where it's going to be posted, but cool work by Aksin. Here's Mumble Boy. Can't remember who I am. Love the change in angle here. Kind of adds a real dynamism to the, you know, and just changes it up From Mumble Boy. Very prolific. Putting out a work almost every day.
00:55:53.619 - 00:56:20.617, Speaker A: It seems like I talked to Mumble Boy on the spaces. I think it's like one to three works a day. Amazingly and beautiful background here with the red and the purple and it almost looks like a figure if you kind of take a wide angle view here. Can't remember who I am. I love it. It's almost like a portrait of our inside inner space, so to speak. All of these fragments compositing to our consciousness.
00:56:20.617 - 00:56:45.493, Speaker A: Can't remember who I am. Great title. Here's Greg Nikshumika. Hudson feels that's too much. That's too much to feel. So as you'll see here using again, I think you'd call it Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or Google sheets, one of the two. Some sort of spreadsheet software as a canvas here and then turning it into a big landscape.
00:56:45.493 - 00:57:10.991, Speaker A: Pretty epic. 107 cells by, you know, quite a few on the other side, probably a couple hundred. So cool work there. That is five Tezos by Greg Nikshomika and I think how many are left here? One left at five Tezos. Here's the myth with some more awesome consumer products here. Action figure Tezos Legends the myth. Well, this is the thing.
00:57:10.991 - 00:57:37.183, Speaker A: I mean the myth could do a whole other series just with like, you know, based on what looks like Star wars action figures. I even recognize this kind of bottom area. This looks like it's based on a action figure. There is the ledger, cold wallet, a big knife and the lemonhead myth in the mask. Beautifully. With such care. The Myth Entertainments presents the myth Tezos Legends includes ledger and knife.
00:57:37.183 - 00:58:03.121, Speaker A: Kenner kind of reminds you of Star wars made in Argentina. Love it. Beautiful background color by the way. The background color to me sings the fun that the myth is having with this series. You see it with the Cheetos new Cheetos Rotten cheese edition of one for 300 tazos. Just another beautiful and just. I just love the spirit of these works.
00:58:03.121 - 00:58:23.565, Speaker A: And that beautiful kind of banana, light banana color in the background there. Beautiful color Choice as usual. 300 tezos. And here's an edition of one. And this was sold. This was minted two days ago. Sold for 180 tezos on object prisoner number 13.
00:58:23.565 - 00:58:39.553, Speaker A: Let's look at the eye. So a bit of a texture there in the mask. So a new myth work here. And yeah, playing with a yellow shirt and a black kind of wrestling mask of sorts. Not sure. Balaclava. Not sure.
00:58:39.553 - 00:58:54.639, Speaker A: Interesting background here too, with a little bit more kind of action with a mountain there we see the trademark clouds. Beautiful color as ever. Nice sale. Here is the taste. Hang in there. So interesting piece. Edition of 10.
00:58:54.639 - 00:59:22.305, Speaker A: And I think this sold out. So faces on the sheets here being hung up on a landscape here and kind of. And this sold out at 5 Tezos edition of TAM. Here is Pomelo the countryside and kind of a digital artwork here. As you see this figure and interesting lighting. Very digital kind of. You can see the semi opacity.
00:59:22.305 - 00:59:42.255, Speaker A: And you see kind of a ghost figure kind of crossing the lawn here of this. What looks like a church in the middle of a landscape. Nice kind of Halloween work. This is why you should not take a look at your windows at night in La Pampa. You'll be facing these kinds of situations. You might see things at the corner of your eyes. Edition of 20 and not listed yet.
00:59:42.255 - 01:00:12.635, Speaker A: Here's Frank Lepkowski. Hit and run. So more of these interesting paintings here. They seem to be based on photographs a little bit, don't they? But pretty interesting execution using what seems to be a kind of a gradient in the brush. Right. Like all which kind of adds a kind of dynamism to the work. And if you didn't have that gradient in each of these brushes, it would have a different effect.
01:00:12.635 - 01:00:29.915, Speaker A: So just kind of an interesting kind of impressionistic work. Interesting title created in my digital painting app. Very cool. And this sold out at five tazos. Let's continue. And here's OYO 66 edition of one at 15 tazos. Fire blossom.
01:00:29.915 - 01:00:45.155, Speaker A: So more new work, I believe. And look at this. Look at how detailed this is. Huge piece by kind of psychedelic illustrator. Cool background too, and fun subject matter. You know, spray painting a wall. Pretty cool piece.
01:00:45.155 - 01:01:13.223, Speaker A: 15 tazos now 20:58 minutes ago. And how much to go in this auction? How much time and one day to go? So now at 20 tazos. This is pretty cool. Monasubisuki. Someone retweeted this playing with old phones. Kind of like manga type of Drawing illustration here, but some little bit of texture here. So just a really cool.
01:01:13.223 - 01:01:44.183, Speaker A: Even the erased kind of hand, just adding. I think, I think it's physical, but this could actually be digital, which would make it actually all the more impressive that you can still kind of see the erase. Erase marks. It's a very fun way of working. You know, one experiment you can try is when you're painting is don't and digitally is don't use the erase tool. Right. So if you have you make something you want to change, you just paint over it, right.
01:01:44.183 - 01:02:05.993, Speaker A: And then maybe some of that previous work starts to just bleed through a little bit and that will often create a kind of more textured kind of work here. So interesting phones there too. So I believe a digital work. And here this is pretty interesting. The Sims 2000. I brought this up for the sake of argument. I've forgotten how detailed.
01:02:05.993 - 01:02:26.783, Speaker A: You know, we talk about video games a lot, but we don't actually see. Don't actually look at a ton of video game art. Maybe we should. But I don't mind bringing this in. You know, maybe it should be brought in every so often to remind us of what the graphics were like. This is pretty darn detailed, you know, as processing got better. This is 2000.
01:02:26.783 - 01:02:50.151, Speaker A: I mean it's pretty late in a sense and it shows and so it creates a different kind of look. And even the angle that we're looking at here, this isn't your typical kind of. I want to call it 45 degree diagonal view. This is more of like what looks like a 30 degree angle view or something. Also interesting street Simpsons. This is by perfect loop. Pretty interesting work here.
01:02:50.151 - 01:03:10.571, Speaker A: Addition of 100. Pretty fun work. And I assume this is from a Simpsons game that these are being taken out of. I don't know if this is two games put together, but you see the Simpsons beating up a car or trashing a car. Gif image. Addition of 100 for 5 tezos each. How many are left? And 62 owners.
01:03:10.571 - 01:03:36.471, Speaker A: So I mean almost bringing in like 300 tezos so far. Not bad. Not bad at all. Continuing on here is Anis Abden in memory of Peanut the squirrel. Okay, so there is the squirrel that was taking over social media. And there in front of a traffic light. Kind of a classic kind of pixel art move here, especially by Annis Abden with the red of the light in the snow.
01:03:36.471 - 01:03:50.859, Speaker A: And so just more beautiful work on a roll. It looks like it's going to pull off the 365 works in a year. Daily work Here, look at who's back. Hermipe Pixel art. And I wish I could. I'm sure I can make this bigger. We have to make this bigger.
01:03:50.859 - 01:04:11.335, Speaker A: Because what really stands out to me here is actually the bottom. These big pixels and then these tiny little pixels. And this highlights, for me a couple of things. Of course, we see the contrast. Very cool. You have to go up close to even notice that this is all still pixels. But it also highlights the nature of the tool.
01:04:11.335 - 01:04:39.427, Speaker A: Right, because the tool Hermipe is using is, oh, you got a big brush here, and then you got tiny brushes here. This isn't like, as, you know, Photoshop, for all of its amazingness, to get, like, a square brush. I'm not sure you can do that. Like, I had to put it this way. I had to do it, like, two or three years ago. I had to import or make my own brush with a square. And then I'm not even sure how hard or easy it was to make it bigger and smaller here.
01:04:39.427 - 01:05:03.879, Speaker A: You can tell it's just the nature. And I think of this. My point here is the software impacts the work. It's. It's the equivalent of the brush in traditional painting. As anybody that's painted with traditional, you know, made canvas. Canvases, the brush matters, especially if you're making kind of nice, you know, where you're celebrating the texture of the paint.
01:05:03.879 - 01:05:32.959, Speaker A: The brush is like half the battle. The other is, you know, your medium, how you're treating the paint, what are you painting with? This is stuff you have to learn on your own. So the software, in my world is the equivalent of the brush. And you could argue even, like, the medium that you put in the paint to make it extra thick and, you know, it creates its own dynamics in the image. So all to say, very cool work here. Dark Souls. Love the title.
01:05:32.959 - 01:06:05.971, Speaker A: Another work here by Kapan, putting together all the jams that were on rodeo into one giant work here. So reusing elements here wonderfully. And you can probably just see them here, all nine, you know, just put together in working with randomness. Right. It's like, oh, what happens when you juxtapose these? And you get like, this kind of wonderful, you know, collage, in a sense, digital collage. And, you know, and a beautiful reusing of the works to make a new work. I think it's Brilliant.
01:06:05.971 - 01:06:33.925, Speaker A: Soldier for 0.123. Wonderful system admin. This is by figments, also known as CAP. And so a kind of a smaller, simpler work here with kind of classic video game elements like a portal Here it's tempting to say, but here you have more of what looks like, you know, servers or something. Like a server tower or something. Here's someone who's meditating and then we see this energy going to the meditator, to the servers. Beautiful kind of.
01:06:33.925 - 01:06:54.765, Speaker A: And then here, just like this lone traveler with their dog, you know, accompanying dog. Very poetic. Poetic works now sold out at eight tazos. So again, bringing in maybe eight times 16, you know, 128 tazos. 100 bucks. Let's call it 90 bucks. Nice work, Chemicals.
01:06:54.765 - 01:07:10.845, Speaker A: And then doing that other sale with the on foundation for 0.12. That's probably another 200 bucks. This is good. This is real money Chemicals. This is by Braindead. This sold for 150 tazos. 90 bucks.
01:07:10.845 - 01:07:32.833, Speaker A: So here, just cool, like beaker, I guess. October is done and so now when did this come out? November 3rd. So just a nice simple pixel artwork here by Braindead. So doing quite well. Like there's a market for that. And nice beautiful colored gray background there. Here's Spookade by Chaz.
01:07:32.833 - 01:08:08.181, Speaker A: So continuing with the video game theme, here's like an arcade game having a Halloween theme. Classic kind of what used to be hard hat Mac kind of game here, but also could be Mario, you know, the original Mario brothers. Dating myself a little bit here. Two tezos, 58 minted so far. Let's continue. Figs from Plum Sergey Delgado. I thought this was interesting because I could be wrong, but this doesn't look like it is simply I, you know, hit the render button, move the slider and here it is.
01:08:08.181 - 01:08:19.445, Speaker A: I could be wrong. That could be what this is. But it looks like there's. Put it this way, it's a nice crop. It's. You zoom in and it. There does seem to be some manual work here, but I could be completely wrong about that.
01:08:19.445 - 01:08:33.487, Speaker A: Anyway, interesting looking piece, especially when you see the eye here. Just kind of nice rendering here. Here's mech. Txt. Of course I follow Michael Macasso. Look for that burst of energy. So another kind of classical looking work.
01:08:33.487 - 01:08:54.048, Speaker A: And again, looking pretty manual or at least, yeah, it's looking pretty manual. Different kinds of textured brushes here. An interesting background, kind of a powerful one here. Red and blue is the palette that Michael Macasso is using. You see it here too. Eurydice. Another classical theme, hand drawn pixel art.
01:08:54.048 - 01:09:13.684, Speaker A: There you go. 270 by 326 and then scaled up and this is now 40 tezos. And offers were taken in and sold at 25 tezos. Sold at 25 tezos on primary. So nice big rendering here for us to see. Everything so very cool. Eurydice.
01:09:13.684 - 01:09:54.668, Speaker A: Now, Eurydice trying to remember, was that Orpheus's. Isn't it Orpheus and Eurydice. And Eurydice is looking back here because Orpheus was it. Orpheus was taken to the Underworld or. No, it was Eurydice was taken to the Underworld. Orpheus went down to rescue her and all she had to do was not look back out of the Underworld and she would have been able to go back to the world of the living from Tartarus. And at the last moment, she looks back and is taken back into the shades, the land of the shades.
01:09:54.668 - 01:10:13.749, Speaker A: And I think that's what we see here is Eurydice looking back, if memory serves. This was interesting. I can't remember who posted this. Someone was posting this. Super interesting pixel artist here. Kind of has almost a Hermipe feel here and interesting lines here. Like, is this the.
01:10:13.749 - 01:10:30.797, Speaker A: It almost looks like a photo of a screen. Great texture here and I love the rendering here. Again, I'm seeing big pixels and small pixels. It's very powerful. Kind of big pixel brush and small pixel brush tinted. The colors are excellent too. Kind of reminiscent of a retro screen.
01:10:30.797 - 01:10:52.811, Speaker A: Here's another one. Momo Deadly Yuka. So again, almost a. It's hard to tell if the texture, like these lines are added after for effect or if it's being simulated. In other words, kind of looks like here, maybe it's being simulated because they're a little too perfect for a photo of a screen. Right. So interesting contrast too.
01:10:52.811 - 01:11:36.987, Speaker A: Of the different technologies, you have the digital with the big kind of pixelation, but then you have like these tiny little lines that almost look like the equivalent of an old TV screen or something, or computer screen. And those contrast, right? Like it's almost again the intention of the brush stroke. But then all the chaos within that brush stroke, you get that it's like the same kind of contrast or a similar kind of contrast. Where here you get the intention of the pixel art, but then you get kind of a chaotic element here with the vertical lines of the screen. Not worrying where they match up. Right. There's a chaotic element in there, so it kind of creates an analogous effect, I would argue.
01:11:36.987 - 01:11:56.855, Speaker A: Nicholas Sassoon Orbium Just a beautiful work here. More vertical kind of lines here, which I find kind of interesting. Nice colors and kind of giving a three dimensional feel. These kind of cycling. There's cycling gradients, but there's also this kind of. Yeah. And it looks like things are moving, but I think things are cycling through masks.
01:11:56.855 - 01:12:21.925, Speaker A: Hard to say. Anyways, beautiful work as usual from Nicholas Sassoon. Here's Gino Laps. So a beautifully textured work here. Great color and kind of looks like a landscape a little bit, but bordering on the edge of abstraction. This is called Lapse. And this is edition of 10, sold out at Five Tezos.
01:12:21.925 - 01:12:46.763, Speaker A: Nice work. Here is Bleak Two Mountain. And this is an edition of 13. And here another landscape using analog video glitch techniques. And here a bit more of a kind of movie style work here. As you see the camera moving, it's this great textured sky. And here is Ex Mortal, also selling out.
01:12:46.763 - 01:13:21.369, Speaker A: Edition of 15. And here you see is the water moving? Maybe the water's moving a little bit here, but otherwise a static landscape. And. But these beautiful lines. I mean it just feels infinite. The different kinds of glitches you can get in each. Like it's just like it's just a constant source or fountain of novel kind of imagery here that comes out or effects or types of impressions, visual impressions, you know, renderings.
01:13:21.369 - 01:13:37.713, Speaker A: You know, an infinite fountain of digital renderings of a certain kind. From Night Flow. This is Night Flow from X Mortal. This is called Night Flow. And this sold out at 1769. Edition of 15. I mean, what is that? That's like 150 bucks if I'm not mistaken.
01:13:37.713 - 01:13:59.857, Speaker A: Not bad. D Here is another work using I think analog video. And here it is, edition of 6. This is for Tazos, I think. Still available as you see the feedback behind the running figure here. And one sold so far, just listed two days ago. Here is Kiro Times Ranix Steer.
01:13:59.857 - 01:14:28.859, Speaker A: So cool collab here. I don't think there's volume and I assume this is an MP4. So again you see Ranix Steer type gradients, Kiro type. Kind of nice, simple and minimal video processing. Starting bit of 0.05. Here's Ranix steer posting a gradient work here. Just cool color combo and nice minimal gradients there.
01:14:28.859 - 01:14:59.015, Speaker A: Here's another one by Curo, I think it's called Camille, if I'm not mistaken. And here you see kind of a different kind of rendering here, often using AI as the source and then turning into these novel paintings. And again, it just feels endless. The amounts of possibilities that this kind of glitch technique, this video glitch technique provides. Edition of one. Only 13 tazos still available. MCHX SW121 November 3rd.
01:14:59.015 - 01:15:14.683, Speaker A: So I'm not sure if this Changes over time. Or if this is a still. I think it's a still, but sometimes these will change. Let's see. This is a jpeg. So this will soft wind edition of 10. So cool.
01:15:14.683 - 01:15:30.155, Speaker A: Very minimal gradient. I don't know if I'd call it gradient artist, but minimal Abstract artist. Mchx and selling five tazos. Selling out. Edition of ten. Nice work. Santiago Ruau, who of course I follow with a new work here.
01:15:30.155 - 01:15:41.001, Speaker A: Again, playing with these kind of gradient brushes here. Making an abstract. Almost looks like a tree, but I'd call it an abstract. Reishi Vibes. Not sure what Reishi is. That's on Zora. Very cool here.
01:15:41.001 - 01:15:54.817, Speaker A: And here's Renki Doso Kohama edition of one. And so playing. Continuing to play with the shapes and these cubes. Playing with blue. And again putting out work. What seems like daily a work. Here it is.
01:15:54.817 - 01:16:05.353, Speaker A: You even see the date. Just reminiscent of Picasso there. Putting the date in the last, you know, four. Four decades. Let's call it on the artworks. So edition of one. Not listed.
01:16:05.353 - 01:16:20.441, Speaker A: Here's Xerox Cycle Experiment 29. Kind of could be a work on its own. Very cool. Kind of animated abstract from Xerox, who of course I follow. That is a glitch on X. Human by definition here. ASCII Loops.
01:16:20.441 - 01:16:35.941, Speaker A: So this is pretty cool. And it looks like it just fits whatever the screen is here. It's square. So kind of a programming. And as you see here, there's all these instructions. Rtf. Shall we try R? Oh yeah.
01:16:35.941 - 01:16:49.145, Speaker A: Kind of resets and T. Not sure. Could be my keyboard. Could be my browser here. Oh yeah. But we're starting to get different kinds of stuff here. So interesting.
01:16:49.145 - 01:17:03.899, Speaker A: What is this? This is an interactive kind of programming work. ASCII Loops collection by human by definition. Designed for generating infinite seamlessly looping GIFs in dynamic text mode. Aesthetics. Pretty cool. Nice color scheme. Daniel Todd.
01:17:03.899 - 01:17:25.251, Speaker A: Should I mint more? Kind of what looks like kind of generative programming art here. And probably lower resolution for the GIF on. Probably the original is higher resolution, I imagine, but not sure. Kind of cool. Kind of gives that printing CMYK kind of look as we go into the AI. Here's time. The artist formerly known as Santiago.
01:17:25.251 - 01:17:47.803, Speaker A: So cool kind of AI machines here from Santiago. Nice border, by the way, the color. And almost like a peach here, but then nice peach down here. Nicely done. And here there's of course, I follow Santiago here you see the whole series beautifully laid out here. Very nice series. Such a prolific artist.
01:17:47.803 - 01:17:58.813, Speaker A: Great artist. Here's another one. Early history of car parts. Art feeling an engine might have. Addition of 5 for 25 tezos. And here is. You can see all of the detail.
01:17:58.813 - 01:18:08.445, Speaker A: So interesting AI art series. Great negative space, beautiful color in the background. Really well executed. And three gone at 25 tezos each. Mr. K. Picking up two.
01:18:08.445 - 01:18:30.589, Speaker A: Nice work. Skomra. Early Autumn woods. And here we are in AI territory again. Stable diffusion textures and just a beautiful, you know, look inside a forest. A scene we're all kind of familiar with. Almost looks like autumn with leaves on the ground, but then I guess the leaves are green here, so hard to say.
01:18:30.589 - 01:18:49.819, Speaker A: Early Autumn woods edition of 10. Did that sell out. And sold out at 3. 33. Nice work. Here's RJ with a few works, and we get a window into RJ's process here. Here is kind of an AI, what looks like an AI animation, right? So life is a glitch in time.
01:18:49.819 - 01:19:08.499, Speaker A: Reboot, reboot. And then we go here, and then we see, oh, here's the processed version, right? You will not reboot. Life is a glitch in time. And then here, kind of more digital pixelation, shall we call it a different kind of texture. And they're a cool laptop. AI laptop. And a figure and everything.
01:19:08.499 - 01:19:36.917, Speaker A: And then slightly different rendering of the text. And then here is another work by rj. We got a few this weekend that were posted. And then just this kind of shimmering composition. Here's a static one. Really nice in here in the plants, and kind of looks like a figure maybe doing some stretches, some yoga or something. But again, just great textures here in the plant, the figure, the architecture.
01:19:36.917 - 01:20:02.447, Speaker A: And here this one is animated. And again, so you see just different textures being brought on, maybe bringing that into stable diffusion, perhaps. And then you get a couple of different renderings, three or four different renderings. Turn that into a gif, right? And here another work. So lots. It's a different kind of feeling work. And these kind of stripes almost looking like poles, but maybe just the artwork itself.
01:20:02.447 - 01:20:22.525, Speaker A: Just pulling across this figure here gives a nice poetic effect. Interesting color. And another one, rj tripping and falling. This one, much more digital, we could say, but perhaps based on AI source. And we see this person falling. So just interesting work here from rj. You know, posting on X first.
01:20:22.525 - 01:20:36.151, Speaker A: Maybe not a bad way to do it. If you're making a ton of work. You post on X, you see what gets the nice result, and then you kind of know what to do, maybe when you list it. Here's Eilay. Chaos theory number one. So cool. AI artworks from Ayla.
01:20:36.151 - 01:20:51.303, Speaker A: Nice background color. Kind of looks like a drawing, doesn't it? And beautifully kind of half colored drawing. Almost non finito. It is non finito. Chaos Theory 2. Here are some balloons here. And again kind of a nice painterly kind of textures in here.
01:20:51.303 - 01:21:04.507, Speaker A: So nice color as well. Beautiful gray, white and then a little bit of color there. Addition of five. This looks sold out at 222. And then here's Toques. A house for shadows and memories. Kind of another mysterious AI artwork.
01:21:04.507 - 01:21:18.015, Speaker A: Typical Toques colors here. Kind of nice bright digital colors here. Interesting AI piece. And these great gradients. Amazing. I wonder if that's all text prompt. I think it probably is.
01:21:18.015 - 01:21:42.733, Speaker A: Palm Springs Romantics. This is on super rare by Robness V3 and I believe this is new. A new AI artwork from Robness V3 and I think it's pretty cheap for Robness work. So cool kind of pool AI artwork and for 246 buy now $246 or 0.1 eth. And I'm pretty sure this is new. November 2nd.
01:21:42.733 - 01:21:57.961, Speaker A: So interesting on super Rare. Here's no hygiene. More just kind of experimental, wild out of this world. AI art as you see here. Just super interesting work. Another one by no hygiene. Pretty cool.
01:21:57.961 - 01:22:20.965, Speaker A: I mean just really, you know, shocking work. I dare say me fella, look at this. Love, love, love this. So this looks physical, this looks knitted and this looks like doom or something. The figure in doom going into some like villa here, some Italian villa. What a. What a work.
01:22:20.965 - 01:22:42.385, Speaker A: Powerful, amazing, shocking, surprising. You know, you look at the nit, it all seems so innocent. And then you have this video game reference. Super interesting. Here's Terminator 2. Andrew park with a painting, I think of Terminator 2. This is from It's Not Gallery, the sensational gallery on Instagram, but maybe in the real world too.
01:22:42.385 - 01:23:14.065, Speaker A: I'm not sure. They might just be an Instagram gallery. But again, one of the hottest galleries, I'd say in the world. Like what does that mean? And as you see here, like just there's a brilliant curator like whoever is running it's not gallery's account is a brilliant curator. Like one of the great curators in the world, I would argue. And probably, you know, that is their recognition is it's not gallery. Like if I ran the MoMA, I'd be like tell me who this person is and invite them over to do a show.
01:23:14.065 - 01:23:34.229, Speaker A: Or the Whitney maybe would be more appropriate. It like let's continue Societe Berlin or Society Berlin. Very cool gallery here. In Berlin, they sometimes show Petra Courtright. For those that know Petra Courtright's digital paintings. So kind of an edgy gallery here. Nice piece.
01:23:34.229 - 01:23:47.271, Speaker A: I didn't even know that was Societe or Society Berlin. Nice piece. Bobici Matia. I thought this. So this is 2024 aliens. Look at how great this is. It reminds you of Basquiat.
01:23:47.271 - 01:24:05.823, Speaker A: And it's just. Can do anything. Like waffles. I can just do anything and it's gonna look good. The freedom here, this is like the ideal for me as an artist is where you can just start having fun and it all looks good. That kind of is the vibe that you get off of Baba Chic. Matija can just do whatever.
01:24:05.823 - 01:24:16.155, Speaker A: You could put the work. The marks here, you can not put it. You can make it double the head. Double here you can not. In the silhouette, you can make it. You know, it's just amazing. It's just awesome.
01:24:16.155 - 01:24:34.898, Speaker A: Here's Scott can at David Zwerner. So interesting painting here from David Zwerner. Probably in New York, but maybe it's Paris. Not sure which. I think there's more than one gallery. Interesting kind of double moon here. Almost looks like the MasterCard.
01:24:34.898 - 01:24:44.545, Speaker A: MasterCard logo. Beautiful work. Stunning. Great color. Here's another work. Chashmish Kahiki Molting. Morning.
01:24:44.545 - 01:24:59.085, Speaker A: Really interesting artist. Acrylic on canvas. This is at Saatchi Gallery. The walls between us. So I assume that's the. Yeah, so it's funny, I think I know this artist. Their work from Instagram.
01:24:59.085 - 01:25:11.797, Speaker A: So it's interesting to see they're at Saatchi Gallery. Just really nice work here. 24 by 36, acrylic. And of course, Nugget Brain. The awesome Nugget Brain with some more works here. Just fantastic. Hulkamania.
01:25:11.797 - 01:25:26.653, Speaker A: Just again, another artist that feels like you just can't. They can't do wrong whatever they do. Even this world map. Oh, is it not finished? Who cares? Looks great. Let's just. They could keep working on it and it would look great. They could stop and it looks great too.
01:25:26.653 - 01:25:43.023, Speaker A: HP Love bucks. So here is the finished painting here of the monster truck rally. Just pretty radical. Looks like a black canvas, right? And then so black underpainting. Here's Ochie Shohei. I don't think I showed this one. Very edgy.
01:25:43.023 - 01:25:58.953, Speaker A: Kind of different style here with this spray paint over top of the Haribo gummy bears. Super cool here. And PB Universal. Very interesting piece here. Don't know how this was made. At first I thought it was. It's not gallery.
01:25:58.953 - 01:26:06.501, Speaker A: And I was like, no, it's peepee. Okay. Awesome. Beautiful. Whatever you're doing here. Super duper interesting. Smooth.
01:26:06.501 - 01:26:20.101, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's continue. Walk Zuck. Another brilliant portrait. And the spray here. Again, masterfully done from walk here. Brilliant portrait.
01:26:20.101 - 01:26:39.135, Speaker A: And that is your show, my friends. So shows will be sporadic from here. There's not. I'm going to be on a train on Wednesday during the normal space, so things are going to get sporadic. Let me get settled in Bangkok. And so this is probably the last show for the week. I will try and do a show early next week.
01:26:39.135 - 01:26:42.695, Speaker A: Thank you for all your support. And until next time, take care.
