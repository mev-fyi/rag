00:00:02.840 - 00:00:25.074, Speaker A: We are back. It is a ginormous, monstrous show today. I'm not quite sure how we're going to get through all of it, but we're going to go as quickly as possible here on this beautiful, sunny day in inner space. I can see. I don't see physical reality. I see a ship, and I see beautiful, sunny reflections on the water, a couple of clouds in the sky. It is great weather.
00:00:25.074 - 00:00:46.310, Speaker A: Not sure what's going on out here outside the window, but I know where I am. Artist journal, November 20, 2023. Broadcasting from deep in inner space, sunny inner space. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Welcome back. And again, we'll probably just have to, you know, as. As always, we're gonna have to run through this and make it, you know, just do our best.
00:00:46.310 - 00:01:08.302, Speaker A: We're gonna do our best. As we always, as I always do, and as you always do, as we always do, my friends. So let's begin, of course, go Golitis. Many of you have seen this before. This weekend, it was hard not to look at basically a version 2.0 of the reality simulator device. And let's actually just quickly look at the title.
00:01:08.302 - 00:02:07.894, Speaker A: Am I an AI? So just for your information, remember this work, which came out, I believe, in February, February 6, and right around that time, we did a Twitter space runetune and I. And what was so interesting about that is go go Litus was saying that this was similar to, basically, Plato's cave allegory of the cave from Republic book seven, famously, in what's sometimes called the first novel, interestingly, of all time, or of the, at least of the western tradition with Plato's Republic. Interestingly, I think that might be an overstatement, but it's not crazy. It's not crazy at all, actually. So I brought up here a quick. So the allegory of the cave, which actually is important, basically, gogolitis was saying this work here, this 1.0 version of what we were just looking at, was basically an allegory of the cave.
00:02:07.894 - 00:02:37.774, Speaker A: You see the circuit tree almost like Descartes. Descartes brain in the bathtub, right? Where it's like you have the bathtub full of chemicals and you have a brain. And basically, that's our situation. You know, you have some, like, wires coming out of it, and that's us. And really our whole illusion of, you know, being in the physical world is just us in a vat of chemicals. Kind of similar to that as well. And so very quickly, on the allegory of the cave, actually, we don't need to read all this.
00:02:37.774 - 00:03:24.102, Speaker A: So, basically, the allegory of the cave is people are in a cave, and they are chained up, and they're looking at a wall, and there are shadows on the wall that are flickering because there's a fire behind them, and then there's things passing back and forth in front of the fire. It's almost kind of surprisingly complicated, if you ask me. I would have actually framed it differently. I would say there's an entrance to the cave, and then people are walking by the entrance, and the light coming in is flickering against the wall. Whatever. There's a fire behind, and then things are coming in front of the fire, but behind the people who are looking towards the wall, so they don't see the fire. All they see is the shadows, and they think, that's reality, okay? And then someone gets freed, comes back and tells the others, hey, that's not reality.
00:03:24.102 - 00:04:08.078, Speaker A: And then they're mocked and shamed by those people who are sitting there. And so kind of a, you know, just a lesson in, you know, because, of course, Plato had a, you know, bone to pick about Socrates being put to death and basically saying, well, that's Soc. That's what happened to Socrates. He was telling you what was actually going on, and you guys killed him because you couldn't handle it, you know, so interesting. So, all to say, gogolitis was basically mentioning this as kind of an allegory of the cave. So here's 2.0. Am I in AI? Am I in artificial intelligence? Which, of course, is the topic of the weekend, really, AI, with everything that happened there at OpenAI.
00:04:08.078 - 00:04:33.806, Speaker A: And so let's just look at it. So the brain is circuit board. We see this quite beautifully minimal processor here. I love how minimal this processor is. There's just four little pixels that are kind of blinking here, and these wonderful colors, which, as you saw from the 1.0 in February, continue to evolve here. And you really do see what seems to be an evolution here as this seems to get more and more.
00:04:33.806 - 00:05:04.034, Speaker A: It's almost like this is the HD version, as you see by what looks like a 16 nine ratio here. It looks like it would fit a tv perfectly. And you get all these beautiful kind of almost metrics are being. Biometrics are being figured out, sliders, all these little devices here. And you got to love the little tracer on this work here. And then it's almost like all the vital signs of the AI and here. And then this is going.
00:05:04.034 - 00:05:43.214, Speaker A: One of the things that makes Googleitis animation so great is they go along different cycles. This will be going faster than this will be going slower, and this will be going in between. And then, of course, the circuitry kind of electrifying through the work is also going at a different speed. So all of it just creates the sense of life, the sense of artificial intelligence. This AI with these stunning colors, these very subtle, stunning colors here. So a brilliant work by gogolitis to get us started here and the way it works. If you've already collected some gogolitis and you have ten pieces, you can put an offer in, you don't have much time.
00:05:43.214 - 00:06:02.214, Speaker A: Almost. I do it right away because it goes for sale at 06:00 p.m. European time, which is basically noon in New York. So you don't have a ton of time. 28 tezos. If you don't, then I guess you are at the mercy of the market, and it'll be listed for only 30 tezos. So I imagine it'll go within a minute or two.
00:06:02.214 - 00:06:27.504, Speaker A: So cool work from Gogolitis. Taking a look at the comments, and thank you for all the comments there on screensavers as artists House of the model. Thank you, poco. I really appreciate the further elaboration on Lorna Mills and need to simmer on your reflections on the role of art criticism in the culture. I really appreciate the comments of my audio visual piece for the ONBD sound and vision exhibition. Very cool. Nice people.
00:06:27.504 - 00:07:18.052, Speaker A: So, yeah, the role of art criticism, it is kind of a mixed role because you still want to have the venue, the, you know, of people being able to say stuff, and why shouldn't they? And it's kind of an important role. But put it this way. I mean, the problem I have, I'll tell you, the people who I pay attention to who say things about art are artists. The people I pay attention to who say stuff about books or novels are other novelists, because I feel like they have a certain credibility. Put it this way. Let me reverse what I'm saying. People who haven't written a novel, who are commenting on novels, to me, have a huge credibility gap because they don't understand the day to day.
00:07:18.052 - 00:08:03.748, Speaker A: It's all abstract. They haven't suffered, in a sense, Lorna Mills here. Hard won experience. If you listen to that Twitter space, as many of you have, the Lorna Mills insights, to me, were clearly from experience. And there is a credibility that comes with kind of having suffered the scars and the wounds of actually trying to make an art career right, or actually writing a novel, getting it published, and then people liking it these are not like a lot of people would like to do that. And it's really not easy. So when people have done that, you know, put themselves on the line as you do as an artist or a novelist, you know, artist in the grand sense, you put yourself, your ego on the line.
00:08:03.748 - 00:08:57.754, Speaker A: And even there, there is vulnerability that maybe an art critic who's just safely away opining, giving their, you know, thoughts on everything might not really, they just don't have that, you know, so there's a credibility gap. That's all I'm saying. I think anybody should be able to say anything they want, but we shouldn't. Well, maybe not anything, but we shouldn't, but we don't need to give them credibility, let's put it that way. I mean, it's sort of like, it's almost like the whole freedom of speech but not of reach. But you don't have to listen or believe anything that's being said, say, by someone like Jerry Saltz. So it's an interesting, put it this way, again, I give precedence and more credibility to artists talking about art because they actually seem to come from sense of knowing a bit more about it and about the difficulties of doing that.
00:08:57.754 - 00:09:29.204, Speaker A: Skomra, great show. You made a quick comment about Lorna Mill's nature work. I had never focused on that theme in her work until you mentioned it. Now that you pointed out, it balances out some of the more extreme work, which I like, too. And maybe that makes that more extreme work more appealing. Yeah, and I don't really show too much the extreme work here, but I do it just because it's like a family show. But, you know, again, we was reading and we'll actually see references to like Hans Bellmer coming up in a second here.
00:09:29.204 - 00:10:04.676, Speaker A: It doesn't, you know, I've read sad in the 120 days and, yeah, like, I mean, there's something to be said. It's very interesting. And of artists kind of unflinchingly kind of looking at a kind of truth of sorts that's happening on the Internet. So, but it does kind of just give her range of sorts. And, you know, and maybe it's just, I actually like the, as far as the nature work, I just think it's really beautiful and works really well with her process. There's something which is kind of interesting in itself, so. But yeah, I, again, I pretty much agree entirely with what you're saying here.
00:10:04.676 - 00:10:33.364, Speaker A: Skamra, it's interesting to think about the larger works getting split up into smaller gifts for the blockchain I wonder if there are any other artists who have made a similar accommodation. It really works for her, but I'm not sure it would work for many other artists. It's an interesting question. I mean, I've made a lot of work that I wouldn't have made without having gotten into the NFT scene. And it's like the pixel art sketchbook. And even now I just actually put something on chain on bitcoin. We'll look at it in a second here.
00:10:33.364 - 00:11:04.820, Speaker A: And I wouldn't be working so small and being so obsessive about small file size if not for being on the blockchain. Yeah. So I think a lot of people, and anybody, in a sense, can adjust what they're doing for the blockchain so you can always make another series. It really works for her, but I'm not sure it'd work for many other artists. I'll be excited to re listen to your Twitter space with her once it hits Spotify. Indeed, and it should this week. Thanks for showing my work.
00:11:04.820 - 00:11:20.326, Speaker A: You're welcome. I think we got another one. Skomra. Just the role continues here. Chepki, great show, as usual. I went to Anselm by Vim vendors yesterday, so, referring to Anselm Kiefer, have you seen it? No, I hadn't even heard of it. I think Vim venders actually lives in Berlin, if I'm not mistaken.
00:11:20.326 - 00:12:11.584, Speaker A: Mistaken, or at least has a home here. I was blown away. I knew the work of Anselm Kiefer, but the ateliers and working environments are out of this world. I saw a documentary about ten years ago, in 2013 or so, when I was in Toronto. I remember watching an Anselm Kieffer and being actually really impressed at the massiveness of the themes like order and chaos and, you know, and then seeing him hack away at some, like, massive, enormous painting, you know, on the side of a barn, basically. And I remember being really impressed. But you know what's weird about Anselm Kieffer is weirdly, I saw some work recently at the hamburger ban off here, and I found it weirdly kind of sentimental, kind of melodramatic and over sentimental, and almost those same things that impressed me originally.
00:12:11.584 - 00:12:55.872, Speaker A: I kind of wasn't buying as much. And even the aesthetic process, the technical side, the technical side of things, the technical poetry, I'm tempted to call it, didn't appeal. Like, it didn't seem to be standing up. Interestingly for me, at least in that particular work I saw at Hamburg, Banoff there. So I've kind of grown a lot of artists over time. You kind of grow more skeptical of Anselm keeper is one of them for me. But I'm, you know, I don't really look at the work all the time or anything, but again, kind of overly dramatic is it's kind of got a melodrama to me to a certain degree, but the ateliers and working environments are out of this world.
00:12:55.872 - 00:13:17.434, Speaker A: Maybe something to discuss in your show. No student size for Anselm. You know, interestingly, I actually have been to an art fair. I think it was in Toronto again, probably ten years ago. And I remember seeing actually pretty small, maybe 30 centimeter Anselm kefir, just kind of like, you know, work on paper. I think it was like a few thousand. Was it $20,000 or was it like two? It was probably 20.
00:13:17.434 - 00:13:32.634, Speaker A: So I, and that work I was actually quite impressed by. So, yeah, interesting. I hadn't heard of that. That sounds interesting. With regards to raficianadol, I would say his success has. Interesting than the work. His success is the artwork.
00:13:32.634 - 00:14:08.024, Speaker A: You know what the problem with this argument is, though, because you often hear it of like, kind of musicians, like, you know, that you might not love getting to the top of the charts and then go, oh, but look at how successful she is, therefore she must be good. Or he. Right. I'm thinking of Lady Gaga there because I was quite skeptical when Lady Gaga came out. I was like, what is this? And why is it so popular? Like, what are the corporate, you know, what are the corporations trying to send our way? What are they trying to program us with this time? And then this is the answer I get. But look at how successful she is. So she must be good.
00:14:08.024 - 00:14:39.964, Speaker A: So just kind of interesting. The aesthetics seem to be extremely reliant on one specific tool developed by insidium called x particles. So really interesting. So one software, nevertheless, he has created a podium for himself, and it is working. Yeah. I mean, again, to me, this is not a defense of the art, though. Like, what I would have liked at the end of the day is a stronger defense of what he was doing and why it mattered to him, why he thinks it matters.
00:14:39.964 - 00:14:59.234, Speaker A: There wasn't too much of that. And so again, it does kind of raise a few flags here. And in a sense, this comment doesn't really help the argument either. But, you know, whatever. Interesting, interesting comment. Thank you. Chapke Silieri, AIGM, everybody.
00:14:59.234 - 00:15:20.260, Speaker A: As always, thanks for these jewels. Absolutely glad you enjoyed the show. And Rata Yankee, thanks a lot, Adrian. I feel less ignorant after this. Well, a humbling comment from the great rat a Yankee, the great pixel artist that got most of us into this biz to begin with in, you know, collecting and whatever. For the first time, screensavers is art. Okay, a few more comments here.
00:15:20.260 - 00:15:30.468, Speaker A: Thank you. Nagar, thank you for mentioning my works. Great show, Daenerys. Love the way you say el Buho. You gotta work on my Spanish. And Michael Hughes, great to hear from you. Appreciate the feature.
00:15:30.468 - 00:15:39.224, Speaker A: Twice today. Thank you. Good to see you. Took my tweet with a pinch of salt. Yeah, we can't take things as they say. Life's too serious to take too seriously. One of my favorite sayings.
00:15:39.224 - 00:15:55.958, Speaker A: So yeah, all in good fun, as I wrote to Michael. And really cool to discover your work. Michael Infinite, yay. Thank you for the comments. Chrome, chepke, Melaya, great to see your work as well. And libroblock, toddy, and Almar. Everything has been done before.
00:15:55.958 - 00:16:25.190, Speaker A: So the screensavers as art has already been discussed. Again, I found it kind of a labored argument, this idea that screensavers are as art, but I'm not a huge generative art guy, so I could see the generative art people being like, this is a precursor, really, to a lot of generative art, or at least kind of along the lines of generative art. So maybe fair enough. And thank you. So's Weber to you and y two k. Thank you for the comments. Sky Goodman, there is going to be a new so a lot's happened since we last talked.
00:16:25.190 - 00:16:38.062, Speaker A: It's official. The next community Tezos event is coming. Mark the date. December 4 to 8th. Screensavers, edition of ten to 20, ranging from two to five tezos only. So these are the rules here. Keep it affordable, keep it fun.
00:16:38.062 - 00:17:16.950, Speaker A: Show us your take on a screensaver. This will be our hashtag, screensaver tez. So if you're looking for new collectors, if you're looking to get your work out there, kind of, it's really these little Tezos events. Community events are wonderful for discoverability because people will look for the hashtag and they'll just see what's available. So if you're looking to build your collector base and everything, that is a great way to do it. Some screensavers from xcene for your outrageously vertical mobile devices here. And so just kind of funny work here from Oxyn.
00:17:16.950 - 00:17:48.942, Speaker A: You know what this, this is actually what I wanted to point out here. You see these pixels, how some look kind of hor. You know what this looks like to me? And I could be totally wrong. This looks like an awkward export. Like, when you say you have, like, a 200 by 100 pixel file in Photoshop, and then you exported at 140%, let's say, and then it doesn't match perfectly. Like, it kind of has to fit into a different ratio. Sometimes you'll get these kind of stretched out kind of horizontal or vertical pixels.
00:17:48.942 - 00:18:12.950, Speaker A: Kind of reminds me of that a little bit. So just interesting. Really nice pixelation in here. Kind of creates this organic, pixelated feel. So this work here, this is Katya Kazakhina, the art detective. And again on her, on her Instagram, how dealer Leo Konig scored the steal of this $2.2 billion auction season.
00:18:12.950 - 00:18:36.512, Speaker A: So the steal was this Gerhard Richter. And I kind of bring this up because I have friends who are like, what's the deal with these? Gerhard Richter stretched out, you know, it looks like one pixel stretched out. Like, come on. Like. And then this was the, you know, and so this was the work. And I believe it sold for a million dollars. I'll quickly, just a little preamble here.
00:18:36.512 - 00:19:23.888, Speaker A: The November 2023 auction season is behind us. Trepidation filled the air heading into it. Will the secondary market collapse under the weight of economic volatility and geopolitical turmoil? Will it shrug off current events, as it had so many times in the past and continue marching to its own rarefied tune? This market still has a heartbeat. Sometimes it raced like crazy, others, not so much. So saying heroic, though, given recent performances by Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips, and a massive arsenal here. So a lot was riding on this auction. But I think it's interesting that this work by Gerhard Richter, monumental strip painting on Sotheby's website, slated to be sold during its contemporary art evening sale, estimated at two to $3 million.
00:19:23.888 - 00:20:04.326, Speaker A: The 2015 work, this is prominently displayed at the booth of Marion Goodman Gallery art Basel in 2016. Priced at €3 million, it was acquired by a chinese mogul, Liu Yuchain, and then Koenig made a $1 million offer, I believe, for it, he offered $1 million, as you see at the bottom here. I was very surprised to see a work of that importance come up at the auction, Koenig said. And so I am a dealer, Koenigset. I'm going to buy something in the shrewdest way possible. My number was low in comparison to what this work would be on the primary market. He offered half the low estimate.
00:20:04.326 - 00:20:34.938, Speaker A: I was pretty sure they'd tell me to go away. To his surprise, they didn't. And I never I never thought they were for mere mortals. Now I own one of them and maybe just, you know, at the end of the day, you know, everybody's just people like, people who work at these institutions, people who run these big galleries. They're people like you or me, as far as I'm concerned. And so, you know, that's why this thing went for like half of the bid. And you could argue he paid too much.
00:20:34.938 - 00:20:53.224, Speaker A: You know, some people would argue that. So all to say, I mean, Koenig is bullish on Richter's market here, and so. But, yeah, just kind of interesting. I thought that sale. This was very interesting, too. This is by Alpha Centauri kid. Let's go to the video here.
00:20:53.224 - 00:21:19.080, Speaker A: Pretty good. Pretty cool looking physical here by Alpha Centauri here. So doing the unwrap, which is pretty smart. Two of three, artist proof. You see the AP there? That's artist proof, if you can see that AP, two of three. So I guess there will be more additions. You know, the artist proof can be controversial.
00:21:19.080 - 00:21:55.372, Speaker A: How many do you do? Some people would say any more than three is pretty controversial. Some people will do up to five, you know, but it does become. It kind of looks like it's on aluminum, doesn't it? Which is not a. Which is an interesting way to print. I've never actually tried it, but I'm sure it's pretty vibrant in terms of your colors here that I guess that is Alpha Centauri kid. So interesting just to see more physicals here and avante art are the people who put it together here, as you can see. So as you see here, we make and sell fine art prints and sculptures in collaboration with artists.
00:21:55.372 - 00:22:23.084, Speaker A: So interesting. If you're looking to get your work out there in physical form, look at Martin Brooks oil painting, oil on canvas with this really funky snake here. Just really interesting. Bold decision making and just really interesting. It kind of looks like a Martin Bruck, doesn't it? Like a digital version. So even the colors, the spray here, even just the gradient in the background. Just a very original artist there.
00:22:23.084 - 00:22:36.966, Speaker A: Santiago Ruao. Here I am preparing for a collective exhibition coming soon. So we saw some of these as physicals, I believe, on our zora. There are some. And so here's a physical. Looks pretty good. And here's tornado.
00:22:36.966 - 00:23:18.314, Speaker A: Rodriguez found an old notebook and really nice kind of black and whites here. And just a really cool, nice drawing. Tornado now here. And we have Bellmer up because we were looking at this work here by Martin Joe and I was like, this looks like Bellmer Hans Bellmer, who doesn't really get too many shows, was still controversial to this day with all of these dolls and everything. And let me just see if we can go back. So this is Hans Bellmer, a german artist, kind of grouped in with the surrealists. And we'll see.
00:23:18.314 - 00:23:38.072, Speaker A: Here's some kind of. Looks like that over here. I don't want to make it too big, so we don't get censored by Twitter. But yeah, uses these dolls and was a very controversial. Even to this day, he doesn't really get retrospectives. There is something at the Met. So, I mean, he is still shown.
00:23:38.072 - 00:23:54.312, Speaker A: There's something by Tate here, so. But it's not put on the front page. Let's put it that way. Or on the posters. And here, this is what I was starting with here. What a fun series. Just got back to Montreal.
00:23:54.312 - 00:24:30.762, Speaker A: Time to get off these, off to their next homes. And so just more beautiful work here from eitso, this beautiful portrait series on Polaroids. Seeing them all together, the wood background kind of helps too, doesn't it? If I make a one of one as an NFT and the same as a three print on 25 editions, it's okay or not okay. In other words, if I make a digital one of one, can I sell an edition of 25 editions as an a three print? I think you can. That's what I do. And that's why I actually had that other page up here. I'll show you in a second.
00:24:30.762 - 00:24:42.786, Speaker A: I agree with stippin. It's all good here. Another? Yes. Number one signed edition for holder of one of one. I saw others. So that's kind of a different idea. I think you should be able to do it.
00:24:42.786 - 00:25:01.636, Speaker A: Look at this art trade app. You'll soon be able to sell 25 physical editions in NFT, only available on one of one. So not okay. You know, I think it's okay. And I mean, it's an interesting discussion. I mean, I was bringing it up here. Let's see if I can find what I had here.
00:25:01.636 - 00:25:27.204, Speaker A: I was bringing up my page because I actually do this. So as you see here. So here's a. This is actually a physical, but I will have a digital version of that. I think I have a digital version earlier here. Let me just show you here. This is the NFT.
00:25:27.204 - 00:26:00.934, Speaker A: This is digital iPhone X and MacBook. But I'll make huge screen prints. For example, this is a nice big screen print where I think the process itself kind of justifies it printed out and then you screen print over top. I see them as different kind of iterations of the concept and then I'll even do remixes. So I see nothing wrong with this. I've done it with many of my screen memories works here, as you see. Here's remixes of that.
00:26:00.934 - 00:26:19.914, Speaker A: So I don't see anything wrong. I agree with stippin pixel here. Interesting. If anybody else has other opinions on this, uh, you know, interesting question. Walk normalized working 50 seconds. So replying to Ezra Eslin, normalize working 50 hours on an artwork. Walk normalize working 50 seconds.
00:26:19.914 - 00:26:32.930, Speaker A: Almost became a meme here. Sabato normalized working 50 minutes on an artwork. So I say all of the above. Normalized 50 years working on an artwork. So all hilarious. Just a funny comment. I say all of the above.
00:26:32.930 - 00:26:57.266, Speaker A: Robnis I wish super rare had a comment section under the art now. I think we see this on Zora, don't we? It can be a tab, but it would be pretty hilarious. Not sure how much to stop the overt spam on there. Maybe make people pay ten to $0.20 for a comment. And actually down here said maybe make it a rare token thing, the super rare token, which gives you incentive to have the token beyond the staking. You know, I don't know if the staking works yet.
00:26:57.266 - 00:27:27.760, Speaker A: Like, I don't know if anybody has actually gotten a payout on any of it because I feel like I've staked with some artists and then they've sold. I haven't really seen a payout on there, but I guess I need to revisit the page. And so just. Only reason I say it is because it can add to the discussion of the actual artwork in a new and modern way. And I do think that's a cool idea. It almost becomes part of the history of the art in a interesting sort of way. It's a way of participating, kind of being a part of that art piece to a certain degree.
00:27:27.760 - 00:27:53.952, Speaker A: If you want to put your comment in and kind of be locked in there, and then again you do it with the rare token, maybe it becomes like blockchain related. So it actually is there kind of forever, but again, could invite spam. But anyways, interesting comment. Walk. God bless Zora. Never seen bad work on the homepage and I kind of echo that they've done a really good job. I think it was Zack is if not one of the main people, if not the main person curating that.
00:27:53.952 - 00:28:37.498, Speaker A: So nice work, Zack from walk, as well as from over here, art gnome. For those keeping score at home in the last few weeks, we've seen in public criticism, we've seen public criticism of NFTs and or digital art from Elon Musk, the Simpsons and Jerry Saltz. Just four years ago, in 2019, this would have been mind blowing. Things changed so fast, it's hard to see it happening. So putting things into context here, courtesy of art nomenclature and Sabato chiming in here, this is a good sign because none of these are considered cool anymore. If the relics of time past are the ones criticizing, you're probably doing something new and beyond them. And I thought this was interesting as well, in the context of Elon Musk, made by human.
00:28:37.498 - 00:29:07.470, Speaker A: So a rocket went up, of course, over the weekend. But I thought to myself, here's Elon Musk almost posting art. Almost posting art. I mean, kind of interesting, almost this violet, it almost looks like art. And I thought that was kind of interesting. Rip cash responding to Patrick Amadon I bet this space shifts to artists releasing full shows once or twice a year instead of individual pieces consistently. So, from Patrick Amadon, I sure hope not is sort of my take.
00:29:07.470 - 00:29:48.764, Speaker A: What's beautiful about the single images coming out is it's kind of like, from an entrepreneurial point of view, it's failing fast. It's not like, you know, as they say, you want to do like a small version of your concept, whatever your business is, and you want to see if there's any traction, and if there's not, you want to maybe change it from a business perspective. So I actually really find the iterative just putting a workout here and there. You can group everything at the end and then put out a solo show, so to speak. But I quite like the format here because it allows, it's kind of more open. You can see what works. It doesn't make you go, okay, I'm going to spend six months or a year on a project, and then it falls flat.
00:29:48.764 - 00:30:33.258, Speaker A: Right? Someone was mentioning that the other day. You know, it's nice we got this real time response. Maybe it was retro. Manny Ripcash replies crypto artists closely tied to social media. Interestingly, the timeline as medium favors a constant stream of perpetual output, which kind of made me think, you know, maybe two or 300 years from now, they'll probably have the social media feedback as part of the, you know, solo, the retrospective or whatever it is, the big show that they have of a ripcash show, you know, 200 years from now, they'll show the timeline, which is kind of interesting. The artist timeline is as much a part of the art as each minted piece. Crypto allows for the creation of immutable digital artifacts, moments, snapshots of the timeline.
00:30:33.258 - 00:32:00.760, Speaker A: Releasing a body of work in a physical or digital place can be a way to take a sustained pause or to summarize a period, if it makes sense to do so. Both can exist in harmony in the same artistic practice and even complement each other. So all of the above, interestingly, and finally, to take this discussion a step further, thanks in part to crypto and NFTs, the community surrounding a crypto artist's work could be considered a cross platform extended medium. The community itself, interestingly, you know, it kind of does echo this idea of Joseph Boy's idea of the social sculpture. What if you were, you know, again, he was like one of, I think he was one of the founders of the Green Party in Germany, right? So you could argue boys might love this whole community idea as part of the overall work, right? I mean, it seems like boys was interested partly in how the work impacted the real world and how art could be incorporated into the real world. So you could argue community is another kind of play on that, one that can platform hop and recongrugate into various decentralized, self organizing structures for a given experience, group chats, in person meetups or events, discord servers, etcetera. Creating art within the setting can manifest itself in a variety of ways, not limited to any particular technology or web, two platforms, program set of constraints.
00:32:00.760 - 00:32:51.756, Speaker A: So interesting comments from Ripcash. Now, speaking of the whole on chain art thing that Ripcash was doing recently. So here's just another tweet here from ordinals breaking. Bitcoin has significantly, significantly more NFT sales than ETH for the fifth day in a row. And it is true, and it is eclipsing. But I have to say, maybe that's a little concerning though, 575 buyers on bitcoin versus 11,000 on Ethereum, so that number seems to matter. That seems a little low to me, which is interesting, but nevertheless, bitcoin again, outselling by multiples, Ethereum and Solana NFTs, interestingly.
00:32:51.756 - 00:33:21.938, Speaker A: And ordinals, of course, you know, talking the ordinals book, so to speak, or supporting ordinals, ordinals will eat the entire NFT market within 18 months. An interesting concept. Who knows the truth of that, but worth considering. And so in that regard, I just thought I'd show you this. I've been talking about it forever. I got pokebelly, BTC, I went to magic Eden is where I started out. And if you go to, I use Unisat as a wallet.
00:33:21.938 - 00:33:46.780, Speaker A: There are two others, x verse or hyro. This is one way to do it. I am definitely not an expert, and I did inscribe a work, and so interest, I just thought I'd show you that because I've gotten a couple of messages of people who are interested in this, and we've been following the story. So I put this work, it was about four and a half, maybe 4.9 kb. Okay, so a nice kind of small work. And actually, here is the work.
00:33:46.780 - 00:34:12.136, Speaker A: This is kind of the real size. You know, it's probably 220 by 200 or maybe 250 by 200, something like that. And it's actually, you know, when it's the normal size, it's super crisp. It's a GIF, right. And so this is of course a SH 101. So I minted this. It cost me about $35 us in bitcoin and also pokebelly.
00:34:12.136 - 00:34:37.902, Speaker A: BTC was also about $35. So just kind of a heads up there for those that are interested. And just kind of as this is a journal, I have to note this. So interesting, isn't it? I haven't listed it yet. And this is actually something I also wanted to bring up. So, you know, again, the hard one experience, this is part of the process. This item does not belong to any collection, so do your own research.
00:34:37.902 - 00:35:05.668, Speaker A: And so I think you have to go to creators magiceden IO to make a collection. So then I was like, well, maybe I have to make like ten more of these, and then I make a collection. And so, yeah, because they're worried about people who are just kind of minting things and trying to take advantage of the community. So they have these messages here. Kind of reminds me of opensea with a verification check. So all pretty interesting. So just sharing the experience there.
00:35:05.668 - 00:35:39.722, Speaker A: Artifaction two hot take. As a collector, my stance is firmly in favor of on chain decentralized hosting for nfts hosting. So maybe that's like ipfs, however it's. Or decentralized hosting. However, it's clear to me that the permanence of any platform, including blockchain, is questionable over the span of 50 to 100 years. Therefore, I believe that ensuring longevity of an artist's work necessitates its transition through various preservation platforms over the years. On chain isn't the end all, be all.
00:35:39.722 - 00:36:11.968, Speaker A: It's a make sense narrative in current times. But my opinion is digital art will have to see many preservation methods over the years. So interesting. So I'm not sure actually, when they say decentralized hosting for nfts maybe they are talking about being on chain here. Artifaction two it's actually ambiguous there, so I'll just say it's still in the air. And here's RJ GM gang just minted and listed my first on chain piece, narcissistic tendencies. So we saw these works ahead of time.
00:36:11.968 - 00:36:58.758, Speaker A: They're available on foundation at 15. This particular work thoughts, theories and other pieces in the series below. I've been interested in on chain art for a while now and been a big fan of the likes of what Oxdiid maximizing did as well as rip cash have been doing. And do check out the brilliant tools of Oxdeed. So I think actually Spuegel's maskinen also mentioned Oxsteed, which I've used here, by the way. It's also struck me as I've been experimenting with line drawing, that it might offer another way alongside dithering and more traditional pixel work to create small enough file sizes for on chain inscription, which might achieve the elegance of restriction. Pokebelly often mentions re on chain pieces, reflecting on these pieces the intent.
00:36:58.758 - 00:37:28.676, Speaker A: So there is RJ inscribing himself, interestingly, on the blockchain. Kind of a cool concept, smart concept, RJ. If you're going to be on the blockchain, put the self portrait there as kind of like the most kind of best preserved, best way of preserving it. And here is a work that was minted here at 0.15 ETH narcissistic tendencies. And there is RJ, a cool simple drawing, 6.6 kb.
00:37:28.676 - 00:37:53.184, Speaker A: So as you see here again for bitcoin, that probably cost about 50 or $60 to mint. And that was minted on ETH, of course. So mech txt as we jump into the art here, a quiet town pixel art. So I guess this has finally been minted. Finally an MS Dos work has been minted. And just thrilling to see. Thrilled and excited the offers are coming in.
00:37:53.184 - 00:38:14.180, Speaker A: I may have to put an offer in here too, so we'll see. I need to go to Mech's Twitter feed to see what the deal is here, if there is a deal. And so great to see the Ms. The name of the series is dosage. Cool title. A quiet town, figments with a stunner here. Beautiful, beautiful work.
00:38:14.180 - 00:38:38.952, Speaker A: T three and model id 420. And just a beautiful work. I was almost started with this one. Gorgeous, gorgeous work. Kind of fits the screen beautifully here too. Love, love the horizontal lines here, right? It's kind of like an alternative pixelation, right? Like it's still got that retro feel. It's just interesting.
00:38:38.952 - 00:39:01.996, Speaker A: And you see it here, it's kind of wide. And even in the cycling colors here, the RGB, conceptually interesting. They're all kind of horizontal ratioed pixels. A very nice piece stunner. And this is 20 tezos on secondary. There's only one left of this stunner. T one.
00:39:01.996 - 00:39:35.064, Speaker A: Here's t one. So just really cool works here. Again, as I've been saying here for the last couple of weeks, if you hit a wall, try a new software, because all of a sudden you'll be making, you know, look at Kappn here, or figments, making these beautiful drawings just with a horizontal, uh, tool here. Uh, horizontal pixel tool or whatever you want to call that horizontal brush. Uh, just stunning. Here's another one with a little bit of animation, I think. Uh, kappen uses gimp for the animation part, if I'm not mistaken.
00:39:35.064 - 00:39:49.860, Speaker A: Not positive on that. Of course, Kappen was in the Twitter space a couple of months ago, which was fabulous. Out of Costa Rica. How to fry a circuit board. Here's another one. Very busy one. Just very cool work here.
00:39:49.860 - 00:40:11.504, Speaker A: Kind of reminiscent. Would hang beautifully with a gogolitis, wouldn't it? Really cool work here. 200. Is that microgram drop figments? 17 tezos, I think, on secondary here, with that beautiful horizontally pixeled sun. And just more beautiful work. Kind of looks like a mountain. A landscape of sorts here.
00:40:11.504 - 00:40:36.384, Speaker A: Beautiful. Beautiful. How many left? One on secondary at 17. One for 18. Popple back on the scene here with another of these kind of Mac window framed orcs and a kind of monster knight of sorts here. Kind of a Sci-Fi monster here. Cycling through and just kind of cool at 25,000 views here so far.
00:40:36.384 - 00:40:46.638, Speaker A: And that was released last night. So we'll see how many. Look at that. 138 tweets. Very impressive. From popple here. We'll see if that gets minted.
00:40:46.638 - 00:41:11.938, Speaker A: Slava angle or, sorry, slava. Three panopticore fragment. So, of course, the panopticon is a famous. You learned that in 18th century studies. Because, of course, Michel Foucault, who I never really read, I have to admit, madness and civilization. I tried, and actually, I tried reading. I was actually more interested in the book on Raymond Russell, but not the clearest writer ever.
00:41:11.938 - 00:42:07.474, Speaker A: It's kind of like standard fare these days in the humanities to read Foucault. Anyways, the panopticon is made a big deal of by Foucault because it's a prison with basically, eyes. Eyes with the guys who the surveillance people in the middle, in the circular area. And then all the prison cells are kind of in an oval around this kind of middle surveillance area where, let's say, this guy in the office is. So the idea is, with this kind of surveillance, nobody will act badly because it'll be all, let's say, glass or just bars in the prisons, because everybody will feel like they're never sure when they're being watched because here it's probably darker glass or something like that. So kind of the original surveillance idea and how you'll pull the benefit from the system's point of view is people will police themselves. So when you see the panopticon here, or a reference to it, panopticore fragment, that is often what is being discussed.
00:42:07.474 - 00:42:29.244, Speaker A: This is part of an object. One drop, extra part of panopticon. So part of a drop on object one. But this is just on object, I believe. And so a reference to the panopticon. Cool work here by Slava three. And that went to Bijou, interestingly, grimoire, the birth of tragedy.
00:42:29.244 - 00:42:49.372, Speaker A: And so more literary references here. So we've got our reference to, I guess, Nietzsche. And here we see a surveillance camera and a centaur with a bow and arrow, interestingly so. Cool color, cool composition. Nice light colors. Just another nice piece based on Nietzsche's book. Another nice piece by Grimoire or.
00:42:49.372 - 00:43:05.914, Speaker A: Yeah. 65 tezos. And one is sold for nine. And the last one is so burnt. Twelve. And then selling the last one for 65. This is Silva san twos, I believe, on Zora, even more glitch.
00:43:05.914 - 00:43:29.690, Speaker A: This one I found quite interesting in its minimalism. So again, using glitchrom, which is trademark Silva sand two s, brought it up big. Again. I like the minimalism in this. There's something to be said for it where barely anything is moving. And maybe that's, you know, just as well, if not better. Sometimes it still creates that interest that you need.
00:43:29.690 - 00:44:00.350, Speaker A: And I also like the simplicity of the composition. It's just a horse. So interesting piece here by Silva Santuz on Zora. Two minted and 28 days to go. And here, Heidi Rockette, who also does a lot of Nintendo glitch rom. But this looks like Amiga 1200, a computer generated art sum 96 and looks like Haiti Rockette continues to draw. And here we see a beautiful beach with a big sun.
00:44:00.350 - 00:44:18.014, Speaker A: And then animating it in a similar way to we were seeing some of those other works. And some nice palm trees. That almost looks like a hospital. Maybe it's a hotel on the beach here. And this beautiful beach, I might add. So we're seeing. It's nice to see Haiti Rockette draw.
00:44:18.014 - 00:44:28.974, Speaker A: That's what it looks like. So a one of one. We'll see if it's sold or if it's just being kept for the personal collection. Just being kept for the personal collection. Cool. And here's another one. Smile edition of three.
00:44:28.974 - 00:44:50.282, Speaker A: And again, we're seeing this kind of cycling again. Probably Amiga 1200 software and for Photoshop is being used here. So not exactly sure how the animation is happening, but remember the pepe's kind of similar, right? Edition of three. Lol. More cool work. Playing with happy faces with lulz from Haiti. Rockette.
00:44:50.282 - 00:45:11.838, Speaker A: Looks like there's some sort of algorithm that you feed the kind of original work into and then it makes bigger works that are animated. Plus, what's gamma? This is cool. A few of these were released. I'm showing this one shape ad zero three. I thought this was a pretty cool work. I assume it's from 2009, or at least from earlier. From the archive, I assume because of the 2009.
00:45:11.838 - 00:45:32.282, Speaker A: Looks like the name of the series. Just really cool work already, I think on secondary one. Left on secondary at nine tezos. So selling out at three tezos pretty quickly, within a couple hours. And here's another one by fossilized Gamma n or n. And this is six tezos 39. Is this also sold out? Yeah.
00:45:32.282 - 00:45:50.414, Speaker A: So Francoise Gamma selling out a couple of series here at three tezos. And. Pretty nice piece. I love the texture on this one. Kind of has a cider feel to the texture or graphica. But I think this is also from the 2009 series, interestingly. And here's Ed Marolla, of course.
00:45:50.414 - 00:46:12.728, Speaker A: Susanne. Violetta is a tribute to diode diva Susanne Chani. I thought this was pretty nice. Gif. Kind of a minimal, minimal animation. And I think the kind of monochromatic, except for, like this little bit of, you know, light pink and this really nice kind of framing device. It all just works out beautifully.
00:46:12.728 - 00:46:52.180, Speaker A: Even the light of this machine here reflecting off of Suzanne. Just really nice piece there. And there's a piece that was minted on Zora by Ed Marolla. And let's see if we can get the. And I think Ed got a theremin, if I'm not mistaken. So, I mean, very, very cool. Just very cool work here.
00:46:52.180 - 00:47:08.492, Speaker A: Let's see what it's minting for. Let us see. Eight minted free mint on Zora. So das number one for purple synth. Great title. Very nice piece. And here we have Jean Provencher.
00:47:08.492 - 00:47:25.990, Speaker A: I think we've seen some of Jean's work before. Kind of like these, again, Mac windows, kind of retro Mac windows with some really kind of super textured. Almost looks like a monster or something. No title here. Interesting piece on Twitter. 16,000 views. Pretty good.
00:47:25.990 - 00:47:51.988, Speaker A: And Nicholas Sassoon pattern 39 and November 18, 2023. Looks like some basically architectural arches here with a little bit of patterning in the background, kind of cycling through. And this has 11,000 views. Pretty nice work from Nicholas Sassoon. I'm not sure if any of these have been released yet. These patterns, part of that larger series we've been tracking here. Pinky Blue, who often does pixel art in pink and blue.
00:47:51.988 - 00:48:15.820, Speaker A: Interesting animation. You see how it's almost like a full layer and then just moving it up and kind of just doing this little tiny circle with this entire layer, but then keeping the other layers static. Nice piece from Pinky Blue on x. And Mayu Gunman. And this is an edition of 20. And I think, yeah, we'll see in the next tweet. I think we got a tweet from.
00:48:15.820 - 00:48:37.912, Speaker A: Nice piece here from Myu here. And I think, yeah, it's already on secondary. Selling out at three tezos last night within basically 4 hours, selling out their edition of 20. Okay, so cool. And check this out. When Murat pack bids on your pixel art, it's like a creative detonation. Boom.
00:48:37.912 - 00:49:06.276, Speaker A: So it's nice when prominent artists like Murat Pack, who I'm sure I follow, is buying works of, you know, artists that are just making their way here. I guess you'd call them emerging, whatever you want to call it. That's just cool. So that can really help out, and it can be very encouraging here. So very cool. And our milk, who I think picked up one of those works by Mayu, is shared a work in progress. Tired pixels, number 65.
00:49:06.276 - 00:49:31.458, Speaker A: The title is in the work. And just another cool work here, I think, does a lot of the stained glass windows, which I learnt that his family does here. We don't really see any. This looks more like burgain party at the temple. I mean, doesn't this look like. Kind of looks like a homage to Bergain in Berlin here, the famous club. Interesting, rustic digital art Facebook story.
00:49:31.458 - 00:50:00.678, Speaker A: I quite like this piece. Just playing with Internet iconography and even rendering it in different ways. Like this is almost like a pure, like, vector type sample, whereas other places, it seems like we're getting more just kind of brush work or just kind of drawing manual drawing as well as here. And then there's some sports stuff. Just a cool collection of imagery from rustic digital art. Very cool piece. Edition of ten.
00:50:00.678 - 00:50:13.262, Speaker A: Five tezos. Abigail Ox. Abigail Zero X. Abigail. Silent spaces. So another work, kind of playing with a display of art. And we see a red chair here.
00:50:13.262 - 00:50:31.324, Speaker A: For all you know. It's kind of hard to, I guess the red chair is the focal point. And then, interestingly, soon is written on top of the image. Kind of looks like a gallery of sorts, doesn't it? In the white space here, the white cube here. And so cool art. Only one tezos. Ten left on primary.
00:50:31.324 - 00:50:47.440, Speaker A: And here's ratcloak. And this was an addition of ten at 40 tezos. And so that sold out pretty quickly. Let me just look here. Within 2 hours, selling out at 40 tezos. Edition of ten. Interesting piece.
00:50:47.440 - 00:51:04.226, Speaker A: Kind of looking like a x ray here. And just an interesting painterly piece. Not sure if this is a self portrait here in the background. I saw this as a work in progress earlier on x. And here is a doctor. And here is more x. Rain and wild, kind of.
00:51:04.226 - 00:51:27.078, Speaker A: Again, these kind of Baconessque moves here. Interesting painting colors too, in the background as well as on the wall. And almost like a Baconessque space here. And interesting how this kind of pipe goes where the corner is. All sorts of interesting lines here. Especially this one at the top, at the bottom, I should say, on top, on the top layer. Wild.
00:51:27.078 - 00:51:49.814, Speaker A: And as well as here, so wild space in this one. The empty. An enigmatic title from Ratcloak. And continuing on, cider with a pretty cool textured work, seemingly of the crucifixion here. Unless it is from something that. I don't know, maybe this is from something else. Maybe it's another meme of which I know not.
00:51:49.814 - 00:52:16.874, Speaker A: And so more cool work. 11,000 views for cider. And of course this is graphica with, again from this, I think using the opacity, the transparent backgrounds here. Take a rest. Anon Sol with this beautiful fire, this original fire here with these kind of AI collage painting and transparency. Cool kind of reference to the foundation page here. You see the logo, the dragged out search bar.
00:52:16.874 - 00:52:32.684, Speaker A: A really cool series here. Super original. Temble Mismiz, also known as Mo shit void. Enjoy. So just, again, putting these characters just. I'm trying to remember what these remind me of, but just figures here on a flat space. Very interesting.
00:52:32.684 - 00:52:44.278, Speaker A: One of one for 15 tezos. And I thought this was kind of funny too. Le arte del padrino. Oh, it's Padrino. New work. Mint I thought it was kind of fun. I like it.
00:52:44.278 - 00:52:59.118, Speaker A: And I like the cruise ship here, actually, weirdly. I think that's a cruise ship. That one really kind of impressed me. And then the sun, I thought it was just so kind of. What's the word? Just kind of quirky. I thought it was quirky. So quirky.
00:52:59.118 - 00:53:15.936, Speaker A: You might as well mint it, is what I would say. Just my two cent here, the Hollywood sign. Just kind of a bunch of stuff all at once. This I think I saw in curio. Fringes feed. And this almost looks physical, doesn't it? Weirdly enough, this is probably a physical. This is by Kim G.
00:53:15.936 - 00:53:32.920, Speaker A: Hun, football pintura olio sobre tela. So I think that's a painting collect for seven tazos 77. And let me just see. I think they all sold. Sabato picked one up and fabri two k. So yeah, sold out. Interesting piece.
00:53:32.920 - 00:53:44.362, Speaker A: Very interesting piece. Let's make it big. Nice piece. I'd love to see the physical like this is the physical, but I'd love to see it like up in a gallery. Very nice piece. Look at this. I was thrilled to pick this up.
00:53:44.362 - 00:54:01.986, Speaker A: It's kind of tapping away, refreshing on my browser there to pick this one up. Brillos and ojos picked it up for ten tezos. And this is by NUV 1914. Beautiful piece. I was thrilled. A one of one. Kind of different looking from the others too.
00:54:01.986 - 00:54:11.014, Speaker A: And here is one. I think I picked this one up too. I picked up a couple. Yes, I picked this one up also by NUV 1914. Verde. Nice pieces. Cheap.
00:54:11.014 - 00:54:29.902, Speaker A: One of ones from NUV 1914. Super interesting artist. Here's another one available nt. So kind of fitting into that whole series where juxtaposing the gradient guy with a completely different way of kind of drawing. Illustrative. Interesting piece here. And then here are more gradients on the side.
00:54:29.902 - 00:54:45.702, Speaker A: So this is, I think a slightly earlier one. This one's sold. And interesting piece here as well. Kind of a teddy bear with the gradient guy on the right. Mumble boy with a couple of more here. I am amusement. Some more digital collage from mumble boy.
00:54:45.702 - 00:55:09.254, Speaker A: And interestingly and nicely done here. So one of one. And this went for twelve tazos to little cakes. And here's another one, kind of more just all over the place. Lots of random kind of imagery with a gradient in the background. Again, the neighborhood, one of one digital collage. And this is a combination of two analog collages and a photo.
00:55:09.254 - 00:55:33.798, Speaker A: So interesting experimentation here. And I think these are from the archive. If I'm not mistaken. Twelve tezos to an anonymous wallet. So it continues here. Walk continuing what I think is September 11 done in his kind of noise filtered style here. I don't know what the process is, but these are entirely digital, unlike the spray works, of course.
00:55:33.798 - 00:55:56.034, Speaker A: Edition of one. And was this burned? This was burned, but maybe there's a new version that was made. And as you'll see here, kind of going 1 minute at a time here. They're all selling out, by the way, all these one of ones, they often go for auction. This is probably at auction now. Five tazos. So you can pick up walk one of ones for pretty reasonable, usually, if you get lucky.
00:55:56.034 - 00:56:16.534, Speaker A: Dylan, a view from the bridge. Another cool one of one here. And I love the use of physical kind of tropes, so to speak. And it almost looks like a physical work, but it's a digital artwork. Interesting move here at the bottom, too. These really nice. Basically, I guess you'd call it two or three color abstract works here.
00:56:16.534 - 00:56:38.962, Speaker A: Or maybe it isn't abstract. It is abstract, but a view from the bridge. Interesting piece is that the sun? One of one selling at only ten tezos to Louis. Continuing on, secret cobra information. So a couple of drawings here on, on instagram. I'll have to kill those notifications here. The world is a vampire.
00:56:38.962 - 00:56:57.066, Speaker A: Here's another one. Archival ink on paper. One of two pieces I'm showing in crucial mass. So this is with super chief. So I'm not exactly sure who this is or where they're being minted, but I thought they looked pretty cool. Nice. I guess I'm not sure if they're digital drawings because it almost looks like physical.
00:56:57.066 - 00:57:28.798, Speaker A: It's getting harder and harder to tell, isn't it? So, nice piece here. Archival ink on paper. Okay, so that is a physical continuing on. Jim the illustrator really enjoyed making artwork for releases by NY new eye. And so a couple of more works here by Jim the illustrator. Look at these cool, surreal illustration here. How are we doing? We got a run.
00:57:28.798 - 00:57:47.614, Speaker A: New drawings in Jim's sketchbook done in very small windows of time while the baby sleeps, preparing for a large scale drawing for exhibition. So more works here. Very nicely done. Look at that. Great texture, really. That's created by the pointillism there. Reminds me of the RJ from the other day that was done with pixels.
00:57:47.614 - 00:58:03.282, Speaker A: Nice physical work here from Jim the illustrator. Laprisa Mata Arena, Las Maga series. Just an interesting, complex illustration here. A lot going on in it. Thought it was pretty interesting. Look at that. 114,000 views.
00:58:03.282 - 00:58:24.446, Speaker A: Basquia grazias. Giving the collage, the negative, the photographic negative collages, giving them a 3d treatment here. So that is cool. The fa. A 3d slide available for 350. Very interesting. And of course, this is in the Vatican.
00:58:24.446 - 00:58:45.144, Speaker A: This is Raphael. This is Mount Parnassus, I believe. And you'll see, that's Homer right there. Let's see if we can zoom in here. There is Homer. And there's Raphael actually over here, interestingly, putting himself in. This is probably Virgil.
00:58:45.144 - 00:59:01.724, Speaker A: And that looks like Dante there. So again, we were talking about epic, the epics there. And so you see, remember we're talking about the big game. This, my friends. And then what is Raph? This shows Raphael is playing the big game. Raphael puts himself right in there. Okay.
00:59:01.724 - 00:59:31.008, Speaker A: And right with the epic poets here, of course, you know, Dante sort of thought the divine comedy is kind of, of that level. So very fascinating there, of course, that is in the Vatican. The stanzi, the rooms of Raphael. There are four rooms there. Datura, I advise you to take a look at gallery, which I don't think I've seen before or remember seeing cleanui. And it's very easy to make posts for your collection. I can even play with my interactive objects directly on the platform.
00:59:31.008 - 00:59:54.088, Speaker A: And here I brought it up. And so pretty nice and pretty cool interactive work by Datura. And let me just see, I'm not sure, I don't. Oh, here we go. Shall we look at the homepage super quickly? This is pretty nice. I will give it that for sure. So just another platform here as the competition continues.
00:59:54.088 - 01:00:20.854, Speaker A: Almost has a tumblr feel to it, doesn't it? Very interesting. And I wonder how you sign in Ethereum and L two s tazos. So they're trying to be multi chain as well or they are multi chain. Very interesting. Again, kind of a tumblr feel to it. Nip trove or knee with a nice animated abstract here. Just an interesting piece.
01:00:20.854 - 01:00:33.882, Speaker A: A little bit of volume in there too. Interestingly chaotic neutral. Another work by feels. That is pretty cool. 28,000 views and interesting piece here. And score. Liquid red rose.
01:00:33.882 - 01:00:59.564, Speaker A: Let's just load this up. So we saw kind of a flower blooming the other day and now we see a different kind of flower, a rose blooming here. No music this time. This was minted on object. And really nice textures in here. And what is the technique, the skyriskari, I can't remember the exact, I don't know if that technique is being used here. Liquid red rose.
01:00:59.564 - 01:01:14.512, Speaker A: Red rose. At a botanical park in Tokyo. Because of course, score is working with 3d scanners. So very interesting. And here's a work. Kuro sent this to me, happily picking this up. So this is by Koda Nakazono.
01:01:14.512 - 01:01:30.260, Speaker A: I thought a very nice piece here. Let's see if it plays. Love the depth of field. This is on foundation on Ethereum. Love the depth of field. And then super high res hd at the front here. Nice piece by coda.
01:01:30.260 - 01:01:47.564, Speaker A: Nice kind of even just like the different compositional ratio here. Kind of more of a horizontal composition continuum. Number 170. Last sold for 0.05. Spiegel's maskinn evolve. And we'll see if there's any. A little bit of volume here.
01:01:47.564 - 01:02:18.148, Speaker A: Pretty cool music. Wow. Now I'm going to stop that just in case. That's a copyright of someone. You get 30 seconds, as far as I understand, with video and audio, I guess this is a 32nd long video. You got the sense of the music, though. Check out Spiegel's feed.
01:02:18.148 - 01:02:35.664, Speaker A: Interesting piece. So pretty sick. As Tuke says, salewaki for the culture. And so I'm gonna play this on Twitter. And then this went for 420. We'll see it in a second on object, but I thought I'd play it on Twitter because it plays a little bit easier. They're often lower size.
01:02:35.664 - 01:03:15.564, Speaker A: Message sending. Welcome to the ocean. Message sending. We're almost there now. Message sending messages. I'm just doing a little bit of jumping around here for copyright reasons. And so you have to go to Salawaki's feed.
01:03:15.564 - 01:03:42.320, Speaker A: And I think she was kind of making fun of the 420 and 69 for the culture. What people often price works at it is part of the culture. Some people show skepticism towards these numbers and like, oh, you know, it's not intellectual enough. It's about the culture to a certain degree. Yeah. Minted reserve of 4269. I mean, this went for 420.69
01:03:42.320 - 01:03:58.204, Speaker A: to Mikhail Knowlsson. So nice bid there. Strano bidding 70. It's a one of one. And so nice piece from Salawaki Sabato. This was super interesting. I love how GLB compression can turn any object into a piece of glitch, brutalism.
01:03:58.204 - 01:04:26.738, Speaker A: So this is, to me, glitch as philosophy here. As a philosophy. Like in this work where Glub Puderoso's chimera in a cathedral is rendered into its most elemental form. The once iconic church is now a cubic frame holding an enigmatic chimera like a planet. So this church seems to have been turned into this cube here by using compression. So that is probably export compression. Which is super interesting.
01:04:26.738 - 01:04:53.726, Speaker A: And to me this is very illustrative why I'm showing it first. It's an interesting concept, but it shows the philosophy of glitch, I would argue where you see it's using these technologies in ways that they're not designed to be used, but in order to get interesting effects. And here you get a simplified church as a cube. Very interesting. And here's another work here. New NFT egg drops soon. This is Johanna Croft.
01:04:53.726 - 01:05:11.914, Speaker A: And I thought this was. I don't think there's any volume. A very nice egg, isn't it? Nice, kind of multicolored, rainbow shiny egg, I thought. Really interesting piece here. And here's another video. Seren su Cg. So kind of CGi stuff and mixed media.
01:05:11.914 - 01:05:41.404, Speaker A: A freely changing space. Let's see if it play a few little highlight here. Covered with dry grass. Gently soft. Cool audio. Cool audio again, remember the van Gogh shoes. Remember the Van Gogh shoes we saw from before.
01:05:41.404 - 01:06:05.696, Speaker A: So again, just in the spirit of being copyright friendly here, so you get a sense of the work here. Interesting piece. 20 tezos edition of 20 by Saren Su. Very cool. This is also cool. Mariana ju notan Mariana. Hello world fascinated you really scroll down and got my first nft.
01:06:05.696 - 01:06:23.684, Speaker A: I really appreciate it. Thought just a cool work here. I don't think there's any volume, just kind of a little bit of feedback here. And of course I just thought it looked great. And then of course the default television screen from the nineties or eighties. Hello world on top. Shepherdom fade mad.
01:06:23.684 - 01:06:46.286, Speaker A: This is madly rocket science. And so this is interesting. We got rockets going out now this looks like an older one. This is a subject I really like, is kind of liftoffs. I've done a few myself and someone messaged me about doing some more and I think I might actually. Anyway, just cool work here. Cheperton buy now edition of 66 for 35 tazos, 46 left.
01:06:46.286 - 01:07:08.732, Speaker A: Wow, that's quite a bit for a 66. This Shepperton is probably a pretty well known artist. And Klaus with a pretty cool, nicely colored space dork, as he calls it here. Gif created with analog video hardware. Great color of this alien. Some more interesting work here. There's edition of one.
01:07:08.732 - 01:07:33.690, Speaker A: And this went to Hans for only ten tezos. And here is Kuro and Ranixteer. Flash FM a collaboration. Sorry, it's not Rannixeer, it's Recano, Reconno and Kiro. So of course now we see it. You see like a reconno setting here but put through the analog glitchery video glitchery of Kuro. Seemingly interesting.
01:07:33.690 - 01:07:49.122, Speaker A: Nice thing on the side here. Nice strip. Nice color, too. Half kind of black and white, and then half these kind of bright colors. Bolin 132. This looks like it's AI and oil paint. Interestingly so.
01:07:49.122 - 01:08:05.672, Speaker A: Interesting mix here. Pretty cool piece. It would be amazing if this started with oil paint, oil painting and AI. That is what it says. Edition of six for a Tezos 50. Cool piece. Trying to remember what that structure reminds me of, of seeing nine heads like that defend the right of plants to grow.
01:08:05.672 - 01:08:20.376, Speaker A: So Okot continues with the global south series. And just a rad series here. This is 250 edition of 13. And here's another one. My song is my weapon. Kind of looks like, you know, reminds me. Maybe it's the guitar.
01:08:20.376 - 01:08:39.054, Speaker A: Reminds me of Mikey Wilson a little bit in its ability, even in the paintiness, its ability to paint. I need to learn how to paint like this on AI. So beautiful work by Okot. Great series. Songs of freedom. Love it. Olivera Durdevic with a cool AI artwork here.
01:08:39.054 - 01:08:57.338, Speaker A: Interesting kind of depth of field on the mountains in the background. Interesting textured moon. So this is AI art. It almost looks. It says mixed media. It almost looks like it's more than AI. Interestingly, kind of like slightly out of focus here on the hand, but then more in focus on the head.
01:08:57.338 - 01:09:11.802, Speaker A: On the. On the outline on the head there. So interesting piece. Ever increasing wonder. And look at these pieces by strange thing, these canvases. I want to call them by strange thing, who is just in Rome. And he had a cool message here.
01:09:11.802 - 01:09:28.763, Speaker A: Jien. Everyone making plans. So here they are, these guys in almost like riot gear, but with the Nike symbol on it and balaclavas in white. Cool color. Again, off the charts color here. The legs don't really quite match up. Maybe they do, but I don't think so.
01:09:28.763 - 01:09:44.267, Speaker A: So interesting work here from strange thing. And there. Interesting. Nice. I recognize that shirt. Let's put it that way. Look at this brilliant texture here of this painting of, like, you know, getting that oil paint cracking on the.
01:09:44.267 - 01:10:00.814, Speaker A: In the sky there. This beautiful texture on the right. And there's this cool kind of guy going for a walk. Half in Renaissance gear, half in contemporary gear. Beautiful work as usual by strange thing. Happy Sunday. Taking the dog for a walk.
01:10:00.814 - 01:10:22.634, Speaker A: Strange thing gave a speech in Rome. I'm not sure if strange thing was there, but if you. But today I represent a community. It looks like it's just a video Rome exhibition speech. So go check that out on strange things. Feed. Pretty impressive yeah, I could see Rome being all over.
01:10:22.634 - 01:10:49.792, Speaker A: Strange things work. So good for strange thing here. So just check that out in the, on his feed, his instagram here. We've seen this work before, but just kind of back to I thought it kind of worked well with the strange things speech. 1 million views for tewks here on this work. I think this is pinned on Tuks's page here. But 1 million views, that is pretty amazing.
01:10:49.792 - 01:11:26.708, Speaker A: Those are real numbers again, like a Elon Musk tweet will often get like 35 million, right? It's pretty impressive. And just to show the views, I mean, I kind of went on this little tangent. 5.8 5800 this is gagosian 2000 4200. We haven't looked at this for a long time. 4800 1800. So it's interesting, you know, if x becomes the main social media platform, like you have as much of a voice, a lot of the people watching this have as much of a voice or more than gagosian in terms of reach.
01:11:26.708 - 01:11:57.016, Speaker A: If we use reach as the metric, maybe not in terms of influence, but in terms of reach, that is quite interesting, isn't it? Look at the rich museum in Amsterdam, 6000, 205,400. Major museum 12,000 5300. So pretty interesting to do that. Very quick comparison here. 17,000. And here's Santiago continuing with the AI here, AI art. So it looks like a Santiago rendered in AI fashion here.
01:11:57.016 - 01:12:17.528, Speaker A: Almost has a watercolor feel to it. So cool work from Santiago and arty hands posting this. Finally got around to minting a few pieces from three mil cs. Emil improps. Wonderful new series on improps and I thought it looked pretty cool as well. Has this, they have a really great texture. What's coming out on improps.
01:12:17.528 - 01:12:54.884, Speaker A: So more interesting works out of improps courtesy of arty hands showing Emile improps work. And of course Skamra with another beautiful person at a computer here. And just another really, really cool work. And then you see the windows or the folder window at the bottom there and even this screen and everything. Just cool work from Skomra GM and Lily illo from some architects and chairs. Cool concept architects and chairs. Really cool here.
01:12:54.884 - 01:13:21.564, Speaker A: They almost look like buildings, don't they? And there, I guess is the architect and everything. Interesting color there too. And this is Danielle King, still thinking about abandoned malls. And these are almost photographic here of these. Look at this like, they almost look like photographs of abandoned malls here. Again, one of my favorite subjects. This one is maybe my favorite, the desolation here of this abandoned mall.
01:13:21.564 - 01:13:47.044, Speaker A: And here, of course, like, maybe like an atm of sorts here with appealing paint and everything from Danielle King. We'll see if that gets minted as a series here. Off to the physical work we go. Maria Fragosoge, oil on canvas. So I'm not sure if we've seen this artist before. 1969 gallery. This is in New York, so this could be someone pretty prominent, 1700 likes.
01:13:47.044 - 01:14:01.784, Speaker A: So could be a very prominent artist here. And just some other interesting discoveries here. Jordi Kerwick in France here. Albie, France. Interesting painting. Looks like a peacock. And this nacho eterno.
01:14:01.784 - 01:14:19.244, Speaker A: And 1700 likes as well. Interesting kind of painting here. I thought this artist was really impressive. Logi. It's official at gallery and Hava. These are, like, stitched works here, and you can see a lot of them here. A really interesting show.
01:14:19.244 - 01:14:35.942, Speaker A: Well, guess we'll continue the next one. Here's another one from that show. Look at the salt and pepper shaker. Looks like textiles. Looks like it's kind of sewn in really nice compositions, nice color, everything about it. Just love it. Salt, cucumber slice, and hot dog.
01:14:35.942 - 01:14:54.638, Speaker A: Essentials for the hike. Like, there's just something really wonderful about these works. Very impressive. A few more from Bondozo Bandido, who does those kind of airbrush paintings. Cool. Interesting subject matter and interesting treatment. Here's some more little paintings.
01:14:54.638 - 01:15:20.314, Speaker A: Very prolific artist here. So nice pieces here. It looks like combining some acrylic paint in there and three act story leads me to jail. Nice contrast between the acrylic paint and the airbrush, isn't there? Machine on foundation chick. And this is acrylic on canvas, 70 by 70. So pretty fun work here. Rooster with sunglasses and Zoe Kim.
01:15:20.314 - 01:15:44.186, Speaker A: Interesting work here. This looks like a physical and brain ramales also here. And you even see the building of the work. Again, a lot of these airbrush artists out here, which kind of is kind of amazing, isn't it? And this is interesting too. You see the power of the projector. That is what's going on here. This is projected onto a wall.
01:15:44.186 - 01:16:11.620, Speaker A: And so great way of being prolific. I'm a huge, huge fan of the projector. I haven't used one for a while because I'm kind of focused on digital, but very powerful tool. And, you know, like, Roy Lichtenstein used the projector. Like, a lot of people use projectors. Austin. I once was in a class at the Academy of Realist Art, and I was asking them in Toronto, and I asked them, just like a workshop, two weeks or something, and I asked them, is it legit to use a projector.
01:16:11.620 - 01:16:31.458, Speaker A: And they're like, of course it's legit to use a projector, you fool. Of course. And then of course there's even like Vermeer is thought to use the camera obscura. So using a projector is totally legit. By the. In case you're wondering, a pen and marker on bristle 2023. This is Austin Joseph Gregory.
01:16:31.458 - 01:17:19.810, Speaker A: Interesting, almost like atom bomb here with the 1950s type imagery, almost treated a little bit like, kind of reminds me of sigmar polka in the treatment there of the green and gloom tube, one of one at auction for 50. This is a fiscal NFT and just actually quite a beautiful painting here by gloom tube. And I think it's forest fire smoke from a wildfire several states away. So classic gloom tube as it continues to do the physical work here. And of course, you can recognize this is walk with a brilliant work, almost an anthropological work here. Who remembers this exactly? Like just a really interesting looking device, especially when you forget about its context and just look at it as sculpture, which I feel like walk is doing there by highlighting it. Beautiful spray work here as well by walk.
01:17:19.810 - 01:17:30.324, Speaker A: The Holy Grail. The Holy Grail, many of which we have seen today. Thank you for joining us. I am trying to reduce the length of the show. Until next time, take care.
