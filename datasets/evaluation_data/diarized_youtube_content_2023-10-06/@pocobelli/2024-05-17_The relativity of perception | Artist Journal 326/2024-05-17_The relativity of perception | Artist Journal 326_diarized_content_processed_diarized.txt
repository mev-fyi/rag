00:00:07.320 - 00:00:24.518, Speaker A: Getting in the groove. Welcome back, everybody, to a beautiful, sunny Friday here in Berlin, Germany. The landscape in my mind is also bright. I can see the grid. It's in white. The sea is still there, but it's kinda underneath the grid. Maybe they're juxtaposed.
00:00:24.518 - 00:00:46.936, Speaker A: Not sure. I have no Internet, by the way. We're going by phone. Artist journal, May 17, 2024. Broadcasting on a smooth, sunny day in inner space. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome to the show. As I was saying, I have no Internet for three days, if you can believe that.
00:00:46.936 - 00:01:17.470, Speaker A: So I went to a coffee shop to get these tabs ready. So, yeah, I think I'm gonna get Starlink. I think I'm at that point again. For me to upload this show, it takes an hour in Berlin. Like, it's kind of, as far as I understand, it's well known, their slow upload speeds and download. It's something like 24 kb/second feel free to correct me if anybody knows otherwise. But it is slow, and now it's not even working.
00:01:17.470 - 00:01:47.802, Speaker A: So maybe that is my opportunity to. I think I'm going to try Starlink. I think, you know, I looked it up about two months ago, and it's something like, I think €400. Let's call it $500. Not even $450 for the box if you buy it. And I think as little as, like, €60 a month. And it's like, if I can upload this show in, like, a minute, that just may pay for itself with the extra time, then I could upload to Zora without thinking about it.
00:01:47.802 - 00:02:08.928, Speaker A: And maybe that would even just pay for the show or for the Internet. So I'll just say, welcome back, and I hope you're as thrilled as I am that it's Friday. I am very thrilled. And it was good to get out of the house, actually early. It was kind of nice to change up the routine. Anyways, let's begin. Andre Olivero.
00:02:08.928 - 00:02:19.030, Speaker A: Sibota. Let me make sure I'm pronouncing that right. Andre Olivera. Sibola. Sibola. Mannequin. Cool title.
00:02:19.030 - 00:02:28.090, Speaker A: Biid. Not sure what that is. Build. Mannequin. Build. Not sure. Build in German, just so you know.
00:02:28.090 - 00:02:45.776, Speaker A: B I l D. There's actually a tabloid called build. That means image. Das build the image, which is kind of an interesting, important word if you're in the arts, to know at least that word in German. Let's say das bild. Pretty sure it's das. So kind of a.
00:02:45.776 - 00:03:09.776, Speaker A: It's like the sun tabloid newspaper. Just so you know. Okay, so here, just kind of a fun one to start us off here. A combination of, I think, generative art. Let's see, 3d scanning work with cell phones. Interesting. I think score was mentioning doing 3d scanning with a cell phone, if I'm not mistaken.
00:03:09.776 - 00:03:41.568, Speaker A: And generative art. In this process, I scan one of those articulated wooden mannequins used in art processes for reference poses. After the scan, the 3d object generated is reinterpreted through creative coding with the Java language. So a little bit of coding. And, you know what I like about this is, first, it kind of dazzles the eyes. But what I also like about it, it's sophisticated in, it's using different processes. It's kind of novel.
00:03:41.568 - 00:04:15.670, Speaker A: It's kind of different, right. With the grid around it. And I also like the accessibility. I don't think you need to have a PhD in art history to like this one. I think you can be six years old and really just enjoy the color, recognize it for what it is, which is a body, in this case, a wooden mannequin, within this space. And then just kind of digitalized, pixelated in this beautiful kind of generative art. Kind of leaky feedback, shall we say, for lack of a better term, in this flashing green and black cube with a gray background.
00:04:15.670 - 00:04:50.902, Speaker A: So just a cool one on a foundation on the homepage, as Andre was tweeting out, which is how I saw that. So it's just kind of a lesson in, when you have good news, turn it into something, make pr out of it. It's kind of worth it, because then that feeds back on itself and it kind of amplifies it. So kind of a fun thing there. This is on base, 0.033. So pretty reasonable price. I think that's like $10, if I'm not mistaken, plus a little fee.
00:04:50.902 - 00:05:10.026, Speaker A: And so, yeah, so very cool. And two of 33. Two of 33 minted. This is on base, which, again, continues to be very popular. So again, if you're looking for it, Andre Olivera Cibola. Cool work. Just an original work there on.
00:05:10.026 - 00:05:41.098, Speaker A: I think if you go to the homepage of foundation, you'll find it continuing on Clownvamp. So very interesting. You know, sometimes I do these shows, and I just kind of hope that people are going to be able to speak about whatever topic. And, you know, I was like, you know, clownvamp, can you speak on what's going on in AI? Because you don't. You're not necessarily gonna keep up with everything. And Clownvamp's like, yeah, no problem. Happy I'm thinking about this all the time.
00:05:41.098 - 00:06:40.628, Speaker A: And so here, if you are looking for a catch up on AI, and I guess we'd say like visual AI, you know, it's kind of focused mostly on AI, you know, even 3d modeling tools, upscalers, which I'm finding very interesting. This whole upscaling thing, it's like a remix through scale. I love simple ideas. I adore. And so this idea of you can remix by upscaling and how, contrary to where we were even five years ago, I'd argue, but especially 20 or ten when I the big it would seem like an impossible task that you'd ever get an image bigger than, you know, its original dimensions without it getting kind of JPEG artifacts and everything here, instead of it getting worse. You could argue by upscaling you could potentially make an image better. Like that's a paradigm shift.
00:06:40.628 - 00:07:13.300, Speaker A: So all to say, this is a fascinating hour and 18 minutes of, I would say non stop enthusiastic discussion with clownvamp, runetoon and myself. And so check it out. I highly recommend it. I need to give it another listen. I do plan to put the shows on Spotify first. I need my Internet to work though, so first things first. But I do plan on doing a big update there for everybody that's been on the show.
00:07:13.300 - 00:07:57.020, Speaker A: What a reservoir of information. Because I don't think I've uploaded since October, November and I have all those shows ready to go. Let's continue. Yolandis discussing the clown vamp appearance after hearing a conversation between Clownvamp, Pokebelly and Rune tune, I recorded a ten minute show to tell of my mid journey smart folders reflecting on image coherence and mint frequency. One of the questions I asked Clownvamp was, how do you archive your images? Because if anybody who's made AI artwork knows, you kind of have a lot of images. I mean, amazingly, clownvamp saves. He was saying 50% to 60% of the images are saved, I think.
00:07:57.020 - 00:08:21.294, Speaker A: And I was what do you use? Dropbox? Interesting, interesting, interesting. So here yolandas. I'll have to give once my Internet is working and it doesn't cost me $2 of phone data to watch this YouTube video, I will chat about my own mid journey images. So I actually can't wait. That is bookmarked. I can't wait to check that out. Also, Clownvamp releasing this right before the show.
00:08:21.294 - 00:09:24.038, Speaker A: Interesting thought. Real images is a funny concept. And we went actually into depth on this. Roon Tune asks no wide angle lenses, no post processing, no flash photoshop in a sense clownvamp is questioning the idea of what exactly is a real image? Do they only come from the real region of France? How much intermediation is okay if not a mirrorless camera? Is it too much mechanical intervention? But wait, our eyes are only processing light signals and building a visual of that? Oh, in a sense, we might call this what I would be tempted to call off the top of my head with coffee coursing through my veins. The relativity of perception, the relativity of appearance, you know. And it kind of, uh, again, it kind of evokes a little bit, uh, Plato to a certain degree, the world of becoming. Right? In a sense, this stuff isn't stable.
00:09:24.038 - 00:10:10.420, Speaker A: And to clown vamp's point, you may think, uh, something is quote unquote realistic because really your eyes are just another kind of post processing of a certain kind or processing mechanism that might be different from a bee. And who's to say what the reality is? Because oftentimes, and I think the reason clownvamp is bringing this up is because AI is getting distinguished, one might say, from quote unquote real images. Right. Interesting. Now, it does seem to relate the real. We're almost back to this idea of the, I think you pronounce it the referent. Right.
00:10:10.420 - 00:10:58.480, Speaker A: You know, like the question is like very quickly, if we're to unpack this a little bit, the real image, let's say a photograph, let's call it a copy using light of external reality, we'll just loosely call it that. It's the first copy. Whereas with AI we don't have, we're back to this idea of the hyper real, aren't we? We don't have a referent. Right. And that is, and if we had more time and more data, and we will go back into this, we have to review all this. But that is as far as I remember, and we've gone through it a few times here, the definition of the hyper real is there is no referent. There is no reality that is being pointed to.
00:10:58.480 - 00:11:29.904, Speaker A: Right. And I would argue that is the difference. So now, which is quote unquote more real? Yeah. Open question. Depends how you define real is, I guess what I would say, which is closer to reality. I think you could still argue that the photograph is closer because it still has a referent. But we're getting technical here.
00:11:29.904 - 00:12:03.584, Speaker A: And I think the important thing here is the provocation in this question here by clownvamp. And I'm sure there are many answers to what I am bringing up here, including one from Danielle King. Danielle King am rereading how do you. Is it Henri Berger? This is, I think, turn of the century philosophy, french philosopher ways of seeing. Shall we just quickly look, Berger, because I think it's Henri. I've read a little bit, if I remember. Is it.
00:12:03.584 - 00:12:18.070, Speaker A: No, it's John Berger. Okay. I'm thinking of someone completely different. I'm thinking of someone from the turn of the century. This is someone completely different. Interesting. Am rereading Berger's way of seeing right now, and this quote comes to mind.
00:12:18.070 - 00:13:10.872, Speaker A: The photographer's way of seeing is reflected in their choice of subject. The painter's way of seeing is reconstituted by the marks they make on the canvas or paper. And it kind of brings us back also to that discussion we were having on the inner logic of impossible images. The way the creative process. Again, with photography, you could argue there is an integral link of this mimesis, this copy of the so called real or external world. Whereas with image making and art and drawing and painting, arguably, I don't think you have to have that referent. You can kind of start with marks on a page.
00:13:10.872 - 00:13:45.224, Speaker A: In a sense, you're creating your own referent by creating something in the external world. So not sure where that leaves us here, but in the name of time, shall we continue? So thank you, everybody, for the comments on last episode with that brilliant work by machine, Ed Marolla. Love the initial thought. Let's create exactly the advice to my younger self. Stop thinking and do. And I do think of Ed Marolla in that respect. You can totally tell from Ed's work, and it pays off.
00:13:45.224 - 00:14:09.080, Speaker A: It's a great philosophy, creative philosophy, to have. It took me a long time to get to that human boy who we're gonna see. Wait o you see. Wait till you see where human, like, what human boy has done now. Remember the 330,000 views? Well, that has been utterly eclipsed. We're at, like, 800 and some with the latest image. Like a show later.
00:14:09.080 - 00:14:19.660, Speaker A: Walk. Let's see human boy. What human boy has to say here before we look at human boy's work. Walk. Chansey. Reference is a Pokemon. Pokemon card, so that's what those are.
00:14:19.660 - 00:14:31.250, Speaker A: Thank you for featuring my artwork in today's episode. Really appreciate it. I'm really enjoying working on this series. And just finished another while watching today's episode. Brilliant. I'll make sure to share in the community. Awesome.
00:14:31.250 - 00:14:58.844, Speaker A: I've always found these episodes a great way to keep me in the art making zone. I'm very pleased to hear that because when I started this show, I was concerned that people were making less art and just kind of, you know, watching more video. So it's great to hear that it's actually having a positive effect on the creative making process. Cal Flemmer. I love the idea of painting a white border on an orange piece of paper just to mess with the viewer. Yes, I'm glad you enjoy that. I'm proud of that one.
00:14:58.844 - 00:15:10.180, Speaker A: It's kind of a fun way of being. It's kind of prankster esque. Right. And it's kind of like, you know, I kind of love it. There's humor in it, actually. So I'm glad you enjoy that. Kyle, great to hear from you.
00:15:10.180 - 00:15:17.732, Speaker A: And human boy and Ed, awesome. Tornado Rodriguez. Another day, another journal. Awesome to hear from you. Boo. Great to hear from you. Rad art.
00:15:17.732 - 00:15:34.646, Speaker A: Indeed, indeed. Nika bar. Love that you do this well. Thank you. And thank you for watching Kurt Hussle collective recycling the lemons and that brilliant work there. And thank you for sending me one, actually. Kurt Hussle collective KHC on object yacht.
00:15:34.646 - 00:15:48.014, Speaker A: You're important for the community. Keep doing that. Poco. Well, I appreciate that and I'm glad you feel that way. And it's nice to know, you know, again, that this doesn't fall on deaf ears or that people care. So I appreciate that. Yott, a walk.
00:15:48.014 - 00:16:01.354, Speaker A: Thank you. My pleasure. Two masterpieces by walk last show. If you never saw that last show, the lady die or princess die. I can't remember. That was brilliant. And the Caravaggio remix.
00:16:01.354 - 00:16:09.466, Speaker A: Braindead. Great to hear from you. Ilya. Awesome to hear from you. Mika Oladef. Awesome. Who makes all those awesome glitch works.
00:16:09.466 - 00:16:18.826, Speaker A: Darkspace machine. And here's cedar Plank. The elusive cedar plank. Thank you. Poco. All the best to you. How did I miss that? Thank you, Cedar.
00:16:18.826 - 00:16:38.576, Speaker A: Always great to hear from you. What a wonderful world where Cedar plank is commenting on your show. So always wonderful to hear from you. Brilliant. Ok, Oxdk. Thank you for the advice. Adrian.
00:16:38.576 - 00:16:52.992, Speaker A: Just go. Yeah. Awesome. I'm glad it's resonating. I wish I'd heard that when I was 20 years old. Russel and Vieltsev, the preview, actually, we're going to look at a work in the community by Rusland. So really cool work there.
00:16:52.992 - 00:17:01.040, Speaker A: Denise Sanchez, I think we have a work by you this episode too. Great to hear from you. PP. Awesome to hear from you. Brilliant work. Bosque. Gracias.
00:17:01.040 - 00:17:08.624, Speaker A: What an amazing show. Full of ideas and transparent view of art. Thank you so much. My absolute pleasure. Bosque. See you in Berlin. Let me know when you come.
00:17:08.624 - 00:17:35.650, Speaker A: I love the faces that you make while talking about or pausing between between talking about the kujib piece. Pokebelly well, it comes naturally. Cakes awesome to hear from you. Martin Bruce awesome and underworld first piece is fire. Would love a review of my drop this week. Feel free to post one in particular, especially in the community. Put your favorite in there and we'll take a nice close look there.
00:17:35.650 - 00:17:57.220, Speaker A: So great to hear from you. And speaking of the community, look who it is. Blue 281. Awesome in the community. These super interesting and original kind of looks like black and white bitmap esque. Imagine this screen printed, for example. Another thing you could do is like, again, I keep thinking what you, what I love about simple images.
00:17:57.220 - 00:18:36.360, Speaker A: And by simple I mean low file size in this case is first of all the how easy, how much easier it is to say make it physical. Another thing, this might not be a big file in the sense that maybe bitcoin blue 281 put a series on bitcoin you would not believe. Let's bring up the mempool, my friends. Here's some alpha. So here's your reward for watching this show. I saw it at the lowest I've ever seen. The fees at ten, at ten this morning, 13 is super low and that's high priority.
00:18:36.360 - 00:19:17.128, Speaker A: Don't tell anybody, just your artist friends. The fees are incredibly low on bitcoin right now. Mint while you can, because if this price takes off and the bull market kind of creeps back up, this may be it. You always got to treat it like this is your last chance, you know. So really great opportunity on bitcoin right now to mint your work at a reasonable price or inscribe, as the ordinal folks say. Also, let's just take a quick look at everybody else in the community here, if the phone data will work. Hitsuono, literally me is a.
00:19:17.128 - 00:19:40.132, Speaker A: Literally me is a game about exploration and creation in a typographic world. Hope you like it. So how wild is this? So kind of a game. So Hitsuono, pretty interesting. A poem here. Kind of a programming poem. Kind of feels inevitable, doesn't it, that programming and poetry should fuse, especially by the poets.
00:19:40.132 - 00:20:12.050, Speaker A: You know, you could just imagine, couldn't you? You know, the poet who is, you know, how do you make poetry relevant and interesting in the 21st century? You probably have someone who knows programming and then you actually are making, you know, incorporating even code into your poetry. Otherwise, I don't know how. Sanro, great to hear from you. Very cool kind of bitmap photo human boy. And we're going to look at this in just a second. This is the work. Wait till you see.
00:20:12.050 - 00:20:24.750, Speaker A: Just leave you in suspense. A minute or two more here. Kells for the culture. And we'll bring that up. That looks like the tez pool there. And another beautiful work by love, these pieces. Hb.
00:20:24.750 - 00:20:39.378, Speaker A: And so does the crowd. Great crowd out there. So does the world, I should say. John Cates. The golden cross appears between our antlers. So just another nice glitch piece. This looks like the glitch that John was doing with the horse, which I adore.
00:20:39.378 - 00:20:56.668, Speaker A: And here's Ruslan Byeltsev, GM. Everyone here is blasters. So I love this, these art pfps profile picture projects. I love it. This is like. I think this is really cool. Like, we saw that with gogolitis also.
00:20:56.668 - 00:21:12.580, Speaker A: So Kurt hustle collective. Awesome. And I think I like to note the date of the heidi thing each year in relation to swifts by Ted Hughes. 20. I felt I saw hardly any swifts at all. So not exactly sure. And this we saw last episode.
00:21:12.580 - 00:21:28.960, Speaker A: So here is the work posted by Kells. And Kells mentioned there was a work posted by Kells or an image that was not by Kells. That with the special coloring, I thought it was. That was a mistake. The artist currently known as tezyphus. So kind of a sisyphus. Cool.
00:21:28.960 - 00:21:40.660, Speaker A: Looks like object 98. It's a nice. It's a nice tool. Albert Camus. Awesome shout out to kelz. Great to hear from you. Katya Kazakhina.
00:21:40.660 - 00:22:03.556, Speaker A: Look at this. So surrealist painting in a tough market. $28 million for this. Leonara Lenara Carrington at Sotheby's. A surrealist artist. I don't know if she was. I kind of want to say she was married to Max Ernst, Lenora Carrington, but I'm not exactly sure.
00:22:03.556 - 00:22:25.942, Speaker A: But all to say, though, a great surrealist painter in her own right. And here is, I think, the bidder. And it was like classic. It was a bidding war. So I think it was. Last time it went for 475,000. And so I don't know what the estimate was, but this was a classic bidding war.
00:22:25.942 - 00:23:27.818, Speaker A: And it just goes to show, even in a market that's kind of, especially, you know what I think the contemporary art market is actually what's really cooling off. If you have something that's kind of more historical value, so to speak, or more proven over time, even like old masters or especially the surrealists, I have a feeling those haven't gone down. I think the market's getting more selective and it's starting to just be a little bit safer. We see that in the regular financial markets as well as in NFT kind of art scene. It's kind of like these safer plays. The market's gotten more selective. Could be healthy, right? Like if all of a sudden, you know, random contemporary art that maybe isn't worth, you know, half a million dollars and whatever, maybe it's good if that kind of gets brought back down to earth and, you know, you come back to real valuations again, just on tape, it's like, look at tasos.
00:23:27.818 - 00:23:58.204, Speaker A: It's not like works aren't selling. The market is resilient. So all to say, a pretty interesting work. And that is the work. And, yeah, this guy tried to bid. I was the underbidder 30 years ago for this picture and I didn't want to miss it this time, said Eduardo Constantini, who prevailed in a ten minute bidding war for Lenora Carrington at Sotheby's. So it just goes to show, you know, if two people want it, it can get, you know, a price can go anywhere.
00:23:58.204 - 00:24:27.560, Speaker A: I think of Legojo when we were bidding on that hastrubal waffle piece, which, you know, most histrubal waffles were going for like 100 tezos at the time, and we bid it all the way up to 750. I was ready to keep going, too. Yeah, that's why I don't have my bitcoin anymore. Not for that one specifically, but for that mentality when you get into the fever of collecting, it's. Yeah, watch out. Continuing on. Unknown collector, hot take.
00:24:27.560 - 00:25:06.190, Speaker A: This is interesting. I actually have a much different view on this, but let's bring in the hot take. Individual pieces of digital art will be a lot less important artistically in the future than we are used to. Than we're used to it from the past for artworks, I think actually the exact opposite. Shout out to unknown collector, though. I love UC. And so in the spirit of just good conversation, but I've actually commented many times just on the spaces whenever that I feel like the digital art market is different, where it's not as based on series and it's actually much more based on individual works.
00:25:06.190 - 00:25:24.542, Speaker A: So. But a completely different take here from unknown collector. Let's see what UC says. Series of works will matter much more. We already see that development for years now with the camera, there are photos that stand for themselves, but a lot can only live and show their artistic value inside a series of works. Interesting. Now, photos.
00:25:24.542 - 00:25:48.570, Speaker A: I'm. Yeah, I'm not. Definitely not an expert on same for generative art, interestingly. Yeah, for generative art, I could see this being true. And even for photography, I think, you know what, digital art specifically though, like, I think people can get lucky. I think it happens. I think people can get lucky where they make a kind of really cool pixel artwork.
00:25:48.570 - 00:26:22.194, Speaker A: You know, it's sort of like the rainbow cat and everything. And I think that artist has made a lot of good stuff before, but there is can be luck involved and where you just kind of put together and it becomes like a meme thing and that person doesn't necessarily, and I'm not talking about the. I think it's the Niman cat or something like that. I'm not talking about that person specifically. But I think people can get lucky and where they just kind of have the right circumstances and kind of have their funny thing and then all of a sudden they make a great work. You can get lucky with art, I would argue. And I think.
00:26:22.194 - 00:26:45.910, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's continue here now with AI, let's say raw or close to raw image. AI a single piece does close to nothing with interesting. You need to show your vision and narrative in a series for them to have any relevance. Yeah, I think that's generally true. It's an interesting question. Again, I always think of what I loosely call the masterpiece here.
00:26:45.910 - 00:27:27.592, Speaker A: Strange things, thug lord. Like, if strange thing had never made another great work, would that work retain its value? It's an interesting question. Maybe not as much as it might have now. Just, you know, so, you know, so I take the point, and I have to say, like within these contexts, I kind of, I do tend, I would say, I agree, the friction to create a single work will just get lower and lower. In the future, you will probably be able to create everything with AI, from three d to games and more without much technical knowledge. So the artistic vision and ideas will stand out. What do you think? You know, really interesting.
00:27:27.592 - 00:28:06.494, Speaker A: Again, in the clownvamp spaces that we had this idea of coherence, this is what the AI people are calling, loosely called AI people are calling to the ability to create a work, make a persuasive work. They call it coherence. It's like, okay, we've solved for coherence is what Clownvamp was saying. We know how to make coherent works, interestingly. So anyways, let's continue here. Thank you. Unknown collector.
00:28:06.494 - 00:28:39.932, Speaker A: Interesting provocation there. And actually after I read everything, I tended to agree with most of it, I would say just with digital art specifically, that is kind of like, you know, created, you know, I think you can get lucky was sort of the moral of the story. Wondermundo, is Tezos officially dead? Are you still minted there? So I'd say clearly not as you're gonna see here in this episode. And great. Tezos artist, human boy. So here we are at 820,000. Now, I reloaded this just before the show, so I'd get the latest number.
00:28:39.932 - 00:29:07.562, Speaker A: Let's see if we can reload again just to show you. Yeah, 15,000 more in, I guess, the last 30 minutes. So that's how fast. So it looks like we're closing in on a million and a similar dynamic, or we might say a similar kind of work to what we saw before with human boy. And remember, it looked like x rays and skulls. And then it was like a fast juxtaposition of different images. This seems to be the formula.
00:29:07.562 - 00:29:46.114, Speaker A: And it's interesting because in crypto art, you know, I think Sabato has commented, like, oh, if I just make it flashing, people will like it, this sort of thing. And this is interesting because it's, it is kind of flashing, but it's actually more than flashing, it's actually different images juxtaposed. And so just very interesting. So again, now you could argue human boy got lucky the first time, right? But then two days later, here's human boy again, and then almost three xing the previous high. So nice. And it looks great. So very cool.
00:29:46.114 - 00:30:02.676, Speaker A: So congratulations to human boy. We will continue to follow this closely. Drive. So another work. So here's a still work by human boy. And it does look like some AI in this. And also in the interface here, big congrats.
00:30:02.676 - 00:30:35.108, Speaker A: And it just goes to show. So see here, you know, 6000 views. So you just keep kind of throwing darts and then all of a sudden you hit the bullseye and boom. And look, human boy, when we checked last time, human boy was at something like 2500 followers. Human boy has picked up like 2000 followers in like two days. So just awesome. And, you know, even this show, like, thank you, human boy, for, you know, posting this on your page because I was seeing like, even the show finally maybe I got rid of that.
00:30:35.108 - 00:31:02.672, Speaker A: The show had something like 17,000 views, which is pretty good. So all to say. And then we should get, I think it's because it's on human Boys page and generally it tends to get like maybe 15 or 14, but this is pretty good this far into it. So who knows? All to say, thank you, human boy. And big congratulations. Go young. So we saw the work.
00:31:02.672 - 00:31:22.304, Speaker A: And it turned out it was going to be. So we saw a few of the works by Goyang earlier this week. I think it was official announcement. My first open edition nap is open. So this is a nap is 0.04 eth. So what is that? Is that dollar 150 maybe on base? This is available to collect until May 16 at 01:00 p.m.
00:31:22.304 - 00:31:46.576, Speaker A: so you got to get it in the next few hours here link below. Thank you everybody who congratulated me on my first open edition. I didn't expect so many people to reach out and everything. So again, just a beautiful work here. So available on manifold and 70 minted. So 70 times 0.4. What is that? Ten would be 0.4.
00:31:46.576 - 00:32:06.982, Speaker A: So yeah, 2.8 eth. I mean, so what is that, like $8,000 more? So here it is on manifold. Right. Interestingly, let's continue cider. So here's the translation from Portuguese by Google. Guess who did this? And so here, let's check it out.
00:32:06.982 - 00:32:40.164, Speaker A: Translate posts cover of brazilian album released in 2024 that artists crumpled. So I think cider here. This seems pretty clearly to be a cider or someone influenced by cider. This looks like a cider, doesn't it? So how cool is that doing album covers? So congrats, I think to cider. Looks nice album cover, very cool. And here's demon ego, I think also working on an album cover. And this looked like elements from that album cover we're seeing.
00:32:40.164 - 00:32:58.876, Speaker A: So how cool is that? And again, someone was saying here, this sort of dithered work could be very interesting on BTC. Yeah. So fees are low. Now's your chance. Demon ego leprochant. I made the largest. I made the largest woodcut in the world with a wooden spoon and a set of gouges.
00:32:58.876 - 00:33:14.020, Speaker A: It's possible. Took me more than a month. Now I have it lying in the garage. But it is cute. Unfortunately, it's kind of a dark picture. I'm not sure why, but pretty cool. I don't know if he actually used a wooden spoon, but maybe.
00:33:14.020 - 00:33:37.912, Speaker A: So anyways, massive woodcut. I wonder how you transfer that? Or like, is this the work? Unfortunately, it's so dark we can't tell if this is the result of the woodcut or the woodcut itself. If you follow me. Is this the print or is this the woodcut that you'd press the paper on? Or canvas maybe in this case. This is massive. Anyways, very interesting. Leprechant.
00:33:37.912 - 00:33:55.346, Speaker A: Very cool. Here's acid boy in the studio. And so it begins. So a studio. This is what acid boy's studio looks like, I assume. Envelopes and everything looks like. It almost looks like modular synthesizers here, Okote.
00:33:55.346 - 00:34:29.562, Speaker A: So occote continues to do very well here. So now in this magazine, look at Okote's rise here in just a matter of like two or three months. It's a great honor for me to have my art featured in the latest issue of Unuen Sarriergo on artificial intelligence with revista Yudam text, which I share below. So how cool is that? And you can see it here. I mean, very nice. So Okote, before you know it, Okote's gonna be having museum shows here. So just very cool.
00:34:29.562 - 00:35:02.766, Speaker A: It's a true honor to have my art review this on XDev in the most recent issue of Unam magazine. Thank you, Unyen Zarjego, for your text. And so very cool. So congrats again to Okote, who is now, you know, there's something to be said for having your work in a book, right? I mean, it just makes it look more important and everything. So it's just great pr. Get your work published somehow. I have a friend, for example, my friend Bob, he's a photographer, he got these little books made of his photos, and then he'll just like.
00:35:02.766 - 00:35:21.334, Speaker A: He has five of them. And he's just like, if people want to know, he's just like, here you go, ten pages. It's kind of cool. So all to say there's something for seeing it in print, it's like. It's kind of the equivalent of if you. If you read it, you kind of think it's truer because you read it. Because it's something that's published.
00:35:21.334 - 00:35:46.896, Speaker A: There's. It kind of creates a. An epistemological bias, is what I'd be tempted to call that epistemology. For those that don't know, I assume most of you know, theory of knowledge, how we know what we know. So knowledge bias. You tend to think it's realer than it is, just than it might be, just because it's published more of these kind of beautiful mech txt experiments. Who did this one? Bosque grazias.
00:35:46.896 - 00:36:00.298, Speaker A: Helping mech to restore the garden. Awesome. So it almost looks like a video game. My new masterpiece, feeding the birds. And so this is retro Manny. So also using mech's tool. These are beautiful.
00:36:00.298 - 00:36:11.818, Speaker A: Shall we go? Wait. Yes. So all very cool. Now here's a masterpiece. Another masterpiece by NUV, 1914. Probably sold for a song. Could have added a zero on this one.
00:36:11.818 - 00:37:04.908, Speaker A: If you ask me, tentezos, for this gorgeous work here, this brilliant work, as you see the different trees and this person, you know, seems like a woman and, you know, picking flowers, maybe, and look at the fields again, it's tempting to call this a masterpiece here. This is beautiful, this is powerful, this is important, this is significant. At the end of the day, it's all about significance over here for me. Look at these beautiful flowers, the fun, the experimentation. And this is, again, the value of being prolific, where all sudden, like this was minted on the same day as this work. These interiors are incredibly powerful, Arpa. So I assume that means harp.
00:37:04.908 - 00:37:37.110, Speaker A: And there's the cat. Kind of an interior here with the fireplace. Two brilliant works of art here. Totally original, sophisticated, almost what I'd call mature work, with all of the work that NUV 1914 is putting out only ten tazos. So, you know, if you sell it for this price, you will always sell your work if you're making works like this. So beautiful work. We're going to look at that sky Goodman later.
00:37:37.110 - 00:38:04.040, Speaker A: Martin Bruce, check out this work here. Quite interesting as ever. Speaking almost kind of reminiscent, you see a kind of similar dynamic to the fields there. I mean, not totally. And then these beautiful, what look like sampled brushes here, but there seems to be a physicality to it. Just really cool experimentation here from Martin Bruce. Just, again, kind of head turning.
00:38:04.040 - 00:38:38.330, Speaker A: And here, we've seen this work a couple of times, but we never saw it actually minted and everything. So this is rinifish fungal fantasyland. And I think there should be some. Usually there's audio. There we go. I think you can see the fungus over top there. So just really, again, mature artwork from rinnefish.
00:38:38.330 - 00:39:06.480, Speaker A: It's a really great thing when artists just keep going and keep going and keep going, and then, you know, you start getting works like we're looking at here. Axing with just a cool gif. Kind of looks like a crop, perhaps, of another, maybe the apple. Real vision pro being referenced here. Some tablets with some drawn pixels on it. Just interesting piece, interesting color. So we'll see what happens there.
00:39:06.480 - 00:39:31.268, Speaker A: Marcello Pinel, pelican. This part of bestiary series, 23 creatures based on main medieval bestiaries. Kind of has a bit of a. Kind of reminiscent of. There is kind of a greek mythology kind of feel to this, but this is medieval bestiary. Okay, interesting. And look at that.
00:39:31.268 - 00:39:58.940, Speaker A: Kind of medieval creatures is what this looks like. Very cool work. So, yeah, a modern version of these medieval creatures, courtesy of Marcelo Pinel. Brilliant. And here is mumble Boyden, another very early digital collage using the symmetry trick and also using some of the same elements. This is quite beautiful, I thought. I love the crossword puzzle here in here.
00:39:58.940 - 00:40:29.334, Speaker A: And it just. There's something quite beautiful again, about this artwork. And it does. I wonder if this is all physical. But if it is all physical, then how did this blue get so flat? Is that blue paper this is on? What is the size of this work? So anyway, interesting work by mumble boy once sold to guru, guru hyena fortezos. Nice piece here is wasteman Goldman, no good clown. So here the burger is on the head.
00:40:29.334 - 00:41:03.530, Speaker A: The clown is looking. It almost looks like a german expressionist painting from like the 1910s or twenties. And interesting, the tattoo of the kind of the what you use the burger flipper and I don't see the McDonald's on the cigarette. So maybe a different brand of cigarettes here, but kind of sad clown. No good clown. So 75 tezos on object. Another interesting, provocative work here by Turkrack secretary.
00:41:03.530 - 00:41:41.320, Speaker A: So here, the lecherous boss looking over at the secretary, pouring the coffee. Kind of a classic Turkarak work. Looking at more just the edgier side, shall we say, of human nature. Nice kind of, you know, this is a newer, I'd say the last like six months kind of style here for Turkarak. It, you know, just these kind of rougher, kind of painterly like elements. I'd say it's like continues to come in, it continues to mature, shall we say, it continues to come into its own. This whole kind of textured process.
00:41:41.320 - 00:41:57.300, Speaker A: So interesting piece, as usual. Only 15 tezos edition of one. Looks like it might have been burned. Continuing on Ewi with another really interesting drawing. GM with three suns in one. In you from the collection. Three suns.
00:41:57.300 - 00:42:15.330, Speaker A: This might be from an older piece. Kind of like how it almost loosely evokes sheet music a little bit. A nice surreal illustration here. And here's another one by Santiago Ruau, inspired by the surreal, by the surreal app logo. Interesting. Quite a beautiful work. Square.
00:42:15.330 - 00:42:34.522, Speaker A: There's something to be said for square works. Quite beautiful, isn't it? Great color, nice composition. And so eight minted so far. And this is available on Zora. Here is Katarina create. Blooming creation number twelve. And this sold for 15 tezos, a one of one.
00:42:34.522 - 00:42:54.658, Speaker A: And so cool summer vibes from Katarina. Create. And here, just cool kind of figure here with white hair, some butterflies, warm colors. Just fun blooming creation number twelve. Here's Zozo with a kind of a rarer. I think this is. Yeah.
00:42:54.658 - 00:43:11.878, Speaker A: This is brand new El Pescador. Keeping us guessing over here. Keeping everybody guessing. Zozo with a still work, a illustration. So pretty interesting. Kind of someone fishing, maybe. And this is an edition of one for 21 tezos, still available.
00:43:11.878 - 00:43:26.438, Speaker A: If you want a canvas from Zozo, you can still get it. Oh, my God. I draw it. OMG, I draw it. The last artist. So the intelligence was artificial, but that didn't stop it from holding a grudge. So maybe a commentary on Aih, edition of 30.
00:43:26.438 - 00:43:44.862, Speaker A: Now, 51 tezos, I think, on secondary. And here is the last artist. Pretty rad, fun artwork here with a person painting on a screen, seemingly. And these robots here looks like Magnus robot fighter. And so. Wow. These are 51 tezos on primary.
00:43:44.862 - 00:43:58.996, Speaker A: Incredible. Two left. So. OMG, I draw it, I think a pretty old school let's look at the here and now collection. We haven't actually looked at that. So here, this is. I think I have this.
00:43:58.996 - 00:44:11.468, Speaker A: Palestine is a sunbathing sunbird. So we have that. Yeah. So all sorts of work. I didn't realize it was such a big show. We saw the Santiago work. I think we might have seen the Semha work, simulacrus.
00:44:11.468 - 00:44:28.092, Speaker A: So check it out. There's an axine there. Oh. So here's the full engagement. Farming cubicle number 27, edition of 33. And accepting offers of 33. So this looks like that work, doesn't it, that we're just looking at.
00:44:28.092 - 00:44:43.780, Speaker A: So here's the full canvas. Very cool from Euxine. Look at how beautifully painted that is. And this interesting green. The color continues to creep in to Euxine's work. Just great. 158 tezos on secondary.
00:44:43.780 - 00:44:59.654, Speaker A: And here's another one by Legio X, who I'm sure I followed. Let's make sure, because if not, I will follow. Now. I do follow ledgeox. Okay, excellent. So just a cool snake here with some geometry in the background. Cool work.
00:44:59.654 - 00:45:21.200, Speaker A: And here is Sebasto Sistaro with more tennis work. So we were looking at this one. I hadn't seen this. So here are the two others from this series. Just very cool and fun. Interesting how it blurs out a little bit of. And here's another one with the tennis ball blurred out like what a composition.
00:45:21.200 - 00:45:54.112, Speaker A: What a radical, fun, imaginative composition. And just look at the color. And this neon green, you know, not yellow green, but neon, just like green against the purple. Very interesting work. And great series. You know, to UC's point, seeing them all together does kind of make them feel even more precious, perhaps. Because the thing with seeing things in a series is you see the consistency and you see things that all of some things that you think, oh, maybe that's just getting lucky.
00:45:54.112 - 00:46:18.162, Speaker A: And you see, oh, it's not getting lucky because you see it in the series. A consistency. So to UC's point, to be fair. Babes by Petra voice. Interesting work here. Interesting. Just kind of, again, kind of these sharp contrast here with these kind of fuzzy, you know, contrasts in the background.
00:46:18.162 - 00:46:30.738, Speaker A: Almost like depth of field, but different. Right. Kind of painterly. Interesting. Petra voice and Anzora. Here's Denise Sanchez levitating 300 dpi. So I couldn't tell.
00:46:30.738 - 00:46:51.932, Speaker A: And I brought it up actually large here. I think this is. I thought this was a digital artwork. It's actually from March, but hard to say. It could be both. It could be physical with digital effects. Anyway, interesting abstract here from Denise Sanchez levitating 300 dpi.
00:46:51.932 - 00:47:15.384, Speaker A: Five minted so far. And you can still get it on Zora. Continuing on, Ugodigi analog factory. Zora number five, a nice smaller one. I like how UgO seems to have changed up the series. I haven't seen the other ones on Zora, but it seems to have changed up the series to a simpler version for Zora. How's it doing? 56 minted.
00:47:15.384 - 00:47:26.340, Speaker A: That's pretty good. Creator earnings 0.02 what is that, like $60? Not bad at all. Maybe more. $70. That's great. And just beautiful work.
00:47:26.340 - 00:47:46.178, Speaker A: Taking what looks like an element from those larger works on object. Seemingly cute farm. This is Silva Santuz. Really nice. Again, another really just interesting. It's got a nice paste to it. Another interesting glitch Rom from Silva sand twos.
00:47:46.178 - 00:48:03.322, Speaker A: It's like, I think it's the rhythm as well as the color. These things are kind of coming into their own. The timing, it's beautiful. And these little. The choice of screens. Edition of three. Oh, so this is an open edition, only a tezos.
00:48:03.322 - 00:48:24.218, Speaker A: And here is Glitchtown arcade 18. Also a glitch rom, but kind of square. Right? So which is kind of interesting also, this flashing margin, very abstracted out here. I assume this is a glitch Rom. It's even hard to tell, but it's about the right kind of feel. 18. So very interesting piece here.
00:48:24.218 - 00:48:51.756, Speaker A: Nice abstract. Alex Fadimi. I've been embarking on learning more 3d. This is another dream I had that I was able to communicate through images. I'll most likely make this available for free on Arzora. So here, basically a straight up abstract in the background with some actually cool cycling through it with a 3d image, kind of creating an illusion of sorts, almost of space as a result in the background image. So just kind of cool.
00:48:51.756 - 00:49:24.244, Speaker A: Tempted to almost call it op art or abstract, moving abstract. RJ sat after Pierre Bernard's le chat blanc. So RJ back on the scene with some interesting kind of looks like a distorted, transformed cat to a certain degree. So interesting piece with the outline kind of with this kind of flashing, moving area. Just interesting work, interesting composition. As you can see, the black goes all the way to here. You can see the black on black.
00:49:24.244 - 00:49:42.080, Speaker A: So interesting negative space there. Here's another one. Kiss. So Gustave Klimt just taking a. Looking like he's just taking. RJ's just taking pieces of these paintings and almost making them look silver. It's almost like glittering silver, isn't it? Kiss edition of one for 25 tezos.
00:49:42.080 - 00:50:03.940, Speaker A: And here's flint pope with an interesting abstract here that I found on x. So just interesting move here, interesting color, just interesting movement, interesting composition. Kind of original here. This tickles my brain. Exactly. Thank you, de psalter, for the comment there. Francois Gamma.
00:50:03.940 - 00:50:14.730, Speaker A: Let's see if. I don't think. Yeah, there is no volume. Interesting different kind of artworks refining from Francois's gamma here. Right? So here's one. See if this make this a little bigger. Nope.
00:50:14.730 - 00:50:39.580, Speaker A: So here's one, here's another. So you gotta love when Francois Gamma starts going or discovers something new. We'll do like a million different experiments with, you know, really explore say a new software, a new technique, a new process. And you see it here, really interesting. Pretty original. Like, I don't know how. I assume this is, uh.
00:50:39.580 - 00:51:10.642, Speaker A: If I had to guess, this is effects on effects, but not sure. Uh, continuing on. Speaking of no effects, this is Kiro who does pure hardware glitch. Even this snow here at the bottom, this kind of. This is all, you know, quote unquote real. This is all like pure hardware glitchrom according to Kiro. How cool is that? So just very interesting piece here.
00:51:10.642 - 00:51:31.582, Speaker A: Edition of one, only 333. Can I afford this edition of one? I will have to buy this immediately for 333. Is that a mistake? Another 1420 edition of one. I love this piece. Maybe I'll buy this one. I think I have five tazos starluthe. I love this piece.
00:51:31.582 - 00:51:47.350, Speaker A: So Kiro is selling these works for very low prices. Hardware glitch works. Maybe I'll buy this one. This one I found quite poetic. I think we're ending the show with that one. Lumay ish. I think here we are again, for the second time.
00:51:47.350 - 00:52:06.486, Speaker A: So just interesting pixel art on Instagram. I love the UPC code here. Nice touch. Almost like a magazine cover. Here's Annas Abdin, ducktales two. So kind of a fun one from Annas Abdin. Beautiful pixel art again, making a work a day.
00:52:06.486 - 00:52:24.554, Speaker A: And just again, you can, when you do this, I guess you can just make it go on infinite loop. Beautiful, beautiful. Nice shadows there and everything. Heartwarming work from Anna Sabden, freedom plotter. Brain dead. Kind of a conceptual work here. Let's see if we can maximize.
00:52:24.554 - 00:52:51.384, Speaker A: So, trying to figure this out. So the egg in the cage, kind of. I think that's Magritte, right? If as far as just immediate references, this looks like a scanner. This. Is this a printer? Or maybe that's a scanner, too. Is this the bible with a heart on it? Not sure. So kind of a mysterious one from braindead, freedom plotter.
00:52:51.384 - 00:53:12.320, Speaker A: There must be an explanation somewhere. This is 40 tezos edition of one, a really cool one from Lorna Mills. Gorgeous. Love the blue smoke and everything. Can we get closer? There we go. So kind of cut off here a little bit. So I'm not sure if this is new, because Lorna tends to go by color on Instagram, but nice piece.
00:53:12.320 - 00:53:26.700, Speaker A: Really nice piece. Never seen this one. Love how the. How the mask goes around the smoke coming out of the car. Very cool and collected. So this is by DJ Kuro. So I'm not sure if this is a newer one.
00:53:26.700 - 00:54:01.640, Speaker A: And Rannick steer, pick this one up. Nice piece. So Kuro on a roll, doing all sorts of. Again, when you just keep on putting out lots of work, like it goes somewhere, it doesn't take long, actually, for things to go somewhere. And then if you keep that up for months, it really starts to go somewhere, and then you have a pretty large body of work before you know it. So impasto amperes here, another one, doctor version, edition of 33. Kind of a wild, almost a neurotic piece here with these cubes around.
00:54:01.640 - 00:54:31.716, Speaker A: Glitchy, truly glitchy here. Grotesque chic, picking one up at three tainos. This is by Renki, edition of one not listed, as is usually the case. And again, bringing in these kind of. These, you know, pixelated renditions here, adding a little bit of pixelated texture, shall we say, changing the color to black and white or gray and white and black. Acid boy. So we saw acid boy in the studio before.
00:54:31.716 - 00:54:55.884, Speaker A: Maybe this is what happens when you connect all of those little devices there. So some studio experiments seemingly flow stuff from acid boy. Pretty rad. So I assume this is all programming. I think Spiegel's mask auction is live for Ralph. One of one wild work here by Spoogles. Kind of has a bit of a robocop kind of feel to it.
00:54:55.884 - 00:55:10.580, Speaker A: Maybe this is robocop. Wow. Does it say no, there's. Yeah. So not sure. Kind of has a. Again, a bit of a robocop feel to it.
00:55:10.580 - 00:55:33.270, Speaker A: Here's another one by Sprigalls and Elagua. Elaguas profunda. Alleguaz profunda. Becoming Ralph is a new long play narrative by Spiegel's maskinen, with music by elegues profunda, who plays the role of Jack Waterman in the series. And here is the work. So interesting. Ambitious.
00:55:33.270 - 00:56:03.432, Speaker A: A new long play narrative by Spuegels Messkinen, with music. So how cool is that? Interesting, interesting, interesting. Here is Stephen. I want to say daedalus, but that's Ulysses. But I think it starts with a d. Not deny risk. It's not here.
00:56:03.432 - 00:56:18.984, Speaker A: But Steven, we all recognize this artist. And there's the enjoy. And here is the work. Bake simulation. Enjoy tech. So maybe if you do a search on Steven with a v, you will find this work 32 minted so far. And there is the enjoy.
00:56:18.984 - 00:56:38.032, Speaker A: Maybe this is bringing in the enjoy coin. Not sure what that's worth. The enjoy coin. Windows 2002 song. Snowpoint lounge galactic lab infiltration. Kind of a cool work here, isn't it? Especially with the eye, a little bit of humor here, and different variations. Interestingly.
00:56:38.032 - 00:56:52.784, Speaker A: And here's the still work. Interestingly. And your hardware is soulless greek statue. And it has a net art feel to it. Here's a machine, which is pretty interesting work. More Japan. Kind of playing off of.
00:56:52.784 - 00:57:12.050, Speaker A: What's the dinosaur called? In Japanese. In Japanese. Okay, so here's just the trip. But interesting. Kind of looks like AI. I can't remember what you call the dinosaur in japanese Sci-Fi but very famous. It's not King Kong, it's a dinosaur.
00:57:12.050 - 00:57:39.234, Speaker A: Let's continue. Sky Goodman. My newest work, city of Sentience, will be exhibited in LA today as part of the artificial perspective show. Art and music and musings about the state of AI, the good and the bad of it. So it's interesting. AI. I feel like we're at a point where we've seen a ton of AI art come out the last two years, and now it's kind of an interesting time to just think on where we're at and where it's going again.
00:57:39.234 - 00:57:58.964, Speaker A: I point you to the clownvamp show. Cool work from Sky Goodman. Probably using several different, not just AI but also different softwares there. And you probably recognize this artist, Skomra. Love that. Is there a gray line at the top? Interesting. And I love that bottom area here too.
00:57:58.964 - 00:58:13.868, Speaker A: That might be Twitter, that gray line. And here just nice texture. Pretty interesting work, I think. AI artwork. So beautiful work from Skamra. Beautiful trees. We saw this the other day, but just so you know, it's available on auction on object now.
00:58:13.868 - 00:58:32.366, Speaker A: It has been minted. It's a beautiful work. You know, this would be good in Berlin. There's a Berlin bear is really the city's kind of mascot. Stable diffusion and different textual invert and diffusers. Textual inversion edition of one. Now it's seven tazos Santiago putting the bit on.
00:58:32.366 - 00:58:46.148, Speaker A: Beautiful work. And here's Lily Illo. Good morning. Interesting. So here a double face, interestingly from lily Illo. And then the hairdouse is one color on one side and one color on the other. Interesting piece.
00:58:46.148 - 00:59:12.046, Speaker A: Nice textured background, kind of painterly from lily illo as we go into the physicals. It's not a gallery. JErRy AJ not sure what the reference is here, but I just think it's interesting. Kind of reminds me there's also an artist that paints memes who's quite popular. Christina. Christina. Someone I'm sure someone out there knows kind of reminds me of that artist, but tends to be an acrylic.
00:59:12.046 - 00:59:30.410, Speaker A: Christina, I can't remember her last name. Kind of has a similar vibe. Jerry AJ here is psycho udini. Contemporary young people. I love the title contemporary young people looking on at an atomic explosion. Maybe they're being vaporized. Maybe in another way.
00:59:30.410 - 00:59:55.030, Speaker A: Acrylic on canvas, 100 by 81. And if being broke was a job, this is also. It's not gallery. Megan Dominescu I'd say it's not gallery. I've probably shown this gallery more than any other by far in the physical artwork section. This gallery is important to state the obvious, I would argue. Clearly, because I keep showing their works.
00:59:55.030 - 01:00:15.972, Speaker A: Kind of paradigm. Creating gallery here like deserves a lot of credit. How many followers? I guess 47,000. Those are probably all real followers, though, unlike some of the galleries that you might find that are more famous, you know, larger. So that's probably all organic. I wish we could. 611 likes, but that's not bad on Instagram.
01:00:15.972 - 01:00:33.810, Speaker A: Anyways, if being broke was a job, so kind of a humorous work. Interesting textures. Here's Blair Saxon Hill. Fear, pain and worry. Interesting painting here. So there's a ton of interesting painting coming out right now. Here is x hunt, soul x escape.
01:00:33.810 - 01:01:20.186, Speaker A: So Instagram has become truly a brilliant tool for discovering physical artwork. I'd argue better than going to an art fair. Like if I was a hardcore physical collector, first I'd bring up walks, eBay. I'd bookmark that page, walks ebay page. And then I'd probably go on Instagram and I'd start looking for artists like this, you know, the new artists out there that you can probably get the works for a few hundred dollars, maybe a couple thousand, like we saw with that Kayla Mattis work, that early, important Caleb Addis work. Looking at it was something at like two or $3,000 or expected, you know, which is a lot of money. But compared to what people are spending for contemporary, you know, half a million dollars for other contemporary art, you see where the opportunities maybe are.
01:01:20.186 - 01:01:32.164, Speaker A: Taylor, a white, coming soon to Taipei. Dang dai. Another interesting artist here. Bold. You see the humor. I call it the new humorous. A beautiful work by Bondozo Bandido.
01:01:32.164 - 01:02:01.700, Speaker A: I think Hermes, Enrique, if I'm not mistaken. Just in the studio and you see the airbrush working fast. Love how this almost video game like path turns into the flute player. Really just a really cool artist. I love the whimsicality and actually the courage at the end of the day of this artist. And a really nice piece by Adam Lister playing after Basquiat. So after Basquiat's famous skull, very cool execution here.
01:02:01.700 - 01:02:19.212, Speaker A: Nice piece. And of course, walk with another. This looks like a self portrait. Another powerful, powerful, powerful. Iconic. Tempting to call it self portrait by walk, which is what we end the show with. Thank you for joining me.
01:02:19.212 - 01:02:27.352, Speaker A: I hope you have a wonderful weekend. We make a bunch of great art. Bitcoin fees are low. So are Ethereum. Take advantage. Don't tell anyone but your artist friends. Thank you.
01:02:27.352 - 01:02:29.120, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
