00:00:04.920 - 00:00:48.675, Speaker A: My first words of the morning to you, my friends all around the world. Unbelievably, back in summer, here in Berlin, Germany. My name's Adrian Pokabelli. Artist Journal, August 28, 2024. Many masterpieces to go through, my friends. So many after that epic trip to Argentina, Buenos Aires, winter. You know, I was joking with people after I visited or while I was visiting, I was joking with people that this could be called like, the Argentinian, like, Art Hour, practically.
00:00:48.675 - 00:01:14.495, Speaker A: It's quite. You know, if I had to guess, it's like 30%, maybe more Argentinian artists here. And I didn't quite realize. I kept meeting people in Argentina, in Buenos Aires, that were. That were from the show, that I didn't realize that were from Argentina. I just got a message last night, actually. So are you still in Argentina? I'm like, you're from Argentina.
00:01:14.495 - 00:01:41.137, Speaker A: So all to say, maybe it's not shocking that I ended up there. In retrospect, so much to look at here today. It's maybe not the most surprising work here that I am starting with. Many of you have seen it, but it is just such a stunner. I'm sad I missed it. Sometimes you really just got a. You know, the difference, you know, me missing this artwork is, you know, as I tell people, the difference.
00:01:41.137 - 00:02:21.527, Speaker A: You know, sometimes we think of success as being like, so far away in this, you know, this un. Gap that will never be filled or unreachable other side. But other times, but I tell people, at least in my head, you know, so I suspect, you know, sometimes we all think it's this far away, you know, success, but sometimes it's like this far away. And this is how it was with collecting this work here by Yuri J. I could have picked it up, but I didn't put in that tiny effort to pick it up. And now I don't have it. This beautiful work, which, you know, again, there are many works I could have started with, but this just.
00:02:21.527 - 00:02:40.215, Speaker A: I just couldn't not start with this. So, Yuri J. What is this called? There's a lot to go through here. Another ketchup show. Easy Chair by Yuri J. Edition of 20, selling for only nine tazos. You know, $6.
00:02:40.215 - 00:03:08.535, Speaker A: You could have bought this digital. Attempting to call Masterpiece for $6. Let me show you why and everything. So, as we always say here, the outlines of our lives with Yuri J. So the technique here, and look at these textures on the floor in the chair, really capturing the texture of a. I guess it's an easy Chair. What is this Called again, Easy Chair.
00:03:08.535 - 00:03:54.079, Speaker A: As I always say, the outlines are really excuses to put in different kinds of textures and patterns here, different kinds of digital textures. And often, again, you know, a secret weapon, I would argue, I want to say for artists is. But, you know, revealed here regularly is effects on effects. And I was mentioning this at one point with Yuri J's work, and there's classic Yuri J iconography with the clock. I was mentioning this at one point with Yuri J's work, and I believe, if memory serves, Yuri J was like, yes, yes, and yes. You know, layering Photoshop effects on top of each other. This is not one effect, this is several effects.
00:03:54.079 - 00:04:16.675, Speaker A: Let's go here. I mean, what do we see? I mean, I always pointed out the Mosaic filter. I think it's called, like, the pixelation filter. It's in pixelation in Photoshop. But this isn't just that. This is, you know, this is, you know, more than just one filter. And it's kind of like using more than one software.
00:04:16.675 - 00:05:01.325, Speaker A: It shows the. Like, it's kind of important, in a sense, I don't want to say, to cover your tracks, but you don't want it to seem too obvious how you made your work. Because if it's that obvious and it really is just hitting a button, then it's not too exciting, is it? Like, sometimes I'll get great results on something, but it'll just be like one, you know, one or two steps in a process. And then I go, well, that looks great and everything, but I can't release that. Right? It's too easy. There is a sense of it being too easy if you only have, you might say, one or two steps in the process here, what we see. And again, what makes me so bullish on this scene is the evolution.
00:05:01.325 - 00:05:35.795, Speaker A: You know, as I was saying with AI, if there was no Yuri J, could AI make Yuri J. If Yuri J didn't exist. And I think this is just more evidence that says, no, this. But who knows? But actually, I think quite clearly, no. Once there's a Yuri J, maybe at a certain point, one could imagine AI could make more Uri js. AI could probably make more Picassos, right? More George Seuras. But look at again, I don't want to take too long on this, but it is worth noting.
00:05:35.795 - 00:05:55.333, Speaker A: I mean, let's just look closely here. Look at the wallpaper. Look at the blue texture here. Look at the painterliness, look at the textures. And then contrasting here we have a little shelf. You have the clock. And what is this like a pink Spray over top, which is also here we have another classic move by Uri J.
00:05:55.333 - 00:06:25.325, Speaker A: Signature. The hopefully this unfreezes on us here, the. Here we go. And the lamp being repeated. Right? Another signature move, but not repeating everything and just going a little bit to the side. So just awesome work here. The noise here, the shadow, even the chair itself.
00:06:25.325 - 00:07:01.665, Speaker A: I mean, perhaps it sounds like an exaggeration, but I mean, what work do you think of? What work do you think of when you see this work? I mean, are you the same as me? I think of Van Gogh's chair. Is this a new digital version of Van Gogh's chair? It's hard not to see that in a lot of ways. And I love the light socket here. Anyways, Easy Chair sold out at nine tezos. And it was funny even. How do putting in a respectable 16 Tezos offer here. So howdy do.
00:07:01.665 - 00:07:39.275, Speaker A: Recognizing the value here and still nobody's. Someone accepted an offer for 20. Interesting spam. Yeti accepted an offer for 20. So yeah, so this one, you know, when I look back, what I think about this work and again, why I wish I had it for the museum in my mind, this museum of in the future that may actually exist once these works are celebrated in a large way around the world. I looked at this work and I thought, oh, this work looks like it's going to be worth a fortune is what it looks like to me. So.
00:07:39.275 - 00:08:20.635, Speaker A: And not just that, like it's a gorgeous work, one you want in your collection. And just finally, I mean, another kind of observation here. I mean, first, I mean, there are so many observations to make. But you know what else I love about this work is the flatness. Like we see the outline here, but then it's just kind of filled. And what does that remind you of? Doesn't it remind you of Picasso when he does the clothing? And then the person is in a way where the pattern of the clothing should be different and should adjust to the creases in the shirt and everything, but he just keeps it uniform. I see a similar thing going on here.
00:08:20.635 - 00:08:34.081, Speaker A: So again, and even just over here, we're seeing digital art. Virtuosity is. I'd argue what we're seeing here. Uri J. I mean, minting. Shall we look very quickly. When did Yuri J.
00:08:34.081 - 00:08:54.816, Speaker A: Start? And I mean, we have more we're going to look at here, but let's look at the year. You know, classic, you know, hick et nunc. Here is the origin piece or what do they call it? I can't remember. What do they Call the first Degenesis work, as they call it. June 14, 2021. Hicket nunc. 8 edition of 8.
00:08:54.816 - 00:09:06.037, Speaker A: No, you can buy one for 5,000. There's howdy do again. Howdy do, love, Zuri J. Look at howdy do. That is hilarious. A true legend. Howdy do as.
00:09:06.037 - 00:09:25.525, Speaker A: As is Yuri J. I'm just curious what the last sale was. 15 tazos to Mikey Wilson. Nice, nice, nice. So there it goes. So June 14, 2021, already looking pretty impressive, actually. And look at where we are now.
00:09:25.525 - 00:09:46.485, Speaker A: So here's another one. Yuri J. Has been incredibly prolific the last couple of weeks here, writing table again, same thing. Insanely gorgeous textures. A domestic modern scene. It looks like a desk and a lamp that could be in anybody's house. We see in the previous work, we saw a light socket.
00:09:46.485 - 00:10:25.799, Speaker A: Here we see a beautiful cup of coffee, actually, maybe tea here with the teabag. And look at the floor and the light coming in. Remember that essay that RJ wrote? Like the greatest work on Hicket Nunk. And it was a Yuri J. So, Yuri J. Interesting writing table again. When you think of the museum of the future that may be celebrating these works, the museums of the future that may be celebrating these works, surely if you want to contribute to that museum, you may want to pick up some Yuri J's cheese grater.
00:10:25.799 - 00:10:41.875, Speaker A: What is this called? Grate again. So here, maybe a coffee, maybe a tea. It does not matter. Look at this in the background. I don't even know what that is. Again, it does not matter. I can recognize the cheese grater.
00:10:41.875 - 00:11:04.929, Speaker A: And look at these. Look at this. Like, look at the top. So we're starting to see virtuosity here. And actually we have been seeing virtuosity before. But put it this way, where I'm going with this is what I've been saying for the last few weeks here. The most bullish thing in this scene is that it continues to evolve.
00:11:04.929 - 00:11:40.893, Speaker A: And what we're seeing here and is the artists who are continuing to evolve. And as long as they stay, as long as they keep producing, I mean, that's the most bullish thing of all. I mean, where this has been. We looked at it 2021-2024. It's been a little over three years. Where will this be in another three years? Where will this be in 10 years? Should these artists continue to produce? Our opening question of the day here. So big thank you to everybody who showed up to Dr.
00:11:40.893 - 00:12:07.545, Speaker A: Bill Kolomachek. I highly recommend you listen to this. It was excellent. It was fascinating on the evolution of digital art. Early, very early generative art maker. And it was quite interesting too, this idea that, you know, when you're coding, you're plotting art. Like I asked, you know, Dr.
00:12:07.545 - 00:12:33.979, Speaker A: Bill, did you make a sketch first? And then you try and make that. Re. Emulate that with your plotter, with basically code. And you really do see how generative art kind of had to be an early version of art, because that was almost the way to do it was to kind of program the art. You had to program the computer. We didn't have the, you know, what became a Mac user interface and a mouse. Right.
00:12:33.979 - 00:12:49.947, Speaker A: What was your drawing tool? It was code. So very interesting space with Dr. Bill Kolomechek. Here's just an example. This, I think, is a physical. And Dr. Bill just putting out a series on bitcoin.
00:12:49.947 - 00:13:12.915, Speaker A: Very excited by bitcoin. And probably, you know, a very interesting one of the takeaways, as Dr. Bill was saying. I think he said he was in his 70s, maybe 60s. 70s. He's saying, I just want to live a life of purpose at the end of the day. And so putting works on the blockchain, it's like, as he put it, it's like science fiction.
00:13:12.915 - 00:13:56.725, Speaker A: Because I asked him, what do you think of blockchain? How important is it for you to make physicals? For him? Right now, it's kind of all about digital. But what kind of strikes me, though, is how important the physical is. It's like, weirdly, after 346 shows, it's becoming increasingly clear to me how important the physicals are. And you know, what's also exciting about what I'm seeing is the amount of physicals first that I was given. And I have to show more of these in Argentina. I mean, what a generous group of people. As I said many times while I was there, the friendliest place I've ever been.
00:13:56.725 - 00:14:25.411, Speaker A: It's like. And I was thinking to myself, it's like, you know, every country kind of has its little contributions, you know, And Buenos Aires, Argentina, it kind of seemed. And maybe this is a Buenos Aires thing, I don't know, but Argentina, it seemed to be their contribution to the world's culture. Among many other things, including spectacular digital art, is friendliness. So, Interestingly, anyway, here's Dr. Bill Physical. Look at how good that looks.
00:14:25.411 - 00:14:50.339, Speaker A: And I mean, this sounds super. This might sound superficial, as, you know, I'm kind of big on the superficial things like margin and whatever, but look at this contrast that you have between the work and the Title and the signature. It kind of makes the piece this. This contrast here. Like the title and the signature here, as far as I'm concerned, are a part of the work. It helps kind of resolve the work. It's that tiny bit of contrast.
00:14:50.339 - 00:15:10.899, Speaker A: Interestingly, the importance of a good signature. It's quite interesting. Or of a defined signature. Let's call it that. Also today we have Wojak, a very interesting digital artist. Shown a few works by Wojak and so it should be interesting to talk to Wojak. Lots of experimentation.
00:15:10.899 - 00:15:39.399, Speaker A: What do we have here? Solana and Ethereum. I'm not sure if Wojak is on Tezos and all sorts of interesting things going on here. There is a recent work that I wanted to highlight. So all to say. So these are, you know, retweets here. All to say, really interesting digital artists. We're going to talk abstract digital art on today's space with Wojak and should be.
00:15:39.399 - 00:16:01.557, Speaker A: Should be awesome, actually. So great to be back here in Berlin. So thank you everybody for the support on the last show. Here's just a few comments. Jan Lucas McGon looking good in Buenos Aires. Adrian felt great, as I think I mentioned it here, a life highlight. Going to that Buenos Aires for two and a half weeks.
00:16:01.557 - 00:16:25.017, Speaker A: It's very interesting. Like when I got on the plane, I had no idea really what to expect and how this would all play out. And it definitely surpassed, you know, I'd kind of. I just didn't have any expectations. And other than it would be interesting going to South America and meeting some people from the scene. It completely blew my mind. Like it surpassed expectations.
00:16:25.017 - 00:16:36.395, Speaker A: So anyway, it's worth a visit. I'm definitely going back. Neonio Stopmo. Vamo, Adrian. Thank you. I believe that means go, Adrian, which is awesome. Nor44lab.
00:16:36.395 - 00:17:20.499, Speaker A: Another great journal. Back in May, I created an artwork for Combined 24, a generative art competition by Finnish National Gallery. The winner shortlist was announced and when I saw I didn't make the list, I thought I'd just release it to the world rather than disappearing forever. Figured that the Free Mint offering was a good way to do this. In the past, I've done other Free Mints on platforms, but have recently decided not to partake anymore and not to waste my time and focus on submissions for calls to entries. You know, I totally relate to this. Like before blockchain, before putting my work on the blockchain, it was almost what you had to do was apply to these, you know, nameless face or these faceless boards of, you know, and I hate.
00:17:20.499 - 00:17:43.935, Speaker A: Can't stand filling out forms. It's like, you know, so. So for me to fill out a form spent. And you could spend easily an entire day filling out an application to be a part of some, you know, you know, some nice show, you know, and, you know, and then you don't even hear back. Like, it's pretty lame. You might as well just put it on the blockchain. So I totally relate to what you're saying.
00:17:43.935 - 00:18:07.237, Speaker A: Most of the time, I'd start something new specifically for the competition. Focus less on helping promote platforms and more focus on my own art and development. Amen. Amen. Hold me to that. Shout at me if you see me doing otherwise awesome. Like, I am completely in the same camp here, you know, Like, I try and reduce as many points of reliance.
00:18:07.237 - 00:19:14.611, Speaker A: This is what I've learned as an artist, that the less dependent you are on basically anybody else, the better it is just for your practice. Because if you're completely dependent on your art with, you know, getting accepted to competitions and your art lives and dies, by that, I mean, why are you an artist? Right? I mean, ultimately, what is an artist? We're kind of back to this conversation very short, very briefly. And part of being an artist is absolute freedom, is having absolute freedom, right? And then so if you're all of a sudden, you're almost giving away your sovereignty by, you know, going, oh, you know, at least if you're making everything depend on these competitions, you're kind of going, there is, you know, all this I've fought for all the sacrifice I've made to do my art. Usually financial, sometimes it's actually having a family often these days. It's not easy to have a family and be an artist. A lot of people do it here, but it's not easy. So all to say is, it's a sad thing if, you know, you fight everything to finally get some sovereignty over your time, to do what you want to do with it.
00:19:14.611 - 00:19:38.281, Speaker A: That's part of being an artist, what an artist is. And you do that, and then you're kind of okay, you know, put everything on the competition. So I'm totally with you. And right now I keep saying this. I'm all about, like, putting work on Bitcoin. Ethereum is super cheap, in a sense. There's no point, I would argue right now to use an Ethereum layer 2, unless you're just trying to sell work, let's say, on base.
00:19:38.281 - 00:19:59.783, Speaker A: And base is a hot blockchain right now. And you think you'll get more sales Other than that, you might as well put it on Ethereum because it's super cheap right now. I think we're underneath. We're under one Guai is last I checked, crypto. Thank you for the comment. Nor44lab Cape Town crypto King, I believe out of Saskatchewan. Look at this.
00:19:59.783 - 00:20:25.215, Speaker A: Loving a whole bunch of highlights here. So awesome. Really glad you're enjoying the show. I'm impressed as well at all the works I'm seeing here. JP Belois hi Adrian Malba. Yes, hilarious. Malba is Museo de Arte Latino Americano de Buenos Aires and I have remembered this as I tell people where I was since I've got a couple of comments on that.
00:20:25.215 - 00:20:43.255, Speaker A: Thank you jp. Hola Juan Pez thank you for the comment and ktorn. This is one of my favorite by editions. I may be biased but it looks like they are weaving a web which in of Ed's work. This is one of my favorites by Ed that we started with here. This one here. We're all.
00:20:43.255 - 00:21:04.919, Speaker A: I think it's we're all in this together or something like this or we make this together. I may be biased but it looks like they are weaving a web which in Ed's native tongue they call tea. Interesting. So maybe this means in maybe Portuguese tea is web. Interesting. I believe Ed out of Brazil. So anyway, great comments everyone.
00:21:04.919 - 00:21:15.503, Speaker A: Thank you and also thank you for the big support on Twitter here during election season. These are great numbers. Elita too. Great stuff. Thank you. Turo. Really nice to have you.
00:21:15.503 - 00:21:40.733, Speaker A: Really nice to meet you. Have you met you and in real life friend. Yeah. Moda Mt or Turo here. Very nice individual. We had him on the Neuro special that we did there and that's on Neuro's YouTube channel. So the Neuro Collective who invited me over as well as the Elif conference who invited me over to Buenos Aires.
00:21:40.733 - 00:21:52.781, Speaker A: Tornado Rodriguez. Thanks Poco for showing my Ace Sprite paint. 98 pixels. Absolute pleasure. Tornado and beautiful work. Kel's also good. Loving the Zora Rodeo marketplace takes.
00:21:52.781 - 00:22:11.673, Speaker A: Yeah so there's actually another update on that we'll discuss in a few tabs here. And what else? And Valley Pocan. You pronounced my name well in one try. Okay, hopefully I did it again. Ksworx Good to hear from you Kwerks. I missed this. That piece.
00:22:11.673 - 00:22:21.129, Speaker A: Me too. Dropkick Pop. Loving this episode. So thank you for all the good vibes. John Bazold. Excellent episode and very nice take on rodeo. Why would I want my.
00:22:21.129 - 00:22:54.805, Speaker A: Why would I want to stuff an ETH wallet with handful of L2 mints that are a dime or so a dozen. I mean, again, there's not much point in using an L2 right now, I would argue. I mean, why not mint on foundation on Ethereum if you're gonna. It probably doesn't cost you that much right now. Zora in its prior form was sometimes tempting to use for L2 mints on ETH before base somewhere around last summer. And for sure the best work on the prior iteration of Zora was Dan Controls Fight or flight from August 23rd. Also wasn't 01 the main place for free mints.
00:22:54.805 - 00:23:19.397, Speaker A: At least it stayed on Avalanche and hidden and hidden away, so to so to speak. Or so to stay tzos and physicals forever. Safe travels back to Berlin. Thank you, John. And yes, I relate to a lot of what you're saying here and I'm kind of again, back to like if we just look here. What is it? Eth gas tracker, Ether? Yeah, we're at one guai. It is very cheap.
00:23:19.397 - 00:23:47.475, Speaker A: I mean, look here to do a swap on Uniswap is about a dollar. To buy an NFT is $1.67. You know, so probably to mint an N, I'm guessing like two or three bucks max. So a great time to put work on Ethereum and also Bitcoin. And let me just show you the MEM pool. Let's see what's going on with the MEM pool. As you see here, we're at three.
00:23:47.475 - 00:24:19.191, Speaker A: Like, look at how cheap. Like it's getting very cheap. So why spend your time with an L2 right now is kind of what I'm thinking as an artist when you can mint on, you know, layer one blockchains and especially with Bitcoin where the whole image goes on there, it'll be more expensive than Ethereum, but nevertheless. So let's continue. Did we get all the comments here? Also, Ilya Barabin, awesome to hear from you. Bosque Grazias, who I'm going to meet tomorrow for lunch. Incredible.
00:24:19.191 - 00:24:32.357, Speaker A: We're living at exactly the same sensation, but in the opposite direction. Cheers for all and thanks to Web3 and here. Awesome to hear from you. Pep. Pepita Ritu. Hola, Juan Pez. The portrait you drew.
00:24:32.357 - 00:24:49.133, Speaker A: Yes, the awesome portrait there. Yes, I think it was. I think I am remembering the one just waking up here. Everybody. Let's continue. Also in the community, we just hit 500 members actually. So thank you everybody.
00:24:49.133 - 00:25:18.549, Speaker A: This is wonderful. This is great. Very excited by this. Louis JPD with a couple of works I'VE been experimenting in blender with importing 2d artworks into 3d space, adding characters and animated elements, then re exporting as 2d elements as 2d animation. Very interesting. So this is the result, I think therefore I mint. Very interesting process there from Louie jpd Kurt Hustle Collective.
00:25:18.549 - 00:25:31.465, Speaker A: We're going to look at this work later in the show. Always awesome to hear from KHC plague. Look at this. Progressed by nature. 2024. Wild work. Kind of reminds me of Eaves Tangi actually.
00:25:31.465 - 00:25:47.001, Speaker A: If you know Eaves Tangi. Very important surrealist. Let me just bring him up here. Yeah. Kind of reminiscent here of Eaves Tangi. The horizonless landscapes of Eaves Tangi. Right.
00:25:47.001 - 00:26:07.145, Speaker A: There's no horizon line. One of the keys to understanding Yves Tangy, the great French surrealist, I believe out of Brittany. So just very cool. Yeah, cool looking dude, actually. Yves Tangy. So again, the later work is actually quite spectacular. This is a later piece.
00:26:07.145 - 00:26:21.565, Speaker A: Just awesome. Maybe I can just make this bigger and. Yeah, that's in the New York Times. Interesting. So anyway, let's see if we can open that. Yeah, the late Yves Tengu. Just rad.
00:26:21.565 - 00:26:32.953, Speaker A: So you see kind of similar there or in the same spirit. Progressed by nature. So it definitely has my attention. Very cool. Plague. Thank you for posting. Thank you for posting.
00:26:32.953 - 00:26:44.579, Speaker A: Very cool. Kind of looks like an ascetic here in kind of yoga pose. Very interesting piece. Ariel. We have a work by Ariel. Another work by Ariel later in the show. Here's another one.
00:26:44.579 - 00:27:09.235, Speaker A: Kind of abstract pixel artists skull takes. And posting a link from a post from one of one who interviewed Kudu Cola, edgy artist on Tazos. Kudu cola means coke can in Turkish. So I've been drinking one can of cola a day since birth. My. That's. That's pretty.
00:27:09.235 - 00:27:22.143, Speaker A: Does it talk about. But I don't look that cheerful because it damages my teeth. Yeah, you may want to stop that habit actually. But fascinating. Good story. But you might want to stop that habit. You know how much.
00:27:22.143 - 00:27:50.694, Speaker A: It's insane. How much. Like we should look this up sometime. Shall we do it right now? How many grams of sugar in a can of Coke? I mean this can't even be right. That can't be right. How do you fit 39 grams of sugar? A 20 ounces bottle of Mountain Dew contains 77 gram of sugar. That can't even be right.
00:27:50.694 - 00:28:10.345, Speaker A: 35 grams per three. So this is insane. Okay, so it's more the diabetes that you got to worry about there. That's insane. I would have thought like 6 or 10 and I thought that was extreme. 35 grams of sugar. Anyways, let's continue.
00:28:10.345 - 00:28:25.175, Speaker A: Macro Metry. A very. Another interesting digital piece here from Macro Metry. Doing just kind of interesting digital shapes here. So very interesting work. I guess we'd call that an abstract. Maybe it's an asteroid.
00:28:25.175 - 00:28:42.475, Speaker A: Taron. Interesting enigmatic title. Katarina. Happy Monday Artist Journal fam. My new artwork, Tiny Friends. So another cool artwork here. Almost with a game board vibe or just a cool kind of has a Monopoly board vibe, but also could be like Renaissance or even medieval style.
00:28:42.475 - 00:28:58.045, Speaker A: Framing device here and there. A girl in the fields picking mushrooms. How fun is that? Static drama. Some physicals to break the routine. I'm getting excited by all the physicals I'm seeing. By the way, this is pretty cool. And so some sculpture.
00:28:58.045 - 00:29:12.069, Speaker A: Texadelic with some work. Very interesting textures here. Red collage. Jung Money mixed media piece I made a few years ago. Some more physicals. Nice frame and so very interesting. Kind of looks like a collage.
00:29:12.069 - 00:29:24.031, Speaker A: Mixed media. Kels with the opener to Kelz's show and actually I brought that up. We'll see it in a second here. Kurt Hustle Collective. Another great work here. Give your passion now. Another great ad.
00:29:24.031 - 00:29:43.113, Speaker A: Tim Rinaldi. This is a one of one and so this is on Tazo. So cool abstract here. Just moving through it quickly. And Psycho Futurist. We're going to look at this work later in the show. Kurt Hussle Collective with what looks like maybe a remix of the Bird and more in Katarina Create and more.
00:29:43.113 - 00:29:57.185, Speaker A: So Martin Jo Cool work by Martin Joe. Shout out to Martin Joe. Thank you for the shirt. I have a Martin Jo shirt. Skull takes so vending NFTs. So we'll look at this in a second. Elizura and more.
00:29:57.185 - 00:30:16.645, Speaker A: And I think we saw this last episode. So thank you everybody. Simulacro macro metry luke500 so thank you everybody for posting. Just awesome. And here's the opener to Kelz's show. So this is now available on Tezos. Cool opener.
00:30:16.645 - 00:30:45.135, Speaker A: Continuing on Opener by Kels. That's for Tezos. So into contemporary art land. Katrina Kazakaya Kazakina Katya Kazakina with the Art Detective. And this is quite interesting. So again, just kind of taking the temperature of the contemporary art scene. I think we can kind of learn a little bit from this article.
00:30:45.135 - 00:31:11.009, Speaker A: Dealer Stefania Bordeaux Lammy on how interdependence has shaped the contemporary art scene. And here's the quote I want to highlight. Quote. It's a tough moment in which we have to buckle up and take some strategic decisions. So more evidence of a tough time in the gallery scene. And here is more. It's a good time to generate additional cash considering the downturn in the art market.
00:31:11.009 - 00:31:40.681, Speaker A: What's it like for you? And here is Stefania Bortolami. It's a tough moment in which we have to buckle up and take some strategic decisions. Trust me. All the galleries were thinking, how do we go through this? Maybe to share booths at art fairs, sit down with artists, and maybe Instead of having 14 paintings in a show, let's just have seven great paintings. Let's keep doing what we're doing, but be more focused. And this is really something I've been saying for a while here. There's a lot of supply of art, for sure.
00:31:40.681 - 00:32:17.915, Speaker A: And yes, maybe contemporary art is a little bit too expensive. And particularly relative to what we're seeing with, say, Yuri J. At the beginning of the show there. $6. How much are you paying for your average contemporary art piece when you can get that chair edition of 20 and that's it for six bucks? I mean, you can't beat the value on Tezos, it has the energy. Or even on the blockchain, but particularly on Tezos, it has the energy of the art coin with it. And it's just selling for pennies, you know, so.
00:32:17.915 - 00:32:37.020, Speaker A: And here we go again. Many collectors complain about how high prices have gotten. Why is art so expensive? It's a great question, considering the supply. This too expensive argument. I don't get it. Let's take three artists who are the same age, and they each did two museum shows recently. Their prices can literally range from $50,000 up to $1.5
00:32:37.020 - 00:33:03.001, Speaker A: million. Is it as nice as the URI J? That is my question of the easy chair. They have very similar cv, except the difference which gallery they show at. And yet they have the same chance to still be relevant in 50 years. Which one is too expensive? So not buying the too expensive argument. I would argue contemporary art is way too expensive. At least, you know, put it this way, it's interesting.
00:33:03.001 - 00:33:26.821, Speaker A: You know, again, Tezos art I can afford to buy here and there. I. I would never even bother. Like, think of all the people who are not bothering to buy art because it's too expensive. Look at BYD if you're following, you know, build your dreams. The car maker out of China that's taking over. They put out a $9,000 car, and now they're like the seventh biggest auto manufacturer.
00:33:26.821 - 00:34:13.875, Speaker A: They just passed Honda and Nissan Last quarter. Okay, so price, you know, it does matter. Drew lecreme Gifts are where it's at. This is super interesting is it is the possibility of movement which brings this new narrative to traditionally still images. There's a lot to be said for this and the preeminence of the screen, right? Because this movement kind of requires a screen rather than physical video clips. Do not play as tid, as tidily or as nicely as the GIF. If only Twitter would display large GIFs, I would share this awesome GIF art from ADHD, AD and Mikey Wilson.
00:34:13.875 - 00:34:57.455, Speaker A: So, but I think the moral of the story here, there is something to be said for this. And when I came to this scene originally, I was kind of, you know, I preferred static art, coming out of the sort of contemporary art scene, so to speak, and always liking just the. And there is something to be said for the still image. Look at that. Yuri J. Again. But as far as new technology and new mediums, there is a lot to be said for gifts and this introduction of movement which requires a screen as a first kind of principle, not as a secondary thing which requires the screen to transmit, shall we say.
00:34:57.455 - 00:35:16.971, Speaker A: Interesting comment. Juan Pez, who made the drawing. Sometimes I wish I had the place and time to be able to paint my art. The lack of this leads me to paint in digital, but in the end, it is still my art. You know, I think a lot of people relate to this and it's. It's not just the money. It is much more expensive.
00:35:16.971 - 00:35:36.471, Speaker A: It's quite expensive to make physical art, but it doesn't need to be. But generally, if you're making paintings, you need all the colors. And if you get cheap colors, they break down. So you actually need expensive colors. Then you need all your mediums, then you need your canvas. Then you need to put the, you know, build your stretcher. Unless you're going to pay for someone to do that.
00:35:36.471 - 00:36:08.725, Speaker A: You need the gesso, right? It is a luxury to be able to make physical art. And then you need what. Think how much time that takes. So there's a lot to be said for this and I think a lot of people are here. The convenience of digital is quite powerful, shall we say? So just I think a lot of people are in this kind of mentality here. It's like, I'd love to do it, but it's hard to justify when especially. And I can sell it a lot easier online.
00:36:08.725 - 00:36:44.361, Speaker A: So, you know, I make a physical okay, I guess, and then I have to ship it. Right? We've gone through all this before Walk too many in real life artists I would like to collect, reject or not even and or are not even remotely aware of the dynamics of web3. Weirdly, you know, to a certain degree I'm still shocked at how small this scene is. Remember we're looking at the first year EJ and it's like, oh, who bought it? The last one. It's like so many of these names are familiar here. It feels like a few hundred people. In reality it's probably about 3 or 4,000, 5,000.
00:36:44.361 - 00:37:16.795, Speaker A: In a world of 8 billion, is it 7, 8 billion. So it's tiny, you know. And I came to realize that too going to Argentina and you see, you put the face to the names and all of a sudden you realize it's just like, you know, it's smaller than. It's surprisingly small. Which if you're looking at this show and you're not involved, there's still, it's still a lot of green pastures here. There's a lot to explore and it's still early. Shockingly, I would argue.
00:37:16.795 - 00:37:55.923, Speaker A: So that's interesting comment from Walk Sanso Eth. No shade to all of the NFT art funds out there. But why would. But why would investors pay someone to buy NFT art if they're buying the same things? Couldn't folks just buy these things themselves? Or is it just that they don't have the capital to buy a full punk beeple or X copy? And I thought this was interesting. There is a sense online and what I call in the mainstream NFT scene which is, you know, these are your kind of people. X copy and folk and. Or a crypto punk are like so it's.
00:37:55.923 - 00:38:40.459, Speaker A: I think so and so brings up a good point. It's like if it's super obvious to bought what to buy, why are you giving your money to a fund to buy the same thing and everybody. So there's a bit of a herd mentality and that exists I guess everywhere. But again, I would say that is part of the opportunity really of tezos and object and but you know, as well as other blockchains but of collecting different kinds of artists here. I just think this is an opportunity and I think it's kind of sad to a certain degree and I think it's great for these artists here. But I mean human nature, it does go according to the herd. And then it's.
00:38:40.459 - 00:39:23.165, Speaker A: And put it this way, I mean this is actually why I wanted to highlight this. I mean, are you going to take your art advice from crypto you know, self proclaimed degens. Like, I mean, because that is kind of what's going on to a certain degree. Not entirely, but I mean if are you going to like if someone's just going to buy the most obvious thing that are going well with self proclaimed degens. Is this, is this what you want to buy? Is this who you're taking your art consultation from? You know, the mainstream NFT scene on Twitter, you know, so. And nothing against these artists at all. Or the crypto punks or.
00:39:23.165 - 00:39:33.629, Speaker A: Crypto punks are amazing. Right. As well as a lot of X copy working people there. So. But all to say, I mean there's so much more art out there. Yeah. So.
00:39:33.629 - 00:40:02.141, Speaker A: But that's an opportunity. Ed Marola. I mean if everybody was crazy for, you know, Uri J, you wouldn't get one for under a hundred bucks. You can still get one for six, you know, so. Ed Marola, I know it's crazy, but four people hold currently more than a hundred artworks I have made these last years. I mean, how many of your friends in the contemporary art scene can say that, you know that that collector owns a hundred physicals. This is only possible because it's all digital and you just hold it in your wallet.
00:40:02.141 - 00:40:20.537, Speaker A: You guys make the art alive. Thank you. Everything. Soft eyelay, Frostbitten. Special mention to just us Mining for 95 artworks. I'll never forget Hasdrubal Waffle who unfortunately deleted the cedar plank account. Again, where I want to highlight like 4 or 5 of waffles works.
00:40:20.537 - 00:41:01.141, Speaker A: But in the interview that we did in the space that we did over a year ago, year and a half ago with Waffles, he had a great statement where he's like, I think there's going to be a huge reward for collectors at some point here. This could turn out to be a massive reward for collectors. Let's continue here. Zora. So this was interesting. So of course Zora, as we discussed last episode, as most of you know, changed their free mint from $2 to 70 to maybe 34 cents and you get 17 cents, you know, anecdotally. So here it says we've made a small update of how mint works.
00:41:01.141 - 00:41:29.147, Speaker A: There was kind of an automatic 24 hour countdown. So I think you lost in the new update, you lost pricing power and also the amount of time, amazingly the amount of time I think the 24 hour countdown won't start. So I. But I haven't used the new version. So this. I'm just going on what I've heard and what it looks like here. The 24 hour countdown won't start until there has been 200 mints.
00:41:29.147 - 00:42:00.343, Speaker A: Post as much and as often as you'd like at once without needing to stress that you're going to make the 200 mints. Because maybe you post and you get 10 mints and then the 24 hours counts down and you end up with $1.70. But these are huge additions, so it kind of brings up the collectability issue, right. If all mints are going to have minimum 200. So to me, this is a sign of stress. In Zora's system, collectors can now discover hidden gems at any time and help them get minted by others before time runs out. I mean, it's quite interesting.
00:42:00.343 - 00:42:22.305, Speaker A: I mean, from my understanding, ZORA was saying we don't. We're not just an art platform, art marketplace. We want to be a social media network. But you go to Zora's page and you still see nothing but art, as far as I recall. Let's look. I mean, so here's the feed. Well, maybe this isn't art, this is a screenshot.
00:42:22.305 - 00:43:03.827, Speaker A: But you see, I mean, it's still art centric, right? So in a sense it's basically the same people who were using it before, maybe a few less. I mean, it's basically the same feed. I mean, a social media network for artists is what they had and are and kind of still have, even if they're trying to go to social media. But I don't see anybody posting their trap. You know, maybe there is a travel picture here, but this looks like more like an art photograph. Right? So I would argue, you know, it's interesting seeing that, oh, we're changing the mint thing. I don't know how well this is working for Zora is my.
00:43:03.827 - 00:43:52.001, Speaker A: What I'm trying to say here. And here's Rodeo. I looked at this page, this is their homepage and they've changed the page just since like, I want to say from like three or four days ago when it was all about social network and you know, now it's for the experimental. The narratives are getting changed. Like this narrative here at Rodeo is now getting changed and saying they realize the people who are posting on our network, which you can't see here without logging in. And I haven't connected my wallet to this yet, so I can't see. But it's like it's pretty obvious that the only, the people, it seems to me from the change in the narrative here on the homepage that they're going, look, the people who are Posting here, it's more works in progress, so we might as well kind of rebrand towards that.
00:43:52.001 - 00:44:34.865, Speaker A: And it's kind of back again to, you know, our main customers are artists. So if the artists aren't happy with the lower mints or without making money, I mean, and so I don't even like some people, you know, maybe some people might think, oh, there should be pressure put on these. I say the market will work it out. If it's not working for artists, artists won't post there and we'll see what's left. And if it does work for artists, then it'll work for artists and they'll keep posting there. So it's just kind of interesting, though, to watch the narrative change from social media, at least on Rodeo, to for the experimental, you know, something more arty. So interesting.
00:44:34.865 - 00:45:04.375, Speaker A: So Pronoia did a world exclusive here. In an unprecedented move, Santiago agreed to make an exclusive interview about NFT Uruguay and what it's all about. So here. So don't miss this here is all about NFT Uruguay. Where a place I still need to visit. So the meme continues here. And there's el Presidente of NFT Uruguay, Santiago, who had the pleasure of meeting a few times in Argentina.
00:45:04.375 - 00:45:31.625, Speaker A: What a delight that was. And I need to show the picture of the myth here that we all took together. Myth hiding his face, importantly. Yeah, so I need to show that picture. I think I posted online here, but I need to show it on this show. For the record, Santiago also did a vending NFTs. So the vending machine, the NFT, the Tez vending machine.
00:45:31.625 - 00:45:50.379, Speaker A: So very cool. This is finished, I believe, because I went to the homepage and this was gone. But there you had Santiago hosting. And of course I follow Santiago. That's a glitch on X when you open up a ton of tabs. Here's okay. So then there was this thing, RGB Montreal, already at 45 minutes.
00:45:50.379 - 00:46:11.459, Speaker A: My God. So happy to see my work. So this is Gozo. We've looked at Gozo's work before. And again, I call it the alchemy of scale. The alchemy of scale. When you take a digital artwork, especially with a projector, you can make these things huge and they become spectacular.
00:46:11.459 - 00:46:36.363, Speaker A: It takes an interesting, good artwork and it makes it spectacular visually. So it looks like they made a pretty nice display here@ RGBmtl. Here's Kristen Roos. I think I saw a lot of people posting that Sabato took a lot of these videos. So here's Kristen Roos. And this must look spectacular in person. So they did a really nice job.
00:46:36.363 - 00:46:55.535, Speaker A: Almost floor to ceiling here. Here's another one. A Reny fish. So I just kind of randomly took a few that crossed my feed here. There were lots more, but yeah, look at how amazing. Like you can just imagine how good this looks in person. Huge.
00:46:55.535 - 00:47:06.241, Speaker A: And here. Klaus. Thanks. Phosphor operator. So look at this. I mean, you can imagine again just how good these things look. So very cool.
00:47:06.241 - 00:47:29.891, Speaker A: Here's Jan Lucas Magone. I thought an interesting kind of art ad, so to speak, where it's kind of like a futuristic advertising form of advertising. I mean, look here. So showing the work in progress, you know, kind of getting into it. It's like, wow. You see the artistry at work here. And available now only on Tezos new piece.
00:47:29.891 - 00:47:47.423, Speaker A: Awesome link below. So very cool and great to see Jan's process here. Big supporter of this show. Big fan of Jan's art. Here's Spiegel's Maskinen. Look at this. I mean, frankly, this could have started the show also.
00:47:47.423 - 00:48:09.785, Speaker A: I mean. And we'll put on the audio in a second here. But look at this installation. This is ambitious, you know. So very impressive here. Just very impressive. What's going on here? I'm gonna scroll through it a little bit and interesting audio.
00:48:09.785 - 00:48:22.565, Speaker A: Kind of like opera there. Let's continue. Polygon 1993. I hope you're ready for this. So check this out. So trading cards. Huge fan of trading cards.
00:48:22.565 - 00:48:36.485, Speaker A: And look at this. The freaking textures. Look at this. So another beautiful rendering of digital art in physical form. Beautiful. Very impressive. Such an interesting artist.
00:48:36.485 - 00:48:55.765, Speaker A: Polygon 1993. Here is Inavare visiting Eitzel Labs gear. So I believe probably visiting Montreal here. And so it continues. Those look like VHS cassettes here. And old monitors, old TVs. Rad looking studios that these analog glitch artists, Analog video glitch artists have.
00:48:55.765 - 00:49:07.737, Speaker A: Very cool. And check this out. This also could have started the show. Let's see how close we can look at this. This is Lily Illo. A brilliant solution here. Printing on wood.
00:49:07.737 - 00:49:37.789, Speaker A: AI artwork printed on wood. Kind of solving the texture issue a little bit too, doesn't it? In a weird way, I wonder if this works better than Artlab or. Sorry, Art Matter. Art Matter Art Lab is a location in Buenos Aires. Art Matter. Remember the painting that was done where they put the texture first and then inkjet over top? This one feels more natural. I would argue it was interesting and I'd love to try out the Art Matter stuff.
00:49:37.789 - 00:49:59.107, Speaker A: Very Interesting work they're doing. But there's something to be said for the elegance of this solution. It's not a forced solution here. It's just taking a textured piece of wood and printing on it. And it kind of solves the texture issue. Very interesting. And so let me just bring up the other work here.
00:49:59.107 - 00:50:13.235, Speaker A: And there it is. Another close up. So Lily Illo print on wood. Super cool. Luciana Guerra. I love drawings and monotypes and Luciana Guerra. Maybe I can just quickly, you know, over the.
00:50:13.235 - 00:50:36.269, Speaker A: Hopefully my iPad doesn't fall there. I have to show this. I mean, this is spectacular. Look at this work that Luciana Guerra. You know, it goes horizontal, but just. Just to fit it in the frame. I mean, that gifted me a spectacular physical here.
00:50:36.269 - 00:50:52.229, Speaker A: Spectacular. So the generosity. The generosity. I have some Santiago's here too, that maybe I can show those now. Just need to be careful, I tell you. Airport security. I had to.
00:50:52.229 - 00:51:14.695, Speaker A: I've never been that stern with airport security. That was not being careful with the art pieces. And I had to tell them repeatedly, please be careful. Look at these Santiago works. Again, these probably go horizontally. So I need to actually own a piece of property at some point, so I can put these in frames. The great Santiago here.
00:51:14.695 - 00:51:40.915, Speaker A: Just spectacular. You could put these all along, like a hallway in your apartment. I mean, the generosity. The friendliness of Argentina is. I'll never forget. And actually, while we're here, finally, and the show, unfortunately, is gonna go long here, but all worth it. Oh, yeah.
00:51:40.915 - 00:51:55.475, Speaker A: This was awesome. Neho. That was awesome. So that was done on the Neutro Collective night that we did. That was spectacular. Look at that portrait. Just a spectacular portrait.
00:51:55.475 - 00:52:10.923, Speaker A: I want to put all these in frames. I need a regular apartment, if anybody knows, a Berlin apartment. Still on the search here. I love drawing in monotypes. So here is Luciana Guerra, whose work we're just looking at. Awesome. Just awesome.
00:52:10.923 - 00:52:25.393, Speaker A: Nice series. Love the large amounts here. I. You know, a 4 is a very tricky size I find, and I love. And that's why I love it. I don't generally use it. It's almost like any other paper size but A4.
00:52:25.393 - 00:52:45.189, Speaker A: And so I love it when I see A4. So it looks like this is A4 that Luciana is using. Luciana Guerra. And it was awesome to meet her too, actually, last week. So again, just totally awesome. And yeah, very cool. You know, Gerhard Richter.
00:52:45.189 - 00:53:06.813, Speaker A: Once I saw Gerhard Richter, a whole bunch of A4s also, and I was like, of course, A4 die with the most likes in the Studio. The humble studio of Die with the Most Likes. It's kind of perfect, isn't it? Such a prolific artist. I love this guy. Many people, as many of us do. And of course I follow the great Die with the Most Likes. That is a Twitter glitch.
00:53:06.813 - 00:53:26.385, Speaker A: And more interesting physicals here. Look at this element, Lee. I don't know if this is printed, but using kind of, you know, torn paper here or, you know, maybe some kind of paper and putting. I don't. I assume that's inkjet printed on kraft paper. There we go. Thank you, Cave.
00:53:26.385 - 00:53:48.531, Speaker A: So continuing, again, these physicals are getting incredibly interesting. And here's E Boy Arts. And actually I need to remember to bring this up next episode. Working with Louis Vuitton. Kiro sent me the link here. One of the original, if not the original kind of pixel artist who really kind of took it to the next level. From what I understand.
00:53:48.531 - 00:54:04.295, Speaker A: A pioneer. Let's call it that. Pixel art pioneer, E Boy Arts. So very cool. Miami Pixarama signed art print. Okay, look at that. So how cool is that? So I assume that's on the back.
00:54:04.295 - 00:54:47.763, Speaker A: See, but you know, if I was like art director here, I'd be like, you know what, what if we put a margin here and remember that contrast we were getting with Dr. Bill's work where you saw the signature underneath? I mean, how great would it look with the signature right there and like edition number or date or whatever over there. So anyway, let's get into the work here. Sleeping Demon, a gorgeous work here by Ed Morola. As you see what looks like a sampled brush around all these different techniques, right? There's a devil. There's a couple of people in what looks like a cave looking on and almost oil painter like textures here and there. And what an interesting scene.
00:54:47.763 - 00:55:13.531, Speaker A: A sleeping devil. You see all of the different techniques that Ed uses here, the rep, the sampled brushes, the textures, even a little bit of glitch, the movement in certain areas. Just beautiful. Very, just interesting and Fun. Edition of 21 sold out at $5.46 per edition. You really can't beat that.
00:55:13.531 - 00:55:34.059, Speaker A: When you see, you know, 50,000 to a 1.5 million dollar range for contemporary art in New York, you can't beat $5.46 made in yellow. Dress number two edition of 11 now on secondary for six. Oh no, that's primary for $16. So let's take a look here. And actually a fairly large work.
00:55:34.059 - 00:55:57.123, Speaker A: Beautifully painted, isn't it? I mean, you see the textures here and everything. I mean it feels like A modern day Manet here. And look at the texture again. It's almost like cracked oil here. I'm not sure if you can see that, but it's almost like cracked oil here. These textures that we're getting. Just totally awesome here.
00:55:57.123 - 00:56:34.625, Speaker A: Reminiscence of a meme. Just experimenting here. So relentless experimentation going on out here too. Very cool. And again, fertile ground. I mean there's so many things, as I say with digital, we are simply just scratching the surface. Particularly I'd argue that's a feature of the second generation of digital art where all of a sudden we have this huge amount of softwares.
00:56:34.625 - 00:56:55.397, Speaker A: And here like this looks like probably six different softwares are being used here. Procreate some sort of 3D animation, whatever makes the texture maybe putting into something else. I, you know, it's almost endless here. The myth. This is only 0.1 eth. On super rare Basquiat.
00:56:55.397 - 00:57:09.465, Speaker A: And this looks like Prince. This looks like super classic myth. That kind of looks like Warhol wearing a wig. And just classic myth. A little homunculi. And there's the myth figure just down there. Very small.
00:57:09.465 - 00:57:30.567, Speaker A: See if we can get a larger version of this. So interesting red there. There's the myth down there. And a quite a large procreate looking work. But beautiful, beautiful work. Again, a huge pleasure to meet the myth. I mean, look at that red in Buenos Aires.
00:57:30.567 - 00:57:41.705, Speaker A: In a cafe in Buenos Aires with Santiago translating. That was awesome. And hanging out. Yellow spell. So another one here on super rare. This is 0.2 eth.
00:57:41.705 - 00:57:56.425, Speaker A: Let's make this a little bigger. And there it is. There is the myth. A sword, a mask. The myth on a book. So the mystery of the myth continues. Just beautiful.
00:57:56.425 - 00:58:08.965, Speaker A: That's on super rare as well. Zozo also at Argentina didn't meet Zozo. Maybe that's on the next trip, which I'd love to do next year. Maybe next April. March. April. Let's see.
00:58:08.965 - 00:58:35.525, Speaker A: Let's play this. Beautiful music. Beautiful loop. So that is country dream edition of one. 50 tazos. Here's another one. This is an edition of one probably sold to OG Wrecking Ball for 50 tazos.
00:58:35.525 - 00:58:54.657, Speaker A: Only $33 now. 500. Great music. Cool subject. Wild and free. Continuing on after the audio difficulties, my mic cut out. Let's continue.
00:58:54.657 - 00:59:26.405, Speaker A: Big business monkey, let us go. Hopefully it doesn't cut out again. I kept talking for 10 minutes after and until I realized thankfully I didn't go to the end of the show. Zozo collected another cool work. Basically a cat on a laptop. There and again, you could say would show really well with NUV 1914. Who we're gonna look at here in a second.
00:59:26.405 - 00:59:42.039, Speaker A: Mujer Tokanda La guitara. As we run through this episode, look at the great colors here. Feels like there's something a little different in this one. I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's just big gradients, the big shapes. Maybe. Definitely has.
00:59:42.039 - 01:00:01.825, Speaker A: Like, I was at the Malba and there was a lot of Latin American art here. This has a Latin American feel to it, I have to say, in. Maybe it's the colors, maybe it's the subject matter. Very nice. De Henri Matisse. Eco pour me. So maybe based on Ari Matisse.
01:00:01.825 - 01:01:00.801, Speaker A: Interestingly beautiful. I mean, it. Like when you. If you're an art historian 200 years from now and you're looking at this work and you're saying, does this work matter? The first question, actually you start to argue or ask is, is it connected to the tradition? Does it connect itself with the tradition, with the world art tradition? If it does, that's a point in its favor, that it's significant and matters to that, at least to that tradition, because it is a part of the conversation. And then it becomes this conversation over the centuries and millennia is what's going on here. So. So quoting or doing homages or referencing the tradition really helps your work and the scene's work to a certain degree.
01:01:00.801 - 01:01:24.403, Speaker A: It builds credibility, I would argue. Let's continue here. Ositos constrictores. So it looks like a construction site this time by NUF 1914. Another very interesting kind of esoteric subject here. And again, wild experimentation as we see in the clouds, this beautiful. Is that the sun? Everything so.
01:01:24.403 - 01:01:41.867, Speaker A: And classic iconography too. The bears, the flowers and everything instantly recognizable. It's November 1914, also selling 15 tazos. Let's continue. This one was burned, edition of zero. But I think. I'm not sure if it was re minted or not.
01:01:41.867 - 01:02:00.625, Speaker A: The frame on the left, one of these beautiful diptychs. Interesting abstract here. So soles. And one more here, a diptych, but a vertical diptych. And again, the frame on. I guess there's frames on both different frames. Temprano.
01:02:00.625 - 01:02:26.623, Speaker A: So again, maybe deciding in a very experimental way that maybe one of these. Actually, I do think this would work on its own, but maybe going, hey, maybe this works better as a juxtaposition. And look at the outrageousness of this little line here. That goes past all of the wild experimentation here. You have to love it. Here's ayako Usagi, this is on Instagram. I think it's a physical.
01:02:26.623 - 01:02:45.485, Speaker A: I was looking at this plan. Looks like part of a solo exhibition. It looks like it was digitally made, but that's being rendered physically. I don't know. Interesting work though. Ayako Usagi on Instagram. Louis Osborne, continuing this ID series.
01:02:45.485 - 01:03:04.585, Speaker A: Here is one called Wasted. So here is the ID of the person, the appearance and here is the reality of this person. Cool juxtaposition. Also here by Louis Osborne. And here is stoned. And here is the appearance and here is the reality. And the red eyes there.
01:03:04.585 - 01:03:20.055, Speaker A: So beautiful work selling for 10 tezos each. Pretty reasonable. And here is Tim Lahan into the Void again for Zeit. So we're just looking at Zeit. So kind of a German version of Time, I think. Essays and whatnot. Pretty nice piece.
01:03:20.055 - 01:04:11.005, Speaker A: You know where it's very interesting where illustration and fine art collide and meet like I feel like in digital the distinction between a fine art piece like an oil painting and illustration for a newspaper. I feel like that distinction starts to break down because they're all screen works because of there isn't the physical texture, that three dimensionality really distinguishing the works. So it's kind of interesting I think, because I think sometimes illustration is unfairly categorized as not fine art. And I think that's bogus, so to speak. I don't think that's a fair distinction. Just as you know. And I think the market.
01:04:11.005 - 01:04:34.755, Speaker A: Back to the market. I think the market recognizes this as now we see comic art going for huge amounts of money, whereas previously they were very, very cheap, you know, so it's interesting. Tatsbytats, this is Jake Studios. Very cool work here. Another stream of consciousness work. There's a tattoo artist with the bag on the head. We see the movement here.
01:04:34.755 - 01:04:57.117, Speaker A: Nouns, glasses being tattooed here. That looks like Jake Studios figure there and adding to the tattoo collection. And 333999 maybe 6, 6 6. Nice work here as usual. Tats by Tats edition of 1. Not listed here is Pamela Cirone Shama. So a cool illustration here.
01:04:57.117 - 01:05:33.817, Speaker A: Pamela putting out a few works and with all of the energy, I mean Pamela Cirone I met also in Buenos Aires and his personality is like his art, just kind of outpour, an outpouring of joy really and energy. And cool phone here too. So very cool work that is on object. Great to see him back. Here's Mumble Boy disassembled with another collage. Digital and physical in combination, as you can see here. Very cool process and Mumble Boy, you know, making work for quite a while, I think.
01:05:33.817 - 01:05:47.057, Speaker A: Look at this. Interesting. Always a surprise here with Mumbleboy. And this is also Pamela Cirone. Slightly out of order here. Chime. So also doing some of the pixel artwork.
01:05:47.057 - 01:06:04.835, Speaker A: So this is for Fortez20 and also some paper texture. Again, this kind of stuff. 16 by 16, four frames. You could put on bitcoin at this point and it wouldn't cost you too much. Especially if you got rid of the texture. Then it would be super small. Here's another 16 by 16.
01:06:04.835 - 01:06:37.745, Speaker A: This stuff could end up doing really well on bitcoin. Again, there's a lot of art on bitcoin, but there's not a ton of. You know what some people would call and you know what I was telling people? Oh, there's not a ton of art on bitcoin. But there is. But there's not a ton of art that I see that is like, oh, that goes in the museum in my mind, let's put it that way. And so I think there's an opportunity here for works like this on bitcoin for a lot of people on Bitcoin. Me, pixel, middle of nowhere, Earth.
01:06:37.745 - 01:06:59.497, Speaker A: Beautiful again, I think we're back to effects on effects, this time with different forms of pixelation and this great. Let me show you something here that really stands out. See the kind of the. Where the pixels, the purple and the dark pixel. Beautiful. It almost looks like they're layered on top of each other. Different renderings of this scene.
01:06:59.497 - 01:07:20.365, Speaker A: Very interesting. Here's another one, Park Trail. So very interesting way of doing pixel art here. From Emmy, from me pixel. And here is Schrodinger's unicorn. So we looked at this last time. Forgive me, I am redoing the last five minutes here.
01:07:20.365 - 01:07:45.715, Speaker A: Okay, so you saw the unicorn there. So this is the same artist, Gregory Nishumika, with more wild, experimental pixel based art, but really different renderings as you see here. And then a flag, a little bit of collage. Kind of looks like a McDonald's. Some American Eagles. It's kind of like Americana. And there's like what looks like the cybertruck.
01:07:45.715 - 01:08:04.153, Speaker A: So American Tailgate X. They see us grilling and grinding. No one is united, but we're too high on fading. So edition of one and unlisted. Interestingly, here's Element Lee playing with printer colors. Kind of looks like a printer box. CMY&K is the title.
01:08:04.153 - 01:08:40.319, Speaker A: 256 by 300 pixels. That's on Instagram. Brilliant work here by Heaty Rocket Computer Network. Gorgeous and stunning all at the same time here. And as you know, recollects Drew at the start of the show saying there's something special about GIFs. Haiti Rockette, being one of the great GIF is really of like period, period beautiful and just taking a, you know, computer rendition and then repeating it and turning it into something very fun. Computer network edition of three sold for only 13 tezos.
01:08:40.319 - 01:09:00.085, Speaker A: Here's Nicholas Dietrich. Temporal and astral observations. So again, more mystery here from Nicholas Dietrich. We see a streetlight, we see a wall, we see a ring. Almost like a video game being covered quite. Again, I always kind of reference to Kiriko, the enigmatic kind of poetry of De Chirico. Even some stars here.
01:09:00.085 - 01:09:15.685, Speaker A: And this cool gradient, this dithered gradient in the background. Black on black. Great title. Another really cool piece here from Nicholas Dietrich. Five Tazos. And here is Mark Travail. So you might remember the lamp from a couple of weeks ago.
01:09:15.685 - 01:09:36.365, Speaker A: I think that was on Tazo. Same colors here, interestingly. And this very interesting. Almost like the dust that you'd find in the spotlight, but turned into these little icons here. Very interesting. Sachu and Stalamere collaborating. So I think set shoe would be outside of the oval and that looks very Stalemier esque inside the oval.
01:09:36.365 - 01:09:56.844, Speaker A: So cool. Pixel art collaboration here again has a sci fi feeling to it. That is an open edition on Manifold. Interestingly, going for the free mint price. Interestingly I think. Wasn't it 0.007 that used to be on Zora? So interesting.
01:09:56.844 - 01:10:14.304, Speaker A: Let's continue. Mo shit with experimental pixel artwork. Can't tell if this is AI or not. I assume not wild. I mean just kind of off the wall. Addition of five for two tezos each. More bold work from Mo.
01:10:14.304 - 01:10:22.615, Speaker A: Tiny Soul. Check this out. Probably do well on Tezos. Has a nice kind of vibe to it. Almost like Tradscape a little bit. But this is somewhere else. Someone else.
01:10:22.615 - 01:10:44.235, Speaker A: Tiny Soul. Cool piece. Probably do quite well. Rocano with a one of one edition of one. Yeah, sorry, a pixel art piece or I guess just a classic Roccano work this time of a Coke machine or a soda machine. Dithered edition of one. Only $17.
01:10:44.235 - 01:11:15.743, Speaker A: So continuing on. Mech Txt into the belly of Dragon for you my love. And I'm not sure if I mentioned this in the part that was silenced over the last 10 minutes, but how great is it? I don't think I have mentioned this in what you've seen so far. How great is it that like, look at how much fun we are having. You can go online, you can sell your art. It basically costs you nothing to make. You sell it for 25 tezos.
01:11:15.743 - 01:11:35.579, Speaker A: You get $17 in your pocket. As an artist it's fun. As a collector, it's fun. You're only paying 25 tezos $17 for the art. What is not to like here? It feels very golden age esque here. Here is another example. This really cool work by Mech.
01:11:35.579 - 01:11:55.015, Speaker A: I think we saw an earlier version on Twitter but with different colors. Very beautiful. Into the belly of Dragon for you my love. Again using the tiling in Aseprite. 25 Tezos edition of 20 still available. 5 left. Brilliant work here by Elby Erase Me.
01:11:55.015 - 01:12:14.297, Speaker A: So playing with Mario Paint, recording it, hitting the erase button. And look at this. Celebrating really this software here. Just putting a bunch of LB faces or Nintendo early faces and just hitting the erase button. And that is the work. Brilliant actually. Very fun.
01:12:14.297 - 01:12:32.125, Speaker A: I picked one up two tazos. Open edition for 22 days. Here's another Super Mario work. This is perfect loop Super Mario Brothers 3 Contra Edition. 1200 by 1200. This looks like it's combining video games. Very interesting.
01:12:32.125 - 01:12:45.037, Speaker A: Very, very interesting. I don't know if I've seen that before. Interesting move. Addition of five and two transfer. Very interesting. Here's R. Presti whose work we saw in the community.
01:12:45.037 - 01:13:00.759, Speaker A: Here's another one. Astro number 756Y. So cool. Abstract pixel art here. Very interesting edition of five selling for five Tezos. Here's another work. This is by Byte by Bit.
01:13:00.759 - 01:13:20.943, Speaker A: This is an edition of 1. And this sold to Flexasaurus Rex for 15 tezos. I wonder what software byte by bit is using. Graphics 2. Animation made by 2007. Graphics 2. So maybe a newer version like a screen.
01:13:20.943 - 01:13:43.253, Speaker A: What would you call it? A simulation maybe of graphics too perhaps bite by bit. Back on the scene. Dan Kelly Draw Dog Tuesday Wild one, right? It took me a while to kind of another artist. It took me a while to kind of get. So here again, experimental pixel art. Here's the dog. But then recorded through screens, through different cameras.
01:13:43.253 - 01:13:57.177, Speaker A: Recording of the screen I believe. Kind of glitched out a little bit. Dan Kelly, super interesting artist. Here's Neuro Color. Interesting abstract here from Neuro Color. So pretty interesting. 10,000 views.
01:13:57.177 - 01:14:18.349, Speaker A: Doing very well. Has a huge audience. Doing more interesting animated abstracts here in the middle of Internet honey life. So here's Kazuhiro Ehara. Nice sale. 99 tezos to AHEK who continues to just be consistently collecting in this scene. I don't think I've ever seen Ahek take a break.
01:14:18.349 - 01:14:36.221, Speaker A: He may have taken one, but I've never seen it. I've never noticed it, let's put it that way. One of the most consistent collectors in the entire space. Look at how cool this work is. Look at how original this is. Again, kind of a digital abstract piece. Very interesting and cool.
01:14:36.221 - 01:15:03.973, Speaker A: Kazuhiro Ei and recognizable as Kazuhiro's work. How are we doing for time? We're doing good. So Renki, whose work we've looked at probably almost more than any other artist on this show. Interestingly beautiful animated abstract here. It's probably been in more shows than anybody. Hilariously, very cool artwork here by Renki. Here's Ranixtyr.
01:15:03.973 - 01:15:18.703, Speaker A: Very nice. Let's do this. Very nice minimal artwork. What did she say? Just so just posting the work. Beautiful colors here. Beautiful minimal digital artwork. Here is Psycho Futurist with a wild one.
01:15:18.703 - 01:15:36.885, Speaker A: Kind of looking like an ad from the Internet. You sold my soul twice. Call now or call later. We do not care. So again, kind of playing off of an ad structure or ad imagery. Pretty interesting. Kind of reminiscent of those Warhol plastic surgery works in subject matter.
01:15:36.885 - 01:15:53.857, Speaker A: And that is an addition of 6 and sold out at 12 tezos. So the market keeps humming along here. Elna Frederick and playing with more meme imagery. Ebaum's world. YT mine. So I'm not going to leave it on here too long. I believe that's drake edition of 10.
01:15:53.857 - 01:16:12.079, Speaker A: And that is sold out at how much? At about 10. Taking offers at 10 to 14 tezos. Here's Ernesto Ash. Recurrent. It's another animated abstract here. So pretty cool work. This is, I believe, a give a lot of detail in it.
01:16:12.079 - 01:16:28.055, Speaker A: August 27th edition of 150 Tezos. Awesome. Recurrent. Here's another animated abstract. This is Sean Luke Time Traders. So cool artwork here by Sean Luke. Kind of a wild one.
01:16:28.055 - 01:16:48.871, Speaker A: Another take on this structure. It'd be interesting to see, you know, Sean Luke do another structure I like. Might be, because I don't know if I've ever seen Sean Luke go outside of this frame structure. And it's pretty awesome in a sense to be so consistent. But now I'm kind of curious. Time Traders. Awesome title.
01:16:48.871 - 01:17:07.663, Speaker A: Beautiful, interesting animated abstract work. Selling out at 55 Tezos, edition of Seven. Nice sale. Here's LB again. Scream. Gorgeous color and kind of looks like a mouth repeated four times and glitched out with great yellow and blue color there. Edition of 11.
01:17:07.663 - 01:17:25.239, Speaker A: Three tazos two. Sold here is Kiro. And this is on Zora. I haven't seen as many works on Zora. So here's Kuro, though, with a pretty cool, what I call video painting here. Glitched out video painting. Very cool.
01:17:25.239 - 01:17:39.959, Speaker A: What is this called? Spirit me Spiderweb 5 minted so far on Zora. Here's another one on Zora. This is Lucas. Lucas Ox. Someone else I met. Part of the Neuro crew in Argentina. Cool.
01:17:39.959 - 01:17:53.315, Speaker A: Video glitch. Animated or analog Video glitch work, I think. Or maybe digital. This is on Zora. 169. Minted here. And let's continue.
01:17:53.315 - 01:18:08.255, Speaker A: Ex mortal lost again. Gorgeous, gorgeous palm trees. I don't think I've shown this one. And great waves coming in here pretty quickly. There's another one. Edition of one Aperture. This is a wild one.
01:18:08.255 - 01:18:27.743, Speaker A: Beautiful. Just glitching out here. And here's another one, Aperture 2 with almost looking out of a cave onto the sea. Beautiful work here at auction for 79 tezos. Ex mortals doing quite well on a roll here with bids coming in. And here between lines. This is Nebular.
01:18:27.743 - 01:18:48.645, Speaker A: Let's see if we can load this up. Nebular and SXZRO 4. Will it load? Let's see. Here we go. Okay, it worked. And I believe some audio on here. Computer starting to freeze.
01:18:48.645 - 01:19:13.223, Speaker A: Let's see if the computer comes back. It's back. Thank God the computer is back. Okay, so I'm gonna scroll through this kind of. So as you see here, interesting piece. So that is Nebular and SX ZRO 4 between lines. Edition of 30.
01:19:13.223 - 01:19:49.217, Speaker A: Here is Kurt Hustle Collective. Just awesome audio. The museum in my mind is going to sound wonderful. Like even just like the audio is spectacular here. It looks very cool, pretty wild and kind of unusual and weird in a good way. Live edition of 10 for 5 Tezos. But the audio, I mean, you walk into a room and you have that kind of audio playing.
01:19:49.217 - 01:20:07.395, Speaker A: Be awesome. Here's Marietta Burnell, who I met in Argentina, and as she said, you haven't shown a single work of mine. And I don't think I may have actually. But anyways, cool work. It was great to meet new people here. Fake summer. A shiny plastic state of mind.
01:20:07.395 - 01:20:25.283, Speaker A: Part of neutral art. So it was awesome meeting new people here, seeing new artists. And so a 3D designer did work actually with Valentino. So Fake summer. So cool. Kind of CGI rendering. Working a lot with blender, I think.
01:20:25.283 - 01:20:50.735, Speaker A: Toques we are condemned to be free. So as we move into the AI artworks here, as we wrap up the show, this extended show Cool work by Tuques. AI artwork. Here's another one, Psychological Drive. This is now listed at 200 tazos. So pretty interesting AI artwork here for all the skeptics out there. Look at that Psychological Drive.
01:20:50.735 - 01:21:07.569, Speaker A: Here's another one on superrare. And I believe this. Sold. Where is activity here? Sold for $448 to Oxhodl. Nice sale. Beautiful work. So the market continues to hum along here.
01:21:07.569 - 01:21:29.323, Speaker A: Here's Demon Ego doing an AI artwork enhance. Interesting title. And as you see here, cool work. So Demon Ego continuing to try anything and everything with great results here. Edition of 6 for 666. Here's Charles AI, who hadn't seen from for a while. And let's see if we can make this larger.
01:21:29.323 - 01:21:44.507, Speaker A: So interesting piece here with all of these bodies. I believe AI artwork kind of has a triptych feel to it. And here's AI Lay peacocks. So playing off peacocks. Look at how beautiful this is. Look at the color. Stunning.
01:21:44.507 - 01:21:52.745, Speaker A: Stunning. AI artwork here of peacocks. Look at this. Look at this purple. This. I won't call it indigo. Stunning.
01:21:52.745 - 01:22:12.285, Speaker A: Stunning. Stunning. Number six. There's a whole bunch AI Peacocks by Ilay that looks like it's sold out or transferred to other artists. Here's Strange Thing with a baseball bat in relief. More novel imagery from a. From Strange Thing, one of the greats of the AI art scene.
01:22:12.285 - 01:22:34.787, Speaker A: Look at that. So many original ideas coming from Strange Thing. Here's no Hygiene. Another original artist Son object. Wild, edgy, experimental or cure from no Hygiene. Look at that. It's sort of like, you know, if no Hygiene didn't make it, like, nobody would have made these works.
01:22:34.787 - 01:22:58.851, Speaker A: Here's another one. So just off the wall, experimentation here. You know, after you see 200, you know, no hygiene, you go, oh, there's something here. There's a consistency. There's a credibility, really, that is built up when you put out hundreds of works with a certain kind of edgy aesthetic. Then you start to build, then it starts to work, and people go, wow. Into the physicals.
01:22:58.851 - 01:23:19.379, Speaker A: Look at this. Why hasn't I feel like. Why hasn't anybody done this earlier? I feel like this is something I should have done, like 20 years ago. Liberation acrylic on canvas. This is Polo cutty, I think, and interesting. I'm not sure what this other stuff is, but this painting is awesome. Rider, not guilty.
01:23:19.379 - 01:23:35.473, Speaker A: Burglary, guilty. So just a CNN screenshot doing. Kind of looks like the airbrush style a little bit acrylic on canvas. Interesting. Here's Bondozo Bandido, also known as Hermes. Don't need homies, only dogs. So interesting.
01:23:35.473 - 01:23:58.401, Speaker A: Look at this background here. The black. So there's something to be said for just making a ton of work. You tend to be less self conscious with what you do and it leads to really great results. There's something to be said, you're just working so much that you're not thinking too hard. You just work till it's done and you start your next thing. A machine again, the credibility of making a lot of work.
01:23:58.401 - 01:24:18.485, Speaker A: Look at this brilliant work by machine. This brilliant juxtaposition. Michael Jackson in the desert here. Brilliant physical artwork by machine. There is machine actually. It's smaller artwork than I expected actually. So nice piece there.
01:24:18.485 - 01:24:32.401, Speaker A: And here's Nugget Brain. Look at this, these VHS movies. And here is the whole collection. These brilliant, brilliant paintings. I wonder what these sell for. Like maybe it's $2,000. Like they're as far as contemporary art.
01:24:32.401 - 01:24:56.217, Speaker A: Again, if you're spending $50,000 on the super edgy work in New York, maybe you pick up a Nugget Brain work. It's at the Enter art fair. Like this is kind of for, you know, what would you call it? Emerging artists. You know, Albert Contemporary. Probably get it for a couple thousand bucks. Moto583, Moto Hero. Just more brilliance from this super interesting artists.
01:24:56.217 - 01:25:38.049, Speaker A: Human Body Umbrella sold out. So you see there is still a market for art, you know, as the contemporary, you know, another theory on what's happening here with contemporary art. We saw it earlier in the show, contemporary art cratering. But we're still seeing a very healthy market in this newer generation stuff. Whether it's the drawings, the new humor as I like to call it on this stuff, or what we saw with machine or all of the digital art we've seen. I wonder if the, you know, if I think, you know, overpriced and over supplied in contemporary, maybe people there's just not the markets maybe just starting to crater. Maybe there's just not as much demand as there used to be.
01:25:38.049 - 01:25:57.855, Speaker A: Whereas there's still quite a strong demand for cool fresh energy of the next generation. Like is that what's going on? And that, my friends, is your show. Thank you for joining me again. Come check out the Twitter space with Wojak today. Should be a good one on digital abstract art. Until next time, take care.
