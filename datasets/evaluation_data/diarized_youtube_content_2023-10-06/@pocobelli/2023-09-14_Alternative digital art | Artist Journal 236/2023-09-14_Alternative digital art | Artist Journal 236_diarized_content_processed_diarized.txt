00:00:02.720 - 00:00:27.554, Speaker A: There is nothing like a deadline, as we said on the spaces yesterday with clownvamp, which was awesome. Welcome back, everyone. Thank you for coming back and thank you for the massive support. The numbers on Twitter actually kind of blew my mind for what they're worth. So. Artist journal, September 14, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from the high seas of the imagination in Berlin, Germany.
00:00:27.554 - 00:00:53.658, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and you know the artist. I'm sure most of you, and if you don't, you should. This is the great D. Thibodeaux, aka Hasdrubal waffle. And again, kind of reminded me of the work we were looking at the other day where it just kind of hit. It was the gozo. It was the Gozo work where it was just like.
00:00:53.658 - 00:01:43.708, Speaker A: It just was kind of instant and beautiful, and you just, you know, your inner collector just had to have it. And look at this gorgeous work with these almost airbrushed, chunky pixels in the background. Again, often using, you know, kids software, you know, art software to great effect here, sometimes combining more than one as we. You know, if you like his drubble waffle or DT badot, you can find an incredible spaces that we did with him about must be four, four months ago, I'm guessing now. And he was describing how he would have, like, nine different tabs open in his browser at the same time, working on different works and everything. So he's very prolific, as you can see here, champ. Referring to the boxer here, one assumes.
00:01:43.708 - 00:02:38.294, Speaker A: And this is an edition of three for 100 tezos on secondary, which, these days, isn't that as much money as it used to be? So, really beautiful work. We're gonna have to speed through this show. There's about, you know, 90 minutes worth of things to go through, and I have to actually be. In 50 minutes, I have to be at a lunch. So we're gonna go quickly, but we're not gonna go so fast that we don't look closer at this beautiful work here by Hasdrubal waffles. So, again, maybe for me, as you know, another day, another masterpiece, maybe for me here today, it's what really kind of strikes me and kind of captured me in this work is the airbrushed pixels. Maybe that epic contrast between spray, the airbrush, the very soft airbrush, and the mathematical geometrical perfect pixels.
00:02:38.294 - 00:03:23.134, Speaker A: Now, one more comment on that. This kind of. I don't know if we call it the aspect ratio of the pixels. Again, this is something I've been kind of really interested in, which is these different monitor outputs and how traditionally, or I'd say modernly, we would think of pixels as square. But you see here, these are almost like older pixels, these kind of vertical. There are horizontal pixels from Atari. And that also adds to the enjoyment of this piece, shall we say, with this wonderful green spray paint and multicolored frame, maybe even a default of sorts.
00:03:23.134 - 00:03:41.832, Speaker A: And this great boxer. Really interesting subject matter, too. I think it's worth noting. One of these was sent to me, and I didn't actually realize till I was almost done setting up this show. I was putting in tradscape at the end there, and I was like, oh, one was sent to me. So just FYI, full transparency. Oh, sent to me from ilay, which.
00:03:41.832 - 00:04:32.406, Speaker A: Wonderful. So, yeah, so, D. Thibodeaux, trouble street. So, also, the same artist playing with this series that they work on, which is almost kind of like a billboard notebook style. Again, hastruba waffle ditibido reminds me a lot of these. What we see with Keith Haring, actually, and what we see with Basquiat, as I was corrected on the pronunciation the other day, shout out to August and Basquiat, who I like to call Basquiat, maybe that's like the north american pronunciation, but these doodlers, these people who in high school, you know, were probably, and maybe elementary school, I was one of these people. Although, yeah, I've never really explored the doodle style too far recently.
00:04:32.406 - 00:05:08.544, Speaker A: But, yeah, one of these people who just seem to just doodle through high school, and then they're all of a sudden, they're making careers out of it. I don't know if Dtibodeau is making a career yet, but one imagines that's definitely a possibility in the future. Let's continue on. Big shout out and thank you to Clownvamp and everybody who showed up to yesterday's spaces. The first half, we talked mostly about Clownvamp's detective Jack, his new series that he's putting out on ETH, it's a prequel, and that was super fun. Clownvant was actually the first return guest, and there are so many people that haven't been on that I want to have on. Often.
00:05:08.544 - 00:05:35.728, Speaker A: English is an issue, interestingly. Like, it's the major. It's usually the only reason, oftentimes, that people don't come on these spaces is for language reasons, so. But I'm very happy to help people who actually struggle with English, so don't let that stop you. If it's something you actually feel like you might want to do, just jump off the deep end and we'll help you through it. The last half is actually pretty in depth AI stuff. So.
00:05:35.728 - 00:06:03.366, Speaker A: And I asked a lot of kind of simple questions to clownvamp. Like, what does stylize do? What's the seed do? So if you're interested in that, that is in my Twitter feed and you can find it there. And this just, this is part of what Clownvamp's putting out. Look at this piece here. Mostly raw AI mostly, but there is some editing here and there. Again, check out the space if you want to hear it. It's collaboration with brain drops.
00:06:03.366 - 00:06:26.326, Speaker A: So thank you again and thank you to Ilay here. This is incredible. Dpaint Pixel Pokebilly has covered Legojo's 100 most influential, influential people in AI CVR. In today's artist journal. Is it legitimate to mint someone else's work? So I assume this is Ilay here. The artist or Arlen Maltby? I think it's Ilay. Maybe they're the same person, I don't know.
00:06:26.326 - 00:07:00.574, Speaker A: But I have to say, I love this from a, you know, it just goes to show just using, like, it's pretty original, isn't it? And you actually capture the light likeness. I love the books. And I actually even like how it's like empty over here, which is kind of hilarious, all of it. I think it's just, I love this piece. I don't know if it's minted or not, but really, really cool. Some comments here as again, we run through this episode here. Thank you for all the comments, mcrenders.
00:07:00.574 - 00:07:28.876, Speaker A: I think a Patreon would be an awesome way to monetize, maybe even special drops for Patreon supporters. Zora has been awesome so far. It's amazing. Yeah, I mean, Mick, I think was at the top of the page we were looking at yesterday. It's amazing to see the power of the people diving into the Ethwaters headfirst, but excited for the journey. So, yeah, so Zora did some really nice has been really. It's a really interesting model, as Sabato pointed out, this idea of the free mint, but you share the fee with the artist.
00:07:28.876 - 00:07:47.358, Speaker A: So people mint for like $2 and, you know, maybe a dollar goes to the artist and then mint. Sorry, Mick. Minted maybe 1500, if I remember right. Or 700. Then you also have $700 for your free mint. So interesting economics. Death Rotina.
00:07:47.358 - 00:08:08.894, Speaker A: Absolutely love Gozo. Nice highlight in them. Was drawn to them the moment I saw their first works on early hens. So, a longtime fan of Gozo? Yeah, I'm more recent, maybe the last few months when I discovered those surrealistic works. Rada always loved hearing from Rada again. Rada got so many of us started in buying, especially in pixel art. You know, like, we take it.
00:08:08.894 - 00:08:22.444, Speaker A: I take it for granted now, you know, maybe two years later here. But at the time, it was a leap. And I thought, this pixel art is beautiful. And his rat is going to Sicily to do archaeology. Amazing, sir. Have fun and great fortune. Thanks for another fun episode.
00:08:22.444 - 00:08:56.042, Speaker A: As I said, more of a just self directed archaeology tour. If you're going to go to Sicily, you might as well. What are you going to do? Are you going to sit on the beach the entire time? It's going to be late October, early November. I thought I'd do a self directed archaeology tour and. Because what are you going to do? You know, give you something to do, give you a mission. When I was in Rhodes, I mean, it was like the acropolis in Rhodes there at Lindos is spectacular. And so why not? And again, the peloponnesian war actually had ended in Syracuse there.
00:08:56.042 - 00:09:21.124, Speaker A: So maybe. And of course, I did that series there, so maybe I actually want to put out videos. I want to go through each one of the works of the peloponnesian war one by one, and just maybe do like 5510 minutes on each one. So anyway, lots to do. Eight. So I'd subscribe to a patron of yours where the only benefit I get is knowing that you get to keep doing these free YouTube videos if you do other benefits. That's also cool, but I wouldn't overthink it.
00:09:21.124 - 00:09:44.624, Speaker A: Now, I got a message from Kiro yesterday that he got an ad, and he even showed me the video, which kind of freaked me out. So, yeah, there should be no ads. Maybe I need to go in there and just make sure. So, yeah, but all to say thank you. Thank you. And if you get ads on your YouTube, go to the Twitter. Okay.
00:09:44.624 - 00:09:56.468, Speaker A: I don't want any. Like, I'm not getting a penny for that. So YouTube shouldn't be putting any ads. And maybe they just start doing it automatically again. Let me know if you see an ad. I got one person. Otherwise, people haven't been seeing them.
00:09:56.468 - 00:10:18.148, Speaker A: The Danny, it's definitely illegitimate to mint someone else's artwork. It's disrespectful to the art scene because the only owners. Because the owners only foresee it for economic gains. Let's think for a second. What if these dead artists don't even support the idea of art as nfts? Good .1 of the huge dilemmas nowadays against the purists. Also, I think it's weird to manipulate my stuff, to use them as a catalog to new trends.
00:10:18.148 - 00:10:37.404, Speaker A: Nowadays, it's invalid. The art was created in another era to do other purposes. The artist, in this case Keith Haring, may have tried lots of techniques. Now, if the amigas are real, they were meant to stay in the amiga. Pretty sure it was just for experimentation and nothing else. I don't think they were ahead of their time. How would they be if the purpose was just to have fun? On a weird.
00:10:37.404 - 00:11:41.138, Speaker A: I actually agree with you here on this. They look like they were having fun, not trying to be cutting edge digital artists, although I think they also saw the potential. What if we mint da Vinci sketches as PDF? And people actually are doing this with the Mona Lisa and the Salvatore Mundi minting them? So is it fair they should remain as archive nor profit? So, actually, I think you hit the nail on the head here, too. Yes. If the artist is alive, they can do whatever they want with their artworks. So, you know, I had some additional thoughts here, which is, you know, what I thought was kind of like a nice solution to this whole kind of dilemma is if the Keith Haring foundation is going to mint the piece, they should mint it as the Keith Haring foundation and saying, look, we have extracted this, we are minting it. And we're not going to say, this is Keith Haring.
00:11:41.138 - 00:12:01.782, Speaker A: We're going to say, this came from this archive that looks like Keith Haring did it. He did not mint this piece. We are minting this piece as part of the foundation. And there it is. And then it's kind of like, well, it's a Keith Haring foundation work, then. To me, it seems a lot more legit because they're the ones minting it. But I agree.
00:12:01.782 - 00:12:47.336, Speaker A: Like, this is going to turn into, like, if we start having, you know, a real Magritte minted, or a real, like, early digital digital file minted, say, by Keith Haring. Like, it's a slippery slope, this whole thing. And then, like, I think we just have to keep a simple principle with whoever mints the work is basically the. The responsible, like the Guardian. So, like, there's probably legal language here that you could use, you know, is the, you know, the caretaker at the minimum? And if you're going to mint as a caretaker of someone else's work, then you mint it as the caretaker of someone else's work, not as that person. Thank you for the comment, the thoughtful comment, using your hair to date Sabato's forgery is fictitious humor. Thanks KF.
00:12:47.336 - 00:13:13.010, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. Kyle Flemmer JJJ energy would love to be able to mint and collect your videos. This has been proposed to me a couple of times, so I'll think about it. I'm thinking about it, yeah, and thank you for the interest. While this disposed on the question of minting photos of physical artworks. So a whole other issue here. I see them as just that, a minted photographic copy.
00:13:13.010 - 00:13:51.706, Speaker A: I see nothing wrong with the photocopy non fungible art of the original work gaining popularity or rising in financial value, similar to a poster or physical copy of the original artwork, which are seen to have less value than the original. Well, exactly. So as long as it's not being said, you know. Exactly. I think this is the key, which is like, if you're going to do the physical work, then here's my photographic NFT version, and don't expect it to be necessarily worth as much as the original. And maybe then you can do it with the salvatore mundi. As long as like this is kind of like the poster or an NFT version.
00:13:51.706 - 00:14:20.434, Speaker A: Take it for what it's worth. If you think it's worth, you know, if a market wants to pay for it, maybe that's the end, kind of, you know, the final say, shall we say thank you. I would read more of the comment here, but I actually have to run. Santiago is a codal basic. Thank you for the comment though, and I agree with you. So Santiago is a codal, basically pack selling the Sistine Chapel. Sometimes collectors get the short end of the stick.
00:14:20.434 - 00:14:57.514, Speaker A: It's incumbent on the collectors to do due diligence. I agree. Edmorola, always great to hear from you. And finally will disposed. I am sometimes just as confused as about anyone selling or minting works of posthumous artists. I think the artworks and commentary by the NFT community is funny and raising good points, although I think the practice becomes a question of ownership and collecting at its base. When a family member, or in these cases foundations, acquire works from their deceased family member, they assume official ownership, the same as any collector who may purchase an artwork.
00:14:57.514 - 00:15:33.494, Speaker A: The living artist can decide and develop contracts to maintain what will be done, and it is all subject to legal authority. So again, I think the solution is they can mint it as the Keith Haring foundation, and to me that's fine. You know, I don't see the issue. The issue is if they're pretending to be Keith Haring when they minted or saying attributing authorship. I think we will see situations where artworks are minted and handed inappropriately. But I don't think minting a digital artwork by a deceased family member to be sold is essentially against the rules of our capitalist system. Yeah, in a sense, people can do whatever they want.
00:15:33.494 - 00:15:56.242, Speaker A: It's a matter. But there are sort of mores that, because, again, it's a slippery slope. And if we let this kind of authorship issue go, it could call into question the whole model. I would argue, arguably, kinky bears is back. Great episode. Wait, you're not using ple? Yeah, which is a whole other kind of hilarious thing I do use. I started.
00:15:56.242 - 00:16:19.138, Speaker A: Sometimes I use please in my AI prompts because I feel like I might get a better answer and. Okay, well, thank you for all the comments, everyone. And finally, we had another one from Evelyn that I thought I had here. Let me just check. Oh, no, this was Gozo. This was interesting. And Evelyn's coming up here.
00:16:19.138 - 00:16:41.516, Speaker A: Thanks, Pokebelly, for diving in and sharing your thoughts on my new series. So Gozo is the artist who did this. And remember, we're speculating. Maybe there is some AI in it. Yes, there is some AI in these pieces. The raw materials, I create them at low resolution in stable diffusion, and then do the collage with them, cropping, editing, and adding pixels here and there. I think that's really cool.
00:16:41.516 - 00:17:00.290, Speaker A: It kind of felt like, you know, maybe there's AI because it looks so original yet kind of familiar. Again, I'm kind of back to this uncanny valley idea. Here's the comment from. Thank you for the comment, Gozo. Beautiful work. And here's a comment from Evelyn. I couldn't listen to the whole space, but thought it was awesome.
00:17:00.290 - 00:17:16.083, Speaker A: Referring to the Keith haring space. The estate is there to protect and serve the artist's legacy. If they think it's right, it's right. But they often want money. But what they should have done is minted one and donated it to a museum. Yeah, again, I'm kind of. I think I have a solution.
00:17:16.083 - 00:17:34.839, Speaker A: Feel free to agree or disagree. Anybody out there? I think they should just mint it as the Keith Haring foundation. Simple. Brian Brinkman were seeing early computer art being minted and validated by auction houses. C. Herring. The next logical step is early computer game art minted and preserved via original teams and creators.
00:17:34.839 - 00:17:58.046, Speaker A: Either art assets, concept art, or full abandoned game preservation. And it could get tricky with teams. Right, then. Then who's the author? So, yeah, interesting. And like you think of Ultima Four, one of my favorites. If you had Lord British there Richard, whose last name I forget right now. Yeah, I mean, if he started minting, kind of.
00:17:58.046 - 00:18:22.972, Speaker A: Yeah, so. But I don't know what he would mint. Would he mint a screenshot of the game? I don't know. So very interesting. And Shilley Preston was also an interesting comment here. Listening to Pokebelly talk about how pixels were seen in the past got me remembering the first time I got a video card from my computer that could render colored light and smooth out the pixels in doom. It blew my mind to go up to the wall and not see pixels.
00:18:22.972 - 00:18:51.564, Speaker A: Remember we were talking about how pixelation back in the early days was a bug, not a feature. It was seen as kind of crude. Visually speaking. I never wanted to see pixels again and figured that I never would because why would you ever go back to crappy pixels? I understand it now, but at the time that was my mindset. Pixels are lame and anything that shows pixels is lame and old boomer, if you will. Yeah, that is how people thought about it. And so later it took me a while to warm up to pixels again.
00:18:51.564 - 00:19:21.592, Speaker A: I remember when my son started showing me some of the Pixel games coming out about twelve years ago and I couldn't believe kids wanted to play them. I'm blown away by pixel art today though. I can't believe the stuff people make. So I think a lot of us, especially people that grew up in the eighties and nineties, share your journey shilly, thank you for the comment and great comment here from Hasdrubal waffle. Very awesome to see Fornax Void featured one of the greats of the early hen days. If you ever get a chance, check out the exhibition FV coded using unity. It is jaw dropping.
00:19:21.592 - 00:19:47.148, Speaker A: So here it is. And unfortunately I even got some nice so we don't have time to walk through it, but maybe on another episode we do. It looks awesome. It looks awesome. So thank you for the link there. Continuing on walk, still creating, still collecting. So as many of you have seen, as many of you have seen Tezos.
00:19:47.148 - 00:20:21.444, Speaker A: I mean it was at $0.63 when I loaded this up. It's at $0.64. It is getting low the Tezos price and hilarious. So a great time to collect though. And again, it reminds me of the golden age in comics as you're going to see with the I don't know how we're going to get through all this content today, but where it kind of makes it more precious in retrospect that when old Superman action comics number ten is printed on really cheap paper, I feel like there's a similar dynamic going on here. You know, Tezos is so cheap.
00:20:21.444 - 00:20:46.530, Speaker A: It's something that people will look back on potentially and go and just shake their head. I can't believe I could have got action comics number ten for basically nothing, right? Walk a couple of Tezos artists in their home. This was hilarious. I thought, that looks like Pompeii and tragically for those people, but kind of funny commentary. Tezos is on metamask. I double check everything. I am not an expert.
00:20:46.530 - 00:21:09.214, Speaker A: I haven't done it, and I'm very reluctant to connect my wallets to new things. But it looks like Tezos is using metamask, which if you don't know what metamask is, it's like a Ethereum wallet. But now it's plugging in, even, I heard, to bitcoin. Look, Solana. So that is pretty interesting. Nicholas Sassoon. Some photos of continuum which just opened at Leland's art museum in China.
00:21:09.214 - 00:21:26.734, Speaker A: So this is also pretty cool. Very nice looking. You know, when I first saw this, I thought this was on cyber virtual exhibition, but it's not. Look at how great a job they did, though. Okay, this is in China. Look at how great a job they did. This is to me.
00:21:26.734 - 00:21:44.830, Speaker A: Exactly. Or one of the great ways you do it, which is you go straight from floor or ceiling to floor here. Use a projector. Brilliant. Like it's beautiful and cool. Title pattern lb in the studio here. A little thread behind the process of my mint.
00:21:44.830 - 00:22:03.504, Speaker A: The end is to begin. So just a window into LB studio here. And I'll have to talk to Elbie and see if we can get him on the spaces here too. Just an awesome artist. And, you know, just a look at some of the. Look at this ancient computer here too. So just very cool and more.
00:22:03.504 - 00:22:43.816, Speaker A: Let's just look at this. So this is oil stick using the plotters. So as I was saying in the art matter spaces that we did, it's almost like a new form of mark making, you know, and not so new. I mean, I think even this has been going on since like the 1960s. I think even Rauschenberg, I think, was playing around with this stuff. But look at how nevertheless, you know, I could see never going back to, like, using your hand to paint after seeing the robot here, the pen plotter. Yo, Salazar.
00:22:43.816 - 00:23:08.572, Speaker A: And you see how good this looks too. Just really cool paintings here. And here's up close as well. Very nice documentation. And as an artist, you can see it's totally worth your while to post stuff as much as possible, show people what you're doing because it just creates more interest. It's free marketing without marketing. That is your marketing as an artist is showing your process, showing what you're up to.
00:23:08.572 - 00:23:35.406, Speaker A: That is your marketing without marketing, because you can't really market as an artist. It's like seeing those ads on Instagram and it's an artist and you're sort of like. It just looks kind of desperado, right? So you can't market as. You can't put a big billboard saying, buy my art, because that looks like nobody wants to buy your art. So how do you do it? You show your process, you show yourself at work, you show works in progress. Advice I should take. I'm giving myself as much as to everybody else.
00:23:35.406 - 00:23:53.518, Speaker A: RJ. A new collection, spectral pastiches, is now live. You can check it out here. So this is starting to stick. Pixel pastiches of non existent works by Hockney Hopper. Register and register reserves at only 0.05. And the splash, you see, there's more detail in the splash.
00:23:53.518 - 00:24:21.416, Speaker A: It was being kind of outlined before. Beautiful contrast in all this tiny pixelation here with the kind of soft, big, bold, smooth works. So this spectral Hockney version of the splash, incredibly cool work here by RJ. And it went for .2 to Skomra as we jump in. Spectrohockney, just like cheering for RJ on the sidelines here. Spectral Demuth.
00:24:21.416 - 00:24:42.224, Speaker A: This is awesome. This is awesome. And the artist, I'm not sure if I know Charles Demuth, maybe vaguely have heard, maybe seen a few of their works in a museum in New York at some point. Spectral Hopper, I assume. Edward Hopper. And so just very, very, very cool. Only 0.05
00:24:42.224 - 00:25:19.026, Speaker A: reserve, so deals to be had. ETH is at 1600, so $80 for a one of one RJ. Not bad to at least start the auction. Klumtube, inability, inevitability and a rabbit. So a little dive into surrealism here with seemingly with gloom tube. I mean, it has a bit of a Salvador Dali feel to it, doesn't it? So just interesting here to see gloom tube experiment. Remember we're seeing gloom tube experiment with the texture and it almost looks very painterly.
00:25:19.026 - 00:25:36.428, Speaker A: I think it was in the one we saw yesterday or the day before. A lot of almost like rough texture. So it's like rough canvas. Here's just some more experimentation. Interesting title too. So this is 29 tezos on secondary. Really beautiful gradient here as well.
00:25:36.428 - 00:25:53.944, Speaker A: And there's the gloom tube figure in the window in the background. Again, kind of a Salvador Dali feeling to it. This artist is awesome. Msuksu. I think we've looked at their work a long time ago. I just came across it on Twitter. I think this is a new one.
00:25:53.944 - 00:26:13.746, Speaker A: And there's just something about it. It kind of feels like it's like the visual equivalent of, like, alternative music in the digital art scene. Kind of has that feel to it. It's just got this kind of cool edge. We're going to look at some other works here, too. I was looking at curio fringes with. I don't know if it was their Twitter feed.
00:26:13.746 - 00:26:30.554, Speaker A: I think it was their Twitter feed, so. Oh, so this is from June. We may have actually already looked at this. That's how much I like this piece. There's just something about it. This is new neuve 1914. This I saw in curio fringes, I think Twitter.
00:26:30.554 - 00:27:05.108, Speaker A: Or actually I saw maybe this one in Curio fringe. And then I went to the page of NUV 1914. Super interesting artist. I'd almost be tempted to call NUV a gradient artist, but maybe that'd be oversimplifying, kind of abstract, just interesting art. Right? The plenitude of tezos here, fragmentos de arbol. So you know what we might loosely call a cubist like tree, but that would be overstating things. Let's just see how much these go for only five tezos and look at how slow they are to sell.
00:27:05.108 - 00:27:28.658, Speaker A: So in my universe, I go, ooh, undiscovered. Largely undiscovered here. Amigo conejo. So some interesting, almost like Fernand Leger type feeling works here. Again, heavily gradient kind of works would hang really well with Dan control. Nuv 1914, amigo Conejo. And this sold for only five tezos.
00:27:28.658 - 00:27:53.826, Speaker A: I mean, we're talking like $3 here on primary. And again, those took, like, several hours to sell. And one more here. This is a one of one, but it was burnt by NFT Spritz, bought them all and then burned. So the burning hasn't stopped. It continues. And as someone else was kind of messaging me, saying, oh, like all my work's being bought.
00:27:53.826 - 00:28:26.976, Speaker A: What should I do? Just save one for yourself if you don't want them to be burned, or at least if you want to prevent the one of one, as Sabato says, if you want to force the negotiation, so to speak, for the one of one. Because you see there's a royalty of 20% that NUV 1914 will never get on those burned works. And was Nuv consulted, maybe, maybe not. Continuing on axing with a new work here. The copyright treaty and pile of lies told by noteworthy people. An interesting, almost semi political work here. Cc zero worth mentioning.
00:28:26.976 - 00:28:54.616, Speaker A: And edition of 21. Only 79 tazos, only $50 here on secondary. And here we have the crash test dummy, the old Mac, the skull with the halo. So I want to call it like a pretty, a narrative painting here. Interesting perspective here. You see how it's almost like a wall, but then it's disturbed by almost this portal. You have this kind of like almost a visual pun here with the perspective.
00:28:54.616 - 00:29:25.320, Speaker A: So a little bit surreal over here as well. And kind of like legitimated, we might say, the store by the shadow here. So interesting work going on here. Beautiful brushwork as ever. Let's just see very quickly, although we have to speed up here, 69 tezos on primary and or 44 tezos on primary. So pretty reasonable. Probably sold out in like 120 seconds here.
00:29:25.320 - 00:29:49.770, Speaker A: That's what it looks like. Continuing on the myth with a couple of really cool works here. Myth brain. This is a one of one which sold for 120 tezos, which again, these days, I mean, what is that? Like $75, $80. So deals are to be had here. Nice and painterly at the top and just kind of a kind of another kind of slightly doodly feeling. Some nice textures here, too.
00:29:49.770 - 00:30:04.026, Speaker A: Looks like a procreate work with the trademark myth. Clouds and colors at the bottom there. Very cool work. 120 tezos. And that was just on primary to ib patal. And another work by the myth. Six cigarettes for my breakfast.
00:30:04.026 - 00:30:19.594, Speaker A: Don't calm my anxieties. Kind of a humorous work here. A lot of texture in this one. Interesting colors here. Again, not afraid to challenge the viewer here. And the myth Lemonhead classic figure here, only $9.28 on secondary.
00:30:19.594 - 00:30:55.112, Speaker A: If you missed it, only an edition of 15 kappa Sage headaches. So continuing with the super, you know, tons of people here, the designer looking snake figure and everything, the mayhem of Kappa Sage's work, the flowers, the landscape and everything. Just really interesting work here. The Red Sea, the purple tree edition of one for only $49.32. Headaches. 77 tezos from Kappa Turkarak in traffic. This is a one of one to this cell.
00:30:55.112 - 00:31:23.532, Speaker A: Yes, it went for only ten tezos to Bangkok. Mike, I thought this was just another brilliant work of contemporary life by Turkarak here, here you just have a dispute in the car and someone, you know, bringing the baseball bat to deal with it. Some really nice kind of textures in the background. Beautiful work from Turkarak. Very prolific. This was a beautiful work made on a small iPad, a mini iPad here. IPad mini by u or hello, I am uu.
00:31:23.532 - 00:31:44.400, Speaker A: Still life with three red circles drawing on smaller iPads. September 13. Just kind of a nice work, kind of reminiscent of the Hockney kind of iPad paintings. And here you see just some interesting, I guess, ping pong rackets or something. Or maybe you have those in the beach in Greece, on the islands of Greece. Some. It's an orange ball there.
00:31:44.400 - 00:32:13.162, Speaker A: So anyway, very interesting. Nice floor here too. Nicely put together. This is hilarious kind of self portrait. Three sliced of the failed artist number 37 by wasteman Gold Minevich edition of ten only three tezos. And here we see the defibrillator and the artist with a cigarette in their mouth and maybe a beer there in the hot dog. Terrible diet and being rescued here.
00:32:13.162 - 00:32:47.564, Speaker A: So there are still eight on primary there from waistband. Goldman bitch. This I also think I found in curio fringes Twitter feed, which I highly recommend. Just again, I'm kind of back to this alternative digital art. Okay, I really have to run here. We have to go fast. Cigarettes by Dan control.
00:32:47.564 - 00:32:59.220, Speaker A: This is on Zora. Really nice. Two, four, six. Really nice piece using repetition. Classic. And of course the gradients. And of course these are very modern cigarettes.
00:32:59.220 - 00:33:33.510, Speaker A: These are the ones that are full of vapor, the vapes vapor cigarette. Tornado Rodriguez with a really cool work here on Solana. Let's just bring it up big. And here you see Tornado and the classic kind of bud here and the mushrooms and the sun. And I think I was reading tornado, say, how spring is arriving in the southern hemisphere. So maybe we should all be traveling south of the equator, all of us in the north here. This is on exchange art for 0.42
00:33:33.510 - 00:33:54.398, Speaker A: sol. And there are eleven left. So actually pretty reasonably priced here too. And also, again, showing the process here, showing the black and white drawing too. So very cool work from tornado. And this is, let's see if that loads. We might have to bring this up.
00:33:54.398 - 00:34:17.594, Speaker A: It's a really cool work. Let's see if this loads because we really. Let's continue here and maybe we come back to that one on super rare. Timothy Jullienne tropicals. So a new experimental work here from Timothy Julien. Looking good again, playing with palm leaves and other trees again. Kind of has a bit of a florida or tropical vibe, as the title would say.
00:34:17.594 - 00:34:39.134, Speaker A: Tezos 50 on secondary, only an addition of ten. See if that other work. Yeah, I think we're having issues just with it loading up here. Continuing on demon ego. We'll bring it back tomorrow. Demon ego, tyrant number two, a one of one collection of tyrants. So again, looking like a kind of like a PFP style collection here from demon ego.
00:34:39.134 - 00:35:00.386, Speaker A: So another clue here. And look, there's music. I have to say, the music, like the taste in music I love in this scene. So we're going to continue on here. Very cool from demon ego. Let's see. Okay.
00:35:00.386 - 00:35:25.554, Speaker A: An interesting work that could hang in the same room here. This is Mick Render's consciousness system. So this is, I believe, the first work Mick has put on foundation, or on ethereum, perhaps, or on foundation. He put out the work on Zora, of course. So cool work. Using the almost like a windows desktop kind of vibe and putting different things in each window. So a cool classic trope here.
00:35:25.554 - 00:35:50.644, Speaker A: And, God, I want to answer this. So beautiful work here by mcrenders. And continuing on, check this out. This is cyber mystic Garden. Marcel Pinello. You know who I like to call the heir to Alex Gray here, the digital air to Alex Gray. So here is a preparatory work.
00:35:50.644 - 00:36:19.640, Speaker A: Of course, Marcel is doing the. Marcello is doing the astrological signs here. And let's just hit play here. So you can see all of the glory here in Marcelo Pinel's work, the Zodiac. So just beautiful, beautiful work here by this artist here. Totally original, you know, really own style and everything. $61 on secondary.
00:36:19.640 - 00:36:58.144, Speaker A: Let's just see what it's sold for on primary 40. Tazo is really reasonable these days for such a great, you know, precious work here from Marcelo Pinel. Thought this was brilliant. Captain America here by this artist, Davishi on the Davishi on Twitter here. And so just a cool kind of pixel art piece has a bit of a video game feel to it. You know what it made me think? Like, if I was Marvel and I was like, how do we kind of breathe some life into our animated series? It's like, let's make them, like, pixel art style. Wouldn't that be great? That would be cool.
00:36:58.144 - 00:37:23.994, Speaker A: You probably get a lot of viewers, just like, in the digital art scene there. Other works that I just found, other pixel artworks that just appeared on x pixel art, lost in thought by Satamo Mapp. And interesting work here with some. Looks like an aquarium of sorts, but the fish are kind of going back and forth. Not exactly sure. Interesting palette here, too. Continuing on, Julian Lake Pixel art.
00:37:23.994 - 00:37:45.386, Speaker A: So again, another beautiful landscape here from Twitter. And again, this is Julian, the artist Julian. So the artist Julian on Twitter. So we. I think we looked at some of their work yesterday. So not all artists mint their work, right? So there's some really cool pixel artists that don't mint their work. Mech TXT.
00:37:45.386 - 00:38:06.770, Speaker A: And this was in for Tezquake aid. And all proceeds will be donated to Tez quakeaid for the earthquake in Morocco. And a really beautiful animated pixel artwork here. With a light seemingly, or a torch in this frame. And then the beautiful dithering. And for a good cause. And beautiful color there, too.
00:38:06.770 - 00:38:35.566, Speaker A: Edition of 100 selling out, I think, at eight tezos each. Ten tezos each. So a nice raise there for the earthquake victims in Morocco. Muji, with a beautiful work here. An edition of ten turbulent data transfer. And I have to say, what Muji is doing in these screens here, this sort of stuff is just totally awesome, and I don't see it anywhere else. It's just like this.
00:38:35.566 - 00:39:03.292, Speaker A: It makes you really. It just kind of takes that pixel art aesthetic and just concentrates it into one little area. And it's just pure joy to look at these things. Interesting color in the stithering at the bottom here. This is only ten tezos edition of ten holographic factory. Number seven by holographics, by gogolitis. So a new work here by gogolitis, and great to see.
00:39:03.292 - 00:39:26.336, Speaker A: Go. Go back on the scene. And you see here the prisms going through, kind of like. And we're seeing a kind of different move here on the pixel art factory. Like, you know, again, coming back refreshed here. So it's almost like circuit board sort of style here, mixing with the bricks, so reusing elements, bringing in new ones. Very nice work here.
00:39:26.336 - 00:39:44.124, Speaker A: And offers are coming in for gogolitis. Maybe you can guess who this is. The brilliant Kappn with a new plants work. And these huge, chunky. I mean, Kappn can do no wrong right now. Like, everything that's coming out is gorgeous. And this is just another example.
00:39:44.124 - 00:40:08.994, Speaker A: Again, if you want to hear Kapn, we have a Twitter space with Kapn that we did. I'm thrilled to get all these Twitter spaces with these artists on. Yeah. Slava three with a new one. GM plant 3.5. And this is kind of hilarious, a plant, but instead of branches or plant stalks, you have bones and diskettes and everything. So kind of a classic work from Slava three.
00:40:08.994 - 00:40:23.568, Speaker A: This is an open edition for $9.50. Each, 29 have been minted. Pretty good. Spuegel's maskinen with a really interesting work here. As you can see, the bed kind of. And that looks like a hospital bed. And then the cradles.
00:40:23.568 - 00:40:42.808, Speaker A: This looks like cradle to the grave, doesn't it? Kind of an epic piece here. And then, you know, married. And then in the hospital bed. Dark work in a great way by spoogels maskinen, four seasons. Awesome. Sold 0.5 to the irritant.
00:40:42.808 - 00:40:52.214, Speaker A: Good work, spoogles. That looks great. Very cool. Just load this up. We'll see if our other thing loaded up. No, it never did. We'll have to keep that for tomorrow.
00:40:52.214 - 00:41:13.892, Speaker A: Continuing on here, a beautiful work here from Ed Marolla on foundation. Look at this thing. So the experimentation continues here. What is the title of this thing? And all these spirals and everything found dog Marolla dreams. Ed Marolla reserve of 0.1. Pretty reasonable price here. Really cool work from Ed Marolla.
00:41:13.892 - 00:41:31.412, Speaker A: And of course, the Tes vending machine begins today. Well, it's Thursday, Tez vending machine takeover. And Ed has made an awesome work celebrating that. Look at this. So just awesome. He could make like rock posters or whatever. I mean, we saw it with the Metallica video, right? Edition of 60.
00:41:31.412 - 00:42:00.144, Speaker A: And this probably goes into the Tez vending machine. Green ginger with another cool kind of Pixel city. Some cool music, interesting color, nice little tezos logo. Pretty rad. Pretty rad from green ginger. Six tezos. Continuing on, we have stippin pixel with another cool catwork.
00:42:00.144 - 00:42:15.324, Speaker A: And this is also on Zora. Now, this is 0.01 ETH, so it's not an open edition. Just loaded up here. So zero minted so far. And. But cool work of cats animation made with aseprite.
00:42:15.324 - 00:42:38.630, Speaker A: And more pixel art from Twitter, silenced by day Septentrion. And so more, you know, pixel art nature here in this really chunky tree here. Almost fall is coming. And some nice birds there, too. Continuing on, Ivan Hugo, turtle Temple. And an interesting Glb here. Kind of pixelated.
00:42:38.630 - 00:42:53.790, Speaker A: So I brought it in with the pixel art section here. We're seeing more and more of these GlB's. Interesting work from Louis. Happy hungry. Always one or the other. I quite liked the, this part especially, like the whole thing. The color is excellent.
00:42:53.790 - 00:43:07.234, Speaker A: The whole interesting composition. Happy to dream. Hungry for more. Just kind of a good looking work here. Just kind of really hit. Great color. An interesting kind of subject and everything.
00:43:07.234 - 00:43:21.822, Speaker A: Look at this work by Santiago on Zora. Map inside a memory to go to a wrong place. Another beautiful title here. Three minted so far. Open edition. Great color on this one, the orange background. So you gotta love that.
00:43:21.822 - 00:43:36.674, Speaker A: And you see all the details here that go into the Santiago works. So, looking really nice over there. And. And another work by Santiago. This is a one of one for 50 tezos. Here. Might take a while to load here.
00:43:36.674 - 00:43:53.638, Speaker A: We are running against the clock here, my friends. Okay. Portrait of gone Fiorell c three po tonight. So again, kind of, you know, but we see evolution here. We see development. We're seeing change. He's keeping it new.
00:43:53.638 - 00:44:05.898, Speaker A: Nice square work. A nice little frame here, too. Different kinds of textures. Beautiful work. 50 tezos human colonel at auction for only 15 tezos. A one of one. So also Santiago.
00:44:05.898 - 00:44:24.834, Speaker A: So cool work. We see the similarity in the style. More of a profile picture. Lorna Mills. An edition of 32 blue murder. And this has some great textures here, as you can see. Almost these vertical pixels down here and almost reminds me of the lost highway a bit.
00:44:24.834 - 00:44:39.814, Speaker A: An interesting color, as usual, in the dark blue. Blue. Pamela chirone. And here is chaka. And this is an edition of 15 on Tazo. So hugely prolific as usual, putting out multiple works a day, I think. Really nice looking work here, too.
00:44:39.814 - 00:44:55.114, Speaker A: Also put out a genesis on sound XYZ is a song. My genesis on Sound XYZ is a song I made in March 2021. Since the pandemic met my midi keyboard, I spent many nights in the loop. Hope you enjoy it. So here it is. And I brought it up. See if it plays.
00:44:55.114 - 00:45:12.394, Speaker A: May have to reload. We are battling. We are battling many forces here today, my friends. So we may have to try and bring that one back tomorrow, too. Here's another one. Let's see if this one loads. There we go.
00:45:12.394 - 00:45:33.076, Speaker A: Saturday disco night on Zora. So cool. Tons of work from Pamela. Love the cell phone in there, too. See if this one works. Dos takelass. Try one more time and you can mint it.
00:45:33.076 - 00:45:56.022, Speaker A: Four mints already. And I believe this is on ETH. So we'll come back to that one. And here on another day, you don't know who we are on Zora. So we're seeing nft music here. So cool. Just to see people minting music.
00:45:56.022 - 00:46:13.426, Speaker A: See where that goes. Santiago, Marcel Munteanu. And by Vicky. With a cool glb here. And, yeah, you can sort of see Santiago's body work. Generative artwork here looks like it's being inspired. Equipped with AI pictures and a two and a half.
00:46:13.426 - 00:46:31.754, Speaker A: The GlB of inspirational and prolific artist Santiago Marquez. Model by Vicky. Conceptual design, fashion by Marcel Munteanu. Continuing on, another GlB by plants and mcrenders. So you see those huge, chunky pixels here. It looks like of a plant continuing on. This is quite cool, too.
00:46:31.754 - 00:46:56.154, Speaker A: Again, kind of alternative digital art sort of feel to it. A one of one for 35 tazos. And I think also I saw this on Curio Fringe's feed. I was enjoying curio fringes feed, Twitter feed this morning. And here is just some of the other work. So again, kind of this, like, you know, really edgy digital art here. Again, you see it here.
00:46:56.154 - 00:47:26.914, Speaker A: Experimental. Interesting. Lego Joe with a work here. This is the weather, rainfall estimates, and so just a, you know, the weather, I'm sure has interested a lot of people with all of its beautiful imagery. So Legojo finally goes for it and does something about it and makes a work based on this great kind of radar imagery inside of a older, what looks like deluxe paint here. Rainfall estimates, addition of 15 for ten tezos on object. Here's another work here.
00:47:26.914 - 00:47:41.010, Speaker A: This is called error amulet radiant decay. This is by, I think, Lucy Benson. So interesting work here. I think this is on manifold. So an animated abstract work here. Pretty experimental. Quite beautiful.
00:47:41.010 - 00:48:03.586, Speaker A: Great color. Mika Oladev, artifact 38 and 39. So more artifacts in this series, usually using the body as a subject with some glitching. Artifact number 36, one of one. I think these are going for 50 tezos. Yeah, this went to Bijou and Renki with a pretty cool work here. Celebrating the JPEG artifacts out here.
00:48:03.586 - 00:48:26.138, Speaker A: Or the noise, so to speak, the digital noise. Really nice work here. Great texture. Toku yama from Renki, eight tazos edition of ten somfei with a very cool kind of Buddha here. No volume. Really nice piece here. Combining like the sun and or even the halo or whatever you'd call it, with the buddha.
00:48:26.138 - 00:48:41.562, Speaker A: A nice piece there. And this was interesting too. Tucan cyclops. It almost looks like a bambi type thing. Really glitched out here. Processed analog video here with strange sort of, you know, head here. So interesting.
00:48:41.562 - 00:48:59.474, Speaker A: Analog video hardware portal, porta malmar. All one post collage AI art. So some more interesting collage AI art combinations from Porta Malmar edition of one, only five tezos. Beautiful. Great color. Here's another one. Flower fish.
00:48:59.474 - 00:49:23.890, Speaker A: This one's sold. And so combining a flower and a fish and always having that kind of signature texture, here is Mikey de la creme and Mikey Wilson, a one of one on tazos. So it's a pretty big file. So I brought up the Twitter version. And here is someone playing the guitar, but with a completely different feel to it. Processed and almost glitched out there. And here is zoom post rooms number six for fortezos.
00:49:23.890 - 00:49:49.034, Speaker A: And continuing this series here with the plants, an interior in the foreground and a landscape in the background. Really nice, kind of painterly and beautiful edition of ten for fortezos and some works by stooks by tewks out here. Posted on Twitter. Some interesting experimental works here, some more. So great experimentation from tewks. And here's little cakes. Throwaway doll number six.
00:49:49.034 - 00:50:20.458, Speaker A: I thought this one really stood out and was quite, quite beautiful and interesting. This doll that was kind of where the face is kind of melting a little bit. You almost see anatomy in there a little bit. Edition of three now 35 tezos on secondary. I thought this was brilliant too, by little cakes, putting the art, basically the artist statement here, minting it. And I thought that was quite interesting way of kind of preserving the, you know, insights into the creation of the work. So it's like preserving the, the about of the series.
00:50:20.458 - 00:50:44.500, Speaker A: I thought that was quite brilliant. Strange thing with some new. Still playing with the basically neoclassical reliefs here, this time on bomber jackets in the background. So interesting work there, as ever. Evelyn o with an interesting combination of AI and digital painting. So very nice piece here. And yeah, you see all of the experimentation here through it.
00:50:44.500 - 00:51:04.076, Speaker A: So big shout out to Evelyn o. Thanks again for the comment there. And Pinocchio. Valen Kako after rain. I thought this was just a cool painting I saw on Twitter of, like, Pinocchio with mushrooms around Amerita Muscaria. Is that how you'd say it? And just an interesting painting here. It's a mint on Arzora I just saw here.
00:51:04.076 - 00:51:22.550, Speaker A: Here's my friend Ben, who put out a cool work here. He usually does memes. And so you can see he's a physical artist. He uses like, it's oil on paper, but water based oil paints. So it's always kind of interesting over there. I believe he's still using water based oil paints. He shows the process and everything.
00:51:22.550 - 00:51:45.514, Speaker A: Cool work there. And Kalana contemporary with showing a work by Heliodoro Santos. Sad to see it leave my collection. But I must say, true to the mission of leveraging physical work to onboard trad collectors, to digital. So here is that work here. And we're going to look at a work by Helio Santos. So again, using a pen plotter, this time with a brush.
00:51:45.514 - 00:52:09.058, Speaker A: So it continues to be interesting out here. Continues to be very interesting. And here is the full work of the mountain here. So this is the result. And this is Britney Spears. We're going to have to mute that for a second. Here's Britney Spears done by walk.
00:52:09.058 - 00:52:31.134, Speaker A: So hilarious. I assume that's Britney Spears, was it, say, paparazzi? So out there, continuing his work, Mark Belden, someone we've been showing for a while here. Kind of a variation. Always has brilliant color and a brilliant production here. So great work from Mark Belden. And that, my friends, is your show. I'm not sure we're going to have the.
00:52:31.134 - 00:52:37.304, Speaker A: There we go. All sorts of stuff going on today. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
