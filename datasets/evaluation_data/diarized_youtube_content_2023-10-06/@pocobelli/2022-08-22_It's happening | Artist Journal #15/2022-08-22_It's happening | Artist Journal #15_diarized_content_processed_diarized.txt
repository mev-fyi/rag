00:00:06.560 - 00:00:40.374, Speaker A: Artist journal, August 22, 2022. My name is Adrian Boccabelli, your artist reporter on the scene. Once again checking out tezos, where again, big things are happening. As I was saying on twitter, it's happening. It is happening. And we're back to Louis Osborne. Here we are back to Louis Osborne because the reason I'm back to Louis Osborne is because I think what's happening with him is the model.
00:00:40.374 - 00:01:10.214, Speaker A: This is what's going to happen to everybody else, or at least everybody that is lucky enough to, quote unquote, make it. And I think that's going to be a lot of us. A lot of us. So, yeah, and so a couple of things, actually. First of all, he put out Louis Osborne. And for those that don't know, he's been kind of blowing up. If you didn't watch that episode, we're on day four of videos.
00:01:10.214 - 00:01:49.310, Speaker A: And what I'm trying to do here is normalize this in my brain so that I don't even think about it. And it's a part of my routine, and I hit record and I just kind of report. And it's like a journal. It's a diary of sorts, where basically, again, I check out what's going on in the world, talk about the world, which to me is kind of the tazos, which is a lot of my time. Someone was commenting, I love all the tabs that are up in your chrome. And I just had to laugh because here they are again. And, yeah, like, welcome to my digital life.
00:01:49.310 - 00:02:12.474, Speaker A: My girlfriend, she's like, you're in the metaverse. Like, half the time here, you and my son are in the metaverse. Anyway, so I'm trying to make this a habit. So here we're back because there is something, interestingly, there is something to talk about every day here. The NFT scene. It's a fast moving scene. So first of all, he puts out his one of one.
00:02:12.474 - 00:02:35.864, Speaker A: And again, why do we care? This is the model. This is what we can come to expect for other artists that blow up on this ecosystem. So that's why I'm. This is a case study, okay? So it's well worth our attention. So he puts up a one of one yesterday. He's been doing really well. He kind of blew up about a week ago.
00:02:35.864 - 00:03:01.314, Speaker A: And. Yeah, on the 20 August, today's the 22nd, so I guess he put it up on Saturday. 02:53 a.m. My time gets an offer right away for 150 within. And I think it was a 24 hours auction. I think so, yeah. Because yesterday I don't know how long it was, one or two days.
00:03:01.314 - 00:03:42.776, Speaker A: Anyways, he ends up getting at 147 in the afternoon. Yesterday, Berlin time, he gets a 2000 tezos bid, which anybody who's been buying and selling on tazos in the last little while knows that that is a big amount, especially for, you know, Louis Osborne. So that was interesting. Again, it's back to this idea that there is a wave. And this is, they're starting with Louis Osborne, maybe with others too, that I don't know about. Feel free to leave a comment if there's other artists that you guys are like, yeah, check this out. Haiti, up to his, up to his, up to no good.
00:03:42.776 - 00:04:03.444, Speaker A: Again. So feel free to leave comments of other artists if you're seeing something else where we can kind of pool our knowledge a little bit with this very small. And I'm totally cool with having this small audience, but I was thinking to myself, also, if I keep doing this, like, it's not going to be small for long. And I'm kind of. And that's great too. That's good for me. That's good for everybody.
00:04:03.444 - 00:04:34.522, Speaker A: But let's see, let's enjoy the, again, like I say, enjoy the cheap times while they last. Because my friends, what's going to happen is what happened to this? We're not going to be able to afford Louis Osborne's work anymore. Okay. Then he released this. Let's just go to the activity page. Let's look at the chronology of events here, because this was released 25 edition on August 19. So the day before.
00:04:34.522 - 00:05:01.244, Speaker A: So we're talking Friday. And if you look at the history on this thing, I used to buy Lewis Osborne's works. Like, I bought the. This is moving cities four. I bought one and two for something like three tezos. Now, if you want to buy Louis Osborne's moving cities four and maybe kind of complete your collection or keep your collection, well, this is what it's going to cost you. If we go to the history here.
00:05:01.244 - 00:05:33.824, Speaker A: Look at this history. I mean, it's like a book. So he mints it, and at 1243, within two minutes, he's got a 30 tazo spid. And you see this 30, 25, ten, 3131, 20. So 40. So gets a ton of offers. Again, this guy's blown up, obviously, right? Canceled offer.
00:05:33.824 - 00:06:04.144, Speaker A: So finally, like, look at all these offers. 55, 42. It's like a mania. And that's the power of art as an investment. Okay? Yes, we are being good members of society by buying art. But these are not terrible investments, my friends, especially when we're getting it this cheap. And that's why I keep saying like, enjoy it while it's cheap.
00:06:04.144 - 00:06:32.392, Speaker A: Because what's happening with Louis Osborne here, look at all these offers. We're going to be priced out soon, or at least the middle class who can now afford to buy art on tezos and buy it while you can. Is my advice to you. Not financial advice, just my thoughts, my opinion, which you shouldn't take as financial advice. But that's my take. That's how I see the world. Buy it while you can.
00:06:32.392 - 00:07:35.764, Speaker A: Because I never bought art until frankly four months ago, five months ago when I landed on this platform because I couldn't afford it or I couldn't justify it, let's put it that way. Yeah, I could buy some, one piece of art. So now to complete our narrative here, Lewis Osborne. So he finally starts accepting offers like, you know, at 05:00 I think he minted at twelve. So at noon. So 5 hours later, like 100 offers later, 1050 756-955-5048 so the lowest was 43 tezos when I was paying like let's say three or four max, a month ago. So am I going to spend 43 tezos and fight it out with all these people when there's so much other great art on the platform? No, but eventually give it a year.
00:07:35.764 - 00:08:09.646, Speaker A: I mean, we see changes happening pretty quickly here. What are these prices going to be in a year? As long as society holds together is my question for you. And even if society doesn't hold together, we're going to have some of the most precious assets, I would argue, in our society, which is the digital art revolution. We're going to have a major chunk of it. We're going to have like what are going to be iconic works. They exist on this platform. That is my conviction.
00:08:09.646 - 00:08:58.884, Speaker A: Okay, and maybe this sounds pretentious, but as someone who has grown up in museums, you know, my parents, that's what they did, they would go to museums, okay? And I am telling you, yeah, so that's my conviction on this. And what I'm saying is we're going to be priced out really quickly here because I'm already priced out. Yeah, technically I can afford a Lewis Osborne work, but I don't want to pay that much. And the whole reason I started buying art is I couldn't believe how cheap it was. Like, yeah, hell, I'll give you $5 for your piece of art now, but I'm not going to give you like a hundred. And like I, you know, like all of a sudden, that's a different class, or I will if it's a very precious work. Art.
00:08:58.884 - 00:09:22.366, Speaker A: I gave Dai with the most likes. I think I gave them 700 tazos the other day. That's probably the most I've ever spent on tazos. But Daiwith the most likes sells for $15,000 on Ethereum. If I can get a one of one on tazos for 1400, frankly, I'm laughing. Okay. Like, am I worried that I'm not going to be able to get rid of that? No.
00:09:22.366 - 00:09:46.084, Speaker A: So that's both a exciting addition to the collection and it's also a fabulous investment. It's just arbitrage over people that are still figuring tezos out. You know, he's on super rare. Look at his price list and then go to the Tezos and you're going to be like, oh, wow, there's some deals here. So you see all this action. So that is. So that's.
00:09:46.084 - 00:10:14.734, Speaker A: It's happening. That's what I'm calling this video just to kind of finish on Lewis Osborne here before I touch just a couple other artists. So it's interesting also to watch when you have a big sale like that. What is happening? Like, look, he sold this one for 80 tezos, 79 tezos 12 hours ago. This is the mint from Friday. He's going to soon be like. I mean, if he keeps this up and it's not just some sort of temporary wave.
00:10:14.734 - 00:10:34.254, Speaker A: Yeah. Like he's printing money and he's going to be able to sell these things for like 40 tezos as a mint price at an addition of 25. So that is happening. Then we got, I guess this looks like an old one. I don't know what this bang is here. Automation. One of the first ones I ever picked up.
00:10:34.254 - 00:10:59.068, Speaker A: That's 45. Edition of 550 selling for two. Okay. Edition of 100 selling for ten. So he's doing well and he continues to do well. A little more organized today. I still got my eye from a market perspective on Adelia, who I think is just, again, this kind of native Internet artist that I think just kind of.
00:10:59.068 - 00:11:35.240, Speaker A: She just kind of captured a. I almost want to call it archetype of this kind of manga poetry. It's like she took the anime manga style and turned it into a kind of narrative painting poetry in the form of almost kind of cartoonish sort of works. But I don't mean that at all. Like, I'm a huge fan and I just spent like 95 tezos on her Genesis piece, so. Yeah, so. But I guess the reason I wanted to bring her up again is, I think she's going to be one of the next.
00:11:35.240 - 00:11:59.700, Speaker A: If not, she already is. Like, look at these sales. 1 hour, five hour. These are small sales right now, but she's making a lot of sales on the secondary. 5 hours, 7 hours, 15 hours, you know, and then starting 15, like, they're starting to get snapped up. Her works, you know, ten editions of 30, they're starting to get snapped up. So that's interesting.
00:11:59.700 - 00:12:14.012, Speaker A: So more evidence. I just wanted to highlight this as kind of like a typically great tezos work. By three, a five, a one, a. Just another example. This was released. It's. You can't.
00:12:14.012 - 00:12:38.094, Speaker A: It was minted, but you can't buy it yet. I think it's part of this. What does it say here? The vending machine event. So I think in a couple of days, I think somehow we're gonna have access to this. I wasn't able to figure out all the deal, the real art of the deal here. I wasn't able to figure it out. But I'm sure it'll be really made really clear to us soon enough so that we can buy this stuff.
00:12:38.094 - 00:13:09.294, Speaker A: But look at this, right? Let's just maximize this. Just another great example of what was almost kind of lost in contemporary art, which was narrative painting. At least that's what I'm calling it, where it's just like it's a story in a static image. Okay? You have x copy commentary. Like, he's got this x copy work, and then you got parasite. One of one by Xerox. I'm actually not.
00:13:09.294 - 00:13:44.956, Speaker A: I know Xerox is like some kind of OG, seemingly in the NFT, maybe Tezos community. I think he just copies or. I'm actually not too familiar with his orcs, but it seems to have something to do with Xerox NFT or whatever. You see the little creme de creme membership card, the ashtray, and then you see the great portrait. And again, the stuff behind v for vanguard. There are little groups there. Again, this kind of trademark logo of, like, Yves.
00:13:44.956 - 00:14:18.098, Speaker A: Was that Yves Saint Laurent or whatever that is. World famous vending NFT. So just another classic example of like, this is, you know, people talk of a digital renaissance to me. This is where it's happening is in works like this. And these kind of narrative works like this is like Renaissance painting. Okay? Italian Renaissance painting. We are having a rebirth of that, but not with the squiggles, which are kind of interesting in their own right, but I think highly overpriced.
00:14:18.098 - 00:14:32.814, Speaker A: This is where it's happening. Okay. And works like this. And this is just one example of many. So congrats to three a five, a one a for another. Great work. This is another final thing.
00:14:32.814 - 00:15:07.708, Speaker A: These shows always go way longer than I intend. Just the power of pixel art. So this guy, Mek TXT, I just kind of recently discovered through Twitter, and he put offers. He just said, everybody put a one Tezos offer, and I'll randomly pick using some random machine on Tezos. And he got so many offers. Look at all these offers that are still kind of open. And now it's selling for nine tezos.
00:15:07.708 - 00:15:38.856, Speaker A: And I guess my point is, pixel art is very popular. Like, if you want the fast to get on the fast track on Tazos, I think you just start putting out some pixel art. I kind of always plan to. Like, why not? We all love it. Okay. Like, why not have a pixel art series? I did a fun series on eight Bidoo, which actually did quite well for me in the real world. I didn't really sell many of the nfTs, but I sold actually a ton of the prints.
00:15:38.856 - 00:16:03.334, Speaker A: Maybe not a ton, but several. And there was a lot of interest. And there's actually more interest. I'll dig those up in a future episode because I don't have those actually handy. And otherwise, just to wrap up here, thanks to Roerich for picking up a copy of Bez. I'm making an addition of three. There's one left.
00:16:03.334 - 00:16:28.094, Speaker A: And we also sold yesterday a TR 909 sketch for 350. So I was really thrilled to get rid of one to sell to move this product again. Sales are the best thing ever. So thank you very much to random Gl. You see, I burned a bunch, so now it's an addition of three. So it's a little more collectible. I'm keeping one.
00:16:28.094 - 00:17:13.722, Speaker A: I realized I kind of want to keep one. If I'm doing an addition of more than one, I want one for myself, for whatever this collection is going to turn into. So there's one left on the market. If you are at TR 909 fan and you like kind of a little non finito pixel ish art for you, I'm using pixel art sketchbook in a very wide sense here. Basically, there's square brushes that I'm working with here, or these kind of rasterized brushes using pixel art software. It's a hell of a lot of fun. Anyway, before I go along, thank you once again for joining this week's episode, or today's episode.
00:17:13.722 - 00:17:18.114, Speaker A: And until next time, take care. Bye.
