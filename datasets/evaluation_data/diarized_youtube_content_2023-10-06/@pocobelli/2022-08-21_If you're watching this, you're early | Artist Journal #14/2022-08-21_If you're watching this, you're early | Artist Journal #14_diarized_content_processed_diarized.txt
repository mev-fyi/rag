00:00:03.080 - 00:00:41.904, Speaker A: Artist journal, August 21, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokobeli, your artist reporter. I'm back. Good morning, GM, wherever you are around the world. And welcome to the my artist journal, where these days I'm starting with the tezos ecosystem, as I call it. And I'm back to this idea that if you are here, if you are watching this, you, my friend, are early. And this is another case in point here.
00:00:41.904 - 00:01:14.618, Speaker A: So Sabato, who I bet a lot of you already know his work, he's the guy who's been doing these cool sort of corel draw pieces, which are super interesting. He put out a tweet on his actual process. I wonder if we can actually find that. Let's find that really quickly here. I made a fortune on these mfers here. That's kind of what's funded a lot of these buys on tazos. So I was just looking.
00:01:14.618 - 00:01:52.888, Speaker A: They've crashed really badly. I was like, oh, it's now time to go in now by fortune. I didn't actually make that much money, actually, but it has for tezos. It's a lot of money, considering what the arts going for Twitter pokebelly. And let's just do a very quick look on Sebato and let's call it Corel. See if we can find his tweets here. Latest does he puts out so many tweets, maybe we can't.
00:01:52.888 - 00:02:17.490, Speaker A: Oh, and that's why we can't find it, because he writes his name. Weird. Okay. But all to say, let's just try one last. Yeah, there's one of them, but we can't actually find maybe process. Here we go. We found it, and it is worth it.
00:02:17.490 - 00:02:47.494, Speaker A: So if you are curious about the process, the Coreldraw four format CDR embeds a rasterized thumbnail of a vector illustration. In every file, they are 88 by 88 bytes, with each byte corresponding to a color. This is the OG clipart thumbnail I started with. So you see how beautiful. He probably just puts a gondola into Corel, draw into some emulator, and then it creates this beautiful sort of rasterized image. And then we walk away. Then he adds his own.
00:02:47.494 - 00:03:17.194, Speaker A: He adds his own process to it, and we end up with that. So he's done really well. He's got what I almost want to call an iconic series here. I was lucky to pick up these one of ones for ten tezos. And again, like, he's doing things. He's pretty interesting artist. He's got this awesome series, which you've probably seen if you're on object, you know, these really cool works here.
00:03:17.194 - 00:03:35.424, Speaker A: So he's put out a lot of great stuff. He's got a lot of collectors. Look, buy for 115. I mean, that doesn't mean that's what this is worth, but it's probably worth, like, 20. Let's look at the last sale, just to give you. I'm just sort of setting the table here for what happened last night. Last sale, 22.
00:03:35.424 - 00:04:13.160, Speaker A: So nothing to be ashamed of here. 33 editions, and the lowest is 22. So last night, like, I'd been following this auction that he had on this glitch art sort of rom piece, one of one. And nobody bid on it except for me. With ten minutes left. Secret. If you want to maximize your odds of winning the auction, it resets at ten minutes every time you make a bid, if it's within the last ten minutes of the auction.
00:04:13.160 - 00:04:30.712, Speaker A: So I'll try and bid right at, like, ten minutes and 20 seconds. And so I did. And, yeah, there's nobody bid on it. And he was actually pretty thankful. I'm glad because he put out a tweet the day before that. I'm kind of sad is bidding on this. It's not cheap, but it's actually.
00:04:30.712 - 00:05:07.124, Speaker A: It is someone who's kind of got, from a collector's point of view, someone who's got a following, who is putting out a one of one. You know, pretty cool. Like, I mean, again, this is this kind of stuff you could put in a museum, and it'd be respectable at the very least, if not pretty cool. $80.50 tazos. Okay, so, as I've been saying, if you are watching this, you are early. And let me show a couple of other acquisitions from this morning.
00:05:07.124 - 00:05:29.388, Speaker A: A guy who I quite like this stippin pixel. And I must have missed the notifications, because I follow, like, 170 artists or whatever. Um, but stippin Pixel put out a bunch of. One of ones. These are five tazos. And actually, I was looking at. I picked up a couple.
00:05:29.388 - 00:05:50.284, Speaker A: I picked up this one and this yellow one. That's all that was left. And there's one left, and I think I'm gonna buy it. I have seven tazos, and what the hell? For $8, getting a one of one. Let me show you some of his or her. I don't know what it is. I assume stippin pixel one of their.
00:05:50.284 - 00:06:37.182, Speaker A: Show them some of their. Like, they did work for the trash series, and I thought it was some of the most original work that was done for the trash day, maybe, I don't know, three weeks ago. And he put people collecting trash, which I think is pretty smart take, and it fit with his style or her, whatever. And here's another one again, you know, just a really creative take in their style. And let's just look at some of the older work, too, because, again, these are still available editions of 15 for three tez. I mean, let's see how many are left. This is why I keep saying this.
00:06:37.182 - 00:07:10.884, Speaker A: If you're watching this here early, he's got nine left. He sold 23456 of them. Okay, so and so, yeah. And let me just show you some of the early work, which got me into him. He's got a bunch of these. You know, the effects hash can really screw up an artist's, like, being able to look at their work because you have to. You see how hard it is for me.
00:07:10.884 - 00:07:24.896, Speaker A: Let's just try one more page here. Here we go. This is what I was looking for. So we put out some really great works here. They're still cheap. Five editions of five, if you want some cool pixel art. These ones in particular, you see, I own this.
00:07:24.896 - 00:08:08.474, Speaker A: I think this is a great work. Again, stippin pixel. So, you see there's a consistent style here, which is always nice and pretty original, you know, employs the non finito, one of my favorite techniques, which we will go into in a future episode that deserves, like, a full look at the history. Same with, like, Rom, Nintendo glitch. Roms deserve their own sort of show, but we're just sort of exploring this one day at a time. Ten minutes at a time, really. This is my warm up for the day, where I show you what I've been looking at and thinking about and really setting the agenda for myself.
00:08:08.474 - 00:08:31.542, Speaker A: This is an artist's journal. So you see? Really cool. This looks like it was made with Microsoft paint or something. This looks like the airbrush tool over here. You just expand it, you know, limited color. He makes it look easy. Or she, whoever they are, stippin pixel makes it look easy over here.
00:08:31.542 - 00:08:56.282, Speaker A: So. But it's actually. It's quite smart, I would say. And the use of color, the use of the little sort of checkered area here, the contrast. Why didn't you put green in the tree? But it probably looks better that way. So, you know, there's a lot of decisions being made here that kind of make this look easy. And so.
00:08:56.282 - 00:09:14.162, Speaker A: Yeah, so there's a bunch of. One of ones here for $5. So I think I just picked up this last one here. Let's see. See if this. Yeah, owned one. So you see this little unboxing? I can't afford to do this forever.
00:09:14.162 - 00:09:55.576, Speaker A: The unboxing thing. See if it shows up. Yeah, there it is. So anyway. Okay, and then what else? Well, another kind of little tidbit, RJ, who you might remember if you watched the last episode. I basically bought like nine or ten rjs because I just think another hugely underrated artist, he hadn't posted anything in quite a while, and then he posted something yesterday. So you see the power of buying people's work that also, that can, as any artist who's watching this knows, when someone buys your work, it really can inspire you.
00:09:55.576 - 00:10:22.974, Speaker A: It goes, oh, I can do this. And people like my stuff. Like, people really underestimate the power of spending two tezos, or a tezos on someone's work. So I'm an artist and I get it. And I think that's kind of what we see here. And it's got a very promising title because RJ, I think, is one of the big talents. And he probably just feels like, because nobody was buying his work.
00:10:22.974 - 00:10:41.382, Speaker A: I mean, it was well priced, but nobody was buying his work. But this is a very promising title. Homecoming. So hopefully RJ is back in the mix. He sold out his edition of five, I was right on it, for five tezos each. So respectable amount. Here he's got the.
00:10:41.382 - 00:11:05.052, Speaker A: He's using video. It's always preferred gifts over mp4 s, but who cares? Is also what I would say. It'll still look good in the museum. Oh, look, Haiti Rockette. Oh, has just minted a piece, but it's probably from that new series. Anyways, that's always exciting. So maybe we'll see that before this show ends.
00:11:05.052 - 00:11:37.702, Speaker A: And so with that, that's basically the takeaway here, which is something we mentioned before, but a reminder, like, I got these. You know, this was a stipin pixel. I got, I mean, eight, $8, like five tazos for this pretty cool work by the stippin pixel. One of one. What are you spending on? Super rare for one of ones. And to me, these are, like, quite interesting works. Here is the other one.
00:11:37.702 - 00:12:05.214, Speaker A: And I'll show you this last piece by a new artist I just discovered who looked like they were making some waves. So, you know, just for $8, like, you can't really go wrong. Someone on Twitter was saying, you know, this is pretty much risk free art buying on tezos right now. So people are catching on. This was an interesting. This Mori Gatto guy who I don't know how I discovered. Maybe it was on Twitter.
00:12:05.214 - 00:12:17.478, Speaker A: I don't. This is like. He calls it a abstract mosaic. Pretty cool. I don't know if this is. I hope it's purely digital. It's always preferable.
00:12:17.478 - 00:12:38.698, Speaker A: I'm not a big fan of photos of physical works, but I bet this is digital. Some of his other work looked really interesting, too. These kind of. Look at this. Selling for 15 tezos. Pretty interesting kind of abstract digital work. So, yeah, so that's kind of what I'm noticing.
00:12:38.698 - 00:13:05.234, Speaker A: Made in Zurich by Mori Gatto JpEG first I generate, then I destroy. So that is the latest on the market here as far as what I am working on. I have just posted Bez. Bez is the official dancer, the happy Mondays. And these are just sketches. It's kind of my way. I'm going to turn this off just because maybe that flashing is freaking some people out.
00:13:05.234 - 00:13:46.550, Speaker A: Edition of three for two tazos. Bez was a. It's kind of becoming my experiments into narrative painting, which is basically, you know, painting, you know, still static paintings, although this last one wasn't, but static paintings. This is what I'd call narrative painting. You know, italian painting, I'd consider narrative painting. I am doing experiments, basically with these right now with these nineties ravers sort of scenes, just to kind of get warmed up, take some of these famous images, start to recontextualize them. Here's Jeff Mills on a, you know, observation deck with Mars in the background with.
00:13:46.550 - 00:14:06.662, Speaker A: Anybody that knows Jeff Mills will appreciate that one man spaceship. And I've done, actually, quite a lot of burning here. So things are getting reduced. You actually can't buy this sketch anymore. There are a few of these sketches available. So, yeah, working on that. Working on the screen Memories series.
00:14:06.662 - 00:14:30.506, Speaker A: Let me see if I have that. And. Yeah, so let me see. Just get this out. Here we go. And so, working on a new screen memory here, let me do this right, so we're having a lot of fun with these. I love this.
00:14:30.506 - 00:14:58.934, Speaker A: I love this series. And, yeah, so that is the update. So we just continue plugging along here with our sketches. Screen memories, all of it. We're uploading peloponnesian war to super rare because ETH gas fees. Let's just take a look at ETH gas fees here very quickly are pretty cheap when they go below, when they're basically five or below, I'll mint because it costs about $7. So quick tip there, if you are minting on Ethereum.
00:14:58.934 - 00:15:08.494, Speaker A: And with that, that is this week's episode or this is today's episode. I wish you good luck in your creative activity, and I will see you next time.
