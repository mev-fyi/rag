00:00:04.760 - 00:00:27.158, Speaker A: I love this image, this image of this horse riding free, running as fast as it can. This is a picture of you and me, my friends. This is a picture of this show. This is a picture of all of us in our artistic pursuits. Run before they catch you and put a saddle on you and a bridle. Just run. Freedom, my friends.
00:00:27.158 - 00:00:55.478, Speaker A: Just keep running. Silva Santus Artist journal, July 14, 2023. Broadcasting from the river in my mind in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and this is just one of those works that I think I liked it before I saw it in the sense that my unconscious. I just, you know, sometimes works hit you just immediately. It's almost reptilian. And this was one of those works.
00:00:55.478 - 00:01:16.430, Speaker A: It just kind of hit. And then the more I understood it within the first, you know, one and a half seconds, the more I just had to see if it was still available. It was on secondary. I managed to pick one up for four tazos. It's just one of those beautiful, simple, simple works here. Beautifully glitched out again. Clearly a Nintendo glitch rom.
00:01:16.430 - 00:01:51.222, Speaker A: We're back to video games, aren't we? We are back to video games here with that beautiful kind of dithered shadow on the. On the horse. Just beautiful. And really nicely glitched here and everything. And there's something about it. I mean, we've seen this with Silva sand twos before, doing kind of using the glitch rom as an opportunity to, like, you know, make beautiful landscapes, for example, and just kind of heartwarming scenes. Here's another one, you know, with this, again, this horse that's just trotting, running free, and you just have to love it.
00:01:51.222 - 00:02:02.766, Speaker A: Now it's 22 tezos. Maybe you put an offer in to get it cheaper. Water horse. Love the title here. Need more glitch. And 88 frames here. Yeah.
00:02:02.766 - 00:02:19.782, Speaker A: Dernadler got the last one at four tezos. Yeah, I picked one up at three, actually. That's great. And two tezos on primary and someone listed right away at 48. That's hilarious. It actually took, you know, 12 hours for this to sell, but I think it was one of those works. Again, 22 works here.
00:02:19.782 - 00:02:45.064, Speaker A: So Silva Sand II continues to grow here and develop really nicely here. Some works just hit, as I like to say. And this is one of those works here. And, yes, I enjoyed that. A lot of comments on yesterday's show, and thank you for the comments. Thank you for the interest. And, yeah, I went to the gym earlier yesterday morning, and I biked to the gym and back.
00:02:45.064 - 00:03:04.008, Speaker A: So I think my brain was in like full form on that day because, yeah, I felt like it was. We got a great response. Let's just put it that way. Slime brand. I enjoy that. At one time, pixel art was the cutting edge of technology, pushing the boundaries of what we thought possible. And this is super interesting.
00:03:04.008 - 00:03:54.044, Speaker A: I actually did a very quick search on when did Pixel art begin? In chat GPT four. And it's back to the video games. So this video game thesis, which I think a lot of you have been actually way ahead of me on, but it continues to. The evidence continues to accumulate here. Pixel art as we know it today started to appear with the advent of computer and video game consoles in the late seventies and early eighties. Early computers and gaming consoles had very limited graphical capabilities, and this was part of the charm, wasn't it? Which meant that artists working on games and other software had to make do with a limited number of pixels and a limited color palette. This led to the creation of the distinctive blocky style that we now associate with pixel art.
00:03:54.044 - 00:04:24.624, Speaker A: I mean, you gotta give chat GPT credit, it's a pretty excellent summary here. It's worth noting, however, that the idea of creating images from small, discrete units dates back much further than the digital age. We could they bring mosaics, for example. Mosaics, which can be seen as a kind of analog precursor to pixel art, have been. This is an excellent summary. Have been a part of human art and architecture for thousands of years. And if you've never been to Ravenna in Italy, it is actually a UNESCO site.
00:04:24.624 - 00:05:03.466, Speaker A: There are actually several UNESCO sites in Ravenna. It is actually a must see. And you'll see some of the best, if not the best, mosaics in the world. Among the best. The fundamental concept behind pixel art, the creation of larger images from smaller discrete units, is a very ancient one. And again, you also think of Seurat, the impressionist, or post impressionist, and with divisionism, when George Seurat, you know, was trying to put these little points of light, they're trying to be scientific, I might add, and let the eye blend in the colors together. So that is interesting as well.
00:05:03.466 - 00:05:46.574, Speaker A: Let's just finish this. Despite its root in the technical limitations of early hardware, pixel art has endured as an art form even as those limitations have disappeared. Many artists continue to create pixel art today because they enjoy the aesthetic or the challenge of working within self imposed limitations, not because they have to. What an excellent summary. And I laughed when I read that slimebrand rune tune with some excellent commentary here. If you recall, our spaces with Hasdrubal. I remember saying that his work reminded me of video game aesthetics, pixels, colors, and that one of the reasons I like video games as a child, and Hasdrubal's artwork now was simply for the aesthetic experience.
00:05:46.574 - 00:06:22.146, Speaker A: Agreed. The games themselves were fun, but what attracted me most was the visual, and I completely relate to this. Again, the Ultima three and Ultima four. Again, I call Ultima four a early masterpiece of digital art that probably came out, I'm guessing, 1980, 419 85. And that's why I still care about it, because I've gone back and tried to play some of these games with that kind of nostalgia and thinking I'm going to recapture something. But it's the visuals that ultimately, the gameplay, you know, it's kind of. It's kind of.
00:06:22.146 - 00:06:59.002, Speaker A: I don't want to call it tedious, but it's a little long, especially for what we're used to here. But the visuals continue to inspire. Outside of certain cartoons, there was no other place to get those kinds of colors. And back to the color issue, which we've brought up here. Even with comics, you couldn't achieve those colors because comics existed in print, and only through the digital screen can you get the intensity of light required for those highlights and saturated colors. And this is a profoundly important point, and we brought this up before, and it's just a very important. And actually, and runetune hits the nail on the head here.
00:06:59.002 - 00:07:50.822, Speaker A: Digital is like the new oil paint, where the most vivid colors our eyes can experience exist. And I am 120% in agreement with this. I would argue one of the reasons why oil paint has such a prestigious place in human knowledge, for lack of better term, human culture, is the fact that it has some of the most saturated colors that we experience. And you could argue, and I think we've brought this up before, but Runetun brings it up beautifully here, that digital is the most saturated color that we're experiencing since oil paint, basically, and probably surpassing, when you put one of those screens, like an iPhone screen, at full capacity. It's probably brighter, which is interesting. It's made of light. I mean, it's lit by light, at the backlit by light.
00:07:50.822 - 00:08:17.926, Speaker A: I have to add to this, too. We could dedicate a whole discussion on this topic that those early video games didn't come into the scene presenting as art. A very important point. And yes, so perception and consumption changes once something presents as art. Video games present as entertainment, excellent points. They're immersive, and I mean, this is a great essay that Rune Toon is writing here. They're immersed like, I mean, this literally could be a post on medium.
00:08:17.926 - 00:08:49.306, Speaker A: They're immersive and collaborative and engaging in ways art is not. Comics require drawing, and we relate to drawing, and we relate drawing to art. Think about all those 2021 bull Run PFP projects that promised utility through a video game. There is texture here that we ought to touch on. Yes, we definitely do. And we should have a spaces on video games and art. At some point next week is, if everything goes according to plan, unknown collector will be showing up.
00:08:49.306 - 00:09:40.794, Speaker A: So that is one a lot of people might want to check out, if not just to introduce yourself to a big collector. Talking Haiti Rockette. The unifying quality with pixel art is the video game. Again, pixel art, as you call it, second generation digital art coming out of video games is a response to a common experience we all have. Much like any art movement, it is not one, but many artists responding to something that gives the movement a theme, a voice, a conversation. Yeah, it's almost back to this idea of the furniture, of the mind, the, you know, the everyday, the contents of our visual lives, just as the pop artists, as I think rune tune is going to point out here, pop art was a movement born of artists responding to consumer culture. And also, I would, and I'd add to that, and maybe it's a subset of this is graphic design.
00:09:40.794 - 00:10:23.774, Speaker A: You know, in a lot of ways, you could say Warhol, who was a graphic designer, was celebrating the beauty of graphic design. And again, this was coming out at a time when abstract expressionism was high art and all the rage, and all of a sudden, graphic design was this low art. And you could see a similar analogy with video games. You know, how dare you call video games high art? But, you know, appropriated and transformed in the right way. Why not? Maybe it's a really powerful kind of art. There was a lot to unpack with consumer culture in post war America. Artists like Warhol began to treat art in the same way that commodities were manufactured and marketed.
00:10:23.774 - 00:11:40.454, Speaker A: So fascinating comments here from runetune. Yeah, a lot of food for thought here. And, you know, I personally, I mean, just sharing, you know, coffee thoughts out loud here, and nobody needs to agree with me, but in my mind, what's going on here in this, what we might term second generation of digital art, is, to me, it's the most exciting art movement since pop art. And I think it's kind of significant that you're bringing up pop art here because it's kind of dealing with our everyday lives. And perhaps like, I mean, and we're painting with a broad brush and over generalizing here, but a lot of what art seems to have missed in the last, let's say, three or four decades is art that we relate to that that kind of speaks about our lives and kind of represents us in a weird way. You could argue the contemporary art world kind of ran away with itself and its own ego and, you know, and kind of just became, what is the word? Solipsistic. Solipsistic, which just kind of self involved and not so much about, you know, speaking for the people to a certain degree or for the general subjectivity of the age.
00:11:40.454 - 00:11:54.482, Speaker A: Continuing on. Rosatio. I love it. Visual art underground. It's funny, I've never, it's amazing. I've never mentioned this before because I've actually been describing the show as that for months, which is hilarious, and I love that too. I'm sure that will make a return.
00:11:54.482 - 00:12:11.410, Speaker A: Thanks for featuring my artwork. Once again, I was not taking the summer break. It's winter here in Australia. It's so easy for us to forget in the northern hemisphere. I was just doing another job and it's quite busy, but I'm back gradually, making time to create more work. We'll have a group show with super chief in no time. So that is exciting.
00:12:11.410 - 00:12:40.234, Speaker A: So congratulations. Rosato, thank you for the comment. And Dijochiro, thank you for showing my artworks. I couldn't figure out what to call it, so I went with purpy since it was purple. And finally, we don't have time for all of Bull's comment here, but I read everything, and there was here another thing in my mind is the fact that one can forget that video games are tightly bonded to a utility interaction, interactive experience, whose objective is to entertain. So back to this idea. Video games are entertainment.
00:12:40.234 - 00:13:23.394, Speaker A: So how does it fit within the context of art? I believe this has kept hidden the fact that video game graphics are, in fact, an art form. And again, I'm kind of back to this idea of the pop artists celebrating graphic design. It's basically the same thing. The graphic design was not intended to be, quote unquote high art, but it's kind of the same thing with these video game graphics. And all of a sudden the artists are going, hey, they're starting to mine this material, you know, developed by actual artists. I feel like the utility side of video games have kept them off to be considered an art form. And I love how in this ecosystems, artists are making us look again, decontextualizing the video game image.
00:13:23.394 - 00:13:58.428, Speaker A: Beautiful line there from its natural, utility driven environment, which sometimes made its beauty a little less visible to make us realize that the things have always been quite beautiful. Also, this new wave of art collectors have grown up with video games. It's a nostalgia driven, revindicating recipe for success. Also, I love your proposition of considering the influence of video games as maybe a turning point, considering digital art. Certainly it gives thoughts, material. And finally, finally, a thing about the market. I believe it's awesome.
00:13:58.428 - 00:14:32.994, Speaker A: Even with its sometimes bad actors and stuff, it keeps blowing my mind, the fact that one can mint a piece and instantly get feedback, a returning echo from someone else. I find this to be a very positive thing, and I totally agree. And I think it's making us all stronger as artists, because sometimes it can be brutal. I mean, you put a workout, it barely sells or doesn't sell at all. And. But what's good is, is we're subjecting ourselves to the brutality of a free market, and that ultimately makes us stronger, I would argue. And I think it actually leads to better results.
00:14:32.994 - 00:15:13.266, Speaker A: I think it helps us understand, it helps us question our own assumptions and we get feedback right away. Whereas you can be working in your studio again for years. Show here and there, maybe one sale here, you're not sure if it's because the person knew you and everything. So to me, the market side, the economics of this scene may be actually the engine. It may be the engine that gives us an enormous advantage over any scene that's not as free market. And this is just pure free market. So that could give us a huge advantage.
00:15:13.266 - 00:15:41.598, Speaker A: And we see it every day. I mean, I put this show out four days a week, and it's usually like 40 minutes to an hour of new art that's coming out in the last 24 to 48 hours for the most part. So one wonders if there's a connection there. I myself know I have made my experimental video pieces to never be seen by anyone. To never be seen by anyone. Once uploaded to my forgotten YouTube channel, we've all been there. Ended up deleting or hiding most of them.
00:15:41.598 - 00:16:02.654, Speaker A: And I feel this is the case for many artists. There was just no feedback to some people. Someone willing to pay $3, $3 for a piece they made is their first experience of selling something they have created. It's empowering and it keeps the motivation going. And finally, I just want to read this quote here. Quote. While making art, take care of the quantity and let God take care of the quality.
00:16:02.654 - 00:17:01.734, Speaker A: This is an awesome quote here. Again, one of the great lessons I learned, it was a copernican revolution in my art making was quantity over quality, which sounds totally, you know, sacrilegious even to me, to say it now. And it's like, should I be saying this in public? But as an artist, it's more important that you're constantly producing. And I'd argue the best artists do this to be constantly producing than trying to be a perfectionist with your art. I mean, you want a standard, but you don't want to be a perfectionist where you never release anything. Quantity has a quality of its own, as some people say. And I think, I mean, there's so much great stuff in here, so let's just leave it at that if you want to read more.
00:17:01.734 - 00:17:28.656, Speaker A: And thank you, Jonathan. The opening figures are earthlings under the silurian hypothesis, intelligent dinosaurs from Sid and Marty's sleek stack, land of the lost. So I have no idea what any of that means, but it seems to have to do with the opening figures in the Kujeb work from yesterday. So thank you. I'm sure someone out there will understand all of these references that I should probably know. Thank you, Jonathan. Great to hear from you again.
00:17:28.656 - 00:17:48.380, Speaker A: And thank you, rada. Primitive intel and dikenagoy 619. I wasn't quite sure what the comment meant, but I gave it a like there was continuing on. Look at this. So gogolite us made this work basically for hdtv resolution. And check this out. One of my collectors sent me this.
00:17:48.380 - 00:18:14.588, Speaker A: It's fabulous to see my pixel art on a token frame. Thank you so much. Sci-fi hi. And look at that. So, I mean, it really, like, you think of these rich places in Hollywood, these actors homes, and you really want to kind of impress your guests. I mean, here's a way I like. I mean, and first of all, they'll know.
00:18:14.588 - 00:18:32.354, Speaker A: They'll have never seen the art before, probably. And then it's, like, beautiful on top of it. And, I mean, the whole thing, I mean, it's just kind of blow people's minds. So, I mean, fascinating. So just great to see that. This is quite fascinating, too. So, happy birthday, mid journey.
00:18:32.354 - 00:19:10.138, Speaker A: So I'm not sure if it's midjourney's birthday today. I mean, that would be pretty mind blowing. I mean, it's only July, remember? I think AI, we had maybe a little bit, but I think strange thing was at the end of August, beginning of September last year, that thug lord piece, that beautiful work. So, I mean, it feels like forever, but. So this is a year ago, and this is now. So pretty interesting. I'm not sure if that's the same prompt, but all to say, mid journey is young, and it's pretty incredible the strides it is making so far.
00:19:10.138 - 00:19:27.334, Speaker A: Look at this. So one bit necro has been active on Twitter here, which is super interesting. And this one was great. Hand drawn 3d pixel art. One bit 2019 ink on paper fallen in wasted youth. Nothing is the same. And so look at this.
00:19:27.334 - 00:19:55.012, Speaker A: So this is ink on paper. And you gotta love, almost like, I was gonna say the mistakes, but these are actually little pixels here. So just really beautifully done. I'd love to see this in person. And it also got me thinking, you know, should really use some graph paper to make some, you know, one bit pixel art. I think I actually want to make a series of just black and white, one bit art. There's something kind of beautiful and interesting about it.
00:19:55.012 - 00:20:10.024, Speaker A: Anyway, this is a beautiful one. And you see. And physically rendered here by one bit necro. Really, really interesting artist here. Just a wild. There's the flowers and everything. Just a super cool artist here.
00:20:10.024 - 00:20:44.968, Speaker A: Yeah. I'll check out one bit necro's feed Dan control with showing us a work in progress, basically showing us the outlines, a little bit of the process that Dan works on. So, first, doing all the outlines, and there's a lot of things you can do with these outlines, not just the gradients, but. So another cool medieval work here from Dancontrol. And the work is released here. And you gotta love that structure here on top. I mean, that is maybe my favorite part here, is the structure.
00:20:44.968 - 00:21:10.132, Speaker A: It's got a real medieval feel to it, doesn't it? Just really beautiful. And just how these tiles here, I mean, they look like tiles. They're beautiful. And then you have this medieval scene of what look like two armies facing off against each other and all these swords, the repetition that Dan control likes to do and everything. So just a really, really, really cool piece. It's pretty reasonably priced. 0.35
00:21:10.132 - 00:21:25.612, Speaker A: ETH. ETH is going up in price, though, so fun times in the crypto markets there. Cool work from Dan Control Gozo, who we've looked at. This came out a week ago. I missed this. This is a really colorful work. Again, kind of, there's a.
00:21:25.612 - 00:21:49.704, Speaker A: It's kind of like a surreal still life, these kind of animated still lifes. Really nicely colored here, I might add, and just really beautiful. And you see the water here, which is a really nice addition here. Just so, just super interesting and kind of, again, has a surreal feeling. This looks like a big tooth here. And just random objects. What is this called? Veil.
00:21:49.704 - 00:22:11.962, Speaker A: And I guess there is the veil with a beautiful color coming in here. Really just kind of preciously done by Gozo. Now it's 120 on secondary. Let's just see how much it cost on primary. All accepted offers at 50 to 40 tezos. So again, Gozo has their collectors. Just very cool.
00:22:11.962 - 00:22:26.740, Speaker A: And look who this is. Tornado Rodriguez with a new one. Riki. Riki. This is on Solana, where Tornado has released a few works. So a little bit of paraphernalia here and just a really cool drawing. Really expertly done.
00:22:26.740 - 00:22:46.864, Speaker A: And you gotta love the, how its color outlines here, not black outlines everywhere here. It's, you know, light blue outlines and just everything. Just beautifully done. And her characters, the buds there and everything. Just a beautiful work. And there's all the characters, they all have their personality in there. Pretty hilarious.
00:22:46.864 - 00:22:58.594, Speaker A: For $420, the day will come when we find it on the racks. Sticky and delicious. Reeky. Reeky. It's happening more and more, as many of us have seen. And so 0.35 solved.
00:22:58.594 - 00:23:08.338, Speaker A: $10.08 left. So big shout out to tornado. And here is actually. So this was another one. I think we missed this one. We saw this one here.
00:23:08.338 - 00:23:24.634, Speaker A: This one was totally awesome. I think we might have even started the show with that work here. So here's tornado's work on Solana. So Solana is going up. Get them while you can, because it's getting more expensive to buy everything. Spontr with the cool work here. Red button.
00:23:24.634 - 00:23:44.822, Speaker A: The undeniable call of a red button. When will humans learn to mind their own business? Please press the button to find out. So Spontor making another just interesting kind of semi Sci-Fi work here. Illustration. And just a cool machine and a red button. And I love it. The psychological kind of nature of the red button.
00:23:44.822 - 00:24:06.654, Speaker A: The attraction of the red button. What happens if I press it? Beautiful drawing and beautifully colored. I might add five tezos edition of 25. And that's all. They're all sold for a dollar. So you got to love how Spontr is keeping it really cheap on primary. And so it's a good way to sell out, is keep it really cheap.
00:24:06.654 - 00:24:26.838, Speaker A: Some cool. A couple of cool. More mythological figures here. More mythological figures that I've never seen. I mean, it looks like Bigfoot with a bow and arrow here from Daniel W. So really cool piece here. And you got to like this whole kind of, you know, outline here of where the figure is coming into.
00:24:26.838 - 00:24:44.656, Speaker A: Just really really nicely done from Daniel W, available for nine tezos on secondary. Only one left. So popular work here. And yeah, object is super slow for me. Here's another. Just beautiful one, elegos. This is number 15 in the series.
00:24:44.656 - 00:25:14.064, Speaker A: Again, I've never recognized any of these characters. And you wonder if Daniel W is, you know, making them up on his own, combining different aspects. I'm not sure, but very cool. I mean, the skeleton of a horse here with this figure on it, this hooded figure and a flag and almost like that medical snake that comes up. Just really interesting. From Daniel W, available for nine tezos on secondary. So these are doing very well.
00:25:14.064 - 00:25:29.788, Speaker A: And let's just see here. Edition of 35. So great work from Daniel W. More from Mika Oladev. This glitch artist who we have recently discovered here is putting out a ton of work. And it's all pretty interesting, I have to say. So these portraits.
00:25:29.788 - 00:25:42.748, Speaker A: Artifact number five. So we started looking at some of these artifacts earlier. Here's number seven. One of one. So again, just interesting glitches here. And this sold for 35 tezos. Not a bad price.
00:25:42.748 - 00:26:03.964, Speaker A: Pretty reasonable. And here's another one. Again, just kind of, you wonder if it's like frames of a video or what it is, but it's cool. 5000 pixels by 5000 pixels again. And this sold for 35 tezos. And so, I mean, if Mika Oladev, I'm not sure if. If they've been making glitch art for a while.
00:26:03.964 - 00:26:34.036, Speaker A: To pick up one of ones for 35 is a pretty good, pretty good value for collectors here. Here's popple with some bacon. Bacon for robots. So having fun over here. And popple continues to get a ton of views. 12,000 on this one and just a cool kind of processing of bacon here. And continuing on, demon ego with some beautiful digital work here with some really nice dithering in the background.
00:26:34.036 - 00:27:03.778, Speaker A: And kind of a mysterious work here. And we see that what looks like a kind of snake figure all along the side here in different kind of positions. This black and white work in the middle with what looks like someone almost being kind of sent upwards here into this structure. You almost want to think it's an alien invasion, but it doesn't really look like a UFO. And then some interesting, kinda. So just really interesting, mysterious work. And look at the eyes over here.
00:27:03.778 - 00:27:19.858, Speaker A: And again, it's kind of pulsating a little bit. Everything was better the day after they arrived. So it does have that alien sort of feel to it. Edition of ten for ten tezos. And maybe they are sold out. There are two left from demon ego. Really nice work.
00:27:19.858 - 00:27:32.976, Speaker A: And a new one from figments. Already 25 tezos root. One plus one equals one. I love. I love that. There is a song. There is a Goa trance track called one plus one equals one.
00:27:32.976 - 00:27:46.864, Speaker A: I think that was by Seba. C E I B A. That's. They were at Burning man. Back before Burning man was kind of. It was like the 97. They'd have, like, the big Goa stage at Burning Man.
00:27:46.864 - 00:28:21.394, Speaker A: I never went back then. A guy in a van, actually, who owned a record store in Saskatoon, invited me. But, yeah, there's no way I was gonna be able to make it all the way over there anyway. Figments with a new work. Again, our kind of figure here, made of light, who represents, according to Kappan, or figments, the soul or consciousness in this beautiful, you know, pac man esque square here. And again, these kind of just cool metaphysical works. Pixel artworks that seem to be somewhat about our relationship with technology.
00:28:21.394 - 00:28:41.914, Speaker A: On in a certain way. Like, even probably Kappn or figments is probably wondering what these are about as well. Like, and you gotta love the RGB over here, which we saw in, I think, the last work. So now it's. It was available for, I believe, ten tezos on primary. Sold out within a minute. Two minutes.
00:28:41.914 - 00:28:59.782, Speaker A: That is amazing. And now only an addition of twelve. Now 25 on secondary. And also pixels, who is also Kappn, released a few of these biological works here. One of ones, I picked up a couple. There are five tezos. I thought, why not for a one of one, I didn't have any.
00:28:59.782 - 00:29:22.506, Speaker A: And here, just beautiful kind of pixel Artwork here with a biological feel to it by Kappan. And here is another one. And I'm not sure what these words mean. This is a nice. I mean, they all have their different quality to them, don't they? So, very cool work here, pixels. Multipixular organisms. So, again, kind of a biological theme.
00:29:22.506 - 00:29:47.454, Speaker A: Pamelo Cerrone with pinche pinche. And again, just playing with gifs and large scale pixels here. So just another kind of fun work here from Pamelo. I'm not sure if this PixElAtiON thing is a NeWEr Development from the last couple of months. A one of one. And let's just see if it's sold. ObJect is killing me here.
00:29:47.454 - 00:30:28.612, Speaker A: We'll see if we can come back to that in a second here. And check out this. Another beautiful ROM work. More video game reference. This time from floss, was Gamma. Look at how Original this is. ReaLLY playing with what I'd call the Aesthetics of ROm gaming, Nintendo Rom Glitch, you know, and we saw this with Haiti Rockette as well, which is, you know, where sometimes there'd be, like, the plane on the aircraft carrier, and it would just be a slight flash of maybe the cockpit just kind of going, you know, flashing lighter and darker, you know, and it brings up questions of the aesthetics of, like, what makes an artwork, you know, and I think it's really interesting.
00:30:28.612 - 00:30:46.594, Speaker A: We're seeing that same. I feel either consciously or unconsciously, we're seeing the same kind of questions being raised here into what makes, you know, an artwork and what can be beautiful. I think she's doing a beautiful job here. So edition of eleven. There's only five left. The market likes it, too. This was just released.
00:30:46.594 - 00:31:27.974, Speaker A: I need to get one while I can detour with a one of one territory hero raid arrangements and appropriation of a digital space. So cool work here by Datura, as usual, with these really big, almost slightly distorted pixels and just really nice color and just super interesting and not listed yet. Just minted another one from not a number here. So you're getting more complex, these gradients here. And this is the great thing about doing series and exploring a subject is, you know, things evolve. And we're seeing that here with little structures are starting to appear in these. I think 16 by nine works here.
00:31:27.974 - 00:31:41.818, Speaker A: So probably sold already. Yeah, for five tezos, two rosatio. So these continue to sell. I really wish I could have picked up the first one. It wouldn't let me buy it. Agrippa edition of ten. And this is called number five.
00:31:41.818 - 00:32:06.628, Speaker A: So just kind of an interesting work here. I think it was in Popple's Twitter feed that I saw this retweeted. Just kind of an interesting pixel art, you know, abstraction. And so I went to Agrippa's page here, and I was expecting to find more. It looks like kind of a newer development here, so I hope to see more pixel art stuff. This is really cool. And just original Agrippa.
00:32:06.628 - 00:32:31.052, Speaker A: And bite by bit with a couple of more of these black and white. One bit works here, done on pc paint, these abstracts, they're selling for nine tazos. I picked up a couple of them, and I just think they're super interesting here. Again, these look like the mountains and Ultima four. This also looks like a bit of a, you know, ultima, almost like the water a little bit. So probably a lot of this pixel art. I mean, there's only so many combinations.
00:32:31.052 - 00:32:52.100, Speaker A: It's all going to start to look a little bit like each other. Here's another one. Seems to be going with three letters in the title as a kind of theme. And here you have bricks and everything. Again, you see Ultima here, but it may be totally accidental. It's probably more my own references here. So just interesting abstracts from bite by bit.
00:32:52.100 - 00:33:12.678, Speaker A: And they're really reasonably priced for one of one's nine tazos. So I bought two of them. Yeah. And three more were released. I bought two of them because I bought the first, and I thought that was great. But then I thought, you know, in the gallery, in my mind, I kind of want a wall with two of these on it, and that will complete it. Ken, I get myself in a lot of trouble doing that sort of thing.
00:33:12.678 - 00:33:52.250, Speaker A: Just thinking about completing the room, and I justify a lot of purchases that way. Mandal with an interesting work here. Meow workspace. So kind of an interesting self referential work. Kind of looks like maybe aseprite, but a very simplified version of it, interestingly. And then you have one of these kind of. You know, if you've ever bought a model of, like, what is it? Revelo, is that the name of the company that does, like, the plane models and the ship models that you can make the miniature ships? Well, this is often how they're presented, which is the stuff is kind of.
00:33:52.250 - 00:34:26.550, Speaker A: You twist it off, basically. And here it seems like Mandal is using that as a, you know, a UI or a way of a compositional device of sorts. So very cool here, edition of 100 again, going with the aubergine theme that has been going all week here. Edition of 100 for only a Tezos. 50 cool pixel artwork. So, look at mo shit with this really experimental work. Here, again, has a kind of a video game feeling to it with the characters and just really kind of glitched out here.
00:34:26.550 - 00:34:41.962, Speaker A: This is a one of one, and I believe it was 25 tazos, I thought a really original work here. A lot of experimentation and everything. Oh, it sold. It has sold to August ground. Shout out to August. Accepted offer of 13. Yeah, I think it's a pretty cool work.
00:34:41.962 - 00:34:58.874, Speaker A: Be happy. Here's another one by Mo. Cool thing and more interesting experimentation. Like, we're seeing things that I'm not seeing elsewhere. A lot of these kind of interesting distorted repetitions. And you see how the time is. Again, we're back to video games here.
00:34:58.874 - 00:35:12.318, Speaker A: The snowboarding video game, just in this gif loop. Really interesting. From this one's only ten tazos. It's still available on object. And then DJ Curo. I missed this. This is from last week.
00:35:12.318 - 00:35:36.424, Speaker A: This is for Tezos edition of ten and on secondary but still pretty reasonable price. This is a pretty good looking work here. Just a nice kind of glitch here. What looks like an anime. So just cool work. Again from DJ Kuro and not sure what the crazy writing here and everything, just cool work. And Martin Joe, the aubergine trader.
00:35:36.424 - 00:36:09.864, Speaker A: So continuing with the aubergine thing and I laughed when I heard this music. It's like off key piano music. So Martin Joe has a pretty good sense of humor. Also out of Argentina, uses a lot of AI and again, going with the aubergine theme, also does the kinky bears and everything. I think me and Joe Rogan's dad was in a movie poster a few months ago from Martin Joe. Anyways, big shout out to Martin Joe. Buy now for three tezos and there are 29 left.
00:36:09.864 - 00:36:32.258, Speaker A: And going into AI here, Marina Amadova with a really cool kind of composition here. Lavender Twilight edition of one for 65 tezos. Pretty nice piece here. A nice kind of portrait. Kind of has almost a 19th century feel. Almost like the pre Raphaelites, just a little bit kind of feel to it, but just its own thing too. At the same time.
00:36:32.258 - 00:36:57.954, Speaker A: Just really nice AI work from Marina Amidova. And shout out again to ahack who pointed out this artist. We looked at one of the works and here's another one which this Tim Lehan guy daymare. Again, this is physical, by the way. You can see it here, like torn paper, really beautifully done. And it's all like blue. So I'm not exactly sure how this is done.
00:36:57.954 - 00:37:28.344, Speaker A: Like it goes right to the edge here. So maybe it's blue paper with white on top. It's hard to tell. Or actually probably what happens is there's probably a mask here and then it's just all painted over top, right to the edge. So probably the blue comes after really beautiful contrast here between almost like these marquee tool style selections, like Lorna Mills and then that hard edge and then the soft spray paint. Huge, huge contrast. That's why it looks so beautiful.
00:37:28.344 - 00:37:52.602, Speaker A: Another interesting work on Instagram here. Fantasian had the pleasure of making an artwork for my dearest friend's wedding while highlighting my current obsession with 18th century Dutch East Indies aesthetics. Wishing you a lifetime of happiness. So beautiful work here. So here's the marriage couple and there's the cat. I love it. And look at this.
00:37:52.602 - 00:38:17.170, Speaker A: I mean, it is beautiful. So I mean, a little bit of appropriation but then kind of turned into, you know, personalizing it, putting people you know, in here, probably changing a lot of things. Really, really beautiful work here. So, yeah, is this the source material? Interesting. I mean, then it's like, yeah, a lot of creativity in there. And look at that. So I never even saw that.
00:38:17.170 - 00:38:43.728, Speaker A: So very cool there. And then look at this. So night gallery is a pretty prominent contemporary art gallery, if you've never heard it. Andy Wall, who I've never heard of, is included in a two person exhibition, sign of equestrian with Sarah Miska at Cici Andradex in Mallorca, Spain. And it opens tomorrow. So I just thought this was a pretty cool, nice, kind of minimal, beautifully painted horse here. And just a really beautiful painting.
00:38:43.728 - 00:39:02.644, Speaker A: Even, like, the background there, how the red kind of fades in. Just kind of expertly painted here. Again, the background is really flat. Then these huge textured brushstrokes contrast with that of the horse. And look at that. So beautifully done. So AI, I mean, I think AI brush strokes, hilariously, as I look at this.
00:39:02.644 - 00:39:21.984, Speaker A: Look at that. So it reminds me of white solitude, those beautiful brushstrokes. So the competition between physical world and digital continues, at least in my mind. Look at this. This is a physical work here. Ashley Browndurand Instagram late summer flowers. I thought this was pretty interesting.
00:39:21.984 - 00:39:54.956, Speaker A: Figs from plums, who I just saw this on Twitter, highlighting excellence in art and design. Well, let's just make sure that is followed there. And there we go. And so cool work. Nice. What I like about it is how inexact it is, because again, we're dealing with this geometric digital perfection. So when you start to put things in the physical world, it's the imperfection that kind of makes it look interesting, right? If this was all perfect, it'd probably be a lot less interesting, but here you go.
00:39:54.956 - 00:40:24.948, Speaker A: This is quite interesting. And finally, Yoao Salazar, work in progress. So this looks like plasticine. And so very cool, fun, colorful work here from Yoao. And just all the fun stuff here, the windows, kind of 95 background there, skull, beautiful colors, little computer chair, the iconography, Internet iconography. I love it. So great to see that from Yoao.
00:40:24.948 - 00:40:32.464, Speaker A: And that is your show, everybody. Thank you for joining me again, and thank you for all the comments and the support. Hope you have a wonderful weekend. Until next time, take care.
