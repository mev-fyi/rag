00:00:03.240 - 00:00:27.610, Speaker A: My first words of the day to you, my friends, is we look on a cloudy landscape here on the high seas of the imagination. We have staved off an attack from yesterday and now we have calm seas as we sail forward. After stopping by the island of Sicily between Scylla and Shabridis. Shabridis. We'll look it up. I should really know that. Welcome back.
00:00:27.610 - 00:00:56.680, Speaker A: Artist Journal, November 14, 2023, broadcasting from the year 2600 in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and here we have feels. Let me put feels full screen. Here we have feels really cool work. I think it came out maybe on Friday. So this kind of escaped me till recently. I think lB retweeted it as I was looking at there's a really cool Elbie work, actually that would go fabulously with this.
00:00:56.680 - 00:01:20.264, Speaker A: You almost wonder if Elbie was influenced. Probably not. It probably came out at the same time. There's all sorts of stuff that happens out here, but really cool. I guess I'd call this an animated abstract. An animated abstract. And what is there to like? First of all, it's minted on super rare, just FYI, and feels, I think I know, feels art, mostly from Tezos.
00:01:20.264 - 00:02:07.904, Speaker A: And that's where I discovered feels, I think, where I saw these abstracts going for quite a bit of money, as I remember looking more than a year ago. And so it's really interesting to just see this gorgeous work here, in a sense, like, I wonder how hard it is to be original with abstract. Like, I assume it's as hard as maybe, you know, being as original with figurative art. But it does make me wonder. I assume there's a lot of trial and error. Put it this way, I guess this is what I'm getting to, is you don't really plan a work like this, do you? I mean, I assume not. I mean, maybe feels would feel differently, but I assume this is.
00:02:07.904 - 00:02:30.608, Speaker A: Let's try this, let's try this. Let's put on this. And you have no idea. You're not like, again, I don't think this is a planned work. Otherwise feels is a super genius and maybe feels as a genius anyway. But I suspect this is not planned and this is just something that comes out through trial and error. And, you know, there's something to be said for trial and error.
00:02:30.608 - 00:03:24.930, Speaker A: And it brings us back to the cider conversation, actually, I was thinking about that more yesterday, the cider comment on, you know, should I mint a lot of work if I have a lot of work, if all of a sudden I can feel like I can put this stuff out, make a work or two a day, maybe more. Should I do that? You know, and there's a difference between, I guess we'd say, the market and the creative act because you don't know what you're going to make. And I would argue back to this trial and error discussion with feels here and the creation of animated, abstract works like this is the more you do, the more masterpieces you're gonna get. Because not every work you're gonna do is gonna be a masterpiece. And if it is, then hopefully you get the super masterpiece, so to speak. And in my experience, I can only speak from personal experiences. My best works, it's not like they're planned.
00:03:24.930 - 00:03:58.112, Speaker A: It's not like I thought about them for six months, then I go, okay, now I'm gonna tackle that work. And then it happens. It's more, usually it's when I'm being prolific, when I'm putting out a ton of work. And then what happens is one out of every five or ten you go is a super work relative to whatever level you're at, you know, within your universe. Every five or ten, let's say, turns into a super work. Some are going to be better than others. And so the value of trial and error is, I guess, what I'm getting at.
00:03:58.112 - 00:05:02.840, Speaker A: So I was thinking about cider. It's like, yeah, like put out as much as possible because you might put out a super work and you don't know that ahead of time unless you have a spectacular. But, you know, almost most of us, not all of us, some people really plan the works. I used to, and as I like to say, it's a torturous way of working. Oftentimes, not always, but oftentimes because you're really taking all, I was going to say, all the joy out of making art because it's more about just trying to, you know, tie one thing to the next thing, like, and just match this idea in your head, which is a very tedious exercise. And I've spent years of my life doing this, so I feel like I have some, you know, I'm speaking from experience here and I just thought, well, that's what's, that is the sacrifice that is required is what I said to myself. And, you know, I was in my early thirties and so I decided, you know, so, but I don't recommend it.
00:05:02.840 - 00:05:38.832, Speaker A: I recommend having fun, being prolific. And the more you do, the more that's going to come out. And then within two or three years, like myth, I didn't bring them up. But myth was releasing some works from 2017. It reminds me of those early RJ works that Legojo was posting, right? And they're humble works, just like Sabato's early drawing exercises. And these are some of the most celebrated artists in this, seen at least on this show. So all to say, you can go a long way by being prolific in a couple of years.
00:05:38.832 - 00:06:06.504, Speaker A: Like a really long way. And look at RJ being super prolific. Now, where is RJ going to be in two years? Like, this is the weird thing about art. It's back to Heraclitus. No matter how far you dig or you go in the soul, like, you'll never reach its edge. I think they use the word logos, like, and maybe we can bring that up now. Okay, so we've gotten to Heraclitus here with feels.
00:06:06.504 - 00:06:30.454, Speaker A: So just a super cool abstract, all to say, a super cool abstract from feels. Let's look at the reserve and then we'll see if we can bring up Heraclitus reserve of 1.26 ETH, which now is 2600. 2600 us dollars. It's pretty interesting. You know, we are in the ecosystem of crypto and I love it. I think it's.
00:06:30.454 - 00:07:08.484, Speaker A: I think we're very lucky as artists to be in this ecosystem. I think this ecosystem works in our favor in so many ways. And you can do a whole show just on that. But one of the fun ways is if you're used to the bear market, all of a sudden, you know, if any, you've been saving your crypto from the bear market, all of a sudden all that money is going up, you know, so you kind of get leveraged money if you're kind of getting it at the bottom and it goes back up. So all to say this is a reserve of, I'd say, 1.26, which didn't sound that much a few months ago, and it's now $2,600. So, so very interesting.
00:07:08.484 - 00:07:37.264, Speaker A: Minted November 9 by feels on super rare. So super cool work. Shall we look? Let's find this. Let's see if we can find the Heraclitus. Quick. Heraclitus is a presocratic philosopher, ancient Greek, 500 bce. Heraclitus quote, no matter how deep you go, you won't find the edges of the soul.
00:07:37.264 - 00:08:00.202, Speaker A: Here it is. Philosophy quotes on instagram. You could never arrive at the limits of the soul, no matter how many roads you traveled. So deep is its mystery. And I'd love to actually have the Greek, the english greek translation here, because I think logos is used in here. So deep is its logos. I think mystery is logos.
00:08:00.202 - 00:08:23.678, Speaker A: So this is kind of another way. So we're in the art business. The reason I'm saying this, we're in the art business. We're in the business of the infinite here. The imagination may have no limit. So let's. So if you think you can just make a lot of work and see how far you can push it, because theoretically, I mean, theoretically, there's no limit.
00:08:23.678 - 00:09:29.026, Speaker A: If heraclitus is right, and if there was a limit, what would it be? So inner space has its charms in that respect, doesn't it? So here are a couple more works by feels I want to highlight. Beautiful. A really interesting, cool artist. Again, I don't know too much about feels, but look at that, 250,000 views, right? And, like, this is another bullish aspect of digital art, isn't it? Because, you know, theoretically, a painter, a physical painter, can put their work online and maybe get a lot of views, but it just seems like this is kind of a medium, Twitter and all this that's designed for digital art, for example, you can make it move. It's a digital medium to begin with. You don't need to take a professional photo. And even when it's online, a digital work will pop more because it's made of digital colors rather than physical colors, which you're trying to photograph, maybe you have to brighten it up, etcetera.
00:09:29.026 - 00:09:46.934, Speaker A: So perhaps another. You know, it really is, you know, Twitter is a kind, or x is a kind of pirate ship in itself. I mean, look at the logo. It looks almost like crossbones there without a skull. So look at it. All we need is a skull right here. So.
00:09:46.934 - 00:10:05.732, Speaker A: And it kind of is for the art scene, I would argue. So just kind of interesting. I mean, 41, 42,000 views here. Another one by feels. So these are just some recent tweets. They may be older works here. You get the same kind of color scheme here, though, don't you? So again, maybe these are different trials and errors.
00:10:05.732 - 00:10:43.774, Speaker A: I bet this is like, if we go back here, it's a similar, not identical, but a similar color scheme here, right? So you almost wonder, are these just different processing results? Right? Different results from trial and error. Interesting. So the hype is real on this Twitter space that we're doing tomorrow with Lorna Mills. She is trying not to be drunk, as she said here. So either way, I think it's going to be wonderful. Radio is almost what I'd like to call that art. The Mort is excited Oxeye, you're in for a ride.
00:10:43.774 - 00:10:54.028, Speaker A: And tooks, most probably literally the best episode of all times. Get ready, famous. Oh, boy. This is going to be a rowdy one. So people are excited. I was looking. It doesn't say here.
00:10:54.028 - 00:11:13.348, Speaker A: I think there's already like 90 people that are signed up to this, so it should be a good one. Human boy. Should be a fun show. The reminder has been set, though. Honestly, I wonder why anyone would listen to a sober Lorna Mills, a real og. And I thought we had Lorna Mills. I I thought sometimes you don't get every tweet.
00:11:13.348 - 00:11:35.462, Speaker A: Oh, maybe she put out a. She put out a tweet on her own. Here, let me just see if I can find it because it's actually pretty hilarious just to whet your appetite. Here. Here we go. Don't worry, I'll be drunk and talk about everything but the big picture and where we're going. As I was saying, I'll ask the big questions on what it all means and where it's going nice and general there.
00:11:35.462 - 00:11:47.354, Speaker A: So anyways, check that out. It's in the feed. I'll retweet that today. And also comments from last show. Score. Exciting show, as always. I love how you talk about artworks.
00:11:47.354 - 00:12:02.498, Speaker A: Thank you. Thank you so much for reviewing my works. Absolute pleasure. Shuda Yasukochi always makes music with modular. He is a very happy. You're reviewing a song, too, and the music was perfect for that. And I guess it was like a blooming rose, if I remember right.
00:12:02.498 - 00:12:22.444, Speaker A: It's an original song for this work and I think I saw it on Twitter. This is Shuda is scores Saiko's husband. So isn't that fun? So a cool husband wife combination, if I got that right. Skomra, great show. You're pumped at the beginning. It's great to see. It's so great to see cider bring up the topic of output volume.
00:12:22.444 - 00:12:46.706, Speaker A: Indeed. For me, I use Twitter to get feedback on my work. I use people's reaction and my own reaction to see it public, to inform what I should keep investigating and also what I should mint. Yeah, it's an interesting, you know, it's not bad. You know, they talk about the wisdom of crowds. It's not a bad gauge. I don't know if it's a perfect gauge.
00:12:46.706 - 00:13:19.824, Speaker A: Right? Because, you know, there is this balance, like, does the wisdom of Twitter or x, you know, should you be going 100% on what, what it says? Because remember the. I think it was guru, guru Harina put out the. The flashing work. And, like, there is sort of a reptilian element in the sense of if it flashes, maybe that'll get more views, and that doesn't necessarily make a greater artwork. So it's an interesting balance. But I know what you mean. Like, it is a kind of, for lack of better term, validation.
00:13:19.824 - 00:13:46.744, Speaker A: Like, when I see a work do well that I put up, I'm actually, I'm pretty excited about it. Like that last one, I was looking at 15 or 16,000 views, and I was, for me, I was like, oh, that was a good one. So I know what you're saying. And actually I find the wisdom of crowds, so to speak, from an art perspective on x, it's not bad at all. From what I can tell. It's not perfect, but it's not bad. So I wouldn't base 100% on it.
00:13:46.744 - 00:14:24.720, Speaker A: But maybe you base 80%, 70% depending on how edgy what you're doing is. Like, if you know you're doing something very experimental and that might not be understood, well, then maybe you don't put as much emphasis on it, right. Because some stuff's gonna be more difficult and more out there, and that's okay. When you put something out there, you should immediately get a chance to see if and how it resonates with people and you have a wider audience from which to get reactions from. I think that's the advantage of digital art, over trad art. And I think that will ultimately be how this space eventually overwhelms trad art. Even setting digital aesthetics aside.
00:14:24.720 - 00:14:47.368, Speaker A: Yeah, good point. Because digital aesthetics are very important. But setting that aside, though, that might be more important. The fact that we've closed the feedback loop on what works and what doesn't work accelerates our opportunity for growth as artists. Exactly. And we're not hindered by financial constraints either. And we have an incredible array of tools.
00:14:47.368 - 00:15:06.264, Speaker A: Like, if you ever feel like you get stuck, try a new software. You know what I mean? Like get a new app, you know, like. And just start messing around. You know, that's half the battle oftentimes. Look at Kappn. Oh, let's find another obscure software. Look at Sabato with the deluxe four drawing exercises.
00:15:06.264 - 00:15:25.164, Speaker A: Oh, let's try something here. You have this incredible output, so let's continue here. Almost no one ever says you make too much art. You're being lazy, thoughtless. Exactly. Too much art is. There isn't a time, like if you're minting ten works a day, maybe that's too much.
00:15:25.164 - 00:16:11.950, Speaker A: Right? Like maybe you pick the best of that ten works and then you put everything else on the side and then maybe you mint it in other places and whatnot, right? So, and I think the viewers are generally smart enough to suss out if something, if a process gets too easy as well, or if an artist is getting, quote, lazy, or as Skommer is saying, thoughtless. So very sophisticated feedback here from Skomra. Of course you have to consider tokenomics in this space. Like he's checking off all the boxes, I would argue, but even then I think you can fit a high output volume into a creative token structure with some thought. Thanks for showing my works. A pleasure, Skomra. And Skammer continues to hit it out of the park.
00:16:11.950 - 00:16:21.670, Speaker A: I think we even have one more today. Human boy, take one is great. Wonderful episode. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, it was fun. I felt great for being back.
00:16:21.670 - 00:16:48.650, Speaker A: And you know what it was, it was a great sleep. I went to bed at like nine on Sunday because I was just exhausted from the trip and I woke up at like 730. So it was a great sleep and there's a lot to be said for sleep. You might I didn't get a great sleep last night, but huge sleep on Sunday and I think it's incredible. Sleep is magic. Sleep is magic. Another hugely enjoyable episode.
00:16:48.650 - 00:17:09.918, Speaker A: Retro. Manny, thanks for giving CBot some love too. My pleasure. Yet it is already minted. It was gifted to the highest collector of my cyberpunk audiobook on Tezos output 2049. Regarding the current rally, I have to agree with you. The crypto rally, I personally don't think we ever get to go back to the gold rush of 2020 2021 and this is actually my.
00:17:09.918 - 00:17:30.908, Speaker A: It's a little too. The whole thing feels like it's kind of like a bad movie is how I feel. And I could be totally wrong. So don't take my not financial advice. Right? And I could be so far I am wrong on this. Like, I didn't think it would get this high. I thought maybe in a couple of years, right? But for me right now it's just a little too convenient.
00:17:30.908 - 00:18:14.384, Speaker A: It's a bit of a rehash and it's a little too close to this massive, it feels again like an echo boom and so. But who knows? I mean, I think a lot of people feel that way. There were a lot of shorts that have been squeezed. Okay, so it'll be interesting to see things are getting more stable and more exciting, though. Sorry to sound like a steady netty lull. Yeah. But I agree with your take on this again, for me, it's just a little from a narrative perspective, I don't feel the same animal spirits, so to speak, as I did in 2020, when all of a sudden I thought, I have to put every last penny I have into crypto, otherwise I'm going to miss the opportunity of a lifetime.
00:18:14.384 - 00:18:36.306, Speaker A: For whatever reason, I don't feel that way now. But this isn't a financial news program, and I'm not a financial expert, so. So just opinions here. And again, follow your own path on that. And it's far easier to spot the scams way ahead of time of the curve, too. So evidence of sustainability is what I'm seeing right now. Also, loved what you said about zooming into the works.
00:18:36.306 - 00:19:07.186, Speaker A: And yes, some social media friendly art doesn't stand up to closer inspection. So it is always a pleasure to explore these works in detail when the artists show that caring attention to details, brushwork, you know, it's a weird kind of thing. It took some time in this show to actually develop this idea. Sometimes the simplest ideas are kind of breakthroughs. Like, it was kind of obvious idea, oh, zoom in on the work. But I didn't think I did that to, like, at least 15 shows in maybe 20. I think it was a myth work, and I started doing it with Ratcloak, you know, maybe 20 episodes in.
00:19:07.186 - 00:19:22.160, Speaker A: Something great about galleries, but also you can definitely get a sense of even in the metaverse galleries, in my opinion, including the scale of the work, too. Anyways, great show. Thank you. Cider, awesome take on my tweet. Poco. Excellent fodder for discussion. Cider, excellent discussion point.
00:19:22.160 - 00:19:42.128, Speaker A: Will for sure give it a try. Honestly, much love and right back at you. Cider, great to hear from you. Maybe we put cider, see if Cider wants to come on the space in a few months here, four or five months. Get an update on what is happening over there. Santiago is a codal. Yeah, I was calling it the international Protocol Protocol file server.
00:19:42.128 - 00:20:03.128, Speaker A: It is actually the interplanetary file system, so correction there and also first comment. Thank you, Santiago. Great to hear from you. And I'll be in touch in the next couple of weeks about doing that Friday podcast. And, Rada, I'm sending this episode to my relatives and all those people that mocked me. I kid one love. You are a great emissary of our community.
00:20:03.128 - 00:20:25.662, Speaker A: Well, thank you very much, Rada, one of the established states people of this scene, and just a huge, huge supporter, and I totally appreciate that. Also, we got a few comments here. Just thank you. Gozo, great to hear from you. And I just wanted to go down to strange thing. Thank you everybody for the comments. Strange thing gave some more insights here.
00:20:25.662 - 00:20:41.854, Speaker A: If I knew these axe. Thank you for the kind comments again, surrounding my work, especially amongst all these amazing art pieces. If I knew the axe and pieces were going that low, I would have swooped in with some bids. I think we all slept on this drop. Absolutely. And there we go. Let them bring their drills.
00:20:41.854 - 00:21:03.766, Speaker A: Onwards we march. And this was exactly how. There we are. We returned fire. So thank you, everybody, for the support here and awesome to hear from you. And, okay, so let's get into some of the interesting things we're seeing online. So Dina Chang had showed a really cool.
00:21:03.766 - 00:21:29.808, Speaker A: I don't know how she even got this video. Gorgeous mint plus print with a stunning AR layer. Wild. So, Nicholas Sassoon, you might remember we were looking at this work, and remember there was the weird sale. It kind of went at auction for two ETH, and then it kind of, it was kind of a mistake. Auction of sorts. And so it's being re released as a digital physical edition, edition of 20 at half an ETH per edition.
00:21:29.808 - 00:21:50.356, Speaker A: This is very cool work by Nicholas Sassoon. And so I guess it's like an AR version too. So how cool is that? And here is that tweet. And here's the print. Each edition of studio study is sold with a 24 by 24 inch. So that's not small. That is a nice looking print.
00:21:50.356 - 00:22:18.706, Speaker A: Signed archive gicle print on 300 grams, 100% cotton, acid free, and trade a paper. So that is interesting. I've never done a giclee, so it looks pretty sharp, though, doesn't it? And so interesting. Collectors of this artwork will receive both the NFT and the print at no additional cost, shipping included. And there it is. It looks like really nice paper. It looks precious, which is really kind of the goal when you're making a physical.
00:22:18.706 - 00:22:45.010, Speaker A: You want it to look precious, right? And I think that's been achieved here. So interesting. Dina Chang our NFT Tuesday La meetups have been a beacon of light for me. Dina's at least been doing this, I think, like, we talked to Dina Chang on the spaces in August. So here she was doing it back then. So here I think she was starting right around then in July, August. Thank you, Ibuki Kuromochi, for sharing snaps from last week.
00:22:45.010 - 00:23:01.644, Speaker A: So here it is. I've never actually seen any of the NFT Tuesday La, so I assume that's Dina Chang. Looks pretty well attended. Looks like a serious crowd. And there you go. Digital paintings and everything. Looks like a pretty cool scene in LA.
00:23:01.644 - 00:23:38.692, Speaker A: Continuing on, this is the art matter robot, pale Carill. We've been looking at this series here for, I guess, a week or so. With a new week ahead, it's time to share the announcement. Not me series, created by tender art, returns on Wednesday. The nine pieces will be available at reserve triggered auctions with the same price, each piece coming with the oil painting made by art matter robot. I still feel weird. Like, I assume people have to credit art matter, and I really like art matter and what they're doing, but I feel weird again about this credit issue because this, it feels like they're supposed to credit art matter.
00:23:38.692 - 00:24:35.222, Speaker A: I mean, here's my philosophical question for you, if anybody wants to comment. I was thinking to myself, is this like crediting like Adobe if you're using Photoshop? That's my question. Like, what's the difference between, so if I use Photoshop and I'm using Photoshop's tool to make my art, but it's my art and it's my design. So, you know, so I do have a questions on the authorship issue because it seems like there's an emphasis on art matter. Being the author now, all to say, let's not let that distract us. Let's look at the works, because these look a little bit more, I don't want to say successful, but they look a little bit more. It's not as obvious that there's a textured underneath, that these were produced with a texture underneath first and then kind of printed over top.
00:24:35.222 - 00:25:03.610, Speaker A: They seem more, for lack of better term, persuasive in the sense that they look like a person could have done them, like a really skilled painter. Interestingly, they're beautifully painted. Again, credit to the art matter technology here. Right? Like, this looks a lot more convincing over here in terms of we're not seeing a brushstroke texture. Continue with the color changing. Right. And you're even seeing this interesting mix here of color.
00:25:03.610 - 00:25:45.592, Speaker A: So, you know, and maybe that's what's making this look more quote unquote persuasive, is it's almost like a great technique of painters, even especially today, to make the brushstrokes look interesting is to put two colors in a brush stroke, because then you get all the randomness when you do a stroke like this, and then you get a couple of colors here, right, in all of these strokes. So it kind of looks like there's a mixed color here. Not sure if that's an illusion here. They're pretty pure. But again, they look quite convincing in the sense that if you said a human did them, it wouldn't be apparently obvious to me that that was untrue. Okay, that is what I'm getting at. Look at here again.
00:25:45.592 - 00:26:21.108, Speaker A: It looks like two colors in the brush stroke, and that's pretty impressive. And here, like, again, we're not seeing the texture bleed into here. And, you know, so interesting, right? So there may be different kind of iterations here. Again, this looks like a little bit more like, you know, closer to Helio Santos. Like, if you were to say, you know, different colors were used on each brush on this, I'd say, yeah, I could see that. Look at this right there. You know, a lot of these, especially because you have the multicolor, maybe that makes it look more convincing.
00:26:21.108 - 00:26:47.994, Speaker A: Maybe it is a different process. Maybe that is what's going on. I'm not sure. All to say this, highly textured paintings by pale carill. This is another kind of touchstone here as we kind of go from digital to physical using the paint plotters, isn't it? I mean, there is something. There is another kind of landmark here. Machine just in the studio.
00:26:47.994 - 00:27:08.724, Speaker A: And here I just thought it was a cool work here by machine. And just interesting. And such an unusual artist. I would actually say that I'm just kind of, like, excited to show more. I mean, look at this kind of. It's almost like a bug or a crab. Lobster with a heart for a head and some antenna.
00:27:08.724 - 00:27:51.962, Speaker A: Just totally unusual and very cool and kind of small. Look at the tape. See how small this is as it continues? This is super interesting, and it actually is extending. Bitcoin blockchain blockchains by NFT sales volume volumes Leonidas posted this yesterday at 08:27 p.m. Berlin time. Bitcoin is now 47%, almost half of NFT sales volume, and ethereum is only 13%. And what's interesting, remember we added all this up and it came to about $35 million in volume total.
00:27:51.962 - 00:28:20.250, Speaker A: And I was kind of impressed at how well it's doing. It kind of adds up to the same 29, about 3032-3334 so pretty interesting. It looks like bitcoin's taking increasing volume now. That is also with ethereum going up in price, too. So it's not like just bitcoins going up. So therefore they're getting more kind of, you know, sales volume because the token is going up. It actually is probably trading.
00:28:20.250 - 00:28:40.666, Speaker A: So just very interesting and just a little bit more on ordinals. This is why ordinals is so amazing. Which is of course the way you inscribe images and documents on bitcoin. Someone releases an idea into the world that is bitmap. People are free to inscribe it on bitcoin. Anyone on the planet is free to build on it. Interesting.
00:28:40.666 - 00:29:04.054, Speaker A: Holders are incentivized to collaborate. Builders are incentivized to share information in open source. As long as you hold the underlying inscription, you benefit from the growth and openness of the network. You don't need to build a closed off business anymore. Better to share information and encourage growth than to build walls around your brand. Because as the network grows, the price of the underlying token increases. Everyone wins.
00:29:04.054 - 00:29:49.962, Speaker A: So interesting speculation here, isn't it? Because it seems to me that this would be a different way of doing business, right? So just kind of again, perhaps a window on the future here and one more from Ordnalls wallet. In the future, if you have a business idea, you just release the protocol and be the first one to inscribe. Raising funds and hiring around a business idea will be less attractive and slower to market. As your holder count grows, the number of people in your network that are incentivized to build on your idea also grows. You don't even need to hire people to work out your ideas, you just put them out there and let the holder network handle implementation. This is like the revolutionary idea here. If the idea is good, it will take off.
00:29:49.962 - 00:30:24.932, Speaker A: If not, it will fall by the wayside again, broadcasting from the year 2600 year, maybe earlier. Opportunity will be as abundant as ideas. This is a new paradigm. So pretty fascinating speculation here. Quiro sent me sealed and question. So I think this is a new platform that offers like gasless bidding. If you if you're selling art for less on Tezos, why not list the same piece on sealed for a super low reserve? With gasless bidding, anyone can afford to bid, and with Vickrey auctions, all bidding is fair.
00:30:24.932 - 00:31:00.284, Speaker A: You only bid what you can afford or however you value the work. Dare to try sometime once actual gas lure is enough to mint. Haha. So I'm not exactly sure what's going on here, but I thought I'd highlight the tweet again. It was sent to me via Curo and I think actually I have a work on one of these platforms minted by Curo, so we'll see it in action. Burka Byram my illustrated Rip van Winkle PDF book is now featured on Zora's homepage. So Burka putting another work here on Zora so what's kind of cool about Zora is it's kind of a catch all for stuff like this show.
00:31:00.284 - 00:31:25.300, Speaker A: You know, do you have a book that's maybe too big? You know, you just want to mint something. You don't want it to cost a lot of money. You want to be available to people who are willing to collect a wide array. They have kind of like a collector base that likes collecting. Just kind of a lot of different kinds of things, you know. So beyond art, you know, documents and this sort of stuff, books. So just kind of cool from burka here.
00:31:25.300 - 00:31:59.348, Speaker A: And cool that burka did a book on Rip van Winkle and the illustrations continuing on. Martin Bruce oil JPEG GIf. And so this is a super interesting situation here. So I have a theory, and my theory is, is actually the oil came second. So this is the oil painting. And I suspect, based on this image, that actually this came first. I may be wrong on that, but I suspect look at the shadow here, and then you come back here and.
00:31:59.348 - 00:32:30.158, Speaker A: But it's hard to say, but I imagine the digital came first, but I could be wrong. And then the physical, and I almost wonder, like, is this the leftovers of the physical? Like, maybe. No, it's actually different. The painting is different here. And then if we look at the gif, we see a moving version. So I find this really interesting, as I find all of Martin Bruce's work now. Just very interesting.
00:32:30.158 - 00:32:48.150, Speaker A: So not exactly sure what's going on, but pretty interesting. And this is why I'm highlighting it here. So cider, look at this. And so the wait is over. My digital garden soon on super rare as my genesis on the platform. Need to figure out how to import my contract. That's an interesting question.
00:32:48.150 - 00:33:27.874, Speaker A: If anybody knows how to do that, you can mail a cider message. Cider. So a pretty interesting choice for a super rare genesis here, a garden. And it almost feels like a kind of version, if I understand. I mean, they look like flowers to me, don't they? I mean, it's almost got, like a bit of a Monet water lily kind of feel to it in terms of the just overall, you know, look and texture. And it's almost like, I think I brought it up big by accident here, so let's actually look at it. You know, what's so interesting about this is it almost looks like cider is able to.
00:33:27.874 - 00:34:02.028, Speaker A: It's like putting the underpainting in pink here and then putting the blue over top, but you let it bleed through. I mean, kind of a classic painterly. Technique. And I mean, here, it almost looks like we're looking at blended brushwork. I mean, it's kind of got that feeling here. That's part of what I think makes ciders work so persuasive is it kind of has all this noise in it, this randomness, the same randomness we appreciate in a. You know, when you mix two or three colors together, let's say two colors in a brushstroke, in a physical brushstroke.
00:34:02.028 - 00:34:25.601, Speaker A: So pretty cool work here by cider. And I believe this is like a garden of flowers, if I'm not mistaken here. So just very, very cool work here from cider to be minted on super rare shortly. Another epic work here. This is simple thoughts. Microsoft paint 2023. This is on imprint.
00:34:25.601 - 00:34:47.368, Speaker A: I'll bring that up. And I always love how Cuompa puts the. What looks like a modern version of Microsoft paint. Like, I was always imagining when people use Microsoft paint, that they're using old versions. But this is very. This looks like windows, the modern windows. Right? And this is in print shop, Black Friday.
00:34:47.368 - 00:35:04.444, Speaker A: So what is this? Open a print shop. So maybe Cwampa is selling. Look, you can get a quanta print for $8.50. Very interesting. So we're seeing another crossover here with physical and digital. How interesting. I wonder if these are limited.
00:35:04.444 - 00:35:24.080, Speaker A: Doesn't look like it. So it's basically, if you want a print of cwampa, and you can determine the size. So more interesting, you can make a card. Very interesting canvas and everything. Interesting way of doing. Cool title, too, by the way. Cwampa, and very interesting.
00:35:24.080 - 00:35:47.888, Speaker A: And here's deca art. So again, it's kind of like multi chain, multi platform, multimedia, and deca art. I think this is the portfolio site, if I'm not mistaken. So very cool from Cuompa. So RJ puts out another really cool drawing here, kind of a pixel drawing. What does he call it here? Pixel drawings. There we go.
00:35:47.888 - 00:36:02.848, Speaker A: So. And there are a few of them here. So I think we looked at the others. But you gotta love the roughness here. Again, the square pixel brush, I'm a huge fan of. I have some drawings I'm gonna release, too, from the pixel art sketchbook that I've just been. Just not enough time to release.
00:36:02.848 - 00:36:23.024, Speaker A: But all to say, but I love what RJ left out in this piece, because, again, we saw the background in the other. This was one I didn't see. And let's just open this big. Like, is this. I bet this is a scoop. This is as big as it goes, this is probably a square pixel brush, again, pixel drawings. The square brush again makes everything new.
00:36:23.024 - 00:36:37.508, Speaker A: So I'm a huge fan of this. RJ putting his own spin on the pixel drawings, on pixel sketches. Very cool. Someone in bed. And I wonder if this is pastiche or not. Interesting question. Ezra Eslin.
00:36:37.508 - 00:37:09.242, Speaker A: This was released November 13. So just yesterday actually, Demian. Interesting title. And again, as I like to say with Ezra Eslin, like violence as satire. And that's what you can do in fiction, just like Marquis de Sade. And you can even be had, have some humor about it. There's a pepe and a knife in the background and someone painting, you know, kind of an the fire in the background of this person who seems to be dead.
00:37:09.242 - 00:37:20.602, Speaker A: And just kind of interesting, isn't it? A cool work, Demian. Demian. Cool title. And classic. Ezra Eslund. Mint for 0.035, but by now for 0.42.
00:37:20.602 - 00:37:41.318, Speaker A: So I wonder how many was only one minted? No, I think maybe more. I. Yes, there were a few minted. But isn't that interesting now, ten x, you know, a lot of people and look, it looks. Yeah, so. Or maybe actually there's a lot more than. There's actually quite a few that were sold.
00:37:41.318 - 00:38:03.618, Speaker A: 25 were sold. And now it is 0.42 east to pick one up. Smaunter, I was going to say a lot of the speculators in the like you'll see on zora, they'll often just ten exit and then they'll put the new price once the minting window is closed and they put the new price. So just kind of interesting. Smaunter. Accurate portrait sponsor's second profile picture on x and object.
00:38:03.618 - 00:38:20.494, Speaker A: So a rare self portrait here of smaunter. So very interesting. Cool artist, as we know. Always an interesting angle, right? A very interesting angle. As usual, Daniel W. He comes to collect with a couple here. This is on object for five tezos.
00:38:20.494 - 00:38:49.402, Speaker A: And another kind of haunted work. Again, using this kind of print language, the language of print here, the visual language of print here. And even working with some very cool, almost giving the sense of wind. These little marks that look like maybe leaves moving around in a shadowy figure here on a hill looking like October or November here. The weeping gatekeeper. Here's another one. And let's just get that going.
00:38:49.402 - 00:39:08.550, Speaker A: So cool works by Daniel Wood. You know, demon ego is influenced by horror. It seems like Daniel W. Is influenced by horror. Horror. It's pretty interesting as a subgenre, isn't it? Nice negative space here by the way Daniel W. On the whites here.
00:39:08.550 - 00:39:23.600, Speaker A: Very nice. And also on, you know, it calls your attention. I'm. You know, that's where I'm looking mostly, interestingly, is at the negative space. And again, you get this kind of movement of what look like leaves or just marks on the paper. The weeping gatekeeper. Nice work here.
00:39:23.600 - 00:39:44.984, Speaker A: Edition of 24 for five tazos, 13 left. And here is a new one by Axstone GM level one. I think it's a new one. I saw this in Ukscene's feed, and I thought it was a great work here. Look at that. 23,000 views. Again, it's like the visual language of video games.
00:39:44.984 - 00:40:11.302, Speaker A: It's like video games as subject matter. Right? Video game, you know, interfaces as subject matter. And we see it here with ax stone. And pretty effectively and immediately identifiable as an ax stone, too. So just cool work here. Continuing on here is Jordi Gandul, builders, one of one. This was sold for one ETH and just minted on November 10.
00:40:11.302 - 00:40:20.488, Speaker A: This is part, I think, of a super chief show, I thought. Thought. Or builders. One of one. What is this? I'm not. Yeah, it's. Or maybe a dao.
00:40:20.488 - 00:40:33.856, Speaker A: Maybe this is something different. Tbdao. Anyway, just listed here, you might recognize their art from Tezos, I think. So a nice ethereum piece. Kind of a. Feels like a bigger, simpler composition for some reason. I'm not sure why.
00:40:33.856 - 00:40:44.938, Speaker A: Maybe it's because it is. I'm not sure. Feels zoomed in a little bit .1. The builder's dao. That is it. So there you go. And there, I think they have a whole show.
00:40:44.938 - 00:41:02.258, Speaker A: Look at that. Is that. Is that. We'll see if this loads up. Who is this digital drawing with clip studio paint created by the builders, Dao. Not exactly sure who this is. Interesting piece.
00:41:02.258 - 00:41:26.744, Speaker A: Kind of has a bit of a vaporwave kind of feel to it. Interesting work. Continuing on, just on xcenes feed again, just seeing Euxine's kind of process at work here. You know, I thought it was kind of a nice illustration on how Euxine works. Right. There's probably three or four frames here. And what's so interesting about, I think, this movement, like, this gif.
00:41:26.744 - 00:41:40.954, Speaker A: This movement of gifs. And, like, because you take. This is my point. You take each one of these frames separately, you go, meh. Like, cool. Very nice. Right? But is this.
00:41:40.954 - 00:41:55.914, Speaker A: You know, how great is this? It's like, cool, right? I mean, this is oxy, and this is great. Okay. But my point is, you take each frame on its own. It's okay. It's good. But you take. But you then move it, and it takes on a life of its own.
00:41:55.914 - 00:42:18.374, Speaker A: Like, this is the work, right? Like it's in the movement is what I'm trying to say, that things are hap. That the real kind of poetry, let's say the. The most exciting. This is what I'm trying to say. It's in the movement that the exciting poetry takes place on this work is what I'm arguing. It's in the movement. And there's one that we haven't gotten here, I feel.
00:42:18.374 - 00:42:39.120, Speaker A: But you see. So just interesting, isn't it? And it kind of breathes and it kind of becomes its own organism and it can gives you. Because. And what is the issue? This is the one I was looking for. What is the issue is, okay, it's cool. Very nice, right? And it has this treatment process, but maybe it's not complex enough. Like maybe it needs something.
00:42:39.120 - 00:43:17.506, Speaker A: And what it needs are these other versions, right? And then you start mixing all the versions together, and then you get, like, a much more organic poetic work, arguably. Anyway, great work. Again, just like tossing off a GIF here with very cool text, as usual from uxing. This is ox eye. And what is this called? Walking in an exaggerated manner towards the perimeter of a self. So kind of a cool work. Kind of has a crypto art feel to it, doesn't it? And, you know, kind of, you know, looks like a, you know, AI or kind of like facial recognition technology or AI recognition technology in the hands.
00:43:17.506 - 00:43:35.718, Speaker A: And then it's kind of this loop of sorts here with a subway going by. Pretty nice work, isn't it? So let's see what's going on here. I think this is a one of one on object. This was minted. We'll see if it's sold. Sometimes I bring these. Okay, so just minted.
00:43:35.718 - 00:43:55.280, Speaker A: So very cool here. 175 frames. So how big is this file? Must be a fairly large file at 175 frames. Pretty interesting. Good morning. And so this is by Ugo sometimes, as we call UgO 42. This is by Ugo here.
00:43:55.280 - 00:44:16.784, Speaker A: Good morning. And just another cool work using them. What is the name of this person? It's like the Microsoft helper. So playing with the Microsoft iconography. And really nice, actually really nicely done in the animation here. Kind of back to the animation again. We see it here again.
00:44:16.784 - 00:44:32.304, Speaker A: You freeze it. It's like, yeah, this is. Okay, this is fun. But you put it all together and it's like it comes alive and it becomes its own thing. So we're talking gifs tomorrow with Lorna Mills. So this is almost prelude to that to a certain degree. Like, it's quite interesting.
00:44:32.304 - 00:45:07.022, Speaker A: Again, when I came to the NFT and kind of the digital scene, I was doing digital on my own. I didn't realize there was a whole tumblr scene and all that sort of stuff. I maybe vaguely, and I knew there was something called super rare, but I had no idea what it meant or what it was or how to put my work there. All I knew is I had to apply, but I didn't know anything about crypto. And so when I came, I was kind of like. I had a bias towards static, but I didn't really. I wasn't overly familiar with gif culture, for lack of a better term, you know, tumblr culture and the whole gif thing.
00:45:07.022 - 00:45:23.652, Speaker A: And you see, I mean, it's movement. You see how important movement is to this kind of art, to this kind of digital art. It's just interesting, at least for me. Mumble boy. This, I believe, was sent to me. Let me just double check. Yeah, authentic waffles sent it to me.
00:45:23.652 - 00:45:41.654, Speaker A: Okay. And so, interesting, interesting, interesting. So, yeah, so this is someone called mumble boy. And thank you. Authentic waffles. Pretty interesting work. Kind of reminds me of moe shit, as I like to call them.
00:45:41.654 - 00:46:08.898, Speaker A: And pretty cool work, isn't it? You know, I won't show everything that is sent to me, but I do. But I try and be transparent about it, and I just thought it was a cool work. There's a few others. There's a couple other AI works that were sent to me, and I thought those were worth showing, too, or that fit the program, so to speak. And here, actually, is moe s h I t temble, Ms. Miss dream monster. So we saw one yesterday.
00:46:08.898 - 00:46:28.094, Speaker A: This one's slightly different, I think. I think there's a humor here that I really like and a simplicity and an originality, I would argue. And remember yesterday we saw this one. So here's another one of one. And how did it sell? Looks like it did sell. Or just minted or maybe. Let's just reload quickly here.
00:46:28.094 - 00:46:41.182, Speaker A: Then we got to run through this program again. I keep hoping we're going to have short episodes, but seems okay. Just minted. So not listed yet. Okay. This is still available for 20 tezos. That very nice piece we're looking at yesterday.
00:46:41.182 - 00:47:17.636, Speaker A: And here we have Zwoxvo. I want to call the cult favorite Zwoxo. This is on Zora. Hi. Amazing. Just a super interesting artist. Love Colleen, just a really, really cool artist.
00:47:17.636 - 00:47:43.684, Speaker A: Nuv 1914 could hang in the same show as Voxo there. Look at these. Great. You know what stands out to me, first of all, actually, it's the really cool composition here and the originality in the composition and the boldness. But really, what screams out to me is this blue gradient. These blue gradients on the side, and then you have this stripe here. It's almost like this is.
00:47:43.684 - 00:47:55.654, Speaker A: Yeah, almost. The word is outrageous. These outrageous blue gradients on the side here. Really cool work from NUV 1914. And I think I picked this one up. I think I was lucky enough to pick this up this morning. Yeah, ten tazos.
00:47:55.654 - 00:48:12.834, Speaker A: Got a one of one novius. Pretty cool work. Again, you get the blue gradient here on this kind of polaroid structure here. Wee, wee, whoa, whoa, wee. Very fun work. Thrilled to get that for $8.89. Fabulous.
00:48:12.834 - 00:48:36.734, Speaker A: Lena Eckert, GM awesome people have a great weekend. And I thought these gradients kind of went nicely. Interesting kind of architectural work here with a little bit of gradient, a little bit of texture, and you see light cycling through here. So cool work from Lena Eckart. If I got Lena Eckert. Lena Eckert. So cool work there.
00:48:36.734 - 00:49:05.274, Speaker A: And this is by Santiago Ruau. Another cool work on Zora. So another interesting abstract here from Santiago Ruau. Only two minted, so you can get one here, and maybe it'll be a nice slow edition mirage. Another work by Mech TXT here. And as we see here, a beautiful use of negative space. That is what screams out at me, you know, I can't wait for these to be minted.
00:49:05.274 - 00:49:30.284, Speaker A: I feel like I won't be able to afford them. They are, you know, in terms of the excitement I have. And maybe it's my bias towards trying to make art like this myself with Ultima Four. Art that celebrated Ultima Four. This is, again, you know, it's a great series when you wish you did it yourself, you know? And that's how I feel about this series. It is fabulous. And look at this.
00:49:30.284 - 00:49:52.442, Speaker A: Like, see, it's kind of like a classic, almost like margin by Mech TXt. And then, boop, boop, boop. Huge pixel. You know, huge pixels kind of dropping out here. But then it turns into this majestic, super interesting composition, doesn't it? It turns in. It makes it much more poetic. Right? It becomes like, more like.
00:49:52.442 - 00:50:25.648, Speaker A: I mean, it's art before, but then it becomes. It just becomes more poetic. As we're discussing with gifs, you could have each frame separately, but it's much more poetic in the gifts, in those gifts to have it moving. These ones, you know, it's debatable, you know, because sometimes static works better. Or still, you know, these ones, I think the jury's out which is more satisfying or. So that's also interesting in a sense. If the static works don't survive enough on their own or not, then maybe it's time to bring in the movement.
00:50:25.648 - 00:50:42.274, Speaker A: I mean, just one passing thought. Gate to Moriah. Gate to Moria. A very interesting color choice here, too. Figments, internal host, partial reconfiguration. This is an edition of 15, probably now on secondary. Oh, no, on primary for 1330.
00:50:42.274 - 00:51:01.982, Speaker A: And I think this was just released this morning. So more beauty here from figments, also known as kappn. Great work here. And love the color cycling here. Can't remember the name of the software, but it's just an older software kaplan is using here. Obscure rpresty. And also, I think gimp.
00:51:01.982 - 00:51:20.990, Speaker A: And combining the two, I need to try out gimp again. I haven't tried it out for like six or seven years. Estrado rpresti with another interesting kind of pixel art abstract, this time with a red background. Quite a large file here. Edition of three. And let's see. And just minted joy kid.
00:51:20.990 - 00:51:38.144, Speaker A: Zero, zero, one. So interesting piece here. Almost looks kind of game like, doesn't it? And almost looks like a crossword. Almost looks like Mario. And a whole bunch of color cycling chaos. I could see this doing really well on Twitter. Sean Luke, edition of seven.
00:51:38.144 - 00:52:00.064, Speaker A: Turn again. Come full circle. And these kind of look like hourglasses, if I had to guess. And a really cool background here. And I think this is a one of one for 150. So. And then you get these interesting cycling kind of vertical areas here, almost like rivers of pattern and almost like liquid here.
00:52:00.064 - 00:52:12.212, Speaker A: And then a Rgb. Quite a complicated work, actually. Turn again. 132 frames. So this is the standard here. 132 frames, 640 by 640. 32.9
00:52:12.212 - 00:52:23.444, Speaker A: megabytes. Oh, addition of seven for 150. There are two left. Wow. So selling at a premium here. Very nice. And continuing on, Manadal and P one.
00:52:23.444 - 00:52:43.664, Speaker A: Let's get the music going. So Manadil doing the art, I believe. Bgmp one. Background music. P one. There we go. Pretty fun piece.
00:52:43.664 - 00:53:04.328, Speaker A: Nice music. Look at the turntable too. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, wonderful color, as usual with mandal. Let's stop that. So we almost listened to the whole thing there. Continuing on, chaz Super Mario. Press start.
00:53:04.328 - 00:53:24.484, Speaker A: So we've seen a lot of retro games here. And we saw Tetris now we have the start screen for Super Mario. Pretty fun, actually. And then you get the plants and the stars as stickers on the wall, plants on the shelf. Very cool. It's like the video game is leaking out into the external world a little bit here. And some drinking boxes.
00:53:24.484 - 00:53:40.544, Speaker A: Retro gold here. Super Mario. And that is three tazos. There are six left. You know, the market continues to be very healthy here, I would argue. Jacques disclosure half past away. So again, feels very crypto art esque.
00:53:40.544 - 00:53:59.992, Speaker A: Love these huge pixels here. Nice colors too. And those pixels just create a great contrast with what's going on here. Interesting processing in here as well on the computer monitor or the computer. Just create what you love. So. And then you have a skull half past away edition of 15.
00:53:59.992 - 00:54:18.174, Speaker A: And that's all on secondary. I guess there's probably two tezos on primary. Yes. Haiti rocket virus v 31 virus version 3.1 rip. And here we have another cool. What looks like hand drawn or mouse drawn kind of work here, I think.
00:54:18.174 - 00:54:40.888, Speaker A: And some great cycling here in this little kind of cord. And you see some, I don't know what that is, blood or energy going across this kind of almost broken screen here. Rip. A computer generated art interesting by Haiti rocket. Here's another one, maybe a preview of another work. I didn't see it minted anywhere. So interesting work here.
00:54:40.888 - 00:55:01.896, Speaker A: I wonder if Haiti mints on Ethereum. I remember there was a few works on Opensea like a year ago. I looked, but I don't remember seeing too many works by Haiti Rocket on Ethereum. Interestingly. Pixel fool. So another just cool animated abstract work here. As we run through the rest of this episode here, I am trying to keep these shorter.
00:55:01.896 - 00:55:18.002, Speaker A: Datura super cool. Big chunky pixels. There's something to be said for big pixels, eh? So another cool work here. Phone display. So these are, you know, you can get these on object. They don't load up in my browser just. And that's probably my browser issue.
00:55:18.002 - 00:55:34.616, Speaker A: A browser issue or maybe a security thing on Mac? Not sure. So Renki. So I bring up the Twitter version. Renki Nishi Gawara. Another cool animated abstract by Renki here. Black and white. Ten tezos edition of ten.
00:55:34.616 - 00:55:49.328, Speaker A: There are ten left. And look at this work by LB. I think I was talking about this at the start of the episode here. Pretty nice piece. Hey, again, big chunky pixels. There's something to be said for that we're seeing in mech TXT too, these very large pixels. So very nice.
00:55:49.328 - 00:56:15.954, Speaker A: Looks like a desktop icon that has been abstracted here by LB m zero five WX 333. There are five left. Another super cool abstract here by Rannick Steer and DJ Kiro. Momentary lapse. And let's just make that big. And you gotta love the understated colors, the texture of the analog video glitch, and just the interesting composition. Again, look at how pretty that is.
00:56:15.954 - 00:56:30.286, Speaker A: Just another take on abstract. Beautiful. Love the warm gray in the background there. And here, another one. This is. Okay, so this is by Kiro. And this is on that platform I was telling you about.
00:56:30.286 - 00:56:51.454, Speaker A: What is the sealed. This is sealed art. So a pretty rad piece here by Kiro on sealed art. What is this called? If I can? A teardrop of loneliness that taught me how to lie. So I'm not sure what language that is. Last sold for 0.05. Ethan Quiro continuing to make the sales here.
00:56:51.454 - 00:57:12.858, Speaker A: And again, I think this is a gasless auction, so not sure how that goes. If there's a minimum. Very interesting. So not a bad sale. Again, ETH at 200. That's still a $100 nice piece, but still a $100 sale. I was tempted to start with this personal bias here.
00:57:12.858 - 00:57:29.664, Speaker A: Beat machine. Ex mortal. Look at how pretty that is. I just love this stuff. And I love how it's transparent in the back. A very, very nice piece by exmortal here. If I had to guess, that looks like an akai S 1000.
00:57:29.664 - 00:57:42.140, Speaker A: But there are so many of these these days. But I'd guess that's an akai S 1000. It doesn't say, it just says beat machine. Oh, no. Here it is. A digital Eurorack module. And glitched with a synteny.
00:57:42.140 - 00:57:55.092, Speaker A: Maybe it's glitched with the. With this module. Not that being the module. This Roland VR three capture device. I think that might be a s 1000 akai. Not exactly sure on that, though. Another one by Exmortal.
00:57:55.092 - 00:58:07.860, Speaker A: A one of one. The dreamer. And there is the person within the movie camera. So very cool. Or the movie projector. So a couple of really cool works here by Xmortal. Let's just see what that sold for.
00:58:07.860 - 00:58:20.100, Speaker A: Cent to matto for free. Or maybe not for free. That could have been a private sale as well. Let's just see what happened here. So he sold out at 666. So nice work from exmoral. Gorgeous colors.
00:58:20.100 - 00:58:37.272, Speaker A: Olin, 43,000 views, as you'd expect from a work like this. I mean, a pretty amazing digital artwork here. A head turner, and just cool. Great texture here, too. So pretty wild stuff here. That could be an older work. Phosphor operator.
00:58:37.272 - 00:58:55.872, Speaker A: So I think we saw the Polaroid yesterday or the instamax. The next glitch portrait is faux operator. One of my longest and biggest supporters in the space. Accepting offers over ten tezos tomorrow at noon, which is probably today. And here it is. So another really cool glitch portrait here by Eizo. A very cool series.
00:58:55.872 - 00:59:17.444, Speaker A: And here it is, edition of ten on object. A pretty cool portrait series here. Continuing on, Henrique Cartaho augurs. Thank you explainer gallery, for collecting the one of one CRT seascape. So I think this is part of a whole series here. Very cool. And I remember Henrique Cartaho, if I'm pronouncing that right.
00:59:17.444 - 00:59:39.542, Speaker A: Had a great, some great seaside kind of family works. Very moving stuff with some, I think some pretty great music. So cool. I think you'd call this a CRT monitor, old tv monitor. A whole series here, as you can see. Looks like a generative art series, maybe. Limited collection of abstract seascapes made with processing four with data from personal archives.
00:59:39.542 - 00:59:57.010, Speaker A: Very cool. Roccano going on. And is that Mario again? It looks like Mario in the background. There it is. And here you see palm trees Mario. Sometimes all you need is just good ingredients. Here you put them in bottle of coke and there you have it.
00:59:57.010 - 01:00:12.094, Speaker A: Everything is cool. Coffee, everything. Beer, bull run, dreams. And this is Pixel Lord. And I think as we go into AI, I think this is AI. I'm not positive. Maybe it's edited AI.
01:00:12.094 - 01:00:37.878, Speaker A: Cool work here by Pixel lord skeleton, which I think we've seen a few skeletons before. Again, kind of looks like an AI skeleton. Nice kinda leave. I like this kind of rough selection here, by the way. Adds personality, reminds me like hasdrubal waffle in that edge on the rough selection. And here is Skomra with another pretty cool portrait here. AI illustration.
01:00:37.878 - 01:01:01.054, Speaker A: I want to call it GM from Skomra. Gmback Skomra. Thank you for all the comments. And another just fabulous work here from Skammer. And these great AI illustrated keyboards, AI hands and everything. Nice colors there too. Speaking of hasdrubal waffle, Hasdrubal pointed out no hygiene a few days ago, saying, you know, there's something going on with no hygiene.
01:01:01.054 - 01:01:29.080, Speaker A: And I think, and I think he's right. Like it's pretty interesting. And no hygiene has kept with this really interesting, really rough kind of AI video game. I've been watching it, you know, narratives, shall we say, or content. And I brought up their page kind of cryptic here, fashion. And you see like it's the whole thing is kind of cryptic, like you see here. And I think this is a lot of it is AI.
01:01:29.080 - 01:01:50.474, Speaker A: So this is the object page. And there is a ton of it, you know, again, pretty edgy looking, like 3d video game type stuff. 14 pages of it mints a ton. And here it is on Zora. And here is no hygiene on Zora. So more out here. And they are being minted here.
01:01:50.474 - 01:02:11.684, Speaker A: So just interesting, edgy, experimental AI work from no hygiene. So just interesting to check that out. This was tweeted out by Dina Chang. So this is the tangential, maybe by Helen Crispin on tea. And this looks sold out. Only two editions. Let's make it bigger.
01:02:11.684 - 01:02:33.590, Speaker A: I mean, again, pretty experimental stuff here. Kind of looks like a photo with some sort of digital collage on top, a lot of depth of field in the photo, and then some sort of patterning on top with a gradient. Again, bold, bold experimentalism, I'd call this. What is this called? Tangential. The gardener. Interesting. And this artist sent me a couple of works.
01:02:33.590 - 01:02:50.242, Speaker A: Not this one, but I thought this was really great. Invisible emotions. So they collaborated with paper doll. I thought, this is a pretty nice AI painting here. And Olivera Durdevic is the name of the artist. And here's another one. Fluid identities, an edition of 30.
01:02:50.242 - 01:03:07.450, Speaker A: And again, I think this one and another was sent to me. I thought, pretty nice, actually. And I don't send everything that's sent to me, but if I show a work, I will be transparent. Yeah, sent to a lot of people. So there you go. So I thought, pretty nice AI artwork here. AI painting.
01:03:07.450 - 01:03:33.742, Speaker A: I think it's AI, it doesn't specifically say, but they collaborated with paper doll, so I suspect. And just by the look of it, Mikey Wilson, you've got a friend. So a pretty cool work here by Mikey Wilson. And, yeah, just a couple of people in a cafe. Ambiguous who they are, wearing their kind of futuristic balaclavas. Again, an AI art painting. Very nice painting again.
01:03:33.742 - 01:03:56.000, Speaker A: And there you almost see a hakusai wave in the background there. Fabulous work. And color by Mikey Wilson and Okote. Our culture persists because it resists. I mean, this global south series is fabulous. I just feel like it's got the. It's captured the zeitgeist here.
01:03:56.000 - 01:04:18.630, Speaker A: There's something to say for that as we pass the 1 hour mark. We're almost done here. Look at just interesting, kind of very latin american colors, I would argue. Feel free to disagree, but kind of bright and a lot of reds and kind of yellows. Our culture persists because it resists. Anyways, fabulous topic here. Global south, I think again, just kind of hitting the zeitgeist here.
01:04:18.630 - 01:04:43.400, Speaker A: Edition of 13 for 250. There are four left. Great topic and actually achieving the executing on the topic quite well as well. Beautiful paintings and interesting portrayals. Danielle King as winter froze the life out of fall. An exploration of AI collage created with improps. So another beautiful work here by Danielle King.
01:04:43.400 - 01:05:17.458, Speaker A: As you can see, these awesome strips, again, it's hard to, it's sometimes easy to forget that this is AI that is doing these very human esque shapes here because it looks like a very nice kind of human painting. But this is AI. So again, the power of AI in beautiful color here. And so as winter froze the life out of fall, so maybe these are trees, one could argue. So almost like semi abstract and interesting. Just all this kind of brushwork here. One of 175 tezos.
01:05:17.458 - 01:05:49.376, Speaker A: Danielle King does it again. Exciting news ahead. Save the date. So tuks has been teasing us for a few weeks here and it continues with another beautiful piece, a still life with a painting in the background kind of almost turns into abstraction here. But you see a kind of a flowery plant, you see. But you do see a still life that's almost dripping into the chaos of the paint here. Dripping and, you know, bleeding into abstraction here with another little bit of representation here.
01:05:49.376 - 01:06:04.834, Speaker A: Interesting colors too, as usual. Evelyn o. Standing ovation in my private DM group, in my discord and on my Nakia beeper right now. So peace at sleep has been selected to be shown at NFT New York City. So big congrats to Evelyn O. And I think it's this one here. So very cool.
01:06:04.834 - 01:06:22.170, Speaker A: AI, I think, makes AI artwork. I'm pretty sure this is AI art and definitely. And here as well. So very painterly and very interesting. Working with distortions. AI distortions here and the body flowing into ink here. So very cool.
01:06:22.170 - 01:06:40.394, Speaker A: And look at the texture here as well. So nice work from Evelyn O. And congratulations. And what else did it say there? I thought it said something else on. Let me just. I thought I missed something there. Will be shown tomorrow.
01:06:40.394 - 01:06:57.798, Speaker A: SKU 1.5 on repeat will be shown in unknown collector 123 curation absence in the Patrick Amadon 404 show. Lesson to self, don't burn artworks you believe in if they sat six months on. Super rare. Indeed, indeed. Mister Bizzold. Labyrinth of brocaded chrysanthemum.
01:06:57.798 - 01:07:21.374, Speaker A: Chrysanthemums. Chrysanthemums. Digital painting by Mister Bissold. And this is AI, I believe all AI here. And so just interesting work, I thought, kind of an interesting double here. Interesting change of background and just interesting composition. Even the margins here, the beige margins on the side, addition of 425 tezos each.
01:07:21.374 - 01:07:55.054, Speaker A: Very cool. And here, clownvamp, I thought, had a pretty interesting piece here. It's on Instagram, so it's kind of small here, but interesting again, AI getting this kind of, almost this blood coming across the front of the image here. Almost as if it's glass. And there's some sort of kind of light, light red blood kind of splashed against the glass. And this person, you know, maybe behind the glass with their protective gear. And as we go into the physicals here, yoao Salazar, I'm shortening these shows.
01:07:55.054 - 01:08:12.232, Speaker A: That is my promise to you. Still life number two, minted 0.03. I actually thought it would be a short show today. So beautiful texture here. And another physical minted by Yoao, another Salazar. Nice piece. And there's the skeleton smoking at the computer with the warning sign.
01:08:12.232 - 01:08:37.810, Speaker A: And apple super textured. Pretty interesting here. What is the name of this artist? I don't see Palan Ding dong. Palan ding dong. Just an interesting piece I saw on Instagram kind of using these. These gradients are popular, aren't they? Just interesting. And of course, Catherine Bernhardt, major kind of contemporary artists and famous for these pink panthers.
01:08:37.810 - 01:08:54.986, Speaker A: It's interesting. There's video out there where you can watch her paint. Some of it just very loose, watery, big brushstrokes. Not too careful and you get pretty nice results. So this is gonna be at Art Shanghai, which opens November 9. So I guess last weekend. Mister McGrath.
01:08:54.986 - 01:09:12.104, Speaker A: So this is an interesting artist too. I have a few works by them. Pastel, oil pastel and acrylic on canvas. Like, nice work here. Again, another example of how there's just so much interesting artwork out here. Here's another one. This is graphite colored pencil and acrylic.
01:09:12.104 - 01:09:28.708, Speaker A: Again, just like there's a lot of nice art out there, isn't there? Here's another one. Walking hibernation. Small threats averted. So very interesting. I'm not sure. I think this person has a lot of followers. So let me just look here.
01:09:28.708 - 01:09:46.980, Speaker A: Yeah, 97,000 followers. So 3000 likes. Yeah. So they are making waves out there. Adam Forsyth studio gapeface snow ghoul. And how big are they? Only 3500 followers. So pretty interesting painting here.
01:09:46.980 - 01:10:04.984, Speaker A: Nicely done. Definitely gets your attention. And pretty original, isn't it? Interesting color too. I think neon's pretty interesting to use in contemporary painting. And of course, Donnie O'Donnell with another really cool work close up of what looks like a cat. Pet portrait commissions. So interesting business.
01:10:04.984 - 01:10:18.816, Speaker A: Look at these great flowers. Too edgy, making it look easy. And, of course, walk. Mmm. And look plain off of the emoji. And here I brought it up big. You see the wondery, the mastery of walking.
01:10:18.816 - 01:10:25.544, Speaker A: Delightful and great as usual. That's on Zora. And that is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
