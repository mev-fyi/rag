00:00:07.440 - 00:00:31.294, Speaker A: It's like going for coffee. It's your morning coffee with your friend, your digital friend. Adrian Pokebelly, artist, reporter. This is the artist journal, October 2, 2022. And my friends, I was fooled. I was fooled by this artist. I thought this was actually just a normal artist.
00:00:31.294 - 00:00:51.070, Speaker A: It's AI, a different take on AI. We will return to. Who is this ultramarine or something? Part of a series called Ultramarine Dream by someone who I think is anonymous. We will look at that. Just a couple of things. A couple of. Just go over what people are saying out there.
00:00:51.070 - 00:01:10.874, Speaker A: Hey there, Pokebelly. Is there a Tezos community in Berlin? I actually thought Tezos came out of Berlin. I mean, you see the logo? That's how the streets are. Like. It's kind of like. Like that's a letter that they use. So I thought there was like a tazoc.
00:01:10.874 - 00:01:31.470, Speaker A: I thought it was based out of Berlin. I don't know, even Polkadot, you know, Polkadot, by the way, a little known fact. I mean, I went down the rabbit hole on Polkadot. The cryptocurrency, that is probably one of the most exciting cryptocurrencies. I'm not here to shill it. I don't own any. Some are locked away.
00:01:31.470 - 00:02:01.060, Speaker A: Not many. But just so you know, that Gavin guy who co founded Ethereum, who was, like, basically programmed or created the scripting language, what is that called? Solidity. Of course, he's behind Polkadot. We all know that. I think they're based out of the web3 foundation. I think that's in Berlin. And just so you know, I mean, deep down the rabbit hole of many interviews, listening to this guy, the difference between Polkadot is his vision.
00:02:01.060 - 00:02:33.916, Speaker A: As far as I understand it, and I am not a tech expert, I have some understanding. It's going to be Felix. It can provide security where you don't need to charge fees. Okay. It's a base zero layer, and I think that's how it's being structured. So that is why it can provide security without the fees, is my understanding. And again, that was after, like, a two hour interview of many interviews I watched.
00:02:33.916 - 00:02:58.340, Speaker A: I only saw him say that once. But if you want Alpha, and who knows, these things could go to Polkadot, could go to $2 in the next. For the next seven years. Okay. So definitely not financial advice or anything, but just interesting is, you know, because fees, I mean, if you can just get rid of fees, that trumps everything. So just something, you know, we are kind of in. Without question.
00:02:58.340 - 00:03:37.594, Speaker A: We're in the crypto ecosystem that's how this is all taking place. So I did rent a movie theater at the back of a bar at Zedbar to put on a show in February. I don't even know what I'm going to show yet, and I just did it because it was cheap and easy. I know the bartender there, Constantine, he's actually given me a few shows. I was like, maybe we should do this. My girlfriend was saying, you should put this huge collection of nfts you've gathered, got some of them on display. So sooner or later I told Sherin Gan to message me.
00:03:37.594 - 00:04:10.094, Speaker A: Maybe we'll do something in October, you know, time permitting. But I'm sure one way or another we can all hang out, have a coffee iRl to discuss our favorite topic. Paul Sims is back with another interesting comment. I used to collect exclusively on ETH, but over the past year I've moved to 90% Tez art. Yeah, I totally relate. I mean, I only bought one thing on ETH because that was all I could afford. I enjoy the act of collecting and I can often pick up, pick up ten times as many pieces on Tez compared to ETH.
00:04:10.094 - 00:04:38.577, Speaker A: I mean that is the real attraction, isn't it? And not go down in art quality, right? I have a few Sol pieces. Interesting. I never went down that rabbit hole myself. We're going to see Redrum's actually genesis work on Sol, but haven't bought on Sol in six months at least. Interesting. Excluding ETH also helps my sanity by narrowing my pool of purchases. True, when I was buying on all chains, the choices were mentally overwhelming.
00:04:38.577 - 00:05:38.016, Speaker A: It's true if you just keep it to cheap and easy. That's what object, I mean, again, I keep saying how object deserves a lot of credit, okay? They are kind of invisible and their simple notification and follow mechanism for arts to me, like I don't know, the last time I used Facebook I stopped using it before I came to object. But I'm just saying like that. I mean, what is Facebook? It's sharing images. What is Instagram? It's sharing images. What is this? It's sharing created images, okay? And so that's the real disruptor. If Mark Zuckerberg, in my opinion, had any brains, and I'm sure he has some, don't get me wrong, I would be doing everything I can to acquire object and then I'd make it multi chain, okay? Because right now, finally on this front, I don't know of an ETH product like object like on OpenSea.
00:05:38.016 - 00:06:01.944, Speaker A: Can you follow followers and do you get notifications every time an artist like you get it on super rare. But that's just specific to the super rare platform. And so that's not enough. Like, I want to open c where I can follow all my favorite ETH artists, let's say, and then get notifications. Maybe that exists. Okay. But again, they make it look easy at object.
00:06:01.944 - 00:06:21.424, Speaker A: They're very, very smart. Nice comment from purple drank, now known as Drank Frazetta. Do you all know who Frank Frazetta is? We'll take a look here in a second when you get mentioned on Pokebelly's artist journal. Well, cheers and thanks. And that is very encouraging. And look at all those likes and everything. So I totally appreciate that, guys.
00:06:21.424 - 00:06:42.394, Speaker A: And while we're on the topic of multi chain and purple drank or drank Frazetta. Good morning, my friends. Part six is out. So this one you gotta be a little quicker on, so don't miss it. He's keeping you. Keep your notifications on purple drank there or keep following him. You got like a few hours to go here.
00:06:42.394 - 00:07:04.614, Speaker A: He put out a tweet at 640 this morning, which is 3 hours ago. I record these at like 930 in the morning. Just so you know. Berlin time, 11 hours left to pick up part six. And it's a classic, as all the others are. Let's look at Frank Frazetta very quickly because we've been talking about comic art. Frank Frazetta is very famous.
00:07:04.614 - 00:07:37.784, Speaker A: Yeah, savage sword of Conan, he did these covers. What I like about purple drank speed is he has a lot of comics in there, which again, I worked in a comic store, used bookstore for maybe they kind of started me early there at age 13. And I worked till I was maybe 17. It was a great job. And anyway, because, yeah, then I could just buy even more comics. So Frank Frazetta is pretty class. I mean, this is maybe one of the most famous kind of the Sci-Fi meets barbarian.
00:07:37.784 - 00:08:03.752, Speaker A: You know, it's kind of like these archetypes come out in science fiction. Like, this is almost like an archetype. Like, I mean, because it's sort of like this barbarian again, barbarian in space. And it's kind of a weird mix, but it just kind of feels right. One could argue even with these kind of Sci-Fi monsters. So who knows intimations of a future or a past somewhere out there? So that's Frank Frazetta. You should know him.
00:08:03.752 - 00:08:15.288, Speaker A: 1950s. He died, I think, about ten years ago. Let's just bring up Frank Frazetta, 82. Let's just see when he died. Yeah, 2010. There you go. Illustrator dies at 82.
00:08:15.288 - 00:08:39.068, Speaker A: Helped to find comic book heroes. Yeah, he was just a great, great, great illustrator. Continuing on. Okay, so we were talking about Alex Gray. And Morlacos put out this Hoffman, Pepe, Albert Hoffman, the creator of LSD. And I just wanted to show another Alex Gray influence. Really classic, beautiful work by Morlakos, as usual.
00:08:39.068 - 00:09:02.132, Speaker A: And we're looking at Alex Gray, probably the most famous, by far, visionary artists, I think is what they call them. And this is his portrait of Albert Hoffman. And you can see we were talking about Terrence McKenna the other episode. And pretty classic stuff here. I think you have, like the. We're talking about the beats and a former. And the hippies, the counterculture.
00:09:02.132 - 00:09:19.324, Speaker A: I think at first I thought this was Terrence McKenna here with the hat, but I think it's Allen Ginsburg. And you see John Lennon. I don't know if that's George Harrison. It doesn't look like all the Beatles made it. Robert Crumb. Okay, so he's starting to connect some dots. William Burroughs, the counterculture.
00:09:19.324 - 00:09:43.610, Speaker A: Okay, I'm not sure who this is. This looks like Princess Leia. So, yeah, so you have to ask an expert. And of course, you know, Alex Gray's trademark translucent skin. You know, he's really kind of. Obviously, he created and mastered this style. Usually the creators are the masters anyway, and just more heroes of, I think, the Shulgins.
00:09:43.610 - 00:10:05.148, Speaker A: And. Yeah, I'm not at total experts on everybody here. It'd almost be scary if I was. But anyways, so just. And we'll go back to more lack of work here. So you see, you know, you see this thing here, this flying thing, and then you see this flying thing here. So anyways, obviously a direct reference, but totally makes it his own in his own style.
00:10:05.148 - 00:10:27.128, Speaker A: So very cool. Gabby, Walter, remember we were talking about this? So there's some follow up news here. So selling the NFT, where you get the painting and that sold, it's an extra, extra special day for me. I just sold my first physical painting through object.com. The secret inner eyes. Sold for 230 XTC. Thank you.
00:10:27.128 - 00:10:57.888, Speaker A: Legojo seven for your support. So very interesting. I'm so happy right now. Thank you. So this is interesting because this is not what we're talking about with selling a picture as the NFT. He's basically using the digital marketplace to shop or to sell the painting. And so I think that's incredibly interesting because it's otherwise.
00:10:57.888 - 00:11:17.904, Speaker A: Where do you go with your physical paintings if you don't have a gallery and most artists don't have galleries, like, 95% of them. Where do you go? Okay, so it's kind of an interesting thing. I mean, one could imagine this could happen more. Moving on. Congratulations to Gabby there. Cool work. So just moving.
00:11:17.904 - 00:11:30.092, Speaker A: Just following this kind of cross chain narrative. Red rum. My genesis on form function is now live. Age of thousand eyes. Wait, you reserve at ten. Solana. I am very, very excited for this new adventure.
00:11:30.092 - 00:11:48.776, Speaker A: The red world will spread on Solana. So comedian a little bit. Looks really great, I have to say. You know, hopefully this doesn't crash my mic here. So pretty cool. So a nice genesis piece from redrum, age of a thousand eyes, one of one on Solana. So just kind of fun to watch that.
00:11:48.776 - 00:12:05.080, Speaker A: So let's go back here. Just this AI artist, Pauly Jojo, sent this to me. He sent a couple of artists. We're going to look at another one later on. Another AI artist. What kind of. I thought, like, what surprised me on this was I didn't realize it was AI.
00:12:05.080 - 00:13:06.884, Speaker A: And I was like, oh, this is a really good illustrator, you know, and I was looking at some of the other work, I was like, this is, you know, this is a pretty good illustrator. This one's not AI. Clear that it's AI at all, even though it says here again, raw AI. So this term, which seems to come from the artists themselves, I really like this term because it seems to suggest to me, and correct me out there if I'm wrong, it seems to suggest to me that this is AI that is not tampered with. Okay. And back to this, I think, clownvamp idea. And that I kind of jumped off of this idea that maybe it's better or that there's an aesthetic category or area space, an aesthetic space where we might think of some AI art that is not tampered with is in perhaps in some way superior, not the fact that it's not edited.
00:13:06.884 - 00:13:37.412, Speaker A: So again, a beautiful work here. Look at this. Look at the color. I mean, seriously, you could just take the gradient alone here, throw everything else out and start from scratch, some beach scene. And it'd probably be pretty nice because this gradient is so beautiful. Right, continuing on another one. So if you look close, you can see the wheel here, then you see the AI.
00:13:37.412 - 00:14:02.028, Speaker A: So again, this looks like synthwave meets these kind of 1950s travel posters or something. Ultramarine dream. Just wanted to point them out. And here you can see kind of, if you go on this one, you'll see there's a palm tree coming out of the car right here. If you can see that. See, it's coming right out of the car. Raw AI.
00:14:02.028 - 00:14:27.542, Speaker A: So some people might actually enjoy that. I mean, for me, before I realized it was AI, I thought, oh, that looks like a mistake. It was all going so well. I was thinking to myself, as far as this artist, and I was like, what's this about? And then I was like, is this AI? And then I figured it out. Look at this sun, though. Like, I'm kind of back to. I'm kind of meeting this whole raw AI thing halfway.
00:14:27.542 - 00:14:49.774, Speaker A: I say, okay, here, we could debate it. Okay, is it surreal? It's just a palm tree coming out of a car. But here, let's just, for the sake of argument, say, okay, we don't want this one because it's coming out of the car. It screws it up. For the sake of argument, these here, it looks a little screwed up. The hubcaps. The sun, maybe we keep.
00:14:49.774 - 00:15:26.124, Speaker A: Right? I go, that's an original sun, and maybe we keep the sun. So I'm kind of back to this idea of maybe it's better to edit the AI, you know? And there's more. It's, as we say, with the design, there are right and wrong answers, but there is more than one right answer here. So I'm not saying this is how it has to be, but these are the thoughts that cross my mind as I kind of look at this. I go, ooh. You know, it's so simple, the shape here. But sometimes simple is revolutionary.
00:15:26.124 - 00:15:45.862, Speaker A: Okay? Like, I would never dream of doing a son like this. And that's what makes me so excited. Okay, so, anyway, so just an AI artist that Pauli Jojo sent. He sent another one a few days ago, which I finally got to. Let's get to this other. This Henry union business, though. I.
00:15:45.862 - 00:16:07.614, Speaker A: I've never profiled a work by. I think his name is. Let me just check the name properly here, John. A lot of j's there. He is probably one of the most, you know, old school, original ogs of the whole Tezos scene. I mean, he's got a huge market. This is probably one of my favorite works that he's done.
00:16:07.614 - 00:16:29.792, Speaker A: I wish I could have picked this up. Now it's like. I think it's 250. I love this work, actually. It uses. He does these trademark windows, and these windows still lives, which he's basically famous for on this platform. I mean, the demand he sells, like, you know, I don't want to load up too many of these, like, 591 Tez.
00:16:29.792 - 00:16:47.024, Speaker A: Like, this is typical for him. Another alarm clock, so you can kind of see quickly. I should be looking at this on object so it doesn't crash my computer. But a really, really nice work here. I just think it's cool. I would have loved to pick that up. Let's look at the history here.
00:16:47.024 - 00:17:20.910, Speaker A: Wow. So did they all just go for 250? I'm not sure if that's right. Listing collect for 250 tez. So, yeah, I mean, all to say, if you don't know who this is, like, I don't have any John work. I keep on. I want to get, like, just a few, one of those few editions of a thousand, just to kind of round out my collection, because it is a whole. If you don't have him in your collection of, you know, just as far as the history of tazos, here's a sky goodman that came out, which I thought was kind of interesting.
00:17:20.910 - 00:17:49.120, Speaker A: You can still get it. I think his work sells out pretty quick, actually. By the time you watch this, you probably won't be able to get it. So just this kind of like what I like to call digitalia, just kind of like digital vibes. I mean, he uses a few different tools created in virtual reality, textured with video feedback, rendered in blender. I'm a big fan of exporting in digital and just using multiple tools, not just one. Huge, huge, huge fan.
00:17:49.120 - 00:18:29.880, Speaker A: That's when I decided in my own mind that the iPhone six s was the first art phone, because it was the first phone with time that you had multiple apps, and you could export really easily, go back and forth, and the world is your oyster at that point. So I really like how he uses several tools. I think that's, to me, it's just exciting as an artist. A work by Echo, who's also a sabato. So just a glitch rom along this sega genesis kind of environmental theme, I think so just kind of interesting. Echo, the dolphin extinction. Okay, now, I think this is also poly.
00:18:29.880 - 00:18:47.320, Speaker A: Jojo sent this to me yesterday. Just a geometric artist that I'd never seen before. Excuse me. Kind of interesting. Kind of like a Bridget Riley AwP art with some nice colors. It's a nice piece. You know what I like also, which is kind of maybe sounds simplistic.
00:18:47.320 - 00:19:09.814, Speaker A: I really like the margin. It's like this light green, and it really just helps make the piece kind of. It just makes it nice. I don't know. It just gives it some room to breathe because it's a pretty complex piece. If you imagine getting rid of the light green margin, it's like a passepartout on a frame. That kind of thing that goes around the image in a big frame.
00:19:09.814 - 00:19:31.160, Speaker A: I think you call that a passepartout. A little bit of french here today. So anyways, just an interesting artist, Cato, that I'd never seen before. Again, thank you, poly jojo, for sending that. We see similarities here with. I'm trying to remember the name of the artist, but we've seen an artist who is similar with the geometric stuff. The name escapes me right now.
00:19:31.160 - 00:19:43.004, Speaker A: Yeah, especially here. So interesting. You could put them in the same room. I wish I could remember the name of that other artist. It's not loading up. We're not going to worry about it. Atelier 407, friendzone.
00:19:43.004 - 00:20:01.434, Speaker A: So another work for the hen reunion event. Let's just look at that here. It kind of looks like that other piece we were looking at the other day. But maybe just like a remix. Let me see. So we have some interesting eight bedou work here. Kind of reminds me of this.
00:20:01.434 - 00:20:16.968, Speaker A: Right. We started just the other day with this work. So there's this one. And we go here. So just like a variation, really. But again, almost a series that you could put. Put side by side or something like that.
00:20:16.968 - 00:20:46.356, Speaker A: So atelier 407, did this sell out? No. 70 to go, so you can pick that up. This is another artist I just kind of saw on Twitter. I didn't know anything about them. We'll see if this loads up. Sort of having issues a little bit, the Internet. So just kind of an interesting, strange video work that I thought we could just touch on.
00:20:46.356 - 00:21:09.284, Speaker A: Zach Lloyd never really heard. Oh, you always want to kind of bring in new blood here, because if we always talk about the same ten artists, well, that's not cool, is it? And you guys will. It's not going to be as exciting for everybody else, too. So also part of the hen reunion. Let's just kill that plants. P L a n T Z. Another artist.
00:21:09.284 - 00:21:31.180, Speaker A: So what's kind of cool about this is you're seeing all these artists kind of come out of the woodwork with this Henry union thing. So it is great for discovery. And here you see just these different kinds of plants. Interesting. Kind of pixelated plant work. Very interesting. What is it called? Cactus and succulents.
00:21:31.180 - 00:21:53.124, Speaker A: See, this is the Tezos logo I was telling you about. A lot of street signs in Berlin or in Germany have that kind of look or have that letter character. Okay. Which is why I thought, oh, maybe Tezos is out of Germany. And I thought I saw something about it being in Berlin. Anyways, here's pixelfool. We were looking.
00:21:53.124 - 00:22:22.214, Speaker A: Have we looked at pixel fool yet? I think we did very, very strong market. One of the kind of top, what I call in the animated abstract genre and really, really strong market 333. I was like, oh, I have all day to pick this up, but maybe I should just get it now. I think it was six tezos, and it's already sold out. Like an hour later. It was 666 333. That's insane.
00:22:22.214 - 00:22:46.364, Speaker A: So these people, like John and Pixelfool, who have been around the platform and have just like a million followers, see how powerful that is. Like, that's. I don't know if that's. If they sold all 333, but if they did, that's 1800 tezos. Okay. Gift generated by custom software by Pixelfool. Okay.
00:22:46.364 - 00:23:12.500, Speaker A: Really, really nice piece. You know, a little detail that I like here is this kind of flashing thing with the red following the blue. And I just like how it's. That's a little detail that it's flashing different colors. I just like that detail. So you see why Pixel fool has a lot of collectors. Peels is another animated abstract artist, artist who does animated abstract works who is very popular.
00:23:12.500 - 00:23:27.272, Speaker A: Depression rainbow. There's always a bit of a depressing title. So this is a new work. We'll see how it did. Again, these kind of old school tezos artists. October 1. Yeah, seven for 130.
00:23:27.272 - 00:23:43.008, Speaker A: Let's just see how many of. Let's see how many are left. I mean, feels work. Okay, so nothing. So already sold like three of them, though, for 130. Minted yesterday. So feels has a very, very strong market.
00:23:43.008 - 00:24:05.188, Speaker A: I mean, 130 for each one. That's $200 each for addition. So. Okay, so continuing on, side hustle put out a kind of a celebration piece. And we know side hustle from his cubes, pixel nachos. So just kind of an interesting kind of fun celebration hen forever. Another one from Kristen Ruse.
00:24:05.188 - 00:24:23.344, Speaker A: Buy for 20, edition of 100. Is that the mint price? No, the mint price is five. So even still, I mean, 500 tezos. Boom. For Kristin Ruskin. For another animated abstract created using Deneba ultra paint and deluxe paint. Four.
00:24:23.344 - 00:24:36.684, Speaker A: We didn't look at this yesterday. We looked at another one. I feel like we looked. We looked at another one. We looked at this one yesterday. So here's a color one. An illustrator who I'd never heard of Galliputra.
00:24:36.684 - 00:25:07.264, Speaker A: Galliputra is selling these kind of like in the psychedelic illustration camp, like ouiyo and skitchism. And there's a couple of more. So just an interesting work for one tez edition of 100, part of the hen reunion. This was just a weird one. Berlin interior wall. So maybe trapers is in Berlin. So let's just.
00:25:07.264 - 00:25:36.954, Speaker A: So just kind of an interesting kind of illustration with a little bit of animation. Someone's spray painting. Just interesting. Almost looks like some Sort of blotter thing going on with this graph Paper in the background. Another cloudnoise pixel. Interesting. Like, to me, these look like the glitch ROM shapes that are being kind of turned into abstractions.
00:25:36.954 - 00:25:54.356, Speaker A: That's what it looks like to me. It looks like Glitch Rom, like those Nintendo ROM, like that Haiti does and that we saw Sabato or Echo do there. So cloud noise released this. Love these two colors together. I think we've even talked about these colors together before. I use these colors together. I dig it up here.
00:25:54.356 - 00:26:12.318, Speaker A: I have a screen memory work that is. Maybe I'll dig it up another time. It's blue and orange. So anyways, I love these colors. So I actually think as simple as this is, this is a pretty nice abstract work, in my opinion. For one tazos. Again, great color.
00:26:12.318 - 00:26:37.096, Speaker A: And that's all they have here. So I don't know if they're just starting, which is totally possible. Visual artist, creative coder. Another hen almost have too many works in here. So I'm trying to keep these things. I'm going to try and shorten these a little bit because I know you guys don't have all day to watch new images here, but just kind of, there's a lot out there right now. Some days it's quiet, and we'll keep those, those videos short.
00:26:37.096 - 00:27:11.036, Speaker A: So just interesting here from Amanda homem. Anthurium sold out Newark from Adelia. Again, you don't get the notification with Adelia now, so you probably have to be in her discord to get the notification. I missed it again, and she's kind of got this WhatsApp, she calls it. What's up? This is part of our new pop series now. This is part of the Picante. It's almost like there's a side festival, the Picante challenge here, she calls it.
00:27:11.036 - 00:27:43.814, Speaker A: So you're seeing a bunch of artists do Picante works, like, red hot, and she's eating hot sauce and, you know, jalapeno peppers. So anyway, what did she sell this for? Three. And now it's going for $6.99 two days later. Let's see, what else. Rat cloak see has an auction again, his painting style with these finger paintings, phone paintings, whatever we want to call them. Continues to just turn my head.
00:27:43.814 - 00:28:26.818, Speaker A: Very interesting. He's continuing with this kind of, like, it reminds me of cubism in the sense that you kind of have more than one time scale is one way of looking at it. Like, you could imagine the leg is here, and then 10 seconds later the leg is here. And that kind of is reminiscent of cubism or it's like the metamorphosis, where people are literally, surrealistically growing another leg. There's also this kind of, you know, what that person yesterday was calling the Nightcrawler figure, which is almost kind of useful for our purposes. Kind of a reminds me of the invisible man. Again, is this a literary illusion? So, again, a very beautiful work.
00:28:26.818 - 00:28:54.494, Speaker A: Moody and a lot going on and slightly haunted. What are we at here? Already at 42 tezos, and you still have another 10 hours to go, so this could go for a pretty penny. Speaking of three legs, I thought we'd bring this in because there's a Lorna Mills with three legs, and she releases a lot of work. Most of it is not family friendly. So I. I just picked the family friend. I don't know if this is family friendly.
00:28:54.494 - 00:29:22.152, Speaker A: One could make the argument it's not. Lucky Jin Bo, you can buy for 15 edition of 25 new Kurt Hussle collective. So there's just like. Again, this is 24 hours, guys, of, like, kind of like, interesting work to comment on here. I'm racing through it. So he has this doughnutter in a boxing ring. And if you get that, I believe you get the phone screensaver.
00:29:22.152 - 00:29:46.208, Speaker A: Crt amigos. So it seems to be a new series, CrT amigos. And my favorite, I think, was this guy, the garbage patch Perry. Almost like cabbage patch kids, but garbage patch Perry going around in circles here. So always fun at the Kurt hustle collective, and always interesting. Always fun. Hopefully a commercial he put out.
00:29:46.208 - 00:30:05.512, Speaker A: I should have brought this up. Maybe I'll bring it up tomorrow. This airline, DBO Airlines, I can't wait for that to be released, if that's going to be released. This is an AI artist that paulijo sent me also a couple of days ago. Look for one tezos. I might have picked this up. And one of ones for one tezos.
00:30:05.512 - 00:30:31.306, Speaker A: That are pretty interesting. I mean, and you see how many there are, and you see a lot are still for sale here. I think I did a recent. Yeah, like, I mean, so there are a lot. Sometimes the white hoods are a little unsettling. I mean, I don't know if the artist kind of understands the reference, depending like, who knows where they're from. I mean, at first it looks like nuns, right? So let's like, like I always say, assume the best.
00:30:31.306 - 00:31:23.208, Speaker A: That's what all the great coaches, the Brian Tracy's, for all of you that are having issues, say, with just dealing with people, Brian Tracy is your guy. We'll bring up Brian Tracy in a future episode. But he has some great, just practical phranesis is the greek word practical wisdom, how to deal with people. Brian Tracy, the great Brian Tracy. Why are we talking about Brian Tracy anyways? So, yeah, here is an AI artist who is interesting with really cheap one of ones, a little unsettling the white hoods, like, especially here. So I kind of recoil from buying that, even though it's like. But I think I picked up this one because it reminded me of a Magritte and I don't think there's anything, again, assume the best.
00:31:23.208 - 00:31:49.504, Speaker A: That's why we're talking about Brian Tracy. This kind of has a Magritte vibe to it. So I picked this up. I mean, a tazos, cool and not too controversial in a way that I don't want, want to be to. Here is Fernand Times Pierre Auguste by Danielle King. We've been following Danielle King's AI works, where she's just doing simple mixes of artists. So again, Fernand Leger and Renoir.
00:31:49.504 - 00:32:24.320, Speaker A: I find these really interesting. I just find them very interesting because you're starting to see, like, art styles that could totally, that totally work in the modern context, like, in terms of modern art. You know, let's call it 1900 to 1930, for lack of better term or so. Yeah, I just, I find her work very interesting to watch. I'm not buying it, but I'm enjoying it. Joe Rogan's dad, it turns out, has a knack for fashion design. Who knew? So some more AI fashion here.
00:32:24.320 - 00:32:56.206, Speaker A: Very interesting, right? I mean, again, like, if I was a fashion designer, I would be all over this AI thing and I would be concerned, right? Because what happens when, you know, all, son, Joe Rogan's dad is going to be, you know, we're going to hear about Paris Fashion week featuring Joe Rogan's day. Joe Rogan's dad. Right. So just very interesting. Look at the shoes here. Look at, just like this interesting thing. What if you had the Nike logo like that, you know, or whatever that is, and look at the materials.
00:32:56.206 - 00:34:24.104, Speaker A: I mean, look at the bagginess here and the tightness here. Like, I mean, it's just fascinating. AI fashion and a couple of works probably put too many works in this episode I'm going to probably draw it down but this is by I am the astra just a physical work ink on paper as an nft I do like to just profile these things just so that we're aware how much is that going for not cheap 25 55 was that the mint price mint price was $15.55 and now actually also by I am the asteroid 25.55 for the rest okay so that is matrimonial so marriage pretty cool work not to forget to talk about the work good looking work and another physical work done on tezos I think we did I bring up and then another kind of racing through these a little bit so apologies to the artists by rialt t so you can just find that on twitter and on tea or object and six issue of sloth is now out so just another NFT magazine okay fascinating featuring artists so I'm going to let that load up on its own. Thank you for joining me today. Until next time, take care.
