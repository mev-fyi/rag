00:00:34.054 - 00:01:13.574, Speaker A: He's one of the most versatile, enigmatic, and prolific artists in the NFT space, portraying profound topics in his signature pixel art style. Today we're talking to Kappan to find out more about the mind behind the figments, plants and pixels projects on the Tezos blockchain. Artist Journal, July 26, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show rune tune. How is your week going?
00:01:15.794 - 00:01:22.570, Speaker B: Good morning. My week is nothing. Nothing too terribly special to report, but it's good.
00:01:22.642 - 00:01:23.762, Speaker C: Glad to be here again.
00:01:23.898 - 00:01:24.854, Speaker D: How are you?
00:01:25.314 - 00:01:47.424, Speaker A: I am doing well. You know, sometimes no news is good news. Right. And I'm a creature of habit and I love my routine. And so, to your point, sometimes nothing is good. I've had so much change moving apartments that today I went to the gym for the first time in like ten days, and it just felt so good to get back to a routine. So it's kind of funny.
00:01:47.424 - 00:02:02.532, Speaker A: Like, I almost had these allergies that were starting to crop up. Maybe it was the heat and stuff was in the air and they all just kind of disappeared for the most part after going to the gym. So I'm doing much better. I'm doing good, and I am super thrilled to be here.
00:02:02.628 - 00:02:07.584, Speaker B: Oh, yeah. I was just. I know how those allergies can be when you're in the middle of a move.
00:02:08.084 - 00:02:09.100, Speaker A: Do you?
00:02:09.292 - 00:02:17.652, Speaker B: Yeah, it's something about moving all those, but, you know, just getting into all your belongings that have been maybe like sitting, you know.
00:02:17.828 - 00:02:18.156, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:02:18.180 - 00:02:24.740, Speaker B: I had a co worker a few months ago who went through a move and their face was just like, messed up for two weeks.
00:02:24.892 - 00:02:36.694, Speaker A: You know, I almost have a theory. Like, it's the dots, you know, you're cleaning. Yeah, 100%. I think I got a bunch of dust in my lungs and I think I've just had.
00:02:36.814 - 00:02:39.702, Speaker B: You've been coughing a little bit on the artist journal.
00:02:39.838 - 00:02:48.630, Speaker A: Exactly. Like, I wonder if it's just the cough of my, you know, of my possessions taken from my possessions, the dust on my possessions.
00:02:48.782 - 00:02:51.350, Speaker C: Get rid of. Yeah.
00:02:51.502 - 00:03:30.414, Speaker A: And now I'm just actually getting rid of it all. To your point, I'm getting rid of, like, I am really putting a scrutinizing eye on everything I have as before putting it away in the new place. Because if I have to move out, let's say, you know, in a few months, like, I don't want to go through that again. I just want to pick up and leave. I'm almost like, you know, I have a little bit of furniture. Not much, but it's like, I'd rather just buy new furniture and know that's not cost effective. It's not like I'm drowning in money or anything, but I think I'd almost rather do that next time than, you know, all of this moving stuff around, mattresses, all that sort of stuff.
00:03:30.414 - 00:03:33.438, Speaker A: So, yeah, thrilled that that's kind of wrapping up. I think that's.
00:03:33.526 - 00:03:38.434, Speaker B: That's probably a common attitude in, you know, major metropolitan areas.
00:03:39.374 - 00:03:53.640, Speaker A: Probably. I mean, it's just like, you know what it's like. You're in New York. I mean, it's kind of part of the business of living in these places is oftentimes you have to move. I mean, unless you get lucky. You know, just things happen. There's movement.
00:03:53.640 - 00:04:13.928, Speaker A: So, anyway, I am thrilled that Kappen has come on the show here. I didn't know if he would. I mean, he's kind of a bit of a. As I was saying in the intro there, a bit of an enigmatic figure. And so I'm actually just thrilled that he decided to come on, Cap. And how was your week going? We just lost Captain Curious. He's requesting to be back on.
00:04:14.016 - 00:04:15.224, Speaker C: Let me just put them on.
00:04:15.384 - 00:04:25.456, Speaker A: Captain, you are back. Can you hear me? And how is your week going? The suspense is off the charts as to what Kappin will sound like. Kapn, welcome to the show.
00:04:25.600 - 00:04:31.672, Speaker E: Hi, guys. Sorry, I had some problem with x. I was hearing, like, two spaces at the same time.
00:04:31.808 - 00:04:33.124, Speaker C: How's everyone going?
00:04:33.504 - 00:04:34.400, Speaker A: Doing well.
00:04:34.512 - 00:04:35.120, Speaker E: Great.
00:04:35.272 - 00:05:00.754, Speaker A: Yeah, I feel you're. Yeah, last week, we had unknown collector on, and nobody was joining the space, so there's, like, a massive glitch, and so I had to restart it. But all those people that, you know, put in the reminder, none of them got, so. Yeah, I hear you. I think there are things going on with Twitter spaces, so fingers crossed today. Kevin, what country are you calling from? And you don't need to tell us if you don't want to.
00:05:00.834 - 00:05:03.250, Speaker C: I'm from Costa Rica, Adrian.
00:05:03.442 - 00:05:09.592, Speaker A: Oh, cool. Yeah, very cool. I just love how international this scene is. And are you from Costa Rica?
00:05:09.698 - 00:05:11.784, Speaker E: I am from, and I live on.
00:05:12.724 - 00:05:13.236, Speaker C: Cool.
00:05:13.300 - 00:05:22.532, Speaker A: You know, I've heard really good things about Costa Rica. Like, it's. You know how I've heard it described is the Switzerland of. I guess it's Central America, isn't it?
00:05:22.668 - 00:05:29.884, Speaker E: They say that here as well. I doubt it, but, yeah, that's slogan that we have here.
00:05:29.924 - 00:05:33.588, Speaker C: The Suisa centromericana, basically, yeah.
00:05:33.636 - 00:05:49.070, Speaker A: I mean, it's good marketing. Although Switzerland is a remarkably expensive country. I've only been to the airport there, but just there, I mean, I was pretty shocked and amazed what a bottle of water will cost you in Costa Rica as well. Yeah.
00:05:49.262 - 00:05:53.238, Speaker E: Recently, prices of everything have raised a lot.
00:05:53.326 - 00:05:54.806, Speaker C: Like, everything's getting expensive.
00:05:54.870 - 00:05:56.286, Speaker E: I think it's global, right?
00:05:56.390 - 00:06:00.634, Speaker C: Not just Costa Rica, but it's not what it used to be.
00:06:01.254 - 00:06:04.114, Speaker E: I know it's a global market economy.
00:06:04.974 - 00:06:09.112, Speaker B: What are the laws around cryptocurrencies in Costa Rica?
00:06:09.248 - 00:06:13.084, Speaker C: There's none, man. There are none. No living free.
00:06:14.344 - 00:06:20.024, Speaker E: Basically, when I first started doing crypto, I started trading a little by the.
00:06:20.104 - 00:06:24.672, Speaker C: Beginning of 2021, and I encountered some.
00:06:24.728 - 00:06:28.976, Speaker E: Troubles with withdrawaling my money and that with the bank.
00:06:29.040 - 00:06:37.892, Speaker C: But it was soon fixed. I don't know what happened. Probably some rich guy contacted some bankers.
00:06:37.948 - 00:06:39.076, Speaker E: And said, hey, what's going on?
00:06:39.100 - 00:06:41.628, Speaker C: I need my crypto to be withdrawable.
00:06:41.716 - 00:06:44.468, Speaker B: Right, but you said that was back in 2021.
00:06:44.556 - 00:06:48.092, Speaker E: Yeah, around, let's say, August 2021.
00:06:48.148 - 00:06:57.964, Speaker C: I was trying to withdraw some little games I did with some shit coins I was playing. But yeah, yeah, it was not an issue.
00:06:58.004 - 00:06:58.652, Speaker E: It was something.
00:06:58.708 - 00:07:04.272, Speaker C: I think banks were not ready for this trading activity, let's say.
00:07:04.368 - 00:07:06.464, Speaker E: Because I know people trade here, not.
00:07:06.504 - 00:07:17.284, Speaker C: So much into the NFT scene, but they do trade, trying to make some quick grabs or an eventual pension or everything.
00:07:18.904 - 00:07:57.188, Speaker A: It really is a global casino. And the funny thing about it is, it's not like, like I say that almost endearingly, like, I love it. I absolutely love crypto. Like, I mean, not all of it, but I mean, for the most part, I just love the idea of these tokens you can buy and sell, you know, just from your little metamask or whatever you're using binance, you know, it's a lot of fun. So when did you get into crypto then? Was it fairly recently? Then was it the 2021 bull market where a lot of people, like, I think I came in 2020, kind of like at the start of that bull market. Is that basically end when you came in as well?
00:07:57.356 - 00:07:59.836, Speaker E: I came in, in around, yes, let's.
00:07:59.860 - 00:08:02.956, Speaker C: Say February, March 2021.
00:08:03.060 - 00:08:07.660, Speaker E: I started my sister's ex husband. She.
00:08:07.852 - 00:08:08.300, Speaker D: He.
00:08:08.372 - 00:08:10.068, Speaker C: I mean, he contacted me.
00:08:10.116 - 00:08:12.236, Speaker E: He had some. Hey, dude, let's trade.
00:08:12.300 - 00:08:12.868, Speaker C: Let's.
00:08:12.996 - 00:08:16.204, Speaker E: I'm going to teach you to do this. And I started doing that, then I.
00:08:16.244 - 00:08:21.344, Speaker C: Started doing crypto in my real life work as well. I work for.
00:08:23.654 - 00:08:28.046, Speaker E: Online gambling company here in Costa Rica, totally unrelated to art.
00:08:28.110 - 00:08:41.634, Speaker C: But that's my real life gig to sort of put it in a way. But yeah, I started doing crypto around March and then I stumbled with hen at around June.
00:08:43.574 - 00:08:45.390, Speaker E: It was pretty synchronized.
00:08:45.462 - 00:08:51.294, Speaker C: I don't know, like it was meant to be for. For me to dive into these waters.
00:08:51.994 - 00:09:10.978, Speaker A: I think so. And I mean, what's really impressive about what you've told me already is you have a. Is it a full time job and you're still very prolific. I mean, you have several projects that you're kind of constantly releasing stuff. And I admire it. Cause like, I struggle with the time issue and. Yeah, I mean.
00:09:10.978 - 00:09:12.726, Speaker A: So you are working full time?
00:09:12.890 - 00:09:18.606, Speaker E: Yeah, I do work full time, yes. I actually have today's shift at 10:00 a.m.
00:09:18.670 - 00:09:21.634, Speaker C: It's 730 at 07:40 a.m.
00:09:21.974 - 00:09:30.774, Speaker E: But yeah, I get time for art and for music as well. I played with several rock bands here as well.
00:09:30.814 - 00:09:32.154, Speaker C: I play bass guitar.
00:09:32.574 - 00:09:33.662, Speaker A: Oh, very cool.
00:09:33.758 - 00:09:35.074, Speaker B: And what kind of bands?
00:09:35.734 - 00:09:38.698, Speaker C: Sorry, what kind of bands did you say?
00:09:38.886 - 00:09:45.362, Speaker E: I played with heavy rock bands, to put it some way. Actually, if you go to my object.
00:09:45.458 - 00:09:49.746, Speaker C: Or hand main account, my captain or.
00:09:49.770 - 00:09:51.746, Speaker E: The Chicojam, whatever you want to call.
00:09:51.770 - 00:10:03.930, Speaker C: It, my very first mint. It's the very last song I composed, recorded and played with the previous band I played.
00:10:04.002 - 00:10:06.976, Speaker E: It was called Bat Smoke and the Astral Haze.
00:10:07.090 - 00:10:20.356, Speaker C: It was a heavy psychedelic rock and roll band. Well, not rock and roll like psychedelic rock. Yeah, stoner, to put it in a more general.
00:10:20.500 - 00:10:22.908, Speaker A: Yeah, speak our language here, captain. Exactly.
00:10:22.956 - 00:10:23.404, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:23.524 - 00:10:24.624, Speaker A: Yes. But.
00:10:26.564 - 00:10:27.180, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:10:27.292 - 00:10:32.184, Speaker E: And now I play with a, let's say, kind of experimental progressive band called.
00:10:33.734 - 00:10:39.034, Speaker C: It'S a really cool project I started last year with three other guys.
00:10:39.894 - 00:10:45.714, Speaker B: You're a busy guy, full time job, you're in bands, you're prolific on object.
00:10:47.774 - 00:10:53.574, Speaker A: It's great. And so when do you work then on art? Were you basically saying you do it in the morning?
00:10:53.694 - 00:11:00.502, Speaker C: Is that how you make the time? I work in between my free time.
00:11:00.598 - 00:11:03.046, Speaker E: At work, actually, I work from home.
00:11:03.110 - 00:11:03.814, Speaker C: That's good, right?
00:11:03.854 - 00:11:04.670, Speaker A: Okay.
00:11:04.862 - 00:11:06.966, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I had to clarify that.
00:11:06.990 - 00:11:08.006, Speaker C: I work from home.
00:11:08.150 - 00:11:12.646, Speaker E: So when I'm not doing shit about work, I'm doing art or playing bass.
00:11:12.710 - 00:11:14.834, Speaker C: Or walking my dog.
00:11:15.374 - 00:11:45.884, Speaker A: Well, I think everybody is doing that. Or at least, you know, doing laundry or going to the grocery store. It's kind of like the new paradigm. That's why nobody wants to go back to the office, sort of because you're probably delivering what you delivered before. You're just not wasting a bunch of time in the office like before. I mean, I remember when I used to work in an office ten years ago, I mean, half the day you're just waiting for it to end, surfing the Internet, you know, like, I mean, you just, I didn't have that much to do and nobody was paying me enough to go and like start new projects, you know?
00:11:46.224 - 00:11:47.764, Speaker E: Yes, I totally understand.
00:11:48.384 - 00:11:59.964, Speaker A: So yeah, just as far as your background in art then, did you start making art when you with crypto or did you kind of go to art school? Like, how did that all start?
00:12:00.324 - 00:12:02.820, Speaker E: Okay, well, I started doing art as.
00:12:02.852 - 00:12:04.244, Speaker C: A very young kid.
00:12:04.404 - 00:12:09.780, Speaker E: My older sister, she's like 45 right now. I'm 32.
00:12:09.812 - 00:12:10.624, Speaker D: By the way.
00:12:13.084 - 00:12:14.420, Speaker E: She'S a very prolific.
00:12:14.492 - 00:12:37.194, Speaker C: Ceramist here and art teacher. And she's just a super creative mind, super inspiring person. As for me growing up towards art, I mean, she always took me to art fairs and to her group meetings and all that stuff. So I was heavily influenced by that.
00:12:37.274 - 00:12:42.394, Speaker E: I used to draw and create my silly comics and my notebooks and high.
00:12:42.434 - 00:12:46.362, Speaker C: School and that stuff never really got into it.
00:12:46.418 - 00:12:49.134, Speaker E: I've always been more of a music guy.
00:12:50.114 - 00:12:51.738, Speaker C: Cause I don't know, music.
00:12:51.866 - 00:12:55.750, Speaker E: What that first art that really touched my heart, put it some way.
00:12:55.782 - 00:13:07.774, Speaker C: And I said, I want to do this. And then around 2011, 2012 or something like that, I fucked my knee.
00:13:07.854 - 00:13:09.870, Speaker E: So I had to stay like three.
00:13:09.902 - 00:13:26.050, Speaker C: Or four months in my parents place. I was just playing station, ripping bong ribs and learning stuff on the computer. And I learned the basics for creating.
00:13:26.082 - 00:13:26.774, Speaker D: A game.
00:13:29.154 - 00:13:32.866, Speaker A: That early. So you kind of got onto the.
00:13:32.930 - 00:13:36.378, Speaker C: Yeah, sorry, go ahead, go ahead.
00:13:36.466 - 00:13:38.466, Speaker E: I just wanted to like, oh, how.
00:13:38.490 - 00:13:39.650, Speaker C: Did they do this?
00:13:39.842 - 00:13:41.934, Speaker E: I know, I have always been very.
00:13:44.194 - 00:13:45.498, Speaker C: Curious, right?
00:13:45.626 - 00:13:51.052, Speaker E: I had an old pc back then and I installed Linux and I started.
00:13:51.108 - 00:13:54.724, Speaker C: Like trying out stuff and I stumbled.
00:13:54.764 - 00:13:59.476, Speaker E: With game and then I was like, how do they do gifs? And I learned how to make a.
00:13:59.500 - 00:14:09.156, Speaker C: Gif, shitty gif, to be honest. But moving images, right? And I was very proud of that. Then I recovered from my knee injury.
00:14:09.300 - 00:14:12.060, Speaker E: I started this band bat smoke that.
00:14:12.092 - 00:14:23.232, Speaker C: I was talking about, about. And yeah, so the basis comes from really long time ago, more than ten years.
00:14:23.408 - 00:14:32.952, Speaker E: And yes, then came the nfTs. Actually it was my friend Tater Tots who is around. He told me, hey dude, have you.
00:14:32.968 - 00:14:48.580, Speaker C: Ever heard about nfts? Cause in your crypto. And here we are. I started creating pixel art scenes. I don't know, for some reason I've always been drawn to it. I love Super Nintendo games.
00:14:48.772 - 00:14:51.460, Speaker E: So yeah, I'm stuck in that 16.
00:14:51.532 - 00:14:54.700, Speaker C: Bit era or something interesting.
00:14:54.772 - 00:15:12.004, Speaker A: And I love the video game connection. Of course. I'm totally just. Yeah, almost. It's obvious in retrospect, but it took me about a year to figure that out. Just the connection there. And so how early then was the pixel art? Was that basically when you were starting the gifts, or did that come like five years later?
00:15:16.184 - 00:15:23.160, Speaker E: The very first gifs I made for this space can be found on my.
00:15:23.192 - 00:15:29.016, Speaker C: Version profile, but I don't know.
00:15:29.160 - 00:15:31.652, Speaker E: The very first project I did for the.
00:15:31.708 - 00:15:39.540, Speaker C: For hen actually was the test faces that they dictate. Test faces, the, like, the ones trashcape.
00:15:39.572 - 00:15:40.644, Speaker E: Is rocking right now.
00:15:40.724 - 00:15:41.784, Speaker C: You've seen those.
00:15:42.084 - 00:15:44.244, Speaker A: I did bring them up in my.
00:15:44.284 - 00:15:48.244, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah. Those are not gifts.
00:15:48.324 - 00:15:51.308, Speaker C: So, yeah, okay.
00:15:51.436 - 00:15:55.612, Speaker E: The first thing, when I first entered the NFT space, it was all profit pictures.
00:15:55.668 - 00:15:56.264, Speaker C: Right?
00:15:56.834 - 00:15:57.694, Speaker A: Exactly.
00:15:58.274 - 00:15:58.978, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:15:59.106 - 00:16:09.082, Speaker E: Pfps everywhere. And I looked at them and I was this suck man with glasses and a mustache, and this one has a.
00:16:09.098 - 00:16:10.986, Speaker C: Beard, but it's the same template.
00:16:11.170 - 00:16:14.786, Speaker E: And in my mind, I was like, I can do better, and I can.
00:16:14.810 - 00:16:29.602, Speaker C: Do it minimalist with some, I don't know, stuff. And I created this one, beat plus red, as I named it, faces, and I did more than 200 of them. And just having fun.
00:16:29.698 - 00:16:34.826, Speaker E: I was just having fun testing stuff, learning to mint, learning to interact with.
00:16:34.850 - 00:16:42.778, Speaker C: All the people here. And then we had hen pocalypse or college somewhere.
00:16:42.906 - 00:16:44.738, Speaker E: November, I think it was in November.
00:16:44.786 - 00:16:46.810, Speaker C: 11, something like that.
00:16:46.962 - 00:16:47.694, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:16:48.094 - 00:16:53.594, Speaker C: And I was super, super down. I was, oh, fuck, this is. This is over.
00:16:54.214 - 00:16:56.510, Speaker E: And I had bunch of ideas and.
00:16:56.542 - 00:16:59.286, Speaker C: Stuff that I delayed, such as the.
00:16:59.310 - 00:17:02.354, Speaker E: Plants and other stuff I never released.
00:17:02.814 - 00:17:09.142, Speaker C: That ended up in version. I started, like, I started again in.
00:17:09.198 - 00:17:14.126, Speaker E: January when Versum showed up, since I was like, ah, what's going on with Penn?
00:17:14.150 - 00:17:18.854, Speaker C: I don't want to put my efforts in something that can go away at any time.
00:17:20.554 - 00:17:30.574, Speaker A: Hilarious. So then you started doing versa. So back to the pixel art then? Did you start doing pixel art then with the whole blockchain nft thing?
00:17:30.914 - 00:17:31.814, Speaker C: Was that.
00:17:32.234 - 00:17:32.962, Speaker A: Yeah, that's.
00:17:33.018 - 00:17:33.322, Speaker C: That's.
00:17:33.378 - 00:17:34.026, Speaker A: So I've.
00:17:34.090 - 00:17:37.170, Speaker E: I've only done pixel art. I've only done, like, pixel art.
00:17:37.282 - 00:17:53.274, Speaker C: Well, there's one piece, I think, that's not pixel art. It's an old drawing that I liked a lot, but I gifted. Made it a gift, I mean. But, yeah, yeah, mostly pixel art oriented.
00:17:55.254 - 00:18:02.062, Speaker A: Exactly. And so when you were doing gifts, say, like, ten years ago, you were just doing different kind of things. You weren't doing pixel art?
00:18:02.198 - 00:18:03.238, Speaker C: No, I was not.
00:18:03.286 - 00:18:06.214, Speaker E: I was. I was trying to give life to.
00:18:06.254 - 00:18:08.274, Speaker C: My hand draw hand drops.
00:18:08.614 - 00:18:32.006, Speaker A: That's so interesting. So, yeah, I mean, it's weird because pixel art, it seems like it's been around for a long time. Was there an artist? Like, was it when you came across Rada's work? A lot of us kind of got inspired by Rada's pixel art. Like, was there an artist that you saw, or was it something you just kind of felt? Maybe you saw some pixel art and were just like, yeah, this makes sense for me. I want to do this.
00:18:32.190 - 00:18:32.702, Speaker D: Okay.
00:18:32.758 - 00:18:44.134, Speaker E: Yes. It has always resonated with me due to the video game addiction I have or used to, especially towards JRpgs from.
00:18:44.174 - 00:18:47.622, Speaker C: The Super Nintendo and PlayStation one era.
00:18:47.798 - 00:18:51.910, Speaker E: But such a Final Fantasy chrono trigger and those games.
00:18:52.062 - 00:19:00.754, Speaker C: But when I started collecting on hand, I was a huge fan of onebit necromancy bangers.
00:19:00.874 - 00:19:14.334, Speaker A: He's the best. I mean, one bit necro is an acquired taste. Like, the first time I saw him, I was like, eh, not sure about this, but now it's like, oh, my God, one bit necro. Put out a piece. Like, I have to see what's going on here.
00:19:14.994 - 00:19:16.066, Speaker D: Totally, totally.
00:19:16.130 - 00:19:19.994, Speaker E: Actually, I received a bunch of shitty offers for a bunch of pieces that.
00:19:20.034 - 00:19:23.002, Speaker C: I have from them yesterday.
00:19:23.058 - 00:19:24.346, Speaker E: I was like, come on.
00:19:24.450 - 00:19:25.042, Speaker A: Same here.
00:19:25.098 - 00:19:29.784, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, yeah. But popular as well.
00:19:29.824 - 00:19:34.264, Speaker E: I was looking at popular and one bit necro. I'm like, what the hell are these guys doing?
00:19:34.344 - 00:19:38.424, Speaker C: This is not pixel art. This is beyond that.
00:19:38.504 - 00:19:41.416, Speaker E: It's not on the video game scheme.
00:19:41.560 - 00:19:49.880, Speaker C: Sort of to say it's more than the traditional pixel art, to say, to put a name on it. Right.
00:19:50.032 - 00:19:55.668, Speaker E: And then I started stumbling with other artists, but I will mainly probably say.
00:19:55.716 - 00:20:01.624, Speaker C: Yeah, one with necro and popular art. The first two that I was like, what?
00:20:02.844 - 00:20:24.474, Speaker A: Well, you can't do much better than that as far as influences and, yeah, I call it edgy pixel art. You know, it's just kind of like there's just a brooding darkness. Like, almost got that great sci-Fi you know, it's like hr giger alien type vibe. And when vid necro, it's kind of like this horror. It's almost like this. So it's just so cool. Like, I mean, it's just so brilliant.
00:20:24.474 - 00:20:43.330, Speaker A: What's so interesting about, say, the cap and, like, on your page, like, you got to the pixel art stuff pretty quickly. Like, and you had those great rooms. Like, what's so interesting? Like, room three, r one. Like, you almost see a lot of the seeds of your art from very early on.
00:20:43.482 - 00:20:49.834, Speaker C: Interestingly. Yeah, those rooms are real places, man.
00:20:53.174 - 00:21:20.064, Speaker A: Yeah. And like, and they're actually pretty cheap for whoever's looking, considering how early they are, so. Okay, so then you started a bunch of projects. So tell us a little bit, just a little bit more on your story, and then I'll pass it over to runtoon here, just as far as. So you started making some work and you started selling it, I assume, and you probably got encouraged by that, and you kept going. I mean, tell us a little bit more about kind of what happened to you.
00:21:20.884 - 00:21:29.244, Speaker E: Okay, well, I was pretty discouraged with henpocalypse, right. And I stopped minting. I was just around looking, what's the.
00:21:29.284 - 00:21:32.092, Speaker C: Next platform or where to go?
00:21:32.188 - 00:21:38.356, Speaker E: What's going to happen? I think I'm going to try ethereum. I was thinking lots of things, but I didn't like it because of the price.
00:21:38.420 - 00:21:39.024, Speaker D: Right.
00:21:39.604 - 00:21:41.884, Speaker C: So I kept creating.
00:21:42.004 - 00:21:43.540, Speaker E: That didn't stop me, but I was.
00:21:43.572 - 00:21:45.948, Speaker C: Like, hesitant to mint or.
00:21:46.036 - 00:21:46.744, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:21:47.364 - 00:21:51.452, Speaker C: So I kept experimenting.
00:21:51.548 - 00:21:53.532, Speaker E: And what you see on my page.
00:21:53.668 - 00:22:02.524, Speaker C: Most of the versamaritems are the product of those experimentation time and selling those.
00:22:02.564 - 00:22:05.762, Speaker E: Pieces and seeing the good response from.
00:22:05.908 - 00:22:14.710, Speaker C: From all you guys and everything gave me the will to keep creating and making eventual collections.
00:22:14.782 - 00:22:15.446, Speaker D: Right.
00:22:15.630 - 00:22:25.714, Speaker C: But, yeah, all the hand theo transition put me on a tight spot. I didn't know where to go.
00:22:27.774 - 00:22:28.214, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:22:28.254 - 00:22:37.642, Speaker C: Then I came to object and with a more oriented mindset, like, I did.
00:22:37.698 - 00:22:40.410, Speaker E: Know, knew what to do.
00:22:40.482 - 00:22:53.098, Speaker C: Right. Like, I'm gonna do these astral escapes, and I started working on those on a more serious way, like, putting hard work and my heart on that.
00:22:53.146 - 00:22:53.734, Speaker D: Right.
00:22:54.154 - 00:23:10.554, Speaker C: Not just experiment and trying new stuff. Since all the previous stuff, you probably see previous, the astral scape, it's bunch of, like, abstract moving pixels everywhere and. Yeah, it's not like.
00:23:12.614 - 00:23:13.950, Speaker E: A consistent idea.
00:23:13.982 - 00:23:16.270, Speaker C: Of what I wanted to do. Yeah.
00:23:16.302 - 00:23:38.730, Speaker A: Like, I see, like a series of series is almost what I'd call it. Like, there's these really cool pylon works. I remember picking up a few of those. One of ones maybe, I don't know. Must be four or five months ago now. Just scanning your page. Actually, there are some deals out there, and I just picked up, actually, that one with the chinese character, that beautiful black and white one from very early on for Tazos edition of 15.
00:23:38.730 - 00:23:45.014, Speaker A: That's fantastic. So there are some deals there on your page. Runtun, do you have any questions for cap?
00:23:45.754 - 00:24:13.194, Speaker B: Yeah, it's really interesting to see all that you've. Don, you're very prolific. Would you say that, like, nFts and crypto is what kind of, like, keeps you so productive? Because I know that Poco Belly's talked about this a lot, and I definitely agree that, you know, NFTs are kind of fueling this creative mode of production for a lot of people, myself included.
00:24:14.014 - 00:24:17.498, Speaker C: Yes. There's no doubt about it.
00:24:17.626 - 00:24:23.938, Speaker E: I'm gonna be honest. I've made one of the best art friends I've ever done in my life in this space.
00:24:24.066 - 00:24:29.618, Speaker C: So that keeps me pushing. That helps lots of people.
00:24:29.706 - 00:24:32.466, Speaker E: For example, I've met this guy. He's around as well.
00:24:32.490 - 00:24:34.714, Speaker C: I think he's an awesome person.
00:24:34.794 - 00:24:45.296, Speaker E: He helped me a lot to understand lots of stuff in this space. I've befriended Niuji as well, whom I created. Still creating a collection with stumble with.
00:24:45.320 - 00:24:48.032, Speaker C: In real life stuff that put us.
00:24:48.048 - 00:24:49.284, Speaker E: On a little heart.
00:24:50.864 - 00:24:51.684, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:24:51.984 - 00:25:01.752, Speaker E: To put some way, Joe, how I see him here, I'm just checking the list. Weird veil, of course. Tater tots. Mick renders, my friend. Yeah.
00:25:01.808 - 00:25:26.652, Speaker C: And lots of stuff. Santiago, here you are. But, yeah, like, creating connection, having fun with all these peers and seeing the value they see in my art and I see in their art fuels this engine of creativity. Like, oh, I want to do these things.
00:25:26.788 - 00:25:28.372, Speaker E: While this person did.
00:25:28.508 - 00:25:51.688, Speaker C: Inspired me in some way. So, yes, if it was. If it wasn't for this whole NfT crypto space, I think I wouldn't be as prolific as you say. Cause none of my friends actually dig my pixels as you guys do. They are like, oh, that's cool. But they don't. They don't.
00:25:51.776 - 00:25:53.124, Speaker E: They don't dive in.
00:25:53.904 - 00:26:02.770, Speaker B: Yeah, I can relate to that. I definitely have a lot of art friends who just wouldn't. They just don't really understand it at all.
00:26:02.962 - 00:26:03.570, Speaker E: They don't.
00:26:03.602 - 00:26:05.034, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah.
00:26:05.074 - 00:26:29.678, Speaker A: We're connoisseurs out here of pixel art. Like, we. We look at so much pixel art, all of the people I imagine in this space like, that we're in right now. Yeah, I mean, we're connoisseurs. So even, like, your figments project, that took me, like, I. I thought it was really interesting, but I didn't. You know, I wasn't collecting it at first, but then the more I saw, and then I started getting FOMo as they were all selling out.
00:26:29.678 - 00:26:37.526, Speaker A: Talk a little bit about your figments collection, because that is. I think it's spectacular, and I think you're. It seems like you're having a lot.
00:26:37.550 - 00:26:38.582, Speaker C: Of fun with it.
00:26:38.718 - 00:26:40.154, Speaker A: What did that come out of?
00:26:41.814 - 00:26:44.670, Speaker E: That's the most fun collection I've done.
00:26:44.702 - 00:26:46.354, Speaker C: As you say. It's.
00:26:46.974 - 00:26:47.862, Speaker E: It came along.
00:26:47.918 - 00:26:56.906, Speaker C: Since I was on a. I'm always in a constant search of new stuff. I like to try new stuff.
00:26:57.050 - 00:27:01.410, Speaker E: I get bored of something, I want to improve it.
00:27:01.562 - 00:27:08.146, Speaker C: So my main tool, I use gimp, right? I've always used Gimp. I kind of know how to use.
00:27:08.170 - 00:27:11.082, Speaker E: Photoshop, but Gimp has these scripts and.
00:27:11.138 - 00:27:25.014, Speaker C: Plugins that you can install that are pretty useful to what I do. Stuff that I learned years ago, right? And for the figments, I was pretty.
00:27:25.054 - 00:27:28.150, Speaker E: Tired of using deluxe paint too, because.
00:27:28.222 - 00:27:42.862, Speaker C: It'S, it's an old software and I used gimp and deluxe paint too to like mix the work, such as I did with the, with the captain gift shop, right?
00:27:42.998 - 00:27:44.862, Speaker E: I tried to use the deluxe paint.
00:27:44.918 - 00:27:52.876, Speaker C: To break the image, then bring it back to game and do the magic there, put the gif together and everything.
00:27:52.980 - 00:27:55.772, Speaker E: Since on deluxe paint we cannot export.
00:27:55.828 - 00:27:58.700, Speaker C: As a gift, so that that main.
00:27:58.772 - 00:28:06.148, Speaker E: Thing we cannot export as a gift was a thing. I was not happy because I don't like recording the screen and then going.
00:28:06.196 - 00:28:11.908, Speaker C: To game to create the Gif for the deluxe paint creation. It's okay.
00:28:11.956 - 00:28:17.090, Speaker E: But I wanted more, I wanted to have more control on the color cycles and other stuff.
00:28:17.212 - 00:28:28.502, Speaker C: So I start searching for alternatives to DLX paint. And I stumbled with telepaint from a.
00:28:28.518 - 00:28:30.606, Speaker E: BBC micro, I don't know what that is.
00:28:30.670 - 00:28:54.514, Speaker C: That's an old instance of art program. I found a GitHub, this site with software people, creative programmers do, and downloaded an instance of this telepain called art forever. It's like a new version or new.
00:28:55.054 - 00:28:57.470, Speaker E: There'S actually several versions in the folder.
00:28:57.502 - 00:29:06.886, Speaker C: I downloaded, but this software based on telepaint, an old paint art software, I don't know, came along.
00:29:06.950 - 00:29:08.190, Speaker D: Oh, my dog.
00:29:08.302 - 00:29:28.284, Speaker C: I came with this software, art forever it's called. And I was totally drawn by it. I was like, okay, I'm gonna master this program. And that's where I create the figments. The curious thing about this one is.
00:29:28.584 - 00:29:31.144, Speaker E: That the color cycling and everything works.
00:29:31.184 - 00:29:40.052, Speaker C: Totally different as deluxe paint. And I was totally drawn into it. Like, this is great, this is great.
00:29:40.188 - 00:29:42.044, Speaker E: I can't control the colors I want.
00:29:42.084 - 00:29:47.612, Speaker C: I can't control some stuff that I couldn't actually do and still explain.
00:29:47.708 - 00:29:52.524, Speaker E: Muji can and I'm sure Sabato as well, but I can't do it.
00:29:52.684 - 00:30:00.156, Speaker C: So I stumbled with this program and initially I started experimenting as well.
00:30:00.220 - 00:30:03.594, Speaker E: How does this work? What does this button do? How do I export this?
00:30:03.634 - 00:30:04.386, Speaker C: What does that.
00:30:04.450 - 00:30:05.074, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:30:05.234 - 00:30:09.146, Speaker E: And then I like rebooted and restarted.
00:30:09.210 - 00:30:13.506, Speaker C: What I had in some things in.
00:30:13.530 - 00:30:15.682, Speaker E: Mind with astral hazers.
00:30:15.738 - 00:30:17.374, Speaker C: Another collection I did.
00:30:17.834 - 00:30:22.682, Speaker E: And here we are. The pigments, which I think look really cool.
00:30:22.738 - 00:30:35.194, Speaker C: Like a very different approach to pixel art and just. Yeah. Learning, learning, learning and sucking all that information to be better.
00:30:36.334 - 00:30:56.750, Speaker A: I would totally echo that. I think they totally look. They totally look different than anything. And it kind of. It speaks to that whole idea, that software, like, I mean, it's almost like the tools that are determining the work to a certain degree. Because, you know, if you were in Photoshop, you wouldn't. Or if you weren't using deluxe paint, like, you wouldn't be making certain things.
00:30:56.750 - 00:31:21.634, Speaker A: Things. So it's almost like, you know, it's. It just highlights the importance of the tools, which is an obvious point, but it's worth making, you know? And also, what I really love about is they kind of distill kind of your metaphysical theme, for lack of better terms. You know, the figures.
00:31:30.154 - 00:31:30.974, Speaker D: Hello?
00:31:32.514 - 00:31:36.386, Speaker B: Uh, Poco belly, I feel like you're kind of cutting out there.
00:31:36.530 - 00:31:40.538, Speaker C: Okay, okay. Could you.
00:31:40.626 - 00:31:42.694, Speaker A: Did you understand anything that I said?
00:31:45.154 - 00:31:49.494, Speaker C: I couldn't hear you, man. Okay. Yeah, it was cutting out.
00:31:51.154 - 00:31:56.530, Speaker A: Keep going if you can. Keep going. Because if I end the space, it'll end it. So. Rune tune, take it away.
00:31:56.682 - 00:31:57.414, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:31:57.714 - 00:32:01.970, Speaker B: Well, it sounds like you're. You're coming through okay right now, poco belly.
00:32:02.122 - 00:32:02.706, Speaker C: Oh, oh.
00:32:02.730 - 00:32:13.294, Speaker A: Okay. So what I was saying, let me know if I cut out again. I am on a phone cellular here. It's more reliable than my Internet. What I was saying, too bad. I was making. I was on a roll there.
00:32:13.294 - 00:32:44.844, Speaker A: But what I was saying is Kappan Spigment's work, what makes it so interesting? One of the things is it kind of distills this metaphysical theme of the soul and consciousness and distills it with the very basics of technology. Technology, RGB, it looks like processors. So it's just such a beautiful distillation of kind of the soul or almost like metaphysical spirituality, let's say, and technology. Do you have anything to say about that, Kevin?
00:32:46.064 - 00:32:49.416, Speaker E: Yeah, sure. I've always been a tech guy since.
00:32:49.560 - 00:32:56.056, Speaker C: I was really young. I used to create my networks and.
00:32:56.120 - 00:33:04.136, Speaker E: My neighborhood with my cousin so we can. Could play Starcraft at night. So I've always been into, like, creating.
00:33:04.200 - 00:33:28.488, Speaker C: Technology, diving into technology, not creating, but understanding it, and always been influenced by technology. At some point of my life, I got really into Ram Dass. You know who he was? He's the creator. He was a spiritual leader, and he wrote a book called be here now.
00:33:28.576 - 00:33:31.072, Speaker E: And that book helped me a lot.
00:33:31.168 - 00:33:50.014, Speaker C: Through some time of my life, finding who I am. And lots of the themes that I touch here come from a mixture of my head, basically.
00:33:50.514 - 00:33:55.130, Speaker E: We all have something inside. We can't explain it. I can tell you who Poco Belli.
00:33:55.162 - 00:33:58.498, Speaker C: Is, but there's something bigger than Poco.
00:33:58.546 - 00:34:01.602, Speaker E: Belli inside Pocopelli, in my way of seeing life.
00:34:01.658 - 00:34:02.306, Speaker C: Right.
00:34:02.490 - 00:34:05.602, Speaker E: And it's just for you. I can never talk to that being.
00:34:05.658 - 00:34:18.918, Speaker C: That or whatever you have inside that gives you power to life and makes you think and cry and all the emotions. And it's basically me expressing what or.
00:34:18.966 - 00:34:22.462, Speaker E: Trying to express what we all humans are going through.
00:34:22.558 - 00:34:47.114, Speaker C: We are like being torn apart of our inner souls and our inner gardens and being brought into the world of technology. Now everyone's like a dumb person with a phone. They don't think. They don't. They don't. And I'm talking for real. They don't use their heads.
00:34:47.114 - 00:34:50.142, Speaker C: They relate too much on technology.
00:34:50.318 - 00:34:53.862, Speaker E: And I do think technology gave us advantages, for sure.
00:34:53.918 - 00:34:57.562, Speaker C: But as everything in life there is a spectrum.
00:34:57.718 - 00:35:01.386, Speaker E: And I try to explore that as how we are.
00:35:01.450 - 00:35:14.346, Speaker C: We have, like, sort of disconnected from the inside, and we are connected on the outside with other kind of stuff that can bring several good things to.
00:35:14.370 - 00:35:19.658, Speaker E: Humanity, I'm pretty sure. But I'm always, like, exploring those themes.
00:35:19.746 - 00:35:37.384, Speaker C: Technology wise, nature wise, and spirituality. It's not like I follow every religion or anything, but I do believe we all have a bigger force that we can tune in and will make our lives, let's say, easier.
00:35:39.044 - 00:35:39.404, Speaker D: And.
00:35:39.444 - 00:36:03.154, Speaker A: Yes, that's beautiful, cap. And, yeah, I mean, it kind of brings up this whole other aspect of your work, which is almost like the psychedelic component. I mean, you mentioned Ram Das. I think he was. I'm not an expert on Ram desk, but I thought he was kind of like a 1960s figure, maybe friends with Timothy Leary. Like, I. So can you talk about a little bit the psychedelic side of things? I mean, maybe you just did.
00:36:03.154 - 00:36:09.014, Speaker A: Right, but how important are psychedelics to your workflow?
00:36:09.474 - 00:36:11.306, Speaker C: Well, I'm a content.
00:36:11.450 - 00:36:15.534, Speaker A: You know, not your workflow, but your content. Yeah, sorry, go ahead.
00:36:16.074 - 00:36:22.444, Speaker E: I won't lie. I'm a pothead, dude. I love weed, and I smoke it. And I having a relationship with.
00:36:23.304 - 00:36:26.064, Speaker C: Trying to not obsess with it.
00:36:26.104 - 00:36:26.400, Speaker E: Right.
00:36:26.472 - 00:36:51.464, Speaker C: But in the past, I did lots of psychedelics, mostly LSD and shrooms. Those brought clarity to my head in some way, like open doors that I didn't even knew were there. And I'm totally influenced by it, by the. All the. How to put it.
00:36:53.604 - 00:36:55.284, Speaker E: That it's not craziness.
00:36:55.364 - 00:36:56.224, Speaker C: All the.
00:36:57.604 - 00:36:59.580, Speaker E: There's a word I forget at this.
00:36:59.612 - 00:37:14.194, Speaker C: Moment, but all what psych spring brought to my life now. I think it's like, being expressed through this stuff because, for example, this last.
00:37:14.494 - 00:37:16.594, Speaker E: Piece, I put on the pigments.
00:37:19.694 - 00:37:20.902, Speaker D: Forgot the name.
00:37:21.038 - 00:37:22.354, Speaker C: I need to check it.
00:37:25.454 - 00:37:25.814, Speaker A: Out.
00:37:25.854 - 00:37:27.110, Speaker E: Introspector. Yeah, yeah.
00:37:27.142 - 00:37:40.610, Speaker C: The one of the soul looking at the dark soul. It's based on a dream or idea I had, like one week ago. Really?
00:37:40.802 - 00:37:41.754, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah.
00:37:41.914 - 00:37:46.894, Speaker E: And I did, like three versions of that. One, I didn't like it. And the fourth one, it was like.
00:37:47.434 - 00:37:51.498, Speaker C: Oh, this is cool. But to put it in a way.
00:37:51.546 - 00:37:58.410, Speaker E: It was like sort of a psychelic idea dream. Something that comes in, like, when you're high on something.
00:37:58.482 - 00:38:06.414, Speaker C: Like, oh, this is struck me like lightning. And yeah, I'm totally influenced by it. I won't want.
00:38:07.114 - 00:38:07.216, Speaker D: I'm not.
00:38:07.216 - 00:38:12.488, Speaker C: To a consumer of psychotics at this moment. Like, I used to microdose on that.
00:38:12.536 - 00:38:14.320, Speaker E: Shit, but nowadays I'm.
00:38:14.392 - 00:38:15.404, Speaker D: I'm chilling.
00:38:16.064 - 00:38:19.264, Speaker E: But, yeah, I do. I did. I do.
00:38:19.304 - 00:38:24.124, Speaker C: And not saying you want, but I'm totally influenced by it.
00:38:25.024 - 00:38:48.314, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, that's what I also like about the. That work in particular. It's like there's these solar system type things that surround it. So again, it's kind of like this. I don't know if you know the words, the synoptic, almost like this metaphysical, like all multi layered art, you know, it's again done with pixels. And again.
00:38:48.314 - 00:39:06.274, Speaker A: And I assume the movement of these pixels, and I'll turn it over to the crowd here in a second. So is that done in that software you were talking about, that teletext, the way it's moving so beautifully and fast, the animations, or is that a gimp thing or. You don't need to tell us, by the way, but just kind of curious.
00:39:06.974 - 00:39:13.062, Speaker E: And I'm gonna tell you. No worries. Yeah, it's done on that program, but I need to go to take it.
00:39:13.078 - 00:39:17.198, Speaker C: To gimP, to final production to.
00:39:17.246 - 00:39:17.994, Speaker A: Got it.
00:39:18.374 - 00:39:19.954, Speaker E: Put the gimp all together.
00:39:20.854 - 00:39:26.794, Speaker C: Yeah, but the program is very powerful, actually, and.
00:39:27.694 - 00:39:34.834, Speaker A: Sorry, I was just going to say what else is interesting, too, is the pixels. They almost look like they're not square.
00:39:35.294 - 00:39:36.254, Speaker D: They're not.
00:39:36.414 - 00:39:37.614, Speaker A: That is so cool.
00:39:37.734 - 00:39:40.374, Speaker E: Yeah, they're rectangles, man.
00:39:40.414 - 00:39:44.366, Speaker C: Like two pieces long. Yeah, yeah. All super odd.
00:39:44.550 - 00:40:10.284, Speaker A: Very cool. Well, we have a wonderful crowd here. There's Xerox there, and Mikey, Delacrem, Sabato, Skomra, Martin, Joe, Manny, purple drank. So if anybody wants to join the conversation, you have a question or comment for cap and by all means join the show here and just put a request to speak. Maybe I'll prank a few people on the way. What a great crowd. There's cant too rintune.
00:40:10.284 - 00:40:12.332, Speaker A: Do you have any questions for.
00:40:12.508 - 00:40:13.264, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:40:13.964 - 00:40:18.784, Speaker B: Of all the collections that you've put out, what are some of your favorite ones that you've done.
00:40:20.494 - 00:40:24.990, Speaker C: At the moment? I would say the pigments, man. Okay.
00:40:25.142 - 00:40:25.454, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:40:25.494 - 00:40:28.074, Speaker B: What is it about the figments that you like so much?
00:40:31.334 - 00:41:02.322, Speaker C: It's like the mix of everything I did before. Like, it's not traditional art, but still, like retro pixel art. Pixel. Pixel art, yeah. And I dig a lot that the software as default has a black background. And I do that a lot previously to finding the program. So it's like, oh, this was meant for me to create since on the.
00:41:02.338 - 00:41:05.834, Speaker E: Software, the black background is intended to be transparent.
00:41:05.994 - 00:41:06.362, Speaker D: Right.
00:41:06.418 - 00:41:08.594, Speaker C: So you export as a PNG and.
00:41:08.634 - 00:41:10.122, Speaker E: You have no background, but you can.
00:41:10.178 - 00:41:15.244, Speaker C: Do it with the background, which, as I said, it's default color.
00:41:15.284 - 00:41:17.540, Speaker E: It's black. And I've used that on the plants.
00:41:17.612 - 00:41:27.260, Speaker C: And the faces and most of my art relays on black backgrounds. So it's like it was meant for me to explore it.
00:41:27.372 - 00:41:28.892, Speaker E: And I'm enjoying that a lot.
00:41:28.948 - 00:41:32.532, Speaker C: So I would say picked. That's very cool.
00:41:32.588 - 00:41:43.894, Speaker B: Very interesting. It's funny how just like, something so simple as just having a black background inherent in the software is the thing that kind of, like, forms the relationship between you and the tools.
00:41:44.474 - 00:41:45.370, Speaker C: Totally.
00:41:45.522 - 00:41:45.890, Speaker D: It's.
00:41:45.922 - 00:41:50.066, Speaker E: It's insane. It's like I'm working and I'm like, I can't wait to finish this so.
00:41:50.090 - 00:41:51.930, Speaker C: I can start trying Disney stuff.
00:41:51.962 - 00:42:10.834, Speaker A: There you see it in the work. I mean, you see the joy that you are taking in this work here. And again, like, to your point, like, the reason, it's, as far as I understand you, and this is my sense of what you're saying, the reason you love it so much. It, like, it kind of captures everything you're doing.
00:42:12.054 - 00:42:12.558, Speaker C: Right.
00:42:12.646 - 00:42:12.870, Speaker E: And.
00:42:12.902 - 00:42:36.844, Speaker A: But just like with this new software, and it's even like, this exciting new software. Do you want to talk about a little bit the works? I guess some of the kappan works and like the. I guess it's the astral haze. I mean, I don't know if there's too much to say on it, but can you talk a little bit about it and, like, you know, maybe. I don't know. Was that also using gimp and deluxe paint? Was that what was going on there.
00:42:37.904 - 00:42:39.728, Speaker E: For the astral hazers.
00:42:39.816 - 00:42:48.724, Speaker C: I used gimp, mostly gimp. And on that particular.
00:42:50.424 - 00:42:52.088, Speaker E: Collection, I explored.
00:42:52.256 - 00:43:00.134, Speaker C: My evolution, basically, like how I come to be where I am at the moment. So.
00:43:01.834 - 00:43:04.618, Speaker E: Yeah, it's a very personal sort.
00:43:04.666 - 00:43:22.018, Speaker C: Of putting, it's not biographical, but each one, I think there were twelve, I don't remember. Yeah, twelve tokens. And each one represents and has a meaning inside of the very first one.
00:43:22.066 - 00:43:23.066, Speaker E: It's called Inco.
00:43:23.130 - 00:43:31.234, Speaker C: And it's the, the inner call that I got years ago, like what I want to be and I want to become.
00:43:32.214 - 00:43:35.350, Speaker E: And the last one, since I won't.
00:43:35.382 - 00:43:37.422, Speaker C: Go piece by piece, the last one.
00:43:37.438 - 00:43:38.870, Speaker E: Is called the door, the door back.
00:43:38.902 - 00:44:24.758, Speaker C: Home and the door where you liberate and free yourself of all struggles, inner, personal and mental struggles. But yes, these were created using gimp based on this pixel beam, Solman, whatever you want to name it, that started there. And I say this is not biographical, but it's based on my cycle and the cycle I've seen in others and self growth. So yeah, I explored that. And yeah, it's made using gimp and.
00:44:24.806 - 00:44:27.174, Speaker E: Bunch of plugins that it has that.
00:44:27.214 - 00:44:32.278, Speaker C: Helps to animate and change the movement.
00:44:32.326 - 00:44:33.758, Speaker E: Gimp's pretty powerful tool.
00:44:33.806 - 00:44:56.998, Speaker A: I'm gonna be honest, I was gonna, I was just gonna say this makes me want to use Gimp. Hearing all this stuff, I think I downloaded it like six or seven years ago when I needed Photoshop. When I had changed computers and the keys that I had for Photoshop weren't working, I found it a little. I never really gave it too much of a chance. I just thought it was like a free Photoshop. So it can't be that good. But clearly it's pretty amazing.
00:44:56.998 - 00:45:44.174, Speaker A: I mean, you mentioned the door, and I'm looking at it right now. I mean, another kind of cool aspect of your art was it's almost like psychedelic art, but without all the, you know, classic psychedelic, you know, tropes, shall we say, or, you know, ideas. Like, it's, it's like this psychedelic, spiritual art, the door of liberation. And so that is super interesting for me. And I also really like, I mean, this is something I really like about your art is this idea that you leave. You know, and a lot of artists do this, but leave, like part of the GiF, static or not moving and the other part is moving. Was that something that you did? I guess you did it from very early on, like those rock rooms or those rooms with the band instruments.
00:45:44.174 - 00:45:50.174, Speaker A: Do you have anything to say about that? About sort of animating only parts of the image.
00:45:51.114 - 00:45:51.650, Speaker E: Yeah.
00:45:51.722 - 00:46:28.184, Speaker C: I think it gives focus on something that I want to say, like. Yeah, for example, the door, if we're talking about that piece, only the other side, it's moving because the other side, brighter, it's warmer, it's better than the cold place you are right now. So when you free yourself, you'll get to that warmth. So I need to give some contrast to make it look better than where the beam is standing before jumping into the door.
00:46:28.624 - 00:46:30.224, Speaker E: So, yeah, it's intended.
00:46:30.344 - 00:46:33.216, Speaker C: I like a lot to make the.
00:46:33.240 - 00:46:41.208, Speaker E: Stars move, only so you can see, like, just appreciating the sky. You don't see the whole sky moving. Right.
00:46:41.296 - 00:46:49.456, Speaker C: See subtle things moving. So, yeah, it's. I do it on purpose. Go ahead.
00:46:49.520 - 00:46:51.392, Speaker A: Go ahead. I was just gonna say it makes it very poetic.
00:46:51.448 - 00:46:52.880, Speaker D: Go ahead. Yeah.
00:46:52.952 - 00:46:58.518, Speaker C: Just to focus on what I want to express on the piece.
00:46:58.606 - 00:47:02.398, Speaker E: For the anamnesis piece, for example, there's.
00:47:02.446 - 00:47:12.434, Speaker C: Two souls, to put it in a way, remembering each other. It's about remembering who you are, who.
00:47:13.294 - 00:47:15.942, Speaker E: You really are, not about another life.
00:47:15.998 - 00:47:19.430, Speaker C: But sometimes we forget what we are.
00:47:19.582 - 00:47:21.486, Speaker E: Intended to and what we came to.
00:47:21.510 - 00:47:22.674, Speaker C: This work to do.
00:47:22.854 - 00:47:24.946, Speaker E: So I just wanted them to.
00:47:25.050 - 00:47:28.414, Speaker C: Their eye, just one eye to shine, like.
00:47:28.794 - 00:47:30.414, Speaker D: Yeah. Looking through.
00:47:33.514 - 00:47:37.274, Speaker C: Hey, so sorry.
00:47:37.314 - 00:48:18.744, Speaker A: Continue, continue. No, no, I just wanted to say on the animations piece, I mean, again, it kind of screams plightenism a little bit. And, yeah, I totally feel like. And that is kind of almost like, you know, you've eaten the mushrooms and then it's like this disremembering, at least of a space that, you know, that you forget about really in your normal life, but then all of a sudden, it's just remembering, as you say, almost who you really are or maybe aren't, you know, what's a deeper self, shall we say? So, but when someone uses a word like that. So did you study any classic philosophy at all or.
00:48:22.164 - 00:48:29.004, Speaker E: I did not. I've always been drawn to this, very.
00:48:29.084 - 00:48:32.668, Speaker C: Interested in, as I say, not only.
00:48:32.716 - 00:48:39.228, Speaker E: Ram Dass and the Behnow book and lots of other stuff. My dad, he studied philosophy, sociology and that.
00:48:39.356 - 00:48:59.574, Speaker C: So I've been influenced by lots of. Of philosophical thoughts since I was a little boy, but, yeah. Not that I studied philosophy or anything like that. Just nurturing the soul and the mind.
00:49:00.594 - 00:49:08.298, Speaker A: Yeah. And I guess you were. You were around it. Yes. As far as your dad. So, familiar territory. Maybe just through osmosis.
00:49:08.298 - 00:49:14.504, Speaker A: We have a couple of people on stage here. Kent, welcome to the show. Great to hear from you. How are things going?
00:49:16.004 - 00:49:16.364, Speaker D: Hey.
00:49:16.404 - 00:49:16.644, Speaker E: Hello.
00:49:16.684 - 00:49:19.064, Speaker F: Pocogali Runtoon. How are you doing?
00:49:20.084 - 00:49:34.584, Speaker A: We're doing wonderful here. We're just thrilled to have Kappen on the show here. Such an interesting artist out at Costa Rica. And we're glad to have you, too, out of Delhi here. Very international situation. Do you have a question or comment for Kappan?
00:49:35.524 - 00:50:04.040, Speaker F: Yes, yes, one very interesting question. First of all, Katherine, wonderful work. I just checked your pin tweet and I'm very happy to see a pixel in rectangle shape. This is. I think this is really interesting because whenever we think about the pixel, it automatically comes in, in our brain that the pixel is square, but it does not. Technically, it's not always square. This is one aspect or the one shape pixel could exist in.
00:50:04.040 - 00:50:08.244, Speaker F: So I wanted to know your own understanding about the pixels.
00:50:11.654 - 00:50:17.598, Speaker E: It's not something that I. Well, first of all, thank you, Kant. Thank you very much for tuning in.
00:50:17.646 - 00:50:18.914, Speaker C: And for your question.
00:50:19.854 - 00:50:24.114, Speaker E: It's not something I did on purpose. It's just the software I've been using.
00:50:24.654 - 00:50:41.088, Speaker C: To create these pieces. If that's the default pixel size, it's basically like two square pixels together. So, yeah, there's nothing I can really say about it.
00:50:41.136 - 00:50:42.688, Speaker E: I didn't do it on purpose.
00:50:42.736 - 00:50:46.124, Speaker C: It was just the way the software works.
00:50:48.184 - 00:51:12.704, Speaker A: And I find the best. Yeah, sometimes it's like, you know, in finance, they say, don't fight the Fed, don't fight the Federal Reserve. And you're investing. And I find technology is like that a lot. If you're building a of website, don't like make it the way you know the web wants you to make a website, don't follow. I wasted years of my life trying to make websites in the way that the web didn't want me to make it. And it's sort of like.
00:51:12.704 - 00:51:33.912, Speaker A: It seems like you're saying a similar thing here with the tech, with the software. Just do what it wants you to do. If it's kind of giving you a certain kind of parameters, work around those. Don't try and force things too much. Go with what you're kind of given to a certain degree. We have a couple of more speakers here. Chi Moscow Jackson, welcome to the show.
00:51:33.912 - 00:51:35.964, Speaker A: How are things going over in Seattle?
00:51:36.864 - 00:52:06.274, Speaker G: Oh, things are. Things are going great. You know, just up early for the grind here in the hustling, trying to get some work done, so. But I really enjoy this conversation. And I just had a comment, um, just to say that, uh, captain, I really, uh, I first discovered your work when I. You had this profile picture pro project. These pfps through your, uh, alias, the exo jam.
00:52:06.274 - 00:52:31.654, Speaker G: And, uh, that was the first kind of works I saw. And I was like, oh, these are really awesome. But then I got your piece on Ethereum, I think it was called what happens when you come down or came down. And that piece just really spoke to me. So I just really enjoy your work, and thanks so much for having this space. Appreciate that.
00:52:32.714 - 00:52:33.434, Speaker D: Thanks a lot.
00:52:33.474 - 00:52:34.330, Speaker E: Chi means.
00:52:34.402 - 00:52:36.794, Speaker C: Means a lot. Sending love, man.
00:52:36.834 - 00:52:42.834, Speaker E: And, yeah, I remember you grabbing and displaying a pfp of mine on your.
00:52:42.874 - 00:52:44.986, Speaker C: Twitter back in the day.
00:52:45.170 - 00:52:47.346, Speaker E: And also, I think you collected some.
00:52:47.370 - 00:52:50.814, Speaker C: Of our collapse with music, I think.
00:52:51.154 - 00:52:52.026, Speaker A: Definitely, man.
00:52:52.050 - 00:52:53.254, Speaker E: I'm a huge fan of.
00:52:55.514 - 00:52:56.574, Speaker C: Means a lot.
00:52:57.634 - 00:53:15.614, Speaker A: I think it's great. Captain, has any, like, have you ever gotten, like, a gallery reach out to you? Like, I just think you could put on such a stellar show? Has that ever happened? You ever get kind of. Or is it pretty much, you know, you're in the NFT space, and. And that's kind of anybody that really knows about you.
00:53:16.794 - 00:53:21.514, Speaker E: Only in the NFT space, actually, no. Like, real life gallery, you mean?
00:53:21.634 - 00:53:42.766, Speaker A: Yeah. I'm just kind of curious, like, I'd expect. Not just because I think we're almost surprisingly small here, so. But I'm just kind of curious because if I was a gallerist, and maybe Chimasku Jackson is gallerist, you know, like, it's sort of like, can you imagine putting on a Kappan show? That would be spectacular, you know, like. So I'm just curious, like, has anybody ever reached out to you in that regard?
00:53:42.870 - 00:53:47.634, Speaker C: I assume not, but no, there has.
00:53:48.174 - 00:53:50.354, Speaker D: No, not really.
00:53:50.734 - 00:53:58.874, Speaker A: It could happen. It could happen at some point here. Retro Manny, welcome to the show. And how are things going? I believe you're in London, is that correct?
00:54:01.494 - 00:54:05.686, Speaker H: Hey, buckabilly. Yeah, I'm not in London. I'm in Birmingham, but close enough.
00:54:05.750 - 00:54:06.086, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:54:06.150 - 00:54:06.942, Speaker A: Right. Got it.
00:54:06.998 - 00:54:09.614, Speaker H: I always tell people it's where Lord of the Rings was set.
00:54:09.734 - 00:54:11.752, Speaker D: That's where I'm from. Wow.
00:54:11.808 - 00:54:15.648, Speaker A: I thought that was in New Zealand. Or is Birmingham in New Zealand? No, I don't mean.
00:54:15.696 - 00:54:21.544, Speaker H: I don't mean the films. I mean, the story was. Yeah, it was based. It was inspired by where I'm from, so.
00:54:21.584 - 00:54:21.784, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:54:21.824 - 00:54:27.284, Speaker A: Okay. Got it, got it. So how are things going? And do you have a question or comment?
00:54:28.184 - 00:54:59.530, Speaker H: Yeah, firstly, thank you for this space. It's always, always a great space. Captain. It's been really good hearing a lot of the spiritual elements of what you've been speaking about. So really, it was just an observation and a comment just to say I really enjoyed listening, you know, felt it very deep and it definitely resonated with a lot of things that I felt stuff about Ram Dass as well. Really, really fascinating of how you tie that into your artwork. So, yeah, I just want to say that that's beautiful and thank you for sharing.
00:54:59.530 - 00:55:12.176, Speaker H: There's just kind of one addition. I just thought it might be interesting for you. If you haven't heard of a guy called Matthias de Stefano, I think you might find a lot of his philosophies quite inspiring, too.
00:55:12.240 - 00:55:16.576, Speaker C: So. Yeah, just want to say that that's great.
00:55:16.680 - 00:55:18.924, Speaker E: Matthias di Stefano mani.
00:55:19.664 - 00:55:20.520, Speaker C: That's correct. Yeah.
00:55:20.552 - 00:55:22.968, Speaker H: Matthias, I can dm you his name.
00:55:23.136 - 00:55:24.008, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
00:55:24.056 - 00:55:25.176, Speaker E: Let's talk later about it.
00:55:25.200 - 00:55:26.280, Speaker C: But thank you.
00:55:26.312 - 00:55:28.592, Speaker E: Thank you so much for tuning in, man, and your words.
00:55:28.648 - 00:55:31.484, Speaker C: And I'm glad to hear you.
00:55:31.894 - 00:55:36.874, Speaker E: You're into this philosophical or metaphysical experiences as well.
00:55:37.414 - 00:55:37.766, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:55:37.790 - 00:56:03.558, Speaker A: And what's so cool about it is it's like it doesn't hit you over the head. Sort of like the psychedelic stuff. Like, you're not hitting us over the head with like making it super obviously psychedelic. It's not super obviously metaphysical. It just is, you know, and you do it in your own way with almost that dark edge, you know, from one bit. Necro and popple, you know, influence. So what's next then? I guess you have.
00:56:03.558 - 00:56:18.514, Speaker A: You're doing the figments thing. It seems like you're full on in there. Do you have any other projects coming up? Are you still working on. I assume you still work on plants and Kapn's gift shop and the pixels. Sounds like there's utility. So what's in the pipeline here, Kappin?
00:56:19.374 - 00:56:28.284, Speaker E: Well, for the. Yes to everything. First of all, I do still do the plants and plan to. To plant more plants.
00:56:28.904 - 00:57:01.012, Speaker C: But the pixels came from experimenting on the plants. They're like a derivative of derivation or something of those, like on the same biological captain Realm. And what I intend to do with the pixels, it's like maybe you need, let's say three pixels to grab a piece of whatever I plan to do. Like use them as value tokens, utility.
00:57:01.068 - 00:57:02.364, Speaker E: Tokens in some way.
00:57:02.444 - 00:57:10.412, Speaker C: So you want this piece, you need to have, let's say, ten pixels and you can get it for half the price.
00:57:10.508 - 00:57:12.684, Speaker E: Something like that. I'm still trying to figure out what.
00:57:12.724 - 00:57:14.584, Speaker C: To do with those.
00:57:15.084 - 00:57:23.302, Speaker E: As for the figments, yes, I'm fully into this, this collection. I'm actually super stoked because I'm doing.
00:57:23.358 - 00:57:35.038, Speaker C: A side pigment collection with music. So I'm I'm already. I already have two, three musicians that.
00:57:35.086 - 00:57:37.030, Speaker E: Are working on their songs, and I'm.
00:57:37.062 - 00:57:43.470, Speaker C: Doing, of course, the figment part. But, yeah, there will be soon a.
00:57:43.582 - 00:57:47.038, Speaker E: Figment collab collection with musicians that will.
00:57:47.086 - 00:57:53.216, Speaker C: Give more life these scenes. And, yes, it's basically where I'm at.
00:57:53.240 - 00:57:55.736, Speaker E: The moment, I'm working and have an.
00:57:55.760 - 00:58:02.284, Speaker C: Idea for another, like, figment alt collection. But first, the music.
00:58:03.384 - 00:58:12.296, Speaker A: I was going to ask you about that, since you're in these bands, that if you ever were planning to incorporate music. Have you ever incorporated music before in your nft?
00:58:12.360 - 00:58:14.164, Speaker D: No. I have.
00:58:14.834 - 00:58:15.974, Speaker C: Interesting.
00:58:17.754 - 00:58:39.294, Speaker A: Great. Well, as we're wrapping up here, sort of going once, going twice, if anybody wants to make a request here. Runetune, do you have any more questions? Should we wrap up, or. Actually, let's start with you, captain. Do you have any final thoughts for us as we're wrapping up here with everybody here? I mean, you have a really nice, full space and all star crowd here.
00:58:40.454 - 00:58:42.158, Speaker E: Well, I just want to thank everyone.
00:58:42.246 - 00:58:46.094, Speaker C: From the very beginning, even if they're.
00:58:46.134 - 00:58:49.614, Speaker E: Not here in this space. Thanks, everyone that has connected with my.
00:58:49.654 - 00:58:59.874, Speaker C: Art and my pixel vision, which is. I know it's kind of different to the traditional, and I'm deeply touched that.
00:59:00.534 - 00:59:03.886, Speaker E: We connected in some way. Thank you from the bottom of my.
00:59:03.910 - 00:59:13.678, Speaker C: Heart to whoever is listening to this. And thank you, Poco and Runtun, for inviting me. I was thrilled the other day, like.
00:59:13.726 - 00:59:17.934, Speaker E: Oh, if this is gonna happen, let's do it. I couldn't believe my eyes.
00:59:17.974 - 00:59:20.110, Speaker C: But here we are, almost at the.
00:59:20.142 - 00:59:21.950, Speaker E: End of this space, and I am.
00:59:21.982 - 00:59:26.166, Speaker C: Truly grateful for what you've done on.
00:59:26.190 - 00:59:29.966, Speaker E: Your YouTube as well, and you're doing a lot for this community.
00:59:30.150 - 00:59:36.128, Speaker C: We need that. We need more of that, I think so. Yeah. Truly thankful.
00:59:36.296 - 01:00:05.032, Speaker A: Well, thank you, cap. And I was absolutely thrilled. Again, there's a lot of kind of enigmatic figures in the space that almost just don't want to go on the spaces. I wasn't sure, so I was totally thrilled, because what I see you doing with the figment's work as well as your other work, I mean, it's so original, as you were just saying. And so it's like I say, there's something kind of un. There's a great saying by David Hickey, old art historian that passed away. Undeniable is undenied.
01:00:05.032 - 01:00:13.872, Speaker A: You know, there's something undeniable about the work. San Diego has just actually come on stage here, Santiago. I can't miss this moment. Welcome to the show. How are you?
01:00:13.928 - 01:00:14.552, Speaker B: Friends?
01:00:14.728 - 01:00:16.464, Speaker I: Yeah, how are you doing?
01:00:16.504 - 01:00:17.204, Speaker B: Wonderful.
01:00:17.504 - 01:00:18.024, Speaker A: Fabulous.
01:00:18.064 - 01:00:18.644, Speaker E: Great.
01:00:19.184 - 01:00:20.084, Speaker C: Welcome.
01:00:21.304 - 01:00:37.624, Speaker I: How are you guys doing? I just came to say hi to Chico and congrats on all the work and thanks for how great you are to all of your colleagues and friends here. You are amazing, man.
01:00:38.524 - 01:00:39.444, Speaker C: Thank you, Santi.
01:00:39.484 - 01:00:44.104, Speaker E: It means a lot. You as you as well, you already know it, right?
01:00:46.004 - 01:00:54.864, Speaker A: Yeah. Beautiful. We always welcome a cameo from Santiago. Always. And, Santiago, you're doing well and everything.
01:00:55.394 - 01:01:21.554, Speaker I: Yeah, I'm great. I have the fire on. It's cold. That's very cold here. And it was great to listen to Kappan talk about his work. It's super inspiring. And it was a surprise for me that this was, like, visual arts kind of new in his life, so that's crazy great.
01:01:21.554 - 01:01:27.814, Speaker I: I guess music is good training for people that jump into visual arts anyway.
01:01:28.754 - 01:01:29.858, Speaker C: That's true, man.
01:01:29.946 - 01:01:32.786, Speaker E: That's actually true. Some of the stuff I come up.
01:01:32.850 - 01:01:35.994, Speaker C: Visually come through me while I'm playing music.
01:01:36.154 - 01:01:42.250, Speaker E: Like, oh, and I have this riff music in my head, and I'm looking.
01:01:42.402 - 01:01:49.064, Speaker C: At something that I can wait to try to bring through the pixel realm, but that's totally true, Santi.
01:01:49.564 - 01:02:07.784, Speaker A: It's almost like this is a word that we haven't gotten to yet. It's like. It's like. It's very inspired, the work, you know, like, there's an inspiration there. And music often inspires, doesn't it? So. Well, thank you, cap and rune tune, do you have any final thoughts for Kap in here and anybody?
01:02:08.124 - 01:02:30.350, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it's. I think, you know, just touching on what everyone's been kind of observing. I. You know, as an artist, it is really hard to, like, stick to one thing and make a large series that kind of, like, you know, has its own conversation. But each collection that you have from the Kappans gift shop to the plants, the figments, all of that, it's.
01:02:30.542 - 01:02:31.694, Speaker A: It's really impressive.
01:02:31.734 - 01:02:33.154, Speaker C: And, you know, the.
01:02:33.534 - 01:03:03.604, Speaker B: Your sensibility, your voice, it really comes through. I especially love the captain's gift shop, you know, and as Poco Belly said, you're not, like, hitting us over the head with some sort of idea or psychedelic thing, but it definitely comes through, and it's very impressive. And, you know, I feel very privileged to be able to have spaces with Poco belly and artists like yourself. So thank you for coming on and sharing all your thoughts.
01:03:05.204 - 01:03:05.940, Speaker C: Thank you, man.
01:03:06.012 - 01:03:06.972, Speaker E: No, no words.
01:03:07.028 - 01:03:08.980, Speaker C: Thank you. Much love. Thank you.
01:03:09.132 - 01:03:28.644, Speaker A: Much love to everyone. And, yeah, I echo your thoughts. Rune tune. And we have to love how small this is, because if this was, like, some massive thing. Kaplan would be making too much money really to make time for a space maybe. And we'd all be making too much money probably to be making, you know, time for each other. I mean, hopefully not, but you know what I'm saying.
01:03:28.644 - 01:04:05.614, Speaker A: If this was massive, there'd be so many people, you know, we'd be trying to help our employees, you know, make help them make payroll. So all to say it's the beauty of things being small, I feel like this is like an all star cast here and I love how small this is because I think that's why it's it's possible. So with that, thank you, cap and thank you everybody who spoke. Thank you everybody who's listening. And yeah, it's just a real honor and pleasure and thank you most of all rune toon for showing up once again on a weekly basis here. And so until next time, take care.
