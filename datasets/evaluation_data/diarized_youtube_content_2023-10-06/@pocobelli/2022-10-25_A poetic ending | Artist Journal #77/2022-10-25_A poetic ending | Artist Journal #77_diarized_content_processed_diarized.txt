00:00:03.840 - 00:00:38.884, Speaker A: A landmark day in the history of digital art, one could argue. Haiti Rockette wraps up the 99 in one series with a poetic ending. Push Start artist journal, October 25, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, artist reporter, which doesn't mean what you think it means. Welcome back. So here we are. Push start.
00:00:38.884 - 00:01:05.982, Speaker A: A poetic ending to the 99 in one. I believe it's the 99th work that Haiti put out here. And so here it is. Yes. What else is there to say? A wonderful ending here to the 99 in one collection. He put out two others, too. These were the final three, probably his final three on object.
00:01:05.982 - 00:01:27.894, Speaker A: Let's see. Rad shit. So classic Haiti Rockette memory, you know? Okay. Yeah. So just awesome. Really. He went out with a bang on this series and mega rip 99 and one.
00:01:27.894 - 00:01:47.894, Speaker A: Yeah. Go give that a retweet. Because I'm tempted to call it a historic day. And maybe I'm wrong. Who knows? But look at this. Rip, rip. I don't know if it was referring to something else earlier or if it was referring to himself the whole time, because there's this fomo economy, carbon everything.
00:01:47.894 - 00:02:31.636, Speaker A: Who knows what that's all about? Really, really, really cool. So again, it's been fun to watch him evolve over this entire series and what is kind of thought of as basically acceptable in terms of the art and how minimal you can go and still go. Yeah, this is good. This works. And so it's just been fascinating to watch this. So I'm sad to see it end, but a great ending it was. So, continuing on, we got a comment, a really interesting comment on AI from Toby Egglesfield.
00:02:31.636 - 00:03:15.990, Speaker A: Just watched another of your salons. I like how he calls it a salon. And I'm really enjoying your takes on AI and how the strengths of the respective networks are shaping the output of the artists who use them. Yes, I think the whole AI convo can be challenging at times, as the words were given tell us to think of it as an external and a being almost when we could perhaps use better, more useful, context specific language. So I believe what Toby is referring to is when we're talking about artificial intelligence, sometimes as we discuss it, we think of AI as a separate entity with its own mind. Right. As a.
00:03:15.990 - 00:03:46.344, Speaker A: We take it literally. Right. So he's pointing that out when we say, is AI using the artists as tools? My very provocative question. I'm not criticizing you by that, but it's something I'm often aware of, that is the whole discourse is a bit flawed, but just by discussing it, you're doing a service. Well, thank you. And by you commenting on it, you are also doing a service, Toby. And I think that's a fair point.
00:03:46.344 - 00:04:23.264, Speaker A: Like, I don't think it necessarily changes the tenor of the argument though, because I think we can say true, likely true. I think. I don't think there's a ghost in the machine, right? At least not yet. I mean, you know, there is a famous treatise by, I think it's La Metrie. I remember reading that for 18th century studies called the man machine. And what La Metry argues is that was a french thinker, one of the philosophes, I think. Famous, famous treatise.
00:04:23.264 - 00:04:46.220, Speaker A: And what he argues is that basically intelligence and the soul can, can be purely explained by mechanical means. In other words, by matter. In other words, the soul is a myth. It is not a true thing. Myth in a pejorative sense. It is not true according to La Metrie. So a hardcore materialist argument.
00:04:46.220 - 00:06:15.704, Speaker A: So not to get in the weeds here, but to back up. So I'm not saying there's a ghost in the machine here. So I think it's a fair point, which you're basically bringing to our attention here, which is when we're discussing AI, let's make sure to realize that this isn't actually a living, breathing being. Although Lamaitrie might argue further down the road, we might consider it, but maybe not yet. And I take your point and I agree. However, I would say the argument does not change. I think we could still say and maybe modify it instead of saying, is AI using the artists as tools to, to get out its outcomes? We could say, is the technology creating, and you know, does it have almost, does it lean towards certain outcomes? Whether it's kind of that japanese screen landscape look, whether it's the old master painting look, whether it's those circles that we see in, is it indie doe's work? There do seem to be some qualitative similarities that are coming out of AI based work that we can point to from different artists, which makes us go, is the technology creating favorable outcomes for certain kinds of solutions? So I don't think the argument changes, but I think that's a good point that you bring up.
00:06:15.704 - 00:06:40.634, Speaker A: Let's be sure to mention that there is, you know, we're not assuming there's a ghost in the machine. So continuing on, this was a hilarious meme. I think it was indo scent, another great one, the mashed potatoes on my profile picture here. So that was pretty funny. I had to take a picture. I took a picture for my girlfriend as I always do with the memes, because look at me. Look at me, ines.
00:06:40.634 - 00:06:57.510, Speaker A: I'm doing well. I got a meme and Twitter erased it, so I guess they didn't like that mashed potato bot. But thank you for doing that. That was hilarious and I love that stuff. So thank you. And also zala. Okay, this is special.
00:06:57.510 - 00:07:21.202, Speaker A: So we featured Zala at the top of the program yesterday. Thanks, pokebelly, for the attention in words. I feel so good watching your program. And ps, I love chagall, so that is awesome. So thank you for that. I'm always thrilled and always pleasantly surprised when the artists chime in and say and are happy to be on the program. So I'm happy that you're happy.
00:07:21.202 - 00:07:31.866, Speaker A: Win win, zala. Win win. So I'm happy for you. And that was fantastic work. Can't wait to see what comes next. This is interesting. And let me read this tweet here.
00:07:31.866 - 00:08:12.924, Speaker A: Art Basel Paris, if not for tazos booth, curated by fxhash, was pretty old school. Still a long way to go for trad art institutions. Happy to pioneer it at Sotheby's. So normally I would just say, well, this is just someone's opinion, and I'm not going to highlight it, but I looked up where art the mort is, who he is, and he is a NFT specialist at Sotheby's. So for him to sort of come out and criticize trad art was kind of maybe has a little more heft and maybe it's a little more newsworthy in the sense that these are institutions criticizing institutions. This is a b two b criticism. A business to business criticism.
00:08:12.924 - 00:08:55.104, Speaker A: So very interesting. Just comment because, you know, I've been doing, I think a lot of us have often thought the same thing, but interesting to hear it from someone at Sotheby's, let's put it that way. Because, you know, maybe a couple of years ago, you might have thought, oh, am I putting my job at risk? And now it's just probably common knowledge. Okay, so anyways, not to be too hard on the trad arc, guys, another just kind of a nice news story here. Uri J vaulting from summit to summit here is on the front of exchange art. Today's Spotlight series is verified dreams by Yuri J. Featured series are gravity spaces.
00:08:55.104 - 00:09:27.940, Speaker A: Okay, so they have some other series. But anyways, there's Yuri J as one of the featured series on exchange art on Solana. So congratulations to Yuri. And so let's get into it. And we have some spectacular works for you here. So let's get started. I mean, this anime manga thing, maybe if you watch anime, this is just like par for the course.
00:09:27.940 - 00:10:01.088, Speaker A: And this is just standard operating procedure. But this is awesome. So you can buy this, it's on foundation and like, like, wow, you can buy this. So anyways, you've seen this part. So that was definitely. You could call that a head turner in Pokebelly land. The eve by Sid visuals only a reserve of 0.8.
00:10:01.088 - 00:10:44.814, Speaker A: And then I guess it goes to auction. An evening view of a street of the new civilization city having numerous cafes, bars and whatnot built for recreation and a relief from the past. So yeah, really, really cool work from Sid visuals. Now check this out. Look at this new work by our man Lewis Osborne. And look at this. I thought to myself, if I'm at the head of the moma, I'm having an all hands on deck meeting and asking, have we put a bid on this yet? And are we going to be bidding on this? Because I thought we just raised $70 million to buy a bunch of nfts.
00:10:44.814 - 00:11:13.318, Speaker A: Okay. And what makes this really stand out for me is this top area here, this blank top area. Because the easy thing, our minds always want to ratiocinate, the easy thing is to complete that pattern there. That's what we want to do. It's, you know, we rationalize reality. Freud's reality principle, okay, which we can get into at another point. But I don't want to distract.
00:11:13.318 - 00:11:38.240, Speaker A: So we're always trying to. That's why it's hard to actually leave things unfinished because we always want to fill it in. Okay, so this brilliant work, which would fit right at home at the MoMA, in my opinion, by Lewis Osborne, has just been launched on super rare. So let's just take a look at what's going on there. 7 hours left. Going for a mere one ETH, 1.42 ETH.
00:11:38.240 - 00:12:12.004, Speaker A: So again, if I'm at Moma, I'm going like, have you guys put a bid? Why am I bringing this to your attention? Do I need to buy this myself and then sell it to Moma? That's what I'm thinking if I'm like director of MoMA. Okay. In my little fantasy land here. So just really cool and interesting write up. Please secure your own mask before helping others. So again, is there any music? I don't think so, no. So again, I just think a stunning work.
00:12:12.004 - 00:12:29.728, Speaker A: Crowd control. Great. So sometimes success will make artists achieve it. Almost inbreeds a confidence in them to get to another level. It's part of the beauty of success. It's like a positive feedback loop, as we all know. I think that's what's going on here, because to me, this is next level.
00:12:29.728 - 00:12:51.244, Speaker A: And it really does all have to do with that blank canvas. And even the color, it's like the color of canvas. This looks like modern art, contemporary art. This belongs in a museum. Okay, that is my take. So. And another artist, paper Crane, who we know who has collaborated with Lewis Osborne.
00:12:51.244 - 00:13:12.156, Speaker A: So very nice abstract work here that is going for $34.99. I think it sold out right away. Accepted offers, 23 down to 15. So healthy, healthy market from paper Crane. A new work from Gloom tube. And look at how poetic this is. Speaking of museum quality.
00:13:12.156 - 00:13:50.250, Speaker A: So what is going on here? First, let's just get the title porch pile. And this seems to almost pair really well with yesterday's the garbage can signs of life that gloom tube put out. And look at what's going on here. So you have fall leaves and contrasted with a cigarette butt. Right. And so you kind of get gloom tube's classic, what I'd call misanthropy, which is, you know, basically, loosely translated is, and I'm not saying he's misanthropic, but the works can be a hatred of humanity. It's an important word.
00:13:50.250 - 00:14:24.920, Speaker A: I think Magritte, for example, has a work called the misanthrope. So it's a good word to know. And we could call it light misanthropy. Some of Gloomtube's work in his criticism of what we might call the suburban nightmare or what Ballard called the suburbanization of the soul. And here we see a used cigarette butt thrown away with the leaves. And another interesting contrast here is these leaves. These beautiful leaves are contrasted with these, with the wood, you know, the trees where it came from.
00:14:24.920 - 00:14:48.304, Speaker A: Again, just kind of torn apart by humanity. So a very poetic fall work from gloom tube. I managed to pick one up for nine. Still available. A couple of flippers there on the scene. So maybe there's still one left for you. Continuing on, another kind of one of one sold by Gloomtube, which just seems cheap right now.
00:14:48.304 - 00:15:03.368, Speaker A: An older one of one just went on secondary to reality. Echo, a banquet, tv, dinner size. Thanks. And a collector card headed your way. And so a really cool piece. I think it went. Did I bring it up? Let me bring it up here.
00:15:03.368 - 00:15:26.564, Speaker A: I think it went for 275, which again, when you consider what works are selling for on Ethereum. And you can't get any gloom tube on Ethereum that I know of. You can get a one of one here. Let's just see. 275 to exart palation. So pretty good deal if you ask me. And a cool work.
00:15:26.564 - 00:15:50.274, Speaker A: Tv dinner. Classic, classic, classic. As gloom tube continues to just cover our daily lives in a very poetic way. Continuing on, this is from the drankdao. So if you own the token, you would have gotten this Minta work as a freebie. And I won't do art within art again. So a play on the Simpsons.
00:15:50.274 - 00:16:20.646, Speaker A: And of course, Minta is the meta artist who is constantly doing screenshots and meta. And so what I like about it is she turns it into a work in a work and I won't do art within art again. Playing off of the Simpsons and Bart Simpson. Minta as Bart Simpson. And then she is drawing it. So she is violating her own, you know, punishment here by doing another drawing in a drawing. So classic meta.
00:16:20.646 - 00:16:45.992, Speaker A: This is a digital drawing made with color charcoal. So if you want it, you have to put an offer in if you have not received it yet. And continuing on, another small masterpiece by Dan Control. We have a few breakfast pieces here, so get your coffee ready. I love these things. I love this work. And it really fits within Dan Control's whole, I don't know, theme.
00:16:45.992 - 00:16:58.224, Speaker A: Mocha pot. The coffee is ready. I think this sold out right away. Or it was burned. Was there another copy? I'm getting more and more. Yeah, here we go. I bet this sold out right away.
00:16:58.224 - 00:17:23.272, Speaker A: Three tezos each. So flew off the shelves, sold within seven minutes. So it's interesting, I guess coffee is a theme that people like. So interesting. And speaking of coffee, do you have your bacon, egg and cheese biscuit from tres et Rodanx, formerly known as vax machine. Vax Machinevich, also known as Wasteman Goldminevich. With another beautiful work.
00:17:23.272 - 00:17:51.372, Speaker A: I picked one up. I love this little series on breakfast menu exclusives. And we got another breakfast work that I thought just. It's hilarious how these things just naturally curate a pixelated breakfast work. And who's this? Joni B. Put one out. Is this a one of one? This is a one of one breakfast pixel work which incorporates some coffee from dan control and some breakfast muffin business, or at least some.
00:17:51.372 - 00:18:10.228, Speaker A: Is that a pancake? Maybe? And some bacon and maybe some scrambled eggs. Looks like a delicious breakfast. I'm hungry. So anyways, there you go. That is Joni B. Breakfast de Sayuno, continuing on. This is an artist I've never seen before.
00:18:10.228 - 00:18:31.354, Speaker A: Chepperton Raw work in progress Tuesday on super rare. So I just thought that was kind of interesting. So to look at this sort of pixelated abstract work. So I went to more of. So I went to Cheperton Raw's page. French glitch artist making videos and breaking them with code. I made a video clip for Ariana Grande.
00:18:31.354 - 00:18:46.572, Speaker A: So here's a work that he's working on. I think it's a he and Thomas Clay. I guess that's the name. Thomas Clay. So here's the super rare work. And yeah, going for a nice price. Three point or 2.9
00:18:46.572 - 00:18:56.504, Speaker A: ETH, 2.69 ETH. Getting a nice price. And is this. It's auctions. I'm more and more convinced. And Loremy putting in a bid there.
00:18:56.504 - 00:19:12.904, Speaker A: Yeah. So reserves and auctions. So I don't know what I'm. All of us are waiting for. I don't know what I'm waiting for. Just make some time to put some auctions out there and hope for the best. And this is also his work on object.
00:19:12.904 - 00:19:31.824, Speaker A: So all basically sold out. Selling for 200 tezos, 220 for these one of ones. So very nice. Continuing on. This was a work by Ed Marolla, which I thought, okay, interesting pixelated work. But then I played the music. The music.
00:19:31.824 - 00:19:59.970, Speaker A: And the music really made it for me. Just kind of fun. And so I bought it right away once I heard the music. So just really fun, uplifting. Some of the other works that Ed puts out is uplifting. We were talking about it. I don't know if he makes his own music or if it's a collaboration.
00:19:59.970 - 00:20:18.006, Speaker A: We'll take a look anyway. Too much fun. Sound and pixel, I assume it's all by Edmarrola Tutezos. How cool is that? I've never seen anything quite like that. An abstract painting with music. Continuing on. This is cool.
00:20:18.006 - 00:20:45.562, Speaker A: Acid soup. This came out on the 16th like everything else is like the last 24 hours. From my understanding here, guys, that's when something's going on. And something's been going on for a while out here in NFT land. But the amount of solid product and which seems to be improving that's coming out is remarkable. Let's just put it that way. Error in the paint program.
00:20:45.562 - 00:21:14.844, Speaker A: So we just have here from acid soup, paint dropping out of the canvas. Nice and simple. Buy it for twelve edition of Tan. Continuing on, brave with a interesting pixel work. Let's just bring it up back to our. The toy machine at the carnival or whatever, that you never win the toy, the arcade. I guess it's kind of a poetic work from Brave.
00:21:14.844 - 00:21:33.716, Speaker A: Some nice eight bit music. This goes on for two minutes. I'll just go a little further here if we can. Anyways, you get the pitch. Yeah. And you get the beat. So really cool.
00:21:33.716 - 00:21:49.756, Speaker A: It's like half music video. It's almost like a music video because it's moving. Otherwise I'd say it's more like a single. Interesting, interesting. So new work from Brave Arcade. Afternoon. During my childhood, play in arcade was a passion.
00:21:49.756 - 00:22:00.898, Speaker A: Every coin my mother gave, I used play. Feels good to put that part of me in pixels. Amen. Brave. Amen. I totally relate to that. Another pixel work, this time from geek.
00:22:00.898 - 00:22:29.542, Speaker A: Bath time. Time to take a bath. So just a simple work from geek. Someone smoking in the bath with some incense going on here. So you can get that for Atezos 50, almost free edition of seven. Another work by Acidboy, kind of in that same theme that he was doing that we saw the other day. Again, I just find this series where you can see that flashing thing come in again.
00:22:29.542 - 00:22:52.748, Speaker A: Acid boy has been kind of investigating this kind of hallucinatory abstraction. There's a term for you, hallucinatory abstraction. For as long as I've been on tezos for probably a couple of years. At least, I'm guessing. Yeah, it's starting to get really. It always was sophisticated. This one's like super sophisticated, in my opinion.
00:22:52.748 - 00:23:17.306, Speaker A: Like just a really, really nice work might have been burned. So I don't know what the deal is there, but moving on. So another work by Turkirak, and you might remember them from the CEO's with pink shoes. So this is for five tazos. What is it, foot fetish or something? International foot fetish Day. A little risque. So we're having fun over here.
00:23:17.306 - 00:23:46.090, Speaker A: Just an interesting drawing. I like Terkarak's work because it's kind of edgy, you know, like it has an edge to it. Like this isn't just some simple drawing, it's got an edge. Continuing on, mote, a winner in the morning. And I thought this was just a really nice, also poetic work. This is by the artist that did the. The person at the immigration booth who was giving the finger to the.
00:23:46.090 - 00:24:37.644, Speaker A: So interesting work. And I really liked this because it was kind of positive. A winner in the morning. Digital painting, because so much contemporary art is negative. And I mean, it's ambiguous too, because you could argue, well, there's a gun on the table. Is that positive? But what I see here, and with all the tattoos and everything, what I see here is someone who is trying to get from gangland to all sudden writing down his goals, which if you have troubles and you struggle with depression and you feel like your life isn't going anywhere, first thing you should do, one of the things you have to do is write down your goals. Because writing things down basically programs it into your unconscious.
00:24:37.644 - 00:25:05.690, Speaker A: That is the theory. And it makes perfect sense. So I found this to be actually a very poetic work here. You know, he's got his coffee or whatever it is and he's writing down his goals. This is, you know, this is what we should all be celebrating. Politicians, frankly, should be, you know, this is probably out of the US or whatever country this is out of. They should be going to works like this and say more of this, more of this.
00:25:05.690 - 00:25:20.906, Speaker A: This is what we want. Put it on my campaign poster. You know, this is. This is it. This is the spirit we are looking for. So really cool work there from Mota Mt. New work from Kappa playing.
00:25:20.906 - 00:25:37.786, Speaker A: You know, it reminds me of that rat cloak work with the. Also with the crucifixion, but different. So sage instead of the. I can't remember what those. I should really know what those letters INRi. I can't remember. I should know that supreme.
00:25:37.786 - 00:26:05.594, Speaker A: So money coming out of the underwear. So again, all of the classic sort of mystery and mayhem that you're gonna find in a kappa work with some landscape burning and another cross. It's interesting here. See the chain here? This seems to reference the robbers. You know, how Christ is crucified in the middle. And then there's the robbers that are on both sides. When you see the three crucifixions.
00:26:05.594 - 00:26:29.246, Speaker A: Very subtle move here to me because often Christ is crucified with a nail. Now maybe that's a nail. But it looks like the robbers are tied. I think they're tied up traditionally and not with the nail inside here. You can't tell if it's a nail because the. The money. You can't tell if that's the money or a nail.
00:26:29.246 - 00:26:46.014, Speaker A: It actually looks like a nail because there's some blood. But anyways, very interesting to put the tied up hands there. Interesting references. So cool work by Kappa. Going for $9.90. So still available for a song. You can buy it for a song there.
00:26:46.014 - 00:27:08.614, Speaker A: Tentezos. And continuing on, Moses Herzog, a new artist who I've never seen before, a digital painter. This is his first work. I think it's a he. Moses Herzog Tezos artist. First work sold really well. They put it on Twitter for 220 and sold out within like 20 minutes here.
00:27:08.614 - 00:27:27.970, Speaker A: Half an hour. So you gotta love that. As a new artist, let's just look at the Twitter. It's power of social media. Look, 46 followers. So hope springs eternal in this space. Again, what would you do in the physical art world if you did that? Like, if you have nobody knows who you are.
00:27:27.970 - 00:28:03.654, Speaker A: So this is the promise of digital art. You can get your work out there, basically have zero followers, and you sell out within 30 minutes of people like your work. As an artist, you can't ask for anything more than that. You just can't. Like, you should just be thrilled that you live and create at this time. Another work by our guy woke woke wok w o c colorbus, which I did know the reference of another beautiful digital work still available, I think, for eight tazos. Really nice work.
00:28:03.654 - 00:28:24.932, Speaker A: I might pick this up. So of course the portrait is a self portrait of Albrecht Durer. So here we go. And let's just go back. Yeah, so you can see a clear reference here quickly on this self portrait. So Durer is always a little earlier than I imagined. He's 1500.
00:28:24.932 - 00:29:07.794, Speaker A: This was painted. So a german Renaissance painter, Albrecht Durer, painted early in 1500, just before his 29th birthday. It is the last of his three painted self portraits. Art historians consider it the most personal, iconic and complex of his self portraits. And let's just go a little deeper here. The self portrait is most remarkable because of its resemblance to many earlier representations of Christ, and you can see it there. Art historians note the similarities with the conventions of religious painting, including its symmetry, dark tones, and the manner in which the artist directly confronts the viewer and raises his hands to the middle of his chest as if in the act of blessing.
00:29:07.794 - 00:29:44.314, Speaker A: Well, that's kind of some interpretation there. This is also kind of interesting. There's one more line I wanted to read here. Juror's face has the inflexibility and impersonal dignity of a mask, hiding the restless turmoil of anguish and passion within. Sometimes I think the art historians are projecting their own things, like it's possible. And when you read that, okay, this is a mask and it's hiding jurors angst and whatever, totally possible. But you could also argue there is a serenity here too.
00:29:44.314 - 00:30:29.900, Speaker A: So it gets very interpretive, some of this stuff. In its directness and apparent confrontation with the viewer, the self portrait is unlike any that came before. So thank you, walk, for doing your beautiful rendition here of Durer's self portrait. Give us something to talk about now here. This is a huge theme as well, which is this move from digital to physical and how well it works. I am a bit of a critic on physical to digital, although I think it can work. And I prefer it when you go physical to digital and then back to physical, then it works, but digital to physical, I think that's what's going on here with artists I'd never heard of.
00:30:29.900 - 00:31:07.444, Speaker A: Alpha Centauri kid, who seems to be doing very well with 32 and a half thousand followers. Look at this. And Christie's look. So super excited to present Alpha Centauri kids screen print, the muse, featuring the one and only Emma Watson in our post war and container contemporary art day sale on the 18 November. See online now and in person starting the 12 November. So just more reason why frankly, all artists should be also working physically because he doesn't need to wait for the blockchain sale NFT sale at Christie's. He's got his beautiful, beautiful, beautiful screen print here.
00:31:07.444 - 00:31:47.834, Speaker A: So I looked at Alpha Centauri kids profile and yeah, because I'd never actually heard letting the whispers of the muse guide my way. And I'll show you just some of the work. So if you go to the links first, he links to his open sea where you see, just so I'm not sure what to make of that. Again, there's, you know, not sure what to make of any of that. Okay, so that looks like a project or something. So. But here's some work from super rare, which doesn't actually look too much like the, was it Emma Watson? Except for maybe here.
00:31:47.834 - 00:32:29.164, Speaker A: But the prices are incredible. Now, I don't know if this is what it's based on, a, like a work behind here, but you see how far it looks. And it sold for 97 ETH in May, so $275,000. $273,000. So no wonder Christie's is interested because just the fees they can make off this kind of artist are significant. So Alpha Centauri kid, just an interesting case here. And what's also interesting is the digital works don't look a ton like the physical works, do they? So all very interesting.
00:32:29.164 - 00:32:46.274, Speaker A: Continuing on, Joe Rogan's dad with a very cool tribute to gloom tube. And so this is a hotel room. And gloom tube, of course, did these great hotel rooms. I love the one with the pizza box. They're all very poetic. And here are just some other great one of one. Yeah.
00:32:46.274 - 00:33:04.884, Speaker A: And then there's the collaboration between Joe Rogan's dad and gloom tube. So all totally awesome. This looks like it was done in AI. And so just a really cool work. Available for 22 tezos edition of 15. There is one that you can buy on secondary for 22. Mint price was 350.
00:33:04.884 - 00:33:33.914, Speaker A: Continuing on, a new work from Suom Sumi reusi, or however that is pronounced soom has a new new generation art studio. And so this is already selling for 30. So it sold out right away. I missed it. And so here's someone working in very untraditional art studio way. So a really nice piece, nice addition to the series. Maybe if you put an offer in, you might be able to get it for cheaper.
00:33:33.914 - 00:34:16.222, Speaker A: Yeah, people collecting a few of them. So yeah, you might be able to put an offer in. Continuing on. Also, Sumi has a new account on foundation where she's putting out this other series. And, you know, we were talking earlier about how AI kind of create certain outcomes like this reminds me a lot of vira and those houses, the inner houses. So that's sort of what I'm getting at in that earlier comment, how the technology, what I'm loosely calling AI, but which was astutely pointed out, this isn't, there's no ghost in the machine here. Pokebelly.
00:34:16.222 - 00:34:37.465, Speaker A: The technology is breeding certain results. And I'd argue that, you know, we're seeing it a little bit here. Now, of course, these are all done in their own way and with their own treatment, with their own perspective. So anyways, you can get these for point one. Im sum on foundation, I believe. Continuing on. Yeah, here they are.
00:34:37.465 - 00:34:50.452, Speaker A: Housing. Okay, so continuing on. We're almost done here. Redrum was just a fun work. Another AI work. I missed the GM. So here we go.
00:34:50.452 - 00:35:06.660, Speaker A: Okay. I kind of went with the coffee that we were drinking earlier here. And this was interesting too. I saw this thing called Pixel art magazine. So I went to the links and I was like, where's the magazine? I just see. Buy me a coffee. So that's the Patreon, Instagram, Twitter.
00:35:06.660 - 00:35:35.296, Speaker A: So then I went back, the most exclusive social magazine. Have you ever heard of a social magazine before? Maybe. You probably have, and it's probably just me who hasn't. But I think that's a really interesting concept. Basically, they're building a brand over social media, a magazine over Instagram and Twitter. I think it's brilliant and just super interesting. And of course, we love pixel art here, so go and check it out with that.
00:35:35.296 - 00:35:39.584, Speaker A: Thank you for joining me on today's episode. Until next time, take care.
