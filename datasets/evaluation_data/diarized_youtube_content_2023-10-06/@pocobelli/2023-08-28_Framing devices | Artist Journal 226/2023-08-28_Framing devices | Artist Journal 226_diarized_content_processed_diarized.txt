00:00:05.960 - 00:00:33.172, Speaker A: Welcome back, everyone, to a new week. Artist journal, August 28, 2023. Broadcasting from the high seas, the imagination, in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and I welcome you back. I hope you had a great weekend here. Let's get right into it here. I am trying to.
00:00:33.172 - 00:00:58.180, Speaker A: I know some people don't like it. I'm sure some people do like it and just don't say anything. I am trying to reduce the length of the show just to, like half an hour or something. I think that'd be better. You know, probably in a perfect world, it would be 20 minutes, but I think that's over optimistic. And, yeah, so who knows? The debate continues in my mind. So let me just try and keep good pace here.
00:00:58.180 - 00:01:42.172, Speaker A: So why do I love this work by demon ego? Of course, you recognize the artist here, I'm sure, if you've watched this program. And for me, what was really impressive, and it was a very indirect thing. You see, of course, there is physical artwork here in the monsters here, and even underneath this kind of gif eyes, my verb that I've created these different kind of, you know, screen resolutions here. More of a vertical one over here, kind of traditional square pixel over here. What I love about this, and there's like a figure that is dithered. What I love about this is this integration. It looks.
00:01:42.172 - 00:02:29.808, Speaker A: I don't want to say it looks effortless, but it is a really well done integration of digital and physical, which is not as easy as it sounds. Anybody that's ever done that, you run into a lot of almost overly sharp contrasts. I would argue when you are working with both digital and physical, it's kind of a, you know, again, it's easier said than done. And what I thought was quite effective in this piece was how well integrated both were. You know, oftentimes when you see digital and physical together, it kind of. The physical kind of calls out a little bit too much. But here, I don't feel that.
00:02:29.808 - 00:03:13.858, Speaker A: And I think maybe it's just a testament to demon ego working so much with both, you know, digital and physical mediums that starting to get really good at integrating the two. And, I mean, on a technical level, maybe it's as simple as, okay, we'll put some GiF patterning below this ink drawing here, using the negative space of the face here, also here, and then not here. And then leaving kind of these physical markings over here. And then maybe to kind of finish the job, you put like this, again, giphyzed writing over top. You know, sometimes it's that simple. You know, over top. And here it's on the digital, but here it's on the physical.
00:03:13.858 - 00:03:48.062, Speaker A: You know, this piece of paper here, it may be that simple, but it's not so simple. Again, this is another deceptively, deceptively simple work. Look at the kind of really interesting pixelation pattern here. Almost kind of randomly put, like a Rauschenberg. Here you have another square of just kind of random pixels in movement here. And over here, look at this interesting kind of animated gif at the top of, like, these red, different kind of squares. There's a lot going on here, even to these kind of noise.
00:03:48.062 - 00:04:50.362, Speaker A: Looks like a wok noise here in the yellow and the blue and also along the right. So just a really, I think, well integrated digital and physical piece. And again, little details like this. See this green and this pink, which are so easy to take for granted once they're there. But until you put it there, imagine this dithered image without, like, this black and white. Without this, would it be as well integrated? So for me, what I see going on here is demon ego is getting very good at integrating these different diverse kinds of content and putting it together and harmonizing it so that it looks like a piece, unifying it, ultimately. And even in here, you see what looks like a photograph of sorts is kinda flashing with this kind of radio wave, sine wave green animation.
00:04:50.362 - 00:05:12.262, Speaker A: So again, another deceptively complex work. And then look at this final detail. Look at the sketchbook. You can still see the shadow of the sketchbook all along here. What is a strange gray line? Again, just integrating everything, leaving the mistakes. Brilliant. So just really nice work here from demon ego.
00:05:12.262 - 00:05:28.658, Speaker A: The long legs of a spider and the abstract wing of a fly. A poetic title. And here's a whole story here. August 23 by demon ego. There are six left at ten tezos each. Very cool. A few comments here I wanted to touch on.
00:05:28.658 - 00:05:43.626, Speaker A: On. Remember the pizza box show? Marcel Muntianu. Oh, my God. What is the beautiful universe we live in? We live in. Starting day from the art review. Oil painted pizza boxes. Thank you for your show, Adrian.
00:05:43.626 - 00:06:08.420, Speaker A: I want to see it as a morning tv show to start every day in the right mood. Yeah, it's almost like an alternative reality. We're heading towards the singularity here. If you're starting to get art shows in the morning, I mean, I kind of love the idea. And that's what this is more by accident than by planning. It is a morning art show, which is kind of hilarious. I mean, which, you know, it's kind of surreal.
00:06:08.420 - 00:06:19.720, Speaker A: In its own way. I mean, most art shows you'd think would be at like 08:00 p.m. Right after your day of work. The sun has gone down. Let's start the art show. Not here, my friends. So glad you're enjoying the show.
00:06:19.720 - 00:06:42.024, Speaker A: And I love the pizza boxes, too. I'm glad you enjoyed that, too. Marcel McRender's great show, Adrian. The Kappn gift shop piece is indeed a vaporizer of dubious nature. A wonderful birthday gift from Cap'n, spawned from a conversation months ago. Was so surprised and touched to see it brought to life and sent to my wallet and is now one of my prized pieces. Have a great week.
00:06:42.024 - 00:06:53.084, Speaker A: Have a. Have a great weekend. So, yeah, just very cool. And so we were right. It was, in fact, a vaporizer of sorts. These days, you can't even tell. I mean, everything's changing so quickly here.
00:06:53.084 - 00:07:15.600, Speaker A: Retro Manny. Great show, Adrian. And thanks for the feature regarding object going multi chain. I hope they're listening. The job of marketplaces is to serve the artists in and collectors to serve artists and collectors in the best way they can. And there's definitely a gap for some much needed evolution right now. Zora has been growing for a while, but interesting to see them gaining more popularity.
00:07:15.600 - 00:07:38.244, Speaker A: You know, I thought Zora was new, but apparently they're pretty new. Sorry, they're. They're not that new. I guess we'll check out ten. Not heard of that yet. I guess they're making a big push to get a lot of these Tezos artists, which is probably a very smart move to just, you know. And as we're seeing, the artists are doing well out of these free mints and I'll get to that in a second.
00:07:38.244 - 00:07:54.624, Speaker A: Thank you. PP Universal show must go on. Metapoco NFT soldier indeed. You have to be in order to keep a schedule like that. Stubble suits you, man. Thank you. As I said, the weekend came early there, so we'll leave that like an ongoing open conversation there.
00:07:54.624 - 00:08:10.194, Speaker A: Sabato. I think it's wild. I'm going to be paying next month's rent with art I gave away for free. And this is on Zora. Okay. It's almost like alternative economics of abundance is possible. Not everything needs to be a vicious cycle of scarcity and speculation.
00:08:10.194 - 00:08:52.128, Speaker A: Anyway, happy Saturday with this beautiful kind of non finito here, this beautiful glitch rom, where part of the date is missing, part of Nintendo is missing. So for those that are new to the show, the non finito Michelangelo is thought to be the inventor, leaving the work purposefully unfinished. That is the theory. And some pretty major authorities on Michelangelo believe that was the case, that he purposely left some of those sculptures unfinished. And so a real. There you see the genius of Michelangelo. Should that be the case? Because that is a paradigm shift of epic proportions.
00:08:52.128 - 00:09:15.244, Speaker A: I mean, there's something inherently kind of modern about it. And you see it all the way to Warhol and over to these glitch roms. So interesting. Zora. Now, these are free mints, but of course, Zora charges a very, very small fee, like $5, let's say. And then half of that goes to the artist about, and the other half goes to the platform. Kind of interesting.
00:09:15.244 - 00:09:42.414, Speaker A: That is a real fee, as we're going to see now. Opensea, check this out. So just in that context, while Zora is sharing fees, giving artists more money, Opensea pro. And this kind of blew my mind. This was on. I saw this in the Medici Minutes newsletter. With the upcoming changes to creator fees or artists royalties, as we like to call them here, we will add.
00:09:42.414 - 00:10:46.536, Speaker A: So first of all, remember, they got rid of the artist royalties or they're not going to pay them out anymore or make them optional for buyers. With upcoming changes to creator fees, we will add a half a percent platform fee to all OpenSeA listings and offers created on OpenSeA Pro starting August 31. This change is necessary to prevent inorganic. So another lame excuse in order to prevent inorganic volume and keep our data as accurate as possible. So OpeNC Pro, I mean, again, feel free to disagree, but OpenSeA Pro seems to be giving, you know, at least artists or just, you know, people in the community, every reason in the world possible to look for alternatives, you know, as, you know, as was being said, said there by retro Manny. Like we need, you know, I hope they're listening object going multi chain. So just getting ahead of ourselves here.
00:10:46.536 - 00:11:27.178, Speaker A: So just another more evidence that Opensea truly doesn't care about the artist. I mean, again, feel free to disagree here. So half a percent platform fee as they get rid of the artist's royalties or make them optional. So very disappointing, but not surprising, unfortunately. Eilay an honor and absolute thrill to be included amongst 27 artists in the upcoming emotions exhibition at Weare, Unit London, curated by Claire Silver. Focusing on post Internet art and the cultural movement. Hiki Komori, art and isolation in the age of Hikikomori.
00:11:27.178 - 00:12:09.770, Speaker A: I don't really know too much about Hikikomori, I have to admit. I do know we are unit London here. This is kind of like what I would call younger generation contemporary art organization out of London, kind of in what I'd call like that. I guess they would be millennial, maybe a little younger, kind of contemporary London art scene. So it's interesting here. Like, I had heard of them before I'd ever heard of NFTs or before I ever got into crypto. Like they've been around now for a few years.
00:12:09.770 - 00:12:42.204, Speaker A: And it's interesting to see weare unit, London working with NFTs. And I don't think it's the first time, but it's still interesting. A lot of people kind of left NFTs now that it's not as popular, but they are continuing. And so just kind of interesting to see that big congratulations and shout out to Ilay and who has been instrumental in helping grow this show. So that is a. This I don't think is Ilay, but I'm not sure. This is just a promo image for that show.
00:12:42.204 - 00:13:11.634, Speaker A: And let me just see where this came from here. One don't know. So I believe out of Indonesia. We can quickly check there, check the map here. Well, let's see if that loads up. In the meantime, I just want to show, look at how young one noses and look at this great showing of physical work. So, you know, printing out the collages, framing them very beautifully and framing is an art.
00:13:11.634 - 00:13:30.496, Speaker A: If you know an expert, it totally. It can save you a lot of money, let's put it that way. Another one of the million mistakes I've made is you got to learn how to frame properly. Otherwise you can buy a bunch of frames that don't work. This is quite nice. This black frame here does made a really nice job. The work looks great here.
00:13:30.496 - 00:13:48.724, Speaker A: I don't think I've ever seen that one. Don't knows work. So just very cool here at the ground play exhibition. And big thanks to ground control for the invite. So just really cool. And there you see from the creation of Adam. So cool collage work in physical form from one don't knows.
00:13:48.724 - 00:14:05.488, Speaker A: Look at that. So nice work there and great to see and continuing on. So, yeah, Bangkok. So that's Thailand. I believe so, yeah. So Bangkok. Cool.
00:14:05.488 - 00:14:19.664, Speaker A: So maybe out of Thailand or at least that's where the show is. I don't know where one don't knows is though. Continuing on. Just some cool works here. This is the one I want to start with. Information. If you can read that, it says information.
00:14:19.664 - 00:14:48.030, Speaker A: Ruth Wolf Rayfeldt, born 1932. One of the few female artists from the DDR or from East Germany, the communist side of Germany. So pretty interesting work. I believe this is from the 1980s. So Ruth Wolf Greyfeld would have been probably in the forties or fifties when this was made. And this is typewriter work, as we'll see here. And you see it's like o's.
00:14:48.030 - 00:15:27.864, Speaker A: And there was, you know, some of the conceptual minimalist artists from the seventies like to experiment with this as well. Can't remember who it was. It was Dan Flavin or Carl Andre or it was kind of part of, I remember going to a show at Hamburger Banoff, one of the main contemporary art museums here in Berlin. And you know, they kind of had that classic stuff where it's like an apple but written with the words apple. And then you make an image out of the words. So this use of text as a visual element and the visuality of text actually. And there's something else that's pretty interesting.
00:15:27.864 - 00:15:54.708, Speaker A: You see its information is written across, but then you see information is written up here along diagonally up at the top. So just cool work over here. Let's just look at the other work. This looks like collagen with pen is actually what that looks like. I don't know what it is though, because it's done pretty precisely. So maybe that's done with the computer too. And here playing with what look like o's or zeros, maybe more typewriter work.
00:15:54.708 - 00:16:12.918, Speaker A: I brought up the website here. Matches for Ruf, Wolf Rayfeldt and on this really cool website, textmode.org comma. And you see here, they don't even know exactly when it was made. 1980s typewriter. So this was made with a typewriter. So typewriter art, pretty cool.
00:16:12.918 - 00:16:29.758, Speaker A: I mean not the greatest scan here, but pretty cool work here. So I guess this was probably made with a typewriter too then. These kind of interesting arrows. So pretty cool. There's that information work. Typewriter works mostly from the eighties. More of her work here.
00:16:29.758 - 00:16:53.626, Speaker A: Okay, so just kind of interesting to see found on Twitter walk recently collected via arzora. So more people trying out Zora. I will actually be minting a work. They reached out to me. I think they're reaching out to just like a lot of the Tezos artists. And I think it's great. Who doesn't want to just find a new audience? Find, you know, this is on optimism.
00:16:53.626 - 00:17:13.226, Speaker A: So an ethereum L2. And who doesn't want to just find new collectors, new audiences and everything. And it looks like they're have a really interesting sales strategy. Mint for nothing will share the fees. I mean it's quite brilliant actually. Here is the homepage. I thought I'd bring it up again.
00:17:13.226 - 00:17:32.064, Speaker A: And just, you know, here you see mental noise, stippin pixel. We're gonna look at this work here in a second. And hola. One pez. And there is Pamelo sereno Cirello. Let's get the name right here. Ceyrone.
00:17:32.064 - 00:17:51.624, Speaker A: Pamela Ceyroni with another cool work here. 365 minted. Okay, so. And I think you're getting about $2, 250 per work. They're stippin Pixel 250. So nice little, you know, not bad at all. Especially probably why you're seeing a lot of people try it out is the Tezos price isn't wonderful.
00:17:51.624 - 00:18:21.134, Speaker A: So it's kind of a nice time to try this out. So, yeah, I'm gonna be minting something probably today. The work is ready. And here is that super awesome work by stippinpixel. And again, I like to talk about how, you know, different blockchains can bring different kinds of work, can inspire different kinds of works. And I don't really remember seeing a ton of stippin pixel cat paintings, but this looks great, doesn't it? Look at that. So, just a nice piece.
00:18:21.134 - 00:18:50.582, Speaker A: And again, that, you know, making it look easy in what's being left out here. First of all, the background is completely blotted out, just blue. And then you have this chair on top, but not bothering to color the cushion. Kind of a nice move. And then you see the outline of the cat over here in the arm, and you think, oh, maybe that should be black, not blue. But then you put, it's quite beautiful artistically. And then you see how helpful it is for the ears over here, because if you made it black, this might seem more like a blob over here than a head.
00:18:50.582 - 00:19:17.278, Speaker A: And then that beautiful little pink tongue. Brilliant, brilliant work here. And, of course, that contrast between the moving and the static pixels. And just one final comment on that. Another beautiful detail here by this, you know, expert experimental pixel artist. Look at the, you know, four to the floor pixelation at the back. See this gray and white, which is static with this moving cat.
00:19:17.278 - 00:20:01.286, Speaker A: And then, kind of like the mask changes a little bit. Quite effective. So just really, really nice work here, from stippin pixel. Continuing on, speaking of cats and pixel art to the Internet's, you know, two of the Internet's favorite themes, the six of cups. So persisting here, this is where, you know, like, mandal is doing really well and is showing a lot of persistence, because you can start these projects of, like, you know, I'm going to do the tarot cards. But this is where the things get real, is about maybe 25% the way through your project. So, manital keeping it going.
00:20:01.286 - 00:20:48.016, Speaker A: And again, kind of reminds me of working on this peloponnesian war series that I did. Over 200 images, and I reduced it to 200 for what was released. But, I mean, when you're halfway through it, it is a marathon, but you've started it, and you feel like, okay, I have to finish this. So I'll just say, very impressive. And once you finish a project like that, one of these huge projects, there's something to be said for it, because then you can look back to it the rest of your life. Then you have, like. I mean, this is arguably a contribution, a significant contribution to the history of tarot cards, of, you know, oh, you know, like, this is so 2023.
00:20:48.016 - 00:21:25.102, Speaker A: 2022. This is so 2020s, right? And so there's no reason this shouldn't be included in the history of tarot cards. And so, all of a sudden, you know, there's something to be said for these massive projects here, six of cups, and again, 550 taste, 5.5 tezos. So you're looking at, like, $3.50 cents here, maybe $4 to collect one of these beautiful works here. So, nice work from manital popple with a new work here from the sanitarium series and another monster here.
00:21:25.102 - 00:22:08.532, Speaker A: And using that beautiful technique that he developed last Christmas. Remember that? So it's now we're at the end of August, so it's just amazing. And I think he had, like, an old laptop or something, so decided to try something new over the holidays and look at where he is now. And one other thing I quite like is, you see, we're kind of back to this idea of the. So he's got these kind of shimmering pixels, but then over top kind of leaves, these, you know, static pixels, which don't change color. There's some brains there, some moving branches, and again, almost like eyes coming out of the branch as the tongue goes through with this kind of skeletal figure here. Interesting work.
00:22:08.532 - 00:22:33.110, Speaker A: And pretty creepy, as usual. 30 tezos on secondary from popple, and that sold for 16 on primary. Cool work. Another one, this time collaborating with a narrator and explainer gallery. So here you can start to see. Recognize popple's work in the shimmering here, pixels here. And then in the middle, we see a narrator's work.
00:22:33.110 - 00:22:55.244, Speaker A: And just a cool framing device put together by popple here for this, a narrator work. And I think I saw that this. This was. I can't think it was popple that was saying that there was a show in China that was being put together, that was being. Some of the work was being shown. I assume it's explainer. Not sure, but yeah, pretty cool situation there.
00:22:55.244 - 00:23:16.274, Speaker A: Looks like the start of a series. One illusion, more cool pixel art here. Axing dark kermit. So playing with a meme here, Internet meme. And then I'm assuming, but don't want to assume too far here. Maybe some AI text here and here. Dark Kermit kind of looks like a magic card.
00:23:16.274 - 00:23:46.370, Speaker A: And then we have the classic kermit the frog as the Jedi or the emperor on the dark side of the force. Or however you'd say that from Star wars, that meme. So pretty cool work from uxing. 115 tezos on secondary. Sold out on primary, probably within a minute. Yeah, sold out within a minute for 66 tezos edition of only eleven. So pretty low edition here.
00:23:46.370 - 00:24:07.644, Speaker A: And cool. Just kind of different pixelation here. Nice movement. A lot to appreciate there. Fornax void, who really reminds me of our friend tradscape here. Let's see if we. I'm not going to move my mic because I moved my mic earlier and it killed my video.
00:24:07.644 - 00:24:30.104, Speaker A: I had to restart. It's kind of got tradscape written all over it. So very cool work here. Nice loop. Again with that kind of medieval theme. And of course, Fornax void. And this is only seven Tezos edition of 5011 have sold.
00:24:30.104 - 00:25:00.484, Speaker A: Remember that work here, where it was like this medieval night, but then there was a pool and almost like a train from a modern city kind of going through it, but then with a medieval flag. Interesting, you know, unusual work. But again, here I see our friend tradscape. So perhaps a new project fornax void. Beautiful work. Another great artist, Kujeb, I think, sent me actually a copy of this. Let's just check here.
00:25:00.484 - 00:25:22.994, Speaker A: Yes, this is the one. And to have done with the judgment of God. So a quote from a. Artaud. I can't remember Antoine Artaud. Maybe when you have a body without organs, then you'll have delivered him from all his automatic reactions and restored him to his true freedom. Maybe a surrealist poet, perhaps? I know the name.
00:25:22.994 - 00:25:41.502, Speaker A: So buy for 100 tezos on secondary, more. Just really awesome. Original textured work by Kujib, also known as hastruba waffle. Just a totally awesome work here. It kind of looks like a puppet. A little bit on a. With an alien.
00:25:41.502 - 00:26:21.234, Speaker A: And remember, Kujib, I think, has the alien theme. There's that awesome work with the two alien, I think, with keyboards, that beautiful work, like synths, not kind of keyboard like this, but since look at this great background here too. So again, just making it look incredibly easy, but I'm sure it's not, otherwise we'd all be making these kind of masterpieces here. So kujap with another beautiful work. And yes, I will be watching scanners at some point. So continuing on, San Dilum. So this is bzaya, also known as three a, five a, one a, as I used to call them.
00:26:21.234 - 00:26:39.986, Speaker A: Dylan. So just an interesting work. I thought this series was done, but maybe an addition here. Benedici de estampita de rip, Dylan. So interesting piece here. I didn't see it minted anywhere. So I have the instagram up here and a new one from Morlacos, 1908.
00:26:39.986 - 00:26:59.912, Speaker A: George Fay Kackett. So huge fan of these baseball cards, especially the super old ones. Weight 450 pounds. World's dankest ballplayer, member of Landos baseball team. And you see Murlaco's classic style here. So really interesting work here. Really unusual and interesting.
00:26:59.912 - 00:27:13.390, Speaker A: Morlaco's trademark eyes with the yellow eyes, with the red irises. Beautiful. Only three tezos edition of 20. Only three left. Get it while you can. Daniel W. Throne.
00:27:13.390 - 00:27:38.918, Speaker A: So I believe this might be the last in the Ar Scoesia because this is double o. And sometimes Daniel W. Will send these out to people who've collected everything. I'm not sure exactly what happened, but a cool work here. Not exactly sure. Again, familiar, but unrecognizable at the same time with that print paper and doing a really nice job there. Throne.
00:27:38.918 - 00:28:07.064, Speaker A: Kind of enigmatic. And yes, these were transferred so probably to previous collectors of all the series, perhaps continuing on Timothy Julien, old school. And here clearly looks like a school done within Timothy Julien's style here. Filling in the blanks with this nice kind of patterning here. Just really interesting work as usual. And really nice illustrations and a cool series. And probably really.
00:28:07.064 - 00:28:25.744, Speaker A: Oh, buy now for five tezos. That's on secondary. Yeah, usually selling for next to nothing. Fifty cents. I mean, this is probably like $0.35 on primary. It's a good way to sell out, is make it for almost free, and then people will buy several copies here.
00:28:25.744 - 00:28:57.390, Speaker A: So cool work from Timothy Julien. I'm sure you recognize the artist here. I quite like the comment. Is it yes, or am I just too lazy lately? So probably referring to this huge brush mark here, or is it just kind of done? Is kind of interesting. Like, I mean, there's a real it got me thinking, like, I wonder. It's an interesting question, you know, and you see this great brush here? There's something to be said for just kind of loose and fast and everything. Like it probably is done.
00:28:57.390 - 00:29:23.050, Speaker A: It kind of looks done to me, you know, but if you made it and it went really fast, you might think, well, maybe this isn't enough work. Trinity by Uri J also on Zora. So three works here, and they are all free. Seven minted, 15 minted, nine minted here. So let's take a closer look. So this is for one more day here. Again, these are like free mints, right? Or probably $5 with the fees.
00:29:23.050 - 00:29:37.440, Speaker A: I mean, maybe it's less, not sure. So that does have to be taken into account if you're collecting here. But here is one, here's another. Again, just trademark. You can totally recognize Yurij's work. Number two. And here is number one.
00:29:37.440 - 00:29:58.746, Speaker A: So a cool kind of series of three experimental works here. Or abstract works, maybe, or semi abstract works. It's a Uri jay work. That's what it is. Speaking of experiments, look at this rad experiment by Kappen undos test. So of course Kapn does figments. And also captain's gift shop.
00:29:58.746 - 00:30:31.384, Speaker A: Look at this super cool experimentation here. So continuing to push the limits here and uses a lot of old software. I mean, it's tempted to almost see like a little bit of Kidpix, but I don't think this is Kidpix, but it almost has that feel to it. So, you know, does a lot of experiments with different unusual, hard to find retro softwares, retro tools. Edmarola, who again is going to be on the spaces actually this Wednesday. I need to put out the tweet. I will probably put it out later today.
00:30:31.384 - 00:30:57.844, Speaker A: We vo with a couple of works here. And actually I was just on the YouTube channel that he had where I think I was the one watcher for a little bit at the very start of his last YouTube. So I didn't say anything, but I thought it was kind of funny. So great YouTube show, by the way. He puts a cool echo with the audio. It's quite a very nice production to go with the morning tv. I guess that would be.
00:30:57.844 - 00:31:20.456, Speaker A: That one comes out in the evening, though, revo. So just a cool experimental pixel art piece. Again, kind of that blurry pixel art. Very unusual and interesting. Here's another piece. This is an open edition 19 have been minted for a Tezos logo joe. So see if we can get so very small canvas size here.
00:31:20.456 - 00:31:55.186, Speaker A: And this kind of octopus, Doctor Octopus figure, although these are snakes coming out of the body here. So again, if you like Ed Marolla's work, it's well worth checking out the YouTube because you learn a lot just about how he proceeds. Very kind of carefree and having fun, improvised and just really cool. And again, that's all that work. I mean, super prolific. And then you end up with, what was that work called for object one? Was it the artist is dreaming? The artist is dreaming. And then you get masterpieces like that.
00:31:55.186 - 00:32:13.562, Speaker A: Come along, Santiago. Rug pull. Cyborg coming back to earth. So I thought this was interesting here. Interesting piece by Santiago. Just changing it up a little bit, particularly the canvas size. It looks like a 16 by nine canvas size.
00:32:13.562 - 00:32:35.132, Speaker A: Maybe this is being made for a show which is using tvs, perhaps so. Or maybe just playing with the 16 by nine ratio, if that's what it is here. Really nice kind of interesting pixel work. Three Tazos edition of 25. Art made with homemade tools. Interestingly. And this is Haiti rocket with a really nice piece here.
00:32:35.132 - 00:32:57.226, Speaker A: Vscape ten seven. 3d generative wasteland, ten. So again, probably finding some sort of really cool retro software and vintage tools. Vintage software and just really cool, great colors here. Seems to be getting better at it. Edition of one. Let's just see who this went to.
00:32:57.226 - 00:33:08.894, Speaker A: And this was burned. Okay, so they were listed, none were sold within 20 minutes. Burned all twelve. And now it's a one of one. Wow, pretty cool. Mech TXT. I'm getting closer.
00:33:08.894 - 00:33:36.408, Speaker A: So this we saw the work in progress. Kind of has a bit of a different feel. A little bit more detail perhaps in the trunk, a little bit more color. Feels very video game esque. Kind of reminds me of Sierra games with King's quest. Kind of has that vibe to it a little bit. Anyway, interesting experimentation here, adding, I feel a few colors in here, in the tree and even in the sky.
00:33:36.408 - 00:33:50.740, Speaker A: So very cool experiments here from Mec TXT. Let's see what happened. Edition of 20 offers have come in quite high and none accepted yet. So I guess the offers are still coming in. Probably for a deadline. Pretty high. Look at that.
00:33:50.740 - 00:34:17.024, Speaker A: 42, 40, 37. Gotta love that for an addition edition of 20. And this probably will come with it. I don't know, check the Twitter feed for info. But I could he off TXT will often pair works together and give you like the small version if you buy the big version, where I started. So nice, kind of more minimal work here. And a tree branch, or bough as they call it.
00:34:17.024 - 00:34:43.846, Speaker A: And interesting kind of patterning frame in the frame here. Nice work from Mech TXT archaics. Michael Macasso Pamelo Cerrone on Zora. So another cool work here. It looks great, doesn't it? It's funny to see these works in a new context. On Zora, there's just something. Or like being on Ethereum, it shouldn't make a difference.
00:34:43.846 - 00:34:55.466, Speaker A: But there is just. It does give it a different kind of frame. Speaking of framing. And here is just a really nice piece here. 365 minted. So the market is loving it. 11 hours to go.
00:34:55.466 - 00:35:21.110, Speaker A: And again, you can just mint these right on Zora, doctor Eames. So nice piece there. And here you have Francois Gamma on Ethereum, on foundation reserve of 0.12. And again, we have a cat here, and a person and some sort of 3d object. So. And look at this. The person goes right through the cat.
00:35:21.110 - 00:35:36.422, Speaker A: Almost reminiscent of those spiegels maskinens that we're seeing the palm tree go through the computer. I mean, quite different, but reminiscent. Interesting piece. X zero one. Kind of experimental there. My cheese, my rules. Rip hen.
00:35:36.422 - 00:35:46.960, Speaker A: Still here. Now, I was going to say rip hen. This must be old. And it is. So I found this on Twitter. It's from November 11, 2022. I thought it was just an original composition here.
00:35:46.960 - 00:35:59.700, Speaker A: Here we have the. What looks like a cat. And then cheese. And then cheese on the other side of like the checkerboard here. Or the chessboard. Interesting piece. That's from 2022.
00:35:59.700 - 00:36:20.298, Speaker A: And here, August 25, 2023, Mangrahan revival one. So interesting piece here. Another cat with four eyes. A lot of experimentation going on. Interesting mix of the pixels here. The hard edged pixels in the painting. Kind of makes a pretty nice effect, doesn't it? Very interesting combination.
00:36:20.298 - 00:36:41.266, Speaker A: There's something kind of rich about what's going on here. And look at that frame here, too. Framing devices here. Interesting framing devices. And again, we have cool background here. Kind of almost reminiscent a little bit. Not quite, but a little bit of that demon ego at the start of the piece, too.
00:36:41.266 - 00:37:02.512, Speaker A: Just all these kind of this variety, this, you know, diverse imagery, kind of all being kind of smushed together. Revival one five tezos. And that is on secondary. Let's just see on primary. Sold for one tezos each. And human colonel, who also may be Santiago. I am the knight.
00:37:02.512 - 00:37:28.124, Speaker A: Now, I am thinking, see how he used here, the same ratio. It's like that 16 by nine tv ratio that we saw in the other work here. So interesting to see that. And of course, human kernel does these kind of experimental profile picture works. And again, kind of dynamic pixels contrasted with static pixels. Really interesting on the top left here, too. And this really flat kind of beige background.
00:37:28.124 - 00:37:44.684, Speaker A: At auction for 15 tezos. One of one. Has anybody bid so far? We shall see. Perhaps maybe we won't see. No bids so far. So you could get a cheap human kernel. One of one for maybe $10 here.
00:37:44.684 - 00:37:51.284, Speaker A: Another one. My, you. Some more pixel art here. Summer. I love it. Chilling out in the summer. Swimming pool.
00:37:51.284 - 00:38:19.218, Speaker A: And it is still summer, so we can feel great about that. And there the skeleton is hanging out on the beach in the pool, looking great with palm trees in the background. And another interesting framing device here. Continuing on Glitchtown arcade with a Nintendo glitch rom. And here we see someone falling. And just a cool kind of brief, uh, glitch here. And this is edition of ten.
00:38:19.218 - 00:38:39.842, Speaker A: There are nine left at 420. And here is another one by Mason. The third vissoft rom corruption and Hexedit game Boy work here. So we saw this with the question marks before and interesting square. So I guess that's more like a Game Boy screen. So interesting. Rom hack.
00:38:39.842 - 00:39:04.552, Speaker A: Rom corruption. And here's another one by Glitchtown arcade, where it glitches super fast. So interesting to see all these different versions, different approaches, shall we say, to glitch roms here and here. It's a speedboat racing game. Somebody throw me a life Boy game over one and edition of ten. There are six left at 420. Lorna Mills.
00:39:04.552 - 00:39:31.664, Speaker A: And it was funny, I was at an art show yesterday, and a friend of mine who runs this gallery, Peter Wild, and was saying, do you know Lorna? And he couldn't remember the last name. I was like, Lorna Mills? He's like, exactly. She's great. So anyways, here's a work by Lorna Mills called full choke and totally recognizable as hers. Another awesome color. I love the turquoise there with the green. Really nice work.
00:39:31.664 - 00:39:57.518, Speaker A: 15 tezos on primary, and there are 29 left. Renki with another work asa. This is Assa. And here, just another cool kind of animated abstract with a lot of noise, a lot of kind of feedback, a lot of delay. Just really cool bit of a op art kind of feel to it, too. Interesting piece. Kind of desaturated somewhat.
00:39:57.518 - 00:40:18.744, Speaker A: Not too much color, but there is color. And Eizo with a new cell phone here. This is a one of one. And this may have just been minted. And look at how great this looks. So very cool colors here with Eizos process. And let's just see 25 tezos and sold within an half an hour.
00:40:18.744 - 00:40:43.310, Speaker A: So nice work by Eizo there. And continuing on, a beautiful, very interesting AI artwork by Lily Illo, a most brave man. And this is finished. And she is part of a show that's coming up. And this was. I thought this was just very interesting, kind of. There's like a bit of a cubism feel to it.
00:40:43.310 - 00:40:59.174, Speaker A: We need to look up the difference between analytical and synthetic cubism. Maybe next show I will write down, maybe we can look that up right now. But there is a. I think synthetic has collage. Let's look it up in chat. GPT if we. Or just in Google here might be better.
00:40:59.174 - 00:41:24.604, Speaker A: And so interesting image here. I mean, you can tell there's a lot of work going into this image, probably a lot of inpainting, as they call it. I'm imagining hear the finger coming out of the face. So working with all of the happy accidents that come with AI. And again, very painterly. There's a ton going on here. Quite complex work from Lily.
00:41:24.604 - 00:42:12.602, Speaker A: Analytical versus synthetic cubism. Shall we? Very analytical cubism was about breaking down an object like a bottle, viewpoint by viewpoint into fragmentary image, where synthetic cubism was about flattening out the image and sweeping away the last traces of illusion of three dimensional space. Picasso's papier collais, or collaged paper are a good example of synthetic cubism. How interesting. So the difference between analytical cubism is analytical cubism is about breaking down an object, whereas synthetic cubism is about flattening the image. Very interesting. So two very different approaches, but related.
00:42:12.602 - 00:42:51.964, Speaker A: They're both considered cubism and here some very nice colors here, and kind of has almost an oblique reference to pixels here and almost these twins or sisters. Let's see what it says here. Modernist heart from Lily Illo, edition of 25. She yearned to live in the Farnsworth house to see her children play on the new spring grass. So it looks like a portrait of one person here, but a double portrait, you might say. Again, kind of evoking that analytical cubism or, you know, seeing, I mean, because they say breaking down an object, but one of the ways of breaking down an object is to see it from different perspectives. That's where I almost kind of have a bit of a cubist feel here.
00:42:51.964 - 00:43:12.764, Speaker A: Almost look like there's. It almost looks like there's distance in time between. Maybe this person is slightly older. Right. So very interesting. Modernist heart kind of has that modernist feel, too. Almost referencing Mondrian in the colors a little bit, continuing on, as well as the squares.
00:43:12.764 - 00:43:31.970, Speaker A: Golden venta times AI. So another cool work by venta here. AI artwork. And again, a lot of skulls and these figures, these kind of three dimensional figures here. And so venta times AI. So imagine AI with a lot of editing. Golden Day edition of twelve for six tezos, ten left.
00:43:31.970 - 00:43:48.254, Speaker A: Interesting yellows here. Interesting top area here, too. It's gonna be interesting to see if we can tell if inpainting, how much it's changing things. Oil slicked ski boot in the early morning light. So this is by Sky Goodman. Another AI artwork. Almost looks like an ad.
00:43:48.254 - 00:44:12.110, Speaker A: And you see that horizontal. It's like a billboard. And here you see, like, for ski boots. And here the leg is missing, interestingly, disappears into the shadow of the snow. And then, so just playing with the ski boot, going from the high heels to the sneakers. And now we have ski boot with a really cool helmet there. Interesting one of one.
00:44:12.110 - 00:44:28.798, Speaker A: Let's just see. And sent to a collector. Here's a really cool work I saw on Instagram. I think this is physical. Yeah. This is painting Donny O'Donnell. Ten birds, five horses, and six cows, taken from my exhibition called 72 Birds, 15 cows, twelve horses, and a fish.
00:44:28.798 - 00:44:48.674, Speaker A: You can see this painting and others in real life at village gallery in Manchester. Let's open that up, and let's actually very quickly look here. So, you see, I thought it was just an original style, something I'd never seen before. 61,000 followers. So, you know, look at this. Hilarious. It almost looks like knitting, uh, those knitting works.
00:44:48.674 - 00:45:03.058, Speaker A: And also a little bit reminiscent of our pizza box guy. Nugget brain, guy or gal, I'm not sure. That almost looks like doge there. So interesting. Look at that. There's merch. And you got to love that.
00:45:03.058 - 00:45:21.154, Speaker A: For merch, what do drugs dream of? So, you know, it has their style. And, uh, yeah, it could probably hang really well with nugget brain. There's an interesting print, kind of a lo fi version here. It's kind of sculptural. Very, very, very interesting. I imagine 3d print. Shall we check? And then.
00:45:21.154 - 00:45:41.666, Speaker A: Yeah, it's hard to tell, but you almost imagine this is 3d printed. Look at that. You know, it's another thing. Just put it on the to do list. Using 3d printers to make sculpture. And this is the gallery that this is at. So interesting gallery here.
00:45:41.666 - 00:46:21.930, Speaker A: So look at these great, colorful works. So this is in Manchester that you can see that show and a couple of works by die with the most likes. So someone, I think, getting some physicals and a collector glaboo is buying some physicals here. So open sea and blur on fire. So kind of hilarious as the perhaps the artist or someone looks on here. And then here's Mondrian again, but with beef and so really cool work by die with the most likes. And here's kaval del who we haven't looked at for a while, hide and seek, who makes some really cool kind of horse themed physicals.
00:46:21.930 - 00:46:45.334, Speaker A: A great artist here. Beautiful Watercolors edition of five already 95 tazos on secondary, selling for $0.80 on primary. So this is going back to January. And there's Ilay again and walk. So yeah, so this might have just appeared in my feed or was repriced in my notifications. Tater tots with a cool work as well.
00:46:45.334 - 00:47:11.614, Speaker A: Peachy taught everything is peachy. So what looks like another physical work and almost looks like a James and the giant peach type figure here from Roald Dahl, if I had to guess, and I haven't thought about that book for a very long time. Kind of looks like oil pastel here. Not sure, but definitely looks physical. Available for a Tezos edition of 50 46 left. And that is your show, my friends. Thank you for joining me and until next time, take care.
