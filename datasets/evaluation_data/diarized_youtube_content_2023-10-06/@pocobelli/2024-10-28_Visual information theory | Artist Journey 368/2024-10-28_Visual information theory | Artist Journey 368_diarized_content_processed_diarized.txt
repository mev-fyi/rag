00:00:07.240 - 00:00:24.245, Speaker A: Right up to the microphone we go. As we continue another week here. This episode must be shorter. That got out of control there. But sometimes it's good to hit a wall, as we did on Twitter. Welcome back. Artist Journal, October 28, 2024.
00:00:24.245 - 00:01:01.867, Speaker A: Broadcasting from the pirate ship of the Mind deep in Berlin, Germany in Friedrichshein for those that know their Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokabelli. Welcome back. A nice early start here. I put a self imposed limit, as I told myself as I was getting ready for this show of 10 comment tabs and 25 artworks. It didn't work out that way, but I think the ideal kept things where it's not going to be out of control here. And I am kind of putting a hard deadline in my mind of an hour here.
00:01:01.867 - 00:01:27.925, Speaker A: So let's see how we do again. I hope you had a wonderful weekend. And here it is. Did you see this Canxapata? Let me make sure I'm pronouncing Kanek Zapata's name right? Kanik Zapata. Kanexapita. So image rendered on an automatic cellular. Image rendered with cellular automata is the translation here.
00:01:27.925 - 00:02:07.615, Speaker A: I think means using a cell phone, which wouldn't shock me. What I know about Canaxapita, I need to get Canaxapita on the space, actually on a space, if that's possible. Just thinking out loud here. But what's interesting about Kanexapita, from my understanding, a glitch artist for since like the mid-2000 teens, maybe 2015, maybe longer. And you see it in the whole again, sometimes AI gets lumped into glitch AI art. Interestingly, I think we were hearing a couple of people were mentioning that. I think Sabato was also mentioning that.
00:02:07.615 - 00:02:45.763, Speaker A: I think I was commenting on that last show. And so Kanexapita, of course, if we bring up the object here before we go back to that work, you'll see we've been looking, if you get to the hour and 40 minute mark, you'll see some, you'll recognize some of these works. We've been looking at very, very, very interesting AI art, I guess you would call it. But it's like is it AI or is it glitch? Right. Remember the one, this one, this odd pixelation here. You don't see diagonal pixelation that often or particularly in an arc like this very often. And remember the word poems.
00:02:45.763 - 00:03:08.305, Speaker A: Writing poetry with computer. So we've been kind of looking. It's getting pretty darn interesting. It always has been. I've been looking at Canik Zapata's work since the beginning really of this show. So super prolific. Is it all one of ones interesting kind of way of distributing their work? Just one of ones.
00:03:08.305 - 00:03:31.825, Speaker A: From what I can tell. There's 864. I don't want to crash my computer here by loading them all up. But just to give you. Actually, you know what, let's very quickly look at the oldest because in a sense you'll see, I want to say you're going to see like even the color scheme, even back here there's this kind of all encompassing kind of rainbow. Right. Color scheme.
00:03:31.825 - 00:04:09.895, Speaker A: So I'm going to reach out in the next week or two to Canxapita. It would be fabulous to have a space with them and just learn more about what they're doing. They've been around and just a very interesting artist here. And so let's go back to what was posted on X because I'm finding this kind of stuff just unbelievably interesting, which is I'm. It's kind of back to this textured digital art, this painterliness. Right. And what do I mean? Right? Let me zoom in a little bit here for you.
00:04:09.895 - 00:04:56.931, Speaker A: So this is what I'm talking about. And I don't know, like is. Here's a huge question that I ask myself as we kind of investigate what is the modern artist today in 2024? What are the techniques that the artist of 2024 might utilize if we're almost to put together a kind of type, shall we say, for the sake of illustration and argument? And of course there's a million ways to do it. But we have AI, a revolutionary new image composition machine, right? We have AI. We see it with rj. Hey, I'm making paintings, right, Left, right and center. We've seen it with anybody that's ever done AI.
00:04:56.931 - 00:06:13.447, Speaker A: We're going to see gorgeous works by eili. Oh, here's six works I just made that are fabulous of these still lifes. And so what I wonder to myself here as we look at this and I don't know, but only because of the history of Canxapana, do I think, oh, I wonder if this is actually sourced from AI first, it may not be, but what it looks like to me is some kind of, let's call it anime image that has somehow been basically processed through a cell phone. I'm imagining an old cell phone is what I'm thinking here as we look at these kind of odd mix of triangles and pixels, right? And we've seen this kind of patterning before, right? And as you see here, so kind of. And we're almost kind of to a certain degree, to the URI J. The outlines of our lives, right? Make a whole bunch of outlines, fill with patterning of certain kind or of technique of a certain kind. We've seen it with human kernel, right? And so the first thing I wonder, or one of the big questions, and I don't want to forget this, so I'll bring it up now as we try.
00:06:13.447 - 00:07:07.627, Speaker A: And almost as I'm kind of like imagining what it is to be an artist In 2024, one of the types that you could have is, are you bringing in AI as a compositional tool? And then you start processing things, right? And then you kind of. So you don't stop at the AI necessarily. You can. But another way is, well, maybe I want to comment more on the medium of digital. And if I want to comment more on the medium of digital, well, perhaps I'll run it through a cell phone, as seems to be happening here, right? So I don't know if this starts with AI. If I just saw this from an artist I'd never seen before, I wouldn't think AI. But because it's Canik Zapata, who uses a ton of AI for years, you do start to wonder, like, is this an AI sourced image? Perhaps not, but.
00:07:07.627 - 00:08:15.075, Speaker A: So that's kind of one side of it is like, is one of these types, we could say, of a 2024 artist, someone that sources AI art and then starts to do stuff with it? We see it with Scomra, right? Not uncommon. And then with all these kind of different results and with spectacular results, and we're kind of back to what I semi loosely call painterliness, right? Like this kind of stuff where even the pixels themselves are not square. Something, you know, I delight in that. You know, because what does it do? It starts. You can tell it is sourced from the digital, but that something is happening in the process. That the squares, whether it's through, you know, the processing, whether it's through enlarging too much, whatever the case may be, you see the pixelation, the geometry start to break down, right? And then you get this, whatever this is, and let's. This is an eye, like what a spectacular eye.
00:08:15.075 - 00:08:50.181, Speaker A: And I'm kind of back to the painterliness, right? Because what I see here is the same delight I get from a Basquiat, for example, Maybe even funner for me at this point, because it's new and it's fresh, right? It's something I Haven't seen a million times before. It's something for 20, 24. It's something I already am playing with pixels. And look at what this person's doing with pixels. Perhaps because I haven't seen anything quite like this before. Of course, we've seen many variations on this theme. Even some of my work is.
00:08:50.181 - 00:09:14.541, Speaker A: We'll see. You know, we'll see rj. We'll see Skomra. We'll see a ton of people, right, Playing with this, what we'd loosely call textures. Hysterical waffle, right? But nevertheless, there's a lot to be said for this. And as we make this, I would argue, revolutionary jump from fish, physical to digital. And it is revolutionary.
00:09:14.541 - 00:09:52.535, Speaker A: And I keep going back to that story that I saw on YouTube, the video where it's 20 the history of art in 25 minutes or something like this. And I highly, highly. I've mentioned this before. I highly recommend you watch this because then you think of what we're doing here, and you're going to the end of the video, and they're still in, like, abstract expressionism or they stop around, you know, pop art or something, right? Or maybe, you know, postmodern. You know what they're calling it, by the way? I think we're going to see this. They're calling it ultra contemporary. We had this whole conversation on his contemporary art that I guess it is because now they're calling it ultra contemporary.
00:09:52.535 - 00:11:03.187, Speaker A: I just found that out. But all to say, when you watch that video, you realize how radical it is what we're doing here, I would argue, and just how radical the shift is from physical to digital. However, when we see what we're looking at right now on the screen, I would argue we are seeing the same kind of aesthetic appreciation, the same kind of aesthetic impulse in the same kind of artistic impulse that we would find in a Warhol screen print, Richard prints such and such that we'd find in your contemporary art museum that still has painting in it, you know, or we might even say painting from the last hundred years, appreciating the like. What is this? I would argue this is basically what we're looking at here. These little pixelations to big pixels. And then we're looking at the equivalent of brush strokes and appreciating those brush strokes. So as we have this kind of radical break, I think it's interesting to get these kind of bridging.
00:11:03.187 - 00:12:03.409, Speaker A: We're seeing analogies here between the paintbrush and rendered pixels or processed pixels, shall we say? I think there's, like, to Me, I see brushwork here, or the same delight I'm taking in this. Is this, in this eyebrow, this gorgeous eye, this, you know, random, this textured face, shall we say? And is textured even the right word? It sure looks textured, doesn't it? This is not texture. Technically speaking, I would argue it's massive digital texture here. But technically speaking, this is flat. Right? So what do we mean by texture? You know, so not to go too long here and look at this. Like, I mean, and it's interesting how close you get. Like, I mean, look at the eye here and the color novel representation of an eye, I would argue.
00:12:03.409 - 00:13:15.223, Speaker A: And aesthetically persuasive, this is quite, you know, so it's quite interesting. What we're, I would argue we're seeing here is because I think that same kind of aesthetic appreciation that we get from, From Brushwork in 20th Century Painting, rendered anew with a new medium kind of bridging over. And just to go like one step further, why do we care about brushwork? Like, what appeals to us in the brushwork? And I would argue, what do you have in a brush? In a brush that goes across the canvas, what do you have, you have an element of randomness contained in an organized impulse, shall we call it? Or a stroke. And I would argue that is what this shares, which is, hey, I'm going to make an eyebrow, but there's all within this eyebrow. Or I'm going to make an eye, I'm going to make a face, but within that face is all sorts of randomness, right? That is basically what they share on a, you know, philosophical level. So I think that's why they. We kind of see them.
00:13:15.223 - 00:13:50.255, Speaker A: I would argue we almost read them from. In a similar aesthetic way is what I would argue is going on here in this stunning work. Not even minted, just put on X, like just, hey, look at what I did on my. I think that says image render Z with automatis cellular, with automated cellular, whatever that means. Right? And we have another. And to can exapita's credit saying, hey, check out the eye. You know, seeing what we're seeing here, going like, whoa, that's pretty cool.
00:13:50.255 - 00:15:05.679, Speaker A: And final point on this mirror kit, I mean, right, we have a huge contrast going on here because this seems to look like some sort of manga, you know, the comics or the anime, the movies, Japanese anime or Japanese comic. Kind of has a bit of a manga look to it, doesn't it? And who does that remind you of, right, Murray? Another person using these kind of, you know, Digital textures, but using these kind of this hard contrast between traditional illustration that is now being processed, you know, in a digital way with massive textures, effects on effects. In Meerkit's case, one imagines. So it's all just another interesting. And you know, stuff like this, this is the equivalent of like the paint. Paint drips, right? And here, I mean, and look, the pixels here on the mouth, just finally the pixels on the mouth, like these aren't like perfect pixels here. As you see, there's a space, this randomness, but it's still controlled right here.
00:15:05.679 - 00:16:04.617, Speaker A: Randomness, randomness. So it's brushwork, I would argue, from. Let's call it even. Just like, how abstract can we get on this from an information theory point of view? I mean, we're kind of talking, are we coining a new term here with three copies in the system? Visual information theory? I mean, is this what we're starting to stumble upon here? Because from an information point of view, visual information, we are starting to see similar characteristics between a digital process like this and a brush, interestingly. Although one key difference, one's two dimensional, one's three dimensional, but it's almost like. Final point before we run. It's almost like you can still appreciate the texture of a physical artwork when you see it in a book on a two dimensional surface.
00:16:04.617 - 00:16:26.097, Speaker A: When I see a Warhol with. There's still like, you know, I don't see the texture, but I kind of still read the texture. You know, if I see, you know, again, something with a lot of beautiful brushwork. Right. Even a Picasso, I don't necessarily like. It's a different experience to see it in real life. And often it's a superior one.
00:16:26.097 - 00:16:59.555, Speaker A: Nevertheless though, I can still appreciate that brushwork from a two dimensional perspective. And we're kind of back to this visual. How am I processing this visual information? So beautiful way to start here again. And then you go back to this work. Fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. Here's the other image that Canax Zapata was showing the close up and these interesting triangles, you know, and using a cell phone, you know, from just a purely conceptual level.
00:16:59.555 - 00:17:13.311, Speaker A: Is that Mao? From just a purely conceptual level, a cell phone. And so we looked at Can Exapita. Good. So using a cell phone. Interesting. Okay. This ubiquitous device.
00:17:13.311 - 00:17:38.059, Speaker A: Super interesting. Speaking of super interesting. NUV 1914, Wednesday we have Tornado Rodriguez is going to be translating for NUV 1914. Of course I follow Tornado. Come join Runetoon, spectacular artist here. I cannot wait to hear what NUV 1914 has to say. That Is this Wednesday? You'll find it in my feed.
00:17:38.059 - 00:18:05.847, Speaker A: So super exciting there. I wanted to post this for the record because sometimes, you know, I'm glad I do this with the birthday works because sometimes you go, how am I ever going to find those birthday works? Some of them are just put on Twitter that were done last year. You know, there's 30 works done. It seemed like whatever the number is. So here I just want to make sure this is on the record and it is fun. There is the myth and I believe that's myth's girlfriend. Not sure.
00:18:05.847 - 00:18:21.845, Speaker A: I assume this is after we met. After like 30 seconds, I show up at this cafe in Buenos Aires. Santiago takes the picture. He's like, oh, let's get a picture. And boom. So totally awesome moment there. I look forward to going back.
00:18:21.845 - 00:18:48.753, Speaker A: Big thank you to D, the letter D. Thank you D the letter D for picking up Ray Dalio. So having fun here. Quite a small work in the sense of only 500 by 579. This might have concerned me in, you know, five years ago. Now I delight in it. And just a very fun work here, playing with the processing and everything.
00:18:48.753 - 00:19:14.729, Speaker A: A lot of kind of, you know, how far can you push it? Enjoying the jpegization, interestingly. And again, you know, these non square pixels, right. Again, playing with these pixels that have been kind of distorted but then keeping real ones in there for contrast. Anyways, having a ton of fun. Big thank you to D, the letter D for collecting four minutes after posting. That was wonderful. Thank you everybody.
00:19:14.729 - 00:19:33.865, Speaker A: Art for space indeed. So many wonderful topics we have here. So only on YouTube and again, we're already 20 minutes but we're not doing bad here. Let's keep going. So thank you everybody for commenting. Really fun and inspiring to follow the evolution of the art happening in this space. And you're such a good guide, full of knowledge and enthusiasm.
00:19:33.865 - 00:19:49.001, Speaker A: Thanks for putting these together, Pokebelly. My absolute pleasure and thank you for commenting. R. Gordon, Human boy. Thank you as always for the future in today's episode. So grateful for the time and energy you spend with us and the art. It never feels too long to watch, but I can only imagine how long it must take you to create.
00:19:49.001 - 00:20:12.363, Speaker A: I only took an hour today and always remain so thoughtful. Hope you find that balance that works best for you. Yeah, I am dancing here. It is an improvisation. Really appreciate. Which makes it even nicer to hear the positive vibes or the positive feedback because you actually, you know, who knows how you're going to dance today? Ahek or Joshua Sobel this episode was the length of a movie. I loved it.
00:20:12.363 - 00:20:31.139, Speaker A: So great to hear. I was embarrassed at how long this episode was at an hour and 46 minutes. So thank you for the comment there. Joshua Sobel Always great to hear from you. Pippa Universal thanks for the feature. You're absolutely welcome. Omizu paints Another excellent episode, Mr.
00:20:31.139 - 00:20:53.883, Speaker A: Pokebelly. Even if it went longer than you expected. It's almost as if the more you focus on time, the longer the episode becomes. And no matter how short or long or short the episode ends up being, I'll continue to watch Artist Journal. Thank you for sharing this with us. Thank you for the comment because sometimes I do get concerned. Like I think from as I always say here, from a commercial point of view, I think this show should be 20 to 30 minutes.
00:20:53.883 - 00:21:29.937, Speaker A: Right? So it does kind of make you wonder. But I so I really appreciate that because it is kind of about just getting it right to a certain degree as much as I do try and shorten it. K Town Crypto King Great to hear from you. Stellar episode 5140 object needs to add a comment section right? So talking about probably Object as a social platform needs to add a comment section to each art piece. I'm sure they've thought of that. An ad view like counter and a tab for art owned right? So yeah. So interesting thoughts here from K Town on developing the social side of things on Object.
00:21:29.937 - 00:21:38.793, Speaker A: Darbul's nft. You rock. Thank you. Great to hear from you. Cider. I used to come back to check the art but now I'm also coming to check the discussions you bring. Amazing episode as always.
00:21:38.793 - 00:21:59.913, Speaker A: Thank you for bringing my work as well. Just delightful to hear from you Cider. Incredible artist here. Juren Land I'm totally fascinated by your Journal. This was a really nice comment. I watching it now for about two weeks. I have to say your dedication and your seriousness to art and aesthetics is a pure pleasure to me as someone coming from an art school.
00:21:59.913 - 00:22:22.491, Speaker A: This is music to my ears. I feel like making digital art provides so much freedom of expression and meaning and your journal is really the proof of it. I was always interested in digital media and images in general until now. My artistic approach is more focused on creating drawings, paintings, collages and so on. But it will change now. Thanks a lot. I am totally in.
00:22:22.491 - 00:23:06.291, Speaker A: So just you know, I wouldn't say like put it this way. Like you say, you know, I don't really get at all paid for this, but I do sell my art so this helps sell my Art, you know, it's basically the main monetization here. But this is kind of like, I don't want to be facetious and say this is why I make this show, but it's almost like that was the first thing that went through my head. When you get a comment like this, you just go like, who cares if I'm making money or not? If it's having that effect on people. I am just so glad to hear that. So thank you for the comment and by all means post your work in the community when you start making digital work or if you already have some, or whatever you're doing to get on the radar here. Because wouldn't it be wonderful to have you on the show? Dylan, great to hear from you.
00:23:06.291 - 00:23:26.361, Speaker A: Thank you, Pokebelly. Great to hear from you, Dylan. I think we have another work by Dylan, this show and PP Universal. There is something universal indeed from PP Universal. Talking about universal subject matter. That was a very interesting discussion. I almost titled the show Universal Subject Matter, but I kind of didn't want to lose the Art for Space thread, so to speak.
00:23:26.361 - 00:23:50.845, Speaker A: So it's almost a way of reminding myself. Anyways, and a cool title too. So here. Yeah, the duration of the video you tried to upload was too long for after half an hour of this thing uploading on the Berlin Internet, then it told me, sorry, you're out of luck. That was at like 5:30pm like my whole day gone with this show. So I have all the incentives in the world. Today's going fabulous in terms of time.
00:23:50.845 - 00:23:57.885, Speaker A: Let's keep it that way. Darbels just subscribed on YouTube. Awesome. Salowaki. Love this episode, Adrian. Thanks for including my work. Absolutely.
00:23:57.885 - 00:24:09.703, Speaker A: Salowaki. Those GLBs of these kind of scenarios I just adore. I think they're really. And the color. The color. Andre. Just got the notification.
00:24:09.703 - 00:24:16.935, Speaker A: On my way home now. I'll enjoy your show later. Awesome. Always great to hear from you, Andre. Blue Alley. Oh no. Been waiting all afternoon.
00:24:16.935 - 00:24:26.191, Speaker A: The time for the smelling salts. Actually. It's probably way more stressful for you than anything else. Be happy to catch up with you on YouTube. All the best. Thanks for your work and dedication. We appreciate you.
00:24:26.191 - 00:24:38.771, Speaker A: I totally appreciate that. And there's Blue. Excited for the show and that excites me. So thank you. It wasn't a big deal at this point. I am just happy it uploaded somewhere. Right.
00:24:38.771 - 00:24:49.811, Speaker A: Rural Idol. The perfect finale to triple vinyl magnum opus season. Good luck paring things down. Hilarious. Great to hear from you. Evelyn Yeo. Great show, Adrian.
00:24:49.811 - 00:25:16.453, Speaker A: But I think you're being a bit unfair to galleries. And I actually. I think you might be right, Evelyn, on that front. If the relationship between artist and gallery is healthy, they support the artist in many ways, except for the obvious, like, business partner in selling your work, they're usually better to write about an artist's work and put it in a historical context. Yeah. Not all artists can write that well or express themselves. So in certain cases, I think that's true.
00:25:16.453 - 00:25:45.689, Speaker A: It really does. It is a case by case. We are generalizing here. They're also better for, according to Evelyn Yeo, promoting the artist, career advice, keep record of all your work, photography. It really does depend on the gallery, doesn't it? And I don't want to rain on the parade entirely. I think there is a function for galleries and digital, but I think it's a different kind of relationship than the one where either your work is shown in the physical world or it's not. If you don't have a gallery is almost what it comes down to.
00:25:45.689 - 00:26:04.335, Speaker A: And of course, overgeneralizing here you can go to little fairs where. But generally speaking, if you want to show it in what I'd loosely call, and again loosely call a credible way, you kind of need a gallery. And in a sense. So they have a different function now. I think it's more of a, like, brand association. Like, oh, this. Let's say it's.
00:26:04.335 - 00:26:19.395, Speaker A: It's not gallery. You know, a gallery that we've looked at a billion times on the show. Like, you know, it's like. I think if you're a younger artist that's doing airbrush paintings, you want your work shown by. It's not a gallery. It's not gallery. Right.
00:26:19.395 - 00:26:46.015, Speaker A: Like you just do, I would argue. Right. And so I think that's the kind of relationship, say in the digital world that it goes, okay, they have such a great following, they have such a great aesthetic. They are pioneers, I would argue. So therefore, you know, that's kind of what the digital can offer rather than all of this kind of. But that's not. But that's none of these things, which I'd argue is more kind of a traditional, physical gallery anyways.
00:26:46.015 - 00:26:58.181, Speaker A: Let's continue. They do all the things an artist don't want to do. Because the artists want to make work, not be on X all day. Yes. In some cases, they also give the artist a platform to try new work. Often the gallery is the first place to show the artist's new body of work. Yeah.
00:26:58.181 - 00:27:28.075, Speaker A: So this really depends because it can Be the opposite too, as we were mentioning, maybe the gallery doesn't like it as you said, but if they like the artist, they might understand the artist's need to do these artworks to get to a new level of their practice. Yeah. So it's a mixed bag. I think that's totally fair. This set, I don't see them as super important in this space, but they are one of the few that can onboard people from the street. And I believe they can do that better than a screen on Times Square or in Shibuya. And definitely I totally agree there as I can talk to the person walking into the gallery.
00:27:28.075 - 00:27:58.797, Speaker A: I guess artists here is more in need of personal promoters or agents, someone you can discuss with your works who understand your art, promotes your work. Get. Yeah, this I'm. Yeah, I think there's a place for it maybe, but I just don't put it this way. Like, let me be very kind of simple here, which is, I think the nature of the relationship between the artist and the collector is simplified in digital. I just don't think you need as many people. I don't think you need as much interference.
00:27:58.797 - 00:28:39.895, Speaker A: You may not need any, but ultimately I just think there's less requirements, so to speak. There's less physical requirements, there's less cost requirements, there's less, you know, you don't need to distribution requirements in digital. A lot of this stuff is kind of streamlined and it's almost like the. To a certain degree, and this is a far analogy, it's almost the difference between physical books and Kindle. Right. Like you can still make the argument for physical books and it's a distant analogy, but ultimately, you know, isn't it great that I just think of a book and I can just download it and same with digital art. Like, I don't need to go anywhere Anyways, I'm getting far off topic here.
00:28:39.895 - 00:28:58.111, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment, Evelyn. Good point. Absurd Deity. The impossible dream of keeping it short. Indeed. And a really nice comment here from absurd Deity. Gotta say, Twitter X may not be able to handle the length of your artist journal, but speaking for myself, at least your audience surely can.
00:28:58.111 - 00:29:27.049, Speaker A: There's no other show on any platform that I'm willing to devote more than an hour to each week, let alone three. Yet I can't wait to open YouTube whenever I see the notification that you've dropped another episode. So I'm thrilled to get this reaction because I was genuinely embarrassed at how long the last episode was. Thank you so much for featuring my collab with Corey Cheek. I Think is how you pronounce it, which was a wonderful added surprise. You're correct in surmising. I generated the base image using AI and also Corey Achieve.
00:29:27.049 - 00:30:13.843, Speaker A: Corey Achieve then convert it to video and added the glitch effects. Okay, excellent. As you have often stated, there's something about the AI aesthetic that seems to mesh well with glitch. And yeah, I think it might have been Sabato who was mentioning that these early because it was kind of like the disrespected, you know, AI AI in 2015 where he had like the GAN or whatever Google dream, remember that? It wasn't like the best looking, it was kind of like this nightmarish looking work. And so the glitch artists tended to incorporate it I think early on because it was seen as this kind of like. It's like visually it was already looked like a glitch out of the box, so to speak. Perhaps my sense is that it is based on the natural ability of our brains to immediately sense and take note of the wrongness of an image.
00:30:13.843 - 00:30:49.391, Speaker A: We're almost back to the visual information theory here. Both AI images, videos and glitch effects take advantage of this immediate subconscious recognition. So this is interesting and this wrongness, this off kilteredness, but that's still beautiful, you know, is almost where the poetry resides. I suppose we could say however, where's wrongness in life is often met with a sense of distaste in great glitch art like these, some great ROMs, or you name it. Not saying any of my art would be in that category. The immediate recognition of WA is somehow converted into oh or even a wow. I'm personally fascinated by this aesthetic alchemy.
00:30:49.391 - 00:31:21.407, Speaker A: And although I can't tell you why some glitch effects are off putting whereas others are mesmerizingly gorgeous, I'd argue it's kind of back to just, you know, simple beauty. Some are beautiful and some are just like, well that's not so great. I sure am enjoying all the. And there's no reason behind it, it's just something. I mean you can make reasons, all the reasons in the world as to why. Okay, there's contrast actually. There usually is technical reasons why things tend to work and not, but sometimes it just works, right? I sure am enjoying all the incredible.
00:31:21.407 - 00:31:41.959, Speaker A: Despite all of this, I sure am enjoying all the incredible AI more or less glitch art that this community is creating on a regular basis. Indeed. And there's the work by observed deity and coriac. So awesome to hear from You. Great comment. Interesting. Yan Lucas Magone broke the Internet.
00:31:41.959 - 00:32:03.303, Speaker A: Filippo Francocci Congrats on my way to YouTube Kira so I just. I love you guys. You're the best. Rinny Fish awesome to hear from you. We have a work this episode by Rinny Fish our milk. Well the next episodes alt not be available on Twitter they will be because they will be short enough in theory. 8So I'm surprised it took this long to break that.
00:32:03.303 - 00:32:26.445, Speaker A: Indeed. Elon Musk. I was kind of hoping I had this. Kind of. When I saw Elon Musk tag there because of the duration of the video, I was like, oh, art for space. There's probably no better episode to get Elon Musk's attention here than Art for Space. So I thought that was great that 369 tagged Elon there w 70 wojack great to hear from you little cakes.
00:32:26.445 - 00:32:50.745, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. So hilarious. Quick look at the community. So Ilya Bliznets Wow, look at this thing. Breakfast before school. Collaboration between thinking it kind of looks like don't buy here as you see a little bit of audio. So gotta be careful here with the mic and the last thing we want.
00:32:50.745 - 00:33:14.761, Speaker A: So just some interesting audio there. And so as you see here, so interesting collab here by Ilya Bliznets and Don't buy. Don't buy. Just had a big show that they put out earlier this month. Libro Block. Really cool glitch piece here. Kind of what I really think is interesting here.
00:33:14.761 - 00:33:33.707, Speaker A: Among other things is the vertical and the horizontal here. So cool abstract here. Load reboot from Libro Block. Sindulf Interesting combination of what looks like writing and painting. New collage art. Very interesting digital collage. Very interesting area.
00:33:33.707 - 00:33:44.519, Speaker A: Kind of almost underexplored area. Here's Zizo. A couple of aliens having a coffee. Nice work Zizo. Nice painting. And also Gavin Shapiro. Make way for Pesto.
00:33:44.519 - 00:34:08.955, Speaker A: The Chunkiest boy is now an object in an edition of 10. Feel free to offer whatever you want and I will accept 10 offers. So here is a work from Gavin Shapiro. Cool penguin looking penguin. Louis JPD New artistic creation in Blender. This one is a series of 96 escalating PNGs of 2D string forms to create an abstract visual representation of legendary Queen guitarist Sir Brian May. Well, a knight.
00:34:08.955 - 00:34:27.611, Speaker A: Interestingly so interesting. So using a few different texts here. Exporting looks like a little bit of blender. Interesting. You know, it's interesting to use, you know, these 3D things to get back to 2D. These 3D softwares 369 grown still naive beautiful. Nice animated abstract here.
00:34:27.611 - 00:34:47.622, Speaker A: Golov what we're here for. Unfortunately this is not showing up here in the feed. Unfortunately Golo but feel free to put an image next time. Kendall Van Sant A nice little drawing here of a bird in a cemetery with a birdcage. Cool work Kendall. Thanks for posting and skull takes. We saw this I believe.
00:34:47.622 - 00:35:14.919, Speaker A: Oh no we didn't see this. Beautiful work here. Image derived from linocut on wood that was hand painted, scanned and then sonified and data bent in audacity. Interesting texture isn't there? So using the physical world scanning so interest. It's really like I always say here we're just scratching the surface. Luke500 I don't know why but this piece makes me think of the recent H.P. lovebucks interview on Post Americana.
00:35:14.919 - 00:35:43.569, Speaker A: A 1964 ed Russia going up to auction with an estimate of $50 million. Wasn't the market dead? Great article by Kelly Crow at the Wall Street Journal. $50 million. That seems super overpriced, doesn't it? I wonder if it's going to sell. I guess that's the estimate. We'll see what it goes for but that is really expensive. Luke500amust watch for all artists minting on Tezos yes, this is great.
00:35:43.569 - 00:36:22.885, Speaker A: A 40 minute step by step video by Retro Manny on how to mint 100% on chain and I thought we had a link too. Wasn't there just a link? Wasn't it Sigma Toad had put out where it's just like it was like a form and it was just like hey do you want us to put this on object? I totally hope they do so but there's a video here and so that can be found in the community as well. I've never done it and the cost is at first I thought it was really cheap. The cost came up here to mint on chain and where is it? Here it is. Approximate cost 0.3 tezos per kilobyte. So that would be let's call it 20 cents.
00:36:22.885 - 00:37:01.483, Speaker A: But right now I thought it was super cheap at first but Luke was sort of said eh, not so cheap because you know to mint on bitcoin right now it's still it's 2V bytes, it's 50 cents. I put up a bunch of work on bitcoin actually this weekend it's 50 cents per kilobyte. So right now the kind of the value as you could say on bitcoin. But anyways so that is so it's not super cheap. It's about a third of a tezos per kilobyte. Interestingly. But if you're doing like works like this Microcosmos series by Cal Flemmer, the Jars by Tornado, these little pixel artworks, you're not paying very much.
00:37:01.483 - 00:37:14.275, Speaker A: You know, you're paying like less than a dollar. So. And the market loves it. Yot GM everyone. So thank you for the illustration and painting. Texadelic. Thank you for posting here.
00:37:14.275 - 00:37:34.807, Speaker A: Kind of interesting digital and painting. And here is Aria. Thank you for posting. Cool digital artwork Chamaland out of Buenos Aires. Good to see you Chamaland. There's the mate that they love to drink there. And a cool there and there that looks like Chama sitting off and looking into the digital sky there.
00:37:34.807 - 00:38:01.167, Speaker A: The pixelated sky. Cool work on object. Here's Fatemeh and I believe we saw this and this is super interesting here. We're actually going to get a comment on this right away from Alain Survey from that article, I believe, or at least referring to something similar that Luke500 was mentioning. Very interesting comment here. So Alliance Survey the art market needs a restoration project. The current decline of prices is due to changing market conditions.
00:38:01.167 - 00:38:24.587, Speaker A: It is not a reflection of any given market. This is actually pretty hilarious. The headline the Contemporary Art Market poses one of the great chicken and egg questions in all of economics. The current decline of prices is due to changing market conditions. It's not the art. So it's just that art isn't as valuable as it used to be. Yeah, the current decline of prices is due to.
00:38:24.587 - 00:38:43.865, Speaker A: So this is Bloomberg. It's not a reflection on any given artist. I think that's hilarious that the need was even to put that in. That is an opinion. Allison Schreiger, Columnist Art isn't as valuable as it used to be. Total sales of work by younger artists, also known as ultra contemporary art. This is artnet that's pushing.
00:38:43.865 - 00:39:13.585, Speaker A: This term, I think has been declining recently. So I guess the next 20 years of our lives we're going to be forced to deal with ultra contemporary art to keep the show on. To quote Burroughs, to keep this dying show on the road is what goes through my head. Lots of art is going to auction. The number of ultra contemporary works offered and sold at auctions in New York, Hong Kong, London and Paris has been rising. So more art on the market. And again, I would say the elephant in the room.
00:39:13.585 - 00:39:40.375, Speaker A: To generalize, you know, we've always mentioned, you know, there's a lot of genius out there, but the elephant in the room is the content and the works themselves. And they did get probably overpriced as we see from the Ed Russia. I mean that that's $50 million for that Ed Russia. And I like Ed Russia has a cool kind of Ballard work. But yeah, I think Ballard knew Ed Russia actually. Or at least they met. Anyways, let's continue.
00:39:40.375 - 00:40:08.893, Speaker A: You know what inspired one of the main inspirations for JG Ballard was the this is Tomorrow exhibition, which was the first pop art exhibition in I think ever. I think it's credited with Bean and it was in London, it was a major exhibition. I think it was at the Tate. I could be wrong about that. Maybe it was somewhere else, I can't remember. But he went to that and I'm not sure what year that was. But yeah, for him that was a major turning point.
00:40:08.893 - 00:40:51.325, Speaker A: Continuing on. Painting is dead. Long lived painting. I didn't want to focus on this too much, but there's a new article in the New York Times show at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago challenges the time worn critics contention that painting is dead, expanding the idea of what painting can be. And then they have a Petri Court, right, who was part of the kind of post Internet crowd for those that don't know, maybe 10, 15 years ago, featuring both paintings. So this is at the MOCA Chicago, featuring both paintings made the traditional way and works made using media and other technology, including the works of no other than Patrick Courtright, quote. The show looks at how computers, the Internet, cameras, including video and photography and automation have influenced the production and reception of painting.
00:40:51.325 - 00:41:31.947, Speaker A: Right. As I kind of long have said here, the way that painting remains new is by incorporating the technological, visual, technological evolution into painting. You know, so you bring in digital, you know, vocabulary for lack of better term, digital references, so to speak. You know, in my case I would say the perfectly square circle, you know, for example of the pencil tool, the magic wand stuff that you can't get out of painting. And then painting kind of gets reinvigorated. And I suspect that's probably what this show is referring to. There's a paywall on that one, so I never read it.
00:41:31.947 - 00:42:19.707, Speaker A: Artie Hands Listening to, listening to highbrow explanations of not so great art is so exhausting. And this is why I'm sometimes hard on contemporary art because I have wasted a huge amount of time going to talks in Berlin. And I'm not saying all of them, some of them are great, but 80% have been terrible. And you are wasting your time from a intellectual point of view. And it's like, and to Artie Hand's point, listening to highbrow explanations is usually someone's ego problem that you're dealing with, unfortunately, or someone's baggage. And, you know, so, you know, not to be too strong, but on it. But I sympathize and empathize with Artie Hans there.
00:42:19.707 - 00:42:58.155, Speaker A: Vinnie Hager. The end goal is to create a lifelong body of artwork that you're proud of. This is, I think, one of the goals. Of course, I think there may be other goals at work, though, depending on what kind of art you're doing. And I would say I'd refer people to the HP Love Bucks Twitter space that we did last week, because I make the case in there, and I don't think I'm the first person to argue this. I think if you look at Burroughs, I think if you look at Ballard, I think if you look at the Surrealists, there is also kind of a social dimension. You could even argue the Marquis de Sad.
00:42:58.155 - 00:43:22.497, Speaker A: Right? This whole tradition I keep bringing up here, there is a social dimension. I would argue it's not political. It can be reduced to left right terms. But I'd argue it's political on a kind of a metal level. It's meta politics. And it's taking the images, especially in a corporate world that are being brought to us. Reconfiguring them and kind of representing them is another kind of function.
00:43:22.497 - 00:43:57.525, Speaker A: One could argue that the arts has. It kind of plays a. You could argue an integral. It can be a critique, one could say a visual critique of the world we live in and whatever power is being kind of what people, you know. Unfortunately, the older you get, the more you realize there is kind of power is trying to implement ways of thinking on people. So I think there is a response that is possible from the people, so to speak, that is art based, that kind of reconfigures and comments and, you know, so all the same. But I thought it was an interesting comment, which is why I highlighted it here.
00:43:57.525 - 00:44:20.231, Speaker A: Shout out to Vinnie Mike Bespalov. I thought this was really interesting. So just a prominent, I think, AI account. But this is not AI, just crafted what might be the smoothest delete effect ever using pure SVG filters. So the power of svg I just wanted to highlight here. It's pretty impressive svg. Like, I think it's worth exploration and it's tiny.
00:44:20.231 - 00:44:39.507, Speaker A: Back to our art for space on chain discussion. So pretty interesting how powerful it is. I think it's mathematical. Like, I think it's vector, you know, mathematical. But you know, more on that later. Mario Klingeman I do not endorse any meme coins created in my name or which steal my art. I know there's nothing I can do against it.
00:44:39.507 - 00:45:11.861, Speaker A: And this tweet probably even has a Streisand effect. Don't come crying or complaining if you get rugged by these scammers. So I saw a couple, I think Mek also mentioned this. There are people that are creating, you know, these visual meme coins, so to speak, in you know, that are taken from artists and then just kind of posting them. So yeah, so it just kind of, you know, it's. Yeah. You know we have an interesting post here by Pixel Lord which kind of takes another side on this though.
00:45:11.861 - 00:46:04.659, Speaker A: What if instead of NFTs we can just drop new art as tokens and then whatever happens is free market. Basically a tokenized art is liquid editions of nft and there is, you know, like put it this way, there is something to be said for this in the sense of like remember this fractionalization thing? Like that was almost one of the earlier ways of. And I think you can even buy like a Picasso out there somewhere which is fractionalized and it's like, oh, and then there are, you know, 100 different owners. I'm not sure on the so called govern. I'm skeptical on governance, on chain governance. I think in general it's been shown in real terms not to work, I dare say. And so yeah, and so if you have the majority, I guess maybe that's just what it is.
00:46:04.659 - 00:46:34.131, Speaker A: It's like okay, instead of there being one token for one art piece, you could have a thousand tokens and say okay, but do you own the art? Like it does change the effect you own a represent, you know, so changes the ownership and. And then can I guess in theory anybody. It's like putting an addition. It's kind of like an addition. So it is interesting in that respect. Let's continue. Interesting comment hen collector in reference to Ahek Joshua Sobel.
00:46:34.131 - 00:47:07.819, Speaker A: It's been my ethos that the chain and associated platforms that have been the least barrier to entry and ease of use discovery will be where all the true artists and art collectors end up in the end. To me that remains Tezos. Nothing has shifted there. Tezos performance is irrelevant to that. I don't really care on token price fluctuations because I believe art is ultimately not going to be valued based on what chain it is on, but on the quality of the work and who the artist is. I suspect this is how we're not even going to know like or it's like you're going to have to look at the metadata be like, oh, it was minted on ETH 20 years ago. Right.
00:47:07.819 - 00:47:26.659, Speaker A: I kind of agree. Keep it simple. Collect on the platform that is easiest and is not connected to or run by VCs or crypto bros. Collect. Yeah. Collect art on an ecosystem founded and run by artists and art collectors. A community that aligns with your values and I believe you can't go wrong Keep my world super simple and focused on what I on what I do.
00:47:26.659 - 00:48:21.111, Speaker A: And indeed the simplicity of Tezos is an arguably objects platform. Does there is something to be said for that? Because as soon as like I haven't even gone to highlight xyz maybe I went once like when that first started happening but it sounded so complicated. I just don't like I would rather just kind of focus on oh, is there a new work by the myth? What does that mean? Let me see that and look at it compared to this. Is it a new series? Like that's what I want to think about. Not where am I on the leaderboard and oh which you know shape like is this going to be around and oh, everything is all going to change and am I just throwing my money away here or what is this? So I think but maybe there's something to be said so and so I'm not saying people need to collect art on every chain. It is of course your choice as a collector. But if you claim to be an appreciator of art and you're unwilling to highlight great work because of where it was minted.
00:48:21.111 - 00:48:45.731, Speaker A: Now have some questions about your actual interest in art. Yeah, excellent point. I agree. And here this is Neuro color Epiphenomena handmade collage. Nice physical and I think things may be out of order a little bit here. Yeah. So this was going to be later but I had to highlight this because I like to show physical works here from digital.
00:48:45.731 - 00:49:21.063, Speaker A: Right. Or at least by digital artists making physical. I got to say that frame is awesome and I'm really impressed with the paper. Like this is a nice handmade collage 2020. What I kind of like too is it fits in it kind of fits with Neuro colors vibe of the work. Very interesting subject which is mech and I think was it John a new platform for viewing your art. I still need to try this out with subject long the days of missing your favorite creator's works.
00:49:21.063 - 00:49:38.975, Speaker A: No more frantically checking a whole bunch of apps. It's not missing any drops in New releases and tazos. Simple, no fluffs. I do like the visual. First it's kind of like visual notifications, which if, you know, object could. You know, if there's anything that needs upgraded, it's the notifications on object. This is pretty nice.
00:49:38.975 - 00:50:00.065, Speaker A: So just kind of interesting. So continuing on element least scroll on the foundation of drawing. And this is. Look at this. I mean, element lead is doing a lot of radical moves here. And here it has three versions of the sink. And look at how it's being printed.
00:50:00.065 - 00:50:18.329, Speaker A: And then presented this way and saying, see on a scroll. On the scroll on the foundation of drawing. Like provocative title. Very nice work from Element Ly. And here are the works. And really interesting pixelation here. We're kind of back, like, look at to where we got this kind of.
00:50:18.329 - 00:50:42.505, Speaker A: We're kind of back to the visual information theory here. As we see with these pixels that are not perfect, we're kind of like. We took another route here through physical expression or through physical rendering. You also get a distortion in the pixels here with maybe the ink bleeding depending on the paper. Super interesting. And let me just quickly. This is not.
00:50:42.505 - 00:51:02.853, Speaker A: You know, I thought I'd do a hard hour cutoff here. That's going to be impossible, of course. So I struggle to shorten this show. But as you can see, why I hope. Victor Arce prototype for the board game I'm making. It's just a very fun user interface. Visual interface, the game board.
00:51:02.853 - 00:51:21.823, Speaker A: This kind of looks like settlers of catan. Very interesting, Victor. I had to show this Nicholas Sassoon new RGB studies. So I finally clicked the link to Nicholas Sassoon's website. Look at how awesome these look when you see them up close like this. Like, it's a completely different experience. And you actually see every little pixel here.
00:51:21.823 - 00:51:42.863, Speaker A: Pretty spectacular. So I just wanted to highlight that because we've seen so many on Twitter bite by bit installing 1990 Autodesk Animator Pro. So some of the background work that goes into installing some of these softwares, impressive. Some of these retro, you know, vintage softwares. Hermipe pixel art. Look at this. So here's a.
00:51:42.863 - 00:52:04.687, Speaker A: Some sort of Japanese motorbike with a Hermipe pixel on the side. But look, it's a screen. It's not even a rectangle, but actually it is. And then the image continue. That is like something I've never seen before. Do you see what's going on here? You have what looks like a screen and the animation is only. I don't know if you can see that.
00:52:04.687 - 00:52:35.015, Speaker A: But the animation is only in this rectangle. But then Hermipe, the innovator that they are, puts paints on top of the screen. This work here, this in white, and then goes off of the screen. This is quite something and well worth our attention and time here. Very, very wild, frankly. And it looks like there's a few, I think, or at least one. As you see here, the screen stopping.
00:52:35.015 - 00:52:59.593, Speaker A: Radical, radical pixel artist out of Japan on Decollard. Here's a robot doing some art here. I just want to show and kind of like again, novel ways of mark making. New ways of mark making. These plotter, paint, plotters, especially machine painting. Very cool. So just wanted to highlight that.
00:52:59.593 - 00:53:14.273, Speaker A: And let's continue. Here is Ezra Eslin, who, of course I follow. I need your help. 2024. Interesting physical. Kind of looks pretty good, doesn't it? So super interesting there. And here is also Turo Moda mt, who, of course I follow.
00:53:14.273 - 00:53:33.499, Speaker A: I bought a new sketchbook and making a cool little painting, I think in the sketchbook, I believe that's a painting. So look at how tiny that is too. How carefully you'd have to do all that. Super interesting. And here is Martin Bruce, who, of course I follow. So does 2 by 2 meters. This is huge.
00:53:33.499 - 00:53:50.667, Speaker A: 20, 24. So a huge artwork. And look at that cloud, as I always say with Martin Bruce. He thinks with his eyes. Just a spectacular artist. Here is Yuri J. As we get into the works here, touching grass.
00:53:50.667 - 00:54:23.327, Speaker A: So here you see some grass. So Yuri J in action. I guess it's a work in progress because then we got this one. And as you see, it looks like a similar structure, doesn't it? You see the house here, but then some dragging. And you see some of the process that goes through Uri J's work here. And then you see these gorgeous textures, right? These imperfect brushstrokes here, you know, that have this edge and everything. So here things getting kind of dragged along the side and everything.
00:54:23.327 - 00:54:41.083, Speaker A: Very nice work from Uri J. Here's an interesting piece by Hasdrubal Waffle. I don't know if this was on Rodeo. I didn't check Rodeo today in the name in the interests of time. Pretty cool work, though. Love this kind of, you know, animation in the back. And then this staticness.
00:54:41.083 - 00:55:03.545, Speaker A: There's a great contrast is going on here as well as the spray paint over top of the pixels. Kind of looks like reminds me of 2001 with all of the apes kind of collecting near the. The big black monolith. Not sure what the reference is. Here maybe it's probably something completely different. Pretty interesting here is Zuozhou. Let the trees or emerge with yours.
00:55:03.545 - 00:55:38.229, Speaker A: So more gorgeous. More gorgeousness from Zuo. There you see. I mean, I just never get tired of this. There's so much to feast on there. NUV 1914. Who will be on this week's spaces? Check this out.
00:55:38.229 - 00:56:03.172, Speaker A: A toreador, seemingly a bull and a toreador getting killed. Interestingly, La Coronada after Botero, very popular artist. Beautiful piece. I was going to say the necklace, but that is a vest. The edge of the vest. Beautifully, beautifully done here there's an edition of 11 still available. Only two picked up so far.
00:56:03.172 - 00:56:26.535, Speaker A: Here's another one from November 1914. The distance that is not lost or something like that. So another work, interesting format going back to. And again playing with these kind of lower resolutions. Last few works interestingly. But here, high resolution, edgy work as usual from nev1914. Can't wait to talk to them.
00:56:26.535 - 00:56:43.491, Speaker A: So addition of 5 for 13 tezos each. And here perot 8. So another, I think dog. And in this series here, playing with these other brushes. And you see here classic just is kind of. And they're classic. So cool work here.
00:56:43.491 - 00:57:01.931, Speaker A: Edition of 10 from NEV 1914 just listed. Here's RJ Franz. So this is a AI and pixel painting collage. GIF portrait of Franz Kafka, 1400 by 1400. So not tiny. Interestingly, I love how the GIFs expand in object. It's really great.
00:57:01.931 - 00:57:26.185, Speaker A: So interesting portrait of Franz Kafka. Really nice color here and everything. So based on an AI work. And this is sold out at 40 tezos each for an addition of five. So nice work from RJ. Here's Skomra again, using AI, that dress you used to wear. So again, it's like you could put these guys or these people in the same room.
00:57:26.185 - 00:58:03.635, Speaker A: And so another beautiful textured digital artwork based on AI from Skamra. And here is an egg mattress. Ace of spades, three of clubs. So look at this. Interesting again we're seeing here on the edges kind of like these layers on top of each other. Getting some pretty, you know, embracing these sort of like glitchery really or these kind of heavy aesthetics of, you know, these that layer styles can create. And then you get just on top big like some mathematical, you know, characters.
00:58:03.635 - 00:58:26.641, Speaker A: Very interesting piece here from. Or pieces from Etting Mattress. Here is xine interesting followers here. So again, kind of a sketchbook, kind of having a bit of a sketchbook composition, a little bit Thing here. Some stuff here. Here's some horses, right? Just posted on X. And of course I follow Uxene.
00:58:26.641 - 00:58:46.625, Speaker A: Some more super interesting, witty works from Dan Control. Composition. Pstk. Not sure lpstk. Not sure what that means. Looking pretty rad. While, you know, contemporary art is, you know, going wild over the Tom Wesselman show, I'm kind of looking at the Dan Control show here online.
00:58:46.625 - 00:59:19.705, Speaker A: Fresh and witty and fun and just interesting. Here's composition, Phone call. Great color and some old Nokia phones and just interesting use of repetition and just making a work out of thin air. Seemingly Mishiyasu compact sky. So more experimentation here as we see and look at these great colors that come into this very challenging kind of work. It's a one of one. It is 17 tazos, $10.82.
00:59:19.705 - 00:59:37.725, Speaker A: There's on tezos. Here is Sols Perd de Flores maybe. And so this is a one of one. Another kind of edgy artist here. As you accumulate for the museum in your mind. Interesting piece. How much is this? Not listed.
00:59:37.725 - 00:59:56.595, Speaker A: Here's another rad work. These could all go in the same room, couldn't they? Baller. This is Juana Pedro, a super interesting abstract artist. Very recognizable style and interesting piece here. Great colors. Just a cool abstract one. Sold so far at 10 Tezos edition of 13.
00:59:56.595 - 01:00:13.795, Speaker A: And here's Luciana Guerra. Me and the creatures. So interesting. I believe this is a digital painting. Sure looks that way from the color. It'd be the color scheme that was the biggest reason why I would think this is digital. Anyway, beautiful work here from Lucena Guerra.
01:00:13.795 - 01:00:32.959, Speaker A: Here's Lorna Mills, which is a pretty rad. Again embracing the JPEG artifacts here, I believe. Unless that's just Instagram rendering it this way. Pretty cool one. And I love the color here of this mouth talking and mast there Walk. And this is sold. And let's just see what Walk did.
01:00:32.959 - 01:01:05.127, Speaker A: Only two tazos you can get a walk for these days if you're lucky. And here I'm not sure what the subject matter is, but you see all the noise up close and personal. Good times from Walk edition of one and selling for a steal there. Here is Flora Marquez with some drawings. Well, I'd say digital drawing paintings. Let me take you through some of them here. So I believe this is on Surreal app and so playing with black and white subject with painting in the background.
01:01:05.127 - 01:01:30.151, Speaker A: Interesting contrast. And yeah, this is on Surreal app and I don't. I guess 4 minted is how you'd see it here. And yeah, so cool work from Flora Marquez out of Argentina. Mr. M, the myth out of Buenos Aires, who we saw at the start of the show with a new work on Super Rare. Putting out a ton of work on fire, so keeping it interesting here and unpredictable.
01:01:30.151 - 01:01:43.289, Speaker A: So a myth figure with maybe a wrestler hat, the lemon head perhaps, and holding a gun. And interesting work by the myth. This on super rare. Cool title. Mr. M. The myth is awakening.
01:01:43.289 - 01:02:02.161, Speaker A: The war is spiritual, and it's about to begin. So here it comes. October 28th, minted. Here's on Zora with a new work and 28 minted so far. And they're just another one of these, I guess you'd call it. Like, it's almost like a PFP project or whatever it is. Another masked figure here.
01:02:02.161 - 01:02:25.201, Speaker A: Beautiful with camouflage, done in myths, like, unmistakable style. Here is, I think Cesar is the name on object. And here a work as you see the Tazos logo tattooed on the face there. And so cool work. Cool digital painting on Instagram. Here is Renny Fish. Let's get this with a new work.
01:02:25.201 - 01:02:48.561, Speaker A: We'll look at the title in a second. Just get the audio. So cool. New work from Renny Fish. Again, these kind of translucent pastels and psychedelic pastels, almost like a placenta here of sorts. Very cool and fun work. Daytime rave.
01:02:48.561 - 01:03:04.201, Speaker A: Love it. October 24th, a new one from Renny Fish and that sold out at 15 tazos. Nice work. Edition of 10. And here is. Let me make this normal size. Here is Quampa with some works.
01:03:04.201 - 01:03:27.113, Speaker A: Color composition, study in Ms. Paint. And let me get that. Here we go. So let me just make that bigger here quickly, just so you get a clue as to what's going on. Looking like playing with some different techniques here, perhaps adding a little bit of the sampled brush and everything. So kind of a busy one, but it's pretty rad, isn't it? So Qampa.
01:03:27.113 - 01:03:56.385, Speaker A: And let's just look at the other works here. So this is, I think, going up closer. It is so a really kind of cool, busy digital artwork. Digital painting by Kwampa, I believe, out of Indonesia, if I'm not mistaken. Weisman Goldmanovich, the failed artist. 98 self portrait, failed artist trading card. Would you like fries with that? So there's the failed artist now with a makin fries and a McDonald's cast and hot dog in their hand.
01:03:56.385 - 01:04:09.633, Speaker A: Not a hamburger. And some little bit of dubious graffiti there in the background. Nice contrast, I might add, though. Nice move. Like, nice contrast. So cool. I love the.
01:04:09.633 - 01:04:34.275, Speaker A: It's almost like those old honest Onus Wagner, like the old like 19 teens trading cards. The only failed artist trading card in existence. Very rare edition of one. And soldier for eight Tezos at auction. Pretty this is by Katarina Create. So cool illustration here. Got some mushrooms and some clouds and a nice big heart here with Katerina create figure.
01:04:34.275 - 01:04:55.369, Speaker A: Imagine edition of one for 35 tezos just minted. And here is Andre Summer Blues. Of course I follow work in progress. Cool kind of psychedelic artwork here before the color comes in I assume. But we shall see. And here is Daniel W. Continuing with a super interesting color scheme here as above.
01:04:55.369 - 01:05:09.657, Speaker A: So below. And this is three tazos $0.20 edition of 40. So cool work here from Daniel W. Out of Brazil. There's almost like the tree. Was it the tree of life? Super cool there.
01:05:09.657 - 01:05:37.141, Speaker A: Here's Dylan fingerprint digital drawing. So pretty interesting piece here. As you get up close you can tell, you start to be able to tell that oh this is probably physical from a distance or sorry, digital from a distance. It almost looks physical, especially with this stuff underneath. Right. So a cool simulation here. Looks pretty good, doesn't it? You could take this top layers here and you could actually probably make a physical print out of that.
01:05:37.141 - 01:05:52.645, Speaker A: Pretty cool. And a fingerprint made out of these people holding hands. Pretty interesting. Astro number 773Z edition of 4. So a cool pixel art abstract here. And that is from R. Presti edition of 4.
01:05:52.645 - 01:06:16.451, Speaker A: As we run through this show bite by bit PIs and so not sure what the title is there but pretty interesting. Another interesting digital painting here using graphics two just minted there. That is an edition of one. And here I think Sabato retweeted this one. Koneko Nio. I thought this was pretty cool. Just interesting.
01:06:16.451 - 01:06:31.819, Speaker A: Different kind of pixel art here. Almost like wallpaper kind of design. Almost like video game design but you know, but deviating. Right. Like with the background like it's a little artier than a video game I thought. Really interesting. Here's a beautiful piece.
01:06:31.819 - 01:06:56.829, Speaker A: Posted by mech I don't know if it's new or not or if it's new colors on an older work, but I thought it looked great. Love the color scheme. This orange and violet, her hardest hue to hold. So also referencing the colors of cool work here and then interesting frame here in this other work. Posted by MEK Cool pixel artwork here. Gallant morning. Here's Kristen Roos Color bar city number three.
01:06:56.829 - 01:07:17.505, Speaker A: So another city by Kristen Rus number three. And this I think is still available. 35 tos addition of 15 and how many are left here? Three left. And yes, I think one of these older ones went for a few hundred tezos. Maybe that's why Kristen Roos is making more. They're popular. They're pretty cool.
01:07:17.505 - 01:07:38.235, Speaker A: Yuri J with four extra Js. I thought these are gorgeous. This octopus by Yuri J Color is like off the charts beautiful. Not easy to make this interesting of an artwork with eight by eight. It is doable. That is gorgeous. This is not cheap.
01:07:38.235 - 01:07:54.989, Speaker A: It is not cheap though. 369 tezos for this 8 bit by 8 bit work. So Yuri J recognizing that's a special one, of course here. Octopus number 60 oct. 60, 69 tezos. So. But it's still a very, very nice work here.
01:07:54.989 - 01:08:12.133, Speaker A: Are these octopi? Some people. I was just told octopi is wrong. I always learned that I was right. But you see how this one just jumps out at you. These others are pretty cool. And you gotta love the humor here too. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.
01:08:12.133 - 01:08:35.373, Speaker A: Let's continue edgy work referring, I believe, to Goya. Goya 1810-1815. I didn't bring up the original. I almost don't want to leave it on too long. But it was actually a pretty cool little work here. But yeah, unfortunately, all too close to reality of war, which is just the story, the history of humanity. The more you look at history, it's just the history of wars.
01:08:35.373 - 01:08:53.427, Speaker A: There's a reason for that because that's kind of basically all that they did, seemingly. That's why art, this art thing is a great thing to happen and that people actually care about it. Anyway, cool work there. Let me just look at the artist here. Bring the artist name Enter on super rare list. Price of 0.2 500 bucks.
01:08:53.427 - 01:09:14.943, Speaker A: Here's another one by Enter nothing until April. Pixel art version of the painting by Ed Russia. So Ed Russia with another appearance here. So playing off of Ed Rush's trope here, putting the text on top of the landscape. Paint nothing until April. Even kind of a pop message there. And here is Anis Abdin with a pretty cool pixel artwork.
01:09:14.943 - 01:09:38.215, Speaker A: Let me see if I can make it bigger. Let's do this. And so nice work here. And day 300 get going on the final track here. And there's a still version entering the final stretch for Annis Abdon. And putting out a work every day for a year. The ASCII portrait of the 80s role models are course he man.
01:09:38.215 - 01:09:57.574, Speaker A: This is by that pinball guy. And here we see some ASCII kind of mixed in with some pixelation. Interesting layering of different exports. I Believe and nice color and fun subject by the way. Masters of the universe. He Man. So 80s and that sold to uncurated for 10 tezos.
01:09:57.574 - 01:10:16.031, Speaker A: And really smart in the sense that you could tell it was a image of a screen. It was like a photo of a screen. Another layer. Very interestingly. Here's Hermit Bay Pixel art with a cool just animation here. It's a little fuzzed out unfortunately. Let's see what it says here.
01:10:16.031 - 01:10:32.997, Speaker A: GIF animation. After a long time I did a GIF anime job. So playing with animation a little bit. Hermipe. Very interesting artist there. Let's continue. This is on Zora and this is Blasve with a cool spider being done with what looks like ASCII or something.
01:10:32.997 - 01:11:08.973, Speaker A: And then using this interesting notepad operating system window as a framing device which is pretty cool. 42 minted. And here this was posted by Acid Boy Bubble Mirror. And pretty cool. Like I don't know if you'd call this generative art or painting art but interesting visual experience that we're having here. So pretty cool over there. Ed Creative coder.
01:11:08.973 - 01:11:30.581, Speaker A: And here's Acid Boy GM Fam. So I think I've seen this before, this loop but not with these colors. And I kind of loved how it scrolled almost or cycled through different kind of colors of the rainbow. Quite powerful with the ring in the middle doing its own kind of visual dance. So super interesting work from Acid Boy. Perfect loop. Tez control panel.
01:11:30.581 - 01:11:51.231, Speaker A: So more operating system. This time a Mac as subject matter and as really as paintbrush to a certain degree. Cool title there. Control panels. Here's John Windows still life number 121. Seeming to go with another Halloween theme. And here but more of a purple and black on this one.
01:11:51.231 - 01:12:10.035, Speaker A: Interesting. Keeping these kind of almost ASCII dots but I'm not sure what they are. Dots on top of the window here and there you see what looks like a cemetery but with the projector from the party. From the Halloween party. Pretty hilarious edition of 25 and taking offers. 130 tezos. 138.
01:12:10.035 - 01:12:24.539, Speaker A: So it definitely has their collectors there on Tezos. Kyle Flemmer. This is an edition of one Keep Building. So another nice piece here. Highly textured work by Kyle Flemmer. Look at that. And happy birthday to Kyle Flemmer.
01:12:24.539 - 01:12:32.593, Speaker A: Saw the post there. Super cool. 192 by 192. In his 30s I think. 36. Good work. 50 tezos.
01:12:32.593 - 01:12:55.365, Speaker A: And selling here is Ex Mortal Mirage. So more analog video glitch. Another landscape this one, really cool separation here between the hill and the background and the sky, I should say. You see that noise and then just beautiful. Kind of almost like layered glitches here. Addition of 15, selling out at 17 tezos. So just awesome.
01:12:55.365 - 01:13:24.091, Speaker A: Here's Kiro with a work called Workshop, another video painting, as I love to call them here. Foundation is where it is minted on base. We'll see if it shows up. And there it is. So another cool work. And often these are taken, I think, from AI works that we're getting back to this prototype or type. Using AI as the starting ground to get novel compositions and then doing your thing interestingly over top.
01:13:24.091 - 01:13:46.019, Speaker A: In a sense, that's what I did with the Bacchus in my work. I'll show it very quickly. First, let's look at Geno with another cool video work here. This is analog video glitch. Interesting. Different kind of glitch. And I kind of love how the bottom part is just edgily kind of overtaken by the glitch there.
01:13:46.019 - 01:14:00.255, Speaker A: There's an addition of 10 for 12 tazos. And there is one on secondary. So sold out. And let me just see. Let me see if I can bring up that work. You know, just to the point here. Oh, no, it was.
01:14:00.255 - 01:14:29.525, Speaker A: Where is that work? There's a work very quickly called Bacchanal. And let me very. Is it this old here? It is. So it's interesting. So this is interesting because this is taken from AI as the source. So you see the kind of like, okay, and I made a million renders. Instead of just putting that render and going, okay, I didn't love the like, I loved the composition.
01:14:29.525 - 01:15:06.771, Speaker A: And I was like, okay, what do I do with this? So here then I do my thing on top of it, right? Do my little pixel art thing. So isn't it interesting? You know, again, using AI is kind of like your compositional tool, so to speak. You're kind of a starting ground. It doesn't need to be the starting ground, but it's interesting way of approaching it. I'm sure physical painters are also doing this, right? Composition 373. So this is Klaus with a new work here. Very nice textured, beautiful addition to this series, composition 373.
01:15:06.771 - 01:15:28.011, Speaker A: It's called geometrically, the series that is 23 Tazo. Still available. Here's Renki called. No, so a new animated abstract here from the super edgy Renki. And I keep hearing every so often I'll see a comment on an old video and all of a sudden Renki also comments. Shout out to re with a nice comment. I think this weekend.
01:15:28.011 - 01:15:53.635, Speaker A: Here's Ilay with a beautiful series serendipity. Look at this. I came pretty like this could have started the show like this is a pretty nice composition here. Beautiful work from Ilay. It is sold out. Cancel DO NOT CALL emergency. So that's my phone that has taken a life of its own here.
01:15:53.635 - 01:16:10.725, Speaker A: Wanting to call emergency services. I don't know how they got to that point from what I was saying. Anyways, look at this. I was talking about how beautiful this artwork was. And as you see stunning AI artwork here. Love the background. It's just really nice painting.
01:16:10.725 - 01:16:30.155, Speaker A: Edition of five and selling out. How much did this sell for? 222 AI vanity test. Here's another Serendipity number four. So some very nice AI paintings from iLay. And we have another number one. So just picking a few but all a very nice series here from. From Ilay.
01:16:30.155 - 01:16:42.799, Speaker A: Let's continue. Here's Benta. Look at this. Some more kind of variations on AI in the process. Digital painting and AI versions. Collect one to be airdropped. The other six editions for five tazos.
01:16:42.799 - 01:16:59.493, Speaker A: Link below. So here is the AI version. Date Night AI and it's super interesting what VENT is doing here. And I love the subject matter of Date Night. Nice modern kind of subject matter. And know sharing a wine. And then that is based on this painting here.
01:16:59.493 - 01:17:28.541, Speaker A: Here's a digital painting, right? So instead of starting from the AI in a sense Venta is reversing the situation and saying I'm going to start from a painting and then I'm going to add AI processing on top rather than putting my AI composition and putting my digital processing on top. So it gets pretty wild, doesn't it? Date Night. So five Tazos addition to six. Very interesting concept. Here's time. The artist formerly known as Santiago with a beautiful textured work. This is why I love you.
01:17:28.541 - 01:17:38.757, Speaker A: Beautiful textures here. I don't think we saw this one. Love the lines and everything. Love the color. Very nice. And here's another one by Santiago. Almost taking.
01:17:38.757 - 01:17:58.015, Speaker A: You can almost recognize the reference here and then just completely, you know, arted out. GM a very nice piece here. Great color. Here's RJ the fairies. And here kind of an AI video with some dithering. Interesting piece here. This is an addition of one or that was burned.
01:17:58.015 - 01:18:10.931, Speaker A: So that was 400 tezos time. This is by time. I thought this was canxapata. That's funny because you know why? Because of the rainbow. The rainbow Colors. But this is time. So.
01:18:10.931 - 01:18:28.829, Speaker A: Which is also Santiago D, the letter D. So also collecting. Cool. No Twitter account. I want to tag them on Twitter because they bought the piece that I sold there. So interesting. Good to see D, the letter D again as we have another mysterious wallet to understand.
01:18:28.829 - 01:18:42.625, Speaker A: So beautiful work. More interesting AI. And here's no hygiene 8x. This almost looks like Roman. What do you call it? Sepulchre, if I'm pronouncing that right. But who knows what it is. And look at this edge.
01:18:42.625 - 01:19:03.949, Speaker A: It's almost like a drawn edge of this wild work with this angel kind of put on each side. Wild as we go into the physical. Moto583 with a beautiful lava lamp with legs here. Here's another one. Austin Anspro, Charlie Brown and Snoopy. Beautiful. Super interesting.
01:19:03.949 - 01:19:17.573, Speaker A: Fun. Cool. Let's continue. Here is Ochiai Shohei, who we were starting with the other day with another distorted work. Awesome hat. Just a rad artist here. And there's the hat.
01:19:17.573 - 01:19:43.353, Speaker A: So a lot of these Japanese artists having pretty cool kind of commercial opportunities. Interestingly, here's Babichi Matiha with a different kind of work here. Kind of more horizontal rather than vertical and almost plain with a princess motif. Apocalyptic Rider 2024, oil and acrylic. And here is Devour Gromilovic, an artist I don't think I've seen before. An interesting kind of. I think it's graphite.
01:19:43.353 - 01:19:54.721, Speaker A: Graphite and colored pencils. And just a little bit of colored pencil in there. Super interesting. Just a little bit of green. Seemingly. Very interesting. Kind of a Halloween esque work here.
01:19:54.721 - 01:20:08.877, Speaker A: Kind of reminds me of Zap comics a little bit from the 1960s. And here is Bondozo Bandido with another really cool work. Almost looks like crayon there, but hard to tell. Hell is fun. And these, it's. Is that crayon too? Maybe. We'll see.
01:20:08.877 - 01:20:31.221, Speaker A: So it looks like mixed media, doesn't it? Just the ever prolific Bundozo Bandido. So very. Yeah, it looks like crayon mixed with paint. Super interesting. Nice effect. And here is Psychoduni Psychudini, Houdini, Psychodyni Psychudini. Acrylic on canvas to the limit.
01:20:31.221 - 01:20:53.281, Speaker A: Interesting painting here. Kind of looks like airbrush. And here, Noah Verrier, my oil painting of chicken tenders. So again, see HP Love bucks would categorize this work here as post Americana. So again, kind of this very modern still life. And here's Jeremy Miranda. Split.
01:20:53.281 - 01:21:07.357, Speaker A: So interesting doing a motorway here. I couldn't tell if this was physical or digital? It kind of looks like either. I just don't know. Which I find kind of interesting in itself. And that is your show, my friends. At least it's 15 minutes. Actually more.
01:21:07.357 - 01:21:14.185, Speaker A: 25 minutes shorter than last show, but still way too long. I am working on it. Thank you for joining me. Until next time. Take care.
