00:00:05.520 - 00:00:51.934, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 1, 2022. My name is Adrian Pokebelli in Berlin, keeping tabs on everything. And, guys, I'm getting excited. I'm getting very excited by everything I'm seeing. It was kind of funny after yesterday's episode, which is kind of like, again, the reality of artists lives, I started seeing some really, really bullish things and just exciting things. Not bullish necessarily in a financial way, even though it probably will end up that way. Who knows? I'm not here to prognosticate, but I'm getting bullish just on everything I'm seeing, almost in terms of vibe.
00:00:51.934 - 00:01:32.806, Speaker A: And we're, you know, this thought keeps going back in my mind, this idea of the collector versus the patron. And, you know, patrons are what made the Renaissance okay, like the Medici, the real Medici, they made the renaissance by basically nurturing talent. And that was kind of the point I was getting at last episode, this idea of nurturing talent. And I understand that many people do not have 1.3 tezos to nurture talent, but a lot of people do. A lot of people do have $2. And so.
00:01:32.806 - 00:02:22.314, Speaker A: And you know what I was also thinking to myself, which I think is also related to this directly, which is, you don't need to nurture talent by spending tazos or however else ETH you name it, Solana, whatever. You can nurture talent by simply putting a favorite or leaving a comment or retweeting. Artists that are kind of being, you know, that might need, like, even if they're doing well, as we were saying yesterday on this platform, I don't think anybody's living from it yet. Louis Osborne is starting to get close. You know, rat cloak, see, is basically, his market's improving as we're going to take a look. But I don't think anybody's like, you know, sailing off into the sunset quite yet. So very bullish things I want to get to here.
00:02:22.314 - 00:03:02.284, Speaker A: First and foremost. Again, I really like Adelia's work. Again, I think I keep coming back to this idea of the native Internet artist that plays to object strength. That is what object and the whole Tezos platform, I would argue, helped bring about. Again, these artists that just kind of arose on the Internet, which may not have made it through these gatekeeping filters. We saw Sabato, you know, who's pretty respectable in what he does. We can all, I think a lot of us can agree on that was not let into form function.
00:03:02.284 - 00:03:48.360, Speaker A: Okay, so that's why the open platform has a kind of, you might call it a structural strength that some of the other platforms might not have. And again, don't get me wrong. I'm happy to be on super rare as well as object. I like both, frankly, because, again, the sales I've made on super rare, although relative to other people, are nothing special for me, are spectacular. Five, $6,000. And right now, I don't think I'm going to get that on tazos. If the myth is struggling to get the 250 tezos, which I ended up coming in there as a late bid to get that myth work we've been discussing, or if Ratclaxy is getting, you know, he actually got a nice amount, we'll go into that.
00:03:48.360 - 00:04:08.944, Speaker A: So, first of all, Adelia has a new series she put out, this one of one. I missed this entirely. She put it as an auction. And usually, you know, quick tip. I mean, auctions are where you're going to get the best deals. In my opinion. Someone paid 1000 tezos for a Adelia.
00:04:08.944 - 00:04:34.760, Speaker A: One of one. This is quite a nice one. She's starting Adelia's new journey. You're seeing more one of ones. Do you notice that? And she is starting her new journey, which I'm very excited about, pop art vibes. And so quick look at the history just so we can see what's going on. She's one of these artists that we are using as a gauge, as a case study, just with Lewis Osborne.
00:04:34.760 - 00:05:10.750, Speaker A: We'll go to him, too. Very interesting developments over there. So I don't feel too bad about missing this auction because maybe more than I want to spend right now, even though I think this is probably a steal at 450 tezos for a major, you know, $700, maybe for 750 for a, what you might call a major Tezos artist, object artist, however you want to put it. Look at all the bids. And you got bids right away. She started at 15. And this person here.
00:05:10.750 - 00:05:28.054, Speaker A: Rvh, I don't know if we have details on this person. Not really. They really wanted this piece. They have 52. They have about, you know, this is close to, I think this is the same amount of pages I have. So it's about 1250 works. I calculate it every so often.
00:05:28.054 - 00:05:49.406, Speaker A: So actually, a pretty serious collector here, we could say. And, yeah, they wanted this work. You see, they made a few bids, so it was a bit of a bidding war. They came in late, which is what you do. Okay. Don't start. You know, from a collector's point of view, the artists want the bids early because that means it's probably gonna go higher from a collector's point.
00:05:49.406 - 00:06:26.408, Speaker A: Of view. You still want to pull the eBay move, which is kind of bidding at the last second here. Although on this platform, you will, you know, it'll go another ten minutes, which I think is totally fair. And then the artist gets the, we might call, a realer value of what the work is worth or what people are willing to pay, not just who happen to snipe in at the last second. So I'm actually all for that function where the clock gets extended ten minutes, as many of us know. So, again, just looking at Adelia's work here, just a very cool pop artwork we see. You know, what stood out to me is the Internet iconography.
00:06:26.408 - 00:06:40.244, Speaker A: Like the browser here, window open, close. Nice color. Okay. So she adds some color to it. We have kind of like the Mac windows thing here. So back to this almost idea of an Internet pop. You know, these clouds keep appearing.
00:06:40.244 - 00:07:04.774, Speaker A: And so zero, zero, eight. So not zero, zero, seven, but she is on the scene. And what is the title of this work? The secret agent. What is your command? So very interesting and exciting. Really. I love the color in this work. White is very interesting as a color, kind of powerful as a background color.
00:07:04.774 - 00:07:24.788, Speaker A: I'm still trying to figure out white in a lot of ways. Let's find another one. Rat Cloaksey did fabulously yesterday. He had an auction. He started it higher at 30 tezos. And you see this elephant painting, beautifully painted. He's getting.
00:07:24.788 - 00:07:54.428, Speaker A: I'd almost say these backgrounds are getting kind of more detailed and elaborate. I was gonna say he's getting better, but who knows? But it's pretty impressive. And you kind of have this. Is this the elephant man? I don't know who this is. Other people may know this reference. There was a bit, you know, I don't know if I'd call it a bidding war, but a few people wanted this really interesting piece. I don't know if I have too much to say about it other than that, I mean, just looks like the Elephant man or something.
00:07:54.428 - 00:08:03.500, Speaker A: Or some reference to that. Again, you guys might have. Hey, we got phone art. Yeah, we got phone art. Good. Yeah. Finger art.
00:08:03.500 - 00:08:12.948, Speaker A: Phone art. Mobile art. A little hat tip from ratcloak. See, that's awesome. So, thank you. Rat cloak. See, look at the.
00:08:12.948 - 00:08:35.300, Speaker A: I mean, again, small community, guys. We gotta love it. You just gotta love it. Like, we'll probably look back on these days as the Halican or Halison days or the golden days, when. Wasn't that hilarious? When you could buy a rat cloak, see, for 60 tesos or $60. That's changing, though, however. So, started at 30, Roerich came in.
00:08:35.300 - 00:08:56.747, Speaker A: It's like we need Roerich for the play by plays. I'm actually half serious. If this whole thing explodes, which is possible. It may not, but which is possible. Rurich, I actually think he's got a role to play somewhere. You see light, dark, really wanted this thing, and so did this person with the L at the end. There's a bidding war.
00:08:56.747 - 00:09:25.032, Speaker A: I mean, they started it really early, the bidding war, which is great for rat cloak. See, because I think this is the highest amount, as far as I know. Leave a comment if I'm wrong, but I think this is the highest amount he got. He's gotten for one of these, what I call phone artworks at 160 tezos. So that's good. This is progress, folks. That is, I think, around $250 times 1.52
00:09:25.032 - 00:09:38.196, Speaker A: or $90. Like, that's more like it, guys. That is more like it. You know, so. And it's beautifully painted. So, again, that person probably still got a deal. I want to just quickly look.
00:09:38.196 - 00:09:54.584, Speaker A: Our case study here, Lewis Osborne. Some remarkable sales. Let's just refresh in case anything's happened. Yeah. So, some remarkable sales. You see his market? You know how I was saying, oh, maybe it's cooled down a bit. It hasn't cooled down.
00:09:54.584 - 00:10:16.574, Speaker A: Like, these are the last 24 hours. He got one of his moving cities here. Sold for 110. It's an addition of 25. Okay. So, as I buy the myth for 250, I say for a one of one, I'm just like, you know, I'm feeling great. Okay.
00:10:16.574 - 00:10:39.112, Speaker A: Cause this addition of 25. I mean, amazing, though, selling for 110. So, again, it's tempting to think this is what we can expect. So, just kind of more evidence of what's happening. There were other sales, too. Oh, I didn't even say the biggest one, guys. This went for 169 moving cities.
00:10:39.112 - 00:10:56.930, Speaker A: Number two. So he's had a pretty good day. This was yesterday, so. And I think we had another one there. Let's just look. Oops, sorry. Yeah.
00:10:56.930 - 00:11:18.686, Speaker A: And then another moving cities for this beautiful red one. I would have loved to have gotten that one. That also sold for 100. So pretty impressive sales. Just made a 24 tezos, 18 tezos for an addition of 100. So, think about it. There are seven point.
00:11:18.686 - 00:11:53.796, Speaker A: I mean, we're probably getting close to 8 billion people on the planet. We kind of have, like, I feel like a few hundred collectors here. Maybe, let's call it, be generous and say a couple of thousand. I don't think we do have a couple of thousand serious, quote, unquote, you know, intense collectors, let's put it that way. What happens if the world gets onboarded here? Because it seems kind of possible. And what happens is also in an edition of 100, you know, Warhols did editions of 125. Okay, and how much does a warhol go for? I don't know.
00:11:53.796 - 00:12:30.240, Speaker A: I think you can get one for what I find reasonably cheap, considering where crypto was last year and everything that was going on. I think you can get a warhol for like, 25,000, which sounds insane, but when you look at the prices of some of the art on Ethereum, you go and just look at what gets sold on super rare. Some of it starts to approach that, some of it goes way past that. So always keep that in mind if you're dropping big bucks. I'm not in that league. But if you're one of these kind of true whale buying on Ethereum, just don't forget to look. And I'm all for it.
00:12:30.240 - 00:12:58.886, Speaker A: And I'm a huge fan of nfts and digital art and supporting super rare, who have helped me enormously. But don't forget about the real art or the physical art world. Not the real art world, the physical art world, where you can buy a Warhol for, you know, just remember what else you can buy for that amount of money, is all. I would say. Again, more reasons to feel bullish. I woke up to this great gloom tube in my wallet. This beautiful gloom tube.
00:12:58.886 - 00:13:15.806, Speaker A: Look at that color. Gloom grown in USA. So this looks like a nice big orange. I think he gave it to all his collectors. And let's just go to his Twitter because he wrote a really nice tweet which kind of made me bullish. This is how. Look at that.
00:13:15.806 - 00:13:30.354, Speaker A: That's cool. Here it is. Newest piece, hesperidium, has been sent to all collector card holders. I have set 0.7% royalties for each collector holder. Collector card holder as well. Do what you like with them.
00:13:30.354 - 00:14:00.534, Speaker A: So just an awesome way to begin the day, courtesy of Gloomtube. Thank you. Totally awesome. And another one. Hey, remember just from last episode, we were worrying maybe I was over wringing my hands over groove streets and thinking, oh, is this guy going to stop his ceres? This thing's just getting started, okay? And as an artist, we have to understand that series are going to develop here. And look at this. Now he's added the grove.
00:14:00.534 - 00:14:28.376, Speaker A: I never know if it's groove or grove, but he added some spray paint the mix. So this is how. So this is why it's good. Back to this idea of the patron versus the collector. By, you know, by starting when things are humble and still kind of, you're. You're not just buying an artwork when you're a patron. You're funding an intellectual enterprise, okay? And this is the difference between the Renaissance and just some art movement.
00:14:28.376 - 00:15:11.852, Speaker A: They had patrons. That's even a lot of the scientists in the 18th century, from my understanding, you look at their books, because most of them just wrote books to publish their work, and you see the patron lord, so and so. Thank you for basically the patron patrimony. Okay, so if we all start having. If this community starts adopting, even if it's just in retweets and tweeting, favoriting, if we start adopting a patronage mindset, things start to open up. Let's just put it that way. In a really kind of almost what I would call a dangerous way, okay? Because things.
00:15:11.852 - 00:15:56.462, Speaker A: The world is smaller than we think sometimes. And sometimes we might think, oh, we're just doing our little digital art thing on Tezos, and this doesn't matter to the wider world until it does. Okay? Again, I look at this, and, you know, my side gig is in news, which is probably why I'm kind of got this broadcaster side to me. And I just look at us as I just see a gold mine. And if I was working for art News or whatever, I would be going, we need a. If I was editor in chief, I'd be going, we need a reporter on this beat, okay? Because this is huge, and nobody is talking about it. We have to enjoy that.
00:15:56.462 - 00:16:19.334, Speaker A: Okay? So you ain't gonna catch me. B I T c h. Keeping it family friendly here on artists, on Adrian Poker's artist journal. So the sports series is back. Thrilled. And you know what? I'm just so proud. I'm as proud of groove streets for coming back and not giving up, because that's what it's all about, folks.
00:16:19.334 - 00:16:31.536, Speaker A: Like, you have to persist as an artist. I'm just as proud of this community. Mikey Wilson. Three, a five, a one a crush. Like, who are buying the work? Okay. Like, let's. Like.
00:16:31.536 - 00:17:00.966, Speaker A: It's pretty cool, guys. You know? It's pretty cool. So excited about that. This is a one of one. Again, I'm trying not to spend money here, but Ed Marolla, who I'm sure a lot of you guys are familiar with, he put out this work and kind of just an interesting, like, unusual pixel artist guy, almost all in purple. Well, look at his. We'll look at his page in a second here.
00:17:00.966 - 00:17:43.984, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get the music going. The music sold me and I just thought of this in a museum, like you think about this, this is the kind of museum I want to go to where I see kind of crazy works, this. So for 50 tezos, for a one of one, I thought, screw it, buy it. You know, I mean, sometimes you just got to make quick decisions. So I spent, again, too much money that I don't really have to afford. I want to buy this. I may buy this before I publish this.
00:17:43.984 - 00:18:06.344, Speaker A: I was looking at this, but again, I guess the reason I had it here, more interesting pixel art. Before we go on though, I just want to quickly give you a quick overview of Ed Marolla. You see, it's all this, like he's got another one like this. Look, someone's selling it. Edition of eleven. I mean, again, these sale numbers don't. It's what they sell for, that's the real market.
00:18:06.344 - 00:18:44.476, Speaker A: But you see, he's got this kind of pixel art, really kind of that he's made his own and he adds music in there in a lot of them. So again, one of these native Internet artists. Internet native artists, however you want to put that. So this guy I've just discovered recently, I think a lot of people have Mech TXT. He's got some beautiful pixel art that he's been doing. I was looking at this piece that he just released. I might have to pick that up.
00:18:44.476 - 00:19:12.944, Speaker A: It's almost impossible to get his work because pixel art sells guys like there's. And I understand why, like I love pixel art, that's why, like, you know, I put together my little eight bit nature series. Like why not have a pixel art series? I love that stuff. And I just want to get better and better at it. This guy's quite good. I think he's out of Indonesia. I just wanted to show you first look at all the offers again the popularity of pixel art.
00:19:12.944 - 00:19:56.280, Speaker A: And then you look at the sales listed at 1758 and by four minutes later the edition of 20 is sold out. And it almost all went to different people. There was one person who managed to get two. So this guy I kind of have my eye on Mec TXT, who seems to be in Indonesia, Michael Alexander, just a really interesting pixel artist. I'll show you a couple of his other works quickly. This was sent as an airdrop to people who bought on primary. So I'm way behind here.
00:19:56.280 - 00:20:15.104, Speaker A: I could have got for. Well, if I was quick enough, which I wasn't, you can get it for two tezos. Now it's going to cost you like eleven or twelve. So this is another work by him. I like these nature works. Again for me. Why I did an eight bit nature series.
00:20:15.104 - 00:20:43.614, Speaker A: I like that contrast. And maybe he feels the same way. That contrast between nature and the hard pixels organic, biological, organic nature versus the hard pixel digital world. It's a natural contrast to use to portray so. And kind of a nice small version here. And finally, what do we have? I think this is our final piece. Here we have another pixel artist who.
00:20:43.614 - 00:21:05.704, Speaker A: I think this has music to it. Let me just see. And I find this guy, actually, or woman. 196 pixels light. I find 196 pixels. Pretty cool. I'll show you another one that I really liked.
00:21:05.704 - 00:21:21.108, Speaker A: Let's just go to their page. They just minted that, by the way. You can still get it for 265. This was another one I loved. I own this, I believe. Yes. And I just saw these kind of side by side in the museum.
00:21:21.108 - 00:21:55.144, Speaker A: We'll see if it loads up here. Kind of a space theme. UFO's, the sheep going up, the cool user interfaces, the planets. Again, just the music kind of the video game. Eight bit video game music. So in the gallery, in my mind, I see these two works just side by side, because this also has a UFO reference. So I thought you can see it in the background here.
00:21:55.144 - 00:22:11.424, Speaker A: So, anyway, glad to see what's going on here, guys. And, you know, again, great to see groove streets back on the scene with a new soccer work. Anyway, that's all for today's episode. Until next time, take care.
