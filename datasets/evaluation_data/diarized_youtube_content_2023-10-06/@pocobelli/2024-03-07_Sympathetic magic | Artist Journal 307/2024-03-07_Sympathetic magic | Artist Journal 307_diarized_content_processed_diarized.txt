00:00:03.280 - 00:00:33.676, Speaker A: We're going to rush through this one. We have a hard deadline in an hour and 15 minutes, and it was yesterday at the hour 42 mark that we basically, OBS stopped me out, and we're already starting to get jammed out here. So we're under stormy conditions in the internal world here in inner space, but in outer space, it's starting to look really beautiful outside. Anyways, welcome back. Artist journal, March 7, 2024. Broadcasting from the editor's desk on the pirate ship in the sky, the weirdest show in the world. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and.
00:00:33.676 - 00:00:53.948, Speaker A: Welcome back. Welcome back. So, let's just go. And again. Yeah, kind of technical difficulties there yesterday. We'll see what happens today if it keeps happening. Basically, the computer needs a big cleanup, but who has time for that? Who has time for that? Sorting through files and everything, but it's got to be done.
00:00:53.948 - 00:01:30.634, Speaker A: Okay, so the artist here, Skye Goodman, and also in collaboration, this is a remix, actually commissioned portrait for du Bores. Original portrait is a work of art created by du Bores. What I love about this work is it kind of has. Looks like a classical sculpture, but it's been completely glitched out beautifully, I might add, glitched out here. And so it just felt like such a representative work of what we're up to here, this whole project of beauty. And that got me thinking as well. Interesting kind of weaving sorts here, too.
00:01:30.634 - 00:02:55.304, Speaker A: And, of course, Sky Goodman, glitch artist, at least for ten years, as we were seeing on the x feed there, and does a ton of exporting. It looks like there's a couple of things going on here, like this. Whatever this process is here in the middle is combining seemingly with this kind of what looks like analog video glitch, which we seem to have in the horizontal as well as in this kind of rainbow area. But it got me thinking. It's funny how art can provoke these thoughts that I've never had before, which is, you know, I was thinking, oh, you know, this project that we're embarked on here, as far as, you know, beauty, let's say, and let's pray to the computer gods here today that this recording works. Now, there seems to be how my question that I was just thinking here, as I was loading up and the coffee was hitting my neurons here, was, has the project of art changed from Lascaux, the cave paintings, to Greece? Because in a sense, when I look at this, I say, this project we're embarked on now, we're incorporating contemporary tools in a similar project, arguably a copy of a copy here. A postmodern work, we could argue, speaking very loosely within our conversation we're having about this.
00:02:55.304 - 00:03:35.614, Speaker A: But has the project of art changed between Lascaux and Greece to be very loose and over general about it? And it's kind of an interesting question, because Greece, again, to be over generalized, but for the sake of illustration, that's about beauty. The beauty of the human form. Naturalism. Right. Or just capturing nature in an authentic and beautiful way, even idealizing it, you know, at least what they were trying to do. That's not the impression I got with Lascaux. Lascaux, it seems more like the province or the area of the mind of ritual, of magic, of invocation.
00:03:35.614 - 00:03:53.294, Speaker A: Let's, you know, draw the bison. The bison. The bison. To invoke the hunt. And maybe through a kind of sympathetic magic, you know, I think a Lee Perry. Lee scratch Perry, who I interviewed, by the way, that's still on the Internet. I actually need to dig that up.
00:03:53.294 - 00:04:31.624, Speaker A: Anyway, sympathetic magic. And again, let's pray to the computer gods here. Is that what was going on at Lascaux? That is kind of my sense. Let's draw the bison, and maybe we find bison tomorrow again. And just finally, actually. And the reason I think, of Lee Perry is because I drew a picture of Lee Perry, uh, the day before that, I ended up interview, uh, getting the opportunity to interview him, and I actually did it consciously in a kind of sympathetic magic sort of way. And I'm not some, you know, sympathetic ma.
00:04:31.624 - 00:04:52.170, Speaker A: Like, I'm actually. I'm kind of loosely. I'm not against these ideas, but I, you know, I'm a pretty skeptical, scientific person for the most part. I'm still an artist. Anyway, uh, let's look at this work a little closer. Again, Sky Goodman exporting, using several tools here. Let me go to the original.
00:04:52.170 - 00:05:27.036, Speaker A: Also, because this is very illustrative, the original. Here's Deborah and I went to Duborris's page with an awesome Rezo print here, as you see here. Rezograph, gif. So a rizoprint that has been animated very simply, I might add. You know, you don't need to do much animate something here. It's like the image was moved a couple of, you know, a centimeter over and then a centimeter up, and then a yellow background given in a pink background, and before you know it, you have a gif. And Rezo is actually quite a complex or.
00:05:27.036 - 00:05:55.460, Speaker A: Sorry, it's actually, it's. Again, I think I've referred to it before. And, you know, the poor person screen printing. It's a beautiful process, though that is not to be, as you can see here, quite effective, as a matter of fact, you know, and it works quite beautifully, and it's a lot faster if you know what you're doing. It's good to keep things simple, which du Boris has done here. But again, kind of a classical looking statue. I don't know if that almost looks like an Alexander the great, but who knows? Just could be some.
00:05:55.460 - 00:06:46.298, Speaker A: Some God, some goddess. So that is the original one thinks. As we come back to Sky Goodman's version, and we see the power of analog video glitch as a remixing tool, we think of Eizo, who did all those portraits of many of the artists in this scene. And again, I sent Azo a picture when he did one of me, and he sent back 20 versions, and he's like, do you have any favorites? So again, the power of this kind of. It's like the most, you know, again, it's this sampling tool. And we're almost back to this postmodern idea. And we see a lot of, you know, interesting similarities between the visual arts and techno, which I actually don't think there are enough comparisons being made.
00:06:46.298 - 00:07:15.278, Speaker A: And, you know, I call it visual hip hop in one episode here, you know, as you see, like, here are the synths that are being used, the synthesizers. It was used as a source for the modified ederal V four and Panasonic M 50. Glitched, rescanned off a CRT. So scanned off of a CRT. So I assume off a tv, somehow scanned either with one of those cool tools we saw the other day. Maybe a picture, who knows, with a digital camera. So maybe a picture taken of a tv.
00:07:15.278 - 00:07:53.634, Speaker A: An interesting process. That image was then pixel sorted, allowing for a mix of analog and digital glitches merging together. So beautiful, beautiful work here. And again, just seems so symbolic of what we're up to here in this, you know, again, using contemporary tools on this kind of classic subject here, which is also, you know, a copy of a copy here. So we still, you know, back to our hyper postmodernism conversation. We still, I would argue, are in the land of postmodernism because we still have a copy that. We still have the referent, we still have the work that the co.
00:07:53.634 - 00:08:14.648, Speaker A: That the. That sky Goodman's copy is copied from. Right. So just to work with our kind of loose definitions here as we move forward, here's just another beautiful work. I was going through Sky Goodman's feed here. Look at how awesome this is. Somehow this missed my glance here in December, standard affairs with form and abstraction.
00:08:14.648 - 00:09:02.302, Speaker A: A sneaker, Sky Goodman. So this sold for only so edition of twelve. So just beautiful combination of tools here again, often using AI and often using other tools here. I guess we got blender AI, so unafraid to use several tools. And then it's very powerful again. There's a great book which I've mentioned here a few times, the nature of technology, which I've only read the first 3rd, but it's incredibly good and I should finish it. But it's talking about how the way that technology evolves is one of the main ways is through combination, taking this piece of technology and that piece of technology and combining them together.
00:09:02.302 - 00:09:34.748, Speaker A: And then you get a jet engine, right? You take a transistor here and then you take some sort of aerospace technology here and before you know it, you have a jet engine technology, you know, combination. So combination is not to be underestimated, what I sometimes call exporting. It is incredibly powerful, as you see in that image. Here's one more Sky Goodman. And let's just make this big. It starts with a love of basketball. Being a 1980s baby, I want to make a LeBron sneaker from my collab with mental noise last year.
00:09:34.748 - 00:10:02.880, Speaker A: And now you can collect the full sneaker as a free mint on Zora. So this rad artwork here, as you can see. And of course, Sky, I would say, well known for the sneaker artworks. This is on Zora. So Skye's on Zora, which is super cool. So a really cool work as we continue to sprint through this episode from Sky Goodman and Duboris, a collaboration of sorts, a remix of Duborris work. So this has happened now, Zach Krevet.
00:10:02.880 - 00:10:41.796, Speaker A: So we had a beautiful space yesterday with Zack from Zora. Super interesting. If you want to hear how, you know, Zach is thinking about actually Zach's background as a photographer, which is super interesting, really a professional photographer there working for several and artists. And then, you know, only coming to Zora, it feels like, it seems as far as I understood the conversation only a year ago, it feels like three, but only, you know, a little over a year, I think. And you also get Zach's thinking on how Zora kind of sees itself a kind of Instagram of sorts, very interestingly to farcasters, Twitter. Interestingly. So check that out.
00:10:41.796 - 00:11:08.044, Speaker A: That is in the feed. Quickly through the comments here before the computer crashes. Once again, bosque. Gracias. Thank you so much for your review on our art residency at Patagonia in Argentina. We are very happy with the result of having strengthened community, living all together in the same space with natural systems included. And why not? At the same time, technology, art and blockchain kind of feels like a window on the future to a certain degree.
00:11:08.044 - 00:11:51.686, Speaker A: As I read these words here, the NFT artist is an unexpected visitor. It's a very diverse ecosystem with people of all types and ages, and it was great to discover how rewarding it can be to come together with just mutual support and learn from each other. We can all pursue our dreams. And again, all the great movements of the early 20th century, you could argue, of the first half of the 20th century, maybe up to the abstract expressionists, were groups, especially in the. You know, when you're talking about the modernists, like the futurists, like the surrealists, they were groups, even the cubists. You know, there's Braque and Picasso. So when I hear.
00:11:51.686 - 00:12:21.550, Speaker A: When I see this collaboration, especially, it's just artists doing it on their own, not. Cause there was some big call of, like, some big institution is saying, hey, we have a bunch of money for you guys, and then you guys can all do something, and we can all pretend that something happened here. We have a bunch of artists coming together on their own. This becomes a powerful tonic, shall we say? So let's continue here. Fornax void. Awesome to hear from Fornax void. That's so nice of you putting all these new pieces of mine in this epic episode.
00:12:21.550 - 00:13:02.182, Speaker A: Thank you, Fornax void. You know, I've gotten a couple of messages probably a year ago, like, no, you have to check out Fornax's void work. He's influenced a lot of us. So it's awesome to hear from the great Fornax void here. Speaking of full circle, relaxing my workflow a bit and experimenting with more abstract expressions, once again, was actually inspired by watching your excellent show and all those great works you're curating on here made me very excited. See, in the result of your inspiration, your show gave me fluxing back into the show a few episodes later, epic hive mind vibes and rip to Jerry Saltz. Hilarious and really thrilled.
00:13:02.182 - 00:13:33.346, Speaker A: You know, that is, you know, in a sense, we're having our own little meeting here, all of us, you know, ideas going back and forth here. You know, it's so much easier. Learning and collaboration does speed up the process, doesn't it? Hopefully, that's part of what this show can do, is kind of just help catalyze what's already there, you know, activating actualizing potentialities, so to speak. So this is awesome. Wonderful to hear from Fornix there. Fornix void. DJ Quiro, great episode watching now.
00:13:33.346 - 00:13:54.666, Speaker A: Thank you for the continued support and constant inspiration. I would mention a life changing event after your plumber analogy. Got a bidet. And I keep it running while spending tazos in your creation. So clearly, Kiro is enjoying what he's seen. All the great art you guys are putting out there, and just can't help himself here. Ed Marolla, can't wait.
00:13:54.666 - 00:14:06.474, Speaker A: And great to hear from you, Kiro, as ever. And yeah, looking forward to new works. I haven't seen a. Yeah. Okay, let's continue here. Ed Marolla, can't wait to see your rendition of Dante's Inferno. You know, very interesting and very quickly.
00:14:06.474 - 00:14:47.168, Speaker A: So I'm working on a incredibly. I'm trying to make between two and four kilobyte files of, you know, each of the Kantos of the inferno using kind of pixel art style, which is incredibly challenging, as you can imagine. What's interesting about it, just very quickly on this, and thank you for mentioning it, Ed, is how do you start? Okay, so maybe at first I was like, oh, I can make them all with AI, and that can be the source. And then so I did that, started making some, and I wasn't happy with what I was seeing from the AI. It wasn't doing what I saw, so to speak, while I was reading it. Then I was looking at some of the illuminated manuscripts, and I was kind of working with some of those. And I kind of liked what was happening there.
00:14:47.168 - 00:15:22.748, Speaker A: I may still use some of that, but really where I am right now is what about what I saw? And for, you know, it's a rare thing for me to do. I almost always work with appropriation. Now I'm kind of just trying to draw what I saw almost Ed Morolla style, you know, where you're just kind of not worrying about things too much, just blocking things in. And we're going to see a work in progress from Ed later in the tabs here. But all to say, it's very liberating if you never kind of work with your own imagination, so to speak, with. Or at least, you know. Cause it's kind of abstract and process oriented, what I do, and I like that.
00:15:22.748 - 00:15:43.612, Speaker A: But there's something to be said for just taking a blank page and just not needing anything but your own imagination and just going. And so that's kind of where I am with this right now. So we'll see what happens. But thank you for the interest and yes, hope to work on that today. Today is my art making day, so I go to speed. We only have an hour left here, so let's continue here. Score.
00:15:43.612 - 00:15:54.794, Speaker A: Thank you, Ed Psycho. Thank you so much for reviewing. I think it's pointy. I think that's a flower. I don't know how to pronounce that, though. It's a custom made frame. So infinite objects.
00:15:54.794 - 00:16:09.510, Speaker A: Who knew you could make custom made frames with infinite objects? I could send a design to infinite objects. That is incredibly cool. So learning as we go here. Crash. Stop. Kudos on giving Nicholas Dietrich some love. A great, great artist.
00:16:09.510 - 00:17:07.224, Speaker A: So of course this is Nicholas Dietrich, for those who are wondering who saw last show and Dekiriko, yes, you could make that comparison head and spotted that myself. But yes, and you know what's interesting about that, that was really on air that I made that discovery because I was talking about this, you know, being a canvas that I just literally feel like I could hold under my arm. And, you know, that just reminds me, the first association I have is, you know, the story of Max Ernst seemed to Chirico in a, you know, it's basically a storefront, storefront gallery in Paris and how that changed his life. And so that's the chain of association. But then mentioning de Chirico, looking at Nicholas Dietrich's work, all of a sudden it all starts to kind of ring, you know, if you were to, you could make the connections, the same enigmatic quality, the same ambiguity. Right? A similar poetry, we could say a similar visual poetry. So glad you see that too.
00:17:07.224 - 00:17:30.092, Speaker A: This is also very helpful, me putting out like a kind of view, let's say, or a loose outline of what's happening and then getting feedback on that. There is kind of a platonic dialectic. We kind of come, we move forward together here. So thank you for the comment there. Rosatio. This made me laugh so hard. People want their art discussed.
00:17:30.092 - 00:17:45.004, Speaker A: Maybe they don't want their art discussed from Jerry Celtius. I was kind of quick on that tab. I just kind of got over the whole. Yeah, but yes, I kind of agree with you. Yes, indeed. So, Gaspard ger, great to hear from you, everybody. Awesome to hear from you.
00:17:45.004 - 00:18:05.244, Speaker A: And also the comments on Twitter prismos, great to hear from you. Glad you're enjoying the show. Lord Neutron. I think we heard there was somewhere where Lord Neutron commented, which was awesome. So we heard from Lord wild artist who made this work here. And so that was super cool. Lily Illo, thank you for the comment.
00:18:05.244 - 00:18:18.448, Speaker A: Imitra's great content. I really like the Internet tour. You do. A beautiful way of putting it. By the way, I have found amazing artists and to continue to see their pieces. Thanks. Let's hope the tour survives this show here today.
00:18:18.448 - 00:18:59.632, Speaker A: So thank you and I'm glad and just very interesting way of putting it. Number one, thank you Nicholas Dietrich, the artist who started last show. Not to give too much away of the enigma, but your analysis is very astute. Adrian. Early 20th century painting is my foundation, so a little bit of confirmation here from the artist in terms of what may be happening. Kind of poetic inspiration perhaps from the early 20th century. It's really beautifully done and very subtle and easy to kind of miss without really just kind of taking some time and looking at Nicholas Dietrich's work just again, it just looks like art.
00:18:59.632 - 00:19:09.424, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. HJ. Amazing as always. Thank you. David. Amazing artist referring likely to Nicolas Dietrich here, indeed. Jan Lucas Magone Cool Journal, my friend.
00:19:09.424 - 00:19:33.464, Speaker A: I enjoyed so much and great to hear from you, Jan. And Jan has a huge following on x there. So great to hear from you. Thank you for the posts. Bulls thank you so much dear Adrian, for displaying my piece in today's show. Your show was the engine to start creating again. I was quite stuck with work stuff, but watching episodes of artist journal really brought back the drive and inspiration, so it feels like a complete circle and that is wonderful to hear as well.
00:19:33.464 - 00:19:49.522, Speaker A: Again, we are feeding back off each other, all of us here. So this is totally fun and totally cool and exciting. So I'm really glad to hear that. Human boy, great episode. Thank you. Luciana Guerra great to hear from you. Cedar Plankton thank you.
00:19:49.522 - 00:20:21.854, Speaker A: Pokebelly with regards to the one ETH equal one ETH debates, of course this is waffles from my short experience on foundation. This is definitely not the case. Couple of mints received handsome offers, but honestly, I've had higher secondary sales on Zora, 0% royalty though than any primary on foundation so far. Very interesting. And I think there was another maybe too much info, but just my experience, to be quite honest, it just makes me more excited about Zora. I'm pretty excited about Zora too. I think my next drop will likely be on Zora.
00:20:21.854 - 00:20:49.924, Speaker A: Put it this way, I have a drop that I'm getting ready for Zora. We'll see how it does, but just really, really interesting. And yeah, Zora is showing a lot of resilience, shall we say, and they keep just delivering to artists here. Great to hear from you cedar pink wife pink ape wife thank you for the comment and bosque. Gracias. We're so happy with the artist residency results. Can't wait to meet.
00:20:49.924 - 00:21:05.328, Speaker A: Indeed. That would be awesome. Neutro. Thank you so much, dear Adrian, for displaying the art residency at Bosque Gratias. The amount of knowledge and awesomeness being shared in there has been mind blowing. So again, this is powerful. Strano.
00:21:05.328 - 00:21:30.184, Speaker A: Hey pokebally, thanks for the feature. Just wanted to show you that the city that I've minted on Tezos was a bridge airdrop to the bidders of my five buildings on foundation last week. Check them out here. So thank you for that. When I looked at the Tezos work, I thought, this isn't what I remember on twitter. So this is more what I remembered, which was these kind of more animations here. So thank you for that, Strano, and thank you for just sharing that.
00:21:30.184 - 00:21:41.784, Speaker A: So very cool series here. Epic Tornado Rodriguez. I'm smiling so much after watching this. Thank you. And we have more from tornado. This show. Cider, amazing episode.
00:21:41.784 - 00:21:56.312, Speaker A: Love when you bring tweets for discussion on topics. Well, you're in luck, my friend. We're gonna have to speed through them, though, today because again, we. We're doing good, though. 54 minutes here to go, so thank you. Cider, awesome. And Rada, big fan.
00:21:56.312 - 00:22:05.888, Speaker A: I love it. I thought there was a. Yeah, there is another. I thought we had another. There we go. Lips in black. I was really surprised to find out there's so much interesting work.
00:22:05.888 - 00:22:25.550, Speaker A: Typically, I have your videos playing on my second monitor and listen to your podcasts while I draw. This is wonderful. But recently I found myself actually watching them attentively because there are so many cool pieces. Thanks a lot, mate, for doing all these reviews. Well, I'm glad you're appreciating it. And again, it's very interesting. Like, in it kind of.
00:22:25.550 - 00:23:12.430, Speaker A: This is what I associate with this. Like, when you're reading Socrates and Plato, often the interlocutor or the person that, let's say, Socrates is in dialogue with, they're kind of criticized as yes, people who are saying yes to Socrates and just agreeing. But what's interesting about it is that's kind of a confirmation. Like, there's a reason that that's in there. So the reason I mentioned this is because us going back and forth and even getting the confirmation, for me, we're in qualitative matters here. This is not math or science, as I always say, or physics. So it's very interesting on a qualitative level for people to have for this to resonate, because it suggests that we're kind of coming across to a kind of knowledge of sorts.
00:23:12.430 - 00:23:36.466, Speaker A: I say very loosely here and quickly before my intern, before my computer crashes again. Rata this is very interesting too. And sells may be a fraction of what sales may be a fraction of what they used to be. And it's still amazing to have collectors and people who resonate with your work. Love that view, Adrian. Keep fighting the good fight. So indeed, exactly.
00:23:36.466 - 00:23:56.690, Speaker A: As I always say here, it's just, you know, talk to your artists in the contemporary art world. Some do. Fabulous. You know, I just discovered an artist next show. It should be awesome. I may start with that person from the contemporary art world. I rarely start with physicals on this show, but there is a fabulous, just a teaser here of what's coming new discovery for me.
00:23:56.690 - 00:24:12.150, Speaker A: So. But all to say, there's a lot of art out there. So if you're selling it, that's a good day. So glad to hear that, Radda and awesome to hear from you as ever. Ilya blizznets thank you for the review, Clint. We should be grateful to have sold any digital art at all. So I guess that resonated.
00:24:12.150 - 00:24:30.564, Speaker A: That is interesting. And ffmec, that's beautiful, sir. Thanks for the presence on the space. Long live. Yes, it's not built on the shoulders of giants. It's built on the dreams of artists. Indeed, this show, again, it's not because some, you know, higher up is nobody needed this show to happen.
00:24:30.564 - 00:24:53.976, Speaker A: It's literally just like individuals kind of liking it and deciding that they want to interact with it and show it and share it. And that's exciting. That's what I love about this show. It really is built on the dreams of artists rather than, you know, getting so and so. I got the job, you know. You know, so it's beautiful. So we talked about this.
00:24:53.976 - 00:25:27.396, Speaker A: I wanted to make sure we hit Strano and we talked about Nicholas Dietrich. We saw Nicholas Dietrich's comment there, Robnis V three. So of course, Bitcoin is once again looking like it's going to potentially break. It actually broke the previous record at $69,000. The ETF, interestingly, seems to have legitimized, to a certain degree, the crypto, in a way that it's never been legitimized before. In a sense, you're getting major social proof. There is a blackrock ETF now, right? And there are several others.
00:25:27.396 - 00:26:06.556, Speaker A: But the fact that you're getting the capitalist system, you're getting basically social proof from arguably the largest players in the capitalist western capitalist system and that who largely control the narrative. And let's not go too far on that, whatever that means. But let's look at Robnis v. Three within this context here. A $16 million cryptopunk is actually not even news right now. So, of course, a crypto punk sold for $16 million. But this is, bitcoin is about to break an entire civilizational concept of a past economic world.
00:26:06.556 - 00:27:01.054, Speaker A: And this is the huge question, right? And if that's the case, again, it's kind of back to this earlier idea. What if. If that's the case, if, you know, if this kind of. If this world actually does happen, you know, it kind of brings back to what we're doing here as artists, you know, working on the blockchain. It brings it back to, like, where would you rather be right now as an artist? As I was thinking to myself, like, where would you rather be than here in this kind of blockchain world as it's exploding? And potentially, if, you know, Robnis V. Three is right here with a big picture, if we're, in fact, on the verge of an entirely new concept here of money to break an entire civilizational concept of a past economic world, a new paradigm, there's more important matters here. Sorry, punkaroos.
00:27:01.054 - 00:27:28.154, Speaker A: So just an interesting big picture statement. So, Jacob from Zora, you can now imagine with AI on Zora. So of course they had. We're almost seeing this like we've seen base. I think it's mint fun, if I'm not mistaken, has a canvas. We have object 98 on the object platform, and of course, we've had the one on Zora. Now they're incorporating AI into their native image maker.
00:27:28.154 - 00:27:50.646, Speaker A: So this includes built in splits for the AI model itself and the host of the model, and it sounds pretty advanced. If you're interested in creating your own models, AI models, or integrating yours into Zora, let me know. More to come. This is impressive. This doesn't sound like some 25 cent AI maker. Like, this actually sounds pretty impressive. Zach, who's on the show yesterday.
00:27:50.646 - 00:28:16.154, Speaker A: This is kind of crazy. Still wrapping my hand around AI image generation directly in Zora using a model like SDXL. I think that's stable. Diffusion usually requires at least some barrier, either technical know how to run it locally or a subscription to use it on a service site. The inference by Falai data is super fast. If you've ever prompted with stability AI, you'll know exactly what to do. If you've never used that's stable diffusion before, you'll figure it out quickly.
00:28:16.154 - 00:28:33.014, Speaker A: It just works. To quote Steve Jobs there, it just works. And then you can just mint it. A big deal. So very interesting. And again, let's send out our prayers here to the Internet gods or to the computer gods. I may need a new computer.
00:28:33.014 - 00:29:02.214, Speaker A: We may need to do a fundraiser here. Let's see. I'll try and give it a good, clean kind of do over. Give the computer a do over this weekend. Who has time for that? That's a day of your life, by the way, each time you use a prompt to create an image in the new Zora generative AI tool, it creates a new layer, so you can create several, resize them, paint over, upload your own images and backgrounds, add text, add other nfts and so on. I'll do a demo soon, but it's very intuitive. This is wild.
00:29:02.214 - 00:29:25.774, Speaker A: It's a sampler almost. I mean, you can take another song and you can start to remix it on the spot. Really cool. I mean, what's beautiful about Zora, too, is you can send anybody there. They don't need to have crypto. All they need is a metamask. You know, learn metamask, which is a couple of YouTube videos and a bit of a paradigm shift, but you don't need crypto to start on Zora.
00:29:25.774 - 00:29:53.618, Speaker A: So you can make the image, you can mint it, and you don't even need crypto. And then eventually, hopefully, you sell some of these works and you start accumulating. So it's kind of interesting. So here now, I think this was. I thought this was exactly Nick from Gamma IO, of course, which is, I believe, ordinals on bitcoin. Of course, trigamma is home to artists, but also to creators and communities of all kinds. Shockingly easy to launch.
00:29:53.618 - 00:30:17.000, Speaker A: But Brett will give you the vip treatment if you need help. And the mint flows are like butter every time. So here. Want to launch your own ordinals collection? Launching your ordinals mint on Gamma IO is so easy. And the mint, the best on BTC. Ready where you are. No need to wait, no contracts to sign if you are art ready, and if you have your art ready and a bitcoin wallet, you're good to go.
00:30:17.000 - 00:30:52.694, Speaker A: And, of course, the benefit of Gamma IO is it's a lazy mint. In other words, for those that don't know what that is, is the collector pays for the minting, not the artist, because that is a huge stumbling block, especially for artists around the world. Maybe they don't have any. It's kind of back to if you have no crypto, you know, this is probably a way to do it. Or at least you start on Zora and then you make your way over and you have an ordinals collection within a few weeks here. Our deployment takes less than five minutes, and I'm here to help at all times. How to launch, see my YouTube tutorial and dm me.
00:30:52.694 - 00:31:11.502, Speaker A: So some alpha there here. If you want to get started on ordinals, this is a very low cost entry here. Number one rule of sales, marketing, and life. So this is important, too. And of course, this is Nick from Gamma IO. As we continue to sprint here, we have 45 minutes. Everything is a funnel.
00:31:11.502 - 00:31:51.952, Speaker A: Everything you don't put right in front of people's faces. Add steps to that funnel, which results in exponential declines away from your intended outcome. The number one issue I see nonstop, put your link to your sales mint page everywhere, referring to artists. It should be underneath every single tweet. Maybe an exaggeration, but every work that you post, put the link, and I can't tell you how many times I've found works on, on x and I don't know the link. And, and exactly to Nick's point here, am I gonna go to the profile? Am I gonna start looking through the link tree, trying to figure out which link tree to press on when I got, you know, when I'm trying to finish this show at a certain time and. Right.
00:31:51.952 - 00:32:12.644, Speaker A: So there's a lot of wisdom in what Nick is saying. Reduce the barriers, the friction. It should be in your profile as the only link or the first link in your link tree. Right. And even link tree itself is arguably a kind of barrier as the sun shines here. Nice. And I'm going very early today just to get this done.
00:32:12.644 - 00:32:42.130, Speaker A: It should be in your pinned tweet, right, on the surface level. Don't make people tap to reveal it. Assume that if somebody can't find your link within 3 seconds, and ideally without tapping a second time to expose the link, they will just walk away and won't buy. Even if that isn't the case, it's better to assume it is. Also evaluate what other steps can be removed entirely. One less tap is one less conversion point. True wisdom here in the funnel and one less point where you'll lose the then majority of people in your funnel.
00:32:42.130 - 00:33:17.216, Speaker A: Everything is a funnel. Very interesting point here from Nick. And here, just really quickly, Nick also saying, once more, experimental game theory and mechanics. Imagine where you had two buttons for the mint, one on one side, one on the other, and then you got different outcomes based on that. So just a cool idea there. Funnyguys ETH hearing some chatter about art on tezos not being a store of value would be super helpful if these people can point me to the motivated sellers of the following collection pieces. Mono grids by Eisen Dorf small size I've actually never heard.
00:33:17.216 - 00:33:37.536, Speaker A: I think I've heard of Ace. I think it's Kim Acendorf, isn't it? But I've actually never heard of any of these collections. But they could be because it's generative. That is not the point, though. There is a ton of great art, and let's hope it's all worth something. Otherwise could be catastrophic for all of us. But why wouldn't.
00:33:37.536 - 00:33:47.402, Speaker A: Yeah, it's kind of a. Maybe we didn't even need that tweet because it's kind of obvious that it's worth something. I think so. We think so. We think. This is what I was talking about earlier with Ed Marolla. Work in progress.
00:33:47.402 - 00:34:17.368, Speaker A: Still work in progress. You know, I can really relate to this now because this is how you start with really rough. You start to block things in and it's a very fun way to work. So all to say, I really related with Ed's work in progress here. And even, you know, this is actually a pretty useful thing to do as well. For those that are kind of at the start of their journey or just learning or having trouble getting started, it's nice to put a nice background like this, like a yellow or orange. That's what the academic painters used to do.
00:34:17.368 - 00:34:42.540, Speaker A: And it kind of just sets a surface. And also you can even start using white on top. So all to say, just very cool there. Interesting movements. We've been talking about how the institutions now we're kind of back to Robnis v three's tweet there of the social proof, you know, this ETF, you know. Yeah, it means something financially, but it's. I'm kind of more.
00:34:42.540 - 00:35:19.204, Speaker A: What does it mean symbolically? Right. What does it mean from, you know, a psychological perspective as a social proof perspective? Because all of a sudden one could argue with the ETF, the narrative has completely changed and it's legit. It's like bitcoin is legit. And now if you're a museum and you don't, you know, you kind of have to all of a sudden reevaluate your whole NFT crypto strategy here. So we saw the Musee d'aul say, I think, earlier this week now here. So Tezos is making you know, working with object one in Tazos. Now, here's more developments.
00:35:19.204 - 00:35:43.954, Speaker A: WAC lab season three is. Here we are. Museums welcomes 20 new cultural institutions set to redefine the art sector with the power of web3 technology. And here we see the Van Gogh Museum, a major institution. Palais de Tokyo. Domain ChambOrd that looks like a chateau, a castle. But there were some others, you know, even just Cleveland public Library.
00:35:43.954 - 00:36:06.630, Speaker A: This is interesting. And isn't this interesting? The Great Egyptian Museum, not sure where. The Kiev National Art Gallery. So we've seen all sorts of interesting. Van Gogh Museum in Palais de Tokyo. So all sorts of interesting. You know, if you're an institution, you have to kind of.
00:36:06.630 - 00:36:43.948, Speaker A: You have to start thinking about this again, and you're kind of forced. Even if you hate crypto, you're basically forced. Otherwise, there's this huge risk that you completely miss it, you know, that you get left behind on what's going on here. And I would say the resilience of this scene through the bear market, I think we'd still be going if Tezos was at. Still think we would still be here, right? So there is a resilience here. There's something going on over here in terms of this art scene and just the technology and everything. So here it is, the press release.
00:36:43.948 - 00:37:20.798, Speaker A: Van Gogh Museum in Palais de Tokyo join leading art institutions for we are museums, labs or WAC labs. Web three program. All right, we got a run here. Tezos foundation. After working closely to support artists from underrepresented communities, the Shaw Medici Arts Fund and the Tezos foundation have decided to wind down the partnership. So I didn't realize, I don't know too much, to be honest, about the Tezos foundation or that I think this is loosely associated, if not totally associated, with Cosimo de Medici. The unspent funds will be used for other art initiatives that grow and support the Tezos art community.
00:37:20.798 - 00:38:13.644, Speaker A: So, of course, all the artists weighed in. And what to do with this, with this unspent money, which is kind of hilarious and apparently something like up to a million dollars. Yeah. Somewhere in here it says there's up to million dollars. So everybody starts weighing in as to what to do with it. If I had to solve the problem, how to administer $1 million in support of the Tezos art community, I would probably try to set up a DaO initially guided by people I personally trust, such as these people, Diane Drube, Artnome, Mikol McCool, who have shown that they are in this because they're not here to line their pockets. Honestly, I think airdropping that money the way optimism just did, so here's Sabato for their creators would be more equitable than setting up another committee of institutional players.
00:38:13.644 - 00:38:35.434, Speaker A: And this really resonates with me. And I totally agree. I think it will lead the same discourse of gatekeeping that we've already been. We've been already having. Yes, we don't need more gatekeepers. We really don't. Why are we trying to reinstitute anybody? And that includes me or anyone? Okay, like, I completely agree with Sabato there.
00:38:35.434 - 00:39:03.528, Speaker A: And I think let's go here. Let's continue. And Estelle Flores. I've been working with Tezos since I've entered this space. All the airdrops I've received from other chains were because of something, sometimes two or three interactions. Tezos is the home of most of my work in nfTs, and I dare say Tezos is the most popular chain for artists in the global south. I feel Tazos foundation have targeted, targeted us at some point and used our third world working drive when it made sense in their plan.
00:39:03.528 - 00:39:46.414, Speaker A: It has never been in their plan to defy the order of the traditional art market. You do get that sense, actually steering out of the european axis, for example. We even saw that in the Taschen book and Sabato pointed that out quite clearly. It was very kind of North American Europe centric, wasn't it? Especially north american centric. It was also ETH centric, which is, you know, and so it almost becomes class centric because people necessarily in Argentina or Turkey couldn't necessarily mint on Ethereum when they're starting out. So there's almost a class issue, kind of hilariously. And you'd think in 2024 this stuff would be thought of ahead of time from the likes of Tashin.
00:39:46.414 - 00:40:29.854, Speaker A: But anyway, let's not get off topic here. Or to reward who is responsible, responsible for most activations on their chain. Us Tezos would never have been remotely relevant if it wasn't for us artists too poor to mint on ETH. Now that there's a plethora of rewarding options out there, don't expect us to stay where we clearly don't feel seen. And this is an important point, I think, which is there are more options now than there were two years ago when kind of Tezos was seen as a thing. Like, I'd argue the most stickiest thing about Tezos is actually not Tezos, but object, the object website. Because there's followers, there's notifications, it's such a good website, like if there was never an object and it was only tea.
00:40:29.854 - 00:41:02.964, Speaker A: In the earlier phase when they hadn't sorted out the infinite scroll properly and it kind of crashed your computer every time you loaded it. At least for me, I'm not sure Tezos would be as popular. So I'll just say something to not take for granted. Sabato, again, after the whole optimism airdrop, it's been pretty clear that Tezos is run by playboys who are obsessed with race cars and celebrities. We're just bullet points for them. Platforms and community are great, but they don't actually need tazos. So, yeah, the artists don't actually need tezos.
00:41:02.964 - 00:42:02.728, Speaker A: And so you've already seen with Zora. You know, all of a sudden, I would argue Zora is competition for object and Tezos in a very real way, you're seeing it in the arc. And I need to speed up here so that this, for many reasons, we haven't even got to the art yet and we have 35 minutes to go here. So actually maybe 45, maybe 40, 40 minutes to go here. So all to say an optimism, there's something to be said, like if I don't know what the main optimism marketplaces, NFT marketplace, they should kind of advertise it, frankly. But whatever it is, you're sort of a little bit more sympathetic to using it after they give you a big airdrop. Right? So all to say, yeah, I wouldn't take, if I was Tezos, I wouldn't be taking things for granted too much is sort of my take on it.
00:42:02.728 - 00:42:48.450, Speaker A: Again, I agree with all these sentiments out here. Santiago Ruao learn from Solana and optimism, who reward artists who've been creating and interacting with their applications for a long time. I have been in Tezos for three years or more and never generated a stimulus for their creators. If this continues like this, everyone will simply leave Tezos. So, you know, don't underestimate the power of soft power. Sometimes it gets underestimated and there's a lot of soft power in saying, hey, thank you for helping make this, you know, blockchain what it is today. You know, in many, in large respects, which is half the reason maybe these institutions want to work with us because of the thriving art scene, you know, maybe something to not be taken for granted working class.
00:42:48.450 - 00:43:08.334, Speaker A: I'm tired of being poured and not being valued as I deserve. So, you know, I think a walk, you know, Tezos artist meme. We'll see if this loads up. I think I have major computer problems here. It stopped again. Luckily, I stopped it before it completely crashed. And so we're going to take.
00:43:08.334 - 00:43:35.350, Speaker A: Make another attempt here before it just stops recording again. So let's continue here. So, Dan, control. Dan control. And with a gorgeous, poetic, ambiguous work here, you have to actually absolutely love this. There is a. What looks like a lion or a panther or a dog with a princess head, maybe.
00:43:35.350 - 00:43:55.784, Speaker A: And here's the princess. And there is the castle. So another medieval scene. It kind of looks like it's from a story, but you don't recognize the story. At least I don't. And then there's this kind of interesting, almost like Renaissance saints in the sky here with this interesting tree. It's quite beautiful.
00:43:55.784 - 00:44:31.476, Speaker A: And again, the ambiguity equals poetry here, which I think is super. So I'm loving the complexity, I'm loving the ambiguity. This is not straightforward digital art, is it? So that is super cool. Here's another piece, vape away. So this was a one of one that Dan, I think, sold for 250 tezos. What I love about it, we've talked about this reuse, reusing elements. I mean, these are all, I believe, elements from previous works.
00:44:31.476 - 00:45:01.584, Speaker A: We see the vape, we see the shoe, we see the ladder, we see the cold storage wallet, we see the pan, we see the smoke, and we even see the background reusing everything to make a new work and then selling it off here. And it's cool. And you could argue it's even extra significant because of what he's doing with all the reusing. So, vape away. 250 tezos. Nice sale. Here's Gozo with an awesome work.
00:45:01.584 - 00:45:46.900, Speaker A: The trick, indeed the trick. So beautiful. Another beautiful, you know, pixel art, not pixel art painting here, but kind of pixelated out and kind of on two levels. Interestingly, again, you see this kind of what looks like stable diffusion textures here, but you see there's the large pixels here, and you see there are very small pixels, perhaps, if you can see that. So it looks like it's been pixelated on two levels. Interestingly, maybe it's a little more obvious here. Like, in a sense, you get the big pixels or the feathers, but then in a really small way, it kind of has this, like, gif export kind of feel to it, you know, 256 color export.
00:45:46.900 - 00:46:20.348, Speaker A: So double pixelation here, beautiful color, interesting composition. So again, digital collage and AI, I believe, and painting digital collage by Gozo, 2024. That is 1274. There are two left on object. Martin Bruce, fly vision with a wild work here again. And here again, you see what looks like maybe a fly or a butterfly and just a rainbow brushstroke here. And just more ambiguity, more poeticness.
00:46:20.348 - 00:46:41.464, Speaker A: And you even see this interesting frame in the background, but none at the bottom. Upsetting expectations. And then you get, again, this interesting kind of sampled brushstroke done in just very unusual ways. Total innovator here. Super interesting. Fly vision. This is ten tezos and four Argonne edition of eleven.
00:46:41.464 - 00:47:04.682, Speaker A: Healthy market out here. Do you know temple on the wall? I missed this one from a couple of weeks ago. This is from Martin Bruce, also January 29. Actually, that's a month ago. And look at this. I guess it was while Martin Bruce was hanging up his exhibition. Kind of looks like an exhibition space with a laptop, with a massive laptop in it, with images in it.
00:47:04.682 - 00:47:31.712, Speaker A: Again, totally irrational composition. Hard to make out what's going on. Let's call it totally ambiguous. And then this beautiful kind of audio visual noise kind of run through the video processor in a beautiful way. Kind of slightly, again, kind of like that Gif export, like that 256 color export style walls and floors. Real exhibition coming soon. Dino Temple on the wall.
00:47:31.712 - 00:47:58.120, Speaker A: Six tezos, edition of 20. How many are left? This looks almost gone. Five left. Very interesting works here from rustic digital art. And this is edition of ten. So taking a game Boy package, Pokemon, gotta catch them all. And substituting the image, maybe this was like a monster or whatever, and just completely turning it into rustics own kind of artwork here.
00:47:58.120 - 00:48:22.790, Speaker A: So here's the blue version. Link with red version to catch all 150 Pokemon. Here's the red version. So kind of a wild work, almost punning. I assume this is all real, you know, was actually on the Pokemon, on the Pokemon packaging. And here you see the Marios kind of intervening here in this game Boy packaging. And this Pokemon.
00:48:22.790 - 00:48:53.460, Speaker A: So a pretty cool series here. 420 each from rustic digital art. Also another strange one here. This is kind of maybe a japanese title here. And again, substituting the main content of the video game packaging with, you know, art or with something else that has been put inside of it in the subject. This again, kind of out of focus imagery here. Super game Boy.
00:48:53.460 - 00:49:12.152, Speaker A: You know, linking together here, more wild, wild work. Ambiguous. This one looks like it was burned, interestingly. And here's another one. Rooster. So again, we're playing with the Marios here. And this interesting kind of abstract style here.
00:49:12.152 - 00:49:38.934, Speaker A: And the different colored Marios. I'm checking the clock here because I do have to stop this video in ten minutes and then restart it. It has been a total nightmare, this whole technical issue. I'm gonna have to, I think I'm gonna take off Friday, actually, just to work on it because I can't, I can't do this again like this. We have to, we have to repair the ship. We have to repair the ship. Rooster edition of three and so 420 each.
00:49:38.934 - 00:49:57.296, Speaker A: Cool work. And here's another one that pairs nicely with it. Flowers. And here again, we get the same kind of Super Marios and put into this kind of interesting abstract composition. Here is another one. This is Santiago. This was just posted on Twitter.
00:49:57.296 - 00:50:25.808, Speaker A: So interesting comment there. And as you see, kind of combining AI with Santiago's Twitter feed or, sorry, with his abstract style here. Forgive me, I have a lot of things going on here. And just a couple more minutes here before. Let's keep going here inside Ronald McDonald's wig closet. So this is awesome. Kind of reminds me of in the capitoline museum, there are all these busts.
00:50:25.808 - 00:50:47.360, Speaker A: This is, you know, but it's actually not that something. So this is a wig closet. So here are Ronald McDonald's different wigs. In the capitoline museum in Rome, you'll find rooms like three or four, five, six rooms. And it's just filled with busts of like, Homer, Socrates, everybody. So pretty interesting. It kind of reminds me of that.
00:50:47.360 - 00:51:06.230, Speaker A: But this is just a few wigs. Cool composition there, too. Here's Guillaume Corneille Favola, number 16. So I believe those are kind of poor neighborhoods in Brazil, if I'm not mistaken. So cool. This is a physical, pretty sure by Guillaume Corneille. Beautiful.
00:51:06.230 - 00:51:30.970, Speaker A: Kind of where's Waldo style, isn't it? And we see that also with Ezra Eslin, who we're going to see in a second here. And this is an addition. This was burned, so there may be a newer version of this. And here's Ezra Eslin. Very interesting piece. Me, love me. And kind of deceptive piece here, because all of a sudden, if you look closer, you realize this is all the same person, and you start to wonder what's going on here.
00:51:30.970 - 00:52:20.334, Speaker A: This person is looking on. It's like, is this kind of a dream of sorts? Is this a multiple personality? There seems to be something kind of psychological and potentially kind of hallucinatory and dreamlike going on here as the figure here is looking upon themselves and the murdered figure and so seemingly kind of a multiple personality thing at work. The angle helps kind of create more drama in the whole psychological situation here. And then, interestingly, just this kind of backdrop of a convenience store with this murder in front of it. This is an edition, and this was put out last week from Ezra Eslin. So beautiful work there. How are we doing here? And just a couple of more before we take another break here.
00:52:20.334 - 00:52:44.280, Speaker A: Glitching rainbow. After the rainbow. So this is Jake Studios. This is an edition of one for 111 tezos. And as you see here, there is the rainbow and the hard drive is working. And there, interestingly, green clouds in the background and everything kind of looks like they're in a pool here, kind of. Again, more ambiguity.
00:52:44.280 - 00:53:06.520, Speaker A: I love the ambiguity. The ambiguity makes it more like. It makes it more poetic. It makes it more. Again, ambiguity in a lot of ways, equals art to a large degree. Multiple meanings. When you look at Shakespeare, you know, punning and the multiple levels of meaning, that's what we're dealing with, with ambiguity, multiple levels of meaning.
00:53:06.520 - 00:53:28.292, Speaker A: It can be read one way or another. It starts to become poetic. We start making associations. You start to work with rational and irrational. Incredibly powerful. So, you know, and this is to contrast it before the computer crashes again. This is to contrast it with didact, you know, with what my friend calls didactic art.
00:53:28.292 - 00:53:42.354, Speaker A: You know, art that's too obvious. It's got too obvious of a message. So there's something to be said about ambiguity and poetry. So again, a very ambiguous work here. And one couple more here. Swirly art. Let it go.
00:53:42.354 - 00:54:00.790, Speaker A: Interesting work here. I don't know if we've ever looked at this artist, but cool contrast here. Almost looks like a physical work with the purple. And you see the smoke that looks digital, kind of the soft smoke contrasting with the hard outlines here of this kind of skeleton figure. Letting it go. Some feelings must go. Let it go.
00:54:00.790 - 00:54:23.984, Speaker A: Frame by frame animation by swirly art edition of 20 for one tazos. And here's Ouyo 66. Again, another one of these 3d, kind of red and blue, 3d glass artworks. Kind of looks like a newspaper guy. And here's Morgan, the newsmaker. So, interesting piece. I kind of feel like there are some game mechanics of sorts here.
00:54:23.984 - 00:54:47.170, Speaker A: Not exactly sure that's a one of one went for 41 tezos. And here's Katarina create with. And we'll just do a few more from Katarina here. This is from a sloth. So here's the black and white sloth magazine. I think it's all in black and white, if I'm not mistaken. And so here, Caterina create, made an image there.
00:54:47.170 - 00:55:19.656, Speaker A: And you see flowers, basically, nature scenes, ice, melting rain, the dove, the sun, the clouds, the flowers. So a page from Sloth magazine, number 22. Just for three tazos 39 unique artworks from cool artists and here are just finally, as I wrap up here, some works from object 98. So using the old Microsoft paint program by Katerina create. This is a great one. I'm not sure if we looked at this. Interesting how she keeps the outline here in the parts that overlap.
00:55:19.656 - 00:55:32.476, Speaker A: The parts of the body that overlap. Like the leg here and everything. And the toes. Very cool. It looks great. Cool composition, pink paint body, daisy chakra. So this one's still available on primary for 250.
00:55:32.476 - 00:55:44.780, Speaker A: These look great. Daisy dress. Just very cool. So. And here's Jake studios. And apologies for the out of orderness. It is that kind of situation here.
00:55:44.780 - 00:56:01.382, Speaker A: So this should go over here. So there is a Jake studios work, as you see. And. Yeah, so here's just another one by Jake Studios. Continue. Almost like a video game type title here. And some clouds and some drones with eyeballs on them.
00:56:01.382 - 00:56:24.078, Speaker A: And a glitched out figure here with barbed wire of thorns. Seemingly six tezos edition of one. So at auction, maybe you can get it cheap. So let's pick up here in a second. All right. We are under heavy attack, but we will survive and we will press forward. Let's continue here with the great tornado Rodriguez with another awesome work.
00:56:24.078 - 00:56:42.190, Speaker A: I feel like I've seen this before, but it's because I have seen it before in previous versions of this episode. So here is Tornado Rodriguez. A hilarious work. More bad news. And in bed with coffee. And these kind of stuffed animal figures here. The big one eye and the spiked hair.
00:56:42.190 - 00:56:54.774, Speaker A: And just an awesome. There's Garfield on the wall, hilariously. And I love the more bad news. Can't we all relate to that? We hate Mondays. Hilarious. Ten edition of ten. Nice edition size, by the way.
00:56:54.774 - 00:57:14.834, Speaker A: Big fan of that edition. Size 222. Keeping it a low price and just selling out. And look at these beautiful secondary prices for tornado. Just awesome. Seba Sistaro is on exchange art here with another wild piece here. Stretching people out here in this super original composition.
00:57:14.834 - 00:57:30.844, Speaker A: Have you ever seen a figure displayed like this? I'm sure you haven't. So again, that is available on exchange art. What is the reserve here? The reserve is one sol. Wow. Saul is at $140. Incredible. Get your work on exchange.
00:57:30.844 - 00:57:43.104, Speaker A: Let's continue here. Daniel W. Great to see Daniel W. Again and again. Kind of like a face on a bird. I'm trying to think of where I've seen that. Almost feels like out of greek mythology here.
00:57:43.104 - 00:58:15.524, Speaker A: These little elements here. When you see the floor paneling, a little light socket here, even the window frame and even the wall. There's something to me kind of Magritte esque about it. Kind of focusing on these almost kind of latent qualities, these subconscious, these things that are so familiar to us that we don't even see them anymore. The visitor five Tezos edition of 14. And they are going, let's continue. And we may have to wait for some of these to load here.
00:58:15.524 - 00:58:37.772, Speaker A: Flash kiss, Francois Gamma. So interesting pieces by Francois Gamma here. As we see, it looks like two figures, the green and the purple one. And so that is edition of 70 for three tezos. So massive addition here. Here's another one, the kiss two, I think it's called kind of a loose or flash kiss. Flash kiss here.
00:58:37.772 - 00:58:51.010, Speaker A: So here are the two figures. And again, doing a fill on some of just very the interesting. And they come apart. Just very interesting treatment here. Let's continue. Slava three with a cool work. Dextra distortion.
00:58:51.010 - 00:59:21.624, Speaker A: The destructive power of digital distortion can break bones. This is 640 by 640 80 frames. Another work where I think Slava is using several softwares, or at least one or two in this work, and combining them, exporting Slava three. This is on Zora seven, minted so far. And here's the great popple with a new work. Yuka Morita sending the mutagen signal. And this is 800 by 800, a very nice size there edition of 25.
00:59:21.624 - 00:59:54.808, Speaker A: And here you see almost like a matrix, like ones and zeros again, kind of, you can see the combination here of like, what looks like generative art and the pixel art, static and, you know, dynamic, static and moving. And here, just these kind of, you know, blobby figures. You see something coming out of the alley here. I almost want to see like the popple, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. It's almost. But here's a sailor moon almost type figure you see in the outfit there. Interesting, Tokei.
00:59:54.808 - 01:00:14.326, Speaker A: So this is part two of this series here. This only went for 15 tezos on primary. Sold out. Get it if you can on secondary. There is another work by Popple just posted on X here. Just another one of these cool monsters with operating system window in the background. Super cool there.
01:00:14.326 - 01:00:36.874, Speaker A: And here is anus Abdin, Ethereum goddess. So this is from, I think, a couple of weeks ago. A week ago. So of course, Annas is putting out like he's giving himself a 24 hours time limit here. So here, homage to Ethereum and. Yeah, exactly. I started drawing at noon sharp because he wasn't sure he would be able to complete it in 24 hours.
01:00:36.874 - 01:00:57.072, Speaker A: So I started as soon as it hit midnight. It took me 9 hours to complete that's wild. Up all night, seemingly. And here's the Ethereum rock. This is at a reserve of 0.169. Also from Annus Abdin, the great pixel artist. We have a space that we did runtune and I a couple, few weeks ago.
01:00:57.072 - 01:01:14.824, Speaker A: I haven't uploaded it yet, though, but I will. It is downloaded, so now it will be uploaded soon to the Spotify. It's a great one, really experienced artist, actually. Anis Abdin. Here's Kulikkler Sahari. So this is a city and probably done. I asked actually, Anas if this is done from his mind.
01:01:14.824 - 01:01:40.084, Speaker A: A lot of these works, a lot of them are just done from his imagination. Kind of back to our earlier discussion as we're talking about, you know, Ed Marolla, me working on this Dante thing, kind of getting sick of the references that I had, which weren't getting what I wanted. I looked at William Blake, too, in here, over here in this beautiful green book. And there's. It's like, no, that's not what I saw. And so I was trying to do my own. So there's something to be said from drawing from the imagination.
01:01:40.084 - 01:02:07.128, Speaker A: So this is likely what's going on here with Annas Abdin. Let's continue. And here is Mech TxT restarted. That could be the name of this whole episode I. This odyssey of putting together this episode here, restarted. This is by Mec TXT. And it seems like whatever I erase from my computer, it doesn't matter.
01:02:07.128 - 01:02:24.314, Speaker A: Is kind of how it feels, which is a really strange situation here. So this is for the vending machine takeover. Really cool. Mechanical. Loading up his image on this, like, Crt monitor or old computer monitor. Super cool there. Here's Cedar plank, the awesome hastrubal waffles here.
01:02:24.314 - 01:02:49.594, Speaker A: Always exciting. You know, I was working on a work, and I was starting to see the hastrubal waffle influence. Me not worrying too much again, it's almost this back to drawing from the imagination. Not worrying too much about, you know, in a sense, getting the perfect representation, but really just kind of embracing what you're getting from what you're. From the mark making you're doing. Very fun way to work. And look at these great edges here.
01:02:49.594 - 01:03:00.470, Speaker A: So you have died of ennui. Game over. And I think it's crying. And I think maybe smoking a cigarette here. And these great vertical lines. Yeah. And then the skull with the cigarettes.
01:03:00.470 - 01:03:11.814, Speaker A: So hilarious. Super cool. Here is manital. Cool. Work on. Cool. Work on Zora.
01:03:11.814 - 01:03:44.084, Speaker A: Unusual meowing from the cats here. Cool. Kind of eight bit game soundtrack. You know, kind of a common thing we find with the pixel artists are these eight bit game soundtracks. Soundtracks which maybe is not unusual, maybe it makes sense, right? All kind of being inspired again, the second generation of, of digital art here. These artists who are inspired by computer games or from video games when they grew up, you know, there's something to be said for it, I think. Bob up.
01:03:44.084 - 01:04:04.300, Speaker A: This is on Zora 14, minted so far. And let's continue. My, you, epic real defender. So again, with my use colors here, just a cool pixel art piece. Love the checkerboard pattern in the background too. And this is an edition of ten, sold out at 250. Very reasonable price there.
01:04:04.300 - 01:04:33.868, Speaker A: And here's tomb and battle edition of 15, homesick, selling out at six tazos. Really cool piece of an astronaut coming back home at winter, maybe coming home for Christmas. And you gotta love the color, the kind of light blue color of the sky here, contrasting with this dark blue and even yellow, you know, complementary color. Very cool. I always need to review my complementary colors. I think it's blue and yellow because it's orange and green. Or is it red and green? I need to.
01:04:33.868 - 01:05:01.832, Speaker A: It's red and green, orange and blue, yellow and violet. Okay, so that's another thing actually, as far as complementary colors, when you can also, one of the techniques you can do is go across, do the complementary color, and then one to the left or one to the right. And often you get a great color combination. Interestingly, homesick. Cool title, cool work. Shout out to Tom Bombadil. Here's green ginger with a super interesting piece.
01:05:01.832 - 01:05:36.708, Speaker A: Again, you got that eight bit soundtrack, kind of techie, nice. Forward to the floor. Kind of clouds here, trans dimensional through way. This is green Ginger with Kruger, maybe Kruger did the music here then. And of course, green ginger is a duo, so a few people on this work awesomely. Here's element li. Of course, this had an interesting title, berg, which I think a berg.
01:05:36.708 - 01:06:00.906, Speaker A: Berg is a mountain, I think in German, if I'm not mistaken. Now, here we have what looks like a princess that's locked in a castle. Maybe that's the mountain in the background. Or maybe it means something completely different. Kind of looks medieval from. It's like, here's the medieval light fixture here, or a lamp. Isn't that interesting? And a little bit of light coming on this outline here.
01:06:00.906 - 01:06:20.950, Speaker A: Another just beautiful, minimal experimental work by element lead. 200 pixels by 200 pixels. Let's keep running here. Svezer diamond eyes. More experimental pixel art here. So here you see a diamond and the owl's head here, kind of flashing. Interesting animation here.
01:06:20.950 - 01:06:33.006, Speaker A: Just looks like a two frame animation. Maybe three. Very interesting work. This is three tezos edition of ten four. Argonne Sabato picking one up. The Commodore exponential design. Very interesting.
01:06:33.006 - 01:06:50.554, Speaker A: It's just cool. Ambiguous art here. Today we're seeing a lot of it, which I find super bullish. Chaz, 1942. So again, looks like a world war two game on an old computer. Just awesome. And there's the coffee, there's the office.
01:06:50.554 - 01:07:08.844, Speaker A: There's all your DVD's, maybe hilarious. And a few pictures on the wall. Love it. 1942, selling out at 250. And here is Winnie the opps. So, again, referring to these airdrops here. We have a celebration from Burr sector here.
01:07:08.844 - 01:07:22.560, Speaker A: Bossque grazias. At the boss que gratias workshop. There's the optimism logo. And there, Winnie the Pooh, enjoying money falling from the sky. You gotta love it. You have to love it. Time skip.
01:07:22.560 - 01:07:40.768, Speaker A: This is Glitchtown arcade. Very nice piece here. This was, I think, given as a bonus to collectors. You gotta love the huge pixels, don't you like this is beautiful. So great work here from Glitchtown Arcade. Again, those massive pixels. You just have to love it.
01:07:40.768 - 01:07:56.192, Speaker A: Beautiful. 32 tezos on secondary. Nice reward. Pamela Cerrone. This is pretty cool. Two plast, one l, one classic. Pamelo Cerrone here, with just these eyes going through, having fun as usual.
01:07:56.192 - 01:08:15.548, Speaker A: And continuing on, here's Rannix deer with a gorgeous work here with these colors. Orange and pink and fading off into black, with a little light pink at the bottom. Just beautiful. And here's another one. This is actually the full work. So interestingly, that is the. It's like a painting in a painting.
01:08:15.548 - 01:08:37.186, Speaker A: There is a meta here with this kind of CGI type experimental gallery setting. You even see the painting here, reflecting off the bottom. Nightfall is the title. And once all har 40 tezos now as we speak. And let's just see if we can make that larger. So, very cool work here. On exchange art from Ranix Tier.
01:08:37.186 - 01:08:52.266, Speaker A: Here's another one. I'm not sure. We may have seen this one, but you see it in the larger. I think we saw just the square, but not in this kind of experimental gallery. Deep sea cool work there. Another sphere on Zora. Interestingly, not from Zora.
01:08:52.266 - 01:09:12.104, Speaker A: This is Lyudmila Pandolfo 460. Minted, so. But a beautiful work, as you see here. Kind of has a paper feeling to it. Almost a physical texture feeling to it, as well as even in the color looks printed, doesn't it very cool. That's on Zora. And here's Fornax void.
01:09:12.104 - 01:09:40.223, Speaker A: And of course, the music's going to be awesome. Kind of more video game, eight bit music. I think Fornix Void has an album. And hearing all this music, I want to check it out. Look at this. As you see here, music arrangement based on an old Midi file from the 1990s. That is awesome.
01:09:40.223 - 01:10:06.340, Speaker A: Created by Anthony Peters on a soundman wave card, slightly changed, found on angelfire. So some vintage Internet lore there. Internet files. Nicholas Sassoon. Check this out. So usually with Nicholas Sassoon, we see what I'd call abstract animated abstract here are rare, at least for me. Landscape, from what I've seen.
01:10:06.340 - 01:10:49.440, Speaker A: An interesting kind of almost torn, almost looks like a kind of frayed physical textile piece, interestingly. And then you just see these kind of cycling colors through this beautiful landscape here. Almost a Mona Lisa esque landscape, you know, a close up of a Mona Lisa, of the Mona Lisa background there. Here is Pixelfool with a pretty cool series here, check this out. So this is done with foundation's exhibition. Exhibition, you know, initiative, shall we say. So I'm not sure if pixel fool did that themselves or how that works, if anybody can do it.
01:10:49.440 - 01:11:08.934, Speaker A: But here is one of the works going for a one of one for ETH 1.11 ETH. So not cheap. Pretty cool work, though, from pixel fool. Great animated abstract pixel artwork. Here is an additional 0.05 ETH and zero minted, surprisingly.
01:11:08.934 - 01:11:27.050, Speaker A: And here you see these beautiful works just falling. Just another cool animated abstract. I'm going to keep running here in case we have massive computer problems. Loac me perpetual. So this is, I think, older. April 4, 2023. This just showed up in the Twitter feed.
01:11:27.050 - 01:11:57.104, Speaker A: And quite interesting, though, isn't it, in terms of just an animated abstract could really work well in the same show as the pixel fool works we just saw. So this is Loac me, I think, a pretty classic, you know, Tezos object artist. Now, unfortunately, hopefully, this doesn't become. Okay, good. Unfortunately, whatever was here before, I wonder if it was Lucas Le Jeune. So this has been the. I've had some tough episodes to record.
01:11:57.104 - 01:12:11.700, Speaker A: This has been easily the toughest. It wasn't. Maybe it was a Lucas legend that was on. Maybe we'll still see the work I was thinking of. But there were some works here. Here's Lucas legend. Okay, good.
01:12:11.700 - 01:12:37.748, Speaker A: So not sure what was in that. Sometimes when I reload up object, I'll just get object.com rather than the original work that I had there it's that kind of day, that kind of 48 hours, actually. Anyways, let's continue here, continue sailing forward despite the weather and the stormy seas and the attacks. Lucas Lejeune. So very cool. Kind of vectorish, animated abstract here.
01:12:37.748 - 01:13:01.454, Speaker A: Just kind of really wild. And this is the work I was thinking of that was Psycho Futurist 990 edition of ten. Is that now, is that on primary? That is on secondary. So pretty cool work here, isn't it? Pretty ambitious. Lot going on. Cool. Kind of flashing going on with the figure here that's crouching.
01:13:01.454 - 01:13:19.294, Speaker A: Just really cool. Ambitious, rad work. I feel this every morning when I have huivos rancheros. Hilarious and continuing. Demon ego. Some cats on the way for a special exhibition. And so playing with some cats here, and looking like playing with some AI as well.
01:13:19.294 - 01:13:46.430, Speaker A: So, of course, demon ego, incorporating everything. A huge exporter as well, a huge combiner of different softwares. And there you see some AI, I think, incorporated into the mix of those notebooks. Composition 155. This is Klaus with some more compositions here, more abstract. One of ones, that's 23 tezos on primary. And here's another 121 tezos on primary.
01:13:46.430 - 01:14:08.418, Speaker A: A one of one, composition 154. So I am letting these load up as I go through the page, because maybe that will take less memory, I'm hoping. Here. Minoze, this is Renki. So, yes, forgive the technical difficulties on this one. Just to get this show out is gonna be a complete miracle. And it shouldn't be.
01:14:08.418 - 01:14:21.734, Speaker A: It should be. Hit the button. Go and hit stop. All to say, Renki, with more cool work. Love the color on this. This beautiful gradient, too. And just, you know, geometric abstraction, I suppose one could call it.
01:14:21.734 - 01:15:02.770, Speaker A: We have a wonderful work here by Zozo. Again, ambiguity, poetry. Don't know what's going on. Totally wild. You know what I love about this? It's avant garde in the way that it would be in a contemporary art gallery. But when I go to a contemporary art gallery or even contemporary art museum, often you'll see works that are ambiguous, that you don't understand, but you get bored. This is not boring.
01:15:02.770 - 01:15:31.658, Speaker A: I kind of just want to keep myself aesthetically. It's keeping me interested and hooked. And the music is great. It keeps me hooked. It keeps me interested. That's pretty cool, that is, you know, again, like, then you're starting to be in the area of the avant garde, where it's like, why is this keeping me interested? Because, of course, when you're in these contemporary art museums, oftentimes you're not interested in at least me personally. So this is really interesting.
01:15:31.658 - 01:16:05.068, Speaker A: Zozo frequency. Three tazos. Again, more poetry, more complexity. Right? Again, remember the Dan control that we're starting out with here in the works. Here's Kurt Hussle collective. This is a full on, like, legitimate. You know, we already knew it was a legitimate art scene, but really, you could curate a brilliant show here using these works like this, these empty hallways, and put it in a contemporary art museum and it would work.
01:16:05.068 - 01:16:31.764, Speaker A: And I don't. My point is, I'm not sure people would know the difference, that this came from the blockchain. And it's way more interesting, at least for me, speaking for myself. Like, I love the subject matter. The elevators. It's like a subway platform, empty. And again, just killer music.
01:16:31.764 - 01:16:42.080, Speaker A: So I'm getting excited here. Sector nine, part three. Only three tazos. Kurt Hussle collective. Turning heads. Last portrait of summer. So this is bosque Gratias.
01:16:42.080 - 01:17:09.924, Speaker A: This is another. Again, another very interesting work that you can just imagine at the contemporary art museum. Maybe someone walking through water. And you gotta love the frame here. Almost a CRT monitor frame, if I'm not mistaken. So cool work there. That's bosque.
01:17:09.924 - 01:17:29.552, Speaker A: Grazias. Five tazos, summer self portrait. And here's inivare. Just a close up of some lips speaking and you see all the power of this analog video glitch process. Endless remixing you can do here. This was posted in the community by ad. This is someone called Roman Dritz.
01:17:29.552 - 01:17:48.316, Speaker A: Le la opais du carrousel by Roman Dritz. So cool work here. Just a cool photo. I'm not sure if this is on the blockchain or where it came from, but cool. Moody photo. Thank you. Ad doctor version with a beautiful still here.
01:17:48.316 - 01:18:02.172, Speaker A: Kind of looks like a beautiful painting. I. You know, this almost looks like canvas on the outer side. And the. It's. It even looks painted the way like you almost see, like, brushstrokes going across here. A beautiful work here.
01:18:02.172 - 01:18:22.844, Speaker A: A beautiful still. I had to highlight that one. Continuing on, blue skunk. So a couple of works by walk here. And as you see here, again, taking the noise process to the next level here. Blue skunk. And here is another one, blue widow at auction.
01:18:22.844 - 01:18:41.196, Speaker A: Two tezos only for a one of one by wok. Pretty cool. And again, that very colorful noise. And let's continue here. Recycled material. This is Recano with a Coca Cola spiral spiraling out. So cool work there.
01:18:41.196 - 01:19:08.834, Speaker A: Kind of consumer goods. This is sold out at five tezos, each edition of five. And here's continuum number 194 by Koda Nakazono. And let's let that load up here. So interesting in the background here as I start getting that little scrolling. Yeah, the hard drive is working overtime here. I'm gonna have to take off tomorrow.
01:19:08.834 - 01:19:26.586, Speaker A: I've already decided Friday I'm off to fix this computer to see if I can fix this computer. Otherwise I may be starting a fundraiser here. Here's some spray paint and more spray paint. So interesting. 24 tezos on secondary. Selling out at 15 tezos on primary. Nice one.
01:19:26.586 - 01:19:52.638, Speaker A: Very nice. And continuing on, Ivan Hugo with a cool Glb here. Totally unusual. Again, look at the experimentation here. It almost looks like a canvas here too, doesn't it? So you gotta love, again, the ambiguity, the experimentation that's going on out here. Here's bosque grazias with Nico Alerchi. Another glb here.
01:19:52.638 - 01:20:07.678, Speaker A: Look at this tree. I've never seen a tree like this. This is awesome. BG Koihu, the biggest tree edition of two. And I think one sent to bosque. And then here's another one. You're in bosque gratia.
01:20:07.678 - 01:20:23.574, Speaker A: So this is hilarious. So here is, I think, the Bosque gratias residency area. Maybe that's where people eat over here. So, enjoying the good life in Argentina. This one was burned, so maybe there are a. There is a different version. Here's a mother house.
01:20:23.574 - 01:20:44.604, Speaker A: You're in Bosque Grazia. This is an addition of 100. So looking like quite an elaborate setup there. Pretty cool GLB. And continuing on, here's the childhood in Kaza Chica. So just very, very cool. So the cool Glb's here.
01:20:44.604 - 01:21:14.048, Speaker A: And continuing on, what is next here? This is pretty cool. As we go into the AI. This is kanoxapata. And it almost looks like those GLB files, doesn't it? It almost looks like those GLB files with these, you know, that have been used as source files. Potentially. Super interesting, I guess an AI artwork. Just a generated landscape, whatever that means.
01:21:14.048 - 01:21:28.932, Speaker A: Super interesting experimental artist. Let's continue as I. Freeze. So let's see if we can get to the end of this episode without crashing the computer here. Kanig Zapata. Another super cool experiment here. It looks like an office.
01:21:28.932 - 01:21:45.228, Speaker A: Again, this is probably AI artwork. Just super original. Another Monday in the office. Continuing on, no hygiene. A beautiful work here. Beautiful experimental work with just this figure here. Interesting.
01:21:45.228 - 01:21:59.084, Speaker A: The fuzz contrasting nicely with the sharpness of the hair there. Cone. And that is no hygiene. Five tazos. Interesting title. Let's continue here. The hag by Skomra.
01:21:59.084 - 01:22:13.964, Speaker A: So continuing the abandoned buildings series. And here this is listed on object. Interesting. Kind of almost like drones in the sky there. So beautiful textures. And interesting portrayal of a building in the Hague. Stable diffusion textures.
01:22:13.964 - 01:22:30.854, Speaker A: Here's another one by Skammar. Check out that awesome arm, that AI distortion there that we learn to love and appreciate in these parts, in these parts of the Internet here. And these great. Nice little prism. So cool work from Skomra. Let's continue. Invisible.
01:22:30.854 - 01:22:45.830, Speaker A: This is Okote. This is pretty cool. I'm not sure if we looked at this one yesterday. There are a few with the phones. Another powerful, very powerful work here. Hey. And this beautiful kind of jungle scene in the background with parrots and everything.
01:22:45.830 - 01:23:02.838, Speaker A: Very cool. Selling out at 250 edition of ten. Nice work. Ok, here's another one. And kind of a similar idea, but. And it's almost like rather than guns, they have guitars here, which is pretty rad. And here we see the phones.
01:23:02.838 - 01:23:24.226, Speaker A: And again, this kind of really cool jungle scene in the background. Edition of twelve for 250. Katsapta picking one up. Here's strange thing with a really interesting piece. Each idea an artist conceives as a fingerprint. Unique and telling to use another's idea is to wear a mask of creativity, not owning it. And beautifully painted here, this drapery.
01:23:24.226 - 01:23:44.594, Speaker A: And again, the colors are just off the charts. It kind of has that luminescence of Raphael. And here making a strange thing, a self portrait perhaps of sorts, with this kind of Jesus figure in sonic the hedgehog kind of jogging gear. Not sure. All interesting over here. And cams of shame. This is pretty interesting.
01:23:44.594 - 01:24:09.122, Speaker A: This is by cello. We haven't seen from for a while here. Just interesting work with surveillance cameras. All surrounding this nude is three tezos edition of ten. Interesting piece. And a few left there on primary here is Sulkian with an AI artwork, as you see here. Visionari, I think I a.
01:24:09.122 - 01:24:25.930, Speaker A: I think in French you say intelligence artificial. If you ever see. I'd say I a, I think probably in Spanish as well. Salkien, I believe, out of Argentina. Kind of looks like a psychedelic spaceship here. It's got the right colors, doesn't it? These kind of pastels. This bubbly spaceship.
01:24:25.930 - 01:24:46.040, Speaker A: Very cool work. Looks like burning man on Mars. Moshit with. I think this is an AI artwork. Sure looks like it from over here, but it's getting harder to tell with this beautiful shiny ceramic here. And let's zoom forward before the computer crashes. Mamo acrylic and oil on canvas.
01:24:46.040 - 01:25:03.200, Speaker A: So this is Kuila, Nina. We have a couple of canvases here. From Kuila Nina. And I think these are also inspired by the tarot. This is the emperor, or maybe the empress. And this is the chariot. So a couple of physical artworks here.
01:25:03.200 - 01:25:18.844, Speaker A: Really cool how Quila Nina makes it her own in these works. Look at the river. Just an awesome, awesome artist. These are acrylic and oil on. On canvas. Very cool. Here's out of scale.
01:25:18.844 - 01:25:37.068, Speaker A: And this is Gabby Walters. I believe this looks like Gabby Walters. I didn't see a name on there, but interesting, unusual crucifix here. Looks like a physical as well. Kind of this pink lightning coming from the sky. And this huge head here. Out of scale.
01:25:37.068 - 01:25:48.028, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Not sure what's going on with all of this english auction business. This went to Roerich for only 777. Good deal. Let's continue. El viaje. This is NUV 1914.
01:25:48.028 - 01:26:10.596, Speaker A: Putting out a physical. So we've looked at a lot of NeV 19 fourteen's digital work. So here, you know, you see the same spirit of experimentation in the physical, super interesting, challenging work. Eight tezos edition of three. As we go into the Instagram works, this is where I, you know. So I got this far in the program. An hour 42 in.
01:26:10.596 - 01:26:23.636, Speaker A: This is where it crashed last time. So more work by moto. 583 moto hero. As you see this very interesting, surreal drawing. And let's. Here's bosque. Grazias.
01:26:23.636 - 01:26:35.208, Speaker A: A cyanotype. Good night, everyone. Wish you a full moon. I think this is available on object. Look at how great that looks. Probably a photo, I'm guessing. And here's Mark Belden.
01:26:35.208 - 01:26:58.674, Speaker A: This is from 2021, but usually we see Mark Belden working with flowers. I didn't know what this one was, but I kind of liked how it had this kind of pixel feel to it. Again, I talk about the preciousness, and you're almost going for a kind of preciousness when you're making physical art. And Mark Alden, you get that preciousness. Let's just quickly do that. Logi. It's official vetnalyure.
01:26:58.674 - 01:27:24.574, Speaker A: So I think this is the textiles, embroidery, and so very interesting work here. Embroidered with this kind of contemporary imagery. Just beautiful. This is from Kelowna Contemporary, Behar Studios. So the artist at the big show at Kelowna Contemporary, of course, Michele Kelowna. $7,000. But look at this beautiful, huge artwork.
01:27:24.574 - 01:27:38.678, Speaker A: It's beautiful. These phases of the moon, maybe, or something. Very nice piece. Your local neighborhood watch. 20, 23, 96 by 60. So it's huge. This is a super interesting work by priest, who we've learned from.
01:27:38.678 - 01:27:54.888, Speaker A: It's not a gallery. I think these are physical works, but you see the pixelation. I think we saw the doom painting. Remember that same artist, priest. Very interesting. Don't know too much about priest. So of course we've seen Adam Lister here.
01:27:54.888 - 01:28:15.042, Speaker A: Another interesting work. Still life with flowers in a glass vase. And here, Donny O'Donnell. Another one with this super interesting style here and here of a cat. Here's Zoe Kim. Bedtime story before bed. Looking like a camel in this kind of fuzzy style.
01:28:15.042 - 01:28:34.174, Speaker A: Almost looks like a Rizzo. Not sure how that's made. Here's Enrique Hermes, also known as Bondozo Bandido. Just putting out several paintings a day. And this great style with just airbrush and then color in the background looks great. Great contrast. And here we have another one.
01:28:34.174 - 01:29:01.496, Speaker A: So just putting out a ton of work. What I love about what Bondozo is doing, or Hermes is doing is he's putting out so much work that it doesn't matter almost what he does, because he just makes another one and just makes another one and just makes another one. It's very powerful. Adele Burger. And let's see if we can kill that Adele burger. So, beautiful combination. Kind of, again, almost like the notebook style is.
01:29:01.496 - 01:29:19.844, Speaker A: I like the sketchbook style, all right. Where things are just kind of floating, you know, kind of that Basquiat doodle style to a certain degree. This is a little tighter. Nice coloring of the white, kind of non finito esque. Beautiful, not too many colors. Powerful work on paper. 42 by 30 cm.
01:29:19.844 - 01:29:33.264, Speaker A: Not huge. And here we are, getting close to the end. HP lovebucks with another awesome one this time. Mister T. Awesome drawing from HP Lovebucks. And we're at the end. We have done it.
01:29:33.264 - 01:29:45.006, Speaker A: We did it. Alright, so tomorrow maybe there's a show if I fix my computer. Computer. But there may not be. I may be fixing my computer. Anyways, thank you for joining me. Thank you for the patience.
01:29:45.006 - 01:29:46.574, Speaker A: Till next time, take care.
