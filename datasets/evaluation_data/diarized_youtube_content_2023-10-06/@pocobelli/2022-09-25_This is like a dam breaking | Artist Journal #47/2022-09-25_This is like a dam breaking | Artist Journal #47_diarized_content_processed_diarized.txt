00:00:09.040 - 00:00:55.502, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 25, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, your artist reporter reporting on this digital art revolution that's going on here. It's kind of really amazing. Like I don't see a lot of people saying, talking about this, but what I'm seeing on a daily basis here, I don't know what else to call it. To even call this a movement is an understatement. This is like a dam breaking. You know, I've used the example of the champagne bottle of the, you know, the getting uncorked.
00:00:55.502 - 00:01:14.614, Speaker A: A cambrian explosion. It's like a dam bursting. Okay. This is Niagara Falls. So just the fact that I can fill this, you know, it's actually, there's too much to cover. So I just cover what I can here briefly for your and my sake. So welcome back.
00:01:14.614 - 00:01:43.398, Speaker A: Very quickly before we come back to our friend, strange thing with another beautiful work, let's look at this auction because it was very interesting what happened. So it went for 5.25.2 ETH. And actually if we just look at not there. Let's just go to Coingecko and see what that turns into. Not the portfolio. Go to Coingecko, click on ethereum.
00:01:43.398 - 00:02:07.394, Speaker A: This is how you do it, by the way. Then you go to converter and let's see what 5.2 ETH is. So $6,879 in a bear market. Okay, so pretty awesome. Pretty interesting to watch the action too. Back to this whole like the nature of the market and how things are selling and the nature of auctions.
00:02:07.394 - 00:02:34.372, Speaker A: Because the more we understand this, maybe the better off we are as artists. You know, just the more informed we're going to be on how this all works and how to kind of do best for ourselves collectors as well. So if we go back. So it was going to end. We can see it started September 23 at 320. So basically it's going to end. 343 was the first bid and then 24 hours.
00:02:34.372 - 00:03:01.548, Speaker A: So then we go, you know, it's one and a half. Someone bid at 328, someone bid at 326. So they're coming in at the last minute here. No one had bid from September 23 at 440 almost to a day later. Okay. And then someone comment came in 1.21 and then four minutes later, 1.54
00:03:01.548 - 00:03:21.834, Speaker A: minutes later, 1.694 minutes later, 1.85, and on and on until it hit 5.2. So good news. Congratulations to Lewis Osborne on his genesis on super rare. So he's got to be happy with that. And he was, I believe I found his tweet.
00:03:21.834 - 00:03:39.674, Speaker A: I truly cannot believe what has happened. My heart is racing. Maintaining happiness has been collected by Subo ETH for 5.2. Thank you so much friend. Also a massive thank you to everyone who placed a bid time for a cider. So very good work. Lewis Osborne continues.
00:03:39.674 - 00:04:15.154, Speaker A: And then actually, let's just quickly look if this affected his market on tezos at all, just out of curiosity and then we'll go back to our AI works. I am just curious to see if the activity picked up 12 hours ago. That would have been. No, this would have been before the auction. So not really recent sales didn't really affect it at all as a matter of fact. So that's kind of interesting as well. And so Kurt hustle collective has minted an NFT.
00:04:15.154 - 00:04:49.318, Speaker A: I will have to check that out. So let's get to the show here. Strange thing with a really cool work, beer of beer. What does it say here if Nike made beer by strange thing edition of 35? I missed the tweet or something because it looks like it was all offers if you put it in for 20. And yeah, so that sold pretty quickly, you can still buy it on secondary. Is it 32? I think I even saw it cheaper, 30. So you're getting a lot of kind of flippers in here too.
00:04:49.318 - 00:05:19.090, Speaker A: So you can still get it for a pretty reasonable price. I thought it was just a really beautiful work if Nike made beer. So back to that surrealism thing and just two separate realities in a new context, which AI just seems designed for so very beautiful work there. Buy for 30 and yeah, so that is that nice little AI update there. And waste man, gold mine of it. Now. I don't know.
00:05:19.090 - 00:05:48.766, Speaker A: I don't think we profiled this because this just came out this morning. So this is, it's almost becoming a genre that strange thing has created, I assume. I don't think, I don't. Didn't see anybody before strange thing. It's totally possible. I'm sure someone was doing some kind of renaissance thing, but this is almost becoming a genre, this contemporary clothing in renaissance or in kind of old master contexts. Wasteman Goldman showing up in the show doing a very nice job.
00:05:48.766 - 00:06:13.746, Speaker A: Doing a very, very nice job. And again, just reminds me of these kind of dutch oil paintings that are just luminescent, you know, as we were discussing last time was tiende de sombreros. I think sombreros is, is. Let's see if we can get a translation. I don't even know what that means. Hat shop. Okay, so we went from the shoe shop to the hat shop I actually really like that idea.
00:06:13.746 - 00:07:02.810, Speaker A: A lot of doing like retail, it kind of takes this clothing thing to the next level or just a new context, new work by Eddie Tree. We were just sort of mentioning how this has gone in a Sci-Fi direction and just wanted to touch on that in our AI survey here. Phantasma, again, going with that kind of science fantasy. And I brought up, remember I was talking about science fiction pulps. And so galaxy science fiction, which you see up here, was definitely probably the most famous. That was more like those small archies that they used to have like digest. Some of them were bigger though, especially the older ones, and they'd be more like a foot long or 30 cm by 20.
00:07:02.810 - 00:07:34.430, Speaker A: So it was a very rich kind of visual culture because you had these great, you know, forties and fifties sort of stuff even before. And you had these great, just super colorful, interesting, imaginative colors. Sorry, covers. And some of the artists I brought up, my favorite was always Virgil Findlay. If you've never heard of Virgil Finlay, he was a really amazing, amazing artist. Definitely one of the kinda, you could say top three in the whole science fiction pulp genre. Like, look at that.
00:07:34.430 - 00:07:59.636, Speaker A: He had this really kinda intricate style. That one's a little small. I think I brought one up here, actually. Yeah, you see? So he was definitely a master of, I guess this would be pen and ink and just really kind of beautiful work. Moody, you know, just really detailed. So Virgil Finley is a name to know. I was also looking.
00:07:59.636 - 00:08:40.654, Speaker A: That's how you spell it, you know, I was looking, I was like, how much does his work sell for a $1,000. Like he is again one of the top. I mean, some people would say the top, I mean, definitely one of the top three pulp artists. And this is an original from, you know, says Virgil, 35 from 1935, selling for $1,000. You know, that's a pretty cool piece. So anyways, Virgil Finley, if you know who that is, you're doing well. Ratcloaksea put a little work in progress here.
00:08:40.654 - 00:09:10.404, Speaker A: I was wondering. It's got this wonderful detail and kind of almost his trademark colors here a little bit, his palette, you know, that kind of army green, that red and that kind of gray blue. And he's got that beautiful detail that we see in the St. Christopher work on this one here. So pretty exciting stuff to see where this one goes. Very interesting to see such an accomplished artist working in progress too. I love the work in progress thing.
00:09:10.404 - 00:09:40.434, Speaker A: Again, one of these kind of things with digital that we work in real time here. And can kind of easily broadcast in real time, whether it's photo on Twitter or YouTube, as the case may be. More work that's just being posted on Twitter. I mean, maybe there's an NFT of this, but die with the most likes. Chill is in the air. Canada Goose has gone green by stuffing their coats with humans instead of feathers. So lube up and get cozy at a ketamine and paint this winter.
00:09:40.434 - 00:10:05.614, Speaker A: So more dye with the most likes. Outrageousness. Canada Goose arctic program stuffed with humans. So that's cool. Popple did an airdrop on eight badoo. So eight badoo, I think, is going to come back. I think eight badoo is going to come back because I'm already getting excited to put new works or at least mint some of the ones that I didn't mint before they kind of shut down.
00:10:05.614 - 00:10:41.460, Speaker A: So he said, sailor Airdrop, I guess Sailor Moon made these months ago, only minted just now on eight bidoo. If you own any of the original five sailors minted back in March, you can make a 0.1 tez offer on these new ones and make one offer on each edition of the original sailors you own. I would love to see eight Bidoo come back, and I think it might also, while I was asleep, Gloomtube put out a work. This was really interesting in the sense that, first of all, it's pretty beautiful. What was it called? Let's actually look. Spirit Halloween sunset.
00:10:41.460 - 00:11:24.194, Speaker A: So again, this kind of suburban beauty, beauty in suburbia with kind of like this one of these crazy stores where you can get like Christmas or Halloween and it's just full of junk. So kind of perfect gloom tube, uh, you know, uh, subject matter. And so his really, you know, biting commentary of kind of american suburbia. Again, this kind of suburban nightmare continues. I think a, you know, great subject here. And I was like, oh, there's no smile smiley face, but there is one here. So his trademark smiley face and just kind of nature contrasted with pure artificial garbage.
00:11:24.194 - 00:11:45.782, Speaker A: Nothing against people that might open a store like this or that. I've shopped in them. So don't get me wrong, just interpreting the work here. I managed to pick one of these up. I got lucky by Heidi rocket. Just a glitch rom work. I always find his work really interesting.
00:11:45.782 - 00:12:16.218, Speaker A: He's one of my favorite glitch rom artists by far. He really does take it to the next level and makes it his own. I want to experiment with it at some point, you know, like PewDiepie, I think he's like, I've never actually watched a PewDiePie video, but he's got a whole tutorial. So I've heard. So I've read on how to do glitchrom. If anybody's trying to figure it out, that's called good trip, worked by Echo, who is also Sabato. And another glitch rom that came out.
00:12:16.218 - 00:12:37.540, Speaker A: And edition of nine for 420 Rom. Corruption and game photography of Echo tides of time, which is from Sega Genesis. And so kind of a more abstract this one. Sorry. There we go. A little more abstract this one. So just another one that came out.
00:12:37.540 - 00:12:57.936, Speaker A: So glitch Rom is going strong and he put one. Sabbato put a Sunday driving also for auction here. I picked up one of these earlier ones. And so, yeah, so this is available as well. It's going for 50. It's a one of one. And with that.
00:12:57.936 - 00:13:26.486, Speaker A: Other than that, just let's see what KHC brought up. But before we go bread buff David 250. I should buy this while I can. I have no tazos. I need to do a little binance transfer here. So the madness continues over at the Kurt Hussle collective. And, yeah, other than that, just want to quickly thank Popple and the anonymous collector.
00:13:26.486 - 00:13:45.490, Speaker A: Yeah, popple picked up a sunset, so that's super cool. Thank you. I'm very proud of that work. And I sold a cloud, I believe, to the anonymous collector. Yes. So thank you for the sales. I'm going to put them up kind of slowly, see how they go.
00:13:45.490 - 00:13:51.514, Speaker A: I may burn some, I may not. Let's see. And with that, until next time, take care.
