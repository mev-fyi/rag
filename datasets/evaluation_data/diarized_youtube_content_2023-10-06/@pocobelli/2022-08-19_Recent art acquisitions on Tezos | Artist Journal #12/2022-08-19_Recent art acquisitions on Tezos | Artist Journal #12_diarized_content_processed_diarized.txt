00:00:04.080 - 00:00:46.824, Speaker A: Artist journal, August 19, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokobelli, your artist reporter. I am back after yesterday's Spotify. And yeah, we got kind of like rubber band tape, scissors to put this video together. I am not a video expert, but I am learning fast as I hold our theme music up to our microphone and it pleasantly fades out. So I thought, now that we have video and we're talking about art, we can look at recent acquisitions. Again, I am creating a habit here with this artist journal.
00:00:46.824 - 00:01:18.960, Speaker A: It's something that I've been saying for a little background for months to myself that I basically need to do an artist journal, and I basically just need to hit record. And so that's what I'm basically doing. But you need to have a little bit of a structure. Otherwise, I just probably won't reflect wonderfully on you if you don't. So I thought today we could start with recent acquisitions. And we're just looking at Kappa's work here, but we're going to get to that in a second. Recent acquisitions.
00:01:18.960 - 00:01:36.546, Speaker A: I want to go over a little bit of what we talked about yesterday, the audio. We had a nice little comment from. Let me just see his name here. We had a nice little comment from Chimasuku Jackson. Cool episode. Definitely make it. Video would be awesome to see reference artists work.
00:01:36.546 - 00:01:56.314, Speaker A: And I totally agree with you. So we were mentioning that yesterday. I was mentioning that yesterday. And so that's what we're gonna do. So I want to go over some recent acquisitions. I want to go over some of the art from yesterday that we discussed, Louis Osborne's work, who kind of blew up. It's kind of cooled off a little bit in the last 24 hours or so.
00:01:56.314 - 00:02:22.834, Speaker A: But I sort of see this Lewis, actually, you know what? Let's start with him, and then we'll go to the recent acquisitions, which may be how we will start it after this. But let's just pick up where we were yesterday. Quick recap. This guy's kind of blown up, this Lewis Osborne, Bristol based illustrator. Very interesting moves. And so here's the guy I was talking about. Okay.
00:02:22.834 - 00:03:29.308, Speaker A: Illustrator, graphic design guy, one of the first artists you really notice on Tezos when you come, at least when I came. But I'm kind of big on anecdotal data. And I think I start off with Heidi Roquette, as I was saying in the last episode, whose work I highly recommend as well, doing a lot of the glitched Nintendo Roms and, you know, which has been going on in the galleries for a long time, but he's made it his own and he does a really nice job of it. But, you know, we can all be Nintendo glitch Rom artists if we want. There's nothing. The person who innovated that, who knows where they are. That was at Corey Archangel or whatever, or was that someone even way before? Because just to, you know, say, and I'm totally getting off Topic here, but that, I mean, that's been going on where you saw the Super Mario brothers was just the clouds going across and that was the corrupted rom.
00:03:29.308 - 00:03:47.024, Speaker A: So it's been going around for a while. I saw that in the Whitney in New York, 2012, 2011. That was like the, that's actually kind of a semi famous show now. I'm not even a huge fan of his work. I think it's kind of overrated. And there are so many underrated artists that we have to get to here. So let's get to that.
00:03:47.024 - 00:04:24.080, Speaker A: So just a quick recap. This guy who is one of the first guys you discover, I think, when you get on the. See if we can find his creations created on the object platform ObJKT, which is on Tazos very recognizable style. Like, I mean, look at this. I mean, there's an offer for this just came out for 100 tazos on this pretty cool balloon. This stuff used to go for like five or ten, if that, but he blew up. Look, price 200, price 16.90
00:04:24.080 - 00:05:07.956, Speaker A: for a ten edition here with this blue eye. You know, like, basically you see the prices here, 4190, 46, 200 offers all across this moving Cities series. I just picked up these two for two tazos a week ago or so, and now they're selling for 255. I mean, you look at the history even. So, I just want to point this out because I think what's happening to Lewis Osborne is going to happen to the whole ecosystem. And it's starting to happen to these other artists too, mentioning yesterday, like Adelia, and we can maybe take a quick look at her. So quick recap episode here.
00:05:07.956 - 00:05:26.624, Speaker A: So anyways, so you see if you want to buy this now it's 55. I mean, you go through the history like, what did like. And there's been a lot of trading on this. This was minted on July 27. So I guess this is almost a month old now. Like three weeks old. I think I picked this up.
00:05:26.624 - 00:06:00.050, Speaker A: Yeah, four. Four tazos, right? So now it's going for 55. And if you look at some of these recent sales here, accept offer for 40. You can't be too, you know, sale here's some sales. Okay, so sale 50 on August 14. I think there's a little bit of fomo buying here. But all to say, the last two sales have been 50 and 40 on this work that came out three weeks ago.
00:06:00.050 - 00:06:24.122, Speaker A: And this is typical for this guy. And it's really interesting. His one of ones, they had like 1500 euros, which, sorry, 1500 tazos. Let's just bring that up quickly. So. Yeah, and so quick aside, I mean, this is, these are the things that are exciting me right now in art. So I'm not married to this tazo situation here, but this is my artist journal.
00:06:24.122 - 00:07:02.106, Speaker A: And this is what's kind of got me preoccupied since February because I see basically a major. I see the digital art revolution. I think some really great things happen on Ethereum. But for myself, just from my own perspective, and most of my work is on Ethereum. And I'm very grateful to Ethereum and frankly, the super rare platform a, for letting me come on, and b, I got some great sales at the peak an ETH and a half when I was at $4,000 for an ETH. So that was fabulous. I mean, that's the most success, frankly, I've had.
00:07:02.106 - 00:07:29.110, Speaker A: I mean, I'd sold a painting for $1,500 before, but. So this eclipsed that by far. Those are from the screen memories series, which again, we can get into. But yeah, you see, this was it, this work. There's an offer for 1500 euros, sorry, Tezos in Berlin here, as you know. Yeah, canceled offer. So no takers on that one.
00:07:29.110 - 00:08:00.604, Speaker A: That person got it in an auction for 51 on the 29 April. But you see the 16 August, basically around the 14 August, Louis Osborne blew up. And so, yeah, so you can see the style. The style, right. It's, you know, it's. I mean, it's an interesting debate in a sense. Like, it's very good for your success as an artist if you're always kind of sticking to one style.
00:08:00.604 - 00:08:29.504, Speaker A: I'm terrible at sticking to one style. I love. I have about eight different series that I work on simultaneously, but I'm okay with that. Like, and if, like. So all to say, you can see he sticks to one style here he has one basic series, and then he'll do variations on that specific kind of graphic design y style with the happy faces, which he does extremely well. I mean, I was lucky. I bought a lot of this work.
00:08:29.504 - 00:09:02.514, Speaker A: I should have bought more, but luckily I was already collecting the work because I could see it was just kind of a. I've been kind of putting together a museum. In my mind, some people got a really nice message, I think, from Roerich yesterday, saying, complimenting me on the collection that I have. And it's like, in my mind, I've been basically putting together a museum of sorts, like a digital art museum. And, like, in my world, like, I'm so excited by what's going on here. And you see this brilliant work here with the camera and this love. It's a great social media.
00:09:02.514 - 00:09:26.206, Speaker A: This one sold a lot. I should have bought that. I did get this one. This is a brilliant one. Let's just zoom in on that. And I'm more excited about my little art collection here than I am about the Neue national Galerie, which is like, you know, the main modern art museum, at least in Berlin. And I think it's the national one.
00:09:26.206 - 00:10:12.584, Speaker A: And that's almost, you know, it's almost, you might think that's a ridiculous statement, but, I mean, I've had friends who are like, Adrian, you need to, like, you know, tone it down. Like, nobody thinks you have a better collection. But in my heart of hearts, I enjoy it far more. And maybe that's a reflection on the Neue nationale Galerie's collection, which I find is actually surprisingly poor. I think it actually got looted after World War two ended or in Germany here. So I think that's actually what happened. It's just in, you know, not to be super critical, and I'm everybody that supports art I'm happy about even those people I'm critical about, but it's not the greatest collection in the world from my perspective.
00:10:12.584 - 00:10:33.212, Speaker A: I also. Yeah, so let's not go too far into that. But that's basically what I'm building. They have 1800 works. And I was thinking, okay, I got close to 1200 now. And so, so anyway, so there is Louis Osborne, the guy we were talking about yesterday. Quickly go to.
00:10:33.212 - 00:11:07.954, Speaker A: Maybe we can find Adelia, who's also doing really well. Again, these are the artists that you find really early on, and these are the artists I'm starting to see a lot of offers for on my feed, which says to me that there is a wave of collectors coming and they're in that process of discovery where I was, say, maybe in February when I started actually kind of buying. Seriously, look at this beautiful work. She's got a new one, space work, and it's like three minutes. What's going on here? I don't even know what's going on here. I don't know if you can hear it. So this is something to check out.
00:11:07.954 - 00:11:43.426, Speaker A: Edition of 15, buy for 35. How much was she selling this for? Eleven. So unfortunately, you know, yeah, I'm not sure exactly what's going on here. And people have been mentioning the, the flippers are getting like, are inflating prices a lot. And it's kind of a double edged sword because on one hand, they're kind of market makers. Like, if you're an artist that does get these flippers on, you're selling out right away. It's kind of fantastic, I would argue for the artist.
00:11:43.426 - 00:12:27.224, Speaker A: And then you have a market and people are buying and selling, you see what it's actually worth on the market. So there is a benefit to the flippers. At the same time, they are just simply coming in as middlemen, potentially with bots even. I mean, we have to consider that as a possibility, that they're even going with bots at certain artists, as soon as they're minted, start buying up all the works and then selling them to everybody who actually is interested in collecting the works at a higher price so that they can collect their two or three tez, sometimes more. So, yeah, so that's kind of going on. Not sure if I'm getting all my notifications here. You see my notifications? It's like you received an offer for 24 tezos for this Lewis Osborne.
00:12:27.224 - 00:12:55.992, Speaker A: This has been the story for the last, you know, few even an offer on this crazy piece. Wow. And I just bought this because I like screenshots and can't tell if it's a new. It looks like an old artist around from around these parts, but with a new name, Minta, going for four tazos, got an offer on it. So interesting. I like the screenshots. You know, back in 2011, 2012, I was doing a ton of screenshot work.
00:12:55.992 - 00:13:22.874, Speaker A: I don't even know if I have pictures of that. That's in Toronto, Canada right now. Hopefully. Hopefully my brother hasn't thrown it out. So anyway, I don't want to go on and on here. I actually want to keep these short because I have art to do and I have actually regular work stuff to do too, to pay my way through this world until the art thing takes off, hopefully. So anyways, so just a quick recap there.
00:13:22.874 - 00:13:38.234, Speaker A: Quick. I just want to take a look at a couple of works here in recent acquisitions. This is a super interesting work here. This is by, I think his name is Kappa. Let me just look. Here he is. I was just looking at his feed.
00:13:38.234 - 00:14:04.988, Speaker A: International gangster edition of ten fortezos. You can still get this. Okay. Fortezos. And look, it's like a full. Like, what I've become excited about after four months in the ecosystem is what I call, I think we all might call narrative painting, basically still static works. They can be dynamic, potentially, but this is a static work.
00:14:04.988 - 00:14:31.484, Speaker A: It's kind of like the creme, the elite painting. I was going to say the creme de creme, but I don't want to mess, confuse people, because there's a group called that on tazos. But narrative static work is kind of like the elite of the elite. And, you know, this guy's making pretty interesting work. And where you see where he's coming from. Let me just first show you where he's come from. So he's the guy that does these works.
00:14:31.484 - 00:15:02.684, Speaker A: If you recognize it. Again, do we have any info on him? Argentina. And there's a lot of these kind of south american artists on this platform, which makes it kind of interesting. Let's go back. Okay, so he's put out a couple of really nice paintings, digital paintings, f the boss. Like, really nice work. He's come a long way because he did all these, which were pretty cool.
00:15:02.684 - 00:15:42.300, Speaker A: But before that, I mean, it was kind of like this almost cartoony, jokey. Like, pretty good. Like, I still want to collect this, but, like, kind of this cartoony, jokey, semi amateur looking, frankly, and I mean, credit to him, that's how far he's come. And this is just kind of like one of the many, many, many exciting artists. And I bring him up because it's just, like, maybe a reason acquisitions as a way to just talk about some of these people, because, again, look at how interesting this work is. This is called international gangster. And you just look at.
00:15:42.300 - 00:16:18.874, Speaker A: See, this work goes all the way to the top of the screen here, the blue gradient. So just the composition in itself is kind of interesting. The messaging, the world is yours. And then it has a bunch of western flags that, I mean, maybe this is argentinian, looks like italian, us, canadian, french. So I don't know if it's an accident that he's kind of putting, like, everybody who's in the same block. Like, there's no chinese or russian flags or iranian flags here. There's no indian flag here, so.
00:16:18.874 - 00:16:33.448, Speaker A: And this. The world is yours. So I actually. I don't know if it's an accident or not. We have to assume it's not. But it seems to me like this is kind of a. It's quite ambiguous.
00:16:33.448 - 00:17:08.240, Speaker A: The world is yours. Like, is this a critique of the west, or is this literally just saying hurrah and put Argentina in the middle, he's from Argentina. But then there's the guy giving the finger. So what's brilliant about it, whatever the case, whatever he intended, is this is ambiguous. And it's like, you know, that's. It's almost like it reminds me of like a Warhol ian dollar sign, you know, if you know those works which are ambiguous. Is he celebrating.
00:17:08.240 - 00:17:40.028, Speaker A: Is he critiquing capitalism? Is he celebrating money? And it was both. I don't know if there's anything that far here. I mean, we saw the work from just a couple of months ago. It was almost like little cartoons. Is he also making, like, super sophisticated, ambiguous narrative painting? Is it a fluke? I don't know, but either way, it's a pretty cool work. Still available, only an edition of ten for Fortezos, so super interesting. Let's look at one more again.
00:17:40.028 - 00:18:09.896, Speaker A: I'm already going way over time here. I'd like to do these for ten minutes, really, but let's just see. We're experimenting here. We're creating the habit. And then there's this guy, audie, who's total. He's a bit of a weirdo, but a lovable weirdo, I think, like, I mean, pretty creepy here. Like, whatever's going on here, MSN Smash, but addition of five.
00:18:09.896 - 00:18:47.584, Speaker A: I mean, if I had come to this as the first work I saw by him, I might think it's a little weird and off, but Audi's got a great selection of work and you know, where to begin. I mean, you know, just kind of awesome from the outset, you know, fly to the moon, you got a. I think this is the first audio I bought. Just really beautiful work. Another, again, look that you can still buy that. I think he's going to burn them actually, really soon, but you can still buy that work. I was showing you edition of five for five tezos.
00:18:47.584 - 00:19:13.436, Speaker A: You know, am I the last person. Yeah, I was the last person to buy one of these for twelve tezos. And I thought I was getting a steal. Edition of 13, what I consider a major artist on the Tezos platform. And again, Tezos is going in the last couple of months between a buck 50, actually as low as a buck $22. And this brings up another little thing. Like, I buy a ton of work and people retweet.
00:19:13.436 - 00:19:36.750, Speaker A: Unfortunately, they retweet my. Me collecting them more than my actual art, but I'll take it. But the. What was I going to say? I'm not a whale. I just want everybody to know that. Because sometimes I just see, like, oh, pokebellies bought another work. I'm just like, some dude.
00:19:36.750 - 00:20:04.734, Speaker A: I did okay in crypto, but I'm like, you know, oh, tax time is coming. Like, I'll be like, oh, shit. I have to, you know, put everything together and save my money for next year's taxes and everything. Okay. So I'm just really passionate about what I see here. And I just see a ton of value, because I guess this is my point of what I'm saying. What I'm saying here with this whole I'm not a whale thing.
00:20:04.734 - 00:20:29.104, Speaker A: Look, you can buy this work here for five tazos. It's an edition of five. And he actually just put a tweet out that he's going to burn the three that haven't sold. So that could be an addition of two that you're getting basically for the equivalent of $8 us. Where. And, like, again, ambiguous narrative painting. And I don't even know if I like what's going on in this painting.
00:20:29.104 - 00:21:04.740, Speaker A: It's a little weird, but ambiguous, subtle. You can tell. These are people that have gone to museums, that have studied some art history. Interesting little, you know, the. The look at the different postures here, this outrageous one here, and all of them, though. So all to say, there's a lot to like here with what's going on on tazos. And finally, as we wrap up here again, we talked about this on the last episode.
00:21:04.740 - 00:21:30.412, Speaker A: Just stuff that I've been working on. I'm going to do a big burn, too. I haven't sold any of these. This is Jeff Mills one man spaceship with a 909 and on an observation deck. I think this is worth two tezos 50. I haven't gotten much love on that, so I may just turn it into a one of one in the next day or next few hours or so. So feel free to get that.
00:21:30.412 - 00:22:01.214, Speaker A: That's in my little pixel art sketchbook. And maybe this isn't exactly technically pixel art, but if you actually zoom in on it, I don't know if you can zoom in on it. It is actually with the square brush. Got the 909 edition of ten. So I'm going to do a massive burn here soon, everyone, so kind of get it while you can. This didn't sell at all. I mean, I thought this was a beautiful sketch of a, like, half finished sketch of a 909.
00:22:01.214 - 00:22:40.924, Speaker A: So be it. I mean, and this is another thing. Look at these great artists that aren't even selling their work, or at least cool artists that aren't even selling out, who actually have a big Twitter following or reasonably big or not insignificant. So a message to artists when you don't sell is someone who's, I've been doing the art game, I guess, seriously for, I don't know, I guess since 2012. But when I moved to Berlin, I moved to really just do art. And yeah, I have my little side gigs, but to pay the bills. But that's basically what I've done with my life.
00:22:40.924 - 00:23:22.994, Speaker A: So. And what I say with that is, as I was saying, I had some big sales before and part of the artist's life is it's kind of like a boom and bust. And I talked to friends who have been in like the Financial Times and many newspapers, and that's the story of their career, too. Like, that's the norm is, and my friend who is in the financial time and again, like he's got like a whole scrapbook of press, you know, of his shows from like 2007 or something. He's a little older than me when he was booming. And then he, like, nobody cared about his work for a few years, generally speaking, for a couple of little galleries. And now he's back in some museum show in New York.
00:23:22.994 - 00:23:57.674, Speaker A: So that's why I say don't get too down if you're not making sales because it's just kind of like, that's just how it goes out here. Stick to doing your stuff and the good times will come. And if you're booming, just save for winter because it may not boom forever. And that is just kind of how it works. And that goes almost all the way to the top. You know, you look at Julian Schnabel, who is, you know, the toast of New York in the eighties, and he kind of went through, he wasn't super loved or popular. He kind of went out of style.
00:23:57.674 - 00:24:35.386, Speaker A: And now he's kind of having a moment again in the last three or four years, shall we say. So set a few shows in Berlin here. So anyways, I'm going to leave it there because this has gone way over. But just a little tour on some recent acquisitions in Tezos. Here's a little summer thing I have and some Volk solidarity. Solidarity for, I don't know if it's for refugees or what it is in Berlin, but this curator, Lily Firstineau, wanted to show some of my work. So just the reason I have this up is because I'm going to update my website, actually, because I haven't updated it since July.
00:24:35.386 - 00:25:00.144, Speaker A: There's always so much to do. Anyway, let me get my outro music here and answer my girlfriend's text. And so, anyway, so there you go. That is another edition of. That is today's edition of the artist journal. Take care. And I'm going to try and keep up with this.
00:25:00.144 - 00:25:04.984, Speaker A: If you like it, give me a like subscribe until next time. Take care.
