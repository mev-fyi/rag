00:00:04.120 - 00:00:40.182, Speaker A: I'm starting to think we have more going on in this scene than you're gonna see in the traditional art world. I mean, I look at Art news sometimes barely ever, actually. And do they have as much going on? It's an interesting question. Look at all the personalities we have out here, weirdly enough, in Twitter Land Artist Journal, September 15, 2023. Broadcasting to the world on the high seas of the imagination, deep in inner space on a beautiful, sparkling, shiny, sunny sea. We're still in summer, my friends. We are still in summer.
00:00:40.182 - 00:01:07.894, Speaker A: So let's celebrate that. And there's another reason to celebrate. It is Friday. So welcome back. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and we're continuing here with this astonishing Niagara of beauty that is coming across my desk on a daily basis here. It is hard to keep up with this ideal of keeping this show to 20 or 30 minutes. Seems like an unrealistic ideal at this point.
00:01:07.894 - 00:01:53.554, Speaker A: Happily, though, I happily do this because we should be incredibly grateful to really be able to participate, not only to, you know, it's. One thing is to, you know, like grunge in the nineties. Let's say I kind of got interested after Kurt Cobain committed suicide. That's when I started to actually really take Nirvana seriously, unfortunately. So not only do we get to observe it, but by virtue of the technology, this Internet based technology, we are able to participate. And we have seen artists start, you know, look at Ilay, you know, who we're going to see some more technique, and maybe Ilay's done work before. I don't know.
00:01:53.554 - 00:02:23.624, Speaker A: But we've seen several artists really just kind of get started with digital art. And before you know it, they're selling stuff, they're doing stuff, they're in, you know, look at eyelase with unit London in Clare Silver's exhibition. So there is just. You just have to be grateful for that and the fact that it's Friday. So look who's back. Rare is back. And I was wondering where, you know, where's rare? Was what I was starting to wonder.
00:02:23.624 - 00:02:53.402, Speaker A: I even put notifications on my twitter. I was like, maybe I'm just missing all of Rare's tweets. I think maybe there was a bit of a break. So there is a new one here. Unfortunately, I do not know the source. This is, again, pastiche. We learned, really, we kind of drilled down on the definition of pastiche in a previous episode with Rare's work, because, of course, pastiche, one of the things it does, it's actually a pretty loose definition, if you ask me.
00:02:53.402 - 00:03:51.720, Speaker A: And we can return to that definition. Let's make a mental note to return to that definition, because a lot of us who saw that episode, including myself, it's always good to refresh this stuff. And so pastiche, as far as we're understanding it, one of the kind of main definitions we could say is taking a work or style, like, basically what I'd say, loosely appropriating another work, but really transforming it and making a commentary. And so here we see what looks like, again, I don't know, the source, what looks like maybe a 18th or 19th century painting. Again, you see almost the sepias are. You can almost see the sepias in the original, the underpainting, you know, that academic style, as we've been pointing out, you can. So you can tell this seems to be like, it almost looks like a british 18th century painting, maybe early 19th century painting.
00:03:51.720 - 00:04:44.944, Speaker A: I guess we'll find out, hopefully, usually, where we'll post the sources here. And so, you know, and probably with a dog or a hound or something, whatever they called it back then. And of course, the Boston dynamics dog, which always provides this beautiful contrast, kind of like the bright yellow dog. And, you know, rare didn't even overdo it. Like, you don't need to, in a sense that yellow, like, it's strong enough of a contrast that it really, all of the paintings just kind of pop, as they like to say in the graphic design business. Does it pop? Can you make it pop? All of these works just kind of pop because you have this kind of bright yellow dog, quote unquote dog, in them. And so just making them work, it's beautifully rough, I want to add, too, like, this is a little rougher than I was going to say, no pun intended, but that's just terrible.
00:04:44.944 - 00:05:17.120, Speaker A: It's a little rougher. And so. But it is a little, you know, it's beautifully rough is how I would put it here. This wonderful. Again, I think we see procreate. I was looking at rare's Twitter feed and back in the cafe, and actually, we'll see him working on the lips of this piece, of this woman here in this piece, working on the reflection. So look at how wonderfully kind of loose, as my friend would say.
00:05:17.120 - 00:05:51.916, Speaker A: Loose is kind of a less rough can sound judgmental, and it's not meant to. So loose is what my friend always says. And I'm like, yeah, that works beautifully. Look at this, too. I mean, just like a lot of actually contemporary painters, what you'll notice to keep things interesting on a technical level, they'll often mix, you know, more than one color into the brush. You know, you'll often see that with, like, contemporary painters, just to keep the paint interesting, you know? You know, it just adds. And it's not just straight out of the color.
00:05:51.916 - 00:06:17.294, Speaker A: It creates this gradient, this randomness and everything. So, interestingly, you almost see it here. I imagine you have to put it in separately, but you never know with the technology these days. And I mean separately, like, you put one color, let's say, in procreate, and then you start mixing it in. And I assume you just blend it in. There's that rub, like it's like the finger on procreate that's probably being employed. Perhaps.
00:06:17.294 - 00:06:31.022, Speaker A: Perhaps. I mean, it's one of their main tools. Look at how wonderfully loose this is. So you gotta love it. There's some. Look at how just kind of quick this is. It's beautiful, isn't it? Look at this.
00:06:31.022 - 00:07:08.150, Speaker A: I mean, this looks like this is as satisfying over here as, like, the real, the quote unquote real deal that you're gonna see in 18th century paintings. And I start to even wonder, is this more satisfying? It's kind of like sometimes AI brushwork looks even better. The splashes. We're talking to clownvamp and part of what's going on with AI art and, like, say, mid journey, as far as I understood, clownvamp, you can listen to the spaces. It's in the Twitter feed that we did this Wednesday. But it basically, when you're using midjourney, you can put a happy face, or you can choose. You get four images.
00:07:08.150 - 00:07:44.340, Speaker A: When you put in a prompt or combine images, you get four results, and then you select one. So this starts to train the algorithm. So this is probably why, or train the AI is perhaps a better way of putting it. And this is why the splashes of the, I suspect of, you know, we're seeing better paint strokes. It's probably because the AI is getting trained to make better paint strokes. So again, it's kind of back to that, you know, you two echoes in my mind here, even better than the real thing. That is the question here.
00:07:44.340 - 00:08:25.540, Speaker A: So that's just kind of a grand aesthetic question as you start to look at this. And just a final kind of point of perhaps irony or just conceptual point, don't forget, I think, and I am not a Heidegger expert, but I remember being in a lecture, and someone was, some professor was saying it was Michael Pellet out of the University of Saskatchewan. I think he came out of the University of Chicago, talking about Heidegger. You want distance. Sometimes you need distance. And it's easy to forget that this is a technology emulating a physical brush. Very simple.
00:08:25.540 - 00:08:46.684, Speaker A: But we're so close to it. We see, of course, that's my brushes and everything. We take it for granted. But that also resonates in my mind as we're looking at these gorgeous brushworks. A brushwork, don't forget this is a digital emulation of a physical brush. And we're okay with that. I'm okay with that.
00:08:46.684 - 00:09:02.524, Speaker A: Why wouldn't you be okay with that? Look at this. Look at this beautiful painting. Do you, wouldn't you want this one of one? So we'll see. Maybe it'll be an addition. I guess we'll find out. Just really cool work. And again, I just love this looseness here.
00:09:02.524 - 00:09:17.116, Speaker A: So gorgeous work here from rare. Just finished this one. I wasn't sure if it was a new one. So it looks like it is September 15. Just finished this one. I haven't seen one for a while. It may have missed some, but I was looking on the super rare and the foundation.
00:09:17.116 - 00:09:32.814, Speaker A: I didn't see anything. And here in the last few months. And here, look at this. Isn't this great? So you almost see the source here. Kind of nicely done here and here. This is the tool I was telling you about, the smudge tool. We don't see it being employed here.
00:09:32.814 - 00:09:52.846, Speaker A: The brush is being highlighted. But you see how fun in the interpretation going on here. So just really cool and fun and interesting. And here, look at this. Another little clue. See, the opacity is like. So, you know, another clue for us here.
00:09:52.846 - 00:10:22.182, Speaker A: As we go through our. As we sail through the pirate ship of the mind, through the high seas. As we sail the high seas, the imagination here is what I'm trying to say. There was a new comment here, Jeremy Austin, that I want to highlight from a couple of shows ago. I saw the Warhol banana piece exhibited at a recent exhibition. It was really special to see it alongside his screen prints. The show was called Pop Masters art from the Mugrabi collection.
00:10:22.182 - 00:10:48.926, Speaker A: I feel like I've seen that in the news. And featured Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, Basquiat, Kathryn Bernhardt, Quesi Botchway. Not sure who that is. George Kondo, Damien Hirschause, Joel Mesler, Richard Prince, Julian Schnabel, who I have met briefly. That's the great thing about Berlin, is you actually do sometimes meet some of these people. Mickalene Thomas and Tom Wesselman, if they're still alive. All masters of the arts.
00:10:48.926 - 00:11:32.614, Speaker A: A beautiful show and must see if it travels to a gallery you can visit. So I would love to see that kind of in the flesh, so to speak, on a screen big. I'd love to see just how they displayed that banana piece. You know, we've seen Warhol so much that now if I see a digital banana, then I'm like, oh, this is fresh, this is different, this is new, particularly in the context of the last year of us. You know, this show's been going for about 13 months, let's say, in this kind of 13 month, 13 month, you know, study here that we've been doing, many of us. And big shout out to everybody who has participated for that long. I see you out there and I have your names in my head as I speak here.
00:11:32.614 - 00:12:16.946, Speaker A: It is interesting to come back to a work like Warhol or Herring's digital artwork, with all the digital artwork and conversation we've had, and then see it, and then you go, that banana is freaking gorgeous that Warhol did. And you see it right away. And again, as Xerox was pointing out, it didn't necessarily appear that way on the screen. And it doesn't necessarily mean that they appreciated the aesthetics as pixel art as we might today in this second generation of digital art, as I like to call it. Another comment here from Lorna Mills. And this is great binge watching again. So, of course, I'm a week late to your point about third parties minting on behalf of the artist.
00:12:16.946 - 00:13:08.986, Speaker A: I think a representative of a dead artist's estate can have that power. Most artists I know with a significant exhibition career will delegate an executor just for their art output. I was appointed by a friend to make sure that her work is donated to good. And was that. I thought there was more here in this. So all to say, Lorna Mills has no problem with it. So I wonder, though, I wonder if in blockchain world, in NFT land, if the wallet minting function matters, is it the equivalent of the artist signing the work or putting that kind of certificate of authenticity? So I'm kind of super conservative.
00:13:08.986 - 00:13:58.612, Speaker A: Again, I feel like it's a slippery slope if we start going beyond the artist. And so my middle ground here is I'm kind of back to this. The Keith Haring foundation can minted as the Keith Haring foundation. And then if I buy that work, I'd almost pay more for it than if it's minted as Keith Haring. Where I just think, well, that's not Keith Haring. So, but that's just me, you know, again, if, like the person that owns a salvatore mundi, you know, mince it as the, whoever the organization is, or if the Louvre mints the Mona Lisa as the Louvre and then say, okay, we're going to put out like an edition of sorts, well, maybe that's, you know, the more legit it feels. But if they just do it as Leonardo, then it starts to feel, like, inauthentic.
00:13:58.612 - 00:14:35.434, Speaker A: So it's an interesting debate, but I think the basic principle, which I was trying to get out last time in last episode is whoever mints it should be identified as the minter. That is the principle I am kind of zeroing in on here. That in a sense, to mint for someone else is maybe it's just too slippery of a slope. And so if you're going to be the foundation, then you mint as the foundation. If you're going to be the executor of the will, then maybe you meant as the executor of the will for that person. And then it's just what it is. Right.
00:14:35.434 - 00:15:00.476, Speaker A: And I think it saves a lot of headaches by being super simple and a little bit conservative on the kind of who is allowed to or who is legitimate in minting. Continuing on rural idol. So many thoughts about this exhibition, but it sure looks pretty. So here it is, actually. And it sure does look pretty. I assume these are screens here. It sure does look pretty.
00:15:00.476 - 00:15:20.244, Speaker A: I mean, look at this. Are they screens? These look like prints. And it would be really interesting to see. And even the size. Right. So again, did Keith haring say they should be this size? I doubt it. So there is interpretation along the way, interestingly.
00:15:20.244 - 00:16:01.394, Speaker A: And these look like they're on a screen. And look at that. Gorgeous Warhol looks kind of cropped on the screen. Interestingly, I could be wrong about that. So all to say, you know, we can, as artists, we can take away what we like out of this, though, which is like, I don't even think, like, I suspect xeroxes, right. That these weren't even really seen in the same way that we're seeing them now, that this is maybe smoother and all that. But we can still look at this and learn and go, even if they didn't intend it that way, we can still take away stuff that they didn't intend.
00:16:01.394 - 00:16:21.216, Speaker A: Right. And I think that's cool. Okay. And actually a good idea. And thank you, rural idol, for posting the spaces in here. I appreciate that. And also, so comments from last episode, mcRenders, appreciate the future of my first piece on foundation.
00:16:21.216 - 00:16:47.082, Speaker A: So excited that it also got a bid so quickly. Congratulations, Mick. That is awesome. The piece itself is a kind of modern retro imagining of what a system digitizing human consciousness might have looked like. Very cool. You know, it's almost like back to that idea of simultaneous narrative where I'm gonna have to look up who that 14th quattro cento, 15th century painter in Italy who has the St. Peter's.
00:16:47.082 - 00:17:18.144, Speaker A: And it's one big landscape, but there's St. Peter on the left, there's St. Peter in the middle, and then it's like a cycle of a story. And I believe we call that simultaneous narrative when it's basically in one landscape. And you could see something analogous going on in your work here, which could be used as kind of an analogy for the different narratives in our head for consciousness. To your point, bulls love seeing Mister Sooksu in here. His works just made me think of care bears and kind of bring me joy.
00:17:18.144 - 00:17:33.596, Speaker A: There is something kind of oddly wonderful about those works. Oddly playful and actually kind of bold. Thanks once again for your show. I admire your relentless curiosity. Well, I can't help myself. And I appreciate that. Actual ct.
00:17:33.596 - 00:17:44.316, Speaker A: Great show. I want to pen. I want a pen plotter machine now. Always thought about trying to mod a 3d printer or something. So do I. So do I. So do I.
00:17:44.316 - 00:18:09.020, Speaker A: So let's see if you find a good one. Let me know. I think people are saying axi draw. This is something we should figure out, actually. People know good ones, good starter pen plotters or, you know, around the $1000 range or something that can get you started. Do let me know or feel free to write a comment. And Sid, I think that might be cider.
00:18:09.020 - 00:18:28.056, Speaker A: Not sure that Marcelo Pinel piece is crazy good. Wow. Yeah. Marcelo Pinel, as I like to call him, the heir to Alex Gray. Alex Gray might agree with it, actually. Alex Gray, I mean, Marcelo Pinell made a big deal because Alex Gray was following him like six months ago. He's like, I can't believe Alex Gray is following me.
00:18:28.056 - 00:18:42.792, Speaker A: I'm not surprised at all, actually. So some more details here. I was saying to ilay how I love this piece here. And we got some more details. Thank you so much. I'm really cheered up to know. That's so cool.
00:18:42.792 - 00:19:10.556, Speaker A: As you can see, I draw this in dpaint.org. So very cool. That looks like deluxe paint website that's just open for people to use where there's only one undo option. Hasdrubal was saying how he loves how there's very limited sort of things you can do. I start with a line drawing against the black without a plan just to see. And then I liked it, and I thought it will probably not look better then this if I'm more deliberate. But your figure was positioned more central than the YouTube show framing.
00:19:10.556 - 00:19:37.676, Speaker A: Then I took this to the pixelmator to add the COVID And this is a great program. I have it on the iPhone. I've had it on the iPhone for a long time. It makes really special kind of pixels square, just big, chunky pixels that are weirdly harder to make than you'd expect. And it does lots of stuff. It's a cool software pixelmator on the phone. Then I took this to Pixelmator to add the COVID and decided to use pixel paint.
00:19:37.676 - 00:20:04.420, Speaker A: I also liked a spontaneous plain line sketch. So exporting, in other words, or using a couple of different softwares. And she just did a wonderful job here. So thank you, Aile. And guess what else Aile did? A testament to how cool this scene is. After the show yesterday, transferred this piece that Aile probably could have got $70 for us and transferred it over to me. So a wonderful gift, Aile.
00:20:04.420 - 00:20:13.664, Speaker A: Thank you. Beautiful gift. Epic. Thank you. Thank you. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that there. I couldn't believe it, actually.
00:20:13.664 - 00:20:37.536, Speaker A: Tater tots preparing some friendly surprises. Work in progress art. So doesn't this look interesting kind of interest? I like the size, actually. The scale is interesting on some nice paper, and this looks, like, really nice. It's probably inkjet. There's almost, like, texture. You can see in this, under, like, this beige here, but maybe that's just reflection of some kind.
00:20:37.536 - 00:21:07.610, Speaker A: Looks pretty good, doesn't it? For inkjet, I mean, it looks a little less boring than inkjet often does. I rarely use inkjet on its own because it's just a little flat or something. That looked great, though. So maybe it's a paper issue and maybe that's not just inkjet. Eloy is. So we saw that awesome Lego work the other day with the Lego figure, with the palette and everything. Eloy is going to be on twitch.
00:21:07.610 - 00:21:34.758, Speaker A: I will lay the foundations for a new diary page. It will be live on air, in case you want to follow my steps as I walk with pen and paper accompanied by music linked below. That is very cool. And I think, to me, this is kind of like the future or the present, really is artists streaming and this sort of thing. You see it with Ed Marolla, which I'm very excited about. I've done it. One warning, one huge warning.
00:21:34.758 - 00:22:25.190, Speaker A: If you use twitch, I actually recommend YouTube because they don't erase your videos. Twitch, like my whole style that I developed that I had a breakthrough while I was using Twitch and nobody was watching. It was like one person maybe, and they'd come on and off and maybe it was like my own, you know, screen watching it, who knows? But I had a huge breakthrough with say the screen memories related images series where I came up live with this technique that I still use today of these masks that make. And I figured out how to do it live and I had the video and I thought, oh, this is so incredible. What an awesome. And for me personally to figure out how to do and what I was doing and how I got that beautiful result for what I considered a beautiful result, twitch deletes your videos after 30 days. And I didn't know that.
00:22:25.190 - 00:23:07.260, Speaker A: So just so you know. So if I was to stream today, I would simultaneously stream to YouTube at the minimum, just because they don't get erased, as far as I know. So just a heads up there, killer acid. There we go, killer acid. So just with, I think this is quite interesting. So opening the store and then here you see like a schedule, which is pretty interesting and kind of what's interesting about this, you could call this marketing, but really it's just informing people. There's no like buy now, right? So this is also we're discussing like, you know, works in progress as a form of marketing.
00:23:07.260 - 00:23:34.984, Speaker A: But I don't mind this. This is just like informing people out there. Hey, if you're interested, killer acid Frogs edition of 30, this is how much they are claimable signed print and also claimable sign print. So also doing the physical here, today's drop is an edition of 32, one of ones, 24 auctions, 24 hours auctions with time extension. All come with claimable prints and originals. Read the info below. So this is also pretty cool, a play on the persistence of memory here.
00:23:34.984 - 00:23:47.494, Speaker A: So killer acid is really going for it. And look at how great this looks too. So. And it's almost like a triptych. And there is the website. I didn't know there was dot fun. That is cool too.
00:23:47.494 - 00:24:10.544, Speaker A: Continuing on, glitchcraft. So this is Euridice and they saw Sabato's work. This is in Boston, Massachusetts at a show called Glitchcraft at Simmons Gallery. And here you see the artists here. There is Sabato. And here is the show. See if there is no sound.
00:24:10.544 - 00:24:34.118, Speaker A: So cool retro monitors kind of. And there is the Sabato show. And yeah, you see it works from the chrome period here. So pretty cool. Nice documentation here. The liquid halls of modernity and looks like a pretty nice show, doesn't it? Looks like an exciting show. So all very cool here.
00:24:34.118 - 00:24:55.794, Speaker A: And then just some classics here. Milk and cookies by Sabato. So just really cool here. And there's Eurydice, and I think there's a picture. This is great documentation, by the way, not sure who this is. And, oh, that looks like Sabato the dolphin there. So pretty cool show here.
00:24:55.794 - 00:25:19.550, Speaker A: And yeah, old retro tvs looks like a lot of fun. And there they are, Sabato and Eurydice. So very cool. Fornax void now here is kind of like a commercial of sorts. Tomorrow, my 2009 debut album, Memory Machine will be released on double vinyl on motherboard. Music video premiere on YouTube on September 15. That is today.
00:25:19.550 - 00:25:40.234, Speaker A: And visual album premiere on YouTube. So check this out. Visual album. So Fornax Void continues to enter. Let's see if we can. A lost fragment from the past comes back to life. Beautiful ad from a simpler time created during the dying days of the early web.
00:25:40.234 - 00:26:27.718, Speaker A: I bet Fornax void made this ad, and it's better than most ad agencies, I would argue, on motherboard.com. Seriously? Seriously. Like these transitions, these, uh, this this part here, like, again, if a lot of these people could run their own kind of, and you can do it more and more with chat. GPT you run your own ad agency, a lot of these people. And why would you, if you're already making this gorgeous art? But you see what I'm saying? Like, this is cool. This is kind of like, you could see the ad agencies coming later and appropriating us, appropriating other people. So very, very, very cool.
00:26:27.718 - 00:27:10.488, Speaker A: Imagine you saw an ad like this on, like, NFL football, if that's what you watch, or soccer or whatever, I'd be pretty impressed. Speaking of being impressed, check this out. Look at the artist in a second here. Hey, so the key to success is, did you get it? I love it. I absolutely love this. I wish I had a copy. There is an edition of five.
00:27:10.488 - 00:27:24.704, Speaker A: It is selling for a thousand tezos. Wait till you see who bought it. This is someone called Danny Ruskin. And I think I saw this maybe on Fornix Void. Yeah. Look at who bought us. Haiti Rocket Fournax Void Maison III, who we're going to look at today, I believe Spuegel's maskinen.
00:27:24.704 - 00:27:40.684, Speaker A: And I think this is eurydice here. Akira Dice. So all star cast here. Ten tezos only. Awesome, awesome piece from Danorus. Key to success. Just a really cool, fun work.
00:27:40.684 - 00:28:22.764, Speaker A: Speaking of which, guess who's back? It is Kappen in the form of figments, this time with Lumbusk. And of course, Kappen came out of the music scene before he realized he had this incredible talent to make digital art guru meditation. Let's get this going again. The music is just so solid from my perspective, out of this scene, we're not gonna be able to play the whole thing, but we can let the music soak. We can soak up the music for a few seconds here. Really moving. Look at how beautiful this is.
00:28:22.764 - 00:28:56.680, Speaker A: When it takes up the full screen like this. I mean, and these wonderful horizontal lines that we see here, it almost really captures that kind of retro computer vibe. Like the emotion of that sounds like a 303 or something. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. So that is Lum Busk with the incredible music and figments. It's another masterpiece here. I don't want to use that term too loosely, but I mean, this is awesome.
00:28:56.680 - 00:29:09.864, Speaker A: I mean, this will cost you $9.86. There's 20. Like, I should run and get one while I can. There's two left. Incredible. And another gorgeous work here. My pixels will become paint.
00:29:09.864 - 00:29:33.000, Speaker A: This is RJ, the text in the shell prophecy. So, returning to RJ's roots here with the text in the shell. This was the first series I know that RJ has done. I came to the scene after he had already started and almost ended that series. It is back where, you know, the text in the. Or the ghost in the machine. My pixels will become your paint.
00:29:33.000 - 00:30:01.682, Speaker A: Returning to this theme here, here's a nice black and white version. Super cool edition of ten for 25 tezos each. And there are seven left. Really, really cool. The text in the shell Spiegels is back with another what looks like on chain work. In other words, it doesn't point to ifps. This is a native work on the Ethereum.
00:30:01.682 - 00:30:28.396, Speaker A: Blockchain requires no external link. So as far as I understand, it looks like it's in that series. A homage to Lubomir Romanq, co inventor of the magnetic hard drive, sold to nextroy. So just another super cool work. I saw one go to Pablo Puncaso with what looked like 0.2 ETH. So just really cool work here.
00:30:28.396 - 00:30:39.864, Speaker A: More awesome music. Check this out. This is Max capacity open edition. I think I saw this in Haiti. Rockette's collection. Great music. It's Friday.
00:30:39.864 - 00:31:08.000, Speaker A: Just fun and cool. Gotta love it. You know, it's Berlin art week here. I was out last night and actually last night was awesome. My friend Charlie Stein. I should bring up pictures of that. Maybe next episode.
00:31:08.000 - 00:31:27.048, Speaker A: I took pictures. They're on my instagram. If you ever want to see the going out sort of stuff here in Berlin, I put them in the stories. So all to say, this is just really fun, really fun art. N 0813 neo foam and Max capacity. So maybe a collaboration here. Only seven minted.
00:31:27.048 - 00:31:41.190, Speaker A: Eleven days to go. Five tezos, so $3.29 for that. Awesome work. You know, I was actually listening to that song. I almost want to do it with this. And I was just thinking how cool this scene is.
00:31:41.190 - 00:32:10.458, Speaker A: Like, look at how cool. Look at how cool this is. And then, I mean, this looks like the music video. Anyway, awesome work here from Kurt Hussle collective. A new one, these very small additions of five. Again, going to a pretty cool cast here. There's Haiti rocket, 50 tezos continuing with these kind of sumo wrestler guys on DBO sports, sumo arcade.
00:32:10.458 - 00:32:29.174, Speaker A: So it's almost like mortal Kombat meets sumo wrestlers. Super cool here. 19 1997 900 this is an ad. This is an ad that I thought was brilliant, Alio. So I'm not even sure what this is. Some sort of ZK roll up or something. Look at this ad.
00:32:29.174 - 00:32:48.570, Speaker A: It looks great. Your data is secure. Yeah. Like, just look at the visuals here. And we're kind of back to this idea of the ad agency. You know how like, this looks like it could be like a really awesome NFT right there. Like the handshake, for example, and I guess brilliantly designed here.
00:32:48.570 - 00:33:18.638, Speaker A: And I really could see the advertising world. Like if you're a creative director or art director and you're starting to see this stuff, you're going, this is exciting, this is fun, this is cool. And it wouldn't shock me to see that, you know, here we are, that the artists are paving the way. It wouldn't be shocking for me that this is where we're going to see it, basically, in this NFT digital art scene. It's a very vibrant scene here. Pixel air. And I believe this is a play on the pixies here.
00:33:18.638 - 00:33:43.698, Speaker A: Tons of music this episode, I should tell you, a Friday episode here. Trust me. Pixel rare, I think, sounds like the pixies. My neighbors are going to freak out. It sounds like the pixies kind of remixed by pixel rare here. So very cool work here. Edition of three.
00:33:43.698 - 00:34:01.558, Speaker A: It's probably out the door. Just one gone. Edition of three for 20 tazos. So cool work here. You can see the rest. So again, a lot of things converging here. Music, videos, music, pixel art, advertising.
00:34:01.558 - 00:34:16.702, Speaker A: It's all very interesting. We are. What do they call it? The. What is that thing at the end of time? It starts with an e. The. Not the intelli. Maybe it'll come to me.
00:34:16.702 - 00:34:41.076, Speaker A: The. How am I escaping that? It's also a neoplatonic term, the. And Terence McKenna loved it. I'm sure someone will know it out there. And here's Hugo. Hugo back with a play on what looks like that video game. With that, I'm also blanking on Grand Theft Auto.
00:34:41.076 - 00:35:02.433, Speaker A: There we go. San Andreas. And here is just another super. So of course, Ugo did the horse, and it did spectacularly. And here is a brand new one referencing their grand theft auto. So another kind of interesting mix of pixelation here. And whatever this process is that Ugo is doing that just looks awesome.
00:35:02.433 - 00:35:25.924, Speaker A: Continuing on, that is on Zora Maison III with a new work. So Maison III has put out some incredible glitch roms in the past. Animorph, software, rom corruption and hexedit. This is Game Boy color. So pretty cool here. Just kind of simple, nice, kind of not too many colors, which also works. This is eight tezos, and there are six left.
00:35:25.924 - 00:35:50.188, Speaker A: Silva sand twos with a couple guitari pomodori, attack of the killer tomatoes. And here you see almost what looks like a zoomed in glitchrom. So interesting crop here, playing with the scale a little bit. So that is interesting. And here's another one. Again, playing with the crop horses, battle jockey. And this was interesting.
00:35:50.188 - 00:36:18.450, Speaker A: Kind of looks like a unicorn that turns into a knight's horse that turns into a cowboy. So it's almost like this is the video game is it's a horse in all these different contexts. Seemingly interesting horses. Great title. Continuing on low, trippy with a one of one. So we saw a similar work, but this one has a different background here with clouds zero, our heroes. So low, trippy.
00:36:18.450 - 00:36:36.624, Speaker A: Putting out a one of one is at auction for 25 tezos. I believe McRenders has put in the bid here. So another interesting pixel art piece. Let's just take a look. Yes, 25 tezos still up for auction. And stippin pixel with a new one. A very fun one too, here on Zora.
00:36:36.624 - 00:36:53.340, Speaker A: This is an edition of five for 0.02 ETH, so some cool pixel art here. It'll be interesting to see how one of ones might do on Zora as well. So let's actually zoom in a bit. So there we go. And again, this really nice pixelation here. So stiff and pixel.
00:36:53.340 - 00:37:16.754, Speaker A: Having a ton of fun here on Zora, as is McRenders, who we just saw bidding on that other work. So another cool piece. Again, McRenders was at the top of the page there just the other day with the spinning head. And so this is called mix zorb. Motional mix or motional sad wave. So this is sad wave. So cool work here.
00:37:16.754 - 00:37:33.058, Speaker A: Two minted, 13 days to go. Looks like an open mint here. And here's p one with almost what looks like a stained glass cathedral here. There's. If you've ever. I think the greatest stained glass is in Paris. One of the.
00:37:33.058 - 00:37:51.338, Speaker A: There's a incredible. It's more of a chapel than a cathedral. And it's basically floor to ceiling stained glass. If you've never seen that, you have to go. It's very close to Notre Dame, just down the street, really, if you ever get the chance. Kind of reminds me of that. It kind of very much has a stained glass feeling.
00:37:51.338 - 00:38:14.682, Speaker A: Interesting analogy. And also, what do they call it? Words escape me today. Where that ancient. Where you put colored stones, mosaic, you know, mosaic, pixelation. Here's a little bit of stained glass and that repetitive pattern. Just kind of interesting analogs here. Loac me with gallery data window zero.
00:38:14.682 - 00:38:36.686, Speaker A: And I believe this is on the homepage of object. So just a cool pixel art piece. Animated abstract pixel art, black and white from Loac me, I think pretty low edition. Low edition of ten, selling out at 25 tezos each. Pretty good. And here it is, part of the tramage exhibition at data gallery. So cool work there.
00:38:36.686 - 00:38:54.034, Speaker A: And here's Pamela Carano. Serrano me los Diaz. And this is 0.009. And this is a music work as well. So kind of a combination. Look at how cool that artwork is, though, inside. So a ton of music today.
00:38:54.034 - 00:39:27.970, Speaker A: Really nice music, too. I see a commonality in the music style between all of these artists. Like, they all would play well at the same party, this Tezos party, in my mind, on the pirate ship. So simple and beautiful. Five minute song. I mean, you can mint, like, long works on Zora. So just awesome.
00:39:27.970 - 00:39:38.314, Speaker A: Brilliant, brilliant. So 0.09 ETH. Looks like an open edition here. Is that work I was trying to load up yesterday. Let's see if it loads up today. This is on sound XYz.
00:39:38.314 - 00:40:13.218, Speaker A: Also Pamela corone. Same cool style. It's almost like the sonic equivalent of the art, right, of this kind of pixel art, retro. Like, it's just taking all the best of this kind of old technology. There's even comments. I love it. The best of choice.
00:40:13.218 - 00:40:34.098, Speaker A: Chill parties. So super cool. As we sail into Friday here, as we sail into the weekend brave with explainer gallery, a pioneer gallery here on the scene out of China. A place to come back. There's nothing like a place you love. Merchants also need a place to call yours pixel art on canvas. So looks like.
00:40:34.098 - 00:40:59.024, Speaker A: Kind of looked like. At first I thought maybe this is like a homeless person's kind of spot on the street, but I think it's. It might be something else. So I'm not exactly sure what this is, but a cool pixel artwork with a cool subject matter here. And because this looks like a room like that, doesn't look homeless. So I'm not sure exactly what this is, but interesting work here from Bravepixel. From Brave and explainer.
00:40:59.024 - 00:41:20.270, Speaker A: These are really cool too. Grotesque chic. Golden mirage. Look at this great dithering landscape here. It's like, you know, kind of like Yves tangi, but not. The color is really interesting. The size of the canvas, like, the dithering size, is really nicely done.
00:41:20.270 - 00:41:39.054, Speaker A: And this super interesting composition. And even down here, you know, the dragging of the sampled brush, you see it over here. A very interesting landscape. Only five tezos, nine left. Unbelievable. I wonder if these are. These are sold out at ten tezos.
00:41:39.054 - 00:41:53.570, Speaker A: So let's look at this one. Golden mirage. Another just super interesting. Kind of looks like a wheat field a bit, but not quite. And these beautiful big brushes that are dithered out. I love it. I absolutely love it.
00:41:53.570 - 00:42:10.248, Speaker A: So 21 90 by 1860 png bitmap. Most drawn on deluxe paint too. So that is what happened there. Really great. Look at this. And we're gonna have to pick up the pace a little bit, as usual. This is Matthias Morano with three editions.
00:42:10.248 - 00:42:30.864, Speaker A: And I thought this was super interesting. This is the one of one. This reminds me of Marvel comics, actually. This is the one of one edition that is like a hologram, a hologram version. It reminded me of Marvel comics in the nineties, where they'd have the regular edition, then they'd do the hologram edition. Look at this. Really nicely done too.
00:42:30.864 - 00:42:53.084, Speaker A: So animates this one, the resurrection here. Really cool piece. And then we go here, and we see basically the static version with the addition of 31. And let me just see what they sold for on primary here, except offer of 70. So selling for quite a bit of money. Selling for 100. That is impressive.
00:42:53.084 - 00:43:12.300, Speaker A: And here you see the same work, but just like the static version, colored. And then here you get the ink version. And this is an edition of twelve. I think it's quite brilliant. And, you know, it's kind of. I'm not against this at all. Like, it kind of gets me thinking on my own work.
00:43:12.300 - 00:43:28.144, Speaker A: Because sometimes you have these kind of mixed feelings. How do you do it? I think this is quite brilliant. They all have their own kind of feel to it. They are distinct works. I see this as legit. Like, it's hard to see this as illegitimate. I see this as legitimate and I think it's cool.
00:43:28.144 - 00:43:49.540, Speaker A: And I think kind of makes me want to do it. A very interesting way of kind of reusing a piece. They're completely different styles, right? They are different works. So again, we're kind of back to that theme, the tension of digital copies here. But these aren't. Are these copies continuing on? Impostor offers accepted. I wasn't exactly sure.
00:43:49.540 - 00:44:04.412, Speaker A: I assume this is on Tezos somewhere. I didn't see it right away. So I just brought up the twitter. Kind of a cool work here. Self awareness. So again, looks like it uses ASCII or Petsky text. And there is a little heart in there.
00:44:04.412 - 00:44:26.806, Speaker A: So cool work there. Continuing on, of course, you know, the artist demon ego. This is going to be on Zora beyond words that have lost their function. And here you see the notebook and more. So just a cool combination of physical and digital here. Even looks like some photo here or scanning as demon ego was experimenting with. Let's keep going here.
00:44:26.806 - 00:45:05.626, Speaker A: Rannix deer time bent, continuing with these kind of abstracts that look, these figurative abstracts, I almost want to call them, and almost looking like AI distortions in here, but not sure about that time bent. So cool title here, edition of six. And they are sold out at five tezos each. Continuing on, Wasteman gold minevich. Speaking of all the auctions here. Here's the Christie's auction with Wasteman's work. And, you know, like, crazy as it might sound, and maybe it is crazy, you know, 20 years from now, one never knows.
00:45:05.626 - 00:45:30.114, Speaker A: And there, I mean, I'm a huge fan of this series here of the failed artist. It's funny because it's, you know, it's funny because it's true oftentimes, let's put it that this way. So a great, a deep satire there of the artist, to me, almost a timeless satire that Wasteman is doing here. That's why I keep coming back. Like, I love this series. We were looking. I ended the show yesterday with this work.
00:45:30.114 - 00:45:54.244, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a hilarious satire. And, you know, the artist making fun of themselves. It's quite brilliant. Sophie Agura market bathing not sure, but I thought it was really original what this title is. Let me just show you. And there is the market there. And I thought it was just a really original treatment here of the subject matter.
00:45:54.244 - 00:46:12.254, Speaker A: Even see a glitch going through. Just interesting work here from Sophie Ogura. Edition of 15. And there are three tezos, 40 and there are seven left. And more music. Tons of music. This is House of the model with a really cool like nineties bass line here.
00:46:12.254 - 00:46:51.842, Speaker A: Sounds like an edgy primal scream at a track from like 93 or something. Even just the way this comes in like all the best of the nineties. So totally awesome here. House of the model edition of 10,000 for one tezos if you have sixty five cents to spare. I'm telling you, all the music goes well together, doesn't it? Kyle Flemmer with a few works. We're going to show a couple here. Senshi Ammi.
00:46:51.842 - 00:47:21.434, Speaker A: So some just cool kind of analog video glitch with some what looks like a kind of sailor moon type of subject matter. It is Sailor Moon computer school blues rescanned from a zenith CRT TV, color corrected and reanimated in Photoshop. There's another one. These are editions of ten and just not listed yet. And just kind of cool work for the walls of our tezos party here. Totally awesome here. Walls of our digital art party.
00:47:21.434 - 00:47:38.302, Speaker A: We are multi chain over here. But all very cool. And a lot of it is on tazos. Credit must be given where credit is due. Ex mortal with a very cool flamingo work here. Also on object with these great outlines here. These very warm outlines here.
00:47:38.302 - 00:47:56.038, Speaker A: Great subject matter. Nice kind of traces here of these flamingos. Just a really beautiful work title recall special mint for the Dos punk style. So that is cool. Continuing on with the analog video glitch. We have lb on Zora. Look at this.
00:47:56.038 - 00:48:14.994, Speaker A: So this is cat in motion. Really reminiscent of. I think it's Edward Muybridge. We will look on another episode, but this one's going long as well so we'll leave it for another one. But really reminiscent of Edward Muybridge. And who was the other person? There were two people that did these kind of photographs. We will look in a future episode.
00:48:14.994 - 00:48:38.994, Speaker A: So lb on Zora. It looks like a free mint three minted so far 15 days. You got some time, but don't take too long. DJ Kuro with an addition of seven. What does that say per per lock, per talk? Not sure. As far as the ad Kira was telling me about the ad, but he said I was watching it on an Xbox, the show. And that's why I saw.
00:48:38.994 - 00:48:51.638, Speaker A: Maybe that's why I saw the ad. I was watching YouTube on Xbox. So that is the only report I've gotten of an ad on this show. Continuing on, so beautiful work here. Edition of seven. Cool glitch video. Analog glitch.
00:48:51.638 - 00:49:14.478, Speaker A: And this is the collaboration between Ranixtier and DJ Kuro. Momentary lapse 33. Interesting title and there are quite a few in this series. And momentary lapse 32 edition of seven three tezos. So cool works here. Great combination, these two. And this is the work I was trying to load up yesterday, which kind of goes with that last work.
00:49:14.478 - 00:49:30.222, Speaker A: Andre Gora Deluge melodies I was trying to load this up yesterday on super rare. It wasn't loading. Really nice abstract here, isn't it? Beautiful digital abstract here. Awesome colors. Just beautiful work. Reserve of 0.4 ETH, so $657.
00:49:30.222 - 00:49:48.564, Speaker A: Not cheap, but on super rare here. So very cool. Not crazy either. Boo boy Summer wall number two. So this is an edition that is part of a bigger series here, or I think it's. I can't remember exactly. Boo boy Summer wall number two.
00:49:48.564 - 00:50:03.372, Speaker A: Anyway, let's look at the work. And you see this awesome illustration here. And as part of an addition, so I believe you can still mint this out. And you see some cows here. And just classic buboy edition. It's probably not too expensive. This was minted for 0.03
00:50:03.372 - 00:50:25.772, Speaker A: ETH, so not too crazy. And huge file 7000 by 10,000 on foundation. I saw this tornado Rodriguez. My reactions arrived to solar Plex XYz. It makes you wonder, is tornado going to be doing some sort of PFP type thing? Which would be great. Look at this. So clearly Tornado Rodriguez.
00:50:25.772 - 00:50:41.760, Speaker A: So not exactly sure what's going on here. Something special just dropped on solar Plex. So maybe if you check out solar plex, you'll see what tornado is up to here. Pretty cool series. Also some interesting digital illustration. De Crcy Geoffroy. So this is back from the lockdown.
00:50:41.760 - 00:51:04.384, Speaker A: I don't remember seeing it though, and I thought it was actually quite brilliant. You know, this really did kind of capture the lockdown where you basically lived your life indoors most of the time. You know, you're lucky if you had a balcony, that's for sure. During lockdown. Luckily I had a balcony and there's just like almost this hamster wheel. It was very true. Brilliant work.
00:51:04.384 - 00:51:31.492, Speaker A: Continuing on, Dylan, with an interesting digital collage here, interestingly signed by the way because it looks almost like a written signature boxing make piece, but digital collage. So this is a one of one for 15 tezos for the one of one collectors out there, FYI. And I think I brought up Dylan's page. Dylan has made some really brilliant works in the past. Look at this one of one. This one's still available. I may pick this up while this show is uploading.
00:51:31.492 - 00:51:48.360, Speaker A: Look at that. That is a one of one for five tazos $3. Incredible. Here's some more there. I won't take all of them. Look at that. So just a cool, really cool artist again, probably off the radar if one of ones are $5.
00:51:48.360 - 00:52:22.646, Speaker A: And you know, another discovery here as we endlessly, as we sail through these massive, massive oceans of digital art here of digital imagery. Sky Goodman, the life of objects with an awesome title here. Cool work. Classic, recognizable as Sky Goodman and just a cool kind of digital artwork. Probably a lot of exporting, as per usual. Animation blender, 3d loop geometry, ten second loop made with code, video feedback and synthesis. So Sky Goodman edition of 15 for 15 tezos.
00:52:22.646 - 00:52:42.198, Speaker A: As we wrap up here, look who's back. Joa in. So I haven't seen Joa in for a while. This is also part of the space World showcase. I wonder if buu boy, that was maybe the showcase that Buboy was part of. So a new AI artwork and I think this may be an addition as well. We'll look in a second.
00:52:42.198 - 00:53:15.764, Speaker A: So cool AI work here, I think edited in Joa in's case and continuing to evolve and develop. Like it's not just yoh in is not just staying with that one kind of palette here. Like it really is expanding. This came out September 11 and this looks like a one of one summer bruises is the name of the work. AI and digital painting from Joa in as we go into we have quite a bit of AI artwork here soon with the new one. Post rooms number seven edition of ten for four tezos each. Just super interesting.
00:53:15.764 - 00:53:36.932, Speaker A: Only AI would have made that tuques with a new work on object hidden horizon. Beautiful work here from tewks. Kind of captures all the mystery of castle, medieval castle. This is 21 tezos edition of 15. Beautiful. Here's one that Teux just put on Twitter. Just another super interesting work.
00:53:36.932 - 00:53:58.612, Speaker A: And this is probably also AI. The sun should have been with me. Beautiful moonlight. We have poetry, we have art, we have music. We have it all. Moonlight by Etkin. And this kind of had a bit of a Magritte feel to it with these figures looking from behind and just kind of emoted somewhat for me.
00:53:58.612 - 00:54:22.552, Speaker A: I thought it was kind of interesting kind of image here. Edition of five for only five tezos. And five are left, so you can still get that on. Tezos from Etkin Mopi Wellington with an interesting kind of animated AI assisted SF ten. So crossing paths. This is called kind of a turn of the century feel to it, kind of 1920 kind of feel to it. And playing with animation a little bit.
00:54:22.552 - 00:54:45.612, Speaker A: So that is interesting. Edition of ten. A couple of offers coming in. 20 and 30 tezos, not bad at all. And Mikey Wilson with a work Capadonnas blues early evening. I have a bit myself meetin and this is an edition of 15 for ten tazo. So continuing with the blues theme, but here we see a Wu Tang clan in the frame.
00:54:45.612 - 00:55:04.252, Speaker A: You wonder if this is like a drum machine or something, but maybe this is food. Not exactly sure, but interesting in the big ten gallon hat here. Hilarious. Beautiful. I mean, is this AI? Look at how like, is the beard. That's incredible. I wonder if this is like again, raw AI and you get the beard like that.
00:55:04.252 - 00:55:26.332, Speaker A: That is incredible. I mean, we have, we can't forget this is probably raw AI with prompts. I mean, that's pretty amazing. All that detail keeps being interesting. Paper doll here, AI, she is available on object. So not sure I've ever seen this artist before, but I thought just an interesting relationship. I thought this painting in the background was really beautifully done.
00:55:26.332 - 00:55:55.726, Speaker A: Interesting relationship. The painting and the painting relationship. So just an interesting work here from paper doll and Howie Angler, who is an avid Tezos art collector and the proud owner of Tezos Art Collective and hosts a signature collection. So the person that has commissioned all of these works here or requested, however you want to put them, I still need to make mine. And Howie has been super patient there. I may try and make it this weekend. I said I'd start today.
00:55:55.726 - 00:56:17.078, Speaker A: So let's see. There's retro Manny, but a brilliant kind of AI artwork here. There is mech TxT and yeah, so just really cool edition of 125. But sometimes they burn them after a couple of days, so you might not have much time for Tazos. And 72 left. So get it while you can. Howie Angler signature collection and white solitude.
00:56:17.078 - 00:56:45.804, Speaker A: Kind of shifting gears a little bit with some boxing, painterly boxing works. And these are also AI. All right, art AI champion. So again, the painterliness. And you're also playing like Mopi Wellington with animation and even audio. Pretty interesting. Just pretty interesting aesthetically.
00:56:45.804 - 00:57:19.940, Speaker A: Like what is this? This is like an AI video. It's almost like a gif, but it's like a mini video I've seen. It reminds me, actually of some works that I want to bring up from an artist I haven't seen from for years, but who has made some really powerful works that I still deeply are impressed by. Shilly Preston, looking for signs of alien life. Some more AI video, I think so. It's just interesting to see how this tech is working and see how artists are using it here. So this is a 13 2nd video.
00:57:19.940 - 00:57:33.404, Speaker A: Interesting hat. So here comes AI video, right? Guy Fury AI generated video. Very interesting. And here, some physical works. Baby, don't leave me alone. So kind of a sad work. Your cake.
00:57:33.404 - 00:57:51.764, Speaker A: Watercolor on paper. This is by Bazak Kalisir. And just a really cool watercolor here. So a physical work and another physical work here. I don't think I've shown this one before, but I've shown this artist many times. I love this artist. This is physical, as you can see here.
00:57:51.764 - 00:58:22.476, Speaker A: I'm not exactly sure if this is screen printing or how it's done. And then you see just that epic contrast between the kind of pixelation which is, again, I don't know if it's screen printed or what, with this awesome. Very soft. We saw this just the other day with hasdrubal waffles boxer. This is the same contrast just done differently. Super soft airbrush with hard geometric pixelation. Right? Tim Laham on Instagram.
00:58:22.476 - 00:58:53.372, Speaker A: And of course, you recognize this as Wok with this iconic scene of Steve Jobs presenting the iPhone. I looked at this video a couple of years ago, maybe three or four years. Maybe three years ago, like the launch of the iPhone, and you see the genius of Steve Jobs salesmanship, the buildup that he does. And then when he delivers it, just like a great dj leads, gets people interested. What are you talking? And then boom, we've done it all and more. Brilliant. I love the subject matter here.
00:58:53.372 - 00:59:17.558, Speaker A: This was a massive moment. And so there's walk on the scene again with a massive kind of pop culture moment. Remember paparazzi from yesterday? Of course, you know the artist here, Yoao Salazar, with again. And I don't think there's anything new. A lot of us have probably seen this. I think this has been around. I'm not sure, but just, you know, a scene that many of us in the big cities are familiar with.
00:59:17.558 - 00:59:24.814, Speaker A: And that, my friends, is your show. Thank you for joining me again. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. And until next time, take care.
