00:00:07.720 - 00:00:28.150, Speaker A: Great news, everybody. Go. Golitis is a go. He is a go for Wednesday. Twitter spaces. If everything works as it should, Golitis, runetune and yours truly will be hanging out Wednesday, 09:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time live.
00:00:28.150 - 00:00:49.428, Speaker A: And you can hang out with Gogolitis, a true pixel artist. Master Pixel Artist, Artist Journal, February 13, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Welcome back, everyone. I hope you had a wonderful weekend. And look at this.
00:00:49.428 - 00:01:21.516, Speaker A: So as I was saying, gogolitis, the creator of this gorgeous artwork, this super interesting artwork is going to be in Twitter spaces on Wednesday. So I'll put out the tweet later today and I will pin that up. And yeah, you can set the reminder and all that good stuff. So continuing on here, so here's the work that he actually just posted. I was going to start with this before I messaged him, by the way. I just messaged him here. And so this is an edition of 20.
00:01:21.516 - 00:02:06.918, Speaker A: And if I remember the tweet right, he's taking like the top 18 offers, I think by a certain time, maybe like an hour or two after this video is gonna be out. So you'd have to be quick and, yeah, so this gorgeous, gorgeous work and kind of playing with his whole computer chip circuit board motif. And now he's got some sliders. So kind of a new phase is what this looks like with the color and the ideas. Kind of a new phase. So beautiful, beautiful work. Sometimes taking a little break can do wonders because go, go Litus, I haven't seen him too much in the last few months, but he is one of the first artists that you run into and are just kind of fascinated by when you arrive on Tezos.
00:02:06.918 - 00:02:38.750, Speaker A: So anyways, very happy return for gogolitis. So just a few quick comments here. So get this. So Alpha Centauri kid, I mean, it's pretty amazing for this show, Alpha Centauri kid sent out a tweet and also a big thank you. The guy who sold at the person who sold at Christie's for over $100,000 weighs in, man. Thank you so much for that thoughtful review. Really, really appreciate you for that.
00:02:38.750 - 00:03:57.054, Speaker A: So how great is that? And I'm just thrilled to hear from you, Alpha Centauri kid. I mean, this is a kind of like a new high for this show with people, artists who are selling for $100,000 at Christie's, if I have all my details right, are chiming in on the show. So that is exciting. Also, a couple more here, Eduardo Pulitzer, also known as Ed Marolla, also had a very interesting comment because we were discussing, I was thinking out loud to myself, does Ed just simply, uh, is he just not planning anything? Is he just putting stuff down and then kind of working with what he has? Kind of like Robert Rauschenberg was, in a sense, is there no plan? Because that's kind of what I was starting to get the sense for. So he replied, it's super common for me to just paint an abstract background and wait for someone or something to emerge from the composition. So, yes, now, or not uncommon to draw it first on paper and work a bit more conscientiously on the theme and composition. Now, I don't know if this is not or now uncommon to draw it first, probably now, I assume.
00:03:57.054 - 00:04:19.920, Speaker A: But point being, it's super common for him to work that way. And that was the sense I was getting. It's a fun way to work. It kind of takes a lot of the, you know, the work of making art out of it, because all of a sudden you're just like, whatever, it's here, and I just work in the moment. Very interesting, fun way to work. So, anyway, so thank you, Ed, for the comments. Super interesting.
00:04:19.920 - 00:04:43.748, Speaker A: We're going to see some more of your work here, and thank you. Luciana, who we started with, also had some nice comments on Twitter, and she loves Danielle Richter, so that was great. And she loved how I kind of put them together, so that was great, too. So that's awesome. I'm happy that you're happy. Luciana and Runetune talking about the memento mori. So remember we were looking at the one don't knows, and I think he called it memento mori.
00:04:43.748 - 00:05:20.764, Speaker A: And I was sort of wondering out loud what that meant. We looked it up. Rune tune has come in to fill the gap here. Memento Mori, as you're referencing in the one don't know's work, is an artistic trope that symbolizes or serves as a reminder of our own mortality, or more specifically, as the inevitability of our death. A human skull is the most obvious prominent motif used as a memento mori. But my favorite example of a memento mori is in the work of Hans Holbein the Younger, who used it anamorphically in a work titled the Ambassadors, which I believe you referenced in the artist's journal recently. We did.
00:05:20.764 - 00:05:47.084, Speaker A: In that painting, the skull looks like a quill feather pen, but cryptically its perspective is warped anamorphic perspective, so that if viewed from the appropriate angle, you'd see a skull. So I brought that up. So here it is. So I think I've seen this. I'm not sure which museum. I think it's in a major museum, maybe the Vatican, but I can't remember. We can look it up another time.
00:05:47.084 - 00:06:26.894, Speaker A: But the idea with anamorphic perspective, which I'm kind of learning from rune tune here, is depending on where you're standing in the room, if you stand in the right place, the skull looks normal. Okay. But if you stand straight on, as we are right now, then it looks really warped. So this is anamorphic perspective here. Hans Holbein the younger, I believe he said, also tooke swayed in, which was fascinating. And he sent me a message and I asked him if I could share what he was saying, and he was talking about his process, and he said, you're right, it is AI that I'm using. And then he said, I'm using mid journey and chat GPT.
00:06:26.894 - 00:07:18.754, Speaker A: And I was like, chat GPT? Like. And we have discussed this a little bit of using chat GPT for prompts with Santiago in the first or second spaces that we did, but he uses chat GPT for all the text, like whether it's the prompt, the title, the description, all of it. And then he was saying he also uses a lot of, I believe it was like layers where he, or versions, and he'll show, take his favorite parts of each version and kind of mix everything together. So very interesting. Thank you, Tuks, for sharing that, and thank you for being gracious enough to let me share that with everybody, because think about that chat GPT as part of the prompt. So prompt engineering at work here and look at the fantastic results. So pretty wild stuff.
00:07:18.754 - 00:07:50.130, Speaker A: Beautiful work. So Tez quake Aid continues. So I've released a work and you can pick up an 808 sketch, two for two tezos here, and I've already 48 gone, which is fabulous here. Just released it last night, so that is thrilling. And there are a ton more here. Look at this beautiful work by oxine he raised. I think it was an edition of 100 for 40, so I guess 4000 tezos, which is probably like $4,500, you know, $4,400, something like that.
00:07:50.130 - 00:08:12.882, Speaker A: And it's a really moving work, actually. It looks like a broken computer crying is what it looks like to me. I found it quite moving. So a beautiful work here now on secondary for 70. And Ilay also put out a work, and I'm just taking. I can't cover all of them, but look at this stunning work by aile here. And I love the edge here.
00:08:12.882 - 00:08:54.800, Speaker A: So a nice. Looks like an AI artwork of flowers, tulips, flowers for turkey. And she also did another one for Syria buy for only a Tezos edition of 30. And so, yeah, if you want to do it yourself as an artist, it's quite nice because, you know, artists usually have no money, at least traditionally. And so here is a way that, you know, us as artists can give. So go to Tezquacade, click on this link here, and that'll bring you here, and it'll give you instructions on how to mint on objects. So, and I went through the process, and basically what you do is you mint like normal.
00:08:54.800 - 00:09:29.534, Speaker A: I put the royalty to this address here, and then once you've minted and all the instructions are here, then you go to actions and you'll see if nothing's been listed or anything. You'll see a button that says advanced sale. And that's where you can put in that address again. So that is how you do it. That is how you can just give, by giving your time. You can raise money for people who are in desperate need of it. The news stories are heart wrenching, as I keep saying here.
00:09:29.534 - 00:09:49.470, Speaker A: And you keep seeing more and more of them. So anyways, so here are some more ways you can help Mec TXT with an addition of 100. And so I think he was selling for seven. So 700 tezos raised. Beautiful work here stitching fischers. And here Strano was. This was like full screen.
00:09:49.470 - 00:10:22.636, Speaker A: Friday, Tez quakeaid a community initiative to support those affected by the recent earthquake. Show it to my friends below for the live improv. And you see how great it looks on the screen here. And so everybody kind of chipping in a little bit. See if we can you see that work by Kareem? I think so. Very cool. So Strano and friends also helping out there.
00:10:22.636 - 00:10:42.950, Speaker A: You can watch 4k here. And continuing on, also, Cato, whose work we just started looking at recently edition of 500 for atezos each. So serious money is being raised here, ladies and gentlemen. So congratulations to everyone. You are not powerless. You are not powerless. You are raising money.
00:10:42.950 - 00:11:02.446, Speaker A: Crack porcelain too by Daniel W. Another poetic work here. What looks like a. What is this? Turkish porcelain vase. And 100% of proceeds going to tezquake aid. Here's another one by Sabato. Fragile composition.
00:11:02.446 - 00:11:28.604, Speaker A: A glitch work seemingly from Sabato. And Sabato continues to show his versatility with all these different series. I love that. Fragile compositions again goes to Tez, quake eight. And of course, manital with a beautiful cat, pixel artwork, a moment of hope. And this is an edition of 100 for only 77 tazo cents. So very good deal there for a good cause.
00:11:28.604 - 00:12:02.354, Speaker A: So there is a lot of. And there's many, many more, as many of you know. Check this out. I don't know, probably some of you have seen this. I found this pretty interesting. I mean, it sure got my attention. So Leonidas, NFT, who I think is a pretty prominent account, ordinals is basically super rare, but on bitcoin and where the images are stored fully on chain, the one of one culture is going to be epic.
00:12:02.354 - 00:12:43.352, Speaker A: So there is a new marketplace here. And here is like, I loaded it up here. And so you see, it's just like very, you know, and you're seeing people are getting their BTC. So it looks like NFT culture has finally, I mean, I don't know the history that well. So, you know, but as far as I understand, it feels like it finally landed on bitcoin. And the fact that it's all stored on chain is pretty fascinating. So I am just kind of waving a bit of a flag here and saying, this is super interesting because who doesn't want to mint on bitcoin? I would love to mint on bitcoin.
00:12:43.352 - 00:13:14.546, Speaker A: So anyways, ordinals.com and there's like a handbook and a wallet clock. So anyway, I'm not exactly sure how it all works, but it sounds pretty darn interesting. So this also happened too. And I feel like things are happening here in terms of curation in the space. So zip bomb curated by Martin Bruch and there are 31 nfts here. Kind of a lot of people like Venta and Skomra and just beautiful works.
00:13:14.546 - 00:13:35.118, Speaker A: Roccano. I've never seen this Roccano before. A really nice one. My friend Ben has done a work, a painting of these solitaire cards. So anyways, some really awesome work here. You got a sabato and also there was an RJ and a Sky Goodman also had a work here. Here's a Sky Goodman.
00:13:35.118 - 00:14:00.860, Speaker A: So anyways, and I think once RJ's work was posted here, then people started bidding on like, then there's like a bidding war. Where is it? It was here. I don't want to reload my computer, but there isn't. I think it's in the activity here. Yeah, you'll see computer and void at auction. And it went for thank you, anonymous collector of computer and void who picked it up for 0.66 ETH.
00:14:00.860 - 00:14:39.654, Speaker A: So RJ is on the way up here and thank you, Martin Burke, for curating the incredible zip bomb world and so much amazing art in one place. Agreed. So this is. I could see this becoming more and more popular, and I think foundation, I assume anybody can just curate on foundation right now. So again, that kind of open door policy is working quite well for foundation, and I think they're kind of ahead of the game. Like, if you're a curator in Web three, there haven't been a ton of options for you. And I think with foundation here, you're starting to get some options.
00:14:39.654 - 00:15:08.700, Speaker A: And so I just want to show you the bidding war here for RJ's work. So this David Hockney inspired work, look at this. Pablo Punkasso ended up taking it at the end. And for 66. And again, there's a bidding war again for an RJ. So congrats to RJ and Pablo Punkasso. And here is the Roccano.
00:15:08.700 - 00:15:26.724, Speaker A: Here's the beautiful Roccano here. So one of our gradient artists that we like to look at here, as I like to call them. And so, really nice composition. This is from December, this is Venta. Computer says no. And this is, you know, an hour left in the auction. There's already a bid.
00:15:26.724 - 00:16:04.764, Speaker A: So all to say, I think object should get on. That is sort of my personal opinion on it, because I just think it's such a great way to sell work. I think that's how people want to be sold in a lot of ways, is just like a regular art show. They want a curated exhibit. Because back to this idea of why was I putting together the genres of digital art? Is because of the chaos and confusion that happens when you arrive on somewhere, like object and you don't know where to start, and you see 20 different genres and you don't know how to make sense of it. Curation is another way to make sense of it. This is a beautiful work, by the way, by Venta.
00:16:04.764 - 00:16:48.410, Speaker A: And here is Venta again. And we're going to see more curation in a second here. We're on the foundation front page. So foundation very wisely, in my opinion, is pushing their curation. Zip Bomb is jam packed with incredible artworks by masterful artists, all offering a unique view into a world of digital art with a capital d. Please come see it for yourself. Now, one question that was raised in my head is, do you even need to ask the artists if you're deciding to curate their work? Because I could see it where potentially you might not need to, and maybe that's a better scenario, but it kind of raises some interesting questions, maybe you don't want to be curated in certain areas or whatever.
00:16:48.410 - 00:17:38.927, Speaker A: So interesting, right? And here's some more example of curation. So this has been happening on Nifty Gateway for a few months now, maybe two or three months, but it kind of is back to this idea that I think this is just going to become more common. So chapter four, where to play, dare to play. And I was looking at this work and the artist was saying, it's on Nifty Gateway, and it's part of this curation here, right? And it's sort of like, this is a really simple way. This is kind of user friendly, I would say, somewhat unlike the kind of metaverse ones where you have to hit k and Y and the spacebar and whatever just to see anything. Nothing against those platforms, but this is so much easier as a collector. You come in and you know exactly what to do and how much, and it takes no time.
00:17:38.927 - 00:18:06.636, Speaker A: You can just go reptilian and go, okay, playroom looks great. That's dollar 49, and you can decide in less than 10 seconds what you want to do. So anyways, I just kind of also just kind of flagging this a little bit. And it's good for sales, seemingly. It's good for the artists. I mean, Roccano, that work was from December 31 or something. So also for older works, coming back into the mix is kind of another interesting way of thinking about it.
00:18:06.636 - 00:18:26.076, Speaker A: Boo boy GM. Everyone woke up and found that there was a minted seven editions. So this is from Nifty Gateway. Really? Thank you. I will know who collects it when it ends. So excited and thanks in advance if you see this post playroom minting, available for 37 hours on Nifty Gateway. So just very interesting mechanics here onto digital painting here.
00:18:26.076 - 00:18:48.764, Speaker A: So rare force one or rare put out a stunning painting. This is a digital painting and it is stunning. The execution here. And this is based on Britain Rivieres painting resquiet from 1888. Maybe we should look that up quickly. Hopefully we don't crash the computer here. Let's just see.
00:18:48.764 - 00:19:03.584, Speaker A: Gently, gently. You can see it here. Yeah. So here the dog, and the dog is here. And so you can see the comparison. I kind of like the light in rares a little bit better. It's a little brighter.
00:19:03.584 - 00:19:24.010, Speaker A: So not a direct. It's not just a direct transcription here. He did a beautiful job on here. So I assume this will be available soon on, I assume super rare, but I guess we shall see. Beautiful, beautiful. A new one from myth. And so this was an edition of ten for 50.
00:19:24.010 - 00:19:46.516, Speaker A: So for quite, you know, so upping the prices here. I mean, 100% deservingly. And still, he's only getting 500 tezos for his work. And, you know, myth has earned his way up here. So, anyways, interesting mysterious piece as usual. See, the eye kind of seems to be wandering off a bit here. Almost looks like two myths or even three.
00:19:46.516 - 00:20:07.080, Speaker A: And is that the myth, too? And then the naked woman in the blood and another person that looks like they've been murdered. And these little guys. Homunculi. Is that what you'd call them in the cigarettes? So, anyways, it looks like an ambitious work. And the architectural setting is quite interesting, too. Again, always kind of semi surreal here. And you see it kind of goes down there.
00:20:07.080 - 00:20:24.912, Speaker A: The wall kind of dips down. Super interesting work from myth. So very cool. Bzaya with a new work here. And this lo fi Steve. So this is an actor. I mean, is it Steve Buscemi? I'm not a great movie guy.
00:20:24.912 - 00:20:46.004, Speaker A: So it looks like no Steve, no party here. And so just a cool work by Bezaya. I didn't see it minted anywhere. I looked, and I couldn't find it. And almost like a Pepe Steve here. And so anyway, just fun and cool as usual. Dancontrol with kind of like a Magritte feeling piece.
00:20:46.004 - 00:21:26.124, Speaker A: Hey, kind of looks like a crime scene, this red wine here. And interesting, you know, playing with the repetition here again, of the glass, putting it for the first time, I can remember in a architectural space that is not just a line horizon, but more of like a three dimensional or, you know, indoor interior. So just kind of interesting. Almost again, a Magritte, even loosely, loosely de Chirico feel. Nice gradient there. So you see it continue to evolve with Dan control crime scene. And here's a one of one.
00:21:26.124 - 00:21:55.882, Speaker A: No bids? And you can get a one of one dan control for 30 tezos right now. And you can see the megaphones here. So a really nice work here, too. So, anyways, interesting work from Dan control. And look at this, Santiago. This looks like representational, doesn't it? And Santiago, of course, does a lot of abstract work, but I'm really digging this work. I mean, it looks like someone's lungs and like a body and just, you know, things, maybe some tubes flowing into it.
00:21:55.882 - 00:22:19.446, Speaker A: Gorgeous, gorgeous textures here and gorgeous colors. So very, very interesting work from Santiago. This sold out edition of 21. Music from the background of nature before and after time happened. Prompt to image tools. Inkscape, which I don't know what that is like maybe that's how he's getting these gorgeous textures here. Digital textures is what I'm seeing here.
00:22:19.446 - 00:22:39.582, Speaker A: Okay. Like, beautiful digital textures. Png and gimp, of course. So cool work here. More digital textures here, courtesy of Ed Marolla Monster Tales. And here you see kind of the blurred out pixels, as usual, and just a wild monster from Ed's imagination. Someone reading.
00:22:39.582 - 00:23:12.464, Speaker A: And it's almost like, I want to think this is almost, I think, what you call simultaneous narrative or it's not even quite like that, where multiple scenes are happening in the same painting. You see it in renaissance painting sometimes. But this, the way I want to read this is this person who's reading. This is what's occurring in that book. And then there's this strange, unusual structure here with someone sitting over top and the frame that bleeds into the image almost like a dream. Beautiful. Very interesting work.
00:23:12.464 - 00:23:37.644, Speaker A: Buy for Fortezos Monster Tales edition of 25. And another a one of elementals. So again, so this sold for 85 tezos. Pretty reasonable for an Ed Marola. One of one. And just, again, more interesting textures and elements, some city elements and whatnot. And again, almost blurred out over here in a different way.
00:23:37.644 - 00:24:07.718, Speaker A: Anyways, very interesting. Interesting colors, too. Authentic waffles with a few more pfps here, or neats, as they're being called. And these went for auction, and they kind of went for pretty reasonable prices, I'd say. And again, I'm wondering if this is Mario paint that they're using, because this looks like a Mario star. And these awesome, awesome textures here, I have a few, like, maybe this is Mario paint. PFP.
00:24:07.718 - 00:24:22.874, Speaker A: And let's just see what it went for. 25 to Santiago, neat. 113. Another, again, kind of has an expressionist look. Went to ilay for 17. Pretty reasonable. Again, looks like Mario paint or something, I'm guessing.
00:24:22.874 - 00:24:38.248, Speaker A: Here's another one. And you see that repeated thing, but it's just gorgeous how rich these textures are. Again, digital textures. Neat. 112. And so, anyways, more beautiful work. Let's just see what this went for.
00:24:38.248 - 00:24:54.804, Speaker A: One of one's 25 to Santiago. And this one was gorgeous too. Slightly different background. And this looks like a self portrait. This went to fangers for 71. So pretty cool. This went for 35.
00:24:54.804 - 00:25:20.462, Speaker A: Again, gorgeous textures in here. And you even get the movement. I'm not sure if you can see that, but there's movement in the, you know, in the texture of the face here. So just incredibly interesting, as usual. And again, just having that expressionist look and feel to it. So beautiful, beautiful work from authentic waffles went for 14. Only 14 tezos.
00:25:20.462 - 00:25:37.724, Speaker A: One of one. Eizo is wrapping up the furniture series. Today's drop will be the last edition piece. He's going to be putting out some one of ones. I saw him just right. But from tomorrow's home furnishings collection for a while. So the last edition pieces for a while.
00:25:37.724 - 00:25:58.038, Speaker A: Next week, I'll list a handful of one of ones. And at the end of the week, I'll mint a ten of ten to airdrop to the biggest holders of the series. And this was great here. Last but not least, thanks to pokebelly for shouting out the series so much. I think you may have actually mentioned every piece. I think you might be right. And your kind words brought a smile to my face each day.
00:25:58.038 - 00:26:11.374, Speaker A: So happy to help, Eizo. And it's a rad, rad series. So, yeah, thanks for helping fill the show with rad content. And here is the latest. Is this desk here? Future desk. You can still get it for nine. And.
00:26:11.374 - 00:26:35.178, Speaker A: Yeah, like, I mean, look at how much he put out, too. And there's another page of this stuff. So totally awesome. You can still get this. This is the new one. And just gorgeous. Again, this rich textures, right? And it's interesting to talk about texture on a digital surface because of course it's flat, right? But I'm just seeing texture everywhere.
00:26:35.178 - 00:26:53.366, Speaker A: Nature's distortion. Zero, zero, one. So more glitched work. This is from Glitch David, whose work is very affordable. And this is an edition of 15, I think I saw this on Twitter. And a gif created with MPEG, 25 megabytes, 136 frames. Buy for two tezos.
00:26:53.366 - 00:27:25.124, Speaker A: And here's another artist, I'm not sure if we've looked at them, Jada Tez with some more glitch work here. God, that just fills the screen beautifully here. And so it looks like it's designed exactly for the ratio of my screen here. So anyways, just more interesting. Beautiful video art. Glitch video art made with live coding using Hydra and analog process in real time with a panasonic aave five and color pattern generator. Buy for three edition of 15.
00:27:25.124 - 00:27:46.486, Speaker A: You could just collect the glitch video work and have a beautiful collection on tasos, the Internet by Kurt Hussle collective. A beautiful Gif here. A mysterious gift. I don't think he sent it out to anybody yet. Or they have sent it out to anybody. So again, playing with glitch video and kind of retro computers here. Let's just take a look.
00:27:46.486 - 00:28:08.980, Speaker A: Often he plays, they play with the mechanics so maybe you buy a different work and you get this. I'm not sure. You'll have to keep tabs on that. Kristen Roose with four works here that are really interesting. And again, this seems to be video recording. A tv. RCA one grayscale palette shifting black and white.
00:28:08.980 - 00:28:30.704, Speaker A: RCA television, mp4. So let's just play this. So again, pretty interesting. A rich gray and these beautiful gradients that are kind of sliding down here. So just interesting. Playing with the static there too. I assume he's recording a tv.
00:28:30.704 - 00:28:46.874, Speaker A: And another one here. I think I brought up all four. So just gorgeous here. These are available for 20 tezos, I believe, if you can still get them. So very nice. Yeah. 20 tezos edition of 20.
00:28:46.874 - 00:29:23.468, Speaker A: And here is another one, RCA three. Almost looks like some of his other work, like these buildings, but like a variation and then fed into a tv. I don't even know how you would do that, but I'm sure these guys, I don't know anything about video and getting that stuff, but just to get your, let's say you made a work on Photoshop or, say, deluxe paint, and then you want to plug it into an RCA tv, I assume they know how to do that. Grayscale palette shifting also. So here's RCA four. We'll just play that. So more beautiful, beautiful work.
00:29:23.468 - 00:29:48.724, Speaker A: Again, we're kind of back to these rich digital textures here. I mean, you see it in these pixels. There's something reminiscent of the authentic waffles that we just saw. So something's going on out there. Kodoneka Zono with another interesting abstract here with the pixelated background and kind of like the biomorphic organic front. Buy for ten tezos edition of eleven. Beautiful.
00:29:48.724 - 00:30:07.592, Speaker A: And someone, another artist I haven't seen before, found on Twitter. Joy K. Think gogolitis may have retweeted this. Electrify. So just an interesting gif here. An abstract, digital abstract gif buy for ten edition of 22. And native ed with a new work.
00:30:07.592 - 00:30:25.446, Speaker A: New model. Very cool work here. Kind of feels like something Sci-Fi futuristic. And anyway, interesting. Is this a gif? Like, I mean, yeah, this is a Gif buy for 18, edition of 20. So this is on secondary. Let's just look at the primary.
00:30:25.446 - 00:30:41.974, Speaker A: You could have got it for ten. So pretty cool gif is what I have to say on that. Very cool popple with some new work. A new, I guess, monster from the sanitarium. Lord of Mandrake. An awesome title. No big surprise there.
00:30:41.974 - 00:30:59.544, Speaker A: And so beautiful work here. They're very popular as well. Buy for nine edition of 25. So there's 13 left. This was just released. And here you can read the poem of the Lord of Mandrake. So very nice work from popple.
00:30:59.544 - 00:31:15.804, Speaker A: Web three city. I've never seen this artist before either. Notorious man XTZ edition of ten. I think this sold out on primary. I've seen in the tweet. Just interesting pixel art is, you know, it looks like a city. Very interesting pixel art.
00:31:15.804 - 00:31:44.204, Speaker A: So weird, like horizontal, hard horizontal composition. Very cool. Web three cities. And also, I think gogolitis sent me this the other day, or one of Green Ginger's work, liquidation. And so just to kind of playing with the city theme here as well. And pixel art. And I guess this is more of a 3d, has a 3d feel to it.
00:31:44.204 - 00:32:03.586, Speaker A: And here are some others. So geometric wonderland and also kind of in those same palette and style. And here is the whole series here. Team of two self taught pixel artists. So there are two pixel artists here, green Ginger. So that is cool. A cool collaboration.
00:32:03.586 - 00:32:29.434, Speaker A: Adventure through the unknown. And Manidal has a new tarot card from the cat tarot. And so this is the lovers. And we have two beautiful cats here. And even seemingly Adam and Eve kind of reference, or a biblical reference with the snake in the garden and the apple tree. And here you have an angel on top, the 6th card of the tarot. And so there it is.
00:32:29.434 - 00:32:45.854, Speaker A: Can you still get it? No. Was it for sale? Not yet. So maybe you can put an offer in. Check their twitter feed if you want more info on that. This was an interesting work I saw on twitter too. Pixel quests, work in progress. Awaiting your return.
00:32:45.854 - 00:33:06.624, Speaker A: Just kind of an interesting work here. So anyways, I just thought I'd share it. Some interesting pixel art from pixel quests. And there's gogolitis. I see the talent there a lot. So yeah, we're learning a lot from gogolitis feed. Again, looking forward to Wednesday, to delving deeper into everything pixel art and more.
00:33:06.624 - 00:33:33.352, Speaker A: Look at this. Another interesting artist to Nana. So just more interesting abstract illustrated work here, with some interesting textures here as well. So very cool. And this is on, I think, exchange art, which is Solana. And also another one from Antonio loves, who we just are more than happy to show here. Angel, saints, prophets, apocalyptic beast.
00:33:33.352 - 00:34:05.408, Speaker A: So another kind of surreal work with some legs that turn into heads and then a skull. So very experimental. And some nice textures here, and some beautiful colors. And also another new artist that I haven't seen before, Emily M? Ree heaven or Las Vegas. So again, playing with three headed woman here. And just interesting, kind of has an eastern feel to it, but with palm trees and a spider web. So very cool form function.
00:34:05.408 - 00:34:20.354, Speaker A: So Solana is not dead. It's like another kind of takeaway here. Solana is not dead. Flora Marquez with another work here. A couple of works here. Buy for 30. So this is Mister Dimitri.
00:34:20.354 - 00:34:39.784, Speaker A: Just looking for a quick two x here. So you can actually get a flora Marquez for pretty cheap one of one with some color in it here. And there's another one. And I'm just loving what she's putting out here. I dreamt about many people who are already dead. And this one is gone to hen farmer. So very cool.
00:34:39.784 - 00:35:01.596, Speaker A: Another new artist intro. Void is the artist vaniteas number one. And I believe digital painting and collaged AI. Very big file, 6000 by 5000. So again, combining painting and AI. So it looks pretty interesting. Could hang very well with Venta's work.
00:35:01.596 - 00:35:25.764, Speaker A: And yeah, it looks like, again, the skull, almost the memento mori. But this is a vanitas. So we're learning a little bit of latin here throughout the show. And Sabato with a very interesting experimental series here. Gif. I mean, I don't know how he comes up with this stuff, but yeah, you basically see a room in glass. And I think he calls it like a video game.
00:35:25.764 - 00:35:43.228, Speaker A: It looks like a mention of the Super bowl is kind of being said here. So just very unusual. Gif here. Totally original series here. And normalization facility. The offshore firm volume too. So totally cryptic.
00:35:43.228 - 00:36:02.300, Speaker A: This might be burnt. This could be a variation, but it looks like Sabato is thinking about the Super bowl. Anyways, check that out. And also, John Cates, I think Sabato retweeted this too. I'm positive he did. Very interesting. And he mentioned John Cates on a Twitter spaces a few weeks ago.
00:36:02.300 - 00:36:18.572, Speaker A: And sounds like. I don't know too much about John Cates, but this is a pretty cool work. And I think he knows a lot about glitch. The artificially illustrated glitch. Western primer for machine learners. So anyways, edition of five. This was available for five when it came out.
00:36:18.572 - 00:36:45.178, Speaker A: Now it's 55 55. Cool work. And continuing on with some AI and some music. So this is Luca. Sensual seduction and kind of. And yeah, just an interesting mix of what looks like an AI record cover with some music. So shout out to Luca.
00:36:45.178 - 00:37:01.594, Speaker A: I think I saw them tweet out that they wanted to be on this program and I thought, no problem. That's a beautiful. You've given me every excuse in the world, Luca. To put this on if it is the same. Luca. Anyways, cool work. Cool looking AI work there, too.
00:37:01.594 - 00:37:24.296, Speaker A: Check out mother Louisiane. Error vertical. So I believe this is AI as well. And I'm going to go deeper in the series here. But very good looking AI. And here is mother Louisiane on foundation. And look at this work here, created with AI.
00:37:24.296 - 00:37:57.910, Speaker A: So these look like collage works or something with maybe some gouache painting. But these are AI works. So super cool. They look great and they are selling. So, yeah, Pablo Puncaso also picked that one up, so they're on a buying spree. And then finally in the AI section here, a strange thing with some more beautiful work here. So again, doing the AI fashion and combining it with, like, Renaissance architecture, you can almost see it here.
00:37:57.910 - 00:38:15.254, Speaker A: So it's a brilliant combination. And he continues to just, like, pump out the beautiful images here. And so I was even looking on his instagram. I mean, he was in vogue business, which is vogue. He was in vogue. So strange thing. Continues to do very, very well.
00:38:15.254 - 00:38:31.930, Speaker A: And I mean, look at the 2000 likes. So he's doing beautifully, deservedly. Like, look at this. Great glasses. I mean, very prolific and doing a wonderful job here. Beautiful suitcase, Nike energy. And finally, Charles AI.
00:38:31.930 - 00:39:10.530, Speaker A: So this is a strange one. I can't make this bigger, but the reason is because this is a dynamic NFT, and it's basically, according to your time of day, is how the sun is in the sky and the light. So I guess at night it's dark, I assume. And so this went for five ETH, $7,400 on super rare. So congrats to Charles AI, and I quite liked what he wrote here. The Greco roman style of the piece refers to the fact that artists and collectors alike are currently actively participating in the Renaissance 2.0, which will reshape the art world as we know it.
00:39:10.530 - 00:39:46.978, Speaker A: But just this, almost, this mixing, I think artists and collectors are becoming increasingly mixed together. We're seeing artists collecting like never before, and we're seeing collectors making art like never before. So anyways, interesting piece. And, you know, Charles AI takes some flack from people, but you have to give him credit. I mean, he's trying out new things, you know? So, yeah, so I continue to enjoy his innovations here. Marina Amidova with some new work here. And this is also on Nifty Gateway.
00:39:46.978 - 00:40:21.106, Speaker A: Some more curation here. And, you know, beautiful work from Marina here with almost that twins type theme, or, you know, two people, two kids, and also sum stay awake. A beautiful work here. I want to call it painterly AI work of someone in their studio here. And just kind of a very nice work, edition of 100 buy for one tezos. So very affordable there. And finally, Shilly, the kid sent me this and I thought it was quite beautiful.
00:40:21.106 - 00:40:43.012, Speaker A: Dal E. I mean, it has a real kind of like deep, like almost like Monet and Syrah, but its own thing, it actually retains originality, I think. So a really interesting work there, shili. Thanks for sending that. It's beautiful meadow. Very interesting. And finally, a couple more here.
00:40:43.012 - 00:41:03.320, Speaker A: Data velvet with kind of that japanese. I don't know if I'd call it screen, but kind of a eastern, let's call it that kind of look to it and feel. And a beautiful, beautiful work. Anyways, I think this sold. So another new discovery here, 0.44 ETH. That's pretty good.
00:41:03.320 - 00:41:24.144, Speaker A: And again, it looks like, yeah, data velvet times AI. So maybe a little bit of playing around with the AI, a little bit of editing the AI. And here's another beautiful work. This is also by someone who's like, oh, it would be great if Pokebelly put me on the program. And I just saw them write that. So I was like, oh, I'll take a look. And they have this beautiful work here.
00:41:24.144 - 00:41:39.036, Speaker A: So this is viritur. Viratur art. Good night. Place where the moon sleeps. And so anyways, I'm thrilled that you want to be on the show. And look at how beautiful this is. So anyways, big shout out to Vivator.
00:41:39.036 - 00:42:03.188, Speaker A: Vivator. And I have another one by them, actually. Look at how interesting this is. Good night. So again, the depth here, this is a curators like, and I'm not a curator. I do it accidentally every morning here. But this is, it should be every curator's stream because there is so much talent out there and so much that's happening digitally on the blockchain here.
00:42:03.188 - 00:42:30.318, Speaker A: And now you even have the tools with nifty gateway and even foundation. Like, again, I don't even know if you have to ask, like, because if you don't, I almost think you shouldn't have to ask. And then you can just put, put whatever together that you want it, you know? So anyway, so here's some physical work. Mark Belden and I've been noticing their work for a while. I really enjoy it. It is gouache on St. Armand paper and kind of has this neon feel.
00:42:30.318 - 00:43:01.002, Speaker A: I'm not quite sure how they get such a rich pink here on this paper, but they managed to do it. Mark Belden and, yeah, here's more look at this great flowers here. Just beautiful. We may have looked at this one before, but anyways, just really nice work. And another one from Bruno Miguel's studio, whose work we've also been looking at. And kind of a clue because I thought they were painting in the background here of all these other works. But it looks like they're taking these kind of old rugs and painting on top of them.
00:43:01.002 - 00:43:14.272, Speaker A: So here you go. So very experimental and very cool. Just love the contrast here. Really, really nice work. And again, making it look easy. Good. Thanks for everyone for joining me.
00:43:14.272 - 00:43:16.704, Speaker A: And until next time, take care.
