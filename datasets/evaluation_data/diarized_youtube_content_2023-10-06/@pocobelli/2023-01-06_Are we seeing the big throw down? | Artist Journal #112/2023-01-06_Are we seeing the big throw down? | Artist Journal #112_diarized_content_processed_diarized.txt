00:00:06.680 - 00:00:50.006, Speaker A: An endless supply of imagination has once again crossed my desk here. Welcome back, everyone. Artist Journal, January 6, 2023, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back, everyone. Here we go, Twitter discovery. And by the way, thank you for all the retweets yesterday of the post and everything, actually, and the work that was purchased, which we'll look at in a second. But first, clearly here, I think the artist's name is true face.
00:00:50.006 - 00:01:40.952, Speaker A: True face, a new discovery here on Twitter, clearly a reference to the last judgment by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel. And of course, as far as I remember, and we can actually look this up before I start lecturing on things that I haven't researched, but from memory, the last judgment was painted many years later, after the sealing. He was brought back. And it was kind of a darker work, clearly the last judgment, you know, Jesus condemning people to hell and other people to heaven. And I, I think it was after the sack of Rome. Okay, so it's pretty amazing. Like, we've been talking about this, this idea of art almost.
00:01:40.952 - 00:02:51.994, Speaker A: You'd never know, right, that the politics and the, what's going on in the world, as I keep on saying, you know, what bear market, you know, in Renaissance painting, you could have probably said the same thing and all to just kind of, as we kind of increase and expand our conversation, never knowing where it will go on a daily basis here, just kind of, again, we were talking about how in the sixties, would you have known in the rock and roll movement that JFK was assassinated between I want to hold your hand being released and help, you know, like that sort of thing, or the Rolling Stones, like, would you have been able to tell maybe with rubber soul you might have started to, you know, maybe the. Again, that loss of innocence and maybe in the last judgment, we do see a shift once we do know if I'm right. We'll take a quick look here. First, let's look at this, and then we'll look at the original really quickly just so that we can compare and contrast. Really interesting kind of work here, though. I brought it up big. And actually this is their page of true face, who again, I'd never heard of before.
00:02:51.994 - 00:03:24.162, Speaker A: And kind of an interesting method as well. Beautiful title. An anthropology of love. That is a great title. Method AI, personal data set and training model. So perhaps this person knows how to program AI. A lot of these AI programmers are doing art because they're kind of like, they probably could read the tea leaves ten years ago, five years ago, that this was going to become a thing and that this produces images.
00:03:24.162 - 00:04:25.194, Speaker A: Continuing on digital post production post production poem made by AI text generator so here's the poem again. True face probably AI generated name anthropology of love is probably an AI generated title, I am guessing, and kind of interesting to look up close. I mean, it's a little fuzzy, a touch fuzzy. I think the concept is retained, but almost what I want to get at here is kind of looks kind of plant like, like there's almost like a garden. These bodies have been turned into a garden, but it's not high resolution enough to kind of see like that this would be a red leaf or whatever. So which is kind of interesting in itself. Like, I don't say when it's fuzzy that that's necessarily in our very open minded world where pixel art can be blurred, which we're going to see again in this episode.
00:04:25.194 - 00:05:18.050, Speaker A: We don't assume that just because things are JPEG distorted or artifacts, if there's JPEG artifacts, that these are necessarily bad things are not on purpose, but lest we get distracted here. So anyways, just kind of an interesting image, you know, and so I wanted to look at it and of course, from a distance we all recognize that, right? And so, and here are other works which seem to be riffing off of art history, at least these last few, or at least kind of religious imagery. This almost looks eastern. Interesting titles, totem and taboo, of course, referencing the Freud book. So anyways, interesting artists, true face, interesting AI. And let's very quickly, Sistine Chapel, last judgment. Let's see if they give us a quick history.
00:05:18.050 - 00:05:57.026, Speaker A: Since I'm lecturing on things I haven't researched again, let's just see it is, okay, Wikipedia, just for. So here is okay. So we can even do the comparison here, you know, quite different, but quite similar. And you know what's funny? I didn't recognize that this was part of the architecture. I thought this was new. So it's interesting how the architecture fits in to that AI work. But anyways, yeah, so here, yeah, so kind of seen as a darker work.
00:05:57.026 - 00:06:31.410, Speaker A: And let's just actually go back. So anyways, here, you know, and it's anybody who hasn't been to Rome yet, you must go to Rome and you must go to this room. If you are an art aficionado, you have to go to this room. And maybe that's where I remember I was probably, you know, and there's a ton of tour guides. And of course this is supposed to be finally a, if I can find it again, a self portrait of Michelangelo. Again, the darkness. Right.
00:06:31.410 - 00:07:06.210, Speaker A: So again, this idea between current events and how it kind of bleeds into the art, but if you don't know the current event, it might not be obvious. Right. So, yeah, let's see if we can just quickly find. I'm trying to keep these down to 25 minutes. I'm gonna end up 25 minutes on the first image. Let's just see fresco by Michelangelo covering the whole altar wall of the Sistine chapel in Vatican City, a depiction of the second coming and the final and eternal judgment by God of all humanity. Okay.
00:07:06.210 - 00:07:45.522, Speaker A: The work. The work took four years to complete between 1536 and 1541. So four years preparation of the altar wall began in 1535. Michelangelo began working on it 25 years after having finished the Sistine Chapel. 25 years. So you just think of the difference in mindset. Right? And again, we think of that supposed self portrait that we're just looking at, and he was nearly 67 at its completion.
00:07:45.522 - 00:08:17.756, Speaker A: So he started this, my friends, never lose hope. He started this when he was 63 or 62. Let's say. He had originally accepted the commission from Pope Clement VII, but it was completed under Pope Paul III, whose stronger, reforming views probably affected the final treatment. Right. And there's apparently in the original, Christ was naked and they painted on the. Would you call that a sash or whatever that is? The cloth.
00:08:17.756 - 00:08:41.360, Speaker A: Afterwards, it got much praise and criticism. Description. I just want to see as far as the sacking of Rome, if that sack. No, it's sacred. Okay, anyways, I'm getting off. Let me just look up the year. So this is 1536 to 1541.
00:08:41.360 - 00:09:03.444, Speaker A: Let's just look up quickly. The sack of Rome, 1527. Okay, you see that? 1527. And it was painted. So in between, Rome was sacked. Okay. So, yeah, so anyways, we're getting off topic here, but in between.
00:09:03.444 - 00:09:18.124, Speaker A: So it's a different, darker time in the Renaissance. Continuing on. True face. Cool work. So, anyways, thank you. I released this sketch yesterday. I'm trying to just release more work.
00:09:18.124 - 00:09:34.270, Speaker A: I'm going to try and release another one today. And thank you to all these collectors here who bought and even sold on secondary. So that was awesome. Thank you very much. That warms my heart very much. So. That was great.
00:09:34.270 - 00:09:52.042, Speaker A: 808 sketch. And a reference, of course, to the TR 808 drum machine. Yeah. So I'm probably gonna put out another sketch today. It's already done, but I'm still, you know, looking it over. So, anyways, thank you, everyone. And quick comment here that I want to highlight.
00:09:52.042 - 00:10:29.054, Speaker A: I'm really into this ongoing discussion of defining pixel art, the genres are being defined and defended and challenged over here. Love it. So that's a comment from runetune, because Ed Marolla, again, chimed in yesterday with a definition of pixel art. So we're loving that. So, anyways, and thank you again for these very nice comments here. So, this is interesting. So, remember we were talking yesterday about how Charles AI made a fortune yesterday, but this was on his open edition, like, 48 grand.
00:10:29.054 - 00:10:55.964, Speaker A: This is interesting. Almost one and a half Ethan secondary sales. But I just realized I'm not getting royalties for every sale, only for about 30% of them. So this is an interesting issue because, oh, wasn't it done on manifold? Your contract before the day, et cetera, et cetera. I noticed on Opensea the royalties were shown as optional. I don't know why, but that's what is shown when you sell the piece. So.
00:10:55.964 - 00:11:27.692, Speaker A: So, yeah, so that explains it. So it looks to me like Charles AI did not set the. And the royalties. And I'm going to show you. So you need to do a setting here. The marketplace blocker manifold has this marketplace blocker feature, if you need to block marketplaces that don't pay you the royalties. So it looks to me.
00:11:27.692 - 00:12:13.680, Speaker A: So I went into manifold, and I went to one of my contracts here for the composites, which I did mint on a separate contract, which I'm loving again. These combine, you know, three or four images that you find in Google images and then combine it into one. So I was just, you know, just to mint that contract. So, getting into it, though, on chain royalties, so I put 10%. But you see here, Opensea royalties, Opensea will respect. So I think this needs to be enabled, and someone was calling it query, and that is the creator ownership research institute. So, not to get too far in the weeds, and that includes super rare and opensea.
00:12:13.680 - 00:12:40.300, Speaker A: But I think Charles AI needs to enable operator filter, if I'm not mistaken. I am definitely not an expert, but I think that's what's going on here, because I thought I'd be good. I did my contract here, but it is not enabled. So I think you need to enable that. Speaking of making a ton of coin and just doing overall fabulous, I don't know if you were watching this. I was watching this. I mean, it was something to behold.
00:12:40.300 - 00:13:00.620, Speaker A: So uxing scrolled to death. It was taking offers. He was taking offers till 06:00 p.m. His time. And wait until you see how much these went for. Basically, the accepted offers for this edition of ten. Okay.
00:13:00.620 - 00:13:35.784, Speaker A: An addition of ten 569 was the lowest and 666 was the highest. So basically, you weren't getting this work for less than 569 tezos for this edition of ten. So axin rakes in, you know, 5500 tezos. Basically $5,000. It was probably like 5800 tezos or something, whatever it was. That is something else. So anyways, big congrats to uxine.
00:13:35.784 - 00:14:01.744, Speaker A: And you know what it made me think of? Well, actually, I'll get to that in a second. Just looking at the secondary here. And hopefully this doesn't. Okay. 23, 60, 32, 235. And this is what I wanted to show you, though, this 16. 9444.
00:14:01.744 - 00:14:30.056, Speaker A: But this is an addition of ten that went for 1690 tezos yesterday. So 500, 300. This is all eight in the last 8 hours. Okay, so 620 edition of 13. So all pretty interesting, old and new. And again, this is the last 15, 16 hours. So pretty amazing.
00:14:30.056 - 00:14:48.040, Speaker A: This is the work that went for five. How much did it go for? 4569 tezos last night. This is an edition of one. So another. He sold one last night or the night before for, I think, 5000. And then did another one for these, one of ones on Tezos. And these are older.
00:14:48.040 - 00:15:20.254, Speaker A: These are from July. So, you know, when you go to Euxine's page, I put offer high to low. And you see here offers 575 and no takers. Okay. Offer 500, 484, 75, 469. Like, people aren't taking so far as far as the most recent of this page. So anyways, I dug up this tweet from Robnis V two that I remember from August.
00:15:20.254 - 00:15:42.394, Speaker A: The big throwdowns on Tezos art prices really hasn't happened yet, but it will. Just takes a couple of stone cold gambler whales to make the leap and take one for the. And take one for the team on pieces they really love to acquire. That's how it was done in Ethereum. Same applies to Tezos. August 8, 2022. So, six months ago.
00:15:42.394 - 00:16:04.950, Speaker A: So my question is, are we seeing the big throwdown? Like, are. Is this. Is this what we're starting to see? Mech Txt making some nice sales, too. Secondary report. Seven massive scoops on secondary. So again, for his pixel art, 50 tezos. 35, 35, 25.
00:16:04.950 - 00:16:27.500, Speaker A: And when you go to his page, it's starting to get pretty sparse there too. So. And here are more you see, like. So again, if you're kind of tapping that nerve that the market wants, it's boom times here. As I was saying yesterday, a quick update on Santiago's work here. This went for 0.693 ETH.
00:16:27.500 - 00:16:46.844, Speaker A: So the first one went for 0.3. This one went for pretty much 0.7. So cool update there. So congrats to Santiago. A nice kind of trajectory there. It's great to make sales like that. And speaking again, like, I mean, more boom times here.
00:16:46.844 - 00:17:06.936, Speaker A: Acid boy with 44, minted at 0.08. I did the math here for us. Let me just dig it up. Let me just dig it up here. Three and a half ETH, 3.52 ETH. So a cool let's times 1204 thousand.
00:17:06.936 - 00:17:35.853, Speaker A: $224 on acid boy's open edition. And still open. So $4,200. Not bad. He also put this out, which is interesting. Vortex is a series of 50 unique nfts with rarities. So it's kind of reminiscent of PFP projects, isn't it? And it's kind of where generative art.
00:17:35.853 - 00:18:17.274, Speaker A: I mean, because they're kind of made the same way. Generative art and pfps, they are layers in Photoshop. Correct me if I'm wrong, that's what I've deduced is they are layers in Photoshop. And basically, you switch on and off the layers and you create, you know, and you feed it into the machine, into the script, and then it gives you your results. So you're kind of seeing generative art, but so normally you'd say, oh, well, this is generative art. But I think the way it's being sold is more reminiscent of a PFP project to me, a profile picture project. So isn't that interesting? So here they are.
00:18:17.274 - 00:18:40.424, Speaker A: And even just the way that they're kind of, again with this default image here where it gets you excited, which 01:00 a.m.. I going to get the rarity. And that exists with generative. But again, this feels more like a PFP. And I kind of like that. Even just the floors at .4 ETH, you know, again, it's got a pfp sort of feel to it.
00:18:40.424 - 00:19:17.202, Speaker A: And here's more acid boy, some stats for the vortex drop background type. Again, this feels like. And these same sort of details and traits are found on if you go to FX hash. But there's just something about it that feels more PFP ish, which I think is kind of fun, actually, because why not? Why should there be some border? And there's another one here by moonchild. Again, it feels like a PFP project over here. The floor is point one. Just the preview piece.
00:19:17.202 - 00:19:58.414, Speaker A: The fact that it's on Ethereum, say, rather than tezos, if this was an effects hash drop, I would say, oh, this is generative art, but I'm not sure if you can have this, like, moving preview image. And it's kind of like, from a purely pragmatic point of view, if you're going to do work like this. And again, this looks like there's a character here. I'm not sure it's tempting to do it on Ethereum because maybe you'll make more money just from a purely pragmatic point of view. I'm not sure. So that's going to be interesting. I'm going to try and remember to follow up on this because I want to see what these look like and I want to see what kind of happens.
00:19:58.414 - 00:20:28.854, Speaker A: Rare, who watches this program and retweets it sometimes. Much appreciated. Rare has a really cool work that he's been working on, Lamb of Boston Dynamics. And actually, I don't know if this is like a placeholder. Like, did he actually print this out and put it in a museum or, you know, gallery wall or. I'm not sure. It looks awesome, though, for a digital painting there he put some really interesting details in it.
00:20:28.854 - 00:20:53.074, Speaker A: The lamb of Boston dynamics, who takes the sin away from AI. A new painting finished last night. So anyways, here's a big version of it. And he actually goes into a pretty interesting write up. It's based. And we'll get back to the painting in a second, based on Francisco de Zubarin's paintings of the Lamb of God. Agnes de in Latin.
00:20:53.074 - 00:21:33.664, Speaker A: Luckily, I've seen the two most famous in person in Madrid at the Prado and at the San Diego Art Museum. So these are different versions. Okay. Kind of back to that idea of related images, or the, which is, you know what you're going to get in Google search results, like, so for me, I love this kind of stuff because it's even more confusing because if you did a search on this painting in Google images, you might think they're the same painting, but different photographers. But actually, in this case, they're actually two different versions by the same artist of the same painting. So anyways, so here are the references. And I'm not going to read everything, but I'm going to read some of it.
00:21:33.664 - 00:21:59.474, Speaker A: And I thought this was interesting. Initially, I was put off with the very organic bend that the lamb had to be in. Right. Because he's doing a robotic dog, easy for a living creature, difficult for something with a hard plastic and metal body, but found it kind of reminiscent of surrealist Dali painting. Of course, the melting watches from the persistence of memory here. So he kind of worked with it a little bit. So interesting.
00:21:59.474 - 00:22:34.322, Speaker A: And as he discusses here, another fun detail, how the lamb spot were tied up. A delicate lace to restrain the sacrifice. This was a very nice detail and beautifully painted here, I might add. So really doing some nice, just kind of digital, you know, traditional quote unquote painting. Very untraditional tools. And my favorite detail, especially in all those religious era paintings, the halo, you know, in case you didn't know, this was innocent and holy, just like spot. So there is rare's halo.
00:22:34.322 - 00:22:55.604, Speaker A: So it's interesting to compare as well. Okay. And finally, so he has a bit more here. I'm not going to go into all of it, but I thought I'd just do the comparison. So this is gonna be on, released on super rare today, I believe. So anyways, cool, interesting work. And cool work from rare.
00:22:55.604 - 00:23:12.124, Speaker A: Interesting write up too. I think that's really smart to actually do these kind of write ups. People love it. Gets collectors interested. Win win. Speaking of the Christ theme in our show today, I guess it's. That was.
00:23:12.124 - 00:23:47.664, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a bit of a christian or Christ theme, which is obviously huge in art history. And we have a hilarious kind of satirical take from Trez a Rodanx from one of my favorite series that he does, the failed artist part twelve. So let's. So kind of hilarious here, the failed artist with fries on his head and crucified with cigarettes. So. And again painted with kind of an oil, oil paint texture there. Really nicely done in our pepe figure there.
00:23:47.664 - 00:24:17.504, Speaker A: So are you happy now? Very substantial future returns promised Ms. So done in Microsoft paint, digital painting. And here was another one that I missed. This came out December 8. So while I was away in Canada there. What a beautiful one this was too. I find it a very powerful series, you know, and because it's like a lot of people face that, I hang out with a lot of people here in Berlin and everybody's just struggling to do their thing, you know, so it's not easy being an artist.
00:24:17.504 - 00:24:38.346, Speaker A: So I really like this series. And here the artist as a jester. And again, smoking. I love the cigarette smoke that turns into rainbow colors here. And the depressed artist and, you know, at least he's not on the street anymore. And some cigarette. But, but hot dog half eaten and more.
00:24:38.346 - 00:24:52.770, Speaker A: So anyways, cool color too. Buy for $9.90 from the dime store. Pepe's self portrait jester. So really cool series. A new one from board me social club. This just came out.
00:24:52.770 - 00:25:17.140, Speaker A: Farewell. And this was interesting going of our sort of contemporary art theme, derivative of Wolfgang, Wolfgang Tillman's piece. Susannon Lutz, 1993. So we'll take a look at that here. Here's the work, first of all, by boardme social club. Interesting, right? The strange setting, half indoors, half outdoors. And here is the reference.
00:25:17.140 - 00:25:54.760, Speaker A: So this is Wolfgang Tillman's taken from, I think it's at the MoMA here, museum of modern Art. So again, Suzanne and Lutz by Wolfgang Tillmans. And here we go. So we see a pretty clear, you know, relationship here, including the hands and everything. So I'm not sure what Wolfgang Tillmans was up to here. But anyways, an interesting rendition. And he uses a little bit this corner, I think, as architectural, but kind of shifts it makes it half indoors, half outdoors.
00:25:54.760 - 00:26:39.146, Speaker A: Anyways, interesting interpretation and heavy on interpretation. Farewell by board me social club 200 are going to be minted. So we'll see what he mints that for. Human kernel. You know, as we kind of go into our more sophisticated pixel art here. Again, courtesy of hasdrubal waffle. And Santiago had a nice tweet, I was actually going to bring it up where he was, gave a compliment to the show about how, you know, that we correctly identified, I think is how he put it, has dribble waffle as very sophisticated, you know, art, but that is not obvious from a first pass, that sort of thing.
00:26:39.146 - 00:27:06.770, Speaker A: So shout out to Santiago for that. Nice comment. Human kernel here. So again, this kind of experimental, edgy, kinda, you know, digital art, because it's not purely pixel art, however, we want to define it because we have some digital painting here. And again, this is taken from human kernels anti PFP project. And I did bring it up here. So we looked at this piece, and I think we looked at this piece here too.
00:27:06.770 - 00:27:25.596, Speaker A: So each one seems to be kind of different. Right? And again, pfps are another kind of recurring theme here. And so interesting, right. This seems to be a tribute to Ed Marolla here. Purple dreamer. And anyway. And is that hasdrubal? There's hasdrubal.
00:27:25.596 - 00:27:44.598, Speaker A: That one you can get, still get. So anyways, pretty cool. I'll have to peruse this page a little bit. Interesting. Artist, human kernel anti PFP project on the Tezos blockchain. And speaking of Edmarola. So, so this is again, our aesthetics.
00:27:44.598 - 00:28:19.162, Speaker A: Our sense of aesthetics is being challenged by these artists. Okay, you see the fuzziness here, the fuzziness, the blurring out of pixels like this is challenging our sense of aesthetics. But if you've seen over and over pixel art, it starts to become pretty interesting, doesn't it? Right? These people are pushing the envelope. So. And they seem to know each other too, a little bit or kind of responding to each other, doing portraits of each other. So. Retinho, tego, dego la tendans, c'est la evolution.
00:28:19.162 - 00:28:48.942, Speaker A: So I would guess that means the trend is the evolution. Purple rattinity in service of love. So anyways, interesting piece. Was it sent to someone? Yes. You know, a new discovery here, Philippe, to a collector. So, you know, and again, the greatness of this kind of digital. One of the great things about this digital art scene is now we can go through Felipe Rugeri's collection and see what treasures we find there.
00:28:48.942 - 00:29:12.790, Speaker A: Small collection, though, only one page here, but he's got an Ed Marolla. One of one now. So congrats to that. Sabato with a pretty cool chrome period piece. Put pote eight os through bed racehorse who won a notable string of victories in late 18th century England. So here it is. So again, I just love this series.
00:29:12.790 - 00:29:43.134, Speaker A: And I think you can get it for 888 tazos. 88 tazos cents. So really interesting work. Kind of reminiscent for me of those. What is the name of the photographer who did the horses in motion? Etienne Jules Marais. Is that it? Shall we look quickly? I mean, that is not what Sabato is referencing, but I love those works. Etienne Jules Marais.
00:29:43.134 - 00:30:04.044, Speaker A: And let's try horses. Otherwise it's the other guy. Yeah. Kind of reminiscent for me of these works, you know, but that's just me. And. Yeah, I love this, these works, these abstractions. I actually have some works that work with this.
00:30:04.044 - 00:30:28.604, Speaker A: Yeah. And let's not get too lost in the weeds here. This is a pretty low res version, but you get the point. I think it's just uber stylish from a certain perspective for black and white work especially. Anyways, potou, beautiful horsework. And this is popple with a kind of experimental work for him. The lady of hearts, a wicked queen.
00:30:28.604 - 00:30:44.668, Speaker A: She moves through the shadows with a sly grin. Available for 14 tazos on secondary. Let's just take a look here and what was sold for eight on primary. So interesting work. Right. Not sure what's going on here. So.
00:30:44.668 - 00:31:08.304, Speaker A: And you see the heart moving. So kind of a haunted, haunting work. Sanitarium. Is this a new series? It is so, again, kind of monochromatic, too. Referencing, I guess, the heart. So kind of a mysterious drop from popple. A collection of pagan poetry, lost tales and nighttime lullabies about the sanitarium and its dwellers.
00:31:08.304 - 00:31:39.588, Speaker A: Hand drawn pixel illustration, animation by popple. Interesting. This was retweeted by Sabato, actually, of a cap and work wilderness. And again, I'm always back to this idea of nature and pixel art go beautifully together. The rectilinear, you know, hard edged pixels with curvilinear organic forms is epic contrast. It's just an epic contrast, and you see it in action here. Nature work with pixels.
00:31:39.588 - 00:31:55.948, Speaker A: I did it with my own eight bit nature series as well. There's something about it that just works. Wilderness, I don't think this has been minted yet. I was on Kapn's page. I didn't see it. Another experimental work by Ed Morolla, condominium. And I think we can zoom in here.
00:31:55.948 - 00:32:22.074, Speaker A: So really, again, this is, I think GLB is what they call this tech kind of 3d pixel art. So, again, pushing the boundaries here. Right? Like, I mean, what I like about these guys, there's even some fuzziness and some, you know, blurring out here. So these guys are really pushing the edge of pixel, quote, unquote, pixel art. It almost doesn't feel right to call it pixel art, but it is. I mean, this is. And look at the back.
00:32:22.074 - 00:32:42.510, Speaker A: And so, again, this experimentation, you see the edges here. It's just very interesting. This is going somewhere. Okay. Ilay with some nice ascII work here. Unicode japanese treed peony peeny. You guys know how to pronounce that? I don't.
00:32:42.510 - 00:33:03.022, Speaker A: Glitch. Two white background unicode art generator times Kanek Zapata. So I guess they put some Kanek zapata into a Unicode art generator. I'm not exactly sure, but a pretty interesting result, if you like, if you ask me. And Ilay is happy with result. Yeah. And I think it very nice.
00:33:03.022 - 00:33:19.584, Speaker A: Okay. Like, it looks really interesting. Okay. She did another one, moma and exploration of generated image. And so you see playing with different characters here, too. So pretty interesting. And, like, I love to sample.
00:33:19.584 - 00:33:40.292, Speaker A: Why I love the magic wand is because it's a major, to me, it's a mega sampling tool. And I would be tempted to. Okay, you know, and maybe I shouldn't reveal, but we're in a sharing mode here. I would love. And maybe nobody cares. I would love to start sampling these on a separate layer. Right.
00:33:40.292 - 00:34:19.396, Speaker A: And then you sample the moma, and all of a sudden, then you get rid of everything else, and then it's like, well, you know, it's kind of back to this idea we were seeing with the axine sampling the zine. Right. And they, for that beam that came from the skull. And what I liked about that a lot was this idea of disguising where it came from. Like, it wasn't obvious to me. I thought, well, maybe it was a digital thing that he applied some process, or who knows what he did to get those distortions. And again, so it's fun to disguise where things are coming from, right? Because then.
00:34:19.396 - 00:34:51.215, Speaker A: Then as a, you know, a consumer of art, you go, well, how was that made? Where did. How did that come from? So anyways, very interesting. I mean, the moma looks beautiful when you separate it. So this is kind of interesting and fun, as always, from Kurt Hussle collective. So they have the proto pioneers, right? So the puppet pioneers. And this is what I really liked about it. 1920 by 1080, official wallpaper.
00:34:51.215 - 00:35:14.138, Speaker A: So some phone wallpaper here for you, courtesy of the puppet Pioneer tv shows. The first blockchain tv show. And this is also out of the television studio here. Desert Rider. Danny, I don't think we looked at him yesterday. Did we look at him already? I love these guys so much that I just. I might be showing them twice.
00:35:14.138 - 00:35:42.036, Speaker A: But anyways, looks like another classic character here. I think this one's new. I picked that up. This was nice, too. Puppet pioneers, eight bit, and Kurt Hussle collective, maybe because I picked up another one that was sent for free. So, anyways, really nice kind of eight bit version of the puppet Pioneers title window, or whatever you'd call that. Continuing on LB, human, after all.
00:35:42.036 - 00:36:24.328, Speaker A: So again, using a ederal V four Panasonic WJMX 3.0 Rescan from a CRT monitor. So it's kind of funny when I see Rescan by a CRT monitor, it's almost like, I don't know if you've ever tried this, but I remember back in the day, I would sometimes try and take a picture of a low res image with a high res camera in order to try and blow it up, like, for example. And of course, it didn't work. But what you got were these interesting distortions, again, traveling through the mediums. And for me, I want to get rid of the distortions. But here it seems to me, again, rescanned from CRT monitor, that people are using these kind of distortions.
00:36:24.328 - 00:37:17.364, Speaker A: Again, it's not a bug, it's a feature. Here's a nice big version of this skull, human, after all, by LB. And continuing on, Datura with a one of one. And this is at auction here. And Datura is a recent discovery, again, back into this edgy pixel art that we're looking at here experimental pixel art, which again, where is this happening? I'm sure there is some experimental pixel art in museums out there, but I think this is probably competing with it. All of these, like what these guys are doing, we're seeing interesting things happen. Here's an interesting work by Francoise Gamma, which kind of looks like a Picasso esque drawing of a certain kind, pixelated, and then kind of 3d rotated.
00:37:17.364 - 00:37:50.908, Speaker A: Right? And what's interesting is you see how it looks like it's from the front and then to the side, and then as if you're going to see behind, but then it turns to the front again. So kind of a weird illusion there. It always kind of turns to the front. At least that's what my eyes do. Buy for two sad girls defaced. So again, playing with this kind of anime, kind of processed anime shots and messing around with the colors and everything there. Interesting artist buy for 27.
00:37:50.908 - 00:38:21.798, Speaker A: 27. So big audience for this sad girl. You see offers coming in, you know, a lot of collectors. An accepted 25 to seven. So again, like, I think business is booming out here. It's just, you just, you know, like if you're making work that people want to buy and you're getting yourself out there, you're probably going to have a pretty good shot at just kind of creating something for yourself. Dan controls another one, you know, another guy who's doing that.
00:38:21.798 - 00:38:43.070, Speaker A: And look at this iPhone work. And I have the Nikia one. I kind of wanted the big handheld one. And I imagine this in the, you know, gallery in my mind that you put all three phones together. And of course he did generations that was on foundation. So I think that was on Ethereum where he put all three generations into one. So anyways, interesting work.
00:38:43.070 - 00:39:01.142, Speaker A: I picked one up. And here is another ethereum work from Dan Control. And look, current bid from Skomra of 0.15 ETH. So keeping it reasonable, cheap prices, one of one making a good business. I mean, you're selling art. These guys are selling art on a daily basis.
00:39:01.142 - 00:39:26.688, Speaker A: On here it's on Ethereum, there it's on object, on multi chain. Right? Because if he releases this on object at the same time, it's almost like too much. But this is another advantage of using multi chain. You can release more work, say more than one work in one day or whatever. You're not going to over saturate your market if you're releasing two different chains. They're different products. And I use the term product endearingly.
00:39:26.688 - 00:40:11.942, Speaker A: Some people don't like that word for me, I'm. Yeah, like, it's a product, put it on the wall, and as much reverence as I have, and maybe that might mean different things to different people, but ultimately, yeah, like, I think I'm kind of a demystifier of the artist to a certain degree. That's kind of like my angle. I think that's why I think anybody can be an artist. I think artists, you know, have been over mystified a little bit since romanticism and arguably even since the renaissance, you know, this idea of the, you know, artist, artist genius. And I think there is an element of being an outsider, but it's not a black or white issue, because some people just want to say, oh, artists are. They have reservations calling themselves artists.
00:40:11.942 - 00:40:39.264, Speaker A: And I think you should never have a reservation calling yourself an artist. I think everybody should have an artistic outlet. And not having anything, to me, is. Would be the weirder thing. Of course, it's probably 80% of the population, but I think people should have creative outlets, whatever it is, even if it's dancing, you know, shout out to mom, who does flamenco dancing. All right. This is a beautiful work, by the way, lest we forget to discuss the work.
00:40:39.264 - 00:41:00.076, Speaker A: So, anyways, auction just started. You gotta love it. Yeah, I'm taking notes here. Do these cheap auctions on, and they're not even that cheap. I mean, that's $200. I mean, the contemporary art world, that's not a bad sale. And here you have zero costs, okay? So don't shy away from the small sales.
00:41:00.076 - 00:41:19.042, Speaker A: And I say it as much to me as to you. I'm telling myself that the paper crane. This isn't so small, though. Look at this. Har, 95 tezos. But isn't this interesting? Like, I mean, just to show the psychological aspect, I think 195 tezos for this edition of 15. That's a lot of money.
00:41:19.042 - 00:42:00.718, Speaker A: Or those axines that are going for 500 tezos, that's a lot of money. But I think what's going on, the reason you're getting 1500 tezos sales is my theory on that is ETH collectors are coming over and they're going, this art is cheap and it's good. And that's why all of a sudden, Euxine is selling for 5000 tezos, which sounds like a lot, but in super rare ETH terms, it's not. It's like, what is that? Like, three ETH? Right. Which is a lot of money, but it's not really. You know, it turns your head a little bit on ethereum, but not huge amounts you know, it's not shocking, but here it's like, oh, my God. Same thing here.
00:42:00.718 - 00:42:22.654, Speaker A: I mean, how much is 0.15 ETH? And again, I'm trying to keep these short, but 0.15 times 1200, the cost of an ETH. So this is about $180, right? And I was saying, you know, it's good to be cheap. And then I go here and I say, wow, that's expensive. But really, this is cheaper. 195 times 0.76,
00:42:22.654 - 00:42:36.654, Speaker A: that's 140. This is $150. So this work is cheaper than this work. But you see 0.15 and you think, oh, that's selling for nothing. And you see this and you go, oh, wow, that's selling for a lot of money. That's 200 tezos.
00:42:36.654 - 00:43:00.602, Speaker A: So isn't that interesting? And part of it is because Tezos has gone down a lot more than ethereum. Okay, so this is something to keep in mind. And again, the importance of diversifying across chains, it's all to your benefit. There are different collectors, different communities. There is some overlap, but not entirely. Daniel W. With a really nice tarot work here.
00:43:00.602 - 00:43:14.218, Speaker A: He started a new series, I think. So his interpretation of the chariot in. And this is the famous tarot card. Let's see if we can find out. Actually. Famous tarot deck. It's the most famous one.
00:43:14.218 - 00:43:33.102, Speaker A: He seems to be referencing it in the. Yeah, this one here, the rider tarot deck. And actually, should we just look at the chariot? Okay. Rider tarot chariots. Wow. Totally different. I mean, so that's really cool.
00:43:33.102 - 00:43:52.910, Speaker A: You see the cube, though. You see the cube, but he turns it into the head. So, you know, quite a interpretation here. Like, that's what I really like about Daniel W's work is he's like. He does a lot of interpreting here. So pretty interesting. This star in the middle here.
00:43:52.910 - 00:44:09.976, Speaker A: Let's just see if there's also. No. The cube is there and the star is there, so he reverses the star in the cube. Pretty interesting. He has another one, the hermit. Let's just quickly take a look at the hermit. So we actually learned something here today, the hermit.
00:44:09.976 - 00:44:35.380, Speaker A: So, of course, most of us will recognize this. So let's look at Daniel W's version. Quite an interpretation. I mean, this guy is facing us, and here it's almost like a grim reaper, whereas here it's not. So that's really cool. This is beautiful, too, isn't it? And a star. And instead of, you know, the obvious thing would be to do a star, but he puts a lit lantern.
00:44:35.380 - 00:45:01.744, Speaker A: So very nice work from Daniel W. A homage to my year in self imposed isolation. Dextere as we work our way through here with a new work, a new painting. Again, edgy. Edgy. Edgy. This is, you know, like I think we're seeing, again, when I see a work like this, we're seeing the maturation of digital art.
00:45:01.744 - 00:45:31.514, Speaker A: Again, this is not typical, you know, digital art with this barely fuzzy sun, and then, you know, there's a city, like, the whole thing, again, just has a kind of sophistication that I don't think we necessarily saw ten years ago in digital art. I think that's a fair statement. 3000 by 1500 pixels. Romanticana by Dextere. And this may not. This just came out. This is interesting, too.
00:45:31.514 - 00:45:52.654, Speaker A: August waves. So, again, kind of a landscape work, kind of Sci-Fi ish here. There is some music. Let me just turn it on. It seems to be a japanese kind of. This looks like a japanese writing here. And even in the title there was it Ramana.
00:45:52.654 - 00:46:18.716, Speaker A: Kind of soothing. Interesting work, right? Kind of a beach front and went for 1.4 ETH. Okay. So again, I make a big deal about 1.4 ETH, and then I go, or, like, it's a nice price, but then we look at Euxine and we're shocked. But it's like these numbers aren't that far from what Euxine's going for.
00:46:18.716 - 00:46:49.410, Speaker A: So just all kind of interesting, you know, this assessing the valuation, how we're valuing things on different chains. There is like a difference, isn't there? At least for me. Sky Goodman with a really nice shoe, part of his shoe series of impossible shoes, which I love that idea. And I think he's kind of known for these, the lost sneakers. Molten lava's highs. Just some AI kicks, pixel sorted. So he is playing with AI.
00:46:49.410 - 00:47:20.974, Speaker A: And so anyways, and some of his kind of, what I call digitalia in effect here, digital effects. And again, on object edition of ten. Interesting painting by Bolin. So this is kind of digital collage and digital painting. Okay, so interesting. Just kind of, you know, taking collage and then kind of what looks to me like painting over it. It's got a bit of an AI feeling to it, but I don't know if it's AI.
00:47:20.974 - 00:47:56.836, Speaker A: That's why I put it right before the AI section here. And I think one of the most interesting original parts is actually this part here. And it kind of feels physical when you look at these kind of edges coming out here. But maybe it's not. Maybe it's just this is being moved off the canvas a little bit, and who knows? But all to say, again, more novel kind of ideas and imagery, experimentation here. And then Ilya Shipkin, who uses AI and digital painting traditionally. Now, this is like a sculpture, so AI sculpture.
00:47:56.836 - 00:48:45.824, Speaker A: So I assume this is an AI, a digital file, not a physical sculpture that Ilya Shipkin has taken a picture of. So interesting, right? So there's another one here, amalgamation one. And here's amalgamation two against sculpture and AI. Remember, we were seeing, was it neosculpture, what they were talking about yesterday, which also seemed to be combining sculpture and AI. So are we seeing a trend here with sculpture and AI in kind of these two dimensional works? Interesting question. It appears that maybe we're seeing the first gleams of that someone called June xenocat art self portrait genesis work for selfie mania collect on foundation 0.05 ETH so a nice work.
00:48:45.824 - 00:49:05.512, Speaker A: Kind of has a 16th century feel to it, but very sci-fi selfie. So another AI artist to pay attention to, June. Nice color, too, by the way. A nice piece. Kind of feels like a robot here. There's a lot going on. And so, continuing on, Kika nikolayla.
00:49:05.512 - 00:49:52.176, Speaker A: And this is kind of a. The future of our garments, kind of a fashion in AI. And of course, we remember, strange thing in that domain. So, again, stuff we'd never come up with on AI. And I was kind of thinking about this idea, this, like, what do I mean by irrational choices that are made by the AI? Or it's like the AI, like when we get, like, four hands, one person with four hands, like we were seeing yesterday with Lily Ilo. And that is the machine. It's going rationally, but we interpret it as a mistake because it's taking all these references, putting them together, and all of a sudden, the one woman has four hands, and that is the.
00:49:52.176 - 00:50:24.660, Speaker A: We interpret that as a. It's irrational, but really, it's kind of a mistake. But from our human perspective, as far as the machine is concerned, it's combining images, and there's no mistake at all. So it's our interpretation where I go, oh, that's irrational. But in fact, from the machine's perspective, it can't be irrational. It's acting super rational, like, to AI degree. It's combining everything and all its references, putting it together and then smoothing it out, removing the noise, as the AI people would put it.
00:50:24.660 - 00:50:49.402, Speaker A: So, anyways, interesting work here before I wax on for too long here. Very interesting. Novel imagery and edge. Q, who you might remember, I brought up his page here from the trading cards. He is experimenting with AI. And he even started in some of these works. I believe I picked up this one, the Keith Haring reference, which I thought was beautiful.
00:50:49.402 - 00:51:05.230, Speaker A: I believe he used AI and basketball and whatever. So anyways, he continues to experiment with AI. And here's the work. AI. Hip hop and alternative history. Heavy as the head that wears the crown. 99 problems, but the beat ain't one.
00:51:05.230 - 00:51:23.366, Speaker A: So anyways, interesting work here. Look at that typewriter of sorts. It looks like steampunk. It looks like a steampunk typewriter, doesn't it? And finally we have a couple more here. Blank embrace. So I've never seen them before. Elixir.
00:51:23.366 - 00:51:33.544, Speaker A: Just an interesting. I think this is AI. I'm not positive. Let's just see if they have anything. Visual artist, AI explorer. So probably AI. Interesting.
00:51:33.544 - 00:51:54.708, Speaker A: You just get the sense that this is an AI work. And a surprise drop from Mister Shapeless. It's interesting. Just his skies, you know, his shapes in the skies sort of motif. And here it was dropped on object again. So how cool is that for a tezos. So having a lot of fun there.
00:51:54.708 - 00:52:14.078, Speaker A: And people just buying furiously to make some money. Now you got to pay 38 67 and let's just see. You know, someone made a 20 x there. Accept offer. And nice piece for Mister shapeless again. Why wouldn't Mister Shapeless also release on object? That's money too. Those are collectors too.
00:52:14.078 - 00:52:39.604, Speaker A: That's raising Mister shapeless profile too. That's a place to put Mister Shapeless's art, right? So the benefits of multi chain are just emphasized over and over and over again. Morning at Blue Ridge by mister shapeless as well. So a beautiful landscape here as well. And our wanderer figure of course at the front there. So anyways, just very beautiful. And also an AI work by sum.
00:52:39.604 - 00:52:53.998, Speaker A: This is just a crowded room. I like the change in perspective here. I thought it was a very nice work. Buy for three. Again a different perspective, literally on the artist studio here. This time from above. A crowded room.
00:52:53.998 - 00:53:04.054, Speaker A: New generation art studios. So very cool work there. And that, my friends, is your show. Thanks again for joining me. And until next time, take care.
