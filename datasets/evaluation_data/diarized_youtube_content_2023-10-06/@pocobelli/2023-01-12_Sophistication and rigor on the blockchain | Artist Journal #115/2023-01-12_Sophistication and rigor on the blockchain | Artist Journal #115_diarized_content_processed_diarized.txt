00:00:04.400 - 00:00:46.518, Speaker A: Ladies and gentlemen, what you're about to see was maybe 90% to 100% released in the last 48 hours. I've called it a cambrian explosion. You tell me. Artist Journal, January 12, 2023, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. I welcome you back and I welcome all the new subscribers here. I think it's been going around on Twitter or I don't know what's going on, but we're seeing a bit of a, you know, to call it a spike with our humble numbers is perhaps an exaggeration, but we're seeing a bit of an anomaly in the growth.
00:00:46.518 - 00:01:26.944, Speaker A: So that is super interesting, super exciting. I mean, maybe it's just a testament to this space and what is going on as you're going to see here, as we see right here with oxygen's work. And, you know, so this, as a lot of you have been following, I mean, JrD, Joe Rogan's dad, who co hosted the Twitter spaces with me yesterday, and he did an awesome job. Thank you. JrD, the cousin of Runetune, and he was out of Kansas City, so we had a very international situation there. And, yeah, he was calling what was going on with Oxyn a hero moment, and I really like that. And what's so cool about it is it's happening.
00:01:26.944 - 00:02:18.530, Speaker A: Multi chain, too. And I've always advocated being multi chain as an artist. It empowers the artists more than anything. And it's also kind of different collectors, different, you know, we've talked about this many a time, different audiences, different, you know, feelings to these platforms, which might bring about different kinds of work. You could argue that could be happening right here with this very ambitious work by Aksine, which looks fabulous. Went for ten ETH, and you see the. You know, if you're looking on a phone, you might not be able to see it, but this great kind of glitched out invalid, you know, something I just noticed this morning? I've looked at this piece a few times, like many of you, this kind of halo here, it comes from behind, and then it looks like it's going over top and you barely see it, just cover.
00:02:18.530 - 00:03:02.596, Speaker A: So it almost looks like this is something coming from behind and showing up over top. And again, this kind of beautiful gift out skull and in the hands of the friar and the bodiless friar here. And of course, the final glitches here with this kind of digital noise, almost this ascii lettering that's been cut off just more. I use the word masterpiece little too often for my taste, I get. But you're going to see here a series of very impressive works. And this, you know, went for ten ETH. Let's just look at the details here.
00:03:02.596 - 00:03:33.748, Speaker A: And a great, great, great title. Overproduced variants of hell by Aksine went for 10.01 ETH. $13,200, ladies and gentlemen, for this digital work of art. The owner is Xenophon, who also has a euxine in his profile picture that looks like it's from Tazos. And, you know, this speaks to what we're seeing here. And so, anyways, beautiful work here and what we're seeing on Tazos.
00:03:33.748 - 00:04:03.766, Speaker A: And before we look at UK scenes, what's happening on Tezos, NSF world put together a celebration of the creator. Like, you know, UK scene kind of has the space going. And again, it's a multi chain thing. This is on Ethereum and Tezos. You know, you could argue the two most prominent artist blockchains. There are others, Solana and more, but it's quite something. It's kind of, as JRD, beautifully put it is a hero moment.
00:04:03.766 - 00:04:22.272, Speaker A: And what a moment to do it. I mean, look at all these tabs, you guys. So there's a lot to get through. So I'll speed up here. But NSFW, minted with permission. That's cool. He says that because it is using axine work, although I think axin is cc zero.
00:04:22.272 - 00:04:53.246, Speaker A: I think double check. We can double check. But anyways, a really cool tribute here from NSFW, who is a very wonderful follow on Twitter here with the xcene kind of profile picture. Really nicely done. So looking at Oxyn now, this is on Tazos on object.com. If you look at the sales here, and I feel like I need to refresh this just in case. Yeah, like, you see, there's kind of a constant stream here of sales.
00:04:53.246 - 00:05:14.898, Speaker A: But wait till you see. I mean, a lot of you are already going to know this, but a lot of you might not. Oxygen made a sale on tezos for 10,000 tazos the other day, just like yesterday, or the day before. Maybe it was Tuesday. Here's another one for 6900. So. And I think it was repriced to like 20,000.
00:05:14.898 - 00:05:32.114, Speaker A: Yeah, now it's 19,999. So, anyways, I mean, a lot of you guys already know this story. This sold for 750. This beautiful. I love that work. Edition of 22, selling for 750. And this is something else we were commenting on yesterday.
00:05:32.114 - 00:05:54.774, Speaker A: This. See this edition of 321 selling for 69 tezos. So this market is on fire here. And deservedly so. This edition of eleven for 1500 tezos. Here's the one of one that went for 10,000 over here. It's quite a brilliant work.
00:05:54.774 - 00:06:23.620, Speaker A: I mean, I had to take, like, it's one of those things, like, there's so much that we take in here on a daily basis. Sometimes you don't get the work. Like, here you have the bodies going into the. And with this great title roadmap going into the computer and coming out skeletons. Pretty cool. So anyways, the excitement continues. The hero moment, as JRD said, continues.
00:06:23.620 - 00:06:52.132, Speaker A: And a big shout out to Martin Jo yesterday for appearing on the program and for putting together a little movie poster of sorts for the Twitter spaces. Well, actually, maybe not for the Twitter spaces, but it sure worked out that way. What's going on here? Adrian Poker Belly, Joe Rogan's dad. So there I am. There we are with the kinky bears at last. As I said on the Twitter spaces, my work is done. Here I am, finally.
00:06:52.132 - 00:07:18.714, Speaker A: I have finally met the kinky bears in person here. So pretty hilarious. I'm not exactly sure what's going on here. Great work, Martin Joe, as always. And Martin Joe, I mean, this is what's so fascinating about this Twitter spaces. I mean, people are pretty, you know, generous sharing their information. He works in midjourney, almost exclusively, from what I understood.
00:07:18.714 - 00:08:04.462, Speaker A: So isn't that interesting? And we're. Sky Goodman was in there, and he was talking about his process, how he loves to use several different softwares, which we had a big discussion about on exporting and all that stuff. So that was fabulous. Now, this number, 387. I don't think there were 387 people in the Twitter spaces, but I think what might have happened, I think Twitter, because when you click on the spaces button on your phone, you get some kind of, if you want to listen to pre recorded Twitter spaces, you can. I think they might have shared it in that kind of area for people that are interested in, you know, art and AI art or whatever. So.
00:08:04.462 - 00:08:26.558, Speaker A: Because 387, that's a good number. That is. So I think it must have been shared a little bit by Twitter. So, anyways, thanks to everybody that came out, and thanks to Joe Rogan's dad for co hosting. It was a really awesome. Santiago. Everybody good? Who showed up there? Chimasku Jackson talking about his show in Seattle, everything.
00:08:26.558 - 00:08:47.312, Speaker A: So that was awesome. And this was kind of hilarious, too. Jurassics, paint prep and artist journal live. So you gotta love it. And rare, rare force one was saying something similar. So anyways, well, that he listens to it while he works. So that is just super cool.
00:08:47.312 - 00:09:25.528, Speaker A: This is like, I love it, you know, like artists, you know, there's nothing you want more as an artist myself than for other artists to kind of be into what you're talking about and what we're saying here. So to what everybody is saying out here, a quick shout out to agor. Thank you for picking this up. Security of Europe, a work from the secret history of world War three for 20 tezos. That's awesome. And yeah, these are kind of preliminary works of something. I am working on many of the too many projects here and thank you to sold a fair amount of these eight bit nature works.
00:09:25.528 - 00:09:41.774, Speaker A: So the last cloud went, there's one more fire left. And desert. Desert is popular with the prints. And anyways snow and flowers sold. So anyways, that's super duper cool. Thank you everybody. And I just thought this was kind of funny.
00:09:41.774 - 00:10:16.406, Speaker A: We were looking at this and Teganhof was saying how he discovered the show. It's on my watch list even more when I mentioned. And I just thought it's kind of funny. I have a sunset in the eight bit nature series and I was like, oh, it almost kind of looks like this. So it was just kind of a funny similarity. So I thought isn't that cool? So anyway, shout out to Teganhof. A quick comment from Martin Baldwin who was wondering about the, what did the big throwdown mean? And he appreciates the explanation.
00:10:16.406 - 00:10:46.108, Speaker A: And this was an interesting comment because I think Martin might be, I don't know if he's newer to the scene, but. So it's always interesting to hear these perceptions of people. He's definitely new to the channel. While referring to NFTs as maybe a flash in the pan, I personally think that NFTs could be with us for a long haul. It seems too many people enjoy creating and collecting them. The community is growing and developing. And I particularly, I agree with all of this and particularly this people.
00:10:46.108 - 00:11:18.654, Speaker A: I'm having too much fun over here just on the creation front and as you're going to see, I mean it's so intellectually stimulating what's going on here, particularly if you're a lover of the visual arts. So I agree. Like, I mean maybe they'll need to change the name. Like, I'm not worried about the name NFTs. A lot of people like seem to be like, oh, we need to change the name. I mean I don't see any problems here. You know, just because, you know, some big corporations are saying NFTs suck, doesn't mean that they're right.
00:11:18.654 - 00:11:43.992, Speaker A: Right. And I'm gonna show you. You decide for yourself, dear viewer, we're gonna run through this here. So Santiago just posted a work in progress. And shout out for showing up. I like to show the works in progress here. So anyways, and he was talking about his process in using gimp and putting all these different previous paintings that he wouldn't want to release into a new painting.
00:11:43.992 - 00:12:52.234, Speaker A: So just interesting because we've been looking at his work the last few days, and also an auction while we're on Santiago here, he has an auction going on right now for a one of one, which is at 50. And so, again, this experimentation here, write in my hand and face a horrible poem with permanent markers while errors pop up on my screen. Art made on inkscape with shapes taken from a screenshot of my desktop background, which consists in a collage of AI images. Okay, so, again, a lot of kind of recycling over here. So 50 tezos, one of one, another just comment. I mean, Charles AI is always very kind of intellectually provocative in a good way, and he had an interesting comment, which I'm still kind of working out, but I thought I'd share it with you because I thought it was just kind of an interesting idea. As far as I can understand it, one of ones drive edition prices, more editions, less one of ones is a good way to release more art while conserving the value of your work, in my opinion.
00:12:52.234 - 00:13:47.350, Speaker A: So I think the idea is if you have less one of ones, there will be more scarcity, which will drive more value to your work. And so therefore, maybe you have more editions is a good way to release more art. So if you're, let's say you want to keep the scarcity, then you release additions, and you're still able to retain the value of the one of ones by not putting too many out there and while having the collectors battle for those few that you have. Interesting thought. Very interesting thought. And speaking of collectors and editions, Heidi Rockette, who was also at the Twitter spaces yesterday, shout out to him. He sold, he made a great sale here, 800 tezos for this work here.
00:13:47.350 - 00:14:43.402, Speaker A: Let's see if we can play it. So, for one of these works, part of a series he's worked on here, just kind of crazy Internet imagery, kind of all glitched out, shall we say. This is more on a collage front, maybe, but often there will be like, you know, screenshots and Windows 95 type imagery and whatnot. This is maybe more on a collage front, but anyways, 800 tezos, an edition of seven. Nice sale. And this kind of speaks like things seem to be heating up here, especially on tezos. And there's this whole kind of notion, you know, what I'm calling the xcopy effect, that, you know, when Xcopy, you know, gave a shout out to axine on Twitter or bought some of his work, that got a lot of Ethereum collectors attention.
00:14:43.402 - 00:15:19.534, Speaker A: And now we're starting to see as the supply is starting to dry up on a lot of these artists that we've been looking at here. Gloom tube is another. So here, Haiti makes a sale. So you see the circumstantial evidence is starting to grow here, my friends, just more evidence. And look, just, you know, another kind of sign of a good healthy market, as I like to call it. One don't knows releases a new work. And he does a lot of collage generally of, you know, let's say renaissance to 18th century paintings and makes them his own.
00:15:19.534 - 00:15:49.534, Speaker A: He's become quite, you know, known for it and remarkable at it. And he has a three ETH bid, opening bid on Guardian of death on super rare. So pretty impressive over here. So shout out and congrats to one don't knows. That is a pretty nice opening bid. And Bzaya, I miss this work. And speaking of screenshots, here, right here we have Windows 95, I think, or maybe this is Windows 2000 or whatever.
00:15:49.534 - 00:16:12.000, Speaker A: Windows XP, right? And you have Snoop and you have other figures here. And I think maybe that's bezaya. I always get these wrong. But anyways, a cool work on super rare with metamask and super rare there. Pretty hilarious. And Twitter and a burning address for the recycling bin. Anyways, essentials.
00:16:12.000 - 00:16:38.010, Speaker A: Cool title as usual from Bzaya. Sorry, let me bring that back here. And this went for 0.4 ETH to igordo. Shout out to Igordo, who, who I met on Twitter just yesterday, yesterday morning. So anyways, Igordo picks up new Bazaya on super rare. And I don't know if I, I think we might have shown the last Bzaya, but we'll see if this loads up.
00:16:38.010 - 00:17:01.194, Speaker A: But Vincent van Doe picked up the second work and that was just a transfer. So we don't know how much that went for, but it's part of the super Bizaya world. This work here, this went to Vincent van do. I believe it was just a transfer? Yeah. So we don't know what it went for. But anyways, congrats, this is super cool. So Buzzai is selling everything on super rare.
00:17:01.194 - 00:17:58.498, Speaker A: Shout out to rare. And he just did this commission here when he finished the lamb of Boston Dynamics, which was a big hit and which we had on the program a few days ago, which feels like a month ago, but it was probably like Monday or Tuesday. So anyways, so here's a new commission from rare, and he also goes again into his process. And what's interesting about it, I mean, he's looking at all sorts. Like, to me, it's a testament to the, for lack of better term, the intellectual fortitude of this scene. You know, look like when you look at you, you know, comments like this, previous paintings, a lot of my work was more of a pastiche to 17th to 19th century paintings, putting spot in situations he couldn't be in while painting. For myself, I can actually show what my true paint style is, though, always evolving through personal taste and text.
00:17:58.498 - 00:18:40.764, Speaker A: So he goes into it and he talks about, you know, famous painters and how he's, you know, you know, Uwen Huglow, who influenced him. And so to me, this is just like, there's a couple of things. First, it shows the depth of the art that's happening here. As I always say, to be a part of the tradition, to a certain degree, you need to have a conversation with the tradition. But it also shows a really interesting way of communicating with the artist, with the public, because this isn't an interview. He didn't wait for someone to interview him. It's him just explaining his style.
00:18:40.764 - 00:19:11.786, Speaker A: And you can't really do this in this way on Instagram, can you? Right. And where else are you going to do it, on a blog post? It doesn't seem to. I guess you could, but who's going to find it? And they have to click on the link. Twitter continues to be a very good tool for artists to state the obvious. So particularly digital artists, because they can have their digital works up on Twitter. You know, you don't even need, like, that is the work. It's not a photo of your painting that you're talking about.
00:19:11.786 - 00:19:27.386, Speaker A: Right. And I thought this was actually really interesting, too. His favorite part was of the painting is the eye and the dog. And let me just quickly show you that. Yeah. So it's probably a little small, but here you can see it. And it's true.
00:19:27.386 - 00:19:55.550, Speaker A: I mean, it gives the whole painting, like, the whole Boston dynamics dog personality. Right. So anyways, just a really cool work and just so nice and painterly. And it's just so much better when you even know, like, he's got this beautiful brushwork here guys. And now you see all the influences, and he's been doing it for a while. Like, this isn't someone who just got a nice brush set on procreate, right. Because sometimes people can wonder about that sort of thing.
00:19:55.550 - 00:20:23.858, Speaker A: This is like really, you know, rigorous painting, you know, a really competent painting. Continuing on Gloomtube with a still life. So he came in the middle of the night, like a shadow in the night and released this. So very interesting piece. And there's an interesting title, crying in Wendy's dining room. So Wendy's, of course, is fast food if you do not live in North America. And so anyways, there's the bacon and crying.
00:20:23.858 - 00:20:39.464, Speaker A: Maybe these are the tears here. And the mustard almost looks like a tear. Or the cheese. That's the cheese. The melted cheese. So anyways, just a cool work by gloom tube. And we were talking about gloom tube two yesterday, how that market is drying up pretty rapidly.
00:20:39.464 - 00:20:56.636, Speaker A: So it just continues to be interesting out here. Dan control. Look at this. 35 tezos. I guess this sold out rocking horse. So continuing with the still life in a gradient style. Kind of a new floor, new background.
00:20:56.636 - 00:21:19.592, Speaker A: Kind of look pretty powerful, actually. And let's just see how quickly these things are going here. Released at 1806 Berlin time. So 06:06 p.m. Gone within 15 minutes. Okay. So on primary and sold on secondary for eleven.
00:21:19.592 - 00:21:38.214, Speaker A: Okay. These went originally for three. So I mean, as I keep saying here, what bear market. Guys like, you look at gloom tube, we didn't even look at that. That sold out in like, 2 seconds. You know, like, let's just quickly look. You know, like, I mean, you guys know this, but look.
00:21:38.214 - 00:21:59.440, Speaker A: 339 and it was gone by 340. Okay. On primary. Okay, so this is like, you know, I don't, if this isn't a hot market, I don't know what is. Right. So don't worry about what people like. I don't think we need to soul search ourselves about what we're gonna call nfts so that the world likes us again.
00:21:59.440 - 00:22:19.108, Speaker A: You know, a lot of these art movements start with people hating you, and that's okay. All right. You know, you have to have the courage of your convictions. Right. So anyways, continuing on, another work by Dan control. Kind of in the same theme, right? With the toys. Rocking horse.
00:22:19.108 - 00:22:38.740, Speaker A: Right. So kind of children's toys here. Little train. It's made of wood, but I'm sure you can travel in it anyway. I guess your imagination can travel in it. And so again, listed at two, gone by 214 and for two tezos. So pretty cool.
00:22:38.740 - 00:23:40.702, Speaker A: On secondary edition of ten, on secondary for 674, he also, you know, again, the empowering nature of being multi chain, you can, you know, you can release more work because if he had put all this out on object on the same day and he's releasing ten works, maybe people, it doesn't give people time to be able to collect your work because they're out of money, right? Like people only have a certain amount of budget. But then you go over to Ethereum here on foundation and release cigarettes and put a 0.15 ETH reserve on it. And, you know, so again, I think being multi chain is empowering to the artists now. And the art itself is quite fascinating. And you know what, you know what I missed? This looks like a vapo cigarette. So again, modern imagery because otherwise, I was even gonna say, like, this looks like it could be some pop work from the sixties, but it's not because this is a vapo cigarette.
00:23:40.702 - 00:24:11.868, Speaker A: So nice detail. Dan cigarettes. And I like how he doesn't, like, overstate it in the title. So Dan, control some more still lifes. Just Trazza Rodank's block and sausage playing with some surrealist juxtapositions and some just, you know, bright colors in the background. So a sausage and a, you know, would you call that a cinder block? So available on tezos for three, edition of ten. And he put out another one just kind of these mysterious still lifes here.
00:24:11.868 - 00:24:46.218, Speaker A: Egg and shoe, also edition of ten, available for three on object. So interesting work. And Diego Barrow with this pen drawing. So this is digital, so. And he has been a long time friend on, well, long time is, I guess, four or five months on Twitter here on Twitter with chitita. So used making procreate on an iPad with the rollerball pen technique. So a very nice digital work here of probably his dog.
00:24:46.218 - 00:25:22.714, Speaker A: And I love how he puts the writing in the bottom there. And another illustrative work. Now, I don't know if this is digital or not, but it was kind of hard to place these works in this, in our role here. But here's Jess Thuga, biophilic concept artist, multimedia. So I'm not sure if these beautiful works of frogs are illustration, digital or both. It looks like digital coloring, right? So I assume it's digital, but hard to say beautiful work regardless. Dan W.
00:25:22.714 - 00:25:40.090, Speaker A: Look at this. A one of one from Dan W. I didn't even see that. The birth of Venus. And in his kind of traditional interpretation, she looks kind of mad about it. And anyways, a beautiful interpretation here. Let's just see what's going on.
00:25:40.090 - 00:26:00.840, Speaker A: Let's see how far we are. 6 hours to go. It's at 275 tezos. Again, artists aren't sitting on their work here. So continuing on, Antonio loves angels, saints, prophets, Saint Christopher on fire edition of seven buy for 30. Let's just take a look here. So these were.
00:26:00.840 - 00:26:32.744, Speaker A: Yeah, they went on primary for 1770 and just taking offers maybe on the rest. Interesting work, you know, again, a newer artist that we've been looking at here with these sort of strange digital illustrations, you know, just kind of very. The three eyes, the religious imagery, the eye independent here, the fire, St. Christopher, maybe he was burned at the stake or something. St. Christopher on fire. So anyways, it's interesting.
00:26:32.744 - 00:27:21.204, Speaker A: I mean, you see it in Euxine's friar at the start too, the religious imagery, how it's kind of being processed in our modern, you know, in our modern, from our modern perspectives here. So that's interesting. A work in progress from insull that I thought kind of went well with that last work and just, I thought it was looking pretty good. And again, we love the process shots here. Nice colors and everything from Insel and Elie Lo with a new trash work. And let me just get this going. Pretty cool music.
00:27:21.204 - 00:27:57.406, Speaker A: I mean, really taking trash, taking trash to the next level. Let me stop this. Pretty cool offers for five, sold for three on primary. I mean, one of the great things about Elie Lowe is how low he keeps the prices on primary, because I think he could raise them. I'm sorry, just going through my pavlovian dog. I am answering my notifications here. A beautiful work by Sabato on Ethereum.
00:27:57.406 - 00:28:26.744, Speaker A: And this is really interesting. He's using the manifold gallery contract. Trust the platform, yes. No. And this is made with what I call retro tools, vintage software also created in deluxe paint, four on an emulated Amiga, a 1200 computer. And this is going to go for auction, and it starts at 0.089. And I think he was saying that he only has one other work on ETH and it's only available for trade.
00:28:26.744 - 00:29:06.446, Speaker A: So to get a sabato on ETH, you can get it really for a song here. Like it probably cost, you know, ETH is at 1300 bucks about so 0.8 maybe that's $100 to at least start the auction. So really nice. And I love the pattern in the background and the concept is fun too, and just a nice animation. So, you know, totally original, isn't it, comrade Wallop, Bureau of Redistribution? So yeah, I guess it has something to do with platforms, maybe royalties, and. Looks like kind of a Fidel Castro hat there.
00:29:06.446 - 00:29:28.002, Speaker A: Not sure, but he is a comrade, so that is probably a good guess. Continuing on Pixel World. This is on form function, and I don't think we've seen this artist before. Again, the depth of the scene, and just a really interesting animation here. Ferdoropeza is the name of the artist. Pretty small file. 884 by 1080.
00:29:28.002 - 00:29:49.246, Speaker A: Let's just expand it here. So, just a pretty cool animation here. Pixelation. Who doesn't love this kind of stuff? I never get tired of this kind of stuff. So, anyways, just looks great. And a lot of, you know, just web colors, you might say. Interesting use of depth of field here for contrast.
00:29:49.246 - 00:30:21.774, Speaker A: Getting that fuzzy, blurry, contrasting with this very strong, high contrast or very defined pixels in the front. Interesting work. Glitch aesthetic of the pixels. Buy now for five tazos, which isn't that much. And it's a one of one. So I think that's still available for you Solana collectors out here. Tom Bombadil, also out yesterday, UFO, under repair supervision from the spectrum collection.
00:30:21.774 - 00:30:42.790, Speaker A: And this sold out also right away. Let's just take a quick look. Yeah, sold out. How fast? 1557. It was listed, and it was gone by 1559 on primary. So, like, things are hot, okay. Especially on tezos.
00:30:42.790 - 00:31:14.556, Speaker A: But, I mean, you saw there was just a ten e sale on. Super rare there for uxine. Yeah, like, the. The market seems to be doing well. Pretty cool concept, too. I'm impressed at how prolific Tom bombadil is. He puts out a worker, too, it seems, every day, from what I can tell, or at least every day or two, this work I absolutely love, again, Maison III, as I tweeted out simply, mazen again.
00:31:14.556 - 00:32:03.474, Speaker A: I love the poetry of his work. And you say, oh, what's the big deal? Let me make this big and let me get. It's the music combined with the glitch rom. Okay. It's nice distortion here. I thought to myself, you know, is this our human destiny wrapped up in one NFT? I mean, it's great music from my perspective out here. And, I mean, just so poetic.
00:32:03.474 - 00:32:25.032, Speaker A: I mean, I adore this work. A one of one. So it's hard for me to stop it, really. When I saw that yesterday on. On object, that song was in my head for the rest of the day. I watched that thing, like, four or five times, at least. At least.
00:32:25.032 - 00:33:30.778, Speaker A: So a stunning, stunning, stunning work from Mason III Kappan, another guy whose market is pretty hot. So he put out anamnesis do you all know what anamnesis means? That is a very important greek philosophical word. It comes out of Plato's, the doctrine of recollection, this theory that if the soul is immortal, that Plato had, that if the soul is immortal, real knowledge is actually eternal. And so when you understand and come to new understandings, it's really you're just remembering what was already, what you already knew before you were born, when all the circles of the soul get taken, you know, get screwed up, as they say in the Tamiyas. So anamnesis is a great, very important philosophical Greek. Philosophical word. What one perceives as learning is the recovery of what one has forgotten.
00:33:30.778 - 00:34:03.954, Speaker A: So a little Platonism here from Kappan with this very charming, poetic, beautiful work here. Okay? And so just a nice, kind of has a bit of an alien feel, an impressionistic feel, just all of it. And I love how he actually has a little bit of dynamism in here with the movement. Very, very nice work from cap. And as I was saying, look at the market here. 55 on primary, sorry, on secondary. Like, you can't get much here.
00:34:03.954 - 00:34:29.064, Speaker A: This is kind of like what we're talking about, what me and Joe Rogan's dad were talking about yesterday on the show. You see here, like, it's kind of like pick through. It's like, okay, there's one work you can get for ten tezos here that's, you know, but there's not too much. And, you know, this one. Okay, well, these ones aren't moving if you want a moving one. Yeah, like, there's. You see how it's starting to dry up here? Kappn's another one of these guys.
00:34:29.064 - 00:35:08.572, Speaker A: Popple is another one. I mean, again, like, did we look at the sale actually? How fast? Kapn, let's just look, because, you know, to this thesis of how hot this market is. Because if this isn't a hot market, I guess the only way it could be hotter is if things were going at a zero, right? Which I think is actually possible. But I have been guilty of being over bullish many times in my life, so let's just see how quickly. So this took a day. Okay. This took 21 hours to sell out, interestingly so.
00:35:08.572 - 00:35:25.164, Speaker A: Okay, so you, you know, but I'm surprised. I. I think if this went out on twitter, I think that. Yeah. So anyways, not bad. Anyways, he still sold how many editions? Very quickly? 20 in 21 hours. Not bad.
00:35:25.164 - 00:36:08.944, Speaker A: I mean, especially a lot of these guys are just artists like you or me, working at home. And there you're selling out in a day, in less than a day. And many people like popple here, look at this. I brought up his mintz, puts it on sale, lists it at 21 31. So 931 Berlin time, sold out ten minutes later at nine tezos and edition of 25. Okay, so brings in 250 tezos, which is maybe $200, a little more with this really cool work here. Fountain of lunacy, part of the sanitarium series, this kind of alien ish monster pixel art series.
00:36:08.944 - 00:36:43.326, Speaker A: Very cool. He said he was working on over Christmas on a kind of an overheating laptop. Pretty impressive with, you know, just his imagination too. I mean, first of all, technically, it's pretty interesting, everything that's going on here. And what a strange work, right? I mean, it really fits into his whole kind of themes of kind of Sci-Fi and, you know, all that stuff. The sound of the water echoes through the hall. A reminder of the tortured souls that fell to the grip of madness.
00:36:43.326 - 00:36:57.670, Speaker A: Trapped in this place. Their spirits still linger. With one escape, I think is what he means with on escape, with one escape, probably. Fountain of lunacy, part of sanitarium series. The red skeleton. Nice contrast. Stalomere.
00:36:57.670 - 00:37:16.884, Speaker A: This kind of strange, interesting pixel artist. Very. You might remember the colors. Remember the person that did this wild work here. Again, 5250. Now, you can't get these works, you know, without putting in an offer unless you want to pay up. Homeworld here, we looked at, we looked at all three of these.
00:37:16.884 - 00:37:37.692, Speaker A: So there is a new one available for only three on the primary. I think it's still available editions of 33. I assume. It's going pretty quickly here. Anyways, it looks like work vehicle. So it looks like, kind of like the inside of a work vehicle. So again, like kind of like some space Sci-Fi thing.
00:37:37.692 - 00:38:10.848, Speaker A: So just a very unusual series here. Homeworld memories, you know, very cool series. Ed Morolla, the great pixel artist here, experimental pixel artist with a new work in his traditional colors here. Let's take a closer look. Bird number eleven. So interesting. Almost looks like it's using a sample brush of sorts here, as it looks like brushworks, brushes are being dragged.
00:38:10.848 - 00:38:51.498, Speaker A: There seems to be a bit of fuzziness, which is another kind of thing, technique he likes to use. And again, more of this, you know, it looks like the brushwork is being kind of rasterized or something bitmapped. And then again, so just these wild works. I mean, what is going on here? Right? So bird, you know, just wild, wild works. I mean, you see these people sitting here. See this guy at the controls? I mean, and then this kind of almost medieval perspective, the weird colors. Just very, very interesting.
00:38:51.498 - 00:39:14.874, Speaker A: Bird number eleven, buy for 13. And, like, I think Ed's also another artist that's selling out really quickly here. Like, let's just look again. Editions of 33 for fortezos. Each lists at 121 and sold out by 128. Is that correct? Yeah. So he sells out in seven minutes.
00:39:14.874 - 00:39:49.304, Speaker A: So, Edmarola, Ed Morolla, doing well, edition of 33, I think this is still available on primary. There's four left here. So, again, very experimental stuff here. He got one of his vases that he likes to use. Slaty dream. So another very interesting work here. Yeah, just, you make of it what you can, but, I mean, it's just always interesting and the experimentation and everything, you know, you look at over here, like, in the background.
00:39:49.304 - 00:40:13.404, Speaker A: So you gotta love it. I mean, again, I'm kind of back to this idea of the rigorousness, the intellectual rigor of what's going on here. We see this other one that he released, pirate approaching shore. And it's interesting in this one. And. Yeah, so, object. Unfortunately, the images are not centered here, so they get glued to the top here.
00:40:13.404 - 00:40:39.914, Speaker A: So, very cool. So a pirate ship here. You got to love the pirate ships. And approaching a town, right? And so you see, and then again, this kind of glitched out, fuzzy pixels over here. It looks like brushes that's been kind of turned into. Let's see if we can even zoom in a little more here. It's always tricky here.
00:40:39.914 - 00:41:03.932, Speaker A: Let me just try. Yeah, here we go. Like, it kind of is worthwhile. Like, look at the sea is quite effective, isn't it? Right? Like, these waves on the sea. Very, very, very interesting experimentation here. And these pretty little ships, one with the little skull and crossbones on it. So there we go.
00:41:03.932 - 00:41:24.992, Speaker A: Right? Approaching a citadel, you know, or a town or something. Crazy abstraction. Anyways, very interesting. Continuing on p one with a new work, and we saw p one, who released some work with music. Now, just a straight up pixel work. Interesting and unusual work here. Rabbit hole.
00:41:24.992 - 00:41:58.126, Speaker A: It's colorful, comfy, and fluffy. So, again, like, I just think this is incredibly original pixel artwork that we're seeing here, you know, on the blockchain here on tasos. Speaking of unusual and interesting, hasdrubal waffle. Look at this. I guess you'd call it a PFP, this portrait, like, look at everything that's going on. Let me bring it up in a new window here. Hopefully, this is.
00:41:58.126 - 00:42:33.944, Speaker A: Yeah, so we can really? Like, you see the fuzziness. You know, it's almost like a fuzzy outline here with this frankly beautiful work, this beautiful profile picture. I mean, at first I would have thought, oh, you know, like, what many people might think at the start. Like, oh, like, what's this? This is like a kid's drawing, but this is not a kid's drawing. And it almost looks like video in the background. You know, there's so much experimentation, which, again, the word that I think of when I see how stribble waffles work is rich. And I think it speaks to this whole kind of.
00:42:33.944 - 00:43:04.338, Speaker A: Again, I keep coming back to this rigor that's in the work. And that's actually what Santiago was saying on yesterday's Twitter spaces, was he was getting very bullish on the space, seeing artists like Hasdrubal waffle starting to sell a lot of work, because I think if I understand SanTIagO right, he sees it as fairly sophisticated work. As do I. Right? So. And it's. It's not easy, in a sense. Ironically, it looks like a kid's drawing, but this isn't easy.
00:43:04.338 - 00:43:47.066, Speaker A: But once you start to appreciate this sort of stuff, it gets really interesting and exciting, you know, another hasdrubal waffle work, this looks like it was made with Mario paint, but I don't know that a deconstructing koi kon, Jacques Derrida and Skynet give up on their attempt to deconstruct koi kon down to its essence. So I guess this is Jacques Derrida on his computer with his pipe. And there is the Terminator. I guess that's the t. Is that the t 800? I'm not sure. And some sausages and a keyboard. And again, you just see the richness here, and it's kind of back to this intellectual rigor.
00:43:47.066 - 00:44:08.128, Speaker A: Like, look at the theme. And what is he doing? He's combining Jack Derrida and the Terminator. Like, I don't know what you're seeing in the contemporary art galleries. That is, you know, like, I'm not saying anything like that. It's worse. I'm just saying this is just as interesting is my point here. Like, we're just as interesting over here.
00:44:08.128 - 00:44:39.984, Speaker A: Like, if I go to a contemporary art gallery down the street and I see this, I go, that's a pretty cool gallery. They're on it, right? So has drubble waffle. Let's just see. I mean, you can't even get this if you want to, offers for five. I mean, how do you even get this auction bid sail for 22 to ilay, who, frankly, go follow ilay on twitter, who helps do the comments on this show, the summaries. She's been on fire. And we're going to see a few more works.
00:44:39.984 - 00:45:35.194, Speaker A: So Aylay picked this up for 22. And who actually owns this? Yeah, so Santiago Fanger's like, these are not going to be easy to get low editions. And again, you can put this up in any contemporary art gallery or in a contemporary art gallery, let's put it that way, and be very pleased with your gallery. Okay, so I say again, I'm just sharing my opinion here, of course, human colonel, who I think I'm not sure is friends or seems to be in that kind of same scene here with his. Remember the anti profile picture project, the anti PFP series? Well, has a beautiful one that came out here. And again, like, you know, we're talking about new countries, undiscovered countries on tezos. And again, you just see this contrast of some basically almost looks like Santiago.
00:45:35.194 - 00:46:06.494, Speaker A: Glitchy recycling type stuff in the background. And then this painterly head, which is, you know, blurred out on the outside. This beautiful kind of work on the inside. And then outrageously. Look at this suit, you know, which is done just with basically a one pixel pen, basically, or pencil, you know, and then a flat brown. Again, this is sophisticated work. Okay? It's.
00:46:06.494 - 00:46:27.714, Speaker A: It's, you know, it's easy to gloss over. This is a nice one of one. And, you know, disappears after six minutes for 22 to gato moto. And we have a few more here. Again, I will see the sky matching this energy. And let me just see this went for 22. Five minutes later.
00:46:27.714 - 00:47:02.474, Speaker A: So human kernel. Again, part of the anti PFP work. And you see just similar ideas where it's just like experimentation in the back and then contrasting this kind of blurred out painting with this super sharp, you know, what looks like kind of what the Ed Marolla brush was doing in that other work. You know, these kind of sampled pixel brushes. Right. And mustache and just an interesting color, like, so many interesting decisions here. So, again, that word rich just crosses my mind so often when I'm looking at these artists work.
00:47:02.474 - 00:47:44.304, Speaker A: Solid passive time. Also a anti PFP by a human kernel. And again, playing with our sense of, you know, we saw this in Haiti rocket, too, with the sense of what is acceptable in the sense of what can we call art? You know, sometimes Haiti would take a Nintendo glitch rom, I'm thinking the one with the planes, and just make it flash a little bit and I still loved it. And I get the same kind of sense here. It's playing with this idea of what can we call a great work of art, right? Or a good work of art or a piece of art, right? And, you know, so there's some serious experimentation here, and it's incredibly interesting. Here's another one. I managed to pick this up.
00:47:44.304 - 00:48:25.692, Speaker A: I mean, you gotta be extremely fast with human kernel eyes of a secret spirit. Doors that lead each time to a different site. So again, you see this experimentation here maybe playing with, like, a finger, you know, brush in the background with these kind of sunset colors, and then this alien, this kind of fuzzed out alien, you know? So again, like, it's easy to look at this and go, oh, you know, no big deal. And look at even just, like, the drop shadow around this is pretty sophisticated stuff. Okay, another one. Human kernel, concentrating in a layer out of space and time. And see, just, again, experimentation in the shirt here.
00:48:25.692 - 00:49:09.546, Speaker A: And one of the things that you can appreciate in this anti PFP project is the variety of experimentation that's going on here, right? Like, I mean, it's not easy to actually do stuff like this. It might seem easy, but it's actually quite difficult to do work that feels irrational, you know, as I always say. So look at the eyes, you know, because you always want to correct these things, right? So bold. It's very bold. So very cool work from human kernel. Now, another PFP, kind of pixelated PFP project from board me social club. And I thought we could just take a broad view here in the interests of time here.
00:49:09.546 - 00:49:21.196, Speaker A: But anyways, just very interesting. All sold out right away. Some were sent to. I think this was sent to NSFW. This one sold for eight tazos. So just a cool. Again, playing with the PFP theme.
00:49:21.196 - 00:49:52.494, Speaker A: So I thought I'd show this with the other pfps. Now, this is another. This is an ilay discovery, at least for me. And again, it kind of plays to this whole hasdrubal waffle and all this experimentation. Human kernel, you know, again, this looks like a kid's drawing, but when you actually look at what's going on, it's actually like, oh, this is actually pretty interesting. Future legend series. Just in case you don't know who it is, here's a clue, and I'll show you.
00:49:52.494 - 00:50:10.990, Speaker A: This is another work. This is a one of one. I picked this up for, like, 18 tezos, you know, $15. And as I get deeper into this experimental work that these guys are doing, it's the same artist kind of a. I think this is kind of like an outdoor. Sorry. I think this.
00:50:10.990 - 00:50:46.660, Speaker A: I could print it where I grew up. It's kind of like a home, it looks like. Right, so multiple processes utilizing sketchbook, mal and affinity. I don't even know what half those things are, but all I know is there's some very, very interesting experimentation here that you can get on the cheap, so very cool. Speaking of experimentation, Detoura Mirage, number 6233. Another kind of just edgy experimental pixel artist here. Again, it looks like gallery work in my universe.
00:50:46.660 - 00:51:18.564, Speaker A: It's like, oh, yeah, this is the kind of thing I would see at a contemporary art gallery in Berlin. So slightly out of order here. So back to Louis. So, yeah, so here's just kind of a broad look. And what you see is a lot of variety, actually, a lot of experimentation. Kind of has a bit of a Santiago feel on these two, especially this one. So anyways, Louis, painter, animator, comic artist, and sad girl, who does kind of glitched out anime.
00:51:18.564 - 00:51:52.130, Speaker A: And again, just more experimentation, you know? So basically, it looks like they take scenes and kind of, you know, rasterize or bitmap them into a couple of colors here. And don't even worry about, you know, being able to tell what this is or anything. So just kind of a digital impressionism of sorts. BSOD. The lows don't feel the same as the ups. So kind of a blue work, depressing work. Bliss.
00:51:52.130 - 00:52:09.596, Speaker A: Sophie Algura. So let me just bring this up. So again, more experimentation here. Again, this is the last two days, my friends. This is the last two days. So here. Interesting work, right? And then puts out a variation.
00:52:09.596 - 00:52:36.908, Speaker A: I think everybody who bought the first one got the second. Okay, so just wild experimentation here on the blockchain. Alt bliss airdrop to collectors of the original Sophie Ogura edition of eight. And here's some of Sophie's work. So we saw this work here too. So kind of experimental pixel art glitch with an anime flavor, right? And just kind of edgy. Very edgy.
00:52:36.908 - 00:52:57.430, Speaker A: Continuing on, Elbie, and we are making our way to the end here. LB, the video artist with a new work. So an abstract work. And what is the title here? One in the same. And again, using Panasonic and Ederal Rescan from CRT monitor. Buy for five, addition at ten. And I thought this still was beautiful.
00:52:57.430 - 00:53:28.774, Speaker A: It's an edition of one available for 44 from LB here. So a very nice still, I thought. Kind of a glitched out. It looks like old VCR glitch or something. So, anyways, very nice work. Music. So House of the model is, you know, you might know, on tazos, and puts out this great track just on the twelve inch single, you know, tip or the rebirth of the single.
00:53:28.774 - 00:53:58.926, Speaker A: Just a cool house track. I mean, this is kind of like the soundtrack to what's going on here. It's just a good old fashioned party that's going on here. I mean, it's a good track. Two tazos, like, with all the. All the tunes. With all the tunes that are appearing on tezos.
00:53:58.926 - 00:54:38.938, Speaker A: Like, again, you could have music that's DJ'd from the blockchain and still be good at a party that's showing all this art, you know, a testament to the culture. So before I get too inspired, we will move on. How's the model? This was interesting as well. More experimentation. So this is Haliex, and this is AI art. But what I really liked about this was how it was kind of like an untraditional use of AI. This isn't our kind of classical, you know, we'll make a photorealistic person or like an 18th century painting.
00:54:38.938 - 00:55:06.260, Speaker A: Some of the tropes we often see and love, by the way. But here's just like, a bit more of an edgy abstraction using AI. And we've seen some abstraction with AI. We talked a little bit about that yesterday and how some people were very excited about that, and as am I. So just an interesting AI work. This is using AI. What is it? Artificially illustrated glitch, western primer for machine learners.
00:55:06.260 - 00:55:31.228, Speaker A: So I assume that means. Yeah, an AI here. This by John Cates, whose name I've seen quite a bit on Twitter and the blockchain. So here's some of his art. I think we've shown a couple of works in the past, so kind of a western, kind of glitched out cowboy. And there's another one which kind of goes really well with it. You can almost imagine the cowboy going through the plains here and then coming across the mountains.
00:55:31.228 - 00:55:46.042, Speaker A: So, anyways, some interesting glitch editions of five. I think. These are all sold out. Yes, sold out in a few hours. 3 hours here. And continuing on, Sky Goodman. Shout out to Sky Goodman.
00:55:46.042 - 00:56:29.764, Speaker A: Thanks for appearing on the program, who has a ton going on. Listen to the show if you want to hear everything Sky Goodman's up to and his process. You know, runetune was mentioning maybe we should have kind of like a weekly guest. And I think it's a great idea just to go more in depth with, say, one person each week at the Twitter spaces. So we're floating that idea around and seeing what we can come up with. So anyways, I've had artists reach out and say, hey, do you do interviews? And I don't, but maybe, just maybe, the Twitter space is basically a similar idea. So anyways, from the lost sneaker series, I believe, where Skye Goodman incorporates IA artificial intelligence into his sneaker series.
00:56:29.764 - 00:56:59.708, Speaker A: And really interesting here. Here you get a lot of three dimensionality, and here it's almost pretty flat. So interesting work going on. And again, it looks like a Sky Goodman piece. Ilay Aylay discovered this very interesting AI artwork. So another artist, I mean, Ilay, again, if you want to find some very interesting art, Ilay is a great curator from my perspective. So anyways, just another interesting AI artist.
00:56:59.708 - 00:57:20.144, Speaker A: This time it is oblique oblivion, digital, and AI, according to Ilay, really beautiful. Totally. Look at this. I can't remember where I found this. It was on Twitter, though. And what I found so interesting about this, and I'm pretty sure it's an AI artwork. It is an AI artwork.
00:57:20.144 - 00:58:01.364, Speaker A: I'm like, it doesn't say, but like, it sure seems that way. Look at the hand and everything is. This is a really different take on AI from a subject matter point of view, from a content point of view. Like, it's kind of plain, you know, it's called separation, I think, and it's like a couple. There are some people who can stay in your heart, but not in your life. So this is really interesting, right? This is someone doing kind of like a poetic work about separation, but using AI, right? So it's got a bit of a different feel to it and the wall and everything. So pretty interesting buy for four, edition of a thousand.
00:58:01.364 - 00:58:26.616, Speaker A: Wow. And it might have even all sold out for all we know. Loading up this history may crash my computer here. But anyways, selling, accepting offers and transferred to a bunch of people. Okay, so anyways, really, really nice work here. Clownvamp. As we wrap up here with another interesting work, kind of a surrealist work.
00:58:26.616 - 00:58:54.858, Speaker A: Interesting light. It's called screen time. A piece about moral panic and my ETH Genesis. So he is on manifold XYZ. Shall we take a very quick look at his manifold and see what's going on here? 907 minted at zero three. So that is, how much is that? I'll very quickly do the math here and answer phone calls after. Let's just quickly go.
00:58:54.858 - 00:59:19.894, Speaker A: 907 times 0.03. Wow. 27 ETH. Is that correct? 907 times 0.033. That says 29.9. ETH my, oh my, my, oh my. So that is impressive.
00:59:19.894 - 00:59:40.942, Speaker A: Yeah. So anyways, clownvamp with a huge sale. This is another interesting kind of AI work. Din burns Gmfam. Something is coming. So again, kind of just playing around some interesting experimentation here. Zoom with some, continues with these much richer textures.
00:59:40.942 - 01:00:11.444, Speaker A: Like the other textures were rich, but these seem a little richer in the last couple of days. The last couple of releases here in her AI work, and they're nice slow editions here. So it continues to be very interesting, very attractive prices, just continues to be a really attractive AI series and different. She really does her own thing. Totally recognizable as hers. My mom likes to say, you know, it's great that your work is recognizable as yours, and it's true. That is a nice thing to have.
01:00:11.444 - 01:00:42.596, Speaker A: This was another interesting experimentation. Big bad rex AI art here. So kind of a, you know, half drawing looking Tyrannosaurus rex. And finally, as we wrap up here, Marina, again, this is the last 48 hours I'm running through these. So these works were released and they were quite beautiful here by Marina Amadova. And that was co created with Igor Tsaruk. So a really nice collaboration here with AI.
01:00:42.596 - 01:01:15.196, Speaker A: I think the colors, it was a really fascinating collaboration in the sense that I think the colors changed a little bit and it really just gave a new take on her work. Again here, looking really nice here. And here is Igor Saruk. So I guess these are the ones maybe that he finished. And those are the ones that she finished, I'm guessing. And I brought up a couple of those. He's got this super high resolution style, and you see some of the spheres and kind of like the twin type element that are in her works.
01:01:15.196 - 01:01:55.094, Speaker A: Interesting bottom here, I guess that's a table. Interesting compositionally at the bottom here, Igor Tsaruk, edition of two and chicken pox. Again, part of the collaboration. And again, very high resolution looking work here. And finally we have edge Q with kind of an 18th century moog here. Organo electronico by Lorenzo Musante, edition of five, available for four, interestingly, in a field. So again, continues the AI and a take on flavor flav with that huge clock that he was known for from public enemy lord Flavius.
01:01:55.094 - 01:02:22.434, Speaker A: Flava Flav. Good title from Edgecube Buy for 25, edition of five. So I am really enjoying that series there. And Ilya Shkipin with his AI sculpture, you know. So again, keep your eyes open for that. Looks like the real, looks like a photo of a real sculpture here. So again, super interesting, but only rendered as a two dimensional image.
01:02:22.434 - 01:02:37.658, Speaker A: So it's AI sculpture is a two dimensional image. And finally, Mister shapeless with some nice pieces to close us out here. Prague, where I visited. I highly recommend Prague. Halloween. It was great. Look at these great clouds here too.
01:02:37.658 - 01:03:08.008, Speaker A: New world GM. So Mister Shapeless seems to be just effortlessly putting out beautiful works here. I'm not sure if we looked at this one. If we did, it's worth looking at again. I mean, you gotta love too how the sunset is showing up the reflection on these mountains here and almost our figures here with the long kind of Salvador dali like shadows. Beautiful work, beautiful color, beautiful contrast between the blue and the orange. And walk with a beautiful physical work here.
01:03:08.008 - 01:03:37.848, Speaker A: Look at how good he is with the spray can getting these beautiful drips. And even just the originality of the yellow and the blue and the red dots at auction for 100 spray on paper. And the JPEG is available for 100 edition of one pimpa. Very nice. Simple work. The drips are beautiful, aren't they? The whole thing, I mean, really turned the spray paint and spray can into a real art form. Not that it wasn't before, but really making it his own.
01:03:37.848 - 01:03:43.624, Speaker A: Anyway, that is your show everyone. Thanks as always. You guys are the best. Until next time, take care.
