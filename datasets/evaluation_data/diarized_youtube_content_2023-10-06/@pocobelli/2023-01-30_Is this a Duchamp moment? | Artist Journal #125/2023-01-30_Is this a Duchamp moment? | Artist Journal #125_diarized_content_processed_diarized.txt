00:00:03.840 - 00:00:38.006, Speaker A: Last call, everyone. The collectors have arrived. It's more exciting than the news, this show. For me, speaking for myself, it's more exciting putting this together than reading the news, which is just fascinating to me. Artist journal, January 30, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, self proclaimed artist reporter, which probably does not mean what you think it means, but we will go into that at a future time here.
00:00:38.006 - 00:00:59.810, Speaker A: So, yeah, a ton of developments. Let's get into it. There is a ton to get through today. I feel bad. I feel bad for Aylay because I just think, okay, like, what can I take out of here? And then I feel bad for the artist. So anyway, let's go, RJ. Now, do you know who RJ is? RJ is the.
00:00:59.810 - 00:01:39.064, Speaker A: I want to say, the author, the artist behind this homage to Edwin Hopper here. Is it Edwin or Edward? We'll look in a second. And his trademark are these computers in these kind of famous, serene kind of paintings, like the kind we see here. And we'll look at the original, which, of course, we all know, which is extremely famous. And then he'll put his trademark laptop with a screensaver, a beautiful screensaver. And we're gonna look at some of his other work here. Anyway, this is on foundation, so you can get an ETH.
00:01:39.064 - 00:02:05.914, Speaker A: One of one. I don't even want to tell anybody here, but, you know, ETH is at 160. Do I have an extra $160? Probably not. You know, like, you can always justify it, but, I mean, you can get a one of one. RJ, at least kick off the auction for 0.1. He is too good of an artist to be left on the sidelines like this, which is why I, you know, mention him here today. Do what I can.
00:02:05.914 - 00:02:22.094, Speaker A: He is a wonderful artist. Edwin Hopper's Nighthawks 1942. Well, let's just bring that up, and then we'll look at some of RJ's work as well. Very quickly. Let's just go. Edwin Hopper. So we all know this painting.
00:02:22.094 - 00:02:44.356, Speaker A: Oh, he actually got the color, like, pretty bang on, actually. Isn't that interesting? Look at that. So there it is. Okay. Google arts and culture. And so his remix. So he talks about the painting in night screens, a pixel reworking of Hopper's painting.
00:02:44.356 - 00:03:23.940, Speaker A: These distant figures are replaced with screens, one of which glows briefly before darkening again. Through this adaption, night screens asks how computers might inform notions of distance and disengagement. Does Hopper's famous scene become more or less human in the absence of its lonely figures? You know, I call it RJ's poetry. He is a great poet, as now most of you probably, you know, probably half the audience, I'm guessing, is familiar with RJ, maybe less. We haven't looked at RJ for a while, and it's grown a lot in the last month here. Anyways, he does great works like this. And I mean, these are his trademarks here.
00:03:23.940 - 00:03:39.304, Speaker A: They are all gone. Unfortunately, I missed some one of ones just a couple of weeks ago. They were expensive, but they were still worth getting. Let me just quickly bring up. Yeah, I actually have this. This is an edition of five, and this is a great one, too. This is called community.
00:03:39.304 - 00:04:01.974, Speaker A: Okay? So see the irony here. And. Really nice. Now, this brings up a whole other issue, because it's like, oh, well, according to my definition of pixel art, this is pixel art. It's art with a square brush. I'm starting to revise my definition because I'm realizing that is an insufficient definition. I'm starting to think we need to incorporate low resolution into the definition.
00:04:01.974 - 00:04:36.764, Speaker A: And Ed Morolla kind of highlighted that about a month ago with his definition of pixel art. So it's something we'll return to here, but just in passing, because is this pixel art? Maybe you could maybe technically say kind of, but it doesn't feel like pixel art to me. This feels like digital painting, but done in a kind of semi pixelated form. Anyway, all these genres bleed into each other, and we're going to discuss that in a second here. Anyways, look at how poetic this work is. Edition of five. So a great, great artist computer in a small city.
00:04:36.764 - 00:05:01.344, Speaker A: The system is a lonely hunter. And do we have any others here? These sold. This broke my heart to see these sell just a few weeks ago. These beautiful works here. So it's part of a nice, beautiful series. This came out in 2021, you know, what is that, a year and a half ago, this work here. So anyways, he is an awesome artist and he has a work.
00:05:01.344 - 00:05:30.522, Speaker A: I think it's his first on Ethereum. I'm not positive on that, but this is available for a song at one ETH to at least start the auction. So there you go. RJ is in the house and continuing on. Quick shout out and thank you to Pauly Jojo. I think he got the last fire on primary, so that's kind of exciting. And also to Sir Gadfly, who has that great writing there, for picking up a rainbow of the eight bit nature series.
00:05:30.522 - 00:06:16.350, Speaker A: So thanks, guys. That helps me enormously to just help fund my collecting ambitions and also encourages my art ambitions as well. Continuing on. So for those in Berlin or nearby Berlin, I'm putting on a little show. It's very low key and experimental, the genres of digital art, where I'm basically, just, as we were discussing there with pixel art and digital painting, it's kind of top of mind right now because I've been putting together, I haven't left my apartment for like 72 hours. Thankfully, my girlfriend visited at some point to just give me some human contact because I've been putting this show together, this very low key, just inviting friends and some art people. I know it's going to be at Zedbar in Berlin.
00:06:16.350 - 00:07:10.364, Speaker A: They have a little movie theater at the back. And I'm basically going to just, it's not meant to be the final word at all, but more of just opening a kind of conversation of sorts of how do we start to categorize and classify the genres of digital art? Because, and the reason why I think that's even necessary, because you might say, well, why do we need to do that? Is because when you first arrive somewhere like object, it's a little overwhelming, especially like, you know, you don't know what to make. You have videos here, you have gifs here. What Sabato calls what I, what I'm interpreting as Sabato calling media art. He used that great term because I was like, oh, should there be a category called gifs? But some gifs are like animated short movies, whereas others, you know, so all to say, I've been working this out in my head. They are not clear, distinct lines. And anyways, that's.
00:07:10.364 - 00:07:27.004, Speaker A: I'm going to give a little introductory remarks at 830. I say it's a 30 minutes loop. It's probably going to be 60. Kind of like, this show kind of tends to go longer than I want or expect. Entrance is free. So it's basically just to kind of take on things. And that is that.
00:07:27.004 - 00:07:52.744, Speaker A: That'll be in Berlin at Zedbar this Wednesday. So it'd be great to see you there if you're local. So this was sent to me. This is, you know, this is really interesting and kind of funny, but not in a bad way, just kind of like. So Luke 500 sent this to me. So he is on top of the whole institutional side of NFTs. And so he sent this to me.
00:07:52.744 - 00:08:24.130, Speaker A: And of course I asked him if I could share this and he said, of course. So look at this. LA collection or LA collection IO NFT platform certified by the world's greatest museums, the British Museum, Anna Cultus Gallery, which I haven't heard of. Leopold Museum, MFA, Boston. I've heard of the British Museum. Maybe you've heard of all these museums. Anyways, the point is, they have a work, racehorses at Longchamp by Edward Degas.
00:08:24.130 - 00:08:57.756, Speaker A: Degas. It's not Degas, it's Degu, the pronunciation, according to a video I watched from the great courses, history of impressionism or something like that, which I highly recommend. So anyways, you can claim your free Degas from la collection IO. And it's just interesting to see what they're doing here. So, typology of artwork. Oil on canvas sale, ongoing editions unlimited. And interestingly, on polygon.
00:08:57.756 - 00:09:50.282, Speaker A: Okay, so ERC 721, not 1155, which is kind of interesting because I thought as a edition it would be 1155. So maybe each one is being done kind of un. I'm not sure what that means. So anyways, all to say, we wonder out loud to ourselves here oftentimes, what are the institutions thinking and what are they up to here? Where are they? Frankly, where are they? I mean, this is what they're doing. They are. And we've had this whole debate on the physical versus the digital NFt and the collectibility of the physical NFT. Again, and I'm all for people having fun and selling whatever they want and frankly, doing whatever they want, but from my own personal perspective, this is a photograph of an artwork.
00:09:50.282 - 00:10:24.700, Speaker A: This isn't the artwork. Okay? So they are, in a sense, when you see a photo of, like, a physical painting that is not at all changed, and that changes everything. Even if you put a filter on it, to me, that kind of starts to change the equation. It's not a black or white issue, but when you have a photo of a painting like this is, they're set, they're for free. I mean, they're not charging anything, but they're giving away a photo of a painting of a Degas in an unlimited edition. So anyways, you can collect that at la collection IO. Thank you, Luke.
00:10:24.700 - 00:10:44.522, Speaker A: 500 for the shout out. Now, a lot of you have seen this. And so the Medici minutes. So Cosimo de Medici puts out a newsletter, widely read. And a lot of us saw this this weekend. So here's the letter. And here, let me just bring it up here.
00:10:44.522 - 00:11:08.658, Speaker A: Two chains, point number four. If you've been paying attention, let me see if I can make this bigger here. If you've been paying attention. You know, I'm a big fan of the art. Dropped on Tazos. For many artists, Tazos is the chain for experimentation. Because, you see, many artists do not want their experimental works to sit as part of their main body of work.
00:11:08.658 - 00:11:25.666, Speaker A: I'd say this all rings quite true, actually. I mean, it's true for myself. You don't necessarily want to put a sketch that you made on super rare. You might want to put that on an object. Right. Makes sense. So it may be the case that there are two main chains used for minting art in the future.
00:11:25.666 - 00:12:13.672, Speaker A: Now, this is quite an, I don't want to call it an admission, but it's quite a statement from Cosimo de Medici, who is probably, I would say indisputably, maybe not indisputably, I was going to say, like the premier collector on Ethereum. I guess there's like punk 6529. But I mean, he's in the, we could say in the top, you know, very rarefied error, you know, like very top category of very few people. As far as the millions of dollars he spent on works and just overall influence on the scene, whether people, in a sense, like it or not. Right? I mean, he is an influential personality and person. So when he says something like this, again, I'm not saying we all have to love this, but I agree with everything he's said here. So why, in a sense, I love it.
00:12:13.672 - 00:12:39.068, Speaker A: This is great. Tezos is being celebrated. And it's kind of. I don't want to say it's long overdue, but it's. Let's put it this way, and then we'll go back into this. To me, there's an inevitability of if the art is good, time is your friend, right? And we're kind of all about time out here. The money is secondary, and money is incredibly important.
00:12:39.068 - 00:13:06.672, Speaker A: And I love financial markets. But time is the big game, as we've discussed previously. And if you're. If there's good art here, then if you have that conviction, then time is on your side. Time will work it out, time will find it all and sort it out for us. And I think that's what's happening here. There's an inevitability if the art is in fact good and worthwhile and relevant and necessary.
00:13:06.672 - 00:13:41.874, Speaker A: If it's kind of. If the scene is not the same without this art, then it is, you know, time is on your side. So continuing on ETH, where artists meant their primary body of work is more expensive, Tezos, where artists can experiment separately from their primary body of work with less expensive drops. Here's the odd thing, though. Much of the art on Tezos is better than what I see on ETH. Collectors don't sleep. Who are your favorite Tezos artists? At me on Twitter using Medichi minutes.
00:13:41.874 - 00:14:16.576, Speaker A: So this is also. I would be tempted to call this an admission, because otherwise, why haven't we been talking about. Why hasn't Cosimo been talking about the Tezos art for the last year? I mean, I'm sure he's mentioned it here and there, but he's kind of all in is sort of how I'd put it here. Collectors don't sleep. And this speaks to our whole theme that we've been discussing, really, since, you know, the x copy UK scene situation. We saw it earlier with Lewis Osborne. There was a small migration.
00:14:16.576 - 00:14:57.722, Speaker A: At least that was the sense, right? Because we were starting to see pretty extreme prices way back in August. Like when I started this show more than about six months ago. And so now it's quite interesting. And then there was the x copy effect, when x copy basically more or less digitally shook the hand and gave the benediction to X scene. Well deserved. And so now, as I said, last call, I am seeing things heat up pretty significantly from. And it's sort of like the artists you would kind of expect, like, you know, pixel artists, like mech TXT.
00:14:57.722 - 00:15:23.294, Speaker A: We're going to look at his page and, I mean, there's offers like, you know, works that I bought that felt really expensive at 100 tezos, like three weeks ago. Now you can't. There are offers for 100, and people are not selling. Okay. Like, it is heating up. As he says, collectors don't sleep. As I'm saying, last call, you know, and there are still pockets of goodness to be found.
00:15:23.294 - 00:16:11.186, Speaker A: There are still pockets of goodness to be found. But it is, you know, you have to dig deeper and deeper. And oddly here, I'd say RJ is know and not to overhype RJ here, but there's the deal, and it's on ETH. Okay, so anyways, continuing on, as I said to myself, is this a Duchamp moment with Robnis official here, Robnis V two. So he takes, speaking of Xcopy, and this is probably Xcopi's most famous work here, right click and save guy. And so this is a work many of us know. And so x copy is well known to be cc zero, which is, from all my understanding, limited understanding, really, but I think it's pretty straightforward.
00:16:11.186 - 00:16:56.988, Speaker A: It's basically open copyright. Do whatever you want with it. So Robnis V two said, okay, fine, I'm going to put up the work and basically, without saying it, use my name, because I don't think anybody could just do this. I think the fact that Robnis official is doing it and who has already kind of had some history of kind of conceptual and ideas and kind of quote unquote conceptual games, is saying, okay, I'll put it up with my name and put it at 0.01. I don't think there's a limit to the amount. Like, there's no time limit on this either. And finally, so he's basically taking the right click and save guy, and he's right click and saving it, right? And then he's saying.
00:16:56.988 - 00:17:15.508, Speaker A: And he's uploading and he's saying, let's see if this works. Why buy it when I can right click and save as. So his experiment is paying off. Well, he put it very cheap, smartly. Another open edition 629 have been minted so far. This is at like 500 this morning. So that's 6.3
00:17:15.508 - 00:17:42.392, Speaker A: ETH, which these days is probably over $10,000. So you gotta love it. You gotta love it. I mean, is that happening in the contemporary art scene too much? You know, like, I'm sure if that happened to a famous artist, they'd be like, what a great day. And not to say that Robnis v two isn't famous, but you know what I'm saying? Like a top tier. This is a good day for what I would consider a top tier contemporary artist. In terms of intake.
00:17:42.392 - 00:18:19.152, Speaker A: If you're bringing in 10,000 from an idea you had last night, you got to feel good about that, wherever you are in this world, right? So continuing on, another open edition, this time from Kappn. And look at how beautiful this is. A beautiful, beautiful pixel work. And again, this contrast of the static black and white pixels with the dynamic color colored pixels is wonderful. We see it in his plants series or where he goes under the name of plants. Anyways, he is also selling for 0.01. And this seems to be the trend is lower, sells for more.
00:18:19.152 - 00:18:35.784, Speaker A: And he's got a day and a half left, more than a day and a half left. And twelve have been minted so far. So pretty good. Again, like, I mean, even if this was all that was to be minted, and I'm sure there will be far more. Twelve. I mean, you're looking at a couple hundred bucks. Okay.
00:18:35.784 - 00:19:06.540, Speaker A: I mean, who's complaining, right? I'm not, like, we have no right to complain in this area. Again, being out in Berlin here, you know, and before the pandemic, I would go out a lot to galleries and stuff with a lot of friends. Nobody's making $200, like, with some. With zero material costs and, you know, just out of, you know, thin air, out of like a day of work or maybe who knows how long that took. But let's say three days of work. It's not like, you know, it's not that common. Okay.
00:19:06.540 - 00:19:31.858, Speaker A: And not filling out little art scrants and whatever. This is free market. Okay. So anyways, continuing on, Charles AI. So just on the open editions, Charles AI is the only negative comments I've gotten on this YouTube are on Charles AI. But in Charles AI's defense, Charles AI is bringing up topical issues. So I bring them up again, sort of like Cosimo, we don't have to agree.
00:19:31.858 - 00:20:11.214, Speaker A: Like, I don't, you know, I don't. The important thing is that important issues are being brought up and then let the discussion go wherever it wants. Right? So continuing on, Charles AI open editions are like prints. Time has already shown us that this meta, I'm not sure if he wrote the right word there, is viable both for artists and collectors, maybe medium meta. It allows artists to earn money from their art drives value to one of ones and limited editions for serious collectors. And you get cool art at low prices. Well, again, I think you can collect an open edition and still be serious.
00:20:11.214 - 00:20:59.848, Speaker A: But the spirit of his point, I actually agree with, like, why not? Like when I did my little experiment, you know, there, I got new collectors or new people collected my work that didn't previously, so why not? And it's kind of fun, you know, again, this low cost, like, people are building nice little art collections on the cheap. And who's to say in ten or 15 years that these won't be worth a lot of money? Or 50 years, who knows, right? So it's a win win win situation. And I agree. I mean, they are coming. I'm seeing more and more criticism of the open editions, you know, but that's inevitable. You know, it's sort of like trends don't last that long in this business. And I'm actually impressed at the sustainability, frankly, of open editions.
00:20:59.848 - 00:21:26.202, Speaker A: When I did it, like a month ago, I felt like I was very late to the party. I was almost embarrassed to do it, frankly, because I felt like I was so late. But it's still happening and it's going and people are making money. So this is great. So maybe it's just going to become a, you know, a fixture of sorts, which I think would be awesome. Who knows? Louis Ponce. So we've been looking at Louis Ponce's works on Twitter.
00:21:26.202 - 00:22:06.578, Speaker A: These works here that have been posted. I didn't realize they were for a tazos drop that he was working on. So anyways, this collection dropped of three works here, a collection of fragmented existences. And look at the, you know, look at the offers and the prices here. We've noted before maybe a month ago that Louise Ponce has a very kind of impressive, for lack of better term, I was going to say fan base, but collector base, let's put it that way. This addition of 40, there's already an offer for 300. You'd have to pay 1500 on secondary here.
00:22:06.578 - 00:22:31.128, Speaker A: This addition of 50 has an offer of 1300. And again, no takers. That's maybe the most significant part here. 1300 and no takers for an addition of 50. And this one you can get for 80, but there's 1000. I mean, maybe that's the most impressive of all, an offer for 80, which is not being taken as of yet. So this looks like it was a pretty huge sale.
00:22:31.128 - 00:22:46.728, Speaker A: A collection of fragmented existences. 46,162 tezos. And he had a statement here. I'm still processing all of this, but we are the top collection on object.com today. Fragmented existence, all time high. We beat effects, hash total volume.
00:22:46.728 - 00:23:18.694, Speaker A: Just insane. Much love to all of you supporting my art. Again, it feels like a golden era in this business, doesn't it? I mean, it's tempting. Like we. It's tempting to take this for granted in this space. Like if you watch this show or if you've just been paying attention on Twitter, it's become kind of normal that this kind of, this is like, it's not an uncommon news story like this, but these, this is astonishing. Like, we're seeing a real kind of fusion of.
00:23:18.694 - 00:23:43.642, Speaker A: And you know, I'm not trying to be political here, but of free market forces and artists. Like, that's what we're seeing here. And where's the middle people? It's the artist and the collector, right? So this really is, to use a cliche, this is truly disruptive, what we're seeing here. Anyways, let's look at the art. So this is the one that's. You can buy for 1500. So I don't remember seeing this one.
00:23:43.642 - 00:23:58.796, Speaker A: And I don't think there's any volume on it. So just an interesting work. And I'm not. I think it's just Louise Ponce. Yeah, 2022. So just an interesting loop here. And here's the other.
00:23:58.796 - 00:24:21.174, Speaker A: We saw this on Twitter. Let's see if we can load it up and. Yeah, so we saw this on Twitter before, and he seems to be mixing quite a few different kind of styles here, like 3d collage. I don't even know how he gets the eyeball. Maybe some movie stuff. I don't know. But there's a lot going on here.
00:24:21.174 - 00:24:39.694, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get the other. And I think we looked at this one, too, but this was the drop anyways. And you basically get the picture here. Let me just forgive the Internet. You'd think Berlin would be at the cutting edge of Internet, but it's remarkably slow. Anyways, there it is. That's the series.
00:24:39.694 - 00:25:06.318, Speaker A: So congratulations to Luis Ponce. And another kind of big sale for UK scene here. And this was, I believe, on Friday. Another day in paradise. And it's an interesting work. Let's actually look at the work first. At first, it kind of had a bit of a 1980s feel in terms of, like, just kind of like the spray on what looks like kind of a cube background.
00:25:06.318 - 00:25:51.266, Speaker A: But the more I looked at it, the more it looks like it's a mirror in a bathroom or something. I'm just guessing that's kind of graffitied over, almost like you're in a nightclub. And there is the dude with an unhappy face looking over at the sticker of the surveillance camera in the mirror. So kind of a surrealist thing going on there. Nice little details here. I mean, we see Oxine's experience as basically doing zines and graphics in little details like this with the recycle sign that's kind of in the broken mirror, kind of fragmented there, and then the fire. And then, of course, are you verified down here? And a little bit of graffiti there.
00:25:51.266 - 00:26:04.814, Speaker A: So really gorgeous. That matte black, different variations of matte black. Very nice. And, of course, the friar figure. So let's just look. So accepted offers. I think it was a very quick sale.
00:26:04.814 - 00:26:45.894, Speaker A: Like, I'm taking, you know, the top ten offers in an hour or something. And so between 433 and 250. And again, we're almost at a dollar 20 tezos, which, you know, a year ago would have been a nightmare. But now, again, like, if he's selling for 300, that extra 20%, that's also in $360. And if you're selling at 433 times 1.2, I mean, that's over $500. Okay, so that extra 20% there, 15, 18% that you get on the tezos versus the dollar is not to be dismissed.
00:26:45.894 - 00:27:18.418, Speaker A: We missed this last episode. A really interesting kind of heartwarming image from the myth. It looks like he's had a baby or something. I'm just guessing. But we see a little baby myth here, and kind of this is very reminiscent of Christ giving benediction, you know, the whole, shall we say? And so here is the myth. And then the trademark green and pink coming out of the two fingers there. Classic, you know, contemporary clothing as usual within the.
00:27:18.418 - 00:27:52.644, Speaker A: Almost like adidas, like whatever these shoes, sandals or whatever these are called. Flippers, I can't remember with myth colors here. Interesting candles here, too, as if it's like an altar where you'd normally have a picture of the Christ or the Virgin Mary with the baby Jesus here. It's almost the myth as, like, the virgin, the Virgin Mary. That's almost how this feels. So. But then kind of combined with Christ and then the baby.
00:27:52.644 - 00:28:13.972, Speaker A: So mysterious work. He's got a real surrealist edge to him. And then look at, like, again, this kind of man, almost like out of the watchman here. Green and pink, those same colors, and then yellow. There's a real surrealist element in the blood, so. And then the clouds, you know, trademark. So beautiful work there.
00:28:13.972 - 00:28:36.480, Speaker A: And this work just came out, I think, this morning. Man's ruin. Patagonica. Tony Montana in heaven thinking what his mistake was. So we actually got a comment from Runetune, actually, the other day on how that more lackos work with the horse and the guy taking the selfie was actually a reference to the Sopranos. We have another. I think Tony Montana is sopranos.
00:28:36.480 - 00:28:55.520, Speaker A: Right. I've never watched the Sopranos. I don't really have Netflix. I watched the first half season of Mad Men, and that's as far as I've gone in the whole streaming direction. So very limited. But this seems to be a reference to the sopranos, I think. Correct me if I'm wrong out there.
00:28:55.520 - 00:29:24.554, Speaker A: And anyway, so just again, these yellow figures are now entering the scene here again. And the blood and, of course, the trademark colors. Kind of a rougher work, which is interesting. Maybe made in a day or two, you know. And this sold out right away. This was listed at midnight, 1226. And basically, it looks like a pretty large edition and was gone on primary in 90 minutes.
00:29:24.554 - 00:29:44.894, Speaker A: Edition of 30 at 1010 tezos each. That's 300 tezos in 90 minutes. You got to feel good about that. Again, we're talking like, $360 now, aren't we? Board me, social club. And let me speed up here. We're already at the 30 minutes mark, okay? We got a cruise here. Board me social club.
00:29:44.894 - 00:30:05.894, Speaker A: A digital painting here is how I'd categorize this and a big, happy face. And what is the title here? Almost the wrestler mask that we often find in the myth. A little bit kind of a similar elements there. 06:30 a.m. So it looks like he's morning sunshine. And that is the title, so maybe he's going for a run. Staying in shape, pretty dark, muted colors.
00:30:05.894 - 00:30:28.840, Speaker A: Interesting. And then combining with this big kinda neon green, lime green. Another one, la Planet sauvage. And this is a digital painting. Sad story. So again, just kind of a mysterious surrealist work here. It looks like kind of an octopus figure that, you know, the brains are coming out.
00:30:28.840 - 00:30:55.860, Speaker A: Who knows? Interesting sky too, looks like. Yeah, it looks like an alien planet here. Continuing on, Audie Woody with a play on the Last Supper, the last collective, which I actually think is a pretty funny title. I'm not sure I exactly get it, but it seems to be. I'm not exactly sure. I mean, we got the pirate flag, so I don't know if this is referencing. I don't know what this is referencing, to be honest.
00:30:55.860 - 00:31:29.848, Speaker A: But there's Audie Woody as the Christ in Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper. And McDonald's mixed in some empty fries and a meteor hitting the cross, and a horse split in two. Again, you wonder, is this a sopranos or something reference? This is also very interesting here. Photo booth. So it looks like a screenshot. And so as if, yeah, this is a photo of some kind taken from a laptop or something. Anyway, mysterious work.
00:31:29.848 - 00:31:45.488, Speaker A: Not sure what to make of it, but very interesting and worth showing a great new one from Audie Woody. Very interesting artist. The failed artist. Number 15. Self portrait, Genesis. And slip inside this house. May the circle be unbroken.
00:31:45.488 - 00:32:24.904, Speaker A: And the cock crew. So seems to be a reference to le Dejeuner Solelbe with this figure here, the pose, of course, Edward Manette, and of course, Manet based that on a classical statue. We really don't have time for this, but let's just see. Dejeuner sur l'elb. Manet. Okay, so we all know, right? So it looks like a reverse of this guy, right? See that? Now, this is a famous classical pose. Manet was not necessarily the person that came up with this, because if we go to the river God.
00:32:24.904 - 00:32:48.544, Speaker A: So Dejeuner sur Lelb, river God, we should see. Let's see. River God. Ancient. I think it's ancient Rome. Ancient Rome. This is in the capitoline museum.
00:32:48.544 - 00:33:03.898, Speaker A: If this is. I believe this is the one. Yeah. You see the river God here? This Dejeunesse. Now let's go. Don't believe me? Like, and you see the pose here, which is just like the Manet. And you see it's.
00:33:03.898 - 00:33:31.728, Speaker A: It's a similar pose. And you see here and over here. So it's kind of like it's thought that Manet got this from a classical reference. So again, this idea of quoting, quoting artworks, and we see it, I'd argue we see that here. It's quoted in La Dejeuner Solebe. So again, this conversation that happens over the millennia, like, this is what we're. This is the real game, I would say.
00:33:31.728 - 00:33:48.234, Speaker A: Okay. And so this can sell for whatever it wants. Nothing has changed as far as what is in this painting. Okay. This digital painting here. And a pretty funny painting with the Grim reaper in what looks like a bumper car coming for the failed artist. And the cock is crowing.
00:33:48.234 - 00:34:04.662, Speaker A: And there is like the crucifixion, the three crosses there. So more mayhem. Dan control with another new work of a computer. And really nicely done. Very interestingly right in his style. Buy for 200. So Greco is.
00:34:04.662 - 00:34:36.234, Speaker A: Everybody's loving this one as far as they're not letting go for a small amount of Tezos rustic digital art. Frank Ocean. So continuing with this very irrational iconography, you know, where we see, again, the shadows of birds in the cliff. And the cliff seems to be making a face a little bit. And then all the crop marios with question marks and even these outrageous clouds here. You can't do that. This is how a cloud is supposed to be making these very, I'd argue, difficult decisions.
00:34:36.234 - 00:35:03.494, Speaker A: And there's another one here, Les Telnite, also by rustic digital art and kind of almost like a rehash of the beach scene. But here's a sunset, and the question mark is kind of the sun. And then he puts the title inside the sun. So anyways, I mean, it's just really interesting. And the colors are totally different. Breaking rules that we are constantly creating for ourselves. The isolationist with an unusual.
00:35:03.494 - 00:35:45.776, Speaker A: Not an unusual work with, I don't almost say a classic isolationist work. If we go to his page very quickly here, then we go to run it generally does this kind of like portrait of sorts, almost like, not profile picture, but a portrait of sorts. And so here is another one, an edition of 20 very muted colors, almost like chalk that's been kind of erased over here. And a motive work. And let's just quickly see what happened on the market here. And sold for 30 on primary and 230 and was gone within basically 8 hours, an addition of 20 for 30. So 600 tezos.
00:35:45.776 - 00:36:17.314, Speaker A: Nice. Nice accumulation of tazos. So here is isolationist continuing on, Ed Morolla. So are we at. Here we go, Ed Marolla, with some more challenging. Is this pixel art? Right. So these are the kind of questions I ask myself, because this pixel art is turning more and more into digital painting with this blur blurring out of the pixels, isn't it? If the pixels are being blurred out, is it pixel art? So this is a strange one.
00:36:17.314 - 00:36:50.214, Speaker A: Pixel dinner and looking like, you know, so continuing with these very surrealist themes. I mean, this almost looks like a play on, you know, ancient greek tragedy. Who is it? Aeschylus. Aeschylus. What looks like aeschylus? It's Aeschylus, I believe is the pronunciation. And it looks like this. Someone is being served a baby, as Agamemnon was being served at that dinner by his wife.
00:36:50.214 - 00:37:05.734, Speaker A: Agamemnon's, yeah, lover was Cassandra. And then the wife. What was her name again? Doesn't matter. It escapes me. But that's almost what this makes me feel. The king eating the babies here. Looks like classical greek mythology.
00:37:05.734 - 00:37:39.830, Speaker A: Another one, forearm painter. So a portrait of an artist here painting naked with vines going across a vase. Is this a self portrait? But it almost looks like female at the top and male at the bottom, you know? So, again, more wild work. The pixels are being blurred out, and we have this little. So, again, just more strange, this obelisk here. It looks good, though, doesn't it? I mean, so purple dream, again, has a very strong surrealist flavor, doesn't it? Purple lovers. One more that came out this weekend.
00:37:39.830 - 00:37:56.318, Speaker A: So he's putting out lots of work. And you see, again, challenging with the blurry pixels here and this. Beautiful. But look at where it's going. Like, I mean, look at the sky. Look at this beautiful, kind of dithered sky. But, I mean, it's really going somewhere.
00:37:56.318 - 00:38:19.384, Speaker A: There's nothing like this out there. And that's. I'm assuming that's Ed, maybe Ed and his girlfriend or wife. And, you know, is that a museum here? Anyways, the mind wanders there. Buy for 30, edition of 29. So this was he selling these all for 30 and then sold. Wow.
00:38:19.384 - 00:38:30.700, Speaker A: Okay. Transferred. Got it. So he transferred most of them. I was gonna say, that's pretty impressive. Okay, continuing on, Uri J. With a new experimental work.
00:38:30.700 - 00:38:50.532, Speaker A: And again, not afraid to experiment here. Just playing with different digital textures and colors. Kind of a nice composition, I'd say. Rivers and tides edition of eleven, available for five. That's pretty reasonable. One left. And continuing on, a new one by Santiago.
00:38:50.532 - 00:39:35.802, Speaker A: This one's square, which is interesting. And what else was on here? Inkscape, gimp blender with pieces of VR sculpture. So again, incorporating different elements somewhere from AI. And what's interesting is they all kind of work together. I would never know that these came from different sources, but almost this digital, you know, just don't want to call it just this digital extras, this digital, what is the word? It escapes me, this digital stuff that is being reprocessed and put into, you know, Santiago style on canvas. Again, square this time, nice one from Acidboy. Let's get that going.
00:39:35.802 - 00:39:58.886, Speaker A: Maybe there's sound. No sound. This is a reserve of 0.8 life cycle. So I think he liked being called a master of psychedelic abstraction. Another thing I wouldn't have remembered me saying, but he mentioned it on Twitter. And I mean, it does seem that he is a master of psychedelic abstraction.
00:39:58.886 - 00:40:28.650, Speaker A: And we could at least call this psychedelic abstraction. I don't know who's doing kind of more psychedelic animated works, but who knows? There's probably all sorts of people. To infinity and beyond. A really nice one from Acidboy on super rare and native ed with a new one. Echoes of data overload avoided. Please refresh the page. So continuing with this theme of kind of like this digital life that we live, we saw the last one was kind of a reference to your wallet being drained and ledger.
00:40:28.650 - 00:40:59.702, Speaker A: And so here's another one, kind of on our digital life with these figures, echoes of datas. And we got a few from Eizo. And how are we doing for time? Okay, we got a cruise here. So some very nice, what I think we could call glitch work from continuing the furniture series. So this looks great. This is future Credenza. And here is another one, future bar cart again, the word I keep using is rich when I see this work.
00:40:59.702 - 00:41:18.652, Speaker A: So very nice. Glitch work again, I guess we'd call it. And this lamp is great as well. Edition of 30. And they've been selling really well, like I noticed. I'll be lucky to pick one up on primary, and I'll get an offer like 2 hours later for more. So anyways, looking great.
00:41:18.652 - 00:41:32.014, Speaker A: Future lamp. Awesome title. Great work. Doctor version. Shout out to doctor version, who gave some nice props to the show. Irradiance cascade. So another, I think we could call this glitch as well.
00:41:32.014 - 00:42:08.690, Speaker A: Just playing with video and sort of in the same spirit. And it's a gif though, playing in the same spirit as those other works we looked at by Doctor Virgin. So interesting. Codonacazono with another contrast. And let's see if I can make that bigger of kind of animated globular, organic shapes with this kind of pixelated background with, you know, large geometries in the background and even this sphere. So just continuing with that contrast there, which I think is quite interesting. Buy for $14.99
00:42:08.690 - 00:42:24.814, Speaker A: edition of five. And that's on secondary. Let's just see what happened here. Six tezos on primary gone within basically six minutes. So well done there. Nice low edition. Low editions are attractive.
00:42:24.814 - 00:42:50.924, Speaker A: This is from Teen Wolf two, the artist formerly known as Hasdrubal waffle. And this is kind of. I'll just play a little bit of this so I don't want to blow out people's square wave generator corrupted by pink noise. Here we go. So kind of wild. And you can see almost the trademark textured brushstroke here. So interesting addition of three.
00:42:50.924 - 00:43:23.322, Speaker A: Let's just see what happened. Sent to friends, basically. There's the isolationist, and one sold for 22 to Icaro and one sent to little cakes. And here's another one by the artist formerly known as Hasdrubal Waffle. Lazorda 89. So if you're my age, you would remember the World Series in 1989 when the LA Dodgers played the Oakland A's and Tommy Lasorda was the coach. And if we had more time, I would bring up a picture of Tommy Lasorda.
00:43:23.322 - 00:43:57.064, Speaker A: This is hilarious. Signature collection, hats, cleats and slip ups. So just kind of another super highly textured experimental work by what I want to call Hasdrubal waffle. Now, teen wolf two, who has changed his name. And so anyways, more beautiful stuff. I don't know if it's made again with Mario paint or whatever, but I consider this digital painting, even though it's got gif like properties. Right? So all of these, there are different ways of attacking digital art in terms of the classification you can go by.
00:43:57.064 - 00:44:32.072, Speaker A: Is it, you know, a paint, is it a gif, is it a video? But that actually starts to break down because some videos, like I was saying earlier, kind of work as gifs and some gifs work as kind of look like animated shorts, you know? So anyways, I'm going to get into that more. I may do the Twitter spaces on the genres of digital art as well, and just. We'll see. But I'll talk to Runetune today and we'll figure out our topic. I think that could be an interesting one, though. And just discussing definitions of pixel art. And let's have a real discussion.
00:44:32.072 - 00:44:48.804, Speaker A: Not me opining by myself and talking about people's comments with no feedback. Right. Teen wolf two. So again, has drubble waffle. He put out a few. So again, you see the sheer experimentation here. A purple sky with, again, this beautiful, beautiful, beautiful texture.
00:44:48.804 - 00:45:11.024, Speaker A: And look at the ground. So, like we see with azo, there's just a richness to this image. You can always find something new here. So very beautiful work available for 33 33. That's pretty reasonable, if you ask me, for an addition of five. And Lamont Young, I believe he was a composer. Kind of a famous modernist name here.
00:45:11.024 - 00:45:41.324, Speaker A: I believe he was a composer. Finds the aquifer. I'm not sure if he was a philosopher or a composer. Avant garde, you see, there's a reference there to the avant garde. Scary weekend, I think he was a composer. And so teen wolf, too, also has drubble waffle with kind of a dark couple of works here of a car accident and cats. And this person with blood on, again, you see this wonderful, wonderful texture here.
00:45:41.324 - 00:46:18.434, Speaker A: You know, like when Cosimo says, you know, that he likes the art on tez better than eeth. Like, this is one of those things because of the experimental nature of tezos, where you can take more risks, in a sense, and where. So all of a sudden, these risks, if something starts to click, which I'd argue we're starting to see. Here we are seeing with hasdrubal waffle doing maybe this is Mario paint, getting these awesome textures. This sort of sky is not a typical sky you'd see on Ethereum, let's put it that way. I dare say. Again, if you disagree, feel free to leave a comment.
00:46:18.434 - 00:46:55.932, Speaker A: I'm not wed to anything I say here, so anyways. But this is sort of what I think of when he says that, because you don't get this kind of work very often, because I think there's just more of a financialization, so there is a freedom in things being cheaper, at least cheaper to mint, and just having this kind of more open experimental platform, like he was saying, scary audition. So this seems to be, like, part of that piece. Maybe not. Again, cats in total pain. It's kind of awful, in a sense. I'm a big cat lover here, but that is not the point.
00:46:55.932 - 00:47:15.624, Speaker A: We're looking at some art here and just some strange imagery. And I love the book here. It's like, is this pixel art? I can, like, you know, this is done with a square brush, but not all of it, actually. So, to me, this is digital painting, whether it's moving or not. Okay. Edition of five. And it's all gone.
00:47:15.624 - 00:47:49.664, Speaker A: So, again, I consider this digital painting in my universe, and these things are just being hashed out here. I actually did a search on the genres and categories of digital art. There's a little bit, but there's nothing I would say too definitive. So it's still kind of being worked out here. Interestingly, as far as I can tell, it's not like I've read a ton of scholarship on this stuff. Another PFP type work, this is also by teenage wolf, hasdrubal waffle. And we recognize this texture in the background from that earlier gorgeous work with, like, the blue eyes that we saw.
00:47:49.664 - 00:48:16.594, Speaker A: So I'm not sure the reference exactly. Kind of looks like McDonald's just with reindeers. I don't know. But nice work here and available for seven. Now, be careful on this one, because some people, I was going to pick this up, and then all of a sudden I was like, okay, some people own ten. You could probably put an offer in for, like, 350 and get this work. So if you want this work, I'd put an offer in, as Lego Joe is doing.
00:48:16.594 - 00:48:34.732, Speaker A: This is still available. Human kernel. A one of one. Neverthink, always just say stuff. Human kernel. So, again, experimenting with the profile picture and different textures and everything. Again, this isn't, you know, this is not typical ETH work, to Cosimo's point.
00:48:34.732 - 00:48:55.758, Speaker A: Right. More experimentation. I love the hair. This hair is great. So let's be calm. Again, PFP as a template or portrait as a template, and then saying, okay, background element. I'm going to use this kind of pattern, the face, I'm going to use this kind of pattern, and then the hair, I'm going to do this kind of technique.
00:48:55.758 - 00:49:24.114, Speaker A: It's a pretty cool. It's a pretty cool process. Okay. And I'd say. And it's kind of like, as an artist, you kind of discover, like, this is one of my favorite techniques. It's a classic contrast, where you kind of put, you know, something very kind of soft and blurry, although this isn't that soft, but kind of, you know, spread out and everything. And then you put this very fine pixel brush here, and then you get this wonderful contrast, and the color is contrasted there, too.
00:49:24.114 - 00:49:39.398, Speaker A: Again, you get a contrast with the glasses here and the face. Ilay is going to kill me if I keep going too long here. So we got to continue. Cap'n gift shop. She's never complained by the way. But I. Yeah, so great series here.
00:49:39.398 - 00:50:06.030, Speaker A: Burger one of one, fries one of one, and coke. So get your full meal cap and cola here. These went for just ten tezos each. Pretty cool. Love to have that series on a wall, right? Mech TXT. So, teasing his audience a little bit with some new interesting work that looks almost abstract. And then he released these two, and look, I mean, addition of 20, buy for 46.
00:50:06.030 - 00:50:37.892, Speaker A: Now on secondary. Seems to be experimenting more with kind of just with composition. And here's another one, almost looks like a, you know, the thing in 2001, not an obelisk, but a big slate, that is. Anyways, foreign places, two by mech. Txt. Some more pixel art. Again, this low resolution to me, is starting to become an important part of the definition of pixel art is.
00:50:37.892 - 00:51:10.860, Speaker A: Again, that's what makes it kind of chunky, right? So. But then you say, well, what makes low resolution? I mean, maybe you can put a number on it. I'm not sure, but it seems to be a missing part of my definition of pixel art is, which I call digital art with a square brush. I think low resolution needs to be added somewhere in that definition. Feel free to leave a comment if you have ideas. I just want to. Very quickly here, as we wrap up, look at the market for Mec TXT.
00:51:10.860 - 00:51:28.980, Speaker A: Look at this offer of 100. I picked that up, like three weeks ago for 100. I felt like I was paying a lot, but I just had to have it in the collection. Now it's at 500 and there's people offering 100 and it's not being taken. It's not being taken. Look at these offers. Another offer for 100, their offer for 50.
00:51:28.980 - 00:51:51.872, Speaker A: Look at these prices. 169, offer of 45. This was released a couple of weeks ago, you know, so very nice. This is kind of the evidence you need. As he was saying. Collectors take note, as Cosimo was saying, like, things are heating up here, and before you know it, there's going to be a zero at the end of all these. You know, not financial advice.
00:51:51.872 - 00:52:10.318, Speaker A: Could all go down. Okay, Tom bombatl with the new work as well. And just quickly, madness here. So continuing with this kind of Sci-Fi comic book type thing. Spectrum collection. Nostalgic colors reminiscent of eight bit games. So very prolific as usual.
00:52:10.318 - 00:52:29.758, Speaker A: Nifty monkey is kind of like a semi cult pixel artist. On tezos here, just another kind of wild work. Sells out always very quickly. Now. Buy for 99 or buy for 100. On tezos, nifty monkey, Antonio loves with a new one edition of seven. Buy for 50.
00:52:29.758 - 00:52:44.678, Speaker A: And here it is. And this is part of the angels, saints and prophets. The archangel and the dragon. So here's the archangel, I guess, with the big wild wings here. Nice colors, too. And there is the two headed dragon. Very nice.
00:52:44.678 - 00:53:13.992, Speaker A: And another one from Orkan Isayev, another kind of retro Sci-Fi work. And you see a cathedral, but with flying cars. So that is pretty rad in a very futuristic city. Looks like a window into 500 years from now, maybe sooner, maybe 300 or 100 years from now, for all we know. Flora Marquez with a couple of nice, beautiful sketches here. Again, using that erased kind of background. And here is another beautiful one.
00:53:13.992 - 00:53:37.554, Speaker A: I think this was sent to collectors. I hid from technology for a while. So anyways, it's very beautiful and it's fun. You're starting to see this evolution, you know, playing with that erased and maybe brushed strokes or whatever. This is this great contrast here. And, you know, putting it out daily, you're just going to see an evolution. Here's someone who is very under the radar, Sebasa Starro.
00:53:37.554 - 00:53:57.954, Speaker A: And he has a few drawings. I don't think they've sold at all. There's nine and he is the only owner. So buy for three. Interesting artist, nice series here. It's tempting, very tempting to pick some up here. So just an interesting artist, interesting illustrations.
00:53:57.954 - 00:54:17.798, Speaker A: Someone, zero, zero. Someone, zero, two. Someone, zero, one. Nice series, isn't it? But buy it all for nine. Tezos rose with some sketches. I think he was saying he put like 20 minutes into each of these on Twitter. Anyways, he is selling them now in editions of 20.
00:54:17.798 - 00:54:36.686, Speaker A: And they're all selling. Let me just see. Okay, sorry, this hasn't sold at all. He hasn't put it for sale yet. I think it's a he. And so anyways, maybe same thing here. Okay, so just showing them and working fast can be.
00:54:36.686 - 00:54:58.402, Speaker A: You hear a couple of people have them. Working fast can be a really good thing to do, especially if you're taking too long as this show is. Especially if you're taking too long on your artwork. Working fast is a great thing to just like shake things up a bit. And so Rosaceo is working fast. And here is another one. Rainbow colored, fish shaped cloud.
00:54:58.402 - 00:55:18.470, Speaker A: I'm going to keep going here. A new one by Sky Goodman. AI collab kicks. So again, using several softwares here to get his impossible sneakers, this one's pretty cool. Kind of has a surrealist flavor and awesome color. True gold with little rainbow, high tops, pixel sorted. AI collab kicks continuing on.
00:55:18.470 - 00:55:45.060, Speaker A: Remember this work from a show or two ago. This is all raw AI. It was a single prompt because I was wondering, how did you get those black marks on top? Was that just put in Photoshop after? No, it was a single prompt. As we go into AI here, look at Son of Stag. So son of Stag has just sold this on Ethereum, on foundation for eleven. This one's quite beautiful. So there you go.
00:55:45.060 - 00:56:04.938, Speaker A: Son of stag is making moves. This beautiful flecks of paint here. And continuing on, Ilay with a few works here, prism sky. We won't go too fast through Ilay's work. So, Ilay, yeah, so some beautiful AI works that she put here. Prism sky eight. Prism sky seven.
00:56:04.938 - 00:56:21.454, Speaker A: And I think these are all sold out, actually. We'll take a look in a second. Let's just see. Yeah, they are all sold out. This one you can still get for two, violet light. I picked one of these up. And so just some cool AI work from Ilay.
00:56:21.454 - 00:56:54.980, Speaker A: Continuing with the Prism sky series. Here's Prism sky number five. And it kind of reminds me of, I don't know if you know the term sundogs, but in Saskatchewan, where I grew up, Saskatoon, often you'll see the sun in the middle, and then you'll get these kind of almost prisms on both sides of the sun, where there's almost a circle that goes around the sun. And they kind of look like they remind me of these. And here's another one, prism sky glitch. So, playing with glitch in this latest one, AI, prism sky. It's a pretty cool, very nice Ilay.
00:56:54.980 - 00:57:18.662, Speaker A: Shout out to Ilay. And here's a new one from Connectsapta, iridescent pileus scarf cloud. So just another AI work, I believe. Interesting colors along the same lines using Dali two. How are we doing here, 57? We gotta run, Mister Shapeless. Another work that looks great with these suggestive clouds that look like a landscape. Now, very cool.
00:57:18.662 - 00:57:46.398, Speaker A: And Nsfworld with a very nice one, the morning star. Raw AI prompt using Dali two. Pretty nice. If you ask me, it looks like a Lucifer type figure. The morning Star and Martin Joe with a work, you can kind of hear it here. Kind of a wild AI work with some ultra and three sliced in the background. So cool.
00:57:46.398 - 00:58:05.014, Speaker A: Works in works. You gotta love that, too. And Danielle King with a very interesting class. Helen Frankentaler, Enrique Lee Krasner. Fusion here in AI. So very interesting. And also, Danielle King working on this series of AI women, as she's calling it.
00:58:05.014 - 00:58:23.890, Speaker A: I guess it's fake people. And the ones that really struck me were the artificial Polaroids. And here's artificial Polaroid number one. You can sort of see the eyes are kind of a little too big. Super interesting. And artificial Polaroid number two. And finally, Shilley Preston with ATV stop AI.
00:58:23.890 - 00:58:44.714, Speaker A: And just a classic kind of trash work with AI. Taught her outside a defunct czech city in Ogden, Utah, and won by walk. A very nice physical work. The master of spray paint here again with a beautiful work here. And that, my friends, is your show. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
