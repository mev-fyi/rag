00:00:06.400 - 00:00:27.638, Speaker A: We are back. And what an incredible drama we have here in this scene. It makes the world news seem kind of lame, doesn't it? At least to me. I mean, I haven't even opened your Washington Post, New York Times, Ft. Wall Street Journal. I haven't even looked. Who cares? Unfortunately, we probably have to anyway.
00:00:27.638 - 00:01:01.860, Speaker A: We are back. Artist Journal, November 17, 2023, broadcasting from deep inside. Deep inside, it's sunny here. It's a little gray out in the physical world, but deep inside it's very sunny as we make our journey across the high seas of the imagination. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and it is Friday, and I am extremely grateful for that. So check this out. You know, Lorna Mills, we got a preview here of, I think, what's going to go up in Miami, if I'm not mistaken here, verse put it out.
00:01:01.860 - 00:01:55.564, Speaker A: There's no title, but it was really interesting because one of the things we learned from Lorna Mills on Wednesday, who is the artist of this work, the author of this work? One of the things we learned from Lorna Mills the other day was what we see on object. These, what I thought actually were her main works. I thought, you know, interestingly, those were kind of a, at the beginning for her. I don't want to call it a sideshow, but something that was designed for the blockchain, as far as I understand what she was saying, that, okay, I need to make. I want to make work safe for tazos. How do I do that? Maybe instead of having these huge collage like compositions, like the kind that we see here, maybe I'll do, I'll zoom in on just, you know, one of these elements. Right? I'll just pick this guy or just the hand.
00:01:55.564 - 00:02:46.874, Speaker A: But what we learned, everybody who was in the space, and I'll show you the link again in just a couple of minutes here. What we learned is, actually, for Lorna Mills, these kind of big collage works, at least in her mind when she was starting, were the main deal. That was kind of the main project. And interestingly, these kind of individual works, of individual gifts, took on a life of their own, interestingly. And she had an interesting comment where she was saying, you know, I never really, I think she used the word admit. I'm not sure if that's the right word, but she never accept, admitted to herself that the works on tezos and that, in a sense, that the blockchain had changed her work. I believe that was the question I had.
00:02:46.874 - 00:03:33.110, Speaker A: And she's like, but now I kind of have to say that with these kind of individual works. And I'm using this all as preamble to say this is one of the, you know, what we might call the grand compositions of Lorna Mills to set the table for us here. So, you know, what you are seeing here, and look at that raw chicken there. I mean, you know, it's something that's also. It's a very indirect thing, but the choice of subject matter is an art in itself, and oftentimes it kind of gets glossed over a little bit. It's easily kind of passed over, shall we say, for technical considerations, aesthetic considerations. But, you know, I've very much, again, Lorna Mills is our artist.
00:03:33.110 - 00:04:29.098, Speaker A: I very much relate to in many ways. It's always kind of been very kind of central for me, subject matter, and almost the preeminence of subject matter. What are you talking about? First of all, you know, a question we can all ask ourselves, can't we? What are we talking about? What is the subject of our work? You know, and sometimes it can be formal concerns. Sometimes it is, you know, like Clement Greenberg and the abstract expressionists about the paint on the surface, you know, and other times it's about the representation. And, you know, with Lorna Mills, I'd say it's both we have, you know, you know, we have these, for example, like chicken, you know, what we might call, and I think August ground, who was in the space, was calling it the detritus of the Internet here. Beautifully put. And as we see, you know, the hilarity, the ridiculousness of the Internet.
00:04:29.098 - 00:05:34.980, Speaker A: And I think I asked Lorna, like, in a sense, are these, you know, collage compositions, these kind of grand compositions, so to speak, are they, in a sense, a kind of response or reflection of the Internet? And in a sense, you know, I never framed. I never posed the question to her this way, but are these, in a sense, a portrait of us? To a certain degree, we're back to yesterday's episode, a portrait of us, portrait of us all. You know, another portrait of us all. And to a certain degree, I would argue that's probably what this is. And she actually kind of agreed with what I was saying. Again, correct me if I'm wrong, anybody that listened to the space, if you understood differently. But in a sense, this is a reflection of Internet culture, so to speak, which at the end of the day, humans, human nature, humans put all this stuff up, and so it becomes this, you know, this kind of, you know, what we might consider trivial content, like the chicken.
00:05:34.980 - 00:06:18.112, Speaker A: And, like, you know, odd sort of stuff and like, what? You know, a skeleton dancing on potato with eyes or something. Right. Or whatever this baby with the steam coming out is, you know, they're more ridiculous, the better, to a certain degree, with a little touch of nature, actually. I love Lorna Mill's nature works, but I love, you know, having that, you know, I don't want to go too long here, but having that discussion, it really helped me understand Lorna Mill's work on a much deeper level. And kind of her, you know, again, these kind of originally being these kind of large collage compositions being kind of the main show, so to speak. So we have a new one here, and this is posted by someone at. Someone at verse.
00:06:18.112 - 00:06:52.084, Speaker A: Layla. The brilliant, bizarre, and genius world of Lorda Mills brings me joy repeatedly. And what I was gonna say, actually, I'm glad she brought up the word genius, is the content can look trivial to a certain degree, you know, again, these kind of lo fi, you know, from a content perspective. Okay, chicken. It's a pigeon. But when you put it all together, this is actually quite a sophisticated endeavor that Lorna Mills journey, that Lorna Mills is embarked on here. A portrait, a genuine portrait.
00:06:52.084 - 00:07:22.388, Speaker A: And just a final point on this, actually, that I want to bring up. She uses a lot of sampled gifts, but sometimes she makes her own, which I was actually surprised by. So that was interesting, too, I suspect, and I'm not positive. I suspect these are probably all sampled, but not positive on that. They kind of. Unless she has a dog with a curtain, it wouldn't shock me, actually. So this will be released on verseworks, who actually has a very nice website.
00:07:22.388 - 00:07:47.414, Speaker A: Remember the Quampa show? I'm pretty sure that was on verseworks. They've been doing a really nice job. December 1 at 06:00 p.m. This work will be available on verseworks. So super cool there. And also from Layla at verse. So we're also discussing transfer and who transfer is, because I wasn't really familiar with it, and apparently it's a pretty big deal, at least in the digital art space.
00:07:47.414 - 00:08:15.360, Speaker A: And here we have a quick and look at this. And I can't tell, to me, this doesn't look like a screen. It looks like a canvas. This looks like a static version of a Lorna Mills. And I'm not positive on that because she was saying, you know, with screens, she's always like, the bigger the better. So maybe it's a screen, but this looks like actually a static kind of collage on canvas. That is what that looks like to me.
00:08:15.360 - 00:08:44.158, Speaker A: If anybody else knows otherwise, do correct. Oh, me? No, this is a screen. Look, you can see the light. I assume that's a, you know, you can see the light coming from the pink here. But, you know, and I'm not exactly sure if Lorna has done a collage that is static, but to me, this works actually as a static work. Interestingly. Interestingly so.
00:08:44.158 - 00:09:14.312, Speaker A: But looking at that light reflecting off the pink here and maybe even the hand a little bit here onto the floor, and even here, it's a little brighter than it should be. Than if that was static. If that was static and like paper on canvas or something like to that effect, I don't think we'd get such a strong reflection there. So maybe it's a screen. Let's see what Layla has to say here. Transfer. So this was basically the people who helped establish Lorna Mills was established in 2013.
00:09:14.312 - 00:09:58.954, Speaker A: At that point, Lorna was already, I guess they helped after she had, was already established in the digital art scene and one of the first artists they represented. Let me make that bigger here. The gallery was organized close to 100 solo exhibitions by different artists. Artists experimenting with new models of presenting digital and time based media art in a gallery setting. Time based media art, I guess another way of describing a gif, a transfer, but also probably includes video. So time based media art, interesting, probably moving is also, you know, a characteristic of that. A transfer has played an integral role in showcasing Lorna's historical pieces and placing her works in prestigious institutions like the Whitney Museum of American Art.
00:09:58.954 - 00:10:18.726, Speaker A: We are so pleased to collaborate with transfer to show Lorna's incredible work here at our event. Please RSVP image below. Petit zoo epic, epic, biblical at spring break La. 16 panel led wall courtesy of transfer. So interesting. 16 panel led walls. So probably each one.
00:10:18.726 - 00:10:45.250, Speaker A: There's probably, you know, maybe four. I'm not exactly sure how this is divided up, to be perfectly frank. Maybe it's four by four, I have no idea. But it looks like one ginormous tv, doesn't it? So probably 16 tvs put together. So anyway, very cool. Interesting info from Layla. And this was the show, finally, if you haven't seen it or listened, it is in the Twitter feed.
00:10:45.250 - 00:11:09.710, Speaker A: You might have to dig a little bit, but not too much. And really great show. Three R 88. That's a pretty good turnout there. And it was, more importantly, it was just a really interesting show. Chertofsky Adrian, thank you for the portrait here. Chertofsky or kind of in the style of the collection that Chertoffsky is going to release here and pretty cool.
00:11:09.710 - 00:11:27.774, Speaker A: Actually coming out of a little window here, I'd argue captures the likeness pretty good. It reminds me of the drawings by Bea. Maybe I have more bags under my eyes than I realize. I don't mind that at all. By the way. I think it's great. However I'm perceived, I'm cool.
00:11:27.774 - 00:11:41.690, Speaker A: Interesting. I love the arrow too. The cursor here and pointing at the art and almost stabbing the art a little bit. Cool work. Nice. Big. I love how it breathes too, actually, one of one.
00:11:41.690 - 00:11:58.234, Speaker A: Thank you for sending that to me as well. And I assume this is going to be on object because it was sent to me on object part of the socity series here. I'm not sure if it's been minted yet. I don't think it has. Or maybe I saw something. There's four owners there, but this looks like what it is. Just shout out to Chertofsky.
00:11:58.234 - 00:12:14.334, Speaker A: Socity. The name is wordplay with society and some fun meaning in my native language. No generation this time. All the tokens are hand drawn. No repetitions, no common attributes. So check that out on Shutoffsky's feed there. Pretty cool.
00:12:14.334 - 00:12:54.766, Speaker A: And thank you again for the shout out and the drawing. Continuing on, we got some fabulous comments here on the last show and it was minted really late. I tell you one great thing about getting out of Berlin is the Internet speeds were about 50 times faster. I'm not sure if this is just where my last, like this apartment and the last apartment. I'm going to do an experiment actually today, but it's taking me like an over an hour to upload like 3gb, sometimes less. So that is. Yeah.
00:12:54.766 - 00:13:25.514, Speaker A: So all to say that's why it was so late yesterday on both Twitter and YouTube. By the way, maybe it's just a glitch in the Internet right now. Who knows? But Rome, it was like 30 seconds, you know, maybe a minute, two minutes. And same with London was extremely fast. So just kind of interesting. Let's look at the comments here. Bernardo Pesce GM Adrian Pomelo so it's Pommelo over here who did the turntable with the music and that kind of nice illustration.
00:13:25.514 - 00:13:42.724, Speaker A: Thank you for sharing. And yeah, the idea is creating a collection where the music is the protagonist of the piece. The animation is intended to be a secondary aspect of it all. In the future, my intention is to try to mix the vibe of the music with the animation and the text. Also. Love your show. I watch it every time I can.
00:13:42.724 - 00:14:03.760, Speaker A: Thank you so much Pomelo and the music's always awesome and the drawings are awesome. I love the concept. It's very fun. Every time I see one, I can't wait to put it up and it kind of gives the show a nice kind of musical break, too. Cool work and looking forward to seeing more. Violet Tripp GM Adrian, thanks for highlighting my work. Great show as always.
00:14:03.760 - 00:14:23.208, Speaker A: And you're welcome, Violet. That was a very cool work yesterday. Skomra. I think Sabato created a separate account, marginalia, for the marginalia works, so that totally explains it, which is why it is not showing up on his object page. Okay, so that explains it all. I tell you. Skamra, as you're going to see here, let's just read the comment.
00:14:23.208 - 00:14:53.232, Speaker A: The Jerry salt situation is interesting. I think a zombie formalism essay is a great takedown of the economics around an art movement. And of course, zombie formalism. I haven't read that essay, but maybe I'll try. I should take a look at that, because maybe it's also a way of getting to know Jerry Saltz a little bit better in terms of how he thinks. Because this seemed like the most manufactured art movement of all time. And you can tell by the name, right? I like his eye.
00:14:53.232 - 00:15:22.806, Speaker A: That was around if I had to put a year on it, maybe 2007, you know, maybe leading up to the whole financial crash there. I like his eye for how money and politics work in art and what I've read in what I've read of his work. It was also interesting to see Patrick Amadon come to Saltz's defense. I saw that. That was interesting with Patrick saying that Jerry's criticisms helped improve his art. That said, I agree with you that he could have made the screensaver comment in a more constructive way. It probably wouldn't.
00:15:22.806 - 00:15:51.128, Speaker A: To lead as many clicks, though. This sort of WrestleMania approach to culture, I think is fine at the top and in the mainstream. My guess is that Saltz's criticisms only increase the value of Annadol's work. It is probably win win for both of them. I would hate to see Saltz like tactics on the pirate ship, though. Great show and thanks so much for showing my work. So I was thinking to myself, like, if there was an op ed section, like, Skomra would probably be at the top of the list as far as, like, who's gonna.
00:15:51.128 - 00:16:34.470, Speaker A: We need someone to edit the op ed side. Like, these are really refined comments here from my perspective, and I think you nailed it, actually, because there is a difference between, at the very top of the totem pole, shall we say, that this WrestleMania approach to culture is fine at the top? And I kind of hear, like, I agree with you. Like, I put it this way. I don't think it excuses poor behavior at any level. Right. But to a certain degree, I kind of. I'm quite sympathetic because we don't want to be snowflakes here either.
00:16:34.470 - 00:16:52.104, Speaker A: We don't want to be like, oh, don't say anything negative. What do they call it? Toxic positivity. Like, we don't want to be like, oh, you can't say anything bad. You know, we want to have tough skins here. And by default, as an artist, you have to have a tough skin. Right. A thick skin, as they say.
00:16:52.104 - 00:17:21.824, Speaker A: So I think this is a really, actually interesting and accurate, like, I agree with you. I agree with you. Like, at the top, it's fine. That being said, I would qualify that by saying it doesn't. One also has to look at the role model aspect of what Jerry Saltz is doing, and then, okay, who's the next person who's gonna try and be the next Jerry Saltz? And then there. I still think it was in. I still think it was bad form, you know, as you're kind of, you know, kind of saying as well here.
00:17:21.824 - 00:17:59.920, Speaker A: Um, so interestingly, as we're going to see, Saltz actually deleted the tweet. So I think that actually adds to our argument. Maybe Saltz himself was starting to think, well, maybe this doesn't reflect very well upon me, and therefore I will delete it. I don't know why it would be deleted otherwise. Okay, so maybe Saltz would even agree with us in his heart of hearts, although he might not declare so publicly. So. And I agree, the saltz, like, tack WrestleMania on this stage, I don't think there'd be as many people watching.
00:17:59.920 - 00:18:33.482, Speaker A: I think half the world would hate me if I started talking like this about, like, you know, someone that's selling, like, five editions on Tezos for $2, right? It'd be outrageous. So I kind of agree it does. Context matters in this. And putting it at the very top of the totem, you know, at the top of the, you know, pecking order, whatever you want to call it, maybe that's okay. And maybe we should have thick skins about it. If you're going to show it, moma, travel the world, and then all of a sudden, you're the AI artist. Well, you better.
00:18:33.482 - 00:18:50.794, Speaker A: You know, if the one of the main critics is, like, attacking you, you should be able to punch back and defend yourself. Let's put it that way. So fantastic comment as usual. Skarmour. Thank you. Kyle Flemmer. Excellent choice for the COVID referring to Sabato's brilliant work of art there.
00:18:50.794 - 00:19:26.924, Speaker A: And Rosaceo, Jerry Saltz did it again. Yeah. I don't know what is up with him. Feels like he did it just for engagement farming, but I don't know. I agree with you. We don't have to lever every piece of art in the world, but there's no need to attack the art or the artists like that. And it does also come back to what is the example that Jerry Saltz is setting for even people who are in art school? Maybe there's even art professors that think, oh, well, actually, I can trash artists work, and then they go to smaller artists or people who have no or completely nowhere on the map and then start trashing them.
00:19:26.924 - 00:19:57.950, Speaker A: Right. So I don't like the example it sets. I think it's kind of a slight loss of dignity to a certain degree. And again, I'm kind of back to this bad form idea. That being said, at the very top, I don't know if it disqualifies him. I'm not sure it's a disqualifier, is how I'd kind of couch that, because I think ultimately Skommer is it's a pretty. Maybe it's okay at the top, but it doesn't make, it doesn't excuse poor behavior, though.
00:19:57.950 - 00:20:14.514, Speaker A: So continuing on, Sabato. We heard from Sabato. Hey, Poco. Honored to be on the COVID And big thank you. This is on Twitter here, let me just pause that. Honored to be on the COVID And big thank you for the kind words about the piece. You are spot on about the lack of color cycles.
00:20:14.514 - 00:20:39.034, Speaker A: I felt it would distract from the gravity of the situation and wanted to channel a bit of adorno, which we have touched on here. To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbarism. Also, the drink is a modelo especial beer, which is a personal fave. So pretty hilarious. It is not a monster drink. I thought that was a little, what would we say? Just like unusual that there'd be a monster drink here. But I didn't know what else it could be.
00:20:39.034 - 00:21:22.344, Speaker A: So very interesting. And you know what else I find interesting here is Sabato has this not very literal interpretation of Adorno, but taking the spirit of what Adorno was saying and applying it. And because what I would call the charity of interpretation, because even Adorno, I think we're seeing on chat GPT eventually kind of took back some of what he was saying in regard to this statement. But I think Sabato kind of puts it. It's kind of exactly like we were saying to start making these pretty little gradients kind of flowing across. There's something kind of barbaric about that, we might say. I mean, barbarics may be a strong word.
00:21:22.344 - 00:21:54.760, Speaker A: And I think, again, why? So he kind of, I feel understood. I put it this way. I like how he's interpreting Adorno because this work is, of course, you know, writing poetry, but it's not stopping him from making the work. But it is. He's kind of taking that in stride and, you know, in his consideration, which, you know, what I would say would trivialize the. The gravity of the content, as he put here, the gravity of the situation. Thank you, Sabato, and fascinating as ever.
00:21:54.760 - 00:22:16.002, Speaker A: And let me just check out the other comments here. Thank you, Lucas Lejeune. Jan Lukas Migon. Really nice comment. Love your vision of the arts. Really interesting or really nice thing to hear. And it's kind of interesting, like, I don't know how different it is in a weird way, you know? And this kind of hearkens to a future tab here.
00:22:16.002 - 00:22:51.020, Speaker A: Like, I've been an outsider all my life, I have to say. You know, and so I have actually kind of had to create to a certain degree, at least from an art perspective, I have had to create my own kind of narrative, and maybe that's part of the impetus of this show on a certain level. I'm not sure, but I totally appreciate that, and I'm glad you enjoy that. One of this caught my eye too, in a big way earlier this week, referring to the Sabato work. Sg, amazing as always. We're gonna see some SG. I really amazing work that I'd never seen before.
00:22:51.020 - 00:23:19.096, Speaker A: I don't think cider appreciate the feature. The pieces of Ronaldo phenomeno, known better as r nine, a great footballer who even won two World cups. Of course. Of course. I kind of looked like the Hulk a little bit, but yeah, it's Ronaldo. So it's a manipulation of one of his iconic photos with the highlight of his weird haircut used to hide his injury from the media, making the main focus on his hair. And I remember that, that haircut.
00:23:19.096 - 00:23:35.608, Speaker A: Of course, Ronaldo is a legend there. Sabato. I think Sabato is from Brazil, too, so of course. Thank you, Sider. Martin Jo, thank you for showing my work. Those chairs are the work of Marietta Bernal. Those spiked chairs, one of my favorite 3d artists.
00:23:35.608 - 00:23:54.722, Speaker A: I remember reading Justine and Juliet as a teenager. So a few years ago I bought philosophy in the bedroom, but found it insufferable. Interesting. I don't know if I. It's been quite a long time. I think I tried because it's got a great title, right. And I think I tried, but I may have found it insufferable as well.
00:23:54.722 - 00:24:34.044, Speaker A: I've read excerpts from Justine and Juliet, and so, yeah, very interesting and very interesting in the context of Martin Joe's work, the sad influence, the Marquis de sade influence. So kind of, we may be onto something with that kind of loose interpretation. There's Leo, recordar et vive. And this is interesting. A classic brazilian expression that roughly translates to. To remember is to live. So, yeah, because I think in Italian it's a similar word.
00:24:34.044 - 00:24:49.124, Speaker A: I'm learning Italian right now, which is memory. To remember is to live. Very interesting. Beautiful work from Sabato, Iris, and we're almost done here. I really enjoy your YouTube channel. I always watch it before I go to sleep to see new artists. I love your selections of artwork.
00:24:49.124 - 00:25:05.748, Speaker A: Thank you, Iris. Very great to hear, oboobie. Thank you. And Dan Kelly, this was also very interesting. To echo gwandanarian sentiment on software costs. Procreate dreams comes out in a few days. Oh, wow.
00:25:05.748 - 00:25:25.608, Speaker A: So there's a new procreate. Procreate dreams. What is that going to be? Only $20. Feels like they have opened doors to many artists on a budget the past few years. One still needs an iPad, which is a rough point of entry, but appreciate perpetual licenses. Welcome to the editorial page here as well. Dan Kelly.
00:25:25.608 - 00:25:38.764, Speaker A: Exactly. Like hitting all the notes here. Exactly. And let me just make sure. I'm not sure if I. I assume I'm already following Dan, but in case I'm not very good. Thank you, everybody.
00:25:38.764 - 00:25:54.356, Speaker A: You know, I've already liked these. You know, I feel like I just like that one. Twitter's a little, uh. Yeah, it's weird on the updates. Okay, so let's go a little bit deeper into this controversy here, as we have the 25 minutes mark. I'm. I don't.
00:25:54.356 - 00:26:38.914, Speaker A: Robnis, the more horrific comp, the more refik complains, the more I'm kind of siding with good, good old Jerry Saltz on the critique. If you can't handle criticism from the outside world, what kind of art are you actually making? Or rather, how daring is it? Screensavers were made not to challenge, but to placate the senses. Perhaps he was right. And this is interesting because the screensavers themselves became a big part of the debate. Like, what's wrong with screensavers? And I kind of agree with Robnis on this one that the screensaver. Yeah, like a lot of, I think, generative and saying how this was kind of in the tradition of generative art. And, you know, it's interesting, I guess I would say.
00:26:38.914 - 00:27:05.124, Speaker A: Yeah, I thought it was weird that people kind of jumped on as saying screensavers are wonderful art. What's the problem? So interesting comment from Robnis. And we'll see. We have several comments here today. Refik. So this was referring to and retweeting this refik Annadol statement. When an art critique has no idea about the culture, context and discourse of his words, digital art, community shares all kind of perspectives.
00:27:05.124 - 00:27:41.878, Speaker A: You like the art or not, culture is something bigger than one work of art, and that's where the community is. So almost avoiding a little bit, almost avoiding a little bit the subject, one could argue, I mean, except maybe at the start here, but so interesting. And of course, beeple weighing in. And I guess this is Rafiq Anadal. And there is Jerry Saltz. So this got like 168,000 views, of course, people, one of the most famous people in the NFT scene here, Rafiq Anadalt. So this was the.
00:27:41.878 - 00:28:12.512, Speaker A: I just want to give more context here. So we have a good idea of kind of the original tweet. Rafiq Anadal arrived in Milan to give a masterclass at photo vogue. Our metamorphosis AI data sculpture was one of the first examples of using real time generative AI with image sound and sent sound and sent in the form of public art. We'll be sharing our studio journey today. And here's the volume here a little bit. So here is the work.
00:28:12.512 - 00:28:44.634, Speaker A: So just for context here. And in case you didn't, in case you're not familiar with Rafiq Anadal's work or what's being discussed here, because I don't think we looked at that. And also Rafiq replied to Jerry, here's the deleted tweet from Jerry Saltz here. Chat GPT rates better than you, Jerry. Time to grow, time to find new vocabulary. So kind of clapping back there from Rafiq to Jerry Saltz. And continue.
00:28:44.634 - 00:29:14.458, Speaker A: And here's. Let's look at this means anyone like, okay. And then Rafik answered his own tweet means anyone like Jerry, guessing without knowing, needs to research, understand the medium. He doesn't even understand that he is seeing some complete generative art system that is creating audio and image and scent cohesively yeah. I think Jerry Saltz is a fair comment and Jerry Saltz does seem. But I think Jerry Saltz would say I'm focusing on the visual. Thank you.
00:29:14.458 - 00:29:32.410, Speaker A: Interestingly, and this was an interesting comment too, from El Barba Roja. Maybe he did research and just doesn't like it. I don't know what the big deal is. Not everyone has to like all art. He mentioning your art to me is a win. Shows this medium is here to stay. I don't think we need Jerry Saltz, though.
00:29:32.410 - 00:30:03.030, Speaker A: To me it's, yeah, I don't think we need an, you know, frankly, an art critic to tell if, you know, a medium is legit. It's our artists making work that are powerful with AI. And clearly, if you look at strange thing, I mean, this is the thing. I mean, what would I put in the front of the moma? I'd probably put some strange things. Okay. I mean, so, but, you know, that's just everybody's got, it's subjective, right? To a certain degree. I don't see anything wrong with critique.
00:30:03.030 - 00:30:31.404, Speaker A: To me, it's a celebration of your work. And again, it kind of echoes the Warhol. I think it's in the philosophy of Andy Warhol or from a to b and back, which is, it's not what they say about you, it's how many inches they write about you in articles, you know, on paper. Right. How many, how long is the article about you? There's no, or, you know, classic kind of New York PR motto. There's no such thing as bad publicity. You know, what's publicity? It's free advertising.
00:30:31.404 - 00:31:00.270, Speaker A: It's advertising that you don't pay for. That's what publicity is. And that's what Rafika Anadal is getting despoot critics are. I actually totally relate to this. And again, some people might think that I've been called an art critic many times on this, you know, just in comments like, oh, great art criticism. And I don't see myself as a critic or curator, even though there's a lot of what I do that overlaps with it. I'm an artist that talks about art and just gives my commentary here.
00:31:00.270 - 00:31:26.128, Speaker A: This is an artist's journal, by the way. And so I'm quite sympathetic with what despud is saying here. Critics are irrelevant when it comes to art. Remember, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. And also truly remember, Vincent van Gogh was bashed by many art critics his entire life. And this is true of so many artists. And sometimes other artists will bash art you know, so, you know, it's.
00:31:26.128 - 00:31:59.724, Speaker A: What I like about art is you don't have to rely on anybody. You know, we were discussing that in the space with Lorna Mills. It's, you can do your thing and nobody has to like it, and you can keep going and kind of, you know, I'm sure some of Van Co's circle were pretty impressed, but, you know, it didn't stop him. And that's the beautiful thing about art. Here's another one. Brian Brinkman. Not sure why people are continuing to debate if an artist who's in the MoMA permanent collection created the recent backdrop for the Grammys, is the first artist for the Vegas sphere, and has sold his art for millions, is good enough.
00:31:59.724 - 00:32:33.810, Speaker A: And, you know, Vegas Sphere, like, I don't know if that really. Even the moma, to me, increasingly, I don't. It's not like I go and check what the moMa is doing on their website, because I have to know. I don't. Even if I'm in New York, you know, I'm, you know, in the Grammys, that doesn't. In my opinion, this doesn't mean anything, actually. Like, maybe it's something, but there's all sorts of people, you know, who, you know, the Vegas sphere, you know, I guess this is.
00:32:33.810 - 00:33:17.440, Speaker A: Means something, clearly, but these institutions, it's sort of like Sotheby's, you know, it's. How exclusive is Sotheby's is if half the artists in the show, or, you know, I'm exaggerating, or 5% of the artists in the show have actually showed at Sotheby's. These institutions, I think, in the age of the Internet, are slowly eroding like water on rocks, and they're just slowly eroding. And I think new institutions will actually ultimately be built. Yeah, I'm kind of tired, frankly, of what I see in the institutions. Maybe it's part of the impetus of the show to a certain degree. So I'm not sure any of this means.
00:33:17.440 - 00:33:39.364, Speaker A: It doesn't mean anything to me, to be perfectly honest. Those things, whether a work is good or not, it means something. I'm not gonna say moma means nothing, but it means something for sure. But, you know, I don't love necessarily any. Everything that's in the MoMA collection, and I don't have to. Anyways, let's keep going here. Nicholas Sassoon.
00:33:39.364 - 00:34:18.050, Speaker A: So the defense of screensavers, and this is actually, I have to admit, this is quite a beautiful one here. I've never seen this one screensavers are one of those rare times when we take a step back from our displays. They become idle, light based objects within our home. It's an important moment where we look at screens as displays for aesthetic experiences within a larger context. So what I like about this comment here is they're all kind of like, they're not going. Like each is just a little leap and you go, okay, it's pretty tight logic here, actually. And Nicholas Sassoon is not trying to say too much here.
00:34:18.050 - 00:34:38.700, Speaker A: He's not saying we're going to have the most incredible aesthetic experiences of our life, but they are a source of aesthetic experiences. So nicely understated here in the newspaper. The imagination here from Nicholas Sassoon. A nice visual because it shows. That's pretty nice. Peter Pasma. Screensavers didn't just exist to prevent monitor burn in.
00:34:38.700 - 00:35:23.742, Speaker A: Otherwise we'd just have the black screen one or a moving logo. It was one of the first opportunities for creative coders to express themselves to a large audience using a new art form. They didn't have to make them as mesmerizing as they are. The entire concept of computer art was still quite new, and some very lucky creative coders saw an opportunity to express themselves with screensavers and popular operating systems. Of course, there was computer art before screensavers, but you also can't deny a whole generation of generative artists have been fascinated and inspired by screensavers dreaming how cool it would be if that was their program. So I have to say the whole kind of defense of screensavers came as somewhat of a surprise to me. Maybe it's because I have a bit of a gap when it comes to generative art.
00:35:23.742 - 00:36:02.448, Speaker A: Like, it doesn't grab me in the same way. But I think for all those, and that's not to say there's anything wrong with it, because I think there's a lot of people that were very, you know, qualified and smart and intelligent who love it, and that's great. Everybody doesn't have to love the same art. But I was surprised at the defense of. And so all to say, I think maybe just speculating here, the overlap between people who are describing or defending, you might say, the screensaver as art form are oftentimes, it seemed to me, feel free to disagree. A lot of the people who like generative art. So that is interesting.
00:36:02.448 - 00:36:28.070, Speaker A: Maybe it comes with a different kind of perspective. Okay, so interesting comments from Peter Pasma. And finally here Grace be Jerry salts are physical art pieces, then wall savers. As long as you're experienced when an art piece, the artist's language moves you and enriches your life times more than a day or two. Their craft is art. In any event, the beholder decides what's art, not me, nor you. So I thought this is where the argument started to get more desperate, though.
00:36:28.070 - 00:37:21.686, Speaker A: But interesting comment here from Grace B. Now, this is, I will say this screensaver here, and I wish we had the animated version is probably my favorite. Like, that did impress the hell out of me when I was, I don't know, 15 years old art gnome. Probably surprising to nobody that I love screensavers, Windows 3D pipes with the one of the, with the one 1000th appearance of Martin Newell's Utah teapot as an Easter egg might be my fave. So this is a great, it's a pretty cool work. And if you saw someone, you know, if you'd never seen this, you know, pipes before, and then you saw someone put on object, you'd probably be pretty impressed, right? So interesting, fair comment here. Finally, limbo, the visual I made through a visual synth will be implemented as a loop animation featured inside of a screen in my new piece.
00:37:21.686 - 00:37:48.784, Speaker A: So limbo is, you know, it kind of almost looks like a screensaver. Limbo putting on the screen and putting it on the screen of a computer in a new piece. So anyways, big shout out to limbo. Looking forward to seeing that. And finally, finally, sky Goodman. I feel like we should all make some dope screensavers and curate an object drop. And then what was funny is Kika Nikola is the curator there, and what do you think? Yes, let's.
00:37:48.784 - 00:38:09.564, Speaker A: So, pretty hilarious. Keep lean. Wait, what? So the new object, one drop, big article in Spanish here. I'm not sure which newspaper this is or magazine, but that's pretty cool. Spanish newspaper. I wonder which one. Pretty interesting there.
00:38:09.564 - 00:38:40.074, Speaker A: Now, on the curating front, this, because there's the Miami Beach Tezos. I I think this is where this is coming from, and I'm not positive, but I've seen a bit of kind of pushback on the Tezos Miami beach thing. So I think this is where this is coming from, but I'm not positive. Maybe it's talking about, like, for all I know, it's talking about this show. Let me show you the comment here. Michael Hughes. Hey, let's just curate the same people over and over and over and over and over again.
00:38:40.074 - 00:39:30.494, Speaker A: So, you know, this is an interesting, I just think it's an interesting comment. There's not much you can, you know, put it this way. I think in our situation, I'm actually quite optimistic on like the Internet, web3, even things happening on Twitter. Honestly, I'm seeing it the most open it's been in my entire life. I think Retro Manny might agree with that, who was kind of making a similar comment. Like, it's never been so open without the Internet and the whole Twitter thing and the NFT thing, kind of the Twitter community or the X community. I, you know, I was just sailing on my own on a little skiff, you know, and a little, you know, just in the high seas, like there's no.
00:39:30.494 - 00:40:07.094, Speaker A: So, you know, I started making sales. So I'm not as pessimistic on this whole. I think new people are being discovered all the time and I think there's an appetite for it. Interestingly, Curio fringe and I think we might have a work by Michael, actually we do in this show also. So Curio also commenting on this. Even the few that bring in new talents still have a clique that they, a click that they routinely boost with extreme bias. So again, not exactly sure who, there's no specifics here, folks.
00:40:07.094 - 00:40:36.562, Speaker A: Just think for yourself and don't give any critics or curators more authority than you would any other schmuck on the side of the road. So I do agree with this. Think for yourself and you have to, you have to. So just kind of interesting from Curio fringe. Now here are, I brought up a couple examples, though, of people that are kind of making inroads, you know. Luciana Guerra GM having amazing news. My art was selected in one of the most important art saloons, salons in my country.
00:40:36.562 - 00:40:55.074, Speaker A: Manuel Belgrano. It's important because it's the first time in 67 years that digital art is selected within a painting category. Digital painting is considered as painting. So proud. So great work by Luciana Guerra. Look at this huge work here. Big congratulations again, a digital painting, as we like to call them here.
00:40:55.074 - 00:41:26.002, Speaker A: So I see inroads and here's rinnefish. I'm so excited. And again, rinifish is going to be in Beeple Studio. And I don't get the sense that, you know, Luciana Guerra or Rinifish are insiders. So I'm actually not as pessimistic on the whole curation of the always the same people. And just a final note on that. I mean, on a personal level, if you really have strong conviction in your art, you kind of think, well, that'll reflect badly on them in the long term.
00:41:26.002 - 00:41:53.804, Speaker A: If nobody's curating or if, let's say, you know, so I don't let it. I'm kind of way past thinking that any, you know, I just, I don't think about it, really. Like when I see it, I just go, oh, that's interesting. I'm never like, oh, why aren't I in there? I never like. I don't think like, and maybe it's just a function because I never have been, perhaps. Anyways, I'm going too deep here. Let's look at Rinnefish.
00:41:53.804 - 00:42:19.872, Speaker A: I'm so excited to showcase my new art in Lume studios, New York City on November 21. This piece, illusion, will be live on foundation. At the same time, illusional bugs with illusional music. Thanks for organizing OMBD art, great people and the ghost club. And again, I see all sorts of people I haven't heard before and kind of, you know, not huge like paper Buddha's pretty big on object, but I'm not sure if paper Buddha is showing everywhere. So I see. And it.
00:42:19.872 - 00:42:31.568, Speaker A: You can always put on a show yourself, right? Look at this apple Iie. You know, that brings me back. Shout out to mom. Shout out to mom. Look at this. Broderbunds. Broderbund.
00:42:31.568 - 00:42:53.384, Speaker A: I wonder if that was german, maybe swedish or Norwegian. Sorry, Norwegian with the o there. Dazzle draw. I've never even heard of this on an Apple Iie. Broader boond software 1984 file tools edit Goodies. So it's a color Apple II, I might add. Look at how beautiful this looks.
00:42:53.384 - 00:43:20.520, Speaker A: And this really just hearkens back to our earlier discussion on if you hit a wall creatively, try a new software. Try an old software. And it's sort of like, try a different medium if you're working physically, you know, try some collage, add some medium to your paint, try a new medium. And, oh, here's more. And look at this. Like so here. And I mean, again, shout out to mom, who brought home the Apple iie.
00:43:20.520 - 00:43:48.938, Speaker A: This computer right here to our home when I was like four or five years old. That was a game changer. And so how cool is this? I guess there's ways you can transfer this over and into a computer and then have it on a big fan fancy screen like this. So how cool is that about dazzle draw? Yeah. 1984 by David Snyder. That is just so cool. It brings back waves of nostalgia here.
00:43:48.938 - 00:44:00.150, Speaker A: Spiegels Maskinen. Just another example. Look at that great signature there. Another example. Cool black and white artwork here. Let's see what it says. The bureaucrat print edition, one of ten sold to amazingux scene.
00:44:00.150 - 00:44:27.794, Speaker A: Is this a new thank you so maybe bought another one. Thank you so much. This will be shipped and sent your way this week. Or maybe it's the first one euxine bought and is going to be shipped. I'm not sure, but I think I saw, we saw a week ago or so that Ukscene had bought another one or had bought one. Lorna Mills. And just on the Spuegel show here, the pixel platform along the lower horizontal edge is one of those strange decisions that makes this work so wonderful.
00:44:27.794 - 00:44:55.504, Speaker A: And again, one of the things I love about Lorna Mills is it's very real world, pragmatic, practical. This is an artist of the world. Because artists, I'd argue with experience, look at what could be seen as trivial. Well, that's what's so poetic about that. But I completely agree with her. This beautiful thing at the bottom, that's the nature of art. It's the rationality of art.
00:44:55.504 - 00:45:25.640, Speaker A: You know, this is why, you know, it's often important, you might say, to have an irrational component in your art. It can often be the poetic component, as Lorna Mills is kind of, you know, turning our attention to here. So I thought that was a great, very real world comment on, you know, what makes art work. And look at this. This is also. Is this verse? Verse works solve unsolved controls. Vessel designed numerous controls for interacting with his latest generative series.
00:45:25.640 - 00:45:45.176, Speaker A: See below. Now, again, maybe I just need to learn more about generative art, because this is super cool. And it actually looks. This is. Yeah, it actually looks like it's physical, as I'll show you in a second here. So this is how it moves interestingly. And let me show you this.
00:45:45.176 - 00:46:00.524, Speaker A: This is what kind of. This kind of looks physical, but I'm not actually sure. Upscale resolution to save high res output. So maybe it is all digital. Let's see. Maybe this is all digital, because you see this background here, I thought maybe this was textured paper. It's not.
00:46:00.524 - 00:46:25.872, Speaker A: This is like. So it just has the feeling of textured paper. So pretty interesting. But it gives the sense of print, doesn't it? So interesting series there on verseworks. And, of course, Rada, do you feel excitement when postman rings your door? What about opening mystery loot or gambling with weird one of ones from your faceless crypto artist? Imagine dat and more. The tickets are limited and get burned. Only seven remain.
00:46:25.872 - 00:46:38.760, Speaker A: Here's the link on object. I wonder what these are selling for. Let's look. Here is another one of those very small, kind of postcard sized work that works. That rata is sending out. Let's just look at what the secondary is doing. 190.
00:46:38.760 - 00:46:57.068, Speaker A: Not terrible. You know, the mint price was, I think, 130 and 150. So you can still get it for a reasonable price. There is one there on secondary still available. And finally, it's 46 minutes. My God, Jacob. Zora's distribution is more than Zora.
00:46:57.068 - 00:47:18.840, Speaker A: Currently, 30% of mints occur across other platforms, which are now earning ETH for the distribution. They bring more than 30% of mints across occur across other platforms. So you know how we've seen mint? Fun. That sounds like it's on zora. Daylight. Another one that I've never even heard of on spotlight. I don't think I've heard of that one either.
00:47:18.840 - 00:47:55.344, Speaker A: So Zora's helpful platforms become revenue generating. So, FYI, for your information, for all the artists that are minting on Zora, there are other opportunities out there to, you know, because maybe the smaller marketplaces, I mean, they do have over 30%, but maybe it's easier to get to the top of the page. There's just less competition. And look at Zora. This is from October referrals. Interestingly so. Actually, these secondary sites look like they're going up, is what I think is going on here.
00:47:55.344 - 00:48:09.744, Speaker A: Pretty cool. And finally, Dan Control seemingly gets a tattoo of this plastic chair here. What does it say? I like plastic chairs. Indeed. Hilarious. Very Dan control. I assume that's Dan control.
00:48:09.744 - 00:48:26.484, Speaker A: And this was sent to me by Josh Sobble. I way, way doing pixel art. And you don't see it. I don't think you see it here, but wait till you. I mean, is that. Oh, that is pixels. Those are kind of pixelated if you look up close.
00:48:26.484 - 00:48:48.916, Speaker A: I'm not sure on this one. This is. It's clear here. It's very clear here. I was looking on my phone, so it was slightly smaller, but this was clearly pixel art. And here you do see some, like, bitmap, kind of rasterization of sorts, wild imagery there. Hopefully, that doesn't kill this thing on object.
00:48:48.916 - 00:49:05.720, Speaker A: It wouldn't surprise me if it did. Anyway, it showed up on Instagram. So maybe the alGs, I call them the tyranny of the algorithms. Right, where you have to worry about just anything. Nudes, whatever. Anyway, into the work we go. RJ.
00:49:05.720 - 00:49:37.892, Speaker A: The creation using some AI made with mid journey. Dither courtesy. So I think dither courtesy of Oxdiid is, remember, for putting things on chain and pixel art. So 600 by 600 pixels. So here's the work. And there was an earlier version that was minted. Really nice solution here, I might add, from RJ, because if you look at this next work, this one was burned using mid journey dither and drawing tools.
00:49:37.892 - 00:50:12.988, Speaker A: And I think the other one is far more successful. And you see the challenge when you have kind of, you know, to me, I totally relate to what RJ is doing in terms of sometimes you have a nice kind of source image, but to transform it right is actually a challenge. And this is actually, you will see pixels here. But I think the other one that was kept is actually a much more successful, interestingly so nice move here by RJ. Very nice solution. Look at this. Martin Brook with another fantastic work here.
00:50:12.988 - 00:50:46.854, Speaker A: Window landscape November 17 reserve of 0.12 ETH. I don't think we looked at this one. And actually, Martin, where was that comment? Martin actually left a comment, maybe it was a tweet saying he does not use AI in the work. Because remember I was saying it almost looks like those textured works by, say, skomra and a couple of others where there's AI added to create the AI pixelation aipixel art. That is not happening with Martin Brook. So just so you know, really beautiful work here.
00:50:46.854 - 00:51:07.350, Speaker A: It looks like, I guess it's a window. Window landscape. Nice concept too. And I just say a really nice one, you know. .12. And here are some of the ones we also missed by Martin on Zora. And this almost looks physical, doesn't it? Remember, maybe a combination.
00:51:07.350 - 00:51:25.426, Speaker A: This almost looks like a collage. We don't have any information here. This almost looks like a physical work because we know Martin works. Remember the oil painting we saw? I think it was oil and. But here it's not clear if this is oil. That looks like a little trickier to do. Maybe that is digital.
00:51:25.426 - 00:51:41.534, Speaker A: So mixing mediums here in a very interesting and provocative way. Look at this. I don't know why the text is on top. Maybe that is. I guess you can make the letters really big on Zora if you want to. Interesting dragon here. It's called dragon pet.
00:51:41.534 - 00:52:04.114, Speaker A: And it looks like on a phone or something. Maybe if you zooming through the sky. Just interesting work here on Zora. And I think we saw this one, cactus business. So under eclipse, I'm pretty sure we saw that one. So here are the works on Zora from Martin. Bruce and walk has been putting out this series for a while now, or at least a week or two, I think.
00:52:04.114 - 00:52:37.634, Speaker A: And I think it's a September 11 series here because we see the time, 847. And I think it starts on the other page here at 846 and then, because you see Mona Lisa here, so 846 and then we have the time. It's like every minute and walk is taking a screenshot, perhaps, and giving it a treatment along that whole morning, that fateful morning there. And this looks almost like the stock exchange. Maybe it's news footage, newsreel, not sure. Pretty interesting. And all sold out.
00:52:37.634 - 00:53:03.630, Speaker A: You can often get these, like, at auction for ten tazos. They've been selling pretty cheap. So you can, you know, like maybe 1520. I mean, we can take a quick look here. What'd the last one go for? Five tazos. So, you know, you can probably get a cool walk. Just very cool series here from Wok and totally digital here, editions of one, you know, going for quite reasonable.
00:53:03.630 - 00:53:27.404, Speaker A: Let's speed up here. This is gone. How long is forever? So another interesting digital abstract work here. Static, not moving. Interesting kind of yellow background here would hang well with Santiago here. This is gone's how long is forever? Abstract glitch, artwork made mixing code and custom digital paint tool. Custom digital paint tool.
00:53:27.404 - 00:54:02.506, Speaker A: Interesting storm next week. Speaking of Santiago, who also makes his own digital paint tools. Custom digital paint tools. And again, coming back to these diagonal pixels here, or like tilted pixels, just brilliant and super cool and very effective and kind of really gives it an arty feel, you know, to kind of echo Lorna mills there on spoogles. Like the tilted pixels here, I find super effective. We've seen that before. And more tilt, like a heavier tilt right in here.
00:54:02.506 - 00:54:32.626, Speaker A: If you can see that they're almost like diamonds, but not nice piece. Dice behind dice game behind everything. So for Santiago fans, by the way, this one of one going for 20 tezos here. So some one of ones are going at very reasonable prices here. So those people that kind of are very vigilant on object, you can still pick up like great deals here. Here's another one. I think it went for like 33.
00:54:32.626 - 00:54:51.344, Speaker A: So it went to Trippie Collector. Shout out to trippie collector. Nice purchase there. A one of one Martin Joe also using made with Santiago's tool editor. And here's the, actually the link, awesomely, if you want to use it in photoshop. Bacteria rave. This is what a bacteria rave sounds like.
00:54:51.344 - 00:55:09.292, Speaker A: So here it is. And maybe some echoes of Ed Marolla's pixel art class. So very cool work from Martin Joe using Santiago's tool. Dylan, really nice abstract here. Digital drawing. Check this out. A one of one, very nice piece here.
00:55:09.292 - 00:55:27.942, Speaker A: Kind of paper ish texture here. This is a digital drawing. I mean, pretty nice. And you gotta love this too. One of one kind of importing, kind of importing physical tropes, we might say. But this is a digital drawing. So how interesting is that? One of one for only 15 tezos.
00:55:27.942 - 00:55:43.860, Speaker A: Nice piece. Nice piece from dylan. And here is Sg, who I think we saw in the comments there. Sunset over the village. Beautiful, beautiful head turning art here from SG. So this was just posted. I don't think it was.
00:55:43.860 - 00:56:04.052, Speaker A: There's no link to a, to a marketplace. So I'm not sure if this has been listed yet. Really nice piece here. And look at this. This is from June, June 28. Summer fields on foundation, also from SG. So we're always trying to keep it new here, you know.
00:56:04.052 - 00:56:22.668, Speaker A: And look at how subtle this gradient is. And oh, there's a little texture in it. And I even wonder if there's a little bit of movement here. I can't tell but it's tempting to think. Very interesting work here. Is this a gif? Let's see. View metadata PNG.
00:56:22.668 - 00:56:37.744, Speaker A: So it is not moving, I don't think. Yeah, it is a PNG. And here is some of SG's other work. Osirielguill ETH. So interesting artist here. Pretty reasonable prices. Very nice work.
00:56:37.744 - 00:57:11.204, Speaker A: Look at this. I think Sabato retweeted this melaya a moment before. So very edgy work here. And just really interesting drop shadows. What I would call very counterintuitive art here is almost, you know, how we were talking about indie digital art. I kind of want to group this in there, this nice little, what do you call that a candle holder or candle bra here is a doe or a small deer from behind. Very oddly, almost reminiscent of machine.
00:57:11.204 - 00:57:30.196, Speaker A: A little bit what I call gradient artists or these airbrush artists. Just very interesting, you know, here's a close up here. Just very interesting. So another new artist here. Zuoso. Out and in of the mirror. So let me get my mic turned here so you get the full effect.
00:57:30.196 - 00:57:57.128, Speaker A: Turn up the volume. The unique artwork of Zuozo. I mean it's, it's delightful. Absolutely delightful. You know, just fun. Original, crazy wild composition here. Out and in of the mirror, three tazos edition of 2011, left.
00:57:57.128 - 00:58:08.702, Speaker A: So selling nice work. So Seba Sestaro, memory number nine. So a new memory here. Edition of 25 for eight tezos. Nice work here. Cool legs here. Some more kind of surreal art here.
00:58:08.702 - 00:58:37.354, Speaker A: Kind of inner portrait of inner space to a certain degree of memory. An interesting subject. And yeah, I mean there's this window here, almost some Magritte like curtains here. Everything just cool, interesting colors, interesting animation, right? And this fuzzy, you know, that gives the sense of memory for sure. That fuzzy edge there. Memory number nine by Seba Sistero. Let's continue.
00:58:37.354 - 00:59:24.142, Speaker A: Ezra Eslin caught in a lie. I thought this was a brilliant work here. Very interesting work. Almost a semi transparent shirt here. The person caught in a lie and you kind of a deep psychological work here, you know, with the person looking in the mirror, kind of thinking twice and you wonder who like caught in a lie to themselves as they look in the mirror. And then the fire kind of ominously burning here. And interesting wanted signs, maybe with this person cheering to themselves, maybe a narcissist of sorts, right? Giving cheers to the mirror, who knows? Quite a brilliant, provocative, interesting work of art here from Ezra Eslin.
00:59:24.142 - 00:59:37.334, Speaker A: Cotton ally edition of 25 for 25. Tazo. Six left on primary. No, they're not going to mint another worthless gift. I saw this actually. It was unknown collector who was posting cool feeds. They're not going to mint another worthless gift.
00:59:37.334 - 00:59:57.818, Speaker A: They love me. So this is a course, I think, Jake Studios, I think is the name. We have just a ethereum address here. A pretty cool piece. Nice piece. And those kind of trademark, you know, pixelated, hand drawn, pixelated clouds and everything really in the three eyes. Surrealist illustrator.
00:59:57.818 - 01:00:18.394, Speaker A: Surreal illustrator. This is primitive re first date. Interesting piece here. Let's see if we can make it bigger here. It is so interesting digital painting here. And you see a little bit of dripping here and almost a basquiat feeling, but not quite. And just kind of cool work here.
01:00:18.394 - 01:00:33.462, Speaker A: Still its own thing here and is, you know, trampling over a car. These kind of big figures here. Almost like barbarian type figures with the weapon in the hand here. First date. The two. These two finally match. Digital art.
01:00:33.462 - 01:00:48.528, Speaker A: 7000 by 6000. Only 13 megabytes. Interesting. Half a sol. Interestingly, which is turning into real money. $30 edition of five l'inquisiteur peste et cholera. Cool title.
01:00:48.528 - 01:01:22.980, Speaker A: So pest, probably referring to disease and maybe cholera as well, I thought. L'encquasiteurs with some awesome juxtapositions here, of course, this looks like the old, you know, mask you'd find from the black death, I think in the. What are we talking about? 1347? Was it 1347 or 1247 to 1250? 112. 49. I should really know that Boccaccio was writing at the same time. That's the start of Boccaccio's Decameron. If you want a good.
01:01:22.980 - 01:01:52.044, Speaker A: There's a few good plague narratives. That's one of the more famous ones. The opening, the introduction, I guess you'd call it, of Boccaccio's Decameron. And also, if you want a really good one that's a little longer, the guy who wrote Robinson Daniel Defoe, journal of the plague year. Another great one. So anyways, these are medieval plague masks here, classically like. Interestingly, you can see how they're trying to get away from the breathing.
01:01:52.044 - 01:02:12.104, Speaker A: We're at 1 hour here. Okay, I'm going to speed up a little bit here. Anyway, great juxtaposition. This looks like maybe assyrian art in the background. They just shut down in Berlin. Is it the pergamon? For like 15 years or something until like 2035. And that's where you can see they also exist in the british museum.
01:02:12.104 - 01:02:40.512, Speaker A: You can see them there juxtaposed with like a power plant, a nuclear power plant, a nice rendition of the steam coming out of the nuclear power plant. And even over here, this is quite a brilliant work here. And even really nicely done. Looks like a sampled brush maybe to make the ground. And then you zoom out and you go, what's going on here? Very interesting work here. Life is not a choice. Kind of enigmatic.
01:02:40.512 - 01:03:12.884, Speaker A: Only two tezos, three left on primary rosatio, a banal screensaver. So I guess real time commentary here from Rosatio. The good, the bad and the very bad. And here we see the eyes kind of desaturated, interestingly, with a beautiful kind of purple, almost like an oil pastel of sorts, but digital. And a couple of skulls here. And almost like one of these monsters of sorts and everything here. So just another kind of surreal collage, digital artwork by rosatio.
01:03:12.884 - 01:03:30.354, Speaker A: This is pretty cool up here too. Adrive, prompt and everything cool. Putting the title in it too. Nice little semi colons. Vanella screensaver, edition of 20. Is this sold out or not listed? A couple of sold. This may be listed now, I think is what's going on.
01:03:30.354 - 01:03:55.112, Speaker A: And exactly so it has been listed just since I brought up that page. Dinner is ready. Gabby Walters, so I missed the last couple of. GAbby Walters this just came out. Dinner is ready. So referring to, was it Judith who, remember we were talking about the Bible and famous stories to know. And this seems to be a take on presenting the head of John the Baptist when he was beheaded.
01:03:55.112 - 01:04:15.712, Speaker A: I think it was, if I'm not mistaken, Judith. So here, seemingly referencing that with a bit of a terminator in the background here, so. Or underneath the skin. Nice touch. Dinner is ready. Edition of 15 for twelve tezos, two left on primary, just released. And this came out a last week, last Supper.
01:04:15.712 - 01:04:41.942, Speaker A: So another interesting work here. And again, kind of referencing what looks like John the Baptist here, a different kind of last supper here. So interesting subject matter here. Interesting kind of floating bubble as a head here on top of this figure here. And there's a crash test dummy and a Mickey mouse with the broken ear. Interesting work from Gabby Walter. And that's on secondary for 28.
01:04:41.942 - 01:04:59.432, Speaker A: That came out a week ago. Wasam and gold Minevich, the vanguard. Toast. Salud. And what's interesting, it almost looks like Molotov cocktails here or something. So here is the underground convening here and having a toast. Waste man, gold Minovitch.
01:04:59.432 - 01:05:14.282, Speaker A: Two left at two tazos. And the myth. I picked one of these up. It was just a low edition myth for five tezos. Life's good. This is from the 2021, but it is just released. So a cool kind of nice Microsoft paint.
01:05:14.282 - 01:05:38.570, Speaker A: Pixel artwork or artwork by the myth just released here. And here's Kappen dust. So again, some more kind of astronomical subject matter. Nice gif. And here is actually the person, Michi P. So Michael Hughes, who we saw with the. With the comments on the curation earlier here.
01:05:38.570 - 01:06:01.048, Speaker A: So pretty cool artist, I might add here. And I do understand if you're never included and everything, but I, you know, it's a story of so many artists lives. I just go to accept it all to say this is very cool, this work here. Very original. Let's see if we have any details. 2023 21 60 by 21 60. Sold for zero six.
01:06:01.048 - 01:06:13.886, Speaker A: And just listed a couple of days ago. So not bad at all. And 0.6. That's still like $120. Not bad at all. Not sure if there's volume. No, there's white, black, green and red.
01:06:13.886 - 01:06:30.566, Speaker A: So cool animated abstract here. Here's another one. Bees. And Dave, here is another one. So cool animated abstracts here as well. And one more from Dave. This almost looks like the picture of a projector with the matte black in the background.
01:06:30.566 - 01:07:00.774, Speaker A: It almost looks like a physical rendition here, but I'm pretty sure it's digital. Interesting exmortal surface. So really nice treatment of the edges here. Great color from exmortal of this kind of natural subject matter. Fish in the sea. And here is Renki Saito with another cool animated abstract with a lot of delay and filtering and everything. Edition of ten available for eleven tezos on object Tenyris el Buho.
01:07:00.774 - 01:07:16.084, Speaker A: Interesting piece here. It looks like almost using the owl as a paintbrush. And then drawing right across. Interesting. I like the whimsicalness of this. Two tazos. And there are seven left on primary.
01:07:16.084 - 01:07:46.868, Speaker A: And continuing on, kind of a take on Joy Division's unknown pleasures here. Cover by Peter Savile, I believe is the great graphic designer. I think we could just call him an artist who did so many of the factory record covers as well as this one, I'm 99% sure. Sleepwalker by perfect loop reserve of 0.13 automata exhibition in Rome by Satiris NFTs. I'm getting tempted to move to Rome. Yeah, that's a whole other.
01:07:46.868 - 01:08:09.384, Speaker A: And we don't have time to talk. Well, another time we can talk about the virtues. There are a lot of drawbacks, too. Let's bring this up. This is Marquis model. Yesterday is tomorrow is today. Just a little fragment here, because I think it might be longer.
01:08:09.384 - 01:08:28.748, Speaker A: Just a nice piece, eh? Beautiful. As we glide into Friday, Friday, even Friday afternoon here. Just washes over you. It feels great. There's something to be said for that. Look at those great pixels. So very nice work here.
01:08:28.748 - 01:08:46.788, Speaker A: You can just take still, you could just take stills out of that. Look at that. So very cool work by Marky model House of the model. Yesterday is tomorrow is today. Probably made the music. And this is on OnBd's world. So I think there's a new world by ONBD coming out.
01:08:46.788 - 01:09:04.074, Speaker A: They're great people over there. Really friendly and just cool. Eizou and inavare innovare. So here, the portraits of these artists continues here. And so another really cool version. Can't wait to see the physical on that too. Just really cool.
01:09:04.074 - 01:09:27.152, Speaker A: Nice kind of double image giving the Eizo treatment. I think it's so brilliant. Glitched portraiture. To do portraiture, it just makes perfect sense. And they're kind of. It's like, it's a brilliant collection, you know, just done it before with the furniture and does it again with the portraits. Really brilliant bosque, you know, again, the importance of subject matter, you know, it's kind of.
01:09:27.152 - 01:09:58.757, Speaker A: It's central, you know? So continuing on, Bosca gracias vuelapu and Vuelape Lucas. I think this came out last October 27. I never saw this one. It is a collaboration, and so just wanted to share this one. These really interesting collages, digital collages. There's a little bit more going on than collage, but I also like this. So this one is a collaboration, and that is available for Fortezos.
01:09:58.757 - 01:10:18.506, Speaker A: $0.20 on. And not sure if Paul, who is a ghost. Did they buy them all or maybe transferred? Not sure what's going on here, but it's pretty reasonable price either way. $3.58. Cool looking work, Elie Lowe. Another new work here.
01:10:18.506 - 01:10:42.762, Speaker A: Ominous conjecture. Conjecture, conjecture. Ominous conjecture, as we can see from the subject matter. So very interesting to see what Elie Lowe is putting out following that wonderful trash series. So glad to see it continues. I was worried that Ellie Lowe was just going to close the account count. It continues, which is great.
01:10:42.762 - 01:11:08.474, Speaker A: Okay, we're almost done here. Brandor Brandon Rector, this is on Instagram. I'm not sure if it's been minted. This is 3d CGI using blender. Very nice. And I have to say, this kind of curved basketball pipe here, or whatever you'd call it, it really makes the piece, doesn't it? But I mean, the deeper you look, the more you see. Just nice CGI art, not easy.
01:11:08.474 - 01:11:44.944, Speaker A: And continuing on. So here we have strange thing as we go into AI just released here, GM art family. So I feel like strange thing is cracked a code and is putting out like really what I would consider really, really nice works of art. The colors are off the charts here. And look at these great kind of worn down edges, the painterliness. Shall we just try and open this a little bit bigger here? I mean, look at this. So this is like, hasn't even been minted.
01:11:44.944 - 01:12:28.944, Speaker A: Pretty nice how it's standing up here and all this roughness just gives it a beautiful feeling here on the edges here. But clearly AI, as you zoom in here, but when you zoom out and looking again, kind of oddly familiar, but I'm not exactly sure where. Really nice work here. Almost got a dally. It feels like there's a dally. It feels like there's a dally component to this in the bread, even the dripping bread, but even the subject, this looks straight out of a daly and even this tablecloth looks out of it looks like it's out of a dally's last supper. That's what it looks like to me, but in a completely different context.
01:12:28.944 - 01:12:53.350, Speaker A: Interesting. And I love this text up here. Just another fantastic work. And here's one, minted on super rare. Through the lens of generative AI art, judgment not only invites introspection on the duality of innocence and culpability, but also poses a profound question to humanity. Okay, so let's to ETH as a reserve. And here is the work.
01:12:53.350 - 01:13:24.872, Speaker A: Let's do this. And so again, looks oddly familiar, doesn't it? And as we zoom in here, holding up quite nicely I would say we see these clearly AI lines, but looking pretty good. And then here we see the pixelated heads in the angels around this figure here with the balaclava and the fila. And again, the colors. The colors are just sensational. And here's the sky here. You see interesting textures here as well.
01:13:24.872 - 01:13:42.684, Speaker A: So just more gorgeousness from strange thing here. Familiar, but not again, you see an exhibition in Rome there for strange thing. Mikey de la creme. We don't need no thought control. So another guitar work. Again, an AI artwork. Interesting.
01:13:42.684 - 01:14:05.904, Speaker A: Not exactly sure what the reference is here. I assume it's something maybe referring to Pink Floyd. And the text there. Nice but beautiful AI painting there. Here's Sky Goodman. We stayed up all night and we're going to have to figure out. So no volume on this one, but cool again, Sky Goodman likes to use several tools.
01:14:05.904 - 01:14:18.508, Speaker A: Oftentimes probably AI. A lot of probably softwares are being used here. So another cool AI artwork. Or cool artwork, let's call it that. From Sky Goodman. And this was just released as well. We stayed up all night.
01:14:18.508 - 01:14:37.464, Speaker A: Great title. Part of a homecoming series curated by public works. Only 15 tezos edition of twelve. And here's Skomra with some interesting. With an interesting piece here. So just more experimentation from Skomra. These unicorns with the rainbows.
01:14:37.464 - 01:14:55.884, Speaker A: Classic and just interesting. Keeping it interesting. Marina Amidova, visionary reflections. Here's a one of one, and I think she's put out a few. So I thought just a nice piece here as we round up the AI. This is a 101 for 55 tezos. And these are super interesting as well.
01:14:55.884 - 01:15:12.648, Speaker A: Mo P. Wellington. So happy to announce that today my new generative AI collection, Schlafsimmer bedroom in German, drops on m props open market. It goes live at 07:00 p.m. So I think this already went live. Nice. Pretty nice.
01:15:12.648 - 01:15:31.120, Speaker A: And here's another one. I think Danielle King posted this schlafzimmer number five by Mo P Wellington. Those lamps. Yeah, look at those lamps and just everything, the textures. Like, you have to imagine these as like physical paintings. And you'd say, this is pretty impressive. M props really has a.
01:15:31.120 - 01:15:41.544, Speaker A: There's something really. Someone was. A couple of people were saying, try out m props. You won't be disappointed. And I could see why. Neg not alone. Finding company with yourself.
01:15:41.544 - 01:16:06.748, Speaker A: And you'll never spend a day alone. So just an interesting AI painting here as well. And it echoes of the pre raphaelites, I'd argue, at least in these kind of little lily pads here. Interesting sky available on is that secondary for 50 tazos? So nice work there. Intro void enter at the egress 2023. Digital painting and AI. And again, this would probably hang pretty well with venta too.
01:16:06.748 - 01:16:37.566, Speaker A: Some dragged digital brushes, sampled brushes here, nice textures here. Combining AI. It has its own feel. So this is intro void AI, figurative digital painting, available for 20 tezos, I think on primary Ohko, our global south series, which I'm really digging, defend the rights of plants to grow. Planting a seed and caring for it is a revolutionary act. So we've got the revolutionaries here continue to be portrayed. I don't think we showed this one.
01:16:37.566 - 01:17:00.822, Speaker A: There are a few by Okot, and this one is 250, and it was just minted. I think today, today is November 17. Good for 250. So awesome work there. And this, I believe it's toques, a study in violet. So experimenting, ever experimenting here by tuks. And a really nice, kind of serene, you know, office here, home office.
01:17:00.822 - 01:17:19.910, Speaker A: Looking off to a sunset. Never get tired of sunsets. Vargaard DX on Vargaard X on Instagram. Baseball card picture sold on Nifty gateway. So Satchel page. I am with the Vanguard logo here. So another Vanguard work.
01:17:19.910 - 01:17:42.508, Speaker A: And yeah, this looks like a very famous baseball card. And of course, a very famous baseball card baseball player. So just very cool work here from Vargaard. You might remember this artist who did this work. Okay, so, and this work, and I think I might have missed this work that works with the golf carts. Really cool work here. Selling on Nifty gateway.
01:17:42.508 - 01:18:00.888, Speaker A: Interestingly, here's another one. Let's see if we can make these bigger. This was sent to me by Josh Sobble. Aw, shucks. Like, great send Josh, who also sent me, by the way, the AI weiwei thing, I should have mentioned that earlier if I didn't. A week left to catch my show in Vancouver. So just more gorgeous work.
01:18:00.888 - 01:18:26.644, Speaker A: Look at these paintings, you know, looks like a big mixer. Love the subject matter here. Love it. Beautifully treated, beautifully painted oil and acrylic on canvas. So usually the way that works is you put, you start with acrylic and then you finish up with oil. Because if you put, you can put oil on acrylic, but you can't necessarily. You can put acrylic on oil, but it'll break up and it'll screw up.
01:18:26.644 - 01:18:46.968, Speaker A: So usually the proper quote, unquote, proper way of doing it is first you do your acrylic, and then you put your oil on top for the finishes, seen as a way of saving money sometimes. And also it can create a cool effect. This is beautiful. And I love the size, actually. Subject matter. The size, even the crop, the color. Brilliant.
01:18:46.968 - 01:19:04.574, Speaker A: Here's another one. I think it's the same artist, Ken A. Let's see. Because if not, it's sort of hard to get through. Let's go through here very quickly. We're already at an hour 18, so another 10 seconds, it's not going to hurt us here. So this is Ken a.
01:19:04.574 - 01:19:32.344, Speaker A: Okay. It is the same artist here, of course. Super cool to show a painting in Europe for the first time with a really amazing group of artists again. I feel like there's all sorts of opportunities right now for artists with the Internet. I think there's more openness than ever of discovering artists on Instagram, for instance, or Twitter or X. And I think this is just another example. So I guess Ken A is maybe out of Copenhagen.
01:19:32.344 - 01:19:46.988, Speaker A: Oil on canvas. This one is pure oil. Just beautiful, modern, colorful, contemporary. Plug in, you know, very cool. 25 by 18 inches. There's so much great art coming out. It's insane.
01:19:46.988 - 01:20:04.214, Speaker A: And these are nice, too. Yagi's posted these. Just collected corpo seco by Jessica Luz. This is my second piece from her scary other collection. The first one was Medusa, and so this is the new one. And I thought they were quite charming as well. The medusa is pretty cool as well, so just cool works here.
01:20:04.214 - 01:20:32.994, Speaker A: Cute and scary, as Molly park says. And here's machine. This has been added to the Joey, my art collection. Thank you so much. And I thought this was hilarious, actually. It looks like Cristiano Ronaldo and I guess a different Ronaldo and hurt, you know, a football player or soccer player with a hurt knee, and you're not sure if it's for real. And there it is in the flesh or in from scale.
01:20:32.994 - 01:20:46.002, Speaker A: And here it is on the side. So pretty hilarious there. And that, finally is your show. I'm gonna try. I'll do what I can to shorten the shows. Thank you for watching. I hope you have a wonderful weekend, and thank you for all the support.
01:20:46.002 - 01:20:47.634, Speaker A: Till next time. Take care.
