00:00:03.200 - 00:00:26.154, Speaker A: I wonder how my new neighbors are adjusting. I wonder if they can hear my voice. This is what's called an eltbau, an old construction here, an old building here in Berlin. So let's see. Artist journal, July 27, 2023. Broadcasting from the high seas, the imagination in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly.
00:00:26.154 - 00:00:48.826, Speaker A: And check out Tuks. Tuks does it again. Toques has another super original work here. Something that looks like could have only been created by AI. Of course, Tukes is an AI artist. Out of Brazil, I thought out of Turkey, but out of Brazil, I just saw on super rare. This work was listed on super rare.
00:00:48.826 - 00:01:16.782, Speaker A: Went for an ETH. Interesting title. We'll look at it in a second, but let me just zoom in so you can clearly see if you're familiar with AI. And, I mean, I was listening to a spaces yesterday with Danielle King. It was on a super rare spaces with Danielle King in Santiago, and the word came up. I'm not sure if it was the host that was saying the word AI traces. And I wonder, and I wasn't.
00:01:16.782 - 00:02:01.874, Speaker A: It's almost, I think that might be, like, maybe that's the word that people use for what I call AI distortions. But you can see here, this is definitely has the quality of AI and toques just blending. I mean, doing incredible work here, blending these super soft kind of, I guess, you know, they're almost like brushes. These kind of very, you know, soft brush gradients with these kind of hard edged lines. Kind of feels like a 21st century Kandinsky is what this looks like. If I had to summarize. I mean, what else is it like? It's not exactly, what is the name of that abstract artist? It's not exactly sai tambly.
00:02:01.874 - 00:02:40.066, Speaker A: I mean, it's really its own thing. And again, this looks like something that I'd be tempted to call natively AI, something that only AI would have produced, I don't think a human. I mean, put it this way, it's just like a whole other, uh, style that we've basically never seen before. Tooke has done this a few times, by the way, and it is kind of reminiscent of some of Took's other work. It almost feels like blends of previous works, actually, because I'll show you here. Let's actually. And, yeah, I mean, just so stunning.
00:02:40.066 - 00:03:22.084, Speaker A: Like, I mean, the originality here and the potential of AI. And so for the naysayers of AI art, I mean, I don't know what they say to stuff like this, because if tooks hadn't made it would we have ever seen anything like this? Was tuques not involved in creating this? Was this simply pressing a button? Because if it is, then all of us could make super original AI art, but that is not the case. So, really interesting piece here. Again, kind of reminiscent. And here's the title. I got a playful mind. This went for an eath to Elni, and it was actually minted a week ago.
00:03:22.084 - 00:03:51.534, Speaker A: And again, we see it's not, you know, because we're seeing in that previous ananimu kerfuffle that there was a sense that, oh, nobody had bid on it, you know, for a month, there were zero bids. Therefore, we should be happy with whatever is offered for our art. And here, I mean, nobody bid. And then an ethnic. Then it sold for an ETH. So I like this title, too. I think this is.
00:03:51.534 - 00:04:15.502, Speaker A: This is toques. I got a playful mind indeed. And one other thing I want to actually point out here, which is the edges. The edges are super interesting here. Look at you. See how first of all, there's this kind of, you know, matte black margin, and then it's not perfectly square as we go down here. It's kind of warped a little bit.
00:04:15.502 - 00:04:46.686, Speaker A: I think that's super interesting. There's almost like a drop shadow, you know, on the white part of the canvas. I think that's just another super interesting detail. And a final sort of thing just on this work. And it's square. And that also gives the sense of an AI artwork is, again, it's kind of the default for anybody that's made art on mid journey. You know, that if you don't do too much, you will get squares if you don't change the ratio.
00:04:46.686 - 00:05:12.866, Speaker A: So there is something kind of an AI quality to the square work, we might say. To the default, we might say. And we were discussing that yesterday with Kappen, but we'll get to that in a second, though. So, Tuks, so, really cool work here. Not actually perfectly square, though, I should add. This doesn't look perfectly square. So took's clearly happy with the work, made it the banner headline.
00:05:12.866 - 00:05:51.204, Speaker A: And as you can see, a bit of a departure here. But it does use what we might say it almost feels like, again, a kind of Kandinsky esque version of some of the, you know, application of some of the elements that we've seen in tuques before. And, I mean, as I said, tooks does it again. Like, this was super original here. Ayashiki Lake, which was part of this series. Here was another one, Tel DER Geister and then of course, there was enigma here. I remember starting a show with this and saying, staring into the heart of technology.
00:05:51.204 - 00:06:19.344, Speaker A: This feels like a technological, this looks like you're staring into AI, the heart of AI here. A beautiful work. And again, kind of similar ideas. This super soft, you know, brushwork, you know, spray for lack of a better term, with this super hard edged, kind of digital. We do see similarities here, but it's kind of more chaotic here, but quite effective. And again, super original. So Tuks does it again out of Brazil.
00:06:19.344 - 00:07:11.314, Speaker A: Awesome. Right up here. Deliriously wild, borderline deranged, psychedelic, multisensory outburst there is toques. Big thank you and shout out to everybody who came yesterday, especially Kappin who out of Costa Rica who, it was just a great show. Kapin's such an interesting artist and Kapn delivered and it was just like from, if you're an artist, you'll be very interested in a lot of the things that Kapn had to say and how they, and how he goes about making work and even all the different softwares that he used, very obscure softwares I'd never even heard of. So anyways, if you didn't listen to this already, 388 tuning in. So those are people who showed up and listened to after.
00:07:11.314 - 00:07:42.356, Speaker A: That is a really nice number, by the way, especially now, like, this is a great number. So again, big thank you and shout out to everybody who came. And thank you. Louis JPD, thank you for enjoying the show and the spontaneous. Yeah, it is one big improvisation and I appreciate you recognizing that there is no way I could plan and write a show like this this many times a week. So thank you for the awesome work here. I love these colors, by the way.
00:07:42.356 - 00:07:55.938, Speaker A: Two of my favorite color combinations, the violet and kind of the neon pink and this cool kind of distorted look. So anyways, I totally appreciate it. Humbling. Thank you. Louie. Jpd just awesome. Glad you're enjoying the show.
00:07:55.938 - 00:08:33.416, Speaker A: And a couple of comments from last time. I can't read all of them. I wanted to focus on Lucas Osad too much focus on easy money. So remember we're talking about how NFTs, that chart of the NFT new NFT buyers kind of going like this and that, and the person wondering out loud to themselves, why would anybody? There's no reason for people to be in NFTs right now. And because there's no money to be made, it was the rationale. So Lucas responds. Too much focus on easy money is the real problem with these art traders.
00:08:33.416 - 00:08:56.172, Speaker A: We are artists, not money. Makers. This is about supporting the culture, not chasing profits. Just as we don't expect thousands of dollars from a single collector, they shouldn't expect a profit from collecting one piece. And it's disrespectful to assume that an artist is using your name. So this is referring to the Anoni moo kerfuffle. And it's disrespectful to assume that an artist is using your name.
00:08:56.172 - 00:09:22.208, Speaker A: Just posting on Twitter. If they didn't share anything, they might even be called a bad promoter. Yes. As unknown collector was saying, I believe it doesn't make sense. And I was yeah, I mean, I've been as that kind of sank in, what happened there the last couple of days, I mean, it really was $12 above the reserve, and if the artist wanted to put a buy now at 0.15, they would have put a buy now. But they put a reserve.
00:09:22.208 - 00:09:46.134, Speaker A: And I thought it was interesting. I mean, I was thinking about it, why didn't Anoni move then just do the reserve? Because they didn't want the 24 hours auction. They wanted just a really good deal for themselves is kind of my conclusion. If you disagree, feel free. But I thought the more I thought about it, the more kind of unfair that whole episode seemed to me retro. Manny, great show. Adrian.
00:09:46.134 - 00:10:25.574, Speaker A: Ahead of the times for sure. So regarding, I think the intro there, will this scene ever be recognized? When will it be recognized, if ever? The opening question there for yesterday's or Tuesday's show, ahead of the times for sure. Regarding how much attention to give to NFTs specifically, I kind of agree. I personally love when you go through an artist's social media page and pick out pieces from there, especially when there's work in progress. Is that NFT related? Sometimes, I guess. But pointing out as we look at the work in progress, in progress, it really is about the art first. And I think it's because, you know, I am an artist first.
00:10:25.574 - 00:11:11.886, Speaker A: So I genuinely like when things are working or, or however things are working, like, I kind of want to know. So I have to be careful here as my table is about to fall apart here. So all to say, yeah. And that's not to say none of us are interested in money, but I think we're kind of art first because if we were interested in money, most of us should be in a different business. Okay. Like, if you're all about money first, you should probably be in like, finance or computer programming at least like, you know, AI, I don't know, but you should probably shouldn't be an artist if your goal is to make it big financially. So thank you for the comments.
00:11:11.886 - 00:11:26.620, Speaker A: Very interesting. And human boy, good thing to purge after a move. Absolutely. And that is big time what I'm doing. I'm still kind of recovering from the allergies here. It really does show you all the things you just don't want to carry around anymore. I think it's going to be liberating.
00:11:26.620 - 00:11:43.156, Speaker A: I've already started this process. Interesting to see the new location has you facing the opposite direction as well. Now it looks like you are reviewing the art with us. So that was something gogolitis has kind of mentioned to me two or three times at least. You really got to fix that. Go. Go.
00:11:43.156 - 00:12:03.126, Speaker A: Litis, of course, is a graphic designer, I think, by trade. So, yeah, that is not lost. And so I was really happy to fix that. And I want to kind of upgrade a few things here as we go on. But let's just, yeah, get the show done and one thing at a time. But thank you, human boy. Always great to hear from you.
00:12:03.126 - 00:12:29.536, Speaker A: And finally, demon ego. Thank you for your comments on the monologue in a moment of despair. As you know, I've been showing my green cutting mat for a long time in photos of the creation phase of my physical collages. You gave me the idea to digitally create the cutting mat and add it to my gift collages while you were showing these photos in your journals before. So actually, I didn't include the physical mat in any of my works. All I added were digital grids. But I'll add the physical from now on.
00:12:29.536 - 00:12:57.994, Speaker A: The idea came to me in my mind. Thank you. Thanks to you again. And it's the power I think of, because it's not like I had some insight here. I was just trying to describe the work, and it's the power of conversation. I mean, it's the magic of conversation is where all of a sudden, you know, oh, I just say something and all of a sudden it's maybe slightly different than you would have said it, and then all of a sudden you have like five other ideas that come along with that. And then I vibe off that.
00:12:57.994 - 00:13:18.264, Speaker A: So we're vibing here. So great to hear from you, demon ego. That's really awesome. And thank you, everybody here for the comments. Just too much fun. It is too much fun. And also, finally, eight so commented on the show from Monday, where we're discussing the phone pieces and releasing them all at once.
00:13:18.264 - 00:13:36.632, Speaker A: Thanks for showing my phone pieces. So glad to see you're still checking out my work. To your point, yes. I likely could have made more money off of the cell phones had I released them slower and priced them higher. So back to the money theme. I expected even editions would have done better money wise. But I have a lot of these, so I'd rather get them out and moving fast.
00:13:36.632 - 00:14:05.010, Speaker A: During this bear, I have very little release plan and I'm minting listing at random times to give folks in different time zones a better chance. Some will be auctions, all will be one of ones. And I think this is great. I like the lightheartedness and I think I kind of do. I kind of list pretty randomly too. I think it's good to experiment and see what works. Excuse me, excuse me.
00:14:05.010 - 00:14:33.544, Speaker A: I am still recovering here, people, but thank you for your patience. And finally, walk, still unrecognized by most of the world, this digital art scene that we're discussing. So walk weighs in. Always fascinating, amazing artist, and buy on the dip. Bonus points for quoting Brian Tracy. And yeah, this is close to my heart. I mean, Brian Tracy, it's not for everybody, but I consider Brian Tracy the original life coach.
00:14:33.544 - 00:15:07.360, Speaker A: And, you know, when I was a teenager, I found it. I didn't know how to act. Like they don't really teach you in school what is like appropriate behavior. Especially, you know, there's no practical ethics class. There's no, you know, like in Greece, in ancient greek philosophy, they call it phronsis practical wisdom. Right. And that's why I see actually a lot of these, what I call the success philosophers even like, and I'm not even a big Tony Robbins fan or something, but I'd put them in that tradition.
00:15:07.360 - 00:15:34.124, Speaker A: They're kind of like out of american pragmatism. Out of a. They're like a branch of american pragmatism, which goes all the way back to the Greeks with like Aristotle and the nicomachean ethics, which is what is appropriate action. Right? Like, how do you act? Is there a. Is one way to act better than another? And intuitively we know this, but we don't necessarily. We're not really taught this. So this is quite valuable stuff.
00:15:34.124 - 00:16:02.312, Speaker A: So I actually did a search on Brian Tracy, the unbreakable laws of self confidence. This is a very great video. There's Brian Tracy. Yeah. So this is awesome. So it's, again, it's not for everybody, but if you are interested, I will leave the link in the description today's show. And it's great for, like, put it this way, I've given it to some people.
00:16:02.312 - 00:16:47.864, Speaker A: I've sent this video to and some people are like, want nothing to do with it. Other people, they go, you know, I haven't gotten over my relationship for seven years after watching this. Like, this is like giving me the clarity I need to move on. So it's really depends on the person, you know, but it's out there if you, if you're interested. I thought this was super interesting. So this came in my email box from Art News, their newsletter here. Christy fails to sell $400,000 lost Robbie NFT weeks after a similar one sold on super rare and I think this is the work AI generated, nude portrait number seven, frame number 190 from 2018 by Robbie Barrett.
00:16:47.864 - 00:17:20.046, Speaker A: So pretty early there for the blockchain and fairly early for AI. But I'm not an expert. I mean, people have been doing AI art, I guess, for the last ten years. But let's just take a quick look at this here. Earlier this month, Robbie Barrett's digital artwork sold for frame number 111. This is frame number 190, sold for 175 ETH, or approximately $343,000 on super rare. So huge sale on super rare.
00:17:20.046 - 00:18:00.924, Speaker A: The sale was notable not just for its impressive price, but because it was made using AI. The super rare sale was not the first time Baratt's work sold for six figures. Last year, another piece from the same series sold for 300 ETH, about a million dollars at the time. It was perhaps unsurprising then that when this that when earlier this month, Christie's announced a new digital art auction in collaboration with Gucci future frequencies exploration and generative art and fashion. The highest starting bid, 228th $409,000, was for another brat work. AI generated, nude portrait, frame number 190. Yet when the sale ended Tuesday, the lot was unsold.
00:18:00.924 - 00:18:35.592, Speaker A: So I guess this was like the reserve, is what I'm assuming. Which raises the question, is buyer interest in AI art dissipating? So I'm not sure it has anything to do with AI art. I have a couple of theories on this. I think theory number one, it might have to do. This is the work in question I haven't seen too. I kind of briefly glanced at the previous work that's sold on super rare. I have a feeling that other work kind of worked a little bit better.
00:18:35.592 - 00:19:19.484, Speaker A: It could be the individual work itself that might be part of the issue. And then I thought it could also have to do with the nature of the collector bases that are on these platforms. Super rare, of course, comes out of crypto, and crypto is a bit more of a higher risk, more speculative culture, and that's part of what makes it great. That's probably why we sell a little more work on tazos and super rare or wherever on ethereum. And it's because collectors actually think, oh, this is like the start of a new art movement. There's money to be made here if I kind of pick some of this work up early. Whereas Christie's might have a more traditional audience.
00:19:19.484 - 00:19:46.754, Speaker A: Right. I mean, there is overlap. So it's not. They're not mutually exclusive collector bases, but on Christie's you probably have a more traditional collector base, which probably is less speculative. So I have a feeling it's a combination of the work itself, perhaps, and the collector base. You know, maybe super rare is somewhere where you're just going to get a crazy bid out of nowhere. We see this all the time.
00:19:46.754 - 00:20:27.774, Speaker A: You know, there's toques like, it's a brilliant, beautiful work, but tooks just rakes in $1,800 like that. I mean, that's pretty good and a testament to the NFt market and part of what makes it tick, because as we've been mentioning over and over, that financial incentive really gets artists producing because there's big money to be made. Right? Again, I don't want to diminish the financial aspect. It's super important. So all to say, but it is interesting what happened here. And those are my kind of two theories on that. Nicholas Sassoon and Nicholas Sassoon, a pretty prominent artist, 20,000 followers there.
00:20:27.774 - 00:21:01.298, Speaker A: 13 years ago, I asked for advice to an older artist who recently passed away from an older artist. And the advice was build a community of people you can rely on. Back then, I didn't listen. Now I think about his words every day. Sales come and go, friendships stay. May your art be a way to find those friendships. So it's kind of back to this idea that really, the money is important, but the money shouldn't be your top thing unless, you know, unless you have very special situation.
00:21:01.298 - 00:21:29.476, Speaker A: But really put it this way, it's really nice when, you know, there are things that are more important than money at the end of the day. Right? And again, you don't become an artist in order to make a ton of money. Some people do, but it's not necess. It's a very, you know, the ultimate high risk, if that's your plan, so. And look at this beautiful work here, by the way. Kind of reminds me of these gogolitis. Some of Gogolitis's landscape works.
00:21:29.476 - 00:21:50.724, Speaker A: Beautiful kind of cycling colors here, probably on a retro software. Again, I highly recommend people check out that Kappan episode. I'm going to upload it. Hopefully there might be two or three podcasts that get uploaded in the next day or two. I'm a couple of weeks behind on that. Continuing on. This was just kind of cool.
00:21:50.724 - 00:22:15.870, Speaker A: I can't pronounce Andreas Geysen feedback ascii art so I just thought this was cool. So feedback test. Unfortunately the music is from a band so I don't want to put it in here. But look at how cool that looks. So a couple of screens here and that just looks super cool. So just thought that was worth showing. Yeah.
00:22:15.870 - 00:22:37.374, Speaker A: Spiegels Maskinen. This looks amazing. So yeah. Double helix by emeralds is the track feedback test. So just interesting. I don't even know what's going on here but it looks great here is that collaboration. So eight so whose comment we just read about the one of one cell phones collaborated with Sky Goodman and I thought this was a pretty cool collaboration here.
00:22:37.374 - 00:22:56.738, Speaker A: See if we can get it working. It is slowly working here. And here we go. Here we go. I think this is just a brilliant. A match made in heaven here. I think it's perfect, this collaboration and it turned out beautifully.
00:22:56.738 - 00:23:07.628, Speaker A: So really nice work here. Sky Goodman and Eizo. Let's just see what happened here. Sold out at ten tezos. And now offers coming in. Strange thing. 20 tezos.
00:23:07.628 - 00:23:23.724, Speaker A: Dernadler. 25. 20. So that is pretty good. And here's another one. And this is now 50 on secondary. So just a really cool kind of two part series from eight.
00:23:23.724 - 00:23:36.848, Speaker A: So. And Sky Goodman. Very cool. I love this. These lines and everything just match made in heaven Easter egg with the highs. So just really cool. And here.
00:23:36.848 - 00:23:46.160, Speaker A: And again, Dernadler comes in. Dernadler had to have it. 25 tezos. Beautiful. So there's John Thurman. Shout out. Amelia Versace.
00:23:46.160 - 00:24:01.324, Speaker A: John Cates, Mikey Wilson. Again, you see how small this scene is, which is what makes it so magical. Here's a couple of the cell phones from Eizo. I think I had this one. The Nakia 3310. I think I had this one. This was a great phone.
00:24:01.324 - 00:24:17.736, Speaker A: The browser wasn't that great, as you can imagine. But I remember I have almost a nostalgia when I look at this one. A one of one. And these are selling for this one at auction for 35 tazos. Pretty reasonable. So again, eight. So is just putting them all out and seeing what happens.
00:24:17.736 - 00:24:31.302, Speaker A: Let's just see what happened here. 25 tezos. Tomalia Versace. So your opportunity to get a eight. So one of one cell phone. They're selling cheap and they look great. And just a really cool concept.
00:24:31.302 - 00:25:06.748, Speaker A: 2600 classic nikia and hear rinifish and listen to this music. Quisbide de siren. Maybe the song of the sirens. I don't know what cuispide means, but I know the sirens here. Music cmocell behind the waterfalls. This is off bandcamp so this should just be a small oops, kind of sounds like Porto said, a bit super cool. Look at rinifish.
00:25:06.748 - 00:25:23.728, Speaker A: This is awesome. Looks great. So hopefully the copyright police don't track me down here. I think for 15 seconds. Nothing. I believe you have 30 seconds. We're not going to open the Roland cloud manager there, tempting as that might be.
00:25:23.728 - 00:25:36.404, Speaker A: So cool. Work from rinnefish not listed yet. Looking great. And again, rinifish recently went. We had her on the spaces maybe two or three weeks ago. And she recently went full time as an artist out of China. Very cool.
00:25:36.404 - 00:26:00.202, Speaker A: And this, I'm not sure where this is out of. Let's just see here if we can get a country. But I thought really cool kind of writing here, Indonesia. So I don't know if this is Indonesian. Yeah, because it wasn't quite clear to me what language this is. Look at that. Those who wander are lost.
00:26:00.202 - 00:26:23.032, Speaker A: So interesting work here. Sold for .2 on super rare part of a larger series here, I just thought super original here. And nice texture, by the way, so almost kind of has that graphica Png texture. And look at this, kind of like, you know, I assume this is Indonesian. I don't know what language. I guess there's an indonesian language I should know.
00:26:23.032 - 00:26:42.798, Speaker A: But this looks like almost pixelated version of this script here. Super cool. So. And then just kind of like a poetic work here. So very cool here. And here are some of the other works. So similar idea, this pixelated script.
00:26:42.798 - 00:26:57.238, Speaker A: I love it. Continuing on. Okay, so this is. Yeah, artists out of Indonesia. And here's some of their other works here. So very cool. Mocha spaces is bought, a few of them.
00:26:57.238 - 00:27:11.426, Speaker A: So nice collectors there. Big shout out to mocha Gozo. Uncertain gaze. Morning fog. I can't remember. I don't know if it was. Maybe it was Sabato who retweeted this, but this looked pretty cool too.
00:27:11.426 - 00:27:43.718, Speaker A: Look at this texture. We're kind of back to these like really interesting textures. And quite a great composition as well. I mean, it looks like a plant, maybe a tulip or a rose is about to bloom with this, like wildly out of focus, kind of pink, you know, wildly out of focus digital backdrop. And it almost looks like knitting, but I mean, but not so really interesting work here from Gozo morning fog. Just really cool. Pixel fool.
00:27:43.718 - 00:28:06.234, Speaker A: So this is some sort of software? I think Treyma is software so you can interact with it using the following commands. P pauses the animation. S saves a screenshot. G saves a gif. Here's a Gif from trauma number 53, minted by digital Coleman. So maybe this is part of another series. I'm not quite sure.
00:28:06.234 - 00:28:14.486, Speaker A: But I see these pixels. I see this dithering. I see this. It just. And it just attracts me. Similar palette. This is much loved.
00:28:14.486 - 00:28:22.394, Speaker A: So here's another one. Yeah. Almost exactly the same palette. Almost. And here. And now treyma number 78. Mesmerizing.
00:28:22.394 - 00:28:43.890, Speaker A: So pretty interesting work here from pixel fools. So I don't know if that's like FX hash or. Look at that. I don't know exactly what's going on here, but check out pixel Fool's page if you're interested. I just thought that looked really cool. Sabato edition of eight. This sold out like really fast.
00:28:43.890 - 00:29:10.760, Speaker A: I'd love this piece. I think it was pretty cheap too. Yeah, well, 841, he had it one out at 444 recently. So now selling for eleven on secondary. Just continuing the Barbie World revisited series. And I thought this was a really, really nice one as well. Just, you know, there's something to be said for just like massive negative space like this and everything.
00:29:10.760 - 00:29:29.434, Speaker A: Just beautiful. So look at that, how it just kind of comes apart and comes back. Looks like kind of reusing the magazine thing. And it's like that game looks hilarious. Or you make points at the magazine stand. Glitches from corrupted Super Nintendo roms. Barbie supermodel.
00:29:29.434 - 00:29:59.694, Speaker A: And another work from Sabato, this time celebrating the trash theme, trash love. And here you see almost what look like tongues coming out of the garbage here, perhaps, or these kind of worm things and falling in love. So a homage. There's two little birds on the wires with a almost a toxic waste background here. Toxic waste greens and a purple sky. And that beautiful cycling colors. I mean, people mention in the spaces.
00:29:59.694 - 00:30:29.090, Speaker A: Sabato is becoming a master of deluxe paint. And the cool thing about that, if you go back to the early drawing exercises, maybe we can do that really quick. I mean, you'll see how basically, how humble. Like, if we go to the oldest, they start out of just like, you know, some guy trying to make things work. Like, look at this. This is the first one. Maybe a reasonable price here.
00:30:29.090 - 00:30:47.724, Speaker A: I mean, so just testing stuff out and now is like a total master. Well, who knows if he's. He's now just brilliant, let's put it that way. He's brilliant on the deluxe paint. So just goes to show. And when was the date on that? How long has this been? February 13, 2022. So it's been less than a year and a half.
00:30:47.724 - 00:31:14.976, Speaker A: So just keeping hammering away at it. Muji, I believe. Also on deluxe paint, dpaint, two twin towers. Interesting title. And continuing with these really interesting colors and abstraction here and beautiful animations. Just, you know, and again, this kind of astronomical theme, a lot of dithering. And just, again, abstraction available for seven tezos on primary.
00:31:14.976 - 00:31:28.464, Speaker A: And let's just see. Selling a few. So sold three. So those are still available. Great color. I love that deep violet or that light violet. Cool work by Zoxo.
00:31:28.464 - 00:32:12.704, Speaker A: Only four minted with one day to go, again, using what looks like a super Mario star, and maybe Tetris, combining them and making a work out of it. So just really interesting, isn't it? I mean, I think just really, we're kind of back to video games here, and I think it's a theme that's just going to stay with us as long as we look at, you know, this pixel art or this kind of. I mean, I think we could call this pixel art. It's kind of chunky. Speaking of which. And I adore this piece here because it looks like a instant pot or a pressure cooker. Making soup by element ly, one of my favorite pixel artists here.
00:32:12.704 - 00:32:27.072, Speaker A: And just beautifully done. And this almost makes it look like packaging here. Like it's a front of an instruction manual or something. And here is that instant pot. So just very cool. Making soup. Six tay.
00:32:27.072 - 00:32:44.624, Speaker A: So it's big. Shout out to mom, who bought me an instant pot for Christmas a couple of years ago. And continuing on. Window. So this looks like it's maybe like a train window. And again, just kind of very abstract. Is that rain, you know, on the window here? Just super interesting.
00:32:44.624 - 00:33:15.798, Speaker A: And it's very bold in the way that it's kind of refusing to be overly representative. Right? Like it's allowing itself to be loose, rough, and, you know, like it looks like it's all kind of hand done. Making it look easy, I might add. Window six tazos edition of 20. Sticking with those colors, by the way, which is interesting. This may be a slightly lighter blue here, but that is interesting. Chaz, who kind of a new discovery here.
00:33:15.798 - 00:33:36.256, Speaker A: Scan expert. So here we have. Remember the pong one, where it had the computer at a maybe a 45 degree angle. So this is the next one. And it looks, again like an office here. And some retro computers here. And maybe that actually looks more like a fax coming out here, but hard to say.
00:33:36.256 - 00:33:54.310, Speaker A: And a desk. Just a cool work here. Scan expert 845 on secondary. Let's just see what happened on primary here. Only three tezos, 150 if you made an offer. So that is quite a good deal. Addition of 15 green ginger with another piece resting in the wilderness.
00:33:54.310 - 00:34:27.185, Speaker A: So this is an edition of 20 for three tezos on primary. And just a campsite here with a nice little fire and a forest. And interestingly, a whole bunch of negative space around it. So, I mean, again, that feels kind of video gamey when that happens. And what's kind of interesting, I mean, I don't know if. And the wind actually, or whatever is going on here with the tent is quite interesting. I mean, what this does, though, when you stop the forest, it's almost like you almost are seeing only what they see.
00:34:27.185 - 00:34:40.933, Speaker A: Like you're kind of limited to what, you know. If there's a person in here and what they see, they'll only see these trees. They're not going to see these trees over here. This part is blind. So just interesting composition. Interesting, interesting. Resting in the wilderness.
00:34:40.933 - 00:35:06.823, Speaker A: Edmar Ola with some interesting works here. Boredom. One of one for 55 tazos. And again, unafraid to have these kind of blurry pixels here and a figure here. And just. I like the frame a lot too, in this interesting kind of experiment in the corners here and everything. And probably using procreate and aspirite again.
00:35:06.823 - 00:35:24.538, Speaker A: Maybe it says here. No. So bored out of Marilla's art shop. Pretty reasonable for a one of one Ed Marolla firefighters. So topical. As the Mediterranean is on fire, it looks like Rhodes is going to be under control by the time I get there. But yeah.
00:35:24.538 - 00:36:04.690, Speaker A: So here is just a really interesting kind of topical work here of firefighters kind of coming through the clouds from above. Again, kind of. I finally remember the name. Kind of almost like a chagall like quality to it. It's kind of got this semi fantasy because, of course, firefighters would be small, but you almost see like the symbolic firefighters over top in skeletons, you know? And then the fire, of course, goes beautifully with Ed's kind of animation style, just kind of moving pixels back and forth. It almost makes those heat waves from the fire. It's perfect.
00:36:04.690 - 00:36:18.362, Speaker A: So very interesting in that blue. That's going to save the day. And you see the smoke here. Beautifully done. Very beautifully done. So, edition of five. Only 15 tezos, four left.
00:36:18.362 - 00:36:52.820, Speaker A: So get it while you can. Biological regeneration resort. So, edition of 22 and offers are coming in at 1110, so people want it. And again, Stalomere does this kind of very unusual, what I'd call Sci-Fi pixel art. Again, you saw the title there. And again, this looks like some futuristic planet or something. And you see these massive plant trees and the crazy colors here.
00:36:52.820 - 00:37:11.364, Speaker A: Just interesting. Very interesting. As usual. Great title. Homeworld Memories is the name of the series. And for those that don't know, yeah, I mean, you see all sorts of kind of alien looking scenes here. So again, kind of Sci-Fi pixel art.
00:37:11.364 - 00:37:30.218, Speaker A: Alien nostalgia. Look like the sub. You see that alien nostalgia. Interesting clue. Notorious man XDZ with a work here, nature Guardian. And so again, it's continuing with this very kind of wide angle composition style. A little bit more dithering here.
00:37:30.218 - 00:37:52.130, Speaker A: And continuing to experiment here, continue to broaden here. Almost a classical theme. And here we have some stars that are coming in and out. And a halo. So interesting experimentation here from notorious Man XTZ. And this looks like a waterfall, maybe. Interesting dripping pixels here.
00:37:52.130 - 00:38:07.824, Speaker A: Very interesting. Nature guardian, one of one. Let's just see what happened. Sold for 52 tazos to dither. And dither, of course. Does those tvs. Remember, does those big retro tvs in collaboration with people.
00:38:07.824 - 00:38:27.922, Speaker A: Cream safa with a really cool. I don't have too much cream sapphire because it's usually pretty expensive. Here's an open edition 49 have been minted. Only five tazos. Look at this now. Kareem Safa, I believe, is out of turkey, if I remember right. And usually it's kind of.
00:38:27.922 - 00:38:55.202, Speaker A: I don't know if I'd say it's actually usually a landscape. The walk. Two roads diverged in a wood and I took the ones less traveled by and that has made all the difference. Robert Frost. And so 384 by 216, magnified by five and two colors. So not exactly sure. So it's almost like this is the walking figure, right? It's almost like the figure is reduced to energy pixels.
00:38:55.202 - 00:39:24.330, Speaker A: And this almost looks like a sea, but could be anything. Interesting piece, as usual from Karim safa. Kind of half, you see abstract there, kind of like half abstract. This walking energy, this walking swarm. Haiti rocket also had a turkey deadline. Very cool. Pesky filter skull, basically pesky skull loop.
00:39:24.330 - 00:39:41.986, Speaker A: And here you see there are a few of them. So Haiti Rockette continuing to another person that loves to experiment and does a wonderful job with that. Just an awesome artist. Remember that, you know, on this. Yeah, like I mean, and, wow. I never. I don't even.
00:39:41.986 - 00:39:52.968, Speaker A: Yeah, we did. Look at that one. And the GM thing. Huge experimenter. So look at those big chunky pixels. Just awesome artist recanto. This was interesting.
00:39:52.968 - 00:40:09.496, Speaker A: I had to do a double take on this one. I thought, okay, here's a retro tv again. But then. Wait a second. So this is called digital painting and it's a tv on an easel. And there you almost see some art supplies here. So I thought that was quite brilliant.
00:40:09.496 - 00:40:28.304, Speaker A: And look who's inside. It is Bob Ross, the guy. So just an interesting work here from Recano. And I love the palm tree for extra effect. And that nice matte black background. Nice work there, too. Buy for five tazos on primary two.
00:40:28.304 - 00:40:46.834, Speaker A: Left edition of ten. Nice work, Sergeant Slaughtermelon, you said you. I believe Sabato might have retweeted this. I was kind of rating Sabato's page there this morning. You said you liked Arc V two. Some of these early designs have been redone to fit the more consistent dimensions and with a richer body of imagery. I just thought this was interesting.
00:40:46.834 - 00:41:14.314, Speaker A: So again, taking the kind of Windows 95 operating system as a kind of. As a compositional device and then editing it, you know, using the selection. Right, the. What do they call that? Radial selection or something? Sometimes. And then editing it to sometimes. And I guess. And then you said you liked art, so maybe this is the art.
00:41:14.314 - 00:41:33.896, Speaker A: And then you see these discs going into this retro computer here, CD ROM, old software boxes. Just hilarious. Awesome, awesome work here. Cool artist. What is the name? Sergeant Slaughtermelon. Let's make sure we're following them. Continuing on.
00:41:33.896 - 00:42:00.206, Speaker A: Nicholas Dietrich, excuse me. With a work in progress, new work in progress. A view I saw from the top of an old office block in north Dublin. So an international digital art scene. So just very cool here. And again, it's tempting to feel like this is pretty handcrafted. And the interesting dither from this kind of landscape to the foreground here.
00:42:00.206 - 00:42:21.630, Speaker A: So I'm guessing using aspirites, kind of like gradient tool, but not sure about that. Pixel art digital painting. And they are both. So just a cool work in progress from Nicholas Dietrich. And here's a work in progress from RJ. So we're actually going to see the finished version too. So here was the first one.
00:42:21.630 - 00:42:39.104, Speaker A: And let me just bring up. This was the finished painting, the struggle. And it is at auction with 16 hours to go. So now it's probably just a few hours. I think the last I saw was at maybe 0.4 or 0.5 and so a cool one of one from RJ, who likes to experiment.
00:42:39.104 - 00:43:16.090, Speaker A: Again, we're kind of back to this idea of experimenting with selling styles, experimenting on ways to sell art. And RJ was doing it. You see eight. So it's kind of part of the, you know, this new digital blockchain domain. I mean, it's not like it's. There's a standard, there are standards, but I mean, there's still so many different ways you can sell work. And you see with like Kappn, the pixels, maybe you'll get a discount if you have on a future work or early access to a work you can buy if you have a certain amount of pixels with Kapn.
00:43:16.090 - 00:43:33.044, Speaker A: So just all very interesting. Look how minimal this is. You know who this reminds me of, oddly, is element Li. This reminds me a little bit of element li. So just very, especially here. So just super interesting. Of course, look at the floor, too.
00:43:33.044 - 00:44:12.050, Speaker A: Super interesting work here from RJ. And of course, he uses an online pixel art program which really gives him his kind of distinct style. And we're seeing that with Kappan, with the figments. You'd have to go into that episode. I can't remember exactly the names of the softwares Kappn uses, but again, it's back to this obvious point, but worth stating that the tools create are key components into the results. I mean, it's a very obvious point, just like with oil painting. But artists come to these tools and then make what they can with these tools.
00:44:12.050 - 00:44:52.884, Speaker A: And so what it highlights for me though, this very obvious point that I'm making is the importance of finding these kind of different tools, which clearly Kappn was doing some searching around to find some kind of, you know, unusual software. So we've seen Heidi rocket do that with those kind of architectural works and brilliance 2.0. Right? It's like looking for deluxe paint, finding obscure art programs. There's something to be gained from that. So cool work here from RJ. Interesting work from Greco Rando. Luxury without money, fancy doubts.
00:44:52.884 - 00:45:08.424, Speaker A: Just a nice painting inspired by the wonderful painting Andy Dixon. Leisure studies. Now, I didn't realize this was based on an Andy Dixon. Let's see if we can find that. Because I don't know if you know Andy Dixon. Pretty interesting artist, actually. Let's see if we can find.
00:45:08.424 - 00:45:23.724, Speaker A: Oh, so kind of loosely based on this. Yeah. Really? I haven't looked at Andy Dixon's work for quite a long time. He's quite a good artist, I have to say. He. Yeah, really interesting artist. We'll have to look at more.
00:45:23.724 - 00:45:41.568, Speaker A: And there's Andy Dixon right there. Really interesting guy. Doing very well in the contemporary art scene. And. Yeah, just a super interesting artist. Really interesting. So also using tennis, you know, just like Jonas Wood was doing the tennis courts, you see? Yeah.
00:45:41.568 - 00:45:55.160, Speaker A: Leisure studies opens in New York. Anyway, I don't want to get us off track here. This is. Yeah, like, I mean, but you see 2015, like, that's kind of when I was kind of learning about Andy Dixon. But I haven't heard a ton. I'm sure he's doing stuff. But pretty interesting.
00:45:55.160 - 00:46:13.256, Speaker A: So this is inspired by the wonderful painting Andy Dick by Andy Dixman Dixon. Well, nice piece here. And you can tell, like, Greco made it his own. I love the net here, too. Very beautiful. And just very. I love the guy smoking the cigarette as he plays tennis.
00:46:13.256 - 00:46:28.438, Speaker A: Hilarious. This is an open edition for 250 and 17. Have been minted. Open for another day and a half. And of course, dan control, newlyweds. The rooster and the chicken. The hen and the rooster.
00:46:28.438 - 00:46:43.026, Speaker A: Getting married here. And they're all done with the beautiful outlines and gradients. With the outlines removed. Congratulations. Edition of 20 for seven tazos. Five are left on primary. This is something.
00:46:43.026 - 00:47:04.654, Speaker A: I can't remember how I found this one. This was on Instagram and I just thought this was a really interesting work here. So this is almost more out of like the contemporary art scene. But it is using. It is using procreate I saw somewhere. So here is just a really interesting. But I don't think it's on the blockchain that I know of.
00:47:04.654 - 00:47:23.098, Speaker A: And because you see a lot of these are just like physical works. But then you see here. And this is how I knew. You see watercolor, procreate print art sketch. So gouache. So probably done on procreate. Interestingly.
00:47:23.098 - 00:47:47.482, Speaker A: So that is Lena Dean out of London, another artist I don't think we've seen before. Lena Eckert kind of would hang really good with MCH X. Kind of color field esque. Nice. Really nice. Abstract. Almost feels like AI, but not positive on that interesting transition.
00:47:47.482 - 00:48:09.890, Speaker A: So this is abstract digital artworks. So probably not AI. Maybe painted this way or produced manually. We might say edition of 25. Only a tazo 6011 left. Pretty nice work, insider with a couple of fruits here. I think I saw this on Sabato's feed here, too.
00:48:09.890 - 00:48:27.588, Speaker A: He had a bunch of great retweets yesterday. And look at this. Beautiful. I think these are grapes, these beautifully distorted grapes. And look at all that texture and the different green. You gotta love it when it's just slightly off green like that. So really, really nice work from cider, as usual.
00:48:27.588 - 00:48:57.866, Speaker A: Look at the watermelon. Just like, distorted the heck out of it. And, you know, adding all this texture, it almost looks like the photo of a basement wall here as like an overlay, just to give it texture. But who knows? And look at that great edge. So. And of course, green and orange, I believe, are opposites on the color wheel, aren't they? So complimentary colors and just really cool work. Jeffrey.
00:48:57.866 - 00:49:20.724, Speaker A: Duh. Let me get the de crazy with a new work. Oh, there's some audio here too. Bear market kind of reminds me a little bit of Spuegel's maskinen, those tvs that we're all collecting. Different take on it. Illustration. Contemporary illustration.
00:49:20.724 - 00:49:39.270, Speaker A: Just cool work. I believe this sold. Let's take a quick look here. Eduard, for one ETH. So again, pretty good in a bear market. When was that? Just July 23, a few days ago. Nice work.
00:49:39.270 - 00:49:57.874, Speaker A: And soc mplexed. Let's see if we can get the name right here. Soc mplexed. Soc complexed, socomplexed. Maybe goldfish. And this sold for $13,000. Jimbal accepted an offer of seven ETH.
00:49:57.874 - 00:50:15.884, Speaker A: So, okay, so maybe. Okay, so this is an older work. I saw this in super rare's recent sales. I didn't realize it was a resale. Wow. But that is notable. These guys would hang really well together, wouldn't they? Kind of contemporary illustration, even.
00:50:15.884 - 00:50:42.248, Speaker A: Yeah. So very interesting. So $13,000. Another beautiful work by boss gratias. I'm loving this series here, this really cool juxtaposition of painting and photography with this gorgeous, gorgeous negative, you know, element here of a photographic negative. It's beautiful. It's absolutely beautiful.
00:50:42.248 - 00:50:55.504, Speaker A: And it's just beautiful. Pleasure. Photo collage, edition of seven for three tazos. I picked one up. There are three left, so get them while you can. Here's another one. Mixinicchio, photo collage.
00:50:55.504 - 00:51:14.210, Speaker A: And that looks like maybe. Is that a. Who? What artist is that? I don't think that's Picasso. I think that's someone else. So just another really cool juxtaposition. And you know what I love about this series that bosque is doing is he's really being original. He's not always doing the same thing with the negatives.
00:51:14.210 - 00:51:31.738, Speaker A: Like here. Like, he's being very creative with it here. He's got the light negative and everything. I'm just. Yeah, like, I'm really impressed at how creative he is with these elements like keeping it new. And three tezos, five left. And here was a.
00:51:31.738 - 00:51:44.018, Speaker A: I think this is a cyanotype. And, you know, some more photography here. Cyanotype. Canson a 3300 grams. So this is the paper. So it's a. A three.
00:51:44.018 - 00:52:05.954, Speaker A: And it is 300 grams paper. And this is from Rennes, who I. Not sure film photography, but pretty nice. Hey, so this is probably a physical work, if it's a cyanotype. Beautiful process here. And here's someone who would hang well with that too. Wv levoix, the voices.
00:52:05.954 - 00:52:22.918, Speaker A: And this is inkjet on, watercolor paper, ink needles, white pen, tape. Digital photography. So this looks like a combination of physical and digital elements. And again, would probably hang kind of nicely with that. That last work there. There's the pins. Fascinating.
00:52:22.918 - 00:52:43.094, Speaker A: Seven tezos, and there are six left. Edition of 13. Mikey Wilson with a new AI artwork. Exo tour life blues. And this is again, using. It's a raw AI work with mid journey edition of 15 and selling at ten tezos each. Very nice.
00:52:43.094 - 00:52:57.484, Speaker A: So this is awesome. And just another cool blues work. I've been trying to get these painterly textures here. Mikey Wilson has figured out how to do it. He's doing a very nice job here. You will see the signature. You gotta love that.
00:52:57.484 - 00:53:17.034, Speaker A: Very nice work here and here. I mean, raw AI and getting all these great shadows and everything getting better and better. Inspiring. I find Mikey Wilson's work really inspiring. It inspired me to go back into AI. And here you have the door going through the painting here. Hilarious zoom.
00:53:17.034 - 00:53:47.330, Speaker A: And I think, actually, Mikey Wilson retweeted this too, and collected nose to nose. So another AI artwork from sum, kind of poetic work here. Playing with these again, these kind of pale figures here. And again, I think this is raw AI. So, I mean, incredible that you're getting these from text prompts, I think two figures kind of on the side of a bed. It's got a very kind of modernist contemporary art feel to it, doesn't it? Kind of got that museum feel. Digital art, AI illustration, AI art, nose to nose.
00:53:47.330 - 00:54:09.764, Speaker A: And this is sold out at Fortezos each. There's Mickey Wilson. Very cool. And here is from Chimasuku Jackson's hologram gallery, grandma's red flower pin. So this artwork was minted for the being alive solo show by Brandon Vosika at Hologram gallery. So this is a physical work. Acrylic and pastel on canvas, 22 by 18 inches.
00:54:09.764 - 00:54:37.370, Speaker A: Pretty nice show. I mean, Chi Moscow Jackson is probably making some waves out there in Seattle, because this is all looking really good, of course. Just came off the Kurt Hussle collective solo show. I mean, you gotta love what Chimasuku Jackson is doing. That was a really nice work here. This is London graduates, a collection of London graduates. I thought we could look at this, and I just thought it was interesting.
00:54:37.370 - 00:55:04.784, Speaker A: I thought that was pretty cool. So they often have their show, I guess. I don't know if it's the time of year when they do it, but here, just, you know, just to see what the London graduates are doing. Contemporary artists. And so there it is. Just a nice little slideshow for us from Instagram on what young artists are up to these days. So very interesting there.
00:55:04.784 - 00:55:36.848, Speaker A: And Quila Nina, acrylic and oil painting kali. So this was an interesting combination of the tarot death card and a hindu goddess of time and destruction, who is called kali. So interesting combination. And that was burned, so I'm not sure, maybe there's a new version of it. And continuing on, of course, this is Yoao Salazar with a new work reserve 0.33, a new plasticine work. Again, playing with a lot of kind of office iconography and imagery.
00:55:36.848 - 00:55:57.528, Speaker A: You gotta love how this is just leaking out and the hearts, the twitter flying away and everything. Just more beautiful work from yo ao. Such an original artist. Look at how the plasticine, like, even working the gradients into the plasticine, it's brilliant, brilliant work. I just love it. And that's your show, everyone. Thank you for joining me.
00:55:57.528 - 00:55:59.664, Speaker A: And until next time, take care. It.
