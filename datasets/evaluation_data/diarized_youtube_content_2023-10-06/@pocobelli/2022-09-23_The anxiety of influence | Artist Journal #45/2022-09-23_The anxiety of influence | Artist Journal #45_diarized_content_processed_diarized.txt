00:00:09.680 - 00:00:51.894, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 23, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokabelli, your artist reporter with our one of a kind show. It feels like a one of a kind show. I imagine there are something like this out there, but it's kind of interesting. So it's great to have you all on. I mean, it's 141 subscribers, so it's so small. And I am loving every minute of the smallness, but it is a great community.
00:00:51.894 - 00:01:19.466, Speaker A: So let me actually, very quickly, as I like to do, let me just touch on that quickly and give a shout out to Bubba boo Bubba, who has been watching every morning since episode three. Great work, my friend. Well, thank you. Without viewers like you, we wouldn't be around. I mean, maybe I would have kept doing it. You know, I actually told a friend, even if there's zero viewers, I'm doing this. So let's see.
00:01:19.466 - 00:01:42.358, Speaker A: I don't know if I wouldn't do it, but it definitely encourages you, especially on day 50 or whatever it is here. I also here. Very nice. Another meta work by Minta. And so the program is starting to get meta. Everything is going meta. We see the program here, artist journal program with it's all getting meta.
00:01:42.358 - 00:02:07.234, Speaker A: So purple Drank's image on Twitter has been rendered by another one of a kind screenshot artist, Minta, who is a master of meta. So thank you, Minta available. She sent me one. You can still get them for two. There have been sales. So let me look. Wow, look at this.
00:02:07.234 - 00:02:41.554, Speaker A: Look at this. Ah, so anyways, so thank you. I don't want to take too long on this. And also, just in our quick notes here, before we really get started, purple Drank has another episode or another piece in his Savage Sword of Pepe series. Another awesome piece you can get on manifold, Savage sword three. And just go here and connect your metamask and get your free token. And it is open to claim to anybody who has previously claimed piece one or two.
00:02:41.554 - 00:03:08.034, Speaker A: So let's get to the show. This work just kept on calling me this morning as I was kind of looking over everything. It's. And I. Maybe it's just really simple. Maybe it's kind of the Warhol evocation, like it looks like, you know, screen princess by LB, by the way, and it is called Love in frames. LB always has really good titles.
00:03:08.034 - 00:03:54.408, Speaker A: I, and I love a good title. You know, back in the day, I used to come up with titles first, and then I would try and make paintings, oil paintings, that did justice to the titles. So I'm a big fan of titles that I learned later that's kind of a losing strategy, because, yeah, you can spend a long time, and it's much more difficult, let's put it that way. Anyway, so awesome work by lb here with some roses. What I like about it is, to me, it has Warhol written all over it, but without it being clearly Warhol in the way that, you know, he might screen print across the same image. Here we get three different roses. I just find this to be so beautiful, so simple, and in his albee's trademark style.
00:03:54.408 - 00:04:08.754, Speaker A: So I decided to start with that edition of ten. Only two are gone. I'm going to pick one up right away here. And this was also side hustle is back. Really interesting. Cube house. Cube houses series.
00:04:08.754 - 00:04:38.714, Speaker A: Let me just bring up the. So there's two of them, both released yesterday. And I just thought they're really nice. I just think they're really interesting pixelworks. I like Ceres. I think my favorite part, ironically, maybe, is the ground where you see it's just these square cubes done as basically maybe lawn or whatever it is, you know, sidewalk, whatever. And, you know, I didn't even really notice it till now.
00:04:38.714 - 00:05:24.990, Speaker A: And this is a bit of a stretch. And again, like, the weird perspective, but it almost looks like a palazzo. Like, if you go to Italy and you go to Florence or you go to Rome, maybe one of the weird things you learn about old palaces, old Renaissance palaces, is that they're kind of just these huge rectangles, these huge squares and rectangles. This looks like a palazzo. So who knows if that was what side hustle intended? But very cool. And another thing I want to point out, which is this very simple use of blue, red, and green. Kind of this, like, almost like CMyK type rgb.
00:05:24.990 - 00:05:49.556, Speaker A: Red, green, blue, and white. And then, okay, that changes here. But very. Again, kind of conceptually interesting. Like, what that evokes for me very quickly, is the Mona Lisa by Warhol. Let's see if we get the one, because it's actually so beautiful. And I didn't really notice this till kind of after admiring this piece for a long time.
00:05:49.556 - 00:06:15.230, Speaker A: Do you notice Cmyk? So conceptually interesting. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work. And that actually goes with our lb really nicely, doesn't it? So. Right, Cmyk. And so, again, little decisions like that, rather than just any colors, kind of makes things conceptually even more interesting. Let's look at the other one really quickly. So this was the first one of the cube houses.
00:06:15.230 - 00:06:34.154, Speaker A: I didn't pick either of these up. I kind of wish I had. They're gone now. And you almost see like an old video game type bricks here. These are done on an old graphics program. So what is it? Graphics two, it's called. So back to these retro tools, which is almost a genre in itself.
00:06:34.154 - 00:07:05.374, Speaker A: There's retro image iconography which you'll see in like Adelia, like yesterday with that alarm clock, digital alarm clock. But here we also have retro tools which is a whole other thing. So also just an interesting little development here. Myth put out this tweet. First experiment, myth Labs. Will there be merch? He's got the trademark green and pink, the myth. So pretty interesting.
00:07:05.374 - 00:07:35.876, Speaker A: And this is a tweet from a couple of days ago that I wanted to bring up that I thought was just really interesting from Joe Rogan's dad, which fits perfectly with the merch, which is the myth is probably one of the greatest characters ever conceived on the blockchain. It is more than an idea. It is a brand. So two days later we have, you know, action. We have action on that. So very interesting. Jordy Gandul is someone we haven't looked at.
00:07:35.876 - 00:08:00.660, Speaker A: This was a new piece having issues with rendering here. Here we go. And yeah, so Jordy does kind of these cities I think are just worth touching on here. This was done in collaboration with underground. I was on a Twitter spaces last week. Who was it? Art to act. I think they do a weekly Twitter spaces because I saw them do another one and underground was on it.
00:08:00.660 - 00:08:16.362, Speaker A: Seems like a nice team there. And they put out underground membership drops. So kind of interesting. Here was another one. Let's see if it loads up nicely. So just kind of interesting works here. He's definitely got his style.
00:08:16.362 - 00:08:42.162, Speaker A: Pretty cool. Summer's end indeed. I miss, I miss Summer enormously. It was one of the funnest summers I've ever had. And quick advice that I've learned this summer with a big takeaway. My girlfriend says, you keep saying this, but the key I think to having a great summer is to go away in May, late May, early June. So your summer starts early.
00:08:42.162 - 00:09:12.614, Speaker A: Go somewhere warm. We went to Spain and I don't really have the cash because I'm buying too many tezos. NFTs bought too many myths. But if I had cash then I'd go away in October. And your summer gets stretched out like six months. So quick little tidbit because it really elongated the summer in a way that I've never experienced. So go away early and go away late and maybe you do something in between if you can afford all those vacations in Europe, we can travel cheap here.
00:09:12.614 - 00:09:33.682, Speaker A: Very interesting work here. A new artist I've never heard of before, atelier 407. Let's just quickly look. So I almost want, like, here. You almost start to see a Lewis Osborne kind of vibe. When did this come out? August 9. So especially in this eye here.
00:09:33.682 - 00:09:57.702, Speaker A: Really nicely done here. Yeah. So again, like I always say, we're consuming more art then probably, like, let me put it this way. We're consuming an astonishing amount of art on a daily basis here. So the influence is going back and forth. We're also going to see it later in the AI, how that is influencing. So all to say, I think it's all good.
00:09:57.702 - 00:10:14.534, Speaker A: It's all good. And so, Atelier 407. Really nice piece. And I think just a nice, simple abstraction. And this doesn't remind me of Louis Osborne at all. So, you know, totally their own thing. So, 5.99.
00:10:14.534 - 00:10:29.606, Speaker A: Did it sell out? Yeah, it went for three. Lewis Oz. First buyer. So there you go. There you go. He approves. So anyway, just another guy to have on your radar.
00:10:29.606 - 00:11:04.882, Speaker A: Pretty nice work, you know, and still, like, relatively cheap for small editions. Pretty nice. You can put it in the same room, the museum, in your mind. What else do we have here? A new work by Ravilsky Tez, which I like to add, because these psychedelic works, which is almost a genre unto itself, these are some of the first works I came across and started collecting when I got to Tezos. So I always kind of like to follow those people that I find early on. So, Revilsky art. Let's just quickly look and.
00:11:04.882 - 00:11:30.602, Speaker A: Yeah, you'll see. Kind of like this. Remember zap comics? Probably Bubba Boo might remember from a previous episode. We looked at zap comics, and this has kind of zap comics written all over it. So that's, which is an underground comic from the 1960s. Robert Crumb, probably the most, easily the most famous underground comics artist. C O M I X, underground comics artist, was a major player.
00:11:30.602 - 00:11:54.470, Speaker A: This is kind of interesting, too. This is by Daniel Wilson, who put out a great mushroom series of prints. And he put out this one yesterday. And I saw two things when I saw this. First I saw that Goya, right, with Saturn devouring his son, which I looked up here before I started. That's how I knew the title right off the top of my head. So there was that.
00:11:54.470 - 00:12:20.554, Speaker A: And then I thought of, like, this kind of looks like maybe it's hell. And in Dante's Inferno, at the end, when you meet Satan, he's three faced. He has three faces, which is kind of interesting. You may not know that. And I saw the three faces here and kind of what looks like a hellish landscape. So let's look at the title to face the beast. And the beast, of course, is another word for the devil.
00:12:20.554 - 00:12:48.472, Speaker A: Oh, what a marvel it appeared to me when I beheld three faces on his head. That is Dante. I didn't see that, but I'll show you. So first of all, we have William Blake depicting Dante's Satan, which I brought up here. So the three heads, very similar. Look. See the wings and the three heads? The wings and the three heads and look even devouring.
00:12:48.472 - 00:13:36.454, Speaker A: So maybe this isn't so much like the Goya, which I brought up here of Saturn devouring his sons. This is a play on William Blake, who is doing a play off of Dante. So this episode, I think, clearly is about influence. The, you know, TS Eliot wrote an essay about the anxiety of influence. And when you're an artist, and he was a poet, of course. But when you're an artist, you're always kind of struggling between your influences and your originality and where these two things meet. Now, another take on this is I love it when I see influence, particularly from the tradition, as I said in that interview with Culture three and Georgie Miller, to be a part of the tradition, in my view, you kind of have to have a conversation with the tradition.
00:13:36.454 - 00:14:19.824, Speaker A: So when newer works reference older works. And here we're getting, you know, Daniel W. Is referencing, I would say probably Blake and Dante. And then Blake is, you know, doing a image of Dante, you start to, to me, that starts to be like, and I don't want to overstate this whole museum work thing, but then it's like nobody can kind of mess with you when you start doing that. Like, people can say what they want, but it's kind of like you're kind of putting. You're having a conversation with the tradition, and nobody can take that away from you. Okay? Like, it's kind of a way of insulating yourself somewhat from.
00:14:19.824 - 00:14:54.278, Speaker A: It's not that people can't criticize you. They can still say, oh, good or bad, but that's, you know, like, it really helps kind of give you credibility. And people can make fun of you all they want, but you have that credibility of being a part and kind of referencing the tradition. So even if the world forgets about you and ignores you, 200 years from now, someone's going to look at that Daniel W. And go, oh, that's kind of like Blake's so and so. And it becomes important it gives it credibility, I would argue. Feel free to disagree.
00:14:54.278 - 00:15:25.954, Speaker A: Leave a comment under the video. So, continuing on, I just want to remember w o c of the dollar bill. No photoshop. So I'm not sure. These might be done with just spray paint. These may be actually his nfts, maybe actually just be photos of physical works. And it's interesting, that ambiguity, but it seems so amazing is this no photoshop? Because that really looks like a digital work.
00:15:25.954 - 00:16:00.758, Speaker A: W o c might be doing both, which I would find incredibly interesting, because then I think he might be doing both. That is interesting. So just kind of tackling the same problem from a digital angle and a physical angle. So anyways, I just saw this tweet here and I thought, oh, because I was saying, oh, is that just the gaussian blur? New work by Dancontrol Danctrl, a controller. And this is joypad. I used to play that console a lot along with that. Now this joypad is for sure a rare relic.
00:16:00.758 - 00:16:12.558, Speaker A: So edition of ten. Not many left. About three left, I think. So these are going fast. And a new work by slava. Angle. Damaged broadcast.
00:16:12.558 - 00:16:51.298, Speaker A: Let me just maximize this. Yeah, I think we've touched on his work before, and I always like touching on his work because, I mean, it's kind of like this, on and off, like one bit, kind of bitmap kind of work with kind of maybe a retro screen filter, for lack of better term. And I like these, kind of like, you see the floor here turn into a grid. Here we go. Right? And so I brought up a couple other works, I'm pretty sure, actually I brought up this work before. This is one of my all time favorite nfts. If I had like one show when it was just going to be showing a whole bunch of NFts, this one's really cool.
00:16:51.298 - 00:17:04.934, Speaker A: Like, I just love it. I just think it's so cool. So I always like to, I think I've shown it before. Show it again. Yeah, one of my favorites. And here are just a couple others. I don't think we looked at these.
00:17:04.934 - 00:17:38.214, Speaker A: So just a couple of retro computers. You see one bit zone and it uses other old technology, like this microscope here, combining with plants. So again, just very cool. Another old computer looks like an old Commodore 64 one bit zone, you know, three and a half inch disks at the bottom here, old remote control, again with a plant and then some sort of skull in there, grid in the background. Just really cool work. And this was, I wish I'd picked this up when it was cheap. I could have just kind of cool.
00:17:38.214 - 00:17:56.358, Speaker A: Another cool work. Open a door to information. Let's look at the title on that entrance door. Come in. You are expected. Okay. Moving on back to Joe Rogan's dad, Joaquin Linquiman, did a tribute to the great collector and artist Joe Rogan's dad.
00:17:56.358 - 00:18:08.516, Speaker A: Really nice. Looks like a collage of some kind. Really nice. I think this is just a great work. I believe it's a one of one. And it went to Joe Rogan's dad. And straight to the basement with that one.
00:18:08.516 - 00:18:35.164, Speaker A: Really nice piece. And Joe Rogan's dad did a piece. And we're back to the anxiety of influence, right? Because when I see this, I think, oh, strange thing. But, I mean, I don't think people shouldn't do that. And who knows? He might be just. This might just be the software, right? I haven't cracked the code yet. Like, in a sense, I'm still trying to kind of get these things going, but I've just been using.
00:18:35.164 - 00:18:59.390, Speaker A: What is it called? The discord bot. I was using it last night. I went for a beer and visited my friend who runs a bar in Mitta Zedbar, if you're ever in Berlin, Constantine. And, you know he's working. So half the time I was using mid journey and just trying to crack the code. But I'm gonna try Dali this weekend. So, anyways, cool work.
00:18:59.390 - 00:19:33.018, Speaker A: You see in the, you see Mike Tyson sleight of hand. It looks like the Mike Tyson tattoo that you'd see in the myth. A lot of symbolism going on. So edition of 150 Tez, another wasteman, Goldman. So again, we see in this style of strange thing for those who haven't seen strange thing. I brought it up, and I'll go back to Wasteman's work in a second here. Some people were saying that they were actually getting rid of this piece because too many notifications.
00:19:33.018 - 00:19:53.134, Speaker A: I'd say just send it to another wallet. I would send it to a second wallet because, yeah, we're getting a ton of notifications. For me, it's not the end of the world, but I understand. I'll probably send it to another wallet. So that's just a really easy solution then you don't need to worry about it. You should probably have two or three wallets anyway. So you see the influence here.
00:19:53.134 - 00:20:28.100, Speaker A: I would say a strange thing again, but really interesting to see how other people kind of work their way into AI, because I have to admit, I was trying to do the same thing. I'm like Vermeer, Nike guy with nothing close to those results. I'm going to try daly too, though. So I'm curious if I can start to hack that a little bit. But look at the masterpiece. Continues to be the masterpiece here. So let's see a couple other, just quickly, zero zero nine doing a couple other AI works.
00:20:28.100 - 00:20:53.554, Speaker A: And what is this called missed connection. Again, there's almost like this archetypal feel to zero zero nine's work of this blobby thing taking over a city. It's got that kind of Sci-Fi or almost the earth freezing over. Here's another one. Triple zero nine at one. Again, pretty strong market. Accepts offer for 20.
00:20:53.554 - 00:21:17.184, Speaker A: So very strong market for these blob, for lack of better term, blobworks, it's called. Defaced the series here. And you can see others as well. Wow. 500 is what that's selling for, 64. Another what I suspect is AI. Another very nice work by Hannibal.
00:21:17.184 - 00:21:42.326, Speaker A: What is the name of this? The anonymous performance artist. So this is great. Again, kind of, I want to call it in this german expressionist style. Again, this is like, again, this is reflecting the art on itself. And this is again what I want to see in physical contemporary art galleries. And I'd go, oh, okay. Like, that's pretty exciting and nothing against them.
00:21:42.326 - 00:22:08.230, Speaker A: And I find nice works in contemporary art galleries all the time. I'm just saying, like, this is competing quite healthily. And finally, just a thank you, I finally put one up for sale here of the eight Bidoo works. And thank you for all the retweets actually, on my super rare work, I finally minted, you know, quick thing on that. That was $9. That was $9. Now, it wasn't at the quiet time, but I was thinking this is gonna be like $0.50
00:22:08.230 - 00:22:40.474, Speaker A: with the new Ethereum, it was still $9 to mint on super rare. So I would say like tezos, even phantom, you're not out of the running yet by any stretch. From a blockchain perspective, from a tech perspective. So anyways, thank you, Poly Jojo, who has been a bit of a patron here. So thank you, Poly Jojo, for picking one up. And this anonymous collector here, thank you for picking up sunset. I might burn some.
00:22:40.474 - 00:22:51.594, Speaker A: So let's see. I just thought I'd see how these did. I'm very proud of this. And I think that's it. So, until next time, thanks for joining me. Until next time. Take care.
