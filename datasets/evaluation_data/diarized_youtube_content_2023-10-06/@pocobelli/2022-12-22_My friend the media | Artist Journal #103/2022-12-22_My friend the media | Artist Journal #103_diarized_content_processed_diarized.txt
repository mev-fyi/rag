00:00:08.800 - 00:00:39.582, Speaker A: Back again. It's only been about, what, 16 hours. Artists journal, December 22, 2022. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Thank you, everybody for yesterday for coming to the Twitter spaces. Attendance was pretty remarkable. 180 people showed up to that.
00:00:39.582 - 00:01:30.546, Speaker A: And, you know, for an experimental spaces, I mean, really, like, I was basically reading up in the, you know, I was preparing as much as I could, but nothing really prepares you for being live. So anyways, thank you, everybody who got on stage and everybody who just showed up, which was totally awesome. It's actually pretty exciting. I mean, in some respects. You know, if I was a viewer of this program, I might be slightly disappointed that it's like, okay, Wednesday. I don't get the visuals in a sense, but I think overall, I think all the artists who watch this program and frankly, anybody else, it's totally awesome what can happen here. And again, that was kind of like an open lines type, you know, where people call in.
00:01:30.546 - 00:02:24.194, Speaker A: You know, I grew up on a lot of talk radio, as maybe you've probably figured out by now, and my friend the media is actually what I call it, my friend the media. You know, when I was in Montreal and after I had broken up with my girlfriend and I was just kind of on my own there, my friend the media. And so I have a deep, you know, sentimental attachment to this sort of stuff. Anyways, we have a ton to get through today, but let me just finish on the show. So it's going to continue the weekly partly, and don't tweet this part out just because let's wait till it's actually done. But rug radio is going to basically, it's going to go under the rug radio guys on Spotify. And so it's going to be a whole new audience, really, for this scene here as far as what, you know, whatever audience I'm building here.
00:02:24.194 - 00:03:23.240, Speaker A: But it's going to be. So there's a huge opportunity for you as an artist, should this grow? And nobody knows the future and who knows what happens, but should it grow, it's like a whole other venue and potentially a greater audience in the sense that rug radio has a lot of the Ethereum community. And so as an artist, it's totally worth it for you to start, in a sense, to, and it helps me too, to get on stage, really, and to talk because people will check you out. We got a few subscribers yesterday. It's actually great for this show as well. So again, multimedia here, even in terms of this show, we're going multimedia. And like, how cool is that, having a weekly kind of thing on Spotify, under the rug radio kind of banner, at least syndicated on rug radio.
00:03:23.240 - 00:03:37.480, Speaker A: So. And that could present all sorts of interesting opportunities here. I don't believe they have a tazo show. That's what they were telling me. I was talking to the executive producer yesterday. I think he was executive producer. So anyways, don't tweet that out, though, any of the rug radio stuff.
00:03:37.480 - 00:04:09.238, Speaker A: Just kind of a heads up, though, that things could get pretty exciting on that front. And it's really just the final couple of comments on that is I'm going to structure it a bit more. Like, again, that was kind of an open line. So let's see what happened and let's see what happens. And so it's going to be. I'm going to try and make it more thematic where you can almost think of the theme beforehand. That'll go in the little title of the Twitter spaces thing when I post that maybe on a Monday or Tuesday for the Wednesday show, Twitter Spaces.
00:04:09.238 - 00:04:35.502, Speaker A: And also the co host, the mystery co host, actually got a hold of me afterwards and was like, yeah, sorry, I've been off Twitter, but I'm down for next week, so let's see what happens. Hopefully mystery co host is in on that. So anyways, thank you again for everybody that showed up to that. It was a ton of fun. And for an experimental thing, I felt like it went quite well. And again, yeah, that was great. So here we are.
00:04:35.502 - 00:04:55.134, Speaker A: There is an absolute ton to get through today. This is Sabato's work here from his drawing exercises. And shout out to Sabato for showing up on the Twitter spaces there, too. I mean, it's pretty cool, guys. It's an opportunity to have conversations. We learn about the people, all the things he's doing. He's been in the space forever.
00:04:55.134 - 00:05:34.774, Speaker A: So, you know, a true salon, you know, and I'm not really into this idea of, you know, finally, I'm not really into this idea of like, oh, let's book a guest, and then we listen to a guest for an hour or whatever it doesn't like. I don't think we need to do that. To me, the audience is the guest and it's just open. Whoever shows up, frankly, should have priority on the mic is kind of my. And whoever shows initiative to want, like, you know, I'm trying to be as inclusive as possible and we got incredible insights there. Remember Shasha, who is a collector? And I'm not going to be like, oh, booking that. I would have never thought of that.
00:05:34.774 - 00:06:03.106, Speaker A: And there he came on stage and he was dropping some serious insight of someone who's collected physical art and, you know, and just, you know, singing the praises of, you know, art on the blockchain and someone who's been in NFTs for. Since 2017 and only has been talking about, been collecting art for the last year. And he's very excited about it. So anyways, so here's Sabato's work. Part of the Tez trash event. Beautiful work. The colors are very nice.
00:06:03.106 - 00:06:20.974, Speaker A: Again, part of the drawing exercise is where he uses the Deluxe Amiga. What does he call it? It's an emulator created in deluxe paint. Four on an amiga, a 1200 computer. You can still get it. 2.2 tazos, which these days is a song. Part of the sabato's holiday drops.
00:06:20.974 - 00:06:46.944, Speaker A: So before we look at some more works, just a couple of tweets that I saw that were kind of just interesting. 2022. This from PNX was like a decade for me. Ups and downs. I started and finished my year with COVID and had one serious surgery. Love is really important. I've met great people and made new friends and it's the time of year where tweets like this, you know, I'm happy to highlight that.
00:06:46.944 - 00:07:44.630, Speaker A: And that's kind of how I felt yesterday. And just overall, this space, particularly the NFT art space, which Shasha really kind of segmented it off as kind of being its own thing, which he's probably right. Like, he seemed like a pretty big crypto expert, someone who dealt a lot with that. And. Yeah, so we've made a lot of new friends this year, so shout out to everyone on that front and just kind of a reminder to be appreciative. And I guess if I have a Christmas message, it's to show leadership in your family and, you know, and just in positive, you know, just with the positive vibe and just, you know, be the better person if ever that becomes an issue for you. A lot of people that I talk to, family, it's a tricky thing for a lot of people at Christmas, and that's my Christmas message, is show some, in a sense, moral leadership and be the, you know, and be forgiving and all that sort of thing.
00:07:44.630 - 00:08:15.190, Speaker A: I'm not christian, but it's a nice message. Interesting work from Mech TXT. So we're going to look at this a little closer. But what I'm finding very fascinating is this box here. This box he's starting to put into his compositions and shout out to mech TXT for also appearing on the program yesterday from Indonesia. And that's something I never mentioned. I put it out in a tweet from all around the world, uzbekistan to Uruguay to.
00:08:15.190 - 00:08:38.716, Speaker A: I'm in Europe here to Massachusetts, as I said in my tweet there to Singapore, where shasha was so pretty fascinating. Anyways, so out of Indonesia. Mech. Txt so great to hear from people. I'm loving the box here. Very interesting to see how this develops. And this is actually what I wanted to highlight here, recent explorations.
00:08:38.716 - 00:09:21.016, Speaker A: I'm beginning to feel more confident in calling myself an artist, albeit a part timer, but still inherently one. Well, I wouldn't let that stop you. I think like 99% of the space is not, you know, relying on art to pay their bills and it's probably a little bit less stressful of a life. So really it's about productivity. And like, I feel like I'm an artist when I'm making art, you know, that's when I feel like I'm an artist. When I'm, if I'm working 8 hours a day or 6 hours a day and constantly producing, that's when I feel like an artist. Okay, so to me, you're an artist when you're being an artist, okay? And you are very productive here.
00:09:21.016 - 00:09:55.014, Speaker A: Mech. Txt so I wouldn't hesitate. A lot of people hesitate calling themselves an artist. I never have. I've kind of always been like, I've always kind of known, at least in my own mind, people can make their own judgments. Quick, just FYI on a artist call AI art open call post photography glimpses and this is from ivona Tao looking for AI artists. I've just been invited to join Nifty Gateway as a publisher, and I'd like to showcase selected established and emerging artists working with all kinds of tools.
00:09:55.014 - 00:10:26.032, Speaker A: So anyways, deadline 26 December shout FYI Charles AI, this is super interesting. Printed one of my AI pieces for the first time. Just loved the result. I'd love to see it hand signed print for the collector of my ninfa Genesis piece in January. Like, this is really cool. I would love to see that too. Again, it's like traveling through the mediums crossing over.
00:10:26.032 - 00:11:07.076, Speaker A: Then it's, you know, if artists were threatened before, like those, let's say, that aren't on artstation, kind of, I think has an argument to make for itself somewhat. I still think people should be able to sample and whatever. It's a complicated issue. But as far as the traditional art scene and who hasn't got into AI that might be those who are still skeptical and maybe the haters out there. You start, you're really infringing on their territory. Once you start making prints of your AI work that's going to hang beside them in the gallery and perhaps might even be selling better, then you're really going to be stepping on some toes really interesting. You know what else kind of crossed my mind when I saw it? It made me want to make AI work.
00:11:07.076 - 00:11:37.754, Speaker A: I'm like, yeah, because I want to print it out. Like, that would be super cool. So I'm still fascinated by this raw AI thing. You can't do everything here, but it's definitely got my attention. And it continues to be some of the source of some of our most interesting images that I think we see on a daily basis here, some of the most novel images. So here's an artist that I feel like I should have known and maybe I've seen their work before, but I just don't know. Rip cash.
00:11:37.754 - 00:12:03.578, Speaker A: So GVG ETH posted this cerberus, one of one by the insanely talented rip cache. And so here. So this guy, rip cash, works a lot with surveillance cameras. And I did a little bit of looking here. I was pretty amazed. So this work here, it already has an offer of 13 ETH. So all to say, like, this person has kind of taken off.
00:12:03.578 - 00:12:23.862, Speaker A: Okay. And you look at their floor, I think I. So on Opensea, their floor price is 112 ETH. So you can see here kind of like, it's almost like one bit necro. I wouldn't say, I was gonna say meets oxy. Not quite, but one bit necro meets the surveillance camera. Right.
00:12:23.862 - 00:13:04.756, Speaker A: So pretty amazing. And I think what happened, I think this is what happened. So I went to rip Cash's feed and I think it's the X copy. Back to social proof. And the power of getting that seal of approval from someone who has basically looked up to or getting several people saying, this is good. Again, social proof, one of the most powerful forms of, frankly, for lack of better term marketing that exists. Again, we all have that experience on Amazon where you look at the product, you're not sure, you read insanely good five star reviews, and you have to have it, you know, that is social proof.
00:13:04.756 - 00:13:29.088, Speaker A: Huge shout out to legend x copyart. Congrats on your winning bid and on acquiring my latest one of one platform. So maybe that's what happened to Ripcash. I don't know his or her story, but maybe he got the x, the blessing from x copy. And like Axein has done spectacularly. And we're gonna see that. So Axin has a new work on super rare.
00:13:29.088 - 00:13:51.364, Speaker A: It has already been bid on. I think he put a one ETH reserve, which was taken up right away. And now it's at 1.5 ETH, which is $1,800. And so here is the work. And it's pretty interesting what's going on. A great contrast between kind of like this, again, traditional painting treatment.
00:13:51.364 - 00:14:26.222, Speaker A: Very nice work here, very nice brushwork all along. So kind of a traditional painting treatment with a super hard contrast with these hourglass, kind of digital animated hourglasses that are flashing as well as the skull and the skull in the old retro Mac top. And also, I mean, this kind of nice detritus here. Again, a nice irrational element. And when you look up close to the background, you can see it's like a painted background. It's not a flat background. So anyways, it's looking great, as usual, from Ukscene.
00:14:26.222 - 00:14:38.038, Speaker A: Very nice. Just everything. So, two fiends. A cool title too. I thought we could. I'll just show you. In case you haven't been to Ukscene's page recently, there's a lot going down.
00:14:38.038 - 00:15:13.356, Speaker A: Like this is just the last 24 hours, and selling, you know, editions of 33 here for 45. And when you take some of his more, this is an edition of 50 sold for 50 tezos. And when you go to some of his more, you know, the ones with the monks in them, you know, edition of eleven sold on secondary for 189. This is just in the last day, 115. Look at this. This beautiful one that we're looking at, 155. And now, like, if you go to his page, like, if you just want to buy it straight off secondary without putting offers in, look at that.
00:15:13.356 - 00:15:36.454, Speaker A: 666 222 250 with an offer of 100. So it's a wonderful thing to see. This, frankly, looks cheap. This is one of my favorite axings. 155,000 for this one. Wow. So anyways, I mean, again, the offers are the better measure, but the prices do say something here at 1420.
00:15:36.454 - 00:16:06.526, Speaker A: This one was spectacular. I kind of wish I had about 2 seconds to pick up a one of one with the dog, this one here. And I hesitated for about a minute and then it was gone. So, yeah, one of one UK scene now is worth at least a minimum of thousand tezos, I would think maybe more. But anyways, anyways, it's great to see. Here's another artist that kind of reminded me of axin a little bit. Bongdo.
00:16:06.526 - 00:16:30.258, Speaker A: I saw it on Twitter. So this is kind of interesting, you know, almost some similar stuff going on. Kind of dark, flashing kind of images. This one's moving a bit more. So this is 50 tezos on object Bongdo. And it's interesting. So I looked at the other work, and I thought, okay, this is kind of, you know, doesn't look exactly like this kind of dark.
00:16:30.258 - 00:16:54.328, Speaker A: Put it this way. This other work doesn't remind me of euxine, whereas this one does. And it's darkness and everything. This is more animated. But when you go over to the foundation, you start seeing this style again. And you could see this doing well. Looks like it was sent over to Eldover.
00:16:54.328 - 00:17:15.162, Speaker A: So maybe a private sale, but you start to see. So, anyways, interesting. You could hang them in the same show, couldn't you? And let's just see if there's. And you got a pepe there, giving you a wink. And here's another one. And our mic is still working. And so anyway, some computer code.
00:17:15.162 - 00:17:32.590, Speaker A: You see kind of a similar kind of ingredients here. Not super similar, but you get the same. Last sold for 275 ETH. So interesting. Bongdo minted on December 20, just a couple of days ago. And here's another one on nifty gateway. And this opens.
00:17:32.590 - 00:17:55.594, Speaker A: It's $50 each. And this opens in a few hours here. So, anyways, just interesting to see what's going on out there. Interesting similarities. I thought this kind of went with our skulls that we were seeing here. So we've seen this artist before and often uses. Let me just load up their page.
00:17:55.594 - 00:18:23.948, Speaker A: The mic is playing nicely. So often has these kind of skeletons dancing. Now, this seems to be a play off of Matisse's dance, of course, but this time with skeletons and kind of on fire. Beautiful colors, you know, even this orange skeleton, they're beautifully done. It seems like this person knows their anatomy somewhat because they seem quite comfortable here. It doesn't look like they're, you know, they're just putting. I guess it's not too complicated, the skeleton, but it's complicated enough.
00:18:23.948 - 00:18:48.376, Speaker A: Anyways, it looks great. Only two tazos, a tribute to Henri Matisse's la dance from 1909. And so with a reinterpretation. And so, of course, we've seen who's the artist? Jan Lucas Migone's work before. So a little update here. Elie Lowe with a new work, the fool. So with the character in.
00:18:48.376 - 00:19:13.994, Speaker A: And let's just take a quick look here. So kind of a trash artist. You see trash bag here. So we're gonna go into. We're gonna go into tez trash. So. So anyways, just interesting.
00:19:13.994 - 00:19:31.060, Speaker A: $0.50 from Ellie Lowe. Trash star, trash bag. So anyways, who knows? So Robnis V two often credited. I think he is the guy who invented the trash art thing. I think it says that on his page, actually. Trash art movement creator.
00:19:31.060 - 00:20:01.884, Speaker A: Okay, if you didn't know. So he has some works here that he put out as part of this Tez trash event. So he's taking a JPeG icon and basically creating these psychedelic, you know, kaleidoscopic colors with JPEG icons that he's kind of distorting here. Interesting kind of brush work over here. So he has four of these for 0.01 tez. So basically free.
00:20:01.884 - 00:20:21.076, Speaker A: So if you want some robnus v two, it is not cheap to get. I picked these up. I mean, how can you not? I mean that's basically two cent these days. Not even each. So anyway, part of the Tez trash art event. My, there we go. We're getting a straight up.
00:20:21.076 - 00:20:56.458, Speaker A: So anyways, interesting work. Always interesting from Robnis over there and who always has a very active and engaged Twitter feed. So anyways, a little glitchy on my side here, but you can get the picture here. So four of those, I thought this one, Shilly Preston. I mean, it seems to be kind of a play on Liechtenstein, but it kind of has its own vibe, like it doesn't feel like too much of one. I assume it was like an AI work of some kind. I think it really turned out well again.
00:20:56.458 - 00:21:12.300, Speaker A: So a big dumpster fire. This one really just, you know, it's kind of like on that reptilian level, it captured me right away. $0.50 edition of 100. See how well it's selling. So 39 are gone. I even like how the Bend Aid dots here get kind of screwed up.
00:21:12.300 - 00:21:31.546, Speaker A: I assume that's the AI. A really nice work. And he did another one, raw AI made for test trash. So almost a similar, like dumpster here, right? But totally different style. Working with AI again. Again, a pretty nice work. Made for tez trash.
00:21:31.546 - 00:21:58.894, Speaker A: 2022 edition of one sold for five to Danielle Jerome. So interesting. Here's another one by punks distorted. And you can buy these for one, an addition of 1000. Let's see if I can get so kind of a Petsky filter situation here over a trash recycling or trash can or trash bin. So interesting. Punks distorted.
00:21:58.894 - 00:22:11.578, Speaker A: Here was a nice one. I thought I was. So I clicked on the tez trash hashtag. So, you know. So hashtags are useful on object by the way. And I was just going through everything. There's an interesting one.
00:22:11.578 - 00:22:40.842, Speaker A: So you can just go through the whole tez trash, you know, situation and you can just see what people are posting. There's a ton of AI, which is interesting probably because AI is so quick to make. This is AI. And I thought this was just a beautiful painting. Let me just expand this. So anyways, I thought quite beautiful here. And what is this? I think this is a one of one for 144.
00:22:40.842 - 00:23:22.394, Speaker A: I might have to pick that up. Let me just bookmark that bookmark tool is very useful. So a nice, very nice AI piece there. Daniel W. Chimes in with a trash can in a gallery, and again with his kind of what I'm increasingly finding to just wanting to call, like, radical compositions. This might not seem that radical, but again, just these decisions, like, cutting off the paintings like this, I think it's put it this way, this isn't, like, careless. This is very thoughtful how this is being done, and careful and even again, just putting, like, the plug in here, the trash bin.
00:23:22.394 - 00:23:49.794, Speaker A: And again, the CMYk, I think, although this is green, so maybe not pure CmYk. I guess it is CmYk layered here on the green. This maybe looks like a Frida Kahlo and Edward monks. The scream. So anyways, very interesting trash work from Daniel W. And he has got another work that I wanted us to look at, Judith and her maidservant. So, of course, this is based on a.
00:23:49.794 - 00:24:16.126, Speaker A: I think it's Renaissance. We'll look in a second here. This is based on a previous painting, and it's by a woman artist from the Renaissance. And sorry for all the minimize. I have to do the magnify tool to make things full screen here. So this is from Judith and her maid servant by italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi. And this is in the Palazzo Pitti in Florence.
00:24:16.126 - 00:24:30.270, Speaker A: Okay. So I brought it up here just so we could compare. So here it is. I believe it's this one. So you see the sword here. And you see the sword here. So it's likely this one.
00:24:30.270 - 00:24:51.072, Speaker A: But you see how the heads are apart. And here they're actually quite close together. But we go to this one, and the heads are apart a little bit, but this is a different artist. So anyways, I'm sure it's this one by Gentileschi, Florence. So anyways, here you go. There you go. So what I like about this is it's a liberal interpretation.
00:24:51.072 - 00:25:21.874, Speaker A: It's not like he's just tracing this here, which is something I might do. Anyways, but it shows like, there's creativity and it truly is an interpretation where he's even, you know, switching the composition a little bit. So very cool. Also kind of in a, you know, again, this stuff could hang in a similar room. This is by, I think, edge Q is the name. I picked this up in an auction for just ten tazos, which is like $7 these days. Keith Haring, the game by Keith Haring.
00:25:21.874 - 00:26:04.240, Speaker A: So again, I'm a big fan of this, using these collector card cases, trading card cases, and how he's totally re appropriating using, putting Keith Haring in the game here. And then I believe he creates the Keith Haring work with AI, probably doing basketball work by Keith Haring or something like that is the prompt. And so as you see here, AI imaginary game, the game by Keith Haring. Really nice work. So again, a one of one, which I guess I beat out Billy Joe. I guess I put eleven tezos on that. And here's a guy blotter NFT, whose work we looked at before.
00:26:04.240 - 00:26:32.526, Speaker A: And like, this is an awesome work here. He's been putting out some, one of ones for seven tezos is the starting bid and nobody has bid. I meant to, but I was in the Twitter spaces yesterday. So anyways, if you want some very cheap one of ones that are pretty cool. And it looks like he's doing a tribute, I assume, to Albert Hoffman on the bicycle ride. And I guess maybe it's Albert Hoffman's birthday. I'm just thinking out loud here and speculating, but maybe that's what's going on here.
00:26:32.526 - 00:26:54.360, Speaker A: So anyways, blotter NFT, if you're looking for, and you see, there's Albert Hoffman, so 1943. So anyways, he has his theme, blotter NFT, and it's pretty cool. I have the Elon Musk work, which I think is awesome. You can get that for $6.75. And it's only an edition of five. So anyways, that's a beautiful work. And that's $5 an edition of five.
00:26:54.360 - 00:27:40.104, Speaker A: Wow. So anyways, here are the new ones, Burke Baker days. So who knows what the reference is there another one of one I got for an outrageous sum of two tezos yesterday from rustic digital art. And it just shows how, I don't know if Fickle's the right word, but how the scene, like he sold out the first two works, then he puts out a one of one and then nobody bids or like one person bid one tezos. And then I kind of snuck in there with a somewhat guilty conscience and bid, like, two tazos. With ten minutes left, I was thrilled to get this for, again, $1.60. I got this really cool.
00:27:40.104 - 00:28:06.240, Speaker A: As part of this awesome cloud period series. So now I thought I had another one here. Here we go. Let's put this back in order. And revolution. So he's got a new one edition of ten now, and a whole bunch of Super Marios. Interesting color change here, isn't it? So going with a pink background and how he's making the Mario out of, like, a bigger Mario out of smaller marios.
00:28:06.240 - 00:28:37.614, Speaker A: So I love just this whimsical experimentation here by rustic digital art. It really brings something, I think, to what we're looking at here as a whole. Like, it's really valuable, in my opinion, what he's doing there. So it's just interesting. So might have to pick that up, I mean, just to help complete the series here. So, anyways, very, very cool. And again, you know, using Super Mario iconography, but turning into a landscape and just playing with abstraction and representation at the same time.
00:28:37.614 - 00:28:55.258, Speaker A: Again, just experimentation. So, pack of cigarettes by Dan control. Sold. I believe it went for 120 pack of cigarettes. So anyways, just very nice work. This was on foundation, I believe. So, yeah.
00:28:55.258 - 00:29:22.542, Speaker A: So anyways, nice work by Dan Control. I miss this by, like 2 seconds. I think bubba boo got in there at the last second. Anyways, a really cool work. Homage by Bzaya to Messi here. So the World cup homages continue with the, you know, the poetic, almost like the laurels, I think you'd call them. Or I guess the Olympics.
00:29:22.542 - 00:29:40.262, Speaker A: They wear that too. The golden, I think you call them laurels. And Messi there with the World cup. Very nice painting by digital painting by Bzzaya, as per usual. And we got a couple of more. Minta also did her homage supporting Messe. Messi.
00:29:40.262 - 00:29:58.548, Speaker A: Three stars. And so I guess there is two tezos, or there's three tezo stars in the background there. And there is Minta. So a cool. Again, kind of probably based on a screenshot, I'm assuming. And there's a signature and everything. It's another homage.
00:29:58.548 - 00:30:25.600, Speaker A: It's cool, again, you know, showing how international this audience is. You gotta love how the soccer. Because I think if the Super bowl, when the Super bowl happens, I'm not sure we're gonna see the same kind of tributes. And we have one more from Moda, MT, land of champions. And this is interesting for him in the sense that he started putting a texture in the background. Interesting composition. Like the World cup trophy.
00:30:25.600 - 00:30:57.904, Speaker A: And I think that's him. And then with the goalie and, you know, fist bumping with Messi here and what looks like a lighthouse or something with argentinian flags. And it's almost like this is like the argentinian flag as the sky right, with the sun in the middle there. Maybe that's what's going on. So anyway, it's just interesting. And the notorious goalie continuing on, is that still available? That was. Maybe that was burned.
00:30:57.904 - 00:31:21.260, Speaker A: Okay, so it's burned three minutes later. Maybe he put out a new version. Playing with fire here with all these windows I'm loading. Okay, so now it's $29.69. So it looks like it sold out and did quite well continuing on. So we looked at Liny troughed yesterday, the series by Tuks, we looked at one or two days ago, I should say. So here's the entire series.
00:31:21.260 - 00:31:47.084, Speaker A: And it all sold out, by the way. And what I was commenting last time is I think we're seeing like, a new boldness and experimentation. And remember, Tewks uses AI and painting in combination, so one assumes that's what's going on here, because there are quite a few works. And you see they're quite, I would say, successful. Like, they're all convincing in their own way. And as a series, they're convincing. And you can see the.
00:31:47.084 - 00:32:06.714, Speaker A: Looks like the mint price was 0.08. There were 50 of these. So that's a pretty nice haul. Like, this person tooks just made like four ETH by putting out this series. And it probably, like, you know, maybe it took a couple of weeks for him to make, if not less. I'm just guessing here. And look, there is a market, and now the floor is 0.4
00:32:06.714 - 00:32:29.854, Speaker A: ETH, and there's probably a nice little royalty on that. So very cool. Okay, so there is a piece, I think we might have looked at this one already, but you see, like, it's a very nice, interesting. The edge here, like, it almost. You could print these out, you know, going back to Charles AI. Like, it almost looks like a physical piece here. Like, you see a shadow.
00:32:29.854 - 00:33:10.860, Speaker A: But if, let's say you cropped it at the frame here, you could print these out and it would be pretty respectable, and it probably looked pretty good. So just interesting. And he also, Tooke's also put out this series on object. And you see, like, again, another kind of consistent series here. So all to say, we're seeing a lot of AI kind of innovation. Like, I'm not sure how much longer the rest of us should stay on the sidelines with our dabbling in it because, like, it's going well for those people that are really dedicating themselves to it. Pretty interesting.
00:33:10.860 - 00:33:29.782, Speaker A: And here is a larger version of one of the works from object. So. And there's a huge market for it. And it's pretty, again, interesting and beautiful. What's going on here? So, yeah, it's czech. The union of the individual soul with the divine. And to bring about the redemption of the world through this union.
00:33:29.782 - 00:33:58.260, Speaker A: So interesting. I guess there's a lot going on here. Kind of reminds me of those, you know, when you're in an archaeological museum and you see all the jewelry from past cultures and societies continuing on. Here's just an interesting work by an artist I'd never seen before. Chago. I don't think we've seen them before. So again, kind of like somewhat Liechtenstein esque, but totally different and just interesting.
00:33:58.260 - 00:34:14.324, Speaker A: Still life abstraction sold for 15 ETH. So other people like it, too. This is part of a series called interceptions. There's two of them. And you see also this sold for a quarter of an ETH. This nice still life here with the flowers in it. So interesting.
00:34:14.324 - 00:34:31.024, Speaker A: Just kind of combination of still life and abstraction. Kind of almost mondrian type colors here, aren't they? And Lichtenstein. Almost like comic book colors. Interesting. Hasdrubal waffle. Some more crazy experimentation. Okay.
00:34:31.024 - 00:34:54.030, Speaker A: As we've come to expect from Hasdrubal, kind of a, I want to call, like, somewhat culty figure here on object. So just kind of wild experimentation. Small additions. They sell out immediately whenever they're sold. I guess there was an auction for three minutes, and then sale cancelled. Auction, I guess, an hour later. Yeah.
00:34:54.030 - 00:35:29.502, Speaker A: Not sure what happened here. But anyway, has dribble waffle, and here's another kind of wild work. Knock down, punks down the clown. So very bold, in my opinion, in what's going on here. Like, yeah, I would never think of putting all this stuff together and minting it, but Hasdrubal has kind of created a, like, there's a consistency to it that makes it, you know, believable. And I'm a huge collector now. As soon as I see, like, I'm still like, I can't wait to, like, I picked this one up as well.
00:35:29.502 - 00:35:55.824, Speaker A: The bottoms. Bizarre, I guess. Again, nice small addition. I thought the bottoms bazaar would go beautifully with this one, you know? So again, you can get this other sweater for 15. And just a very, very interesting artist. I think Santiago was saying in a comment once that his favorite artist, if I got that right. New work by Heidi Rockette coffee, one of our favorite topics.
00:35:55.824 - 00:36:17.952, Speaker A: This must be your lucky day. So I think it's called lucky day. And this was interesting. The mint price was only a Tezos, which was interesting. And now, yeah, there's basically none available on secondary, so you have to put an offer in edition of 33. Always cool. Another glitch rom, this time from Glitchtown Arcade.
00:36:17.952 - 00:36:43.264, Speaker A: Buy for two, edition of 100. This seems to be part of the trash series, doesn't it? So interesting. So again, playing with abstraction and pushing the limits here. And we see this really cool kind of pixelated background here. And anyways, always interesting. From Glitchtown Arcade, dumpster diving, part of Tez trash event. Look what I found.
00:36:43.264 - 00:36:57.564, Speaker A: Cool. Sean Luke, hard pass. And again, kind of an Og on the Tezos blockchain. And so here you go. A knight, I think. And here you go. And just an interesting.
00:36:57.564 - 00:37:16.934, Speaker A: Using his themes of skulls with kind of pixelation and animation. Hard pass and a work by popple. Let's just. Is a star chaser. Is this what it's called? The fall of a star chaser? And this is interesting. We'll look at the write up here in a second. So here's the work made in aspirite.
00:37:16.934 - 00:37:43.454, Speaker A: And again, the colors are super interesting. You see how the. You almost see like a gray kind of come in here, over here, and it looks kind of like, again, Sci-Fi there's stars. So when you look up close, it's not like pure like. I mean, it was made in aseprite. I want to look at what it says here as far as the process, because it's super interesting process wise. This work was hand drawn in pixel art.
00:37:43.454 - 00:38:16.222, Speaker A: Illustration tool aseprite plus post processing. It's quite large in size when compared to average pixel artwork seen online. And it was done by brushing rather than line drawing. So I have to open up aseprite again, because I don't realize there's brushing. What I tried to do here was to break common cliche of pixel art. I want to show that pixel art does not have to be on a small canvas size of 200 by 200 pixels. And it surely does not have to be that cute and blocky look inside view or top down perspective, which often makes it associated with retro video games.
00:38:16.222 - 00:38:43.216, Speaker A: I love games, though. So he's just trying to break, you know, pixel art, you know, patterns that people are using. So anyways, very, very interesting experimentation. He sent one of these to me. I think it was a gift for a lot of people. So anyways, yeah, so not small, right? And the original was 2100 by 29 60. So not easy to work an aseprite in that size.
00:38:43.216 - 00:39:11.100, Speaker A: I don't think it starts taking up a lot of Ram. Let me just get this right here. Byte by bit. So kind of playing with. So with the nebulas, but then with some of his abstraction here. So it looks like it's kind of mixing together. Let's just look, because you see here, you see, again, you have it here too.
00:39:11.100 - 00:39:34.448, Speaker A: So spacerunner nebula's exploration. So to me, this looks like a abstract thing, like some sort of thing in space. And then combined with the nebulas. So interesting development here. So here's another one, right? And again, using retro tools, pixelwork made with pc paint. 3.1. Byte by bit.
00:39:34.448 - 00:40:00.396, Speaker A: Here's another work. Byte by bit, pixelwork made with pc paint. 3.1. Rebel Desert. This kind of looks like the front of a video game, or like the homepage or what loads up Rebel desert one combat strategy. So playing with this almost what to me seems like a simulated video game, a fake video game, video games that never, that don't exist. Copyright 2022, bite by bit.
00:40:00.396 - 00:40:24.602, Speaker A: Yeah, so playing with the tropes that you might see in these old video games. Very nice as well, with the sky, just how it's treated here. So interesting. That's a one of one. And that is 1020 tazos for a one of one. Here's a collaboration by mech TXT and one of one, neo love from the sky. Very interesting composition, I thought.
00:40:24.602 - 00:41:07.432, Speaker A: So, again, playing with pixel art. And one of the interesting things that came up yesterday, we were talking about discovering object. And this almost, this kind of one of the revelations that comes when you come to object is this almost this idea of pixel art as high art that comes in. I had already had that experience, in a sense, with Rada on Ethereum. When I saw Rada's work, he was the first kind of pixel artist that I went, hold on, this is amazing. This is museum art, right? But then when you get on object and just the big wide world Internet with no gatekeepers on object and tezos, then you just see so much pixel art and. Yeah, so anyways, so here's a nice piece.
00:41:07.432 - 00:41:26.550, Speaker A: Love from the sky. So it looks like this couple are meeting each other, this woman on a parachute and this guy smoking his cigarette. And I wonder if that's her partner there, her previous partner, or maybe that is the love in the sky. So a little bit of ambiguity here. There's a rocket ship and some people surfing. Pretty fun. Mech txt.
00:41:26.550 - 00:41:49.108, Speaker A: Now look at this. I didn't realize that mech TXT did work on Sol and mech TXT does very good. You know, works in progress is very good on the twitter. Right? Like, just stuff like this. It just shows how important it is to show your work. Like, I should do this ten times more. I almost.
00:41:49.108 - 00:42:09.064, Speaker A: I do it once in a while with almost a lot of reservations. But you see here, like, this stuff looks great. I had no idea that he had work on Saul. And it looks great. My Sol Genesis series gallery started to fill. Couldn't wait on how it looks like when all of the 13 pieces are all out. So maybe still releasing stuff.
00:42:09.064 - 00:42:33.926, Speaker A: And it's again, different blockchains almost bring about different kinds of series. And you see that here, right? Thanks for supporting me on the whole world building attempts, fellas. Drives me forward in my explorations. Fascinating. And here's a close up of what we were discussing in the opening here. This square here is super interesting. And also just like.
00:42:33.926 - 00:43:09.668, Speaker A: Yeah, like what I like about it, like, you see, like the. The yellow bleeds from the river into here and then becomes part of the negative space. So it kind of goes from representational to negative space here. And anyways. But this is like what I want to call an irrational element. Like, why here rather than there? It's just because the poet decided, the artist decided, I'm going to put it here, I guess I like the look of it, is probably what he's thinking to himself. So anyways, I just found this really interesting and beautiful kind of pushing representation.
00:43:09.668 - 00:43:30.784, Speaker A: It goes one step further where it starts to get into abstraction. Okay. And here's a work that he released, which I think sold out immediately before you could blink. Probably like, look listed at 02:00 yesterday. 02:02 and was sold out by 02:04 so I missed this one. A beautiful work. I love the colors and.
00:43:30.784 - 00:44:04.358, Speaker A: Yeah, so I wouldn't be hesitating calling yourself an artist here. 1800 by 2100 png. And yeah, with the frame here, 180 by 210 pixels. So just, you know. So that's why, as I was saying in the Twitter spaces yesterday, if I was to teach digital art, I would start with pixel art, even though that's not what I started with. But I think it's just a nice kind of simple foundation for teaching digital art, because you learn all. It's all the sort of there are.
00:44:04.358 - 00:44:49.354, Speaker A: It's more complex than it sounds, and it's using kind of what we might think of as a basic on and off type tool. And so, anyways, I'd start with pixel art and with, you know, eight BDU style pixel art, and then go, okay, now we'll try 24 by 24 pixels. Now we'll try 64 by 64, and then go like that. There's your first module of your digital art less course, Tom Berbatl, whom I'm really liking. It's always great how you can find new talent all the time. You just got to dig a little bit. And I was showing his work the other day, and so his kind of Sandman type character, the guy with the mask and the, you know, air oxygen.
00:44:49.354 - 00:45:07.822, Speaker A: Now he's on a scooter. I love this one. So, yeah, I picked that up. Let's see how quickly they're selling. Like, I think he's got a pretty devoted following here. Yeah, because, like, I mean, he'll post this at 454, and it'll be sold out for only two tezos by 507, though. So that's pretty cool.
00:45:07.822 - 00:45:16.694, Speaker A: Tom bomb. Bombardle. Bombadil. Tom Bombadil. Geek. Put out a really, I thought, kind of poetic work. Lonely.
00:45:16.694 - 00:45:48.628, Speaker A: And, you know, I think this is. I feel like I know what this is based on. Like, I feel like I know the reference, but not off the top of my head. I like the really jagged pitched pixels here. So, again, if I was to guess, like, maybe that's 64 by 64 pixels, but you see how important the canvas size is when you're dealing with pixel art. So, yeah, this is a 101. Sold for eight to Mikey Wilson, the famed Mikey Wilson, on the Tezos blockchain, Edmorola with blob.
00:45:48.628 - 00:46:14.512, Speaker A: So, here's some more pixel art. So, again, you're seeing the experimentation here. Again, pixel art is kind of like, quote unquote, and I use the term with a lot of reservations. High art, you know, like, this is not just. You know, this is not just some simple representational scene here. There's kind of a lot going on, and some interesting brushwork, interesting colors. There is some representation, but there's some abstraction.
00:46:14.512 - 00:46:29.024, Speaker A: Blob by Ed Marolla. Here's another work by Ed Marolla. Now, I don't know what this is, but I've been seeing it, and you've probably been seeing it. Koei Khan. And Ailey has been doing some work. We're gonna see her work right away here. Koei Khan.
00:46:29.024 - 00:46:49.124, Speaker A: Official Tego Daego wear. So there's a sweater. I don't know if it's a Christmas sweater thing or whatever. Anyways, great looking piece. Again, I'm assuming this is probably like 64. Not sure how many pixels this is, but you see this is a. Yeah, you see, just nice pixel work.
00:46:49.124 - 00:47:05.368, Speaker A: And here is more koe kon. So some more hints here. A story based on Koei Khan. So. And you can see Koei kon. So I'm probably even not pronouncing that right. Learn the origins of Koi Khan and how the red.
00:47:05.368 - 00:47:37.020, Speaker A: So this may just be some tradition I have no idea about, or maybe it's something they all created. Koei Khan's sweater party by Ilay. Continuing with the AI and big shout out to Ilay, who put out the notes again and was helping retweet the Twitter spaces yesterday, which I'm sure was very helpful. The most generous person on Twitter, I'd call Ilay without any kind of reservation there. So anyways, some sweaters that she's working on. AI. I'm really excited just to see how this is going to go.
00:47:37.020 - 00:48:10.080, Speaker A: More interesting compositions. And again, collaborating with, I believe that's Santiago and Hasdrubal waffle. So I'm not sure exactly what's going on, if she's feeding in their works or if they're passing them back and forth. Feel free to leave a comment if you guys want to clarify, because maybe a lot of people are like me and just kind of don't know what's going on there, but feel like you should know what's going on. Here's an. I'm not sure if we looked at Evelyn O before, but an interesting AI work. So clownvamp started bidding on these two works here.
00:48:10.080 - 00:48:42.544, Speaker A: Kind of has a bit of a klimt feel to it, don't they? So those in particular, I think, attracted clownvamp because, you see, they're here. These don't have the Klimt view look as much. So anyway, very interesting. Pretty healthy bids here, too, at quarter of an ETH. So awesome work from Evelyn zero two and Evelyn zero two. Evelyn O is also a digital artist on super rare. So kind of playing, you know, with this representation.
00:48:42.544 - 00:49:12.294, Speaker A: Sorry, abstraction and, like, figurative work is, I guess, you know, mixing the two and we see it here. Okay, do we have a write up? Could use something in the bio more than digital artists, just so we could learn a bit more. Shout out to Evelyn O in Stockholm, Sweden. Anyway, cool, good looking. Interesting work. Strange thing, just always interesting to follow him. So thank you to everyone who purchased my first ever super chief collab event.
00:49:12.294 - 00:49:37.044, Speaker A: 45 editions sold at $100 each. You collectors made my Christmas. Thank you. So this is the work. So very cool. Classic, we might say strange thing at this point. And interesting experimentation from strange thing AI experimenting with something a little different thoughts mid journey community stable diffusion and put some music.
00:49:37.044 - 00:49:57.004, Speaker A: So anyway, playing with space. So that's another cool thing about strange thing. He doesn't rest on his laurels. There's. So this, in a sense, only went for five ETH. The work by Charles AI. I thought this would go for more just because there's kind of like twelve Charles AI's in here.
00:49:57.004 - 00:50:17.850, Speaker A: Anyways, very cool work. Mysterio. NFT, I think, got a pretty good deal when you compare it to the rest of Charles AI's collection. Anyways, nobody, I think, is complaining at raking in $6,000 us. Pretty nice. So congrats to Charles AI. A couple of works by Mister Shapeless here.
00:50:17.850 - 00:50:41.402, Speaker A: I don't know if. I don't think we've seen these. So just a couple of, you know, I'm not sure if they were minted, but they're looking good. These kind of shapes in the sky, these forms in the sky. So just a quick look there. An artist I'd never seen before said Inc. Digital creator NFT artists kind of has a bit of the Mo Wellington meets Mister shapeless, almost.
00:50:41.402 - 00:51:05.378, Speaker A: These clouds are super interesting because they're quite suggestive. I think Dali would love these clouds. These clouds are really interesting. So, I mean, the whole thing is interesting. The necks. So anyways, the head coming out of the head again, really AI artwork, you know, stuff that would only come out of AI, especially when you put it all together. Look at the eyes, are very interesting.
00:51:05.378 - 00:51:28.998, Speaker A: Looks like raw AI, doesn't it? This is part of Tez Girls, which I'm not sure if it's an event or just a group. This is Marina Amadova with a very nice AI artwork. I believe it's AI. Sure has that feeling. Right. It's kind of got, you know, as I like to say, like, the AI has certain biases towards the outcomes. It's biased toward certain outcomes.
00:51:28.998 - 00:51:49.914, Speaker A: And I think we see that. And that's why some of the AI artists kind of have certain similarities here. Like, it's got almost a bit of a mister shapeless kind of look to it here. Co created with AI and post processing 2048 by 2048. So anyways, very interesting. Let's see how it sold. Editions of ten, and they are not for sale yet.
00:51:49.914 - 00:52:00.054, Speaker A: Good looking piece. And here's some of her other work. Again, a new this is pretty nice, too. Look at these colors. The power of the gaze. Yeah. So, I mean, pretty nice.
00:52:00.054 - 00:52:16.266, Speaker A: Good looking AI art, if you ask me, playing a lot with these two figures, these twin figures. Very interesting. So another AI artist on the radar for us. Continuing on. Here's another one. Beyonder. So look at.
00:52:16.266 - 00:52:38.774, Speaker A: Yeah, just. So this is AI. Yeah. I'm not even sure what to make of this kind of black background. It's just kind of who knows what the prompts are. Five fingers here, you know? So, again, it looks like raw AI, which is pretty stunning. I mean, if this is what that is, I don't know how you get these little waves and everything.
00:52:38.774 - 00:53:04.364, Speaker A: If you're uploading a source image again, I think it. It makes sense for a lot of us to spend a little bit more time with AI, those of us who aren't, who have only dabbled beyond our. So here's some of his other work. So interesting, right? And selling very cheap, but this sold for one. I think there's nothing wrong. It's better to move your work. You know, I think, as Picasso said, you got to move your work.
00:53:04.364 - 00:53:20.096, Speaker A: And. Or as Steve Jobs said, you got a ship. At a certain point, you got to end your project and just put it out there. You got a ship. Also part of the Tez girls event. This is moonchild. So moonchild has been more, I think, on foundation and now super rare, but it's cool.
00:53:20.096 - 00:53:43.212, Speaker A: Again, multi chain moonchild put out a work for Tez girls. Again, this really interesting combination of abstraction and these faces. It's instantly recognizable as a moonchild work. And I think that's kind of the key. That's what you want as an artist in general that people know. That is a pokebelly. That is a moon child.
00:53:43.212 - 00:54:05.218, Speaker A: And I think in AI in particular, it's important to have that kind of unified look. So. And here's some of just the other Tez girls. So check it out. There's a ton of work here. I just kind of cherry picked a couple of works here. And finally, a couple of works by sit and explore.
00:54:05.218 - 00:54:24.594, Speaker A: So here are kind of someone at the computer here. And again, AI artwork. Pretty sure this is raw AI, but not positive. Sometimes she'll use a few different programs. Also sum the dark knight. So a bit of a different look and feel on this one. Hey, almost a darker kind of almost.
00:54:24.594 - 00:54:43.850, Speaker A: Who is this figure? The black cat. So, interesting work from Zoom now for 20. And so this sold out right away, too. Sold out within, like, 20 minutes, 30 minutes for five or three and then five. Yeah. So anyways, very cool. A couple of physical works before we go.
00:54:43.850 - 00:55:05.638, Speaker A: This is by woke, who did this? Goldfish in a bag. Poetic, isn't it? Another just interesting work by walk. And it's nice because wock works a lot with spray paint. So it's nice to see him draw, too. Again, just shows some range and just depth when you start doing stuff like that. Very interesting artist here. This is Helen beard art.
00:55:05.638 - 00:55:37.074, Speaker A: So this is physical work, too, that I saw on Instagram. Kind of erotic, obviously, but, you know, really riding that erotic abstraction kind of, you know, combination here. Like, maybe you know what that is, you know, so interesting, right? Like, it's so abstracted that it starts to be like, I feel okay putting it on this program, let's say. Although it's quite erotic, what you're seeing going on there. There's the artist. And look at how good these prints look. So Helen Beard, I've never heard of her.
00:55:37.074 - 00:55:58.116, Speaker A: But, like, again, these prints look stunning. So, you know, part of what makes prints look stunning, it sounds ridiculous, is this big white margin. You know, when you put stuff with that nice white margin, it looks great. And you put a little bit of pencil for the edition number. Anyway, cool work. Thank you once again for joining me. And thanks again to everybody who came out to the spaces yesterday.
00:55:58.116 - 00:56:02.324, Speaker A: Lots of excitement coming out over there. Until next time, take care.
