00:00:08.680 - 00:00:51.974, Speaker A: Artist Journal December 23, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and this is my holiday special. Welcome one, welcome all. And I know Christmas isn't everybody's jam, I realize, and maybe the holidays are, though, look at this incredible NFT. I mean, let me just turn it down a bit. But I've always been a massive fan of Christmas. I mean, mostly probably because of the incredible show production, frankly, that my mom would put on for us, my parents, for Christmas.
00:00:51.974 - 00:01:43.958, Speaker A: I mean, what kind of made it so exciting for me as a kid, well into my teenage years, was there'd only be like two or three presents under the tree until the 24th. And of course, we were in North America, Saskatoon. So we celebrate on the 25th. Here in Germany, you celebrate on the 24th, but there'd be like a handful of presents under the tree. And then after the massive Christmas Eve dinner that we would have, then my grandma and mom tirelessly would start wrapping presents at like 1130. And so I would wake up at like five in the morning, run downstairs, plug in the Christmas tree lights and look at the massive amount of presents. Call me materialistic, but as a kid, that was the most exciting thing ever.
00:01:43.958 - 00:02:46.580, Speaker A: It was the greatest time of year. It was the greatest day of the year because there was so much loot under the tree. And so anyways, I have always had a soft spot, you know, just, it's also been one of the most surrealist times of year. Like, I mean, delights the, the presents, the red and white, you know, Santa Claus guy, at least for Christmas. I realize everybody celebrates different ways. As our friend in Uzbekistan was saying on the Twitter spaces, you know, they celebrate New Year's and so anyways, all to say, here is your holiday special and welcome, and I hope everybody is easing their way into the holidays, whatever you celebrate, and I hope you enjoy this, whatever tradition you might have. So isn't this spectacular? Ivan Tez Christmas 2021 the best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched.
00:02:46.580 - 00:03:29.278, Speaker A: They must be felt with the heart. Collaboration of Elvand and Toland music so anyways, what a spectacular NFT, you know, like, this is something again that you only see as an NFT. You're not gonna, I mean, unless you're trading usb sticks, combining music and this kind of digital art, it's probably never been made physical, you know, and you got like the animation here with the snow, it can only exist as digital art and it can only be traded, bought and sold as an NFT. So you gotta love it. So just a beautiful scene I remember when I first saw this, I had to have it. Didn't buy it till recently. And there's a ton left, if that is your jam.
00:03:29.278 - 00:03:53.912, Speaker A: Here's another one. Lewis Osborne, present factory. Let me see if we can get this bit bigger. And so, anyways, pretty awesome. You see the bulbs here? And Lewis Osborne, of course, has had a spectacular year. And, yeah, I mean, he has pretty much blown up this year, about halfway through the year in the summer. And that's about the time I actually started this show when I thought everyone was about to blow up.
00:03:53.912 - 00:04:16.600, Speaker A: And that never really happened. But we've been having a great time since. And here's another one. Presents, also by Louis Osborne. And just classic, kind of like the graphic design y Christmas combination. So, anyways, what you'll see here is a ton of artists. They love to do Christmas, and so that's great.
00:04:16.600 - 00:05:00.288, Speaker A: And the holidays, as we'll see, continuing on, here's Uyoh 66. So another kind of fan favorite over here, from my perspective. And, yeah, just beautiful. I mean, there's not much to say on these, but just awesome. Christmas works, you know, and you can just look at them and, you know, the snowflakes, I think in terms of creating your Christmas image, I mean, the tree, there's something about that imagery that, for me, again, it's almost. It's like the most. As the songs go, it's like the most magical time of year, but in a very real way, for someone, at least like myself, who grew up with this stuff all, it's kind of intoxicating.
00:05:00.288 - 00:05:32.730, Speaker A: And that's why it's. I've always kind of loved it. My girlfriend, not so much. I mean, kind of hilariously well to myself. I was thinking this morning, and my girlfriend's super busy right now, of course, her family's in town in Berlin here, visiting from London. So there's 18 people at our Christmas, which should be spectacular, but the biggest Christmas I've ever had. But what I wanted her to do was to knock on the door here halfway through the show, and me pretend to be surprised, and it's like, oh, I think we have a visitor.
00:05:32.730 - 00:05:55.724, Speaker A: And then she could bring in some cookies and we have a little two minute conversation and then move on. Just like Bing Crosby showing up at David Bowie's Christmas. I think that happened. Anyway, continuing on here, be home for Christmas. Here's a nice one. Let's just put this to the start. Capturing the Christmas spirit here or the holiday spirit.
00:05:55.724 - 00:06:23.864, Speaker A: Pretty cool. The good life. So, yeah, pretty awesome. And again, something that could really only exist as digital art. Many of these works again, the animation and everything. So some of my favorite iconography, a keyboard at Christmas. Meow Christmas.
00:06:23.864 - 00:06:44.800, Speaker A: I love cats too, so it kind of has everything for me. It would be hard to screw this one up for me. And so meow Christmas. A nice snowstorm in the background. I mean, speaking of snowstorms, it's like the winter apocalypse in Canada. It's almost like even if you're not from Canada, it's like worth looking at the canadian news. It's pretty epic what they have going on there.
00:06:44.800 - 00:07:08.344, Speaker A: Like everything is at a standstill. I think they are. Sorry, let me just get the artist's name there for you. Oh, just, just tez address. Tail card. This by tail card. If you look at the weather in Canada and it's like across this entire massive country, it's rain and then it flash freezing or something.
00:07:08.344 - 00:07:26.274, Speaker A: Then it freezes instantly and then a blizzard on top of. So they're kind of saying like, it don't travel, you know, at least on the 24th. So be safe. Everyone in Canada out there and everybody out there. Holidays are a crazy time of year sometimes. Let's just see what the write up here is. This was interesting.
00:07:26.274 - 00:07:56.876, Speaker A: This is someone from Indonesia. What I think, when I think about winter, there is no winter in Indonesia, which kind of makes me want to move there. I only saw snow on the television screen every Christmas when I was a kid. When it comes to creating works with a winter theme, this is what comes to mind. So pretty fun, right? This is just their. They've never, you know, if you want to experience Christmas, as my girlfriend says, who's from Bolivia. It's like Canada is like the North Pole, you know? And it really is this year, you know, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
00:07:56.876 - 00:08:18.508, Speaker A: It's like with the wind chill, it feels like -50 and that's what I saw in the news reports today, like -50 back to our art here. Xmas, homies. This is by always udies. So a Christmas tree and living in a confusing world. Sometimes we have to celebrate our achievements. So far. So far.
00:08:18.508 - 00:08:30.124, Speaker A: Yeah. I think we should take a break. Calm your mind, make a wish and let's take the gift. Merry Christmas, homies. So very cool. And yeah, absolutely. I like these messages as much as the art.
00:08:30.124 - 00:09:02.383, Speaker A: And I like the art a lot. That's why I'm showing it. Ezra Eslin. So this is great because Ezra Eslund does a lot of these kind of dark works where it'll be someone bleeding at a keyboard or something. And so at first I was like, where's the darkness? Right? But then you see the decorations, you have a gun, a skull, a knife. So it's an Ezra Eslin Christmas over here, and merry Christmas. So it's great to see all these kind of prominent artists on the Tezos blockchain do their Christmas.
00:09:02.383 - 00:09:26.232, Speaker A: I like her title there. Sweet Christmas. You see, it hits a lot of people again. Like, it's got that surrealistic, almost psychedelic feel to it. The bright lights, the crazy iconography, the reindeer, all of it. So I've always found Christmas kind of intoxicating. As someone who likes to look at art like this all the time, it's like, you know, it really.
00:09:26.232 - 00:09:55.688, Speaker A: It's at least in the. I can only speak for where I grew up. But, like, in the west, say in North America, it's by far the most magical time of year. It's as close as we get to celebrating any kind of, you know, rite of sorts. You know, I guess maybe there's Easter, but in North America, I guess there's Thanksgiving, which is almost in the US, is almost as big of a holiday. Anyways, this is Dxx 58. Pretty nice work, you know, interesting take.
00:09:55.688 - 00:10:25.354, Speaker A: Like, again, if he didn't make it or she, then I don't know if anybody would have made this work. Interesting colors, kind of well executed. Christmas special edition. Ho ho ho. Summer blues, who's also on super rare, the haze skull. Merry Christmas, skull fams. So kind of a weird take on Santa with maybe some reindeer horns and a skeleton and a little stocking hanging off of the reindeer.
00:10:25.354 - 00:10:49.374, Speaker A: The reindeer, what do you call it? Horns. Continuing on Matthias la Plata. Isn't it amazing? You'll see, like, there's a who's who here of like, tazos artists and more and beyond. Tezos, the Grinch by Matthias la Plata. So anyways, part of his kind of trading card series. So just a ton of work. Buy for 200.
00:10:49.374 - 00:11:19.064, Speaker A: The Grinch card number five. And again, growing up in North America, the Grinch was a major part of Christmas. Bozia Jappy Rickmas exclusive piece for the event. Box to burn zero two. Christmas edition. Ricardus took a small vacation and is here to celebrate December 24 with number 24. I can't believe that he ordered his exclusive Santa costume directly from Vietnam, but seems that he likes to keep listening to real trap.
00:11:19.064 - 00:11:43.156, Speaker A: So anyways, we could go on and on, but we have quite a bit to go through here. So anyways, Beziah, nice piece. This Ricardo series is totally awesome. Again, kind of attempting to call iconic on tazos. Another work here. Let me just reset this by Audie Woody. And this is Audie Wood.
00:11:43.156 - 00:12:03.244, Speaker A: Who is this character here, if I am not mistaken. And here's Mark Zuckerberg. And I think it's called Christmas with the boz. Yeah, here it is. Christmas with the bozz. So again, another kind of classic artist from the Tezos blockchain reset. And here's just one I saw in passing.
00:12:03.244 - 00:12:28.094, Speaker A: I think it just came out about a week ago, December 10. Here it is. And cap 73. And I thought, kind of a nice, kind of genuine work. I'm kind of a big fan of genuine works with, you know, that's something you see out here, again, with contemporary art. Oftentimes it's got to be so ironic. And so what I called in the Twitter space is sometimes there's a sense of it being over sophisticated.
00:12:28.094 - 00:12:52.134, Speaker A: Right. And so for me, sometimes it's nice just to have someone doing a genuinely kind of positive work, which is kind of what, you know, kind of innocent. I think that's kind of what appeals to me a little bit. Here is the innocence Christmas spirit. Buy for five. Gloom tube. Now that we're done with the innocence, let's go to gloom tube.
00:12:52.134 - 00:13:08.190, Speaker A: Vintage Christmas decoration causes house fire. So this just came out yesterday. So well timed. I need to pick this up. So classic situation here. So I guess this is the vintage decoration. And there is the light socket.
00:13:08.190 - 00:13:44.650, Speaker A: You know, another little Christmas story for you. I was hanging out with a german friend about four or five years ago, and she was by Cologne and she was telling me in Germany they put candles on the Christmas tree up until, like, six or seven years ago, like. And so, yeah, so to gloom tube's point here, yeah, a light socket is nothing compared to putting, like, 30 candles on a Christmas tree. That's literally what I was told. And it is a tradition out here. I'm sure some people still do it, you know, pretty wild, although I'm sure it looks spectacular. Here's another classic gloom tube.
00:13:44.650 - 00:14:25.720, Speaker A: I'd love to own this one. JC Penney's couple of santas duking it out in the snow with modern shoes here, I guess some new balance in the parking lot. So this is why people love gloom tube. A, you know, nice satire of, you know, suburbia, the, you know, suburbanization of the soul, as Ballard puts it, and just of the, you know, sometimes thought of as nightmare of suburbia, although, you know, everything has its good and bad and, you know, I wouldn't mind a big house in suburbia living in an apartment in the middle of Berlin. That doesn't sound too bad at all. JcPenney. So anyways, classic.
00:14:25.720 - 00:14:46.780, Speaker A: And of course, we're at cloak. See another Santa Claus here. So some kind of, how do we call it, Santa Claus. Dystopian Santa Claus. Some dystopian Christmases here. So Santa having a drink and a cigarette and a little more. And there is an elf that doesn't look too happy.
00:14:46.780 - 00:15:08.976, Speaker A: Kind of classic rat cloak and interesting. Almost like a reverse gloom tube on the tree there. Buy for 690 exclusive piece for. So I guess this is why there's so much from 2021, this box to burn event. So anyways, continuing on. And a pony. Make it happen.
00:15:08.976 - 00:16:09.922, Speaker A: So this is by Kelwon Art, whose work we looked at maybe six weeks ago. And as I was going through the tags, like, I went through my own collection and stuff I had bookmarked, but I also just went through the Christmas tag on hashtag on tazos. And yeah, you know what was so interesting about that was how well rounded, actually, like, there were works that I hadn't seen before. But then I kept running into artists that we've come across here and I started to feel it was a really interesting experiment was how well rounded. You know, looking back here on our holiday episode, we actually have a decently well rounded idea of what's going on on tezos. And there's always new artists that you miss and, you know, slip through the cracks or whatever, who put out one piece or three little pieces two years ago or one year ago. But I was kind of impressed with how much actually, we have a nice kind of how well rounded things are over here.
00:16:09.922 - 00:16:28.374, Speaker A: We have a good sense of what's going on out there, which is quite something because, again, object is an open platform. Anybody can mint there. So anyways, so here's another great work. It looks like a. This would make a beautiful Christmas cards. All of these, I mean, could be sold as Christmas cards. And this is by just an anonymous wallet.
00:16:28.374 - 00:16:46.810, Speaker A: Buy for fortezos. But you see the Christmas show you could put on here. And of course, Dan control Santa hat. So, you know, just classic using his gradients in a landscape, a Santa hat. So this came out only December 15. So about a week ago, Christmas 2021. Have a merry Christmas.
00:16:46.810 - 00:17:08.284, Speaker A: This is one of the first people I saw. Let me just. Dugomes or. Yeah, dugomes. I thought these were really nice. And so here's a Christmas again would make a beautiful Christmas card or even a screen print, although you wouldn't get these lights in here, but get colored paper. You almost see virtual paper here.
00:17:08.284 - 00:17:24.033, Speaker A: And then you put one layer with kind of the maroon as a screen print. And then you just choose which, you know, frame you're going to use for the lights. And then you put a yellow. It'd make a beautiful screen print. You make cards like that. Screen printed cards. Sell those for $10 each.
00:17:24.033 - 00:17:40.541, Speaker A: Right now you can get the NFT for $0.50. Very nice. Another one I came across in the hashtags here. G rat. Merry Christmas. And when did this come out? Last year, November 25. The inspiration of this artwork is Christmas celebrates festival.
00:17:40.541 - 00:17:56.568, Speaker A: Okay. Interesting. Just combination of stuff. Kind of looks like a sad Christmas person, but maybe just in Christmas meditation there. Very nice work, though. A beautiful composition. So I wanted to show it continuing on.
00:17:56.568 - 00:18:24.234, Speaker A: And this is by an anonymous wallet. Feel safe with the people we love. Kind of another Christmas work here. And this is kind of like a trope to doing these kind of inner architectural things that I've only seen, like, in digital art. Like, you don't see this in contemporary art, painting. There's an artist who we're looking at who does the djing and the keyboards in these kind of things. What's this? Nedved, if I'm remembering the name right, collaborates with them.
00:18:24.234 - 00:18:51.886, Speaker A: So, anyways, and of course, Gabriel Tesorov has several here for us to look at. Buy for 1200. Wow. Sanisleigh Crawfle. So, anyways, of course, Gabriel does the baked goods. And it really reminds me of. What is the name of that artist, the great pop artist who does the donuts and the cake, whose name is escaping me.
00:18:51.886 - 00:19:08.824, Speaker A: But I'm sure half of you guys out there know who I'm talking about. I've compared her to his work before. What is his name, anyways? Gabrielle Tesoarev. And we got a few from her. Like some beautiful, sweet Christmas. Canele. I'm just a huge fan of this artist here.
00:19:08.824 - 00:19:31.124, Speaker A: So here's another one. Maybe the name will come to me as we look at it. Snowman Pavlova. So another one. So, anyways, all part of the Christmas tradition here. Some baked goods, hot choco and ginger cookies, a little hot chocolate. I'm more drinking coffee right now, but look at this.
00:19:31.124 - 00:19:48.880, Speaker A: In the marshmallows, there's so much care put into this. This person. Yeah, it seems to be a passion here. Interestingly small. 826 pixels by 826 pixels edition of ten. And these, my friends, are sold out. And here's another one.
00:19:48.880 - 00:20:08.954, Speaker A: Dure manic Christmas blessings. It's Christmas day, and it's just got a notification. And you just got a notification. Isn't this exciting? After a whole year, could it finally be that sale? Let's just hope it's not another newsletter update. Merry Christmas. What I loved about this piece, and again, I found this through the hashtag. Christmas was the atmosphere.
00:20:08.954 - 00:20:51.506, Speaker A: The color and the atmosphere just kind of captured something really kind of precious, I guess. That fireplace at home, it's at night, it's cold outside. And you even see that here in the window, that blue, which actually kind of nicely contrasts with the rest of this entire piece. You know? And even look at this in the kind of reflection here of the fire and then the blue of the outside, a very kind of deceptively well put together piece. It's kind of deceptive. You go, oh, that's just a nice, simple little drawing, and it's actually pretty well put together by dur himinik. All right, next astor for karma.
00:20:51.506 - 00:21:07.584, Speaker A: Merry Christmas. Let me just get this fixed here. This Christmas tastes amazing. Hope you all have something to celebrate and be thankful about. Love and cheers. And this came out just yesterday. So some more Christmas food.
00:21:07.584 - 00:21:19.800, Speaker A: And I love this. There's a messy card here. That's awesome. And, of course, Christmas decoration. Some Christmas food. Looks like some Christmas cake here. I was pulling some friends.
00:21:19.800 - 00:21:40.184, Speaker A: I can't remember who I was talking to. Nobody I know likes Christmas cake. Like the stuff with the fruit inside, although apologies and shout out and merry Christmas to my mom and my grandma, who has passed away. They would have the Christmas cake. It's a british tradition. And so, in a sense, maybe I'd be disappointed if I didn't see it. But I was asking.
00:21:40.184 - 00:22:05.014, Speaker A: I can't remember who I was in conversation with. I think I was at some sort of thing where I was talking to a few people. It was Italians, actually. I was with a few Italians at a. Just a Christmas adidas Christmas thing that was going on and going on the way home with a friend who had been invited. Anyways, none of them liked Christmas cake, which is kind of funny. And because Pannetone, the Christmas bread, has a lot of those fruits in it, too.
00:22:05.014 - 00:22:24.460, Speaker A: So onto some pixel art. So here's Guan Denarian. So you can see the name here. Just so pretty awesome work here. So using again, like, this pixel art factory here thing, and then putting a big Christmas tree in. So pretty fun. So you see how, like, it's just spread out.
00:22:24.460 - 00:23:06.840, Speaker A: Like, we've seen guandanarians work before, so it's fun just to see what's going on this is an effects hash, freaky snowman number 25. So this is just a sample of one of the snowmen from this effectshash project. And for those that don't know, FX hash is a generative art kind of website where you show. So all of this is done generatively. And so you see just through layers. And so you put the tuk, or the beanie, as we'd call it out here in Berlin, on one layer, you know, the different noses on all on different layers. And then FX hash combines it all up with some code, and then you get, you know, a thousand different.
00:23:06.840 - 00:23:34.392, Speaker A: How many are there here? There's only 25 tokens here for freaky snowman, so. And then you get that. So anyways, popple, one of our favorite artists here, also had a Christmas work last year, and it looks like. Are these diskettes? I'm not sure what these are, but cool little ornaments. It almost looks like his effects hash work put in, like, a polaroid or something. Pretty interesting. So here's the calendar.
00:23:34.392 - 00:24:01.164, Speaker A: Merry Christmas from the screen. Also maybe in Japanese, who does a lot of Sci-Fi work. So anyways, in the snow outside, a wonderful work that was really, again, put together with a lot of care. You see how people, you know how Christmas does and the holidays, but you see how Christmas does really affect people. 2021. What a year. I wish you merry Christmas and a wholesome winter's solstice.
00:24:01.164 - 00:24:23.564, Speaker A: Here is another one again by an artist we've seen before. Megan Nico, 1991, probably a younger guy. And Christmas treehouse, I guess, not that young. So anyways, so just another pixel artwork. There's a ton of pixel art Christmas. They kind of go hand in hand. So anyways, kind of like a Christmas tree meets a building.
00:24:23.564 - 00:24:39.600, Speaker A: Dream street collection. Christmas tree house. So you see how cheap a lot of these are, too. And here's another effects hash generative art project by this time, by estienne. The ugly sweaters. Everybody needs a good old ugly sweater for their Christmas party. I got you covered.
00:24:39.600 - 00:24:56.752, Speaker A: Take one. It's on me. So this was a really cool kind of generative art work and art project. Ugly sweaters. And you see here, I wonder what's the. You still have to pay five tazos. So this was very popular.
00:24:56.752 - 00:25:14.064, Speaker A: There were a thousand of these. So people loved this. And you see, like, there's all the different. Again, this is kind of put together as a generative art. So you put everything on different layers, and then I guess the coating does the rest. I've never actually done a project before, but there are some awesome projects. Here's another.
00:25:14.064 - 00:25:40.572, Speaker A: 1196 pixels of light. Let's get some volume on this. So just kind of fun. Things can be tough, but life goes on. Dear you, I hope you are happy. Like just pure Internet. Pure Internet.
00:25:40.572 - 00:25:57.514, Speaker A: From 196 pixels light. Awesome, awesome, awesome work. This is sold out, I think. Yeah, I managed to pick this up for two. Someone was offering three. So again, these are selling for next to free. Here's another one.
00:25:57.514 - 00:26:20.818, Speaker A: Friday prayer. The fourth celebration of the holiday symbol belonging to the western world, which has been known for peace, togetherness, warmth with loved ones. This is by legalese. Buy for two. So interesting pixel artwork of a Christmas tree. And kind of cool how you see the wire go into this column here. Just kind of a bizarre work, frankly.
00:26:20.818 - 00:26:43.602, Speaker A: Bit of a bizarre kind of Christmas pixel artwork, but interesting. Here's another one by ALV bit that kind of plays on the whole video game kind of perspective in pixel art. Santa and the elves are getting ready to celebrate Christmas. Christmas crew. It kind of looks like a video game. Totally looks like a video game. So I just picked this up last week and yeah, it was in my bookmarks.
00:26:43.602 - 00:26:53.622, Speaker A: Cool fireplace. So just kind of fun. Yeah. Buy for ten. So it's not cheap. Well, it's relative, I guess. Vending machine twelve.
00:26:53.622 - 00:27:12.938, Speaker A: So let me just fix this in the white Christmas. A little warming place, beautiful light, and a gift can make us happy. Merry Christmas. So, Christmas vending machine. Pretty cool with gifts inside. I wonder why they don't. Why someone hasn't done that.
00:27:12.938 - 00:27:28.834, Speaker A: It's actually an awesome idea. Imagine if you just bought your Christmas presents. There kind of a solution for some of us. Although I put a bit more effort. I put quite a bit of effort this year, actually. Merry Christmas. May Christmas bring you happiness and many dreams come true.
00:27:28.834 - 00:27:46.398, Speaker A: Merry Christmas. I wish you all the best by spans. And you see Santa Claus falling out again. Would these all just make great Christmas cards? So very fun. And just beautiful pixel artwork. Again, you start screen printing this pixel artwork. There's not too many colors here.
00:27:46.398 - 00:28:04.520, Speaker A: It's probably like five colors here. So pretty doable and yeah, I mean, then you could really sell those things for good money. Run, Santa, run. Fun Christmas Eve. So kind of a more humorous Christmas. So very fun. Fireplace, I guess.
00:28:04.520 - 00:28:18.464, Speaker A: Santa is being chased by the bears. And by a bear and a reindeer. Nice Christmas tree here. Purple snow. A lot of weird decisions on this one. Which is why I must show it to you. Need some sauce? Is the artist edition seven.
00:28:18.464 - 00:28:28.964, Speaker A: This is the edition of seven. This is one of my favorite. And look at how cheap it is. 0.18. I think. This one is just gorgeous. It kind of captures everything.
00:28:28.964 - 00:28:57.220, Speaker A: The cat, you know, just capturing that kind of, that surrealist, that emotional side to this whole holiday. Very beautifully done. And the contrast of this kind of dark blue with again, this warm light from the Christmas tree lights and the star here. Beautiful. And the cat, very well put together. Work night before Christmas. Let's just see what it says on the night before Christmas.
00:28:57.220 - 00:29:20.788, Speaker A: A cat waiting for Santa. When all the family was asleep, he got bored waiting, so he played the ball with the ball on the tree instead. Agato jiwanga. So a fabulous, fabulous work here. I've been looking at that work for a long time and every time I see it, it just creates that emotion. Pretty impressive. One don't know is this was his Christmas work.
00:29:20.788 - 00:29:42.148, Speaker A: A very prominent collage artist. This artwork was created for Christmas. Merry Christmas to you guys. Wish you all the best. So a Christmas work by one don't knows. So the revelation here of Christmas, again, I'm not a christian, but I love the holiday. So very cool work from one don't knows.
00:29:42.148 - 00:30:07.424, Speaker A: And this is by Charles AI. And so a very cool work. AI work. And the state of crypto Christmas. So kind of a dark kind of theme, but you don't really get that impression, at least for me. I just love the, the wildness of this work. This Christmas tree with these massive Christmas bulbs on it.
00:30:07.424 - 00:30:31.618, Speaker A: I guess when you look closer here, you see the fire and all these people like, it's pretty, it's a very spectacular work here. 0.25. Only five of twelve have been minted here. So still available. Pretty cheap for Charles AI work. And of course we looked at this just recently, but I thought we could look again. Strange things Christmas collection.
00:30:31.618 - 00:31:03.568, Speaker A: His more AI artificial intelligence art here. And you see just how amazing this AI art mixed with fashion and Nike. Again, it's worth coming back to. Merry Christmas, everyone from strange thing, a very nice guy. And here's his other work slideshow, AI designer night Christmas sneakers, which we also looked at, but is worth looking at again, particularly on this show. As we go through the AI Christmas. Look at how spectacular.
00:31:03.568 - 00:31:47.520, Speaker A: I mean, look at that. For those who haven't seen it before, just beautiful and really just, I mean, this looks like the Sears catalog wishes it could be that great. I mean, Sears is probably bankrupt right now and this is why they should have been employing people like strange thing making beautiful again with AI. This is better than like if you hired some, who knows? I mean, I don't want to. But these are the questions I ask myself. If you hired some creative director or photographer, the person that's putting everything together here, like how much would it cost you to get like a campaign that's this effective? And here, strange thing. Probably put it together in less than a week, I'm guessing, with AI.
00:31:47.520 - 00:32:10.112, Speaker A: So there's strange thing. Give him a follow. Just some other AI works as we wrap up here. Fantasy room volume two by minimal museum. Pretty nice work. Pretty, just kind of interesting. Again, something that AI would have produced, but a human would have been pretty weird and hard to put this together as a human.
00:32:10.112 - 00:32:27.184, Speaker A: You just would have had to break a lot of, kind of create a lot of new neural paths to put this together and just like really interesting on the ground here. So I think this is AI. If it's not, I'd be very impressive. AI fantasy Christmas one of one. Wow. Maybe I'll buy that. Eight tazos.
00:32:27.184 - 00:32:50.974, Speaker A: Xenocat's postcard edition of 15. This is a postcard about not being afraid of clowns, even if they seem scary. So this still had a bit of a Christmas feel to me, this AI work, particularly the clothing there. So I thought I would include it, although it's not explicitly stated. Oh, here it is. Christmas. So it is officially a Christmas work.
00:32:50.974 - 00:33:14.324, Speaker A: Continuing on, Aile, who again, has been a big help in growing this program. Give her a follow on twitter. She's been experimenting with sweater parties and Christmas sweater parties. A mashup with Santiago and Hasdrubal waffle. I'm still not exactly sure what they're doing, but it almost doesn't matter. I like the works. And so here is some just cool AI Christmas works.
00:33:14.324 - 00:33:41.560, Speaker A: You see some nice textures and everything, so it's just fun to watch where this goes. Here's another one with this koei kon sweater party. And here is another. So just having fun with this Christmas sweater theme. And here are a few more. So pretty funny. Here's some nice AI distortions here, as we like to call them here, which you often see in the face and coolant.
00:33:41.560 - 00:34:02.000, Speaker A: Okay, so continuing on, just some final Christmas works. This was interesting. A special japanese Christmas scene generated with AI by Rikar. I like the colors a lot on this. It just kind of created a bit of an emotion there. All just like this. Bright, almost like you're visiting houses and you go to the house display with the lights.
00:34:02.000 - 00:34:22.726, Speaker A: That has just the overwhelmingly bright display kind of reminds me of that. There's something about it. And so Tenki kurisumasu another AI work. And here's another AI work. Christmas town in the mountains. At the foothills of the mountain lies a little Christmas town. Its inhabitants are getting ready for the yearly festivities.
00:34:22.726 - 00:34:54.618, Speaker A: See the trees twinkle, the snow fall. And the buildings light with their candles. By lucid Jordan 79 so you know what's kind of interesting here as we go through everything? Last year they had that like, Christmas tazos thing. So we got a ton of like, artwork that of, you know, that is kind of made and whatever. And this year we're seeing a ton of AI Christmas art. So just kind of interesting, isn't it, how much can change in a year? And they didn't have like a Christmas tazo sort of event. So.
00:34:54.618 - 00:35:24.732, Speaker A: At least not that I know of anyways. Nice light and everything here looks like a swiss town, you know, looks like half, half swiss town, half like toy town or something. A very fun, beautiful work by kei ka chill in Christmas day. Just a beautiful, fun work here. And not much to say about it. Beautiful composition. Gotta love the negative space, the snow, the color.
00:35:24.732 - 00:35:41.614, Speaker A: A quiet moment at Christmas with the family there. And here is one of my favorite Christmas works on the Tezos blockchain. Like one of the top three. If not, it's like, yeah. Where I wouldn't be able to decide between the top three. And this is definitely one of them. I think it's called Christmas with you.
00:35:41.614 - 00:35:51.994, Speaker A: Let me just check quickly. Christmas with you. Have a wonderful time with someone special. Merry Christmas by Jaslyn. Art. Let me just maximize that. Again, a fantastic work.
00:35:51.994 - 00:36:20.254, Speaker A: So again, kind of that positive vibe. And I don't need things to be positive. I mean, again, I come out of the surrealist tradition, at least how I see things and or what I learned and what I studied. And so there's a ton of darkness there. Although they have used a lot of, what? Humor. Okay. What Andre Breton called black humor, which was very actually important in Max Ernst, you see, actually a ton of humor.
00:36:20.254 - 00:36:49.146, Speaker A: And that was actually crucial for the surrealists. So, all to say, they weren't totally dark. But anyways, I'm just loving positive art because it's just so against a lot of what we see in the contemporary art world. Much as I love a lot of what goes on and not to put down the contemporary art world. So, anyways, a big merry Christmas. Thank you. For everybody who's been watching, I hope you enjoyed our special Christmas episode here.
00:36:49.146 - 00:37:06.882, Speaker A: And that is by pencil stroke mileage. And Merry Christmas from them. And also a happy holidays from Pix Selena. And let's just see how big we can get that. And thank you, everybody. Merry Christmas and happy holidays. And thank you for everything this year.
00:37:06.882 - 00:37:12.834, Speaker A: I've had a ton of fun, a ton of surprises. And with that, until next time, take care.
