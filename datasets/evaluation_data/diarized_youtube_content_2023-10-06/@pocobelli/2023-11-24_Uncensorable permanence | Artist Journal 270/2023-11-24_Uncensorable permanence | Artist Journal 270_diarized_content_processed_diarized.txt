00:00:04.400 - 00:00:34.064, Speaker A: We have made it to another Friday. It is Black Friday. It is the Thanksgiving Day weekend, as you can see here. Maybe you can guess who this is. Can you guess? Artist Journal, November 24, 2023. Broadcasting from an unusually sunny Berlin, Germany, outside as well as inside. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back to the show.
00:00:34.064 - 00:01:21.358, Speaker A: I think it will be a shorter show than usual just because I'm kind of taking it easy a little bit with the weekend here and feeling the holiday vibe, although we don't really celebrate it here in Germany and in Canada, my roots there, some of my roots, we don't really. We celebrate Canadian Thanksgiving, but, you know, we also celebrate there are you know, it's often in Canada, it's an excuse to bring out the turkey, as I was mentioning in our spaces this week, which almost felt like a bit of a holiday. Spaces. You're starting to feel it. I'm starting to feel it. The antennae, the cultural antennae is, I think Ezra Pound called them antennae. Artists or poets have the antennae, so to speak.
00:01:21.358 - 00:02:02.720, Speaker A: Shall we look that up very quickly? Can you guess who this is? Gloom tube. Then if we can, we'll bring up chat GPT and see if ezra do a search on Ezra pound and antennae. So let's look at gloom tube quickly, though. So I love this piece, and I think a nice mental exercise sometimes is just to imagine this as a big canvas in a gallery and what that would look like and what, you know, and kind of just to reframe it a little bit. And I just think it's, you know, it's not the most actually, it's a fairly I was going to say it's not the most complex composition. It's not the most complex piece. But I just like what it represents.
00:02:02.720 - 00:02:43.826, Speaker A: I think it's funny. I think it's really consistent with what the artists, you know, with die with the most likes and gloom tube, who this is, you know, the great chroniclers of the, you know, for, you know, I put in quotes the great chroniclers of the american dystopia, you know, and, you know, I was going to say no judgment. I guess there is judgment in that. But just as a descriptive term, to just try and describe, you know, these ultimately, I describe them both as, you know, satirists of a certain kind. I mean, you see it in the humor here. Turkey meal, although I'm not sure this is food. Don't eat, 5551.
00:02:43.826 - 00:02:59.316, Speaker A: Don't eat, you know, made with real Hexane. I wonder if. Is that the stuff that puts you to sleep with turkey or maybe that's some sort of preservative. I'm not even sure. It doesn't even look like turkey. But you do start to see some slices with some gravy here. That's the COVID banquet.
00:02:59.316 - 00:03:38.026, Speaker A: 50% off. Frozen dinner. The exact antithesis of, in a sense, the turkey dinner, the spending, the grand banquet. And here it is, this sad banquet here, turkey meal, which is probably an ironic title, right? And a warning really, to not eat this thing, this, you know, box of preservatives and artificial so called food. 50% off. And, you know, probably, you know, this is the sort of thing you're going to see today, right, Black Friday. Because Thanksgiving Day has passed, now we got to get rid of all our stock.
00:03:38.026 - 00:04:03.386, Speaker A: So a pretty smart piece, like when we consider this purely as visual communication, there's actually a surprising amount going on, you might say, for a coupon of a turkey meal, right. But it's so pretty sophisticated stuff. I would say. So. Gloomtube, only seven tazos giving thanks. Gloomrican dreams. And there are still 13 left.
00:04:03.386 - 00:04:22.494, Speaker A: And this was probably minted, I imagine, Black Friday morning. So here we are, 50% off. Get it while you can. That is almost at 50% off. So with the. This is almost like the Thanksgiving Day episode here. I quite like this Alex Gray, of course, the visionary artist.
00:04:22.494 - 00:05:05.412, Speaker A: We looked at his work yesterday and I think last the episode before that, his new work that he released. And I thought this actually, I've never seen this Alex Gray work here before. He made a post and got, again, 30,000 views. And I always think it's interesting. Famous artist for decades, you know, arguably the most famous and maybe it's not even a debate, the most famous visionary artist in the world. A lot of people in this scene are getting comparable attention on x and I think that's significant. And if you're ever kind of getting down on the situation or whatever, just remember, like even if you're getting 1000 or 800, I mean, you're.
00:05:05.412 - 00:05:33.014, Speaker A: You're kind of still in the ballpark here. Like you're still in the game. And it's not like Alex Gray is getting 300,000 every post and whatever. So I think it's just important for us to remember that. But the more important thing I wanted to look at here is actually the message, which I thought was really interesting. And actually I didn't plan this. But we have the William Blake book here, as many of you, I'm sure have seen in previous episodes.
00:05:33.014 - 00:06:07.384, Speaker A: This is, you know, this is a visionary statement here. Gratitude is heaven itself. William Blake, british visionary artist and mystic poet. You know, another I quite, you know, carefully worded here, I might add. In these simple, profound words, Blake encapsulates the transformative power of gratitude, suggesting that it is not just a virtue, but a gateway to a heavenly existence. So actually, this is a new Alex Gray here as well. 2023 angel brush.
00:06:07.384 - 00:06:39.976, Speaker A: I'm very sympathetic to this. And gratitude, you know, in a sense, like, in a sense, it doesn't come easy. I'd argue that state of mind and maybe it's something you kind of can learn about in visionary states here. I did, and I'm really sympathetic. This is not just a virtue, but a gateway to a heavenly existence. Thank you. Right.
00:06:39.976 - 00:07:14.314, Speaker A: Thank you. So brilliant commentary and message from the great Alex Gray. And thank you for the messages from, like, look at this. To me, it's always a sense of wonder and amazement and delight to get the artists who I discuss in this journal replying here. So thank you to Heidi Rockette. Thank you for the very, very nice message. And sent me a couple of works, too, including this one here.
00:07:14.314 - 00:07:44.140, Speaker A: So a big thanks all round over here. And also, Lily, illogical. This was quite interesting. And thank you for the comment. And this was really interesting, her comment on this work here, because it did feel like a bit of a breakthrough work compositionally with this, you know, frankly, what looks like another composition at the bottom, you know, fifth of the canvas. Right. So she actually had something to say.
00:07:44.140 - 00:08:12.088, Speaker A: Lilly had something to say. I'm really proud of this work. It marks a more confident me, compositionally speaking. I think one year ago, I would have edited out this lower frame, this part right here that appeared when out painting. But how superb that it appeared like it did. And it made him even more a king stud, which I think is part of the series here, sitting like a cornerstone on his throne atop of his castle. Much love for the great episode.
00:08:12.088 - 00:08:55.606, Speaker A: Thank you, Lily. And I think that's kind of a delightful thing. And part of the fun of this enterprise, this traveling the ship in the sky, this pirate ship in the sky, going through space here that we've embarked on, is we actually do see artists develop because we're actually paying attention over time. Lilly's probably put out hundreds of works, or at least made hundreds or thousands of works, released me, I'm assuming at least 100 in the last year. And that is a breakthrough, you know, and again, these are the kind of breakthroughs that happen. I would argue with this is like the hard one experience. It's kind of back to hard one experience, and then you've made a million of these things.
00:08:55.606 - 00:09:36.306, Speaker A: And then maybe, you know, first of all, it's putting the time in, and then you'd get a result like this, a random result. And then there's the. The mental sensitivity to be able to recognize that you shouldn't correct this one to accept this gift of what happened here compositionally, you know. So really interesting commentary from Lily. Thank you for sharing that. I'm back to the. And I don't over dwell on this, as I keep saying, but I was just, I posted a 808 and I'm just so excited about this stuff that I'm sharing it with you.
00:09:36.306 - 00:10:06.362, Speaker A: And a lot of other people seem to be kind of excited. And this is kind of what I wanted to show you. So I did this 808 and look at how delightfully small this is. And we're going to contrast it with RJ, who has just inscribed because he took a different strategy. So just a reminder, you know, like this is maybe 200 by maybe 250 by 200. Because again, a Google Ad goes about to 300 here, right? So it's something like this, a Google Ad. So it's a little smaller than a Google Ad.
00:10:06.362 - 00:10:52.564, Speaker A: But again, as I was discussing yesterday, you can make it infinitely large to any dimension as long as you do nearest neighbor in Photoshop, it will retain the crisp edges. If I do magnify here, it won't because it's just a 200 pixel file. But if you do it properly, like in 1000 years, should bitcoin still be around, that thing will be able to be magnified. And there's something about this, like I was listening to an ordinal space and what did they call it? Uncensorable permanence. And they're discussing how this could be appealing to artists. And I totally agree. Like, there is something kind of magical when you kind of inscribe on the bitcoin blockchain.
00:10:52.564 - 00:11:30.406, Speaker A: There's something more permanent feeling about it being the widest network, the most decentralized, the original crypto, the largest market cap, so to speak, the most money kind of invested in whatever that thing is. There's something kind of magical about inscribing your work on it. So here is RJ on bitcoin. So discussing recent works, and this is pretty interesting series, I'm sort of scanning and checking out. This is a new on object, interesting kind of concept here. Still kind of figuring it out on Ethereum. I love this idea too.
00:11:30.406 - 00:11:53.054, Speaker A: As I'm starting to make more work here, I'm starting to think the same thing. And it's like, where's your Solana? RJ on Ethereum. I love this. This is the glory, really, of being multi chain on object, on Tezos, on Ethereum, and on bitcoin. Got a lot going on here right now. Look at the works. So, of course, I'm incredibly interested in this right now.
00:11:53.054 - 00:12:07.496, Speaker A: Shadows of the system. Interesting title. Dithered pixel paintings. Love that one of one on ordinals and going for 0.01 BTC. So, of course, bitcoin's at about 35,000. So 0.01
00:12:07.496 - 00:12:31.660, Speaker A: is about $350 each. And I actually. And here it's on magic Eden. So using magic Eden as well. And here are the two works, and we're actually going to look at them on Magic Eden, but just to give you taste here. So, two colors. What was incredibly interesting, and here it is on Magic Eden, what was incredibly interesting is the size.
00:12:31.660 - 00:13:05.298, Speaker A: Like, RJ took a different strategy. Say, for me, I'm going 220 pixels, but say with the 808, the TR 808, there are several colors, so I can put more colors. But if you go monochromatic, like the first one I did was three colors, then you can make it bigger. Now, these are pngs, interestingly. And look at how big RJ makes it. Okay, so this is interesting, right? But only two colors, right? And I think sometimes a. I think sometimes a PNG can be smaller than a GiF.
00:13:05.298 - 00:13:32.112, Speaker A: Like, I like, I look at both the GIF and the PNG, and there's also PNG eight, which can be smaller. I'm kind of more hesitant to use PNG eight just because it's not as common of a format, I don't think. But. But I assume every browser that can open a PNG 24 can open a PNG eight. So just to give you some info here. So I saved this to my desktop. Just I right click saved it to see how big it is.
00:13:32.112 - 00:14:03.900, Speaker A: And it is about 5 kb, maybe slightly less than 5 kb. So around the same size as that first work I did, the SH 101 big shout out to Luke 500 for picking that up. So, which is about, you know, the price here, because as you see, this was 36.59 to mint it. And then there's probably about $12 on top to, uh, for the bitcoin network fee in order to put you in line into who gets served first. So that's about, you know, $48. So it's about yours.
00:14:03.900 - 00:14:46.924, Speaker A: You see the $10 per kilobyte sort of metric. It looks like that's what it cost RJ as well. So really interesting to dig that up and just to see. And again, I find this inspiring because it makes me go, oh, maybe I can go small file size, but larger canvas and try that out. So I find it just to be a very exciting and delightful challenge. A delightful challenge to mint on bitcoin, trying to get with these incredibly low, like, look at what's coming out of here to get these incredible, incredibly low file sizes to make interesting images with comments on yesterday and thank you. I was surprised on Twitter.
00:14:46.924 - 00:15:06.940, Speaker A: I mean, there's almost. There's probably 12,000 now. Is that 11,800? When I looked, I did not expect that for Thanksgiving views. I did not expect that for Thanksgiving day evening. You know, when I minted, sorry. When I published that video on Twitter, I figured it'd get maybe 5000. So anyways, thank you for the support again.
00:15:06.940 - 00:15:55.810, Speaker A: So here's Evelyn with a really interesting comment regarding Sabato to a museum or another Picasso show. So I was discussing last episode, if you weren't there, do we need another Picasso show? I kind of want to see a sabbato on the wall. I was saying, for example, you are completely right. The museums have a difficulty highlighting what is actually going on. But they are all schooled through traditional, they're all schooled through trad art, so it's hard to make them interested. And, you know, I agree with that. And I can speak as someone who kind of, you know, I, so to speak, like, you know, what I love kind of started with the tradition and I was very slow to kind of dig crypto art.
00:15:55.810 - 00:16:38.114, Speaker A: And you know what I'd loosely call crypto art or art on the blockchain, which is actually different, as we've discussed many times. It's not easy. It takes a lot of time and frankly, it takes a lot of investment of time. And you have to expose yourself to things that you might not think are that great. At first, this is what happened to me on object, and I just kind of kept coming back. And then I'd find one thing that I thought was kind of cool. We were discussing this yesterday with the kind of discovery of Haiti Rockette and how that kind of, in my own mind, kind of it felt like it gave the tezos and the NFT, seeing a kind of credibility of sorts was sort of how I was just kind of feeling about it.
00:16:38.114 - 00:16:54.606, Speaker A: So I understand why it might be slow because you actually have to invest time and open mindedness and you're not going to like it at the start and you're not going to understand. You're going to be overwhelmed. Right. It's like learning a new language. It's quite overwhelming. Right. And there's.
00:16:54.606 - 00:17:35.830, Speaker A: You just feel like you know nothing. Right. So I'm sympathetic to the situation. I think it is hard, and I think that's worth noting, that it's hard. They want to make another Picasso show that shows Picasso in a new light, because that's what they know, right? They are school, so why not pair classics with new art? I once wrote about Skye Goodman's collection, accidental pixels scenes, and how they were the cezannes of our time. They were both landscapes, so it's quite easy to see the brush, and their experience through life is different, but there are so many similarities. Also, I think that is, in a sense, that's part of what we do on this show here.
00:17:35.830 - 00:18:08.766, Speaker A: And. Yeah, like, I think the way to kind of understand what we're seeing, say, with digital art and the blockchain, is to turn to the tradition and then start doing these comparisons. So I think this is exactly. I think you're exactly. That is exactly the way, Evelyn, that you're doing here. I completely am sympathetic with that approach. So what would be needed is to have an intendant or a curator at Louisiana or Whitney or whatever to get interested in the art we are making.
00:18:08.766 - 00:18:33.714, Speaker A: It's not completely outerworldly, as shown with Skye and Cezanne. If they can. If they can see that, then they can place our art in context of the history of art. And when that happens, we become relevant and an integral part of art history. Indeed. And I am oftentimes, not always, I should probably do it more. I'm oftentimes trying to contextualize what we're doing here in the context of the tradition.
00:18:33.714 - 00:19:36.504, Speaker A: And that, to me, it's a way in for also people who are not familiar with what we're doing. And what's interesting is, like, I see the frailty when we see these, you know, esteemed institutions like the Whitney, you know, or Louisiana. I know their YouTube channel or whatever, as you say, the fact that they're not hip to what's going on here. To me, it just shows the limitations of these institutions, you know? So, to me, it's just more evidence that these institutions are much more frail from an intellectual perspective, which, at the end of the day, is the perspective that's going to survive the test of time. To me, it shows frailty, you know, like an overly sophisticated art world that's over. It's top heavy, as they say, you know, and it's just kind of, it's just very top heavy. Too many careerists.
00:19:36.504 - 00:20:32.650, Speaker A: It's just so I, that, that's my explanation as to why they haven't quite figured it out when they hear blockchain also, and it gives all this, you know, assumptions come to work, especially if you don't know it. And then everything is people, or x copy is maybe the references and bored apes, bored ape yacht club. And they go because it's oftentimes that is the reaction I will get if I'm explaining, you know, that I'm into NFT digital art on the blockchain, people will be like, but doesn't that art suck will be their kind of response, you know? And yeah, it's just because they're not aware, I suspect, and it's not easy to become aware because open mindedness is maybe not as easy as it sounds. So it sounds like you're things. Sounds like we're thinking along the same lines. Evelyn, thank you for the comment. And of course, Evelyn, signing here, thank you for doing that because I wasn't sure who had written that.
00:20:32.650 - 00:20:43.242, Speaker A: So I appreciate you signing that. Big shout out and happy Thanksgiving. Evelyn. Human boy, happy Thanksgiving and thankful for you. Pokebelly, great episode as always. Thank you. Human boy, thank you.
00:20:43.242 - 00:21:03.496, Speaker A: And Skomra, thank you for the comment as always. And Elliott Smith, it was a pity to sell Bill Gates. I wonder if that was a one of one. I didn't look, I couldn't find it. Like, I did a quick look on Wasteman Goldman's page, but I didn't see the Bill Gates right away. So I think it was an older one. Strange thing is very cool indeed.
00:21:03.496 - 00:21:52.704, Speaker A: Thank you, Elliot. Now I just thought because dreams are kind of an important subject in regard to what we're doing, as I like to say, broadcasting from inner space. Right. And this was just kind of interesting and I just want to touch on it, but interestingly, and I think it shows something interesting, which is, okay, there's new research, fascinating new theory on dreaming from observing a deep neural net. So basically applying, saying like that, the, you know, let's just look at a tiny bit of this. Dreaming remains a mystery to neuroscience, right? And you see the limits of science in things like dreaming or inner space. You literally see the limits of science because there's nothing they can measure.
00:21:52.704 - 00:22:53.546, Speaker A: There's, it's, it's qualitative. It's like, and what's your memory? You can't measure a memory. You can't measure a dream, right? So you start, see, you know, consciousness really does, is a bit of a demarcation zone, I would argue a limit of the scientific enterprise. They try, but they are just, they just don't have the tools, one could argue. So, continuing here, dreaming remains a mystery to neuroscience. While various hypotheses of why brains evolved nightly dreaming have been put forward, many of these are contradicted by the sparse, hallucinatory and narrative nature of dreams, a nature that seems to lack any particular function. Recently, research on artificial neural nets has shown that during learning, such networks face a ubiquitous problem, that of overfitting to a particular dataset, which leads to failures in generalization, failures in generalization, and therefore performance on novel datasets.
00:22:53.546 - 00:23:58.260, Speaker A: So finally here, notably, the techniques that researchers employ to rescue overfitted artificial neural networks generally involve sampling from an out of distribution or randomized data set. The overfitted brain hypothesis is that the brains of organisms similarly face the challenge of fitting too well to their daily distribution of stimuli, causing overfitting and poor generalization. So all to say, and here's the final line, by hallucinating out of distribution sensory stimulation every night, the brain is able to rescue the generalizability of its perceptual and cognitive abilities and increase task performance. So ultimately saying, we see this problem with AI, with generalizing, right? Another kind of, you know, when you're applying for jobs, people are like, you'll say, oh, I'm a generalist. And then that sort of scene is not a good thing. You need to be a specialist, right? So interestingly, it sounds like with AI, they're having problems with generalizing. Interestingly, which is kind of a philosophical enterprise, it's comparison, its similarities.
00:23:58.260 - 00:24:27.294, Speaker A: It's able to see similarities across different idea sets. You could argue. And then you say, oh, well, we can say this. You're generalizing in most cases involving these idea variables, we can say this. And so, you know, in a sense, another way of putting this is AI is poor at philosophy. That is another kind of way. I would kind of, that's the message I start to get out of this.
00:24:27.294 - 00:25:11.666, Speaker A: And so they're saying maybe, you know, dreaming, and they're starting to put AI comparisons to the brain comparison, and they're saying maybe dreaming as a kind of helps with generalization. Interesting theory, but just interesting. Okay, so I'm just noting that because we are in the business of inner space as we're discussing the business of the infinite, right? So dreaming matters to us. I would argue it should. Continuing on, Jerry Salt. So as things, you know, I think it's a great theme. Should more kind of come out on that, which I will follow.
00:25:11.666 - 00:25:27.650, Speaker A: Jerry Saltz. I do not like the work. So I guess Jerry Saltz felt like he didn't make his point last time and wasn't clear enough. So here. Jerry Saltz on Thanksgiving. Was this Thanksgiving. Jerry Saltz says it again.
00:25:27.650 - 00:25:43.822, Speaker A: I just bluntly, I do not like the work of Rafique Annadol, and I have said exactly why I love AI art. So. And it's not because it's AI. I love all AI. It's just for feek anodles. I love all tools and technologies. I merely criticize it.
00:25:43.822 - 00:26:01.964, Speaker A: An artist's work for what does their. What for what does with their materials and tools. Good for you that you love it. I find it mediocre. And again, there is actually no. There is no critique here. It's just saying I don't like it.
00:26:01.964 - 00:26:43.734, Speaker A: Which for, you know, arguably the most renowned art critic in the world, you know, there should probably be at least a little bit of substance, however. And here, of course, is the work. And again, you know, I didn't. I've never seen the work in public. But again, what do I see when I see this? I do see the institutions. So I'm not totally unsympathetic here, to Jerry Saltz's view, but I don't like how he's presenting it, and I don't think he's presenting it in a credible way, despite him being at the top of the totem pole of, you know, opinions on art, at least among some people, at least among the mainstream, shall we say. And, okay, I take your point.
00:26:43.734 - 00:27:15.888, Speaker A: Now, what I found kind of strange is there, again, we're kind of back to this response by Rafiq Anadal, which went kind of viral in its own way. So Rafiq answers. Your words have no meaning to me. Jerry Saltz, you never talked to me, never visited my studio, no idea who I am, why, and how I create art. But let me tell you, I create my work from my heart. And to learn it, if you have to work, you have to research, you have to talk. The world you coming from is change.
00:27:15.888 - 00:27:26.944, Speaker A: New world is bright. New world is inclusive. New world has no gates. I'm my community. I do art for everyone. Anyone, any age, in any culture, I'm everyone. You're no one.
00:27:26.944 - 00:28:01.912, Speaker A: So kind of a. I guess we could call that a. I mean, if we had to pontificate here as observers on this situation, maybe a bit of an emotional response, understandably, we could say. But what kind of disappoints me about the response is actually the same thing that disappoints me about the criticism is, where's the meat here? Where's the substance? Where's the. Okay, I made an 808, and the reason I made the 808, Jerry, is because that you don't like is because I'm playing with different kinds of dithered brushes. I. You know, the 808 on.
00:28:01.912 - 00:28:26.902, Speaker A: On the BTC blockchain works for me. The black is the color of the drum machine. And so I decided to make that the background in order to reduce lines and to make a better. You know, all that. Where's all that stuff? Right? And I'm just making that up right now. Like, so that's my. You know, so it kind of feeds into Jerry's point, like, what's here? You know? So I kind of.
00:28:26.902 - 00:28:51.226, Speaker A: You know, I just watched from the sidelines here, but I. On both hands, and again, I see the frailty. I see frailty in. Because this was at moma, right? And here's, like, the top art critic, the most famous art critic, here's the top AI artist. Apparently, I see frailty everywhere. That's what I see. So, continuing on, salawaki, your words have no meaning to me.
00:28:51.226 - 00:29:14.842, Speaker A: Santiago, you never talked to me, never visited my studio, no idea who I am, why, and how I create art. But let me tell you, I create my work from my heart, and to learn it, you have to work, you have to research. And that's a whole other thing. You know, I shouldn't have to do a ton of research in order to understand art. And I would say with rafique anodols, you actually don't need to do a ton of research. And I don't know. Again, there's using a lot of art history in his work.
00:29:14.842 - 00:29:42.394, Speaker A: Apparently, that's kind of being reformatted and everything. So, I mean, I think there's even a defense that could be made if I was his kind of PR guy. It's like, Rafiq, we can do this. We can defend this, you know? So, anyways, this kind of went viral and kind of funny. And shout out to Salawaki, Alan survey. I can't remember how I came across this feed, but he's got a lot of good stuff, by the way. He's a good follower.
00:29:42.394 - 00:30:06.132, Speaker A: So back to the frailty of the institutions. A letter from Manuel Boria Villel and Vasif Kourtun regarding documenta 16. What was once a site of experimentation and autonomy is becoming a site of control. So, documenta, I'm not sure if it's every five years or every. I think it's every five years. There's one that's every ten years, I think, and one every five years in Germany. And.
00:30:06.132 - 00:30:22.784, Speaker A: Or at least it's kind of loosely based in Germany, I think. Yeah, documenta. Jm Beha is the guy. M Beha would be the German there, which is kind of like a german corporation. So documenta is german. It's something I heard about when I first moved here. I think it's every five years.
00:30:22.784 - 00:31:02.826, Speaker A: I think there's another one maybe in 21. And I just wanted to show just a couple of things here, which is. So here's the letter. It's on eflux, a popular kind of PR art website. Documenta has been the reference of the art world for decades, marking the spirit of our times. And I thought about that just very quickly on documenta. If you ask the person on the street, like, what document is probably in Germany, let's say, in Berlin, which is pretty arty, I'd say probably maybe 10%, if you're lucky, if people are going to hear of documenta, and how many percent will actually have been gone to documenta, you know, let's say half of that would be very generous.
00:31:02.826 - 00:31:27.934, Speaker A: That's 5%. And then how many people enjoyed the document or felt like it? I think this is all to say, this is another institution that people are playing up, marking the spirit of our times. I mean, oftentimes, and nothing against documented, but you'll see, like, it's almost like Richard Serra type rectangles made of metal. I think there's a lot of sculpture. I don't know if it marks the spirit of our times. Like, I. Not for me.
00:31:27.934 - 00:32:09.182, Speaker A: Okay. And maybe for other people. And then, so here, there's kind of this infighting within the contemporary art world here, documented as more of a symptom of a plagued Europe than anyone else, and kind of how it's become politicized, increasingly evident that culture and cultural institutions have become a battleground which the illiberal forces are ready to conquer. The attacks against the last document and the counteraction to reorganize its governance proves so. So politics, political infighting, interestingly, is starting to kind of gobble up, you know, the contemporary art discourse here. And so just kind of interesting here. And again, I.
00:32:09.182 - 00:32:28.518, Speaker A: You know, my take is I don't put that much. I don't put as much faith. And, like, I'm. I'm not bitter. I'm not in documenta, because I don't really care about documenta. I mean, that's my little Friday rant here. So Manuel and Vasif, like, you know, stop giving away your power, is what I would say to manual and Vaseev.
00:32:28.518 - 00:32:58.126, Speaker A: Like, if documenta is becoming irrelevant, then document, then documenta is becoming irrelevant. Why are you so desperately trying to be a part of it and complain? But whatever. I mean, maybe it's my views that are kind of, you know, the weird ones here. Moshit, though, I think, has the right spirit. It's fun to create and share as many things as I want and earn some money from it. Thank you, Zora. Like, I'm kind of more along Moshit's sort of feeling here.
00:32:58.126 - 00:33:31.260, Speaker A: This is kind of where I'm at. It's like, hey, cool. I'm actually making art and a bit of money. And frankly, I think that's much more in line with the spirit of the tradition, frankly, which was very entrepreneurial. Again, the Medici were bankers, okay? And that's kind of important. So I think Moe's got the right idea. Stippin pixel, do you have an original, physical tornado Rodriguez drawing? And so, of course, we remember that work here by tornado.
00:33:31.260 - 00:33:51.194, Speaker A: So here is a physical. And I thought it was just really nice drawing here and maybe just a clue into tornado's process. I'm not sure which came first. And there's the signature there. I assume this came first. So very cool. And you see the kind of the cross lines here and everything about it, you know, with.
00:33:51.194 - 00:34:20.874, Speaker A: I don't know if that's a sheep or a dog, but whatever it is on the right here, just a cool drawing from stippin pixel. So people are having fun hanging out. Here's Yoao Salazar with some works in progress. A little clue here, acrylic colors. And here, I'll show you another clue. So, remember, I wasn't sure if this was kind of sculpted first and painted after or if it was just painted with a lot of medium. I think what we see here in this beautiful, smart TikTok, very, very smart.
00:34:20.874 - 00:34:49.202, Speaker A: And probably Instagram reels getting the work out there. So you see here, there is our clue. So it is. It's kind of like the art matter method to a certain degree. Sculpting first and painting later, interestingly, or coloring later to great effect here, I might add. And huge fan of Yoao, and just very interesting. Cool, you know, Internet themed artist, oftentimes, just a big fan of Yoao's work.
00:34:49.202 - 00:35:11.054, Speaker A: Big shout out and happy thanksgiving. Check this out. So procreate dreams has come out. Gora Gora, that fun artist, made a remake of this animation to test the new tools and procreate dreams. And we're gonna look closer here. And so here's the timeline. And I actually brought up the procreate Dreams website, but here I believe is the result here.
00:35:11.054 - 00:35:46.316, Speaker A: And you see the movement, an almost different movement, right? It kind of like almost like golitis, right, in the different animation speeds that really just gives it life. So interesting post by gora. So here it is, procreate Dreams has come out. And I didn't know anything about procreate dreams other than that it was coming out. It's an all new animation app packed with powerful tools that anyone can use. Create engaging hand drawn animations, motion graphics and enhance them with photos, videos and sound. And let me show you something if I can find.
00:35:46.316 - 00:36:11.268, Speaker A: I think it's here. Is that. Oh yeah, replay. Check out this video of so, of how it works. See that? You just drag it with your hand. So making animation a much simpler, you know, affair, right, in terms of this kind of animation. And so what that tells me is procreate, you know, brilliant product.
00:36:11.268 - 00:36:53.040, Speaker A: People like whoever product manager at Procreate is brilliant, they've really done a great job. So another procreate, and I don't think it's a subscription, I haven't tried buying it, but I have a feeling it's just a one time purchase, which is really smart and just really cool. I didn't realize they had several other apps. Procreate pocket I do have actually I did know that and this is hilarious. So Ed, Marilla, what's the commentary? Trying to procreate dreams be like? So just so you can see what the artists are going to do, they're just going to go nuts here. So this is hilarious. It'll be really interesting.
00:36:53.040 - 00:37:19.466, Speaker A: Of course, like with digital art, the software is your paintbrush. Okay, so we have a new brush set, so to speak. Very hilarious and interesting from Edmarrola Mech TxT. How does a small and casual online exhibition for monomech type specimen sound with figma sample video below. Not properly prototyped yet though. Viewers would have to download figma. You could just wouldn't have to nice.
00:37:19.466 - 00:37:43.038, Speaker A: You'd just do it through the browser, could prepare it all in a day or two. And I'll tell you what I like about this, and I think I would be curious about your opinion, pokebelly. And I'd more than happy to share my opinion. I'll tell you what I like about this. It gives you exactly what you want, at least in the prototype stage. Like, maybe I want a full screen. Maybe I want to be able to pause.
00:37:43.038 - 00:38:12.262, Speaker A: I almost want, like, these digital galleries again. I like the bells and whistles of the physical ar space, everything. But they're too cumbersome and too hard for me personally. And so I love this idea of just making it flat, forget about the 3d world. And I think this is. I think this has potential, is what I would say. And I like the foundation of this idea.
00:38:12.262 - 00:38:55.120, Speaker A: As a gallery. It is simple, it is easy, and then you just put a play pause button, a full screen button, and, you know, it's basically a slideshow, right? But maybe with fancier bells and whistles. So interesting. It looks good to me. More mech TXT, my first minted blind type. So even adding a performative element to this already pretty sophisticated, complex thing that we started looking at yesterday, in other words, drawing by writing. Okay, I understand that not everyone are into poems, let alone fonts and typography, but know that it's one of my fiery passions in life as much as pixel art.
00:38:55.120 - 00:39:33.606, Speaker A: And that's what's kind of scary about this, because it's scary in a good way, because mech is basically a font expert. So these things are starting to. So all of a sudden, mech is able to draw with fonts using the wingding or webding sort of font idea. And all of a sudden, you have these brilliant abstracts, so beautiful abstracts, which, I might add, could be easily screen printed. You color white paper with black or black paper with white paint. That'd probably be even easier. Maybe you make it a diptych, you put the text on one side, the image on the other.
00:39:33.606 - 00:40:32.082, Speaker A: Who knows? But this randomization, this glorious randomization that's going on here is noteworthy. It's very. Again, I would say it's sophisticated in a contemporary art sort of way, the way it's using randomness. Like, I think Rauschenberg and John Cage would approve of what's going on here, in a sense, like, this is kind of a prepared piano of sorts, in the John Cage, where put the rubber, you know, the eraser, the rubber band, the paperclip on the piano strings, so that you get these, you know, the prepared piano, so you get these weird. You don't know what's going to happen. I see kind of analogous to generalize what the AI struggles at to generalize. I see analogous things going on here in terms of using randomness to create art and Rauschenberg was a master of chance, just made beautiful things that you could never plan.
00:40:32.082 - 00:41:20.808, Speaker A: And again, I mentioned it before, if you don't use randomness in your work, you might think about it. What's beautiful about randomness? It doesn't always work, but when it does, it looks like genius, because you go, how did that person ever do that? And the reality is that person didn't think about it. They're using randomness, which will look like way more brilliant than what you've kind of spent a few months trying to figure out. So, again, just incredibly excited about this. So it puts a Robert Frost poem. It's just, you know, you can tell Mech's been working at an agency, and I think has his own agency with a partner. Like, this is someone who's constantly probably delivering to clients, right? And so, like, the execution is there and everything.
00:41:20.808 - 00:41:38.604, Speaker A: So, anyway, I don't want to go too far on this mech TXT edition of 20. So here's. I mean, only 23 tezos. I wish I had 23 tezos. Cause frankly, this feels like it could be a historic Nft. Maybe I'm wrong, but edition of 20, I could. I saw it at 15.
00:41:38.604 - 00:41:54.264, Speaker A: I was like, I need to sell something really quick so I can get some tezos in my wallet so I can pick one of these up. Might be essential for the collection here. Maybe I'll do that. Let's just see how many are left here. Okay. There's a few left. There are a few left.
00:41:54.264 - 00:42:15.656, Speaker A: Typed in Figma and screen recorded. Interesting. So using Figma as well. Interestingly, a couple of more experimentation. I mean, this is a person that works, like, full time and kind of out producing everybody here. Good night, good friends. I mean, this is quite remarkable.
00:42:15.656 - 00:42:55.000, Speaker A: And there's an elegance as well. Remember, we were talking about the elegance of small file sizes? There's an elegance to finding a process like, say, Warhol did with his process of screen printing. You know, random paint, you know, screen print, the black over top or the darker color, and all of a sudden, you have an image. Right? Like, I'm oversimplifying it, but you know what I'm saying here? You just get the sense that mech TXT could mint, like, 100 cool works a day with this process. And there's an elegance there, you know, so super interesting there. And this was on Instagram going multicolor. And again, you.
00:42:55.000 - 00:43:19.002, Speaker A: I just go, oh, yeah, you could just do different editions of this screen printing colored papers. Maybe you do a two color screen print on white paper. Doesn't matter. Again, look at that. So maybe you put the image at the top and then the text at the bottom and the image at the top almost makes a horizon of sorts. I mean, mechanical is. His brain's really working overtime here.
00:43:19.002 - 00:43:35.202, Speaker A: What looks like effortlessly. Happy thanksgiving for everybody. That celebrates it. Also from mech. So combining the pixel art with the Dos imagery here and just having fun here. Look at this. Tenno miking.
00:43:35.202 - 00:43:50.986, Speaker A: So look at this. This, my friends, is Ultima four or Ultima three, maybe. Maybe this is Ultima three. It says ultima here. So because I was like, I recognize this. You know, there's the castle. So this is glitched out.
00:43:50.986 - 00:44:12.420, Speaker A: I sent. I assume it's a glitch. Rom, this is awesome. This is something I've been wanting to do, frankly, is a glitch out. This looks like Ultima three based on the ship here and just the images at work. This is something I would like to do. Look at this snake here and everything, and the different, like it's an animated snake, so you get different kind of variation.
00:44:12.420 - 00:44:27.632, Speaker A: Two variations. There's a dragon. So just super interesting. One of one for 15. You know, my wallet is empty, otherwise I'd be jumping all over this stuff. Kareem safa, open edition, the fall. I think this is brand new.
00:44:27.632 - 00:44:48.324, Speaker A: It is November 23. Came out on Thanksgiving, the fall. Cool name, cool color, cool simplicity to it, cool animation, and almost like an asteroid of sorts, a meteor coming in. You can almost see extra. Really nicely done. You can almost see, like, little things coming off of it. It looks like a meteor, but who knows what it is.
00:44:48.324 - 00:45:06.320, Speaker A: Open edition on object. Here's muji on Zora. Corrupted satellite image or corrupted satellite. My piece for the collaborative drop halftone. So new muji on Zora, only one minted so far. 10 hours to go. Might be a small mint sale.
00:45:06.320 - 00:45:35.944, Speaker A: Not started yet, though. Interesting. Green ginger golden hour. Maybe it starts in 10 hours. Maybe that's what goes on. Green ginger golden hour. New pixel artwork with what looks like kind of a japanese temple gate and in the middle of what looks like at least a lake or kind of not sure, almost coming out of the water here, seemingly, and a bit of a interesting kind of just interesting color around and just almost like a sunset or sunrise or something.
00:45:35.944 - 00:45:55.176, Speaker A: Evening, maybe a sunny evening. Interesting piece here from green ginger, a duo. What a lovely view. I wish it stayed like this forever. The golden hour, which I wish I knew what that was. If we had more time, I would check Chet Shippy tea edition of 15 for five tazos, twelve left. And Haiti Rockette with a new work.
00:45:55.176 - 00:46:29.432, Speaker A: And this is actually on object here, I'm pretty sure, just another drawing. And I've been enjoying watching Haiti rocket's drawings. As someone who uses kind of a lot of sample and glitch techniques, this seems to be a drawing again, and we saw that with the beach view or the beach scene. And a couple of more on object here. Haiti Rocket GFX free. So just more, again, kind of seemingly using one image that gets kind of treated with this algorithm and pretty awesome. Again, there's an elegance in being able to just be so prolific and make interesting art.
00:46:29.432 - 00:47:09.604, Speaker A: I mean, this is what digital artists, when they kind of unlock a key in a process, all of a sudden they can make 100 works, potentially, and it's just a matter of picking your favorites and then releasing the top ten of those, the top three of those. Pretty interesting. Thanksgiving, Haiti rocket edition of ten. Now 200 tezos on secondary from Eli traders. So more just super cool. You know, in that skateboarding work yesterday, we had these giant pixels, and I love the giant pixels here because they contrast really nicely. The ones you'll see on the kind of behind the batmobile there, they contrast really nicely with these smaller ones at the bottom.
00:47:09.604 - 00:47:29.712, Speaker A: So kind of a nice contrast there. And just cool colors. Again, that wild line at the top that kind of gets glitched out. Really nice piece. Again, thanksgiving. Here's Silva sand twos with a glitch rom, vaporwave, cool subject matter and kind of vaporwave colors here, blue and violet. Interesting composition, size 218 frames.
00:47:29.712 - 00:48:13.764, Speaker A: And thank you, actually Silva, for the explanation, actually, on the glitch. I'll try and remember to bring that up next episode. Mason the third. This was a weird one. This looks like it's using generative art because I saw in here, see that generative, the first tag, sometimes you get kind of clues in the tags here, vertex, interweb browser. And it kind of almost reminds me very indirectly of popple using kind of pixel art with generative art and combining the two, that's kind of like a similar idea here using the glitch rom. But then generative art, what seems to be this fuzzy kind of light over top.
00:48:13.764 - 00:48:38.844, Speaker A: Interesting. Just experimentation here. Interesting title there, too. One of one for 50 tazos Glitchtown arcade, releasing a still of the work from yesterday, I believe, or at least from that session. Cool. Still here with the screen kind of blanked out a little bit and someone serving and the tennis guy in the court way down here. Interesting it looks like the whole court was moved down.
00:48:38.844 - 00:49:08.772, Speaker A: Interesting. Still here, this is for one Tezos edition of 25. There are nine left, and human boy decompress. And here we have basically an animated abstract with some cubes and just a cool animated abstract experiment made in gimp. And this is an edition of five. And this looks sold out or for sale. One to Aile, one to muerto de Prito and Mech TXT picking one up.
00:49:08.772 - 00:49:57.004, Speaker A: So again, you see how small this community is, and sort of to remember how Evelyn was saying, maybe they'll care about us if, you know, there's more comparisons with the traditional tradition and everything. I'm in no rush. Like, I have so much conviction on this scene and of the relevance of it that I almost say the longer they take to get involved, the better. Because then this thing keeps on growing and growing, and by the time they understand what's going on, in a weird way, I'm not against it being a little too late for them. They're going to have to be chasing this thing. And I kind of like that, you know, because they've been dictating to us for how long about what is great art. I kind of want to see them run and chase a little bit.
00:49:57.004 - 00:50:15.134, Speaker A: So again, an edgy Friday over here at Pokebelly's artist journal. Teo miking again. And I loved. So we saw one work by Teo miking earlier. Remember the ultima three, I believe it was. And here, ASCII Black Friday. So another Thanksgiving day work.
00:50:15.134 - 00:50:29.734, Speaker A: And I thought this was a great piece. I really enjoyed just the work itself. Again, some ASCII text. And there is Friday. So I like the topicality. Just like gloom tube at the start there. Dylan with a cool work, yin to yang.
00:50:29.734 - 00:50:49.206, Speaker A: So a digital drawing, and beautiful colors and textures here. And just another cool abstract. Usually these are like. Yeah, this is. This one was an open edition that finished and none were bought. So that's. Maybe this will be made one of one, because it's a nice piece.
00:50:49.206 - 00:51:02.020, Speaker A: Okay, it is. Now it's 15. So you missed. You see how. Remember I was saying, you know, those open editions, sometimes there's opportunities there. So that was a pretty nice one you could have got for three. Now you got to pay 15, but still a good deal.
00:51:02.020 - 00:51:40.860, Speaker A: Gozo digital collage by Gozo. And of course, using some stable diffusion, which I haven't, you know, I haven't tried stable diffusion in, like, six months here. But to great effect, we're seeing with Skomra and with gozo here, another really cool combination of digital collage, AI tools, and just everything kind of partly, you know, kind of looks like a train here, but not super clear. Kind of looks like a landscape. Just really cool, as usual. Nice colors, as usual, I might add the exchange cool, enigmatic title available for 15 tezos. This was just minted.
00:51:40.860 - 00:52:08.736, Speaker A: It's probably gone by the time you check, but you can check the myth, the tragedy garden. I thought this was going to be a short show. We'll speed up a bit here. So another kind of older myth, that myth minted here. And I think there's an edition of ten for six tazos, a couple of characters that he does on the hoodie here. And kind of an interesting piece, this yellow sand, and then the clouds in the. It's kind of an outtake by myth here.
00:52:08.736 - 00:52:30.124, Speaker A: And the clouds in the pants, the tragedy garden. Cool title. And here, this is Yuri, another raw piece. I will show the finished version when you're all ready. So I brought up the tweet here because, remember, there was the piece yesterday that I was like, that almost looks like a Yuri J. But I think Yuri J. Was saying that it was rustic, but I think it was a trap.
00:52:30.124 - 00:52:59.358, Speaker A: Now. It was a trap, Adrian. Now, you know how my art looks like before I start to put textures on it, because it does almost look like a rustic digital art piece. Right? So that is funny. So kind of a clue into how Urij works, right? You kind of make the composition first, and as I've been saying here, then you fill in the outlines with different kind of patterning, and you kind of have a pretty cool work. So cool piece there. Looking forward to see the final version.
00:52:59.358 - 00:53:25.692, Speaker A: And here's rustic digital art, who's been putting out some very minimal works here. Interesting. Again, you know, characteristically bold experimentation here from rustic. And here you see basically what looks like an interior, maybe a woman on a bed or a sheet on the floor. And, yeah, just kind of like the table on the wall. Yeah. So just, it almost looks like goalposts here.
00:53:25.692 - 00:53:50.316, Speaker A: The lamp is part of the wall, so all sorts of impossibilities here, which are characteristic of three weeks or a year. Again, another impossibility. It's almost like, you know, a defining trait for rustic digital art is impossibility. What is that? You know, the surrealists loved the impossible. I think that was the name of something. The impossible. They were kind of.
00:53:50.316 - 00:54:13.944, Speaker A: Yeah, it's a fun theme, the impossible. We'll go back into that, the devil and I. So this is Pomelo. So shout out to Pomelo. So another painting here by Pomelo. An interesting, wild kind of composition here with this almost 45 degree angle where the wall meets the floor. Interesting composition here.
00:54:13.944 - 00:54:30.384, Speaker A: Almost dreamlike here. And then a guy in what looks like boxer shorts, cigarettes, talking to the devil. Almost like putting a ring on the devil. The devil and I. So there is a big explanation here. One Tezos edition of eleven. There are eight left.
00:54:30.384 - 00:54:51.088, Speaker A: Lewis Osborne, layers of emotion. So this is a new work by Louis Osborne on super rare. And so let's look at the layers of emotion. Always interesting here. Make sure there's no audio on that one. And so here you get the unhappy face at the bottom. Right.
00:54:51.088 - 00:55:12.228, Speaker A: So underneath it all, underneath all the smiles, is a sad blue figure. Very poetic here. A little bit of a biting commentary here, I would argue layers of emotion. Nice piece. Sophisticated work here. Mp 426 megabytes. And this, I think we missed, I think.
00:55:12.228 - 00:55:31.356, Speaker A: Get out of the way. I'm not positive, though. This is an edition of 25. This came out a week ago, a little over a week ago. And here, just some bouncing heads going down the street here. So more cool work. Oh, and then disappearing down the manhole there, down the sewer drain.
00:55:31.356 - 00:55:56.144, Speaker A: And there it begins again. Get out of the way. So pretty interesting work, this one. Unhygienic acrobatics. So just washing, you know, always kind of playing kind of like gloom tube and die with the most likes. I think you could put Turk rack as kind of like really kind of raw satirists here as someone cleans their foot in the sink. Almost looks like a kitchen sink here.
00:55:56.144 - 00:56:12.408, Speaker A: So edgy work here from Turkarak. Three tezos edition of ten. Nice animation, by the way. Like nice painting animation as usual. Maybe it's a bathroom because you can see the tiling there. Timothy Jullien, view side. Breathe deeper.
00:56:12.408 - 00:56:40.078, Speaker A: So continues to kind of add some texture in the sky here. Again, the black outlines have disappeared. So very interesting to see how Julienne Timothy Jullien develops here. Always interesting and always super affordable edition of ten at 70 tazo cents each. And a new, I guess the series is called native textures. Native textures by bosque grazias. Every rural day.
00:56:40.078 - 00:57:08.308, Speaker A: And let's just look closer here. So again, I think these are taken just from old negatives spliced together. And I wonder if it's someone who went to a museum and took a bunch of photos of the paintings. And now those are becoming, I think, the subject matter of Bosque Grazia's work here. Series made from slides found in a shed they proposed a meeting reformulating the possibilities of the format. So it's kind of beautiful, this repurposing. And it turns it into not just a picture of an artwork, it turns it into art.
00:57:08.308 - 00:57:34.546, Speaker A: And this beautiful treatment of the negatives is always original, as you will see here. I was like, oh, why didn't bossu keep the negative sort of thing? He did. He's just being edgy and saying, hey, we don't need to, like here, we'll just leave it out. Or you just put a little bit here. But if you look closely, you can see the kind of. The spool that the negative gets wound on, on the film is still there. And here, I mean, it's Rome.
00:57:34.546 - 00:58:03.326, Speaker A: And as we see the pantheon at the top and at the bottom, if you haven't seen the pantheon, if you've never been to Rome, I spoke to someone the other day that hadn't been to Rome. Who? Yeah, he was maybe in his fifties, and I just said to him, like, eric, you gotta go to Rome like you're in Europe. Here you're not. It's an 80 euro flight. So here we have the Coliseum in the middle here. Interesting juxtaposition. Kind of fun and really cool.
00:58:03.326 - 00:58:25.472, Speaker A: Kind of. There's buses in front of the pantheon here. There's one of the obelisks, right? I think Rome has maybe five obelisks, which is quite a few. And so just interesting piece here. Il pantheon del colosseo bosque grazias. Edition of five for fortezos. Very cool walk.
00:58:25.472 - 00:58:54.994, Speaker A: 916. Almost feels like a bible verse. But of course, this is the time, because I think this whole series, I believe just looking at the palette, for instance, it kind of feels like September 11. And there are other images that feel it more clearly, but you see almost the destruction here, and even the color palette. Interestingly, a one of one at auction, Koda Nakazono. And this is gone. So it's a really cool collab here.
00:58:54.994 - 00:59:19.214, Speaker A: Even the text, so. And look at this. I love how this, like, what looks like almost a cursor, almost like a live cursor or something, with this outline of a circle. Interesting contrast with this super 3d, you know, animated form here. Interesting background too. The white background I find pretty effective. Maybe there's a slight gradient from the bottom.
00:59:19.214 - 00:59:32.774, Speaker A: Like, ever so slight. Subtle piece. Nice piece. This is 24 on secondary. And let's just see what happened here. Sold out at ten tezos each for addition of 20. It's a nice work.
00:59:32.774 - 01:00:02.956, Speaker A: Mahu pixel, ganja, get high. So this is Ivan Hugo. So remember, we saw it was Sky Goodman who posted the video of the GLB and everything and saying, this artist is great. Well, Hugo sent me the link, I believe, or at least posted the link, and here it is. So here, I believe, is the painting that was being worked on, and now it's on exchange art. It is a solana work, and it is for sale for 1.2 sol.
01:00:02.956 - 01:00:35.484, Speaker A: So how cool is that? These VR oil canvases here, and almost got a classical sort of composition there to a certain degree, at least in the head and the neck and even the garments up to here, and then gets a little more unconventional. Interesting piece. Even some circuit board at the top there. Uh, interesting, interesting texture here, too. And speaking of texture, uh, Stefano Colferide, this is on, uh. Wow. Wow.
01:00:35.484 - 01:00:53.186, Speaker A: This. What is. Oh, the minimum bid is 400. I was gonna say maybe you could walk away with a one of one. This is, uh, Stefano, of course. We saw must be eight months ago. Remember that kind of 3d work on super rare of the person painting? And we started a show with one of those.
01:00:53.186 - 01:01:12.130, Speaker A: And here is a cloud. Another kind of like plasticine animation here with what looks like a cloud. And it's raining. Minimum bid of 400. Tezos, 5 hours to go. And Dernadler, another preview of what's coming to verse. The collaboration with verse is Anami Islands.
01:01:12.130 - 01:01:44.164, Speaker A: So again, you see Hakusai's wave seems to be a influence here and almost like a totally 3d feeling AI artwork, as far as I understand what's going on here, it's an AI artwork, two dimensional, but just looks 3d. Pretty cool. Nice colors there too, from Dernadler. Okot on the water, melodies of peace. So the global south series continues. And another beautiful painting here with these guys on a. There's all these people on little boats going off.
01:01:44.164 - 01:02:15.016, Speaker A: Interestingly, and what looks like, you know, some sort of jungle scene in the background in a beautiful sunset with beautiful water. Another interesting, cool painting from Okot 259 to go. Of course, this is strange thing. And this is a glass blower, if I'm not mistaken here. And really just another really cool work. What do we have here? I think it's GM art family. And yeah, he's a glassblower, so that is what is going on here.
01:02:15.016 - 01:02:27.768, Speaker A: So just more just putting out works every day. Multiple works a day. At least one work a day here. Moshino. Really interesting oil paintings coming from. Strange thing, AI oil paintings. This was hilarious.
01:02:27.768 - 01:02:49.172, Speaker A: Nickelback, Mikey Delacreme minted number twelve. And so this is Tiv, really ill is the Twitter. I made a collection of fake nickelback albums. If this joke resonates with you, I plan to run and run with it a bit, so you might want to grab one. They are affordably priced at 0.2 tezos. I could see this kind of.
01:02:49.172 - 01:03:09.338, Speaker A: It does have a meme type quality to it, doesn't it? Pretty hilarious, AI. Nickelback. I think they were out of Calgary, which is not too far from where I grew up, at a Saskatoon sky goodman Denver Nuggets. I thought this was a pretty cool work. This came out a week ago. I didn't see it. Pretty big file, I think.
01:03:09.338 - 01:03:34.504, Speaker A: Kind of has a trading card feeling to it, doesn't it? Like, it almost feels like one of those highlight trading cards, you know, Denver Nuggets won the championship, and that's kind of what this is. So, nice piece, sky. Very nice piece here. Again, if I was like, tops, I'd be thinking, oh, you know, that looks like something we'd do. And then we don't even need to pay the photographer. Or maybe you work with the photographer. Right.
01:03:34.504 - 01:03:49.476, Speaker A: Okay. Tuks with another beautiful AI painting here. Look at this. Just another new painting here. We are completely spoiled with wonderful artworks here every day. Tea and tangerine from tuques. Good morning.
01:03:49.476 - 01:04:04.504, Speaker A: So just another really cool work. There they are, 16,000. So shout out to Tuks. Happy thanksgiving to you and everybody. This was on the COVID of super rare is on the front page. Super rare. And I thought, wow, that is a pretty cool work by Besu.
01:04:04.504 - 01:04:26.824, Speaker A: And it looks like a physical. I don't have any information. Created and developed by brazilian artist Pedro Ribeiro. But I thought, a pretty nice work here, isn't it? I mean, I was even tempted to start, but I was like, oh, it's on the front page of super rare. Let them have it, so to speak. And they did the work and found this. So, anyway, beautiful, beautiful piece.
01:04:26.824 - 01:04:55.630, Speaker A: And here we're back to Bondozo Bandito, who seems to be incredibly prolific. I really like this artist. Just discovered last week, again, using the airbrush here for the outline and then just kind of filling things in seems to be. And, you know, just let it drip. When you're working this fast, you don't have time to think too much. And that can be a blessing oftentimes, like, nice change of color here. There's a benefit to working fast, and maybe here's the artist.
01:04:55.630 - 01:05:08.732, Speaker A: So you see how big this work is. Probably already done it. Working on to the next thing. Return to Castlevania, but alone. So cool title in concept two 2 meters by 2 meters. Nice piece. And that, my friends, is your show again.
01:05:08.732 - 01:05:15.404, Speaker A: Have a wonderful black Friday and a happy thanksgiving day weekend. Thank you for all the support. Until next time, take care.
