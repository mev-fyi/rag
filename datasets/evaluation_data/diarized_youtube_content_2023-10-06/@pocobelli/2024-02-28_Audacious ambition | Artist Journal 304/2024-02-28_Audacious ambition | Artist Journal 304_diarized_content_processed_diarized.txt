00:00:03.520 - 00:00:32.206, Speaker A: The neighbors must be thinking, there that guy goes again. He is starting to scream into his computer. Well, I wave all to all of you with my eyes here as we continue to sail forward on our one of a kind journey across the high seas of the imagination. Journey onwards. Artist Journal, February 28, 2024. Broadcasting from the editors desk on the pirate ship of the mind. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back.
00:00:32.206 - 00:00:55.822, Speaker A: And I am not joking. We have so much to go through here today. There is not much time. The time is nigh. Deadline approacheth as the Twitter space begins again in an hour and 45 minutes. And I do like to prep the people about a half hour before just check in, so to speak. Again, Luciana Guerra, I believe, out of Argentina.
00:00:55.822 - 00:01:49.808, Speaker A: We're going to find out great abstract artists. We'll talk about that in a second. This is Francois's Gamma, a beautiful minimal glitch rom by Francoise Gammer. One of the early artists you come across, or I came across, when I started discovering the art on the Tezos blockchain and started one of those early artists where you go that I came across, where I started to go, you know, that looks like art. You know, this isn't just a bunch of random digital images that I don't need to take seriously, you know, Francois Gamma, again, one of those accounts that you came across, you know, maybe found Haiti Rocket had collected one of Francois Gamma's works. And, you know, looking at Haiti Rockette's collection there and going kind of, there's something about this that feels like this kind of maybe. Maybe it's already even been in a gallery or museum.
00:01:49.808 - 00:02:06.116, Speaker A: And perhaps it has. You never know. There is such a huge output from Francois Gamma, I believe, out of Canada. Not positive. I want to say Montreal, but I actually don't know. Actually, I don't think so. Maybe it's out of Barcelona, actually, I remember thinking so.
00:02:06.116 - 00:02:26.148, Speaker A: I think it's actually out of Spain, where Francois Gamma is from, all to say, let's look at this work here. So this. Let me just do this. So what a beautiful. First of all, what a beautiful work. I mean, we come across a lot of glitch roms. We got a couple today, Glitchtown arcade and Sabato.
00:02:26.148 - 00:02:44.100, Speaker A: Sabato. With a pretty hilarious one, too, there on the Zora. So there's, you know, it's a genre almost. It's, you could call it a subdivision of glitch, right? Taking technology, repurposing it. We see it with. Let's glitch it. Donia, aka you know, circuit bending is another one.
00:02:44.100 - 00:03:16.434, Speaker A: Another one is taking, you know, glitch rom. Taking old rom software. Okay. The image came back, thank God. Taking old, you know, software and then kind of crossing the wires, so to speak. I believe so, you know, using it in ways that you want, you know, upsetting the code, I think, is what the glitch rom is doing, because you can start to muck around with the hexadecimal and all this sort of stuff. So that is what this is based off of, like, basically a sn 80 super Nintendo game, likely.
00:03:16.434 - 00:03:48.994, Speaker A: What I adore about this beautiful work is two things. First of all, actually, let's call it three. Why? You know, this just hit me like, it's one of those works that in less, in milliseconds, you just go, ooh, this is a nice one. This is a great one. And so there's that. There's also what I was discussing yesterday with Braindead's work, the passepartout, you know, which is actually the background color. But again, letting the work breathe here a little bit is an interesting device.
00:03:48.994 - 00:04:25.827, Speaker A: It's a completely. And forgive the computer, there's probably no TakE two Here. So we're just GoNna have to go with it. I will talk you through the glitches here, fittingly, in the actual technology that should be working. So there is the background color here and letting the work breathe. But maybe the most revolutionary act of this, again, we see a lot of glitch artists, or Rom glitch as, again, the genre of sorts, subgenre. We see a lot of glitch Rom artists, you know, try and make their poetry, so to speak, with this, in this genre.
00:04:25.827 - 00:05:05.736, Speaker A: And, you know, everyone brings their own approach. And what I love about this is how minimal it is. It's just, you know, it's almost. It's almost like, is that all it does? Right. But that's all it needs to do. And in that respect, what happens is it becomes basically like a kind of modern day abstract, right? It's kind of reminds you of the abstract expressionists to a certain degree. You know, you think of Rothko, you think of Pollock, you know, in terms of even, just like, the presentation of what is being asked of you as a viewer, what is being asked of you.
00:05:05.736 - 00:05:34.794, Speaker A: Look at these colors and this blinking light. You know, it's almost back to the abstract expressionist, you know, the surface of the painting. It was this movement. Again, could we call that a postmodern thing? Let's not go too far. And we have a lot to talk about here today, and we'll probably get back into that. But there was a movement towards the surface of the canvas. You could argue throughout, you know, from the 15th, you know, 14th, 12th, let's call it the 12th century with Giotto and Cimabue.
00:05:34.794 - 00:06:20.386, Speaker A: Let's start there for the sake of argument, you know, where they're doing kind of somewhat volume. And then we get total volume and space and proper perspective in the Renaissance. But then, interestingly, over the next few hundred years with impressionism, you know, a response to this almost academic style, it starts becoming about this rod just like it starts becoming about the paint on the canvas. Texture, you know, and texture was a thing up into that point. But we again, this kind of surface. And then from impressionism we go to Picasso. Surrealists are, you know, a mixed bag, but then we get abstract expressionism, where it's literally about paint on this object here and the surface of the canvas.
00:06:20.386 - 00:06:39.522, Speaker A: Right? So I'll just say I feel like a similar thing is being asked of me here. Don't look for a narrative. Don't look for a Nintendo game. Don't try and figure out what game this is. Just look at the pixels on the screen, the colors and how they dance together. And that's enough. So let's continue here.
00:06:39.522 - 00:06:54.690, Speaker A: So this is called ZX error only two tezos edition of 20. There are ten left, so that is great. So you can still buy that. There's another one here, too. ZX error two. This one sold out, interestingly. Oh, all to the same person.
00:06:54.690 - 00:07:19.230, Speaker A: You know, someone did this to Francois Gamma a while ago. I wanted to actually collect and now they're probably, they probably liked it so much. And now LibroBlock has been blocked out by this AnonymOUs Account here who decided they wanted to buy all 20. Error indeed. So all to say, let's not, let's not get distracted by that. Here's another one. I thought it was surprising that it had sold out.
00:07:19.230 - 00:07:44.598, Speaker A: I was actually going to pick one up. So all to say, another gorgeous, very minimal abstract glitch. Rom here bringing really FranCois GAmmA bringing their own, you know, style. And again, keeping that breathing space here. Interestingly, white background here would have been tempting to do color, but decided with white. So just very cool there. This one sold out.
00:07:44.598 - 00:07:56.764, Speaker A: ZX error two. And yeah, so there. And here's Francois Gamma's page. Of course, we've seen works like this. Like the walking person. This really interesting one we saw the other day. Extraordinarily prolific artist here.
00:07:56.764 - 00:08:34.616, Speaker A: Extraordinarily prolific, you know, and I think the wallet got hacked from fossils. Gamma. So there's a whole other account here that exists out there. I love these colored walking figures here. Look at how beautiful these are. And so almost axine colors there. So just a really interesting artist who seems, this is beautiful here, too, who seems to take, you know, a real digital artist and who, from what I can gather, you know, just my observations here, who really seems to, you know, make a thing.
00:08:34.616 - 00:09:12.360, Speaker A: Something that a lot of digital artists come across is you actually see a million different things you could mint along the way or works that you could turn into work and say, you know what, that one, that one, that one. And Francois GamMA actually seems to apply, oh, it seems to apply the, this logic, this digital art logic. We're gonna have to go with the camera here because to load everything up, we just don't have time and we need the show, so we need to do the show. It is late in the day. I am fresh from the dentist. Look how cool that is. So all to say, just taking a thing, not trying to almost make too much of it.
00:09:12.360 - 00:09:33.360, Speaker A: Here's the work. Boom. We have another kind of iteration, another kind of interesting, you know, digital piece and has almost an encyclopedia of work here. So super interesting here. And had actually posted a couple of interesting tweets recently. These are samples from, you know, Fantavision from Ms DOS 1988. So I believe this is a demo.
00:09:33.360 - 00:09:54.788, Speaker A: I mean, I wasn't sure at first when I saw this again, this is posted by Francois Gamma 32,000. Look at this. Nice move. Nice response here. And you see the bear, it looks like a false was gamma work hilariously. And this is, I believe, a demo sample animation from FantaVision MS DOS 1988. Pretty cool.
00:09:54.788 - 00:10:23.874, Speaker A: Here's another one. CGA mode, right? So just a super interesting artist again, I think out of Spain, out of Barcelona, if I'm not mistaken. And there is braindead. So here is Ponce Wa's gamma's account. And again, we saw some of these works. Just a super interesting, there's an autodesk animator, very interesting artists there as we get started. And just beautiful work.
00:10:23.874 - 00:10:52.208, Speaker A: So continuing on, Luciana Guerra on today's spaces. So if you're watching this, and it may, it's probably going to be uploading as that space is happening in a couple hours here. So should be a good one. And if you're already, if you're late, you can always listen to the replay. I'll likely have it on the pinned tweet there. So. And Luciana Guerra is going to join Rune tune and I, and of course, Luciana Guerra, who just posted this work here, makes a lot of these abstracts here.
00:10:52.208 - 00:11:08.226, Speaker A: This is from the super rare archives. Does a lot of physical and digital, so it should be a super interesting conversation here. Let's just look here. Visual artists on super rare VCA residency. Look at that. 8000 followers. Very good, Kalo.
00:11:08.226 - 00:11:39.966, Speaker A: So big shout out and thank you to Kalo. There's an episode now, which is great. I mean, Calo is such a consistent and just, you know, has really built something over, I think started, you know, six months or a year before I did Kaylo's podcast here. It was really nice to come on and it was just a really fascinating and just fun, great interview. And he's really professional. So that is available in the timeline somewhere or on Kaylo's feed. Give Kayla a follow.
00:11:39.966 - 00:12:07.524, Speaker A: Sign up to Kaylo's newsletter. It's really interesting and it's completely different angle on what's going on. And as I was saying here, it's about accounts. We're not in math or science land. People are giving different accounts, which means you want several accounts of what is happening out there in the larger blockchain. Digital art on the blockchain. Surprisingly high views here, usually YouTube here we're around 300, let's say sometimes 400.
00:12:07.524 - 00:12:24.208, Speaker A: This is pretty high. So I wonder if this was posted somewhere. Maybe it was Kalos podcast, but remarkable. So interesting new viewers coming here and let's look at the, let's look at the comments. Pure gold. At the very start of this journal, life is 100% about showing up. District four.
00:12:24.208 - 00:12:37.348, Speaker A: Six indeed. Thank you for the comment and glad you enjoyed that district. Tom Bimbattle, great artists. Thanks, Adrian. My pleasure and thank you for the support. Liquid mind art. Is this.
00:12:37.348 - 00:12:54.704, Speaker A: This might be Luciana Guerra. Thank you, dear Adrian, appreciate you. I think that's Luciana. I just asked her actually last, yesterday in the afternoon we had. I'm gonna be frozen. Maybe it's perfect that we're going to have glitching through this episode here. Just take it as art.
00:12:54.704 - 00:13:57.594, Speaker A: I'll mint this one on Zora. John Gates copying. So all to say, good to hear from you, Luciana. John Cates copying as a basis or foundational layer is a great way to say that art is an ongoing conversation. Right? And so this whole idea of where do we start? That is one of the hardest questions to ask because we were trying to make sense of this whole complicated question that Yuri J. Brought up on again, that AI should AI be trying to emulate oil painting or another way of framing it rather than should it, what does it mean? And so where do we start? So copying, you know, again going back, and I wish we had more time, maybe on Friday perhaps we will actually look up a little bit more kind of on the philosophical basis of what we're talking about here with chat. GPT but copying is, you know, mimesis, as we're discussing, seems to be right there at the foundation of what it is we're doing as artists on a basic level, at least for representational art.
00:13:57.594 - 00:14:25.552, Speaker A: So and again with abstraction, you start to is it copying? No, it's about it starts that was almost the revolution of abstraction, right? Because then it's about the paint on the canvas. We're no longer copying things, right? So, you know, adding to that conversation here. So thank you, John. Human boy, love this conversation being had here. I'll just say everything is conversation with what has come before. It's in our DNA and written in the cosmos. A copy of a copy of a copy.
00:14:25.552 - 00:15:15.084, Speaker A: Kind of a nice play on Gertrude Stein there. We all deserve to join the conversation, indeed. And we actually have another comment coming up on that from lonely boy, who is okay, so let's deal with one comment at a time here. We exactly. And, you know, so there was a point where people were like, you know, is and I'm not sure if they're referring to the show, but, you know, with the whole we'll tackle the next comment when it happens here. But everybody does deserve and I hope I never am implying otherwise, you know, and there are great, as far as everybody deserving to be in the conversation. Like some of the, you know, the surrealists at the end of the day are kind of where I grow out of as far as how I base myself and the surrealists intellectually as an artist.
00:15:15.084 - 00:15:57.518, Speaker A: And the surrealists were massive fans of what you might call folk art, you know, and they were champions of, you know, Henri Rousseau, as was Picasso early on. And, you know, who was often, you know, what sometimes it's called naive art. You know, folk art, which sometimes get is a I contrast what is folk art. Folk art, for me, just to help illuminate our discussion, is art that is not necessarily in conversation with the tradition. Okay? So that's how I distinct. That's how I consider something folk art. So all to say, these artists, there's a ton to value.
00:15:57.518 - 00:16:26.322, Speaker A: And I don't want to suggest that art with a traditional is somehow more important. It depends what game you're playing. If you're playing the game of the tradition. And then it is, in a sense, it becomes more significant within that conversation. But if you're just taking a step back, then someone like, you know, then it's hard to say. I mean, and we're trying to say a lot of things in few words here. And again, we have to run.
00:16:26.322 - 00:17:24.824, Speaker A: But Henri Rousseau is an interesting example. Of course, the guy who did the jungle scenes, who really got kind of adopted, so to speak, you know, and I think was a Henri Duane Rousseau, which I think he was a customs agent, which is what douanier, I think, means. So just worked a regular job and painted on the side and built these, you know, castles in the sky, so to speak, out of his mind. Never went to the real jungle. All those jungles are out of his mind that he did, as far as I understand. But they were so beautiful, and we see them in Moma canonical, that they became a part of the tradition. So, again, just to be clear, philosophically, I'm an all of the above type person here, and, you know, lest I should ever become the hyper traditionalists, but there is a conversation to be had about tradition is where I'm going.
00:17:24.824 - 00:17:44.656, Speaker A: Let's. Let's continue here. Thanks for sharing day two as well, having a lot of fun with object paint. Also, I've shown in day two how to get the dither palette in object paint. If you look at the attributes tab I left in the artwork, just switch from colors to black. Just switch from colors to black and white. So I got a couple of messages here.
00:17:44.656 - 00:18:01.322, Speaker A: So this is helpful because we're seeing some interesting stuff. I think I brought them up here in the tabs, too. Some of the results from object. It's actually pretty object paint or Microsoft paint 98. They're actually pretty cool, and I actually want to try them as well. Score. Psycho.
00:18:01.322 - 00:18:16.394, Speaker A: Thank you so much for reviewing spiritual glow. It became my favorite animation. I don't know if anyone mints this work, so I minted one for myself. Maybe I relist it later. Well, you might as well. Now it's a one of one for me. This drop was a hard one, but I tried.
00:18:16.394 - 00:18:49.750, Speaker A: At least keep creating anyway. And, you know, it's a tricky thing, I would say, you know, selling on ETH right now with ETH going through the roof, bitcoin's almost at 60,000, you know, the record being 69,000. I mean, so people are holding on to their ETH right now. They're trying to get out of their art right now so that they can sell at the top right. That's the goal. So it's tough to make to mint on ETH right now. I would argue there are still sales being made, but don't think it's necessarily the work.
00:18:49.750 - 00:19:13.414, Speaker A: And that was a beautiful work. John, accounts and reflections, because we are in a world of stories is so true. This points to the fact that multiple accounts will, and already do coexist already now, as are increasingly connected across nonlinear networks. So exactly. We're not doing math or physics here. There is, you know, as I like to say, with design, there are right answers and there are wrong answers. You can have a poorly designed website.
00:19:13.414 - 00:19:33.430, Speaker A: You could call that a wrong answer. But there is more than one right answer, right? You can have different beautiful outcomes for a website. To use that as a simple example. And that's the case in arts as well. Or in this world of qualitative assessment rather than quantitative. This is not the world of quantity. Again, math and science.
00:19:33.430 - 00:20:05.918, Speaker A: John Cates, incorporating influence and making it your own and doing it in style. Referring to our opening work, there is a great description and goal for folks. Thank you, John, and I appreciate the messages. And again, John Cates, a, as I say, John Cates, his name and I glitch over here. A, you know, old school glitch, I believe, from the nineties, if I'm not mistaken, glitch artist. So og, as they say, right click, dead heart. And I think that's brain dead there, I believe.
00:20:05.918 - 00:20:32.376, Speaker A: And this is what John was referring to. Santiago is a codal, I like the hyper postmodern term. I kind of did, too. And I thought of something quickly on that while we're here. So remember, we were talking about Jeff Koons, and we were discussing how Leonardo copying mimesis, Leonardo copies the Mona Lisa. Leonardo copies the person. The Mona Lisa makes a painting.
00:20:32.376 - 00:21:18.718, Speaker A: Jeff Koons copies the artwork of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo. And then that's an artwork. And so we could say that's a copy of a copy that almost becomes, you might say, a postmodern artwork, right? Because it's kind of, you know, there's something ironic about it. There's something all of a sudden. What do you mean? You're making a painting of an artwork. Like, there's something very postmodern about that. Interestingly, that is not exactly what's happening with strange thing, because in this kind of semiotic or postmodern discussion, as far as memory serves, and I'm going purely off of memory here, there's something called the referent, which is the reality that something is based on.
00:21:18.718 - 00:21:49.440, Speaker A: And then in hyper. In simulations and hyper reality, the idea is that the referent disappears. Okay? The. The reality that the copy is based on disappears. And so the difference between strange thing and Jeff Koons is strange thing is not copying directly from some source. Rather, it's more this AI dispersed algorithm taking all these things and creating something new. So, you know.
00:21:49.440 - 00:22:52.798, Speaker A: And you know, and so almost like what hyper postmodern could mean, it's kind of like another way of saying hyper real, but it's kind of a different spin on it because it's contextualizing it within the postmodern conversation. And we might say in a more direct way. And we could call it like a postmodern work without a referent, without a reality that is directly kind of related, that it is copying, so to speak. So another thing I want to do again is when we have more time, maybe on Friday or Monday, again, we refresh ourselves on our definitions using chat shippy of simulacra and simulation. So something to look forward to. I'm glad you like that term, because when I like how you put no hyphen there, that might be a better way of doing it. Of course, you know the Oxford English Dictionary, which is the dictionary of, you know, if you take english literature, one of the things they'll tell you in the masters classes, one of the most important things you can know is it's the OED.
00:22:52.798 - 00:23:15.740, Speaker A: The Oxford English Dictionary is the dictionary. And one of their recent style updates is to, if you can remove the hyphen, you remove the hyphen. If it's removable, sometimes you need to keep it. And so I was debating that here. Anyway, I like how Santiago Izachotl removes the hyphen. That might be the better way of doing it. Oops.
00:23:15.740 - 00:23:32.904, Speaker A: And here, let me just go back. It begins one more time. And let's see if we can get the rest of the comments here quickly. NFT. No, thank you. Okay, so we have a new comment there. And Rada.
00:23:32.904 - 00:23:51.742, Speaker A: Oh, man. Sorry for your ordinal feel related. Yeah. So it's kind of a rite of passage in crypto for bad things to happen. You know, that ordinal at a bitcoin puppet or whatever they're called, those are worth, like, eight or $9,000 now. But we shall not cry in our beer here tonight. Thanks for sharing and spreading awareness.
00:23:51.742 - 00:24:06.814, Speaker A: Much love. Yeah. Exverse wallet. Not a unisat wallet. It could have been my fault. So nothing against Unisat, but I would follow Leonidas advice. Use x verse for your ordinal wallet to make sure you don't spend your ordinals.
00:24:06.814 - 00:24:26.764, Speaker A: I don't know what happened, but it's a big hit only in potential because of course I didn't spend $9,000 on that ordinal. Okay, so just a few more. Thank you for the huge response here, by the way. 78 retweets, 18,000 views here. Huge. 25 bookmarks. Okay, let's look.
00:24:26.764 - 00:24:45.792, Speaker A: Elmira Muhel it looks so cool. Wish to be in the next journal. I gave you a follow. And again, if people want to be in the show, I get it a lot. I'll get emails and please don't email big images because that'll clog my email box. That is just contactabelly.net comma.
00:24:45.792 - 00:25:14.246, Speaker A: It will clog it. And so if you want to join the community, some people have a couple I've heard from a couple of people that their posts don't show up in the community. Send me a message if that's the case, if your posts aren't showing up. But otherwise, I'll show the community in a second here. If you want to be in, just post your work in the community and then I kind of quickly kind of go through that while I'm putting together the show. Thank you for the comment. Elmira dancefitar watching tonight.
00:25:14.246 - 00:25:29.822, Speaker A: Awesome and great to hear from you. HJ great as always. Thank you. Yuri J. I promise my comment had more sense a few days ago when I posted it. Here's Nicola Samori work demonstration, by the way. So here you can actually see Nicholas Samori.
00:25:29.822 - 00:26:07.646, Speaker A: And by the way, I screwed up. The person who wrote the futurist manifesto is not bocconi boccone, it is Marinetti, the poet. So, by the way, because I think I was saying it was Umberto Boccioni, the futurist manifestos. So just a quick little correction while I think of it. And so again, once again, thank you, Yuri, for stimulating an interesting discussion, which is just going to continue here again, maybe on Friday. We bring in some definitions courtesy of chat. GPT Skull takes great show and energy to start the week.
00:26:07.646 - 00:26:16.726, Speaker A: Thanks for your wonderful insights on space. My pleasure. And thank you for the support. Skull. Denise, thank you also for the ongoing support there. Appreciate it. Cool show.
00:26:16.726 - 00:26:32.094, Speaker A: Infinite, yay. Consistently wonderful curation and perspectives. Thank you. Infinite, yay. Great to hear from you. Ed Marolla loved the show. Had a good time watching while cooking for the week here, and I thought to myself, what a great idea to cook for the week while watching YouTube.
00:26:32.094 - 00:26:45.186, Speaker A: I should do something like that. Retro Manny, great to hear from you. Demon ego. Eli low. Thanks for the mention, Adrian, as always, great episode. Inspiring and refreshing. Maybe we're too meticulous in an attempt to define everything.
00:26:45.186 - 00:28:02.514, Speaker A: And after a thousand years, art critics will just say the renaissance was great, but by the web3 time, it became highly weird, you know, and there is something to be said for that. And again, even in terms of just perspectives here, like, I'm sympathetic to that. I'm sympathetic to the futurists, I'm sympathetic to Yuri J. This idea of, like, why are we keep going back to the past? Do we need some ultra conservative, at the end of the day approach here? And so part of the reason I do what I'm doing is I am like, part of what I'm doing here is outside of our bubble. There is a sense that the art on the blockchain is not that great. And so part of what I'm doing here by contextualizing it and having this conversation about the tradition and trying to bring it in where we can and even comparing it and is to kind of help bring what I would argue is a kind of credibility. It doesn't need that from me, but I think it can be helpful, okay, for people who are outside of it, who don't understand, but if all of a sudden you give them something they can latch onto, like Leonardo, and then, or, you know, Jeff Koons, then they go, oh, okay, strange thing.
00:28:02.514 - 00:28:34.764, Speaker A: This is like a kind of a postmodern thing. It gives them a way in. And that is part of what I'm trying to do here. So that is part of why it's so historical. It's also interesting and I think educational for me as well, because I do a lot of, you know, thinking about this stuff as a result of our conversation that we have together here about copyright issues. Of course, I'm using my own music, as always. And that was brilliant music in this episode, the digital VST, sometimes an analog sense, an instrument.
00:28:34.764 - 00:29:03.144, Speaker A: The tape is just a recording. So that was beautiful music, by the way. And John Cates, first, it's okay to copy. Believe in the process of copying as much as you can with all your heart, is a good place to start. Get into it as straight and honestly as possible. Copying is as good, I think, better from this vector view as any other way of getting there. Phil Morton from the distribution religion, I think, or Relgen notes on the aesthetics of copying an image processor, 1973.
00:29:03.144 - 00:29:22.436, Speaker A: Wow. First, it's okay to copy, believe in the process of copying as much as you can. So. And this is what John Cates quoted here. So if you want to read this, it's pretty interesting. I'd never heard of Phil Morton, but super interesting take here. Thank you, John Cates again.
00:29:22.436 - 00:29:54.642, Speaker A: And 303. I actually have sketches I want to release here I've been working on. Maybe I'll do it in the lead up to March 3, which is 03:03 day here as we had the 303rd episode. Thanks, Pixel Lord. We're going to see a couple of things from Pixel Lord if I I'm going to have to speed up here, but Pixel Lord is killing it on ordinals, so something to check out in a few tabs here. KF, love your choice for the COVID today. I'm fascinated by right click dead, also known as Braindead, by their work as well.
00:29:54.642 - 00:30:16.602, Speaker A: Gozo, thanks for the feature. The piece is part of Midnight Arboretum exhibition created by Dina Chang. We're going to see that in a second, actually. And Braindead, we heard from Braindead. First of all, I'm beyond honored that you chose my work for the COVID of this episode. Adrian didn't expect that. To be honest, while working on this piece, the general layout of the pieces was the thing I spent the most time on.
00:30:16.602 - 00:30:55.398, Speaker A: And just as you mentioned, I used bold spaces on edges to get the whole composition in balanced, and it gives a more stable angle for viewers to inspect all those little details and side elements in general. I also ordered a 70 cm wide print of the work for myself to hang it on my wall. I think I wrote please send a picture when you get that. It excites me thinking to be able to touch it with my hands and see those little details with a naked eye. Now I'm planning to turn these hardware systems into a series. This lovely color palette is enough to get the result I want for now, but I might try different things in the near future. Cream and Gogo are definitely two of my favorite artists on space.
00:30:55.398 - 00:31:07.346, Speaker A: Like many others that I have observed closely and inspired and studied by. I really like their craftsmanship. Thank you again for highlighting the piece. You made my day. My absolute pleasure there. Brain dead. Just a beautiful, beautiful work.
00:31:07.346 - 00:31:26.772, Speaker A: And it's great to see, you know, it's just great to see beautiful work kind of coming out of nowhere. Their epic piece. Vinnie Hager, thank you so much. Another great episode, Vinny. Yeah, and that beautiful vase that Vinny had done. Luciana Guerra, looking forward to chatting shortly here. And yoa o Salazar, awesome to hear from you.
00:31:26.772 - 00:31:45.260, Speaker A: We have another piece here. And this was an interesting comment from this account here. Stop pumping rafiq. I don't think I was pumping it. I thought I was actually quite skeptical, to be perfectly frank on, on that one. I was mentioning it, but I think it was worth mentioning until he admits where he got his ideas and inspiration. And we have gotten another.
00:31:45.260 - 00:32:13.764, Speaker A: I don't know who it was vaguely remember, but I don't want to get it wrong. Someone else is pointing out the software that Rafiq uses and it's nothing too revolutionary according to one AI artist who we heard from here, you know, 60 episodes ago or whatever the. We'll see if then we'll see if the truth or covers himself with perpetuating the myth. He thought of it all on his own. Loving. So I think an interesting. But I'm not pumping rafique.
00:32:13.764 - 00:32:30.440, Speaker A: I'm just kind of noting, you know, it's entering. It's in the conversation here. Flint Pope, loving the detail and your very positive criticism on the brain dead piece. Thank you. So here is the community artist journal. Community. We're at 128 members growing fast.
00:32:30.440 - 00:32:48.888, Speaker A: As well as the Twitter. My actual account here seems to be. I don't know what's going on, but things seem to be growing pretty fast the last few days. And here's Rosaceo. Like, how great is this? So this was just posted. So this didn't make it in the show because I never saw it yet. But isn't this awesome? So there's.
00:32:48.888 - 00:33:14.968, Speaker A: And I have too much work to show here. But this is so Kurt Hussle collective. And yeah, this is about when I last checked in with the community here. So I'm thrilled. So this is, again, if you're looking to post your work and to basically be in a feed that I check out here and. Or just to share it with other super cool people here. Like August ground and this actually.
00:33:14.968 - 00:33:35.680, Speaker A: Yeah. Like it influences the show as you'll see if you're in the community. So I'm loving this. And I feel like I'm just getting, we're just getting started on what I feel like this thing can do. But just like this show, it's gonna be a slow burn here. We're just gonna slowly maybe add. If there's news links, we start putting in the news links, maybe a tune here and there and all that sort of thing.
00:33:35.680 - 00:33:59.824, Speaker A: Make it a fun, true community. August ground. Thanks, Bokebelli, for pointing this gem out. Remember the Renki work? That was just a strobe. It was just this super minimal thing. And August ground interestingly, and I was super wowed by it, August ground got a similar feeling. Maybe I'll try and open it here.
00:33:59.824 - 00:34:20.144, Speaker A: Thanks for pointing this out. Renky accepted my offer for this understated and sublime strike of genius. It kind of had that feeling. No bells and whistles, just brilliant conceptual moves and an expanding and consistent oeuvre. So August ground. I haven't asked August, but that's another person. I want to bring on the spaces.
00:34:20.144 - 00:34:35.724, Speaker A: A great speaker there as well. And give me some made a curation of ratta Yankees works. Feel free to post the link so we can see it. And so on and on. Be and again. So I'm going to keep going back to these. This is great.
00:34:35.724 - 00:34:50.334, Speaker A: This actually could have been in the show. So I'll just say. And Martin Joe, we're going to look at this work as well as this one. So I'll just say the community is fun. Come join. And again, great place to see your. To share your work.
00:34:50.334 - 00:35:19.972, Speaker A: So taking a bit of a risk here. So this is the work that August ground was talking about. Just this hyper minimal strobe within the context of Renky's work. There is something just very, very powerful about this. So all very cool and congratulations. I should have looked at what August paid for it. Ilay, so, referring to the debate on simulation, really, of oil painting with AI, my initial thoughts on oil painting or any painting referenced in AI works.
00:35:19.972 - 00:35:51.940, Speaker A: Painting is referenced by artists, one, for technical reasons, for texture, or against slickness, depending on model tendencies. Two, on a conceptual basis as a commentary. And this is, I agree. And you know, I have, I think, unreleased, but I've actually released some works, I think from Secret History of World War three that use these screenshots of the news and in the background, I have AI painted works. And to me it kind of captures the zeitgeist. It's kind of like. So I think that's what Ilay is saying here.
00:35:51.940 - 00:36:39.560, Speaker A: There's something to be said for AI generated paint strokes, especially where you start to see, you know, it starts looking as good as the physical strokes and like how, you know, that's kind of wild, right? And aesthetics, as we've been discussing has there is merit in the aesthetics alone to a certain degree. And three, because painting, whether from the Renaissance or lascaux or basquia, reflects a genuine influence of the individual artists. Some artists are more influenced by sims or cinema or memes or think of waffles here, or various combinations. And four, because it's pleasing to the art, to the artistic or aesthetic sensibility. Thank you for the very well thought out comment there. I lay in contributing to the conversation, and I'm in total agreement. Lonely boy I was a little concerned.
00:36:39.560 - 00:36:58.690, Speaker A: I hope this isn't directed at the show. It could be, maybe the tashin book, I'm not sure. Lonely boy. Lately I've been seeing that there seemingly has to be a requirement of sorts, a requirement of sorts to be an art person. But to me, an art person is simply someone who loves art and is passionate about it. And indeed. Indeed.
00:36:58.690 - 00:38:04.446, Speaker A: I mean, so I'm not sure, and maybe I'm just projecting, but it's an interesting. Yeah. Like, one of the things I want to add to this idea of the big game, so to speak, is just a couple of very quick comments here, because we're already at 37 minutes here. We have about 40 minutes to go and quite a bit to go through here. And the interestingly, like I was talking about Dante loading up the divine comedy the commedia. I've only read the inferno, starting the purgatorio here, but loading it with historical references. And, you know, one wonders, is that the first really kind of attempt at kind of doing this kind of artwork that is incorporating everything and then saying everything? It's kind of like the most ambitious artwork when we're thinking of Dante that you could ever do.
00:38:04.446 - 00:39:00.424, Speaker A: It's dealing with the spiritual state of the human and then incorporating all of history into it, a ton of classicism, and then going and then writing genius poetry to accompany that. So pretty epic, right? Ambition of a ridiculous kind, one could argue. But that is necessary, audacious ambition. Necessary is necessary in order to make a work like that. And you see it. There is a canto in the inferno where Dante is walking along in conversation and says, you know, doesn't share what is being said hilariously with the reader in conversation with Homer, I think with Ovid, maybe with Lucian, who I've never read, but apparently maybe that was a bigger deal in the Renaissance and Virgil. So Dante includes himself in this conversation.
00:39:00.424 - 00:40:37.112, Speaker A: And so I thought a lot of what's being discussed here, however, when I talk about the big game, we're talking about Alan Moore working with a humble medium, but it's still able to somewhat, because it's so historical, able to play the big game, so to speak. It's kind of a bit of a literary thing to a certain degree. And so when we're talking about the big game in terms of painters, I was like, well, who's doing that in painting generally? We'll see an a mane that say quotes in the Dejeuner Solebe, the river God from ancient Rome, right? Which we've looked at Tiberius, I think it was, or something along that name, something similar to that. And we'll see quoting in the arts, we'll see Picasso use the bull, right? Which is kind of a, you know, you could argue a spanish thing, the toreador, but also goes back to the very foundations of art. Lascaux, as Aile was mentioning there, you know, the bull goes, you know, this. And this kind of very virile kind of iconography means a million things. So art, you know, so do we have, like an encyclopedic, my question to myself this morning, thinking about lonely boys comment here, do we have an encyclopedic, like, kind of a Dante esque approach in the visual arts? And you know who I thought of, the only two artists I could really think of who were trying to do this totally encompassing thing is actually Raphael in the school of Athens.
00:40:37.112 - 00:41:05.734, Speaker A: And that whole room with, you know, and then the poets are there. Who actually puts Dante in there and actually puts himself similar to Dante in the canto with the. Putting himself with the epic poets. There's Raphael, who paints himself in the school of Athens. If we had more time, I'd bring it up and we should, in a future episode, right. Paints himself in there again, a similar move. And one could even argue a kind of loose quoting of what Dante did.
00:41:05.734 - 00:41:25.454, Speaker A: But we don't see. My point is, though, we don't see a ton of it. And Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel. Right. You have kind of all the sealing and the last judgment there, but. So there's a ton going on and a ton of stories. It's kind of incorporating a lot.
00:41:25.454 - 00:42:01.592, Speaker A: Is it as encyclopedic? I'd argue Raphael is actually being slightly more encyclopedic. But all to say, when I am discussing this big game, first of all, there's many games that can be played in art, and maybe that's more of a literary thing to a certain degree than a visual arts. It's more quoting. It's more kind of, you know, just quoting. I like to say, you know, they were pastiche. I keep getting these notifications of bitcoin going through the roof. I never get crypto notifications.
00:42:01.592 - 00:42:20.946, Speaker A: Now my phone's going crazy. So all to say, I'm an all of the above type person, and good art can come from anywhere. Depends what game you want to play. If you want to play the game of. Okay, let's all encompassing culture and deal with all of history. Well, you're going to have to know history. You're going to have to study it.
00:42:20.946 - 00:42:43.994, Speaker A: And Dante didn't have Homer, okay? That was in Greek. They didn't have a translation, so he only had Virgil. So you don't need to know everything either. But he did have an encyclopedic knowledge. So all to say, yeah, I wouldn't listen to those people, was what I would say. And I hope you don't think that I'm saying that. Sobato, this is really interesting.
00:42:43.994 - 00:43:18.878, Speaker A: So botto is the community make the crypto experiment where people basically vote with AI in order to make an image. And so Sabato, commenting on the latest work by botto, waters on lone territory. Funny, because if a human photographer showed me this work, I'd be like, it's fine, but nothing special. But because a collaborative AI bot made this, we can be like, ah, yes, this is the median photograph of all fine art photography. The perfect image, sausage. Beautifully put. So, yeah, I find these interesting.
00:43:18.878 - 00:43:36.990, Speaker A: Do I think they're overpriced? Probably? Right. And again, I'm very wary of sort of, you know, I think I called it art by committee. Right. You know, but whatever, it's. Again, I'm kind of an all of the above. Like, I have nothing, no problem. People should, people make art for different reasons.
00:43:36.990 - 00:43:56.904, Speaker A: Right. And that's kind of important to remember. So. But, you know, so I think that's maybe where a lot of confusion lies, actually. So, Dina Chang, let's continue here. This is Dina Chang's show. Midnight arboretum is featured on object homepage.
00:43:56.904 - 00:44:26.944, Speaker A: Editions are still available, but selling out fast. So here's just a quick and big shout out to object for putting those curations on the homepage there. We'll put that in the next show. I hope I screenshot that. So here is Dina Chang. A few highlights here from the Dina Chang show. So I think we saw that.
00:44:26.944 - 00:44:40.706, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So just cool. And shout out to Dina Chang. Thanks for hosting, co hosting that those few times and looks like a great show. Sabato's in there with many others. Pixel lord, GM. This is what we have now on the third day.
00:44:40.706 - 00:45:13.752, Speaker A: So Pixel Lord put out the spectrum heroes and shout out to Pixel Lord, who helped, who has been nice, big supporter of this show, has put out work on ordinals, and it's sold out in a minute. So big congrats to Pixel Lord. And I'm not sure, I think we put in the tweet the other day. I spent $5,000 of minting a collection on ordinals. I think that was in last show. So pretty cool. It's getting hot on bitcoin.
00:45:13.752 - 00:45:29.944, Speaker A: It's getting very hot. Leonidas all time high ordinal sale ever. Inscryption two just sold for $1.4 million. 24 bitcoin ordinals are dead. So pretty intense. What's going on there? Bullish on Rodar Moores.
00:45:29.944 - 00:45:53.052, Speaker A: So this is a big kind of bitcoin developer. Ordinal developer, I believe, maybe created ordinals, the protocol on bitcoin, if I'm not mistaken. Vision for web3 on bitcoin. Bitcoin is the base currency. Runes are the fungible tokens, interestingly rare. Sats, semi fungible tokens. Inscryptions are the nfts, the non fungible tokens.
00:45:53.052 - 00:46:28.738, Speaker A: Very interesting. And Santiago is a cottle pointing out that neurocolor has just put a 120 kb gif on ordinals, so. And of course, so it's getting hot out there. If you're not feeling the fomo yet, you may soon. I need to get my stuff out there before bitcoin gets too expensive to mint on there. Get it on while you can is what I say. If bitcoin goes to a million dollars, then what? Then how are you going to mint your, you know, so get it on while you can, if you're thinking about it.
00:46:28.738 - 00:46:42.454, Speaker A: And I say to myself just as much as anybody here, let's continue here. Super rare. This was shocking. I'm not often shocked. This shocked me. Gone are the days of ETH killers. We live in a multi chain world.
00:46:42.454 - 00:47:41.906, Speaker A: To celebrate, here's a thread featuring super rare artists that meant across several platforms and chains, the true pioneers of on chain art. So kind of a shocking message, I would say, from super rare because, you know, they are such an ETH platform. So isn't that interesting? And what does that mean? You know, you wonder, like, is there a cons? Like, how cool would it be if super rare somehow did something with ordinals? You know, and maybe that's what they're thinking. Of course, they're referencing artists who are going on Solana base avalanche. And the reason I'm so shocked by this is because I'd say the most pushback I've ever had on this show is saying, you know what? What's the big deal with artists minting on Solana? I've gotten a few people that were kind of not happy with me saying that. So it's shocking to me that super rare which is such an ETH kind of maxi platform, so to speak, seemingly. And I'm grateful to super rare.
00:47:41.906 - 00:48:19.160, Speaker A: I'm happy to be on super rare, and I hope they go multi chain. I think that would be awesome. But I'm shocked to see them do this. So maybe, you know, the market is, you know, ethereum, tezo, Solana, maybe they're being forced to, like, maybe they're not making enough sales. Like, I haven't looked at the super rare bot, but, you know, artists, we're not putting a ton of super rare works on in the tabs because we're not seeing a ton, interestingly, and a lot of people have super rare accounts, a lot of the artists here, but they're not putting it on super rare. So interesting. Unknown collector, if you feel down right now, I get it.
00:48:19.160 - 00:48:50.562, Speaker A: Crypto prices are rising. Art nfts unchanged. They talk about a bull market, but you feel left out. Yeah. And so I would say be patient also, because once, you know, when people buy art is when the crypto stops going up or even goes down a bit, then they get bored, and then they start looking around and trying to find things to do with their crypto. Okay, we're already at 50 minutes here, so I want, uh, yeah, so I wouldn't even just. I would actually say it doesn't mean it's not going to come.
00:48:50.562 - 00:49:19.124, Speaker A: I would just be patient, because if bitcoin goes to art, like, you know, your art on Tazos is probably your little collection there is probably going to be worth a little bit more. Even if it's just three x or four x, it could be worth way more, you know, in the next five years. So isn't that interesting? Who knows? Not financial advice. There's nothing you can change about financial markets and where the money flows. Just keep being you and give it your all. That's all you can do. Exactly.
00:49:19.124 - 00:49:46.990, Speaker A: Passion and talent, more often than not, will arrive where it should be at some point. Let's keep grinding. Give it our best to make art shine. In the end, art is what prevails. And you know what's so interesting? I am. There's a lesson here, because you can spend all your time, and I've done stuff like this in the past, chasing after kind of the next crypto thing to try and speculate and get rich. But sometimes the best thing you can do is make your art, because the two airdrops I got were from making art.
00:49:46.990 - 00:50:13.232, Speaker A: I got it from the Zora. You got the optimism, Airdrop. And if I hadn't been posting my videos or whatever, working with Sora, posting my art and people doing things. I wouldn't have got that airdrop. And then this rune airdrop is going to come out from Leonidas and company. You had to have three ordinal nfts in your bitcoin wallet and I had like five because I had been minting my own work and it wasn't selling. I'd sold one.
00:50:13.232 - 00:50:43.182, Speaker A: Thank you Luke 500. But thankfully those didn't sell. And so, you know, it's so the lesson here is sometimes working on art in this space can actually pay you more than chasing after the next big kind of crypto thing. So I totally agree with UC. Based on experience, that is where the payoff is. Blue retina I found some copy mentors of my art on Zora and Opensea. Unfortunately two different places sharing the links with you guys.
00:50:43.182 - 00:51:08.084, Speaker A: Please report them. And I saw there were some fake axcenes there too. So yeah, mint fakes. So I guess mint fun, which is on Zora. So let's keep running here. This was very interesting. Julie Rose this is something I've been thinking about for near a decade and I actually tried for a couple of months starting my own digital art subscription.
00:51:08.084 - 00:51:33.944, Speaker A: Pretty cool. Join the Crystal Spaceship Club monthly edition airdrops easy access to select early access to select drops quarterly raffles for one of ones 0.01 ETH per month. So I guess that would be maybe $34 a month. But you're getting art. So interesting. I think this, I think this could happen.
00:51:33.944 - 00:52:02.714, Speaker A: And this is the page, actually where you would connect your wallet and 64 x early subscriber bonus. So just pretty cool. I could see that really catching on at some point. Adam Fuhrer Kube pull plotter Twitter so another beautiful pen plotter work here which continued to dazzle and fascinate me. It lives. Here's somfei in the studio, I think. Posted by kiro in the community look how rich that is.
00:52:02.714 - 00:52:39.064, Speaker A: So very cool there. And you see those analog video glitch artists at work. Neutro. So another update here from 3d scanning to VR sculpting. Julian Suleiko is teaching some of his techniques at the two command residence at Lazaro Tez. I assume this is the same resonance we were seeing with bosque grazias, the crew paying attention. So again, when you start seeing several minds together, this is when things really start to happen here.
00:52:39.064 - 00:53:03.966, Speaker A: Like you start collaborating. Like, I mean, what is a corporation? It's a bunch of people collaborating. So if you start having a bunch of digital artists that start to kind of get together, share ideas, share techniques, start again. As I mentioned in an earlier episode, that starts to get dangerous. Neutro. We're doing onboarding of patagonian artists. Gabriella has been making woodcuts and prints for many years.
00:53:03.966 - 00:53:27.244, Speaker A: Today, we're experimenting with different ways to digitize her works. Posque grazias arzora. So look at this. This looks like a scanner, right? Like, think again. That's why I'm just thrilled by, look at how cool this is. Like, in me just watching this video goes, oh, you can get scanners like that I had seen. Here's another one.
00:53:27.244 - 00:53:55.042, Speaker A: Let me just make sure. Sometimes the audio will continue there. And this is in Spanish, but again. And is that Santiago ruao? So you gotta love what's going on. So it looks like a video of this painting. This is pretty rad, to quote waffles there. And here is Ed Marolla rocking a jam for a collab with Kennex Zapata.
00:53:55.042 - 00:54:11.112, Speaker A: So looks like Ed Marolla in the heat of summer there. Those beautiful green leaves there. Ed, that looks like heaven. This looks like heaven. And there's a korg. And what is this? Matriarch? Okay, we don't. That's a moog.
00:54:11.112 - 00:54:27.056, Speaker A: Wow. Very, very, very cool. And here, my painting and my daughters. I thought this was a hilarious image here from Santiago. So hilarious. Kind of a, you know, heartwarming image there. This is also Santiago on paint 98.
00:54:27.056 - 00:54:42.428, Speaker A: We have a few artists. So this is, of course, the Windows 98 paint program. That object is put on their platform where people can make work. Like, look at how cool this is. So. And it looks like a Santiago work. Again, look at how beautiful this is.
00:54:42.428 - 00:55:02.532, Speaker A: Amelia Versace party. Like, it's 1999. Gorgeous. Here is Katarina create. This is also paint 98. So you see, Katarina creates style, but with this beautiful, you know, kind of pixelated Windows paint program. Very cool there.
00:55:02.532 - 00:55:19.672, Speaker A: Here is braindead putting a broken jaw. And we actually have a story on that coming up in a tweet. How are we doing for time here? Okay, we're going to really have to speed up here. We'll get to the broken jaw in a second. We also have macro g matry. Give macro g matry a. Follow a very small account.
00:55:19.672 - 00:55:33.904, Speaker A: And I follow macrog matry. That is a x glitch. Only 17 followers here and needs 100, I think, to start showing up. So cool artist working on also on Microsoft paint. There's. Here's. Oh, my God, I draw it.
00:55:33.904 - 00:55:58.596, Speaker A: OMG, I draw it. Whatifobject.com people are loving it. I can't wait to use it. Braindead so as I was just so the person we started last episode with, I collected this piece, which we're gonna look at two days ago because. No, I collected this piece because it's so relatable. Two days ago, while walking on the street on my way home, I tried to separate two young men fighting, but turns out we're friends and suddenly I got attacked by them.
00:55:58.596 - 00:56:21.636, Speaker A: I survived this incident with a broken jaw and a few skin muscle injuries. So I collected this piece as a souvenir. I guess I have to eat my food through a straw for a couple of weeks more, waiting to heal and thinking what kind of world we live in nowadays. So sorry to hear that. Brain dead and get well soon. And what a horrible story. And so beautiful work there by Muji.
00:56:21.636 - 00:56:48.294, Speaker A: We're gonna look closer and starting again. Also give Shili Preston has an open edition here, if you have an extra five. Tez, go help shilly out who is on hard times right now and again has this open edition mid journey and photopea. Maybe a self portrait of sorts. Don't jump. I shouldn't give. I'll buy an edition by, you know, go support Chilli Preston is the actually what I'm trying to say there.
00:56:48.294 - 00:57:13.356, Speaker A: And big shout out. And yeah, heart goes out to you, Shilly. Marcelo Pinel as we begin the works here. Another hour in here and we're gonna have to really zoom here. Look at this Pisces. Marcelo Pinel. So look at the Pisces sign too, in this very cool crystal of sorts here.
00:57:13.356 - 00:57:32.574, Speaker A: Just another beautiful, beautiful work here. Trying new techniques here in the fish scales too. And we see the constellation in the background. There's. This is an edition of 25 for 42 tezos each. And that is on object. Here's a beautiful work by Ed Marolla on Solana, going multi chain.
00:57:32.574 - 00:57:54.188, Speaker A: I wonder if we can bring this up bigger. We don't really have time, but just a really cool landscape here from Edmar Ola. This is only half salt reserve, dollar, 56 reserve. And this is on exchange art. So very cool piece here. And here it is, actually. So you see.
00:57:54.188 - 00:58:05.484, Speaker A: Yes, there's the dithering. Sometimes the dithering when it gets compressed, you can't see it properly. And so you got to zoom in. Looking great. And look at these great plants here. Beautiful work. Beautiful digital art.
00:58:05.484 - 00:58:24.082, Speaker A: Here's another one. Could hang in the same room by cider. Nightmare. Another big sale here from cider 0.6 ETH. So $1,900 for cider here in this very cool work, which also looks like a little bit of a landscape here. Some water, a play of distortion with digital illustration and collage.
00:58:24.082 - 00:58:41.294, Speaker A: Nightmare. Cool title. This is beautiful here, too. This is Reykjay's blossom drop soon. So we saw some flowers earlier, some pixelated flowers. Really digging the weird painterliness of this pixel art here. Ray case.
00:58:41.294 - 00:59:04.454, Speaker A: Very beautiful work here. I love where that's going. Kind of brand new artist. We'll see if I come back here. All right, let's go. And Zozo. So a bit of a nature theme to get us started here.
00:59:04.454 - 00:59:19.748, Speaker A: Cool water, connected kind of some waterfalls here. Taking offers at three tazos here. Edition of 20. That's on object. And here, just a cool abstract by Yuri J. Ever experimenting here. So cool distortions, cool.
00:59:19.748 - 00:59:49.912, Speaker A: Different kind of patterning here in a cool abstraction. And an edgy work from NUV 1914. Again, these could hang side by side in this little gallery in my mind. Arbolito. This is five tezos edition of five. You know, I picked up a one of one of NUV 1914 because we're not seeing as many and a lot were released. And now, you know, I hesitate to say it, but get the one of one NUV 1914s while you can, because we're not seeing as many, we're seeing more additions now.
00:59:49.912 - 01:00:05.764, Speaker A: Interesting experimentation here. Beautiful textures, as usual. Five Tezos edition of five here is Santiago State of mind, 2066. Cool title. Interesting move by not centering this composition. Kind of adds a cool. And gotta love that.
01:00:05.764 - 01:00:22.948, Speaker A: Big pixels in the background. Very interesting. Abstract here from Santiago. And kind of fuzzy and pixelated in areas. Super interesting work here. Five tezos edition of 20. This is mumble boy Pajamarama.
01:00:22.948 - 01:00:47.724, Speaker A: So another digital collage here, using seemingly some physical, using scissors, perhaps, as well as digital cuts. This is an edition of two for eight tazos. And let's continue here. Kind of an eighties vibe there. And here's axin. And I think this is part of some sort of hype drop, because we see almost like the Campbell soup with hype there. Beautifully kind of done there.
01:00:47.724 - 01:01:06.684, Speaker A: And then chasing after this. 13 the monk. Just very cool. And here's a new one by sum, these beautifully painted series here. Faraway look, another horse rider. I don't know how soon is doing it, but this is some pretty gorgeous work here. And I think it's digital art.
01:01:06.684 - 01:01:47.050, Speaker A: Pretty astonishing. And so, again, it brings up this idea. If this is a digital work, which I think it is. It seems worthwhile to me. Again, the paint strokes for me are starting to compete with it. Kind of almost looks like AI, doesn't it? It's starting to compete with the real brushstrokes, which kind of is a bit of a conundrum, isn't it? So, because why make real brush strokes if you can make AI brushstrokes better? You know, quote unquote trippy collector sharing some works by pale Kurill. Just wanted to share these because it is truly mind blowing stuff.
01:01:47.050 - 01:02:11.922, Speaker A: The colors, the composition, the subject matter, all so perfect. Indeed. Nice share. Pale Kuril somehow escapes my vision oftentimes. So really, thanks for bringing that to. I think it was posted in the community here, the artist journal community, and just saw it online. Just really nice paintings here, aren't they? I believe digital paintings and using basketball as a subject matter.
01:02:11.922 - 01:02:29.494, Speaker A: This is Besu Divineos 2024. Interesting painting here. I believe digital. What does it say on Besu's new collection? Available at exchange art. So maybe a Solana based artist. Nice work. Very nice piece.
01:02:29.494 - 01:02:51.314, Speaker A: Here's the fail artist number 73. And this is wasteman gold Minevich depicting a security guard for McDonald's. On this occasion, my hot dog was trampled on and since I had no other food, I got somewhat annoyed. Unfortunately, the situation escalated. So I thought this was hilarious, actually. The little McDonald's bumper car. And here Mcsecurity.
01:02:51.314 - 01:03:10.094, Speaker A: And kind of getting a rough treatment here from McDonald's security smoking the McDonald's cigarette. The failed artists there and the boss coming up with. Coming out with some fries or maybe another. So just another brilliant work. Did I pick. I might have picked this up. Not yet.
01:03:10.094 - 01:03:17.134, Speaker A: August Crown. Few people picking it up. Still some available. We can do it. Featuring cool Keith. So this is junk. A delicate and working class.
01:03:17.134 - 01:03:42.928, Speaker A: Just give you a quick snippet here. Junkodelics again, a pretty cool musician. We can do a little shopping. So kind of perfect. We can do a little shopping here outside of Walmart. Very cool. Very cool.
01:03:42.928 - 01:04:09.304, Speaker A: What's going on there? That's on object and continuing on. Kappa Sage. Help me imagine contempt condemned to remember you. A poetic description there. And you gotta love these kind of weird paint drips upside down, you know, an interesting contrast here between kind of the fuzzy lines in the water and kind of the hard edged, almost Microsoft paint type lines here. Wild work. Kind of surreal.
01:04:09.304 - 01:04:36.780, Speaker A: And this is a one of one going for only 15 tezos to district 468. So nice work there for district 468. I thought this was pretty cool too. Just an interesting modern digital painting here. Contemporary digital art. Painting in a golf cart with. I don't know if those are McDonald's or what that is in that guy's hand with a beer maybe, or a drink and a cow, kind of.
01:04:36.780 - 01:04:49.864, Speaker A: Again, a surreal scene, like a surreal painting here. Interesting composition. I think that's Greg. Is it VAR krem? Varg krem. So I think we've seen a couple of works by VAR krem. Interesting piece. Here's rustic digital art.
01:04:49.864 - 01:05:08.972, Speaker A: Ford Vulcan. You kind of gotta love this. So almost doing an ad here with pikachu. I think that's pikachu. Different Ford logos broken up here and kind of a 1960s feeling to it. And then Escalona 2024. And then kind of a rustic digital art background landscape there.
01:05:08.972 - 01:05:26.644, Speaker A: That is 55 tezos. That is on object and just minted there. And here is Pomelo. And I think there's some music here as well. Let's see. Or just a visual, just animation. I thought it was interesting how tezos was mentioned here, 0.6
01:05:26.644 - 01:05:41.824, Speaker A: tezos, but it's on Zora, which I thought was kind of an interesting move here. So none minted so far. Just minted. Here is John. Another still life. Really digging the series here. Interesting painting.
01:05:41.824 - 01:05:55.992, Speaker A: Kind of an airbrush style in here. And we got a plant, a water bottle and an extension cord. Very interesting. The window almost turns into a picture. Interestingly. And here's Pipi universal. We won't.
01:05:55.992 - 01:06:14.684, Speaker A: And this is pretty cool work here. And we see the kind of patterny style of pipi universal here. Really cool with this coiled spring. And we will never know in the book. So you can read all you want, but we will never know. We won't. As PP says, that went for six tazos edition of five.
01:06:14.684 - 01:06:34.754, Speaker A: Here is Flora Marquez. Bertha Lupe Montguillo. Again, kind of has a bit of a fashion designer type vibe to it. Beautiful painting, beautiful dress. Look at this work. And kind of almost an alice in wonderland type vibe with the moon there and the dog head 102, minted on Zora. Nice move.
01:06:34.754 - 01:06:58.922, Speaker A: Here is Jake Studios. If God is an aries, how are we doing for time here? We have to speed up. Another cool work by Jake Studios. Digital revolution here speaks for itself. Another surreal illustration. What was interesting about this, there's God taking out the earth, another crucifixion and some money underneath. So this is twelve tazos at auction.
01:06:58.922 - 01:07:14.178, Speaker A: You might be able. There's District 468 picking up another stunner for cheap here. This one was burned, interestingly. So there was a darker sky before. So I thought that was interesting. It's interesting. You know, sometimes minting something, put it on the website, you see it and you go, meh.
01:07:14.178 - 01:07:32.024, Speaker A: Then you're like, I think this needs an edit. So interesting. I think they both look good, but I think I do like the beige better too. Interestingly. And some process for if God is an aries here. So here you see some of the. And you see the sky changing there.
01:07:32.024 - 01:07:50.028, Speaker A: So pretty cool to see that. I mean, really built from nothing there. Great illustrator Jake Studios, isn't he? Very impressive. So let's continue here. If the computer cooperates. Here's rata. Prepare for plunder.
01:07:50.028 - 01:08:11.414, Speaker A: So of course, these pirate ones speak directly to me. This is us. And there maybe is a little rat. And we continue to sail forward here. Just an interesting work here by ratta. Kind of nice, kind of jagged pixelation here, a nice square brush. That's 660 edition of 45.
01:08:11.414 - 01:08:31.778, Speaker A: And there, this beautiful work of the rat on the pirate ship. I've asked ye bilge bilge rats. Side quests of Captain Dead rat pirate edition of 27. Now, twelve tezos just minted. So cool work here. Beautiful drawings from Rada, the super talented, great pixel artist. I got to clean up another paint 98 work.
01:08:31.778 - 01:08:58.064, Speaker A: Actually. This could have been put at the front here by tornado Rodriguez. So I'm pretty amazed at how well people can basically emulate their own style using Microsoft paint. Super interesting. Original sin after hendrik gold, the fall of man. So this is 1616. So this is another pastiche by RJ, seemingly incorporating x copy colors into the pastiche.
01:08:58.064 - 01:09:26.634, Speaker A: I think this is quite interesting. And even, like, the kind of the noise here feels a little bit x copy ish. So almost pastiching both this older painting and the crypto painting and starting to just go boom. What happens when we start pastichian two kind of works, or at least taking, quoting the colors from one and the composition from another. Original sin. Here's another one. Agnes machine.
01:09:26.634 - 01:09:48.668, Speaker A: This is on Zora with this huge font here. Hilariously, six minted so far. And of course, we saw rare also play with this, but doing the Boston dynamics dog. So interesting work from RJ. Here's actually a few more from RJ. Beautiful, kind of hockney esque portraits here. And this is just posted.
01:09:48.668 - 01:10:00.764, Speaker A: I don't think we've seen these before. They may not be new, but I thought chat rooms. Interesting title. And we have another one there. What is this object paint 98. The Internet. So everybody's loving it.
01:10:00.764 - 01:10:26.564, Speaker A: I can't wait to give a shot here. And here's limbo with a beautifully dithered work here. Edition of 27. Big limbo fan here. Just cool. Kind of Sci-Fi pixel art, edgy, dark death is lurking. I'm pretty sure.
01:10:26.564 - 01:10:47.100, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure limbo makes the music, because I remember seeing shot at the studio and I'm pretty sure, again, that music's made by limbo. So very cool. 20 tezos edition of 27. Nice piece. And here just posted by mech txt some cool ms dos works here. Nice tiling. Again.
01:10:47.100 - 01:11:01.644, Speaker A: Ultima inspired works. Beautiful, beautiful. Gotta love the backgrounds here. I just love this whole series. Good morning. Txt here is Myu as we really have to start going faster here. Cybernetic.
01:11:01.644 - 01:11:20.376, Speaker A: Just a cool work from Myu. What is this edition of? Ten for 350 and a few picked up so far. Very cool there. And here's that work that braindead picked up. Broken Gba. Pretty nice. Just getting poetic, as braindead was mentioning.
01:11:20.376 - 01:11:53.236, Speaker A: So this is muji with another really cool kind of cycling, you know, abstraction, really. It's really impressive how muji gets these beautiful abstractions here in the screens and then really gets the color right oftentimes with these just off kilter greens and gray greens and the buttons and everything. A little bit of power there. That is an addition of 15 for eight tazos. Fuseline already. Let's continue. Here's green Ginger.
01:11:53.236 - 01:12:11.372, Speaker A: Rise of masterpieces. So we were seeing some of these in process. And here we see this kind of interesting flash here. And there's the scream and almost the wanderer here. DER Wanderer. But Caspar David Friedrich, and of course van Gogh there with a plant on it, growing. Plant growing out.
01:12:11.372 - 01:12:31.048, Speaker A: So they're coming out of their works. Rise of masterpieces. Five tezos edition of 20. Here's Chaz Pokefight. And we'll see if the music plays. Pretty fun. Very cool.
01:12:31.048 - 01:12:47.904, Speaker A: So that is Pokefight. That is an edition of 20 for 350 on object. Here's one by Glitchtown arcade underwater. And this is also on object. So again, kind of glitch rom there. Nice colors in there, by the way, that is only $0.99 edition of 30.
01:12:47.904 - 01:13:19.780, Speaker A: And here's the work, also by Sabato, a kind of conceptual piece. Generative artist. So maybe we need to restart this, but let's see if we can figure it out. Maybe it's about to start here. So maybe you just click something and then things start to happen. This is on Zora 19, minted so far. Look at how actually code beautiful maybe you just hit the click button and it starts making different works.
01:13:19.780 - 01:13:37.680, Speaker A: I don't think it's interactive. So from the myster Mario, paint, that beautifully titled series there. That's on Zora. Check it out. Get the deets on Sabato's home on Twitter there. The bloom. This is by Svezer, if I'm not mistaken.
01:13:37.680 - 01:13:52.916, Speaker A: Just an interesting pixel artwork. Very unusual. We saw another one the other day. Very kind of unique take on pixel art. The bloom, that is three tezos edition of ten. And here's Kyle Flemmer with a very minimal work called Mars. A little bit of a drop shadow on there.
01:13:52.916 - 01:14:21.384, Speaker A: And here you see what looks like Mars colors here, maybe the planet there. And that is 840 by 15 by 15 pixels is over here. Interesting size, you know, and again, you're kind of back to ordinals. Whenever I see small scale, you know, stuff like this, especially some of element lis. This is element liquid. You know, you do the two color work on ordinals, could be still really cheap to mint walls and gardens, 300 by 256. So just.
01:14:21.384 - 01:14:44.506, Speaker A: I'm not sure if element Li is minting any of their work right now. Starting to go outside the edges a little bit, which is an interesting move. You see it here, too. Starting to experiment and push things further here. Always experimenting, really, but starting to push things a little bit in interesting directions here, called map. Interesting title. Element ly being just super interesting, as usual.
01:14:44.506 - 01:15:03.474, Speaker A: Pulse zero, zero. A new one by Braun. And interesting piece here with, again, a couple of layers here. Static and dynamic pixels. And just an interesting pixel art, abstract, for lack of a better term. Here's another one. Jada is the artist.
01:15:03.474 - 01:15:37.084, Speaker A: So a new one from Jada. Again, kind of low res, almost pixel art, animated, abstract. And here is Louise Andre Gamma, whose fractals we've been looking at some interesting colors here in this fractal art, the infidelity of color. And here's Lucas Lejeune with, again, this uses after effects, and I always forget what the other piece is. But pretty cool how it transforms through different shapes from circles to squares. Really nice piece. And continuing on, Santiago ruao, who's at the residency.
01:15:37.084 - 01:15:57.624, Speaker A: And how are we doing here? Gonna finish in the next ten minutes, I think so this is on Zora, if I don't freeze. Here we go. So this is on Zora that you can get this work playing with red. And again, what almost looks like asymmetric writing. Amnesia. This is walk, eight tazos. This is an edition of one.
01:15:57.624 - 01:16:12.160, Speaker A: So interesting piece here. I'm not sure what the reference is usually there is one nice noise in there. That colorful noise. Cool title. Interesting piece. This is Kyle Flemmer. This is 14 minutes, so we can't play too much.
01:16:12.160 - 01:16:39.544, Speaker A: This is kyle Flemmer, itzel, rihanna, empal naga, and Agnes Evergrace. 14 minutes. We'll see if anything. So pretty epic piece. How much is that? That's zero additions. This one was burned. There may be a new one.
01:16:39.544 - 01:16:51.636, Speaker A: Very cool. Here is bosque gratias. Dreamland caves. Cool title. This is an edition of one for only ten tezos. That is very rare for bosque gratias. To do an edition of one for ten tezos.
01:16:51.636 - 01:17:14.308, Speaker A: Get it while you can. If I don't get there first. American hustle. So this is awesome. Kurt Hustle collective kind of reminds you that this is CNN from the nineties. Hilarious american hustle games by Kurt Husserl. This place is like a jungle.
01:17:14.308 - 01:17:36.164, Speaker A: Let's go. Just hilarious. Hilarious edition of 25 for three tezos. Get it while you can. And here's Kurt Hussle collective on Zora, dolphin zone. So pretty cool here. Awesome to see Kurt hussle collective on Zora there.
01:17:36.164 - 01:17:54.900, Speaker A: Cool dolphins. Here's Kiro with some beautiful work here. Nice composition, great color. Kiro looks beautiful. Very interesting piece. This is called formation two edition of one for 13 tezos on object. And here's lb with a super richly textured piece.
01:17:54.900 - 01:18:13.624, Speaker A: What's done is done. And just a beautiful gif here of this lion walking forward. Great textures there. Analog video glitch. Here's Nicholas Sassoon with some beautiful. I don't know if I wouldn't call it just a RGB study. Let's call it another window with a view.
01:18:13.624 - 01:18:51.080, Speaker A: Just beautiful color in these works. And here is house of the model. This has a really interesting start. I don't know if we're going to be able to play that, though. Check out this work by. How's the model? If it plays? I love how the colors come in here, just to give you a feel. Sounds awesome and looks great, too.
01:18:51.080 - 01:19:14.376, Speaker A: Weird grip, exmortal and host of the model, all working together there for a piece called zoo or Zed and transferred to phosphor operator. So very cool. We thank you and we love you. Beautiful. Here's another one by lb, improvised jam. So just working in the studio there and finding hidden gold, so to speak. That's three tezos edition of 15.
01:19:14.376 - 01:19:35.600, Speaker A: Already selling four. Here's exmortal, a work called candles. Nice piece here. Just beautiful processing. And this is, again, exmortals. We have another one, Hellburner antwork mix edition of 20 for ten tezos each. And just gorgeous color here as my computer struggles.
01:19:35.600 - 01:19:59.038, Speaker A: I love these lines too. In the background adds so much. There's so much newness and rich textures that we from these video glitch artists. Here's Renky, who we saw the strobe from before. Misadani, I think releases something every day, if I'm not mistaken. Very interesting piece here. I think we have another one too.
01:19:59.038 - 01:20:20.722, Speaker A: This was eye catcher tekihara again, I think, out of Japan. So interesting piece here. Kind of playing with different kind of style there. Luis Andre gama. So I think this was our fractal artist that we were looking at earlier here. So interesting piece here. This is from light trap series of 2022.
01:20:20.722 - 01:20:42.378, Speaker A: And here's another fractal work by Luis Andre Gama. This is posted on object. So making fractals pretty darn interesting. And nice color here too. Just interesting. Interesting, isn't it? Infidelity of color is the series edition of one and not listed yet. This is Koda Nakazono on Zora.
01:20:42.378 - 01:20:55.848, Speaker A: So lots of people. I love how a lot of people are going on Zora. This is a beautiful work here. Almost has a CGI feel to it. 29 minted so far. And I think it's worth it because ETH is going up. So I think, you know, each mint is probably worth a little bit more money.
01:20:55.848 - 01:21:20.052, Speaker A: I think this was hilarious. Martin Joe, coffee break. The failed artist. There's the failed artist from earlier getting Martin Joe's coffee cup treatment. And there's the hot dog and the fries. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant work from Martin Jo. Nice one.
01:21:20.052 - 01:21:45.384, Speaker A: And who is this? Helio Santos, who does the paint plotter. Look at this. This is super interesting, as you see. Are these drones? Maybe this is video AI, I don't know. But those red lines are beautiful. Just super interesting. Surveillance system detecting aliens crossing the desert.
01:21:45.384 - 01:22:00.514, Speaker A: Very cool. And here is Parsa Mostagim with another. I don't think we looked at this one. Marlboro cigarettes getting bent. I think Dali would like this piece here. And just very cool work with matches. The mischievous adventures of Professor Clownboy.
01:22:00.514 - 01:22:19.778, Speaker A: And here is Kuhei Yamashita with a cool GLB. Let me quickly, actually, maybe we'll have a video here. I just want to write Luciana Guerra here is Okot. I almost started with this. This was quite brilliant, I thought. There's a great title here. Watching the fall of the west.
01:22:19.778 - 01:22:47.204, Speaker A: So all these, you know, people from the global south looking at the fall of the west on their phones. Quite an interesting piece. Quite a beautiful, interesting, provocative piece. A very 2024 piece. Edition of seven for 253, still available. And here is a campfire rebellious spirit, kind of playing, seemingly with a little bit of maybe video AI here. So cool experimentation from Okote.
01:22:47.204 - 01:22:58.764, Speaker A: And look who's back. I think this is a new one. Again, you could have started with this too. Inigo bilbao. The rat is the bait. So I think we have a new Mickey Mouse here. I don't think we saw this one before.
01:22:58.764 - 01:23:31.482, Speaker A: You just gotta love what's going on here. The kind of misaligned AI Mickeys. Brilliant, gorgeous. I mean, again, that's. That's like, you know, and like, if I'm Moma and I'm putting it, and if I'm putting my tash and book together, I want to put like, boom, you know, like again, I think, like, what would I put in order to not get, you know, because you'd be thinking of all the criticism you're going to get, like, what would you put to silence the critics? I'd put that Mickey Mouse, you know, all to say. Let's continue here. Lily illo with his beautifully painted chair.
01:23:31.482 - 01:23:44.954, Speaker A: Beautiful. Kind of has a modernist feel to it. Just more gorgeousness there. And here is strange thing, a strange toy. Gotta love this. Almost like an action figure with all the parts of your life. Your watch, your phone.
01:23:44.954 - 01:24:11.474, Speaker A: Beautiful and brilliant from strange thing, a strange toy. And interesting developments here from strange thing on the basketball. Look at these basketballs. These almost designer basketballs. So we continue to see the power of AI to really reconceptualize, you know, fashion and just design. Here's Teux with a couple of works. This is going to be in on verse.
01:24:11.474 - 01:24:31.518, Speaker A: So a couple of works here on verse. So interesting series from tewks here. Isle of Alsina, if I'm not mistaken. Skamra Tower one. So here we have a building, another AI building from Skamra. And here is more work from Skomra. Really beautiful piece.
01:24:31.518 - 01:24:48.382, Speaker A: Gotta love the color. Again, stable diffusion, textual inverters. And here is Danielle King. Les des Amis. Kind of almost has the feeling of a Renoir, but, you know, probably these AI created figures. Very interesting piece. And more contemporary.
01:24:48.382 - 01:25:10.952, Speaker A: Demon ego with a piece playing around with the AI and sneakers here. And interesting kind of play on the background there. Almost feels feeding in some of demon ego's other works with the graph paper there. And here's little cakes with a super cool work. I think this is just posted on Twitter. Here's another workroom tonight. Very cool.
01:25:10.952 - 01:25:21.496, Speaker A: Love this piece. Wild. Here's Sky Goodman. I love the sneaker ad for no one. I gotta love that. And there's the sneakers again, so plain. Had put out a few sneaker ads.
01:25:21.496 - 01:25:47.158, Speaker A: Here's no hygiene with a few works here I really love. Again, I think of Harold Cohen when I think of these kind of rough edges here. Three sphere. So this is made with mid journey. Here's another wild one here, as you can see, really wild AI art here. Pushing the boundaries and kind of a nice minimal one here. So you gotta love it.
01:25:47.158 - 01:26:03.616, Speaker A: You have to love it. That's all. No hygiene. And then into the physicals we go. This is Yoa o Salazar with a Boston dynamics dog here in this new work in progress. Here's machine with a pretty cool work here. What is this called? Minute work, 2024 acrylic on canvas.
01:26:03.616 - 01:26:48.704, Speaker A: So, again, using a lot of spray and these interesting kind of cool kind of masking techniques here, I think we saw it's almost like gummy substance to kind of make the mask here. Anyway, just really cool work from machine Bondozo Bandido, who I show here almost every episode, because has new, interesting work, always provocative. A little bit of color in there for good measure. I'm inspired by that artist, by the prolificness, and a genius work by walk here. I mean, we have to understand this is just spray, but we completely see the van Gogh portrait here. Really brilliant work here from walk, as usual, who, of course, I follow that as an x glitch when I open 50,000 tabs. Adam Lister studio.
01:26:48.704 - 01:27:14.790, Speaker A: Another van Gogh pastiche here, this time doing it, sunflowers, watercolor, and making a physical out of it. From Adam Lister studio, here's Zoe Kim and another kind of almost loose kind of spray paint work. This is, I believe, a physical. And here's Mark Belden with some beautiful flowers here on this paper. Gouache on Saint Armand paper, NIF 2024. Here's bosquet. Grazias.
01:27:14.790 - 01:27:33.588, Speaker A: You see the cyanotype from the workshop, Macchi leaf. So very cool there. Three tezos, edition of ten. And this is hilarious, motto 583. There's something very lo fi, but just wonderful about these little drawings here. Remember this artist, it's the same artist. And that, my friends, is your show.
01:27:33.588 - 01:27:42.364, Speaker A: I have to run. Thank you for joining me. And again, thank you for all the support for watching this far, the patience with the video. Until next time, take care.
