00:00:04.080 - 00:00:35.964, Speaker A: Take one on this first day of spring. Welcome back, everyone. I am feeling the energy of the sun in my visual field, and there's nothing like it after the six months of cloud and darkness in Berlin, Germany. Welcome back. Artist Journal, March 20. The spring equinox, broadcasting from the pirate ship in the sky, where there are hardly any clouds to look down on. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and the progress continues.
00:00:35.964 - 00:01:14.548, Speaker A: I continue to finish this an hour ahead of time here, as per the last episode here. So that is very exciting. And, of course, time is of the essence. I don't know about you, but that tweet we were looking at last episode by Nick from Gamma IO was a bit of a wake up call as far as I'm concerned about minting art on bitcoin, you know? And what Nick was saying, to recap was the. We're gonna. The havening. The havening, which I actually brought up.
00:01:14.548 - 00:01:42.744, Speaker A: I brought up the date of spring, which is actually Wednesday, March 20, 2024. This morning at 04:06. Spring, my friends, is 7 hours and six minutes old, as I say this to you. So that is something to rejoice on. And, you know, just one more thing on spring, you know, like, you know, when it becomes spring in Canada and Germany's not that different, although it's a little warmer. I call it Florida light to German. To.
00:01:42.744 - 00:02:15.896, Speaker A: To German's amusement, especially here in Berlin, where it's a little cooler, you know, when it's over in Canada is when you've been psychologically defeated and you think spring will never happen. That is when spring arrives in Canada. It is not easy, and it's not that different here. So, again, something to rejoice on. But maybe the date we should be more focused on is April 20. As far as Google is telling me, the next bitcoin happening is estimated to take place on April 20, 2024. Only 38.
00:02:15.896 - 00:02:37.330, Speaker A: Is that. Is that 38 days? You know, for all the AI out there, that's not 38 days from now. We're on. It's a month from now. Today is March 20. So all to say, if Nick is right, that the fees are going to get exponentially, I guess they'll get twice as expensive. He's saying.
00:02:37.330 - 00:03:13.554, Speaker A: It's become, like, mind meltingly expensive, from what I remember of the tweet, to paraphrase. So if this is something you want to do, now is the time to be thinking about it and minting it. As Nick said, put it on now. Kind of figure out what you're going to do with it later. So just a heads up here, I may even take Friday off. Let's see if there are, like, just if people put out an insane amount of masterpieces. I may feel the need to put out a quick show on Friday, but I'm tempted to take off Friday again.
00:03:13.554 - 00:03:58.640, Speaker A: We have to get our work on bitcoin. Those who are interested, I know not bitcoin's not everybody's cup of tea for the environmental reasons, but for those where you've decided, made your own decision and feel that you should do this, time is of the essence. So let's begin. We have the wonderful Silva Santus, who I hadn't seen from for a while. I think maybe because Silva was on Zora and I had had, and this was before the follow function on Zora, which I'm still sorting out. But we have a new one from Silva Santu, an open edition, ten minted, so far only a Tezos 30. And a wonderful work that was posted by John Cates, the cowboy, our glitch cowboy out of Taipei there.
00:03:58.640 - 00:04:20.050, Speaker A: John Cates posted this. And what a great eye John Cates had. And you have to love this work. You know, there's something about horses running that feels like a massive metaphor for what we're doing here right now. It's kind of like the ship. There's also the horse just running. We're all running to our.
00:04:20.050 - 00:04:47.686, Speaker A: Wherever it is we're going. A lot of us. You know, again, I think I haven't mentioned this for, again, probably a couple hundred shows. One of my favorite JG Ballard lines from a novel around 2000 was the last illusion of air flight, is that we have a destination. And as I was going to say, a lot of us are running and we're not. The destination is not exactly clear, right? So. But we're running and we feel like we're going somewhere.
00:04:47.686 - 00:05:17.346, Speaker A: And so again, the running horse, which Silva Santos, I think we started. I started a show, actually, maybe, you know, probably 150 episodes ago with Silva Santu's horse. So we're back with this wonderful theme. And it's beautifully glitched. Now, this is kind of on a squarish kind of canvas here, but when you put it on a nice wide monitor, full screen, do it. If you buy this work, put it on your widescreen monitor, if you have one. And again, the hair has a life of its own these days.
00:05:17.346 - 00:05:41.712, Speaker A: Every day isn't. The sun is new each day with the hair, to quote Heraclitus. So all to say, look at this. Just a fun, cool, pretty rad work again. And it's easy to kind of. It's easy to dismiss or to. Let's just be casual about, yeah, nice glitch, and then move on.
00:05:41.712 - 00:06:17.064, Speaker A: But let's not forget what's going on here. We have a very wide screen. Like silver sand twos is upsetting expectations a little bit. We're a very wide screen and we have this kind of interesting background, which is changing colors, which turns to just pure cubes there, those hexadecimal maybe cubes. So. And then as the horse runs through the digital ether, so, you know, from landscape to just that contrast between that green with the hexadecimal, if I'm saying that right, to where we are right now. And even the inverse inverting.
00:06:17.064 - 00:06:45.324, Speaker A: Nice move. So by silver Silva Santuz horse racing three. And again, this is an open edition, only a tezos 30, $1.52. For those that are paying attention to the fiat. We just saw another gorgeous work by Silva Santu's last episode, vacations two. We looked at highways. So Silva sand two s is, you know, again, I never even saw the football work.
00:06:45.324 - 00:07:07.760, Speaker A: We can take a quick look at that. Look at all these great works. So again, Silva san twos, this is their object page. There's a ton. I don't want to crash my computer here. Don't attempt the computer gods, but I'll just say Silva san two, sticking with the glitch, Rom. And really, you know, going somewhere with it again, kind of running somewhere seems to be going somewhere.
00:07:07.760 - 00:07:33.814, Speaker A: To our earlier discussion here. Here's another one. Glitchy's ate my neighbors, almost looking like zombies on the football field here, being glitched out with UFO's and everything. What is. What on earth is going on here? Pretty cool, though. You know, another thing with the last one we were looking at, another kind of mind trick is always to imagine. Imagine you're putting this in a physical museum or gallery.
00:07:33.814 - 00:08:09.676, Speaker A: Again, you put this on a widescreen and you'll know what I'm talking about. You could just have an entire wall, the screen. In a sense, the ratio of this situation here on ObS is not doing justice to this work because you could just imagine this one long wall in the gallery or museum, and then you're really going to start to feel the power of this work. All to say, beautiful work here from Silva Santos, I believe, out of Brazil. I brought up and cool work here, seven tezos edition of seven. And there's Kiro picking one up. Here's another one.
00:08:09.676 - 00:08:41.546, Speaker A: Roll up. So. And playing with movement, interestingly as well, in a lot of these glitches, in this kind of scrolling movement that, you know, is kind of reminiscent, we might say, of Ed Marolla. And again, here is the X account. Only 690 followers, surprisingly, on Zora out of Brazil. So go give Silva sand twos a follow if you are into the glitchrom business. So coming up again a little earlier here for us in Europe than usual.
00:08:41.546 - 00:08:58.032, Speaker A: 230, usually it's 330. But there is the time change that happens first in North America still at 09:30 a.m. Eastern time. And I will, I believe this is pinned in the tweets. You don't know who we are. So we're going to find out who they are. You don't know who we are.
00:08:58.032 - 00:09:24.870, Speaker A: And they have the ancient tokens, GLB virtual exhibition, the virtual sculpture show that they put together. There's a lot of excitement over on this, so I'm excited. So it should be cool. That's what's runetune today. So maybe by the time you watch it, it'll either be happening or will have happened, but it will be in the feed if you want to listen to it. And here is, you don't know how we are posting. Doing a little music business here.
00:09:24.870 - 00:09:47.300, Speaker A: A little window into the studio and the balcony and the drums on the balcony. The neighbors, if that is a balcony, the neighbors must be very happy with that. But maybe they prefer it to the guy screaming every morning out the window over here. So. And look at how cool that is. Maybe that's just a room for the drums. Pretty cool.
00:09:47.300 - 00:10:06.188, Speaker A: So that is happening today. And onto the comments we go. Visual reasons our last episode. Mandal. Thank you so thank you very much again for sharing. Tuna walla Walla, my art with music by P one again. And thank you, P one, for that stained glass pixel work that you sent me.
00:10:06.188 - 00:10:19.880, Speaker A: And you're welcome, man. It'll. I believe we have another winner by you here today, a really nice one. So you're more than welcome. Manadol, just an awesome artist macro. So this Marco, who is limbo. Hi, Adrian Limbo here.
00:10:19.880 - 00:10:47.894, Speaker A: Great, great to know you're learning Italian. My mother tongue, great curation, has always loved the first piece. And I have to say I'm really enjoying right now going to the gym and learning Italian and then making my little art for bitcoin as fast as I can while I can. That is my simple life here. So anyways, maybe one day we'll talk in Italian. Marco, I'm using Babbel. Babbel live where they actually do classes.
00:10:47.894 - 00:11:28.654, Speaker A: So it's actually like where you actually, you know, it's six people max. I recommend it because again, learning a language just by not but not speaking is basically as I tell people, it's like reading a textbook on how to, how to build muscle at the gym, right? It's kind of similar. So you just kind of got to go and you actually got to work the muscle. And that includes language muscles there. Eduardo Pulitzer, also known as Ed Morolla. You want to make me get up and cheer. That is one of my favorite little anecdotes that I was saying there about how JG Ballard, when he was reading naked lunch by William Burroughs, like within the first page, he got up and cheered.
00:11:28.654 - 00:11:44.784, Speaker A: And you got to love that spirit there, Ballard. I just. Yeah, one of my favorites there. So indeed, awesome to hear, Ed and that is hilarious. Tomb and battle. Awesome to hear from you and Rada. Damn.
00:11:44.784 - 00:12:15.284, Speaker A: Ex destroying artists dream and taking money from scammers and criminals. So business as usual really out on the Wild west of the Internet, isn't it? And we're going to hear a little bit more about that. And also, awesome to hear from you, Rada, as ever. And that beautiful work we had in last episode by you. Can't wait to see if that was the full thing or we'll find out. So, paying attention there also comments on the x episode. And again, thank you for the response here, psycho futurists.
00:12:15.284 - 00:12:36.690, Speaker A: Thanks for featuring my work twice in this edition. I think you're back, psycho futurists. So welcome. And Zoni Yegar, also great to hear from you and thank you for the comments or the emojis. Elie Lo thanks, Adrian. I support the Zach's words about not getting hung up on losing money. I sold my board ape on a start for about 0.6
00:12:36.690 - 00:13:19.706, Speaker A: ETH and a cast. And of course at the height I think so probably sold it for a couple of time or maybe less $15,000. Thinking Elie Lo did wonderful. Of course, bored apes by the time at the peak were probably worth about close from $250 to $500,000 each. So in a sense, Zach was saying you can't feel too bad about the opportunities you miss in crypto. And really, it just goes to show there I lost the thing that was worth a few thousand bucks that I only paid $1,000 for. That's now worth 20 or 15 now, whatever it is, the bitcoin puppet.
00:13:19.706 - 00:13:38.794, Speaker A: And we have to also, we have to realize there are so many opportunities. It's like, oh, you missed on that opportunity. I missed on this opportunity. It's like crypto. Like, I think it's really wise as artists to be involved in the crypto ecosystem. It's a wonder. It's easier than the stock market.
00:13:38.794 - 00:14:06.162, Speaker A: Not financial advice, but it's. You're not competing. And again, just to wrap it up here, most of the airdrops I've gotten, most of the kind of free stuff or whatever I've gotten is from actually making art. Say, optimism. That was because I made art. You know, even the bitcoin got the runestone. Why? Because I minted some ordinals, right? And they didn't even.
00:14:06.162 - 00:14:28.776, Speaker A: One of them sold. Thank you, Luke. 500. But some didn't even sell. And maybe that worked to my advantage, because then the ordinals stayed in my wallet. So life is ironic, right? Because if all of a sudden I'd been happy and sold them, I wouldn't have gotten into the snapshot, because I wouldn't have had three ordinals. So life is super ironic, and you just have to, when bad things happen, say, like this, you can't get hung up on it.
00:14:28.776 - 00:14:44.670, Speaker A: Anyways, let's continue with what Ellie says. And it's just great to hear from Elie Lo. Everything could end tomorrow. Exactly, exactly. And often do in a case of. In the case of hyped projects. That's why I love an honest Tezos art, because you can't fall below the bottom.
00:14:44.670 - 00:15:05.886, Speaker A: Exactly. Like the value continues to be in Tazos art. It's true. So there's something to be said for that with work selling for a dollar, as we just saw with Silva sand twos, you can pick up that work in an open edition. It's now ten editions for $1.50. Right. So it's kind of hard to beat that.
00:15:05.886 - 00:15:25.186, Speaker A: Go buy some art at the art fair. How much is that going to cost you? It's going to cost you $30 to walk in the door if you don't have your little vip pass. Right. So, again, just a sign of how many. How many opportunities there are here. Yacht. Thank you for featuring my work.
00:15:25.186 - 00:15:32.890, Speaker A: Boko Bell. Absolutely. A total pleasure. Juana. Pedro. Thank you for showing my work. Adrian, I think we have an AI work by you, Juana, so great to hear from you.
00:15:32.890 - 00:15:55.124, Speaker A: And I think you posted that in the. In the community there. So, again, that works if people. I still get messages and comments sometimes in YouTube. How do you know, how do you get on the roster or whatever if you want to be on the show, how do I put it posted in the community, which we'll look at in a second here. Cider, awesome to hear from you, as ever. And cider just put out.
00:15:55.124 - 00:16:24.074, Speaker A: I'm tempted. Cider's making huge sales two days ago, made a nice, these kind of points, 6.7 ETH sales. These are like 1819 sales that cider is doing. So cider is continuing to sell out, almost like selling all ciders work in what's considered a difficult time for ETH. So I don't. The market has just become much more selective right now.
00:16:24.074 - 00:16:52.226, Speaker A: So if you can get into that little area that collectors still feel that they can trade and that there's liquidity, you can still do really well. Right now on Ethereum, right, where it's really kind of slowed down a bit. I mean, we see that with super rare. Why is super rare in ordinals? Is it because Ethereum is the main place to be for art and we don't need any other blockchain. Of course not. And I applaud them for that. I think it's a brilliant move.
00:16:52.226 - 00:17:06.900, Speaker A: Let's work with Gamma. That'll be great. We're very curious to see how that works. Waiting for the new episode. Awesome. And you're, I think you're in that episode three times, so I hope you enjoyed that. And Kells is actually in this episode too.
00:17:06.900 - 00:17:18.384, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you, Kells, as ever. And NUV 1914, who we started with. Great to hear from you. Go, go Lightus. Awesome to hear from you. He works this episode. Ranix Dear awesome to hear from you, Kanik Zapata.
00:17:18.384 - 00:17:31.430, Speaker A: And actually, there was an important post here. The original post had a collection error, so I reminted it. Thanks for the mention. So this was reminted. And you gotta love this cloud here. Very original. Interesting work from Canix Abda.
00:17:31.430 - 00:17:52.882, Speaker A: So thank you for the comments. And again, if you want to just get on the radar here, feel free to join the party as bulls is here sharing work here from Zora. So cool. Always has the dancing ants from Photoshop selection brought into the work. I just absolutely love that. And they're across here. Here's Juana Pedro.
00:17:52.882 - 00:18:20.162, Speaker A: This work is in this show as well as this work here. So I don't. And we have a work by Martin Joe, a different work. And also. Yeah. So all to say there is great opportunity or if you just want to share your work, I mean, that's the hardest part, especially if you're starting out, I think a macro matry here who just started out this is a great place for you because, you know, starting out, nobody sees the work. Feel like you're not getting the reach.
00:18:20.162 - 00:18:44.340, Speaker A: Feel free to join the party there. A big thank you to Teagenhof and the gift gallery for they are doing a Paul Clay homage. And I have added a piece here. And I think this is actually going to be later. I may have screwed up the order a little bit here, but this is. We're going to see more on this in a few. In about five or six tabs here.
00:18:44.340 - 00:19:17.980, Speaker A: We're going to come back to the collection here. A little out of order, as I. You see a little behind the scenes there of all the work of organizing, preciously organizing these tabs in the proper order. This was posted by our good Twitter. My guilty pleasure, Twitter. Follow who posted this France 24 article from Agence France Press Vienna gets first museum on actionist art movement. And I thought this was quite interesting.
00:19:17.980 - 00:19:54.944, Speaker A: This is Vienna actionists push the limits, not shying away from using blood, urine, and excrement. So this is probably blood. So all to say, you can still shock, like, that's pretty shocking. It hits us, and that's why I'm kind of mentioning this. It's quite interesting, isn't it, when you consider this as blood, like, it affects us on a very deep level, a biological level, rather than this just simply being paint. And it seems extreme, right? Painting with real blood. So truly shocking.
00:19:54.944 - 00:20:28.184, Speaker A: And I thought, so Herman niche, I wonder if that was Herman niche there, who is one of these kind of wild artists, and they're from the 1960s, interestingly. And let's actually read a couple of lines here. There's hardly anything comparable to the radicalism of the viennese actionists, said art historian Eva Badura Triska. She picked the close to 100 works on display for the opening. Looks like quite a show. Like, you know, they dealt with the. Both the body and the human psyche very, very intensely and without taboos.
00:20:28.184 - 00:20:55.536, Speaker A: Very interesting and kind of, you know, again, you don't even want to say it, but, like, pretty nice brushwork or, you know, splashing. Like, it's a nice piece. Even if this was just red paint, the blood kind of makes it ten times more intense. So all to say, wow, someone was even jailed. Okay, yeah. So all sorts of sketchiness here. Niche is exhibited.
00:20:55.536 - 00:21:30.040, Speaker A: He's probably the most famous of them that I've heard of. Gunter Bruce, Otto mull, Herman niche and Rudolph Schwarzkogler pushed the limits. So, yeah, very interesting there. Switching gears, Dina Chang, a glimpse into our creative process at Seta studio. So this is, I think, the collaborator with Dina Chang, captured here. I think Tim, here it is, Timothy's accenti, captured here as part of a wider campaign for Adobe. So Dina has helped co host the show when Rune Thun was away there in Asia.
00:21:30.040 - 00:22:11.460, Speaker A: So she was mentioning this. And here, Adobe creative cloud, and I think that's Dena there, and there's Tim and everything they're up to. So, pretty cool, isn't it? The world gets a little smaller when you see stuff like this, so. And I think Dina was working on like an Oscar party or something, or something like Grammy after party, who knows, all to say, up to all sorts of interesting stuff there in LA. Back to bitcoin. So this was what I was looking for yesterday by Lucretia Lucrese, who was putting together a collection on magic Eden. Now the floor is 0.2,
00:22:11.460 - 00:22:42.862, Speaker A: and you see just very minimal works here. So again, you know, keeping down the minting fees. And how many are there? Total supply of 150. Right. So again, opportunity knocks here with these bitcoin collections and everything, maybe you only have a month before things get even more expensive, you know, limiting options. So, looking pretty good there on magic Eden. Continuing on LA Low.
00:22:42.862 - 00:23:22.510, Speaker A: I pack my case, I checked my face, I look a little bit older, I look a little bit colder. So that's the killers I didn't notice, but trash bags were trash beige, Vega were started more than one and a half years ago. I feel like I was there. I feel like this show was there when Elie Lowe started. We've been showing Elie Lowe since pretty early, a little over a year, I'd say. Never thought about it in this key, but for all this time, it was the only one kind of stable thing in my life. And I know the feeling when you feel like life isn't necessarily going your way or, you know, just things that you can't even control in your life.
00:23:22.510 - 00:23:50.140, Speaker A: One of the beautiful things about art is it's kind of a source of stability. It's kind of like anything can happen around you, but with that. But, you know, but you kind of have a constant there, kind of a source of stability in your art. So, Ellie, interesting comment there. As I fix my hair. I thought this was interesting. Mikey de la creme.
00:23:50.140 - 00:24:12.112, Speaker A: So, of course, 6529, this went around. You own an NFT on Tazos, actually. Let's look at the poll quickly. 50%. Not bad, actually. Pretty good, actually, because you have to get a different wallet on Tazos. A few, but this was really 7156.
00:24:12.112 - 00:24:54.044, Speaker A: And the important thing to remember here, though, is Mikey de la creme. You know, one of the main collectors there on Tazos, as well as great AI artist, great artist. The thing to remember with Mikey is he is like often like buying and selling. So he's probably bought something like 20 or 30,000 works, and this is what it's down to. So, pretty amazing for to have this huge of a collection, you know, maybe 15 or 20,000 Mikey has actually bought, but his son sold a ton too, because Mikey has the eye. So pretty cool. That's a huge collection.
00:24:54.044 - 00:25:12.724, Speaker A: I have created over 3000 NFTs since June 2021. 3000. That's incredible. That's inspiring. Across more than a hundred collections on three different blockchains. This is how it's done. This has brought in over $180,000 from selling my art.
00:25:12.724 - 00:25:45.586, Speaker A: Along the way. You know, like, if people are wondering about this space and the opportunities, this is like a real world story. Along the way, I've made many friends, met numerous collectors and artists, and seen my work sold by Christie's and Sotheby's. I mean, this is all true. My life changed forever when I entered the NFT space. A stark contrast to my early days, when my art, appreciated worldwide since 2014 and exhibited in over 20 countries, earned me exposure instead of money. When my son was born in 2017, I would eat once a day so he could eat twice.
00:25:45.586 - 00:26:26.716, Speaker A: And I believe tooks is out of Brazil. We had the tuks on the show. A very philosophical artist, I might add. I've always been the underdog, the struggling underground artist who didn't even consider himself an artist. Just a troubled, anxious, depressed and addicted mind finding solace in art without any formal training and drawing or painting, nor a university degree. I think a lot of people can relate to this, you know, the forgotten, right? One of the forgotten, one of the ignored, you know, and had maybe a decent cv, but, you know. But since 2021, the NFT space blessed me with a new lease on life, making what seemed unbelievable at first a reality indeed.
00:26:26.716 - 00:26:46.374, Speaker A: Now I'm still curious, eager to learn more and delve deeper into ethereum. Layer two's a brilliant idea. Bitcoin, another brilliant idea. And be fast about it. And ordinals, which is also bitcoin. This journey has changed my life forever, and I'm committed to making this path, this my path for life beyond any point of no return. I am hopeful.
00:26:46.374 - 00:27:33.604, Speaker A: Indeed, so am I. So am I. And just the fact that even if we crash back down to previous slows, just the fact that bitcoin was going back up and breaking the record in itself is a interesting and kind of remarkable situation here. Now, interestingly. So here's a quick. So, of course a lot of us have tea coins from Tea cafe or I think actually the Teia, which is the new version of Hikat, Nunc or Han, which is a. For those that don't know it is a platform on Tezos, there's object, which is a platform, hen or tea is actually the new version of it is another platform.
00:27:33.604 - 00:28:38.534, Speaker A: And they gave a token, a crypto, to people who have bought and sold on the chain and done various things on the chain on their platform. So this is the crypto tea holders, this is a red flag. So this is a crypto trader, and this is Ryan, who is one of the people behind tea. It's kind of weird how raising money from angels and VC's, it's much more viable for me now than it was a few years ago, but now I'm like, for what? The money would just get in the way at this point. I really don't want it right now, especially knowing how much paperwork might get involved if we say yes. So all to say, basically, if I had to sum this up, is they're not looking, if I have Ryan's. To sum it up, this is a governance token, is how they are, how Ryan is presenting it, not a value, not a speculative token.
00:28:38.534 - 00:29:54.074, Speaker A: And as such, Ryan's saying, well, there's no point speculating here because we don't even want that. But I thought to myself, though, I'm not sure if you can decide that, in a sense, and I own teia tokens, by the way, for transparency here, but if it's a governance token, ultimately that means if someone owns more than 50% of it, they can basically, for all intents and purposes, control the direction of that platform. So. And doesn't that inherently have financial value? So all to say, I think they've done a wonderful job of fixing up that website from hen and tea, they've done a brilliant job over at tea. But I'm not sure you can divorce governance over the protocol that governs the platform and the direction of it and value, because that platform is worth something. So I'm just not sure if you can just say, well, we call it a governance token, but then it's not going to be worth any, and just, just declare it's not going to be worth anything. I'm not sure you can do that.
00:29:54.074 - 00:30:15.604, Speaker A: So I guess we'll find out. But interesting. So this person was concerned because it wasn't turning into a speculate. They sounded like there was reservation from the tea people on the speculative nature of the crypto. So just kind of an interesting thread there. Santiago now wi fi hat with hat. I still think Tezos is cool.
00:30:15.604 - 00:30:33.140, Speaker A: I can never tell if santiago is trolling here. Yesterday I entered for like 20 minutes a telegram with Tezos people. They were great, but I couldn't stay. They had no idea who I was. You don't research Tezos artist? It's not my vanity. I'm a public Tezos artist beyond how I feel about it. And there is a.
00:30:33.140 - 00:31:10.972, Speaker A: I mean, Santiago is probably one of the most prominent artists on the Tezos blockchain or just in web3 art. And I don't know if this is true. Let's just say it is, though. But put it this way, the reason I bring it up is there is a disconnect, it seems, between Tezos, the crypto, and whatever it is that they're doing and the artists. And put it this way, let me just, for illustration, bring it all back home. If you. If, if object disappeared off of Tazos.
00:31:10.972 - 00:31:43.654, Speaker A: As someone, I use Tezos, you know, regularly. I've collected an enormous amount of art. I've posted a fair amount of art on tazos. I can't tell you, though, like, tezos is a part of my life in terms of me. Look, look, this show is mostly object tabs you're gonna see here. But with all that being said, with you object in tezos being a part of my life, if you ask me what else is going on on tezos, I couldn't tell you. I would say there's like some sort of decentralized exchange.
00:31:43.654 - 00:32:13.734, Speaker A: There's a couple of them, you know, three something, right? There's also a meme coin called pol. And I don't even know if there's anything else going on. So there is a all to say, there's a disconnect between the. What's going on with the arts on tezos and what else is going on on tazos, if anything. And I don't know if anything is, and I say that genuinely. So just an interesting situation here. So it does kind of illustrate a point whether this is true or not.
00:32:13.734 - 00:32:41.542, Speaker A: I assume it is. Again, you can never tell with Santiago because he trolls a lot. I spent like $20 minting another post by Santiago here. Again, I can't tell if this is trolling, but it's, again, for the sake of illustration, interesting. I spent like $20 minting and listing three nfts on Solana, all good, but keep the low gas fees out of your presentation. So, of course, minting on Solana used to be like a penny and or like something like that, a few cents. It was like tazos.
00:32:41.542 - 00:33:19.220, Speaker A: But of course, the token has risen in price. And I don't know if this is true, but wouldn't that be interesting? Wouldn't that be interesting if all of a sudden the fees on Solana started getting expensive, as the token does, and people are talking about thousand dollar Solana, what does that do to your token? Right? So anyway, let's continue here. And of course, I follow rata. That is an x glitch when you load up 50 tabs here. Santiago carrying the tezos ecosystem above the flame. So just a hilarious post here from Rata on Santiago. Also from Rata.
00:33:19.220 - 00:33:37.832, Speaker A: This is little cakes. Finally able to check out Rata's gallery. While I'm super stoked to have my piece gathering of the chicken profits displayed, I'm really impressed with how and where each piece was placed, choice of wall colors, etcetera. It's my favorite on cyber show I've ever seen. So pretty cool. And it does look very nice. There's some dan control there.
00:33:37.832 - 00:33:55.260, Speaker A: It looks beautifully displayed here with a lot of care. That looks like maybe a rattle work. And there's a big rat in the center. Hilarious. Very nicely displayed here. Right to the edge there. Interestingly, two dan control works of animals.
00:33:55.260 - 00:34:19.760, Speaker A: So we'll have to take a look at this. And here, I would load it up, but it is, it is a computer killer, these on cyber galleries, but if a video shows up, I'll be happy to show that here. And again, there's some rata pfps there. So all hilarious there. Continuing on, Haiti Rockette Internet on March 27. So that's great to see. Haiti rocket back on the scene.
00:34:19.760 - 00:34:40.952, Speaker A: Has been a little quiet on the object account, so that'll be awesome to see. Now, this did go around. So the reason Santiago has the dog with hat aki the dog. So this went. This work here for actually we have the tweet from Artie hands for $4.3 million. And so just the.
00:34:40.952 - 00:35:17.170, Speaker A: And of course, this is based on a meme coin on Solana, as far as I understand. So as you see here, this person at Sheepeach posted a reserve of five ETH and then it was met within four minutes. And then a bidding war started, or, sorry, it was met within 7 hours. And then a bidding war started for which turned into several million dollars. So of course this went around and everything, and there's. The foundation is happy. They probably did really well with their feats there and there.
00:35:17.170 - 00:35:46.914, Speaker A: They even have the Wi Fi, wif hat on the foundation logo there. So arty hands, remember, they'd rather spend $4.3 million on a poor photo of a dog in a hat than buy your art. You know, I love arty hands, but, you know, people will be saying the same thing if they bought art with it. Like, you know, there's hungry people out there, and now you guys are spending millions of dollars on art. In a sense. You can always kind of make this argument to me again, I just go, what a great place to be.
00:35:46.914 - 00:36:21.022, Speaker A: There is enough money in this ecosystem for people to basically blow $4.3 million. And you never know if this is kind of somewhat of an insider trade, but let's assume it's not. It probably isn't, but who knows? 1200 ethics all to say, where would you rather be as an artist? The place where the people are blowing $4.3 million on a photo of a dog and a hat. So finally on that, it could mark a kind of top. This was done on March 19 and.
00:36:21.022 - 00:36:39.818, Speaker A: Or. Sorry, when was the. March 18. Like, it kind of hit the top there. This was like, right before the crash, I think, that we've seen in crypto. Who knows if it's temporary or not, but maybe the sign of a top when that sort of action happens on a financial level. So we got some memes, of course.
00:36:39.818 - 00:36:55.426, Speaker A: Walk great at the memes here for a million, 1.2 million tezos. And, well, that is what it is listed for. Sold for only 1.21 edition of 52. So walk applying the treatment here of the dog with hat. And we have a few others.
00:36:55.426 - 00:37:19.154, Speaker A: Here's Manidol and p one. Just an awesome collaboration there. Tung mang, the calico cat. This version is actually, I would maintain, maybe a little bit more exciting than the one that went for $4 million. Beautiful work. Just brilliant color by manadal there. And awesome music by p one.
00:37:19.154 - 00:37:39.010, Speaker A: I think that's how it's working. Chiptune BGM by p one. Exactly. Pixelated and animated by manadult. So that is edition of 121. And here is Violet trip with work. And you see the Ethereum logo in the background and the Dogwiff hat done in a pixelated way that's on zora formented.
00:37:39.010 - 00:37:57.554, Speaker A: And here's one more pixelare. And there is the price, 1200 ETH, which is $4.3 million. A picture of a dog with a woolly hat sold for 4.3. Nice versions here. Nice homages, so to speak, to that sale. Very nice work.
00:37:57.554 - 00:38:25.620, Speaker A: And finally, acidboy posts a photo of himself on. And it went actually on the homepage of foundation and there was actually a bid on this for 0.01 ETH. So it continues here. Again, as an artist, where would you rather be? You want to be where, like, it's not a bad place to be and your costs are nothing. Go again. I always have to.
00:38:25.620 - 00:39:00.754, Speaker A: We always have to remind ourselves, our friends in the contemporary art trad art scene, going, paying for their studio, paying for their supplies, then they make a work that doesn't work and then all that money's gone. They have to paint over it. At least the paint is, you know, spent, you know, if something doesn't work for us, we make a new file that costs us zero the, you know, a penny maybe, of electricity. Here's the homage to Paul Clay by gift gallery and Tegenhof. So again, thanks for the invite there. There's my piece there and there's Sabato. I brought up a couple.
00:39:00.754 - 00:39:21.562, Speaker A: We can't bring up all of them. There's RJ there and just beautiful pieces here. So this, I believe is going to go live on Friday. Exhibition couture museum Bern in Switzerland. So actually, exhibition couture museum in Bern, Switzerland. So that's pretty cool, too. Kind of feels like a museum exhibition.
00:39:21.562 - 00:39:42.864, Speaker A: Like, will that be in a museum? It seems that way. I brought up a couple of works. Here's Somfe, that kind of jumped out at me. Two observers in the sky. Entire beautiful colors on this one by Somfe. So an interpretation, a homage to Paul Clay. Interestingly, this is the one I did, Sinazio, that famous portrait.
00:39:42.864 - 00:40:10.864, Speaker A: And of course, just giving different treatments here, different kinds of pixelation here, all in one work. And here is a pretty interesting one by Sabato. Fish oils. So maybe there's a famous fish work by Paul Clay. And so playing with that idea, I saw a couple of fish works and then extracting the oil from the fish here, where we get our omega three s. So interesting piece there. Nice kind of noise in the background there, too.
00:40:10.864 - 00:40:39.534, Speaker A: Edition of 25 by Sabato. So cool work there. And so here we begin digital painting. This is rat cloak bones. So another kind of dark looking work here with the faces, you know, kind of either distorted or half missing here. Kind of a concerning work here from Ratcloak. Beautifully painted, looking like in Photoshop, in a field.
00:40:39.534 - 00:40:57.682, Speaker A: Kind of looks like a doctor's office. Or something. Very dark and intense work, as we've come to expect from Ratcloak. Nice kind of brushwork there. Just a great digital painter edition of ten selling for 20 tezos each. And this is sold out. So nice work.
00:40:57.682 - 00:41:27.730, Speaker A: Cool title dates. El ariero, el arriero. This is an edition of ten for fortezos. Another interesting work here. Interesting figure with a cobra in the hands, kind of loosely painted. And going through the wilderness here with hope on the bags in Miseria, the miserable donkey here, carrying the load. An interesting painting.
00:41:27.730 - 00:41:43.106, Speaker A: Nice painting style. Nice color of the sky. From detaste here is rosatio. I missed this work, I think last week. This is called catastrophe playing. I think I missed this work. I think that must have been part of the cat show.
00:41:43.106 - 00:42:09.676, Speaker A: Maybe that rinnefish was a part of there. So there is a cat with a big eyeball and almost like one of those 16th, 17th century collars there and the egg and everything. So just cool work by rosatio. Digital painting Collage Animation 1500 by 2012 frames reserve of 0.3 ETH. And that is on foundation. And here's one.
00:42:09.676 - 00:42:26.230, Speaker A: I think this was posted in the community makera hyper media. And let's see if this loads up here. The computer is struggling here. So we are going to try and keep it to an hour here. Let's see how we see how we do. And so here. Oh, huge file.
00:42:26.230 - 00:42:41.542, Speaker A: No wonder. And so interesting work here. Kind of operating system, windows, another eyeball, tezos logo and everything. Almost looks like a server farm for a head. But maybe it's something different. Hyper media indeed. Edition of twelve selling out at six tazos.
00:42:41.542 - 00:42:59.686, Speaker A: Nice work. And here is rustic digital art. Map of Mar del Plata. Very cool work here. Unfortunately, again, we don't have the maximize on Zora, but we'll go over here. And so pretty cool landscape work. Nice mark making in here by rustic.
00:42:59.686 - 00:43:19.460, Speaker A: I like where this is going. It kind of. This kind of scribbliness contrasts nicely with these background colors. And even just there's a real organic feel to this digital artwork here. A true digital painting. And here's recollapse picture that surrounds my head. This also came out on March 18.
00:43:19.460 - 00:43:42.264, Speaker A: And this is an edition of ten for fortezos forgoing. And so an animated painting here. And again it looks like digital painting that is emulating physical brushwork and texture, interestingly. And animated. So a bit of a hybrid here with recollapse. And so interesting piece here. Nice color.
00:43:42.264 - 00:44:00.714, Speaker A: Fortezos edition of ten. Here's Euxine. This is a free mint for people that own, I think, dread exe all time high. I saw a free mint there and I thought, wow, free mint for Euxine. But I think you have to own one. So own a previous work. So kind of a nice loose work here.
00:44:00.714 - 00:44:39.134, Speaker A: Seems like Euxine is experimenting with looseness, so to speak, here. And these different renditions, these different layers. This is, you know, a great solution here for your gifs is different variations, different layers get turned on in the gif and then animated again, contrasting with this static area here, the movement and the stillness contrasting. That is an addition of nine. I'm not sure if we looked at this, but Rada posted it in the, in the group there. And again, I follow rada, of course, I grabbed the bananas from Amanda. Nice piece, nice grab there.
00:44:39.134 - 00:45:02.474, Speaker A: And I always love stamps too. And so here, nice piece. Nice digital painting of bananas here with a stamp structure. Here's NUV 1914 campesina. So of course we started with Nov 1914. Last episode, only nine tezos still for this edition of one. Not exactly sure what it is, but it looks like a couple of figures here.
00:45:02.474 - 00:45:27.934, Speaker A: And again, a very rich neve 1914 work with some beautiful experimentation here. Again, would just hang really well with Zuozo. Here's another one, romance one. This went to Ahek for nine tazos. Again, it feels like these gradient figures are getting richer and richer here. And more dancers here. Beautiful mark making here and everything.
00:45:27.934 - 00:45:47.534, Speaker A: Just a super interesting and challenging artist romance. And look at the side, just awesome. Going to ahec. This is Austin. Just a post on x here. Kind of looks like one now. I think Austin uses the fire extinguisher as a painting tool.
00:45:47.534 - 00:46:11.074, Speaker A: And so here it looks like a picture of the fire extinguisher with paint all over it, repeated over and over. Making it work actually looks pretty cool, doesn't it? So sharing that here, it looks like a digital painting. No? Pueto hablar. This is by Amanda Haman. And I think we looked at some works by Amanda before. This is a combination of analog and digital. So of drawing here, pretty sure this is graphite.
00:46:11.074 - 00:46:29.194, Speaker A: And this looks physical. And then combined with this digital area here, all together, working pretty well together. And just a little bit of color in there. Analog collage and digital illustration. Edition of five for ten tezos and one sold so far. Here's Zed. I love Zed.
00:46:29.194 - 00:46:53.544, Speaker A: Any or NT. He's repairing our unfriendly chat with his positivity. So pretty cool work here. Again, those instantly recognizable blue and white colors there with this light blue there. Just very cool from Zed. And here's Shili Preston with Daws american nostalgia. So a collaboration here for Shirley Preston.
00:46:53.544 - 00:47:18.564, Speaker A: Kind of an interesting piece. Interesting mix of digital superimposed onto painting or collage. Interesting work there. Kind of a crypto art skull for good measure. And here's relax. Who could also probably hang in the same room here where we have Carvaggio's Jesus. I think this is in Rome, if I remember right.
00:47:18.564 - 00:47:45.432, Speaker A: I think so. When you walk in to Piazza del Popolo, the main entrance into Rome, the gate to the old city, there's a church right on your left. I think this is where that is. Anyways, nice purple version with a big red, almost like a protest sign. Or like a. Just a big brushwork, physical brush with almost like a digital brushwork here. Or a light, who knows? Going through Christ.
00:47:45.432 - 00:48:18.684, Speaker A: So interesting piece from relax. Here's Edmarola with a work. And let's. Let's hit play here. Edition of 21. Zooming in a bit. Interesting work here.
00:48:18.684 - 00:48:45.148, Speaker A: And then zooming out. I wonder if Ed's using the whole procreate dreams for the animation there. So kind of a cryptic work. As the purple music entered my ears, a new dimension arose. And again, a lot of experimentation here. Kind of looks like a figure here, but exported and everything. One going to line Xed for six tezos, edition of 21.
00:48:45.148 - 00:48:59.988, Speaker A: Kind of a wild work here. Part of this series. They are dreaming us. Let's just take a look here. Right? And we saw this epic work last episode. So very interesting rollout, isn't it, of this series. And they are dreaming us.
00:48:59.988 - 00:49:18.806, Speaker A: Kind of getting things started. I think Ed took a bit of a break and now is releasing everything. This is a work in progress from Nikolas Dietrich. So again, we started with that super enigmatic pixel artwork the other day. We see recognizable colors here now playing with the boardroom. Boardroom view at night. A good way to go yet.
00:49:18.806 - 00:49:46.574, Speaker A: So again, pretty interesting to see where this is going to go. Again, a work in progress. Great, mysterious, ambiguous subject matter here. Super interesting. This is by RJ men of culture, after Hans Holbein the younger, the ambassadors. So interesting title there. And we have, of course, this super famous work here of the skull.
00:49:46.574 - 00:50:17.622, Speaker A: Was it like this? I've actually seen this in the museum. I guess that's how it goes across the work. So, Hans Holbein, I can't remember what museum I saw it in, but interesting work here. And again, given RJ's treatment with the snow on the screen and the pastiche here in green and black edition of two. Oxygen picking one up. 33. Tezos Landpix is Francois gamma with a work and looking like taking a photo and giving it some treatment here.
00:50:17.622 - 00:50:45.414, Speaker A: Beautiful colors from France. Wallace Gamma edition of 30 for tutezos, 50. And let's continue. Another interesting piece. So this is p three. So we've seen a few by Francois Gamma using this structure here. And love the color in this one with the brown background, creating a completely different work with a similar kind of animation, different processing, and one going one transferred to John Cates, interestingly, edition of 30.
00:50:45.414 - 00:51:10.136, Speaker A: Some works by Gogolitis are about to go on. Exchange art on Solana, new series, reveries, celestial reveries. And here is the first one, reverie number one. Supply of eight at half a sol each. Let's let it load here and see what happens. Here we go. And so you see the beauty of gogolitis work here.
00:51:10.136 - 00:51:37.504, Speaker A: So playing with a astronomical theme here. So cool work, kind of minimal. And again, you can see the experiments with abstraction and, you know, kind of psychedelic abstraction. Now returning to space as a theme. The planets, the universe. And so here's another one. I think this is number two, and this is price of one sol, this supply of four.
00:51:37.504 - 00:51:52.016, Speaker A: And this is, looks like a one of one. Reverie number three. Interesting sales dynamics there in the different editions. And let this load up. And I think we're good. I think this is loaded up. And there we are.
00:51:52.016 - 00:52:05.624, Speaker A: So another interesting piece. Interesting composition in terms of the canvas size here. So a few works by Gogolitis on Solana. Let's keep running here. Here's braindead. And this is. It's interesting.
00:52:05.624 - 00:52:28.034, Speaker A: I feel like they just started putting the owner up here, which is kind of a nice tribute to the owners here. Again, object. The web designers are very thoughtful in what they're doing. You are broke, so of course, you know, one month you're rich in crypto, the next. The next month you're broke. So maybe this is the next, and then the next month you're rich. That is life in crypto.
00:52:28.034 - 00:52:37.986, Speaker A: So try again. Try again. Exactly. To our earlier discussion there. Nice subject matter here. Very modern subject matter. There's a credit card reader.
00:52:37.986 - 00:53:06.168, Speaker A: I like this a lot in terms of subject matter. The mass, some more kind of enigmatic pixel art here. Mysterious kind of iconography. Kind of feels like a little bit of, how would you put it? Almost like magical kind of feeling. Just black and white and a lot of symbols here. The yin and the yen, the flower, a lot of symbolism. Just interesting kind of mysterious work edition of ten.
00:53:06.168 - 00:53:25.304, Speaker A: Three tezos, one gone. And this was Clint Fulkerson. I can't remember who posted this, but it was cool. I think it was Kyle Flemmer who was talking about writing an essay on pixel art, which sounds awesome. PvP 2024. Just an interesting abstract artist here. Abstract pixel artwork.
00:53:25.304 - 00:53:51.976, Speaker A: So nice piece there. And here's macro. Mitrai bufo. So another interesting, interesting abstract pixel artwork. I think you could call that pixel artwork. Maybe it uses some ascii text. Interesting kind of diagonals here are interesting, I guess you'd say pixel marks, because, again, when you see these kind of diagonals like this, you do think of different, maybe like ASCII.
00:53:51.976 - 00:54:08.658, Speaker A: And I think actually macro matry has mentioned that. So that's an edition of ten for one tazos. And this was posted, I think, in the community. Great post. Who was it? Lucas legend posted this. This is a friend of Lucas's Simon Lazarus gallery. Data, which I hadn't heard of before.
00:54:08.658 - 00:54:34.194, Speaker A: Overload. So let's see if this plays. And so no volume here. So interesting contrast going on over here through this kind of very fuzzy airbrush. Just check the time here for the Twitter space. And the interesting kind of square pixels, right, that are flashing here. Kind of hard edge versus soft edge.
00:54:34.194 - 00:54:46.994, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Hey, so new kinds of abstraction here. We are discovering edition of five for 50 tezos. Two gone. Nice work. One transferred. Here's Braun screenbreaker zero six.
00:54:46.994 - 00:55:05.162, Speaker A: Edition of 15 for two tezos. So continuing the screenbreaker series. Again, more abstract pixel artwork. Again, static and dynamic pixels working together here. Interesting colors. And also the 1920 by 1080, interestingly. Here's Kota Nekazono.
00:55:05.162 - 00:55:30.168, Speaker A: CBZ number three. So continuing this interesting series here with this background that kind of phases in and out and then kind of curved over here. So a different kind of series here from Kota Nakazono. And the center here, just being static. It's kind of hypnotic, actually. It feels like this whole structure is moving, like a few pixels to the left or right. It's actually kind of dizzying to look at this.
00:55:30.168 - 00:55:44.552, Speaker A: Edition of ten for two tazos. Very interesting work. Here's. I think this is LB. If my computer could talk. So interesting. Minimal piece here with a cursor going in a spiral here on w 95.
00:55:44.552 - 00:55:58.746, Speaker A: Link ker. This is a free mint on Zora from LB. And continuing on, Daniel W. With a beautifully colored work here. Corporate bestiary. The janitor. And here you see a lightning bolt and a crown over top.
00:55:58.746 - 00:56:21.114, Speaker A: Look at the texture here. This is pretty amazing. The texture is off the charts, I guess it's this, you know, paper here, which I assume is digital paper. Pretty effective. Look at that. So nice move here. And there is the title and gorgeous color here from this really interesting corporate series, corporate bestiary series from Daniel W.
00:56:21.114 - 00:56:41.010, Speaker A: Fortezos. And that is an edition of 18. Here is Jake Studios. As we continue to run through this show, shift happens. And again, playing with this Internet iconography. Looks like a Jpeg logo, a phone, and then just looks like stream of consciousness drawing here. Again, surreal illustration.
00:56:41.010 - 00:56:59.848, Speaker A: Look at these clouds here. Not worrying about it, having to make sense. And that is a lot of the charm of it. Even the person here, looking like the subject here, is conforming to the canvas and interesting. Almost like keyboard letters here, just following kind of. Again, stream of consciousness here. This one was burned.
00:56:59.848 - 00:57:19.204, Speaker A: There may be a new one. This is an artist I hadn't seen before, Emir Gork. Unfinished work. Someone retweeted this. Let's see if it loads. So someone's sleeping here. And the figure in the art running and jumping.
00:57:19.204 - 00:57:39.362, Speaker A: This is the idea coming to you in the night and then realizing. And then kind of an unusual one, isn't it? Very interesting. Unfinished work haunting you. I. Yeah, I can relate to that one. Edition of five for five tezos. Here's Martin Joe.
00:57:39.362 - 00:58:01.066, Speaker A: I think we might have seen this earlier. It has been posted on Solana. Earthly pleasures, the endless waiting. So kind of an edgy work here from Martin Joe. And again, you see almost this Hans Bellmer influenced kind of body figure here. And this person that has a knife for a hand, like a pirate or something. And the cloud and everything.
00:58:01.066 - 00:58:19.894, Speaker A: Interesting brushwork there. Cool experimentation or cool drawing, I should say, from Martin Joe. The endless waiting. Half a sol auction is on. And continuing on, here's Kels. Kels. I didn't realize that Kells was posting work squire encounter artists at window.
00:58:19.894 - 00:58:43.436, Speaker A: So this is listed on object. And I've been. The reason I know is because Kells sent me one actually this morning and sent to Mikey Wilson. It does help. I'm not saying don't do it for me, and I don't show everybody's work, but it does help sending it to other people and to collectors to get your work out there. Some people don't like it, though. I can speak from my own experience.
00:58:43.436 - 00:59:03.286, Speaker A: I've sent out works and then someone puts it up for $0.10. So obviously not appreciating. So take that. So I don't really do it anymore. So, interestingly. But it is a way to get on the radar also for this show posted on the community. Anyways, let's look at what Kels is doing here because interestingly looks like digital painting.
00:59:03.286 - 00:59:30.914, Speaker A: And then you have the yellow border and some interesting mark making and nice kind of outline here that doesn't follow perfectly, which adds to the aesthetic appeal. So kind of an interesting work. And the color doesn't completely conform to the shape here, which looks like a figure that is sitting, crossing their legs. And here is the big head. Do we have a title? Squire encounters artist at window. So interesting piece here. Thank you for the send kills.
00:59:30.914 - 00:59:53.596, Speaker A: And here's another one from February, arrival at the green place. And so also interesting contrast on this one with these. Kind of like what we saw in that earlier piece with the fuzziness and the square pixel. We get that same contrast here. Interesting effect. So cool kind of digital painting, drawing. And there the squares are large.
00:59:53.596 - 01:00:17.362, Speaker A: And again, what is arrival at the green place? So enigmatic title here from Kells. And that is one tezos. And there are two left. So very cool. Renki ki ishigi. A couple of more from Renki here who we've been following for over a year here. You know, there are artists like Ed Morolla Santiago who've been on this show like a million times.
01:00:17.362 - 01:00:35.244, Speaker A: Renki is one of those artists. Just keeps delivering interesting information here. Interesting visual information. So it continues here with Renki. Edition of one doesn't usually just puts them on the market, doesn't waits for offers. Basically. Koshiyama is another one.
01:00:35.244 - 01:00:52.520, Speaker A: Remember the one that august ground picked up of the. It's just like a strobe. Almost a flashing strobe. It was a brilliant work. I almost started with that work. Anyway, cool work by Renki. This is Morgan Higbee flowers.
01:00:52.520 - 01:01:15.034, Speaker A: And there is the title. I think this was posted actually in the community. So interesting work. And here we're on Teia here. So kind of a wild work here where you almost have analog video and then you have some illustration. Look at this. So pretty wild work, isn't it? Wild video.
01:01:15.034 - 01:01:28.804, Speaker A: So thank you for posting that. Only half a tezos 97 left. So photo sensitive indeed. Let's continue. This is also risotto. We won't leave this on too long. Someone retweeted this.
01:01:28.804 - 01:01:45.420, Speaker A: Kind of looked interesting. I think oxyn might have retweeted that. Makinas qui que contempla. So a new one by Helios Santos. Remember we saw the birds in red or planes. And then here cloud detected. So kind of a different work.
01:01:45.420 - 01:02:03.714, Speaker A: Kind of has a bit of an AI feel to it. And of course, having that surveillance camera AI surveillance tool feel to it too. Interesting work. Edition of 30 for ten tazos and already several selling. So nice work there. Kurt Hussle collective has a new work. This is the place.
01:02:03.714 - 01:02:42.524, Speaker A: And this is very rich. Audio as ever. Kind of soothing. Almost a Brian eno feel to that. Very rich, very nice. I thought the start. I thought I remembered a different part of this.
01:02:42.524 - 01:02:50.584, Speaker A: We don't have a ton of time. We have passed the hour mark. Okay. Anyway, check it out. Kurt Hussle collective. There it is. The start.
01:02:50.584 - 01:03:00.788, Speaker A: Yes. So all very interesting as usual. Skye, goodman and score working together here. Collaborating. Speculative portrait. Number one. Daydream in the fifth dimension.
01:03:00.788 - 01:03:20.320, Speaker A: Pretty cool work. Let me get this going here. And no volume on here. And so we see all the sparklingness and almost kind of cool, like scan going across this bust here. Speculative portrait. Cool title. And interesting colors.
01:03:20.320 - 01:03:38.124, Speaker A: Cool colors here. And everything that is 32nd loop. And this is an edition of twelve and several selling here so far. There's Robnis V two putting an offer in. So that is pretty cool. So taking offers, phosphor operator, Stargazer. And this was also posted out.
01:03:38.124 - 01:03:55.700, Speaker A: Cool work. A different take on the video. Glitch. Kind of a feels like more of a close up. And there we see eyes. It's amazing how just doing something as simple as zooming in or getting closer can change a work. Especially if you're doing like screen capture type work, which I suspect this is.
01:03:55.700 - 01:04:10.484, Speaker A: I'm not positive. Again, phosphor operator, harm. 50 tezos edition of one. This is let's glitch at Circuitbet Media. So whoever mints the most editions of this piece is entitled to a camera. So there are 55 minted so far. This is on Zora.
01:04:10.484 - 01:04:24.596, Speaker A: So free mint. So if you are the person that mints the most, you get a free camera. As far as I understand from Donnia. Let's glitch it ETH. Pretty cool. And here are examples of the camera in action. And you also get the artwork.
01:04:24.596 - 01:04:54.552, Speaker A: Psycho futurist centaurs have two rib cages so they can dance twice as hard as. So another interesting work. Kind of fusing mythology and music here. You know who I think of when I see the constellation there? I also think this could hang in the same room as Marcel Pinel. Marcelo Pinel Pinello, the great psychedelic artist there. Interesting. So edition of ten for 20 tezos.
01:04:54.552 - 01:05:09.938, Speaker A: Nice work. Salawaki. A very questionable acquisition. So again, playing with the trout. Putting a hat on the trout. Trout with hat, 100% fish. So the memory continues here.
01:05:09.938 - 01:05:22.472, Speaker A: And Sabato picking one up there. And so selling out at five tezos edition of 20. Nice work, Martin Joe. Stir my heart. This one I had missed. I went to Martin Joe's page. This was done for Valentine's Day.
01:05:22.472 - 01:05:46.504, Speaker A: We could have even started with this on Valentine's day. So a GLB by Martin Joe, you know, with the lover being kind of filled with arrows here. Stir my heart. So, yeah, next Valentine's day, I'll have to look at what Martin Joe is doing. Kind of your classic Valentine's day artist. You could argue daydream, disconnection. This is by Tuks.
01:05:46.504 - 01:06:13.102, Speaker A: So I think we saw this on X, but again, here it is on Solana on exchange art, or at least works similar. Nice brushwork here. So of course, Tewks, who we're seeing from earlier in the show, you know, continues to experiment. Highest bid, two and a half sol. That's $429. So tooks continuing to kill it. Here's another work posted on X.
01:06:13.102 - 01:06:29.126, Speaker A: Are you still into art? Because I'm still into art. Look at this. 51 retweets, 445 likes there. Nice work, Tuks. Nice AI painting. Just an awesome artist. This work is older from Okote, but I hadn't seen it before it was posted online.
01:06:29.126 - 01:07:12.094, Speaker A: And this is at a reserve of 0.05. And interestingly, before we go into it, AI text to image tools. So this looks like, I assume it's raw AI, but not positive. And the title is interesting too. Digital connections. So kind of a homage to Diego Rivera, the mural painter, I think out of Mexico, if I'm not mistaken, the great mural painter, and I think Frida Kahlo's husband, I think for a while, or at least boyfriend, not exactly sure. Anyways, an interesting take on Diego Rivera's work here with a modern version with people looking at their tablets and phones, I thought, quite beautifully painted, by the way.
01:07:12.094 - 01:07:47.812, Speaker A: You know, I don't. So I wasn't sure if this is pure raw AI because you could also take this and paint yourself over top of it, but you probably don't need to because that does look like a beautiful canvas. Once again, here's no hygiene freement on our Zora. Interesting dimensions here, isn't it? So again, you think of just great experimentation here, loving the huge margin and just trying different things out. Loving the dimensions. Kind of looks like a 16 by nine. Almost made for a tv, perhaps made to be displayed.
01:07:47.812 - 01:08:00.828, Speaker A: Digital painting and AI. So combining some painting in there too, by no hygiene. This is on Zora three, minted. And here's also sky Goodman, who, of course, I follow. That is a glitch on x. I love my machine. I hate my machine.
01:08:00.828 - 01:08:21.274, Speaker A: Just a cool AI artwork here. Nice kind of contrast of the black and white kind of colors, gray colors with the color in the pants and maybe the backpack there. Here is, as we wrap up here. Here is triple zero nine. This is on verse, so triple zero nine. I think this is triple zero nine. It is.
01:08:21.274 - 01:08:39.385, Speaker A: No, sorry. This is. We have zero zero nine coming up. This is Margaret Murphy, who I've never seen before. This is on verse two, Los Angeles. So a lot of AI art here on verse. So interesting artist here.
01:08:39.385 - 01:08:58.985, Speaker A: So again, using AI, I think, to kind of rethink of Los Angeles. There's a Hollywood sign here is a baseball game. Life in LA. This one was pretty awesome, as we see here. And then we'll keep moving here to keep this short. Look at these planes. So very cool.
01:08:58.985 - 01:09:15.984, Speaker A: Yeah, I've been to LA only once, actually. It looks like LA to me. There's nothing like getting off the airport. First time in LA, you go, oh, this is LA. Anyways, let's continue. Here's zero zero nine on verse two, urban artifact. And I brought up a few of them.
01:09:15.984 - 01:09:37.767, Speaker A: So here we've been looking at a lot of these works actually the last couple of months. So now they're on verse. So nice work there. People in the subway, not exactly sure what's going on here. People kind of in mid air. And here, never saw this one. So interesting work by zero zero nine on verse.
01:09:37.767 - 01:09:54.847, Speaker A: So nice work there. $950 or 0.28 ETH. So cool work. And here's Danielle King, who, of course, I follow arrows. C'est la vie. Interesting wedding work here.
01:09:54.847 - 01:10:17.191, Speaker A: Beautiful photo. And again, looks like an AI artwork. It's starting to get almost. The only reason you don't think it's a photo is because it's so perfectly kind of artified in the ceiling here. Everything's almost perfectly, a little too perfect, interestingly. And so then you go, oh, that's probably AI. Otherwise it's starting to get pretty darn convincing.
01:10:17.191 - 01:10:33.454, Speaker A: Let's continue here. This is score with what looks like, almost like another wedding theme. This is AI. And look at the background here of these figures. These AI figures. Quite a beautiful, beautifully textured work by score. Sorry.
01:10:33.454 - 01:10:49.538, Speaker A: By Skomra. By Skomra. As we continue to run through here, here's Juana Pedro Zodiac. Wars is my first AI collection. The sun Zora, again, kinda would hang well with no hygiene. Very experimental AI artwork here. It's very interesting as we move into the physicals.
01:10:49.538 - 01:11:09.002, Speaker A: Ricardo Passaporte. Cool work here from. It's not a gallery again, Ricardo Passaporte via Stefan Simkovic. Interestingly so, it's not a gallery. We keep coming back to them. We really keep coming back to them. Over here, here's pipee universal, done by machine.
01:11:09.002 - 01:11:33.950, Speaker A: So a cool, I guess, maybe not a collab, but just a portrait here. And so there is PP with all of the tattoos and everything. Beautifully done here by machine. And interesting white background. So aphysical and so very cool there. And here's Ray Klein, quadruple dog. Interesting piece here, too, as you see here.
01:11:33.950 - 01:11:57.542, Speaker A: Physical artwork, tiny. Looks like a very small artwork. So just interesting. Ray Klein, quadruple dog, more mysterious artwork. Here's Bondozo Bandido, who we've looked at a ton here, experimenting here. We see some abstraction on top, abstraction on the right, and then the figure, this kind of cartoon airbrush figure on the left. For those who are about to paint.
01:11:57.542 - 01:12:12.676, Speaker A: We salute you. Indeed. It seems to be always painting moto 583, who we've looked at a ton, too. Super interesting artist here. And here we see burgers and cat and dogs and everything. Just more mysterious from that. Awesome artist.
01:12:12.676 - 01:12:47.432, Speaker A: And here's Donnie O'Donnell, mother and daughter, nan and Goose from Glendale, California. So maybe a commission, who knows? But we've seen this artist. Nice border there, too. Just a beautiful painting from that very interesting artist here is Zozo borders. So this looks like a physical, doesn't it? So here we see what looks like a blue painting on kind of a interesting kind of wall background there. So interesting piece from Zozo. Interesting colors and shapes and everything.
01:12:47.432 - 01:13:06.488, Speaker A: It does look like a zozo. And here's one. Victoria Whitme on zora no copa no deber. And here, I think we looked at a work of theirs last time. So interesting. Just kind of loose painting here. And kind of enigmatic in a landscape, and different little landscapes in the square.
01:13:06.488 - 01:13:17.644, Speaker A: Just interesting piece. 17, minted. Not bad. And that is your show, my friends. Again, I may take off Friday just to make artwork. So let's see. And just to take a little break here.
01:13:17.644 - 01:13:24.104, Speaker A: It may be time. So thank you once again for joining me. Hopefully I see you in the space in a couple hours. Until next time, take care.
