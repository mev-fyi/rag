00:00:05.320 - 00:00:21.870, Speaker A: The hour is running late again, my friends. Welcome back. When I go to the gym in the morning, it sets everything back. But man, is it worth it going in the morning. Like, my perfect schedule would be wake up at five, make art, go to the gym. And then I begin. Anyway, welcome back, everybody.
00:00:21.870 - 00:01:08.110, Speaker A: Artist journal, May 4, 2023, broadcasting from inner space in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Where the bees, the wasps, are making getting making themselves comfortable on my balcony. I may have to have an intervention. I think there may be a nest here. Anyways, speaking of biology, Santiago here has this awesome series that he that he collaborated with. It's an AI generative art series, from my understanding, and he collaborated with a pretty interesting outfit called emergent properties, which is kind of a philosophical, maybe a scientific term as well.
00:01:08.110 - 00:01:57.086, Speaker A: Of course. You know, I think the classic example of an emergent property, an important concept, is human consciousness, right? One could argue, and this is actually all debatable, but just to give you a sense of what an emergent property is, it's exactly how it sounds, an emergent property. So all the matter of the brain, our bodies put everything together, and some would argue not all that that creates, that the brain and its hardware enable consciousness to exist. That's kind of the common sense view. The Platonists actually have an inverted view, a lot of them, the neoplatonists. It's not soul in body, it's body in soul. So let's not go too far with that.
00:01:57.086 - 00:02:46.744, Speaker A: We should return to that very interesting topic. Anyways, before we get totally sidetracked here, here's just an example of one of these works, and they actually have a pretty nice website, and we're improps AI. Right. I almost think I need like, you know, I think maybe I need pokebelly AI. I should probably register that now before the show gets uploaded. Anyways, what does it mean to have a body number 73? And it looks like here as well, there is chat GPT Space army taking a rest in the river of giant amoeba, which sounds like William Burroughs here. I did an interesting experiment yesterday with mixed results where I employed the cut up method, Burroughs and Geysens cut up method.
00:02:46.744 - 00:03:27.822, Speaker A: I went into chat GPT four and said, and then took a CNBC article and said, apply Burroughs and Geysens cut up method to see to this article or this text. And it did. And I don't know how they do that because Burroughs and Geisen folded paper of a news article and then cut them up and then rearrange them. So I don't know how they're, how chat GPT is, you know, doing, doing that. Anyways, lots of sidetracks today. So look at this website, though, and look at how good the series looks. So again, Santiago Marquez, what does it mean to have a body connect to your tez wallet? 84 have been generated.
00:03:27.822 - 00:03:48.834, Speaker A: I believe the cost is 35 tezos. So a nice haul so far. And it looks like they have other projects that they've done. So kind of edgy, you know, Annika Meyer here and so kind of an edgy, you know, outfit. I've never heard of them. So kind of making a splash here with Santiago. Here's a few more.
00:03:48.834 - 00:05:00.444, Speaker A: Just examples, quickly. So clearly, AI and what I really like about this, again, when I was, I mean, one of the first things I experimented with in mid journey with the imagine prompt was Grey's anatomy, which is a very famous anatomy textbook, because all of a sudden, just like you see here, and it's really nicely done here, you get all these hypothetical body biological situations, these fictional bodies, because of course, I mean, the, the big ha ha here is, this is all fictional. This is the AI that's kind of making these, you know, speculative bodies, which is pretty cool, right? I mean, the body is a very important subject. It's one of the main subjects you could argue in the arts is the body. It is profoundly important from the political, economic side of things all the way down to the physicality and aesthetics and everything. You know, the body is a profound subject. So again, not to get sidetracked, but cool subject matter.
00:05:00.444 - 00:05:22.008, Speaker A: Okay. Very cool conceptual foundation for this generated AI art project. And you see here. Okay, so I was going to say so, okay, no, this is just the royalties. So only getting a 15% royalty. But I guess that's on the resale anyways, not on the primary. So anyways, just a cool project.
00:05:22.008 - 00:06:23.738, Speaker A: I quite like this one. And so this is on object as well as you can see here. And here is another one. And so all sorts of interesting, you know, an interesting collaboration. And, you know, it does make you wonder, like, I was on an art matter, spaces just listening in yesterday, and like we've been looking at the pen plotters. And one of the big developments, if you watch courses on 20th century science like I do in my spare time, like I used to, one of the big developments in the sciences in the 20th century was it went from the lone scientist in their, you know, labor in their home laboratory, sort of like right here doing experiments to it became about teams, right? And now if someone's doing, you know, experiments with a large Hadron Collider, and they find, you know, the God, the boson particle or the God particle or whatever. There's literally 400 people on that paper that gets published.
00:06:23.738 - 00:07:55.968, Speaker A: Like 400 people have contributed to that discovery. And what I ask myself as I see this interesting collaboration, say, with emergent properties in San Diego, as I listen to the art matter and all these tech guys who are working at MIT and wherever else, and again, art matter are the pen plotter people. The brilliant pen plotter people are the arts. I say visual art specifically, for example, as technology gets more and more developed, is it going to start becoming a more collaborative enterprise? We've already seen it in a very rudimentary form with these collaborations that we often see in digital art just on object, in a very simple way. I give you a piece, you do your thing, we'll see go Golitis and native ed today. Right? So, but is this about to get intensified in a similar manner to what we saw 100 years ago in science? So your provocative question for the day here, that Santiago is triggering with this awesome again, and I just love this kind of cut up, you know, title that we were seeing here in parenthesis, latter on the inside of a logical fallacy, which. So it's a kind of a beautiful surrealist project, isn't it? So anyways, look at this one.
00:07:55.968 - 00:08:40.352, Speaker A: All sorts of interesting imagery, you know, scientific imagery, which is very interesting, and a whole kind of, you know, the. We talk about the vocabulary of the present. Well, you know, in the 20th century, you could argue definitely science was one of the main kind of issues. You know, that's why science fiction, as Ballard put it, was kind of a literature of the present. I think he called it the authentic literature of the 20th century. I kind of see technology as one of the big, in a sense, what used to be science, I almost want to call technology now because it's moving so exponentially fast that it's almost more the theme. It's not so much.
00:08:40.352 - 00:09:10.576, Speaker A: I mean, science is inherent in technology, but it's more technology. And I'd argue the other main theme of the century, not to be overstating things, is finance. Finance and technology. Anyways, we're totally going all over the place here. That's a good thing about going to the gym, is it kind of sets off, you know, half the reason you should go to, you know, do exercises for your brain. It's great for the brain. So anyways, let's run through this here.
00:09:10.576 - 00:09:54.820, Speaker A: Below is an interview between emergent properties and Santiago, who goes underneath, is conducted in the past few days, which we're putting the finishing touches on, on his magical long form AI project. Interesting language. What does it mean to have a body who's ready for an epic thread? And so they've done a really nice job of showcasing this with all these posters and everything. They do an interview, so we can't read all this, but pretty rad, you know, to quote, to use a hasdrubal waffle term, pretty rad. So really cool. So you can read the interview at emergent properties Twitter thread. And here is just another example that minted by icaro.
00:09:54.820 - 00:10:27.074, Speaker A: So anyways, and look at this poster. I mean, this looks like you could put this on a street post in Berlin where they put all the art shows. And I think people would go, don't you think? I mean, look at this work. This is like, wow, I think you'd like. So there's something here, isn't there? 500 editions at 35 tezos. So they are minting right now and they are still available. Thank you again to everybody who showed up yesterday to the Twitter spaces.
00:10:27.074 - 00:10:55.866, Speaker A: I mean, it's not uncommon to have this number, say, 174 a day later. But what was so amazing about this was we got like 142 people that actually showed up live at what, you know, throughout the, you know, space. It went. I let, usually it's an hour to hour and a half. I let it go along here at an hour. 42 people really like this topic. And how have NFTs changed your art? So anyways, that was super cool.
00:10:55.866 - 00:11:24.262, Speaker A: And, you know, who was it here? Horror mocks put this. Oh, maybe can I find it again? Maybe I won't be able to find that again. But, you know, here is the. Let me see. It's a good thing to get your, let me just get this because it was really cool. Let me try and do that. Here it is.
00:11:24.262 - 00:11:59.938, Speaker A: So anyways, it was a great group of people. There was Santiago Edmarola showed up, waking up early, you know, Doctor version, Martin, Joe Kant, the Wolf of Wall Street, Shash, who's like an old school crypto guy, tuks, Rosaceo, Sabato, Haiti, Klaus Kableen from object. So that is just rad. So what, you know, great. And of course runetoon and everybody here, Kane was hilarious. I'd never met Kane before. So anyways, really cool and sorry, all over the place here.
00:11:59.938 - 00:12:18.564, Speaker A: We will persist here. And hilariously, Horamox made even a workout of it. So we had a great time here. So anyways, that was awesome. So, you know, back to the technology mid journey. 5.1 is out.
00:12:18.564 - 00:12:47.594, Speaker A: And as Barsi, a popular AI account, is saying, it's incredible. Text to image is reaching near photorealistic in 2023. Here are seven realistic images. So I'm just going to show this one. But kind of like the creepiness of this. I mean, this is purely a digitally created person, which is kind of mind bending because it kind of has all the properties of a real person. So that is a little freaky.
00:12:47.594 - 00:13:09.970, Speaker A: I think we have another example here. When I heard v version 5.1 was out, the photographer and me kicked in immediately, did a quick first test in raw mode. Looking pretty nice, I think. So again, these are digital people. So that is pretty wild. And, you know, it got me thinking as well.
00:13:09.970 - 00:13:41.996, Speaker A: Like, I mean, one of the cool things about this account here is it puts the prompt. But I was thinking about this and I was like, it's kind of like programming, but it's not like a programming language. It's language programming is what we seem to have here. Aerial view of a sports car. It's kind of like, it's kind of using programmer logic, but it's using language rather than, you know, JavaScript, for example, code. So that. Yeah, so it's just kind of a.
00:13:41.996 - 00:14:31.984, Speaker A: It's like a reverse programming. It's not a programming language, it's language programming. And so anyways, the results are pretty amazing. Again, like, and these are just digital constructions, which brings me to a very important subject. I mean, we were discussing earlier on fiction and nonfiction, remember how the brain, the unconscious, doesn't necessarily distinguish between fact and fiction. So here we are in a world that's increasingly a fiction that we are surrounded with. So I thought this was a nice time to look at a couple of paragraphs at JG Ballard's introduction to crash, the 1995 kind of shorter version, because it completely, I think, addresses or relates to what we're seeing here in AI.
00:14:31.984 - 00:15:28.136, Speaker A: And he's talking about the role of the writer and fiction and nonfiction, of course. JG Ballard is a surrealist, and in his surrealist novel Crash, I feel that the balance between fiction and reality has changed significantly in the past decades. Increasingly, their roles are reversed. We live in a world ruled by fictions of every kind, mass merchandising, advertising, politics conducted as a branch of advertising, the preempting of any original response to experience by the television screen. So, remember we were discussing, you know, how watching tv and you're watching the news, and let's say for Ballard, it was the tragedies in Vietnam. And then the next thing, you're seeing a soft drink commercial, you know, the preempting. So all of a sudden, your emotional, imaginative response is kind of co opted by the commercial.
00:15:28.136 - 00:15:50.974, Speaker A: And again, what does that do to our unconscious? The unconscious. It kills what Ballard argues is the death of effect. It kills our emotional response. We live inside an enormous novel. It is now less and less. It is now less and less necessary for the writer to invent the fictional content of his novel or her novel. The fiction is already there.
00:15:50.974 - 00:16:36.618, Speaker A: The writer's task is to invent the reality. Right? So trying to figure out what's going on. Okay. And then finally, in the past, we always assumed that the external world around us has represented reality, however confusing or uncertain, and that the inner world of our minds, its dreams, hopes, ambitions, represented the realm of fantasy and the imagination. These roles, it seems to me, have been reversed. The most prudent and effective method of dealing with the world around us is to assume that it is a complete fiction. Conversely, the one small node of reality left to us is inside our own heads.
00:16:36.618 - 00:17:22.524, Speaker A: Freud's classic distinction between the latent and the manifest content of the dream, between the apparent and the real, now needs to be applied to the external world of so called reality, which. This is an incredibly important phrase which will unpack at a future time. But this is ultimately Ballard's take on Dali, on what Dali did. He externalized Freud. Okay, so which is a kind of pretty interesting interpretation. Anyways, I thought this related very much, as we're starting to be surrounded by fictions of every kind, as Ballard would put it. You know, I think it's worth just kind of slowing down and kind of taking stock of what that might mean.
00:17:22.524 - 00:17:35.840, Speaker A: So more technology here. Here we have. So we've been looking at the pen plotters. We've been looking at art matter. Check this out. Charcoal. Now using charcoal.
00:17:35.840 - 00:18:11.004, Speaker A: So that, I think we saw this the other day, but I didn't really understand what all this stuff was, and they were vacuuming it up. So now they have charcoal. So this is just getting incredibly interesting, isn't it? So that is cool. And then Andrew Strauss out of studio Strauss two years ago. Just check this out. So I assume this is some kind of marker of some kind. And you can see, you know, where it starts and then where it kind of overlaps.
00:18:11.004 - 00:18:31.160, Speaker A: I mean, it's beautiful. You know, it reminds you of those. I think it's Dimitri Cherniak works. So anyways, I mean, just, you see the power of the plotter here. Just incredible. And continuing on. So also physical work here.
00:18:31.160 - 00:18:49.302, Speaker A: Evelyn o. This was super interesting. So the artist's right hand, very cool. Focus on the AI distortion of the hand. So again, we're back to the body a little bit. And how AI is distorting the body. It becomes a very just clear view of what AI is doing and where it kind of misses the mark.
00:18:49.302 - 00:19:03.478, Speaker A: But that becomes what we celebrate. The artist's right hand. Sold on object.com in October 2022 for 80 tezos. Sold on secondary for 880 tezos to traders insight. And they also want a physical. So there it is, signed, a one of one.
00:19:03.478 - 00:19:38.190, Speaker A: So just super cool and nicely presented, beautifully printed. So just kind of cool to see more physical versions. And Ozborn, who we've seen many of these, like the Polaroid and a few different works. Now, Osborne has been embedding manifold auctions on Osborn's website. So here's how you do it. No coding required. And basically you just create an embed on your website that you might have and you type should be iframe.
00:19:38.190 - 00:19:59.478, Speaker A: Then paste the URL of your manifold gallery. So basically you can embed manifold into your website. Okay. And remember, that's the artist who did this. And here it is, I think, on their website. So that's pretty interesting, isn't it? I mean, it's hard to get people to your website these days, but maybe this is a way of getting people to your website. You know, everything's kind of gone.
00:19:59.478 - 00:20:28.020, Speaker A: Socials websites are almost like, you know, old fashioned, right? Everything's social and podcasts and whatever, right? How often do you type in websites to go to? You know, I have like my two news websites I go to. Anyways, running through this episode here, Andre, just some cool sketches. Sketch versus finished. So GM from Andre. Shout out to Andre. Look at how. So this is pretty cool.
00:20:28.020 - 00:20:54.246, Speaker A: Kind of reminds me of rare. How rare will kind of block things out a little bit. And Andre taking a similar tact with very different results, you know, more illustrative than oil painting, but kind of a similar way of working here. So anyways, just really cool to see that. And uxing with some cool variations on his profile picture. And we've seen a few. This is a pretty cool one.
00:20:54.246 - 00:21:25.674, Speaker A: And just making it look so easy. I really love how Xene is taking the apps and the software and just running away with it and just endless permutations. I mean, it's almost become a trademark for Euxine just to do endless permutations. Mix them all together. Even this one. I mean, pretty experimental and interesting look, like JPEG artifacts version, right? JPeg, yeah, exactly. Also from a collaboration with Gengoya Club.
00:21:25.674 - 00:21:50.174, Speaker A: Excited to tease the newest collab with one and only Axeen. So first there was this and a pretty nice ad, by the way, newsworthy obstacles. And here is the work. So this is going for 80 tezos now, I assume that is on secondary and. Yeah, so you see here, just looking great as usual. And this great noise. Interesting move here.
00:21:50.174 - 00:22:11.468, Speaker A: You see how the O and the O. And so it's, like, almost been kind of pushed to the side. You see the s here a little bit pushed to the side. So anyways, it kind of looks like AScii. Again, using every trick in the book. I like this lone pixel here. And you see how these are kind of also about the same width away from each other.
00:22:11.468 - 00:22:36.294, Speaker A: So you can almost see the layers here, right. It's been kind of moved about that much over. So anyways, kind of a window into oxygen's process here and some nice noise along the side. So anyway, cool work. Let's just see what this went for on primary. So about 44 to 55 on primary. And that was today.
00:22:36.294 - 00:22:55.620, Speaker A: So this morning. Okay, awesome. Super cool work by the myth. Lucky strike. Really just original piece here. Looking like some sort of, you know, meat pie or, you know, something like that. Maybe a rhubarb pie with a face in the pie.
00:22:55.620 - 00:23:27.644, Speaker A: And really just, I mean, the mists poetry here shows up again. And just some pills, some, you know, cigarettes, some lighters. The lucky strike, you know, cutting the pie, the gun, even the clouds and the lemonhead guy, a little bit of blood. And of course, the charger cable. And there's, you know, abbey road by the beatles. And then the myth underneath. Beautiful work, right? Like, I mean, poetic.
00:23:27.644 - 00:23:43.198, Speaker A: Very nice. I brought it up large, too, just so we could see. So this looks like a procreate work. You see the texture and everything. This doesn't look like Microsoft paint. So really beautiful work here. And the cigarettes are quite beautifully done.
00:23:43.198 - 00:24:03.158, Speaker A: This really nice texture underneath. Again, it's tempting to see. You see this texture all over. It's tempting to see virtual paper here. Gloomtube also likes to use this virtual paper, I think. So anyways, so it seems really beautiful work here. And a stunner by Morlakos as well.
00:24:03.158 - 00:24:25.540, Speaker A: Cyberman's Bay. So kind of a cool figure again that those freaky yellow and red and black eyes kind of has a bit of a Magritte feel to it. Almost like a homage to the myth, somewhat in the background. In the sky. But I brought this up large too. Again, square brush. Right? Kind of feels like maybe a Microsoft paintwork.
00:24:25.540 - 00:24:54.208, Speaker A: What's so interesting again, I'm kind of back to Rada. This thing could be made as large as you want. As long as it's square, there's no reason you can't make this bigger. So you see all the detail work that Morlakos puts into his really interesting style. I mean, it almost has a bit of a Georges Seurat like, pointilist kind of style. Not exactly, but just a little bit. You know, when he starts layering, you see the yellow.
00:24:54.208 - 00:25:21.898, Speaker A: It's got a bit of a, you know, impressionist thing going on here, but super digital and completely original. So gotta feel. Look at this. You know, very interesting. Right? Like this light green kind of dot, kind of mark that's kind of, you know, put around. And then more of a pattern on top with the darker green creating a kind of contrast and kind of a more solid pattern with a bit more randomness underneath. Like, pretty interesting.
00:25:21.898 - 00:25:39.834, Speaker A: You see it? You see a lot of labor here in this beautiful castle. And the overall composition and mysterious figure here. So super cool. I was glad I put in an offer for that, and I was glad it got accepted. Only five. Wow. So then burned a whole bunch.
00:25:39.834 - 00:25:58.566, Speaker A: So you got to stay on top of morlacos, his Twitter feed, because. Yeah, I didn't realize what was going on. And then I went to the Twitter feed and I was like, okay, put an offer in anyways. What a piece. Only an edition of five. That's awesome. Behind the digital forest by rosatio.
00:25:58.566 - 00:26:19.594, Speaker A: This is an edition of 20. And just another beautiful piece by Rosatio with a lot of the classic sort of iconography that we're used to. Look at this skull, too. I mean, it looks almost pretty distorted here. So just an interesting work. Again, collage. And I think some procreate collage, digital painting.
00:26:19.594 - 00:26:41.270, Speaker A: And let's just see. Sold out on primary at nine tezos, each to a lot of familiar names here. And that is an addition of 20. So pretty nice. And another one by Luciana. False reality. I mean, this abstract artist here is kind of making some pretty impressive work.
00:26:41.270 - 00:27:08.592, Speaker A: I don't think I've seen this one. This is going somewhere, as I like to say, this is going somewhere. So anyways, maybe she had a fabulous April. Looks like a pretty good start to May. Beautiful piece. You know, as we always say, like, so we discussed on the spaces. Sometimes a little bit of success can really turbocharge your artistic sort of, you know, ambition, you know, and really just push yourself to make great work.
00:27:08.592 - 00:27:33.708, Speaker A: Here's Rinnefish with a new one. So more just kind of. I don't even know what to call it. I mean, it looks like bunnies and just more kind of surrealist, alienesque, kind of embryonic work here. I mean, how do you put words on this? With some. With some cool. With some cool audio.
00:27:33.708 - 00:27:51.234, Speaker A: So, anyways, that is cool. And I think this is part my new art. Moonlit metamorphosis. Birth for artfest spring 2023 for world of women. NFT. So the bug dance under the full moon. Tears flow freely, so joy born from sadness is at home on the night realm planet.
00:27:51.234 - 00:28:04.482, Speaker A: So anyways, really cool. And here was another one. We've looked at this artist several months ago. Cwampa. Simple thoughts. Ms Paint 2023. I really like this work.
00:28:04.482 - 00:28:28.804, Speaker A: I mean, there's something kind of just unapologetic about it. And the more you see, the more you're convinced. And nice, a nice size there, too. 3600 by 1180. And I always like how I've seen them before, where they've put in the Mspaint user interface. I'm not sure if that's part of the work. So this is the work by itself.
00:28:28.804 - 00:28:47.590, Speaker A: Also interesting. So anyways, all very interesting from Cwampa. Y'all don't understand how much I love these. Yeah, they're pretty interesting. And some pretty interesting work also from Dan control. So a lot of familiar faces here. But again, this is the last couple of days of what's going on here.
00:28:47.590 - 00:29:06.944, Speaker A: So Astro boy and Mickey Mouse kind of conflated together, working with fake whale. So there's Astro boy and there's Mickey Mouse. Just kind of mixed together. So interesting work from dan control, as usual. Addition of eight for 45 tezos. So let's just see what happened on primary. It sold for 15 tezos each.
00:29:06.944 - 00:29:23.204, Speaker A: And let's just see. And, yeah, so there you go. Pretty low edition. Another really cool work, this time using shoes. Basic enemies from Dan control. Reserve of 0.15. So now doing the shoe treatment.
00:29:23.204 - 00:29:36.582, Speaker A: So very cool. Some bands and some nikes with his gradients that he was working on underneath, all black and white. Pretty nice piece. So very cool. And Dan w. Daniel w. Form and void.
00:29:36.582 - 00:29:55.774, Speaker A: A couple of experiments here. Let me just hit play. And so just kind of interesting layering going on here and kind of color experiments. So this is called again, form and void. And then we have the crowned worm also coming out. This is an edition of one. Let's just see what happened here.
00:29:55.774 - 00:30:13.394, Speaker A: Sold for 70 tezos, which is nice. So anyways, just interesting work here. Interesting layering, right? And color. Let's just see what happened on the market for this other one. It was listed sold. Yeah, for 70 tezos. There it goes.
00:30:13.394 - 00:30:27.780, Speaker A: To game one. Start. So very cool. And Flora Marquez continues with the collage. And this is May 2. French fries monster. Is it okay if I eat this? So continuing with the collage in real world photo collage.
00:30:27.780 - 00:30:44.548, Speaker A: So really experimenting here. A little bit of what looks like mayonnaise or something. And some mustard if I have my spanish. Right. So anyways, very cool. French fry head guy. A popular theme on the blockchain.
00:30:44.548 - 00:31:02.946, Speaker A: McDonald's. Flora Marquez. And this was interesting too. So a collaboration with sloths. So this was for sloth scenes anniversary and sloth scene, I don't know a ton about. I'm sure I was following them, but it's a monthly comic zine and they're on tazos. So anyways, a lot of artists work with them.
00:31:02.946 - 00:31:19.818, Speaker A: I think Kurt Hussle collective did something for them as well. So anyways, it's just cool to see. And here is their thing. And here is tornado calling. Flora Marquez. And anyways, just cool. And that looks like it's by tornado.
00:31:19.818 - 00:31:34.164, Speaker A: So anyways, just cool. And here's the link, actually, sloth number twelve. And here, let's just quickly go. I think these are PDF's. Yeah. For two tezos edition of 250. I'm going to hold off on this because it may crash my browser here.
00:31:34.164 - 00:32:15.926, Speaker A: But anyways, sloth number twelve is out. Ed Marolla, unicorn allare. So another just kind of stunning work that was put out here. A lot of dithering on this one across. And you see the unicorn kind of keeping with this kind of enigmatic, mythological kind of settings, whether it's hell or, you know, this unicorn going into some portal, the subject matter is really interesting and really fits with the style. And here you see another figure in the background and this beautiful kind of figure on a rock and the trees moving and this beautiful frame. It's gorgeous.
00:32:15.926 - 00:32:41.406, Speaker A: 15 edition of 15 and sold for five tezos on primary. Now it's 120 on secondary. And here was just a cool work by Anya Asano, I thought, just kind of interesting and original. Interesting combination of noise, pixelation, kind of glitch everything. And here's spagel's maskinen with a work. I'm a huge fan of palm trees. I think a lot of us are.
00:32:41.406 - 00:33:02.468, Speaker A: And so here's kind of like this digital grid with a palm tree inside. You know this three d, three deification. And there goes the sun. How rad is that? And it's all on a computer screen. I love it. So anyways, like how long? Yeah. Okay, so it's about maybe 15 seconds here.
00:33:02.468 - 00:33:17.794, Speaker A: Evaporate a one of one reserve 0.85 from Spuegel Smaskinen monitor. Sunset palm wireframes. So you gotta love it. All good things there. Plus, what's gamma with an interesting piece here, edition of ten. It's called break.
00:33:17.794 - 00:33:56.806, Speaker A: And so again, the body is subject matter, probably Francois Gamma's trademark sort of subject here. And here the body is breaking away into little pixels, dissolving into the ether, into the void. Right. So break in and here's feels. This was just posted on Twitter, so it could be older, but I don't remember seeing it. Just kind of another cool animated abstract pixel work and 87,000 views. And we're going to see another artist soon here who's gotten like a million views.
00:33:56.806 - 00:34:22.858, Speaker A: So stay tuned for that. Here's one green ginger. Another cool pixel artwork. It's called enigmatic elevator. So just kind of an interesting, you know, taking the elevator and then repeating it, turning it into just a whole piece. Kind of reminds me of dan control. And then here, the elevator, the red elevator kind of switches around here right as it comes down and then it comes up.
00:34:22.858 - 00:34:41.492, Speaker A: So the enigmatic elevator. Nice animation there. Green ginger edition of 15, available for six tezos. Looks like it sold out right away at two tezos each. So that is cool. Continuing on, mandal, magic of cat charm. Reserve price of two sol.
00:34:41.492 - 00:35:22.650, Speaker A: Is this a one of one? I think so. I think so. Anyways, cool work by manitoul on exchange art, which of course is Solana. So nice big chunky pixels. I mean, a nice contrast, right? Really big pixels here, contrasting with the smaller pixels here. I mean, it's not often you see that, is it? That you see a huge difference in the size of pixels in pixel art? Usually people will stick to their canvas size, right, which will give a uniform pixel size. And what's really interesting about this is it seems like we're almost getting a kind of layering of different canvases.
00:35:22.650 - 00:35:52.132, Speaker A: And then with pixels, pixel art, of course, you can stretch so you can make it work. It almost looks like two different, two or three different works kind of put together. So anyways, cool work from mandal and notorious man xtz with a cool work, space traveler. So just kind of fun. And some really cool user interfaces. Trademark horizontal composition and heading off almost into a Star wars lightspeed there. Space traveler.
00:35:52.132 - 00:36:35.088, Speaker A: Very cool down here, how the text is going up and down. Look at that. I mean, the screens are amazing here. Speaking of amazing, it was reminding me, I almost said, that reminds me of gogolitis, speaking of which. So here's gogolitis and native Ed. So another collaboration, a brilliant, again solution that, oh, this is awesome. As the figure runs through here, again, the brilliant solution of putting these windows for native Ed to do work in and then, so just a smart way of collaborating and creates a very interesting contrast because, you know, you get native Ed's kind of video esque works going through this kind of pixel artwork.
00:36:35.088 - 00:36:48.936, Speaker A: So very, you know, you see the city here and everything. So let's just see what happened here. So offers are coming in. You can still make an offer. I don't think there's a minimum. I don't think. But check Google liteus or native ads feed.
00:36:48.936 - 00:37:15.702, Speaker A: Pixel art journey just found this on Twitter and I thought it was just kind of a nice piece. While we're in the pixel art area, kind of a rainy day with some power, power cords or power lines outside and some fire inside. Just kind of a nice piece. And burr sector, game over. Pixel Stan Thomas. So I'm not sure, I guess this is a tribute to threesomes. Exactly.
00:37:15.702 - 00:37:42.744, Speaker A: And Stan Thomas and Jason were here, so, because again, threesomes uses a lot of trading cards and so. And burr sector likes to do these homages, which are totally awesome. Game over. The ultimate tribute. You did it. Game over. Datura and I saw this cabling actually put out a cool, like 30 work thread of what she saw on object.
00:37:42.744 - 00:38:01.864, Speaker A: So that was pretty cool. I saw this in her thread. I'm a big detour fan and had missed this. Storm 588. And so anyways, just cool work by detour as ever. And totally unique and instantly identifiable, isn't it? Nice black and white work. And again, storm always keeping it representational.
00:38:01.864 - 00:38:32.974, Speaker A: Interestingly, you know, so we were mentioning works. Look at this. That got a million views. So we've been looking at Polygon 1993 for a week now because I think it's the color among many, the texture, the subject matter, even this ext three over here, which actually really adds to the piece. It creates a little bit of a contrast there. And that beautiful color orange. And I mean, we've been talking about these colors, this kind of violet and neon orange and neon pink, that sort of thing.
00:38:32.974 - 00:39:02.710, Speaker A: Yeah. So a million views. Unless chainsaw man, a million views. And here's another one which looks like maybe Pokemon. 372,000 views. So this is pretty insane how well, so it just shows that when you're doing some sort, like when something hits, and this is kind of like, I'd call it kind of glitch, for lack of a better term. When it hits, it really hits.
00:39:02.710 - 00:39:21.834, Speaker A: So it's kind of the beauty of Twitter because I'm not sure that would happen on Instagram. Just because the reach tends to get strangled really quickly, things don't really go viral, I don't find on Instagram. So another reason to just enjoy being on Twitter. Here's one by libroblock. Shoutout to libro. Abstract. Zero, zero, seven.
00:39:21.834 - 00:39:43.340, Speaker A: And there is some music here, so I'm never sure if the music is copyright or not. So I just do little bits and pieces here. Anyways, cool work. Kind of looks like a lemon slice or something, but I think it's just abstraction. Very nice. And how did this do? 45. Well, I guess it just got sent out here, so might need to.
00:39:43.340 - 00:40:07.772, Speaker A: Let's just retweet that. So continuing on, rat lab feedback study. Another just cool piece I saw on Twitter here. So a lot of interesting kind of glitch video art coming out, isn't there? Feedback study number two. So you almost wonder if this is being fed into each other. This is available for a Tezos in an open edition. Only two have been minted, so maybe an opportunity there.
00:40:07.772 - 00:40:32.894, Speaker A: Xmortal with a really nice piece here. I think my favorite part is this kind of old VCR type user interface stuff where you see the time down here. It reminds me of Kurt, also collective obliquely. And I thought this was quite a nice piece. Just on a kind of abstract level. Just kind of enjoy this piece a lot. So you see all the gear that's being used here from exmortal edition of one.
00:40:32.894 - 00:41:01.484, Speaker A: And this sold for mere 15 tezos. So nice collect there. MCh X with a variation on the circle here that we're seeing. So these beautiful works buy now for five tezos, edition of 25. And again, just more kind of stunning color and everything. Just a beautiful, animated abstract work. And you see how it kind of follows the edge is following this circle in the middle here.
00:41:01.484 - 00:41:35.204, Speaker A: So anyways, beautiful color and everything. So very cool. From MCHX and Kota Nakazono. Filament number four. So another kind of beautiful abstract work from Kota Nakazono. And you gotta love all these little pixels in the background. Again, these colors, the colors are gorgeous, you know, almost similar to that one we saw with the million views there, you know, these kind of orange, red, kind of neon pink with these kind of violets and all that, like just really nice color here.
00:41:35.204 - 00:41:52.232, Speaker A: 2099 on secondary. Let's just see what happened on primary. Tentezos each. So yeah, there's gogolitis and Dina chang. So yeah, that was a popular one. Gorgeous. And skirbo with some more of these kind of interesting blown apart figures here.
00:41:52.232 - 00:42:10.048, Speaker A: Anti crash JPEG is the new collection I'm creating. I hope I can present the project all in one bang, all in one drop. I'm looking for curators. So there you have it. So just interesting series here by Skirbo. Another take on the body. And here is Mister shapeless, high hopes.
00:42:10.048 - 00:42:35.604, Speaker A: And this is only a reserve of 0.25. And you wonder if this is the impact of mid journey five or even 5.1, what we're seeing here, because it looks a lot more detailed than it used to be. So that is interesting. So keeping on pushing things, Mister shapeless and an interesting. I think this is AI work. Almost remind me of Knexpeta.
00:42:35.604 - 00:42:58.534, Speaker A: Here's Kenji Xop, full time self taught creator experiment. Experimenting digital art, AI. So I think this is an AI work. I thought it was just kind of an interesting kind of fuzzy work here. And we may. This is probably an older work by Joe Ao. And I'm following Joao Salazar, that is a bug in Twitter, GM fam.
00:42:58.534 - 00:43:28.134, Speaker A: And so anyways, I just thought, you know, I've probably seen this before, but it's worth reposting here. Really nice work here. I mean, just such an interesting use of plasticine. And finally, my friend Charlie Stein, I haven't seen her in a couple of years, but she had such a big. This is a huge thing. Kristen Hjelagerty, if I'm pronouncing that right, is a pretty popular contemporary art gallery. Kind of an up and comer in the last three years.
00:43:28.134 - 00:44:03.862, Speaker A: I'm from my perception, which just from, I'm not an expert in these things, but kind of an up and comer and my friend, you know, so I've mentioned many times that, like, how sad the Berlin art scene can be. But I wanted to show this because there are great, great stories too. I mean, this is a big deal. And so represented in London and Norway by Kristin Hjeligerty. So congratulations to Charlie Stein. I mean, that is a really, it's like a major career step, shall we say, or just a major move as an artist. It's a tough business.
00:44:03.862 - 00:44:19.354, Speaker A: She's been laboring for years and she's been slowly building and building, and this is, you might call it the big leagues. You can have galleries and stuff, but that is like big league galleries. So that is super impressive. Thank you once again for joining me. And until next time, take care.
