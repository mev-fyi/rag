00:00:02.880 - 00:00:37.524, Speaker A: We are late out of the starting gates here, ladies and gentlemen, and everyone, welcome back. It should be a really interesting, action packed show. Digital textures, pixelation, rj and more. Welcome back. Artist journal, June 15, 2023. Broadcasting from the ship on the high seas, the imagination in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, talk radio host, art commentator, artist most of all.
00:00:37.524 - 00:00:57.560, Speaker A: Here I am artist reporter. We haven't said that for a while. Welcome back, everybody. Can you guess who this is? Maybe you've seen it. If you haven't, you've probably seen the artist before on this show, if you are a watcher. It is Spuegelsmeskinen. It is Spuegelsmaskinen, who often does.
00:00:57.560 - 00:01:46.414, Speaker A: You know, I think my favorite series, just from a purely content perspective, was the abnormal. You know, the shopping mall. You know what I'm tempted to call, and I am not huge on these kind of words, but what I'm tempted to call the semiotics of the shopping mall with Spuegelsmeskinen. Well, he's back and he is doing this. And I thought this was super interesting. So kind of, you know, a lot of his work is kind of like these video animations of things kind of, you know, moving, you know, again, the abnormal, for example, was shopping carts moving on their own. And, you know, just everyday objects, whether it's radios, computers, and just kind of doing things.
00:01:46.414 - 00:02:23.804, Speaker A: Remember the email, the skeleton, the red and black skeletons with the email? So he does a lot of that. And what I found interesting, and he's worked with pixelation here before. And I almost. Maybe dithering is a better word for it. I mean, we could call it maybe pixelation is the, you know, enveloping word, and dithering is a kind of pixelation, perhaps. Anyway, what you see here is a spacework. So what looks like almost like an Apollo spacecraft at first, kind of landing on the moon, but then going through the moon.
00:02:23.804 - 00:03:09.874, Speaker A: The work is called hollow moon. Here you see it orbiting and then going inside. And what I thought about this, again, the inner artist here was wondering what I loved about this. I think most of all was this idea that you could take the dithering and you could just apply it to all of his work. And, I mean, a lot of his work already is dithered. You'll see, you know, dithering again, this kind of what, for lack of better term, this digital cross hatching that you see here on the moon and everything, how it gets these gradients and everything, you could apply that. This kind of like a black and white version, for example, you could remix every one of his works, you know, potentially, and you'd have a brand new work.
00:03:09.874 - 00:04:09.184, Speaker A: And I just think that's interesting. I think that's something, again, that is unique to digital. Now, I don't. I don't think he's ever done that, but that's what I kind of, you know, you find a new process, a new way of kind of presenting things, and it just kind of makes it interesting, doesn't it? Because they're probably beautiful. You know, if you took the shopping carts, for example, and then applied this black and white version, dithered version, then, you know, you arguably would probably have something pretty beautiful. So it just kind of raises almost questions about. Because there are so many ways of presenting works, where should one stop? And maybe so perhaps just philosophically, finally, before we move on here, perhaps a work has to have, as the French would say, a raison d'etre, a reason for being from a artistic aesthetic perspective, perhaps.
00:04:09.184 - 00:04:54.344, Speaker A: Otherwise, I mean, you can literally make 20 different versions using different digital processing of a lot of the artwork that you make, maybe more and probably like persuasive version. So it brings out one of my favorite topics here, which this isn't even a remix, but remixing and how that is kind of unique to digital art in a certain sort of way. Yes, you can kind of remix in physical art, but not really. I mean, I guess you can print out someone else's, you know, you can print out a manet on canvas with inkjet and then you can start to play with that. But it's not quite the same as putting on a filter. Right. So all very interesting.
00:04:54.344 - 00:05:24.152, Speaker A: This, speaking of interesting, and I need to actually bring up, again, I am running late. This. I need to bring up unknown collector left a really nice comment, made a tweet, actually, about this space here. And I was so thrilled with how this space went with RJ. I'm so glad he came on and he was incredibly interesting. I cannot recommend this show here enough. And I think both me and Roentoon were on inform, too.
00:05:24.152 - 00:05:57.746, Speaker A: So I think it was just a. Turned into a great show. I got a couple of comments actually and everything. So, yeah, this is well worth the listen, not just for entertainment, but from a kind of philosophical, artistic perspective. As I was saying to RJ at the end, you know, I knew there was depth there, but you delivered 130% and more. So that is super cool. Let me actually bring up here unknown collector who actually left a tweet.
00:05:57.746 - 00:06:11.184, Speaker A: I mean, with 60,000 followers left a tweet. We might need to scroll a tiny. Look at that. That's pretty interesting. Let me see. I mean, it has a huge audience. There's RJ.
00:06:11.184 - 00:06:30.224, Speaker A: And let me just bring this up. Wow. Look at this. Graphica Png with the new piece. Gotta love. I just love graphica PNg's work. So you know, again, what it's tempting to call an embarrassment of riches out here.
00:06:30.224 - 00:06:45.256, Speaker A: And where is. Cause I saw us there. Retweeted. But I'm not. But he retweeted the maybe. It's maybe. Okay, here it is.
00:06:45.256 - 00:07:08.654, Speaker A: Thank you for your patience. GM just listened to the recorded space by Pokebelly in runner tune with one of the most exciting up and coming artists, RJ. And really loved everything about it. We need more of this. And Pokebelly in general is putting art in the center, which I love. So thank you. And massive shout out to unknown collector who we have quoted.
00:07:08.654 - 00:07:34.934, Speaker A: I have quoted, you know, at least a dozen times, probably more like two dozen times on this show over the months. A regular kind of feature here in the commentary section. So anyways, this is awesome to hear from unknown collector again, has a huge audience. So that is exciting. And yeah, so check that out. I'm going to upload it to YouTube actually. Perhaps today, maybe tomorrow.
00:07:34.934 - 00:08:04.174, Speaker A: Everything is, everything is happening at once here. So continuing on, thank you for the comments and awesome that Kiro got a bid on one of the works we were showing here. Thanks for showing my art. Google translate for the title names. The one you showed got a bid from the legend Elly Pritzker also noticed a big reduction of. So anyways, congrats to that. Yeah, my mom actually also said it's almost gone, so I'm actually really excited.
00:08:04.174 - 00:08:41.314, Speaker A: And shout out to Rata, human boy Santiago and leprochant. And leprochant. And Esteban Pocintesta and Almazonius. So everybody, great to hear from you. So following on this thread, I got this email from Art News yesterday, just their newsletter, and they're talking about Art Basel. And remember, we've been following this whole art market situation, the auctions in May, that didn't go well and everything. So I just wanted to follow up on that here.
00:08:41.314 - 00:09:30.400, Speaker A: And here it is. David Zwerner told the press in the gallery's usual end of day sales report that he would no longer include prices for secondary market sales in future editions. And so I guess they typically report. And of course, David Zerner is like a top tier, top eight kind of, you know, blue chip gallery in the contemporary art world. In the art world, and, you know, sells for millions and everything. So this was interesting, too, just adding evidence to the situation that there may be fishers, perhaps, we don't know, but there may be fissures in the contemporary art market here. So he's no longer reporting the prices for the secondary market.
00:09:30.400 - 00:10:13.988, Speaker A: And what's great about this scene over here is I don't need to explain what the secondary market is. We all know, being in this business here in the digital art space, I am by no means, I am by no means implying that Zwerner is up to any funny business by not reporting secondary market sales. His reputation as an art dealer is as good as it gets. And so, yeah, and then they kind of make a defense for Zwerner, justifiably or not. This is what I wanted to highlight, though. The problem is that his statement comes at a time exactly when secondary market prices appear to be somewhat wobbly. At the auctions last month, money reserve prices were lowered.
00:10:13.988 - 00:11:04.394, Speaker A: If what I heard around the aisles at Basel is correct, collectors are making lowball offers, often through advisors, and it's entirely possible some dealers are accepting them. So that is basically it. So, all to say, there's a couple of things that are being said here that I just wanted to note. Zwerner stops reporting secondary sales. Maybe means something, maybe doesn't. But why now? As the person was pointing out here it comes at a time. And then also this reporter here is getting kind of whispers from Basel, which is happening, I think, still this week, and that people are making low ball offers.
00:11:04.394 - 00:11:57.668, Speaker A: So, and don't forget the guy from pace the other day who was saying it needs to get more rational. And we're also looking for fresh material, which is why I bring it up here, because I think we have a ton of fresh material, and here was just another one. I don't think we need to. Actually, you know what? I did want to be fair, actually, to Zwerner here, because there are a couple of quotes that I wanted to show, and then we can all just make of it what it is. Werner told Art News that he made the move. So speaking about removing the posting, the secondary prices here, he's doing that in order to protect his consignors. And of course, consignment is when you, without selling the work, I say, listen, David Zwerner, you can sell this painting, this Picasso I own, and you get 20%.
00:11:57.668 - 00:12:18.968, Speaker A: That's consignment. So he's doing it to protect his consignors. For their privacy. We will not share prices post sale. This protects a part of my business. And then here was another response. The may sales showed us where the market is referring to those auctions that didn't go so well.
00:12:18.968 - 00:13:15.654, Speaker A: And we can have a sensible conversation with our consignors. So an interesting, so, you know, just kind of more interesting fodder for that whole narrative here, because it could be, I don't know how that relates to us other than the fresh material side of things. But I do think it's interesting because, again, like, at least on Tezos, we're selling works for like $2 here. So I'm not sure if the contemporary art market crashes, if that affects us at all. We're more concerned, really, with the crypto price, with Tezos, let's say, crashing or ethereum or maybe Solana for some of us. So continuing on, just wanted to highlight kind of the latest on that story because it's something that is just something. I think it's worth just a thread worth following, and it's super interesting as well.
00:13:15.654 - 00:13:40.950, Speaker A: And maybe we can learn things from there that maybe at one point or another may apply here. Just wanted to point out that popple continues to make very impressive views here. 240,000. So a quarter of a million views here. And this was done two days ago. So that is interesting and beautiful work. And this is such a great thing.
00:13:40.950 - 00:13:57.298, Speaker A: I would do it, frankly, I plan on doing it more. Just repurposing old work and just posting it on Twitter. And it just brings you followers. It's just like free press. You might as well, if you're gonna be on Twitter, post your work. And this is probably work from two years ago. Very cool work.
00:13:57.298 - 00:14:13.642, Speaker A: Don't cheat. And the person with the cheat codes playing chest here. So really cool pixel art from popple, as usual. Faith love. Also, these works also really get a lot of views. I think they've even gotten more in the past. 196,000.
00:14:13.642 - 00:14:32.250, Speaker A: Let's call it 200,000 for this work here. You're my everything. So interesting kind of cosmic love sort of work. And I did want to highlight how Sabato's film is doing, and it's doing quite well. 16,000. So not bad at all. 66 retweets.
00:14:32.250 - 00:15:06.834, Speaker A: So kind of had a sense that this was going to do well. It seems to be doing well. It'll be interesting again. Check in in a couple of days. Clownvap. Look at these textures. We're back to these digital textures and this idea that on a two dimensional photo version of art that AI is now, I would argue, equaling photographs of oil paintings in terms of their aesthetic effect.
00:15:06.834 - 00:15:45.802, Speaker A: It may even be starting to surpass, I would argue that that is a possibility that we have to consider, because look at how beautiful this brushwork is here. And again, it's kind of like we're back to the implications, more implications for us here. Look at these textures. I hope you like textures. Solo show next week, and I believe this is on super rare, actually, which is pretty cool. I think clownvamp has a couple of things going on. I think there's a solo show which we were, I think, highlighting the other day, and maybe something also curating on super rare.
00:15:45.802 - 00:16:16.674, Speaker A: I can't remember. We'll have to look closer. But again, I just wanted to, like, remember strange things, brushwork, and I don't know who else to call it. I mean, it's, you know, his prompts and his blending and everything. I mean, even it's like blending colors. It's like blending, you know, I mean, arguably, people could be saying, you know, add more, you know, medium. Add more super heavy gel medium to this or add more linseed oil.
00:16:16.674 - 00:17:06.076, Speaker A: We don't know how, you know, in depth these prompts are getting, but what we do know is this is produced by AI, and it's starting to rival the photographic experience of oil paintings. So that is interesting. And again, very quick review. Remember art matter. Remember art matter. Being able to create these three dimensional oil paintings with robots, it's almost like, you know, one could imagine the pen plotter in it may already exist, but it's kind of like the pen plotter for drawing. When are we going to be able to do these with turn these into oil paintings? So it's just an interesting, you know, thread to follow.
00:17:06.076 - 00:17:34.224, Speaker A: Continuing on, Rinnefish with some very cool work trademark and just a really cool bug. I guess it is monster. We'll look at the details in a second. And I really like the noise here, too. I was looking at the colors that rinifish uses, too, in the background, which are super interesting. And again, always this kind of translucent. I almost want to call it, like, opal kind of coloring, almost like pearl or something here.
00:17:34.224 - 00:17:51.216, Speaker A: And just this, again, kind of translucent skin of these bugs. Luna bug marathon. Luna is a lawyer bug who just quit her job to become the 9th contestant in the bug marathon. She's a little nervous, so she brought her little first aid kit. Wow. Where's the first. Oh, there it is.
00:17:51.216 - 00:18:07.596, Speaker A: Oh, that's cute. Very cute. Let's support her. Let's support for her bright future edition of 15. And I believe not listed yet. So just more cool work from rinnefish. And I did want to just highlight, I think she uses very interesting background colors here.
00:18:07.596 - 00:18:49.220, Speaker A: See this kind of desaturated green, this blue. Just interesting kind of what you might even think of as non typical kind of background colors that I just wanted to highlight as we kind of zoom out and look at Rinny Fish's work here. This is beautiful here, too. Just great artist here. A really cool work here by Dan control. So it looks like reusing the VR helmet to make, again, what feels like a warholian version of the VR helmet here. I think Dan control is like, is he 21? I mean, I think he's 21.
00:18:49.220 - 00:19:24.054, Speaker A: I think, like, for those that missed it online, I think he was celebrating his birthday at 21. So for someone that is this prolific and kind of carefree and like, where is Dan control gonna be at age 30? Should this continue? So it's almost like a reason to, you know, it makes them all the more collectible, let's put it that way. So here's a beautiful work. Gotta love the pink. Again, there's something very kind of Warholian about this reserve of 0.15. Nice price and everything. Minted on the 14th there.
00:19:24.054 - 00:19:51.454, Speaker A: And a new work by Bezaya for the sky is the limit. This is the remix Air Khalid. So I don't know the references here, but I know it's cool. And I do know the Air Jordan, at least on the hoodie, what seems to be a hoodie and shorts and some air jordans here. And again, trademark bezaya colors here and everything. Very painterly and beautiful. Almost slightly impressionistic down here.
00:19:51.454 - 00:20:23.310, Speaker A: Also in the clouds on a swing. Again, kind of going with this kind of heavenly vibe here, with the sky and the clouds and everything. Paradiso edition of ten. And this is sold out, available for 42.49. Let's just see. Sold out for 25 on primary in a heartbeat, basically in eight minutes. So a cool 250 tezos for bzzaya in ten minutes.
00:20:23.310 - 00:20:55.968, Speaker A: After making the work, of course, axin with a new work and a cool combination here of pixelation and painting, we're going to actually look closer in a second. Contradictions coexist. And this is for people that have bought zero, that bought a web zero work in the past. So they are on the allow list, I guess you would say, to be able to buy this for 0.2 ETH. And here it is. So this drops at 08:00 p.m.
00:20:55.968 - 00:21:23.934, Speaker A: So if you've bought in a web zero work, you can pick this one up. Interesting combination of painting and pixelation. Again, you see that kind of dithering here, creates a nice contrast, and it's also contrasted in the color. Interesting kind of shadows here, too. Almost Disney esque, I'd say. It's almost like fantasia, where the shadows become personified here. So interesting work, as ever in the smiling computer there.
00:21:23.934 - 00:21:46.304, Speaker A: Cool conceptually, too, of just this. Contradictions coexist of the dithering going inside and outside the robe here. Continuing on, Yuri J. Crash. So I think Yuri posted this months ago, like maybe two or three months ago on Twitter. And I guess it's finally been minted. Maybe there were some final touches.
00:21:46.304 - 00:22:36.470, Speaker A: And I believe there is a reference in that original tweet to crash the movie by David Cronenberg, which, of course, is based on the novel by JG Ballard. And, of course, we see the upside down car here. Beautifully done here, again, in Urij's trademark style of just kind of dividing the canvas into, you know, little areas, outlines, you might say, and then filling them with different kinds of patterning. Very cool work. Again, I don't see the mosaic filter here, the outrageous mosaic filter, but using, oh, there's a little bit of something over here, you know, so just using all kinds of Photoshop filters that are almost never used. And just very cool. Using the tools and seeing what they do to produce interesting results.
00:22:36.470 - 00:22:54.230, Speaker A: So cool. Very cool work. 300 tezos, which is only $212. Now edition of one. There is only one. So this was just listed. Julie Rose, who I'm not sure if I was following on object or not.
00:22:54.230 - 00:23:14.304, Speaker A: I missed this coming out maybe two weeks ago here. May 31. This very cool artist here. There's 13 left at five tazos, which is only $3.54. Interesting illustration. And I. Her Twitter feed is excellent, I just might add there.
00:23:14.304 - 00:23:50.566, Speaker A: Like, I was just going over the Twitter feed, and I was just finding work after work after work. That was interesting to look at. We probably have a few in here today. So, yeah, just a heads up on that one. So, anyway, interesting. I think we've looked at her work maybe three or four months ago, and here it is again, kind of abstract and just kind of fun, really, with cool kind of, you know, almost like a landscape here and a surrealist object and, you know, interesting kind of sculptural illustration, shall we say, with a beautiful gradient here. So cool artist.
00:23:50.566 - 00:24:14.858, Speaker A: Did I bring up her page? This I found. We'll go to Goro in a second here. Let's just bring up her page really quickly. Watercolor digital artist. Yeah, so we've definitely looked at these other works here in the past. So, Julie Rose, great follow on Twitter, by the way. Continuing on this, I found this Goro piece on Julie's feed.
00:24:14.858 - 00:24:50.274, Speaker A: You know, it's so easy to miss stuff, you know, so much gets missed in the feed. So Gora conjure, and this is on foundation digital illustration. So almost kind of a magical work here. Again, very cool illustrator, I guess you would call Gora. And here it is, the conjurer and some sort of, you know, biomorphic object here. Interesting positioning of the sun, perhaps. Interesting colors here too.
00:24:50.274 - 00:25:14.234, Speaker A: Interesting kind of stylization of the arm, you know. So lots of interesting things going on here. Just kind of having fun, it seems like kind of freestyling it and cool signature here too. Nice, nice touch here too, with this little square pixel. Very interesting detail. So available for 0.25 ETH.
00:25:14.234 - 00:25:54.212, Speaker A: And we have another one, this was from super rare. So Gora doing Saturn devouring his son, which of course is based on Goya. So maybe Gora and Goya, maybe that's where the name comes from. So interesting interpretation, isn't it? I mean, you can see Saturn in the back here, completely different than the Goya piece. Should we just bring it up for comparison? It's always fun to bring up the art history here, so let's do that. And you know, Goya's an artist, very famous images. I mean, here it is.
00:25:54.212 - 00:26:24.702, Speaker A: Remember Ben sector, put out a work like this as well. There's a wonderful dithered pixelation work by Ben sector of this, by the way, heads up on object if you're looking for it. So here is the original by Goya and then so interesting. Quite a change in the interpretation here. So that is pretty cool. And that is also. And accepted an offer of half an ETH.
00:26:24.702 - 00:26:46.344, Speaker A: So that is a pretty impressive sale there. Probably $1,000 because it was in April. Pretty good, very good. And also, so Gora up to all sorts of stuff here. And also this on foundation drops eight unique pieces. And I thought the selling technique was quite interesting here. So eight unique pieces, 0.15
00:26:46.344 - 00:27:11.070, Speaker A: ETH per mint. And I guess these are the pieces, right? And then you get the link and it brings you to foundation and this is what it is. And I was like, oh, this is weird, like there's no date on this. And you, you know, I can't make the image bigger. But the reason why is this is like your preview image and then you mint it. And then once it comes out, then I think it comes below and then you see it. So this is like the preview image here.
00:27:11.070 - 00:27:55.564, Speaker A: So an interesting way of selling art, you know, always trying different things here and everything. This is, you know, you see axin with the classic, you know, okay, you've bought from this series, then you're allowed to buy on this over here. Here's another one, which is kind of like, you know, reminiscent of the PFP, the profile picture projects, how they do their launches. And we saw also, I think it was. Was it Maria Marina Amidova and also acidboy who did these foundation drops like this. So again, very interesting. I don't think any have gone yet, but I just think it's cool.
00:27:55.564 - 00:28:27.984, Speaker A: This was found in Julie. Is it Julie Rose? Let's just quickly look Julie Rose. This was found in Julie Rose's feed as well. Just a cool illustration here. This is someone called hara, haranikala, perhaps at Gmail, haranikala. So just, I thought another interesting kind of illustration, kind of poetic here, has a bit of an anime feeling to it, or manga, I should say. And this artist, this was also found in Julie Rose's feed.
00:28:27.984 - 00:29:02.120, Speaker A: And this artist we've looked at months ago, but it was fun to just see something recent. Louis Mort. And I'm not sure, I think I already followed them. I'm not sure if this is a new one or an old one. It doesn't really matter. Just this kind of bunny figure, just cool illustrator, another different kind of style, really nicely put together, would work beautifully as prints. And I wasn't sure if this was Berka Bayram or not because the name is Berku or Bayram and Berku, not Berka and Festina Lente.
00:29:02.120 - 00:29:41.696, Speaker A: And so this is a, just an interesting abstract here with just interesting colors, simple shapes and everything. And again, digital painting, maybe it's someone different, but I just stumbled across that nice color. Plus, what is gamma. So now I was like, okay, here's a new walking figure. And then I saw, this is from 2009. So the implication here, the inference is that Francois gammer has been doing these walking figures for going on 14 years at least. And that is quite something.
00:29:41.696 - 00:30:06.778, Speaker A: I mean, there could be thousands of these, thousands of variations of the walking figure. I mean, that is really quite something. So very cool. Only three available, so they are selling. And she puts out a ton of work. So that is impressive at three tezos each. Here's another new one, I believe, hand 64 by Francoise Gamma.
00:30:06.778 - 00:30:38.320, Speaker A: That I thought was interesting, too. So playing more with just kind of a 3d modeling and what looks like some kind of light pixelation. I mean, there are great screen filters, I know on the iPhone, I use one in particular. And it gives you, like, if you want Atari, you want this kind of dithering. I mean, there are incredible apps out there for. And that's kind of what this reminds me of. It's like, this is the, you know, maybe Commodore 64 or maybe Atari.
00:30:38.320 - 00:31:01.384, Speaker A: Actually, this looks more like an Atari screen kind of rendering. Who knows? Anyway, cool work. Hand 64, maybe Commodore 64, perhaps the clue in the name maybe. And ten have gone. So that is also impressive. Again, considering the market and everything, that is really impressive. And just a window into Francoise Gamma's process here.
00:31:01.384 - 00:31:34.726, Speaker A: So this looks like cinema 4D is the software listed here, which I've never heard of. So again, maybe another clue as to how you see it looks like 3d objects and everything. So maybe a clue into how Francois Gamma makes her work and what she uses. Demon ego with a cool post. I'm not sure if it's a new or an older work. Looks like some dancing demons here and some demons here and everything. So just kind of a cool looking, pretty dithered, I think.
00:31:34.726 - 00:32:02.374, Speaker A: And just a cool work here with some cool ascii text as well. How are the views? Twelve and a half thousand. I was like, you know, stuff like this oxen is. I think he did it on that last one. Stuff like this goes over very well. Just like that matrix writing, you know, like a lot of artists are using, like. Yeah, so, you know, just on a practical level, something worth trying out.
00:32:02.374 - 00:32:24.910, Speaker A: I say to myself more than anyone, this is a really cool work. I miss this element Li, who we check in with every so often. I hadn't seen for a while. This came out April 3. I don't think we saw this one. It's possible I've covered this before and that we looked at it, but not entirely sure. And so you have the computers that are kind of stretched out and everything.
00:32:24.910 - 00:32:45.602, Speaker A: So very cool. Experimental pixel artist. Okay. And one of the great things that we learned from RJ yesterday, one of the great insights. Very, very simple, actually, a couple. One of the reasons RJ likes pixel art is because, as he says, it's all pixel art. When you zoom in.
00:32:45.602 - 00:33:29.282, Speaker A: When you zoom in, this alternates into pixel art, which kind of adds to our conversation of, how do we define pixel art? And because he's totally right. When you zoom in, it all turns into pixel art. And maybe that is like a part of the definition that it's bigger pixels. But at what point do you stop the. How do you decide what's big enough to be pixel art and what's not? Is dithering pixel art? Interesting question. And so that is one of the reasons he likes pixel art, because it's almost like this elemental, you know, way of dealing with the medium. Like it's dealing with the medium, you might say, on its own terms, you might say, in the light, in its most basic language form.
00:33:29.282 - 00:34:05.828, Speaker A: It's kind of like a raw expression of digital art to a certain degree, was the point that he was kind of making, at least as far as I understood it. So here is some experimental pixel art, and this is quite beautiful. I think my favorite part is this kind of four on the floor pixels, and almost what I want to call, like four on the floor dithering here, but maybe it's just pixels. Very nicely done. It looks like almost like a beach or something. And these nicely, kind of unfinished palm trees, in a sense, like I put in quotes, unfinished. Really nicely done.
00:34:05.828 - 00:34:18.800, Speaker A: I gotta say, I love the background here. And it's almost like this is sand. And then here's computers on the beach. Anyway, really interesting work here. Still available for 0.1 ETH. Pretty interesting artwork.
00:34:18.800 - 00:34:43.116, Speaker A: Again, it makes me think of, like, institutions now, I had a work by. I had a work by element ly loaded up here. Let me just make sure. So somehow that disappeared element ly, because there's a cool swimming pool. This is what I want to show you. So just a cool post from element Li. That's how I returned.
00:34:43.116 - 00:35:09.508, Speaker A: I was like, has this been posted yet? And how are we doing? 630 views. I could see some of element Li's work going a lot further, too. Kind of almost has a bit of a hockney feel to the pool there. Interesting reflection of a palm tree. And so all very cool. And going outside the lines here. Really interesting, kind of bold pixel art here from elemently.
00:35:09.508 - 00:35:37.696, Speaker A: Here's another bold work. You see how long this is? I just think this is really, really cool. This is by Kappn, just posted here. So I just wanted to show it here. Like, it goes all the way down here, so. And very interesting composition. So the work, you know, if you were able to see it in without the black background on twitter here, it's quite an interesting composition just by using this negative space underneath.
00:35:37.696 - 00:36:09.152, Speaker A: It's very interesting work from Kappen, keeping it interesting. Stippin pixel, another great pixel artist here. So here are some kids playing street moment number 42. So a new work by stippin with a kind of wavy gravy reality matrix background, for lack of better words. And so anyway, cool work here. Almost as if they're on like a trampoline or something, playing in the playground. Almost like an impressionistic.
00:36:09.152 - 00:36:33.738, Speaker A: An impression of what that would be like in that whole experience of playing and having fun. So, cool work there. And has it sold? Yeah, sold. Five tezos gone. So works are still selling here. Maybe they're going to sell even better than ever with tezos. It could go to like $0.45,
00:36:33.738 - 00:36:55.962, Speaker A: which could be, like, amazing for all our collections here. Muji with a brand new work at ten tazos, which again, isn't like $7.09. So beautiful work here. Nice. Probably deluxe paint is a software. And just see this. This is dithering, beautiful dithered gradient here.
00:36:55.962 - 00:37:15.074, Speaker A: And just kind of a mysterious work, kind of abstract, almost metaphysical. Like some planets, a portal here of sorts, and some nice rainbow. And here, using what I call the matrix writing. And it's called obelisk. A river of colors runs inside the diagonal. Obelisk. So it's a obelisk.
00:37:15.074 - 00:37:33.682, Speaker A: Interestingly so, this is an edition of ten for ten tezos. There are ten left. It was just minted. And here's another one. A one of one that I don't think we saw using the same colors here for 125 tezos. That is pretty awesome. 125 tezos.
00:37:33.682 - 00:37:56.292, Speaker A: Pixel art. There is really something to be said for pixel art, isn't there? So very, very interesting. And here, kind of similar colors. And you have this kind of sphere here, dripping rainbow colors and just some sort of structure. We'll see what this is called. Color tower. Great title.
00:37:56.292 - 00:38:10.180, Speaker A: Let's see how long that took. That was basically sold. The next day, an offer came in within 35 minutes for 125 tezos. That is impressive. And that was just a couple of days ago. Three days ago. So about $100.
00:38:10.180 - 00:38:25.066, Speaker A: Very nice. And this is one I missed. Short circuited workspace. Again, matrix writing here. No intel can be obtained from the system once linked to a brain that worked too much. Edition of seven. And that went for five tezos each.
00:38:25.066 - 00:38:46.190, Speaker A: I thought this was a really cool one. I love the keyboard of what looks like a laptop here. So more just really nice work here. Using retro tools from Meuji, mech, TXT mints. The work that. That was on Twitter, that did fabulously on Twitter. So, let's see if this was listed.
00:38:46.190 - 00:39:10.736, Speaker A: So again, playing again with movement, making the pixel art dynamic an interesting decision. Flying profits, and the crane finally descends. Three color pixel art, 280 by 280, scaled up by ten. And so offers are coming in at 15 tazos. So that is pretty impressive. Edition of 20. I mean, that could turn into 300 tazos, which these days is over $200.
00:39:10.736 - 00:39:30.052, Speaker A: So not bad at all. Again, pixel art. We got a ton of it here. Ultimate mini golf. How are we doing? Gonna speed up a little bit here, byte by bit with another, you know, virtual video game here of a mini golf game. Ultimate mini Golf 2000 press space. Beautiful sport, buddy.
00:39:30.052 - 00:40:02.944, Speaker A: One of one for 25 tazos. And there it is, Edmarola, with some really interesting experimentation here. Ten skeleton warriors in line, holding gifts. So, again, pixel art, that's really getting experimental here and just kind of blended out and really interesting lighting here. Kind of has a ritualistic feel, and these skulls and everything. There is nothing like Ed Marolla's work out there. It is totally its own thing.
00:40:02.944 - 00:40:14.976, Speaker A: Edition of 22. There are three left, and the market likes it. Here's another one. This is for 15 ETH, and this was minted May 31. I don't think I'd seen this before. I think it's called the key master. We'll look in a second.
00:40:14.976 - 00:40:32.884, Speaker A: And so here's a guy with some keys and almost feels like a role playing game. And this beautiful frame here and this movement and everything. Keymaster solitude. Great title. Very poetic and beautiful. Santiago, with some more pixelated abstracts here. This is a game.
00:40:32.884 - 00:40:55.712, Speaker A: And upscaled to a massive size. 6500 by 7000 there. So more interesting pixelated abstracts from. And I use the word pixelation. Experimental, let's call it that, by santiago. Here's another one with, again, almost looking like cut up text on the side, which is a nice touch. And again, we see the dithering here.
00:40:55.712 - 00:41:21.894, Speaker A: It almost looks like a beautiful carpet of sorts. You can probably get those made if you want. Edition of 15. And is this sold out? This stuff is selling like. I mean, this is impressive. The market is still, you know, it's going still, despite everything that's going on out there, work is selling, and this is really exciting. Human kernel, who has some similar work here.
00:41:21.894 - 00:41:38.738, Speaker A: So lucky. Angry birthday rabbit. So this is for little cakes birthday. So shout out and happy birthday to little cakes. Who has been on the Twitter spaces? We've shown some of little cakes work here. A prominent person in the community. So that is super cool.
00:41:38.738 - 00:42:02.900, Speaker A: I love the border here, how you see this, what I want to call, like, dithering or bitmap ization. These are really interesting. Again, it's kind of like this, you know, dithered abstraction. Right. This is human kernel. I'm not sure if that's Santiago or not. Really cool art, though, from human kernel.
00:42:02.900 - 00:42:14.396, Speaker A: Does a lot of those pfps. Here's another one. This is kind of classic human kernel. Very experimental. Bb soldier. And here you see another portrait. Very cool.
00:42:14.396 - 00:42:31.464, Speaker A: Edition of 13 on secondary for 25. From Lego Joe. Big shout out to Lego Joe. Authentic waffles. And we have some music here. This is also for little cake's birthday. Cool music.
00:42:31.464 - 00:42:59.644, Speaker A: Kind of sounds like the residence or something. This is really cool. Like, what a nice gift. Happy birthday, little cakes. Edition of five. Let's see what happened. Offers are coming in, transferred five to little cakes.
00:42:59.644 - 00:43:23.300, Speaker A: Very, very, very cool. I assume authentic waffles, also known as hasdrubal waffle, made the music there. So very cool. And Lorna Mills scrap Kent toot. Lorna has been posting a lot of these experiments on Twitter. So it's finally minted one of these works here. So just cool experimentation as ever.
00:43:23.300 - 00:43:41.196, Speaker A: And what is this selling for? Buy for 30 tazos. And that is on primary. There are 14 left. Edition of 15, so they're not flying out the door. But they were just listed today, so give it some time. Interesting work. And let's just see if she's posted any others.
00:43:41.196 - 00:43:59.964, Speaker A: There are a couple. So there we go. And there's also this other one, Terry, number 27. So kind of a new series here from Lorna Mills, as far as I can tell. I've never seen that style before. It's interesting, John, with a bit of a metaphysical work here. Let me just load it up.
00:43:59.964 - 00:44:27.414, Speaker A: And I don't think there's volume on it. So opening the portal here to another dimension. Seemingly cool kind of grid cubic room here. Cool grid room again, kind of has a metaphysical feeling to the whole thing. Available for 350, maybe this was actually. This is not a newer work. I saw a beautiful one with a synth, actually.
00:44:27.414 - 00:44:44.046, Speaker A: This is from January. This must have been listed so it came in my notifications. And also these things need reloaded up. It is late in the day, but this. But we're getting through it here. And we're going to run through the rest of this episode. So beautiful work with Kurt Hussle collective and hologram gallery.
00:44:44.046 - 00:45:09.714, Speaker A: A ticket to the ball game featuring the Seattle Hustlers. So just more cool work by Kurt Hussle collective as ever. Keeping with the baseball theme versus the New York escapers. Those are actually pretty good. Pretty good names for teams. And then Mickrenders. I sure hope we can get Mickrenders work rendering here.
00:45:09.714 - 00:45:19.222, Speaker A: Let's see. Turbulent bliss. Mcrenders with dithers. It is a tv. We might need to come back. There it is. Let's see if we can get it.
00:45:19.222 - 00:45:35.514, Speaker A: There we go. And it's one of these. I think it's a GLB. And there they signed it on the back with that super cool kind of arcade game writing and some stickers on this retro tv. So that is very cool. Edition of 20 for six tezos. And they are on primary.
00:45:35.514 - 00:45:49.578, Speaker A: Another tv here. Recano continuing. And this looks like kind of like Donkey Kong or something. I'm not exactly sure. Kind of looks like a video game, but kind of not. And here are some bananas as well. And a retro tv.
00:45:49.578 - 00:46:05.266, Speaker A: Very cool. And this sold out. So McGrender's picking up a couple and five tezos each. Defi Boston. So this continues to go. This continues over here. Spider Man 2099 by polygon, 1993.
00:46:05.266 - 00:46:25.344, Speaker A: Just a beautiful rendering of this kind of classic comic book cover. I almost know the name of the artist I recognize. I feel like it's Rick someone. Spider Man 2099. I recognize this artist. He was actually people, Rick Leonardi. This is Rick Leonardi.
00:46:25.344 - 00:46:54.064, Speaker A: I do know my comic artists up until 2000 or so. This is Rick Leonardi. So yeah, this is a famous comic cover. Nice treatment. LB with a cool still, beautifully textured still. LB keeps pushing, is having a beautiful moment here, I think was just making LB's on fire. Let's just say this sold for 25 tazos to NFT spritz.
00:46:54.064 - 00:47:09.184, Speaker A: So that is cool here. Still 45. And John Cates with a couple here. Illustration, mechanical interventions. The artificially illustrated glitch. Western project primer for machine learners. So just a cool still of a western landscape here.
00:47:09.184 - 00:47:32.490, Speaker A: Looks like the southwest in the US. And glitched out a prominent glitch artist from my understanding here, who's been around for more than a decade. Innovator. Here's another one. Is this electricity? And it's an open edition for only one tezos, which is $0.71. So you can get a work by John Cates here for $0.71. Cool glitch work here, here.
00:47:32.490 - 00:48:08.100, Speaker A: The real deal when it comes to glitch here. So FYI, from my understanding, I am not a total expert, though, on the glitch front. Evelyn o with a cool work. This is, I believe, AI digital painting and AI fres row. So just an interesting experimentation here with a portrait of sorts and the beard kind of feeling like brushwork a little bit using AI. Just an interesting work here from Evelyn o some text which looks AI based and everything. Edition of 15 and sold out.
00:48:08.100 - 00:48:37.386, Speaker A: So the market at ten tezos each. So this is awesome. The market continues to be, you know, it's looking str. I don't know if I'd call it strong, but it's looking fairly strong, which is kind of interesting, you know, just considering everything out there. White solitude edition of seven. So again, these AI brush strokes, just as we were highlighting in clownvamp at the beginning of this episode, these digital textures. This is AI, from what I understand.
00:48:37.386 - 00:49:07.934, Speaker A: So pretty impressive brushwork here, especially when you go, I'm not sure how well you can see it, but over here and just these little splashes and everything, it's getting to be utterly convincing. So that is cool. Soon with a work morning from serene sanctuary, only a tezos edition of 20. And so that is cool here. It's cool to vary up the prices also, which zoom is doing. I think that's cool. And the additions and everything, really nice AI artwork here.
00:49:07.934 - 00:49:38.782, Speaker A: And Venta also with a new one, entangled and estranged. And again, kind of these 3d plasticine figures of sorts, and a lot of skulls in a landscape here. So a little bit of sea in the background. And this is venta and AI. So probably digital painting in there or some intervention of some kind. Very cool. And Marina Amidova on Instagram here with another cool kind of what looks like a raw AI artwork portrait.
00:49:38.782 - 00:50:09.130, Speaker A: I'm not seeing any of these minted, but they may be minted somewhere. And check this out. This is strange thing, doing some experimentation here, experimenting with AI, retro style night poster. So it doesn't stop here. And it's incredible how many images, I mean, once you start to master AI, I mean, I bet strange thing makes a hundred images a day. Maybe it's more. I mean, he's going to outdo Picasso, you know, and a lot of AI artists are going to be able to do that.
00:50:09.130 - 00:50:38.836, Speaker A: So that's just really interesting, isn't it? So cool work here from AI art pioneer strange thing. And here's another example of why strange thing is doing so well. Baroque inspired tracksuits and boots. So, moving over to baroque, baroque, baroque here with strange thing and some just really cool fashion combinations. Great fashion concepts here. Super interesting. A little bit of the relief here too.
00:50:38.836 - 00:51:12.052, Speaker A: And so the experimentation continues to deliver results here for a strange thing. And let's speed up a little bit. Another more experimenting actually here with food. Renaissance revival inspired kitchenware. So break out your 3d printer and look at this. So just, again, really interesting concepts using combination, really of sorts, combining things and blending them together and all sorts of stuff. Even adding some animation in here, which is interesting.
00:51:12.052 - 00:51:28.632, Speaker A: So trying out different things. Look at that fork design here. So very, very. You could almost imagine that in a museum. So very interesting here as well. And look at that toaster. Anyway, beautiful work by strange thing.
00:51:28.632 - 00:51:53.580, Speaker A: There's your cereal doctor version with a physical work as we wrap up here. Ryan Crotty, Bloodline 2022. Now, I'm not, I think this is doctor version. I'm not actually not positive. I thought this was because it kind of reminds me of his work and maybe this is a physical version of his work. So anyway, cool painting here. Again, really interesting to see the similar themes, if they are the same person.
00:51:53.580 - 00:52:24.744, Speaker A: And so very cool. 14 by eleven inches there. And Dalcante draws also with a physical work as an NFT and just has a total natural sense for composition here. And just an amazing illustrator and sense of color is excellent as well. Interesting perspective here too. So beautifully, beautifully done here at auction for ten tezos edition of one. And there are 19 hours left.
00:52:24.744 - 00:52:45.026, Speaker A: And here's my friend Ben. He had to redo his account because he got locked out. So he's at eight Enm art and he does a lot of memes here. I've shown his work before. Rip ODB. You would have loved aliexpress. So I guess there's a meme with the rip.
00:52:45.026 - 00:53:02.160, Speaker A: We saw it with Haiti rocket Rip. Oscar Wilde. You would have loved watching your own Instagram story. So I think he's taking memes. And look how beautifully done here again with the spray paint here as well. And I think he uses water based oil paints, which is interesting too. Here you see Winamp.
00:53:02.160 - 00:53:10.844, Speaker A: So really cool artist. Nice rendition of Vermeer here. Girl with a pearl earring. And that's your show, everyone. Thank you for watching. And until next time, take care.
