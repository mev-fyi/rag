00:00:15.680 - 00:01:06.044, Speaker A: He's been one of the biggest advocates of AI art from the early days when artists began minting AI artworks on the blockchain. As an artist, collector, and thought leader today, we're thrilled to welcome Clown Vamp to the show to discuss all things AI, including his first solo show taking place at Canvas three gallery at the Oculus World Trade center in New York City. Artist journal, July 5, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and an undisclosed location on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome, everyone. Welcome Clownvamp. I tell you, I'm so glad you showed up here because Runetune, the co host, I have a feeling, had a late night.
00:01:06.044 - 00:01:07.476, Speaker A: Clownvamp, how are you doing?
00:01:07.660 - 00:01:21.104, Speaker B: I'm great. Also, I have, like, a tech question. So are you just playing the music next to a microphone or is there some, like, fancy thing? Like, that's. Every time I watch on YouTube, I'm always like, what is going on? Like, how does that work?
00:01:21.704 - 00:01:50.372, Speaker A: So what I do, I'm very lo fi, like, so it's the same thing for the show. So I do the. So for the Twitter space, what I do is I have my laptop playing just out of the laptop speakers, and I just put my phone right beside it. And then for the show, I do the exact opposite where I just play the phone into the microphone and I actually like the song better like that.
00:01:50.548 - 00:01:59.864, Speaker B: There's something kind of like cypherpunk about it that I like. When I listen, I'm like, oh, yeah, I feel very, like. I feel like I'm on the set of, like, oprah now.
00:02:00.604 - 00:02:02.796, Speaker A: Well, it's like my CQ.
00:02:02.900 - 00:02:04.544, Speaker B: I like your art, Oprah.
00:02:04.844 - 00:02:21.130, Speaker A: Yeah, we're the art Oprah. The underground Oprah of web3 here. Welcome clownvamp. I have a new title here. I love it already. You know, I just watched an interview with someone that works for Oprah, and it's funny. It's like, you don't call her Oprah.
00:02:21.130 - 00:02:24.218, Speaker A: You call her Miss Winfrey when you work for Oprah.
00:02:24.306 - 00:02:26.254, Speaker B: Yeah. Ok, mister Pokeballey.
00:02:26.834 - 00:02:47.794, Speaker A: Well, you can call me Adrian, but that's what it's like for Oprah. So anyway, it's a hilarious little tidbit. What a crowd that's coming in already for this show. So, hey, everyone, it's gonna be a very. Yeah, it's gonna be a very fun show. Clownvamp is a very fun, exciting, positive individuals. This can be a ton of fun.
00:02:47.794 - 00:03:01.894, Speaker A: So great opportunity today to come on stage, hang out, ask questions, and you know Clownvamp. So here we are. Now, you don't need. You're in an undisclosed location, and you probably liked it that way.
00:03:02.794 - 00:03:06.674, Speaker B: I assume I'm in an undisclosed location in New York City.
00:03:06.834 - 00:03:35.920, Speaker A: Oh, you're in New York. Okay. That is what I was wondering. So how are things going? I mean, you just have this show that opened, I know you just from following the AI art thing as I discovered it. And I have to say I was a little skeptical at the beginning. I was one of these people who said, this is just pushing a button, even though it's pretty impressive what we're seeing. And over a few weeks, I changed my view and now I make it myself.
00:03:35.920 - 00:03:42.096, Speaker A: And I'm a huge fan of the possibilities. So anyways, tell us what's new? What's happening? Clownvap.
00:03:42.160 - 00:04:45.684, Speaker B: Yeah, so I'm kind of a little bit in sort of like emotional hangover recovery. You can have emotional hangover from positive feelings just so. My solo show was a couple weeks ago. We did a one night only IRL sort of activation of it, which is a, the show was a recreation of a fictitious queer lost grandmaster painter. And the whole show was about pointing out the sort of missing pieces, the missing gaps in art history and sort of the ways that art history reflects sort of contemporary and historic biases. And the show is, I mean, it was like, my pin post has a bunch of pictures from it, but it was like, it was so like, you know, we had, the crowd was like one third NfT people, one third AI nerds, one third sort of like random people from my life. And it was really cool because, like, you know, the AI nerds were explaining to the, to the non AI people, like, how things work.
00:04:45.684 - 00:05:42.676, Speaker B: And the people who were not had no familiarity with any of this stuff were just, like, getting really engrossed by the story. And so it was like incredibly self actualizing and fulfilling and, yeah, it was just great. And, you know, the one edit on your very kind intro was I actually wasn't that early to AI. You know, I was early to diffusion based AI, which is sort of what we're all using today with mid journey and stable diffusion and dolly. But there were people working with gans for years, and it's been really cool to see the AI community over the last year just sort of explode. And a lot of people on the same journey I have, and you have, too, which is like, there's this new magic genie lamp that can do all these crazy things. And it's so powerful that I think a lot of us approach it with skepticism and then there's some sort of, like, transformation into, you know, acceptance and eventually, you know, celebration of it.
00:05:42.676 - 00:05:54.264, Speaker B: And so, yeah, I'm really glad to be here and I'm feeling good working on some new projects and, you know, kind of in art creating mode, which is, which is a nice place to be.
00:05:55.924 - 00:06:24.084, Speaker A: Absolutely. And that's such an important point that you bring up. It's, there were people that have been doing this for probably near a decade in the AI programmers. There's a guy, true face, who has been programming, he makes his own algorithms. So very important point that you make there because it has exploded. And that is when it came on my radar. And interestingly, I was just.
00:06:27.884 - 00:06:28.372, Speaker B: Since I.
00:06:28.388 - 00:06:49.788, Speaker A: Had crypto, I think, and then all of a sudden, you just kind of have this aha moment where you just kind of almost put your ego on the shelf for a second and you just accept that maybe this is a good idea. And once you, you know, you load up metamask or you load up mid and off you go, and you're almost never the same, you know, totally.
00:06:49.836 - 00:07:27.114, Speaker B: And I, and I think it's interesting, too, because, like, you know, the funny thing to me about aircraft is that, you know, there's still people on this journey. You have people who accepted crypto. They've accepted nfts. They maybe even accepted generative art, but they haven't yet accepted AI art, right? And so it's like, but everyone gets there eventually. And I think, to me, crypto, you know, blockchain based art, technology and AI makes the most sense in the world. It's like two peas in a pod, right? If you're going to have sort of the age of abundance where content is just, you know, there's more content than you could have ever imagined. And I on chain Providence is going to matter a lot.
00:07:27.114 - 00:08:16.484, Speaker B: And so one thing that I don't talk about a lot, but I feel really strongly about is the sort of on chain nature of it. And I think that actually matters quite a bit. And I think I'm sort of a big believer that when it comes to NFT, digital art is the sort of natural medium for nfts. And I think AI art is the most natural potential category of it because you have so many interesting questions around Providence and creation and all these things, and blockchain solves a lot of that. And so I actually think when we think about nfts and we think about what does the world look like ten years from now? I think that air and the corresponding art movement is going to be one of the biggest boosters to the Nft ecosystem, generally.
00:08:18.344 - 00:08:41.038, Speaker A: Fascinating. And you're like a big collector as well. And so, like, you have a lot of conviction, you might say, in this space. So what was your aha moment then? Because, like, tell us a little bit. Like, and very briefly, like, when did you get into crypto and then when did you have, like, the AI? Like, was it before mid journey or admin journey or just tell us a.
00:08:41.046 - 00:09:02.768, Speaker B: Little bit about the background. So my crypto journey was maybe similar to a lot of people on this call, really stop and go. So, you know, I think I looked it up. I forget 2012 or 2013. I think it was 2012, my first bitcoin purchase. And then it was like, you know, very shortly after my first sale, like, I sold, I bought it. I think it doubled or something.
00:09:02.768 - 00:09:51.380, Speaker B: And I sold all of it. And I was like, wow, I'm really smart. Like, I got, I got one on them, you know, like, I was like, and that turned out to be really dumb, obviously. And so I went through, like a long period in the woods of just like every couple years sort of building up the conviction that maybe this isn't, you know, maybe this isn't a scam, buying it and then it going up and then thinking, okay, well, maybe it's probably just a scam, I should sell it. And, you know, count my blessings. And so I was a crypto skeptic up until 20, I guess 20, late 2020, early 2021. And I got onboarded sort of for real with NBA top shot, which, you know, is sort of, I think it was a lot of people's onboardings because, you know, you didn't need a metamask wallet.
00:09:51.380 - 00:10:42.034, Speaker B: You just needed a credit card. And I don't like basketball, but really enjoyed, you know, as a kid, I was always collecting Pokemon cards and I've always liked collecting things. And so there was just something, you know, primordial that this was scratching. And I just fell in love with it and I fell in love with nfts. And that led to collecting pfps. And then, you know, I was a really active participant in PFP summer and then eventually got burned out, you know, started the clownvamp sort of Persona count, you know, I don't know what exactly you call it to be able to focus on art and you just collecting art. And then March of 2022, the mid journey beta was going on and people were starting to post things they were making.
00:10:42.034 - 00:11:21.274, Speaker B: It was a private beta. I think they were on mid journey v two, I think was the model that was currently being used at that point. And, you know, it was just one of these things of, like, I was like, whoa, these. And now if you look back at them, they look like, you know, pieces of melted wax. But at the time, I was like, this is amazing. And started, like, collecting a few pieces. Some of the early stuff I collected was like, you know, rare, who now is a really successful, super rare artist, you know, Indy, who might be on the call indie Salta Nikita, and got really fascinated.
00:11:21.274 - 00:12:08.750, Speaker B: And then Xerox, who's a really popular Tezos artist, he was playing with these things, and I asked him if you could help me get an invite to the beta. He got me invited to the beta, and from there, it was just like, game over. Like, I think I spent the amount of hours of my life that have since been redirected towards creating. Ir is just, you know, it's a huge percentage of my time. And, you know, it's pretty immediately love at first sight. Even, you know, looking back at these, like, weird, you know, sort of surrealist candle waxy images, there was something about the experience of, you know, taking an idea and having it come out the other side and the experience of massaging that that was just. It was meditative.
00:12:08.750 - 00:12:18.314, Speaker B: It was fulfilling. It was, you know, it scratched the storytelling itch that I have. And, yeah, just game over from there.
00:12:19.734 - 00:13:14.548, Speaker A: Well, it's so interesting that you say that, that it was time well spent and it worked, that it was taking so much of your time, because it does feel like time well spent. I mean, I spent a lot of my morning this morning making AI art or just fooling around with it. And I think that's a key kind of part to understanding the getting past the. Is this just pushing a button sort of idea? Because it's actually quite hard to do, I would argue, to make what I would call to get the results you're looking for in AI art. Like, you do have to sit with it for quite a few hours to start to, you know, get somewhere with it. So I guess my question for you is, how long did it take for you to start to get somewhere as an artist? So you got in the beta, maybe that was, like, April or may about a year ago.
00:13:14.676 - 00:13:17.504, Speaker B: I mean, 1314 months ago. Yeah.
00:13:18.324 - 00:13:22.628, Speaker A: So how long did it take you for you to get somewhere? Was there almost right away, like. Or.
00:13:22.676 - 00:13:58.150, Speaker B: I was. I was iterating a lot. And then in May of 22, I started getting somewhere, and it was playing with some different styles and aesthetics, and one that really stood out for me was I started, you know, creating. I was sort of playing with the constraints of it and, you know, the melted wax. One of the few sort of formats that it played well with was impressionist art. And I really like impressious art. And I really, you know, I think it's also something that people, you know, there's something about impressious art that to me, is kind of funny of like, if you're.
00:13:58.150 - 00:14:33.436, Speaker B: If you've never, you know, even if you don't really like art, you know what impressious art is probably because of Van Gogh and some of these, like, highly popularized parts of the art canon. And so there's something sort of punk rock to me about playing with that, out of this, you know, AI system. And I created this and I've since actually minted it. I call it my style genesis, but it's on tezos. But it was a UFO and a precious art style. I actually minted it much later, once people started liking some of the stuff I was doing, I was like, oh, I should mint this. And so it's minted.
00:14:33.436 - 00:15:05.938, Speaker B: It's like a one of ten. But anyway, it was an impressionist UFO. And there was something about it that just was really striking of a. At the time, mid journey was actually able to create sort of decent ish impressionist art compared to a lot of other styles. Like, we couldn't create a photo very well. And there was something really brain glitching about seeing, you know, some of the semi coherent piece of impressions art with a UFO in it. I remember I showed it to a friend who's not involved at all in sort of this stuff.
00:15:05.938 - 00:15:48.884, Speaker B: And I was telling how excited I am about, you know, AI and how I've been playing with it. He was like, this is really cool. I hang this in my house. And that little comment was just like, sometimes I think when you're creating art, other people don't know how maybe conflicted you are, how anxious you are, or how nervous you are. And even small comments of support can mean a big thing. So that little comment actually sparked a lot of feelings of, okay, maybe there's something here. And so I kept working on it and, you know, developed this idea of this story of, um, an impressionist painter who witnesses an alien invasion and has to, you know, um, you know, has to sort of express his creativity in this post apocalyptic world.
00:15:48.884 - 00:16:32.704, Speaker B: And he starts to paint these scenes and it started to build this universe in this world. And I started minting those the first week of June 2022. And, um, you know, pretty immediately found a lot of kindred spirits and people who like this sort of storytelling. And I don't know, it's just, it was super thrilling and fun. And ever since then, I've just been really focused on thinking about how you can use these tools to tell stories, whether that's explicitly a story or just more conceptually putting people into a sense of alternative reality or alternative world, and letting them feel that experience, too, even if it's not explicitly a quote unquote story.
00:16:34.904 - 00:16:45.256, Speaker A: Yeah, that is one of my, one of the most interesting things about your work, actually, is from my perspective. I believe you've used the term visual novel, right?
00:16:45.360 - 00:17:00.124, Speaker B: I don't have a lot, which I really like, but I think you've memed it to yourself into existence, which I like, that I'm like, we should use that. Now I'm gonna. You're gonna tell people that I called you the art Oprah, and I'm gonna tell people you called me a visual novelist. So we're gonna.
00:17:01.314 - 00:17:29.124, Speaker A: I love it. You know what's funny about that? Because the first series I did with, like, oils, after I learned how to oil paint properly back in, like, 2011, it was called futures and options, and it was twelve paintings, and it was kind of like, I called it a visual novel. And then I just kind of let it go. I was only half done. I got six done. It took me three years to get six paintings done, and I was just like, this is a total failed business model here. But it kind of stuck.
00:17:29.124 - 00:17:37.980, Speaker A: But it's funny how when I see what you're doing, I mean, yeah, you're a visual novelist, the private eye stuff and everything. So I want to see, did you.
00:17:38.052 - 00:17:41.864, Speaker B: See your paintings, by the way? You should scan those and show people.
00:17:43.004 - 00:17:51.132, Speaker A: You know what? I will. Yeah, I'll see you. I'll make a note to myself. I'll make a note to myself tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll show some of the futures and options.
00:17:51.228 - 00:17:51.944, Speaker B: Boom.
00:17:53.704 - 00:18:27.244, Speaker A: Thank you for the idea and the inspiration. Clownvamp. So tell me, I'm curious, did you have artistic ambitions then, before AI? Because I think a lot of people, actually, I get the impression, and I could be wrong, but I think there's, like, a significant percentage, let's call it ten or 20%, of the artists on the blockchain. I sort of got the impression that a lot of people started just because in 2021, there's incredible bull run. There's money to be made. So maybe I can put some sketches together, especially if you're in a poor country. I mean, this was unbelievable money so.
00:18:27.244 - 00:18:38.584, Speaker A: And I don't think there's anything wrong with that either, by the way. I think that's actually really cool. Who knows how you stumble into these things? I'm curious about you. Like, did you. Did you go to art school, or was this kind of a late thing? And you're just like, let's try this.
00:18:39.044 - 00:19:03.274, Speaker B: Yeah. So my background comes to sort of arts and creativity is kind of fun, I guess. Middle school and high school was, like, really my sort of primary identity, outside of being a kid was being a photographer. So I was, like, obsessed with photography. You know, I, like, built a lighting studio in my basement. I focused on. I did a lot of.
00:19:03.274 - 00:19:46.254, Speaker B: I did a lot of portraits, band shots for, like, the emo and pop punk bands near where I grew up. Like, that was sort of my shtick. I would go to, like, concerts and festivals and take photos for, like, online signs and stuff. It was kind of a fun way also to go to free concerts, which was, like, a good hack. And so I was obsessed with photography, learned a lot about Photoshop and composition, all these things, and, you know, had a sort of flirtation with, do I want to go and be a professional photographer? And ultimately decided no. And so I sort of left the visual arts behind when I was, you know, 18, and then went on a sort of a crazy journey. Involves a lot of different things.
00:19:46.254 - 00:20:40.474, Speaker B: Eventually found writing as one of the things that I really love and started doing a lot of writing, both nonfiction and fiction and sort of the IRL world and sort of more known for non fiction writing. And I, you know, got really interested in storytelling, and I was trying to find ways to do more things in fiction. And. And that was around the same time that AI art sort of found me. And so when AI art came into my life, it was. I'd been exploring a lot of different ways to do more fictional storytelling, and it hit this sort of, like, it's like when you learn a language as a kid and then you go back, you know, it's like, I took Spanish in high school, and I don't know any Spanish, but if I go to Spain, I can kind of somehow, all of a sudden, I'm like, quiero. You know, like, I'm, like, speaking Spanish.
00:20:40.474 - 00:21:29.494, Speaker B: It's kind of a similar thing where there was, like, it was activating a bunch of these neurons that from photography of whether that's, like, curation, composition, color lighting, you know, white back, like, all these things which, you know, were deeply sort of ingrained. I spent, you know, hundreds and hundreds of hours on kind of put to the side. It brought them all back. And at the same time, it was hitting on this need I had to do to tell more fictional stories. And so there was this weird. I tell a lot of my friends who have known me for a long time that this is the most sort of self actualized thing I've ever done, where it's a lot of my interests compounding all into one all at the same time in a way that's just like, super bizarre. Like, if you, my friends, who knows? Like, I love tech, I love creativity, I love art, I love, like, exploring new things.
00:21:29.494 - 00:22:14.612, Speaker B: And so this was, like, perfectly built for me. And I think that's been true for a lot of the AI artists that I collect or I'm friends with is that a lot of people have come here through really different paths, right? Some are incredibly skilled traditional painters. Some have never picked up a paintbrush. Some are big fans of art, but never thought they could express themselves. And for whatever reason, this new sort of method of creation really spoke to them. And I think that's one of the things that's most exciting and liberating. And, you know, one thing I think that's really cool about it that I talk about a lot is, you know, you served are talking about also the way that, like, people all around the world sort of accessed nfts and all this stuff.
00:22:14.612 - 00:23:48.044, Speaker B: And, you know, a lot of the artists I collect are, you know, countries I've never visited, you know, would be very, very long plane rides to get to. And one of the things that seems to me at least, most exciting, I think when we look back at this moment in history, 30, 40 years from now, we're going to talk about the fact that air is going to be one of the most accessible, least gatekeep forms of art creation, right? Whether that's the fact that many of the tools are literally free, you don't need to have a super powerful computer because you can use Google, collab, and it's all in the cloud, so you don't even have to have a GPU, really, that's decent. And then the fact that the fact that it's this punk rock thing that a lot of traditional people maybe look down on has created a lot of space for non traditional people to sort of come in and take up some of that space while it's still sort of growing and there's still sort of room. So I'm really excited about the cultural significance of air as this, like, uber the world is flat art movement that you know, I think it's going to, when we look back on it, be quite striking. And I'm sure we're going to have, you know, a bunch of famous names that, you know, come from countries that are not in western Europe or North America. I think that's really exciting to me, too.
00:23:49.904 - 00:24:52.780, Speaker A: I totally agree. And it feels like, yeah, it's one of the hallmarks of this whole space is how truly international it is, and it's effortlessly international. It's not like these shows, you know, that happen in western cities where it's like, okay, let's put an effort in to include people here. It's just like, it's truly an international situation. And in a weird way, I mean, digital art, as many people have pointed out, has been happening at least for 50 years, but in a weird way, it's like that democratization that you're describing. It kind of feels like, in a weird way, it still feels like the start or another start of sorts. And again, this kind of, this punk rock aspect, I think that's a really great way of putting it, because even pixel art, for example, you don't necessarily need to have a very good hand at drawing to make pixel art.
00:24:52.780 - 00:25:11.614, Speaker A: And then this is the next. And pixel art's huge, and it's sort of like AI art. Those are almost two big categories that are really just kind of native to this space to a certain degree. And I feel like AI art's the same thing. Like you don't, you know, you don't need any training totally. You just need an eye.
00:25:11.654 - 00:25:11.950, Speaker B: Totally.
00:25:11.982 - 00:25:12.862, Speaker A: I mean, it's art.
00:25:12.958 - 00:26:25.214, Speaker B: And the thing I'm sort of interested in, I'm curious your thoughts, because I know you think a lot about this stuff is one thing that I'm playing around conceptually now, my art sort of going forward, and a lot of things I'm working on right now, but I'm also just thinking about is, as these models become more perfect, what does that do to air with a capital a? Does that mean that the creativity moves to these really down the line applications of these things, whether it's making movies or really complicated things that are empowered by AI, or does it mean that people in the same way, like glitch art, for example, people are doing a lot of glitch art with analog systems. Do people sort of stop in 2022 2021 era models and say, this is what air is, I'm going to use these models? I don't know. I'm curious what you think, because I've been wrestling with that a little bit, this sort of balance between taking the AI out of it and keeping the AI in, if that makes sense. And I feel like that's like a big, unsettled question.
00:26:26.864 - 00:26:36.088, Speaker A: I think it's a very interesting question. Like, when you say that, I think of the, you know, the classic, you know, fingers, seven fingers, for example.
00:26:36.176 - 00:26:36.804, Speaker B: Right?
00:26:37.264 - 00:27:17.604, Speaker A: Which one assumes, you know, in the net, it's already starting to disappear, but you still see it, you know? But, yeah, so it's an interesting question. I mean, so it almost comes down to, I think, the tools. There might be a shift in how they're used. I mean, what's interesting for me, just from a personal point of view, I was never overly excited with the results that I got from the imagine prompt. Speaking with midjourney, I tried and, you know, and I tried different things, and I got, you know, I had this bacchanal sort of one, a couple of bacchanal kind of pieces, you know, pastoral. I had, like, really drunk but bacchus figure. You know, I liked those.
00:27:17.604 - 00:27:39.708, Speaker A: But it was pretty. For all the prompts that I was. I got a lot that I wasn't. Wasn't particularly excited about. But once I discovered blend, that changed everything for me. Like, I mean, right now, what I'm really excited about is I take my art and I put it into blend and I go, oh, now I want to try this one. And then maybe I'll put four of them into blend.
00:27:39.708 - 00:28:04.654, Speaker A: Maybe I'll just put, you know, the same. Different versions of the same one into blender. So I wonder. I think there's. So, again, they're putting out new features practically every day here. I have a feeling that maybe the focus might shift from, like, now. I think there's, at least in the last year, let's say there's been a lot of excitement, one might say, with what I call these AI distortions.
00:28:04.814 - 00:28:05.134, Speaker B: Right?
00:28:05.174 - 00:28:31.114, Speaker A: Like seven fingers and all the almost the glitches, one might say, that are produced by AI art, I wonder, because now, and this kind of brings us back to your UFO. The brushstrokes are getting so persuasive. They're starting to. Frankly, they're starting to look more beautiful than what you see when you're in the Getty there looking at these 18th century paintings.
00:28:31.414 - 00:28:31.846, Speaker B: Right.
00:28:31.910 - 00:28:47.370, Speaker A: So can you speak about the brushstrokes a bit? Because you're doing this impressionist show. It seems to me, if I had to guess, that was, like, a big draw for you, because with the UFO impressionist piece and this kind of focus on texture, yeah, yeah, I definitely would.
00:28:47.402 - 00:29:37.932, Speaker B: Say, you know, sort of the piggyback off we were just talking about, like, you know, one of the ways in the recent few, you know, months, I've been exploring the fact that AI has become super powered. It's like, you know, okay, as it gets better and better, but let me, like, drive the Ferrari as hard as I can, essentially. And you, texture has been one of the ways of exploring that. And so I built, you know, I've always been really resolution, upscale focused. So even if you go to some of my earliest pieces, I've always spent a lot of energy trying to get them pretty high resolution because, you know, for those of you who haven't tried it yet, a lot of these models, you know, stable diffusion, you know, 1.5 will create a 512 by 512 stable diffusion XL, I think, is 1024 by 1024. Mid journey is a bit bigger, but none of it's that big.
00:29:37.932 - 00:30:21.326, Speaker B: And so getting the resolution higher and part of that is, for me, a texture thing and playing with these ideas of realness. And so, you know, I want you to be able to zoom in and look at it and be like, well, shit, this must be real, right? And like that, because it's not real. At least not real in the sense of, you know, there's, you know, a piece of wood or canvas somewhere that has it. And so. And so, yes, I basically, you know, will do a multi step process of upscaling that involves, you know, I use. I'll create my initial pieces of work and, you know, pretty much anything these days. It's been a lot of mid journey.
00:30:21.326 - 00:30:54.354, Speaker B: Then I bring it into stable diffusion. I use a lot of their tile workflows that basically split. Split up a piece in tiles and then re render each tile. And you can do that multiple times with multiple iterations, and there's all sorts of things you can do. Like, I add, I have a bunch of custom texture files that I've made that I can lay over an image in Photoshop. I turn multiply on, and I put that on and add sort of texture. I do that, then I run it through stable diffusion, and it takes those little details and sort of extrapolates them into more intricate details.
00:30:54.354 - 00:31:52.556, Speaker B: That's been one way that I've been reckoning with and dealing with these questions of, okay, as AI becomes more super powered, what does it mean to use air? And one of the ways I've been dealing with it is by trying to run the race car as hard as possible. But I don't know if that's sustainable because I think the race car is going to turn into a rocket ship pretty soon. I've been exploring gen two and these text to video models. You know, it's totally shocking. And fast forward a year, it's gonna be even more shocking. And so, I don't know, that's sort of one of those things where there's part of me, and this is maybe my personality, but I know a lot of people have served in a similar boat where there's part of me that says, okay, I wanna just take the rocket ship and go as hard as possible and create the most intricate, over the top AI details. And there's another part of me which wants to just, you know, make my use old models and create, you know, weird seven finger art.
00:31:52.556 - 00:32:00.304, Speaker B: And I think wrestling between those two modes is actually going to be a lot of fun, but that's how I've been dealing with it.
00:32:02.044 - 00:32:11.828, Speaker A: Absolutely fascinating. And I was going to ask you if you only use mid journey or other things. So you also use stable diffusion, but primarily mid journey, and I imagine you look at other stuff.
00:32:11.876 - 00:33:00.558, Speaker B: Yeah, I use all of it. So I would say, like, you know, I use. Recently I've been using midjourney, but then stable diffusion excel nine just came out, which is equally as good. And so I've been exploring that, and a lot of times, my workflow will look like I'll create something in mid journey, but it'll use image prompts, too, that were maybe originally created stable diffusion, where I like the textures, but not the image quality. And then I'll do a lot of inpainting with Dolly, or I'll use the stability plugin in Photoshop to do inpainting, and then I'll bring it to stable diffusion to upscale. So it's like, there isn't really, you know, there isn't, like, one tool I'm sitting in. You know, it'd be nice, but it kind of.
00:33:00.558 - 00:33:02.314, Speaker B: I was kind of, like, the chaos of it all.
00:33:03.534 - 00:33:12.392, Speaker A: Absolutely. Totally fascinating. And welcome rune tune, to the show. I guess roon tune had the plumber over. Richun, how you doing? I'm doing good. Sorry for the tardiness.
00:33:12.478 - 00:33:14.964, Speaker B: Yeah, when, uh, when plumbing calls.
00:33:15.004 - 00:33:17.836, Speaker A: Plumbing calls, um, there are no exceptions.
00:33:17.900 - 00:33:23.184, Speaker B: You get a fix, or are we still dealing with all good. Okay. Okay. I was worried there.
00:33:23.524 - 00:33:37.700, Speaker A: Yes, the leak has stopped. I did, uh, actually try and swing over to the oculus, uh, the other day. Unfortunately, the. The canvas gallery where your show was at was closed. I'm not sure. Is it still up?
00:33:37.732 - 00:34:01.244, Speaker B: So no, it was a one night only thing. There's a virtual version, though. Yeah, yeah, there's a virtual version. If you go in my pinned post, you can find the virtual version. But the canvas gallery is pretty cool. It's like this company that basically takes over vacant space and malls and turns them into all sorts of different experiences. And the one in New York has a partnership with super cheap and super rare and transient labs.
00:34:01.244 - 00:34:09.316, Speaker B: So there's sort of, like, rotating shows in there. So it's not like there's like one permanent show. But we had this, Matt, when I.
00:34:09.340 - 00:34:13.977, Speaker A: Walked by there and looked through the window, even though it was close, I could tell that it wasn't going to be the show.
00:34:14.025 - 00:34:21.473, Speaker B: Yeah. Of your work that I. Thank you for taking a look. I appreciate that. Oh, yeah, yeah.
00:34:21.593 - 00:34:32.233, Speaker A: No, I really wish that I could have been there on the 21st. I was out of town that day, but otherwise I would have done anything to be there because that sounded like it was such an incredible show.
00:34:32.273 - 00:34:39.334, Speaker B: Thanks. I appreciate that. It was really great. I felt very. I was like. I was happy and tired, which is a good. Good dual emotions to be.
00:34:39.334 - 00:34:40.970, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:34:41.042 - 00:34:58.490, Speaker A: Well, the production looked excellent. I mean, you really did a what looked like a pretty professional job, I guess. You and canvas three, putting all the booklets together, and it looked like there were title cards. Yeah, it did look very impressive. You had nice documentation. We could see everything that was going on.
00:34:58.522 - 00:35:19.214, Speaker B: Thanks. Yeah, I was trying to, like. You know, I think one of the areas I'm interested in playing with is these. And a lot of the art I've been collecting recently, even is these sort of things that cross dimensions. Right. So AI art that has a physical component. And, you know, for the Chester Charles show, the actual, you know, that opening party was part of the art.
00:35:19.214 - 00:35:39.622, Speaker B: Right. Like, people going there and having this sort of effect. You know, I had a couple people be like, wait, it's not real. You know, like, that. That was really important to me was this sort of alternative world, alternative thing. And to do that, you know, that meant, like, okay, let's have exhibit labels, let's have placards, let's have brochures. Let's play with those things.
00:35:39.622 - 00:35:42.958, Speaker B: They're not that hard to do. Right. But, like, you know, it's.
00:35:43.086 - 00:35:53.114, Speaker A: It's funny you say that, because even when you were, like, announcing it on Twitter, I understood that it was like a fictional story, but I had to look it up. Just.
00:35:53.414 - 00:35:56.554, Speaker B: Yeah, I had a bunch of people who told me it was that. Yeah.
00:36:00.164 - 00:36:13.372, Speaker A: Well, it's totally awesome. Can you tell us a little bit about the story. I mean, I haven't. Like, how do we even read it? Because it looks to me like this is multi chain. Like, I thought I saw a work on Tazos and went on, super. Is that right? Or am I. Yeah, you're right.
00:36:13.388 - 00:36:27.682, Speaker B: Yeah. If you go to. So if you go to my pinned post, there's a link to a cyber. On cyber gallery where you can walk through it. And each. All of the text is actually in the gallery. So each piece has this.
00:36:27.682 - 00:37:25.524, Speaker B: In the virtual gallery has the label. So basically, the story is that in 2021, there was this cache of lost art found that was hidden away because it was very gay. And the painter never achieved any sort of fame during his lifetime because he was painting and just sort of hiding it away because it was too queer for the time. It was not something that it would have been too much of a scandal. And so the story is that we found the art, and then this is a showing the art. In showing the art, I have an artist note in the front, but then everything else is sort of with a wink and a nod that this is real. So there's sort of a bio card, and then each piece comes with an exhibit label that has a curator's description, plus a recreation of an inscription that was, quote unquote, found on the back of the painting.
00:37:25.524 - 00:37:57.474, Speaker B: And the idea was that the story exists in a few dimensions. So the story exists in the dimension of the concept. Right. And the story exists in the dimension of the aesthetic and the art and the sort of aesthetic development of the artist over time. The story also exists in the dimension of the inscriptions. And so, you know, you could approach the show from just saying, I want to look at a couple pretty pictures. You could approach the show from saying, I want to, like, read every single word of all the stories.
00:37:57.474 - 00:38:12.824, Speaker B: And some people was really cool, like, on the virtual version of the 21st, like, went and read every single part of the story. And if you read all the stories, like, there was drama, there's love triangles, there's all sorts of. You know, I got up to some mischief. Um, and so are all of those.
00:38:12.864 - 00:38:16.484, Speaker A: Details still available on the. You said it's on cyber.
00:38:17.224 - 00:38:37.528, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So if you go to my pin post on that thread, there's a link to the. On cyber, and if you. You just walk up to any of the pieces, and to the right of each piece is the. The exhibit label that was also the same text that was found in the IRL show. Um, and so. And so, yeah, so it was a.
00:38:37.528 - 00:39:03.458, Speaker B: I'm trying, I was basically trying to take this, this sort of container of a career retrospective and use that format as a storytelling tool and all the sort of corresponding pieces that sort of come with that. Right. So that's why things like the brochure were important to me. One, because I just believe that physical shows should have physical artifacts. Like that's, I don't know, there's something about it. Like, I just. That's really important.
00:39:03.458 - 00:39:29.144, Speaker B: But I also just think there's something about like, you know, this concept of a show as a retro is like, we know what that sort of looks like and smells like. And because of that, you can sort of use that base to sort of fuck with people's heads and like, play with these ideas because. Because there's that like familiar baseline. You can then start to tweak it in like, interesting and sort of fun, mischievous ways. So.
00:39:30.484 - 00:39:39.900, Speaker A: Right, like you're using traditional gallery tools, like a booklet, the little white title cards, and you're saying, and here you have this kind of unconventional AI digital art show.
00:39:40.012 - 00:39:40.860, Speaker B: Is that what you're saying?
00:39:40.972 - 00:39:46.844, Speaker A: So it's kind of a way. Right. You're like recontextualizing, but like, you've substituted the content.
00:39:46.924 - 00:39:49.628, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah.
00:39:49.676 - 00:40:08.770, Speaker A: Fascinating. And so I guess a couple of comments. The first is, speaking of substitution, it's like, in terms of the content, it does seem like a brilliant substitution, your content there in a, in an impressionist sort of process.
00:40:08.962 - 00:40:09.362, Speaker B: Right.
00:40:09.418 - 00:40:33.232, Speaker A: Painting process. So the queer art show or the queer artist and subject matter hidden away and then putting it in a new context where, of course, back then it would have probably been hidden away. So that's quite interesting in itself. It seems like a nice fit. And as far as the. I'm also looking just at the. I'm curious about the production itself.
00:40:33.232 - 00:40:57.981, Speaker A: Just one more question on actually putting on this show. I see like pictures of nine by 16 screens in your header there on Twitter. Did you struggle with the ratios? I guess you knew ahead of time that you're going to work with screens, a nine by 16 ratio. But I assume it didn't look like to me on super rare that they're all nine by 16. How did you deal with. Great questions. Display.
00:40:57.981 - 00:41:31.154, Speaker B: Yeah, great question. So this has been an issue with a lot of not digital art shows. I think in the last couple years has been the fact that, you know, artists don't really want to create 16 by nine, but, you know, that's a lot of these screen. And so I had the lucky, you know, I'm based in New York. So, you know, I went to canvas three like the show was. You know, once we sort of knew we had a location for it, you know, to give context here, there's 23 pieces in the show. It started in the thousands.
00:41:31.154 - 00:41:59.654, Speaker B: And so, you know, I was able to curate down the show to sort of match that physical space. And so, you know, the show. The show has 23 pieces because there was 23 screens at canvas. Like, they're really meant to be sort of together. And, you know, the screens at canvas are primarily for vertical. They're primarily portrait. So that also impacted the show from the perspective of most of the stories are portraits.
00:41:59.654 - 00:42:30.766, Speaker B: And so as a result, I did a lot of character development. Like, if you read the inscriptions of the show, there's certain characters that reappear throughout because of that need. And a couple more. I don't know what the term would be, but establishing shots, so to say, of the story, you know, a lot of them had to be done in vertical because of. Because of that constraint, even though I would have preferred to have done them in sort of landscape. And so that that was fun for me, right. That.
00:42:30.766 - 00:43:11.668, Speaker B: That challenge. And, you know, I only had a few sort of, you know, landscape screens to play with, right. So I had to be really intentional about how to use those. And, you know, I also had, you know, a wall in canvas of, you know, these three screens that were big vertical screens right next to each other. And so I sort of thought about those three screens, the opportunity to do, like, sort of a grand portrait wall, because I think when you go to art museums, you have these, like, big portrait walls, these giant frames. And so I was sort of playing with those ideas. And so, yeah, so that was part of the fun of it, was knowing where it was going to show.
00:43:11.668 - 00:43:28.908, Speaker B: You know, we've been working on the show for a long time, so knowing where is going to show, you know, allowed me to, in doing this for final curation, make all that sort of line up in a way that was really fun. Would you ever go ahead.
00:43:28.956 - 00:43:39.204, Speaker A: Would you ever consider, you know, maybe putting on this show again somewhere totally, like, have you, like, approaching other galleries.
00:43:39.244 - 00:43:57.600, Speaker B: And seeing what they might have to offer? Yeah, no, totally. I definitely would be open to doing that. You know, it's like, it was sort of. It was. It was. It was meant to be experienced in this space, but it could definitely be reconfigured in other spaces, too. So, yeah, definitely.
00:43:57.672 - 00:43:59.112, Speaker A: I can imagine these.
00:43:59.288 - 00:44:03.080, Speaker B: These paintings, you know, actually framed.
00:44:03.192 - 00:44:06.792, Speaker A: Like, you take the digital screen and you actually frame it with one of those, like, really.
00:44:06.848 - 00:44:10.524, Speaker B: Yeah. Those antique, golden. Yeah. 19th century.
00:44:10.984 - 00:44:11.456, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:44:11.520 - 00:45:15.284, Speaker B: Antique gold frames. You're kind of. You're reading my mind a little bit. Not necessarily for this show, but in general, a lot of the things I'm playing with right now and some of the art I think you'll see me create over the next six to twelve months is just this sort of digital, physical, weird divide. And how do you play with those ideas and concepts? And, you know, I've been experimenting with different printers recently, trying to find, like, a printer, but, you know, part of me is like, okay, you know, should I be selling prints that maybe come with those big, gaudy gold frames or something? You know, like, I don't know. Like, I'm really fascinated by those ideas because one of my favorite things about AI art is the details and the ability to really, like, jam on the details and go really far and, you know, mess with people's heads and, you know, do that kind of stuff. Because to me, AI art is an incredibly, like, creative and tender activity, and I think people want to brush it aside with these sweeping statements.
00:45:15.284 - 00:45:38.670, Speaker B: Right? Like, oh, it's copying. Oh, it's theft. Oh, it's simplistic. Oh, it's push a button, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And to me, so there's something about a, the details and going really far in the details that makes it harder to push away. And then two is there's something about crossing the digital physical barrier divide, I don't know what to call it. That also makes it harder to push away.
00:45:38.670 - 00:46:00.564, Speaker B: Like, when you show someone a piece of AI art in person, even if it's on a screen, there's something about it that sort of makes them go, well, it's. Here, I see it. I guess it's real hard for me just to brush it away. I see it. Beautiful. And so that idea is really fun for me, something I want to just play with and explore a lot.
00:46:02.464 - 00:46:36.436, Speaker A: You know, it seems like with a lot of your work, I mean, you're playing with storytelling all the time. And something that I like is it's always this sort of, like, interplay between fact and fiction. Like, you already. You already pick subjects that are already, like, there's 1ft in both sides of things with this, like, Chester Charles thing. Like, you know, depending on the way you would choose to present that story and that show, it could be, you know, oh, the lost paintings of the grandmaster, you know, Chester Charles.
00:46:36.500 - 00:46:36.772, Speaker B: And.
00:46:36.828 - 00:46:43.036, Speaker A: And people don't know that this is a fictional thing until they get there and read about it and then, you.
00:46:43.060 - 00:46:44.980, Speaker B: Know, the earlier stuff that you were.
00:46:45.012 - 00:46:46.932, Speaker A: Working with, like, aliens and that type.
00:46:46.948 - 00:47:15.158, Speaker B: Of totally, you know, you know. Yeah. And I think there's part of me which is like, you know, yeah. There's like, you know those ads, right, where it's like, I don't know if you, for those of you in America, there's this cheap shoe store called Payless shoe store. Payless shoes did this famous ad where they, you know, put like, a fancy logo on an empty boutique and sold their $20 shoes for dollar 900 and filmed it and created an ad out of it. And, like, there's, to me, it's too much of a gotcha. You know, I would feel too bad about it.
00:47:15.158 - 00:47:34.054, Speaker B: I like that concept in general of making people question why we assume certain things and, you know, but it's too much of a gotcha for me. So conceptually, I like those ideas. I just, they seem a little like too. Maybe it's too mischievous for even a clown vampire. So.
00:47:36.394 - 00:48:06.106, Speaker A: Well, beautiful. And if anybody is out there, the time is moving fast. So especially AI artists come on stage and come hang out with Clownvamp and ask any questions you might have, technical or otherwise. Clownvamp is very clearly well versed and is a writer IRL, so can describe his thoughts very clearly. I found it super interesting what you're saying, how you enjoyed the challenge of going vertical. And it's almost something I see a lot. Like, I see it in my own work.
00:48:06.106 - 00:48:20.326, Speaker A: There's a bias towards the vertical in digital art these days, I'd argue, because we're, you know, you make a big, wide landscape. I mean, people are looking on their phone half the time. It doesn't really work that well on a phone.
00:48:20.430 - 00:48:20.766, Speaker B: And.
00:48:20.830 - 00:48:27.430, Speaker A: But it also kind of makes horizontal works or landscape works kind of special in a weird sort of way.
00:48:27.462 - 00:48:41.034, Speaker B: No, I totally know what you're saying. Yeah. And then there's square, which feels like perfect, like, feels like the sort of norm. And there's all these weird ways in which this sort of constraints of our viewing impacts the art. It's really, it's actually quite interesting.
00:48:41.764 - 00:48:56.636, Speaker A: It's totally, I mean, I made this peloponnesian war series, actually, which hopefully will go on ordinals shortly. Let's see how that goes. But I made it all four by five because that was Instagram's ratio.
00:48:56.740 - 00:48:58.156, Speaker B: Yeah. Yeah.
00:48:58.180 - 00:49:15.118, Speaker A: Because I was like, this is, at the time I didn't know anything about. There were barely nfts. There weren't nfts when I started that thing and then. So it was basically you put your digital art on Instagram, cross your fingers and hope you get 100 likes, and off you go. Right. So it is interesting. Yeah, it's something.
00:49:15.118 - 00:49:19.486, Speaker A: And even now, I still have that bias because half the time I'm working on the phone.
00:49:19.630 - 00:49:19.958, Speaker B: Right.
00:49:20.006 - 00:49:34.790, Speaker A: So it's not like you're wanting to make big horizontal work on your phone. Speaking of the phone, like, I use discord on my phone and I love it because I can go make AI art like I was this morning. It's like you go anywhere.
00:49:34.862 - 00:49:35.238, Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
00:49:35.286 - 00:49:39.344, Speaker A: Waiting at the gym for the class to start. Do you use your phone primarily?
00:49:39.804 - 00:50:04.954, Speaker B: I am. I use all the above, so I will. So I have, like, a big screen in the studio where I work. That's, you know, it's sort of my happiest place to work. But then I have an iPad and a smartphone, and I actually love the iPad and the Discord app for creating art. So, like, I'll go to a cafe and I, like. It's a bit bigger than the phone that's tactile.
00:50:04.954 - 00:50:36.186, Speaker B: Like, I'm touching the buttons. There's something about it that's kind of fun. But then I'll have a prompt that I'm jamming on that is generally sort of where I want it to be and maybe I'll be on. Yesterday I was on subway, and I was just, like, rerolling and editing and tweaking and so, yeah, I mean, I use it all the above. I definitely have been the guy at the gym who's, like, lingering on a workout machine because I'm, like, rerolling my prompt, which is some, like, real nerdy shit.
00:50:36.250 - 00:50:47.130, Speaker A: You know, I laugh because, like, I'm literally. I do gym classes because I wouldn't do any exercise otherwise. And literally waiting for the class to start this morning. There I am. Okay.
00:50:47.242 - 00:50:48.282, Speaker B: Yeah, one more time.
00:50:48.378 - 00:51:04.964, Speaker A: Upload image. Yeah. Hilarious. And kind of a technical question. We kind of touched on, you know, the different kinds of prompting earlier with, like, imagine and blend. Do you, like, defer? Like, is there any, like, where do you normally start? Do you start with imagine?
00:51:05.154 - 00:51:39.424, Speaker B: It just depends, I would say. So, you know, for example, for. So I have this series called Detective Jack, which is a choose your own adventure series on tezos, which is. I called Barbie noir. So it's sort of a noir illustration aesthetic, but very pink and very sort of americana and sort of playing with some ideas there. And, you know, for that, for example, you know, for the second season of it, because it's a month long. It's a month long sort of interactive adventure.
00:51:39.424 - 00:52:40.300, Speaker B: I used images from the first season as image prompts for the art from the second season, but mid journey had gotten so much further than the first season. I made on stable diffusion that I was able to, like, create things that were much more coherent and aesthetic. But I use the colors and textures and sort of, like, vibe from the first, so it really depends. With the Chester Charles show, I used primarily no image prompts. It was primarily just text prompts and pretty convoluted text prompts because I had to mature and change the aesthetic development over time. So I kind of needed to, like, add and subtract quite a bit and, you know, bring in different artists influences. And then, you know, mid journey has this, you know, desire when you do stuff outside of photos.
00:52:40.300 - 00:53:06.684, Speaker B: I find to sort of make everything sort of, you know, tries to bring stuff into the. The mean, I guess. And so, you know, there's things you do for that, like style, raw style, zero. Now they have, like, a weirdness thing. But the thing that I always found was most effective is using. You can have weighted text prompts. You can have multiple text prompts that you wait differently, which is probably the most powerful but underused feature in midjourney.
00:53:06.684 - 00:54:05.368, Speaker B: And so I would then also, I would have certain aesthetic descriptions that I would then use as multi prompts, that I would weight the different prompts differently, and I would maybe even change those a little bit over time to sort of reflect that, like, aesthetic development. So again, it all, like, kind of depends. And, you know, someone once said, this wasn't me, but someone once described, you know, air tools as sort of, like, different synthesizers. If you were making, like, electronic keyboard music where they all sort of do different things, you know, they work differently. They all sort of, you know, explicitly, you know, you hit a note and that note comes out, but there's so much variation between them and how you manipulate them. And so for me, that's part of the puzzle, and part of what I enjoy is usually I'm starting with a visual image in my head, and then I'm trying to work towards that. And that process of working towards it is really fun.
00:54:05.368 - 00:54:35.024, Speaker B: It's very meditative. But then also the response I'm getting from the system acts as a piece of feedback into that. And so it'll push me in certain ways, or it might, like, randomly, this happened to me the other day. It randomly brought up this idea that I was not expecting, and it sparked a whole bunch of other thoughts and pursuits and new visual images that I then was chasing down. And so that, like, meanderingness of it all is, like, so much of the fun.
00:54:36.244 - 00:54:39.996, Speaker A: I mean, you totally see how it feels infinite.
00:54:40.100 - 00:54:41.788, Speaker B: Yeah, right?
00:54:41.836 - 00:55:05.624, Speaker A: Like, I mean, I feel like AI really brings out that, you know, sense that really, like, with all the images that have been made so far, it's like, weirdly, it feels like we're only scratching the surface when you're making, you know, you probably have, like, a thousand or more, maybe thousands of, you know, impressionist paintings that are kind of convincing.
00:55:05.704 - 00:55:06.064, Speaker B: Totally.
00:55:06.104 - 00:55:19.400, Speaker A: You know, as your Degas, you know, ballerina work is, your ballet work is, you know, it's a fairly convincing work. And here you're probably sitting on thousands of, like, unmade impressionist paintings.
00:55:19.552 - 00:56:11.106, Speaker B: Yeah, it's funny, I use Adobe Bridge to organize everything, and, you know, there's something about your mind's eye that gets, you know, overly familiar or fatigued. And one of the things that's been really joyful for me now, you know, is looking back at some of the, like, the discards from a year ago, and, you know, revisiting those is a whole new appreciation perspective of them. And it's been really fun. And there's all sorts of things I'm like, wow, I really should have minted that. Or, you know, I wonder if I'll ever have an opportunity to use that. And, yeah, and so there's definitely some weirdness there around, you know, my explorations of a latent space and what sticks out to you with a curator's eye at present and then, you know, in the future and, yeah, I don't know. That's gonna be a whole thing.
00:56:11.106 - 00:56:31.844, Speaker B: I mean, think about, like, someone like Claire Silver, who has been doing this for so long, you know, is so successful at. It must have so many, you know, sort of extras, right? Like b sides and, you know, what, is she gonna mint those one day? Will it be like a b side collection? You know, what even is a b side? You know, I don't know. It's kind of fun.
00:56:32.864 - 00:57:04.716, Speaker A: Well, I love Claire Silver's take that, really, with AI, art taste is your only limitation. And I totally agree with her. It's like, that's what's so crazy about it with Ar. So a couple of quick questions here as well, just on the minting side of things. Why did you decide to go multi chain? Because my sort of instinct would have been, oh, why don't you just put it all on super rare and this sort of thing?
00:57:04.780 - 00:57:05.220, Speaker B: Right?
00:57:05.332 - 00:57:08.388, Speaker A: Yeah. Tell me about the thinking behind that.
00:57:08.516 - 00:58:20.452, Speaker B: So it's a few things. So for context, the show is a series of one on ones, super rare, and then there's two open editions, one on tezos and one on eat. And I think, like, I really like people being able to be involved. Like, I think part of coming to this with a collector's mindset is I think I have a sort of empathy, appreciation love of collecting that, you know, I'm like, you know, even when there's something that's maybe, you know, I don't know, it's like, you know, the one of ones, you know, sell for, you know, like, to eat and, like, it's, like, not accessible to most people, but you still want to be, like, a part of it and you want to, like, whether, you know, you want to build your collection and have things. And so for me, having the open edition is a cool way of building that community and, like, having people be able to be a part of it. And so I'm definitely a super, like, sort of OCD about, like, you know, contract hygiene and all that stuff. And so there's a part of me which would.
00:58:20.452 - 00:59:06.534, Speaker B: Yeah, I'd love to have it all in one contract. That's the only place it is. But the part of me that wants people to be able to, like, touch and feel and be a part of something sort of won out. And I think luckily, deca and a bunch of other tools have sort of made that multi chain issue, I think, less of an issue. And so, like, I'm working on, you know, my deka artist profile and bringing everything into one place. And so, so, yeah, so you're scratching on an anxiety of mine because I also. I'm very, like, you know, like, how can I not have, like, 30 different contracts? But I think it's important to, you know, create ways for people to access art that are, you know, super expensive and all that kind of stuff.
00:59:07.074 - 00:59:14.092, Speaker A: Well, it's back to that whole idea that it's a. It's a feature, not a bug, that art on tazos is so cheap. Totally.
00:59:14.148 - 00:59:15.340, Speaker B: Like, I mean, right.
00:59:15.372 - 00:59:35.276, Speaker A: I mean, and you know that as a collector, like, I. Again, I, you know, I would have. I probably would have, like, two rjs. And in that first work, I collected way back when, like, I'd probably have three artworks in my collection if I. If it was only on ETH, so. But luckily, with Tazos, yeah, that's a completely different story, and it may not stay like that forever.
00:59:35.380 - 00:59:42.172, Speaker B: Yeah, we might add. Yeah, I mean, obviously also, Tezos at dollar five is a lot more expensive of chain than it is right now. Right. So.
00:59:42.308 - 00:59:49.524, Speaker A: Well, it's a complete different story all of a sudden. Selling for one tezos for your edition of 20 is not such a terrible day.
00:59:49.604 - 01:00:02.664, Speaker B: Yeah, right. Like, so I hope it goes back up soon, because I get a little worried about some. Some, you know, my friends and stuff, but. Yeah, yeah. Tezo sub dollar is not what we need.
01:00:03.564 - 01:00:38.514, Speaker A: Yeah. But a huge opportunity, perhaps. Perhaps as long as. Yeah, perhaps if it doesn't go to. We shall see. And also, just on the book front you're mentioning, I guess the first thing is, were you happy with the prints that you were seeing? Because I think it would be quite a challenging thing to make a persuasive print of AI, but I do think it's possible, and I think I may have seen one or two on Twitter that I went like, oh, that looks really convincing. I can't remember the artist was Lily illo or someone else.
01:00:38.514 - 01:00:45.144, Speaker A: How's your experience with just trying to print stuff out? Have you been satisfied with what you're achieving there?
01:00:45.964 - 01:00:46.804, Speaker B: Stay tuned.
01:00:46.884 - 01:00:47.364, Speaker A: Stay tuned.
01:00:47.404 - 01:00:54.824, Speaker B: Not yet, but we're getting there. We're working in progress. Yeah, good question. We'll circle back in our six month reunion tour.
01:00:55.884 - 01:01:14.720, Speaker A: Good. And just finally, on another front, I think we lost Corinthian. He maybe had to get back to whatever's going on with the plumber. I hope. Everything okay there? Just in terms of. You mentioned that in real life, you are a writer of nonfiction. You're flirting with fiction.
01:01:14.720 - 01:01:22.000, Speaker A: Do you plan to turn any of these visual novels? Do you kind of conceptualize a book? I imagine you must have thought of this.
01:01:22.152 - 01:01:56.348, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm super interested in, like, different ways to explore these stories and, you know. Yeah. Like, books are one of them. I don't know. I've been playing with Runway ML, and, like, I should do a movie, you know, so I'm exploring sort of all of it. Part of me, there's sort of a tension between using traditional, you know, using these traditional storytelling mediums and bring AI into it in a way that's sort of fun and exciting. Right.
01:01:56.348 - 01:03:11.308, Speaker B: And there's part of me which wants to just stick with, okay, well, what's like a new way to do it? Like, what's an interactive way to do it? What's. You know, what's something that's native to AI? So I did this piece last year that I'll pin that I was really proud of that I think is an example of this and something where I'm like, okay, how do I sort of do more things like this? But this was a piece I did for the scope art fair where I recently gone and seen a Diane Arbus exhibit. And, you know, she does all these amazing, you know, photos of, you know, people who are sort of outside the normal bounds of society. And she has these photos of early, you know, drag performers in the fifties and sixties. And, you know, it's interesting is because, you know, Diane Arbus is sort of, you know, beloved by a lot of people, myself included. But there's a lot of people who sort of worry that, was she taking advantage of people? Was she, you know, how does, you know, how did the people in the photos actually feel? A lot of that's lost to history. And so I had this idea of, well, you know, you could explore these emotions, right? You don't have to answer these emotions.
01:03:11.308 - 01:03:50.856, Speaker B: You can explore them using AI. And so with this piece I created using Dolly, a retired, called the retired royalty. It's one of the drag performers from the sixties. Now, as a, you know, a person in their eighties. And then I created a GPT prompt that every time you ran, it gave you an interview transcript with that person talking about their experience of being in the, being in that famous photo. But every time you ran, it gave a different answer. And so the idea is that it's to bring alive these questions, like, okay, well, how did they feel and what are the different ways they might have felt and, and exploring these sort of things.
01:03:50.856 - 01:04:26.574, Speaker B: And so this, for me, was really fun because obviously it's like playing with timelines and art history and all these things I really enjoy. But it's also a type of storytelling that is native to AI in a way, you know, an infinitely reusable interview transcript isn't really something that you can normally do. And so, and so I'm also sort of, I don't know. So there's a tension there for me between wanting to, like, create new AI native ways of storytelling and then wanting to bring AI into traditional formats. And probably the answer is just, I'll do both. So we'll see.
01:04:27.674 - 01:04:36.054, Speaker A: Fascinating. And before I pass it on to roon tune, actually, I have a couple of just tiny questions. First, do you use chat GPT at all for your prompting?
01:04:36.914 - 01:05:05.294, Speaker B: Not for my prompting, but I am working on a project right now that has a heavy use of chat GPT, and I don't want to alpha leak myself too much, so I'll leave it at that. But I haven't done a lot yet other than this one project here, where this isn't chat GPT, this is the GPT complete API. But I have ideas that I'm exploring for how to do more storytelling using GPT text.
01:05:06.234 - 01:05:17.826, Speaker A: Well, this may have previewed my next question, which was, what is next? But don't only tell. And maybe you've already said what you want to say, but where are you going next?
01:05:17.890 - 01:06:21.398, Speaker B: I think a lot of where I'm going next is basically, I think there's like a few different tensions I'm playing with. So one is this tension I referred to around like the AI perfection versus AI artifact sort of tension and how far to go on the perfect first AI iness of it all. So that's one. And then the second is sort of hyper related. But, you know, doing storytelling that is sort of new to native to AI and something you can never do before, and then doing storytelling that's bringing AI into traditional format. So I think those two, you know, maybe there's, maybe those are like x y axes that overlap and maybe it's a grid or something, right? But like, those tensions are what I'm playing with and exploring and going to do stuff all across those spectrums and sort of have fun with it. And, you know, maybe, maybe the answer is just even taking traditional formats and remixing them into like, new AI native ways that could never have been done before.
01:06:21.398 - 01:06:39.754, Speaker B: I don't know. You know, like, so a lot of stuff I'm exploring is around there and mostly working on a few really big shows and then, you know, working on more pieces of, um, the truth and, you know, a new detective Jack series and, you know, continuing some of those stories, too.
01:06:40.814 - 01:06:48.830, Speaker A: Amazing. Well, it sounds fascinating and exciting, and it sounds like you have a lot going on runetune. Do you have any other questions for clone?
01:06:48.862 - 01:06:52.390, Speaker B: Van I guess, you know, I don't.
01:06:52.422 - 01:06:55.094, Speaker A: Use AI tools quite as much as.
01:06:55.134 - 01:07:01.250, Speaker B: You do, I'm sure. But what are, like, some of the biggest struggles you have when you use those tools?
01:07:01.282 - 01:07:03.226, Speaker A: Like for me, I mean, I mostly.
01:07:03.250 - 01:07:09.746, Speaker B: I just use chat GPT but it always, it always struggles to meet me.
01:07:09.770 - 01:07:11.058, Speaker A: Where I need it to meet me.
01:07:11.146 - 01:07:16.346, Speaker B: When it comes to creating humor, there's.
01:07:16.370 - 01:07:18.082, Speaker A: A couple concepts that I think are.
01:07:18.098 - 01:07:19.970, Speaker B: Really funny that I explore with chat.
01:07:20.002 - 01:07:23.706, Speaker A: GPT and it could never it's great at analyzing.
01:07:23.770 - 01:07:25.802, Speaker B: Like, when I tell it why something.
01:07:25.858 - 01:07:27.282, Speaker A: Is funny, it's like, oh, yeah, and.
01:07:27.298 - 01:07:31.022, Speaker B: It'Ll just like break it down and have no problem at all. But when it has to come up.
01:07:31.038 - 01:07:33.710, Speaker A: With its own thing, it gets a little bit too.
01:07:33.862 - 01:08:19.274, Speaker B: It just it never it never lands on the mark. That's. Yeah, I would say one of the reasons I haven't used it for a lot of creative writing things yet is that I think it doesn't, it has this sort of amorphous professorial thesaurus tone that doesn't really work well with creative writing. And if you know how check GPT works, you know, basically the two things to understand are someone, a professor actually explained it to me this way, which I really loved, which is, you know, it's, it's like shouting to a crowd of people. You know, the man went out to walk his. And then, you know, 90% of people would respond dog, maybe 99% would respond dog. But then, you know, occasionally it's not a dog.
01:08:19.274 - 01:09:15.611, Speaker B: Like, there's some kooky people out there walking their cats in rabbit. And so GPT models have this concept of a temperature, which is basically in order to not have it become too repetitive, because oftentimes those prediction tasks are kind of obvious in their answer. They have this factor called the temperature, which basically adds a degree of randomness to it. And so maybe instead of saying dog, it would say puppy or cute dog, because it uses a probabilistic model of what are the most likely things. And so if dog was number one, but number two is puppy, or number three is maybe a breed of dog, it's beagle. And that randomness thing is like a really quirky concept intellectually because, you know, sometimes when you're writing a sentence, you would use a lot of randomness, and sometimes you wouldn't. But chat GPT is always using a lot of randomness.
01:09:15.611 - 01:10:14.534, Speaker B: And so you can not in chat GPT, but in the GPT APIs, you can mess with that variable a bit. But in general, the issue that it introduces is that you get this sort of thesaurus, heavy forced randomness. So it's both very formal and has a lot of word variety that is just not how people usually write. And so I think they need to figure out how to fix that and how to. And anyway, but it's all to sort of say that, you know, these technologies are super emerging, and, you know, there's sort of weird quirks in them that right now, you know, you can really use chap GPT really well to cheat on your homework because, you know, it sort of writes like a college student who thinks that the soar is sort of heavy, but it's hard to write the next great american novel with it. But that's probably going to change, which is kind of crazy. Very well said.
01:10:16.074 - 01:10:38.618, Speaker A: Yeah, and I've totally noticed that. Like, I mean, if you just use chat GPT and you say improve this text, I mean, it totally overwrites the whole thing, right, where it's like. And you could, you could detect it. I'm sure if you use chat GPT, you'll see it. It's almost absurd, right? Yeah, totally. Which is kind of interesting. You start to see the limitations of this incredible, uh, technology.
01:10:38.618 - 01:10:45.418, Speaker A: To your point, it's almost like an AI distortion of sorts, like we see with the fingers but in text, interestingly.
01:10:45.546 - 01:10:47.054, Speaker B: Yeah, that's a good point.
01:10:47.674 - 01:11:00.418, Speaker A: As we close here, then as we wrap up, uh, here, clownvap, do you have any, uh, final thoughts or thoughts? You have a lot of artists here and everything. What do you want people to know about you, your art and AI? Whatever you like.
01:11:00.506 - 01:12:07.186, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, I still think, you know, AI art is sort of one of the bright spots in this crazy NfT bear market. And, you know, I think I'm incredibly, as a collector, incredibly optimistic about AI art's future. And you definitely just encourage everyone to, you know, to the degree they can stick to it. I think that, you know, if you look at what's happened over the last year and you look at the excitement around AI and there's sort of general population, I mean, that's only going to further, you know, it's only going to get more amplified. And I think as it gets more amplified, I think AI art as the sort of corresponding art movement is going to be, you know, become something that's even more on people's tongues. And so I just think you're all doing something that's incredibly important. It's historic, it's, I think it's what people, you know, spend their careers dreaming of being in a moment in time where the sort of cultural moment is meeting an art moment and, you know, they're able to be a part of it.
01:12:07.186 - 01:12:19.814, Speaker B: And so I just, yeah, I encourage everyone to just, you know, keep creating. And I know it's a super hard time and, you know, but even if it's slowing down, just, you know, encourage everyone not to stop if they can avoid it.
01:12:20.994 - 01:12:40.624, Speaker A: Beautifully put. And I think that's profound what you're saying. And I feel like that just in the digital art space space, in the NFT art space in general, that we're so lucky to be a part of something that feels like an art movement is happening in our while we're here, while we're present, and it's accessible to everybody.
01:12:40.704 - 01:12:41.040, Speaker B: Totally.
01:12:41.072 - 01:12:53.084, Speaker A: I mean, it's really. And that in itself makes it historic no matter what. Totally. Just by default. So profound words to end on and runtune. Do you have any final thoughts?
01:12:54.004 - 01:12:59.588, Speaker B: I think you're very right when you say we all hope to be in.
01:12:59.636 - 01:13:04.828, Speaker A: Those sorts of intersections of art history and stuff.
01:13:04.876 - 01:13:42.386, Speaker B: And I think you're doing just that. And I think that Chester Charles show was a great use case for AI to kind of reclaim an untold history in a creatively fictitious way. Thank you. That's really sweet. It was like, it was all. It was like a really fun, all my interest in one. And if any of you ever come over my apartment, I have this giant stack of gay history books and gay coffee table, like gay art coffee table books on my coffee table.
01:13:42.386 - 01:14:01.444, Speaker B: And so it's just a lot of my interests in one, so it's really. Yeah, I felt really like a big, warm hug that people enjoy the show and. Yeah, so I'm really grateful and appreciate you guys having me on. Someone tweeted that I sound like in my garage. I'm sorry about that. I have. I have kind of.
01:14:01.444 - 01:14:07.504, Speaker B: I do have concrete floors in here and need to get some. Get a rug or something. So good. Good point.
01:14:08.564 - 01:14:25.094, Speaker A: All good. I almost thought it was a voice transformer when you started, but I was like, no, yeah, no, but all good. And thank you so much, clown vamp. That was absolutely fascinating. And thank you for sharing a lot of what you do. I mean, share a lot of your trade secrets here. And it is totally appreciated.
01:14:25.754 - 01:14:36.334, Speaker B: Anytime the art Oprah wants to invite me on this show, you know I'm here for it. And rune tune, you missed it. But I named Pokebelly the art Oprah. And so now we need to add into existence.
01:14:37.754 - 01:14:55.714, Speaker A: Well, I was about to say come back, so we're definitely going to have to do this. And I want to see that library in New York the next time I visit there.
