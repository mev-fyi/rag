00:00:03.200 - 00:00:24.974, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody. There is a new mic in the studio, so I hope it sounds good and I hope, I hope very much it doesn't fritz out like the last mic was on a regular basis. So welcome back. There's also the Pixel network first draft version, so that is exciting. Edmarolla has posted and an accompanying NFT. I mean, just too cool. We're gonna look at it.
00:00:24.974 - 00:00:59.648, Speaker A: Artist journal, October 3, 2023. Broadcasting from the high seas, the imagination, which are pixelated. I see pixelated waves and pixelated sunlight on the water here. Amazingly, it just appeared in my head as I speak to you here today. Welcome back. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and bosque gracias again, tight schedule, so we're going to move quick, and it should be a shorter show than the hour and six minutes of yesterday. Incredibly, as I looked at that, so bosque grazias.
00:00:59.648 - 00:01:21.364, Speaker A: And this was one of those works. As I was preparing the show, I kept moving it back to the middle of the, you know, collection. I kept moving it back to, oh, that's usually where I put the physical works kind of near the end by the AI, and it just kept on popping back up. And then I'd be like, no, you know, I can. And it just kept popping back up. This work here. And there's something.
00:01:21.364 - 00:02:03.264, Speaker A: What is it for me that works on this? It's a couple of things. And for me personally, why I'm kind of so fascinated by this series by Bosca Gracias out of Argentina is because I'm not a huge photography guy. I've never been a huge photography guy. I find pictures interesting, but I've always been kind of this, you know, unlimited potentiality, power, and possibility. Dunamis to say, the Greek of the. The canvas, the blank canvas where you can juxtapose any two ideas. So photography has always been kind of an interesting area, but it's never been, like, my favorite.
00:02:03.264 - 00:02:44.334, Speaker A: I've never even had the desire to be a photographer. I take pictures for fun, so it's interesting. But these works here, there's something incredibly gorgeous, and I guess it's the way that they're treated. I mean, the first thing that hits me is on the reptilian level, these beautiful kind of faded colors and the contrasts. We're back to this kind of underlying. I guess you'd call that like a light desk, right? With the negatives on top. Zooming in, by the way, as you can see, like, these are small negatives here, but you zoom in, and so they are magnified.
00:02:44.334 - 00:03:27.884, Speaker A: And I assume but I'm not positive that these images are actually a part of the negatives, but maybe they're not. Maybe this is one large construction here. I think bossu actually has some explanations here in the descriptions. But I'd have to say, first of all, the color and white is a very interesting color. Like, if you go to, you know, I remember being at the Guggenheim and just being kind of, there's a time for about six months where white and paintings just seem to look so beautiful. And it does here as well. Like, it just has a white's a weird color in painting, and it's just got a weird kind of power.
00:03:27.884 - 00:04:03.870, Speaker A: And I see it here. There's something about it, and I don't even know what it is. So just kind of interesting in that respect, the color also in the contrast of this kind of what looks like a 1970s photo. Again, maybe I'm in Sicily already, where I'm heading in a few weeks here, and I'm going to Rome, too. And so. But this kind of looks like some ruin out of Sicily. You see, remember we were talking about the corinthian columns? This is, I believe, the capital here, you'd say, at the top of the column, and then you have the corinthian leaves here.
00:04:03.870 - 00:04:37.586, Speaker A: And so who knows where this is? But it looks like, you know, as you can see, the greek or maybe Roman, this looks like Trajan Font. So this is probably Rome, ancient Rome. And actually, even seeing these columns, these are, I think these are. This is roman. You see the roman arch here. But all to say, this looks. I love the color, the faded kind of what looks like a 1970s photograph with, contrasting with this monochromatic red color here on this photograph of.
00:04:37.586 - 00:05:37.434, Speaker A: Maybe it's the archaeologist, maybe something completely unrelated. I think it's the juxtaposition and these wonderful, just, like, details here. You see how they're just kind of placed semi randomly or just kind of loosely placed, shall we say, these negatives on top of this light desk, you know? And there's something kind of Rauschenbergian about this, isn't there? Robert Rauschenberg. I just saw a great Robert Rauschenberg by surprise at Hamburger Banoff here, which is one of the main galleries or museums, I should say, contemporary art museum in Berlin. And one of Robert Rauschenberg's things was to do screen print an image, put this on a screen print, and then you do it all in one color. Right? So there's something kind of Rauschenbergian about this kind of red monochromatic color. And again, just the kind of looseness about it, but entirely bosque.
00:05:37.434 - 00:06:04.310, Speaker A: Grazias own. And again, not just sticking with the painting and the. Maybe the person, as we've seen before, but actually trying, like always trying something different here within the context of this series. And that really shows boldness, like. And that's something I really appreciate. It's not a one trick pony. It is trying different things out.
00:06:04.310 - 00:06:36.392, Speaker A: It is experimenting and having fun and further experimenting successfully, as I'd argue we see here. So just interesting piece. Harvest yellow between the grass, the normal wild grass. Interesting title. So let's just see what the three tazos, by the way, I picked one up, so there's one left. A nice low edition of five, a series made from slides found in a shed. They proposed a meeting reformulating the possibilities of the format.
00:06:36.392 - 00:07:32.376, Speaker A: They are cut with bisturi and accommodated on the scanner deck. They do not fit into the frame of traditional slides, so they can no longer be projected analogically. NFT is the only technology that solves the possibility of exposing them. So just beautiful. And isn't that great how, like, digital is the format that this all works in the best? And it kind of brings up a very important, often kind of, you know, glossed over notion, including, in my own mind, the power of zoom, of zooming in and of magnifying. And I think we see it here now, this did. You could do it with screen printing before, and Warhol used it to magnificent effect, you could argue to a certain degree, Rauschenberg as well, you know, magnification, you know, where.
00:07:32.376 - 00:07:59.002, Speaker A: Remember Warhol's massive Mao? That, like, it's like the size of, like, a building, that painting, if you've ever seen it. I think I saw that at Hamburger Banoff, too, a few years ago. Warhol's Mao. There's a version that's just incredible. Like, you know, several, like ten or 20 meters by 10 meters. Like, it's massive and so zooming in. So it did exist pre digital, but it's so much easier.
00:07:59.002 - 00:08:42.043, Speaker A: And even when we're working on, say, an iPad, we're constantly zooming in on a phone, even because people say, oh, how can you make anything on a phone? Well, I can zoom in way more than I can with the paintbrush. So back to this idea of the different ways of making things that a different creative process of painting in a digital context. So it's easy to take for granted, is what I'm saying here, at how big this is, I guess, is my point. Perhaps a subtle point and perhaps let me know if anybody has any thoughts on this notion. Rural tradition. So there are a couple of more. So going back to the painting here, but not just taking, you know, a dark painting.
00:08:42.043 - 00:09:09.758, Speaker A: And I wonder, maybe this was from a museum. Like, maybe this is also from slides that bosque grazias found. And then maybe bosque grazias is coloring these. I'm not exactly sure. Like, maybe I think these are from a museum, maybe. And these are being. So maybe it's a simple cut and paste, copy and paste or placement sort of thing, but I'm sure there's a little bit more to it than that.
00:09:09.758 - 00:09:34.150, Speaker A: Those are the sources, though. Like, this is probably in color, and then probably bosque gratia's colored this all monochromatic red. So another pretty beautiful work here. And I just love this stuff. I'm such a huge fan of, like, backwards or upside down writing. Again, it's got that freedom of a Rauschenberg that I just love. Maybe I should pick this one up, too.
00:09:34.150 - 00:10:43.472, Speaker A: There are two left, nice low additions from bosque Grazias here. And there's one more, which, again, is a testament to the experimentation here, not just going with whatever has worked before and iterating to, you know, a million times over. Find me in the arcade. Interesting title here, of course, arcade, you know, is a place for video games, but it's also, I believe, the, you know, in old kind of european towns, when you see these roman arches across, that, I believe, is also an arcade, I believe. And so we kind of see it here with the school of Athens by Raphael kind of broken apart a little bit, kind of, you know, cut apart a little bit here. And again, these are probably from the slides that were found in this shed, because this all looks like pre restored. I don't know if I assume they restored the school of Athens at one point, too, because when you see it now in the Vatican, and if you've never seen this, the stanzi of Raffaello, the Raphael's four rooms there in the Vatican, if you've never seen that, you have to go.
00:10:43.472 - 00:11:21.710, Speaker A: You simply have to go. It is like, required consuming if you are in the arts, I would argue. So find a way. And Rome itself, it used to be part of a tour in the 18th century that all the, you know, up and, you know, the people that went to, you know, schools and, you know, all the intellectuals, the writers, they had to do their little trip to Rome as part of the grand tour, I think they called it. We should look that up on chat. GPT but all to say another just original, I'd argue daring didn't take the easy way with, hey, I'll just, you know, do a monochromatic thing beside it. And it's magic and it works.
00:11:21.710 - 00:11:39.220, Speaker A: I have my formula. Taking chances here. And again, this gorgeousness up here. So just huge fan of what bosque is doing here. And so you see these last four, the negatives are back. And look at this. I mean, and we saw that one, and I didn't even see this one.
00:11:39.220 - 00:12:14.030, Speaker A: So this is back. It looks like whoever took these slides. I mean, this looks like Rome, doesn't it? This looks like Castella. The, doesn't this look like the castle? Maybe it's not. I was going to say this kind of looks like the castle right by the Vatican. And here we see, what is the name of that painter, the friend of Van Gogh, Paul something, I'm sure someone out there who went to Tahiti. And there is that Gauguin, Paul Gauguin.
00:12:14.030 - 00:12:55.004, Speaker A: That looks like a Gauguin in the, so just really cool, again, triangle now, taking risks, you know, trying things out, pushing the envelope. Super cool. Speaking of super cool, Skor, also known as Saiko ihara out of Japan, is gonna be on this Wednesday's Twitter spaces. So I'm super thrilled about that. She's gonna join me in Runetune. And she, of course, is a VJ as well as a digital artist. And so, you know, V Jane has its whole own kind of processes and ways of making, you know, visual imagery.
00:12:55.004 - 00:13:40.632, Speaker A: And so I think it's going to be super interesting to hear how V Jane has influenced what she does and still, and she uses a lot of interesting artwork. So I've pinned this on my Twitter feed. So Saiko ihara on digital art and V Jane, very excited about that. And here is some of Saiko's work, also known as score, here on Instagram and Twitter soloshowdatdubai. And you see here the interesting processing, I think uses touch designer, these great flowers. Just really, really cool work. I remember the first time we showed Saiko on the show, maybe six months ago, and how just amazed I was at the work.
00:13:40.632 - 00:14:15.954, Speaker A: So just a really interesting artist and using this text within it, it's really cool. So that is coming up, and we actually have a couple more and trying different things here. This is a 3D Scan of a restaurant display made with one null, one touch designer, which Saiko uses, and Adobe scanned with scanniverse. So playing with a 3d scanner here. So again, just a super interesting artist. And one more here, see if we can get this going. Here we go.
00:14:15.954 - 00:14:46.064, Speaker A: We'll see it in slow motion here, thanks to my Internet. So you see all this great stuff. I don't know if this is touch designer two, but just this wave coming through. So just really interesting, original work here. Dream day one, dream day in Tokyo, made with Touch designer Adobe 3D scan. So just trying all sorts of software, edition of two and one has been transferred. So here is the Pixel network.
00:14:46.064 - 00:15:12.924, Speaker A: Very excited and Ed has posted this got real for me when Ed posted a video here, basic pixel art techniques. And so I had posted a few of my last videos here from YouTube. Here's the Pixel art masterclass here. And I'll have to replace all these images of myself. But this is the podcast, and there is going to be. The podcast hasn't been updated because there have been issues with the uploading situation. They're all ready to go.
00:15:12.924 - 00:15:57.434, Speaker A: I am have a meeting this week to get out of acast and back into Spotify and export that feedback into friendlier territories for me, at least in terms of the podcast. So those will start going back up and I will catch up with all the episodes that have not been posted there. But how exciting is this? I mean, at the end of the day, what I wanted, and this is a sub stack. So Pixel network dot substack.com. At the end of the day, what I wanted was a place where me and Ed could kind of effortlessly put up our videos and have one place where you can just see all our stuff together. We call it the Pixel network. Maybe put the podcast right and just something very humble, very first drafty here.
00:15:57.434 - 00:16:19.866, Speaker A: And so pretty fun. And so I'll have to update the last couple of videos here. I didn't want to knock eds out there, but he I think we'll have more coming. And so check this out. So you click on here basic pixel art techniques from pixel art masterclass. This section may change name, but that's what I called it for ed there. Marolla style aseprite basics.
00:16:19.866 - 00:16:47.560, Speaker A: And so you can watch that here. And what was great was demon holding a box has been posted. And Ed, thank you for sending me one. So the work that Ed made is actually here on object two, and then linking to the live drawing. So pretty interesting. Open edition for two tazos. So super cool and actually a pretty cool work, isn't it? With the little devil figure holding what looks like a little diploma or something, and some beautiful fire.
00:16:47.560 - 00:17:12.764, Speaker A: So you can watch Ed make that, you know, revealing the secrets of the trade here. So continuing on, comments on last show, paper doll, thank you for the feature. Now I am tearing up. Lol. So that was really, that was great to hear. So paper doll of course made that opening work last episode, this work up here. I am truly glad my work resonated with you.
00:17:12.764 - 00:17:38.981, Speaker A: My late father was a stage actor and in the realm of theater there exists a fundamental essence of flow, fleeting, transient and mortal qualities, like, beautifully put. So yes, let us all try and transcend this mortal coil. Great show. Thank you paper doll, really great to hear from you. And yeah, I mean what an incredible work. And yeah, everybody's tearing up here. Salieri always watching, not always commenting.
00:17:38.981 - 00:17:49.178, Speaker A: All very good as usual. Thank you. Much appreciated. And Danielle king. So a couple of corrections actually on last yesterday's show. Thank you Pokebelly. This is Danielle King.
00:17:49.178 - 00:18:19.346, Speaker A: Thank you Pokebelly for the kind words about the upcoming reflection show at art matter company in Brooklyn, curated by Ajburni from tender art. My tweet of Frida shows the digital version. So this was the digital, not a physical version of that work for the show. Stay tuned for the sneak peeks of the physical paintings. So for this one, this actually was a digital work. The others that we saw from Lily Illo were physical, FYI. So thank you for that correction there.
00:18:19.346 - 00:18:53.210, Speaker A: And also bulls, by the way, it's not trippy collector, the curator of mycelium and Miscellany. It's a collective drop from the neutral arts latin american artists community. Yes, I confused bulls or dem woods with trippie collectors. So it's actually bulls. Who I believe who curated this is the founder. We've been doing workshops to introduce new artists to blockchain and other cultural actions the past two years. So apologies on that bulls.
00:18:53.210 - 00:19:19.440, Speaker A: So just want to correct that. And I have actually brought up so here is actually the, and there's bosca gratias and Bizaya and Santiago ruau tornado. So here is the poster for it. Neutro zora. So this is on zora and bezaya posted this. The whole lineup on the drop is really worth the mention. An opportunity to get pieces from many renowned artists and to support them.
00:19:19.440 - 00:19:43.438, Speaker A: And here it is on Zora. Okay, so it's right here on the homepage. Getting super prominent position here with tons of awesome drops and a bzaya there. We looked at the tornado yesterday yotta some artists I haven't seen before. Moda Mt there. So all sorts of awesome artists here for this mycelium and miscellany drop. And of course here's Boziah's pinking, not tripping.
00:19:43.438 - 00:20:04.194, Speaker A: And again, these are free mints. So that is pretty cool. Just pay a little fee, and you get your cool work on Zora L2, I believe, of ethereum. So how cool is that? And just cool work here by psaya with all the mushrooms in the background. Just awesome. And here's their website. To fully right the wrong here.
00:20:04.194 - 00:20:24.650, Speaker A: Here is the website of the. And check this out. So I guess this takes you, I'm not sure, like, we're minting on Zora network. So how cool is this? They even have their own website, I wonder. Interesting. I don't want to bring up metamask, actually, so. But really nice job they did.
00:20:24.650 - 00:21:29.140, Speaker A: So bulls is the founder Sulkian? Now, someone sent this to me, and I don't want to get the name wrong, so someone sent Sulkian to me, who I have known Sulkian's work from way back on object when I first started discovering works. And I'm going to show those works in a second. But Julian Suleiko, also known as Sulkian, is back. I wanted to share the process of my latest work, photogrammetry and virtual reality and performance with blender and stable diffusion. So check this out, I think, out of Argentina. I mean, it looks so complicated. I'm gonna stop the music just in case that's taken from somewhere else.
00:21:29.140 - 00:21:47.424, Speaker A: But, I mean, look at how complex this work is. So it looks like using a ton of different softwares. Who knows what is going on here? But it looks super ambitious and super interesting. So bosque grazias. Exploring technological frontiers. New aesthetic languages are born in art. So.
00:21:47.424 - 00:22:09.536, Speaker A: Wow. Wow. From Sulkian. And if you don't know Sulkian's work, here is a tip for you. I made this awesome series on effects hash with synths and everything. But then some of the older works, these are hick et nunc, or hen. And here are some just older works that.
00:22:09.536 - 00:22:34.000, Speaker A: Some of my first works that I ever collected on this one, too, on the blockchain. Let me just show you. Or. Sorry. On object or tazos. Tazos. I mean, nine tazos, $6.19.
00:22:34.000 - 00:22:58.052, Speaker A: I probably paid more for those way back when, so just super cool. I always loved the synths. Kind of a sucker for the synths. This is a beautiful one. So this is Sulkian. The same guy. I love this.
00:22:58.052 - 00:23:30.484, Speaker A: This work. So these are from. These are from way back in 2021. So, yeah, Sulkian, Sulkian, Tez, if you have never seen the work before, check this out. I mean, this scene is so interesting in that it kind of has tentacles that can reach surprisingly deep into certain areas. One bit necro. Wu Tang, as in the Wu Tang clan, I believe.
00:23:30.484 - 00:23:47.000, Speaker A: Or maybe they're just called Wu Tang now. Wu Tang took my artwork and video work with them on their worldwide tour. There's a clip with RZA performing to my gigascreen drop at the OA arena. Told ya I was good. Told you I'm the long game. Look at me. Bang bang.
00:23:47.000 - 00:24:21.212, Speaker A: So just show you here. So I am gonna mute this. And fortunately, I can't make this big right now. But as you can see here, I guess this is one bit necro in the background work by one bit necro. And for those, again, this kind of brings you back to some really classic artists on the blockchain here. So this looks like more like, I guess, illustrative work. But there it is, like in this massive arena.
00:24:21.212 - 00:24:33.518, Speaker A: And there, that looks like more like classic. One bit necro there. Let me show you some. One bit necro. I mean, this is one of my favorites. 590 edition of 64 the VHS. This is classic early.
00:24:33.518 - 00:25:16.778, Speaker A: Like Hen November 2021. I think this is hen. I don't know exactly when they shut down, but, you know, just super classic. A beautiful. I think I made a show called Edgy Pixel Art. If you go back in time about a year ago on one bit necro, when I'd focus on one artist at a time when I first started this show. And as you can see here, just brilliant, right? Just like very low res, you know, I was still trying to wrap my head around, like, is pixel art, like legitimate, you know, stupidly in my own head? And meanwhile, look at how avant garde this is, you know? So just really ahead, you know, avant garde pixel art.
00:25:16.778 - 00:25:33.272, Speaker A: Edgy pixel's handmade animation, the VHS agency series. So. And look at this awesome title here. So just very cool work here. Here's some more. One bit necro. This is classic NFTV playing off of MTV.
00:25:33.272 - 00:26:04.784, Speaker A: And here you have like a pixel art, you know, Jesus, xmass Gif. Just really, really cool artists. This is Steve Jobs, Apple Steve help. Huge fan of one bit necro here. Just some brilliant work worth checking out on Tezos. And finally, you know, to tie the bow here on early kind of Tezos art rata, you asked me to tell you the story of the first Medici campaign. This work here.
00:26:04.784 - 00:26:28.790, Speaker A: Unfortunately, I don't have much to show you about the process. I can give you a summary, though I recommend to start searching for good references. Edward Muybridge archive is a great resource. For example, I found much better references for the horse, then the flag, and it shows at the end. I redraw each frame and use layers in Photoshop. Not recommended at all. So rad is using Photoshop for pixel art.
00:26:28.790 - 00:26:50.850, Speaker A: It's expensive and really not good for animation. I'm trying to learn other software, but it's too late for me. Run if you can. When editing is mainly experience and patience, testing, fixing and testing, again, easier, the clearer the idea of what is wanted. The rest is the hand of the collectors where art completes itself. So here is this really cool gif. I guess it's the Edward Muybridge.
00:26:50.850 - 00:27:34.400, Speaker A: So how cool is it that someone put these all on top of each other and animated it? And I actually brought this up. So this is 325 tezos edition of 144. This is one of the first nfts I ever bought on tezos. If you go to the very beginning of my collection, you'll see this work there, like, I'm sure, on the first page. And so just a gorgeous work. And there you see the horse, which seems to be based on Edward Muybridge, the early photographer, and the interest they had, these photographers. And who is the other? Etienne, Jules Marie, the other, you know, this fascination with movement, right? And it almost anticipates video to a certain degree.
00:27:34.400 - 00:28:19.010, Speaker A: And even with the futurists, I mean, the futurists were kind of all about, you know, forms in motion. So it's kind of interesting, that kind of weird. It's kind of hard to relate to now as here I'm making a video. We consume videos kind of constantly. It's kind of hard to wrap your head around how novel that must have been. And that's because it's almost weird that there's this obsession with movement back then, say, with the futurist, like, where is this coming from? But it was probably an anticipation, really, of video. Even with the, you know, the horse in motion from, I think that's 1880s, 1890s, early photography, Akira Dice, also, I think, known as Euro Dice, Akira Dice on Twitter.
00:28:19.010 - 00:28:40.654, Speaker A: Here. Here is a new on cyber. And thank you for making the video here. Let's take a look at it. It looks to me like on cyber, galleries are getting pretty good looking, aren't they? Like, this isn't the simple room. So I don't know, maybe they're developing and evolving here at these galleries. I mean, this looks like almost someone's house here.
00:28:40.654 - 00:29:14.452, Speaker A: And so pretty interesting to see. And the video just makes it so easy to consume. That's almost what I want from these personally, is just like take me on a video tour and then it's like, to me, that's almost the final product here. So continuing on. So very cool. Eurydice puts out a weekly video, I think, here I'm excited to share my 23rd on Cyber gallery using the new house template to celebrate some of my favorite tezos. Nfts on cyber generated video is whack, but adds to the mystery.
00:29:14.452 - 00:29:44.552, Speaker A: See for yourself and come party. So this is probably cyber on cyber generated video. Interesting. So there's even like automatic video. And this is art of the Millennium Gallery, who has a few works here from artists we've seen before, ephemeral visions, exploring transients through art. So I think I was looking at this the other day, that goyong arts there, that really cool work. And there are take a walk through this incredible.
00:29:44.552 - 00:30:19.364, Speaker A: Through this digital gallery to explore pieces from 18 incredible artists in our upcoming curated auction. So pretty cool. Another nice way of consuming this, isn't it? I mean, you could have an extended version of these videos where you kind of get a close up and where you kind of look at each one. And to me, that's almost the product for these on cyber galleries. But again, I'm not an expert and I've never made one. So take that for what it's worth. So very cool here.
00:30:19.364 - 00:30:38.772, Speaker A: And some of the artists here. DKN interaction by Axscene will be available via Art of the millennium on October 3, which I believe is today. Decaying interaction is part of the ephemeral vision show. So here it is. Not sure if there's any. Probably no volume. So interesting.
00:30:38.772 - 00:31:12.314, Speaker A: Kind of beautiful. Small to large pixels here in the animation and trying to keep what looks like, trying to keep tabs on all the information here on multiple fronts. And then a skull in the background here with almost this Francis bacon, you know, impossible space here. Just really cool work from Oxene. Here's one from Xerox NFT two. Or Xerox God mode by Xerox will be available as well. So yeah, just interesting.
00:31:12.314 - 00:31:39.256, Speaker A: Different kind of works here. So I wonder what Xerox is up to here. And here we have someone who is chained to what looks like kind of a temple, maybe some sort of spiritual, mystical figure. We have some noise coming out in a kind of rings here. It almost looks like a kind of temple of sorts. What is it? God mode. So maybe some sort of, kind of religious imagery.
00:31:39.256 - 00:32:12.322, Speaker A: And is this like a Christ like figure? Not sure. Interesting work from Xerox Zionaya by Harry Packard. So here's another one and this artist we haven't looked at in forever, who's almost got, like, the beatles yellow submarine kind of feel to it. And here is just a really cool illustration. I think they're on super rare. We looked probably six or seven months ago at their work in detail, and just a cool kind of psychedelic illustrator here. Continuing on into the works we go.
00:32:12.322 - 00:32:37.924, Speaker A: Another illustration, pretty psychedelic here, too. Stellar Horizon by Uyoh 66. This was just minted, and I'm going to read the description actually here. It's the year 22 66. As earth faces imminent collapse, the brave souls aboard the interstellar vessel stellar horizon set forth on a journey beyond the stars. The mission to seek a new home amidst the vast cosmos. And here I brought it.
00:32:37.924 - 00:33:27.654, Speaker A: So pretty cool. I mean, Uyo 66 has, it always looks good and interesting, and I'll show you something that's also interesting. Wii O 66 was experimenting with black and white works with, sometimes I think with red in them, and it's almost like those are being incorporated into these very colorful, like, beautiful works. Like, when you zoom in, it's pretty spectacular. All the different colors here, and totally recognizable as Uyo 66 palette kind of has a bit of an underground comics feel, and there's a stellar horizon, maybe space fairy news. I recognize this kind of computer. There's a brilliant work by Uyo 66 on tezos of that kind of computer.
00:33:27.654 - 00:33:56.432, Speaker A: And look at this massive, like, demon figure with the eyeballs. So again, very reminiscent in a certain way to zap comics. Nice innovation here with the black and white in the middle of all of this color, creating a pretty nice contrast. It's kind of massive, kind of epic, ambitious work here. And interesting up here too. Here's like Ethereum, the ETH icon and everything. So just really cool.
00:33:56.432 - 00:34:36.242, Speaker A: That looks like the spaceship and everything. Just a pretty spectacular work there. Memory number four by Sebaste Sestaro. And here is just another kind of surreal illustration here, as you can see from the interesting kind of airbrush painting style, the eye that kind of rolls over the picture in a picture here. And then also here. Again, bold experimentation, but persuasively done here, edition of one. And this sold for only 35 tezos, so you could have gotten a Sebast Sistaro memory number four for only 35.
00:34:36.242 - 00:34:57.026, Speaker A: That is a pretty good deal. And here's paper Buddha, who I haven't seen from for a few weeks here. Matsuri paper Buddha. So this is by paper Buddha. Nothing brings people together like celebrations. So I met paper Buddha online on a retro Manny space and retro Manny just actually finished the contest. We should take a look at that.
00:34:57.026 - 00:35:40.638, Speaker A: Maybe next episode. And paper Buddha helped do a cover for Retro man, the comic book there and here. And in that space, I learned all about paper Buddha's style. And it's quite interesting, like a collage artist who goes to, like, antique stores to get images like this and maybe images like that, you know, we were discussing in that show how not everything makes it onto the Internet, you know, as people who, you know, work in. I used to work in a used bookstore when I was a teenager, and paper Buddha also frequents a lot of these kind of antique, old used bookstores. And he concurred. He agreed.
00:35:40.638 - 00:36:06.088, Speaker A: He's like, yes, not everything makes it to the Internet. That was a really interesting discussion. What also makes paper Buddha's work interesting is then digital processes are applied over top. So as you can see, this is digital collage. So maybe this has been scanned in and cut out. But then you see, like the shadow here. So self consciously digital, probably adding a very sharp drop shadow or masking this and just moving it up.
00:36:06.088 - 00:36:33.230, Speaker A: So making these techniques here. So keeping it inherently digital, even though there are physical and sometimes old sources for the work. So beautiful work on exchange art part of childhood dreams. And this is available for 50 sol, so not cheap. On solana on explore art from paper Buddha. Happy metamorphosis day. From cure.
00:36:33.230 - 00:36:48.378, Speaker A: Or, sorry, curated by cure. Yeah, or created by cure. So this is by cure. DK motion just bought this. So this is from September 5. And so this came up in my Twitter feed. The first page of the metaphorical self's journey to a new world.
00:36:48.378 - 00:37:12.558, Speaker A: I thought, just kind of interesting. This is a digital painting. That is what it says on here. So interesting because it's got a real watercolor feel to it. I thought it was quite original in its kind of composition, its color, just the general overall feel and what is being gone for. I mean, it's kind of abstract, but it's kind of representational. It's kind of surreal, you know, just kind of original.
00:37:12.558 - 00:37:49.102, Speaker A: Happy metamorphosis day. So it seems to be a metamorphosis of sort. It's maybe a spiritual metamorphosis as kind of this head is cracking open here. Very interesting work. Gloom tube with a seasonal work here hitchhiking stamp. Kind of a dark piece, I thought, here is the happy gloom tube figure hitchhiking, asking for a ride. And then this very ominous windshield with what look like almost tears and fuzziness, you know, from this, you know, figure, it's probably, this is probably the gloom tube's reflection here, actually.
00:37:49.102 - 00:38:30.996, Speaker A: And so we're almost looking at what probably, you know, it's a very ominous figure here that you can't quite see with these very ominous, you know, drops here with shadows. Pretty brilliant composition here by gloom tube edition of 130, I was sent one and for one tezos 97. You can buy it on secondary dan control. So Dan control sells a pigeon to Vincent van Doe and comes out with a few. One of one pigeons feed me thoughts fly like pigeons on the subway. So beautiful pigeon works here. One of ones for 150 tezos and several here.
00:38:30.996 - 00:38:51.892, Speaker A: Here's another one waiting in line. I just love this area here. Brilliant idea for the gradient for making gradient works is celebrating that part of the pigeon's neck here. Here's another one with interesting background. Kind of sweet lovers. And then we got a bit of humor here. Eyes open.
00:38:51.892 - 00:39:15.086, Speaker A: So we have this one and then we have this one. Eyes open. Now, I think these are different works, right? So kind of some humor here. Someone bought this tempert bought this one for 100 tezos. Again, we're talking about the. It brings, it brings us back to this idea of the tension of digital copies. Right? So dan control really playing with that here.
00:39:15.086 - 00:39:24.684, Speaker A: And then a slightly. A different version here, but similar composition. Eyes open. Similar title, though. Identical title. One of 100 tezos. So interesting.
00:39:24.684 - 00:39:45.064, Speaker A: And here they all are. So pretty funny. I mean, this isn't exactly the same. The gradient is different, say, with these. So it's not exactly the same, but interesting and funny. And playing with this whole idea of digital copies. Super interesting and kind of bold in its execution, which I think kind of adds to the credibility.
00:39:45.064 - 00:40:09.778, Speaker A: More gradients of 1914, Basil. So which I think means kiss, maybe in Spanish here. Beautiful huge green frame gradients. And then two of these almost, you know, Fernand Leger like figures here. And then some great gradients here in the background. Very interesting work as ever. And let's see, I was going to guess his magician.
00:40:09.778 - 00:40:25.320, Speaker A: Magician with a couple. And Daedalus Zeus with another. And here's another beautiful one, collect for 33. So this is still available. Let's just see here. One transferred to pokebelly. Well, thank you.
00:40:25.320 - 00:40:40.544, Speaker A: Thank you, magician. And so that's hilarious. I didn't even see that. Wonderful. Thank you, magician. And here you see two figures in the rain. A beautiful work with this beautiful pale blue gradient.
00:40:40.544 - 00:41:05.472, Speaker A: I don't think we looked at that one yesterday, but it's possible we did Descan soul. So one more here with a figure with fruits above here or perhaps. And then more of these kind of star like gradients here. So more totally experimental work here from NUV 1914. Super interesting, the myth with a one of one from last year, the myth 2022. But just released today. Another lemon in the sky.
00:41:05.472 - 00:41:34.728, Speaker A: Guilty. So interesting work at auction for 100 tezos here from myth with these very intense eyes. And here is the lemon head and a red shirt here, a red sweatshirt with classic myth background clouds. And again, looks like it was made in procreate, classic sort of green and pink colors there, too. Let's just see. And so already a couple of bids. Actually, another bid has come in for 111 tezos.
00:41:34.728 - 00:41:54.704, Speaker A: So here it comes. One of one myth. This was super cool. Spiegelsmaskinen with a cool. Maybe this is just a work in progress, but very nice piece here of this retro computer kind of breaking down. Not sure if it's a progress shot or what, but it looks great. Demon ego with some very interesting.
00:41:54.704 - 00:42:17.574, Speaker A: Again, a combination of physical and digital. And again, making it look almost effortless here to combine the two. So just a really nice work. Gnome from demon ego. And I thought this was great, too. Slava three, wake up. And let me just bring this big if it's possible, we'll try this.
00:42:17.574 - 00:42:37.298, Speaker A: Here we go. So a big. This is on Manifold XYZ. And here you see the skeleton breaking down with these new colors that slava three has been using. Breaking the alarm clock here with GM on it. And let's just see what's happening in the market for it. Five have been minted already at basically 0.09
00:42:37.298 - 00:43:01.002, Speaker A: ETH open edition for another two days. And you got to love those windows here, the wake up windows there. Brilliant. Stippnpixel paw flyby. So this is on Zora and only one minted. You know, there is an opportunity when people like say, stipinpixel mint. And then if you don't end up on the homepage, sometimes these turn into pretty low editions.
00:43:01.002 - 00:43:32.750, Speaker A: So only one minted of paw flyby here, and I brought it up larger. So just really cool work by stippin pixel, super interesting pixel artists, kind of innocent and fun cats, kids hanging out together. And then the cat, you know, the kid crashes when the cat falls on them in the playground. Just super fun. Mech txt. So this is the work I was mentioning yesterday. My comic piece, short eternity for sloth scenes, number 17 issue.
00:43:32.750 - 00:43:51.662, Speaker A: Pleased to be a contributor to the comic scene again after a month break. Had to take it. Had to take it to refill my stamina. But now I'm back full powered. So sloth is a magazine that is on tezos and features a lot of Tezos artists. So it's been around for a while. Number 17 here and so very cool.
00:43:51.662 - 00:44:20.598, Speaker A: Short eternity. So here's a little comic by mech TxT and sloth. You probably recognize who this is now. And with this awesome diagonal yellow sun, if you can see that kappen upon us, a little rain must fall. So again, a landscape that is bordering on the edge of abstraction and done with pixel art. Done in pixel art. Just simple square pixels here, maybe three colors with that beautiful gray background.
00:44:20.598 - 00:44:47.066, Speaker A: Love it. Absolutely love it. Blotter NfT color rhapsody. And I think I ran through blotter NFT's last work here. So take a little more time here as we look at the almost vaporwave like colors here. And this very kind of complex, almost manga like work here with a lot of details could probably hang in the same show as a popple. And this is great here in the screen with this kind of texture.
00:44:47.066 - 00:45:09.866, Speaker A: Default text of sorts here and other screens. And here is the figure. Very complex, different sized pixels here, some large, some small, contrasting as you see back here. Different kinds of textures in this work. What's happening? Color rhapsody. The symphony of hues and tones that dance across the canvas with this great text here. Edition of ten for eight tazos.
00:45:09.866 - 00:45:28.150, Speaker A: And that is on secondary. Let's just see what it sold for. Three tezos on primary couple bought by Mazin the great mazen. And look at this. This could also hang in that show. Almost the same colors. Kuda future merchant and this is 1150 and that is on secondary as well.
00:45:28.150 - 00:45:54.124, Speaker A: So pretty cool. I think Cuda is the one that did the dark matter lab, or if I got that right. And here we have another kind of big screen with a car and some figure here and some sort of user interface and all sorts. Again, kind of. They go really nicely together, don't they? Kind of very busy kind of pixel art here. And similar colors. Almost identical, almost, but not quite.
00:45:54.124 - 00:46:35.856, Speaker A: Sabato portrait of a copy minter I recently stumbled upon a copy mentor on Zora trying to rip off the air Force air highs, a collab that Skye Goodman and I made together for their lost sneakers. So for those that don't know, a copyminter, as far as I understand, what happened here is someone who will copy the image and then try and sell it somewhere else, like on a different platform, and maybe even pretend to be the artists. So luckily I managed to get a look at the perpetrator and was able to render a realistic portrait of the copy mentors. Goofy and unfortunate visage. They will never truly understand the beauty of an air force. Errors highs so made in deluxe paint. And so here is the copy minter one assumes with several watches on.
00:46:35.856 - 00:47:03.060, Speaker A: And here are the high tops and really nice gradient here. Deluxe paint four on an emulated amiga from Sabato. And this is 880. And there are eight left on primary emperor's trash with a series on Zora. This is goddess four. And so combining illustration with some animated abstraction in the outlines, in some of the outlines here. So interesting series animated Gif loop.
00:47:03.060 - 00:47:29.364, Speaker A: I took my OG damsel drawings, collaborated, class, collabed with them on AI, then animated the outputs in photo mosh. So a lot of exporting here and experimenting with AI as well. I'm a huge fan of this. I was doing it myself. If I understand this right, taking your works and then mixing them in AI. And you can do that pretty easily and it brings really interesting results. Here are other works from that series here.
00:47:29.364 - 00:47:56.496, Speaker A: So you can mint all of them. On Zora Goddesses is the series from Empress trash continuing on Sean Luke. Acidic Brew. And I think this is new, brand new Sean Luke. So this is an edition of seven and one is already off one offer of 150 tezos already. So Sean Luke has also been on tezos for a while. And here you see just a really cool animated abstract.
00:47:56.496 - 00:48:25.074, Speaker A: I believe this is abstract. Maybe these are hats, not exactly sure. Almost like ice cubes here. So maybe they're all ice cubes, but not sure, maybe acidic brew wakes you up. So interesting piece here. Maybe it's just a kind of abstract brew, so to speak, from Sean Luke and of course the Kurt hussle collective with an awesome piece here. DBO Sports is back here with some awesome.
00:48:25.074 - 00:48:46.196, Speaker A: I think that's japanese writing. Not entirely sure. And another one of these, you know. You know, what is the name of that game? Another one of these kind of figures here. Mortal Kombat like figures here. Kind of like a blanket kind of feel to it, but different. And dinosaur here, but also kind of a sumo wrestler.
00:48:46.196 - 00:49:13.460, Speaker A: You meet the lizard before he swallows you whole and drops you on the outer ring as bleached bones. 50 tezos and addition of five. There are two left from Kurt Hussle collective. One sold to Daedalus Zeus, Dibio sports. So here's the logo as well. Looks fantastic. A premium sports channel that will help you forget you're on the blockchain edition of ten and sent out to previous collectors and one more here from Kurt Hussle, collective network entities leading life for you.
00:49:13.460 - 00:50:16.604, Speaker A: So this is two minutes, but we'll play a touch if it plays kind of like a screensaver, kind of satirical, kind of soothing. So as you can see, almost like a screensaver type of work here as we continue on here. Eizo future chair. So another super cool modern from the modern furniture series, I believe so. Coming back with the modern Furniture series and this beautiful, you know, I mean, one of the reasons the series seems to work so well is because the form and like the process and the content seems to line up right. I mean, you have this old like 1970s type chair, but almost like the video and all the noise kind of feels like maybe it's seventies or eighties kind of feeling. So it really.
00:50:16.604 - 00:50:36.164, Speaker A: But you know, only really possible to put this together like this probably now. I mean, it'd be pretty tricky. Maybe it is all analog. I'm not even sure. With its reclined black back and plush cushion, this chair is perfect for relaxation. Future chair number eleven, just minted edition of 25. And there are 13 left on primary.
00:50:36.164 - 00:50:57.512, Speaker A: Great to see that series back. Kim Asendor, fixed, fixed pixel, 100% on chain. Real time animation with no dependencies or third party servers in involved. So this is on chain 10 kb. So you see how small this is. Remember when Spuegels Maskinen was trying to. Was like, hey, look, I made 2 kb.
00:50:57.512 - 00:51:21.064, Speaker A: Sometimes there's an aesthetic in how small you can get a work. You know, it's sort of like if you're going to mint on ordinals, the smaller the better. Right? Animated SVG cover serve directly from the smart contract. So this is 100% on chain and only 10 kb. Pretty cool if you ask me. I mean, very cool. Interesting work here.
00:51:21.064 - 00:51:43.308, Speaker A: Kind of fits really well with the squiggles. And, you know, I don't know if squiggles is 100% on chain, it probably is. Like, I mean, to me this is a nice addition to that whole tradition of sorts. Continuing on. Look at this data and correlation system made with code in hydraulic. So more kind of code work here. And this is by Ferdaropeza.
00:51:43.308 - 00:52:15.072, Speaker A: And I think if I click on it, it does, I think change it here. So I believe this is an interactive work. So just kind of a wild digital artwork here. And I think I affect it when I click on it. So just pretty interesting edition of ten for five tazos, seven left into AI we go etkin the night's light and just had a really nice feel to it. Kind of interesting almost has a Hockney feel to it, almost. But this is at night and quite different.
00:52:15.072 - 00:52:37.116, Speaker A: Look at how beautiful this house is. And that nice computer overlooking the pool right on the beach here. And just a beautiful AI painting from Etken. Edition of five for five tazos. Five left the night slightly. And this is by Shili Preston, who has a Tez vending machine. So maybe that's where you get this.
00:52:37.116 - 00:53:11.016, Speaker A: This is an edition of one for 35 Tezos Ghost pole party. And again, definitely a Hockney feel in this one as the splash, in the rendition of the splash with the palm tree. So again, we see this kind of spectral hockney in the AI artworks here, as well as in this. Almost reminds you of Hockney's, you know, works where it's, I think, in the shower or in the bathroom. You see these bathroom tiles. So you wonder if Hockney is somewhere in here. Raw AI by Shilly Preston and venta red dawn.
00:53:11.016 - 00:53:37.684, Speaker A: So venta times AI. So maybe some editing in here too. Quite a beautiful one here as we see these kind of thick textures, very painterly textures down here. And then some of the kind of classic, almost plasticine figures here with a beautiful red sky. And look at these colors here. Beautiful, beautiful colors. And these dark red, all of it, just super interesting addition of ten for eight tezos, nine left, red dawn.
00:53:37.684 - 00:54:09.778, Speaker A: Good title. And this is die with the most likes. So I was almost confused, actually, I am confused because I thought a lot of these were done as AI artworks, the beef Brothko series. And maybe they are. So maybe this is inspired or you know what this probably is. If I had to guess, maybe this is a source work that were put together by the AI that resulted in the beef Brothco series. So maybe this is a source that the AI kind of was playing with.
00:54:09.778 - 00:54:31.374, Speaker A: That's what this looks like, because they kind of looked physical, but they kind of look like AI. So that is super interesting. And here's Chash Mishkahiki, who we've looked at before, running from a black hole. Look at how beautiful the color is on this. So more out of the contemporary art world here. Very cool artist. How many followers? 9000 followers.
00:54:31.374 - 00:54:54.338, Speaker A: So still relatively small here. Look at this great color. Like just beautiful, super interesting composition. Beautifully painted here, I think with a pretty major gallery, if I remember right. Just a super. There's, I think the artist, I believe, looking like a villainous little rainbow cupcake for platform magazine. So doing pretty well.
00:54:54.338 - 00:55:11.370, Speaker A: Like I've seen Chash, if I'm pronouncing that right, Chash's name before. Or maybe it's one of these. Not sure. But anyway, maybe this is the name. Rithika Pandy. Perhaps. So anyway, very cool.
00:55:11.370 - 00:55:17.794, Speaker A: And that is your show, my friends. Thank you for joining me. Come check out the Twitter spaces tomorrow. Until next time, take care.
