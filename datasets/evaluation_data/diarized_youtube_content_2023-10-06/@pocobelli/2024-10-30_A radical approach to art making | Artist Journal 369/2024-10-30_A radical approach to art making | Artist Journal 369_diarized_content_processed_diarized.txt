00:00:04.200 - 00:00:36.421, Speaker A: Welcome back to your living breathing conversation online where I talk with the images and people comment and then I reply. It is a one of a kind show. Welcome back. Artist Journal, October 30, 2024, broadcasting from Inner space in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pocavelli. Dancing with words in front of you once again. Thank you for joining me.
00:00:36.421 - 00:00:59.891, Speaker A: Thank you for all the huge support on the last show. That was a good one. That one got like a big response as we're gonna see. So in the spirit of keeping things continuously short or can to continue to keep things short. Let's go. So I think we may have started with this artist. Let me make sure I get the name right.
00:00:59.891 - 00:01:21.209, Speaker A: Kazuhiro Ehara. And I think this was actually the show that Little Cakes was at. Remember maybe a week ago, if you're watching, Little Cakes had some footage. I think it was this artist, I believe Japanese. I am not positive on that. Singing the Heartfelt Rain. A pretty rad piece.
00:01:21.209 - 00:01:50.645, Speaker A: I think I've started maybe maybe once before, like a year and a half ago with Kazuhiro's work. Maybe I'm not positive on that. Anyway, a really cool work. And why does it work? It's kind of shocking in a sense, right? I mean that's one reason it works. You could argue, you know, is it's a difficult work. I'd say. I think some people would look at that and go, is that art? This is like some guy scribbling and then like there's pixelation.
00:01:50.645 - 00:02:46.877, Speaker A: But I would argue it does work. And in fact, you know, using the newspaper, the imagination as a kind of guide, I think this would work. I think people's heads would turn and why. And I think what you have here is, I would be tempting to call it almost, you know, let's call it a radical juxtaposition. I was going to call it a shocking juxtaposition, but a pretty radical juxtaposition with these hard edged pixels here dithered again shockingly against this flat, seemingly flat blue background. It seems to be a cloud and then over top you have almost as if it's been scribbled over top or like done really quickly with a marker. And then it's moving and then there's even like it looks like it's masked and there's even colors flowing through.
00:02:46.877 - 00:03:05.725, Speaker A: Maybe it's almost like a wire. And to cap it off, not even. We haven't even capped it off. It looks like a cloud that's raining. Right? You see the rain here. Quite a shocking, you know, Work from a. How would you call it? From just like the overall approach.
00:03:05.725 - 00:04:07.523, Speaker A: This is completely, you know, put it this way, would you ever think in your mind to create a work like this, like, in terms of this process? And would you even know how once you've seen this and you had to reproduce it in a weird way, I'd say, like, would you even know where to begin? And you could probably approximate it. But could you? You know, especially when you see the changing color of the cloud, it's almost like a gradient that's cycling through in the background that's being masked by this large scale, kind of pixelated dithering that looks like it's been expanded, but maybe it's been drawn out that way. And don't forget it's. The rain here is static, yet the stars and the hearts and almost emojis of sorts. Some are fuzzed out, some are, you know, harder edged. They are falling from the sky as if it's rain and it's almost like it's raining emojis. And let's go back to the title now.
00:04:07.523 - 00:04:43.825, Speaker A: Singing the Heartfelt Rain. So it is almost these hearts are raining from this Cloud in the sky edition of one picked up by OMG blog for 100 Tezos 99 Tazos. Pretty rad work. Again, it takes a lot of, I would call it courage, you know, to start making decisions. Like here in the cloud, you see that it's kind of hard edge here. Like your rational mind is just dying. Even your sense of aesthetics is just crying out to fix this.
00:04:43.825 - 00:05:16.979, Speaker A: But so it makes it that much more radical. And in a sense it would. It does to a certain degree, I would argue, give a kind of aesthetic pleasure, not of the cloud being perfect, but a different kind of aesthetic pleasure. One could argue of the boldness of this radical contrast, of the radicality of the work. So pretty cool. Now I brought up Kazuhiro Ihara, Uncharted pixels. Well put.
00:05:16.979 - 00:05:49.553, Speaker A: Uncharted pixels. Beautifully put. That's exactly what these are. And as you see, a pretty again. And we've looked at a lot of these works before, I think maybe once a long time ago we had perhaps like maybe this one on the front, but I can't remember. It's been a while. But yeah, I mean, a pretty interesting journey here too.
00:05:49.553 - 00:06:42.595, Speaker A: It goes from kind of a painterly journey down here, although you do see the pixels here. I mean, let's actually just look at a date here very quickly. And we are moving quite well here. This is 2022, so we're talking we're in 2024, so two years ago actually, and this was edition of one went to Dina Chang here. And look at this. Just a cool. Again, there is pixelation way back then, the same kind of consistent experimentation and what I would call radical approach to the digital art, for lack of a better term, to art making, to image making with pixels, to uncharted pixels.
00:06:42.595 - 00:07:11.575, Speaker A: And so it looks like almost like the equivalent of a PFP project. Pretty radical work here, this last one, really. You know what I love about it is the simplicity and it gives you something to grab onto representationally. So even a kid could go, oh, that's a cloud. But that's a pretty radical cloud. Right. And how would a kid react? How would a child react to that work? It's interesting.
00:07:11.575 - 00:07:22.105, Speaker A: So I'll just say super. Another artist on Tezos. Shall we check. Okay. The link tree. We'll check very, very quickly. If there's a website.
00:07:22.105 - 00:07:39.565, Speaker A: Is there a website? Wow, look at. Yeah, look at all of these. So there's a ton. So you can check it out online on Zora, on hen Neo ort I haven't heard of. So just a really cool artist. So continuing on. Lily Illo.
00:07:39.565 - 00:07:55.575, Speaker A: Thank you for the. I think it's a portrait. Traveling Pokebelly. And here it reminded me of you in your Airbnb trying to be quiet to film us another show, wishing to be in the sun and thinking about ancient times. Yeah. So thank you. I am going to be on the road actually, pretty quickly.
00:07:55.575 - 00:08:20.317, Speaker A: I'm not sure. I may end up in Bangkok in a week, insanely. We'll see what happens. There still haven't more details on that later, but I will be in Rome in a couple of weeks. I was going to leave the 15th, but I may have to leave sooner. Actually. More details on that coming up.
00:08:20.317 - 00:08:35.477, Speaker A: So I'm going to be on the road again soon, all to say so happily. And so thank you. Traveling Pokebelly. So I love it. And there I am. Kind of looks like Crete actually in the background, which is where I was filming, so quietly. So thank you.
00:08:35.477 - 00:08:53.787, Speaker A: I mean, huge honor. And I love. Actually, let's just bring this up close. I love. I mean, it's almost got a Picasso type feel to it, the way these fills come in and these different colors and the lines. I mean, it's. It's almost hard to, you know, remember that this is AI art.
00:08:53.787 - 00:09:23.989, Speaker A: There is a true kind of organic feel to it. And should I ever don glasses, I probably won't see in this image because I Think it makes you look about 10 or 20 years older, doesn't it? But anyway, love it. And I love actually what's going on in the lenses. And I think that does kind of look a little bit like my profile. Hilariously. There's a Decurico. Shall I show the Decirico de Kiriko in Moma? It is pretty funny.
00:09:23.989 - 00:09:47.095, Speaker A: I've taken a picture with it. Portrait. Auto portrait as they call it in Italian, I think. Here it is. This is quite hilarious. And then we'll go on with our show here. If you do this, I think, you know, it is kind of funny, the similarity.
00:09:47.095 - 00:10:05.015, Speaker A: I got a picture of myself right here with it. Anyways, kind of a classic Italian. Or at least my cousin has the same profile, let's put it that way. Let's continue. Great show today, November 1914. Tornado Rodriguez translating. Should be rad.
00:10:05.015 - 00:10:31.955, Speaker A: Really thrilled to get NUV 1914 on the show. So looking forward to that. That is at 9:30am New York time, 2:30 in Europe for the next week until the time change happens in the. The North America. So all to say, a slightly different time here in Europe, same time in North America. So looking forward to that. And also after that we're going to have Andre Breton's second manifesto of surrealism.
00:10:31.955 - 00:10:52.385, Speaker A: I started reading it, I didn't realize how long it was. And it's kind of funny. Andre Breton, like the first 20 pages is him ranting about his enemies. It's almost like he's drunk, which is. I was quite. This isn't what I remember. You know, maybe I only read the first manifesto when I was studying.
00:10:52.385 - 00:11:11.707, Speaker A: So we'll see where it goes. I'm about a third the way through it. So after this show I'm going to pick it back up and run through it. But not what I was expecting. So anyways, that should be great. You're going to have Santiago, you're going to have Marcel Muntianu and 1 of 1, Tim at 1 of 1 and Runetoon. So that should be radio.
00:11:11.707 - 00:11:24.555, Speaker A: Go to the comments. And again, thank you for the wonderful support on the show here. Let us check the comments. Ariel Presti. Thanks for sharing, Adrian. No matter the length of the video, it will always add value to the community. Thank you.
00:11:24.555 - 00:11:45.367, Speaker A: It is a constant balance here between making. Yeah. Of trying to keep things short because I think the shorter it is, the more kind of commercial in a good way. Like the more accessible. I think people see 90 minutes. Like who are new and they go. Or who maybe just see it on YouTube and go, Whoa, that's too long for me.
00:11:45.367 - 00:11:55.559, Speaker A: Some people love the long, though, you know, so it's an interesting thing. Jim. Hey, don't worry much about the time of the videos. Thank you, Jim. I often watch in chunks. I'm sure other. Others do too.
00:11:55.559 - 00:12:27.569, Speaker A: I know you've probably got loads of stuff to do on. Loads of other stuff on too, but have you considered setting up a Patreon? And I'm really glad you mentioned this, actually. Someone reached out to do a sponsorship of Art and I. So I had to think about all this this weekend because I want to. I said, give me a couple of days to reply and I decided against it for now. As far as the sponsorship, I was saying basically before the comments. I'm open to it in theory, but I'm.
00:12:27.569 - 00:13:01.431, Speaker A: I'm not sure. I'm just kind of like not sure. And do I want art there or would I like something like more kind of almost like a blockchain, for example, rather than bringing in art. And then all of a sudden, at the start of the show, you don't control all of a sudden the what's going on, you know, from an artistic perspective. And then new people come in, they see that and then they're thinking, okay, this is the show, right? So Patreon, I love the idea. I have a friend who is. Does hi fi audio YouTube that I met here this summer in Berlin, has a big YouTube channel.
00:13:01.431 - 00:13:26.531, Speaker A: He's like, you must do Patreon. You should also turn on the ads on YouTube is what he's saying, which I may do. So I'll probably start with Patreon. And I think there's a lot of creative ways that I can make it fun and even do like a drop, like once a month, this sort of thing. Nothing too extensive, but even put, you know, it's an opportunity to put in stuff I might not release otherwise too. And I could even just. Yeah.
00:13:26.531 - 00:13:47.627, Speaker A: So I want to experiment with Patreon. That is what I'm going to do. I am going to do that. So watch this space. I want to set it up properly, you know, because once you start taking money, then all of a sudden you don't want to start changing things, if you know what I mean. So it may take a few weeks, maybe sooner. I may take a few weeks to set it up.
00:13:47.627 - 00:14:03.675, Speaker A: I'll definitely let you know. Thank you for asking. I'm sure many viewers would happily pay a small monthly fee to help you out and ensure you keep making the content invaluable. Thank you very much. Jim really appreciate that comment. Rata Yankee Very awesome selection sir. Thank you.
00:14:03.675 - 00:14:31.647, Speaker A: It's a testament to what is happening out here on the Internets. Thank you. Always awesome to hear from you. Rada Eric7004 this looks so interesting so perhaps a new fish that we have reeled in here. Welcome Eric's Axia Area Area area area times area awesome episode as always. Thank you Lord Misfit thank you for the for the comment Mr. James Glow Adrian Another wonderful, wonderful episode.
00:14:31.647 - 00:14:46.121, Speaker A: I do like the longer episodes so please don't feel the pressure to get them under an hour. Josh awesome to hear. I appreciate that. Rata Yankee salute. Keep fighting the good fight. Awesome to hear. Probably referring to the time of the show.
00:14:46.121 - 00:15:22.535, Speaker A: Renki thanks. Awesome to hear. So Renki, here it is. I've gotten a few comments from Renki and I find it hilarious because it's been like two years and it's just really great to hear from Renki. Rad artist almost on every show I don't think in this one but almost on every show there a really cool artist on Tazos our gourdan this was helpful. Cellular automata are a thing so I may have been completely wrong about Canxapita being like putting it through a cell phone. It may be referred to as like some sort of biological thing like cellular automata.
00:15:22.535 - 00:16:02.095, Speaker A: Let's see as in Conway's Game of Life. Not sure if that's what Canexapita is using to create the work in the beginning though some of the underlying pixelated patterns looks like they could be derived from certain automata patterns. I don't really know what automata are would be very interested to know if or how they they were used to create that piece. It's wonderful regardless. So I mentioned on last show that Kanek Zapata I was going to invite Kanexapita onto a space and kanexapita already said I'd love to come on so fabulous. I haven't figured out a time yet because I'm traveling and I'm not sure. I need to see if this what going on with this Bangkok thing.
00:16:02.095 - 00:16:30.527, Speaker A: But once that's figured out I will reach out to Canxapita and schedule a date and maybe we'll get some more information here on what we mean by cellular automata. You probably know more than I do on this. Also on Twitter Blue Ally and thank you. I can't go through all of this but I will go through a little bit of it. So glad you're back on Monday after hitting the wall. I Hit a wall myself. Monday's discussion on digital brushwork was fascinating.
00:16:30.527 - 00:17:16.659, Speaker A: I've always considered physical brushwork as the brushwork, as the pinnacle of the line, as fluid movement. A physically drawn line, like those done by master calligraphers, for example, is a done, be it Stiller, curving. So, yeah, we were talking about the brushstroke, and I was commenting, like. And I was thinking about this too, because that definitely resonated with people, this sense of what is happening with brushstrokes. And yeah, it's interesting. Again, as I was saying, it's like controlled chaos. And so you have, you know, I think what's going on, speculating to myself out loud, you know, is I think it's like ordered chaos, right? And that is the contrast.
00:17:16.659 - 00:17:55.213, Speaker A: You have order because there's intent and meaning behind a brushstroke, but when it's just purely done and perfectly done with no chaos in it, there's no contrast in a sense, within this idea of order and chaos, within the context of order and chaos. Put it this way. Let me say it from the other perspective. When you have randomness in meaning and intent in order, when you have chaos in the order, you get contrast. That is my take on why brushstrokes, generally speaking, look inherently good. And then when you. Or.
00:17:55.213 - 00:18:21.723, Speaker A: And then adding another kind of more evidence to the thesis here, if you think of Sigmar Polka, what do you have? It's a different kind. It's layering. And so you get a random pattern underneath. Let's say bed sometimes uses sheets, you know, with prints on it. And then paints over top and puts the projector over top. And you get all of the. So what do you have? You start to have kind of randomness in.
00:18:21.723 - 00:18:53.283, Speaker A: Hey, I'm just putting down whatever pattern, although not completely random, it's a pattern, but whatever is underneath. And then putting something on top and you get a juxtaposition of, you know, non intent and intent or non planned kind of image making with planned image making. And then you get contrast. And. And I'd argue ultimately it's a kind of, you know, to be super cosmic about it. It's kind of order and chaos is what's going on here. So I.
00:18:53.283 - 00:19:24.087, Speaker A: And wasn't getting the trueness of the stroke. Just go through a couple more lines here. The trueness of the stroke, influenced by each artist's hands and breathing in, was what thrills me about fine calligraphy and physical painting, for example, almost what I would call the intent. I'm not getting that gush of Beauty from what you're calling digital brushwork. Although I do love Canxa you started with on the Canex Aputa you started with on Monday's show. It is fascinating, especially to the eye, but I find Digital Pixels leaves me wanting that unctuous flow that physical painting, especially oils, can give us. The sensuality is missing for me.
00:19:24.087 - 00:19:51.385, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. It may be an acquired taste because there it is. Definitely a journey over here. And I think Blue is from the last couple of months, if I'm not mistaken. And great to hear from you. And so it might be an acquired taste, you know, with this idea of the sumptuousness of these crispy pixels, so to speak. Anyway, thank you for the comment here and beautiful piece here.
00:19:51.385 - 00:20:00.429, Speaker A: Let's continue in De Taste. Such a great episode. Thank you. Great to hear from you. To Taste. I think we have a work by De Taste actually the show Aria. My favorite show right now.
00:20:00.429 - 00:20:14.095, Speaker A: Thank you. This is fabulous. Great to hear. Aria and Andre, great show as usual. I also appreciate you showcasing my work. Quite busy in real life, but I nearly completed that artwork. So I hear you.
00:20:14.095 - 00:20:25.147, Speaker A: And here we have color added to that work we saw last time. So another work in progress. Thank you. Andre, great to hear from you. Jada, amazing show. Thank you. Conehead Squid.
00:20:25.147 - 00:20:52.785, Speaker A: Wonderful show. I'm sharing here the post from NFT Protector about on chain minting compatible with all existing object contracts. I believe this is what you're referring to. I was there is a there should be just a form. I thought there was a easier way of doing it and I think there was just a form. Here it is Connect wallet and here are some ways of doing and here's the latest on chain minting. So I may experiment with this.
00:20:52.785 - 00:21:21.525, Speaker A: There's not that many. Interestingly that's on Tezos. Now the thing is looking at costs of on chain minting, it is hard to justify Tezos right now. As I think Luke500 was saying, it's about a third of a Tezos which is about let's call it 25 cents. Let's call it 20. 25 cents. Bitcoin's at 2V bytes despite the price rise at least when I looked this morning.
00:21:21.525 - 00:21:51.857, Speaker A: If we go to the mempool and I still need to make a video. People have been asking me to make a video to put art on bitcoin here it's up to six. But I mean as you see here, even an hour ago is at 2, which is pretty cheap. That's like maybe 50 cents, 60 cents. So it's hard to justify. It's only double to put it on bitcoin so yeah but this is super helpful because I may want to put some work onto Tezos as well just for fun. Dylan Great to hear from you.
00:21:51.857 - 00:22:05.541, Speaker A: I think we have a piece by Dylan this episode. Genericist just counted. I have nine tabs with previous journals on pause so thank you genresis for the comment and the support. Pedro Jose Perfect. Just in time. Artist journal and coffee. Great to hear.
00:22:05.541 - 00:22:36.889, Speaker A: I do the same thing. Your kind of digital coffee meeting here and crypto king quality programming and here's a new mint rat cloak vibes with hat anonymous work. A little bit does have a little bit of the rat cloak vibe to it doesn't it? Kind of that isolation so to speak. Thanks for posting 369 thank you for the comment. Luciana Guerra Neural Divine Also thank you for the comments. Pinball Guy this was fascinating. Really another wonderful thing to hear.
00:22:36.889 - 00:23:16.715, Speaker A: I think this observation on Canxapita's work just made me a better artist. Well this is thank you for posting that Pinball Guy that is exciting know I wonder because again I'm not sure I would have had any of those thoughts had I not been really having this conversation with the art and with this community. So it is a win win. And so yeah me having to ratiocinate through it does it helps me too. And I'm just thrilled to hear that that is. That is kind of what we're going for over here, right? I mean if the show can help the art. Well isn't that a magical situation.
00:23:16.715 - 00:23:36.655, Speaker A: Artist Journal community and we will quickly go through here. Marcel Mentiano so some I think these are GLBs that are here they are self portrait so very cool here. Posted by Vicky thank you. Someone's already Halloween ready indeed. Ready to trick or treat here. Hilarious. Ariel New series unlocked and we will take a look at this.
00:23:36.655 - 00:24:04.055, Speaker A: I brought this up in the illustration section. Thank you for posting. I love these kind of works. These kind of I call it contemporary illustration. These kind of modern day still lifes with computers. I think nobody does it better in my opinion than the digital illustrators. I would argue it's a whole kind of and there are hidden works on tazos that are some of my favorite works of all time.
00:24:04.055 - 00:24:16.295, Speaker A: I'll have to bring those out sometime in this spirit. Yeah, hidden away. Let's see. Yeah. Anyway thank you for posting. We'll take another look later. And this is also thank you for posting.
00:24:16.295 - 00:24:35.103, Speaker A: Austin I brought this up in the pixel art Section Mono Destr. An exploration of multiple identity disorder through catatonic pixel art. So we will take a look. Cool. Pixel art again from Austin, Greg Nikshumika. I'm doing this part. I'm doing my part bringing more artists to Tezos.
00:24:35.103 - 00:24:48.291, Speaker A: Check out the works by Ilyin Misha. So interesting. Kind of more conceptual here. A little bit of text and some pixelation. Very cool. Thank you for posting. And Tornado Rodriguez posting the process here.
00:24:48.291 - 00:25:06.739, Speaker A: Just love to see these object 98 works. I wonder how you do that. Maybe you take screenshots or maybe there's. I Wonder if the object 98 just does that for you. I know Procreate. I think you can just hit play and it'll kind of recreate. Make one of these in process drawings.
00:25:06.739 - 00:25:35.279, Speaker A: Anyways, looks like a new drop on Tezos from Tornado. And we'll talk to Tornado today on the Space Ni collaboration with Ugodigi. Thank you for posting. This is going to be actually later in the show too. Thanks for bringing that to my attention, Joe. And thank you. A digital painting with Procreate and inspired by the line and the night seems to go on incredibly long from the song Theme from the Bottom by Fish, who I think are kind of in the tradition of Grateful Dead, if I'm not mistaken.
00:25:35.279 - 00:26:03.011, Speaker A: I think they just did like a. I never really listened to Fish, but I think they just did a big like not a homage concert, but basically not a tribute. Maybe a tribute concert to Phil Lush who I think is from the Grateful Dead for like I think medical expenses, which is quite nice. So anyways, beautiful work there. I could see how the that kind of music would inspire that work. Strange Thing. This is super cool actually.
00:26:03.011 - 00:26:17.283, Speaker A: I brought this up in a later tab. I always loved the physical renditions. We'll take a look at this in a second. Thank you for posting. Strange Things. Some behind the scenes moments of the solo show opening tomorrow in Rome. Epically good for Strange Thing.
00:26:17.283 - 00:26:36.505, Speaker A: Echoes of the Interface collection of 6x8 each minted on October 29th. So pretty cool. Kind of those kind of vertical pixels that you sometimes see. Nice render there. Mr. Reero Tezos Tuesday so Golden Pog kind of looks like a Tezos coin. Very cool.
00:26:36.505 - 00:26:52.145, Speaker A: Thanks for posting. Ernesto Ash thank you for posting. So kind of a big abstract here. Digital Abstract 369 thank you for posting and my hope you enjoy it. And I believe this is on Tezos. Enter me on Tezos. Cool.
00:26:52.145 - 00:27:17.879, Speaker A: Almost looks like AI. I can't tell though. And here Luke500 thank you for posting the poll and everything captured in Microsoft 3D. So a ton of work here. I think we might have seen this by area and Fatima with a Digital Drawing and Luke500 with another work post on. Quite interesting. Luke500 is totally on the scene.
00:27:17.879 - 00:27:54.865, Speaker A: If this was a real newspaper, so to speak, Luke500 would probably be the first hire as far as reporting. So thank you for posting that. Ilya Bliznets Hey Artist journal and here and actually we have a work by don't buy cool collaboration by Ilya Blizznets and don't buy and that takes us through the community. Here we are. Look at this. So l survey my favorite hidden ignored X account Undeservedly ignored. One of my favorite accounts could be an editor I would argue posted this art Daily Historic DC Comics Collection.
00:27:54.865 - 00:28:13.985, Speaker A: Let's see if I can make this bigger. This is a very old website. Historic DC Comics collection shatters records at Heritage auction surpassing $5.26 million in unprecedented event. And I've never even seen this one before. Double Action Comics January 1940. Number two.
00:28:13.985 - 00:28:38.455, Speaker A: Maybe. Maybe it rings a bell. It makes you wonder, was this before Action Comics number one? Of course. The first appearance of Superman, I believe that's 39. So like, what is that right? Double action. And you just see the charm, the genius of the design of these works. Like the modern day comics don't even like hold a candle.
00:28:38.455 - 00:28:57.897, Speaker A: In my opinion. You don't even see them anymore because people have stopped buying them. I would argue these, like, these are. If you put this on the newsstand today, I think they would sell like, they're gorgeous. Anyway, let's continue. Let's just get a quick understanding of what happened here. Wow.
00:28:57.897 - 00:29:37.061, Speaker A: Dallas, Texas. That's how DC Studio. Wow. That's how DC Studios co chief and Superman writer James Gunn reacted over the weekend to a Vermont Public Radio story about Christine Farrell and her lifelong quest to collect every DC Comics ever published. But it might just as well have been a response to Heritage's initial auction of Farrell's legendary and once mysterious assemblage, which surpassed all expectations, bringing in $5 million. When it ended, there wasn't a single comic left on the spinner rack. Nearly 1800 bidders worldwide collected every one of the 489 comics and original works of art offered in the October auction.
00:29:37.061 - 00:30:09.695, Speaker A: And many of those historic books set auction records, which comes as no surprise to Heritage Auctions VP Lon Allen. Christie's journey Together these iconic comics has gifted us not only a legendary collection, but also Christine's. But Also a moment to celebrate the rich legacy of comic history. Watching so many of her pieces find new homes was truly special, and we're grateful to Christine for her vision and thrilled by the extraordinary excitement from collectors. The auction and those that follow will be remembered for years to come. Anyways, let's look at the works here. Here's some highlights.
00:30:09.695 - 00:30:40.409, Speaker A: So a fine 1938. So it's 1938, Action Comics number one with the first appearance of Superman. There are 81 copies that sold for 324,000. That doesn't sound like a real crazy price for action comics number one. And fine pharrell's copy of flash comics number one. Fine place second in the momentous auction for $174,000. So flash number one, more fun comics number 52.
00:30:40.409 - 00:30:59.835, Speaker A: I think the first appearance of the specter. It is featuring the debut of the specter that sold for a heart. That like this is classic comics. Golden age comics here. And let's see what else here. New adventure comics number 27. Not sure what that was.
00:30:59.835 - 00:31:26.431, Speaker A: So. So, yeah, a bidding war over this trophy. Let's very, very quickly here. New adventure comics number 27. Let's just see what that is. What is this? And I don't even really. Yeah, like, what is the.
00:31:26.431 - 00:31:40.974, Speaker A: It's interesting. Maybe it's because it's a mile high. Is because they had great condition. Mile highs are famous for being. This is a mile high comic. So maybe it's just because the condition is like, perfect. So 10 times.
00:31:40.974 - 00:32:21.577, Speaker A: It sold for 10 times more than the comic book's previous watermark, interestingly, or high price. And this is the story here that a lot of works here were getting almost 10x what they were previously valued at. And so again, these mile high. The condition. So all to say, go check out that story if you're into comics. But it's kind of a tale, I guess, to wrap it up here. It's a bit of a tale on the test of time.
00:32:21.577 - 00:32:48.525, Speaker A: Like, these are. You see here how beautiful and charming these works are. And the market, you know, time doing its thing. And here we are, you know, 80 years later, and real appreciation coming in. So more just interesting kind of psychedelic news. And again, this is not some sort of endorsement, by the way. We just follow it here on this show because it's interesting.
00:32:48.525 - 00:33:40.829, Speaker A: Groundbreaking research shows how psilocybin reshapes brain networks. And what is the thesis that we keep seeing over and over is this kind of idea that it kind of creates new neural connections to explain the psychedelic effect, offering Rapid and sustained relief from depression. And keyword, why is it sustained? Right. This study analyzed psilocybin, magic mushrooms versus traditional antidepressants and so increased global integration in the brain after psilocybin therapy for depression. Super interesting. This was another one also posted by Paul Austin posting the stories Elite golfers turning to mushrooms and psychedelics to dominate the PGA Tour. How times have changed, isn't it? A number of these substances do not feature on the World Anti Doping Agency prohibited lists, meaning athletes.
00:33:40.829 - 00:34:01.533, Speaker A: Athletes will not be sanctioned for using them. That is hilarious. So isn't that interesting using ayahuasca. So golfers doing all sorts of crazy things. Okay, Evelyn, Evelyn O. Some sometimes forget. Olin made computer paintings in the 1990s.
00:34:01.533 - 00:34:22.237, Speaker A: And of course I follow Evelyn and. And this is. There's a really big show right now and I brought it up in Hamburg that I have to go to. And for anybody in Germany, you kind of got to go to this show. Albert olin in the 90s was doing these works here. This is a painting, screen print. I believe I've seen some of these in person.
00:34:22.237 - 00:35:02.627, Speaker A: And the way he gets the dithering here is screen printing. But you can see right here that there's painting involved here too. Making what a wonderful contrast, right? You get the order, so to speak, of the pixelation and the geometric rectilinear pixelation. And then you get underneath a little bit of black put in there, maybe bleeding the paint here. And then brush stroke and just a completely different mark making more chaotic but still organized in control. And then that is. They are but more chaotic, you could argue.
00:35:02.627 - 00:35:37.011, Speaker A: And so you have order in the chaos in the paint itself here, which is quite beautiful. But then you have kind of a more chaotic stroke contrasting with what's probably a screen printed pixelation. Right? So we have different contrasts here, contrast within the brush, brush stroke here. But then we have the contrast between this brush stroke and that brush stroke or this screen printing line or screen print action and the brushstroke. So contrast, contrast. Only two colors here in theory, but you have a ton of grays. So just beautiful.
00:35:37.011 - 00:36:12.753, Speaker A: And I brought it up here. Hamburger Kunsthalle Albert Olin and Computer Builder so computer images and from the 1990s, so deserves a lot of credit. And look at how cool these are. Like the compositions are frankly a pretty stunning. It kind of looks like made on a Mac, if I had to guess. And just making again, this is pretty radical because this you could put out today and people would absolutely love it. This came out like 30 years ago that Albert Nolan was working on this.
00:36:12.753 - 00:36:53.335, Speaker A: That's impressive. And even the compositions, they're probably easily my favorite works by him. And look at this. I mean, maybe I wonder if I can make that larger, as you see here. So incorporating kind of painterly lines in here and contrasting that with the crooked right screen printed pixelation, or dithering, shall we call it? Right? And even get slightly different colors here. Kind of like you saw slightly different kind of grays with the black and white and that brushstroke that we're looking at. Just really cool, isn't it? Maybe.
00:36:53.335 - 00:37:37.905, Speaker A: Let's just bring up a couple others here. Look at this. And it's kind of. You know how I was talking about the Kazuhiro Ehara work where not worrying about right in here. That's also what you see here. I would say, like it's not worrying about getting everything kind of beautiful while you're working on it. It's kind of about the process working and trusting the process to a certain degree that as long as I am kind of staying true to my process and my contrast that I kind of have conceptualized here, it's going to work out and don't try and force it and fix it, you know.
00:37:37.905 - 00:38:15.193, Speaker A: And so here it's balanced. But you could argue it's like, well, putting that airbrush there, does that make sense? Would you do that? So just interesting, right? And here you see again, a little bit of grays and brushwork contrasting. Right? Let's look at this huge one. Is that in color? Okay, so this is more other kind of typical Albert Olin work, I think you could say. So it looks like a fantastic show, doesn't it? Just radio rad artworks. Shall we bring this up really quickly? Would work wonderful as prints too, frankly. You know, who wouldn't put that on the wall? Let's continue.
00:38:15.193 - 00:38:44.149, Speaker A: Jedi Wolf. Tokenized art is the most remarkable development I've witnessed in the crypto space since 2016. It truly stands out amid all the noise we're experiencing here. Isn't that interesting? So from someone who sounds like they've been around, you know, there is a lot to be said for this. You know, I've only been here since 2020, but you know, it really does have staying power. I would add to that. Let's continue.
00:38:44.149 - 00:38:53.157, Speaker A: RMILK88 base. Base, base. Oh my God. Base paint on base. Driving me crazy. So we might say the equivalent of object 98 on base. Every day I come and draw something.
00:38:53.157 - 00:39:20.773, Speaker A: Here's a little of what I tried to do I didn't think would be so fun. So very cool. And so you can do pixel art on base in native application base paint xyz. Super cool. And here's an interesting comment. This was referring to this tweet here by seed phrase Art coins are the next meta. So we've been seeing the artcoin discussion, this idea that it's not crazy.
00:39:20.773 - 00:40:05.283, Speaker A: I will give it this. People have talked about the fractionalization of artworks really almost before NFTs even kind of became a thing. Right. I would argue that was almost like the initial model is you have an artwork and then it's kind of fractionalized into a thousand tokens and then you can have partial ownership in this whole thing. Again, I don't think as a collector it's very appealing but it's an you know, you could argue but I would just say if it's the next big trend, the next meta, why hasn't this happened yet? Would be my question. Because I would argue it actually predated to a certain degree at least the big explosion in NFTs. There are like I can't even remember who I was talking to.
00:40:05.283 - 00:40:24.795, Speaker A: I remember being at a show here in Berlin. Anyway, Boot here showing skepticism. Supply gets sniped or bundled runs at first. So these art coins do well at first. Then snipers or bundled wallets dump on the followers of the artists who buy into this coin. Artists post about how there's no plan for this. I was just doing it for fun.
00:40:24.795 - 00:41:11.825, Speaker A: It was just about the art. They send any remaining supply they have to a burn address, make statements about how they. How they've made nothing, only lost money out of pockets for this. Three days later they post about how they regret launching a token will be taking a mental health break. Six months later they post photo of a new BMW on the timeline. So what I see going on here, and I don't know if you sense this too, but I am seeing a fatigue in the crypto space, in the whole altcoin in the next meta and the next oh who's what's going to happen next. And we I am getting a sense of fatigue like sensing a sense of fatigue among the public that people are just kind of not as quick to jump onto this.
00:41:11.825 - 00:41:52.297, Speaker A: And I wonder to myself what that means for the larger crypto space in the next five years. We don't see the same kind of, I would call it idealism that is out there on what these kind of altcoins can do interestingly. And that oh, here's Another trend. And it just seems like people have been. There have been so many attempts at trying to kind of extract money out of this crypto market with whatever scheme. I mean this is the problem. It doesn't feel like a meta anymore, it feels like a scheme, you know, and there's kind of like.
00:41:52.297 - 00:42:18.397, Speaker A: So it's just starting to feel like schemes and you know, these have always existed. But I get the sense that there's a fatigue and there's a sense that the market is wising up. Maybe enough people have lost enough money that they have run out of patience, you know. So anyways, continuing on lb, who of course I follow. Another day, another gm and there the Nintendo Game Boy printer. Look at this. So traveling through the mediums.
00:42:18.397 - 00:42:42.713, Speaker A: Indeed. And what a wonderful, you know, like I'm very excited in gm, of course. Good morning. You know, small works in the physical world are also incredibly exciting too. It's a whole thing. And there's a special way to frame them with a really big mat or passepartout as they call it. And you can turn a little work and you can make it give it big significance by framing it right.
00:42:42.713 - 00:43:03.827, Speaker A: And this is what I see here. Like you can put a little pixel artwork, even the little Nintendo Game Boy and even this. It's like the torn paper on an Andy Warhol print, a screen print, you know. And here's the torn paper. Like there's something very precious looking about this. So this is on Zora. You can pick up the nft.
00:43:03.827 - 00:43:28.155, Speaker A: But I'm kind of like for the physicals. This is super exciting. Very cool. Here is the show that Strange thing was posting solo show opening in Rome. NFT with optional limited edition prints will be available via foundation. So I am going to mute the music in case of copyright. But look at how stunning these prints are.
00:43:28.155 - 00:43:49.485, Speaker A: Studio Groma Italia. So I guess that's who's putting on the show, Studio G. And even doing a nice little stamp there to make it official, interestingly. And look at this. I mean it looks like a movie opening. And look at this. I mean, what a production.
00:43:49.485 - 00:44:08.165, Speaker A: So Rome. So I am going to Rome at least once. Depending on this Bangkok trip. I may go twice if the Bangkok trip doesn't happen. Otherwise I will be in Rome twice. And if it does, I'll be in Rome once. So I will make a point of going to see this show.
00:44:08.165 - 00:44:24.557, Speaker A: Spectacular. Look at that. So nice production from Strange Thing and here's Louis JPD diptych. Check this out. Kind of an interesting look. Like it almost looks like two canvases, doesn't it? So, and even. Especially with the paint on the floor here.
00:44:24.557 - 00:44:41.373, Speaker A: But maybe there's screens. Not sure. Kind of ambiguous. So interesting piece. Edition of 10, 1080 by 1080, 100 frames unknown. Is it physical? Is it digital? So interesting piece by Louis Jpd as we move into the works here. Cedar plank.
00:44:41.373 - 00:44:57.265, Speaker A: A cool million. So did we see this one? Maybe we saw this one. I'm not even sure anymore. October 29th. So it's been minted. Maybe we saw it on. Maybe we saw it on Twitter.
00:44:57.265 - 00:45:13.461, Speaker A: It's all but. But just minted. October 29th here. And so anyways, I think we may have seen this one and we got a few by cedar plank here. No, we didn't. We didn't see that Data. Here's another one because this is definitely new.
00:45:13.461 - 00:45:36.883, Speaker A: And so very interesting piece. Again, using all sorts of different kind of mark making here. Digital mark making as well. Actually, maybe we did see this because I feel like I remember the text. Forgive me if we have seen it, but actually, yeah, I'm confused. I'm not sure if we've seen it or not, but we have. I don't think we've seen this one Circuit.
00:45:36.883 - 00:46:14.079, Speaker A: These are all new mints on object. And again, you see here, look at the. Again, think of Canix Apata. Think of the disruption of the order that we're seeing here. Whether the disruption is in the structure or whether the kind of resolution here is made smaller so it gets of fuzzier the texture, so to speak, and everything. And here it looks like a brush is just kind of a very fun brush is just kind of dragged across. And then here we have repetition of this element here and repetition of this figure here.
00:46:14.079 - 00:46:43.691, Speaker A: And look at. Even at the bottom. So this creates a whole kind of painterliness, right? And it's like I'm kind of back to the order and chaos. It's sort of like with like. It's like a Basquiat, for example, where you see the paint is being painted, but then it drips. Or like many artists, right? And then you see the paint drips onto the canvas. There's order because you can see that, okay, this is from an intended brush stroke.
00:46:43.691 - 00:47:15.725, Speaker A: You know, there is order in what is trying to be done here, even if it's just to paint some color. But then you get these random things that happen, like the brush, like the paint drip, right, which comes and then that becomes like a chaotic element. And this, I would argue, on a certain level is what's creating the beauty part of what's creating the beauty. We love those paint drips. At least I do. Right? And I think there's a reason why often artists will keep them in. It reveals the process, but it's also beautiful.
00:47:15.725 - 00:47:38.845, Speaker A: And again, it's kind of this balancing or this contrasting between order and chaos. So Circuit here by Cedar Plank edition of five. And here's another one. I think we did see this on Twitter. This is now on foundation here. 120 minted, which is pretty good. And here is a new one for sure called Koi.
00:47:38.845 - 00:48:02.365, Speaker A: And let's look at this also on Rodeo. And so cool. Kind of looks like Fantavision right over here. But that Fantavision looks like it is being pasted into other. So, you know, probably browser like softwares here. So, you know, this looks like it's just kind of pasted on top. Right.
00:48:02.365 - 00:48:23.249, Speaker A: So we're getting a contrast between different softwares. Contrasting softwares we could call it. And even here, it's almost like they're looking at their image on the wall, right? Their gif on the wall. These two figures here who are very loosely painted. Pretty interesting. And here are just a couple others. Como by Waffles.
00:48:23.249 - 00:48:40.111, Speaker A: It was just so. I didn't. I felt like I was doing too many waffles here. But it. This one just felt so radical again and so illustrative of a lot of the things we're talking about here. Here you just see the chaos, but intent. Right? The same kind of contrast we see in brush strokes.
00:48:40.111 - 00:49:14.403, Speaker A: We see intent and it's like, okay, clearly this line needs to be here, but there's all these chaotic elements within the bristles of the brush, so to speak. And again, that creates a kind of delight and a kind of serendipity, shall we call it, within the work, where it creates a kind of delight. And what is that? Delight. Right. So and here, I mean, this radical subject matter here, the head in the head. How wild is that? And we have another one. So a little bit of humor here.
00:49:14.403 - 00:49:31.175, Speaker A: Ishoko from Waffles. And then again, it looks like again, contrasting software. Look at this kind of fuzzed out background. Right? Super interesting. Interesting color too. Canxapata. So new work here.
00:49:31.175 - 00:49:51.299, Speaker A: And so a couple of works actually went up on. And I think I brought up the other one too. Good. I did. We'll look at what's going on on object there with the auctions, putting them for auction. The work we started with that I started with on last show. So here, continuing the process.
00:49:51.299 - 00:50:18.805, Speaker A: So it's pretty cool. Like cellular automata. Again, we'll have to ask Kan Xapita on a future space kind of more details on what is meant by that. Is that a cell phone? Is that a biological process? Sounds like some programming is involved. Super interesting, you know, just beautiful. Here's another one. This is at auction and this one is at 30 tazos as we speak here.
00:50:18.805 - 00:50:34.427, Speaker A: And let's just make that large. So again we see a similar process. These beautiful kind of eyes. You almost forget their eyes when you zoom in. Look at these lips here. Wonderful. And I believe what is the other work at? It is at 150.
00:50:34.427 - 00:51:02.207, Speaker A: So it is doing pretty well here with quite a bit of time to go. There is still 6 hours and 46 minutes to go on this work. So this is on object. And apologies to all bidders for highlighting that work. Again, RJ with some interesting works. Internet people, Volume two, nine pieces. So here are so interesting fills and everything here.
00:51:02.207 - 00:51:27.845, Speaker A: So again kind of more using Rand controlled randomness, letting things bleed out a little bit. Magic wand type selection here and letting things bleed out. And again kind of a bit of a. What looks like maybe the stable diffusion, perhaps textures but maybe realized another way. And interesting framing here. Right. Look at the negative space on the green.
00:51:27.845 - 00:51:42.277, Speaker A: So a few of these coming out. This one a gif. This was pretty cool. A smaller work. Let's see if we can. And a pretty original art piece here. And again just you see these kind of so using AI, I believe.
00:51:42.277 - 00:51:58.787, Speaker A: And also all sorts of again kind of textures and maybe even AI animation here. 512 by 512. Nice and small. Dr. Lee NFT picking it up at 140 tazos. Nice pickup. And continuing on 1011.
00:51:58.787 - 00:52:24.257, Speaker A: RJ. And this is also by RJ. So another work in this series here. And this one's a lot larger as you can see. And interesting kind of textures again being brought in here. And how big is this? 3,500 by 3,500. But looks like so keeping in a sense the JPEG artifacts so to speak on this.
00:52:24.257 - 00:52:42.643, Speaker A: And interesting, interesting, interesting. And here you get some gray around. And so Internet people, another interesting cutoff here on the edge there. Interesting colors too. Edition of one selling for 80. And here's another one slightly different process. Edition of one.
00:52:42.643 - 00:53:13.417, Speaker A: And here we see again the fill put over top of some of these, you know, renders so to speak. Using AI as the compositional tool, I believe. And here's this great love this composition at the bottom. The square computer coming in geometrically again. Contrast Contrasting with the kind of, you know, organic head here. So cool work there. Here's Skomra with continued cool work also here.
00:53:13.417 - 00:53:36.205, Speaker A: In this case using stable diffusion, textual inversion. And interesting portrait here. A little even some pixelation here. So interesting progress on both artists fronts there. And edding mattress. Three of hearts, two of spades, king spades. So more trading cards or a playing cards, I should say, with math over top.
00:53:36.205 - 00:53:56.645, Speaker A: Interesting juxtaposition. And also looks like some layer styling and looks like almost linear burn there or color burn. And interesting, interesting. And look at this, these original playing cards. And look at the ASCII just barely put on here. Maybe some visual ASCII over here. Right? This is visual ascii.
00:53:56.645 - 00:54:30.059, Speaker A: I think so. Continuing to just experiment and push things around here too. This is also an egg mattress. And as you see, it's like two paintings in one. Or you see this selection here, looks like it's over here, but it's almost like the visual ASCII was put over top, but then it was used for these areas here. But then it was used as just a mask instead of keeping it. Then it was just used as a way to cut out areas, creating almost a kind of, you know, pixelation effect or pixelated mask.
00:54:30.059 - 00:54:56.001, Speaker A: And then you have here almost like a selection, kind of a magic wand type selection here. And quite a. But maybe it's just ascii, small ASCII that's been removed interestingly. And look at down here in the shadow and there leaving the trail a little bit. And here it looks like a close up. So wild, wild piece here by a horse painting. Modified, modified by ASCII elements.
00:54:56.001 - 00:55:42.629, Speaker A: Super interesting. Here's URI J with a work posted on X and looking like almost like eyes here and looking kind of like the uri J with four Js afterwards series kind of the more experimental account where you see these kind of abstractions and sometimes you'll see different variations on certain shapes here. Not sure if it's new or not, but here you can see all of the kind of detail and action that goes into a urij. Basically reproducible, right? Unreproducible, irreproducible work here. Super interesting. Here's NUV 1914 who again will be on the space Lehano. So more experimental, challenging work here.
00:55:42.629 - 00:56:06.285, Speaker A: Kind of has an abstract feeling, but here we see a person seemingly so, not entirely abstract. So kind of a combination of abstract and figurative elements and all sorts of things. Addition of 8 for 13 tezos. One sold to might be bonesy. Interesting piece. And here's a great work as well. This is by Dan Controlled composition.
00:56:06.285 - 00:56:19.319, Speaker A: Batteries. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Love the color. Brilliant green in the background. And then again just having fun. Really. Again, witty works here with the batteries.
00:56:19.319 - 00:56:30.311, Speaker A: Interesting shape. Almost makes a snail. Maybe that's accidental. Very cool. And here's another kind of wildwork. Scotch whiskey. This is by Dan Control 2.
00:56:30.311 - 00:56:46.827, Speaker A: This was just put on tazos. Now I'm trying to figure out. This looks like an artist at work here. You see this huge work. This is like the paintbrush. I probably have to minimize that. It kind of looks like a painting being worked on here.
00:56:46.827 - 00:57:03.771, Speaker A: And here you see a little bit of the. Whatever you call it that the. The what you put the painting on. The wooden thing that you put the painting on. The word's escaping me right now. And here. So you see a painting in a painting.
00:57:03.771 - 00:57:18.943, Speaker A: In a painting I guess you could call it and. Or the. Like a painter painting from their perspective. So kind of interesting. Always interesting conceptually. Dan control edition of 22 gone at 20 tazos. Here is the myth.
00:57:18.943 - 00:57:45.131, Speaker A: The myth dresses in fashion. Loving the humor from the myth in the last few weeks. It is very fun. And indeed the myth dresses in fashion. And there is TM perhaps the myth and a Nike Nike hat. And beautiful light gray kind of light blue gray background color off the charts. Again.
00:57:45.131 - 00:58:06.265, Speaker A: There's something kind of oil painterly about myths work. Like there is just this kind of still significance is what I'd be tempted to call it beautiful. This sold out at nine tezos. Each addition of 15. Nice work. Here is the myth and Mikey Wilson. And so a myth son.
00:58:06.265 - 00:58:28.023, Speaker A: With Mikey Wilson as the subject. And here almost looking like the Microsoft paintwork and some funky clouds in the background. V for vanguard and the balaclava. Kind of a combination of old and new, seemingly. So this is an edition of one and that sold for 160 tazos. Nice sale. And here is another work by the myth.
00:58:28.023 - 00:58:40.008, Speaker A: A pink mask. And this is on surreal app Sur app. So cool. Almost that wrestler mask. This time in pink with the clouds on top. This was hilarious. Failed artist 99.
00:58:40.008 - 00:58:58.115, Speaker A: And this was only 10 cents. And Wasteman Gold Minovich repent. The end is nigh. And here you see kind of a uncare well. You see the outlines not as kind of. Let's. Let's call it not as carefully painted as it normally, I'm sure.
00:58:58.115 - 00:59:24.155, Speaker A: All on purpose, of course. Quite beautiful, I might add how the outlines don't necessarily match up here. And here we see the failed artist with a Repent. The end is nigh and a little half eaten Hot dog. Incredible. And there we see even just the way it's painted seems to echo the subject matter. So quite a Beautiful work.
00:59:24.155 - 00:59:35.179, Speaker A: Only 10 cents and love the humor. Failed artist 99. Great concept. WYWH. This is the taste. So we do have a work by the taste here. Cool painting.
00:59:35.179 - 00:59:47.725, Speaker A: A digital painting by the taste. And perhaps a self portrait. Not sure. Pink Floyd on the T shirt. Nice piece. Kind of a ominous dark, stormy background. Addition of one.
00:59:47.725 - 01:00:10.391, Speaker A: Only five tazos. One bid has come in from district 468. And here's Moda Mt being a count in Florence. So pretty fun work here from Moda Mt. Almost a renaissance feeling to it, especially in the composition here. A little bit of texture in the background and there I believe is Moda Mt. And so really nicely painted here.
01:00:10.391 - 01:00:44.817, Speaker A: As you see around the hair and even all through here. It almost has a renaissance feel to it, doesn't it? It definitely does in the composition and even the way it's painted here. Just quite beautifully done here. Another kind of beautiful oil painting I want to say in digital form. And there is a signature, even the this idea of putting the ledge here and the city in the background. Very cool. Here is Gregorio Zanardi and this is on Superware digital painting.
01:00:44.817 - 01:00:58.057, Speaker A: Let me just kill that and let's see if we can zoom in. And we can. And so pretty cool painting. Kind of nice distortions here. Again, digital painting. We've seen some physicals from Gregorio. Nice colors here.
01:00:58.057 - 01:01:19.735, Speaker A: The red of the tie matching this kind of floor or background color here. Huge hand. Interesting again, portrait. Suburban man goes about his routine not knowing that his life will end. So very cool Digital illustration by Gregorio Zanardi. And a. I don't think there's a reserve on that.
01:01:19.735 - 01:01:51.247, Speaker A: And here Masha say, never seen this artist before. Calm in the storm. So interesting kind of again kind of has an oil paint feel to it. Huge work here as you see, I believe a digital painting. Pretty interesting in the background there too. A lot of kind of work on this interesting composition. Someone drinking tea with almost this broken teacup with almost kind of blood almost leaking from this broken teacup or the band aid.
01:01:51.247 - 01:02:21.541, Speaker A: So a bit of a surreal feeling to it. Interesting piece. 222 tazos that is on at auction and that is reserve open for first bid. Here's Dylan beginning the journey of a thousand miles. Begins with a single step. So looking off into the distance. Almost like a digital woodcut kind of feel to it here and there we see some ants that this beautifully colored subject is looking on to here.
01:02:21.541 - 01:02:41.391, Speaker A: And here again you see almost kind of a reference to the physical. And here and perhaps some digital paper. Not sure. Cool work edition of 1 for 20 tazos. Nice portrait. Daniel W Uninvited. So a bit on the Halloween theme here perhaps.
01:02:41.391 - 01:03:14.343, Speaker A: Although Daniel W. Has done a lot of horror and as you see here, someone peeking in a window here of what looks like an empty room. And again always like the plugin here. Little details very carefully thought through here. And again, yeah, can I I see Sigmar Polka when I see this interesting and beautiful kind of print. Benday dot texture there. And there is a signature 3 Tezos edition of 35 Uninvited.
01:03:14.343 - 01:03:37.671, Speaker A: Cool. Nice colors there too. Here is Lewis Osborne with a kind of a totally different kind of work here. As you see it kind of looks like phones but they are doors and maybe someone trying to break in or not sure. Tap tap. Who's there? We should all take necessary extra steps to keep our grails safe from scammers. A good point.
01:03:37.671 - 01:03:52.207, Speaker A: So keep your work safe. 31019 remaining. Nice work. So this is On Seas IO. So never heard. I don't maybe the memes. Maybe that's the 6529 thing.
01:03:52.207 - 01:04:19.509, Speaker A: Not sure. Nice piece from Louis Osborne. Here's Ariel Presti in the beginning. So again super cool contemporary illustration here. Interestingly with almost retro tv. Here it is a retro TV and here it almost looks like an Ariel Presti work but done with a bit more brushwork rather than pixelation. And here an old keyboard, PlayStation controller, a couple of pedals maybe.
01:04:19.509 - 01:04:28.813, Speaker A: Not sure. Really rad work here. Thank you for sending me one. That is awesome. In the beginning. 1500 by 1500. Love it.
01:04:28.813 - 01:05:07.335, Speaker A: Here is Katarina create devil edition of 30 and cool kind of simple work here with the kind of fuzzy devil in the background making the shadow. So cool work there. And great distortion here with a huge arm smoking the cigarette. Smaller head, huge arm. And so just really again kind of cool stylized work here from Katarina Create. Great color John Carroll window still life number 122. So another Halloween work as you can see from the cat and the cape I think and the horns and perhaps the colors.
01:05:07.335 - 01:05:30.683, Speaker A: And there's Gatorade hilariously for the orange. And 666 on the alarm clock there. Pretty cool. And that is 134 tezos on secondary and accepting an offer from for 115 tezos. So just a super loyal collector base For John Carroll. And here is Ugodici and NI Petrov. And we saw this briefly in the community here.
01:05:30.683 - 01:05:52.617, Speaker A: So this is on foundation and this is on eth. And here is the work. So we see kind of Ugodigi's style, maybe put over top of the illustration of Kny Petrov and his auction starting at 0.3. Or buy now for 0.5 ETH. Interesting kind of location as the title. So cool work there.
01:05:52.617 - 01:06:14.151, Speaker A: And it kind of looks like a policeman and maybe some sailors, if I had to guess. Or other police people. Not sure. Interesting collab. Here is Nicholas Dietrich in Fake Whale Lab for Education. And here a bit more of a detailed work here by Nicholas Dietrich. Kind of has a slightly different feel in a sense.
01:06:14.151 - 01:06:55.715, Speaker A: I feel like it's higher resolution or something, but maybe it's just the color, because usually Nicholas Dietrich uses fewer colors. So it has kind of a bit different feel to it. It's cool in the sense that all of a sudden you see kind of a different kind of feel on Nicholas Dietrich's work. And here is that orb that we saw on previous, I think, in the previous episode. So I believe we're using the element. And even here it almost looks like kind of fuzzed out a little bit in a good way. Playing with that whole kind of illusionism and weird kind of perspective here, full of mystery, is what I can say with any kind of certainty here.
01:06:55.715 - 01:07:17.011, Speaker A: That's the one thing I can say with certainty on this very interesting piece. I think we were seeing this being built, didn't we? I think I saw the works in progress. We saw the orb, we saw this. Interesting again. Dental lab or scientific lab. Antiseptic, interesting color choices. Lab for education.
01:07:17.011 - 01:07:31.309, Speaker A: Purpose to be rediscovered. Sounds like maybe Nicholas Dietrich. Maybe the purpose is meant to be enigmatic here. And forgone Atentazos. That's on object. Element Li. Super minimal pixel art.
01:07:31.309 - 01:08:00.565, Speaker A: Vegetables, online drawing and grayscale. Online drawing and grayscale. And here is probably the model that it's taken from. Interestingly, not worrying about keeping the scale of the works, just taking, you know, pixel art works really well. I put a few still lives on Bitcoin and it just works beautifully for stuff like this. Super interesting as ever from Element Li. Figments, all from Null.
01:08:00.565 - 01:08:35.855, Speaker A: So interesting minimal piece here from Kappen, also known as Figments. With a little bit of animation here as this figure kind of gets vaporized almost in the void. All from null edition of 163 gone at 16 tazos. And here obtainer locked in and it's almost like you see the same software that sometimes figments might use here in this kind of RGB cycling. I'm just theorizing here. I don't know. But kind of a similar quality in this art.
01:08:35.855 - 01:08:53.685, Speaker A: So it makes you wonder, oh, are they using. I think, if I remember right, Kapan was saying, uses GIMP for the animation. So I wonder if that's gimp. I don't know. Petsky Cola. This is pretty cool. And this is on.
01:08:53.685 - 01:09:15.145, Speaker A: This is on Instagram. And as you see, kind of a. I'd say like a mix of pet ski and pixel art, right? Kind of interesting mix here. Like you see here, it's like petscii. But then I guess these are all technically, you know, this is probably a slash. This is a line. I guess this could theoretically be all text.
01:09:15.145 - 01:09:30.879, Speaker A: And maybe this is visual ASCII here. This kind of checkerboard ascii. So interesting piece. Hey, Ada, Here is another Halloween work, paranormal from P1. Mandel. And not a number. I wonder if this is a game.
01:09:30.879 - 01:09:49.621, Speaker A: Crazy. I didn't even know this. I mean, amazing, right? Maybe I'll make that full screen. Incredible. What kid would not love this? Incredible. That is so cool. That is six tazos.
01:09:49.621 - 01:10:05.905, Speaker A: That is an addition of 30 from these incredibly talented people. Artwork by Manadal. I think the audio probably by P1 and the code by Not a Number. Making it all happen. SFX by P1. Incredible work here. Here's Manadil again on Rodeo.
01:10:05.905 - 01:10:29.005, Speaker A: And here, just a rad fun work with a cat in a basket. Who doesn't love that? And look at the cool animation with the bird going across at a different speed. Very cool there. Here's Pomelo. Pomelo the City. Pretty cool kind of pixel art painting here. I just love the helicopter.
01:10:29.005 - 01:10:47.585, Speaker A: Pretty amazing work here from Pomelo. Wild composition, super creative. And a whale going through the sky there. Chaos in the City. Made with Ace sprite edition of 20. Only a Tezos 50 and almost gone. There are seven left.
01:10:47.585 - 01:11:05.525, Speaker A: Continuing on, we have Tradscape, who of course makes the music. Who made the music that starts this show and ends this show. Near the. Near the Fonz Hill foothills. And let's see. So It's a minute 54. We can't play the whole thing, but I think you'll get the picture.
01:11:05.525 - 01:11:26.033, Speaker A: So you see the animation. Pretty wild. Kind of crunchy music. Pretty cool. So that is. You can hear the whole thing on Tradscape's account. That's in the fake whale art market.
01:11:26.033 - 01:11:55.267, Speaker A: And that is 15 Tezos edition of 15 and 1 left. So great to see Tradscape back on the scene. A few more from Spiegels and the PFP project here. Kind of a Halloween theme perhaps with the skull and see if that loads up. We have a couple of more here too, so we might not be able to load full screen for each one. As we wait for this to come in. We may have to just leave it at this.
01:11:55.267 - 01:12:09.647, Speaker A: Could be, you know, the real size anyway for all we know. Or pretty close to it. It's only 320 by 240. So this is probably pretty close to accurate. Here's another one. Kind of looks like a clown. Interestingly great color here.
01:12:09.647 - 01:12:29.705, Speaker A: And another head with a big happy face. And these are all selling like 0.03 ETH on this one. So just a rad, a different kind of computer really. Well, great production from Spiegelsmeskinen here. Here's Popple. This is probably not new, but I just don't remember seeing it.
01:12:29.705 - 01:12:58.977, Speaker A: And of course Popple, you know, has been posting way back in hen and has a very cool distinct kind of pixel art style. So just very cool sci fi kind of pixel art. Sci fi horror, pixel art, you might say. A little bit of generative art is included oftentimes within it. There it almost looks like runes. Pretty interesting. Kind of again there it is.
01:12:58.977 - 01:13:30.967, Speaker A: So demake yourself. Pretty cool. Here's Austin mono str XTDS011 bit distracted entities. So again, just playing with some different representations of a figure or a head in pixel art. Or different heads in pixel art. Again that looseness here is another nice contrast with pixel art being kind of again very, you know, geometric. Then all of a sudden you add the looseness.
01:13:30.967 - 01:13:52.145, Speaker A: You know, I use this myself in pixel Art Sketchbook that that contrast. You see how well it works, right? So very cool. They're almost a signature down there. Hilariously. Addition of 10 for 10 tazos each one gone here is stip and pixel. Let's take a peek at what's in the bag. So I think yeah, this does move.
01:13:52.145 - 01:14:20.823, Speaker A: Kind of a wild work here. So not almost like a video game edition of one and not listed yet. So again, kind of a retro looking video game. Kind of wild. Hey, so you can probably get more information. Kind of looks like created by Stypnpixel if I had to venture a guess here. Here's Rural Idol.
01:14:20.823 - 01:15:02.231, Speaker A: Evil enters from stage left. And here kind of combining texture and what looked like perhaps beginning with physical texture and then getting almost this interesting Kind of kind of cycling pixelation like you might even find in Nicholas Sassoon here. Very crisp, isn't it? So nice animation here. Very crisp kind of large scale GIF animation. That's an addition of five and that is selling for only three tezos. Here's Blotter nft, another kind of wild work here and kind of almost looks like sci fi. Maybe could hang in a similar show to Popple.
01:15:02.231 - 01:15:32.033, Speaker A: Kind of has a sci fi edgy kind of, you know, here's some pixelation and everything and just interesting shapes and everything. Minimal color and giving it kind of a futuristic feel. Overflow edition of 10 for 5 tazos. And how are we doing here? Sold out. And Psycho futurist edition of 15. Another kind of wild contrast here. Show of wild contrast.
01:15:32.033 - 01:16:01.820, Speaker A: And here you see these huge eyes looking on this kind of digital collage. Glb almost collage of sorts. But this is just a gif. So all submissions with artificial intelligence generations will be automatically disqualified. Real artists that actually draw. So a bit of a statement there. Political or a bit of a artistic statement, shall we say? So that is 17 Tezos edition of 15 and selling out.
01:16:01.820 - 01:16:29.599, Speaker A: So 17 on secondary here is don't buy. And we see here a pretty interesting kind of combination of what looks like maybe a 17th century painting or maybe AI mixed with operating system elements like the cursor, kind of a feedback loop on it or seeming to have some feedback on it. Blue screen of death vibes. BSOD in the blue code in the background. Pretty cool. That was on Instagram. Here's perfect loop.
01:16:29.599 - 01:16:50.447, Speaker A: Spidermose. Kind of a fun piece here. Again using operating system elements to create an art piece. And here the mouse is. It is a mouse but with cursors crawling across the icons. Pretty cool piece. Sold out at 20 tazos and now listed on secondary for 61.
01:16:50.447 - 01:17:11.371, Speaker A: Nice work. Here is Glitch Town Arcade Mushroom Mubi. As you see here, kind of Super Mario glitched out different colors. Almost having a bit of a Halloween vibe perhaps, but so mushroom move. So playing with Super Mario. This is an edition of one at 25 Tazos. Here's another one by Glitchtown Arcade 58.
01:17:11.371 - 01:17:32.259, Speaker A: Kind of almost more abstract. Glitch Rom. Nintendo Glitch Rom. Very nice piece. Cool frame there too. Here's Acid Boy with pretty rad, you know, animated abstract and I think works with code on these. On this piece.
01:17:32.259 - 01:18:00.295, Speaker A: Kind of almost Halloween vibes in the orange there. Great to see Acid Boy Gino. Here's a work called Storm, kind of an abstract Analog video glitch, shall we call it? Some really nice textures in here. I believe this is a GIF. It is a looping GIF edition of 10 for 20 tezos and sold out at 5. Now on secondary for 20, here's ex mortal. We thought it would be different this time.
01:18:00.295 - 01:18:20.345, Speaker A: And look at this. Love it. Love the pixelation. So keeping things edgy and new here. What a contrast. Another wild contrast here from Ex Mortal and kind of a desert scene, seemingly with. Or at least some sort of scene in the wilderness.
01:18:20.345 - 01:19:01.315, Speaker A: Here's another one, broken scene from a forgotten Dream. A nice kind of almost grid across this landscape here. And look at how rich the water is there. So you're seeing here, and you see it in my own work as well. This kind of push towards not worrying and about JPEG artifacts, kind of playing with these kind of, you know, and I wouldn't call this JPEG artifacts, but playing with distortions and not, you know, being, you know, embracing those as textures, so to speak. You know, digital distortions as textures, so to speak. So that is Ex Mortal.
01:19:01.315 - 01:19:18.201, Speaker A: And that is this sold out. It is so Ex Mortal doing amazing. Here's Sabato and Lidice. Silvera. Absolution. Chimera in the Cathedral. So kind of a wild look at this wild work here.
01:19:18.201 - 01:19:37.019, Speaker A: I don't think we looked at this one. It's all blending in together here. And so cool. GLB. This came out November 18, 2023. Well, maybe we looked at that like a year ago, so I guess it was just reposted. And this is edition of 18 for 16 tazos.
01:19:37.019 - 01:19:58.413, Speaker A: And here's another GLB. This one is new. La Pesca. Did we look at this? I feel like I'm getting all confused here, guys. Thank you for your patience. I think maybe we did after Michelangelo. So interesting and a little bit of humor here and great color as ever from Salawaki.
01:19:58.413 - 01:20:19.625, Speaker A: It's possible we haven't, of course, if you don't. And I just. These kind of GLB scenarios again. And even just the. This is brilliant. If I can zoom in on this glb, the plug in here with the phone plugged into the wall, like, witty. And there we see quite beautiful.
01:20:19.625 - 01:20:34.949, Speaker A: So cool work there. And I think it's new. It's October 28th. I'm not sure if we showed it before. Bosque Grazia Celebration. So cool work here. Kind of a German scene, maybe from the recent vacation.
01:20:34.949 - 01:20:51.185, Speaker A: Not sure. And here kind of looks like the Bavarian Alps, if I had to guess. Analog slide collage with negatives. Found in Maurer Park, Berlin. So just awesome. Finding more negatives. This is called Celebration Edition of three for seven tazos.
01:20:51.185 - 01:21:12.565, Speaker A: And here is no Hygiene and Forest Wish Taker. So someone I haven't heard of. And here, kind of cool graffiti meets no hygiene. Wild work here. Edition of 10 for 10 tezos each and just listed. And here's another work, Neural Divine. I think this is AI.
01:21:12.565 - 01:21:38.465, Speaker A: This is on Surreal app. And so just interesting textures here. Kind of looks like a butterfly with a kind of 1980s background. Okote connected. So Oakote has been doing fabulously on Instagram. If you've been noticing and you can see why, look at how well like this is almost convincing if it wasn't modern iconography. Like, look at how great the textures are in the background.
01:21:38.465 - 01:21:56.871, Speaker A: Right. Again, I mean, you got a bit of randomness here. It's controlled because the background is basically a yellow wall. But on that yellow wall you have some chaos. So adding interest, if it was pure yellow, it wouldn't be very interesting. Right. There would be no contrast, at least within the wall.
01:21:56.871 - 01:22:23.575, Speaker A: Now, of course, taking our contrast discussion further, the flatness of the wall and the simplicity of the wall, despite the kind of textures here is contrasting with the very busyness of the figures here. Right. So there is a contrast here. It's a matter of degree. In a sense. This is more complex over here than the wall, despite the complexity in the texture. Cool subject matter.
01:22:23.575 - 01:22:42.805, Speaker A: Laptop kind of. And cool. Just kind of like an Aztec or Inca kind of figures here with some computers and laptops. So cool. Juxtaposition of old and new. Connected. Great title.
01:22:42.805 - 01:23:04.425, Speaker A: Two edition of 10 for 250. Here's Ken Xapita, AI Landscaping. So just a little bit more AI within the kind of work in progress here or just behind the scenes or perhaps a work AI landscaping, scaping. That is Kanek Zapata. Here's strange thing again. I thought this was great with all of the logos and everything. Nike.
01:23:04.425 - 01:23:17.599, Speaker A: Why Louis Vuitton. And look at that. And the. But totally rendered with what looks like kind of Renaissance painting style. Personal Shopper. Great title. Awesome.
01:23:17.599 - 01:23:39.583, Speaker A: And here's no Hygiene again with this huge happy face in the background. I think this is called 1997. Who of course I follow. So again, just really pushing the limits of expectations and everything which keeps no hygiene. Super duper interesting. A really wild artist. Jesse Makinson looking forward to showing.
01:23:39.583 - 01:24:01.215, Speaker A: So pretty. I think well known, I think, as you see here, doing fairly well on Instagram. So this is going to be at Spurs Gallery At a art fair, maybe in Shanghai, if I'm not mistaken. So pretty cool. Wish I could make this a little bit bigger. Here we go. So kind of a surreal, you know, painter here.
01:24:01.215 - 01:24:19.785, Speaker A: I think this is oil, if I'm not mistaken. Oil on canvas. A golden shrug. So pretty cool there. Kind of an edgier work. Jameson Pearl. And here you can see it's almost like the artifacts are being celebrated, you know, kind of a similar thing that we're seeing digitally.

01:24:38.235 - 01:24:50.151, Speaker A: Here's Machine. Not sure if we've seen this one before. I feel like we might have. And just cool. Skateboarders here. Airbrushed. Love what's being left out here.
01:24:50.151 - 01:25:08.565, Speaker A: Not too detailed, just kind of suggestive. Not sure if this is finished. I kind of hope it is, but I guess we'll find out. Very cool piece. Here's Tim Lahan. Kind of interesting take on waterworks here and water dripping through all of these different canvases. Love the bar of soap there.
01:25:08.565 - 01:25:50.415, Speaker A: Pretty kind of humorous work there. And that is your show. Thank you for joining me and I hope to see you at NUV1914 on the Spaces today. Tornado, Rodriguez and Runetoon will also be joining. Until next time, thanks for all the support and take care. J. SA.
