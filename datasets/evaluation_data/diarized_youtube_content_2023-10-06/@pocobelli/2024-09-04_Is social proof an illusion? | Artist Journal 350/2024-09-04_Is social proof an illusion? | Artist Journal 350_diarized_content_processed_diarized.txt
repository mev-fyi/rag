00:00:04.160 - 00:00:36.597, Speaker A: A new day as I rely on this music like you wouldn't believe. It is almost a mental crutch for the words to start flowing. Something to do with inspiration, I know not what. Welcome back, Artist Journal. September 4, 2024. Broadcasting from a beautiful, sunny, not quite fall day in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokabelli, Dreaming of the beach, dreaming of Greece, where I'll be on Friday.
00:00:36.597 - 00:01:05.289, Speaker A: Friday morning, when I regularly would record this show, I'll be on a plane lifting off into the sky. Is it Scoop Airlines? I'm terrified. But all worth it. All worth it. So, okay, so no show on Friday, but my goal and plan very quickly is to record while I'm out there. And I'm hoping it will stimulate experimentation and everything. So, just so you know.
00:01:05.289 - 00:01:31.745, Speaker A: So the goal is to keep the schedule apart from Friday, but let's see. But I am going to. Again, it may be different. It's going to be a couple of weeks over a week in Anafi, which is beside Santorini. As my friend out of Athens was telling me, it's like the coolest. It's put it this way, Santorini is very trendy. You've probably seen it on Instagram with all the white and the blue.
00:01:31.745 - 00:01:56.069, Speaker A: So that's kind of like the obvious place to go. And my friend is more of a local, so to speak, and she's like, let's go to an AFI with a couple other friends and. Which is right beside it. And then a week in Crete, taking the ferry down to meet another friend who's going. Who's vacationing. Vacationing with his family over near Heracleon. So it should be interesting.
00:01:56.069 - 00:02:21.509, Speaker A: The first week might be trickier because I'm staying with three other people in this Airbnb, so it's always tricky when you don't have kind of sovereignty over the space. Of course, I live by myself. Had I if I didn't live by myself, this show would be a lot trickier. However, the second week I'm on my own in an Airbnb, so that should be easier. So enough with the preliminaries here. Let's look at Ex Mortal. I was joking with myself.
00:02:21.509 - 00:02:47.721, Speaker A: It's Ex Mortal day, because of course we have Ex Mortal on the spaces today. Really looking forward to that. And it's nice to have kind of, you know, video glitch, you know, I guess another glitch artist, but someone who's kind of more video centric, perhaps. I'm a little centric to, you know, I guess more like jpegs. And GIFs. So it's nice to have a little bit more video. Of course, this looks like perhaps it's a gif.
00:02:47.721 - 00:03:21.385, Speaker A: The mediums do start to blend at a certain point. So here it is, a recent work by Exmortal here now at 79 tezos on a roll, I would say in the last six weeks, if I had to venture a guess, pretty good. You know, already at 79 Tezos, I mean Tezos is getting killed. It's almost at like 60 cents there and it looks like things could fall more. Should bitcoin go down? Of course. All other cryptos following bitcoin for the most part. Golden Hour Under a Broken Sky.
00:03:21.385 - 00:03:47.793, Speaker A: Fantastic title. And the underscores, of course, Ex Mortal, as you'll see here, putting the underscore even after mortal. Enjoying the underscores here. I kind of love it. I only really noticed it when I was writing the name for the space that's going to take place today. So beautiful color here. And it's kind of like, you know, I've long discussed how pixel art and nature go well together.
00:03:47.793 - 00:04:35.933, Speaker A: It seems also that video glitch, glitchery also seems to go well with nature. I think especially these works here. These kind of landscape works, for lack of better term, often beach related. And this kind of, you know, rolling waves coming into this shore here as well as the sky. There's something, you know, to state the super obvious and the impressionists would probably laugh at me for saying this, but there's something about nature, right? And I. But put it this way, where I'm going with, where I'm going with this is there's something about nature and the contrast of nature with technology. And here you see it, I'd argue in its most extreme form, you could argue with pixel art.
00:04:35.933 - 00:05:18.985, Speaker A: It's almost nature abstracted. And you get the hard contrast of what I always call the curvilinear forms of nature biomorphic, you know, edges with the curved edges with the hard squares of pixelated digital technology. A huge contrast. You see a similar contrast here. I'd argue it's not as hard, but maybe it's as beautiful. And here though, it's of a different nature, is of a different kind. And of course nature, just so you know, comes from phusis, the Greek word, you know, of course, Aristotle's book on the phusis.
00:05:18.985 - 00:05:40.607, Speaker A: It's about change physics, right? So when we're talking about nature that came, and I think the Latin is I. But I'm now I'm starting to Go out of my depth. I think the Latin is natura or something like this. Naturalis. And I think the Greek is phusis. P H Y S I S. And it's about change.
00:05:40.607 - 00:06:18.175, Speaker A: The nature of nature kind of means change, right? And so interestingly, here we see technology and nature. It's kind of beautiful, isn't it? And these wonderful colors. This very modern artwork. Again, this is only possible through. And here it is glitched, colorized with analog glitch gear. Digital video playback. Glitched colorized with analog glitch gear and Eurorack modular video hardware.
00:06:18.175 - 00:06:54.823, Speaker A: Analog glitching performed with a Fermata Hither dither focus enhancements. MX4 video mixer used at n of chain, end of chain for stabilization. Captured with a Roland VR3 capture device. Post processing performed in After Effects. I mean, it's a paragraph of all the equipment that is being used here. And it's kind of interesting, isn't it? It's a paragraph of all the information that's used of all the equipment that's used here. And it just goes to show how much work gets put into this.
00:06:54.823 - 00:07:34.027, Speaker A: Some people might think, again, this is pressing a button. Okay, I'll take a video of the sea and then I just press a button in After Effects and I'll get this gorgeous work of art. And part of my favorite part right here is maybe on the side here. I'm kind of big on these superficialities as well as here. I mean, it's beautiful throughout and the color, it's kind of like a amped up sunset. But you know, it goes to show just how much expertise, frankly, how much techne. How much craft is required here.
00:07:34.027 - 00:08:08.745, Speaker A: How much art is required here. So ex mortal already at 79 Tez and let's just see how much longer to go in this English auction, as they call it here. Eight hours to go. So we'll see what it goes for. Again, it's kind of exciting. I feel like we've seen in the last three or four months a bit of a, you know, a real. A bit of a collectibility, shall we say, an increased collectibility in video glitch art, which I think is super interesting.
00:08:08.745 - 00:08:35.015, Speaker A: Here is another one by Xmortal. It's called Reflect or Underscore. Reflect beautifully. You know, even with the spacing, all these little details go to create the impression of the artwork. R space, E space, F. And again you see what looks like the same process here, right? The same art, right. The same technical process.
00:08:35.015 - 00:08:59.285, Speaker A: So here is another one. And again, kind of similar to our last one here, kind of not so much. I guess you could call it a beach of sorts. Not necessarily the beaches of Greece. This is more like the beaches of Ostsee or somewhere in Germany or in Canada. More of a lake beach, shall we say. Similarly beautiful colors though.
00:08:59.285 - 00:09:39.357, Speaker A: And again you see a kind of gorgeous moving artistry here. And although I call this video because it is so based in video, it is a gif as far as I can tell here. This I didn't need to press play here, right. So which is also interesting in and of itself. So this is an addition of 13 and it is 12 tezos 22 cents on secondary. Let's just see what it sold for on primary, a mere $4.14. So it's a wonderful time, as we were mentioning earlier, to be a collector and an artist on this blockchain.
00:09:39.357 - 00:10:32.885, Speaker A: A kind of golden age. It's tempting to say again, where someone can make a beautiful art piece, upload it, someone can collect it for $4 on primary and the artist can collect, let's say four times 13, you know, a cool 60 bucks U.S. i'm Canadian, so you know, that's even $90 Canadian or something to that effect, maybe 80. So interesting and interesting also the hardware changes here we see the BPMC Fluxus duo. So all to say, gorgeous works to get us started and inspired for those that are trying to pursue the beach here into September. So here we go, Ex mortal. Also while we're on, it is X mortal day here today.
00:10:32.885 - 00:11:32.773, Speaker A: And also at RGB Mtl. I don't think we saw this one again. Playing with nature. There's something about it, isn't there? So very interesting here. And I believe Strano. Actually, I'm not sure Atso Labs curated Strano. And of course Nicholas Sassoon was also involved in what's, you know, I keep, you know, it's wearing well this show like I keep looking at and being impressed and you know what I think it is, which probably you already thought of it really is this display of like, you can tell video glitch or glitch artists, but people who are like, who already are incorporated and dealing with video all the time, who have this, this is probably from their studios, these CRTs, these televisions, right? So for them to move this into exhibition space, kind of not a big deal.
00:11:32.773 - 00:12:08.821, Speaker A: This is how they work, so to speak. This is probably them taking part of their studio and moving it or taking ideas from, you know, working in the studio and going, hey, what if we had five of These on top of each other. And so. And again, there's something very Warholian about this display. Of course, Eightso, you know, working deeply in video, you know, what I'd call video glitch. You know, with these kind of TVs, we remember the modern furniture series. And so there's something very Warholian about it because each of these TVs will present the art slightly differently and in a slightly different way.
00:12:08.821 - 00:13:07.259, Speaker A: And sometimes I'm not sure if it's the way it was recorded or not, but even the backlighting, the blue backlighting here, this is. To me, this is like if I went to moma, you know, and I started seeing this kind of display, I'd go, yeah, that's pretty cool, right? That. That doesn't look out of place here. You could argue this has done better than we're seeing in some museums. Which kind of, you know, opens a deeper question for me because, you know, as we saw with Art News the other day two shows ago, we were looking at the Art News article that was quoting NFT Evening, which actually. And, you know, and trying to analyze the digital art market, you know, based on the blockchain NFTs, and read into all this thing when confusing all the PFP and the art. No subtleties.
00:13:07.259 - 00:13:55.265, Speaker A: And then we go to the source website that Ark News was quoting. And then there's. It's just completely anonymous, right? It could have been you or me who sent this up and then put out a press release. And then Ark News picks it up and it could be all fabricated for all we know. I mean, it's probably real data, but who knows? So to me, the reason I bring that up is because I think it's important to, you know, it's like that Dali painting to lift the veil, or like that medieval kind of wood, that very famous medieval woodcut of the guy peeking behind the veil. Because we live in this world of perception, I would argue, and that, you know, of authorities and that we give. You know, it's exactly like Santiago was saying about art.
00:13:55.265 - 00:14:33.471, Speaker A: And how strange is it Santiago was saying in that tweet, how strange is it that we have an art piece and then it's put into a museum, and then all of a sudden we look at that art piece different. It's ridiculous, but it's true, as I think he put it. And it's kind of like the power of social proof. And we're kind of back to social proof with Art News. All of a sudden it's like, oh, here's Social proof. Oh, it's moma. But I think it, it's worth our while, you know, from a critical thinking point of view to think freely and to actually just take everything for what it is and try not to assume too much.
00:14:33.471 - 00:15:45.029, Speaker A: And perhaps, perhaps resist social proof is where I'm going with this. Perhaps we need to be consciously actually trying to resist this most powerful of marketing tools, social proof, and of coloring perception, as Santiago so, you know, accurately put it in that tweet, talking about how art changes when we put it into a museum. Even though it's the same work, it's ridiculous. And so is it better? Right? So what is the reality? You know, is social proof an illusion? So, and the reason I bring all this up is because, you know what, if you told me this was moma, I would go, yeah, okay, I wouldn't have any reason to not think so. I wouldn't be like, oh, look at the amateur work that MoMA did. I would go, yeah, that looks like it came out of MoMA. So especially in this Internet age where I think, you know, it's like the fourth turning, as all the financial people like to say, which is more of a sociological thing, you know, all these institutions are, you know, I suspect, going to start to break down over time.
00:15:45.029 - 00:16:09.843, Speaker A: It's inevitable. It's a matter of time, it's just how long. So when I see this, I just go, you know, what does it mean? And if that was in MoMA, what does that mean? So anyways, big space today with Ex Mortal. I'm really thrilled. Ex Mortal was excited about it too, online, which made me even more excited. Runetoon's gonna be there too. Should be a great time.
00:16:09.843 - 00:16:30.875, Speaker A: There's a lot of people going to it too, which is also exciting. So that is today at 3:30. I'm getting this video out a little earlier. So you may watch this before possibly before we start. So do check it out. It's at 3:30 European time, 9:30am New York Eastern Standard Time. And also actually let's look at YouTube.
00:16:30.875 - 00:17:05.725, Speaker A: I like to go to YouTube first. Let's look at the comments here. And this was a breakthrough for me and I think it was triggered this idea of a painting as a system. I think it was triggered by RJ's, as we were noting at the end of the show when we were looking at rj, kind of like the artwork, the system is a painting or the art is the system or something. And I think it triggered something. Because what's interesting about this is if you've watched, you know, lectures on the history of science, it seems. Or if you are more.
00:17:05.725 - 00:18:07.009, Speaker A: I never took too many science classes, but I watched a lot of lectures on the history of science in just from the great courses, which I highly recommend. I should actually put like a affiliate link here since I talk about them a lot. But this idea of treating reality as a system of relationships is kind of, as far as I understand, kind of current thinking. And so what if we apply this idea of how we're dealing with the universe kind of from a cutting edge science point of view? What if we start applying that to artworks, treating an artwork as a system as we're. As I was pointing out yesterday, it's not about Hasdrubal waffle necessarily making a Mona Lisa like rendering of a pogo or a dinosaur or whatever that was. It was about the system of relationships between elements in. It's a system of relationships between elements in a kind of vacuum of sorts.
00:18:07.009 - 00:18:29.393, Speaker A: A universe of sorts as I like to call it, within, you know, four walls or whatever your framing devices. Let's go to the comments here. Just making sure I'm recording here. Okay. Hypermorano, let's go into the comments here. I really like the point you make about using digital brushes imitating traditional ones. Yeah, it's.
00:18:29.393 - 00:19:12.015, Speaker A: Yeah. Let's continue. I always feel weird about it when I look into some digital paintings made with them. Not sure how else it seats conceptually on a pure digital piece. And I had the same reservation, but I think it was probably waffles that kind of brought me over to going, this is all just digital brushery and maybe we shouldn't care at all in a sense, even though conceptually, you know, I've always kind of gravitated, shall we say, towards the purely digital brush. Big fan of the magic wand in Photoshop. These kind of natively digital tools, you know, the pencil tool for that crisp edge, you know, speaking in Photoshop terms.
00:19:12.015 - 00:19:35.297, Speaker A: Let's continue. I really appreciate when artists own their own mark making and errors that make the piece very human and unique. So much to explore into the native digital mark making. Thanks for all the work you put into this channel. Cheers. Awesome comment. And I share your fascination with this whole topic because conceptually it is something to get your head around.
00:19:35.297 - 00:20:04.273, Speaker A: And again, when I look at, you know, curio French, when I look at waffles and I see this kind of not caring and you know, even. And I think it's by virtue of using the kids tools and just going, you know what, this is good enough don't overthink. It is kind of like the moral of the story as far as these digital tools. And also, you know, don't. Don't put up barriers unnecessarily. Although, I mean, it depends what you're trying to do in the context and everything. PP Universal.
00:20:04.273 - 00:20:28.739, Speaker A: Thanks, Adrian, for the feature. Was great to meet you in person. Wish you the best in Greece. And it was awesome to meet PP Universal at a cafe there with Marietta in a beautiful part of Buenos Aires. It is such a nice part of Buenos Aires. Trying to remember, is it Rancora, the neighborhood Bancora something R. Wish you the best in Greece.
00:20:28.739 - 00:20:38.251, Speaker A: Thank you. It was just an absolute pleasure to meet Pippi in person. Very friendly individual. Rada. Thanks for doing this, sir. Enjoy Greece. Thank you, Rada.
00:20:38.251 - 00:20:50.891, Speaker A: And just a thrill as ever to hear from you. I believe we have a work actually by Rada this episode, Lord Misfit. Awesome to hear from you. It is a pleasure to hear from you. Sin Pablo. Great, Nice. Thank you.
00:20:50.891 - 00:21:13.751, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you. And finally, Runetoon, who will be co hosting with me this afternoon. You've been talking a lot about your invigorated interest in physicals or making physicals of digital work as a means of preservation. Yes, indeed. A very counterintuitive thought. We'll continue. Hasdrubal makes very texturally rich digital work, and you can imagine it working well physically.
00:21:13.751 - 00:21:45.137, Speaker A: There's another artist, Morgan Blair, who makes physical work that looks exceptional as digital. I even thought her work was digital the first time I saw it. It got me thinking about personal artistic missions, principally a goal of making work that is versatile both physically and digitally. There are plenty of artists whose work we can imagine working really well as physical artworks. And then there are some artworks which wouldn't operate well as physical and vice versa. Well, yeah, exactly. Like, how would you do the Ex Mortal, for example? Right.
00:21:45.137 - 00:22:28.137, Speaker A: In a physical, you could. You could take a screen or, you know, if it's a gif, there's going to be 30 frames or whatever the case is. And remember, we saw an example of that where there's the big one on top and then each little frame underneath, you could do 30 different prints. In the case of the Ex Mortal, this is an opportunity. I suspect this going like. Again, my thought has evolved over the course of this show as to what it all means, and I've made this point repeatedly, so I won't dwell on it, but it is a new artwork. If you make a digital file and then you start making a Physical version of that digital work.
00:22:28.137 - 00:23:03.575, Speaker A: To me, it's a separate artwork. It is a completely separate artwork. And that makes it a much cleaner situation conceptually, because otherwise it's like, oh, is the physical. Is the photo of the physical the artwork? You remember with Damien Hirst, as we were just discussing last episode, is it the. You know, and that was the nature of Hearst's whole experiment, right? Is what do you want the physical or the nft? The photo, I would call it, of the artwork. And of course you want the physical, in my opinion, because otherwise it's just a photo of the artwork. That is the artwork.
00:23:03.575 - 00:23:40.675, Speaker A: It is not like that is the artwork. It's a photo of an artwork. And so the artwork is kind of related to the photo, but it's not the original quote, unquote. So that is where I am. Otherwise, if you start saying, oh, well, this is the same and everything, it's a conceptual message, I would argue it starts to break down and it's like saying, oh, this is all one thing. The only kind of weird exception I'd put, small kind of caveat I'd put to this is there's something to be said for. Let's say you're selling a physical and then you want to kind of put it on the blockchain for.
00:23:40.675 - 00:24:06.715, Speaker A: Just for the record, for history and everything. And then saying, okay, I'm going to take a picture of this. And then if you own the physical, here's basically your digital receipt on the blockchain. Here's an nft, a photo of the work. But to prove, you know, you own this, and I'll put on my, you know, details that whoever owns this should have the NFT, etc. It's a certificate of authenticity of sorts. That would be the only exception I'd put into identifying the two.
00:24:06.715 - 00:24:21.589, Speaker A: So let's continue. Also some comments on Twitter. Thank you again for the support. Great to just humbling here, Skull. I need to catch your vids more often. Love your insights. Thank you, Skull.
00:24:21.589 - 00:24:37.053, Speaker A: I totally appreciate it. Zoni Jagar. Amazing Pokebelly. Thank you, you guys. You know, it really is the fuel in a lot of ways that keeps this show going as the enthusiasm here. Jan Lucas Magone. New cool piece today.
00:24:37.053 - 00:25:03.517, Speaker A: Yeah, awesome. And yeah, actually we actually have a Yan piece in this episode. Rorich, awesome to hear from you. I am trying to get Rorich on the spaces who has been following this Tezos object scene for a long time, you know, longer than me for sure. Oyani Coyote. I'm all caught up Wonderful video sir. Awesome to hear from you and I appreciate the continued positivity.
00:25:03.517 - 00:25:40.455, Speaker A: K works Little Cakes Glad you liked the Yuriko Sassoko work installation I posted the other day. The video on the screens I believe were of her face and flower petals. She's the coolest video installation artist I've come across recently and posting this super interesting piece here. I think I actually brought this up in another tab. I didn't realize it was a comment. Look at how cool that is. I don't know if you can see it but it's basically kind of almost rectangular square screens that are made these look like squares here and then a TV making a bigger work.
00:25:40.455 - 00:25:59.235, Speaker A: So pretty interesting link there from Cakes Made in Shiga and Yuriko Sasaoka is the artist. Very cool. Tornado Rodriguez. Woohoo Knew I knew knew. I know what I will watch today. Thank you Tornado. Awesome to hear from you.
00:25:59.235 - 00:26:11.399, Speaker A: Keep up the great beautiful art there. Brain Dead. Hey there Adrian. I just finished the episode. Great selections as always. Also thank you for the shout out. And we have another work by Braindead on super rare really cool work with a keyboard.
00:26:11.399 - 00:26:40.159, Speaker A: We're going to see that in a few tabs here. Thank you for the comment. Retro Manny. Happy New Year. Exactly. As to you Manny, awesome to hear from you because now 8 so wrote a comment here as to how to pronounce is a lousy, is a lousy is a lossy. You don't pronounce the k is what 8 so was saying isolowski is a lossy.
00:26:40.159 - 00:27:00.065, Speaker A: So thank you for the comment here. Thanks for the mention especially the RGB MTL show which was special to many of us. Indeed. Yeah, next year I'll have to put it on the calendar. Skull takes wonderful show to start this month. Poca Belly also had to run to Rodeo to pick up those amazing Hble waffles. The power of the art compelled me and I felt the same way.
00:27:00.065 - 00:27:15.545, Speaker A: Yeah, just rad artwork from Waffles as ever. Can you believe it? Ah heck indeed. I refuse to believe it. Joshua awesome to hear from you. Olivera Durdevich this worked by his dribble waffle. Just started watching already. Love it.
00:27:15.545 - 00:27:26.685, Speaker A: I think we have a work by Olivera here too. So it all continues. And the great great waffles here. Mr. Adrian Pokebelly. Wow. Thank you so much for the incredible insights and for picking up on the nuances.
00:27:26.685 - 00:27:45.273, Speaker A: Yes, back to browsers and revisiting some old ideas from an external drive. Super stoked about the CRTs too. Such a fun way to present GIFs, in my opinion. All love to you, so thank you. Waffles. Just rad to hear from you. And it's always rad to hear from the artists in the show.
00:27:45.273 - 00:27:54.793, Speaker A: So that is rad too. You know, it's a small world after all, as they say. Sahar Nft. Great to hear from you. Ilya Barberin. Thank you. Lepro Chant.
00:27:54.793 - 00:28:26.781, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you. And finally, real. I was raised on YouTube 1986 and so welcome to the show and a quick look at the community here. Very cool. This was just posted by Luke sharing the story. Among the pieces person offered the lawsuit said were a rendition that Andy Warhol did of his famous John Wayne for $150,000 and quote one of the original Warhol canvases of Royal Queen Elizabeth for $82,500. So Florida family spent $6 million on fake Warhols.
00:28:26.781 - 00:28:40.905, Speaker A: You know, it looks fake. That looks totally fake if you look at it. I mean that doesn't look like a Warhol at all. Kind of like. I don't want to say they deserved it. I mean, $6 million. Nobody deserves to be scammed.
00:28:40.905 - 00:28:54.151, Speaker A: But you should really know what you're doing if like, because just from here, that is not a screen print. Right? Yeah. Wow. Amazing. Thank you for posting that. Luke. Luke.
00:28:54.151 - 00:29:10.115, Speaker A: Always on top of the scene there. Luke500 Chrome Void 3 Wojax this is awesome. I brought it up later in the show in the glitch section. Really kind of cool, moody piece there. Ernesto Ash. Awesome to hear from you. And here we see.
00:29:10.115 - 00:29:33.145, Speaker A: This is for Tazos Tuesday de Openares. So I can't speak Spanish, but just a cool gif here, as we can see here. So cool to see Ernesto Ash's animated abstracts. Zizo. Thank you for posting cool pieces here. Kind of a sci fi AI feel to it. And here.
00:29:33.145 - 00:29:43.517, Speaker A: And here. Very cool. That looks like the British Museum. That is the British Museum, isn't it? Okay. Happy Tuesday. And here, Macro Metry. Thank you for posting.
00:29:43.517 - 00:29:57.715, Speaker A: More experimental wizardry here from Macro Metry. Interesting negative space here too. Very cool. Interesting colors. First syndrome, Oddfellows 1 and 2. Interesting work here. Kind of collage.
00:29:57.715 - 00:30:17.549, Speaker A: Thank you for posting. And kind of a combination with painting Neho. Neho out. Who actually made this beautiful. If you remember last show, if you remember this, this is Neho. You'll see there. Adrian and Neho.
00:30:17.549 - 00:30:26.829, Speaker A: Just awesome. And there's Neho. So here is Neho. Awesome to hear from you. Neho. And I'm sure I follow you. That is a glitch on X.
00:30:26.829 - 00:30:51.487, Speaker A: This is my piece for the On Chain Summer collection exhibited this weekend at the Neutral Arts Celebration, available on Zora. So go and look at this. There's the mate. So go to Zora. Look at how beautifully this is done. A very talented artist as you could see from that portrait just done while we were recording a video, you know, a live video there in Buenos Aires. And look at this.
00:30:51.487 - 00:31:08.785, Speaker A: This is quite beautiful. Neho. Look at this background here, this painterly background. So this is on Zora. And even just this overlapping. This is beautiful, beautiful work here and quite original. And again, the mate, which I tried only for the first time.
00:31:08.785 - 00:31:24.457, Speaker A: I had barely heard of mate before Neho was there hilariously. So anyways, big shout out to Neho. That is awesome. Beautiful work. Sony Jagger. That's on Zora if you want to collect it. Sony Jagger GM New drop on Tezos, fully hand drawn 2D animation.
00:31:24.457 - 00:31:40.835, Speaker A: Two Tezos. Cool work actually. Never seen this artist before. Zani Yagar. So the community is doing its thing and there is Zizo who I believe we saw post earlier and this we saw last episode. So very cool. Thank you everybody for posting in the community.
00:31:40.835 - 00:32:09.829, Speaker A: It's pretty rad. I think we're at 509, 510 community members. So pretty, pretty cool into interesting story here. The art newspaper global turmoil is raising taxes tilt art trade towards new era. So increasingly unsettled elites are making a struggle Struggling market even less predictable. Now I'm kind of back to this comment I've been making. I think part of what's going on here and it's an uneven market.
00:32:09.829 - 00:32:36.233, Speaker A: Again, it's a liquidity market as I've been describing. Warhols are basically keeping their value. I'm sure a Basquiat is basically keeping its value. Maybe not at records, but it's basically keeping its value. But it's all the kind of extraneous, more obscure, harder to get, more art consultancy type works abstract. Right. That are suffering is my impression.
00:32:36.233 - 00:33:09.117, Speaker A: And I wonder to myself as the market starts to slump. Yeah, okay, there's a liquidity issue. Is that the surface explanation though? But is there something deeper going on? Is the question I ask myself when I start seeing these articles. So here the most. So I'm going to read just a couple of paragraphs here pretty well everyone in the international art market agrees the trade is slumping. It's interesting they just call it a trade. The most pressing question this autumn is whether the slump is a mere cyclical downturn or something more seismic.
00:33:09.117 - 00:33:47.509, Speaker A: Because it is Continuing aggregate global auction sales at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips declined 27% in the first half of 2024. And that's based on 2023, which was a huge decline from 2022, with auction sales of post war and Contemporary art down 25.8% by value, according to Contemporary Art Market Confidence Report published in July by the London based analyst Art Tactic. The study's confidence indicator, based on responses from 128 art world insiders, stood at 22 on a scale of 100, a four year low. So confidence is low, 22 out of 100. And here is a quote from the report. Quote.
00:33:47.509 - 00:34:25.599, Speaker A: Negative market sentiment continues to outweigh positive voices in the market. And it is the fifth consecutive reading where pessimists outweigh optimists. And remember the Katya Kazakhina article where we saw the supply is too, too large, the prices are too expensive. Right. And I also think there's an aesthetic issue. I think it's been kind of bubbling and in a liquid market there's all the speculation and when the times are good, more things will just survive. But as the liquidity gets pulled out of the market, then you kind of see what is kind of standing the test of time to a certain degree.
00:34:25.599 - 00:34:51.394, Speaker A: This is where the market does start to show a kind of indication of what will stand the test of time, I would argue. So here's just another quote and then we will move on. Things are quieter. This is. Who is this? This is someone called Worth. Worth says, let's just. I don't see.
00:34:51.394 - 00:35:23.435, Speaker A: Do they not put this the name. How is that possible? Let's just do a quick thing because I'm just curious from a journalism point of view. Okay, it's here, it's here. Okay, let's look. Things are quieter. Everyone is feeling it, but I'm amazed more galleries haven't closed, says Candice Worth, a New York based art advisor specializing in the primary market for contemporary art. Wirth points out that high interest rates are just one of many factors inhibiting demand along with escalating costs of collecting.
00:35:23.435 - 00:35:57.049, Speaker A: Right. Because storage is getting more expensive and a general sense of exhaustion in the overheated market for works by the most sought after artists. She adds that those buying purely for investment have discovered how difficult it is to make money out of art. Right. It's almost like that's a whole other thing, like the art as an investment idea, you know, because I don't know about you, but I was seeing on my Instagram in the last Year, you know, make seven better than. Performs better than the stock market. You know, learn about our service here.
00:35:57.049 - 00:36:12.589, Speaker A: You know, more than 7% this side. You know, this idea that, oh, you should be buying art because it outperforms. Right. Worth continues. I really do believe things will settle out. I mean, inevitably, but it may take a year. Right.
00:36:12.589 - 00:36:35.879, Speaker A: So again, I was mentioning, I think, last episode, like, think how hard it would be to be an art consultant right now. Like, nobody's looking for something obscure right now. I would argue. Put it this way, though, you know what? Like, if I was an art consultant, of course, you know where I'd be? I'd be like, well, actually, I'll show you exactly where to go. It's called object.com. it's called, you know, whatever else. It's.
00:36:35.879 - 00:36:57.393, Speaker A: I'd say it's Tezos art. You want to get a bang for your buck? Do you want cheap art that's high quality, that nobody's really celebrating? That's maybe ahead of the curve? Let me help you. I mean, that's a business. You know, in theory. You know, in theory, like, if I was like, a ruthless pragmatist, I am just a pragmatist. But not always. I try not to be a ruthless pragmatist.
00:36:57.393 - 00:37:09.393, Speaker A: I would shut down this show and I would say, okay, here's what I've done in the past. You know, art. Art Market New York. Here's your consult. I can do the consultancy. I've shown. I can do it, let's say.
00:37:09.393 - 00:37:30.385, Speaker A: And then let's go. Pay me a bunch of money and I'll tell you where to go on the blockchain because, you know, it takes a while to figure it out. It is an expertise of sorts. Of course, that. Of course, that's no fun, though I would argue so that is why we continue here. But that's. If I was just, like, ruthless about it, I mean, other people could do it here too, frankly.
00:37:30.385 - 00:37:55.845, Speaker A: So anyways, just all kind of interesting. So, value. It's been a challenging macro environment. Finally, Guillaume Cerudi, the chief executive of Christie's, on a media call in July explaining why his company's Auction sales declined 22%. Value was down. Supply wasn't what it was last year. Alex Rotter, Christie's chairman of 20th and 20th century art, on the same call.
00:37:55.845 - 00:39:00.057, Speaker A: We are dependent on global events and emotion, neither of which has been cooperating. The geopolitical instability caused by the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East Chinese economy has spooked the wealthy, making them nervous about buying and selling high value art. So even impressionists, for the first time in decades, Christie did not hold the Christie's did not hold an auction of impressionist or modern art in London this June. That suggests that it is going to the larger mark, like into more liquid markets. Exemplifying the declining values of even supposed blue chip art investments was the auction's top lot, Jean Michel Basquiat's portrait of the artist as a young derelict. Although this mixed media triptych made 16 million pounds with fees at Sotheby's this June, it had been withdrawn in May 2022 from a Christie's auction in New York where it carried a significantly higher unpublished estimate of around 23 million pounds. So all pretty interesting as we continue here.
00:39:00.057 - 00:39:43.963, Speaker A: As Plexasaurus Rex says here, my art collection on Tezos is either going to be worth more than Fort Knox or zero. And either way I will still have one of the most culturally significant collections of digital art on the Internet and not care. Few, few understand this is exactly how I feel about my art collection as well. It's like either I'm gonna have a wonderful retirement there. I don't think I'll ever retire, honestly. But should I have to retire, either I'm going to be extremely comfortable or we'll just be, you know, getting along, you know, as it goes here. But I completely agree with this.
00:39:43.963 - 00:40:17.957, Speaker A: And you know what, you know, Flexasaurus, this is why I think it is going to be worth a lot of money. Because you see, we all kind of, I think a lot of us see this a culturally significant collection. What makes something valuable, right is it's kind of being culturally significant. So it may take 200 years, we may not enjoy the fruits, the benefits of it, but I think time will see us through. A really cool Interesting comment, Dr. Lee NFT, huge collector. I know why it's like this.
00:40:17.957 - 00:41:13.053, Speaker A: But in all honesty, all honesty, seeing this button next to an artwork, Digital or physical, 9 times out of 10 I'll just walk away inquire who can't relate to that. Another just insight of truth here from this time from Dr. Lee Nft, who wants to engage with that and all of the headache and all of the, you know, status games, frankly that's going to come from, oh, inquiring about a work of art and then all the, you feel like you're entering into a, you know, shark, shark infested waters. You know, if I saw that on like art Artsy and I had to hit inquire, it's like into the shark infested waters. This person on the other side of this inquiry simply wants to extract as much money out of me as they possibly can. I mean, who wants to walk into that environment? So totally agree with that unknown collector. Happy Tazos Tuesday, everyone at all.
00:41:13.053 - 00:41:33.561, Speaker A: The base stuff feels so forced. Discovering art on eth layer one at the moment is mostly as exciting. As exciting as cleaning the kitchen. Besides a few projects, of course. Art on Solana doesn't even appear in my bubble anymore. You know, it's pretty interesting. I mean, other than a little bit of action on Super Rare where we saw Santiago make a sale.
00:41:33.561 - 00:41:59.551, Speaker A: We've seen Myth putting some work. We've seen, you know, we're seeing brain dead. Like there is a little bit of kind of bubbling on Super Rare. Other than that though, yeah, thank God there is the Tezos art community. I mean, as we're seeing here, there's something to be said for not getting in the way, not screwing up. There's something like Tezos is really showing resilience here. They have a pretty good streak.
00:41:59.551 - 00:42:22.635, Speaker A: They've gone on since 2021 in different ways. And you could say hen was a screw up when it shut down. But ultimately, let's call it Object. They haven't really blown it in three, four years. I mean, how long has it been in 2021? We're in 2024, let's call it three, three years. I don't know exactly when they started. Let's call it, I imagine fall 2021, summer 2021.
00:42:22.635 - 00:42:51.905, Speaker A: So it's pretty impressive, you know, Object and the Tezos art community, it continues here. It seems stronger to a certain degree. I don't know if I'd say it's stronger than ever, but it's tempting to think that. Not sure if I would be very active at the moment without it. Yeah, and you see here, as I pointed out last time, like here are the works. I mean, It's I'd say 70 to 80% object, interestingly. And the others are like tweets that maybe are linking to an object at some point.
00:42:51.905 - 00:43:14.571, Speaker A: It keeps me excited. And there's still more great art release that I can collect, so. Exactly. And at a great price. And of course I follow UC as I like to call them. Just a glitch on X. Is it me or is everything 10 times more fragmented, siloed than two years ago? Art communities, blockchains, social apps.
00:43:14.571 - 00:43:43.021, Speaker A: Feels like everyone is in their own bubble. It's true. And it makes me sad actually that it makes me Even sadder, it makes me think of the Brazil people because you. I do notice it, you know, where are they? Right on X. And you know, it's really unfortunate because there are all the. There is all this fragmentation and at least on X there's a kind of a fairly. Even if you were on all these other places, you could kind of all meet on X.
00:43:43.021 - 00:44:02.437, Speaker A: And it kind of makes me think of the Brazilians there. I hope that gets sorted out pretty soon. I think it will, I suspect one way or another, because both sides have an interest in resolving it. But who knows. Interesting comment from Calo Observation. Neuro Color. Look at this.
00:44:02.437 - 00:44:50.415, Speaker A: Four days ago, veteran crypto art collector Token Angels acquired Qualia Matrix, a study in color perception and minimalism, an animated 4x4 GIF that is rendered differently when scaled up in browsers devices due to their use of different anti aliasing implementations. And I'm kind of back to our discussion on if you make a physical of a digital, it is a different artwork. And I would just say that is ontologically, philosophically true. It is a different work and it is a different experience. And this to me is kind of a case in point. So let's say I take my 4 by 4 pixel and it's like these and I put it on different screens. And these different screens render it differently.
00:44:50.415 - 00:45:29.121, Speaker A: Those are different artworks. And so I just think this is super interesting as we kind of figure out philosophically what it means to render digital works in different ways, especially physically. There's something that I think is worth a very simple idea that's worth kind of internalizing here. And so sold to for $5,000 Qualia Matrix, study in color perception. I'm not sure if they. Let's see if there's. So here it is, the first version, the second version, right? Pretty cool minimal art, I have to say.
00:45:29.121 - 00:46:13.037, Speaker A: I mean that's pretty rad, you know, like there's something being said here quite interesting and what this is for those that might not realize, it's like four tiny little pixels blown up, right? Maximized. And this is how different screens deal with it. So saying something about the technology, right? And about rendering and about making things physical, right? That whole process that we've been describing here. Very cool post from Neuro Color Vinnie Hager with. I'm not sure which one this is, if this is deluxe paint or what it is computer class, but we see a Vinnie Hager there on the. At least in the drawings here, as you see here. So look at how great that looks.
00:46:13.037 - 00:46:25.711, Speaker A: So it's pretty cool. I mean, we see the style using different tool, a new tool here or an old tool. Pretty cool. Here's Mech. Txt. Maybe, maybe, maybe. Not sure what Mech is up to here.
00:46:25.711 - 00:46:53.041, Speaker A: Kind of looks like a game is being created here. So isn't that interesting? So playing. So what is. Yeah, it looks like proceed almost like a choose your own adventure type game. Pretty cool from Mech here. So we've seen this in a few different. From a few different perspectives here, which is this.
00:46:53.041 - 00:47:31.937, Speaker A: We've seen it with Retro Manny, this relationship between video games and art, particularly in the digital sphere. We've seen it with Retro Manny kind of taking more of a video game and then kind of artifying it. And here we're seeing, I guess we'd call a video game structure, but more the choose your own adventure and then putting different art pieces. Right. We've also seen, you know, glitch ROMs where video games are literally existing. Video games are taken and then kind of wrecked and destroyed through the hex, you know, through changing the code. So it's a very interesting relationship here.
00:47:31.937 - 00:48:19.245, Speaker A: It's. There's a lot to be, you know, there's a lot of territory here because again, I'd argue one of the defining features of many of these artists, what I call the second generation of digital art, is kind of aesthetic appreciation for digital imagery whose genesis came out of playing video games. In other words, when they were kids and playing video games, there were some beautiful screens that they saw. And ultimately, as you grow older and you start to make art and everything, then you start going, well, why? Why isn't that art on a subliminal or a conscious level? Right? What's wrong with that? And all of a sudden, hey, I'm going to make this pixel art. Let's continue Innovare. Hello, September. In my mind, I am still on August 23rd in Montreal.
00:48:19.245 - 00:48:45.019, Speaker A: I was in Buenos Aires, so I couldn't have gone to this interestingly. But maybe next year. Thank you, Eitzel Labs, for the great documentation. Indeed, this is fantastic documentation. Again, the backlight. Not only is this done brilliantly with the CRTs, even this, you know, putting. And this looks like a little tablet here with the artist and the QR code.
00:48:45.019 - 00:49:20.845, Speaker A: And then the lighting, though, this is totally professional, isn't it? Like, and I mean, that's almost an understatement to call it that. Like, this is. This is really impressive, isn't it? And here are a few more. Karim Safa A late thank you to rgb Montreal thank you to Matteo for selecting my work. Shout out to Strano, Nicholas Sassoon and Eitzolabs and everybody else involved. And so this kind of work here, like Cream Sapphires, looks spectacular on screens again, as I always call it here, the alchemy of scale. And then look at this.
00:49:20.845 - 00:49:39.387, Speaker A: And you could call it the alchemy of repetition to a certain degree here. And look at this. This almost looks like Ultima 4 layout, but it's not right. And this is probably just a quick screen. Beautiful. And there looks like TVs. I don't even know what's going on in that one.
00:49:39.387 - 00:50:12.591, Speaker A: And then here, interesting mirroring going on here. So super interesting from cream safa RGB Montreal. This to me as far as digital art in 2024, this was a major happening. I'm starting to realize here kind of slowly coming to the realization this was a major happening from my perspective over here. Let's continue. Blue Retina hotline ping on RGB Montreal Freedom Int on Zora base until the 18th as part of your quote, your summer art collection link on pin. So also Blue Retina here on the screen.
00:50:12.591 - 00:50:39.585, Speaker A: So I believe that's the work and you just see how great these looks. Another way to do it would be to make this just massive but still looking wonderful here on the. On the wall projector and digital art, a wonderful thing. Of course I follow Blue Retina. That is a glitch on X neutral. So also another happening this summer here. This was Neutro after I left, the weekend after I left Buenos Aires.
00:50:39.585 - 00:51:26.927, Speaker A: Here's just more awesome footage. I mean you just see how big again, look at the TVs and this juxtaposition of these old TVs with the projecting, even putting some plants, more TVs. This is very do it yourself, isn't it? Like in a sense bringing it back to moma. Like a certain kind of standard is starting to be established here and it's going to be very interesting because I would argue some even fancy galleries may not be able to make it as nice as what we're seeing here. It's going to be very interesting. Like my eyes are open for seeing. Okay, what is the established kind of art world? How are they showing it again, right? And of course you know, a lot of great stuff and well done and.
00:51:26.927 - 00:51:52.745, Speaker A: But now there's like, there's kind of a more on par. This isn't NFT London, this isn't Tezpol, right? As we were mentioning a couple episodes ago. And again you just see these Exciting this young people at work, you know, it's awesome. People at work. And look at this. Look at this display here. That was in.
00:51:52.745 - 00:52:09.869, Speaker A: That was in. At the crypto conference. At the Elif Crypto conference. A very. And like, you see Captain Kapn's work there. It fits the screen perfectly. When I saw that Bolz was showing it to me, I was like, this looks like it could be in the finest art galleries in the world.
00:52:09.869 - 00:52:36.339, Speaker A: This work here, all of them. There's mental noise and others not sure who that is. So all to say, just super cool. And one more from Neutro Arts here. Looks like a happening, doesn't it? I mean, what video, what amazing video they have going on here. So just super cool also. So we saw this earlier.
00:52:36.339 - 00:52:50.615, Speaker A: Okay. That post from Little Cakes was in the comments. Retro Manny, back to the grind again. So 3D printing. So we've looked at a lot of plotting. Now we're seeing 3D printing at work. So just very cool.
00:52:50.615 - 00:53:15.471, Speaker A: Manny working on several fronts here. And here's. I want to bring this up last episode. Look at this physical. So again, printing on wood. Solving a lot of issues with digital art on wood here from Lily Illo. Look at how spectacular that looks, right? This isn't inkjet on paper.
00:53:15.471 - 00:53:42.905, Speaker A: It's inkjet probably on wood. This is gorgeous. And kind of a much simpler solution than trying to emulate the paint strokes is actually just finding a textured surface. You know, we saw that to a certain degree with Element Li. Right. Putting on a brown paper bag or whatever your medium is, or cardboard, you know, burning into cardboard. This is quite, you know, stunning, what we see here.
00:53:42.905 - 00:54:00.313, Speaker A: So look at how good that looks. An original artwork. You know, again, this is not the original artwork here. Like, this is a different artwork. The way it's being rendered here. It is a different experience, a different work. Turo Moto Mt.
00:54:00.313 - 00:54:21.209, Speaker A: So working on oil in the. In the studio here. A nice square canvas here. So Moda mt, who, of course, I follow GM friends. After six months without a touch of oil, here we go again. So cool to see these artists working in several mediums. And of course, we see the signature butterflies there and what looks like the Moto Mt character.
00:54:21.209 - 00:54:57.147, Speaker A: And here's Lucas, Lucas Ox from the streets to the streets, putting the artwork online. And there's a Julian. And here is Pamela Chiron and more. So as you see there, Aleph, the big crypto conference, massive crypto conference there in Buenos Aires. Very interesting what they're doing over there. Nicholas Sassoon, RGB So look at how interesting this is. I wonder, are these different? They are.
00:54:57.147 - 00:55:25.877, Speaker A: They're slightly different reds. I was looking at the numbers underneath, and this is a very cool way to do it. So slightly different versions of RGB here. I assume this is the pure one on the top, but who knows? Just interesting, interesting. From Nicholas Sassoon here, Dan Control airs. So as we move into the artwork here, and as you can see, this is looks like an Air Force One shoe. From a distance, you almost can't even tell what it is.
00:55:25.877 - 00:55:55.281, Speaker A: It almost gets abstracted. Interestingly, a brilliant work again by Dan Control. Very conceptually cool artwork. Using one rendition of a shoe and then repeating it and, you know, again, just making, repeat, repeat, repeat. Just making many artworks from elements here. So, I mean, so you just see the endless possibilities here. Working in digital, you can take your layer and then just repeat it endlessly.
00:55:55.281 - 00:56:13.017, Speaker A: I mean, he could do 10, you know, you could do here. Like, I mean, there's maybe 12 here. Maybe you could do five, five by five, right. You could change all sorts of different things. So. And then you could start rendering physically. And how am I going to render? Okay, maybe I'll print this on wood.
00:56:13.017 - 00:56:26.859, Speaker A: Maybe I'll, you know. So all very interesting. All very interesting. Another Dan Control. That was only an edition of 10, by the way, for 10 tezos. Still available, by the way, Dan Control. This is on foundation.
00:56:26.859 - 00:56:51.341, Speaker A: So putting out a few works here. Love the combination of modern objects. Here we have a fork, we have a PF PlayStation game controller. We have an eraser almost that you'd find in school. And we also have a toothbrush. I think I buy those toothbrushes, so. And then a beautiful kind of mauve background there from Dan Control.
00:56:51.341 - 00:57:03.525, Speaker A: Delete everything. Great title. Here's another one. So putting works on foundation. And here you see a beer, lipstick. Not sure what the. Is that an orange cone? Again, reusing elements.
00:57:03.525 - 00:57:22.145, Speaker A: These are all, I think, from previous artworks. Now let's put them in a new composition. This is super interesting. What's going on here? So, blue background here, auction starting at 0.15 ETH. And just minted on September 2nd. Super duper interesting.
00:57:22.145 - 00:57:44.715, Speaker A: Another kind of gradient artist of sorts here. Nev. 1914, another plant. And again, my eye just gravitates towards this outrageous line here, this bright white line. And there too. And looked like almost being done with a. With a mouse, perhaps, but who knows? And then all of this wildness in here.
00:57:44.715 - 00:58:00.075, Speaker A: Something very special about Nev. 1914. Show them. Almost every show, I believe, out of Argentina. I have to. I never got to meet Nev 1914. But next time I really hope to.
00:58:00.075 - 00:58:11.715, Speaker A: Let's continue. Yuri J Mini oven. So a new Yuri J. Super prolific Yuri J. Kind of on a roll seemingly. And look at the background here. I mean, look at the textures.
00:58:11.715 - 00:58:52.687, Speaker A: As a hen collector was pointing out here, look at this psychedelic coffee here. It's pretty spectacular actually, what's going on here? And again, just like letting the errors kind of shine through. As Warhol would say, you know, what is it? Embrace the mistakes, right? And then here we have weird composition. I mean, when you try and understand what this is, it kind of looks like a dollhouse type structure or something with this miniature, you know, kitchen here. And then a big piece of coffee, a big cup of coffee or tea, I guess that's tea with a beautiful mosaic filter there. And then a matchbox. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.
00:58:52.687 - 00:59:10.271, Speaker A: I mean, look at the textures here. Mini oven edition of 15 sold out at. How much is Yuri selling? 20 tazos. So nice move by Uri J here. Posting this work here. Maybe a work in progress, perhaps finished. Not sure.
00:59:10.271 - 00:59:28.585, Speaker A: But it feel, it feels like you kind of see again, we're lifting the veil here a little bit behind Yuri J's work in this piece. Beautiful. Here's machine airbrush art. K. So just super interesting. Always humor in machines. Work kind of, you know, edgy work here.
00:59:28.585 - 00:59:52.905, Speaker A: Kind of looks like a gun, kind of looks like a cartoon character here. Not exactly sure what's going on here. Edgy work, edgy background from the great machine here. How much is this selling for? 10 Tezos edition of 30. And how many left? Only still 27 left. So maybe this was just minted yesterday. So machine with a new work here.
00:59:52.905 - 01:00:16.335, Speaker A: And yeah, just a really cool digital artist in their own right as well as all the physicals that we've been following here. And here has ruble waffle. Oh, this is on Rodeo. Another one Private Dancer. So this is on Rodeo as well. Waffles saying in a comment how really enjoying working there. It is a fun platform, I will say that.
01:00:16.335 - 01:00:45.667, Speaker A: I mean my reservations are, you know, I've mentioned them a few times here. It's really, it is, as people have pointed out, the spotification of digital art. It's sort of like. So yeah, so I, I always like when I go to mint there, let's say a waffles work. It's sort of with a lot of reservations and a lot of questions and a lot of. Because yeah, in a sense, like it's not working that well for you know, and I think, you know, also what goes through my head. I think of the people in Argentina that I know who also who are doing.
01:00:45.667 - 01:01:08.719, Speaker A: Making good money or some money. Good money in Argentina with what, you know, the previous version of Zora. And all of a sudden that's taken away from them. And you know that it matters to those people. Like it's real money. Right? You know, why does Argentina embrace crypto so much? Right? It's because there's. You don't have the same opportunities there that you might have, you know, in other countries.
01:01:08.719 - 01:01:36.117, Speaker A: Right? So that also goes through my head. Anyways, let's continue here. Alexalon, Ed Merola. And again, I feel anybody should be able to mint wherever they want, as I've said previously, and with no judgment about it. But those are the thoughts that go through my head. So beautiful, right? I mean, edgy, almost looking like a bit of collage being pasted in here. And beautiful edgy work here by Ed Morola.
01:01:36.117 - 01:01:54.269, Speaker A: Nice. Very crisp dithering here in the pixel art. And also in this kind of the frame gone awry. The frame gone wild here. So wild work here. And I think Alex Ale times Elon. Maybe Brazil bans Twitter.
01:01:54.269 - 01:02:18.125, Speaker A: Elon enemy of democracy. So again, it would be pretty brutal to be cut off on X as the Brazilians are right now. I hope they solve that sometime soon. The myth. Good morning. Where are we? So new work by the myth now on Tezos. Maybe the sales weren't happening on Super Rare.
01:02:18.125 - 01:02:41.007, Speaker A: I'm sure they will sell at some point. So maybe myth going back to Tezos here. These very poetic works. And again we see the color of the clothing reflected by these homunculi, as I call them, are small figures in the painting window. Right. And it's ambiguous whether this is a painting or a window. Probably a window sill.
01:02:41.007 - 01:03:04.783, Speaker A: Based on the perspective, I think we could say interesting piece here. Beautifully painted, a great color as ever by the myth. So more kind of narrative painting style by the myth. Love the foot, by the way. 35 Tezos edition of 10 and they are moving, half gone. Let's continue. Here is Walk, Madonna with the child, St.
01:03:04.783 - 01:03:18.025, Speaker A: Anthony of Padua and St. Roch St. Rock. So more paintings here. I love these works by Walk. I want to get one at one point. Beautiful remix, digital remix.
01:03:18.025 - 01:03:42.003, Speaker A: Really pastiche of these works. So sold for 11 tazos for a one of one walk one of one. Fantastic deal. Olivia Olivera Durdevic Messiah Complex edition of three. I'm not sure if we looked at this one, but also Kind of having a kind of a. Not quite a spray, but almost kind of a spray look. This is a digital work and here we see.
01:03:42.003 - 01:03:58.403, Speaker A: I don't think we looked at it, but we may have Messiah complex. This is 25 tazos and two are listed. Olivera Durdevic. Big shout out. Thank you for the comments. By the way, here's Santiago me fixing my car with the power of my heart. So I guess if you want to help Santiago.
01:03:58.403 - 01:04:33.569, Speaker A: It sounds like the car is broken and so you can help Santiago fix his car by minting one of these open editions here. As you see, beautifully pixelated abstract piece here. Open edition for three tazos, 48 minted so far. So on on his way, but probably needs more than that. Probably needs a new car at some point, but that's obviously easier said than done, especially for artists. Here, one page zine, also by Santiago. Edition of 13 at auction for 10 tezos.
01:04:33.569 - 01:04:48.985, Speaker A: And let's see what this is. Kind of an interesting black and white take on a. On a Santiago abstract. Almost on a piece of pa. It looks like a PDF. It's a PDF. That is hilarious.
01:04:48.985 - 01:05:02.345, Speaker A: One page zine. So changing the format. Interestingly, rather than it being a GIF or JPEG, it is a PDF. Interestingly. Anatomy. This was quite brilliant. Perfect loop, September 3rd.
01:05:02.345 - 01:05:21.962, Speaker A: Love this piece. This is awesome. Love the title, love the concept. So a figure made of Windows icons. Quite brilliant. Love it. And it's on Fake Whales Art market edition of 15 and now 58 tezos.
01:05:21.962 - 01:05:53.861, Speaker A: Sold for primary art for 15. So sold out. Nice work there, Rennie Fish, what's your story? So kind of an edgy work where we see the vine, the thorned vine here seeming to circle this figure, who seems to be kind of sad here. Beautiful work by Rinny Fish. Not sure where it's going to be minted, but very interesting and beautifully animated. Kind of reminds me of the work that was on bitcoin, which did sell, by the way. Here is Jan Lucas Migone.
01:05:53.861 - 01:06:09.765, Speaker A: Beautiful work. Kind of reminds me of the Olympics. Where is my crypto mind in the head collection. My body doesn't know where my thoughts these are these days, so I keep running in flames. I never stop. Animated GIF loop, freehand, digital oil painting, rotoscoping pixel art details. Wow.
01:06:09.765 - 01:06:31.525, Speaker A: So maybe that is where the pixel art is in the skull as well as when the skeleton turns blue. Pretty cool work, isn't it? So, Jan Lucas Magone. And this is 666 edition of 66. And there are 29 left. So selling Quite briskly and well. Pretty cool piece. Here's Rada nuked.
01:06:31.525 - 01:06:57.905, Speaker A: So Tezrat's 2024 special. Tapping into the collective unconscious. Fear of nuclear war. Nuclear Armageddon. Quite a beautiful work, isn't it? Love the green teeth and a signature rat by Rata and beautifully animated mushroom cloud there. Edition of 22. And this is selling for 1790, so still available.
01:06:57.905 - 01:07:13.253, Speaker A: And here's Moses. Moses. Mosestro. This is Mosestro by Uyo66. Also on Tazos object. You're really seeing the resiliency of Tezos right now. I'd argue.
01:07:13.253 - 01:07:36.347, Speaker A: Like you're seeing these artists that went all around. But like Tezos just has such a rich collector. Like artists keep coming back to tezos. Like OYO66, another great example, you know, it's really interesting. So edition of 10 for 10 Tezos and look, I mean six gone. It's wonderful what's happening here. I mean there are a lot of collectors on Tezos.
01:07:36.347 - 01:07:50.885, Speaker A: There are a lot of great artists on Tezos. It's very interesting what's happening here. So here looks like a work in progress. Quampa Color Type Study and Microsoft Paint. And just beautiful. Actually. We'll see if we can make this larger.
01:07:50.885 - 01:08:17.785, Speaker A: This is the max. So just a screenshot. Almost has a Picasso feel to it, doesn't it? Brilliant. Using what I think is the new Microsoft Paint, the new version of it. Just really cool. From Quampa, here's Eboy, who I have to thank Kiro for pointing me to a pioneer of pixel art. And it's actually three people actually I discovered, found out yesterday.
01:08:17.785 - 01:08:48.171, Speaker A: So on Louis Vuitton here we're looking at these. I believe they're scarves. Maze of precious saffron. So here's one version and let me just maximize this for you. So you see the pixel art here again, I think it was the early 2000s when they started very self consciously making, you know, art that is pixel art, you know, And I love this Louis Vuitton and even the logo. So very cool there. Here's another one.
01:08:48.171 - 01:09:13.265, Speaker A: Now is this just changing the colors? Right? So we're discussing how you can change mediums. We're discussing how you can repeat, as we saw with Dan Control, you can just recolor and you have a new artwork. We saw that with Lewis Osborne. We've seen that with Heidi Rockette, we've seen that with Kapn. It's really endless what you can do in digital Haiti. Rockette. Foose.
01:09:13.265 - 01:09:43.085, Speaker A: That sounds like a German word for foot, maybe referring to football perhaps. And a very cool abstract here from Haiti Rockette using all sorts of different kinds of sized pixels here. Just awesome big squares here, small squares here. Different kind of dithering. A beautiful abstract from Haiti rocket edition of one and accepted an offer of 200 tezos. Nice sale, I tell you. Haiti rocket one of ones are a precious thing.
01:09:43.085 - 01:10:07.051, Speaker A: Here's another one by Haiti Rockette. Bish. Leave the interpretation to you. So very edgy work here, but again, kind of looks like it belongs in the wall of a gallery. So just interesting and edgy work here from Haiti Rockette. And again, look at these sales 69 tazos. Very nice sales edition of 3.
01:10:07.051 - 01:10:31.705, Speaker A: Videk visuals. Here is animated abstract pixel artwork again, I think only on Instagram. I haven't seen it on the blockchain. So interesting work here by Vitek Visuals. Started looking at them recently. Here's Pixel fool coming back also on Tezos. You know, I think put a workout recently, but see what I'm saying, Like there is a resilience here.
01:10:31.705 - 01:10:49.241, Speaker A: Here's Pixel fool, old school OG of the Tazos ecosystem. This is 77 Tezos edition of 10. And look at that. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. It looks like it's sold. Maybe one left. I mean that's real money.
01:10:49.241 - 01:11:17.271, Speaker A: You know, a few hundred bucks there. Cream Safa, probably four or five hundred bucks. Cream Sapphire. Just a cool GIF on X. You know, zooming in on what looks like maybe some sort of ASCII text rendition. Dan Kelly and Draw Dog Tuesday I have come on to the Dan Kelly into the Dan Kelly club here with this really interesting artist. Again, pixel art, doing the dog thing.
01:11:17.271 - 01:11:38.075, Speaker A: Very experimental compositions. And then here we have a screen being recorded, right? And that is the work, right? Draw Dog choose by Dan Kelly. Not sure if that's minted anywhere. I didn't see a link. I didn't see a link there. Here is Manatal and I believe it's just Manatal. And also with P with the one.
01:11:38.075 - 01:11:54.419, Speaker A: Maybe there's a chorus with audio. Too much fun. Pixel art. Nice two colors. Love the color. Very nice color. And we're probably going to see.
01:11:54.419 - 01:12:05.979, Speaker A: We're probably going to see. Exactly. And then so this of course could be also physical. Screen print. One color screen print. Right. Or you could do Riso as a lot of people do with pixel art.
01:12:05.979 - 01:12:29.759, Speaker A: Especially with big pixels. It works quite well. Speaking of pixel art, right Click Dead, also known as I think brain dead here. Look at this. Very cool on super rare. So a pixel artwork doing very well. Love the keyboard has rare on the keyboard, kind of one of these modern MIDI keyboards and eyeballs over here a little.
01:12:29.759 - 01:12:49.353, Speaker A: And we saw like, I think we saw a small version of this again, reusing elements here. I think we saw a small. A larger version of this small thing. We see here again, kind of a different take on the pixel art factory. This is at a reserve of 0.33 ETH and minted on September 2nd. Cool colors as well.
01:12:49.353 - 01:13:16.855, Speaker A: Here's Hermipe pixel art again. Very cool, I think made on a phone, if I'm not mistaken here. 8 bit art. Very interesting style here from Hermepe pixel art. I don't think they meant on the blockchain Element Li. By using bright colors to represent dark spaces, the specific environmental relationship is amplified into an abstract void, solid relationship. So the clarity is reduced, but the ambiguity or the participation of the viewers increased.
01:13:16.855 - 01:13:56.841, Speaker A: So all to say, using the lack of light very consciously of the black when creating this kind of minimal experimental pixel art, being very conscious that the light is not coming through on the black, I think is another way of phrasing that. So very interesting piece and here doing the opposite. So playing with the inverse and what it means, so to speak. Very minimal kind of conceptual thinking. Here's another piece by Element Ly also super interesting kind of minimal colors here. Entrance and exit. Very just very cool and suggestive.
01:13:56.841 - 01:14:17.987, Speaker A: I think we saw this two tabs ago. We did. And here is KF Kyle Flemmer fully on chain. Pixel art inscribed on Tezos. So all sorts of work being put on the Tezos blockchain. Not needing IPFS interplanetary file server. Just put it all on chain again.
01:14:17.987 - 01:14:37.415, Speaker A: I'm kind of like also Bitcoin could be pretty interesting. KF Glitchtown Arcade 38. So this is a Nintendo glitch rom. Nice big frame here. Very cool work here. Very abstracted out edition of one. And now only one Tezos at auction just listed.
01:14:37.415 - 01:15:08.877, Speaker A: Psycho Futurist. I have a reason to push the rock is we continue here, interesting background, kind of peach background. And we see what looks like a baby going through a fetus going rolling down a mountain here with some dithering gradients behind. And here we see maybe it's an alien going into a circle and rolling down. Not exactly sure what Psycho Futurist is up to. Have a reason to push the rock. Edition of 12 selling for six tazos.
01:15:08.877 - 01:15:25.705, Speaker A: And look at this. It's pretty interesting, isn't it? The market. It's a fantastic market here on Tezos. Elna Frederick 46. Look at how awesome this is. Edition of 10. And here you see a old Microsoft Windows logo.
01:15:25.705 - 01:15:41.669, Speaker A: I don't think they used it anymore. And look at all the offers coming in at, you know, 10 to 12 tazos for this edition of 10. Fantastic. Chrome void. We saw this in the community. Three wojaks. And so I think Wojak is that figure from the memes.
01:15:41.669 - 01:16:02.567, Speaker A: And look at how awesome this looks. This is brilliant. There's something about this that just looks kind of screams preciousness and value and beauty. And these again, it's kind of like that. Whole variations, endless, you know, here's one version, here's another version. Here's another. And I love this Warholian title.
01:16:02.567 - 01:16:24.511, Speaker A: Three Wojaks. This is awesome. You know, edition of one. Well, let's see what happens. I mean, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Here is Yoda sensitive work edition of one at auction now at 36 tazos. So video glitch art continuing to do very well here with what looks like an abstract.
01:16:24.511 - 01:16:47.585, Speaker A: And you see almost like the CRT lines in the work here. And you see all of the work being done rescanned with a digital camera off a CRT tv. So again, recording the screens. I love it. Bosque Grazias Fantasy chapters number six. Big shout out to Bosque Grazias. Great to see you in Berlin and thank you again for the epic gifts here.
01:16:47.585 - 01:17:13.645, Speaker A: And look at how beautiful this is. So working on the road. If you're looking, if you want to see the setup, if you want to be inspired by a mobile setup here across an ocean, you should see last episode where I show Busque Grazia's studio. Pretty awesome edition of one and sold for 12 tezos. Here is Kiro with a work called Bark. This is on for 0.01 ETH.
01:17:13.645 - 01:17:46.959, Speaker A: And a cool video painting here again, looking like real painting, quote unquote, underneath here as a source. And here you see it being turned into and glitched out with video. Very cool on Ethereum. Renki Fukui. So more interesting work here from Renki again, probably there's. It's hard to think of an artist that's been shown more on this show just for the consistently interesting animated abstracts here from Renki. Edition of one often doesn't list them.
01:17:46.959 - 01:18:11.925, Speaker A: Sometimes they do. You can always put an offer in for a Renki work then. This is Simulacro. And this is in the fake whale art market. And only 33 seconds. Nice kind of colors here. Almost a haunted work.
01:18:11.925 - 01:18:44.603, Speaker A: It was awesome to meet Simulacro at Neutro at The Neutro art space. You can find it on their YouTube. The interview we did so on Fake Whale 9 Tezos Edition of 15 and here is Mika Aladev. So of course we saw all those. All of the. We saw all of those. I guess what would we call those kind of glitched out pixel art.
01:18:44.603 - 01:19:04.821, Speaker A: All those portraits that Mika Odev did. Now doing glitch 3d model edition of one. This is listed for 125 tazos. So pretty interesting piece here. This was brilliant. Sean Keenan, so strange thing retweeted this. This is gorgeous.
01:19:04.821 - 01:19:34.841, Speaker A: This is one Tazos. This is an edition of 10. And it kind of reminds me of the Mickey's a little bit. This is a brilliant AI artwork here. Sean Keenan and I think like has been putting out like I went to their profile. I think they're just putting out is you always got to be careful loading stuff up. But I think they're just, you know, it's kind of a, you know, I hesitate to say it's a mistake here but it.
01:19:34.841 - 01:20:07.805, Speaker A: Sometimes you can over. It's good to curate your work because I think this came out like two days ago. Wow, look at that one. You see like if put it this way, because you can over. It's like, oh heck, you know, Joshua Sobble was pointing this out in an earlier thing. You can kind of over supply your market, right? Because if you. If Sean Keenan had just released these three works here and then put like 30 tazos on them, you know, a one of one, you could probably 50 tazos and they'd probably sell.
01:20:07.805 - 01:20:27.191, Speaker A: So it shows the value in curating your work. So here, this is awesome too. I mean these are gorgeous. And I'm even, you know, sacrificing or frozen video here. Look at this. Hopefully this comes back. Yeah, like just interesting again.
01:20:27.191 - 01:20:58.001, Speaker A: I don't know what it is with the Mickey and the Donalds and AI artwork, but they work pretty awesome. Selling Ilay for syndrome for picking one up. Here's another one. These are awesome. So you know, but I mean releasing like dozens and dozens of work. It looks like a dozen work a day, like 10, 20 works a day. Which is maybe overkill because the problem with it is it makes it feel like it's not worth as much and that maybe you are just pressing a button, but you're probably not.
01:20:58.001 - 01:21:12.497, Speaker A: Right. So I would. Yeah, don't over supply the market too quickly. But anyways, beautiful works. I guess that's the moral of the story is they're beautiful works. Here's RJ the birth of Morpheus longing. And of course, do whatever you want to do as an artist.
01:21:12.497 - 01:21:42.153, Speaker A: Just personal thoughts in a journal here. Love the love. What RJ is doing here. I love the addition because here we seem to see an AI source, but it's starting to evolve into something where all of a sudden we're seeing different renditions. We see the light changing here on this original AI source and then adding a little bit of kind of RJ screen action here in the frame. Addition of one. And they're selling 25 tezos.
01:21:42.153 - 01:22:05.899, Speaker A: Here's another one. Classic RJ kind of screensaver thing, machine work. So very interesting piece here. Love these kind of almost David Hockney like compositions with the person looking on in silence. Sold to Ahek, who were just mentioning here the Birth of Morpheus Nature. So selling for 25 tazos. So very interesting series here.
01:22:05.899 - 01:22:26.753, Speaker A: September 3rd edition of one. And here, demon Ego. And I suspect this video here is AI. So continuing to just put anything and everything within these structures. Just awesome. From Demon ego edition of one and sold for 44 tazos. It's booming out here.
01:22:26.753 - 01:22:45.773, Speaker A: Canxapita edition of one. This sold to unknown collector at auction for 66 tazos. And here it is. Wild kind of work here and interactive. When you put the cursor over, it spins. So very cool. Interactive artwork from Kenxapata.
01:22:45.773 - 01:23:08.677, Speaker A: Here is Martin Joe, who of course I follow another GM bear with coffee. This time with the mountains in the background. Always awesome. From Martin Jo and I believe that was on object. Here is Yoao Salazar. Crash. So animating again, taking a 3D real world object and then digitizing it.
01:23:08.677 - 01:23:25.309, Speaker A: It's a new artwork, right? So here adding some movement and it kind of looks like a trading floor of sorts. Love the screen here. This is on foundation for 0.15 ETH. And then into the physicals we go. Nugget brain. Look at this.
01:23:25.309 - 01:23:47.179, Speaker A: Tom and Jerry a shirt. This artist is so hilarious and so good. Their paintings, remember the vhs? The paintings of the VHS tapes. And there's like a triptych. Just such an awesome artist. Love this artist. This is a someone Charlie Stein, good friend of mine, who is in New York, I believe right now.
01:23:47.179 - 01:24:11.885, Speaker A: And making really interesting kind of edgy works here. A lot of vinyls, hypodermic needles. Just edgy works. And executing very well. Oil on canvas, not very big, 25 by 18 by 6. There's something to be said for small works. Maybe easier to sell, easier as a collector to just go, you know, I don't need a warehouse for this Thing Here we have a new show by Jesse Makison.
01:24:11.885 - 01:24:35.715, Speaker A: Makinson. And this is September 5 to 8. Come to Margate. So the new season here is beginning, as you can see. And very cool kind of surreal artist here. Almost looks like a painting in the background. Maybe that's the artist who knows Here it's not gallery again, I'd say one of the, you know, if I had to give an award and I kind of hate award shows, just be super blunt with that.
01:24:35.715 - 01:25:03.673, Speaker A: I don't really buy into the whole award idea, but the if I had to give an award for, you know, Twitter Instagram account of the year of like 2024, even 2020, like, I'd have to say it is. It's not a gallery. Here is Rocky and Mr. T. You know, I think that's Rocky 4, Rocky 3, not sure. Schwarzer. Stefan Schwartzer.
01:25:03.673 - 01:25:48.351, Speaker A: This is Rizodruk. So again, Rizzo, which is basically using photocopiers and you see how well color photocopiers and you see how well pixelation works here, right? So again, the rendering here changes the artwork, right? So this original artwork, whatever it was. And you know, if I had to guess what this is, this is probably a pencil, a colored pencils drawing, which is kind of what Stefan Schwarzer is known for. It's probably been put into a computer and some of it pixelated and then it's rezoned traveling through the mediums and then you have this kind of wild, you know, piece of image. Wild like an artwork. Wild artwork. And finally, it's not gallery again.
01:25:48.351 - 01:26:15.459, Speaker A: Jason, Frania, look at this one. And the humor, what I call the new humor here it is an alien, very simple airbrush. Again, we've seen this style a few times with the airbrush contrasting with just kind of brush painted in the background. It works like a charm. Beautiful contrast. And here are the great Walk, who of course I follow. Stealth, I think an F19, is that what you'd call it? Or a Stealth.
01:26:15.459 - 01:26:30.415, Speaker A: F35. Not even sure. Rad drawing from walk. And that is your show, my friends. Thank you for joining me again and until I guess Monday, take care and have a great weekend. And thank you for joining me and all the support.
