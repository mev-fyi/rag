00:00:06.920 - 00:00:44.380, Speaker A: I'd say everything's going well. Actually, I'm broadcasting here from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. I was gonna say sunny Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, but this is a rainy, if you can see it, from my hometown, from my kitchen table. My name's Adrian Pokebelly. Artist Journal, June 10, 2024. Making it up as I go along, I want to say crazy jacket, straight jacket and all, as Lee Perry used to say, the great Lee Perry, Lee Scratch Perry, straight jacket and all that was from. From my secret laboratory.
00:00:44.380 - 00:01:30.020, Speaker A: Kind of not the most well known album. It was Lee Perry's comeback album in about 1990 after he burned down black arc Studios. If you don't know what I'm talking about, Lee Perry, you know, he's the guy that told Bob Marley tough gong records. So Lee Perry says the story goes where Bob Marley was saying he wanted to start something, and he asked Lee Perry in Jamaica, I want to do something big. I want to do something ambitious here, but I don't know, what should I call it? And Lee Perry said, tough Gong, which is a tough guy. And so was born, supposedly the tough gong records. Anyways, way off topic here.
00:01:30.020 - 00:01:59.708, Speaker A: It continues to be a challenge, but a couple of just show notes here very quickly before we get into this beautiful work of art here by exmortal on Solana. So I just, you know, checking my notifications on Solana on exchange art, which is, you know, an occasional matter here over here. And. Wow, nice one. Nice one from exmortal, but a couple of quick show notes. Internet is fixed in Berlin. I'm in Canada right now, but Internet is fixed in Berlin.
00:01:59.708 - 00:02:20.856, Speaker A: I got it fixed on Monday, but there wasn't time to do the show. And then I took a plane on Tuesday, a week ago to Toronto, and here I'm in Saskatoon. Serious matters here. So thank you for the patience is really what I want to say. Things are starting to manage. I got the kukai wallet. Was giving me a lot of problems.
00:02:20.856 - 00:02:49.162, Speaker A: I got the temple wallet on object. It seems to be working better. Internet seems to be working in Berlin, and the computer's working here so far. So just think just to once again, thank you for the patience as I continue to kind of figure things out and dodge, you know, hurdle obstacles. So look at how beautiful this is. Just a beautiful landscape here. Kind of looks like the cliffs of what I want to say, Dover or something by xmortal.
00:02:49.162 - 00:03:18.296, Speaker A: Let's just take a quick look. Escape xmortal on Solana on explore art sold for one and a half. Sol listed 13 days ago, and then five days ago, big brain gallery purchased it. Big brain, indeed. Let's just see. Digital video playback glitched with analog glitch gear and digital feedback hardware. Color processing and feedback performed with a digital Eurorack module.
00:03:18.296 - 00:03:42.958, Speaker A: Analog glitch performed with a BPMC fluxus duo. So you see everything here captured with Roland V three capture device. M four video mixer used at the end of the chain stabilization. All to say, not easy, actually. Probably you can't even emulate it. But there's something about it. There's something just very rich about this and kind of exciting.
00:03:42.958 - 00:04:35.118, Speaker A: And when I think of the last video I did, it was where the Internet was failing, but it was like that draw and erase, which I only really got to show a part of because of the Internet. But all to say, I'm finding it personally interesting that the newspaper, the imagination, for almost, I guess, four or two episodes in a row, is starting with this glitch stuff, glitch art. And it has before started with glitch art, but I just find it significant. There's a resilience here, a richness that, you know, is, you know, the famous art historian David Hickey said, which I've quoted here before, referring to Rauschenberg, undeniable is undenied. And there's something just kind of magical, shall we say, with this ex mortal work. It's beautiful. And, you know, you see the cascading kind of glitches here.
00:04:35.118 - 00:05:07.088, Speaker A: There's. And you know what it is? You know, as I actually look at this thing, you know what's kind of interesting just before we continue, it's like the waves. I don't know if you can see. Can you see my cursor here? Here we go. See the cursor, the black cursor here. It's like the waves of the tech glitchery is being echoed by the waves in the landscape. And I think that's what maybe is part of the magic here that I am trying to decipher.
00:05:07.088 - 00:05:33.662, Speaker A: And the color is beautiful. The composition is beautiful. I mean, you have the water and the flowers and the cliffs and the sky. So a beautiful kind of, you know, composition here. Video composition, video glitch. Analog video glitch as I rewarm up my brain after a week off here. Okay, so big thank you to rural idol for last week.
00:05:33.662 - 00:06:33.880, Speaker A: You know, one of the huge takeaways of that, of that space was this idea that rural idol, having come out of animation, you know, for, you know, spending, you know, years and years working in an animation studio, saw the work of Burka Bayram in like 2020, 2021 and saw basically, you know, animation loosely summarizing here, animation that was kind of museum, something that could be found in a museum. So which really kind of turned, turned a screw in rural idols head. So that was a wonderful, wonderful space that we had there last week. You can see it in the feed if you want to hear it. And this Wednesday we're going to have limbo. So limbo, of course, you know, as popple calls them, a cult. A cult artist really, on, on many blockchains, but especially object, but, or tazos.
00:06:33.880 - 00:07:07.160, Speaker A: Tazos blockchain, but also can be found, I believe, on foundation, on ethereum and maybe other places, too. So making a comeback or coming back straightjacket and all. And it's going to be on the spaces in the last few months and it's going to be on the spaces this Wednesday. So check that out. I just posted that already getting some few retweets there, which is awesome. And here, if you've never seen Limbo's art before, here's a new one. There's a few bloodbath, the cursed hour part five and makes his own music.
00:07:07.160 - 00:07:33.272, Speaker A: So just really cool art. I went through a limbo phase. Are you lost? Yes. No. You gotta love the video game. I mean, and this goes for two minutes, the video game motif. This is only 20 seconds in of a two minute composition here.
00:07:33.272 - 00:08:00.634, Speaker A: But there was a point when I was just completely obsessed with Limbo's art for about, like, I'd say about a month where when I'd load up object, it's like what's going on on Limbo's market. So anyways, awesome to see and to have Limbo agreeing to come onto the show. So just thrilled about that. Long overdue. Now let's go to the YouTube comments. So predictability is death. So that was the last show.
00:08:00.634 - 00:08:37.616, Speaker A: You know what's kind of weird about this one? This is more than double the most I've ever gotten on a views 2100 views, which is kind of weird because I don't know what's different here. I was wondering like, are people putting predictability into the search engine? Maybe there was a link, not sure, but it really got some traction for whatever reason. This video over and we're at 1500 subscribers. So that is awesome too. So let's just look at the. So thank you everybody for all the support and everything. Let's quickly look at the comments here.
00:08:37.616 - 00:08:58.884, Speaker A: Manatel, thank you so much for sharing my cat art and music. P one again. So we've shown a ton of Mandal's work as well as P one's, a wonderful pixel art collaboration. And we have another one actually, perhaps unsurprisingly at this point, point on today's show. So great to hear from you, manital. Awesome to. Always awesome to hear from the artists.
00:08:58.884 - 00:09:33.984, Speaker A: Human boy, thank you again, Adrian, for your review of my work and for your kind words. So we're gonna. There's a million tabs here. So also another show note, I guess a lot of works there are gonna be on the next show, too. There's kind of a bit of a catching up process that's gonna be done here. And also we're gonna come back to socrates here. I've decided, you know, just, you know, in passing, you know, it's not a new thought, but it's a thought that I've had for 20 years, but it's really echoing in my head right now.
00:09:33.984 - 00:10:06.106, Speaker A: Where shall wisdom be found? Where shall wisdom be found? And, you know, my go to is really Socrates, as many people have over the last 2500 years. So I want to reopen that. There's a lot to go there. We don't need to go super deep, but I just want to incorporate more. Anyways, thank you, human boy, for the comments. We're going to check in with human boy and see what the latest is. After human boy's multi, I think he got over a million views, if memory serves.
00:10:06.106 - 00:10:24.044, Speaker A: Here's Sabato. Awesome to hear from Sabato. And we have a work by Sabato. Actually this show, Godspeed's Poco's Internet. And I think it was. And, you know, very quickly, as fast as I can here, you know what was wrong with my Internet? I didn't know how my Internet worked. It wasn't DSL.
00:10:24.044 - 00:10:49.852, Speaker A: It was just this kind of oval thing that you plugged in the wall. And I never quite understood how it worked. And so I called several times to the repair people and I guess there's a SIM card. It's like a phone, but it's like this oval thing that sends out the, you know, the, the, you know, transmission of the signal. And I think it was just loose. And it always been a little loose, I think because the people, the repair people were like, take it out and put it in a phone. It didn't fit.
00:10:49.852 - 00:11:25.012, Speaker A: Anyway, I put it back in and all of a sudden it felt like it was very snug. So I think it was just loose. So that is. So I think the Internet is totally fixed as far as I maybe even better than before, ironically. So thank you for the prayers, Sabato. I've been watching this girl give a four hour long breakdown of why the immersive Star wars hotel was a failure in lieu of artist journal. It's weirdly fascinating, but it's not the same fam I hope the Berlin Internet Council stops throttling your bandwidth, so it may have been a self inflicted error.
00:11:25.012 - 00:11:37.934, Speaker A: Thank you. Your prayers though were answered thankfully to me. Especially thankfully. DJ Quiro, thanks again. Man. That frame is one of those aura digital frames. That was cool.
00:11:37.934 - 00:11:57.958, Speaker A: I remember that digital art frame not connected to wallet or anything. And Quiro has just collaborated with Francois Gamma with a whole bunch of stunning works. We're going to see a couple, at least one this episode. John Doe I long for predictability. That was hilarious. A couple of funny comments on predictability there. Dima Karlov thank you so much.
00:11:57.958 - 00:12:26.420, Speaker A: Adrian for Artist Journal show thank you. I really appreciate that because it's been a struggle, you know, even today it was a struggle, but we're getting it done. This ship is back. We patched up the hole in the ship, so that is good news. So we are back on our way. It's still going to be sporadic. Another show note, I'm going to Brazil on Sunday, so I may do another show on Friday and then I'll be in Brazil.
00:12:26.420 - 00:12:56.462, Speaker A: Let's see what happens. So it's going to be sporadic. There may be another week off in between, but then when I am back in Berlin, well, actually then we'll do we're going to keep it as normal as we can and back to the the plan is to always go back to the regular schedule, in case anybody's wondering, because it's been pretty sporadic here. I am going to Spain for a week too, so we're going all over the place. So I'm just doing the best that I can. So thank you everybody for the patience again. This is interesting though, poco, assuming you're using chrome.
00:12:56.462 - 00:13:30.712, Speaker A: Looks like it. Have you tried using tab groups? You can save groups of tabs and you'll get a button on your toolbar to open those tabs when you need them. Even if you close the window with the save tab group open, maybe a way you don't have to open all the tabs at one time and keep them open the whole episode might help keep your browser moving normal. So this is excellent advice. I did notice that I've never tried the groups, but I did notice it when it came out like three or four months ago if memory serves, Remy Clay's recommended. Wasn't quite sure what that meant and let me just fix that. Wasn't quite sure, but thank you for the comment.
00:13:30.712 - 00:13:59.538, Speaker A: Remy and DM Perry predictability predictability is death. Lol. Tell that to the sun. As I said to Perry Touche. Terry Perry touche decibel do real artists know that NFTs are a scam? This is actually a super interesting comment. I found nfts are just hyperlinks to a website that hosts the image art. So when they run away with the money and stop paying, they're hosting bye bye to your image.
00:13:59.538 - 00:14:43.108, Speaker A: Of course you still have the HTML link to the old host location of your art and if that is what is valuable to you, I got no problem with that. Lol. Apart from that right click and download any image on the Internet. Like in a sense I'm not worried about the right click save criticism. I actually this one resonates though. I think this is part of the reason why on chain art and why bitcoin personally has been so attractive. Just from I know it's not for everybody bitcoin, but for me personally that is my main concern right now as far as making art and posting it, minting it, inscribing it as you would on it's kind of all about bitcoin for me right now.
00:14:43.108 - 00:15:20.302, Speaker A: And we're going to see actually more about the fees right now, which are all over the place. Nfts are a great test to determine someone is a I don't know what NPC means. I assume it's not very good. I do, you know, again, so just as far as this whole criticism, I actually think it's pretty legit. I don't like I still collect nfts that are a link to, you know, Internet international what is it, intergalactic protocol file service or something. File protocol service or whatever. You know, I'm sympathetic to this idea.
00:15:20.302 - 00:16:06.262, Speaker A: It's not stopping me. And there's of course like right click save as the art gnome there is like a way of backing up your nfts, you know, so this has been thought about. But it's of course it's not as resilient, it's not as immutable as putting something purely on chain. Of course, putting something on chain is really expensive. I had a thought on this though, just finally, which I'm actually really glad I remembered. What if Tezos, because it's a cheap blockchain, actually enabled you to inscribe directly onto the blockchain rather than doing the IFP's that. What if you could go on chain and I know eight baidu, you can do that.
00:16:06.262 - 00:16:53.490, Speaker A: But what if, because Tezos, I would argue that is its main function. I mean, right now when you see the everything that's going on, it seems like most coins aren't really doing anything. Tazos, I would argue and okay, we're back here. Tazos, I would argue, has a real function, which is it's an art blockchain, if not the main, one of the main. Okay, what if you could go on chain on Tazos, I was thinking to myself, it's cheap. Like the fees are cheaper. What if it costs you like $3 and you could just put your jpeg fully on chain? That would really cement, in my opinion, Tezos, as if not one of the art blockchains, the art blockchain.
00:16:53.490 - 00:17:27.831, Speaker A: So interesting thoughts here, decibel that you are provoking. And I'm not totally unsympathetic. I don't think it's a scam. But there are areas of failure that can happen here if all of a sudden a website stops paying its fees, if that's what's going on here. Thank you for the comment. Katherine Spencer Random but you look a little bit like Jeff Goldblum, so not the first time I've heard that. So thank you.
00:17:27.831 - 00:17:48.350, Speaker A: Catherine Spencer. A wonderful comparison here. I just put a, it was my passport picture actually that I recently put up and was getting the comparison there too. So again, thank you for that. Let's see if I can pause this. Also comments here on the show. Again, thank you for the support, the wonderful support.
00:17:48.350 - 00:18:06.010, Speaker A: Most wrong king. Thank you, retro manny. Insane caliber of art on today's show. I agree. I was really remarking to myself of the quality of the art from a personal perspective. Nobody has to agree. It sounds like manny would, or I'm agreeing with manny.
00:18:06.010 - 00:18:31.106, Speaker A: There was some spectacular art on that show throughout the show, but Kappan and Nicholas Dietrich's pieces and there's actually, yeah, they're. And of course, human boy's progress is just incredible. Thanks for sharing our update. And yes, video games soon. Manny's gonna be on in a few weeks, actually on the spaces as well. Long overdue. So as I told Manny, I agree.
00:18:31.106 - 00:18:53.434, Speaker A: Sonic, thank you for the comment. And also walk. Awesome to hear from you, Eli Pritz. Awesome to hear from you as well. What a all star cast here. And I can't remember what this was, but it was deleted. So anyway, all awesome here and thank you everybody for posting.
00:18:53.434 - 00:19:27.526, Speaker A: And look at Martin Joe's awesome work, which I would have loved to have put in the show, but it is here and it's on fake whale. I was just struggling to get this work through and this is a hilarious, beautiful work here on fake whale. And look at this, even this nice texture here and everything. Kind of very suggestive over here. And just a really cool work by Martin. Joe, thank you for posting that in the community. And Oxdk, I think we have a work by OxDK in this week's show.
00:19:27.526 - 00:19:51.938, Speaker A: Thank you for posting. Luke 500 with a free drop on ordinals which is pretty cool. So you can check that out in the community. Just go to my profile and click on community underneath it. Very cool. And Zhu Ziliang with more work here. Very cool work here with the loading button and I think using also downloading buttons on previous works.
00:19:51.938 - 00:20:10.788, Speaker A: And here's Austin, a long time viewer of the show. Thought I'd share my latest work here on artist journal. Enjoy. So awesome. And of course Austin uses the fire, is it not fire hydrant but the fire extinguisher oftentimes with paint. And so here is a digital work. So super cool, minted on base.
00:20:10.788 - 00:20:22.740, Speaker A: Thank you for sharing Austin and Filippo francocci with a rad artwork here. Beautiful works. So thank you everybody. Azerdi Betamax, awesome to hear from you. Love that name. Thank you for posting. Limbo.
00:20:22.740 - 00:20:36.824, Speaker A: Awesome to see you in the community here with these beautiful works. Jumbo juice Gabe, I'm here. Evb work is awesome. So everybody's work is awesome. Yes indeed. And Sandro, great to see you here. Beautiful painting there.
00:20:36.824 - 00:20:54.820, Speaker A: And requiem de la nuez. So just almost looks like is it the lord of the rings there a little bit. So just very cool work here. Ernesto, thank you for posting. Beautiful work. And chrome void, a cool glitch work here. Experimenting on tezos before 2027 comes.
00:20:54.820 - 00:21:13.686, Speaker A: And here's relax actually with a cool kind of crypto art glitch work. So all sorts of interesting work here. 369 thank you. Skull takes thank you. This looks like the camera from Donia. It is. And why thank you for posting and everybody.
00:21:13.686 - 00:21:31.470, Speaker A: So Peterson's psycho futurist. We have works by psycho Futurist this episode as well as simulacru. Thank you everybody for posting. And this is awesome. I'd go into the community and load that up. I would do it right now. Post by curo this on chain art, but I don't want to crash anything here.
00:21:31.470 - 00:21:59.846, Speaker A: Let's continue Rip cache as we go into the comments commentary here. Adobe Cloud services. Products like Photoshop and illustrator have announced that they will now be spying on users project files with their latest terms of service update. And here it is. We've made some changes to Adobe terms of service, clarified that we may access your content through both automated and manual methods, such as for content review. So they say. So they say.
00:21:59.846 - 00:22:27.414, Speaker A: It does feel intrusive. You know, I think, which I think is Rip Cash's point, I think it's a little intrusive. So I agreed with you here. I thought Jimmy cubicle had a good answer to this. Now, Adobe also posted this on June 6. We recently made an update to our terms of service with the goal of providing more clarity on a few specific areas. We have received a number of questions resulting from the update and want to provide some clarity.
00:22:27.414 - 00:23:04.288, Speaker A: So they, this was, I just saw the reply here we have a reply to your terms of service, which is alternatives to Adobe. And so, yeah, in this world, yeah, Adobe's not cheap. So, yeah, so just kind of interesting developments here. So a few days ago, maybe three or four days ago, the fees on bitcoin went insane. So this is a picture of the mempool. It was above 500 v bytes, as they're called. And so I bring this up for a couple of reasons.
00:23:04.288 - 00:23:44.270, Speaker A: First, it was remarkable how high it got. I'd never seen it that high. I'm sure it had been before, but I'd never seen it that high. But, so there's a lot of usage of the network, and I've heard it's been said before. I think it was the guy that runs sovereign in an interview, which is kind of like a L2 roll up on bitcoin is what they're trying to do. And for those that are deep in the weeds here. And he had a really interesting, I can't remember his name, but he had a very interesting insight, which he said, in a year, the computing power on bitcoin is going to be extremely expensive, and it's going to be the most valuable computing power you can get.
00:23:44.270 - 00:24:27.836, Speaker A: So when I was mentioning the fees here at Mempool, and I can even bring this up, this website, I will risk it. Something crashing here. We got as low as eight v bytes, which is like $2 per kilobyte of work if you're inscribing work on ordinals, which is extremely cheap. So you could put a 30 kilobyte file for $60 at one point. Now it's at, as you see here, 31. And, and I want to put a video together, actually I may do that on Friday instead, because it might be easier for me, and still valuable to people who are watching on how to mint on bitcoin. We'll see what the fees are.
00:24:27.836 - 00:24:53.186, Speaker A: If they're cheap, I'll just mint something. Or if they're even in this neighborhood here. So you go to the mempool space, and here's where you can see how busy the network is. But it got down to eight just a couple of weeks ago. So, all to say, if you're interested in this sort of thing, you don't want to sleep on this is what I would say. Let's continue here and let's see if we can get the cursor going. Now.
00:24:53.186 - 00:25:13.180, Speaker A: I'm not sure if it was this person here. There's all sorts of AI debate that happened now. It's like a couple of week old, at least. And I'm not sure if it was this artist. I think it was. But I was actually kind of more impressed. I'd seen these artworks online, and I thought it was a very impressive rendering here.
00:25:13.180 - 00:25:39.294, Speaker A: Physical rendering snapped ajo on secondary and printed 56 cm by 56 cm on Somerset velvet in one fell swoop. So I think this person actually bought the work and then printed it themselves. But I thought, a really nice work. Again, the torn paper here. Again, it reminds me of Warhol. Warhol loved the torn paper. And you see how powerful it is.
00:25:39.294 - 00:26:07.642, Speaker A: It's even like, the edge of the paper contrasts with, like, the sharp edge here. They just kind of what you're going for, which sounds obvious once you say it. But until you really have tried or have heard it, maybe it's not that. Obviously, with physical art, you're really trying to create a kind of preciousness. I brought this up before in previous episodes. And so, as you see here, this is kind of a nice example. So torn paper, special paper, adds to the preciousness.
00:26:07.642 - 00:26:32.058, Speaker A: So I think this is the. There's complaints about AI art. Again. I feel like an old debate that we've already had, really, but it came back. So we do have a few comments on it. But I wanted to show one more interesting rendition of AI art, which is Lily illo, details print on Beechwood. Now, I don't know if you can see this, but there's a reflection up here.
00:26:32.058 - 00:26:53.564, Speaker A: Let me see if I can get the cursor. There's a reflection up here. Up here, where you can start to see the Beechwood. The texture. And a pretty nice solution. Because it almost gives that kind of flaked oil painting look a little bit of texture goes a long way. And let me just see in the risky mood here, as you see here.
00:26:53.564 - 00:27:20.012, Speaker A: So here's the Beechwood. So AI printed on Beechwood. Pretty powerful. I don't know how you do that, but it looks pretty cool. A nice solution here. So rather than paper, you could go wood. So, referring to the AI debate, Joain, a wonderful kind of artist that incorporates AI and collage, digital painting into their works.
00:27:20.012 - 00:28:18.722, Speaker A: We've looked at a ton of Joa in's work in the past. Oh, sure. Let's all gather around and mourn the tragic fate of the art world at the hands of AI models. So, responding to more criticism on AI, this is over a year old, this whole debate, at least, where it's at least a year and a half old, it's truly heartbreaking that AI, which learns from vast collections of images, is somehow seen as stealing, while human artists, who spend years studying the techniques of the masters, are considered inspired. Clearly, AI is the true villain here, mercilessly synthesizing styles and compositions in a way that no human ever has, except for, you know, every artist ever. Forget the fact that AI generated art opens up new avenues for creativity and accessibility. No, let's focus on the dramatic narrative that algorithms are the evil arthem thieves of the modern era, because nothing says progress like resisting technological advancements in the name of preserving a status quo that never actually existed.
00:28:18.722 - 00:29:03.460, Speaker A: So, Joain, not taking it, not taking this line down Yoa in is like not having it, shall we say. You know what I was thinking as kind of adding to yoa ins point here? I thought of the, weirdly, I thought of the cut up method, and we don't have time or bandwidth here to go into the third mind. William Burroughs, Brian Geysen. It's pretty short. You can get PDF's online. But really, the cut up method, I believe it was where you fold a piece of paper with writing on it into four, you separate them and then you rearrange them. That was like one way of doing the cutout method.
00:29:03.460 - 00:29:46.746, Speaker A: Burroughs did it, you know, on the ticket that exploded Nova Express and the soft machine that cut up trilogy. And nobody was saying, well, actually, probably some people were saying, this is like, you know, in apropos. But really, those are kind of classics now of the counterculture. And how different is that? I mean, you're taking previously made art or writing, and then you're kind of, you know, a news article, let's say. I think he was using oftentimes, and then redoing it and reconfiguring it. Right. So I also wondered to myself, like, how different is this from collage? Probably it got similar criticisms back in the day when you first started doing collage.
00:29:46.746 - 00:30:32.872, Speaker A: Maybe it was the Mers collages, let's say, at the, you know, early 20th century. So it kind of seems like a similar kind of criticism, or that's at work or dynamic. And where the final resting place for me of this whole issue is, is the results. That's where I kind of, the rubber hits meets the road for me. And if the results are great, that's kind of the most important thing for me. And as long as it's not too derivative, you know, if you're taking a bunch of haku sai prints and then making, like, kind of another hakusai print and saying, look, that's Adrian Pokebelly did this. And look at how brilliant Adrian Pokebelly is.
00:30:32.872 - 00:31:14.470, Speaker A: Well, that's lame. But if you're bringing it into your process and making it work, coming up with stuff we've never seen before, what's, you know, what's the harm in that, right? So the results. It's all about the results. Demon ego. In the first semester of the graphic design workshop class I taught at university this year, I gave my students a project in which they could use AI tools for the first time, which is, it's almost dereliction of duty, I would argue, for a modern day art professor to not do that. I always reminded them AI tools are now a part of art and design. They will become more important and widespread in the future.
00:31:14.470 - 00:31:23.230, Speaker A: Feel free to use it. That's okay. Don't be afraid of it. Don't leave everything to its decisions. And destroy yourself as a human. Exactly. Be a designer.
00:31:23.230 - 00:31:34.610, Speaker A: And bionette, it's like the artist as editor. Make it one of your materials and keep up with the times and make your design stronger. Yeah. So this is. That's it for the tweet. So. Exactly.
00:31:34.610 - 00:31:55.054, Speaker A: Nice and pragmatic and practical. From demon ego. Indeed. Frank Capa. Since I created prompts with midjourney and AI software, I particularly appreciate playing with its limits. Art does not tolerate any hindrance. At the beginning, an image that is deleted from me was the assurance that something interesting.
00:31:55.054 - 00:32:41.638, Speaker A: So I persisted in this way to, despite its principles, I think referring to mid journey. So all to say, playing with the limits and pushing the limits of technology, this is the nature. Like art means technology, technique in greek, you know, the art of something, the art of, you know, shoemaking, or whatever the case may be, the techne the technology, the way of doing things. So all to say, frank Kappa, interesting comment, and I think we have one more here. Joanna Kawahara Leno. People who have a weak grasp of art history think art is created in a vacuum. Great art was always inspired by previous styles, artists and concepts.
00:32:41.638 - 00:33:22.730, Speaker A: Great artists read and sought inspiration from a wide array of sources. In AI art, one of the main signals of artistic ability and expertise is consistency in style, which Petra 1 million% has. And I think Petra was the artist who we were looking at with the print, if I'm not mistaken. So. And finally, here's Santiago. What artist was this trained on? And probably, probably Santiago I'm imagining. So who knows? So a beautiful, stunningly gorgeous brushstrokes from Santiago's AI.
00:33:22.730 - 00:33:59.080, Speaker A: Remember, we saw it in the fake art magazine, which actually looked, I'd argue, better than it was like magazine of bad art or something. So, all to say, this is AI, I suspect. I mean, it's incredible, the brushwork here. Very provocative, this brushwork, because it's so beautiful. Provocatively beautiful. Sui soichi, in my reality, if you pay $100 for something made in 5 seconds with no practical function, you're just a scammed idiot. Not a legend, nor anything interesting to see how other people deal with it.
00:33:59.080 - 00:34:24.194, Speaker A: Yeah, you know, time, I would argue, is not the measure of how the time allocated to making a work. I mean, how long does a photograph. Sometimes you get lucky with a photograph and it turns into a masterpiece, and you took 2 seconds. That does happen. Can you do it consistently? Well, who knows? But I'm not sure. It's a real huge measure. It depends what went into that.
00:34:24.194 - 00:34:38.322, Speaker A: Like a Warhol, you could theoretically do pretty quickly. So I'm not sure about that, but it's an interesting comment. So. Which is why I share it. A provocative point. So thank you, Sui Soichi. Great to hear from you.
00:34:38.322 - 00:35:27.298, Speaker A: Element Li. It's dramatic. This is interesting, it's dramatical to see pixel art turning from a mainstream digital media from the nineties to minority one now. But to me, there's still so much potential to explore. Its history is too short for such a concise and robust methodology. Now, I'm not an expert in pixel art, but my sense is that when you had pixel art from the nineties, that it seems to me that it was less self consciously like there was pixel art, but it wasn't given the same degree of seriousness that we might see in, say, a work by element li, like this one right here. And so I totally agree with, actually, you know, the the.
00:35:27.298 - 00:35:50.400, Speaker A: We're just scratching the surface here in terms of pixel art. And I would actually say digital art itself as we saw it with the x mortal at the beginning, like, look at how many different things you can do, you know, like this. We saw how elaborate. I couldn't even finish reading the whole process there. That's how elaborate that process was. Look at element lead doing different things. You know, there's so much to explore.
00:35:50.400 - 00:36:23.254, Speaker A: But I wonder if we, from 2024, we now look at pixel art just slightly different than we did in the nineties. And I think it's interesting. It's just an interesting comment, because it is. I'm not sure it was a mainstream art movement, I guess is. So it kind of depends what element Li is saying here. I think we saw it a little differently, as my theory, but, you know, maybe element Li has another view. Maybe element Li will come on the spaces.
00:36:23.254 - 00:36:54.264, Speaker A: I'll have to think about that. So, continuing on, Xerox. Now, Xerox, of course, made a lot of waves with the Keith Haring. Remember that? From over a year ago when we had Sabato and Xerox on a special spaces to discuss the Keith Haring release? The NFts. The Keith haring NFts. So there has been another institute or estate that is now using Chris Burden. Let's look at the tweet GM.
00:36:54.264 - 00:37:24.590, Speaker A: Show me a high profile artist, and I'll show you vultures flying lazy circles. Last year, Chris Burton's estate minted unrealized works, quote unquote by Chris, even though the man died eight years earlier in 2015, and claimed it was fulfilling his vision. Okay, sure. But now LACMA has acquired one of these works through a donation, and the attribution reads estate of Chris Burden. And we've seen this with 2010 Magrittes as well. Some misleading stuff. The estate didn't make the piece.
00:37:24.590 - 00:37:49.758, Speaker A: A bunch of artists at TR labs did. But magically, their names are now off. Could have marked it after or in the manner of. But that wouldn't be sufficiently deceptive, I guess. And you probably couldn't charge as much either. I think it's a fair point. I think this whole kind of vulture, we see this over and over, frankly, with the estates of artists trying to make new work, you know, the financial incentive probably being quite massive.
00:37:49.758 - 00:38:38.100, Speaker A: Mumble boy, I should add that there are many artists I would love to add to my curations, but they are not on object.com or haven't, or haven't uploaded new work there in a long time. So until there's a way to make curations that can include all different marketplaces. It's not quite 100. This is actually a very powerful point because now most people are multi chain. And even, you know, and even if you're not multi chain, as an artist, you may as a curator, want to take an artist from this chain, an artist from that chain, maybe something completely different, and add it to your curation. I was thinking, you know, who actually does incorporate different blockchains into one system? And I was thinking, I think it's RC xyz who I think are the right click, save people, because they'll have your super rare or your Ethereum works Foundation works.
00:38:38.100 - 00:39:13.142, Speaker A: They'll have your object, your tezos works, right? I think they might have. I don't think they have Solana. Right. But maybe there's an opportunity there for someone like RC XYZ to create also a curation function. Not sure, but I thought just. I agree with mumble boy, like, where would you go? Maybe, you know, maybe who should do it are the gallery whose name I escaped, who does those virtual spaces and galleries. If you, you know, with the figure, the metaverse kind of galleries, I forget the name off the top of my head.
00:39:13.142 - 00:39:26.398, Speaker A: Let's continue here. So we saw this work in progress from Martin Bruce. Sabato won it. It turned into a one of one. Sabato got it for 75. Tazos wanted it, put three bids on it. Awesome, awesome work here.
00:39:26.398 - 00:40:32.624, Speaker A: As you can see, a profoundly original painting here by Martin Bruce. And if you haven't heard the spaces that we did, and you see the physical here, too, always unpredictable throughout the whole work here, keeping the eye guessing and even, what are these things? And, you know, the summary on the space, if you haven't listened to it or I, is basically, Martin Bruce uses a lot of intuition. So, you know, everybody was throwing reasons at, like, are you doing this? Are you doing that? For the first 45 minutes of the show until I realized, you know, Martin Bruce is working mostly by intuition, visual intuition, thinking visually. And so that is how Martin Bruce is able to make these really astonishing, incredibly unusual, beautiful and original works. So great pickup there by Sabato. It continues for $63.75. Great pickup.
00:40:32.624 - 00:40:55.350, Speaker A: One of one here is Yuri J. A new one awesomely on Tezos. Inside a dark and moody dream house designed by award winning architects. A rad title here. Another interior from Yuri Jenna. As we see this awesome wallpaper, kind of the color scheme which we're kind of familiar with. And look at this chair.
00:40:55.350 - 00:41:31.750, Speaker A: I mean, just so incredibly rich. The artists continue to evolve in their styles here. Even this chair with, like, the stitching that seems to go across the leg, upsetting the perspective. Just fabulous. And even what looks like kind of a printy texture underneath that Benday dot stretch texture. And a couple of socks on there. Even a little drop shadow dragging a little bit of noise here on top, as well as here, almost repeating the chair here with maybe a multiply or 10% opacity.
00:41:31.750 - 00:41:50.748, Speaker A: Wonderful, wonderful work by Uri J. I mean, just amazing. Here's something I believe posted on twitter, if I'm not mistaken here. And let's. Flowers watching a tv. Just an awesome subject matter here, too. So here we go again.
00:41:50.748 - 00:42:13.320, Speaker A: Another incredible work by another incredible artist in this scene. And you gotta love this detail of the window. Another interior, interestingly, but kind of a surreal interior. Again, flowers watching tv. And these completely original flowers here. So very cool work. Almost looks like this pattern here is bleeding over into the wallpaper a little bit too.
00:42:13.320 - 00:42:28.910, Speaker A: Very interesting work. As well as the vines of the flowers and these little RCA. RCA wires. Brilliant. And the clock, which is trademark flowers watching a tv. Just awesome. Here's Zuozo, who continues to dazzle.
00:42:28.910 - 00:42:48.886, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get this going. Just a rad artist. Let's see what this is called. Plant house. So there's one. Here's something called life. June 4.
00:42:48.886 - 00:43:36.816, Speaker A: Very prolific, by the way. Just so original, moving. I mean, you know, again, the museum, in my mind, is very thrilled with what it has in store for all visitors here. This is fabulous life. Here's another one. I'm using x to show this because it's a little smaller file, which helps my browser out a little bit. I mean, just soothing.
00:43:36.816 - 00:43:58.584, Speaker A: And the rain, I think that's rain or lightning. So moving. That beautiful rain. Like, just rad, rad from the shores of a dream. What a beautiful title by Zozo. Just amazing. And one more.
00:43:58.584 - 00:44:33.890, Speaker A: I mean, look at how much work Zozo is putting out. This incredibly original work. Again, you do get the sense, like Martin Bruce kind of visual thinking. Let's see if there is volume on this Zora work. This rabbit. I mean, just magical. And the rain, I love the vibe.
00:44:33.890 - 00:44:50.650, Speaker A: Like, poetic, but happy, you know, really powerful. Where to find shelter. Kind of a nice nature work. We have a ton of work from NUV 1914. Massively prolific. Sabato on a tear here. Picking up another one.
00:44:50.650 - 00:45:11.360, Speaker A: So now 14, I think there are actually 15 tezos now. NUV 1914 works. So Sabato in a collecting mood. And look at the works. He's getting, you know, another fantastic one of one here, NUV 1914. Doing another, I guess we'd call it, like narrative work. And what is the title of this? Melodea.
00:45:11.360 - 00:45:40.894, Speaker A: So, again, using, I believe, Spanish here and these beautiful flowers and everything. Even some musical notes now, 75 tezos on secondary. Gorgeous work in the frame and everything. Line extension. Who's been really aggressively purchasing all these? Nov 1914 works, a lot of them. 14 tezos, giro. So a couple of people dancing in what looks like a diner.
00:45:40.894 - 00:45:58.274, Speaker A: And there's a jukebox. So another music work. Very fun theme. And here, looking like it's in a bar. Not sure what Baracha or bareca means. Trippie collector managing to pick this one up for 15 tezos. So, NUv 1914, totally on a tear, on a roll.
00:45:58.274 - 00:46:14.270, Speaker A: Putting out just beautiful works. Here's another one. Cafe using the bears. Two bears at a cafe. Just beautiful. Gotta love the wall in the background, the color and even just the perspective on boat. I think Sabato picked this one up, too.
00:46:14.270 - 00:46:36.140, Speaker A: 15 tezos and unlisted on boat on both day. So just beautiful, beautiful work here from NUV 1914, as usual. So just the excitement. There's so many exciting artists that we've seen here. Martin, Bruce, Yuri J. Zuozo. Nuv.
00:46:36.140 - 00:46:49.626, Speaker A: 1914. I mean, pretty amazing work that's coming out here. Kind of an ice cream. This looks like a kiss. I think that's what it's called. Momento bezo. A kiss moment.
00:46:49.626 - 00:47:02.106, Speaker A: Or something like that. Again, playing with that kind of circular gradient in the background. And the ice cream. Just beautiful. 15 tezos. Trippie collector picked that one up. And this was, I believe, just posted on Twitter.
00:47:02.106 - 00:47:16.546, Speaker A: Another work here by solo on La Playa, which I think is the beach. So more beautiful work here. Beautiful palm trees from nub 1914. And tennis. So look at all this work. Line extension. Getting this one.
00:47:16.546 - 00:47:26.146, Speaker A: Just another beautiful colors. Sports work. Just beautiful. And here's Ed Marolla. Found demon. Look at this. Very painterly.
00:47:26.146 - 00:47:55.620, Speaker A: I wish I could zoom in more, but this is the full size of the file. Again, looking like a combination of aseprite and procreate. And as you see here, just rad. And this kind of demon figure here, super original framing here with this margin. Found demon edition of 22 and sold out at five tazos. So that is pretty good. You know, works are selling out here.
00:47:55.620 - 00:48:19.676, Speaker A: The market continues. Let's keep this secret. So, just to work. Posted, I believe, on X. I'm not sure if it's been posted otherwise, but you can see the beautiful textures here. Almost this kind of impressionistic flowers in the foreground with all of these figures here. And whoever this is through the necklace there.
00:48:19.676 - 00:48:35.504, Speaker A: Let's keep this a secret. So enigmatic title and work. Here's walk. Not sure if this is old or new. Just post this on x. But look at that work. So very, just super cool, I guess.
00:48:35.504 - 00:48:50.832, Speaker A: I don't know. I think we'd call that spray paint over airbrush. Martin Bruce. Interestingly, if you didn't hear the space. Very excited to try out airbrush work, which is super interesting. Will be fascinating to see this work by cider. I assume this is by cider.
00:48:50.832 - 00:49:10.570, Speaker A: Connect the dots. Pretty cool work here. I mean, you think vaguely Warhol, but this is nothing like a Warhol. And, you know, only because Warhol, I think, did the paint by number, has probably done the connect the dots. This is awesome. But total cider. And I just love the composition too.
00:49:10.570 - 00:49:31.840, Speaker A: The nice negative space, the color, the texture. Beautiful work from cider. Here's another one. Enigmatic. Today's new flex bitcoin, max cash. So not exactly sure what is being referred to here. Maybe 21 million with this 21 here, and maybe some money that is orange.
00:49:31.840 - 00:49:57.842, Speaker A: So just a highly textured, enigmatic work here by cider. So another work, same artist. And here we have Lucena Guerra, who I do follow. That is a glitch on x when you load up several tabs. I have a wonderful new artwork I want to share, inspired by Bosch's school, but recreated with my own catalog of signs and color palette. Organized chaos. Buy now for 8000 rare or kick off the auction for 35 eth.
00:49:57.842 - 00:50:30.822, Speaker A: So if you're on super rare, it can be worth your while to put works in selling for rare for the rare token, which is super rare's token. Maybe a nice opportunity to pick some up because it's pretty low right now. So just interesting. So cool, kind of Bosche inspired artwork here, but with a real Lucian Aguera vibe to it and feel. And of course, we had Luciana Guerra on the spaces just a couple of months ago. Here is Pipi Universal. I love this subject matter.
00:50:30.822 - 00:50:59.132, Speaker A: You know, the process is going to take forever. As soon as you see these chairs, which look like chairs in an airport, doesn't it? You know, the process or like in a waiting room. Powerful, actually, iconography. Wonderful choice of iconography here from PP Universal. And beautifully executed on top of that in Phi Phi's, you know, textured style here. Also contrasting this kind of background too. I mean, not to be missed.
00:50:59.132 - 00:51:21.478, Speaker A: You see this kind of light gradient, these light lines, you know, creating the space as well as the shadow even. And then these textured chairs. Love the subject matter here. That is 650. Couple gone already, edition of five. And here is Cristiano Ronaldo's last dancing shoes. This very colorful kind of.
00:51:21.478 - 00:51:46.268, Speaker A: It looks like half cleat, half dancing shoe. Really cool work here by PP universal, excuse me, of this, Cristiano Ronaldo's last dancing shoe. Again, combining the textured areas with flat color. Nice contrast. Nice margin here, too. Very interesting. Very cool.
00:51:46.268 - 00:52:07.196, Speaker A: So that is 1238. That looks like it's sold out at seven tezos each. I like picking up a couple yuri J. Louis and Shigarov Shirigav rinifish with a new one on Tazos. Forgotten dream. This is an edition of one for 50 tezos and one bid so far. So this is an.
00:52:07.196 - 00:52:24.580, Speaker A: So you can get a rhiny fish for 50 tezos if. Well, you can put a bid in. So that is going for auction right now. So very cool work here. Again, kind of has this placenta feel. Kind of looks like maybe underwater sea creatures. Kind of like a fish here, but almost like a poodle here.
00:52:24.580 - 00:52:38.440, Speaker A: Not sure. And these kind of wormy things. Interesting and beautiful work from Renny. Fish as ever. Forgotten dream. Great title. I forgot my dream, but it doesn't make it any less special.
00:52:38.440 - 00:53:06.430, Speaker A: Beautiful. Here's mumble boy listening station. This is an edition of one and it sold twelve tezos. So again, the market continues here through thick and thin. People are talking about the NFT market, how quiet it is and everything. Like things are still chugging along here. People are still buying and selling work, you know, and who knows how many, you know, I was thinking to myself, like, I was having issues with Kukai wallet.
00:53:06.430 - 00:53:28.302, Speaker A: Like maybe other people are too, for all we know. It might not just be me. And that can slow things down. If all of a sudden half the people, you know, I found the images are slower to load and I don't know if it's just me on object. I don't know if they changed how they're loading. I don't know if it's just me, my Internet connections, but that stuff can all affect sales. So we're still doing well here.
00:53:28.302 - 00:53:51.654, Speaker A: So this beautiful work here by mumble boy, it's kind of like gradient background colors here, almost like pastels. And then here we have this wonderful collage that looks both physical and digital elements combined. A beautiful work. Listening station. Great title. Selling for twelve tezos to guru, guru hyena Rashi. This is still available.
00:53:51.654 - 00:54:15.206, Speaker A: Another beautiful one of one. So mumble boy, going back to the one of ones, which I think is a great idea. And here you see again, up close and personal with Mumble boy's style. So just a couple of highlights here from Mumble Boy. This was minted 13 hours ago, so still available. Here's Cwampa. This is on super rare now.
00:54:15.206 - 00:54:54.224, Speaker A: This came out maybe a month or two ago. What is it, April 8. So a couple of months ago, but I never saw it because again, I need to start following people more on foundation where you can track if they post on super rare. I was doing that, but I need to just get everything sorted out there so I can see new works by Cwampa, for example, on super rare. So just an interesting piece. And of course, Cuompa does those Microsoft paintworks, it looks like using modern Microsoft paint, a newer style, if I'm not mistaken, something that Quampa developed in the last, like, you know, year, I want to say year and few months and has really done well with it. Beautiful.
00:54:54.224 - 00:55:11.920, Speaker A: I think go to Indonesia. I want to say. Let's just check here. It doesn't say multidisciplinary artist and just a rad, rad artist. And Cuampa also posted this. You see it looks like modern Microsoft paint program also. And let's see what the comment was.
00:55:11.920 - 00:56:01.406, Speaker A: Color study in Microsoft paint 2024. And just interesting work. So kind of a different vibe and style. Of course, it's just a color study, but interesting kind of evolution here from Cuompa, but continuing with this kind of grand landscape, sort of panoramas, so to speak, kind of epic feel compositions or ratios. Here's rustic digital art with a couple of interesting works using the Mario figure, but just completely blown apart here. Tempted to use the word deconstructed, but probably not the right usage here. And so this looks like a maximum view, but almost like taking that Mario, I think we.
00:56:01.406 - 00:56:20.556, Speaker A: I have another work by. This is also looking like using the Mario, but using a guernica by Picasso. Right? Of course. Right. But using these Mario type colors. Quite a brilliant work here. Quite a brilliant work.
00:56:20.556 - 00:56:48.664, Speaker A: I mean, making it look easy. Bitnika. So you see that work. And again, I think this is taking the Mario brothers cropped Mario brother figure and making other works out of it. Wild digital art here in the, like, in the terrains here in the digital art terrains here. Kind of like we see in the backyard of my parents acreage here, just outside Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Just amazing.
00:56:48.664 - 00:57:19.530, Speaker A: RJ also on the scene. I mean, it's really like a greatest hits compilation here. It's quite amazing, all the art, the developed artists here, isn't it? I mean, you really see it when you take like a week off. You see how like, stunning. Okay, here's RJ back on scene, doing what looks like a David Hockney pastiche. Putting a bit of a gift play on it. This kind of noise snow, you know, tv snow GIF feel to it.
00:57:19.530 - 00:57:32.560, Speaker A: So adding some animation here. This is just posted on x. Summertime vibes indeed, from Ahec boo Boyd. Let's take a look at this. And this is on foundation. We'll see if it loads up here. It should.
00:57:32.560 - 00:57:50.340, Speaker A: An interesting combination of iconography. I mean, a grenade. We have these figures here with the happy faces. Almost like ancient Rome. Like the laurels there. Big I that almost looks like a UFO. X's that almost looks like Band Aids, people diving.
00:57:50.340 - 00:58:05.206, Speaker A: A lot of chaos here. But there is order in the chaos. Beautiful colors too. A party list 2024 by Boo boy. So just really cool work. And this is sold. I wonder what it's sold for.
00:58:05.206 - 00:58:22.366, Speaker A: Can we see activity or just transferred over to Gigachad Pepe. So we don't know. So maybe someone who made a fortune in Pepe. Let's continue here. So here is Katarina create. Good morning, dear friends. Have a nice summer day.
00:58:22.366 - 00:58:40.894, Speaker A: This is my new page from the issue of the coolest Sloth magazine. Really nice illustration for Sloth magazine. Of course, a kind of a zine on tazos. Summertime. Catarina create. And so doing a page here in black and white. Quite powerful and beautiful and kind of just capturing the summer vibes.
00:58:40.894 - 00:58:57.858, Speaker A: Summertime. Very nice piece from Katarina create. And here's another illustration. Digitally drawn animation from Jake Studios. Surreal animation here with this torch of sorts. And the face. The head has been replaced with the fire.
00:58:57.858 - 00:59:26.980, Speaker A: And the fire has been replaced with the head. And here is almost a Mario mushroom. So again, kind of like association and almost like the crown of, you know, reminiscent of the crown of thorns here, this barbed wire and a few shipping containers. And some upside down, hand drawn, pixelated clouds. Go figure. Just amazing in this beautiful textured sky. Here, 100 tezos edition of one listed by Jake Studios one day ago.
00:59:26.980 - 00:59:43.252, Speaker A: And here, I think. I'm not sure if this is ok. DX. DK Oxdk. This is someone called Yaffig, I think, after painting. Enjoy, we'll just go with Yaffeg right now. Interesting illustration.
00:59:43.252 - 01:00:08.046, Speaker A: I thought so. A Gif illustration of the artist at work here. Interesting works on the wall and on the canvas here at work. The oven keeping everyone warm as well as the coffee at night. Just a nice piece here after painting. Edition of 22 for fortezos 90, minted on May 30 and still available, but not many left. Dylan chem.
01:00:08.046 - 01:00:26.730, Speaker A: So this is pretty cool. We saw some abstracts by Dylan a while ago and I thought this is a pretty cool work. Two hands which turn into birds and you see the negative space where they overlap. Inverted chem. So interesting. Just all round. I believe this is all digital.
01:00:26.730 - 01:00:50.850, Speaker A: And you can even see like the different kinds of feeling. It looks like maybe some exports, you know, this is maybe, you know, one program. And then putting the eyes. You see the strong contrast on the eye there. Kind of feeling like another layer edition of one for only ten dazos. So nice piece from Dylan. And here's just a rad artwork here by Sabato.
01:00:50.850 - 01:01:19.864, Speaker A: This was put on the art of the millennium. So a prominent gallery here in the, you know, for lack of better term, in the main kind of crypto scene. What I want to call the main sort of crypto. What I like to loosely call and respectfully call the mainstream kind of crypto scene. Art of the millennium. How to be an anon by Sabato. So Sabato minting, I believe this is on ethereum.
01:01:19.864 - 01:01:41.336, Speaker A: Uses frames from heto styles work. I believe that's how you pronounce it. Heto style, who was a really big deal if you've never heard of hedostyle. When I got to Berlin in 2016, that was probably her peak. I want to say in terms of popularity, I could be wrong. She may be just as popular now as she ever was. I saw a speech by Guido style.
01:01:41.336 - 01:02:07.434, Speaker A: Who is the person actually in this work. It was a little vague. It was kind of one of those, what I'd say, not very coherent speeches. So I've never been a big Heto style fan. It's never been, you know, but maybe I don't understand it. Who knows? But anyways. So Sabato riffing off of Heto styles work and.
01:02:07.434 - 01:02:43.090, Speaker A: What was it called? I can't remember what the name of Heto styles, but it plays with surveillance, one of her themes. And so Sabato has how to be an anon, right? A f ing didactic or saterial meme gif file. So playing off of a name of a work by Guido style, which uses a similar title. So maybe it's not didactic enough for me. Hilariously, I would say, because that's usually the criticism too. Didactic, as my friend says, his classic art gallery criticism, too didactic. Hilarious.
01:02:43.090 - 01:03:20.972, Speaker A: Anyways, so a really beautiful piece here. So rising to the occasion, Sabato, with this gorgeous gif playing, you know, in dialogue with a contemporary art world. Fabulous. And look at the, even just the beautiful textures, the painterliness of this work, as well as keeping some things even, like out of focus here, some pixels, static, using the gif quite powerfully, almost at different rhythms. Beautiful colors. As usual. Sabato has a very good eye for color, I would argue and everything.
01:03:20.972 - 01:03:39.748, Speaker A: And conceptually. So this one has it all. Very cool work. This could show at some biennale and it would be rad, actually. Maybe it will one day. So just rad artwork by Sabato, as usual. But that one really is standout work.
01:03:39.748 - 01:03:55.906, Speaker A: Miracat murakit nft so press play. So more just gorgeous gifts here. I think we're. I think I kind of suspect Sabato might also be doing effects on effects. A little bit here and there. I could be wrong. I think Miracat is doing that here.
01:03:55.906 - 01:04:27.086, Speaker A: That's how you get. How I suspect you get these like really rad outcomes here. It's a technique I love to use as well. It's very powerful. So here, just more beautifully textured works here. Kind of has an anime manga feel, pixel art, and just a little glitchy gif, you know, glitchy pixelation, you know. Here's another one by Miraket Bonas Diaz has a bit of a video game kind of landscape feel to it right here.
01:04:27.086 - 01:04:44.614, Speaker A: These are like classic. Let me get the cursor here. These are classic sort of outcomes of effects on effects, I would argue. Same with here. You'll see it in my beached work on Solana on exchange art. But who knows? I don't know. Anyways, really cool artist.
01:04:44.614 - 01:05:03.210, Speaker A: Love Meerkat's work. Annas Abdin another really rad pixel artist putting out a work a day. It's hard to keep up, actually. But here is a beautiful gif. Of course, nature being Ennis Abdin's main theme, we had a wonderful space. I'm gonna post all the spaces soon enough. It is.
01:05:03.210 - 01:05:39.430, Speaker A: I gotta figure out. Yeah, there's things to figure out there. But I want to do a massive update of the spaces since October. Huge amount of spaces archive that I have to get online. Stippin pixel this is another just fantastic pixel artwork. The color, you might say, the discipline in only using like three or four colors here. The gorgeous composition, I mean, tempting to call it, like the sketchbook style where you're just kind of doing things, not worrying about there being a unified space.
01:05:39.430 - 01:05:53.306, Speaker A: Right. It's almost like different kind of outcomes, but not divided by any borders. Again, what I call the sketchbook compositional style. This is gorgeous. And again, playing with this. Four to the floor. We'll see.
01:05:53.306 - 01:06:16.124, Speaker A: I think this is maximum. Even the police here. Look at this stuff on the bottom. Just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. I was tempted to start, like. I mean, there are so many great candidates here, and I'm not even showing everything. That's, you know, on my little list of bookmarks because my computer started to crash at, like, you know, whatever tabs we have here.
01:06:16.124 - 01:06:30.132, Speaker A: How much is this? Ten tezos edition of ten. Only two sold. The legendary Haiti rocket, picking up one. Mime. Paris picking up another. So beautiful. Go go lightus with a really interesting piece here.
01:06:30.132 - 01:06:54.750, Speaker A: Kind of like a temple with a pixel art heart in the middle and some cycling gradients. So golight is continuing to do some massive experimentation and development and evolution. Infinity roll. So here's Mannitol and P one. Back at it with another. Just beautiful work. Just awesome.
01:06:54.750 - 01:07:14.234, Speaker A: Kind of like the. The music. The eight bit music matching the. Kind of the low fi music. Low resolution music, you might say. Matching the low resolution pixel art. Look at this great pattern in the background, too.
01:07:14.234 - 01:07:24.474, Speaker A: Nice touch. And manital. I think it's manital who does. Yeah, p one does the art. Does the. The music. Chiptune, BGM, and hand pixelated and animated work by Mandal.
01:07:24.474 - 01:07:36.562, Speaker A: Mandel's got a real. Like, Sabato has a real sense of color. I'm not sure if you can teach that. I don't know. Like, it's a good question. It's an interesting question. Just opinions over here.
01:07:36.562 - 01:08:01.264, Speaker A: Just provocative thoughts from Pokebelly. Silva Santus ritual. Keeping it interesting here on the Nintendo glitch roms. These, you know, hexadecimals just kind of hanging in the air in this kind of secret society type ritual at night. Kind of cropped off. You barely see it. Very, very interesting work here.
01:08:01.264 - 01:08:19.960, Speaker A: Warlock. So that is the name of the video game is Warlock. 101 frames, edition of three. So this is an open edition available for another 25 days from silva san twos. Very, very cool work here. Is Lorna Mills. Pseudo herbaceous, maybe referring to the color, actually.
01:08:19.960 - 01:08:42.780, Speaker A: That's a. Of course, as I always mention here, Lorna Mills. The great Lorna Mills always takes her titles from racehorse names, if you're wondering where it comes from. But I think looks at herbaceous. Okay, we got the greens that'll work well and just rad. I even love how. How overdevelop at the bottom, how you even have like this cropped off smoke.
01:08:42.780 - 01:09:04.240, Speaker A: I love that, you know, again, it makes it feel arty and poetic and these great, you know, hand drawn squares here, animated with this beautiful green. This is a beautiful work. Edition of 30 for 20 tezos, each selling a ton of them. Look at that. Market is healthy. The market is healthy. I dare say works are selling.
01:09:04.240 - 01:09:21.972, Speaker A: Here's Elna Frederick. Edition of ten. And look at this, accepting offers of 13. I mean, it hasn't slowed down. Maybe it's slowed down a touch, but I mean, you do. If you make art that people want, they will buy it. It's not like there are no buyers here.
01:09:21.972 - 01:09:37.670, Speaker A: Really nice playing off this meme. Everything is fine. Right here is Renato Marini. Cool work here. Error, dead art. Cancel, cancel. So just all sorts of originality here.
01:09:37.670 - 01:10:06.024, Speaker A: And look at Renki keeping things new as we are at the hour and ten minute mark. So we gotta speed up a bit here before the day flies away on me here. Look how beautiful this is. An original keeping, like, again, the ongoing development of so many of these artists. It's really cool, right? So here's Renki. One of one, not unlisted as usual, as usually is done. Yoshi Noguchi.
01:10:06.024 - 01:10:30.300, Speaker A: Here's another original work by Renki. So just keeping it interesting over here. Edition of one unlisted here is psycho futurist. And we'll look at the title in a second here. It almost needs no title, this one, but let's look at the title. Interesting juxtaposition of iconography. You don't belong to a place until you bury someone there.
01:10:30.300 - 01:10:50.780, Speaker A: Profound thought here. There's an addition of eight, sorry, of ten for 825. And I wonder, is this sold or on secondary now for 825. So selling out. So really cool work here from psycho futurist. And here's another one. Garden of Eden with no tagging powder.
01:10:50.780 - 01:11:13.078, Speaker A: And I'm using the x one, which is a little bit lower phi, but easier to load up here, here. So another interesting work from psycho futurist. Which reminds me, there's a Marcelo Pinello that needs to be shown. I don't think it's in this episode. Continuing on, here's Rannick's deer. There are a few waffles. There's going to be.
01:11:13.078 - 01:11:47.152, Speaker A: We're still catching up here. Ranix grand rising. These minimal gradients are pretty rad, aren't they? They're pretty head turny, actually. To do something so minimal and make them so interesting is pretty cool. Like, again, it's like, this is going somewhere are the words that go through my head. And this is on Zora, if you want to collect these one on Zora. I'm not sure where this one is, but the second one is on Zora called Rise Link to mint.
01:11:47.152 - 01:12:01.360, Speaker A: So that's Ranix. Here's Datura formation. So another classic artist here on Tezos, edition of 20. And look at this. Selling for ten tezos, four gone. So. Right, like, as the.
01:12:01.360 - 01:12:30.646, Speaker A: You know, again, you have to ask your contemporary art friends who are making works, like, how much are they selling? Like, it's still pretty rad out here on Tazos, on the blockchain. Pretty rad. Speaking of Rad, here's a pretty rad work formation. Cool title. Like, if you make work that people want to buy, they will buy it. It doesn't just sit there. So sometimes that does happen, but sometimes there is a market out there.
01:12:30.646 - 01:12:56.534, Speaker A: It could be a marketing thing. If they want to buy it and they're not buying it. Here's a new work, I think by Curo on base. So just rad experimentation here. Rich, rich, you know, again, feels like processes on or exper. Effects on effects. Like, I mean, that's what we could argue we saw with exchange art at the start with Xmortal.
01:12:56.534 - 01:13:28.170, Speaker A: I mean, when he's talking about that process, that's effects on effects, isn't it? Very powerful. And we have, like, just like. Again, let me see if I can get this working here. Awesome collaboration between Kiro and Francoise Gammer. And I only brought up one, but look at how many there are. Just let me show you this just to give you a taste. It's a rad collaboration because, of course, there's the walking figures made to order.
01:13:28.170 - 01:13:51.130, Speaker A: This is beautiful. True collaboration here. It's exciting, actually, because only because we've seen so many of these walking figures. And then you put Kiro on top. A really cool collaboration. They must be happy. And I don't, and I can imagine they are, but look at how many works they put out.
01:13:51.130 - 01:14:14.680, Speaker A: And I think, is this the first one? Maybe we looked at this. I think we looked at this one. Yeah. So just rad. Rad work here from Kiro and fossils Gamma and Klaus at composition 215, 215. So keeping it going here, Klaus, with these compositions. So very cool.
01:14:14.680 - 01:14:31.840, Speaker A: One of one on object for 21 tazos. This epic series now and continuing. I think this is retro. Manny the tar. The terra tourists. The Terra Tourists trophy oh, three. So I think this is a spaceship as trophy.
01:14:31.840 - 01:15:04.042, Speaker A: Almost like an Academy award. Look how elaborate this is. So a very cool GLB. And I think you can get it with the retro Manny token. This is worth 25, maybe Retro Manny's, I'm guessing we'll ask on the space in a few weeks here. Very, very cool work here from retro Manny. And none available, and maybe transferred to previous collectors, I assume, or maybe buyers, I'm not sure.
01:15:04.042 - 01:15:34.080, Speaker A: Simulacru circulation of coincidence from the synchrony collection. Nine of twelve, seven tezos each. So again, let's just get. It's a real bonafide art scene we have here. I mean, a digital biennale. Just awesome and dramatic. Great video.
01:15:34.080 - 01:16:02.102, Speaker A: Great, great, great video. Exciting, fun, just rad. There's a lot to be excited about. Here is our good friend Mikael Knowlson with a pretty, like, you know, it's like 3d abstract art almost, right? But on a 2d surface. Just looking for my cursor here. Let me see if I can get this going. So this is Mikael Knowlson.
01:16:02.102 - 01:16:45.496, Speaker A: I'm trying to. Is that okay? I just got a bit of a reflection on my screen. There we go. So, Mikael Knowlson, who many of you know, who encouraged this program. So one of the two people that helped make this show happen early, early on, and also, also true face, I think we may have looked at one of these or one that's similar. Gorgeous AI artwork. So with all the criticism of AI art, I mean, I'm not sure people are how deep they're digging on AI art, because, I mean, you know, and just to add to the point, Pablo Radici, true face, makes their own algorithms, is like a programmer, as far as I understand, of like, AI algorithms.
01:16:45.496 - 01:17:10.932, Speaker A: This is on Zora. So, I mean, I think we can call that, you know, original, so. Or we might, you know, original enough, you know, McKenna always quoting Wittgenstein, that which is true enough. It's like we can call that original enough, right? So maybe that's the real answer to, it's just original enough. These AI. Here's another AI artwork. This is Santiago, original enough, GM.
01:17:10.932 - 01:17:34.036, Speaker A: Beautiful. Look at these. I mean, Santiago is getting next level with these brush strokes here, and who knows how they're being done. I mean, maybe it's just combination. Sometimes it's that, you know, quote unquote easy of other works using blend. But maybe there's probably more to it than that, and it doesn't even matter right at the end of the day. Can you do that? I don't know how to do that.
01:17:34.036 - 01:17:49.328, Speaker A: I would love to know how to make these brushstrokes. So all to say, very interesting, Santiago with other original works. Memory of everyone. I think it's the name of this title. Rad title. Just very powerful. Look at this.
01:17:49.328 - 01:18:06.512, Speaker A: So AI to the max. So who. What's not to like here? What's not to like? Memory of everyone. Awesome title. Now, 33 tazos sold out at five tazos each. Oxygen picking one up as well. So selling out markets.
01:18:06.512 - 01:18:36.144, Speaker A: Doing fabulously, isn't it? So here is tuques coming next week. Escapes, presented by Chill Tulpa and verseworks. So we have a few works here by Tuks, who we did a wonderful. A very philosophical artist. Comes out of glitch, you know, made it to AI through glitch. And there's a. You know, it's kind of like AI artists, I think Sabato was saying at one point that AI artists kind of.
01:18:36.144 - 01:19:26.442, Speaker A: And glitch, they kind of have a shared kind of concerns, you might say, or shared what, you know, it's just experimenting with technology, pushing it to see where it can go, you know, so it's really what you do with AI also, right? Like, what are you doing? Are you simply trying to make, again a haku sai and then call it your own, a new hakusai and call it your own? Or are you trying to push the technology, make it glitch it out a bit? So to be purely, you know, AI is good, AI is bad. It's really oversimplifying the argument. It's an old argument, though. When I saw there's this big debate, I thought, well, we've kind of been here, done that, haven't we? But all to say a little review. Lonely boys. So this is by tooks. Also in this escape series, these magical.
01:19:26.442 - 01:19:52.526, Speaker A: Again, we're getting novel images here from Tuks. I mean, this would never be made without AI. Tuks has made some stunning, as many of, you know, a high artworks. And here's another brilliant AI artist. Strange thing, he was called Mercedes GM. So interesting piece with the kind of mechanical horse skeleton, almost like a car that is being built here. Really interesting work here.
01:19:52.526 - 01:20:20.260, Speaker A: Kind of has a bit of an 18th century pastoral landscape here from strange thing. And Martin Jo with a cool skeleton here. Also a eye and some with hair almost like a teddy bear. Blue teddy bear. Edgy work as usual from Martin Jo in that brilliant work we saw in the community. That brilliant drawing. Again, kind of tipping the hat a little bit to Hans Belmer.
01:20:20.260 - 01:20:37.748, Speaker A: I think, as we've discussed in previous episodes. Now, this is interesting because I couldn't figure out if it's AI or physical. Now. It is physical, actually, but I'm not. To me, this looks like an AI artwork, doesn't it? Like an AI type thing. Put this together. But I don't know.
01:20:37.748 - 01:20:56.320, Speaker A: Interestingly here, clearly it is physical. And this is actually tape, I believe. Look at that. You see that? This is tape. It looks like brush strokes. Is this all tape? I mean, that would be insane. Really interesting piece here.
01:20:56.320 - 01:21:13.520, Speaker A: All around from process. And look, maybe it's just colored pieces of paper. You see the scissors? Wow. Right? I mean, I don't know what's going on here. Lola dupre. Pretty cool. Here is quilanina as we go into the physicals here.
01:21:13.520 - 01:21:38.620, Speaker A: Serenity. So I believe this is physical. Usually doing acrylic and oil in these kind of mystical paintings here. And so just beautiful artwork. Again, out of, I believe, Peru. And is it Chile or Peru? Is it Bolivia? Let's quickly look. And under the series magic, Argentina and Peru.
01:21:38.620 - 01:21:52.900, Speaker A: So very cool here. And again, I'm going to Brazil. For those that are still watching, I'm going to Brazil on Sunday. So again, it's going to be a little sporadic. It's ten days. I hope to put together a show. Maybe I'll do short shows just to.
01:21:52.900 - 01:22:11.750, Speaker A: I don't like leaving the show for so long. We've built up too much. We built up too much credibility, in a sense, by being here, and I don't want to lose that. Brian Brinkman. So this is die with the most likes. Some physicals that are showing up in the mail here. These beautiful watercolors, beautifully executed.
01:22:11.750 - 01:22:34.316, Speaker A: I need to reach out to die with the most likes and see if he'll come on the spaces. Beautiful work here. We have another one here, original watercolor by Dye with most likes. Just arrived in the mail. I asked my wife whether we should display it, and she said, not in my house. And so just awesome. And I think he signs it die with the most likes of.
01:22:34.316 - 01:22:54.504, Speaker A: So just really cool becoming a really good painter, you know. Very nice physicals. Again, building credit. The evolution of so many artists in this scene. It's back to this undeniable is undenied line by David Hickey, referring to Rauschenberg. This is brilliant. This is walk.
01:22:54.504 - 01:23:22.880, Speaker A: I think this is an original drawing by walk PD, you know, playing with the Spider man meme. I think this is like a colored pencil by walk. So another just awesome artist who continues to evolve here is gloomtube doodle. And bags and of course I follow gloomtube. That is a x glitch and here you see just different bags here being drawn out in a notebook by Gloomtube. It continues here. And here's another one by walk legacy.
01:23:22.880 - 01:23:51.332, Speaker A: This was part of a whole series of works I believe physicals rendered as nfts and just look at how brilliant the drips are. Just a master here. Sold for 0.01 eth which is what? 35 $38 here to Mikey Wilson legacy. I love it and it's just beautifully, beautifully done as usual. That is your show my friends. Thank you again for your patience.
01:23:51.332 - 01:24:11.620, Speaker A: I'm aiming to come back on Friday. Maybe I just do ordinals, how to mint or how to inscribe on ordinals. Depending on time we'll see how everything's working but my heart, I am still here and I will continue to be here as much as I can and things will get back to normal soon enough. Until next time, take care.
