00:00:05.120 - 00:00:19.994, Speaker A: I guess this was going around what bear market. We're having a ton of fun here. Thanks, guys. That was hilarious. And I'm glad you enjoyed that. A little bit of good humor, I mean. Artist journal, November 10, 2022, Berlin.
00:00:19.994 - 00:01:09.554, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokabelli. And yes, a little bit of fun. You know, anybody who's been in crypto the last year, I'm numb to these, you know, dumps in the price, you know, like, I don't really. Yeah. So, and again, it, like, does that change what we're doing over here? You know, and it kind of brings about this, you know, thought that I've mentioned earlier, which is apart from money transfer, I would argue the main use case for crypto as it stands currently is in fact digital art. The way to buy and sell digital art. And it's kind of like irreducible.
00:01:09.554 - 00:01:48.134, Speaker A: Like everything else is kind of replaceable. Like if you want to do loans and you want to do all these financial products, theoretically a bank can do it, but I don't know how you buy and sell digital art in a credible way that makes both parties, the seller and the buyer, comfortable. Other with blockchain, I don't know how else you do it. So, like, and I'm not sure how many other products out there this is true for, because, you know, if you're say, have a membership of. Okay, you have 5000 tokens, that's kind of all replaceable somewhat. Right. With other.
00:01:48.134 - 00:02:24.554, Speaker A: You don't necessarily need crypto. But I think art, digital art kind of requires crypto. So anyways, so it's hard to get too bearish because there's something irreducible about digital art and crypto and that use case, the crypto use case of digital art. Okay, continuing on. So the fall, big shout out to Martin Joe, a big supporter of this program and what bear market. We're having a ton of fun here. And so this was going around on twitter a little bit and it was funny and I'm glad you guys like that.
00:02:24.554 - 00:02:56.334, Speaker A: Okay, so a cool work. Let's just look at it. There seems to be some irony in the piece, right? I mean, this looks like a couple that is getting informed by a banker as they look at a binance chart of BTC crashing through the floor. It looks like a couple that's being informed that they have defaulted on their mortgage or something. I mean, the darkness surrounding it. So and then the skull of the, you know, person at the bank who's informing them, that's kind of the vibe it gives. And so anyways, available for a tezos, the fall poetic title.
00:02:56.334 - 00:03:15.950, Speaker A: Martin Joe. Big shout out and huge shout out also to Lucas Boond, who did this. Really cool. Kind of like a tribute of sorts. I've been spending my mornings drinking coffee and watching Pokebelly talk about art. Thought I'd let the AI take over and interpret a clip from the journalist. Thank you for sharing awesome art.
00:03:15.950 - 00:03:38.038, Speaker A: My pleasure. Thank you for watching and for enjoying it. You know what's funny about this too, you know, you mentioning the coffee, that's kind like when I don't do this show, it's not like I'm like, oh, what a relief. Like I don't have to do my, you know, this huge amount of work. It's like not going for coffee. And it's actually kind of like, oh, I like going for coffee. I like going for coffee with my friends and talking about stuff.
00:03:38.038 - 00:04:12.798, Speaker A: It really is like, it's effortless for me. It only takes time. Otherwise I would do it. You know, again this weekend I'm going to take off and probably take off. I'm making weekends optional. But again, back to your work here. And this is fascinating as well, the AI, like, I've never uploaded a video to AI and I didn't really know you could, but I have seen these kind of like multi image works before using AI.
00:04:12.798 - 00:04:32.486, Speaker A: So I brought it up big here. And yeah, you can definitely tell these AI distortions in the writing here. And we're going to look at mid journey four this episode. And if you haven't seen it yet, you want to see it. So some very impressive examples. So let's look at Lucas Boone's work here, though. Again, everything's getting.
00:04:32.486 - 00:05:00.372, Speaker A: Art is reflecting life. Art mirrors life. And life mirrors art for two days in a row here. Let's see if we can get this working. There we go. So what's fascinating, too, is how often the AI will just do a variation on like the different interpretations when you slow it down or you hit pause. So it's quite something.
00:05:00.372 - 00:05:50.114, Speaker A: It's almost like the possibilities here are like, it's kind of off the charts. You know, I read a book, it's called the Nature of Technology. I never finished it, but it was a brilliant book and it talked about how, you know, technology is. I'll find that book, it's on my kindle and I'll bring it up because it's actually an important, fascinating philosophical discussion on what technology is. And one of the elements, one of the most important of like the two or three elements that the author was naming who I will find is combination and kind of recombining previous technologies. And in a sense, this is kind of what the AI is doing here with images. It's taking previous references and then creating something new out of it.
00:05:50.114 - 00:06:22.306, Speaker A: Right. So, you know, and that's so just like you get new technologies from kind of taking this gadget here and this gadget and putting them together, and then you all of a sudden you have a jet engine. In a sense, we have the same thing going on, on an image level here where it's taking that image and this image and then creating something new, something novel. So interesting. So anyways, huge shout out to Lucas Boond. AI dreams of an artist journalist. Bye for two.
00:06:22.306 - 00:06:47.674, Speaker A: I continue to be humbled out here and thrilled that you guys like this program. I mean, it's really thrilling. So continuing on, thank you. A couple of comments on yesterday's show, a couple from Lewis. Love the title. Thank you. Yeah, sometimes I review the videos and I thought, yeah, that a community of, what I call it a community of outsiders.
00:06:47.674 - 00:07:03.672, Speaker A: Yes. Yeah, that one just kind of came. That one stood out. So let's use that. Thank you for all the comments. The debate continues and we're talking about chains, right? And, you know, it is ironic because there I am saying, hey, maybe we should go to Solana. Let me just actually.
00:07:03.672 - 00:07:17.886, Speaker A: Oh, sorry. I was going to try and make that bigger for you guys, but that's not working. You know, there I'm saying, let's all go to, you know, let's try Solana two. And there's. Solana is crashing through the floor because some centralized exchange is crashing. Right. FTX.
00:07:17.886 - 00:07:47.704, Speaker A: So, you know, the point has been made. You know, like, I still am sort of like, well, whatever, you know, I'd still try it out, but maybe it's not as high on my list of things to do, let's put it that way. Thank you. Sayonara for the comment. And also, Santiago here, thanks for the feature. The brush screenshot is a default circle shape on Gimp. Now, I believe Gimp is like a free Photoshop, if I remember right, that you can download online.
00:07:47.704 - 00:08:19.160, Speaker A: Heads up if you're tight on a budget, I think. I tried it out once when I was switching computers and I didn't have a license to Photoshop and this sort of thing, so I tried downloading it. I found it quite tricky gimp to use. But this is something very interesting that he brings up, though. He's using a very, very, very simple brush, a default circle shape on gimp. With two pixel size and no brush dynamics. I was kind of joking.
00:08:19.160 - 00:09:08.612, Speaker A: But it's truly what I use the most, and what I like about this is I also use kind of like, it's the pencil tool in Photoshop a lot. And I almost think of it as almost like the counterpart with pixel art. We have a square brush, right? And I have a very wide definition of pixel art because I don't think you can limit it according to size. We generally think of pixel art as kind of big pixels, but it's arbitrary. From philosophically speaking, I would argue it's an arbitrary decision to say it's anything above four pixel brush. Square brush is what pixel art is. So I say anything from one pixel to infinite can be pixel art.
00:09:08.612 - 00:09:58.612, Speaker A: The essential characteristic, we could argue, is the square. Okay, the square brush for pixel art. And I kind of think of the circle, the perfect circle that we get in digital, which is inherently digital because you don't get perfect circles in real life, but we do in digital. To me, it is the natural counterpart. And we have this kind of big focus on the pixel art, quote unquote, with a square, because it's aesthetically awesome. But me as well, and clearly Santiago as well, there is something to be said for the circle and just as being a kind of counterpoint. So I thought that was just kind of an interesting aside that Santiago brings up a couple of sales also today from Ilay, again, so thank you.
00:09:58.612 - 00:10:16.914, Speaker A: Ilay. Snow and storm. I'm going to list a few more this weekend. I'm literally, like, kind of so strapped for time that I haven't. I just need to list like the last four or five. I've been kind of drawing them out a little bit too. But anyways, thank you for supporting that series, and I'm glad you like it.
00:10:16.914 - 00:10:45.520, Speaker A: Arthur Poe, who again, I consult for from time to time. Field trip reveal unfolding nicely. So they have a new drop coming out, and it looks like a pretty big one. Some heavy hitting artists, lots of excitement. Two more works revealing next couple of days and minting starting on Monday. Monday, November 14 Sumi Rey C. Bezaya Gloomtube Mikey Wilson Anthropo Arthropo NFT so here is the sumi work.
00:10:45.520 - 00:11:00.496, Speaker A: There's an epic title, something like God is a her. I don't remember what the name was. Here's the buzzaya work. This is kind of a low res version. And there's Beziah with a head. Is this a head in his hand? So anyways, interesting. It's almost like his alter ego.
00:11:00.496 - 00:11:23.048, Speaker A: He's holding the head of his alter ego, of course, ratcloak and myth, and of course, Mikey Wilson on his BMX. So, yeah, so that is coming. And there is a Twitter space tonight. Wow, that sun is bright, eh? There is a Twitter space tonight. I'm gonna try and go. I actually have a barbecue. It's so nice out.
00:11:23.048 - 00:11:49.302, Speaker A: As you can see, in Berlin, my friend is having a barbecue in mid November, November 10. So we usually wrap up around ten unless the wine is flowing, particularly in a liberal way. So I'm going to try and make it on my. I should be able to hit it on the way home. So that is tonight. Just go to Arthropo's Twitter if you want to join the space. And here we have ratcloak work in progress.
00:11:49.302 - 00:12:19.664, Speaker A: And I love to watch this stuff. I can't tell if he's working on his phone as a wacom, which would be, I mean, humble tools considering what he's doing. Right. So let me just. Hey, guys. So anyways, yeah, so beautiful. And, I mean, just considering the brush work that he does, again, these kind of bacon inspired works, and it's just really fun to watch him work using Photoshop here.
00:12:19.664 - 00:12:36.468, Speaker A: And anyway, always interesting. Continue to explore line colors through deformed figures of human flesh. And let's just give that a retweet. Okay. I thought I retweeted that sometimes. Yeah, like, I follow ratcloak. See? Watch this.
00:12:36.468 - 00:13:05.944, Speaker A: And then, yeah, I follow him, but Twitter is being dumb. Right? Look, now, look. And then I'll go here. This happens. See, now I'm following him, and I didn't touch anything, right? So, yeah, sometimes Twitter will kind of. I'm sure you've all experienced that, where it's like you're following someone, but then it says you're not. So anyways, he has a tazos auction.
00:13:05.944 - 00:13:24.994, Speaker A: 156 tazos. And that sun is, like, directly. I hope it's not wrecking. Maybe something like that. Should I put on sunglasses? Anyway, okay. Too much. Too much focavelli.
00:13:24.994 - 00:13:39.368, Speaker A: Here's an auction, and look at this work. It's a classic. It is a digital art classic. It is a Tezos classic. And Tezos is literally, like, a dollar right now. Maybe a dollar, five or ten. I don't know what it is right now.
00:13:39.368 - 00:13:50.520, Speaker A: You can get it for. I guess it's $170 that you can get this for. It's an edition of 15. I don't have this. It is, like, a super classic. And I believe I brought this up. Yeah.
00:13:50.520 - 00:14:18.846, Speaker A: For us to look at. Again, I believe this is made in Microsoft paint. And you can just see, like, the sheer amount of labor and work in these pieces. I mean, it's beautiful. And he turns. What I love about his work, particularly in this series, is how he takes the square brush that Microsoft paint gives you, and he really turns a bug into a feature, right? Because, you know, traditionally, if you're drawing, you're trying to get it all, right. You don't want that jagged thing.
00:14:18.846 - 00:14:55.580, Speaker A: And he takes it and he turns it into a brilliant feature, which makes it inherently modern. Like, that's why I think these works are quite important. So, yeah, like. And of course, like, another brilliant thing he'll do is, again, these flat colors contrasting with kind of volume, and he just makes that pixel art look so beautiful the way he just treats it. So anyways, and here you have a lot of classics from the scene. You have rada, purple drank, myth, Bezaya, Mikey Wilson, and MF drew. And I'm not sure who this is.
00:14:55.580 - 00:15:18.002, Speaker A: I'm sure most of the community does, though. So, anyways, and then just, like, renaissance painting. Look at this flat green, right? Like, I mean, the temptation would be to put a bunch of detail here, but it probably looks much better just doing this flat green. Look how rough the mountains are, too. So, anyways, I could go on and on, and here it's crisp. And I believe over here, it's not. So.
00:15:18.002 - 00:15:52.574, Speaker A: Just all sorts of, like, it's just really, really beautiful work, you know, tempting to call this a masterpiece here. So edition of 15. And of course, the terrifying cannibal lector Hannibal Lecter mask. Auction ends right away, so I'm going to upload this pronto. So if anybody wants to bid, they will get an opportunity. The HD sometimes takes forever to render, and it's kind of crucial for these videos, so that's sometimes why I have to just wait. Otherwise you guys get weird videos that are all blurry.
00:15:52.574 - 00:16:17.914, Speaker A: Which kind of defeats the point when you're discussing art, doesn't it? Louis Osborne has another portrait, and so a variation on his previous portraits here. I'm not sure what he's going to do with it. I haven't checked his Twitter out. He's gotten an offer for 100. Maybe he'll put it to auction. One of one. These have been doing fairly well and continuing on popple with a work in progress, and I love this stuff.
00:16:17.914 - 00:17:06.154, Speaker A: So with Pixel Ankton from the Pixel Ankton series, Cyclops sketch versus finish. I love how he uses graph paper that's perfect for someone that's doing pixel art to put, you know, to start from. It gets cuts, gets the spirit, doesn't it? So, anyways, it's just fun to watch. You know, I rarely use physical tools these days, and I have practically a studio here that I can work with. But I'm just so excited about digital. But again, you always want to expand and go multimedia, in my opinion, because it really does give you depth, and not just from a pr perspective, but also from just working in different mediums. It gives you true depth.
00:17:06.154 - 00:17:30.964, Speaker A: A beautiful work by Heidi rocket here, a new one minted on. So I'm getting all the notifications. They continue to come in. 23 tezos, edition of 23 traveling. You know, this reminds me of one on one, which is a game my brother and I used to play on the apple Iie when I was just a kid. And it had Larry Bird and doctor J. And some of you might remember that this looks like a.
00:17:30.964 - 00:17:57.404, Speaker A: And you get traveling like this looks like in that spirit of one on one. My mom would remember that, I'm sure. And so, anyway, it's just a really cool Nintendo glitch rom work, of course, by Haiti, and another Nintendo glitch rom work by Maison III. And again, playing with the financial theme here, $1 equal one tazos. Kind of bitter. It looks like just another very interesting variation. I love this work.
00:17:57.404 - 00:18:24.616, Speaker A: I love these works, you know? And Glitchtown Arcade, whose name I was getting wrong a couple of times, I think I was called it Arcade town Glitch. It's Glitchtown Arcade. So sorry, Vito. Shout out to Vito, who is also a really cool Nintendo glitch rom artist, among other things. And Dan control cherry trees in bloom. So I wonder if this is a Monet or if this is a photo. Anyways, I'm really enjoying.
00:18:24.616 - 00:18:37.914, Speaker A: I picked this up. The price is right. One tezos. So I have a dollar for you, Dan, for this guy. I'm a big fan of what Dan's doing here. As you know, we have another work by Dan. They're almost sold out.
00:18:37.914 - 00:19:08.776, Speaker A: Poly jojo maestro museum ilay. It's fun. Hey, this community again, we are having fun. And anybody that's been in crypto for the last year, I mean, I don't even feel this stuff anymore. You know, it's just like, wake me up when it's going up, you know? Okay, so anyway, so nifty gateway had a nifty gateway, which is kind of like an auction platform, had a drop with fake whale where they were bringing in a few people. Ezra. What is her name? Ezra Eslin.
00:19:08.776 - 00:19:28.600, Speaker A: Yes. Ezra Eslin was promoting it. We sort of mentioned it. So she had a one of one. This went for $500. Now, is this on tazos? Can we tell, I wonder. I think this drop was on Tazos, which is kind of interesting.
00:19:28.600 - 00:20:04.912, Speaker A: So anyways, her darkness, as usual, it's kind of like a where's Waldo thing with a whole bunch of disturbing elements in it. No one will find me and Turkirak, who I always want to put in the same room as Ezra Eslin, another new work. And I just. Again, I'm kind of like. I wouldn't necessarily consider this, like, top of mind sort of work, but I'm just kind of drawn to Turkirak's work, so. And again, it's not. It's like, what's interesting about it is it doesn't glamorize our world.
00:20:04.912 - 00:20:39.864, Speaker A: Like, it's almost kind of a raw view. What artist were we looking at that just had this very raw view on reality, this unapologetic view? So anyways, and almost like, you know. Yeah. So I'll see if I can remember who that was that we were discussing. Just like this unflinching view. Oh, you know who it is? You could put it in the same room, die with the most likes. Like, I see us like, isn't that interesting? Right? I guess two tezos guys.
00:20:39.864 - 00:21:14.832, Speaker A: And it's almost like that unflinching view that die with the most likes has, but totally Turkarak's own thing. So I continue to just be, you know, have my eye. I'll probably have to pick up some works here. Bite by bit, words and words, two by Leon. So bite by bit highlights this artist here. And remember we were talking about, is it asemic writing, which is like, asemic writing, which is like a. In Greek is often like the opposite.
00:21:14.832 - 00:21:47.424, Speaker A: So semiotics and writing and meaning asymmetric is kind of like writing without meaning. And here, like, they have just like, leon Vilhenna has just shapes and then kind of putting random words. You could argue. Remember, we were even seeing that in John Baldazari's Giotto works just kind of almost random words, juxtaposing hard with the. With the giottos that are. He had a word. What's the name of that color? The purple giottoes, let's just call it that.
00:21:47.424 - 00:22:11.074, Speaker A: Watched a couple of episodes ago, if you're wondering what I'm talking about. And this is interesting, too, and this is from a month ago, October 6. But we don't need to stick to the last 24 hours here. We are free to do whatever we want to do here. And this is like a, I think she calls it a poem. Poem by and for Anna Molina. After embody blue dark doubt.
00:22:11.074 - 00:22:40.960, Speaker A: And I'm not a big poem guy, unless it's like Edgar Allan Poe or older, but. And nothing against it either, by the way. But I don't mind this. After embody blue dark doubt every empty frog fall grow hard as last move by. You know what I like about it is it's not too sentimental because that's where I start to, you know, personally and everybody has their own tastes and everything. So anyways, just go. Good looking work.
00:22:40.960 - 00:23:01.720, Speaker A: What is the market on this? Just transferred to Anna Molina. Imagesoftheweek tez poem by and for. So someone made a poem and it looks like they collaborated. Interesting, interesting, interesting. Flora Marquez. Now more work that is not new. Tradscape had mentioned this to me in a message.
00:23:01.720 - 00:23:17.304, Speaker A: Hey, don't forget about Flora Marquez. And he's absolutely right. So if you haven't seen Flora Marquez's work, she does a lot of these stamps is what I would say. And yeah, I'm a huge fan of her work. I've boughten. I think I got that guy. I think I have that guy.
00:23:17.304 - 00:23:49.564, Speaker A: So if you don't know about her. Yeah, like, look at this. And she's got kind of like these fake stamps that are beautifully done. And so just another artist kind of put on your list who is very interesting. Kind of like a Tezos classic. Again, one of these kind of just native Internet artists that just come out of the woodwork by virtue of this technology that we are all enjoying here. Just like this show wouldn't exist probably without the Tezos blockchain, you know, even though we are multi chain here, we are not exclusive.
00:23:49.564 - 00:24:11.322, Speaker A: So this was also an interesting work we saw on Twitter. And like, this might not even be minted anywhere. So just a nice kind of abstract work here. Let's pretend it didn't happen by Rick Ostenbrook. So hopefully I got your name. Semi right. Just interesting work here as we kind of delve into a little bit of abstraction.
00:24:11.322 - 00:24:35.334, Speaker A: Feels cube one has a new work. Let's see. Yeah, like, I mean, feels has like a really strong market. Again, like a Tezos classic artist here. Let me get rid of that. Yeah, so there it is. Just a lot of basically very trippy looking lines and colors by feels, as per usual.
00:24:35.334 - 00:25:01.494, Speaker A: And a new work by lb edition of eleven for five. Eye of illusion. The one who is entranced by this eye becomes the illusionist puppet forever. Analog glitch, Gif loop, Adderall, V four, which is a video mixer, mismatcher rescan from CRT. So traveling through the mediums here is lb here, as per usual. So very interesting work, as always. Just good looking video work.
00:25:01.494 - 00:25:41.428, Speaker A: And another work by edge Q. So I believe he tweeted that he makes the music on these, so that's cool, right? So another. This could be, like, this is another take on the single, right? You just put, like a modified basketball card, you know? And I love, again, I love this trope, too, of putting it in, like, the protective covering. I'll show you guys at some point some old works I did. Oh, it stopped. Okay, maybe that's good. I'll show you some old works I did that used this.
00:25:41.428 - 00:26:11.384, Speaker A: I have a few from the nostalgia study series from, like, literally 2014 or whatever. So I've been exploring a lot of these themes that I'm into for years. I love doing that and just returning and, like, what happens when I'm 60 years old and I'm doing it, you know, and it'll probably make a fascinating. Some fascinating rooms, whatever I'm doing, you know, and just see that evolution. Right? Minta has finished her work. I thought it was great. Stop.
00:26:11.384 - 00:26:25.234, Speaker A: Minta. Art. Who is Minta? This is my favorite here. No more screenshots, no more screenshots, no more concept. We want gangster art. So she is replying the protest. Mostly I receive love and admiration.
00:26:25.234 - 00:26:49.998, Speaker A: It just called my attention a few messages of people complaining about my art because of its lack of personality. This is actually really interesting. Some people describe my work as not to talk about. Well, I barely talk about my work, actually, as kind of lacking, like, where. Where is you and. But it's actually a compliment that people give. They like how it's kind of.
00:26:49.998 - 00:27:07.494, Speaker A: It's more kind of. It's not just about me and my personal feelings and me and, like, to me, that's kind of secondary. Right. And this is not a bug. This is what I'm trying to say to Minta here. Complain about my art because of its lack of personality. I just thought it was funny.
00:27:07.494 - 00:27:27.278, Speaker A: And I did this artwork, digital soft pastel's drawing. This is in my universe, Minta. This is a feature and not a bug. Okay? So don't. Yeah, don't let the naysayers spring you down. I picked up a work in solidarity, and I actually quite like the colors and I like the subject matter. I like Minta's work.
00:27:27.278 - 00:27:50.268, Speaker A: So anyways, you can pick it up on object still available. How many are left? Only eight left. And yeah, we have some impressive collectors here. Shilley, Preston, rustic digital art and more. Look at this. So Dan control, and remember, it was rare, rare force. One who was doing Boston dynamics dog.
00:27:50.268 - 00:28:12.838, Speaker A: Well, you know, Dan Control does his take on it. And a very nice work here. We could have opened the show with this. Dan gets a lot of attention here, though, so we want to share it around. And Martin Joe actually hit the zeitgeist there. So that's why we went with Martin Joe. And it was a beautiful work, too, and poetic.
00:28:12.838 - 00:28:44.780, Speaker A: Anyways, both Boston dynamics here doing the dog. So this is on foundation where it seems like it's like artists want to put on ethereum, those kind of more. It's like I was describing it. It's like you put your sketchbook work sometimes on tazos. Not necessarily, but for some artists, if you're working multi chain, and then you put the big oil painting on ETH just because you think you can get more money for it, it's basically, see, this is half an ETH is the reserve. So let's see how it goes. The Sun foundation, that's the fun part about being multi chain.
00:28:44.780 - 00:29:19.092, Speaker A: And maybe on Solana, you do something that's going to be about $100, right. Axin has a new work. This was interesting. I lucked out and was able to pick one up on primary intentional separation from present day beliefs, reading inspirational quotes in VR. So this is interesting again. So we have the VR person, the VR mask. So there's a lot going on here conceptually, isn't there? And there's like this window, a retro computer, and the images, the screens are coming out of the computer.
00:29:19.092 - 00:29:40.342, Speaker A: It's almost like you're experiencing, you want to relate these two images, but there's no super clear way on how they relate together. And I actually like that. Ambiguity. Ambiguity is an important theme. I mean, Shakespeare to get classical. I mean, he's, I guess, you know, classics of english literature. He.
00:29:40.342 - 00:30:04.290, Speaker A: I mean, ambiguity is a virtue in poetry. You know, I want to. Classical poetry is the wrong word, because by classics, usually we mean like the Greeks and the Romans. But, you know, classics of english literature, ambiguity is again, a feature. And so ambiguity is a wonderful thing. It's like Warhol's dollar bill, which we're going to see a variation of. That is an ambiguous work.
00:30:04.290 - 00:30:19.834, Speaker A: Is it a celebration of capitalism, or is it a critique? Or what is being said the Campbell soup can. That's why it's actually kind of better. Because it's not too. What some people would say is didactic. Which is a word for being basically. It's not too obvious. It's good to be ambiguous.
00:30:19.834 - 00:30:38.106, Speaker A: You know, the opposite of ambiguous is to be didactic. And didactic, I think, is a word for, like, teaching. And to be overly obvious about it. Moving on to AI unstable. From a collection called unstable dreams. I don't know if we've ever looked at nikita. But nikita kind of won the poetry of the day.
00:30:38.106 - 00:30:53.254, Speaker A: As far as the AI artists, at least, I think, yeah, like, I mean, this was a great one. Maybe somewhat didactic. But I still. I mean, just a great work. The green moon was interesting too, here. And kind of. We've seen these kind of strange thing.
00:30:53.254 - 00:31:14.582, Speaker A: Kind of like figures. These draped figures. And then looking sort of like we were seeing in Martin Joe's work. The binance screen crashing through the floor and bleeding. I thought just a. You know, it was just one of those works that just nailed the zeitgeist. So AI work available for one tezos under the full moon.
00:31:14.582 - 00:31:41.614, Speaker A: And it was a full moon. Some of these investor guys are like, see, the moon cycles do matter for investing. And I was like, okay, interesting. Okay, so this is important before I get blinded again here. So mid journey, before we're starting to see people are dropping their results. And look at this. I mean, look at the high fidelity is really what I'm looking at here.
00:31:41.614 - 00:32:11.306, Speaker A: We're seeing the AI distortions are starting to be ironed out. And as, you know, strange thing. And I think Clownvamp might have mentioned earlier on a couple of months ago. When we were starting our AI discussion. I didn't understand at first that the AI distortions could be seen as a feature and not a bug. And as they get ironed out, it'll be seen probably as a feature. Right? And once I started using AI, I started to feel the same way.
00:32:11.306 - 00:32:25.688, Speaker A: It's like, oh, you kind of like the AI distortions. You know, where the hand looks like the. You can't tell if it's a chair arm or the end of a hand. And just whatever. Because they seem to be getting fixed. Is kind of the moral of the story here. And look at this.
00:32:25.688 - 00:32:40.256, Speaker A: Mid journey v one. This is from weird AI creations. Mid journey v one versus mid journey v four. We've truly come a long way in six months. Okay, so this is v one. Look at that. V four.
00:32:40.256 - 00:33:27.182, Speaker A: So, remember last episode? I believe we were talking about unknown collector was saying the geometric, or, sorry, the. That's an old school word for exponential, geometric. You'll find that in Thomas Maltese's essay on the principle of population, where he's talking about population growth expanding at a geometric, which can mean exponential rate and how we are all going to run out of resources. That often turns out to be wrong. So if you ever hear the term malthusianism, I believe that's how you pronounce it. That is what people are referring to, this idea that overpopulation will lead to resource scarcity. And, yeah, we seem to be actually maybe entering a decade where the ideas of Malthus may become more popular.
00:33:27.182 - 00:34:07.314, Speaker A: He's an 18th century thinker. How have we got on this? But, you know, for your information, you guys like this stuff. An 18th century thinker came out in the 1790s. So an interesting early, I guess we'd call that sociological, kind of like demographic, and just like, kind of early sociological demographic work, you know, social science, we might consider it often proved wrong, though, thanks to technology, we haven't run out of food so far anyways. We have run way off course here. Mid journey v four. Look at this.
00:34:07.314 - 00:34:40.442, Speaker A: So this sink is where, you know, so where are the AI distortions? If you kind of look closely, you can see in this over here, this spoon, which looks like maybe it should be a fork, but they're starting to get ironed out. AI distortions are starting to get ironed out. Look at this. Star wars blueprints. I feel like I recognize the book that this was taken from. So, again, if you look close, you can start to see, you know, the imperfect circle here and your classic kind of AI distortions. It's interesting what it does with writing, too.
00:34:40.442 - 00:35:05.288, Speaker A: Hey. Like, it just turns writing into a visual thing. I think this is based on a book, and I'd bring it up, but I was having mic problems today, so I'm not gonna load up these. Oh, but I am gonna show you the rest of these Star wars blueprints. So I feel like I know the book, but look at how impressive this is. You know, there's c three, Po R. So even.
00:35:05.288 - 00:35:46.962, Speaker A: It's very interesting what it does with the letters. So mid journey v four is shaking things up. And as unknown collector said, this stuff is improving at an exponential rate. As unknown collector said, if you don't, if you're not focusing on what makes you unique, like, you're gonna be out of business as an artist. So, as I was saying yesterday, double down on what makes you unique. And I think we all feel that, you know, that we have this kind of uniqueness in us, and sometimes we kind of bat it away and don't believe in it. But what you want to do is actually triple down on it and then you kind of have what you have to offer.
00:35:46.962 - 00:36:09.606, Speaker A: The world will be presented, because otherwise, AI, if you're just going to be derivative, AI will probably replace you. As unknown collector was saying. He's probably right. Here's another one example. The accuracy in the details of mid journey V four is superb. So here we see almost like an illustrative kind of version. This is almost a whole genre in itself.
00:36:09.606 - 00:36:30.874, Speaker A: These kind of spaces that we find sometimes. It's often, like pixelated kind of work, digital work. There's a few artists I have in my collection that kind of play with this. I love it. And, yeah, I mean, that's AI. That is not a drawing. So you see the distortions are starting to get ironed out.
00:36:30.874 - 00:36:59.982, Speaker A: Charles AI, I wonder if he's using midjourney V four yet. It's an interesting question. I'm not sure I'm enjoying him covering the crypto crash metaphorically. This looks like a waterfall of lava or something. Just kind of an apocalyptic scene here from Charles AI. And he has another one which sold, I believe this was put up yesterday, and this sold for 1.45 ETH.
00:36:59.982 - 00:37:27.502, Speaker A: So again, what bear market for Charles AI? He's rocking and rolling here. Just brought in another two grand, so making a ton of money. And also we have a work by Shilly Preston. I thought this was interesting. It was using Adam Disbrow's work red day, which I believe is cc zero. He was given credit on Twitter. Let's look at the title.
00:37:27.502 - 00:37:59.266, Speaker A: Tuesday afternoon, discussing regional bird species with Adam Disbrow AI, Photoshop. And I think this work by Adam Disbrow red day kind of has a bit of a dally feel to it with the egg. So, anyway, it's just an interesting work, you know, nice brushwork. So it looks like it's probably raw AI, as they say. And it's also considered trash art, which is interesting in his series find trash. So interesting AI work from Shilly Preston. Here's another one.
00:37:59.266 - 00:38:15.370, Speaker A: This one turned out kind of cool. Yeah, I agree. Look at that sky. So just. And just like these weird sort of lines through the skies. So more novel imagery courtesy of AI going into physical work here. So this was also part of the fake whale cross sale.
00:38:15.370 - 00:38:33.990, Speaker A: So this is an NFT of a physical work, and walk is like an artist to watch. In my opinion. Look at this portrait of Warhol, which he nails. He nails it with his spray paint. And this is a physical work. Don't think so. This is probably a quote from Warhol.
00:38:33.990 - 00:38:49.444, Speaker A: Let's see this. Sold for dollar 520. Don't think about making art. Just get it done. Let everyone else decide if it's good or bad, whether they love it or hate it. While they are deciding, make even more art. That is very likely a quote of Andy Warhol, who was a work, work, work.
00:38:49.444 - 00:39:17.484, Speaker A: It's all about the work. Like in the sense of putting in the time and just work, work, work, constantly make work. If you do that, like, that is the key. There's no shortcuts, right? So original work, spray on paper, 70 by 84.2. Original physical piece will be shipped at the artist charge to the auction winner. So I love, love, love this idea. And again, to me, this is how this is going to go.
00:39:17.484 - 00:39:37.156, Speaker A: Because eBay, where wok also had to work, doesn't feel right, does it? It's just not enough of a nice marketplace. But you put on nifty gateway, you put on object. It's a nice enough marketplace. Or sell your physical work. Maybe you make a collection, maybe I'll do that. Make a collection. You know, physical collection, and you just sell your.
00:39:37.156 - 00:40:15.108, Speaker A: If people want to buy stuff, this is how much it is. Like, why not? I have a ton of physical work on paper, 5 meters from me. Like, literally this many papers. So why aren't I putting some of that online, right? And finally, actually, we have a couple of artists. So walk with a play on Warhol's dollar bill, but doing the spray paint version, I think this is totally brilliant. Again, walk is every passing day, kind of like, he is an artist to watch, in my opinion. Like really, really good with the spray paint.
00:40:15.108 - 00:40:32.452, Speaker A: Here. Here's an artist that I've known about on Twitter, on Instagram for years, nugget Brain. He's actually a super awesome artist. I wonder if we, like, look at this. He's doing really well. He's having shows. And I guess this is him working.
00:40:32.452 - 00:40:57.554, Speaker A: Like he's got a really cool style. So I thought, why not show his work? There's the Guggenheim. So just oil painter, you know? So as we also, we are multi chain and multimedia, as I like to say, just an awesome painter. So nuggetbrain on. I guess Dan control knows who nugget brain is. And then look at this. Like, nice.
00:40:57.554 - 00:41:19.010, Speaker A: Like, very nice. Like drawing two colored pencil drawing. So, you know, look at this still life so a really, really, really cool artist. And of course, I can't remember what you call these, but again, my friend is obsessed with these. Kind of lucky to be in luck. They manic. Yeah, they're like lucky cat clocks or something.
00:41:19.010 - 00:41:25.314, Speaker A: Anyways, my friends, thank you for joining me today. And as ever, until next time, take care.
