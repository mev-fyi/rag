00:00:05.920 - 00:01:01.634, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 12, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, your artist reporter on the scene where we go beyond objects sometimes to Twitter, and it brings up a very, you know, something that's been obvious to many of us for quite a while now, which is that if you want to find exciting new art, you go to Twitter. You don't go to Instagram. I mean, I'm just speaking from my own experience, so, you know, don't any of you Instagram aficionados get offended by me. But I am speaking from my own experience. And, like, when I think of Instagram art, I think of actually everything I've seen before, if you know what I mean. Everything that I'm supposed to like, trad art world, etcetera.
00:01:01.634 - 00:01:26.506, Speaker A: And as we like, I have nothing against the tradition here. As we all know, I am all about the tradition in a lot of ways. The italian painting tradition is one of the greatest things that humanity has produced, as well as all the other painting traditions out there. So, um. Yeah, so anyway, so I saw this piece. I don't want to waste too much time. Again, thank you for all the comments, and thank you for tuning in again.
00:01:26.506 - 00:01:49.140, Speaker A: I'm trying to keep these shorter, okay. Because they kind of go on and on, and I'm doing that right now. So let's get right to it. I saw w o c here. I'd never heard of them, but I saw this as a retweet or something. I just thought this was a nice way of commemorating September 11. And it looks like it's been done with spray paint, almost like a street art type thing.
00:01:49.140 - 00:02:20.734, Speaker A: Like street art. Like the guys when you're on tour and you see these guys doing like pyramids and UFO's and asking for a couple of bucks for their thing. And you see it's often with spray paint and they have their mask on, or they should. And this kind of reminds me of that. And so I liked it on just a kind of, for lack of better term, an authentic level like that. It's just like this relatively humble tools, shall we say. It's not using AI, which we will get back into.
00:02:20.734 - 00:02:52.300, Speaker A: But what I also liked is how it worked out just conceptually, which is it's just kind of a fuzzy memory in a sense, and it kind of captures it. It was a major media event. Here's the COVID of time. And it was the two buildings blowing up. And it was a terrible day. And I thought WOC, intentionally or not, did a beautiful job of capturing it. Like, to me, this is a great capturing commemoration of the event.
00:02:52.300 - 00:04:02.394, Speaker A: So there was one other piece that w o C posted, which also looks like a kind of street art, and it's the burning building. Similar idea, like this spray paint on basically a wall. So again, and it's easy to say, like, it's easy to criticize artists that are taking on subject matter like this, because I've seen it fairly. I wouldn't call them super prominent artists, but who I'm not going to name, but showing, like, you know, people falling from the Twin Towers, which I think is easy to criticize because imagine if that was you or a family member, and then some artist dude is showing someone falling out of a building to promote what, and to really, what are we, what are we helping with? What are we helping people understand here by doing that? So that's another reason why I kind of like these fuzzy versions. It's not in a weird way, I would say it's kind of, it's going in the opposite direction of sensationalizing the tragedy. Because all these media events, I mean, we're so numb. The death of effect, as JG Ballard puts it.
00:04:02.394 - 00:04:30.370, Speaker A: You know, we no longer feel these things anymore. War, whatever, unless, of course, you're in it. But as, you know, mass media consumers, we no longer feel anything anymore. And just as media consumers, period. All these, like, everything's become abstracted. This is a major Ballard theme which we will return to. So I just wanted to point these out.
00:04:30.370 - 00:04:59.590, Speaker A: This kind of, for me, that was kind of like the most exciting thing I saw yesterday. I went to his objective. If you go to w o C, and then you click on the object, which is what I did here. Not minted either, which in a weird way, I'd say is kind of a classy move. Kind of a classy move. So I don't know who this person is. W o c, but kind of interesting.
00:04:59.590 - 00:05:14.054, Speaker A: Okay, they have an instagram. Maybe they have their name here. No, just another one of the life of Pablo screenshots. I don't know if that's. Oh, that's just something for sale. Anyway, I don't want to get too deep into that. Let's continue.
00:05:14.054 - 00:05:42.200, Speaker A: So strange thing back on the menu. Hello, strange thing. Thank you for watching, and thank you for the comments. You left a really nice comment, which I saw at four in the morning when I woke up and was kind of bored lying in bed and looked at Twitter. And there was a very nice retweet and comment from strange thing, which we'll get into. So there's a bit of drama yesterday for him and he is one of the biggest sellers right now on object. And so he put out this piece yesterday, trademark objected, objected.
00:05:42.200 - 00:06:20.154, Speaker A: Special edition airdrop. So from my understanding, and we'll get into it quickly here, he was kicked off of object temporarily for using the Nike for basically copyright violation. So let's read his story here very quickly. In the early morning of the 11 September I was informed my account had been banned due to trademark concerns by object. I was witnessing many an object's discord rushing to my defense even before I had arguing fair use. This piece is dedicated to fair use and what art could look like if we had to blur out every logo in our art. So, right, so here.
00:06:20.154 - 00:06:57.144, Speaker A: But it is also thanks to thank those who supported me in a terrifying moment, especially clown vampire for accepting the request to represent me when I couldn't even type due to shock and also to wise an object, as I understand they were just protecting artists and collectors. I believe it has also allowed object to learn more about trademark and fair use. So this potentially won't affect any more artists again in the future and can allow us to express ourselves with freedom. Thank you. Strange thing, I don't know what Maif you guys helped me with MJ, so thank you for that. I know now that's mid journey actually. I want to open that up quickly.
00:06:57.144 - 00:07:22.924, Speaker A: But first let's just tackle so a couple of things and we'll make it very quick. So he was reinstated, so we're happy for him. Yeah, interesting things. I mean, history of art. You look, of course, the first thing everybody, at least I think of, of course, is Warhol's Campbell soup. And what Campbell's soup did, from my understanding, they realized there was better publicity for them than to crack down on Warhol. And which was totally true.
00:07:22.924 - 00:08:06.414, Speaker A: It made them way more famous than they ever could have dreamt of. And they were already, of course, super famous in, in a sense, they didn't need Warhol, but Warhol probably is. It's the best. You can't buy that kind of advertising. And I think a lot of american corporations have actually followed in Campbell's footsteps. After maybe first cracking down more in the eighties and nineties and even early two thousands, you could expect a crackdown. I see kind of a loosening, I don't know if you see that too, but like with Disney, they're not cracking down on every single person that is kind of doing something with Donald Ducker, Mickey Mouse, because they're actually on thin ice themselves because their copyrights keep getting extended, I think, by Congress, from what I understand.
00:08:06.414 - 00:08:40.234, Speaker A: I thought there was a law like 75 or 80 years, and then it goes into public domain, all your intellectual property. So from what I understand, from what I've been told, this is just a story Disney keeps getting Congress or somehow gets a special. These things are getting extended. So they're actually on thin ice. So. And as far as Nike, I mean, I would think these are pretty cool works. We could argue on the vanguard, on the forefront of the AI art scene.
00:08:40.234 - 00:09:18.240, Speaker A: Okay, so Nike should take this as a massive compliment. Now, if he starts, if strange things, start selling clothing with the Nike logo and then calling it his art, okay, then there's a thing. Now, to be fair, to object. Object is probably going. At first they're probably like, oh, maybe we need to take this off. I'm just imagining here because, you know, Nike might not like that and we can't risk the platform is what they're thinking. But then with the blowback, with everybody responding, they also couldn't risk losing the artist.
00:09:18.240 - 00:10:14.108, Speaker A: So they probably thought to themselves, I'm imagining we're better off just letting this kind of work happen and to be, frankly, sued by Nike, if that's what it comes down to, and deal with it then, and we can't buy that kind of publicity anyway, and we'll blow up in a good way if Nike sues us. So, which is kind of the, you know, I use a lot of appropriated imagery and I've always sort of said, like, you know, tell mom I would love, like, if somebody, someone, if Google wants to sue me or whomever, like, they can, that would be the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. And put out a press release the next day. Pokebelly sued by Google. Artist Pokebelly sued by Google. So anyways, I'm happy for him because you don't know where he may live off this stuff. Or maybe this is the big break that he's always wanted and all of a sudden it's just kind of been taken from him for all we know.
00:10:14.108 - 00:10:32.708, Speaker A: I don't know, I don't know. Strange things name. But a very friendly guy. He left a very nice comment yesterday while I was asleep here. Another great show by pokebelly. Talking about yesterday's show. It was amazing that I managed to help a skeptic understand the complex process which is more than pressing a button using AI as artists.
00:10:32.708 - 00:10:58.374, Speaker A: Thank you for having this conversation with the community and me, your friends. Strange thing. Well, thank you because you have contributed enormously to this conversation now. Okay, we have another AI work. I just want to point out to Sumi. Great. Now, I wanted to show people very quickly, discord and this whole AI bot how it works.
00:10:58.374 - 00:11:26.824, Speaker A: Basically, you join Midjourneys Discord, which in the last episode I showed how you can do that just from the link you have to own. You have to have a copy of discord downloaded on your computer. And then you put slash. Imagine when you follow their instructions. And I'll just show you how it works. I thought of a kind of a funny one, Elon Musk eating at McDonald's. And let's see what happens here.
00:11:26.824 - 00:12:12.444, Speaker A: So I want to show people how it works because not everybody is going to download this and whatever. So just again, we're trying to figure out all of this stuff and just what it means and in a really kind of, truly kind of honest way, not having a dog in the fight. Like, you see, there's, where's McDonald's here? Like, you see the. And maybe there's an issue using trademarks. Oh, but maybe there. So let's see. But here's just another example where 50% there kind of unimpressive on this one, which is why I said in the last episode, it's not as easy as pressing a button and saying, oh, okay, now I'm going to get some masterpiece.
00:12:12.444 - 00:12:47.090, Speaker A: And you see, like, the words, which are like magical incantations, I was thinking to myself, these are like spells. I mean, it's, what are the words you're using? And that's what determines where's our, what happened to our thing here? That's what determines, that's what determines what results here. Here we go. So there's Elon Musk. He doesn't even, he looks like more like David Duchovny or something here. So interesting. And then you can do it again.
00:12:47.090 - 00:13:26.132, Speaker A: You can redo it. And on the discord, you can see everybody else's queries or prompts or whatever you want to call it. So you can see what other people are putting in, you know, flying amongst the stars, exploding supernova, star flares, gas clouds, and then they get something like this. Okay, so just to clue people in very quickly. So then you go back and we see this AI work, say, by Sumi Ray, I think sumi Ray, you sees AI account. And then you go, oh, okay. Now, again, I haven't even opened Dall E, and Dalli looks super promising.
00:13:26.132 - 00:13:52.604, Speaker A: So I'm not totally, like, convinced yet, but I'm, like, impressed and I'm just open minded in a weird. I'd say I just don't have a dog in this fight, is how I'd put it. And if we discover that this is a great tool, which is what it's looking like, I can't wait to use it. Right? I can't wait to make my own series of AI. Whatever. Okay. But first, it's.
00:13:52.604 - 00:14:18.256, Speaker A: Okay. So, you know, again, we're starting. The point is to go a little bit slowly with this AI investigation so that we're very careful and methodical in what we're discovering here. Okay, so enough about that. So we showed you mid journey, just a quick thing. So we had this Minta work, which is kind of this meta work, pay what you want, and it's like this infinite regress. I kind of like that.
00:14:18.256 - 00:14:42.044, Speaker A: And I was just thinking, you know, when I saw strange things work about being banned, and I saw the screenshot, and Minta done a screenshot, I just thought, like, this is great. Like, I thought of Minta when I saw this, which is kind of funny. So that's why I had Minta here. Pay what you want on Minta's work. I think it might be done. I don't. Oh, yeah.
00:14:42.044 - 00:15:12.064, Speaker A: No, you can still make an offer. Okay, what else? We had this by rat cloak. See, he put out a one of one. Interesting. What I would say fusion of the phone art, or call it what we will art made on a smartphone, in his case. And the Microsoft paintwork. Like we see, we saw this a kind of, like, kafka esque character in the Kafka piece.
00:15:12.064 - 00:15:35.324, Speaker A: Okay. And so that has been worked in that whole kind of theme. So we're seeing kind of the finger art gallery. I don't want to say merge, but kind of cross over with the no kings, no masters series. So just kind of an interesting thing. Again, beautifully done, signed interestingly. And.
00:15:35.324 - 00:15:59.716, Speaker A: Yeah, so just another kind of with an americana background. Again, very interesting colors. Nice flat blue sky. And the dog, I mean, and the black dripping. Not sure I think of oil, but there might be other. I'm not sure what's going on here, but a beautiful rendering, as usual. And so web links picked that up after about an hour.
00:15:59.716 - 00:16:20.092, Speaker A: This went on at 02:05 it was listed, and exactly an hour later, web links picked it up for 500 tezos. So another big sale for Ratcloaksea. So congratulations to both. And remember, this one went for 320. Also to web links. So weblinks continues the buying spree. New one by LB.
00:16:20.092 - 00:16:56.460, Speaker A: So a lot of, you know, lb video artists we've talked about them once. Just, you know, just kind of interesting work, more of an abstract thing, consistently putting out work. Thank you to Bobabu ETH for picking up this from the sketchbook. She's going, which is about Nancy Pelosi. It was just playing with screenshots of, in this case, the drudge report of Nancy Pelosi going to Taiwan. So just, you know, I really enjoy that contrast of the square pixel and sketching. So just doing what I'd call a pixel art sketchbook.
00:16:56.460 - 00:17:31.910, Speaker A: And people could say, well, that's not pixel art. But I was thinking pixel art for me, just a definition is art with a square brush, with a pixel brush, because otherwise you can't say it's of a certain size because then it's just arbitrary. If you say, oh, well, it has to be big pixels and not small pixels. So I use it in a general sense in this pixel art sketchbook. So thank you very much to baba boo for picking up that sketch. It was a lot of fun to make in the pixel art sketchbook. Going to make a lot more and just looking at our power outages coming.
00:17:31.910 - 00:17:37.414, Speaker A: So with that, I hope you enjoyed this episode. And until next time, take care.
