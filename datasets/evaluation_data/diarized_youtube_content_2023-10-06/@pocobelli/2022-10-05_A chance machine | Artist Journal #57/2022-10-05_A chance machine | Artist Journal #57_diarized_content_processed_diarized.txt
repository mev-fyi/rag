00:00:05.480 - 00:00:58.838, Speaker A: Controversy abounds. Artist Journal, October 5, 2022 Berlin my name is Adrian Pokebelli and I was thinking to myself, the great Heraclitus, the presocratic philosopher, the dark philosopher, 500 BCE. The sun is new each day. One of my favorite sayings of all time, he is famous for the saying, all we have is fragments. From my understanding, he spoke in these, would you call it an epigram maxim? He's probably most famous for you can't step into the same river twice. In other words, everything is in flux. So kind of these mystical sayings.
00:00:58.838 - 00:01:27.094, Speaker A: And I thought that to myself, one of my favorite sayings again, I used to have a little aggregator newspaper 1015 years ago and that's what I'd put at the top. The sun is new each day. So anyways, we have a great show for you here today. Some really interesting comments. We're going to push this AI debate further thanks to Roontoon, a regular watcher of the program. So this is awesome, guys. We're having a lot of fun over here.
00:01:27.094 - 00:02:15.360, Speaker A: And here's a great work by Shilly Preston, which kind of illustrates this episode a little bit. AI work with a x copy on one side and this wonderful AI, Henri Rousseau on the other. Clearly AI and basically a guy, not an entrenched coat, but almost a private detective looking guy, just someone's dad looking at the paintings, Ari Rousseau admiring a grifter at the moment, or Henri Rousseau stable diffusion, as we've been pointing out. So I can't wait to try that wasteman Goldman stable diffusion the other day, and Photoshop. So let's get right down to it here. So there is a ton to get through today. It may take a few episodes to kind of really digest what we're doing here.
00:02:15.360 - 00:02:39.074, Speaker A: So yeah, as far as commenting and pushing this AI debate further, but that's the beauty of doing something all the time. We can just keep discussing it and, and get familiar, re familiarize ourselves with these arguments. Okay, a couple of quick things. Corrections or what have you. MF doom. MF doom is JJ doom. So a hip hop guy.
00:02:39.074 - 00:03:21.884, Speaker A: So I don't want to play too much in case the copyright police come after me, but basically it is this guy here who passed away and who apparently is a legendary rapper or hip hop artist. You guys tell me because clearly I am not in the loop on that. But there is our reference here in that painting we saw yesterday. In Xander Price's painting, the opensea logo was a reference to Bowie. So it wasn't some terrible design decision that they backtracked on it was actually because there was a David Bowie drop. Thank you, JK, for mentioning that. So I did a quick look on that and we're actually going to look at the Bowie drop right away here.
00:03:21.884 - 00:03:44.196, Speaker A: And thank you to Aaron. Eric. Nope, your show is unique. I appreciate hearing that because, you know, there's nothing harder than self awareness and evaluating yourself and what's going on. There's nothing harder than to get distance from yourself, right? So that's what friends are for. Find your blind spots. We're really in a.
00:03:44.196 - 00:04:27.084, Speaker A: Here we are almost ancient greek philosophy here, I think, as Aristotle said, kind of referencing Plato. Two friends. And this is the spirit of the conversation I want to have today. Two friends with good intentions, trying to get to the truth. That is dialectic and how it's done. Not trying to, you know, being entrenched in one sort of view over another, but two friends in conversation trying to get to the truth. A very quick shout out to Fort Gallery NFT for including me in their wonderful thread here, this work coach ad, which I'm more and more happy with over time.
00:04:27.084 - 00:04:43.804, Speaker A: Let's just look at the thread really quickly. I don't think we have the time to go through all of it, but they put a lot of work about it. Let's talk about the works in the avant garde. So, Fort NFT, thank you for the shout out and including me and this. Very nice. Look at this. This looks like Mobius, the comic artist.
00:04:43.804 - 00:05:07.556, Speaker A: It's not, but you know, in that tradition. So just this person, Lopez de Carlome, I have never seen before. I think I just gave them a follow, a bookmarked 875. I mean, it looks like Paul Delvaux. Do you know Paul Delvaux? Great surrealist. It looks just like Paul Delvaux, actually. I mean, not exactly.
00:05:07.556 - 00:05:29.454, Speaker A: Don't get me wrong. Let's just bring up Paul Delvaux here. So you know who that is? A very kind of classic surrealist, but not kind of like your Magritte or Dali fame, you know, just doing. Yeah, like kind of like these kind of rooms. Right. Paul del Vaux. Kind of like.
00:05:29.454 - 00:05:59.824, Speaker A: I almost want to call him an artist's artist a little bit. So anyway, very interesting work. From Car Lopez to Carlo. Yeah, for me, this screams Delvo. Anyway, so check out their feed here, check out their thread. Got die with the most likes. And I was really pleased they go so well together.
00:05:59.824 - 00:06:26.214, Speaker A: So anyways, this is a really cool, all of it, very cool. And, you know, playing with the crypto punks. So anyways, they put a lot of work into that thread. So check it out. This David Bowie NFT collaboration is what happened. Fiosius sold one of the pieces for 127,000. So Feioshus work continues to sell for big money.
00:06:26.214 - 00:06:46.544, Speaker A: Here is the work. Let's look at the. Did I bring up the. But let me bring up. This is the collection here, if you haven't seen it. So this is why they changed the logo, because of that David Bowie. You know, I don't know if that's makeup or what paint on the face sort of thing reference.
00:06:46.544 - 00:07:25.444, Speaker A: So these are going for big money and they are not simply a cash grab. They are going to charity care, which is David Bowie's charity. So here's the Bowie feuocious. What's Bowie's wife's name again? I think it's a mom. Anyways, 100% of the profits go to the Bowie estate and will benefit CaIR, for which Emon is its first ever global advocate. So good stuff there. Here's a quick sort of, I'll do a quick take so the copyright police don't track me down here.
00:07:25.444 - 00:08:04.588, Speaker A: But you can see the Feuillius piece here. A little bit slow to load, as per usual, but you get the idea. So congratulations to Pheosius. So here is our debate of the day. Runetune had a thread, so let's go through this a little bit here. Again, this may take more than one episode to. I may return to this because there's a lot in here to unpack the rise of AI and generative art, the reactions to it, and how the past reflects the present.
00:08:04.588 - 00:08:47.304, Speaker A: A thread. In contemplating the rise of AI generative art, I see a reflection of the past that I don't see talked about enough on Twitter and in pokebelly videos. Well, thank you for watching, first of all, Aruntun, and let's see what Roontoon has to say here. The battle for legitimacy faced by the early abstract expressionists in the 1940s and fifties is much the same as the legitimacy sought by AI and generative artists today. Well, this is probably true. I mean, my first thought is, well, not just the abstract, abstract expressionists, you know, even surrealism wasn't taken seriously for a surprisingly long time. Like, even in the sixties.
00:08:47.304 - 00:09:16.230, Speaker A: Okay. There was a lot of skepticism. Okay. You might be surprised to learn. So almost any art movement worth their salts in the 20th century has fought the legitimacy issue. But I agree in the sense that I think AI and generative art, well, especially AI, which is what we are mostly discussing, artificial intelligence, tool based art. Sure.
00:09:16.230 - 00:10:06.014, Speaker A: Because especially, again, when we see we have to ask ourselves what to make of this, you know, again, in a socratic way, with, you know, is just trying to get to the truth here. The 1940s and fifties reaction, anyone can splatter paint on a surface and make a Jackson Pollock is no different than those who claim that everyone can feed text into a computer, push a button, and make AI art. So, yeah, and if you look at earlier episodes, we have kind of. We've kind of gone full circle on this push a button argument. Like, at first I was thinking, oh, this stuff is being made very quickly. And then you might see the video. More complex than pushing a button and where I'm going, okay, I've tried out the tools, and it's actually harder than it looks.
00:10:06.014 - 00:10:49.340, Speaker A: I still do have concerns, though, when I think I brought up exactly when Orszig is putting out 20 or 30 convincing paintings. I mean, this is just probably yesterday, look, October 3. So I guess that's two days ago. But you see what I'm saying. When they're putting out this many good looking paintings, you do have to wonder about the push a button thing. So my kind of current view to restate it is it seems like it's complex to get to level a, where you can do this kind of thing, but once you figure it out, you can pump this stuff out. He could probably do 50 of these a day.
00:10:49.340 - 00:11:20.576, Speaker A: I'm guessing he can at least do. Or she can at least do 15 or 20. We have seen that on a daily basis here of pretty good looking art. As I said, in an alternative reality, we might think of these as pretty good paintings in the sense of like, they look like almost, you know, classic art history. Okay, so kind of interesting. The pushback to this is, well, if it's that easy, then why don't you go ahead and do it? Go make a pollock or a gan brood. Richard Nadler, Clownvamp.
00:11:20.576 - 00:11:41.968, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. And let's see how successful you are. I agree. As we've pointed out, I'd say on this show, it's not as easy as it looks. I totally agree. But I think I'm still sort of. Of the persuasion that once you kind of get to a certain level, maybe it is, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.
00:11:41.968 - 00:12:26.004, Speaker A: Look at Warhols. I love Warhols, but, I mean, he could get the assistant to do it right once you have that process machine figured out. So, yeah, I don't see it necessarily as being easy to do, as questioning the legitimacy, although I think that does come into it a little bit. So again, these are very kind of complex issues, as I think you're pointing out here. Pollock is not easy to make. Trust me, I've tried the abstract. So, interestingly here, Runetun wants to compare this to the abstract expressionist, the AI movement, which I find kind of.
00:12:26.004 - 00:12:55.684, Speaker A: It's not the first comparison I would think of. Right. The abstract expressionists here, abbreviated as AE, challenged popular notions of art. Their work relied on chance. Now, this existed, you know, chance, I would just add to your point. Sure, true. But chance, I mean, we saw this with the data, with the surrealists.
00:12:55.684 - 00:13:38.294, Speaker A: There is a lot of use of chance. So it is not new with the abstract expressionists. I mean, we see it with John Cage. I mean, most famously the composer, the avant garde composer with 433, which for those, I mean, most of you probably know what 433 is, but four minutes and 33 seconds, where the composer and the orchestra basically does nothing, and the piece is the noise of the audience. Right? So using chants and, you know, Rauschenberg. So I wouldn't say that's new at all, actually, with the abstract expressionists. But I do agree that they use chants.
00:13:38.294 - 00:14:02.554, Speaker A: We'll see. I think I brought up a work here. I did bring up a work, I think, where we're gonna look at exactly. This is Max Ernst using chance. The surrealists use a lot of chance, I would say. So let's just continue, though, here. They used tools that moved away from the traditional brushes and easels of their artistic predecessors.
00:14:02.554 - 00:14:40.200, Speaker A: They manipulated the image in a process that involved physical input, chance, and a reaction to the output, fine tuning the end result as they worked along. Again, I would go back to this late Max Ernst piece. I wonder if we have a date on this Ernst piece, because this is, I think, like forties and fifties. This was a 19. Wow. 1942. And what do you see here? It looks like a hole in the bottom of a paint jar with the paint leaking out.
00:14:40.200 - 00:15:23.634, Speaker A: And then you kind of just, you know, very influential on the abstract expressionists is particularly Pollock. So in a sense, it's kind of always back to Ernst, surprisingly like. I mean, you don't think of Max Ernst as such a titan in 20th century art, but it's just astonishing how much comes back to Ernst. It's very interesting. Let's continue. So, in a similar way, AI artists rely on input, output and chance as the abstract expressionists. According to runetune, abstract expressionism was a movement born of the circumstance of the times.
00:15:23.634 - 00:15:51.504, Speaker A: I think we could say that for most, you know, most art movements. But fair enough, true. There was a palpable political and psychological shift in the United States, and industry was rapidly advancing. I agree with this, although I'd say the pop artists. I mean, it was the rise of the consumer society after World War two, at least. And I think the pop artists actually captured this more than the abstract expressionists. I think that's why they were so quickly.
00:15:51.504 - 00:16:33.184, Speaker A: Once pop came, abstract expressionism kind of went totally out of style, I would argue, because all of a sudden there was an art that people could relate to, an art of the common man or woman or person, rather than a, you know, again, Clement Greenberg, you might know, as like, this high, affluent, high art. Abstract expressionism, I would argue. And we're going to look at a little bit of abstract. Maybe we should look at that now. Let's just finish the comment. Then we're going to look a little bit at some abstract expressionism so we know what we're talking about here, not just words. Okay? Acrylic paint, invented in the 1950s, gave these artists a new medium with new potential.
00:16:33.184 - 00:16:56.408, Speaker A: So let's just take a quick sojourn. Abstract expressionism here. Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and William de Kooning are the painters that are cited here. Exactly. Pollock and Rothko, I think, of immediately. Right. And what's kind of interesting about I find abstract expressionism the New York school.
00:16:56.408 - 00:17:41.314, Speaker A: I went to a show in Rome a couple of years ago called the New York school, and on the other side was the Warhol. They actually paired that really nicely. On the other side of the capitoline museum, there's that really cool museum there, contemporary art museum. So one of the things that I do find, and, like, put it this way, I would be careful to hang your hat on abstract expressionism as a kind of sign of legitimacy, in a sense, like, it obviously is legitimate. And I'm not questioning that. But what I am saying, though, is, from my experience, just personally, the works aren't holding up as well as you might think. Over time, at least as I might have thought.
00:17:41.314 - 00:18:18.974, Speaker A: I keep getting surprised at kind of over time, as I come back to Rothko's and Pollock's, I become less actually impressed. Over time has been my experience with it. And it's not to take away. I mean, this one here is quite beautiful here, this black and white one. But I have to say, I mean, over time, you know, and Clifford still is another guy, you know, over time, I've actually become less impressed with the abstract expressionists. And again, these pictures don't do them justice. And it's interesting what they're doing here.
00:18:18.974 - 00:19:09.734, Speaker A: These are storyless images. It really is about the paint on the canvas and these kind of formal relationships between yellow and texture and the blue purple here. So let's actually read very quickly what abstract expressionism is. According to Wikipedia, is a post World War two art movement in american painting developed in New York City in the 1940s. It was the first specifically american movement to achieve international influence and put New York at the center of the western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. And finally, although the term abstract expressionism. Okay, so they're saying the source, some art critic robert Coates, invented it.
00:19:09.734 - 00:19:45.494, Speaker A: Now, this is also very interesting. I saw this and I was. Yeah. Technically, an important predecessor is surrealism, with its emphasis on spontaneous, automatic, or subconscious creation. Jackson Pollock stripping paintings onto a canvas laid on the floor is a technique that has its roots in the work of Andre Masson, surrealist Max Ernst, and David Alfaro Sequeiros. And again, we see that in this Ernst work here. Semi famous, I mean, 1942.
00:19:45.494 - 00:20:36.258, Speaker A: Right? So just to kind of set the table here a little bit on what we're talking about with abstract expressionism, I believe we looked at. So, you know, here are some abstract expressionist works. You know, this is what Pollock was doing. Like, when was this like? So Ernst was doing it before Pollock, interestingly. And they had a lot of the similar concerns. Like, you could argue surrealism was so important that it actually had two branches, which was abstract expressionism and pop. You know, and I think you could make that argument because the roots of both, in my opinion, you can kind of trace back a lot of their roots in surrealism, as that Wikipedia article was mentioning.
00:20:36.258 - 00:21:16.514, Speaker A: So we're not doing justice to this whole topic, but we're learning along the way here. And we have many episodes to go, hopefully, where we can continue this conversation. Let's finish Rune Thun's point here, though. And there's not too much more. We're almost done. And in this time of rapidly advancing industry, a focal point for many was not only the efficiency of production and distribution made possible by new technology, but also the dissemination of ideas and information. Yeah, so again, we could be talking about, though, this could also apply to the renaissance or with the printing press, this could apply to the Internet, 1990.
00:21:16.514 - 00:21:50.824, Speaker A: But giving the charity of interpretation. Okay, you know, acrylic paint, new technology, dissemination and production and distribution of ideas and information. I'm not exactly sure how this relates exactly to abstract expressionism. Again, I think more pop, which is dealing with mass media and the consumer society. But interesting. Let's continue here. Where's the surrealists before them were concerned with tapping into the subconscious.
00:21:50.824 - 00:22:26.924, Speaker A: The abstract expressionists were more concerned with their processes as a liberating means to exploration. Now, the surrealists, again, were totally concerned with liberation, sexual liberation, just liberation of everything. Did I bring it up? Like, I think I did a search again, this uses. Yeah, let's not go too far here. Okay. Surrealism, liberation. I did a search on that earlier.
00:22:26.924 - 00:23:04.024, Speaker A: And you see here in artsy, surrealism's goal was to liberate thought, language and human experience from the oppressive boundaries of rationalism. Okay, so this is not unique, this liberation, to the abstract expressionists, I think we could say. I mean, the surrealists, it was, I think they felt totally. They were still dealing with this 19th century stuff. I mean, surrealism started what, when it was a surrealist manifesto, I'm guessing, like the early 1920s. Let's quickly look up on this so we know what we're talking about here. Surrealist Manifesto, 1924.
00:23:04.024 - 00:23:28.386, Speaker A: Okay, 1924. So here it is, published in October, 1924. We're almost a century. It's 98 years. Okay, so continuing on, today's AI generative artists are no different. They seek the same creative liberty. I think AI goes beautifully with surrealism.
00:23:28.386 - 00:24:07.914, Speaker A: It's again, surrealism being a natural predecessor to AI. Without question, you could argue all AI works that we've seen, most of them are somewhat surrealist in nature. You know, strange thing, calling himself an AI surrealist, I think that's well put, smartly put. They seek the same creative liberty, reliant on new technology in a process fixed between forethought and spontaneity, between control and the unexpected, with unprecedented levels of production and distribution. Yeah, like, I would say I agree with this. You don't know what's going to come out. Right.
00:24:07.914 - 00:24:55.070, Speaker A: Like, as far as my understanding, you put in your prompt and you start getting images. You can upload images as well. Even then, you don't know what you're going to get out. So in a sense, maybe we're making, here's some new ground for us here. Maybe one way of looking at AI, the AI tool is as a chance machine, a randomization, a randomness machine, a chance machine. Maybe that is a kind of a moving forward here that we've made here, because I think you're onto something here, rune tune. Abstract expressionist artists relied on a sense of internal order to give their power work.
00:24:55.070 - 00:25:23.774, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say it's very formal, kind of stuffy. I'd even go so far as to say, you look at Clement Greenberg, who is the famous art critic, kind of the high priest of the abstract expressionists. It's kind of stuffy. That's why pop probably came, because it was just like, enough. We're seeing the same thing now with contemporary art being pretty stuffy. And then you see nft art, and we're all having fun over here and just enjoying our art. It's a little bit, you know, art for the common person.
00:25:23.774 - 00:26:01.674, Speaker A: Shapes, colors and layers were not simply thrown together to look pretty. There was an internal order to these abstract elements that brought the viewer's emotion and subconscious into the art. Yeah, I mean, put it this way, I'm not so sure I'm convinced by the abstract expressionist project that much over time. Like, if their goal was pathos or some sort of emotional, you know, sublime experience of sorts, which is almost a romantic notion. They're quite romantic, and in that respect, they're almost melodramatic. And you see it in their lives. I mean, Rothko committed suicide.
00:26:01.674 - 00:26:32.282, Speaker A: Did Pollock. I mean, or he drank himself to death, I'm not sure which. Also an untimely end, from my understanding. Yeah. So if I want pathos, I still look at italian Renaissance painting, and I go, that's. You know, you look at Raphael, the deposition at the borges at the. What is it? The Palazzo borges or whatever in Rome.
00:26:32.282 - 00:27:25.670, Speaker A: Go check. You want to see that work? If you want pathos, you know, this is. So I'm kind of back to this idea of, I wouldn't necessarily hang your hat too much on, am I? I wouldn't hang your hat too much on the Borghese, palazzo Borghese, or whatever, like this. I mean, to see this in person, Rafael, is magic, is real world magic. This is at Galleria Borghese in Rome. Like, it's worth the trip. And then go to the barberini, palazzo barberini to see another work, the il Fonorina, and then go to the Vatican to see the transfiguration, a late work, which is just a masterpiece.
00:27:25.670 - 00:28:04.674, Speaker A: I mean, these are some of the greatest art experiences I've ever had. They're simply astonishing. So when I go back and then I see a pollock, it actually in my universe, and we're all just talking from our own viewpoint, or a Rothko, it doesn't measure up. It's nowhere close to the pathos, which is interesting. So, I mean, I think the comparison with abstract expressionism as a way of kind of legitimizing AI might work for the next 50 years. I'm not convinced in 300 years that we're still gonna be seeing the abstract expressionists the way we do. I think we will still appreciate them and we still will recognize them.
00:28:04.674 - 00:28:40.386, Speaker A: I'm not sure they're gonna have. I think they might be a notch lower just like that. Like, nothing too extreme, but just a notch lower in our appreciation. So I think, I mean, we're all sharing our opinions here, and we're gonna wrap this up really quickly here. In his work, abstract expressionism scholar David Anfam writes, ideas of order dominated one standpoint, reflecting a brave new world where the machine, the city, and objects themselves were paramount. Well, again, I think this could be applied to so many art movements. And here's another.
00:28:40.386 - 00:29:18.978, Speaker A: We're almost done here. Em Forster titled Art for Art's sake in Harper's 1939. In there, Forster tackles the concepts and debates that were plaguing the american art at that time and argues that, yes, art should be made for art's sake. Yeah, interesting. A whole other debate, because then it's like, at what point is decoration also art for art's sake? So, yeah, like, for me, I can speak personally as an artist. I see art as a kind of qualitative science, pataphysics, which we haven't dealt with. To me, it's a branch of pataphysics.
00:29:18.978 - 00:29:37.966, Speaker A: It's basically investigating human nature. For me, I mean, people make art for different reasons. This is another thing. It's, again, there's many right answers in art. There are wrong and right answers, but there are many right answers. For me, it's human nature. It's an investigation of human nature and a way of kind of knowing ourselves more.
00:29:37.966 - 00:30:17.274, Speaker A: And that's why I'm so, say, in love with, say, the surrealist tradition dating all the way back to the Marquis de Sade. And you could argue earlier, you know, we could see, you know, they loved Shakespeare and all this stuff. Human nature. When I was studying, when I was doing my master's in english literature at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada, I was asking myself, what is it that I'm studying? I'm reading these novels from way back when. What is it that I'm studying? And I came to a conclusion which, this is the study of the soul. And in atheistic terms, it's the study of the psyche. The same thing.
00:30:17.274 - 00:30:48.434, Speaker A: It is a study of human nature. And that is often the works which we go back to and which stand the test of time. That's why sad, even though they're kind of unreadable. Most of those novels, they still matter because he's cataloging, he's transcribing our darkest obsessions. Okay. And you look at Tom Jones by Henry Fielding, one of the first big important novels of the english language. We should bring up the introduction to Tom Jones when we have more time.
00:30:48.434 - 00:31:23.154, Speaker A: He basically says, this enormous novel is a banquet that we're going to have, and the feast and the food we're going to eat is human nature. That is the subject of our novel, is what Henry. So that's why I'm into it, but I'm not. I think everybody should be able to. People want to like art for art's sake. That's cool, too, depending. And what do we mean by that? So finally, there are the exact same tensions plaguing AI and generative art today, which we haven't even touched, generative art, and we don't have time to today.
00:31:23.154 - 00:31:48.738, Speaker A: Unprecedented productivity and distribution. I'm not sure this is unique to AI and generative art, but we can have that debate. Interesting point. Unprecedented access to information, ideas, and art forms. I think this could be said of any art movement today. Isn't that true? Or again, maybe I don't understand, or. But again, very interesting points here.
00:31:48.738 - 00:32:19.024, Speaker A: Rapidly changing advances in technology. True. I think we could say that about the phone art that rat cloak see is doing and that I'm doing, say, way back when, and I still do, and the ever intractable human viewpoint. So a case for AI by Roentoon. Thank you for sharing that with us. I totally appreciate it. And I think, and he wrote a very nice comment also, like I came up with this thread.
00:32:19.024 - 00:32:50.374, Speaker A: Where was it? As a result of watching your episode. So that was just very, very awesome. That's what I live for. Over here at this program is threads like that that help us just advance this conversation. Again, AI as a randomness machine, a chance machine. I like that a lot. I think we have gone somewhere today, so we may come back to Runetune's thread here over time.
00:32:50.374 - 00:33:12.064, Speaker A: And we also had a comment on it, and then we're going to look at some quick art before we go. It's probably the longest episode by far. Sorry, guys. Using AI makes you more of an artist, not less. The new technology not only widens your creative vision, but also allows you to inspire yourself with your own creative thoughts. This is Curtis Cardwell. It also puts you on the spot as a creative.
00:33:12.064 - 00:33:31.620, Speaker A: That is, if you can create anything, what will you make? Great point. So I totally agree with that. So anyways, let's go quickly through some new works here. We got a new work by uczine. So very cool. Got a little Game Boy down there and a retro monitor flashing cool already at $24.69. Sold out.
00:33:31.620 - 00:33:51.620, Speaker A: Cover your eyes. We got an acid boy has a new work. This seems like a bit of a breakthrough for him, so I'll just quickly go through that. So interesting work. New one by natived. This is a gif I quite like this. Almost has a bit of an op art feel to it.
00:33:51.620 - 00:34:17.832, Speaker A: Edition of 25, only 242 xen. Let's keep going. So Francoise Gamma put out this work and I thought this was just kind of nice and interesting. And it made me think of Jacqueline Humphreys, who I'm going to show you here in a second. Jacqueline Humphreys. So we're full of art references today. Contemporary artist, probably one of my favorites that exists.
00:34:17.832 - 00:34:45.793, Speaker A: And she has these kind of sideways smiling faces. See? Very simple process, reminiscent of Sigmar polka dot, which is randomness underneath with screen printed. Well, not in Polka's case for the most part, but in her case, screen printed pattern over top. Kind of a digital feel made in 2017. This is an I love her work. There aren't many. Here's her and other works.
00:34:45.793 - 00:35:02.302, Speaker A: So shout out to Jacqueline Humphreys. I mean, just very simple, you know, you put randomness underneath. This is Pollock. Sorry, not Pollock. This is Polka for me, who we discussed in an earlier episode. Really cool. You see that for the comments.
00:35:02.302 - 00:35:24.124, Speaker A: I can't remember what you call those. The captcha. So very, very, very cool work. So that Francois Gammer reminded me of Jacqueline Humphries. And here we have our guy popple with a new work combining generative art and his pixel art. So very cool. This kind of alien fetus thing.
00:35:24.124 - 00:35:37.952, Speaker A: Again, kind of a Sci-Fi feel to it. Very cool. Interesting colors. Look how cool this is. Buy for eight tazos. I think that's still on primary. Yeah, you can still get it on primary if you run Edmorola.
00:35:37.952 - 00:36:04.116, Speaker A: I thought I'd bring this up. He put this out and I was just thinking, these are just like the colors. There's something about these colors that these artists are all over. What is this called? Rest exclusive. Airdrop to wallet holders. And of one XTD fake tago dago money by day of this mint, not exactly sure. And a new Lb piece, what goes around, which just seemed to go with a lot of these works here.
00:36:04.116 - 00:36:26.968, Speaker A: Again, a gif, not a video. And finally, a new bzaya work, a one of one we got some mushrooms. Amanita muscaria. Coming out of the head botanic trip. Floral flow is a collection in which I try to connect traditional botanical art with a bit of my salsa. So very, very cool work from bazaya. And there we have it.
00:36:26.968 - 00:36:30.584, Speaker A: Thank you for joining us. Until next time, take care.
