00:00:06.360 - 00:01:08.924, Speaker A: I hope you had a better New Year's than gloom tube. It is 2023, my friends, and we are back. And my name is Adrian Pokebelli and this is Artists journal, my artist journal, January 2, 2023 in Berlin, Germany, broadcasting to the Internet. It's funny, I have to remind myself it is an artist's journal. This is a journal that I share publicly my private thoughts that I share publicly on what is going on, really, actually, just from an artist's perspective. That's why we kind of go everywhere. But my kind of obsession right now, my fascination is with what's going on in the digital art scene, particularly on these crypto blockchains like Tezos and Ethereum, where we are seeing what seems undeniably to be an art movement of some kind.
00:01:08.924 - 00:01:58.684, Speaker A: Like, I mean, again, if you just think of the contemporary art world and if you were to go to all the websites and everything, I mean, I feel like Gloomtube here has captured the zeitgeist. You know, here we have an unhappy face guy throwing his Jack Daniels at the television and, you know, at the news, at what's coming to him from his tv. And I think, you know, at his New Year's party that didn't, you know, that sucked and all this sort of stuff. And so I think gloom tube captures the zeitgeist, the spirit of the times. So anyways, I hope you had a wonderful time. We had a great time. We ate tacos.
00:01:58.684 - 00:02:41.590, Speaker A: I like to keep it simple on New Year's and maybe I was living in, actually, we went out to the street in Berlin. Fireworks are everywhere. And maybe I was living a little bit vicariously through my friend who was at Bergen, who at, his friend was djing at six in the morning on, I guess that would be New Year's Day in the morning. So New Year's Eve night, New Year's Day. And I was thinking to myself, it's January 2. That party probably just wrapped up like they have, from what I understand, they're like three day parties. So I was thinking to myself, Bob, are you still there? I should message Bob, but he's probably going to sleep for the next three days.
00:02:41.590 - 00:03:03.634, Speaker A: Anyways, welcome back, everyone. Let's get into it. So super cool work here. I thought I, at first I thought, is this a retro tv? But it's not. It's a new tv, so, which makes sense, but. So anyways, interesting 2023 balloons, interesting colors. I missed this one because it came out, I think, on like New Year's morning, just command zero.
00:03:03.634 - 00:03:18.914, Speaker A: Let's just see exactly the time. Did he put it out? Yeah. That's cool. 1206 New Year's Day. So that's super cool. So huge fans of Gloomtube. I'm a huge fan of Gloomtube over here.
00:03:18.914 - 00:03:41.474, Speaker A: Trashing the house on New Year's Eve. Going for 39 now. Nice kind of low edition of 15. So a little more collectible. So which is probably why it's already at 39 tezos. So anyways, he keeps it real, doesn't he? I mean, he sells them for twelve, he could sell them for 30, he could make a lot more money. And this is almost something I wanted to say before we move on.
00:03:41.474 - 00:04:19.962, Speaker A: These kind of misanthropic artists tend to be some of the nicest people. You know, gloomtube. And remember, I don't know if you were around, but you know, maybe three or four months ago, he was asking people if they want to collaborate. You know, people like die with the most likes are, they're very nice people. So these, you know, people who have kind of, these brutal, misanthropic kind of themes can sometimes be some the nicest people. And it makes sense because they are sensitive to human nature and all of its foibles and all of its shortcomings. So anyways, we have a lot to go through.
00:04:19.962 - 00:04:39.166, Speaker A: So I went through the process. Rune tune was also going through the process on Twitter there, going through manifold XYZ. I did figure it out. So thank you. Actually, a couple minted. So that's totally awesome. I mean, this, for me, this was something that was on my desk for like six months and it just wasn't working.
00:04:39.166 - 00:04:57.294, Speaker A: Wasn't working. And I basically, I was given a deadline to myself. I was like, fine, I'll do the open edition. And then I kind of worked it out where I was kind of happy enough with it, don't mind it at all. Got some nice comments about it. And so I was pretty happy about it actually, how it worked out. So open edition, there's only two.
00:04:57.294 - 00:05:29.350, Speaker A: So a low edition number. And all to say, there's nothing like a deadline because I was like, okay, this is going to be what I'm going to put out on open edition, but if I don't. But it was the deadline, so it just forced me to finish it. It had to be out by today. To get your manifold XYZ contract in place. Quick thing I want to say if you haven't put out an open edition, is you actually need to get the app like on Manifold XYZ. If you click on apps somewhere.
00:05:29.350 - 00:05:51.434, Speaker A: That's how you do this open edition things. I was trying to figure that out just from setting up the contract, and I don't want to go too deep into that because if you haven't done this, you're going to be kind of lost. But anyways, here it is, Europa. Thanks for the two mints and thanks for the retweets, everybody. The tweet did fairly well, so I was thrilled about that. And shout out to Turkarack for picking up sunset. Huge fan of Turk Rack's work.
00:05:51.434 - 00:06:18.254, Speaker A: It's standing up over the months here as I kind of keep track of Turk rack. That great. Speaking of misanthropic artists, right? I mean, there's a total, what I interpret as misanthropy. And also an anonymous collector who is just buying eight by eight. Eight Bahoo works here, picked up cloud and sunset. So anyways, thrilled to see those go. Thank you for that kind of a quick, huge correction.
00:06:18.254 - 00:06:53.916, Speaker A: So I was talking about this being like a heart, but I was going by memory and I was like, maybe it's like a brain. It kind of looks more like brain. I should do a little more research before I start lecturing on the creation of Adam by Michelangelo. So anyways, I did a little bit of research and it was actually the brain. And I kind of mentioned that in passing and I wasn't. So all to say, I just want to make sure I'm putting out good information out there. So this is the thing is, some people would say that God here in Michelangelo's creation of Adam is reminiscent to the brain here.
00:06:53.916 - 00:07:25.402, Speaker A: And it's kind of a persuasive case. I mean, when you kind of, you know, half close your eyes here, it kind of does look like brain matter a bit. And they were studying anatomy and even just like this, you know. So just kind of an interesting theory here. And you look at the shape here, even at the back, how it kind of has this little, you know, extra area and you kind of see that here. So a very interesting theory. So luckily, the Internet helped me out there.
00:07:25.402 - 00:07:57.532, Speaker A: So a comment from agor NFT from Poland. Shout out. I thought this was super interesting, what he said here that I wanted to share. Last time I analyzed the market and many Tezos blue chips were sold. So ETH whales come to our ecosystem. Who knows? Like perhaps, what do you think about making a q and a video? So, first of all, I get the sense that the nature of the NFT market on tezos is changing a little bit. It's just buzzing.
00:07:57.532 - 00:08:23.086, Speaker A: It's buzzing. There seems to be something happening. I'm calling it the x copy effect or whatever we want to call it, but it seems to be. And it could have nothing to do with that, or maybe partly to do with that. It could also have to do with Tezos being at $0.70. So if you thought about going to Tezos, now is your chance. Like, it is a wonderful time to collect.
00:08:23.086 - 00:08:54.865, Speaker A: And, you know, you can get all sorts of stuff that you basically couldn't afford before because it was three or $4 or $2. I mean, it's kind of crazy how these things go up in price because it multiplies by the Tezos price. So all to say, I think you're onto something agor. There seems to be a change in the market, is what my antennae are saying. If you disagree, feel free to leave a comment. A couple of more just manifold xyzs. There's a lot that came out.
00:08:54.865 - 00:09:32.504, Speaker A: I thought this one was pretty cool. A slightly different mechanism here, burn to redeem. So if you burn this thing, if you burn five of these, you get one of these. The name of the artist, I am not sure, but if you put like a search for burn to redeem or no, at the wrong time, in quotes, I should have found the artist here. But anyways, cool work. And yeah, so that is manifold XYz. So all to say, this is probably in the app, like the, one of those apps, like, there's probably an option of burn to redeem.
00:09:32.504 - 00:09:58.468, Speaker A: So check out the apps on manifold. I'm so glad I finally checked out Manifold XYZ. It was on the to do list for literally six months, maybe longer. So. And also Martin Joe, I believe this is Martin Joe with an open edition quattrato on San Juan de la Frontera. So with the bears in the little Adidas and Fuma. Adios and Fuma.
00:09:58.468 - 00:10:19.924, Speaker A: So anyways, so people are having a lot of fun here, and they're very affordable. Here's another one that kind of caught my eye. Neuster Anfang. So a new beginning in German, drawmama ETH. Faultless moment to outburst. A new energy open edition available for another ten days. And again, very reasonably priced.
00:10:19.924 - 00:10:55.124, Speaker A: So it's fun to do that. And, you know, kind of reminiscent of that artist who we see that does all the mystical works whose name escapes me right now. But anyways, pretty interesting work, all sorts of great stuff. Here's a new discovery for me, portal port a malmar. So with this collage, this is a collage it looks like a digital collage. See this perfect circle here in the gradients? One would think this is a digital collage. Very interesting, if you ask me.
00:10:55.124 - 00:11:19.712, Speaker A: And I think Amelia Versace picked this up for, like, four tazos. She put an offer in. So this is a one of one, by the way. So what is steal and accepted? Okay, so three tezos this went for. So let me show you just a few more. This is probably someone who just started and has maybe not much. There's no Twitter, right? So there's always talent to be discovered here.
00:11:19.712 - 00:11:38.414, Speaker A: So here's. And look at how much they've been putting out. They have eleven pages. So you see, I mean, this is a lesson in the importance of Twitter in terms of, you know, just building your audience. Maybe this video will help out a little bit. So, porta Malmar, here's just some other works. A one of one.
00:11:38.414 - 00:12:04.424, Speaker A: This went for five Emilia Versace. So the secret's out, Amelia. So anyways, just some cool, what looks to me like digital collage, maybe combined with traditional for two tezos. So one of ones. I mean, you can't really do better in terms of buying and, frankly, investing in art when it's that cheap. I put in a bit on this one. This one was really nice.
00:12:04.424 - 00:12:27.888, Speaker A: And again, this looks like digital collage for sure. Really bold, this blue paintbrush, you know, or pencil. And again, this nice combination. It looks like a sun. Beautiful rendition of the body. So, anyways, very interesting artist. And these almost kind of have a similar feel.
00:12:27.888 - 00:12:48.784, Speaker A: We've looked at Rosatio before. Rosaceo, Rosaccio. They have quite a few followers, don't they? 475 30 collectors. And it's really interesting. Rosaceo is doing quite well. Just makes the reserves very low. Like, this reserve seems to be 0.05.
00:12:48.784 - 00:13:24.284, Speaker A: So you can't really complain as a collector. And it's not like you have much to lose. I mean, what is that, like 50 or $60 for a one of one on ethereum of pretty nice work. And let's just take a look at the work, you know, and kind of interesting in what's going on. Again, almost looks like collage or something with this black mask over top and then stuff put on top, you know, again, very collage like feel to it. Pretty beautiful work. And again, you know, available for 21 hours, someone puts a bid in for zero five.
00:13:24.284 - 00:13:44.284, Speaker A: I guess they lowered their amount. But again, it's better to move art. Like, I'm probably going to lower on a bunch of work on super rare just because I'd rather move it. Right. Even if it's going for cheap. You know, that manifold thing might be like two or three people, and that's fine because at least it's moving. It's getting out there.
00:13:44.284 - 00:14:03.904, Speaker A: It's off my desk. Maybe most importantly of all, embracing randomness. Another one. So again, pretty original work, you know, looks great. I think the selling price is really smart. Sold for zero six. Digital collage and digital drawing.
00:14:03.904 - 00:14:29.548, Speaker A: 4000 by 5000. Pretty big resolution. So we've been following villain mask for the last few weeks here, and they have another 10. Gravity instinct. I'm liking the evolution of their work. Villain masks work and kind of has a video game feel to it and. Yeah, like, it's hard for me to place, actually.
00:14:29.548 - 00:14:58.284, Speaker A: I mean, it looks like 3d figures, you know, the crown. Again, video games sort of work, but then almost like textured pencil over here. So just kind of, again, what I'd call pretty original work. And look at this mirror here. And even this, the signpost that's kind of knocked over in this almost surreal landscape. So it's kind of like video games meet surrealism. If I had to kind of summarize what's going on.
00:14:58.284 - 00:15:42.544, Speaker A: Zero gravity instinct. So .2 on foundation. You know, there's a ton of great work on foundation, isn't there? And I think they're a super smart to remove the invite process because look at. I think that's probably why super rare started onboarding so many people in the last couple of months. One of the reasons, another is because there's just so many great artists that weren't on super rare, so is time. But because foundation, like, people are buying on foundation, and you got to love the one day auction, which I think super rare also kind of because they didn't put the auction function in for, like, not till like, last year, I think it's about a year ago, I think, if I remember correctly.
00:15:42.544 - 00:15:58.476, Speaker A: Look at this work by Mimocat. Look at this work by Mimocat. Floating memories 0.1 ETH. So just got a bid. This was listed about a month ago, so I was gone. So I don't think we've showed this yet.
00:15:58.476 - 00:16:33.654, Speaker A: Anyway, it just got a bid. It's pretty like, again, it's kind of memocat meets surrealism. And again, when you come to a new blockchain, sometimes it inspires new work. And when you think that maybe you can get more money for it, it kind of inspires more ambition in the work sometimes too. So beautiful colors and just everything. So just very fun to follow Ezra Eslin, a couple of works in progress as we kind of move into an illustration area. Pretty interesting to see her.
00:16:33.654 - 00:17:01.756, Speaker A: Like, she knows perspective, obviously. Let's work for the first piece of the new year. And it's just interesting how she does things in blue first. Like a real draftsman. Of course, Ezra Eslin is, if you had to ask me, she's out of Istanbul. And if you had to ask me, where is, like, the hottest place for artists right now, it would be hard for me not to say turkey. There are a ton of good artists coming out of turkey.
00:17:01.756 - 00:17:41.098, Speaker A: Haiti, rocket, Sumi Ryusi, Ezra Eslin. And I am missing others. So I'll come back to that. Like, there are a ton of good artists coming out of turkey. So how interesting is that? And I think also Indonesia, you know, like, I think Mimocat might be out of Indonesia, you know. So this is really exciting, you know, and where else are they going to come but through, like, the blockchain? Because it's so hard still to get into these, into the contemporary art world. But anyway, anyways, nice looking draftsmanship.
00:17:41.098 - 00:18:08.114, Speaker A: And on that front, Dana Ulama. And I was going to say, where is she from? She got an iPad pro, and look at how good this is looking. And it's pretty funny. I'm still merging as many layers as I can out of habitat in order to save Ram. That's so funny because anybody that works with, like, an iPhone or a tablet will relate to that. So anyways, looking pretty nice over here. Continuing on.
00:18:08.114 - 00:18:40.464, Speaker A: Now, this is by flo, flosstitanarum flostitanarum, if I can pronounce that right. And this is called ouija ya cusama. This is on super rare. So a pretty interesting illustration, I guess we could call it with. I don't know if we'd call it an illustration. Just, it's not painterly, let's put it that way. It's more in an illustrative camp and just kind of a wild, kind of has a bit of a mystical, almost lotus flower type stuff.
00:18:40.464 - 00:18:59.242, Speaker A: Interesting colors here. It almost has, like a Lewis Osborne kind of feel. Kind of designery, a little bit. There is a ton going on in this thing, actually, the detail, the colored bricks. So it's a gorgeous, gorgeous work. ETH co won it for one ETH. It was interesting.
00:18:59.242 - 00:19:24.274, Speaker A: It was minted on November 11. Someone made a bid right away for 0.5, but the artist stuck to their guns. And then December 31, ETH co picked it up for an ETH. So maybe there's a little lesson there. And let me just see if we can see where this artist is from. Indonesia.
00:19:24.274 - 00:19:57.660, Speaker A: Printmaker and illustrator based in Indonesia. So the so called global south, as people basically are now calling non western parts of the world. We are seeing a really impressive effluence of art coming from the global south. Here's another kind of illustrative work, summer blues. Just a GM to everyone. Happy New Year and have a smashing 2023. So we've looked at summer blues before and I thought that just kind of fit.
00:19:57.660 - 00:20:17.992, Speaker A: Nice. Here's someone that I discovered through Turturrack's collection, kudukula, and kind of has a bit of a turturrack feel to it. Drying program. I thought this was a nice work. And so there's a dryer. And I thought just kind of an original, interesting work. They had a bunch of.
00:20:17.992 - 00:20:36.132, Speaker A: One of ones for like, very cheap. So I picked them up like for a tezos, two tezos, this sort of thing. I think one was ten tazos. But you see right here, this went for a tezos. I think this is gone. But it's sort of like. You can't go wrong picking something up for seventy cents a one of one.
00:20:36.132 - 00:20:57.884, Speaker A: So there's still a lot of gems out there. This is another kind of another lesson in, I guess, for lack of better term marketing and pr. This is a work. I was going through my old bookmarks. This is a work from a year ago, January 24, 2022. And it was in my bookmarks, it was 280. So probably at the time Tazos, it would have been like eight or $10.
00:20:57.884 - 00:21:16.224, Speaker A: Now it's like $2.20 or something. Let's say $2. And I looked and none had sold. None had sold. And I actually thought it was a pretty cool work, like. So I picked it up because I like keyboard kind of synth works.
00:21:16.224 - 00:21:58.244, Speaker A: So anyway, I'm a big fan of this whole kind of. Of this whole theme, I guess, for lack of better word, of synths and computers and people. Basically, the artist at the. We could even call the name of the show, as Sumi put it beautifully in her series modern studios. That's like, you know, this is like a modern studio continuing on. Orkhan Isayev. Sorry, did we get the name of that artist? Let me just see if we can get the name of that artist.
00:21:58.244 - 00:22:34.400, Speaker A: No, it's. Maybe that's part of the problem. And I showed this one on the Christmas show. Now here's another kind of lesson too, which is, you see, after this person didn't sell any, basically till today, like a year later when I picked one up this morning. That's probably why they stopped making art, I'm guessing, or at least posting here. It's like, what's the point if you're, you know, you put out your 15 editions, they're selling, you know, for a pretty reasonable price. You put a lot of work in and nobody picks it up.
00:22:34.400 - 00:23:13.138, Speaker A: So kind of a lesson in, you know, you have to get out. You have to put yourself out there. This person, you kind of got to play the game according to what it wants to a certain degree, in a sense, a lesson in pragmatism. Like this person, they probably should have had a name here, you know, gotten a Tezos name. And. And this is for everybody that's not set up on Tazos. You know, get a Tez profile so that you can have your name and get a twitter, and at least then there is a chance that you'll be discovered other than me, you know, clicking on Christmas and then give them a follow in case they ever post again.
00:23:13.138 - 00:23:48.888, Speaker A: I hope they do. And, yeah, and here they are collecting all this stuff. And, yeah, but you can tell they haven't collected for a while, so hopefully they come back. Orkan isiev so we've looked at a few illustrations, kind of Sci-Fi inspired illustrations by Orkin, and this was another beautiful one GM with kind of a Paris feel to it. And again, kind of has a weird, almost kind of japanese manga Sci-Fi so just a really, really cool artist. Are they on super rare? I feel like, yeah, they are vintage Sci-Fi. That's what they call themselves.
00:23:48.888 - 00:24:27.160, Speaker A: Okay, that sounds about right. Here's some kind of wild, you know, pixelated work here. GM peeps. What I love about this is this kind of takes, like, a comic drawing and completely upends the illustration lines and pixelates them and kind of does it in a pretty bold way that is kind of, for lack of better term, upsetting, you know, like, it's just like, you're not supposed to do that. And I think it works really nicely. So kind of interesting work. And we have another one that's kind of along a similar line.
00:24:27.160 - 00:24:50.814, Speaker A: This is Sophie Agura and this buy for 95. Well, let's see if I can make it bigger. So, just looks like a couple of cartoon anime figures, but again, pixelated. And this time with a little bit of a glitch on it. So pretty interesting Christmas gift. So this was given to their. To their collectors, I assume.
00:24:50.814 - 00:25:10.246, Speaker A: And you can see some of their other work here. So maybe a little glitched out there. I think we've seen this one before. So, yeah. Interesting, interesting. Give them a follow. And continuing on up, this was just a cool pixel work by.
00:25:10.246 - 00:25:51.866, Speaker A: I think this is Ripkash, who we were looking at the other day, who does the. Does the cameras here, and who sells for, like, a fortune, I think might have gotten, if I had to theorize, I think might have gotten the x copy blessing a few months ago, and now they sell for, like, a huge amount of money, this person's work. So this is Ripcache here, I thought, just a beautiful kind of pixel artwork of a surveillance camera. You can tell that's a big theme here. Huge shout out to the legend x copy art. Congrats on your winning bid and on acquiring my latest one of one platform. So this is something you can just ride into the sunset in this scene you see, it's April 18, 2022.
00:25:51.866 - 00:26:16.930, Speaker A: They're probably pretty wise to just leave that posted up because that is just great pressure for this artist when the first time you come to rip Cash's page, he has gotten the x copy blessing. Continuing on. Stalomere. We have looked at Stalamere before. Let me just show you. Remember this guy with a really strange but cool pixel art. So here is more from Stalamere.
00:26:16.930 - 00:26:39.096, Speaker A: It looks like a kebab kitchen or restaurant in Berlin, frankly. This is, like, typical stalamir. Where is Stalomere based? Ancient alien. Akhtunga inter. Probably out of Germany, if I had to guess. They have foundation and object. So, again, this is their object.
00:26:39.096 - 00:27:09.364, Speaker A: Give them a follow. Continuing on. So this is interesting. So Edmarola and I think Ilay, as we're gonna see in the next tab here, made this kind of rainbow, or at least this is based on. This is a sample from an ilay piece that we actually looked at before here. So, anyways, let's just play a bit of the music. Dream all colors sound in pixel.
00:27:09.364 - 00:28:22.680, Speaker A: What I find kind of interesting about this is this isn't like our rebirth of the single category, where you're seeing kind of clear songs, where the art is almost secondary, whereas here, the art, the music, seems to be a supplement to the art. It's almost like the music is an atmospheric that is designed to heighten your aesthetic appreciation of the art. So kind of turning that kind of rebirth of the single idea on its head a little bit from my perspective. And if we go here, this is really cool. So Ed Marolla tweets out his process on this, and it's actually super interesting to all you pixel artists out there and everybody else, frankly. Look at this. So he used, Eduardo Pulitzer used some of ilay's prism sky glitch, which we have looked at, right? And you might even recognize these colors here.
00:28:22.680 - 00:28:40.774, Speaker A: Two was. It was sampled by the artist to create this exciting rainbow sound in pixel. Tego dago dream. Thank you so much. So Ed Marolla chimes in, and let me show you how I make it. Step one, scale the image down so each pixel is one color. Okay.
00:28:40.774 - 00:29:03.810, Speaker A: Step two, sample the image in a brush set using the ultra useful Benz brush add on to ace aseprite. So there's some alpha for you. Ultra useful Benz brush add on. So this does not come with aseprite. There's add ons. I didn't know you could have add ons in aseprite. I've only kind of touch and go with aseprite.
00:29:03.810 - 00:29:31.292, Speaker A: Seriously, if you like pixel art, you need this set brush size, create brush set. So it seems like a way of making brushes. So here's that. Step three, draw using your new brush so you see that kind of sampled brush look. But then he starts adding some more blur and jumble. Blur and jumble to make delicious textures. So you see, Ed moral is pretty.
00:29:31.292 - 00:29:52.924, Speaker A: Again, this is bold. Just like that anime was kind of bold in that it would just pixelate anime line work. A great contrast. You could argue here, like, this is bold, because most people would be like, oh, that doesn't look great. But it's like, it's not about that. It's about the contrast and just creating different textures. And it does look good once you understand.
00:29:52.924 - 00:30:10.926, Speaker A: Now, continuing on, but let's say you don't like the fog. Like, Ed Marolla reveals how he does it. Add dither for final touches. And there you have it. Don't tell anyone this. I'm sorry, guys. I'm sorry.
00:30:10.926 - 00:30:23.342, Speaker A: I just. I just saw that. Don't tell anyone this. It's top secret. It's brilliant. Okay, we'll move on very quickly here. Sorry, guys, but, I mean, if you're gonna post it on Twitter, folks like me are just like.
00:30:23.342 - 00:30:37.594, Speaker A: And it's fascinating. And, yeah, all good. Okay, bite by bit. Ilay picked this one up. A very nice work by bite by bit. A few more nebulas. So this went for ten.
00:30:37.594 - 00:30:55.914, Speaker A: And I picked this one up. A nebula planet pixel vela Junior nebula. So I just kind of never get tired of these. And a one of one cool pixel artwork for, you know, five or six. $7, I guess, $7 no one's complaining. This one's still available. Boomerang Nebula.
00:30:55.914 - 00:31:17.874, Speaker A: So anyways, a very. I continue to love that series. Continuing on. Just a couple of works by mech Txt on Twitter and so wishing everybody a good time. Very nice sunset. So he'll often kind of preview what's coming up on Twitter. And here was another interesting one.
00:31:17.874 - 00:31:27.714, Speaker A: Last day of the year. I wonder how many tacos I ate in 2022. Looking forward for more tacos in 2023. Me too. We had tacos. I think I mentioned that. And they're delicious.
00:31:27.714 - 00:31:57.740, Speaker A: Shout out to my girlfriend, popple sent out a happy new year to everybody. Hand drawn pixel art and just a nice happy new year. Happy 2023 by popple. So very cool little animation. Very nicely done, by the way. And then the meteor creates the three happy. So a very nice card of sorts, isn't it? Happy new year to popple.
00:31:57.740 - 00:32:32.204, Speaker A: Thank you popple. A few from Tom Bombadil. So just reading the news here with a different figure. I love what's going on up here. And I also love just like the very simple pixel art, like just like the square in the background, like say the way he does the shadow, the shadows here on the jacket and in the background, just that kind of checkerboard shadows. Very simple. Here's a couple more bizarre as in a market.
00:32:32.204 - 00:32:55.176, Speaker A: And let's just make that bigger. So again, just kind of interesting and cool. Looks like some arab writing there. Ancient lighthouse. This is the most recent. And again, I just love the shading here. And look at the clouds, like these purple clouds just done with that checkerboard, you know, pixel brush.
00:32:55.176 - 00:33:09.000, Speaker A: So anyways, very interesting. This was interesting too. Stairwave by iteration. These were gorgeous. Maybe some of you saw this. Look at this. It's so cheap too.
00:33:09.000 - 00:33:38.574, Speaker A: Zero, zero, seven ETH. Ten of ten sold out. Look how beautiful that is. I don't know if this is AI or not, but whatever it is, it's gorgeous. Maybe it says nothing here, but we do have the Twitter and artist and they are on object. Let's just find, do a quick search here and created. Yeah, so they do a lot of vaporwave type stuff.
00:33:38.574 - 00:33:55.450, Speaker A: So not too much information here. Hard to say. But this stairwave series is beautiful. Maybe they call it stairwave because it's like vaporwave kind of colors here. So here's another one. There are four. So very nice.
00:33:55.450 - 00:34:16.614, Speaker A: And again, selling for very cheap, which is pretty cool. Here's another one. Stairwave two. And again, it's tempting to see this as AI isn't it, but I don't know. And here is stairwave one open edition. So I think this one was free. Okay, so that's also pretty cool.
00:34:16.614 - 00:34:51.124, Speaker A: And we'll see how many were minted for free. But again, good looking work. 342 minted. So if you want your work to get out there, you can always do a free mint. Cool painting from rare to end the year, I want to believe is the name of the work. So again, playing with the Boston dynamics dog, and this time, kind of like playing off the whole motif of the cow being zapped up by the UFO's. So anyways, looking good from rare as usual.
00:34:51.124 - 00:35:17.192, Speaker A: And thanks. I think rare tweeted out, check out the pokebelly's artist journal. And I'm tweeting this just to tell you, just to show you that I don't just tweet the ones that I'm in. So anyway, shout out to rare. Thank you. Rick Austenbrook. I thought this was just an interesting abstract, isn't it? Kind of like an airbrushy abstract? I think we've seen their work before.
00:35:17.192 - 00:35:34.014, Speaker A: But here's another reminder. Rick Austenbrook colors since zero four clients. Porsche, apple, Taylor Swift. They're on super rare. Let's just take a quick look. I think we've been here before, my friends. Let's just see.
00:35:34.014 - 00:35:57.678, Speaker A: Digital artists from Netherlands, famous for his bold color use and new ways to create abstraction. Creating digitally and analog since zero six, so has some pretty major clients. Wow, look at this. 20 ETH, 15 ETH. I mean, $24,000, $54,000. So this is probably a year ago. 12,000.
00:35:57.678 - 00:36:13.154, Speaker A: $91,000. That must have been. Let's just look at the date on that. Holy geez. May 6, 2022. So that is this year, right? Or I should say last year now. But this is during the bear.
00:36:13.154 - 00:36:35.184, Speaker A: Wow. So good for Rick. Doing very well for an abstract work. Selling for 34 ETH or $91,000. Pretty impressive walk. Put out an auction and my beautiful dark twisted fantasy fantasy digital artwork. And this is a one of one.
00:36:35.184 - 00:36:56.336, Speaker A: And this went for 50. So in the trademark kinda noise blur, blurred out style. So very cool work. Always curious to know what the originals are. I'm still trying to figure out. I know the painting that previous work that he did. Again, let me just quickly, quickly bring that up.
00:36:56.336 - 00:37:18.028, Speaker A: If it hopefully doesn't create any problems here. If anybody. I feel like I totally know the colors of this artwork. If anybody knows this artwork, do let me know some. Looks like new work from Joanne. I already feel 2023 will be an epic year for all of us. Who's with me? I totally agree.
00:37:18.028 - 00:37:52.298, Speaker A: I'm totally inspired and motivated to work like never before. So I hope you're feeling the same. So shout out to Joanne and look at this beautiful AI and painting work I was using a lot of mid journey. I started like, if you subscribe to mid journey, you can upload an image. So you know, and there's a whole like user's manual with midjourney. So if you're just kind of randomly putting stuff in like I was, it kinda is worth looking at that stuff. A little bit of alpha on the AI front.
00:37:52.298 - 00:38:42.106, Speaker A: And the more I work with AI, and I'm starting to a lot more because it's something you can do just as you're going to bed on discord, as you're just putting prompts into mid journey on Discord. The more I look at it, the more I totally respect AI. And I'm like, this is totally a real art form. And we're kind of stating the obvious at this point, but my point is the more you use it, the more you realize, like in a sense, beware of say, doing what I did at the start, which is don't start commenting too much on whether this is legitimate or not before using it. You really appreciate what people are doing here once you start trying to make things. So here's another one beyonder who I've never seen before. Building worlds.
00:38:42.106 - 00:39:16.310, Speaker A: AI personality. So you see this, the AI personality of Hawken. So this is probably just for their AI art. Interesting, right? Another really nice piece here. This is by Cana. And they have just a really cool, like if you put in, you can make some really cool computers on mid journey, for instance, I don't know how this one was made, but seems to be clearly AI here. So anyways, pretty impressive.
00:39:16.310 - 00:39:54.582, Speaker A: Interesting work. And this buddha on the screen, Martin Joe again with some very cool AI work here. And just kind of like cushions turning into bodies or something like that. Just very interesting. Kind of reminiscent distantly to Varya in its kind of like high resolution look and bodies kind of morphine and whatever, but totally its own thing here. So very interesting work in the kinky Bears spy for three edition of ten. Always back to Marina Amidova, who's putting out a ton of work.
00:39:54.582 - 00:40:13.230, Speaker A: Here's just another one of what I want to call the twins series. I think she calls it the bright reflections collection. So anyways, let's just take a quick look. Nice work there. Yeah, look at these. Pretty reasonably priced some. I mean, 850 for edition of 15.
00:40:13.230 - 00:40:35.170, Speaker A: Let's just. Am I following a lot of, a lot of people I follow on Twitter and who. I was just noticing that. So anyways, there's still some very nice works to get here for pretty reasonable prices. And let's just see, like, how much did this one of one go for? Let's see. Let's just look here. 100 tazos, which is $70 for AI.
00:40:35.170 - 00:40:50.814, Speaker A: One of one. I mean, not bad, I would say. Not bad. Mister shapeless is making a ton of work in the last week here. So interesting landscapes. Almost has a Pieter Bruegel type feel to it. Almost.
00:40:50.814 - 00:41:22.176, Speaker A: So again, playing with these shapes in the sky, we have a few look at this, too. Trying to think of the painter that this one reminds me of. But anyways, and these fabulous clouds here. So some really nice work being posted to Twitter. Again, this kind of has a Bruegel feel to it, doesn't it? The kind of snow, you know, winter scene, but totally different. So interesting. And one more, I think good night from Mister Shapeless.
00:41:22.176 - 00:41:55.600, Speaker A: So again, look at how much, like, once you find your thing in AI, you can really go far with it, which is kind of fun, you know, like, these people are putting out, like, tons of work like Mister shapeless. Let's just look at the date. December 30, December 31. December 30, December 31. You see where I'm going with this? Like, once you get your thing, it's just like, you can crank it out. Seemingly demon ego. So some physical work here, GM.
00:41:55.600 - 00:42:34.850, Speaker A: Have a great Sunday. So just some nice work to look at here. I'm not sure if that's new or not. And again, I'm pretty sure demon ego said that they work physically also. Kind of a nice message here. When I abandoned the order, sterility, ornament, and aesthetic values determined by others, my works became more liberated, and the more they were free, the more diverse they became. And to me, this speaks to a really interesting part of making art, which is kind of your head game while you're making stuff, because sometimes you can make stuff where you're just trying to make it look good and acceptable as your other works.
00:42:34.850 - 00:43:14.524, Speaker A: And other times, you can be totally creative and willing to just push and cross boundaries. So it's kind of fun. Usually that makes ten times better work, right? So I kind of like this. To me, this speaks to the head game of being an artist and how it's better to be free and not worry about stuff and take risks and actually have an experimental mindset. We have another work here from Demon Ego what I created in 2022. So I feel like they could call their series what I created in 2022. And they have all these beautiful, abstract works at Demon ego, and it's kind of different from the other work.
00:43:14.524 - 00:43:28.244, Speaker A: And we've been kind of posting or following a few of these on this show. And that, my friends, is the show. Thank you for watching, and I hope you had a great start to the new year. And until next time, take care.
