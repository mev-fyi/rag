00:00:03.480 - 00:00:43.644, Speaker A: The relationship between art and technology is vast and deep, whether it was the innovation of oil painting in the Renaissance or portable tubes of paint for the impressionists. Today we're going to discuss new tools artists are using to push their art to new heights. Artist journal, May 31, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show Rune tune Roon. How is your week going?
00:00:46.064 - 00:01:02.712, Speaker B: It's great to be here again. My week was very, very busy. We threw a party at my, at my apartment for the Memorial Day weekend. But it was a lot of fun and I feel like I'm just catching up on all the sleep that I needed.
00:01:02.888 - 00:01:18.124, Speaker A: Well, that sounds like a ton of fun. I kind of wish I was there, you know? I have a friend that invited me over to New York. I didn't have somewhere to stay. I couldn't, and I was so busy. I have to find a new apartment and everything. But that sounds like that would have been worth checking out.
00:01:19.384 - 00:01:23.732, Speaker B: Oh, it was a lot of fun and I would have loved to have had you there. How was Munich?
00:01:23.788 - 00:01:52.098, Speaker A: Oh, Munich, Bavaria. There's a lot of beer. There is a lot of sausage. So my older brother turned 50, and his best friend from high school also turned 50. So they kind of wanted to do something special. So his friend Carl, my brother's friend, lives outside of Munich at a place called Geisenfeld, 8000 people or so. And he turned his whole backyard into a beer garden, basically.
00:01:52.098 - 00:02:02.578, Speaker A: So it was pretty awesome. There's 60 people there. We spent the weekend there and then I actually spent the week there and a few of us spent the week. And so we went to Munich a few times. I love Munich.
00:02:02.666 - 00:02:05.974, Speaker C: I mean, it's so different from Berlin.
00:02:06.514 - 00:02:19.792, Speaker A: I mean, it's just classy, you know, like, berlin's cool, but it's not very classy, you know? And so, yeah, I loved it. It was a great break and, you know, a great break. Before I start looking aggressively for a.
00:02:19.808 - 00:02:21.832, Speaker C: New apartment, when do you have to.
00:02:21.848 - 00:02:23.164, Speaker B: Have a new apartment for?
00:02:24.344 - 00:02:47.842, Speaker A: So it's July 23. July 23. So it's coming up, you know, so in about a little less than two months. I mean, I already have some leads, which is great. And then there's the whole, yeah, it's a complicated business out here. The whole apartment stuff, you know, not to go too deep in the weeds, but, you know, the landlord pretending to move back in when he's not moving back in. But who knows? Maybe he is, but probably not.
00:02:47.842 - 00:02:58.666, Speaker A: And all that sort of stuff. There's a lot of kind of, you know, dotting the I's and crossing the t's, shall we say, that needs to be done over here. So I have to basically assume that.
00:02:58.690 - 00:03:02.042, Speaker C: I have to move out here, and I will. So.
00:03:02.098 - 00:03:12.814, Speaker A: And I'm kind of looking forward to it. You know, I've been in this place for four years now, so I'm kind of looking forward to just a new neighborhood, a new, you know, just a new space.
00:03:14.214 - 00:03:19.758, Speaker B: Yeah. And I mean, exciting. That'll be an interesting change. I'm curious to see what the background.
00:03:19.806 - 00:03:33.754, Speaker A: Looks like on your. I mean, let's see. I may need to do the green screen or something, and we'll put a nice. Put Mars for the background or something. So how are things going with you? So you had a big party. Was there a reason for the party?
00:03:35.214 - 00:03:37.462, Speaker B: No, it's really just, you know, we.
00:03:37.478 - 00:03:39.786, Speaker C: Have the days off, and, I mean.
00:03:39.810 - 00:03:50.266, Speaker B: It'S kind of a forlorn holiday to be partying, but regardless, if the government gives us time off, we're going to take advantage of it. So that was really. That was really the only reason.
00:03:50.370 - 00:03:54.010, Speaker A: And how does a party work in New York? Like, how did you work it?
00:03:54.042 - 00:03:54.794, Speaker B: Did you.
00:03:54.954 - 00:03:59.534, Speaker A: Did you have people over for dinner? Or was it something later on? How'd you structure it?
00:04:00.354 - 00:04:16.830, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, I'm fortunate. I'm one of the few in Brooklyn to have a backyard that I don't share with other tenants. So me and my girlfriend just invited a bunch of people over. I have a grill back there. I have a projector. We just projected. Oh, it was so much fun.
00:04:16.830 - 00:04:44.998, Speaker B: We projected Barbarella, and then we projected after that, this movie called Afterblue, which came out maybe four, maybe four or five years ago, and kind of continuing on into this, like, space themed, female led cast sort of movie. Very colorful, very visual, highly recommend for anyone looking for something weird to watch.
00:04:45.046 - 00:04:49.070, Speaker C: That's also kind of funny. Yeah.
00:04:49.102 - 00:04:55.558, Speaker B: And then just people came over whenever they were available, and I had the grill going, had a bunch of bratwursts, you know.
00:04:55.686 - 00:04:56.958, Speaker A: Oh, great food.
00:04:57.006 - 00:04:58.326, Speaker C: Yeah. Tons of fun.
00:04:58.430 - 00:05:28.426, Speaker A: So maybe a similar thing. I mean, just finally on the. On the Munich trip, I mean, it was beer and sausage, and I think the most kind of exotic meal we had was the vine verst or, sorry, the vice verst, which is like this traditional bavarian meal where you have a white sausage. That's the vice, and the versed is the sausage. And then what else do you have with it then? You have beer, and this is breakfast. And what was the other thing that.
00:05:28.450 - 00:05:30.640, Speaker C: You have with it now?
00:05:30.672 - 00:06:00.278, Speaker A: It's escaping me, but maybe a bit of cheese. And then what else? It's escaping me, but that was the most exotic thing. Maybe I'll look this up here anyway. So let's get to our show here and welcome everybody who has joined us here on this, what I hope will be a really interesting show. I hope to learn more than anything from what other people are using. Again, recently, like in a recent show, people were mentioning touch designer. I had never even heard of that.
00:06:00.406 - 00:06:02.166, Speaker C: So I don't know.
00:06:02.190 - 00:06:04.438, Speaker A: Had you heard of that rintoon?
00:06:04.606 - 00:06:07.278, Speaker B: No, I still don't really quite understand it.
00:06:07.446 - 00:06:11.486, Speaker A: Yeah, I've never tried it, so. And here it is. It's a pretzel.
00:06:11.590 - 00:06:13.238, Speaker C: Of course. How could I forget?
00:06:13.286 - 00:06:47.618, Speaker A: It's the missing ingredient in the vice versa is the pretzel and the mustard. But, yeah, I haven't heard of touch designer either, but it looks pretty awesome. And sometimes, tell me if this rings true for you, and I imagine it does, but you tell me the technology can really, it really can impact your art. I mean, it kind of provides you with a set of variables, in a sense, and then you start to work with those variables that you're given, and without those variables, you're not going to make that kind of art. I mean, does that ring true for you?
00:06:47.746 - 00:06:56.634, Speaker B: Oh, 100%. I mean, it's the choice. To use a certain tool is like a form of communication in and of itself.
00:06:57.894 - 00:07:28.548, Speaker A: Beautifully put, beautifully put. It's almost like, in a weird way, like, I mean, if we were to use an app as, like our, you know, a tool, it's in a weird way, they almost become like mediums unto themselves. It's sort of like oil paint. You can work a certain way, maybe you can put certain, you know, things that you mix in with it, maybe you mix in sand and all this sort of thing. But in a weird way, with digital tools, I mean, it's all the digital art medium.
00:07:28.676 - 00:07:29.628, Speaker C: It's all digital.
00:07:29.756 - 00:07:33.436, Speaker A: So technically, we'd say that's the medium. But almost, in a weird sort of.
00:07:33.460 - 00:07:36.604, Speaker C: Way, each app kind of has its.
00:07:36.644 - 00:07:43.364, Speaker A: Own, almost becomes in itself a kind of, for lack of better term, sub medium. Help me out here. Does that make any sense to you?
00:07:43.404 - 00:07:45.276, Speaker D: Yeah, I mean, each app has its.
00:07:45.300 - 00:08:02.984, Speaker B: Own workflow, which makes you do different things. Like, for instance, I go back and forth between Photoshop and procreate all the time for various reasons, but there's just certain things I wouldn't want to do on Photoshop just because of the workflow that I would choose procreate over.
00:08:03.644 - 00:08:34.152, Speaker A: That's really interesting. And it kind of speaks to. Yeah, it speaks to how I work as well. Like, all use the phone for most of my digital brush work, so to speak. Like if I'm like making digital brush strokes, I'd say it's the phone or the pencil and the tablet. But to your point, almost invariably at some point in that process, will Photoshop enter the picture and further edits will be done. And the mark making I make with my finger.
00:08:34.152 - 00:08:47.134, Speaker A: And this is slightly different, of course, from the actual apps we're using, but, you know, working. I mean, it's worth mentioning though, is these different hardwares also impacts what comes out.
00:08:48.914 - 00:08:54.414, Speaker B: Yeah, 100%. I don't know if you've experienced this, but sometimes.
00:08:55.274 - 00:08:58.890, Speaker C: Oh, like when you turn your frames.
00:08:58.962 - 00:09:01.186, Speaker B: Of whatever you're working on into a.
00:09:01.210 - 00:09:01.774, Speaker C: GiF.
00:09:04.254 - 00:09:06.270, Speaker B: Depending on which app you're using.
00:09:06.422 - 00:09:08.034, Speaker C: The GiF will look different.
00:09:08.654 - 00:09:20.874, Speaker B: And sometimes what I like to do is deploy my GiF through different things, either through procreate Photoshop, or I forget the name of it, I just have it on a bookmark.
00:09:21.254 - 00:09:25.354, Speaker C: Some, there's this, maybe aceprite.
00:09:26.574 - 00:09:31.950, Speaker B: It wasn't aseprite, it's some website where you can just load things. But anyways, the GIF will look different.
00:09:32.022 - 00:09:34.590, Speaker C: Depending on what you're using.
00:09:34.742 - 00:09:41.614, Speaker B: That is, sometimes it can be different in a good way, other times it does things in a bad way, or.
00:09:41.654 - 00:09:43.074, Speaker C: In just a different way.
00:09:43.494 - 00:09:56.858, Speaker B: I noticed that procreate doesn't always hold true to all the colors where Photoshop does. But one thing that I like about procreate is sometimes it creates these textural.
00:09:56.946 - 00:10:01.534, Speaker C: Elements that were never there before you deployed it as a GiF.
00:10:02.154 - 00:10:03.226, Speaker A: Oh, interesting.
00:10:03.290 - 00:10:06.054, Speaker B: It's almost like this kind of like moving pixelation.
00:10:06.874 - 00:10:13.154, Speaker A: Interesting. So is it almost like artifacts, might we call it? Or like a weird kind of compression, do you think?
00:10:13.274 - 00:10:20.294, Speaker B: Yeah, I think it has something to do with compression, but it ends up looking really fantastic sometimes.
00:10:20.594 - 00:10:31.244, Speaker A: Gosh, that is so cool. And so your recent work then, was that mostly made? If I had to guess, I would say mostly in procreate with some photoshop.
00:10:32.024 - 00:10:39.576, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it was a variety of tools used there because the original image is like a painting that I.
00:10:39.600 - 00:10:41.200, Speaker C: Made with various mediums.
00:10:41.232 - 00:10:44.164, Speaker B: I used a lot of those, like street art markers.
00:10:44.744 - 00:10:45.680, Speaker C: Oh, cool.
00:10:45.792 - 00:10:46.208, Speaker B: Crank.
00:10:46.256 - 00:10:49.444, Speaker A: And so in procreate?
00:10:50.104 - 00:11:15.898, Speaker B: No, no, this was physical. And then I took a photograph of it, loaded it to procreate. And, you know, used the eraser tool. It made some backgrounds, and I actually had to send it to Photoshop, each frame to Photoshop because procreate doesn't hold on to the colors very well. And that piece was all about the color. It was all about the bright, you know, very vivid pink, very vivid yellow.
00:11:15.946 - 00:11:19.272, Speaker C: So, yeah, I think that's why I.
00:11:19.288 - 00:11:41.888, Speaker A: Loved it so much. I mean, I looked at the composition, too, and I kept on finding new things, which I also liked. But I think, like, as I sometimes like to say, probably other people have said it too. You know, the magic in painting is in the color. Like, that's where the real 100%, right where. And it's just instantaneous. And I totally echo what you say about your own sense of the work.
00:11:41.888 - 00:12:07.444, Speaker A: The color was actually, for me as well, the. The grand slam, so to speak, in the work. Like it was. Yeah, I loved it as well. So I hear you. And just on that note, before we start talking about sort of newer software and anybody out there, if you want to come join the conversation, just put a request to speak. Otherwise I will continue to prank people and send invites out to the stage.
00:12:07.444 - 00:12:19.724, Speaker A: What was I going to ask you here, rune toon? What was I going to ask you? It escapes me. Unfortunately, it escapes me.
00:12:19.884 - 00:12:21.144, Speaker C: Something about color.
00:12:22.004 - 00:12:45.914, Speaker A: Yeah, I guess. How long did it take you to make. This isn't what I was going to ask you, but just speak a little bit. I remember the question, how did this come about then, this whole color situation? Were you experimenting? And all of a sudden it just. Sometimes you, like, know, make a hide a layer and all of a sudden everything looks different. Or you put multiply on it and all of a sudden you get magical color. How did you come across it?
00:12:47.014 - 00:12:48.662, Speaker C: I mean, I. This.
00:12:48.718 - 00:12:59.246, Speaker B: The painting itself was something from a while ago. I can't remember how long that took me, but it probably took me about a week or less. But the edits that I did, it.
00:12:59.270 - 00:13:04.370, Speaker C: Took maybe like two or three days, you know, very.
00:13:04.482 - 00:13:05.578, Speaker B: Was. It was pretty fast.
00:13:05.626 - 00:13:07.242, Speaker C: I mean, it was. It was.
00:13:07.298 - 00:13:10.466, Speaker B: Yeah, it was mostly just me experimenting because a lot of the work that.
00:13:10.490 - 00:13:12.706, Speaker C: I have been doing and the stuff.
00:13:12.730 - 00:13:22.042, Speaker B: That I'm kind of engaged in right now are like these longer term projects. And I just wanted to play around and do something that was really quick. And it turned out nice.
00:13:22.138 - 00:13:23.418, Speaker C: I was happy with it.
00:13:23.586 - 00:13:33.536, Speaker A: I love. I love how you're working quick, too. I mean, working quick is like, again, like, it's kind of a paradoxical. It can turn out better sometimes.
00:13:33.680 - 00:13:35.544, Speaker B: I 100% I agree.
00:13:35.664 - 00:13:36.056, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:36.120 - 00:14:01.394, Speaker A: And it's weird. Like, I had to really go there the hard way. I had to learn the hard way on working fast, you know? And it's just so satisfying too. I mean, you feel like just. Yeah, it's a great experience. So. So tell me then, I mean, in your experience, rune tune, have you been picking up new art tools at all along the way? I mean, is procreate the most recent, or have you been adding stuff, checking stuff out? What are you checking out these days?
00:14:01.934 - 00:14:27.502, Speaker B: Well, I picked up this old JVC camcorder that I used to have. I probably got it around the year, like 2005 or four, something like that. And so I've been playing with that. I did a piece a while back, an open edition on object, where I used my really nice camera, my Fujifilm, to capture the background.
00:14:27.558 - 00:14:28.750, Speaker C: And so I've been.
00:14:28.822 - 00:14:46.194, Speaker B: It was, oh, man, it's been so much fun. After work, I'll get out and I'll bring my tripod, I'll bring the JVC, and I'll try and capture, like, street corners with just like, the little subtleties of light changing and stuff like that to make some loop that I could do a little animation over.
00:14:46.494 - 00:14:47.206, Speaker C: And it's.
00:14:47.310 - 00:14:50.434, Speaker B: That whole process in and of itself is really fun.
00:14:52.094 - 00:14:53.958, Speaker C: You know, I have a little bit.
00:14:53.966 - 00:15:00.598, Speaker B: Of a photography background, so it's fun for me to go out there and instead of shooting photos, do these, these.
00:15:00.646 - 00:15:04.110, Speaker C: Little, like, these little recordings.
00:15:04.302 - 00:15:14.974, Speaker B: I can't wait to. I need to clear up space on my computer, unfortunately, because loading these frames into Photoshop or into, you know, the.
00:15:15.014 - 00:15:17.714, Speaker C: Apps can take a lot of space.
00:15:18.144 - 00:15:22.324, Speaker B: So unfortunately, I need to spend time clearing some stuff on my computer.
00:15:23.984 - 00:15:35.404, Speaker A: It is a challenge working with these old, like, in a sense, what I love about what you're saying is your new app is actually an old JVC camcorder from 2005.
00:15:35.984 - 00:15:41.056, Speaker B: Yeah. All these people got me thinking about retro tools and retro aesthetics.
00:15:41.120 - 00:15:43.576, Speaker C: And so I thought about that camera.
00:15:43.600 - 00:15:49.100, Speaker B: And I was like, I wonder if it still works. So I checked it out. It sure enough, it still works. And it's a lot of fun to use.
00:15:49.292 - 00:16:07.756, Speaker A: Well, it's almost like they're, you know, to use like a musical analogy, they're almost like filters, right? I mean, maybe it's not. You don't even need the musical analogy. Like, they are filters of a certain kind. Like, you can make whatever work you want, and then you just put your JVC, you know, camcorder on it, and all of a sudden it, like, it's a different mix.
00:16:07.940 - 00:16:12.104, Speaker B: You know, it absolutely is a filter, and I feel like a lot of.
00:16:12.164 - 00:16:14.568, Speaker C: There's, like, a huge, you know, film.
00:16:14.616 - 00:16:24.184, Speaker B: Photography is hugely popular in New York, and I feel like half the reason it's so popular is because people do want that, like, you know, that filter effect.
00:16:24.304 - 00:16:26.768, Speaker C: More or less the way that film.
00:16:26.856 - 00:16:32.364, Speaker B: Treats the subject is gonna be so different from a really nice digital camera.
00:16:33.144 - 00:16:56.994, Speaker A: Totally. And just on the subject of, like, using this and incorporating it into your process, you're mentioning space, like, it's easier than it sounds. Like. How do you go about getting something? I guess the battery is dead at this point, and you plug it in. And how do you get that image from an old camcorder onto your computer?
00:16:58.494 - 00:17:33.332, Speaker B: Well, there's places in New York that will scan it for you, but I have yet to mess with it. But there's an app, and then there's this plugin that you can use to basically, what is it? It's basically just like, a USB cord that plugs in with, like, on one side and then plug into your computer on the other side. So, basically, I would plug my camcorder into this device, and then there's an app that I still need to download it. I'm in the process of just, like, gathering a bunch of footage right now.
00:17:33.468 - 00:17:39.530, Speaker C: But I'll be able to just record the. Or play this straight into my computer.
00:17:39.642 - 00:17:43.014, Speaker A: Cool. Okay, so you have to kind of be close to a laptop.
00:17:43.394 - 00:17:44.914, Speaker C: Yeah, totally.
00:17:44.994 - 00:17:50.058, Speaker A: Totally. Interesting. Retro Manny, welcome to the stage. It's great to see you here.
00:17:50.226 - 00:17:51.374, Speaker C: Welcome to the show.
00:17:53.114 - 00:17:55.090, Speaker E: Thanks for having me, Adrian.
00:17:55.282 - 00:17:56.794, Speaker C: I heard you're going to prank people.
00:17:56.874 - 00:18:28.654, Speaker A: And, yeah, I appreciate I have pranked you. I pranked a few people. Everybody check your little notification on the Twitter app here I am sending out little apps. So, anyways, tell me this is really an open conversation for everybody, because I imagine you never know. Tell us yourself, Retro Manny. What are the tools you're using right now? Are there any new, exciting things you're trying out? And that can be AI? It can be whatever you want.
00:18:29.944 - 00:18:35.280, Speaker E: You know, I still haven't really got around to using AI. I've played that a little bit, but.
00:18:35.392 - 00:18:38.720, Speaker C: I think recently, the whole pixel art.
00:18:38.752 - 00:18:50.944, Speaker E: Thing has just taken. Just taking me on a whole new journey. And I would call without sort of bragging, I'd say I'm a pretty pro at using Photoshop. We've been using it for, like, what.
00:18:51.064 - 00:18:54.844, Speaker C: 25 years or so, and trying to.
00:18:54.884 - 00:19:17.876, Speaker E: Understand how to make pixel art in Photoshop was a whole new ballgame. The amount of new, but the steep learning curve was intense. And I've got a group of all, of all pixel artists that I'm kind of really looking up to and so glad that they're in a DM group with me, and I've just been asking questions and just learning from them just.
00:19:17.940 - 00:19:21.152, Speaker C: What a different approach you've got to take.
00:19:21.328 - 00:19:29.800, Speaker E: So, yeah, so Photoshop and after effects, just trying to understand how to use pixel art with those. Probably my newest tool, same tools, but.
00:19:29.872 - 00:19:32.884, Speaker C: Just a whole new aspect of them.
00:19:33.424 - 00:19:56.554, Speaker A: Well, I would think that would be incredibly difficult. I found. I think I tried when I first started doing some pixel art stuff with Photoshop as well. I watched a couple of YouTube things just to, you know, canvas size, all that sort of stuff. It's really difficult, though. I guess it's all about the setup. But I found it was much more easy to just actually find pixel art apps.
00:19:56.674 - 00:19:58.770, Speaker C: There are two that stand out.
00:19:58.802 - 00:20:04.682, Speaker A: Esprit, of course, is a very well known one. But again, I like to work on the tablet a lot, so I don't.
00:20:04.698 - 00:20:06.002, Speaker C: Know if, you know, Pixaki.
00:20:06.138 - 00:20:17.354, Speaker A: P I x a K I. I love that app. It's, like, beautiful, very simple, and doesn't get much pressure in a sense. Have you ever considered using, like, ace braid or something like that?
00:20:17.894 - 00:20:18.246, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:20:18.270 - 00:20:30.734, Speaker E: So Pixaky brave was talking to me about that and quite lucky, again to be in a group with Brave. And he's been. I've been seeing his progress and how he puts pieces together. I don't have an iPad, so I believe that's iPad.
00:20:30.854 - 00:20:32.678, Speaker C: But I do have aseprite.
00:20:32.846 - 00:20:44.118, Speaker E: My daughter's a huge pixel art fan, and she's been doing pixel art way longer than me. So I recently bought her aseprite. She was using the online app called Pixil.
00:20:44.206 - 00:20:48.374, Speaker C: R P I x I L. So.
00:20:48.414 - 00:21:00.798, Speaker E: Yeah, she's on there, but I found that. Well, I guess it depends. So it might be a question for you guys. It's a tool. Photoshop is a tool I'm really familiar with, and I know how to bring.
00:21:00.846 - 00:21:03.830, Speaker C: In other techniques that I know, like.
00:21:03.862 - 00:21:17.542, Speaker E: How to manipulate blending modes and use effects and things like that, and how to push it to its limits. So I felt comfortable using that to learn. But as I was doing it, I started to think I might have been better off using something else.
00:21:17.598 - 00:21:19.686, Speaker C: But it was kind of.
00:21:19.830 - 00:21:21.914, Speaker E: I was already halfway down the road.
00:21:22.214 - 00:21:24.302, Speaker C: To creating what I was doing, so.
00:21:24.318 - 00:21:32.234, Speaker E: It was too late to turn back. But I think if I ever do another piece, it will definitely be an ace bright, because that is. That is very promising what I've seen of it.
00:21:34.294 - 00:21:50.124, Speaker B: Sometimes it's all about the. The thing that, you know, how to use. You know, like, I find myself using Photoshop when probably I shouldn't be using Photoshop, but it's just, it's available, it's there. I know it's ins and outs, and that's. That's all I need.
00:21:50.824 - 00:22:26.468, Speaker A: I'm a. I'm a huge proponent of not spending too much time in the technical, like, kind of figuring stuff out. Like, that is something like, I tried to make techno and I was like a big goa trance like aficionado. Crazily enough, back in the late nineties. And, you know, I spent so much of my time trying to connect my Juno 106 to my XP 80 and then getting everything working. I think I literally spent like six years of my life trying to connect things together. And, you know, maybe today I'll get it working.
00:22:26.468 - 00:22:35.780, Speaker A: And then after that, then I started some website that's trying to make this tabloid a kind of weird echo of what I'm doing now. And I was doing this in like.
00:22:35.812 - 00:22:38.340, Speaker C: 2006, and then I was trying to.
00:22:38.372 - 00:23:31.376, Speaker A: Do stuff like, I literally created a PHP website using Dreamweaver. But what in effect, I ended up doing is spent five years, and then at the end, I figured out how to put comments on a post that nobody ever commented on. So to your point, aruntoon, and I think it's a really good little parable here I am all about not getting lost in the technical stuff. I'm actually curious. I'm going to ask Retro Manny in a second how he sets up pixel art, because I think it's all about how you do that in Photoshop, how you do the setup. But once I started hitting these weird things, like how to get the square to fit the grid and not just be even just to make a square brush in Photoshop, you'd think it was like a default, but I don't think it is. And all of a sudden, that was taking ten minutes.
00:23:31.376 - 00:23:47.284, Speaker A: So then I was like, okay, what apps are out there? And that's when I learned about aseprite and Pixaki, which I'm a huge fan of. But that is iPad. Retro Manny, as far as the setup, then, for pixel art in Photoshop, is there a special setup that you do.
00:23:47.744 - 00:23:48.984, Speaker C: If you want to share?
00:23:49.144 - 00:24:10.424, Speaker E: Yeah, no, of course. Of course I'll share. I see pixel dreams down there who might be able to call out where I'm going wrong here. But the way I set it up was, you know, how it's normally bicubic, I believe, the way it deals with the pixels. You've got to set it to nearest neighbor in their preferences. Yeah. So, yeah, nearest neighbor.
00:24:10.424 - 00:24:19.512, Speaker E: You've got to set the grid up so you can have a visual grid. You don't have to use it, but it's helpful to have a visual grid of a one pixel by one pixel grid.
00:24:19.688 - 00:24:25.798, Speaker C: But I think the biggest problem for me was being a painter and someone.
00:24:25.846 - 00:24:31.954, Speaker E: Who likes to use brushstrokes was the canvas size.
00:24:32.254 - 00:24:38.134, Speaker C: So you need to set the canvas size up to the right size.
00:24:38.174 - 00:25:06.796, Speaker E: So I actually looked up the resolution of the old super Nintendo games and I created for those resolutions, but then I transferred those to a larger canvas afterwards. And there's a reason why I did that. And someone in the audience is probably thinking there's no need to do that. But there was a reason why I did that. I think it was to make it so that I could transfer it into after effects without, without an issue. And then in after effects, you have.
00:25:06.820 - 00:25:09.172, Speaker C: To set each layer in.
00:25:09.228 - 00:25:18.104, Speaker E: You have to right click a layer and say quality draft. Otherwise it tries to blur the lines, it tries to correct for you.
00:25:20.444 - 00:25:20.756, Speaker C: And.
00:25:20.780 - 00:25:34.904, Speaker E: Then you've got to export the render. So you've got to make sure when you render it that you also render it out as draft quality. Otherwise, again, it's going to try and correct it for you. So you're constantly trying to fight against the way its system is trying to improve your images.
00:25:35.644 - 00:26:16.892, Speaker A: Well, you know, I love what you're talking about because again, it's like, it was like me again, trying to start this PHP website using Dreamweaver instead of just embracing a WordPress or whatever it was. Blogger back then, you know how they have don't fight the fed in finance, don't fight the Federal Reserve, just do like if they're easing, then buy stocks. If they're tightening, then sell your stocks and stay in cash. Well, my statement is, don't fight the web. If the web wants you to work a certain way, and I was talking about designing websites, sites and all that sort of stuff, then do it the way they want you to do it rather than fighting it.
00:26:16.908 - 00:26:19.012, Speaker C: Now, in your case, maybe you come.
00:26:19.028 - 00:26:32.064, Speaker A: Across a whole bunch of happy accidents, but I just feel like, yeah, that just totally, I kind of love what you're doing though, at the same time. And I could see it actually develop, you know, bringing about different results.
00:26:33.484 - 00:26:35.924, Speaker C: Well, you know, it's what I tend.
00:26:35.964 - 00:26:44.730, Speaker E: To do and I don't, anyone else out there is like this, but I like to follow tutorials, and I was a web designer back in the day, so I know exactly what you're talking.
00:26:44.762 - 00:26:47.466, Speaker C: About, by the way, but I like.
00:26:47.490 - 00:26:54.218, Speaker E: To follow tutorials, but every time they ask me to do something, once I've got a little bit of a grasp of it, I'll go, what if I do this?
00:26:54.306 - 00:26:56.074, Speaker C: What if I do that and you.
00:26:56.114 - 00:27:13.694, Speaker E: Kind of break it as you go along? But that's part of being an artist, I guess. But at the same time, I think, you know, you've got to. I do like to look at what other people are doing, and I know with this whole trope of, you know.
00:27:13.734 - 00:27:15.902, Speaker C: Don'T compare yourself to others, but I.
00:27:15.918 - 00:27:25.798, Speaker E: Think when you're trying to do something new, you want to see if you're within that genre and you're kind of obeying by the rules of the genre, and then when you try to break.
00:27:25.846 - 00:27:28.486, Speaker C: Them, you actually know why you're doing it.
00:27:28.590 - 00:27:39.736, Speaker E: So when I was in the process of making what I was making, I was constantly having to check back a lot of my inspirations, and, like, I had a whole mood board, and. And I'd start to realize I was.
00:27:39.760 - 00:27:42.320, Speaker C: Veering off into making it look, I.
00:27:42.352 - 00:27:46.324, Speaker E: Think, in my opinion, far too painterly. So I had to bring it back.
00:27:47.464 - 00:27:48.064, Speaker C: And I just.
00:27:48.104 - 00:28:17.424, Speaker E: Yeah, I found that as a process. But I know, you know, you got Ed Marolla down there who does an amazing job of blending both the painting, the painterly, and the pixel art. So I think it's probably, for me, it's a learning curve, and I'm new to it, so I don't understand it well enough to veer away from it yet. So I was really trying to stick to the rules and particularly looking at old games as well, playing a few roms as well, and just getting the old snes out and just making sure.
00:28:17.464 - 00:28:23.756, Speaker C: I'm within the parameters. And then I think if I do more of it, I can.
00:28:23.920 - 00:28:25.156, Speaker E: I can mess around with it and.
00:28:25.180 - 00:28:28.104, Speaker C: Start experimenting more beautiful.
00:28:28.444 - 00:28:30.404, Speaker B: That whole process sounds like it's just.
00:28:30.444 - 00:28:33.276, Speaker C: A lot of fun. You know, you're talking about having a.
00:28:33.300 - 00:28:35.412, Speaker B: Mood board, getting the, you know, super.
00:28:35.468 - 00:28:42.036, Speaker C: Nintendo out, like, that just sounds like so much fun. Yeah, it was.
00:28:42.220 - 00:29:01.664, Speaker E: It's something that I was really. I absolutely love pixel art. It's my whole childhood. And, hey, I'm called retro Manny, right? So everything I do is about eighties and nineties culture, particularly in gaming. But I was very fearful of dishonoring what I come to love, almost like I'd built it up too much in my head.
00:29:02.724 - 00:29:04.836, Speaker C: So it was fun, but it was.
00:29:04.860 - 00:29:10.264, Speaker E: Also a little bit scary. But, yeah, you're right. I did try and make it as enjoyable as possible, and it was a lot of fun.
00:29:10.684 - 00:29:18.300, Speaker B: Is there? So now that you've basically mastered the pixel art in Photoshop, like, looking back.
00:29:18.372 - 00:29:25.424, Speaker C: Would you have, would you have chosen to use Photoshop? No.
00:29:27.964 - 00:29:31.564, Speaker E: Although I had a lot of really good, happy accidents with blending modes.
00:29:31.604 - 00:29:37.076, Speaker C: So that is what I love about Photoshop, is sometimes you can just put.
00:29:37.100 - 00:29:44.944, Speaker E: On a curve adjustment layer and then mess around with some blending modes, and it's like, oh, yeah, yeah, I know what I'm doing. It's totally by accident.
00:29:45.804 - 00:29:50.856, Speaker B: So that's what I do love. Are you familiar with some of the other apps? Like, I haven't used them, like Ace.
00:29:50.880 - 00:29:54.844, Speaker C: Bright or anything like that. Have you, have you used those as well?
00:29:55.384 - 00:30:07.808, Speaker E: Like I said, I've only watched my daughter mess around with it, and I've seen her mess around. Well, she's really good at using Pix, the app called Pixel Art, which is like an online web app, but I've.
00:30:07.856 - 00:30:14.676, Speaker C: Not really ventured into it. I mean, maybe you found things that.
00:30:14.700 - 00:30:15.932, Speaker B: You can do with pixel art and.
00:30:15.948 - 00:30:21.664, Speaker C: Photoshop that are just hard to do or wouldn't likely be done in those other apps.
00:30:23.804 - 00:30:26.224, Speaker E: That's a good point, actually. That is a good point.
00:30:26.844 - 00:30:43.152, Speaker A: Maybe you should download the beta. Have you downloaded the beta yet to Photoshop? Retro Manny, like, you can get it. I just downloaded it today for this conversation. I was like, let's see if it works. And it does amazingly. All that generative art. Have you seen all that stuff?
00:30:43.248 - 00:30:44.536, Speaker C: Do you know what I'm talking about?
00:30:44.640 - 00:31:23.554, Speaker E: Yeah, I don't think. I can't go anywhere on Instagram without seeing that tutorial. Yeah, so everybody's making tutorials or not tutorials, but, like, test videos of what that does. So, yeah, I definitely know about it, and it's gonna completely change the game. I mean, that's insane because my first collection was all photo bashing. So it's photos I took and then really going in detail to get it to look right, and then I've seen what the generative fill can do. I'm thinking, man, firstly, it kind of renders stock, Adobe stock, at least, useless, in my opinion, from what I've seen.
00:31:23.554 - 00:31:35.790, Speaker E: And it also renders just all of the tiny little details that you've got to put in to make things blend in. Just seems to render that useless. You can just do it so quickly. But I haven't tested it yet.
00:31:35.902 - 00:31:38.046, Speaker C: I will definitely need to get around to testing it.
00:31:38.230 - 00:32:12.594, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, what was my magic moment? My first sort of generative fill that worked. And maybe the only one that actually worked properly that I was impressed with was taking a LinkedIn photo of some business guy. And then, you know how they're often kind of cropped at the shoulder and then you just have the profile, but maybe you need more of it if you have, like a widescreen shot. And so I just kind of like, put the selection tool around the areas that were basically missing and, like, within a second. I mean, there it is. So, I mean, it was pretty impressive in that respect.
00:32:12.594 - 00:32:41.804, Speaker A: I mean. Cause that's just like a classic sort of graphic design problem you might have. So I was pretty impressed with that. And just as we were saying, I mean, and how fascinating would it be? I mean, you may. You may get paid off here. There may be a payoff, is what I'm trying to say, doing pixel art in Photoshop. Because all of a sudden, if you have your pixel artwork, what happens if you start using the generative fill to start filling in the blanks? I mean, that sounds very promising.
00:32:44.384 - 00:32:45.696, Speaker E: You know what it does.
00:32:45.800 - 00:32:46.288, Speaker C: It does.
00:32:46.336 - 00:32:54.756, Speaker E: And I am by no means anti AI art. I mean, definitely, really, it's come a long way and I'm really support it.
00:32:54.780 - 00:33:02.596, Speaker C: But there's something about the process of actually me doing it that I'm not.
00:33:02.620 - 00:33:14.148, Speaker E: Sure if I'm willing to let go of it yet. Like me actually going in and knowing that I did it from scratch, however long it may take. And I guess that's kind of my.
00:33:14.196 - 00:33:19.324, Speaker C: Age and my old ways, I guess, but.
00:33:19.904 - 00:33:31.024, Speaker E: Yeah, I'm not sure yet. I'm not sure how I'll take it, but I know there's loads of reasons, and I'm not bashing it whatsoever, but I'm just saying my own process, I feel like I want to be responsible.
00:33:31.064 - 00:33:36.324, Speaker C: For as much as possible, if that makes sense. I totally relate to that, man.
00:33:37.464 - 00:33:56.408, Speaker A: I almost want to call it like a nostalgia for the real, you know, to use, like, to almost venture back into all that whole simulation. Discussion. Discussion. Because I agree, too. There's a certain sense that there's a weird kind of. And again, like we. Maybe it's a function of age, maybe.
00:33:56.408 - 00:34:10.896, Speaker A: I don't think it is, though. There's a weird sort of authenticity. I almost want to say that you made it rather than AI. I mean, I'm using AI. Mostly. I am using it. It has become a crucial part of my process.
00:34:10.896 - 00:34:40.724, Speaker A: A bunch of stuff I haven't released really? But for brush strokes, like, I put these, you know, my favorite thing to do are magnified brush strokes. And I used to use samples, and then I'd treat them, you know, sample a basquiat or something and have it so zoomed in that you don't really. You can't even, you know, really tell what it's from. And so I'm able to, you know, create new brush strokes using AI and then zoom in and do my whole process. And it's just so much fun.
00:34:42.293 - 00:34:45.213, Speaker C: So, weirdly, I'd almost say it is.
00:34:45.253 - 00:35:08.732, Speaker A: Still AI, but it doesn't feel as bad. But I know exactly what you're talking about. It's almost like the more it's incorporated, the more it's responsible for the work. You wonder, I mean, the biases, maybe that when it's not a fair word here, but I guess the concern that artists have is, does it cheapen it? I said it.
00:35:08.788 - 00:35:09.420, Speaker C: I said it.
00:35:09.492 - 00:35:11.584, Speaker A: I mean, and I love AI art, by the way.
00:35:13.404 - 00:36:01.918, Speaker B: For me, what Manny's saying, when I'm working on a piece, I often know exactly where I want to take it. And I was playing with the beta yesterday. I'm reworking this animation, and I quickly realized it just wasn't going to work for me. It might work for a still image, but it was not going to do, do what I needed it to do, frame by frame by frame, and do it exactly the way I needed it to do. And then I started playing with some still images of my work and trying to get it to cooperate with that, and I just, like, hated it. But then I pulled out this photograph that my girlfriend took when she was in Costa Rica that she wanted me a while back. This was like an old photo at the time.
00:36:01.918 - 00:36:15.694, Speaker B: She wanted me to continue the photo to make it vertical because it was like landscape mode, and it was this photo of part of her body underwater, and then what was not seen was the part of her body above water.
00:36:17.194 - 00:36:17.626, Speaker F: She.
00:36:17.690 - 00:36:30.658, Speaker B: She's used to seeing me, like, fix, like, shadows and eyelashes for, and it usually takes me, like, two to three minutes to do these fixes for, but when she asked me to do that, I was like, I don't think you understand. I don't think that's going to work.
00:36:30.746 - 00:36:33.248, Speaker C: So I. I thought of that photo.
00:36:33.376 - 00:36:40.136, Speaker B: Brought it out, and the generative feel when it's not my work, I love the AI. When it's my work, I hate it.
00:36:40.160 - 00:36:42.124, Speaker C: I can't use it. Doesn't work.
00:36:42.824 - 00:36:44.896, Speaker A: That is hilarious. And so it worked.
00:36:45.000 - 00:36:46.056, Speaker C: You loved it?
00:36:46.240 - 00:36:50.924, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, it worked. I mean, it worked enough for me to be like, this will make her happy, and she was happy.
00:36:51.344 - 00:36:58.962, Speaker A: Well, I mean, again, it's like almost like graphic design. It's going to be like, as far as, like a digital agency, like, you.
00:36:58.978 - 00:37:01.250, Speaker C: Know, if there's any business that is.
00:37:01.282 - 00:37:21.658, Speaker A: Going to be completely turned upside down, I'd argue already by AI, it is the advertising business because 100%, like copywriting, right? I mean, what happens if you're a copywriter right now? Like, I mean, at best, you got to hope that you're a good editor so that you can take the AI and like, and again, like, it's not as easy as it sounds, all this.
00:37:21.706 - 00:37:24.362, Speaker C: Stuff, but geez, you know, if you.
00:37:24.378 - 00:37:47.662, Speaker A: Want copy for your website, you know, just kind of nice copy, and then you like, again, like, it's not like a necessarily a finished product and, you know, but you have a good editor there and you can kind of get a good product way faster. And then it's the same thing with these visual tools. So, I mean, advertising agencies, you're going to be able to have one person advertising agencies, you know, quite possibly, you.
00:37:47.678 - 00:38:41.814, Speaker B: Know, it has me thinking again about this phenomenon that's happened because of nfts, which is all these people who are art enthusiasts and primarily collectors turned artists because of the ease of use of AI tools. And I'm thinking about that over and over. Every time I think about different jobs being affected by these AI tools and what retro Manny was saying about just maybe it's his age or this old school need to control, like, every part of the work, you know, it's. I find that it's the people who don't really necessarily have, like, this lifelong connection to working with, like, paint or markers or whatever, who have the. The best success with AI tools because they don't have that need to control every single little aspect of the, of the image.
00:38:42.914 - 00:39:10.506, Speaker A: Yeah, very, very true. And, yeah, I could totally see that. So welcome, everybody. Come join us on stage. What tools are you using? Are you using something we haven't mentioned? I'm sure all sorts of people. I've sent an invite to Santiago and Edmurola and Sabato and all sorts of wonderful artists and martin Jo and Renny Fish. Tell us what you're using, if you would like.
00:39:10.570 - 00:39:13.402, Speaker C: If you're close to a phone, it.
00:39:13.418 - 00:40:06.956, Speaker A: Would be fascinating to hear. And there's PP and everybody, so welcome everybody on stage. So other than that, I mean, yeah, like, I mean, as far as your Santiago has joined us on stage, I was just going to say, other than Photoshop, you know, I kind of stick to my tools, you know, and I like to get to know a few tools really well. So I think, you know, it's always tempting to go out and jump on the next shiny object, but it's nice to get to know a few tools really, really well. Like, I like Sketchbook pro a lot for the iPhone, and I think it's on the iPad, too. But I'll use Pixaki on the iPad, and then I'll use Photoshop on the laptop. So it's quite interesting how even each hardware kind of has its own software that kind of works the best, at least for me.
00:40:06.956 - 00:40:10.252, Speaker A: Santiago, welcome to the show. It's great to have you back.
00:40:10.388 - 00:40:12.704, Speaker G: How are you? How are you doing today?
00:40:13.294 - 00:40:13.974, Speaker A: I am doing.
00:40:14.014 - 00:40:15.526, Speaker G: I'm so glad to be here.
00:40:15.590 - 00:40:16.354, Speaker B: Welcome.
00:40:16.894 - 00:40:47.704, Speaker A: Well, I gotta say, santiago, as my girlfriend corrected me, who's from Bolivia, she's like, it's Santiago, not Santiago. You know, your spaces that we did, I think, was the most listened to spaces. I couldn't believe my eyes. I mean, 1200 people listened to that space in, like, 48 hours or whatever it was. I mean, that was a new all time high. So a real testament to you there, Santiago, and all the friends you've made along the way.
00:40:48.564 - 00:40:50.984, Speaker G: That's beautiful. I didn't know that.
00:40:51.884 - 00:40:52.500, Speaker B: Yes.
00:40:52.612 - 00:40:53.704, Speaker G: I'm happy.
00:40:54.084 - 00:41:12.358, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm happy, too. That was great. We really got some reach there. So tell us, I mean, you're such a huge experimenter. I'm so thrilled you came up on stage here. Tell us, what new apps are you using? You've even made, like, your own apps using chat GPT to create software. I mean, tell us, what's.
00:41:12.358 - 00:41:14.794, Speaker A: What are you experimenting with these days?
00:41:15.734 - 00:41:25.354, Speaker G: Yeah, so I started doing those painting tools for myself, using P five G's.
00:41:26.054 - 00:41:32.246, Speaker C: With some help from chat GTP in.
00:41:32.270 - 00:42:02.794, Speaker G: The last part, for example, the one that you dropped something from the desktop or from the web, it was more like watching Daniel Schiffman and making the box and then using chat HTTP to put that in order. So I think that as soon as you are typing something and copying and pasting, you are basically doing what coders already do, even if it's not that complex in my case.
00:42:03.804 - 00:42:42.324, Speaker A: Well, that is a very interesting thing. I mean, I think I saw there's some address that the Nvidia CEO made, and of course, Nvidia is all the talk of the town right now. And he gave some, what do you call it, at college in somewhere, I think in Asia. He was giving this address and he was saying that basically like, everyone's a coder now. And, you know, and I just, you know, I have a friend who's unemployed and she's like, yeah. And I was like, I sent her that and she was looking at going into coding. I was like, maybe she go into AI, you know, prompt engineering and all this stuff.
00:42:42.944 - 00:43:42.388, Speaker G: Yeah, it's very fun and cool. I also see that the things I do understand, I can get HTTP to code the things I don't understand, at least a bit. I have no clue how to ask or what to do, but about art tools. Okay, so I am a blender user for now 13 years. And I have learned so slowly that anyone who's around in this space and has been a couple of months knows a lot more than me. And I tried things, but within a very limited universe of things I control. And I was into Zbrush for a while and it was hard for me to get.
00:43:42.388 - 00:44:20.972, Speaker G: I will never pay a license for software. So crash, I had to crack it and my computers weren't always good. So when a new computer started with me, it's computer life and relationship. Getting crash again was a pain, but. So blender integrated all the sculpting on a big part of what Zbrush could do. So it's just blender for that side. And about now.
00:44:20.972 - 00:44:22.684, Speaker G: Now, I'm sorry.
00:44:22.844 - 00:44:26.956, Speaker A: Well, yeah, yeah, keep going, keep going. Then I have a question for you.
00:44:27.140 - 00:44:43.804, Speaker G: Yeah, about now, now I'm doing those things with p five. That's with the help of chat HTTP, some that integrate the camera, the web camera of my laptop.
00:44:44.664 - 00:44:59.400, Speaker A: Very cool. Okay, so I have a few questions for you, and just quickly. So I've actually never used blender because it looks like a 3d sculpting tool of some kind. Is that what it is? And yeah, I could imagine how.
00:44:59.472 - 00:45:42.414, Speaker G: Oh, it's. That would be computer generated images, I guess, or also volumes now that we have so much VR around. But I think they use it like for medical scanning. It's used for a wide range of things because it's a very powerful tool and I am a very good witness because that story I was telling, my territory of real domain on blender is tiny. And I see every day how, how wide it is.
00:45:44.074 - 00:45:50.010, Speaker A: Fascinating. And as far as this other one, Siraj. What? I've never even heard of Siraj.
00:45:50.042 - 00:45:51.874, Speaker B: How do you spell? Yeah, I'm not familiar with that.
00:45:51.914 - 00:46:25.440, Speaker G: It's sit, seat, the last letter of the Alphabet and brush. It's a brush in the C coordinate. So as you have x and y. It's called C rush because you paint in space. It would be, it's a sculpting tool, as there's many. There's one that's nomad, that is for mobile and tablets and also web that you start with a ball and you start sculpting out and in of the ball. So that was the main interface of C rush.
00:46:25.440 - 00:47:01.544, Speaker G: And I guess there's still crash artists. But as Blender is free and has a great community of people teaching each other and has, I think, like 25 years of history, I will do the googling as you guys continue speaking later. But a blender is old, as it integrated that bold sculpting thing. I don't know, I think it's great and crush. Maybe it's not that much in the spotlight.
00:47:02.164 - 00:47:04.700, Speaker E: Blender is really, really user friendly as.
00:47:04.732 - 00:47:07.140, Speaker C: Well, compared to zebra, from what I've found.
00:47:07.212 - 00:47:10.264, Speaker E: Blender's really making a lot of strides, isn't it?
00:47:12.844 - 00:47:15.124, Speaker A: So you use blender then. Retro mania.
00:47:15.164 - 00:47:16.424, Speaker C: Sorry, go ahead, Santiago.
00:47:17.964 - 00:47:21.872, Speaker G: Oh, I was going to say yes, yes. Retraumani, I think.
00:47:21.968 - 00:47:24.328, Speaker C: Yeah, awesome.
00:47:24.376 - 00:47:48.256, Speaker A: And just one quick follow up here on the P five. So is this JavaScript that, right, these are like when you make your own little. So what are the just like, I mean, I could probably like Google this, but it probably would be harder to like what, how does that work? Like, do you make an HTML file and then you upload it? Is that the idea to object?
00:47:48.360 - 00:48:46.694, Speaker G: Yeah. So P five G's is a library on top of JavaScript, if I am correct, and you have an index HTML, and it refers to the script that is going to be a dot J's. But there's also in this case, P five G's turned to be now like the main communication tool for the processing foundation. So they have a web editor that is super intuitive and has already an index HTML that refers to the script. Most people that are just learning V five are on the web editor working directly on the J's file. So what, you code and you see the outcome live.
00:48:47.294 - 00:48:54.754, Speaker A: Okay, so you go into chatsheept then and say, create me an interface using, you know, with this library.
00:48:55.854 - 00:48:57.234, Speaker C: With the p five.
00:48:57.774 - 00:49:27.112, Speaker G: Yeah. In fact, if I give a piece of p five cs script, or a whole script being a short one, and I ask, fix that, fix this, it will detect very easily that it is p five GS. But if I want to start from scratch, I could tell Chat CDb, please make a very simple drawing tool that the brushes have this or that characteristic interesting.
00:49:27.168 - 00:49:30.960, Speaker A: And then, so it'll give you code, and then you'll put that into an.
00:49:30.992 - 00:49:33.816, Speaker C: HTML file, is that.
00:49:33.960 - 00:49:46.396, Speaker G: No, I just copy the code, and I can paste it in the p five cs.org web editor, and I will see immediately the output.
00:49:46.540 - 00:49:57.264, Speaker A: And how do you get it up into, if you don't mind me asking? I'm asking you to reveal all your secrets here, Santiago, on the app. So you don't need to answer any of this. But then how would you get to object?
00:49:58.444 - 00:51:14.484, Speaker G: No, it's great that you asked me because I'm the most basic code person, so I'm close yet to explaining it to others. That is, as an outsider as me. So, in fact, these files that you get in the web editor, if you would click download it, would make a little zip. And inside the zip, the things that will be there is the script and the index HTML. And if you make folders with images for your script and call them inside the script, it will also include that in the, in the zip. And I think that not so long ago, I have some things that I would have to decompress and change a bit the shape of the folder, because there was, like, one more layer of folder, one less, I think object was taking directly the files inside the zip code. And this zip downloader from the p five GS.org
00:51:14.484 - 00:51:27.424, Speaker G: has one folder where the things inside. So that's the only thing I have to change. But when I started minting this, that was, like, October 2021.
00:51:27.764 - 00:51:28.544, Speaker A: Wow.
00:51:29.164 - 00:51:36.624, Speaker G: It was two weeks of learning p five, and I started minting, so I kind of rushed there.
00:51:37.204 - 00:51:49.624, Speaker A: Well, that's pretty cool. Again, working fast is totally awesome, right? Because you're. You're not worrying too much about knowing every single detail of how this all works. You're just trying to make something work, right?
00:51:50.084 - 00:52:44.302, Speaker G: I think I have the experience of painting. That helps a lot. You can try to control as much as possible, or you can try to know as much as possible. I have these lists for the year or the month of what I should do, and I always write, learn art history. But I'm weak at art history. But with painting, my experience is that no matter how much I learn, I will be seeing that wild territory and land of things I will never know. Why not just have fun directly with this new for me thing that is code or some computer art science?
00:52:44.478 - 00:52:56.710, Speaker B: Santiago, are you familiar with. There's an app called the art story. If you want to learn art history and you just want to do it at your own pace and just kind of, like, read stories, read about artists. I would recommend that app.
00:52:56.742 - 00:52:57.794, Speaker C: It's really nice.
00:52:58.994 - 00:53:04.546, Speaker G: I will get it. I will search for it and get it. Thanks, Roy. Thanks, man.
00:53:04.650 - 00:53:07.138, Speaker C: Yeah, that's awesome.
00:53:07.186 - 00:53:26.068, Speaker A: I'll look that up too. It's always great to just get new. You know, you kind of constantly got to be feeding, you know, it's like, I think there's this image in ancient greek philosophy that it's like we're, it's like there's water that's always coming out of the vessel or out of the glass and you kind of constantly got.
00:53:26.076 - 00:53:27.636, Speaker B: To be filling it back up.
00:53:27.780 - 00:53:29.068, Speaker A: So maybe I'll check that out too.
00:53:29.116 - 00:53:31.572, Speaker C: Ed Marolla, welcome to the show.
00:53:31.628 - 00:53:43.504, Speaker A: Thanks for coming on. I know it's pretty early for you out there. Probably like Santi Santiago as well. Welcome to the show. And what art tools are you excited about? What new art tools are you using?
00:53:44.764 - 00:53:45.524, Speaker C: Hey.
00:53:45.684 - 00:53:47.612, Speaker F: Hey, guys. Hey, everyone.
00:53:47.788 - 00:53:48.544, Speaker C: Hey.
00:53:49.804 - 00:53:51.144, Speaker F: So the thing is.
00:53:51.904 - 00:53:54.712, Speaker C: Thank you. It's hard.
00:53:54.768 - 00:54:11.724, Speaker F: It's hard for me to check in the spaces. Not because it's so early. It's like eleven in the morning. It's not early, but I have this little guy here, this little baby that sometimes won't allow me to participate.
00:54:12.824 - 00:54:15.752, Speaker A: Just put it on speakerphone and then. Yeah.
00:54:15.808 - 00:54:17.864, Speaker C: Anyway, so. Yeah.
00:54:18.524 - 00:54:34.564, Speaker A: Well, I'm glad you made some time for us. So what are you tell us about? And I'm just such a huge fan of your development, really. And it's always so interesting to see. So tell us, are you using new tools or are you sort of sticking to what you like?
00:54:34.724 - 00:54:35.824, Speaker C: What are you up to?
00:54:38.964 - 00:54:47.108, Speaker F: I'm constantly looking for stuff, but not so, not so much as I would.
00:54:47.156 - 00:54:47.744, Speaker C: Say.
00:54:50.004 - 00:55:15.916, Speaker F: One little tool that cost me like $2. And it was really game changing. So for everyone using aseprite, there is an add on a plugin called Benz Brush. Oh, that is great because it allows you to make multiple brushes and, and be really quick with those brushes.
00:55:15.980 - 00:55:19.580, Speaker C: And it. It was a game changer for me.
00:55:19.772 - 00:55:23.468, Speaker A: Interesting. So it was bands brush.
00:55:23.556 - 00:55:26.516, Speaker C: Like B a n d s. B.
00:55:26.580 - 00:55:30.812, Speaker F: A b e n s bands.
00:55:30.948 - 00:55:31.388, Speaker C: Okay.
00:55:31.436 - 00:55:37.796, Speaker A: Benz brush. Yeah, I feel like maybe, just maybe I've heard of that. But maybe you tweeted about that a while ago.
00:55:37.980 - 00:55:39.096, Speaker C: Yeah, I did.
00:55:39.260 - 00:55:46.456, Speaker A: Yeah. I mean, I can't believe I remember that. It feels like months ago. It probably was. So that's interesting because this is like a whole other area.
00:55:46.520 - 00:55:50.032, Speaker C: It's like in digital, like just having.
00:55:50.088 - 00:55:52.320, Speaker A: An add on can almost be like.
00:55:52.352 - 00:55:57.744, Speaker C: A whole other, you know, app in a sense. Yeah. Right. Yeah.
00:55:57.904 - 00:56:12.784, Speaker A: The whole possibilities that are there? So that's super interesting. And is that the sampled brush work that I sometimes see where it's almost like it allows you to just take a sample and then kind of drag it and it creates its own kind of brush. Brush mark when you drag it.
00:56:12.824 - 00:56:33.968, Speaker F: Yes, exactly. I would. It just. It will split the canvas in sizes. You like doing a sprite sheet. It's the canvas. And each little square turns into a brush automatically.
00:56:33.968 - 00:56:56.408, Speaker F: And it's super quick to change the sizes. So I would just go experimental and draw something abstract and then pick samples from the abstraction and then abstract a little more. And in the end, like we've talked about it, I would just draw eyes and it turns into a monster.
00:56:56.536 - 00:56:57.724, Speaker E: Something like that.
00:56:58.144 - 00:57:17.004, Speaker A: You're another person that kind of works. And correct me if I'm wrong, but who works fast? And it works for you work fast. Right. Like, it's just like, just spread. Like, you know, just fill the canvas and then just start making things happen. It's sort of like. I think it's just such a great way to work.
00:57:17.004 - 00:57:27.812, Speaker A: And I think it would be funner where you're not worrying about it being perfect. I think you put it once, your formula, where it's like, don't worry about it being perfect, just try and make.
00:57:27.828 - 00:57:32.484, Speaker C: It unique, which I just loved, actually. Yeah. Yeah.
00:57:32.564 - 00:57:42.154, Speaker F: So it might come from. From like an imposter syndrome, or maybe it comes from some knowledge. I don't know.
00:57:44.454 - 00:57:48.154, Speaker C: Well, either way, it works either way. Yeah.
00:57:50.694 - 00:57:59.358, Speaker A: Quick question, just on the Metallica video, which I thought was incredible piece, are you ever going to mint that or are you not allowed to? Is there sort of a copyright thing.
00:57:59.406 - 00:58:01.288, Speaker C: Where it's kind of like, it's their.
00:58:01.336 - 00:58:01.924, Speaker G: Video.
00:58:04.264 - 00:58:06.424, Speaker F: I'm not allowed to mint it.
00:58:06.584 - 00:58:12.040, Speaker A: I mean, that thing. I mean, I would just be so curious as a one of one, what that might have went for. Right?
00:58:12.152 - 00:58:13.456, Speaker C: Yeah, right.
00:58:13.520 - 00:58:33.078, Speaker A: I mean, I bet that would have went for thousands. Oh, your mortgage. Very cool. And just as we're. We're going to go to mick renders in a second here, but are you still using AI? Because I saw you were using it. I really thought that was interesting how you were using it. It's kind of.
00:58:33.078 - 00:58:40.726, Speaker A: Yeah, like, it's almost a kind of compositional tool, an idea tool. Are you still using it or have you kind of put it to the.
00:58:40.750 - 00:58:42.034, Speaker C: Side for a little bit?
00:58:42.374 - 00:58:43.918, Speaker F: I've been using it, yeah.
00:58:43.966 - 00:58:44.714, Speaker C: A lot.
00:58:46.174 - 00:59:06.466, Speaker F: I used the mid journey and I will just trace over it, like, most of the time. Very few. Very few pieces I use, like, raw AI and will draw something over it. But for most of the time, I.
00:59:06.490 - 00:59:10.614, Speaker C: Will draw completely over it.
00:59:11.994 - 00:59:26.576, Speaker F: And the newest ones I'm not even tracing on top of the AI, set it as have reference on the side and draw inspired by it.
00:59:26.760 - 00:59:46.124, Speaker A: That is even more interesting. Yeah, I love it. Like, it's just using it as a vague idea. That is so interesting. Well, thank you for coming up on stage, Ed. It's always fascinating to hear from you and everybody. And I guess it's not as early as I thought out there, so that's awesome.
00:59:46.724 - 00:59:52.984, Speaker F: No, it's not early. It's just. It's actually in the middle of the day, so it's a bit hard to.
00:59:53.924 - 00:59:54.700, Speaker C: Yeah. Excellent.
00:59:54.732 - 01:00:02.276, Speaker A: We'll say hi to the family for us. And Mick. Is this Mick renders? Oh, no, it's Mick, doctor. It is Mick renders.
01:00:02.380 - 01:00:07.068, Speaker C: How are you doing? Okay.
01:00:07.236 - 01:00:09.028, Speaker A: Yes, you are loud and clear, Mick.
01:00:09.076 - 01:00:13.924, Speaker C: Where are you calling from? I am calling from California. It's early here. Okay.
01:00:13.964 - 01:00:17.584, Speaker A: I bet it is. I mean, it's. What time is it over in California?
01:00:17.924 - 01:00:19.052, Speaker C: It's 07:30 a.m.
01:00:19.108 - 01:00:30.020, Speaker D: I just got to work a few minutes ago, but I heard Santiago talking a little bit about Blender, and I wanted to chime in and, you know, give my. My two cent about some different tools that I've been using lately.
01:00:30.132 - 01:00:35.504, Speaker A: Well, you have come to the right place. Please do chime in. What are you using these days, Mick?
01:00:36.244 - 01:00:37.932, Speaker C: Yeah, so I know a lot of.
01:00:37.948 - 01:01:25.288, Speaker D: People have been using AI and AI assistant tools. And one of the really interesting things about blender, it being open source, is that, like, a lot of these tools have been integrated by the community into certain add ons and things. So one of the things that I've been having a good time with is using mid journey to generate different textures or different kind of abstract things, and then taking those into blender, and there's actually AI plugin that will create normal maps and, like, bump bump maps, bump height maps from whatever texture you're giving it. So you can kind of create these, you know, like, I've seen people use it to create, like, abstract, like, aztec walls. You know, you can kind of easily texture an entire scene or an entire room, you know, just with a few.
01:01:25.376 - 01:01:27.032, Speaker C: A few tools like that.
01:01:27.208 - 01:01:31.152, Speaker A: So it'll take a two dimensional image that you create on mid journey, and.
01:01:31.168 - 01:01:36.066, Speaker C: Then it'll interpret it in a three dimensional way. Exactly. Yeah.
01:01:36.090 - 01:02:04.084, Speaker D: So it'll give you, like, the normal map, like the pink and blue looking map of, you know, where the. Where the light should be going. And then, you know, simulate that in 3D so you can get these kind of really interesting, you know, textures that are unique. Because I know a lot of 3d artists too will, you know, use varying materials that they'll find online or models that they'll find online. So in this sense, it's, it's at least kind of like creating your own unique, you know, materials in a new way.
01:02:05.744 - 01:02:11.528, Speaker A: Very cool. And so I didn't realize blender was open source too, which maybe it is.
01:02:11.576 - 01:02:13.272, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. So is it free?
01:02:13.408 - 01:02:14.696, Speaker A: I mean, maybe that's.
01:02:14.880 - 01:02:16.432, Speaker C: Yeah. Good.
01:02:16.488 - 01:02:19.044, Speaker A: Very interesting. And you've been using it for years?
01:02:19.704 - 01:02:23.064, Speaker D: I've been using it for a little over a year.
01:02:23.184 - 01:02:23.964, Speaker A: Okay.
01:02:24.344 - 01:02:42.122, Speaker D: I've been, I've been doing 3d for about two or three years now. I actually started with 3d printing, so I got a 3d printer first, learned how to use that and then said, hmm, maybe I want to, you know, do some, you know, be able to make my own things and 3d print my own things. And then kind of went from there.
01:02:42.298 - 01:02:46.170, Speaker C: Wow. So I didn't realize you can make.
01:02:46.202 - 01:02:52.294, Speaker A: Your own, you can, I guess you can buy your own 3d printer, but I assume it costs a lot of money. Like what do you put in for ink?
01:02:53.314 - 01:03:11.668, Speaker D: So the, it's pretty crazy because, you know, just a few years ago, it would have been pretty expensive endeavor to get started in, but the barrier to entry is getting less and less expensive. I think, you know, micro center, which is one of the local electronic stores, will run deals where so you can get a ender three, like a starter 3d printer for around $100.
01:03:11.796 - 01:03:13.788, Speaker C: Wow. Not bad.
01:03:13.836 - 01:03:23.984, Speaker D: And then the filament itself is usually it's like $20 for like a kilo of a filament. You can even go a pretty long way with that amount of filament as well.
01:03:24.776 - 01:03:25.964, Speaker A: That is as dirt cheap.
01:03:27.384 - 01:03:27.952, Speaker C: Wow.
01:03:28.048 - 01:03:29.848, Speaker A: And so have you, are you still.
01:03:29.896 - 01:03:31.844, Speaker C: Using it or did you get bored with it?
01:03:32.864 - 01:03:53.604, Speaker D: I'm using it pretty often. I actually do like rapid prototyping and some of it on my nine to five. So I will do that during my daily work. So when I'm at home, I'll be focusing on my other art usually. But there are times I look forward to the days where when my son is old enough, I'll be able to 3d print him his own toys.
01:03:54.294 - 01:04:25.254, Speaker A: Wow, that is super cool. Yeah, I gotta look this up because, I mean, again, like you just start thinking it seems like a lot easier to make these kind of 3d files these days. And then all of a sudden, like, I mean, I just think of like the Kurt Hussle collective, if you know them. You know, he makes his augmented reality hot dog or baseball. I assume that can, one way or another, be converted into a file that can be 3D printed. Does that sound right to you?
01:04:25.714 - 01:04:26.874, Speaker C: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
01:04:26.954 - 01:04:37.770, Speaker D: I'm a big Kurt hustle fan as well. And yeah, those GLB files, you could actually take them into blender, convert it to STL, and then throw that in your 3d printing software.
01:04:37.882 - 01:04:39.058, Speaker C: Pretty much no problem.
01:04:39.226 - 01:04:51.174, Speaker A: Unbelievable. That is exciting. So there is a new app, and is there anything else that you're using that is of note that you're experimenting with, just trying stuff out or that you're excited about?
01:04:51.614 - 01:05:11.514, Speaker D: Yeah, I know you've mentioned touch designer a couple times. I've dabbled just a bit in touch designer. I like the node based coding environment, creative coding environment, and it gives you a lot of freedom and control and power to pretty much do whatever you could imagine or have the capability to code.
01:05:11.974 - 01:05:16.714, Speaker A: Interesting. So that is a coding app.
01:05:17.894 - 01:05:44.554, Speaker D: It's a visual node based coding. So it's still code in the back end, but it's a lot easier for people that don't have a lot of coding experience per se to get their feet wet with. It's also another app that's free to download and use, but is a proprietary app where it's like, if you want to use it commercially or export at a certain resolution, do need to pay for their license.
01:05:46.894 - 01:05:54.034, Speaker A: Fascinating. And so, okay, so you're using, and just a final sort of question as we wrap up here.
01:05:55.254 - 01:05:56.834, Speaker C: What are you using it for?
01:05:59.334 - 01:06:15.504, Speaker D: It's kind of like an ultimate compositing application in a way, where you can take all sorts of mixed media and add them on top of each other, or add animation to them, or, you know, it's kind of an endless.
01:06:17.364 - 01:06:18.228, Speaker C: Possibilities.
01:06:18.356 - 01:06:20.004, Speaker D: Of what you can do with it.
01:06:20.164 - 01:06:21.508, Speaker G: Then a couple other, just two other.
01:06:21.556 - 01:06:45.764, Speaker D: Little software things I've been using lately. I've been checking out aseprite. I heard Ed mention that, and that's a really powerful pixel art tool. And then Santiago mentioned Nomad sculpt as well. That's a pretty powerful 3d sculpting application that initially I kind of wrote off as kind of just like a key cutesy sculpting app. But after diving into a little bit more, it has a lot of abstract power.
01:06:46.264 - 01:07:05.804, Speaker A: Very interesting. So just as a final sort of kind of question here, then, how do you approach new tools? Like, do you go out and search for them, or do you stumble across them and see what's there? Do you wait to see something interesting? I mean, it's kind of a. I don't know how I would answer that question, but do you have an answer for that question?
01:07:06.484 - 01:07:30.996, Speaker D: Yeah, I think there's, you know, I see a lot of, you know, people in the space using different tools, friends of mine, different, you know, like people in the VJ space, like the video jockey space, using a lot of these different tools. And, you know, I figured, you know, most software, once you get the. It's like an 80 20 thing, where once you get the 20% of the tools, you know, that you're going to use 80% of the time, you can.
01:07:31.020 - 01:07:32.426, Speaker C: Kind of figure it out.
01:07:32.450 - 01:07:46.842, Speaker D: And a lot of the software, once you get the ins and out, will kind of play nice with each other as well. You know, it's like touch designer. You can take a video and do things to it. You can also take a 3d file and render it in touch designer.
01:07:46.978 - 01:07:47.642, Speaker C: You know, there's.
01:07:47.698 - 01:07:53.334, Speaker D: There's a lot of different ways that all of these different tools that I've been using can kind of all play together.
01:07:54.274 - 01:08:01.436, Speaker A: Well, it's a wonderful note to wrap up on. Do you have any final thoughts, rune tune, as we wrap up here?
01:08:01.580 - 01:08:25.752, Speaker B: No, thanks. Mick renders for all the valuable information. I have a hard time with the new apps, and it takes me a long time to find my bearings when I'm on a new app. So it's always inspiring when I hear people like you talk about this huge variety of apps and tools that you use. I totally appreciate it.
01:08:25.928 - 01:08:34.284, Speaker D: Sometimes it feels like it's spreading myself too thin. But then when I realized, okay, they can all kind of work together, it grounds me back a little bit.
01:08:34.784 - 01:09:00.166, Speaker A: Yeah, I find it inspiring as well. And, yeah, you can actually, if you just keep chasing the next new tool, it can be a tricky thing. But like you say, there are certain tools that you kind of gravitate towards and that will come together and kind of can find a place in your process over time. Well, thank you, Mick, as well. And thank you, everybody who came up on stage. Santiago. Retro Manny.
01:09:00.166 - 01:09:02.814, Speaker A: Oh, Retro Manny has his hand up. Retro Manny.
01:09:02.894 - 01:09:03.758, Speaker C: Go for it.
01:09:03.886 - 01:09:21.389, Speaker E: Yeah, sorry. Just a quick one. I know there's been a lot of talk of Blender. I'm in a blender DM group where we all just. There's no shilling. It's just people sharing information about what they've learned on Blender and just helping each other, um, with new tools and. And progress and work in progress and things like that.
01:09:21.389 - 01:09:23.053, Speaker E: So if anyone does want to join.
01:09:23.093 - 01:09:26.117, Speaker C: Just send me a DM. Awesome.
01:09:26.205 - 01:09:40.781, Speaker A: Yeah, send Retro Manny a DM to learn more about that. So thank you, Retro Manny. Thank you, Ed Marolla. And thank you most of all, runetune and everybody else listening out there. Thanks for joining us. And until next week, we'll be here once again.
01:09:40.957 - 01:09:41.373, Speaker C: Take care.
