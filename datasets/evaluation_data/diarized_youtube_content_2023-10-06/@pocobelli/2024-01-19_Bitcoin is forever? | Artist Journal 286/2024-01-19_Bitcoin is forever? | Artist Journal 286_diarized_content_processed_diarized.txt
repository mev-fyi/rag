00:00:05.040 - 00:00:37.094, Speaker A: It is always a joy to come join you, speaking to myself on my laptop, but knowing that you're out there somewhere. Thank you, everybody. Let me just say a big happy Friday. Thank you to everybody that helps this show along, whether you're just watching casually on YouTube after a weird search or anything else, retweeting everything, going to the spaces. Thank you. Welcome back. Artist Journal, January 19, 2024.
00:00:37.094 - 00:01:11.328, Speaker A: Making it up as I go along. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. Part of the magic of this show, for me is, I was saying in an earlier show a few days ago, I remember, and I mentioned it at the start of the show again, like maybe earlier this week. I wonder what'll happen today as I was drinking the coffee, and I really don't know. That's kind of, like the most exciting part of it. And just a quick story on that point. I remember talking to an old.
00:01:11.328 - 00:01:52.654, Speaker A: It was my old who shall be nameless in this episode? My old philosophy professor, Kevin Corrigan. I once wrote him, I said, you should record your lectures. Like, you know, it'd be important. But he was, I think he was such a socratic guy to the core that I don't think he wanted to record. It was almost the response I got was, you know, not to get too far into correspondences here, but it was basically like, I'll do it in person, like with the voice or however it was. Thank you very much. But all to say, living in the moment, you know.
00:01:52.654 - 00:02:07.450, Speaker A: Yeah. A bit of a mystic over there, that. Great, great professor. All to say, okay, let's get started here. All that being said. So check it out. Jake studios.
00:02:07.450 - 00:03:16.004, Speaker A: I am pleased to begin the newspaper of the imagination with Jake Studios consistently enigmatic in his illustrations. And I think, I mean, I feel like illustration maybe isn't the right word just because it uses, you know, and it's an interesting point, you know, to get a little bit philosophical here. Why do I call this an illustration? Well, I guess because it uses what seems to be, like, you know, an illustrative, kind of like a marker tool or something, right. It's got the outlines right, but, you know, also it's almost got, like, that 1960s style of coloring where there's no gradient, you know, comic book coloring, so to speak. So I guess it kind of has traits of illustration. But as I was going to say, like, I mean, is texture the only difference between a drawing and a painting? You know, is it the fact that it's got a hard contour versus a looser, like. So, you know, what is the difference I guess there are certain qualities and characteristics this shares a lot with, you know, say, what you'd find in comics.
00:03:16.004 - 00:04:09.166, Speaker A: You know, illustration outlines, uh, the coloring style. So all to say, let's not get lost on that. I felt like this was a very. It just felt natural to begin with this today because I felt like it really captured the zeitgeist, you know, these two, you know, the person with the red headband fighting the person with the blue headband, abstracting, you know, our wild kind of geopolitical, you know, again, situation. Again, capturing the zeitgeist here, what seems to be a river in between, but still somewhat ambiguous and a strange river at that. I've never seen a river like this before, if that's what it is. But I assume it is with almost it going over a hill here and you seeing the waves at the top here of this river.
00:04:09.166 - 00:05:03.034, Speaker A: So you see the creativity in Jake studio's work. And here, a hilarious kind of seemingly tv with what seems to be WTF and a little ball and chain, so to speak. But it's actually the tv with this almost torture device here or weapon. And there is a drone with a big eyeball, again, kind of intuiting the surveillance state. Been kind of capturing it in a beautiful, what I'd say, surrealist image, almost capturing the sentiment, the feeling, the visual feeling of surveillance here, captured poetically in art at the top right here with a little fun. Little. And then technically kind of very fun there, too, with the little kind of helicopters of the little drone there.
00:05:03.034 - 00:05:44.910, Speaker A: Beautiful. And, you know, again, these kind of roughly manually pixelated clouds, some upside down. Again, a real, you know, I've been discussing here this embracing the irrational, you know, and that's kind of the difference between art and, you know, perhaps design, right? That's one of the differences. You know, as I like to say, art is a. Is a poetic form of design. And what I mean by poetic is it embraces the irrational, right? So among other things. But I'd say that's probably the main characteristic without putting too much thought into it here.
00:05:44.910 - 00:06:18.054, Speaker A: Interestingly, here, too, you know, and so you have these coins, almost, these Super Mario coins here. Let's zoom in. And here's a gift where we can zoom in. I guess it is a matter of resolution. Someone actually, I don't know if someone wrote me a message or put a comment, but someone mentioned, I think someone wrote me a comment, saying it's usually the reason the gifts aren't magnifying is because of their usually small resolution. And this would seem to make the point that that person was making. So thank you for that comment there.
00:06:18.054 - 00:07:06.504, Speaker A: And even just the lips on the person here over here, like all pretty original, isn't it? And there's some, are those flowers, roses at the bottom, you know, in this beautifully textured area. So great work here. And they both seem to have roses at the back hiding behind, you know, hiding behind their other arm, shooting with one arm, hiding roses on the other, behind the other. Very, very interesting here. So, and again, I mean, as you look over at the person with money in their face, like, is this the war profiteer here? I don't know. Interesting. And, and what on earth is this, right, this almost horn here that's bleeding.
00:07:06.504 - 00:07:27.930, Speaker A: A surreal illustration. Again, it's, it's hard to reason it. It must be art. Langit lupa, in fairness, not unfairness, but in fairness. Right. So again, you know, the WTF is happening. One could call it self reflexive.
00:07:27.930 - 00:07:52.374, Speaker A: Not only is it a commentary here, seemingly on war and just the news. What is going on? Again, the zeitgeist here edition of one for 15 tezos. This is still available. My Tezos wallet is empty, but I might do something about that. But wow, this is one heck of a Jake Studios. One of one to be only 15 tezos here. Nice dimensions too.
00:07:52.374 - 00:08:25.544, Speaker A: You might notice it fits the screen perfectly. I keep kind of a, you know, crt or like classic tv kind of ratio here and it seems to almost fit perfectly. So beautiful work here. And again, self reflexive, because not only is it discussing, you know, perhaps war and what's going on here, what is this chaos? None of this makes sense. But also referring to the work itself. What on earth is going on here? WTF is happening? Digitally drawn animation by Jake Studios. One of one.
00:08:25.544 - 00:08:51.034, Speaker A: I may have to run through this episode. Did it already sell? Oh, oxygen. So this is a, there's axine on the scene seeing what's going on. So this is an auction. Wisely done. Actually, Jake Studios, that's another way to kind of solve for how to sell work in a kind of a trickier market. You put it for auction and then the market just does what the market does.
00:08:51.034 - 00:09:12.648, Speaker A: Clearly. Look at that. I mean, oxyn kin wiz oxine sees the quality. This work here, there is another one here. Please wait. So Jake Studios has been quite prolific recently, and this is listed for 2000 tezos. And let me just see, I assume this is a new one.
00:09:12.648 - 00:09:37.050, Speaker A: Yeah, January 18. So kind of on a roll here. And this looks like heaven. Please wait. Doesn't it kind of look like a weird kind of variation on St. Peter's gate here, where you're showing up and there's the crown of thorns again, like this is not, as they would say, didactic. This is not like obvious, this is not literal, it's quite the opposite.
00:09:37.050 - 00:10:10.142, Speaker A: It is suggestive, it is ambiguous, it is very intuitive. There is an irrational logic here with these upside down dripping clouds. Again, it is not easy, I would argue. It is not easy to be irrational. It is a muscle that you gotta work, I would argue. So here we are again, wonderfully irrational work here. Look at the clouds, the white clouds here.
00:10:10.142 - 00:10:45.360, Speaker A: Kind of pixelated but drawn. You are safe or something. You are safe here. Again, I kind of like digital St. Peter's gate with this almost illuminati type figure here and this ghost with the crown of thorns. Again, it's easy to kind of pass over a work like this and think, you know, oh, isn't that interesting? And move along. But when you look up close, as you zoom in, it really, I mean, even the spider web, it really starts to add up all of the mystery of this work.
00:10:45.360 - 00:11:04.224, Speaker A: And even doing the clouds over here, the coins come back. Interesting trope. This one is 2000 tezos. If you are looking for to buy, please wait. Almost a digital statement there. And let me, I forgot to bring up the comments here. We'll do it another time.
00:11:04.224 - 00:11:20.246, Speaker A: I guess we'll do it on Monday. Actually, we can do it with Twitter here. We can do the Twitter comments. Let's just bring them up very quickly. We can just bring them up and actually we got some good YouTube. We'll see if I can bring up the YouTube really quickly here. Let's see here.
00:11:20.246 - 00:11:37.548, Speaker A: Click on the date. Okay. And this is what I think I'll do here, because then you don't put the link in, which may hurt the reach. And thank you. This is doing great. And so thank you. Dancevatar snips when art on inscription.
00:11:37.548 - 00:12:07.678, Speaker A: So there are ETH. There are inscriptions on ETH. There's inscriptions on, I think, polkadot, probably cardano avalanche. You know, I was talking to a bitcoin developer in the summer and he was actually doing ETH scriptions way back then. I haven't seen, actually he was working on a marketplace. So I'm not sure what's going on with inscriptions on ETH, but it's kind of a different than ordinals. But I'm not sure.
00:12:07.678 - 00:12:21.134, Speaker A: But as I said, feel free to Dm anything you see. Pixel lord. Hey, love to hear about bitcoin. Art from you. And let's zoom in here. So, yeah, great. I love the bitcoin theme, too.
00:12:21.134 - 00:12:40.104, Speaker A: I think it's a very powerful, very powerful narrative. I don't think it's going away, but as we're going to see here, some people are, you know, some of the developers want to get rid of it. We're going to take a closer look at that in a second. Kappan. Thanks, Adrian. Indeed, the pattern was used as a brush to fill the pot. I think it was 32 by 32.
00:12:40.104 - 00:13:03.206, Speaker A: How cool is that? So kind of bringing up an interesting point here. With a 32 by 32, you can probably make a pattern as big as you want, of course. So you could do eight by 816. By 1632 by 32. Thank you, captain. Very interesting and very beautiful brush stroke or brush marker. Let's continue.
00:13:03.206 - 00:13:15.422, Speaker A: Valdez. Vampy. I really enjoy having your show running in the picture, in the picture corner as I browse art. Really great to hear. And it's great to hear when artists are also working. I hear that often, too. So very cool.
00:13:15.422 - 00:13:38.886, Speaker A: Martin Jo, just in time for my morning coffee, which was brilliant. Always good to hear from you and Bron. Thank you so much for quoting my latest pieces in your journal. Curation made me really glad and loved to hear about the artist creating its own pixels. Very captivating. So, referring to Kap in here, and of course, Bronn. Bron is the artist who did the abstracts, remember, with kind of like the horizontal pixels near the start of the.
00:13:38.886 - 00:13:53.134, Speaker A: Showed a couple of those two or three, so very cool. Abstracts. Lips in black. Great to hear from you again, and thank you. I'm glad you're finding the show interesting. And tuks as well. Great to hear from you and Lucas Lejeune.
00:13:53.134 - 00:14:06.082, Speaker A: Great episode as always. Thank you. So thank you. And here's little cakes. I love that you showed Ed Marolla's post on the show. This poetic work here. His words, sounds, and work always take my mind and heart to a warm and cozy place.
00:14:06.082 - 00:14:41.894, Speaker A: I found it particularly poetic in a sense, like it didn't necessarily fit the, you know, obvious format of the show, but it was just a really nice poetic statement. Peter Nish, great to hear from you. Cloud. While I do love ordinals for being stored in sats, they're too expensive for the artist and for an everyday person, of course. We were roughly calculating back the napkin calculations yesterday that that work, you know, 100 kb would be about $1,000 or $10 per kilobyte. I've done inscriptions as provenance mints to point to tazos, one of ones and physical pieces. Very interesting.
00:14:41.894 - 00:15:12.780, Speaker A: So again, what I do, what's cool about gamma that we're looking at is you can the collector, it allows lazy minting. So that could be a way around this being there, being too expensive. Continuing on, thank you for the comment. I'm going to inscribe a piece onto a penny. What a great idea. Referring to the fungible and non fungible aspect of ordinals. Da Nyris retro.
00:15:12.780 - 00:15:58.094, Speaker A: Manny's piece made me go back in time with n 64 star Fox nostalgia, so it almost felt older than that, but I don't know Star Fox that well, but kind of reminded me of video games from like the, literally like the big arcade games from the eighties that you'd go to the arcade which you don't really see too often anymore. Hopi, thank you for the comment and thank you. And let me just very quickly here, go to the channel here. We are going live here and let's do this. Let's do this. Okay. Santiago is a codal.
00:15:58.094 - 00:16:07.214, Speaker A: Very nice episode. A good selection of art and ideas that sparkle. That sparkle. Interesting discussion. Beautifully put there. Santiago. Great to hear from you.
00:16:07.214 - 00:16:38.284, Speaker A: And I think I can say it in a week and a half, I'm gonna be on Santiago's or Saturday morning here in Berlin, Friday night show over in central or South America there. So thank you. And it's nice to know. It's great to hear feedback on the editorial side of things here. Pixelord art on bitcoin, aka ordinals, definitely gives fomo very similar vibes to early 2021 ETH. NFT space this year is orange. Thanks for the show.
00:16:38.284 - 00:17:12.466, Speaker A: I know what you mean. I know what you mean, definitely. It just has all the. It has all the makings of a kind of memetic narrative, is what I'm trying to say. It has all the makings of a, of a viral narrative, doesn't it? There's something about it. And then all of a sudden when it. It's sort of like the NFT, once it clicked with ETH, all of a sudden it's like, oh my God, you know, I was very late to that party before my understanding came to it.
00:17:12.466 - 00:17:29.746, Speaker A: It kind of eventually came, but it was right near the end of the party there. Some people made fortunes there. I didn't understand it at first, and I suspect it could be a similar situation. Thank you. So thank you for all the comments there. Much appreciated. Lanidas, we're back on ordinals.
00:17:29.746 - 00:18:11.958, Speaker A: I mean, this was a big deal. So former breaking former president of the United States, Donald Trump just announced that he's going to inscribe his mugshot into bitcoin and sell it as an ordinals. So whatever one thinks of Donald Trump, a sign that things are going kind of surprisingly mainstream. I mean, crypto, you can't make this stuff up. And here, like, crypto is a weird one because it's kind of anti authoritarian, you know, as they say, cypherpunk, but it's kind of totally mainstream at the same time. Right. So it's a weird, you know, again, and you see it right here if you need more evidence.
00:18:11.958 - 00:18:29.142, Speaker A: Right. And let's just see what they say here. And before we read it, the trump digital trading card team, as you see down here, and I think they put out stuff on ETH last year. Right. Great news. Something amazing is coming your way. You purchased, you purchased 100 digital trading cards on collect trumpcards.com
00:18:29.142 - 00:18:55.284, Speaker A: mugshot edition. As part of your purchase, you get a one of one digital trading card. Your one of one will be minted as a bitcoin ordinal. And of course, I'm sure they're just trying to get as much money as possible. So we'll put on bitcoin, but pretty interesting. You'll be able to view your trump trading card ordinals on Magic Eden, a leader in the ordinals ecosystem. So magic Eden gets the launch there.
00:18:55.284 - 00:19:12.684, Speaker A: That is impressive for Magic Eden or just. I. I guess it's good for them. We're a community of collectors. They're non transferable until December 31, 2024. I wonder how they make that happen. They're non transferable, so maybe you get sent them after.
00:19:12.684 - 00:19:30.234, Speaker A: I wonder how they control that. Doing ordinals doesn't really convince me for being a way to keep my works intact eternally. So this is one of probably the main. The argument. Right? And forgive the hair. It is post gym here. Post gym hair.
00:19:30.234 - 00:19:47.074, Speaker A: We will try one last time there and just pray for. There we go. We can just call that. Okay. Okay. The art is in the hair today. Okay, so this is the main argument.
00:19:47.074 - 00:20:37.484, Speaker A: It's immutable, but ultimately there's three things, but it's permanent. Is the idea or eternal here? So Cheperton and I think we have a work by Cheperton today. Actually not convinced on this whole eternal idea. To be fair, I don't see anything applying to that definition. Deeply convinced that whatever medium I use it will fall into obsolescence someday. My work is grounded on lost and destruction because this is where I find myself in adequation with the physical world we all live in. Of course, I think technically true, nothing lasts forever other than cosmic things.
00:20:37.484 - 00:21:04.454, Speaker A: Eventually there will come a time in the universe. Maybe it's when the sun blows up. At a certain point, of course, bitcoin will disappear. But it's sort of like I'm kind of back to. I don't know if I'd let that disqualify the idea. Like it's all relative, right? Like in an ideal kind of platonic form sense. Yeah.
00:21:04.454 - 00:22:04.804, Speaker A: It's not going to last forever. Bitcoin is not going to last forever in a relative sense. Let's say you had the challenge of having to make something last a thousand years or accessible for a thousand years. How would you do it if you had no other choice? And what is your best option? Right. So again, I'm kind of back to the pragmatic side of things, like what is possible? What is your best hope of something going? And I'd say probably, you know, it's not a crazy thought to say that bitcoin is your best shot at creating something that will last a thousand years, that will still be accessible, that will not be eroded by time. Now, we could have quantum computing or whatever it is. Who knows with bitcoin? I was listening to a financial analyst yesterday who has seen it go up to 150,000 before it totally crashes.
00:22:04.804 - 00:23:21.364, Speaker A: I thought, yeah, that sounds actually kind of persuasive to me as a narrative because everybody's so focused on bitcoin not failing bitcoin not, you know, just going up forever. I mean, it's hard to find people who are saying, you know, bitcoin's going to a dollar unless they're just totally hating. But anybody that kind of understands and has bought and sold crypto, almost everybody's a bull, right? Because they enjoy it and they kind of get it. So all to say, no one knows. But just finally, on this very kind of profound point that I think Shepperton is bringing up, but what if it does last a thousand years? What if it does last 5000 years or 2000 years or even 500 years? What if it outlasts? What if it is the best bet? And what if it outlasts basically everything else, all the other options in a digital world? We're flying around the solar system, maybe beyond, right? Are you going to say, oh, way back in 2024, you went, oh, no, forget it. I don't think this is going to work. It's like, as an artist, it's such a tantalizing proposition.
00:23:21.364 - 00:23:43.112, Speaker A: It's hard. I mean, don't you have to risk it, is what I would say. If we were out for coffee, I'd be Cheperton. Don't you like? Because we don't know. And again, this could be gone in two months, for all we know. If there's something goes wrong, who knows? AI figures out how to decrypt it. Who knows? But if it doesn't, don't.
00:23:43.112 - 00:24:06.234, Speaker A: Like. I mean, it's. Right now it's going on. The biggest likelihood for. I'd say it's the best contender for relatively speaking, lasting, quote, unquote, forever on a relative sense, you know, at least relative to everything else. Thank you for the wonderful. Or I guess it was just a comment on Twitter, but a wonderful comment from Shepperton.
00:24:06.234 - 00:24:57.150, Speaker A: And here, I mean, this. Someone sent this to me, I think, was Quiro. Bitcoin developers to kill ordinals war in BTC community begins so this was from December, I think. Or is that June 12 or December? You know, in Europe, they put the day first, but in the US and North America, often they put the month first. So I'm not exactly sure when this was written, if it was June or December of 2023. Inscriptions push bitcoin network to its limits, but core developers are not ready to deal with it anymore. So I wonder, because I'm not convinced they're going to get rid of it, because Michael Saylor, you know, probably the greatest evangelist for bitcoin, was kind of all for it, you know, and was all for the use case.
00:24:57.150 - 00:25:40.388, Speaker A: So I think after Michael Saylor came out, who knows? And, I mean, Luke 500 also had a post saying, you know, they're trying to kill it. There are people that want to get rid of ordinals. I have a feeling they're not going to. But again, it's sort of back to this idea, but what if it's not killed? What if bitcoin does last thousands of years? It's not a crazy thought. Like, it's digital, right? So what if it's going across starships and whatever? Not crazy. Eventually, money will have to be similar, so why not bitcoin? It'll have to be a similar technology, so why not bitcoin? Right? So just interesting there. And this is Pixel Lord.
00:25:40.388 - 00:26:06.282, Speaker A: Pixel Lord mentioned that he had a collection on bitcoin, on ordinals. And so I said, send me the collection, and here it is. And look, it's even got a pretty good floor there of almost 0.01. I mean, that is how much like 4000, is that. No, 400. I guess that'd be $400, if I'm not mistaken, because 0.1 would be 4000.
00:26:06.282 - 00:26:19.870, Speaker A: This would be 400. Okay, so it's almost, but not bad. I mean, 45 owners. So here's the collection. So, pretty cool. I'm not sure when this came out. Total supply of 75.
00:26:19.870 - 00:26:42.382, Speaker A: I want to learn, actually, how to put a collection together because I've minted some works, but I haven't figured out how to make a collection out of it. And I have an idea, actually, for my own little collection there. So very cool. No emojis on magic Eden here. Just do a search on that and you'll find Pixel Lords collection. It's a pretty cool collection here, too. So.
00:26:42.382 - 00:27:01.722, Speaker A: Yeah, just very cool. Thank you for sending me that. And cool work. Pixel lord Jamie Gourlay. We're thinking about integrating verseworks with more block chains, artists and collectors. What chains would you like to mint on? So this was interesting. And again, verseworks really tries, I think, from a branding perspective, to put themselves in a kind of a.
00:27:01.722 - 00:27:59.594, Speaker A: They have a pretty smooth, I'd say, rollout of their pr, so to speak. Their website, it allows credit cards, if I'm not mistaken. They seem to really, you know, another kind of version of trying to bridge this gap between the traditional and the digital or the crypto art space. So this is interesting because I think they were on ETH, and it could be a sign of the kind of, again, of the kind of the stumbling blocks or the barriers or the hurdles, let's call it the hurdles of working on ETH right now. The fees are expensive and people are pretty bullish on ETH, so they don't necessarily want to spend their ethereum. And I'm kind of, you know, and in my heart of hearts, if you said, if I was at St. Peters Gate and you said, what is this tweet about? I'm wondering if they're curious about ordinals.
00:27:59.594 - 00:28:53.420, Speaker A: Because again, there is, you see, Sotheby's right. There is something inherently, it captures the imagination, right? And then again, it's back to the what if. Because what if bitcoin survives? What if it lasts 2000 years or longer? Then if that's the case, then don't you wish you had art on it? And even if that's a 10% chance, those are pretty good odds, right, for the payoff, which is you're going to have art on bitcoin of this historic thing. I mean, people compare it to the Gutenberg press, even say it's as big of an invention. They're not crazy arguments. Okay, so pretty interesting to see this Jamie Gurley, who is building verseworks and exhibition space. So art dealer turned art degen.
00:28:53.420 - 00:29:20.964, Speaker A: So interesting, someone else from the trad scene who has been seduced by this wonderful scene here, rare. And it's sold. So of course, rare doing a beautiful job of kind of showing these works here. This is a typical rare thing to do to put the works in kind of this mock gallery here. And this work did very, very, very well. I mean, 23 and a half. Saul 21 $75.
00:29:20.964 - 00:29:45.256, Speaker A: So very nice. Very nice result for rare. And pretty good deal for the artist too. I mean, because in a sense, you start doing the conversions. I mean, because rare's work goes for several ETH. This is less than an ethanol, I mean, but it's 24 sol. I mean, so isn't that interesting? So I think just fun and cool and great for everybody.
00:29:45.256 - 00:30:05.600, Speaker A: Still great sales, real money. Zora engineering. Zora is the most widely used minting protocol on Ethereum. I did not know that. The most widely used minting protocol on Ethereum. Each month it has over 190,000 collectors and 10,000 creators. Minting, you know, a Zora is pretty interesting.
00:30:05.600 - 00:30:31.004, Speaker A: And again, we're gonna have Zack back in March after a little bit of the botched space when I was in Heathrow there last time. So I'm gonna have Zack back and I want to ask more just about Zora. And just like what it, like, it's, as he's saying, in the last space, it's kind of like an old school blockchain. This is impressive. So yeah, don't ignore Zora. There's a lot going on on it. Here are some platforms built on it.
00:30:31.004 - 00:30:58.154, Speaker A: Farcaster and warpcast, decentralized social network interface, mobile app interface app, a multiplayer crypto tool. I don't think they've ever released a token. Interestingly, mint fun. So there's all sorts of stuff going on on Zora here. Daylight gallery. So all sorts of stuff going on here. Zora docs.
00:30:58.154 - 00:31:23.556, Speaker A: Just very cool. Let's continue. And of course, again, Zach will be on in March. Omz nft. It might sound counterintuitive, but as a collector, you want to be acquiring work from artists that are being overlooked by the majority here. Yeah, I think that was an interesting comment. And it was back to that article we were seeing that was linked by.
00:31:23.556 - 00:31:56.550, Speaker A: I think it was. Was it Cobe Art weekly that was linked to from Allen survey and how it's a collector's market and so if you want to get really the really fine deals, this is a pretty good idea. Go for the overlooked artists in this market. You can get steals right now. So interesting thought from Omz Empress trash. Today I dropped on Zorasol, zero one, and tezos. So living the multi chain dream over here, tezos and zero one editions are all gone.
00:31:56.550 - 00:32:18.602, Speaker A: Without tweeting. Now, zero one, don't forget, is avalanche. I thought it had maybe kind of died, but I mean, if editions are gone without even tweeting, say, with tazos, that's pretty good. Zora, months long, free open edition. Has 25 mints. And already, and I think this was just today. So in one day, 25 mints and Saul.
00:32:18.602 - 00:32:39.614, Speaker A: And this is an edit. I sold one edition. So living the multi chain dream over here, Empress trash. And this was also super interesting. The best part of being an empress is I get the elite first pick of the litter of circuit bent cameras. So we were looking at these the other day from let's glitch it, and I chose this little silly guy. So these are all custom made cameras.
00:32:39.614 - 00:32:56.284, Speaker A: Now I just need help getting it because shipping to Mexico from us is crazy town prices. That's wild. Shipping to Mexico from us, that shouldn't be too bad. But it is. So here it is, a circuit bent camera. That's a pretty cool one. Just fits in your hand there.
00:32:56.284 - 00:33:14.694, Speaker A: Wow. Nice result there, too. Look at that. So very cool project there. All around from let's glitch it embers trash picking up a camera. Helio Santos. An earlier stage in the process here, which is pretty interesting.
00:33:14.694 - 00:33:52.672, Speaker A: You see how this starts here, which kind of gives us a bit more of a window on what's going on with Helio Santos. What I think what I pretty sure are custom made paint plotting tools. And these are interesting because they're built more, you might say, in a traditional way, as you can see here, rather than the. Remember the art matter thing where it's like we do the texture first and then we spray over top. So this one feels a little bit more like the traditional thing. And you get like this. Okay, see where it started there? It's kind of bleeding because it's got a lot of water in it.
00:33:52.672 - 00:34:25.744, Speaker A: But by down here, there's not like it needs to redip its. Its brush, I think, in the paint. Very cool video there and here. And let me just stop that. And here we have Michael Macasso. And at first I thought, because it's so perfectly centered on the square piece of paper, at first I thought maybe it was an inkjet, but that black is so rich, and you almost can see the texture of the black here. I think this is a screen print, not an inkjet, and maybe a two color, but not positive on that.
00:34:25.744 - 00:34:56.312, Speaker A: Maybe it's a one color, which would be pretty awesome because you do one color and there it is. I'm not sure if in here it's a darker or a lighter color or if it's all just one color here, I think it might be all one color. So very cool work here from Michael Macasso. I suspect a screen print, but not positive on that. And here is Jean Provencher, messenger plotter drawing, limited edition link below. So these are plotter drawings. Interestingly, let's just Jean Provencher.
00:34:56.312 - 00:35:44.192, Speaker A: And we've looked at some of the cool experimental work. Look at how well this works. I still need to get a plotter or rent a plotter or find someone with a plotter in Berlin here, because it really is a solution here. If you make works like this, for example, those promoted stories that I do, you could totally. What would that look like with a plotter? Is what I ask myself or anybody that does kind of pixel work like this, you know, I mean, and how sellable is that, right? We talk about preciousness, right? Making it into a physical object gives it its own preciousness. And you're also traveling through the mediums. So that also has, I'd argue, a kind of alchemical result.
00:35:44.192 - 00:36:40.364, Speaker A: You know, all of a sudden, you know, what might be seen as, like, okay, an interesting kind of nice pixel drawing. All of a sudden, when you see it in physical form with this plotter version, also, it has a certain degree of preciousness, and it becomes. There's something a bit more kind of, I would argue, somewhat more special about it as a physical work, perhaps. My good friend Carl sent this to me out of Munich. When Superman and Batman copyrights expire in a decade, will it be kryptonite for DC? So, of course, everybody was talking about steamboat Willie, which I still need to research on. My mum was telling me that it's not the same as Mickey Mouse, I guess, which is why you see a lot of steamboat Willie, but not necessarily Mickey Mouse. So here it will be Warner Brothers and DC Studios, which hold a firm grip on their intellectual property.
00:36:40.364 - 00:37:13.294, Speaker A: They. Here, let's get to the thing. Okay, here it is. Superman and Lois Lane will enter the public domain in 2034. So, feels like far away, but really, it's only ten years away. And when you think, like, 2014, I mean, that's actually not that far away before. Theoretically, we can all start making our own Superman movies, I think, followed by Batman in 2035 and the Joker in 2036 and Wonder Woman in 2037.
00:37:13.294 - 00:37:49.768, Speaker A: I mean, this is DC Comics, right? Like, I mean, this is like, that is DC Comics. I mean, add, like, you know, Aquaman and a few others, but, I mean, that is the heart and soul. We'll call it the heart and soul of DC Comics right here. So pretty interesting. And finally, Chris Sims, a comic book author and Batman expert, expects a flood of unauthorized Batman comics to hit stands as soon as the copyright expires. There's going to be a hundred of them. They're going to have their own ready to go movie producers will also be able to make their own versions, much as they already do with characters like Dracula and Robin Hood.
00:37:49.768 - 00:38:14.632, Speaker A: So it's kind of nice to see the law is actually working. I mean, if this indeed happens. But I mean, steamboat Willie is a nice example. Shows that in a place of law, that actually the law works. So kind of something to be optimistic about as we think of Jake studios kind of opening work there and people at war. Ezra Eslin. A very interesting piece here.
00:38:14.632 - 00:38:37.134, Speaker A: This came out on January 15. And this is part of a collection. Ezra Eslin, three one of ones so minted by Ezra Eslin to hide. Not exactly sure what the mechanics are of that. Like, ee 1465. Not exactly sure how that works. But let's look at the work, because I'm not sure if that's the same, if that's a.
00:38:37.134 - 00:38:57.074, Speaker A: Is that an addition type? You know, where it's. But it looks like it's a one of one. I'm not exactly sure. But all to say, here's just another kind of hilarious work here by Ezra Eslin. Let's see if we can zoom in a little bit here. There we go. And here you see this gruesome kind of.
00:38:57.074 - 00:39:27.698, Speaker A: It's like a. Again, a kind of gruesome satire here. This cleaning truck run amok, almost kind of feeding on a certain fear we might all have of these cleaning trucks running people down. I'm sure we've all seen, like, pretty aggressive, you know, street cleaners at some point in our lives. Interesting ghosts here and then people walking through. So you see all just the work. Ezra Eslund, out of Turkey, out of Istanbul, I believe.
00:39:27.698 - 00:39:42.774, Speaker A: And these witches around the fire. I mean, has an incredible, you know, detail. And here, these ghosts are in love with the strong guy and everything. Just really brilliant work here. There's Spider man. Pretty awesome. Coke and pizza.
00:39:42.774 - 00:40:13.506, Speaker A: Just wonderful and gruesome at the same time, but with a lot of humor in it. So just very, very cool work here from Ezra Eslund. Let's just see how it did. Or do we get interesting? I don't know how much it went for. I'm not sure what this minted by Ezra Eslin to hide. So again I see ee 1465 appear. I'm not sure if that's like an edition type that I don't know about a new edition type.
00:40:13.506 - 00:40:26.818, Speaker A: I'm not sure. Very interesting. Beautiful work. Gloomrican spirit by gloomtube. So I thought this was great here. A play on american spirit cigarettes. And there is the gloom tube guy with a cigarette there.
00:40:26.818 - 00:41:04.664, Speaker A: Surgeon general's warning, 100% real and interesting kind of double. I guess it's probably playing on the logo of the actual cigarettes there. Interesting on the ground here, almost a red, white and blue, interestingly at the stones. And here it looks like litter on the road, of course, because it is kind of a dystopian american dystopia here. And like the paint flecking away on the road there. The road paint, the traffic yellow paint there to show you where you can and can't go. Another brilliant work and beautiful work.
00:41:04.664 - 00:41:47.700, Speaker A: Again, kind of an interesting subject here, I might add. Just like the road and the pavement, I guess you'd call it seemingly. I mean, it kind of is gravelly, but you see what I'm saying. Really nice detail there and this contrast between this kind of artificial box here and, you know, nature a little bit. You get a kind of manipulated nature in these rocks in the road. Interesting work there from gloom tube as ever, Dana Ulama with another interesting kind of, kind of cyberpunk esque or vaporwave esque work here with the snow going past. Kind of a winter work here, going past the streetlight.
00:41:47.700 - 00:42:06.396, Speaker A: This is probably an older work. Yeah, exactly. The timing is spot on. Exactly. So cool work from Dana Ulama, but this was brilliant actually. I think oxen picked up one of these too on the scene here. This is by wasteman Goldman, of course.
00:42:06.396 - 00:42:25.416, Speaker A: And let me just show you the failed artist number. What do we got here? Number 64. Number 64. Self portrait as George Washington. George Washington, who it is believed was the first president of the United States. Hilarious. So this is pretty hilarious here.
00:42:25.416 - 00:42:55.614, Speaker A: So George Washington or the failed artist as George Washington, quite brilliantly painted, by the way. Again, see this wonderful contrast here? Brilliantly painted between the. Leaving some of it in this kind of flat digital and then having the texture in the other. I mean, it's beautiful. Look how beautiful this is. This is very beautiful. And then there's the wine.
00:42:55.614 - 00:43:15.350, Speaker A: Interesting. Just way of doing it. And of course, again, these iconic, like the cigarettes, the cast, you know, swearing about America, and then the hot dog and then the fries. I mean, all you. I'm surprised the fries weren't on the head, but this is great. We got the wig here. Just brilliant.
00:43:15.350 - 00:43:26.794, Speaker A: And having a smoke. Just brilliant. Brilliant piece. Three tazos edition of ten, still available. Might have to pick that up. Desolated. This is by Mota Mt.
00:43:26.794 - 00:43:58.604, Speaker A: And this is a digital painting in procreate. And here you see what looks like an urban scene here. And some nice textures in here from Moda Mt. Maybe this is Moda Mt himself as a character here. And just hanging out with the butterflies here. And the angels at this, you know, kind of what's probably an urban monument, you know, kind of almost a secular feeling. Secular, but hanging out with the angels there.
00:43:58.604 - 00:44:24.294, Speaker A: Nice texture in the sky, even. Nice kind of works of the paint coming down there and you see the birds and everything. So cool work there from Moda Mt. Interesting in the background there too. These are five tezos each and oxyn on the scene. Again, that is great. You know, it's great in a tough market when you have the tezos to spend it around.
00:44:24.294 - 00:44:40.938, Speaker A: It's a nice thing to do. So hat tip to Aksine there. Desolated. So this is by Moda Mt. Cool work there. Milky Rider, Katerina create. So another work here, of course, we started with Katarina, I think, on Monday.
00:44:40.938 - 00:45:05.844, Speaker A: And here instead of a horse, we have a cow and a woman on the cow. Again, kind of surreal here with the. With the flour coming out of the nipple here. So interesting. And then you see the milk, and then it's on a cow. So isn't that interesting? And there is more milk and the cow maybe in puddles of milk. So interesting work here.
00:45:05.844 - 00:45:25.390, Speaker A: And then kind of nice touch there with the bow on the tail. And again, the flowers, you know, punning on the petals here. There's a visual pun. You see the petals. This kind of looks like a petal, but it also looks like milk or drip. A drip. Right.
00:45:25.390 - 00:45:38.794, Speaker A: So interesting there too. So just more cool work. Nice texture and everything. I think this is a one of one. This is available for 30 tazos. One of one milky rider. Very interesting piece.
00:45:38.794 - 00:46:01.746, Speaker A: And, oh, it sold. Oh, it sold for 15 on primary and going on secondary for 30 tezos. So nice sale there. And here's a cool drawing by Santiago. 45 minutes in, we gotta speed up here. Very cool drawing here from Santiago on object. So just kind of nice, kind of abstract.
00:46:01.746 - 00:46:11.522, Speaker A: Seemingly abstract. Mark making smile at night. Always a good title. Inverted pen drawing. Interesting. They look great. Smooth move.
00:46:11.522 - 00:46:36.948, Speaker A: Inverting it. And auction cancelled and then burned. So maybe made a new addition or not. Not sure. A five, interestingly, which is quite a small. You know. You know how you get a five is you fold up a four, you know, a four paper printing paper, you fold it in half, you get a five, you fold it again, you get a six, a seven, and then the opposite to get the other sizes.
00:46:36.948 - 00:46:53.684, Speaker A: If you've ever wondered. Most people know that, but if you don't, it's good to know. I didn't learn that until fairly recently, actually. You have to work with paper before you start to figure that one out. OMG, I draw it. Recipes for disaster, zero. One interesting piece here.
00:46:53.684 - 00:47:22.494, Speaker A: Probably hanging well with Ezra Eslin here as we see the person maybe drunk, passed out. There's the alcohol and recipes for disaster here, as we see. Would hang well with our opening piece there too, wouldn't it? Just on a thematic basis. Also kind of illustrative. So interesting there and really nice. And we see the drinks that maybe have been drunk earlier in the night. And then here, the chaos at home, maybe coming home.
00:47:22.494 - 00:47:39.704, Speaker A: And what does that say? Coffee liqueur. That sounds dangerous. Very dangerous. And so we're very gonna. Interesting work here. Recipes for disaster, edition of 30. And looks like sold out except offers at 35, 34, 33.
00:47:39.704 - 00:47:50.020, Speaker A: OMG. Drawed it. I mean, doing very, very well here. Impressive. And of course, you can probably guess who this is. Cider with a beautiful still life here. A bowl of fruit.
00:47:50.020 - 00:48:03.376, Speaker A: I think it might be a collab. Still life. Fun collab with color Charlie. So color Charlie, I think, worked with this, too. Very cool piece here from cider. Very nice. Just posted on Twitter.
00:48:03.376 - 00:48:25.636, Speaker A: Not sure if it's going to be posted anywhere. I am trying to follow people on foundation now. So I was very slow. I didn't follow anybody because there were too many platforms. Now I'm starting to just hopefully, hopefully just track things a little better here. Jacko. Randah Hart, Jan Lucas Migone.
00:48:25.636 - 00:48:39.684, Speaker A: So this came out. So it wasn't the work that I thought it was the other day in the promo playing off of. Who's that? St. Sebastian with the arrows. You know, kind of a classic of italian art there. And. And, yeah.
00:48:39.684 - 00:49:01.584, Speaker A: And here it is. He's but shooting and the light coming out. Interesting work here. And look at this. Look at how great objects Zoom is working here. You see all the details here and they're this kind of powerful image here of a Saint Sebastian figure. And, you know, is the angel taking out the.
00:49:01.584 - 00:49:22.328, Speaker A: It looks like taking out the arrows and the light pouring out. So very interesting work. Kind of almost impressionistic here. Has a bit of a Monet, bit of a pissarro kind of feel to it here. And really nice brushwork here, isn't there? Yeah. So zooming in. Quite powerful, this piece here.
00:49:22.328 - 00:49:35.608, Speaker A: And so what happened? Jerecanda's heart. Something. I feel hurt in my. Sometimes I feel hurt in my digital self edition of 30 for 25. And let's just see. Is this. This is sold out.
00:49:35.608 - 00:49:48.116, Speaker A: So nice work here from Jan Lukes Migon. Selling out at ten tezos each. So nice. Cool. 300 tezos. Nice work. Nub 1914.
00:49:48.116 - 00:50:11.532, Speaker A: Kind of a different subject matter today, isn't there? Buenas tardes. So a house here with some steps, a car. And so here we are up close and personal with Nov 1914. So very cool work here. Nice touch on the stairs, making them kind of crooked. Love the flowers. Just super interesting.
00:50:11.532 - 00:50:32.826, Speaker A: Interesting white background there too. And this outrageous blue gradient here. Sneaking in. And again, what looks like maybe a car, a nice kind of irrational car here. Beautiful. Must be art here is another one, Lusis one. So just such a cool artist.
00:50:32.826 - 00:50:44.208, Speaker A: Nuv. 1914. So it looks like some flowers here. Just awesome. Again, outrageous white to green gradient there. But it works. And then more just almost like clouds here.
00:50:44.208 - 00:51:04.440, Speaker A: Spraying on the side. And what is going on here? Kind of like a tree with some abstraction, you know, maybe just some abstraction at the bottom. Wild work here. Selling for nine tezos to Emilia Versace going to her vault. And Lord Neutron, this I saw on Instagram. Interesting piece here. Colors in motion.
00:51:04.440 - 00:51:20.760, Speaker A: So it looks like kind of a skull eating this little cube here. So interesting there. And showing the black and white. That is cool. Very cool. So interesting piece there. Lord neutron Zed, dove of peace.
00:51:20.760 - 00:52:00.094, Speaker A: So playing with the drone here and playing also with the recognition, kind of like facial recognition or just security camera recognition, AI recognition. A very interesting piece with an interesting. Almost like animalistic spirit here. Playing with. Almost like we were commenting on rare, the ghost and the machine to a certain degree. It's almost like the spirit of the animal here, of this technological animal. And they're interestingly a weapon at the bottom there.
00:52:00.094 - 00:52:15.860, Speaker A: A missile. So interesting piece. Dove of peace, perhaps ambiguous here is ambiguous title. Luciana guerra, dancing with my monsters. Toot. Nice piece here. This is an experimental drawing made with different techniques.
00:52:15.860 - 00:52:33.628, Speaker A: I used AI with my own work to create textures in my style. Then I reworked it with a collage process and finally painted digitally on Photoshop. And this is the result. A creepy scene with some monsters that live in my nightmares. Just get some water. So pretty nice work. A nice solution here.
00:52:33.628 - 00:52:57.956, Speaker A: Keeping the black and white for the drawing and then doing all the fill with yellow here. So, you know, it's been 286 shows, maybe 276 videos. It's the second time I think I've had water here. Dancing with my monsters. So ten tezos. And that is an edition of ten. Here's Dan Control.
00:52:57.956 - 00:53:36.190, Speaker A: And this is quite interesting. Cigarettes, e cigarettes, lighters, batteries. Everything starts and revolves around a 16 by nine. So using the 16 x nine, you know, kind of HD format here now, interestingly, maybe to put on tvs for display, perhaps the screen's positioned in a physical and tangible space for existing works that can only be seen through those screens themselves. Part of 16 nine exhibition at expanded art showroom in Berlin. I think the opening was actually a couple of days ago here in Berlin. So that's pretty interesting.
00:53:36.190 - 00:53:58.754, Speaker A: Would have been nice to meet Dan. And what is. And these, I think are some sort of smoke. I think that's a vaporizer. And here's lighters. So pretty smart to use, you know, again, if you're going to display on tvs, you might as well start there and then work accordingly. And especially with Dan's work.
00:53:58.754 - 00:54:15.286, Speaker A: So again, here is more. I thought this was a brilliant piece here. First solo exhibition at expanded art showroom in Berlin. 20 new artworks on display till January 26. So I should go check that out. And here's some cigarette. So quite brilliant.
00:54:15.286 - 00:54:34.554, Speaker A: I don't know what it's supposed to represent, and maybe I'm totally missing it. Like, I remember the fries, which were kind of risque, or the fry. This one, I'm not as sure what it's supposed to be, but it looks really cool. Kind of has a Rauschenberg feel to it. Let's continue. Rinny Fish. Stay safe, friends.
00:54:34.554 - 00:54:56.246, Speaker A: So, of course, go support Rinny Fish, who was unfortunately hacked in her wallet. And make sure to follow her new account. These are really cool works here. And she has another one. Fish core is real. So playing with fish, of course, working a lot with bugs. And here is some new work, I think, playing with fish, fish core.
00:54:56.246 - 00:55:11.958, Speaker A: And almost like a crying fish here. So really great work here, as usual. And this is on object, actually. Let's load it up quickly here. And Tezo, South beach. So this is from December 1. And psychedelic fish here.
00:55:11.958 - 00:55:30.542, Speaker A: And I think this is all sold out on primary. So you can get on secondary for 776. Great work there. And moshit, cynic cat. So this is on Zora. I thought this was a pretty cool work. 14 minted.
00:55:30.542 - 00:55:43.650, Speaker A: Pretty good actually. And just nice work here from movie. Uh. Shit. Just I thought a pretty nice piece uh, here. And continuing on walk. That was on Zora.
00:55:43.650 - 00:55:58.978, Speaker A: Here's walk. I think continuing the September 11 thing. Doesn't that look like building seven? Like it's weird. It's like these shadows, you. But they. They're familiar, these familiar recognizable shadows. Just a really cool, uh, series here.
00:55:58.978 - 00:56:13.352, Speaker A: Hans gets the auction there for five tezos. Get a walk. One of one on the cheap here if you're lucky. Drive safe. Glitchtown arcade. So a couple of Nintendo glitch roms from Glitchtown arcade. Interesting one here.
00:56:13.352 - 00:56:26.044, Speaker A: I've never actually seen this game before with this interface here like this. Unless maybe I have. But I think it was a different driving game. I've seen drive safe. So anyways. Ninety nine cents. And this is an edition of 30.
00:56:26.044 - 00:56:40.318, Speaker A: Very cool. And I thought this was kind of smart. I'm not going to leave it on too long because it's kind of edgy or flashy. Shall we say free fall. This is ninety nine cents. And it is selling. This is an edition of 30 as well.
00:56:40.318 - 00:56:58.566, Speaker A: And this is Kyle Flemmer. So another interesting piece here. Gone basin. Made from a screen recording of basin black bass with Hank Parker for snes. Glitched with real time corruptors. So let's look at that full screen here. So more interesting Nintendo glitch roms from Kyle Flemmer as well.
00:56:58.566 - 00:57:23.354, Speaker A: An interesting map in the background too, who made that wonderful Dorothy piece the other day. So also selling well for edition of 40 for $0.50 each. And here playing off the video game theme, two is, I think this chaz. This is Chaz. Superbike. So again, moving from the laptop and retro computer to the retro arcade.
00:57:23.354 - 00:57:39.034, Speaker A: A good. A smooth. A brilliant pivot actually. And here we have a celebrating the arcade with a superbike game. And this is two tazos, an edition of 15. Let's continue here. Mandel, good Friday to you.
00:57:39.034 - 00:58:17.014, Speaker A: I don't know if this has been minted, but I thought it looked pretty cool. Almost in a camera shop there. And you see the cat is posing and gets the picture taken here. So just an awesome pixel artist Mandal, who of course does the cat tarot, which I think will live on speaking of transcending time there, I think that one could live on for a while. Muji with an interesting work here at the gate. So this is using deluxe paint, two emulated on a laptop, among other processes. This is tentezos and edition of ten.
00:58:17.014 - 00:58:52.234, Speaker A: So nice colors here. And playing with different kinds of animation here. Nice dithered gradient at the bottom there. Very cool. And here's another one by Violet Tripp. And I am saying the name right according to Violet, last comment there I saw second stage audio visual loop with eight colors. Let me make sure I'm playing this pretty wild work.
00:58:52.234 - 00:59:30.164, Speaker A: I have to be careful when I stop the videos. I've actually stopped the entire stream here if I'm not careful. So using stable diffusion AI, interestingly, Adobe Photoshop illustrator after effects spine pro fl studio. So using a lot of different softwares here, exporting as Sky Goodman loves to do as well. So very cool piece here. Coming out of a window, interesting dithered gradient in the background. A lot going on in this work to get there.
00:59:30.164 - 00:59:46.976, Speaker A: An interesting bug. Kind of fusion of a woman and a bug here. Interesting piece. This was kind of a, kind of has me mystified right now. This retigo tego dago come and travel through the most unexpected places in the purple world. Ed Marolla. So I think this is a new account.
00:59:46.976 - 01:00:21.486, Speaker A: I'm not sure clearly Ed Marolla's work. And this has the theme song to friends, so I'm not going to play it for copyright reasons here, but you see it going through all these different people. So just kind of fun mayhem that Ed Marolla is up to there. Element ly with. More very interesting pixel art here, experimental pixel art. Commuting, free expansion of graphic edges. I mean, kind of feels like a pizza, the shape of a pizza with a car and a woman, seemingly.
01:00:21.486 - 01:01:10.486, Speaker A: And just some interesting work. Again, this is experimental pixel art made on an iPhone or made on a phone, I believe. Super cool artist here, pixel drawings with mobile phone and expanding to multiple physical media, keeping it interesting and looking out of China, I'm actually not sure what flag that is. Very interesting at the door, more interesting. Again, just like super experimental. But there's something about element Li's work that really holds together 256 by 256. Again, what do I see here? This is crying out for ordinals, in my humble opinion here, isn't this, you know, someone messaged me, I think it was actually Pixel lord who was saying, you know this.
01:01:10.486 - 01:01:37.784, Speaker A: Yeah, the pixel artists could do really well on ordinals, I suspect you're right. Pixel Lord. Here's another great one by element Ly Carr, 256 by 200. And here, just another just super interesting piece here by this brilliant artist. You know, as someone I've worked on the phone a ton, it's still. I was working this morning on the phone. It is still my favorite, you know, compositional tool.
01:01:37.784 - 01:02:16.504, Speaker A: And there's something very special, I would argue about working on a phone, and I think you see it in element Ly's work, because you're working on such a small canvas size, like, literally the. The size of your phone. Of course, you can zoom in, so it's not an issue for detail. But when you're composing stuff, it's much different than if you have a big canvas, let's say, in a physical work, where you're like, you're not going to have these massive brush strokes. So I argue, and I think I've written this in, like, essays from way back when. It creates a much. A very fragile, fresh compositional.
01:02:16.504 - 01:02:35.948, Speaker A: It creates a very fresh way of making compositions. And I think we see it here with element li. Like, it's. It's not just a, you know, because I've had people say, you know, many years ago, oh, that's just a toy. It's like, no, it's not. And especially newer phones. But even back then, this is.
01:02:35.948 - 01:02:53.898, Speaker A: It's not just a novelty thing. Like, oh, isn't that cute? You work on the phone. Oh, I guess that's your story now. It's like, no, there is visual. It has visual payoff, and it creates a much. It creates a fresh kind of compositional style. It's much easier to create fresh images, I would argue.
01:02:53.898 - 01:03:39.590, Speaker A: And I think we see it here, don't we? You know, like, there's a simplicity that comes from these works. And again, and I guess just to further the point, would these be made on an iPad? Maybe? Would they be made in photoshop? I kind of doubt it. I think you'd have a different kind of composition, probably a bigger composition with more stuff going on. Would they be paintings? Would you make this with a paint? You know, would you paint, like, this kind of composition? I don't think so. I think it's the result of the phone continuing on. Of course, you know, this artist Kappin contemplation with beautiful work here. This is an open edition, only four minted.
01:03:39.590 - 01:04:17.134, Speaker A: You got to be careful with the open editions because sometimes people think, oh, open edition, not as collectible, because a whole bunch will be minted, and then a lot of people end up not minting it. So probably like only four minted here, two days to go. And then sometimes they fly under the radar because so much great art is coming out. And then you miss out a cap and that's an addition of six or something. Beautiful work here from cap. And just, you know, as you see here, just someone looking over, kind of a wanderer figure, the Delvander at night, you know, looking over at the moon. Contemplation.
01:04:17.134 - 01:04:53.520, Speaker A: Beautiful work, nicely priced. More brilliance from Kappn. Here's another one from Kappen under the figments banner here under the name of figments. Same artist, chorus and feedback. So another abstract, interestingly, from cap in here, and playing with these older kind of horizontal pixels, black amp, chorus and feedback, kind of a musical theme here. And of course, Kappen was a musician, I think, before really diving into nfts out of Costa Rica. Check out the Twitter space we did way back a few months ago.
01:04:53.520 - 01:05:09.152, Speaker A: It was really good space. Nicholas Sassoon, another RGB study, seems impossible to get properly compressed. Yeah. So struggling with the compression here on x. So. But you kind of get the gist of it. Interesting studies here from Nicholas Sassoon.
01:05:09.152 - 01:05:27.494, Speaker A: These animated abstracts. Sean Luke, we've got to speed up here a little bit. Locked out. So interesting. Kind of looks like a skull on a stick or a key. A skull on a key. So kind of a wild work there with this kind of hallucinatory frame here.
01:05:27.494 - 01:05:53.254, Speaker A: The whole thing is hallucinatory. Locked out by Sean Luke 150 tezos already three sold at 150 tezos, each. Incredible El Crego black mass video version. Full info below. So here, black mass. So kind of a preview here, as you see. So kind of an animated abstract in black and white from El Crego.
01:05:53.254 - 01:06:11.754, Speaker A: So interesting piece here. And I guess black mass is the title. And look at that. So very interesting here. And here are older versions. I'm not sure if this. I'm not sure if this just came out or not.
01:06:11.754 - 01:06:40.100, Speaker A: And maybe that's all for put into one piece. Actually, it's probably what's going on here. So interesting. Maybe it's for the series cream safa posting this. Not sure if this is old or new either, but I haven't seen it before either. So interesting piece here from cream Safa, who of course does those wonderful pixel art factories that many of us know and love. Lucas Lejeune with some more interesting abstracts here.
01:06:40.100 - 01:07:10.184, Speaker A: So here, some spheres, circles, kind of dancing around each other, doing a lot of very, very interesting stuff here. Lucas Lejeune, check this out, remember, I think we saw just yesterday, or it was the day before. There's all sorts of work Lucas Lejeune is putting out. What was it, the decrypt encryption or something? That one was spectacular. These are all very, very interesting. I mean, it looks like programming, doesn't it? So just very interesting gifs here. Here's another one.
01:07:10.184 - 01:07:57.822, Speaker A: And again, playing with that square in the background almost makes you dizzy. So very cool work. And here's one more gm, interesting, kind of flashing light right in the middle there. So interesting work. I suspect this is programming. Let's just go on, Lucas, out of the loop. So not exactly sure, but putting out a lot of work on exchange foundation object, maybe, you know, if that is, if these are, you know, JavaScript, P five J s, or if this is like, you know, you might want to take a page out of Acid boy's playbook there on gamma, you know, or, you know, try minting an ordinal.
01:07:57.822 - 01:08:21.296, Speaker A: If it's only a few lines of JavaScript, it's probably very, very cheap. Let's continue. Impostor time is the wisest counselor of all. A nice work here, a really cool work. Kind of a grandfather clock here, made of letters and numbers. And you got to love the hands here of the time. Beautifully done from impostor.
01:08:21.296 - 01:08:48.526, Speaker A: Nice post. And here is Strano. Okay, last tweet. So collaborating with Gonzo, I think here, here it is. Yeah, Gozo, sorry, uncertain gaze. Major, thank you to all collectors, bidders, likers, sharers and commenters. Really happy with the feedback we got on this one, but can anyone hear the silent concert there? So interesting piece here, combining of all people, gozo and Strano.
01:08:48.526 - 01:09:07.174, Speaker A: Great collab here. Very, very interesting. Only possible with those two climbing together to see a work like that. Exponential. Op art in motion. I just thought this was really beautiful, kind of a beautiful color injection here. Op art in motion.
01:09:07.174 - 01:09:55.194, Speaker A: Now isn't that interesting? Isn't that interesting? Op art in motion, because this really does describe so much of what I call animated abstraction that occurs on the blockchain, and because a lot of it really, this is a very interesting way of describing it. And of course, op art for the most part doesn't move, right. I mean, it's mostly from the 1960s, mostly put on painted on canvas. Another study of Jean Pierre Yvarl. So maybe taking, you know, adding movement to perhaps this is an AWP artist that I don't know about. Interesting, interesting. Clint, a new new area forum for discussion.
01:09:55.194 - 01:10:13.334, Speaker A: Clint Fulkerson intersection. So more interesting. What looks like programmed art. This is by Clint Fulkerson. Just interesting work there. And just simple colors there, too. Just but effective and beautiful and original, I might add.
01:10:13.334 - 01:10:25.458, Speaker A: So interesting work there. Intersection. Nice title. Digital roadmap. This is Renato Marini. And just a very interesting piece here, too. Love the digital roadmap.
01:10:25.458 - 01:10:50.530, Speaker A: Love the title. And kind of you get this illusion that we've seen in a few works here. See if we can zoom in here. Not sure I can, but a pretty interesting piece here. Kind of makes you a little dizzy and a lot of kind of flashing lights, but not overly fast here, so it's a little easier to consume. Digital compositing optical illusion. Interesting.
01:10:50.530 - 01:11:14.182, Speaker A: Corruption valley. This is a first in a new collaboration between Glitchtown and de, his science art. Nice piece. Another glitchtown arcade work with de his science, if I'm pronouncing that right. Love the sky, love the whole thing. Love how there's kind of collage here and then mixing with this. Just kind of wild, patterned, digitally patterned sky.
01:11:14.182 - 01:11:39.502, Speaker A: Interesting combination, again of collage and pixelation, even what I'd loosely call pixelation in the screen. Nice contrast. And even going behind the horse here. An interesting treatment of the horse, right? Leaving some areas covered, some areas not this kind of space night. All interesting here. Great color, too, by the way. This orange with the green.
01:11:39.502 - 01:11:52.878, Speaker A: A lot works here. Even the blue of the mountains. Nice piece. And this is five tezos each. Looks like maybe sold out here. Sold out. Nice work on primary in a tough market.
01:11:52.878 - 01:12:18.426, Speaker A: Good work. Shepperton, who I believe we had the. The ordinals tweet at the beginning of the episode erosion, two raw, abstract glitch composition inspired by some geological landscapes in Crozon, which is the french Brittany. So interesting. Abstract here. Would hang well with some brawn works, wouldn't it? So nice piece there. And that's on tezos.
01:12:18.426 - 01:12:39.790, Speaker A: It is a edition of 1065 tezos on secondary. So one left. That's pretty good prices. So let me just very, very quickly see the history here. Selling at 65 tezos each. I mean, that's impressive. Francois Gamma, 800 by 600 composition here.
01:12:39.790 - 01:12:56.714, Speaker A: Interesting title for a work. Again, you see, it fits almost perfectly. Almost perfectly. My screen here, that's the kind of ratio I go for here. So kind of a different work from Francois Gamma here. Nice colorful work. And let's continue here.
01:12:56.714 - 01:13:16.822, Speaker A: This is Santiago with improps work. So series, asymmetric poetry, variations of a vector painting. So creating all these different variations here. So interesting series here. If I was to just pick one. I mean, let me pick this guy. Kind of has a nice pixelation feel to it.
01:13:16.822 - 01:13:37.734, Speaker A: We'll see if it loads up. And I have to be careful here, because Santiago's works are known in my mind to crash my computer when I am recording here, and it doesn't seem to be loading up. Here we go. Because sometimes they're so large. Here we go. Interesting. So using m props here to create a kind of abstract series.
01:13:37.734 - 01:13:59.386, Speaker A: Super prolific artist here. Exponential with another one here. Another beautiful, animated, abstract, kind of awkward ish, I guess. If there's no illusion, is it. If there's no kind of trip, if it doesn't trip you up optically, is it op art? There's my question for you. Okay, let's continue. Lorna Mills.
01:13:59.386 - 01:14:18.296, Speaker A: The thing I love about the movement of this piece. So this is someone else. NbsW wit generative artist. Quite a few followers here. Generative art does pretty well on x. And so pretty interesting piece here. Let's see what Lorna Mills says about it.
01:14:18.296 - 01:14:41.204, Speaker A: Things I love about the movement in this piece is how the smooth slides get punctuated by a small machine convulsion. Right. It almost feels like a printer or something in terms of its rhythm. Kind of restarting there every few seconds. Sui soishi yonaguni is the name of this piece. Let me see if there's volume here. There is no volume.
01:14:41.204 - 01:15:01.952, Speaker A: Pretty cool piece, isn't it? I mean, pretty wild piece. Kind of looks like japanese writing, perhaps at the top there in this wild kind of space here. A very wild, just kind of pixel artwork by Sue Soshi. I think we have another one here. Another wild work. The cat was originally cute and happy. It was also sarcastic.
01:15:01.952 - 01:15:20.874, Speaker A: Now they're just bored. That's the new century attitude. And here, I guess you see the cats. There's a cat here. Very interesting piece here. The composition, the ratio of this canvas is totally wild, and I love it. Artifact number 75 by Mika Oladev.
01:15:20.874 - 01:15:54.620, Speaker A: And here, just another, I'm not sure. I think we actually, we saw a similar one playing with these kind of soft gradients in the background that are still cycling through, contrasting with these kind of sharp digital cubes. Artifact number 75. This is 65 tazos on primary. And here is Renki with a work called Kami. Playing with the, you know, animated work here, playing with the circle, playing with volume and the square, and kind of combining the two works here. Super interesting.
01:15:54.620 - 01:16:13.556, Speaker A: 90 tezos on primary. One of one. Let's continue here. A very cool collaboration here by Retro Manny and Oxdither or dither, this is 750. Super retro singularity. I love this piece here. As you see.
01:16:13.556 - 01:16:26.688, Speaker A: Retro Manny's video game here on the retro tv. Let's just look at the stickers here. And here they are. Dither times. Retro Manny. Retro Manny games. This is just ready to go here.
01:16:26.688 - 01:16:41.944, Speaker A: Retro man universe. We got the comics. Tezos outpost 2049. Just very, very. It's a perfect. It's a collaboration which was meant to be like a perfect collaboration. The retro tv with Retro Manny's work here.
01:16:41.944 - 01:16:57.474, Speaker A: And there goes the spaceship simulation. Error 750 edition of 20. Let's just see how it's doing here. There are 13 left, so selling nicely. Nikita. Open edition on mint fun. So remember times base.
01:16:57.474 - 01:17:14.470, Speaker A: So of course base is coinbases. Layer two on ethereum. Maybe mint fun is cross chain. NFT projects cross chain. So they work with Zora and base. Interestingly, you know, these new block. Not new, I guess base is a new blockchain.
01:17:14.470 - 01:17:34.898, Speaker A: Sometimes there's opportunities there. Minting on these new blockchains. Cool work. Because often they'll have their own kind of advocates, their own programmers who maybe want to buy some art and they're trying to encourage art. So they'll come and buy your art. You know, you kind of have a audience and maybe it's not as competitive. All to say, a pretty cool piece here.
01:17:34.898 - 01:18:02.936, Speaker A: Kind of has a bit of an AI feel to it. Interesting to put text, text prompt there at the top left. Here's kind of a similar work. New piece for super chief NFT for the mall's closing vaporwave exhibition in New York January 23 on Foundation Worlds. So a little bit of volume here. Kind of sounds like rain and some windows that are escaping the screen here. Very cool work here from kid.
01:18:02.936 - 01:18:16.142, Speaker A: Gorgeous NFT. I don't think I'm familiar with them. Let's continue. Tug can, 190 bpm. This is an edition of 19. So just a screen capture of a analog video glitch. Nice textures there.
01:18:16.142 - 01:18:32.734, Speaker A: Great colors. Cool title, tug can. And here's innovare again. And this might be an older work, not sure. Kind of looks like blueberry cheesecake. But those textures are delicious, aren't they? They're beautiful. Look at the colors again.
01:18:32.734 - 01:18:53.740, Speaker A: The texture on this analog video glitch is beautiful. Speaking of beautiful, look at this work by Sabato. Raw skies 44. Going for for on exchange by now. Interestingly. When was this minted? A month ago. Okay, so really nice piece.
01:18:53.740 - 01:19:21.218, Speaker A: Let's let it load up here. There it is. A very subtle work here. Which I think is taking raw. What is it? Canon five D Mark II Cr two raw image format data bending glitch photograph of the western Massachusetts sunset taken at Mount Sugarloaf in Massachusetts, autumn of 2015. Always wonderfully documented here by Sabato. Great description there.
01:19:21.218 - 01:19:33.906, Speaker A: Inspiring description from Sabbato there. Beautiful work as well. Composition 79. So Klaus is still on the trail of these gorgeous compositions. And here, as we see. Let's try. See if we can.
01:19:33.906 - 01:19:59.014, Speaker A: Okay, that is the zoom in here. And interesting, kind of black and white. Well, there's a little bit of color there, but just interesting work here in this abstract. Here's another one, again, kind of playing, though, a little bit with desaturated, just black and white and contrasting it with these beautiful colors here. And this is number 82, 24 tezos. Here is another one, again, kind of almost desaturated. Just a little bit of color.
01:19:59.014 - 01:20:15.906, Speaker A: Another super interesting composition here in this wonderful series. These are gifts, I might add. This sold to spritz for 24 tezos. And here's another one. Composition 81 for 40 tezos. That must be on secondary selling to. I'm atros for 27.
01:20:15.906 - 01:20:28.314, Speaker A: So the prices continue to rise here with Klaus. Beautiful composition series. And here's. Actually, I think we looked at this one. We saw that one already. Awesome. Okay.
01:20:28.314 - 01:21:01.434, Speaker A: And this is Elly Pritz. In the screen, I am everything. So let's see if there's volume here. And so this is a minute long, so we can't go through the whole thing. Kind of has a bit of an AI feel to it, doesn't it? But, you know, almost like, if I had to guess, and I don't know, it almost looks like AI kind of animation, but put through the video glitch process, which I think adds a lot in the screen, I am everything. Kind of poetic words there, too. Perhaps a self portrait and great glitching there too.
01:21:01.434 - 01:21:18.514, Speaker A: And kind of several kind of multiple portraits at the same time. Seemingly. So this is meant for four ETH. Interesting. So a one of one on Zora for four ETH in the screen. I am everything. Very cool.
01:21:18.514 - 01:21:39.904, Speaker A: Kika nikolayla. So this is part of the new series on exchange art. And so just a really cool AI series here, I think. Based on memory, I'm happy to announce my series mnemonics is going multi chain. So ten new one of one pieces on exchange art. Happy to try Solana again. All reserves at one Sol minimum bid.
01:21:39.904 - 01:21:57.320, Speaker A: So very cool work here. Here's another one. So beautiful AI artworks by Kika Nikolay la. And great. I love the white, just like the simple background here. And this kind of. Again, kind of almost like a Rauschenberg sort of feel to it.
01:21:57.320 - 01:22:20.104, Speaker A: Beautiful here is Skomra with a tree. A very interesting, one of a kind tree here, as we can see. Interesting. Kind of keeping it down to just, I want to say, like one color here. I guess it's white as well. This purple and white tree, again, would be interesting. We were seeing mech Txt screen print earlier.
01:22:20.104 - 01:22:39.646, Speaker A: This could be interesting. I guess you'd have to give it like a strong contrast. But then it's just one color screen print. So is this. Oh, this was beautiful, too. I actually really love the black and white here, too. And again, it almost looks like a drawing of sorts, this AI drawing with this great texture in here, of this.
01:22:39.646 - 01:22:53.300, Speaker A: Another kind of playing with the, you know, person. Probably a woman at the laptop here. And maybe the camera is on. Not sure. Just beautiful work from Skamra. Beautiful AI artwork. Surreal sanctuary.
01:22:53.300 - 01:23:12.564, Speaker A: This is by Tuks here, as we are at the almost wrapping up here. This is 100 tezos. So got a one of one tuques here for 100 tezos. Some more. Just interesting work here, as you can see. Pretty big file and great color here. I'd say pretty recognizable.
01:23:12.564 - 01:23:26.736, Speaker A: Definitely recognizable as a tuques work. Just in the composition. Even the texture kind of looks like an interior. This great yellow border there, too. Surreal sanctuary. Another great title, maybe with the help of AI. Here's Lily Illo.
01:23:26.736 - 01:23:44.149, Speaker A: Child's drawings is sometimes where I want to return. So maybe a drawing of. From one of the kids here. And then these brilliant chairs here with an architect. Again, kind of has the blueprint feel to it on this one here. Cool work from Lily. Illogical.
01:23:44.149 - 01:24:08.270, Speaker A: And here, lakeside rebellion by Okote. Kind of a different take from this global on the global south series. A different kind of painterly style here. Pretty interesting. I'm trying to think of what it reminds me of and I'm having a tough time placing it. But interesting textures here. And again, kind of these hoods, so to speak, on the characters here.
01:24:08.270 - 01:24:23.808, Speaker A: Or on the subjects of this painting. With kind of like a spear, but made of plants. Always in the water here, too. Interesting. Lakeside rebellion. Silent warriors massed in defiance wield spears by the tranquil lake. Continuing on.
01:24:23.808 - 01:24:43.790, Speaker A: I think this is Shili Preston here, who I do follow. That is a Twitter bug. Pikachu and Peter Rabbit at lunch. And here we see classic McDonald's theme. And Pikachu and Peter Rabbit. Beautifully AI painted, I suspect, from Shilly Preston. Just awesome piece, this is von Doyle.
01:24:43.790 - 01:25:01.834, Speaker A: And I think this is AI as well. It is sleeper. One eye sees, the other feels. Paul clay. So very cool work here. Interesting ratio to canvas ratio. Kind of has a bit of a leonardo feel over in this area in terms of the composition.
01:25:01.834 - 01:25:24.080, Speaker A: Interesting piece here with this kind of, for lack of better term, deconstructed woman. And here it is. Ten tezos each and addition of ten. And we have to go back to that work here. Let's go. Here we go. As we wrap up here.
01:25:24.080 - 01:25:34.824, Speaker A: This was brilliant. We can't miss this. Emil at improps. Goodnight. I think something really good is happening here. I totally agree. Something beautiful is happening here.
01:25:34.824 - 01:25:46.220, Speaker A: I don't know what's going on either. But this orange sky and this blue. The color, the texture, everything. This is looking great. Still need to try out improps. Groundhog Day star. Of course.
01:25:46.220 - 01:26:02.408, Speaker A: This is no hygiene. You may recognize this artist at this point. It's starting to become like a trademark. It is a trademark style for sure. This is an edition of one selling for 14 tazos. So another sale here for no hygiene, who's doing really well. Here's a work by Sabato.
01:26:02.408 - 01:26:24.564, Speaker A: Coupe de Grasse. So playing on the pun of a car coupe. So beautiful AI work here. I love the colors on it. And again, usually there's a person in autotopia documenting humans and their cars. This one probably just turned out so well that Sabeto went with it. Maybe there's a human in there somewhere.
01:26:24.564 - 01:26:38.082, Speaker A: Nice piece. This sold for 25 tezos to Mikey Wilson. One of one. And here is Martin Jo with another cool GM. Goodnight. This is a great piece here. This is AI.
01:26:38.082 - 01:26:56.902, Speaker A: And you see the bear theme of course. Martin Joe. Nice series here. I don't know if it's ever been minted, this entire Goodnight Bears series. But very cool Anadark AI braces, as you see. So Anadark putting out a new AI piece which is great to see. And you see the braces here and the AI.
01:26:56.902 - 01:27:12.634, Speaker A: So just a cool work. Woman smoking a cigarette. And this is an AI art weekly issue number 67. Part of the COVID So nice. Nice work there. And this sold for 77 tezos. Great sale to Semdron.
01:27:12.634 - 01:27:36.904, Speaker A: Nice work there. And as we get into the physical, this is Alice Maudsley illustrates. So now a few originals available in the vintage can series screen print series. Thank you so much. So this looks like it's manually painted but I'm not sure. It looks like she's turning that into screen prints. Or maybe starts with screen prints and paints over top.
01:27:36.904 - 01:27:59.778, Speaker A: It's a beautiful, it looks great, if you ask me. A very, very nice series here and 82,000 followers. Yeah. So probably a big deal somewhere with a lot of people there. Helio Santos. So I think we were looking earlier in the episode at the pen plotter at work. Here's just more evidence of what's going on.
01:27:59.778 - 01:28:43.518, Speaker A: I'm really liking these kind of landscapes that are getting so worked over that they almost turn into abstracts. They look beautiful. Continuing on nugget brain with another brilliant work here with this kind of retro video camera showing this beautiful, you know, palm tree poster, beach poster on the scene with this brilliant background, great texture. A brilliant, so good, as this person says here, this is going to be at Albert Contemporary. Let's see where they are in our final minutes here. Not exactly sure where Albert contemporary is, unfortunately, they don't say, but very interesting. And this is Alina artist.
01:28:43.518 - 01:29:01.994, Speaker A: Two more layers and I'll finish the prints reduction. Linocuts. Linocets of zinnias. So this is pretty advanced linocuts, if you ask me. This is very well done. Some people are very good at this process. See, there's almost no like artifacts.
01:29:01.994 - 01:29:33.578, Speaker A: Pretty impressive here. Let's continue. Artsy. Daniel Hyde Camp, California King so this was posted by Artsy just an interesting painting here. Another discovery, another brilliant painter out there, Bondozo Bandido, incorporating a bit of kind of found objects here with the ten euro note. Interestingly, break in case of emergency, a little bit of humor there and just interesting piece, charcoal and money on paper. Here's machine with another kind of humorous work here.
01:29:33.578 - 01:30:06.342, Speaker A: This is posted by it's not a gallery, so interesting piece there. Almost looks painted with a brush around the airbrush area of the shark. Interestingly, continuing on, Adam Lister studio. So we saw the Joker yesterday, this brilliant, brilliant work. Here are other movie stills, very famous movie stills. So here's, of course, and here's another one. Maybe this is taxi driver, if I had to guess, and I don't even know, I'm sure everybody out there knows, but these are brilliant.
01:30:06.342 - 01:30:35.862, Speaker A: What a style that that person has put together each row. Final work here, I think another beautiful work here, 3000 likes. It's pretty good. And just another beautiful painting here, kind of enigmatic here with a circus tent, this woman with the red skin, this cloud again, this weird framing device. Wild. So thank you for joining me on this extended journey here at an hour 30. Thank you for joining me.
