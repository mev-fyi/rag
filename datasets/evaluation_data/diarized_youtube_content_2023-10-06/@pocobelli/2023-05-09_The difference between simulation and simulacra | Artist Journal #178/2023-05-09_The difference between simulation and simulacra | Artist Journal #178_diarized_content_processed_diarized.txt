00:00:03.720 - 00:00:35.870, Speaker A: We are recording. Welcome back, everybody, as we sail through the sky here, this beautiful work here by Lorna Mills, which we will discuss shortly. Artist journal, May 9, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from the pirate ship in the sky in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Focavelli, and the madness continues over here, this surrealist show of sorts. Welcome back. And look at what we can intro it with.
00:00:35.870 - 00:01:25.558, Speaker A: Begin it with. With this beautiful, beautiful work by the great Lorna Mills. Again, someone who's been around and making, you know, working this theme, working with the marquee tool. And the marquee tool, if you don't know, is in photoshop, you know, the rectangular selection tool that is the marquee tool. And as far as I understand from what Lorna Mills said on Twitter a few weeks ago, when someone asked if you know, how she did it, this mask, in other words, the orange, is done using the marquee tool, as far as I understood what she said, which is why you get all these, like, let's zoom in a little bit here. Let's try to zoom in. Which is why everything feels kind of organic, right? Because this is manually done.
00:01:25.558 - 00:01:53.644, Speaker A: So it's not like she's measuring. I mean, who knows how she's doing it, but I assume she's kind of doing this manually, meaning that's why the pixels don't kind of match up properly. Exactly. They're not all the same size of pixel. So I think that actually gives us kind of an organic feeling, if I'm interpreting it correctly. So, anyway, here is a sunrise. I think it's called dominion flight.
00:01:53.644 - 00:02:21.712, Speaker A: But look, there's something else I want to show. I mean, what I'm really liking about what I'm seeing from Lorna Mills is this continuation, as far as I know. And I'm not an expert on her work, but she seems to continue to be pushing things. And I adore the landscapes, the nature works. I mean, I have to say, like, they're just stunningly beautiful. And it's also interesting. I mean, it looks like it's taken from the window of a dominion flight, let's say, like an airline.
00:02:21.712 - 00:03:03.394, Speaker A: And it, you know, it's kind of like, again, this nature with this bright orange, almost unnatural orange. I mean, you could probably find this orange in nature, but with this kind of hard, digital orange, the hard, you know, edges contrasting with these extraordinarily organic shapes of, say, the sun rising here. I assume that's a sunrise. It could be an atomic explosion as well, but it looks like a sunrise. So, anyways, a beautiful contrast here between the digital and nature. So profound and beautiful. And just finally here, I mean, you gotta love this.
00:03:03.394 - 00:03:26.750, Speaker A: Just kind of nice, kind of treated work here. Again, this all looks like very handmade, as they say. So anyways, very, very beautiful work. Here it is an edition, I think, of 30 available for 15 tezos. There's only one left. Oh, no, there are ten left. So get it while you can.
00:03:26.750 - 00:03:40.094, Speaker A: And it is selling. Look at that. Look at that. So very nice. I mean, that's real money, too. That's dollar 450. I mean, tezos is back below a dollar, so maybe it's like $420.
00:03:40.094 - 00:04:15.372, Speaker A: Either way, dominion flight is a beautiful work. Ten frames per second, 70 frames. It is 70 frames, only 700 by 700. So just a beautiful digital work of art. So coming up, we have a wonderful Twitter spaces lined up for you tomorrow. Santiago has agreed to come on, and I'm going to ask him all about his new work as well as just all his work and everything he's up to. So I'm titling this Santiago on art and AI because he just put out this huge project with emergent properties here.
00:04:15.372 - 00:04:32.866, Speaker A: M props. So that should be super interesting. And look, they even have Santiago's work there in their profile picture. So anyway, should be a super interesting show that is tomorrow. Have I pinned this up? Let's just pin it up. And so you can see that tomorrow. Come join.
00:04:32.866 - 00:05:22.156, Speaker A: And also, again, as I used to say, and kind of always started saying again, great place to practice your public speaking as an artist. So that comes up Wednesday, 09:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Twitter spaces which you can find in my profile here are just a couple of the works, a couple of more that have been minted from. What does it mean to have a body by Santiago here? And this great kind of, you know, it almost feels like a cut up here, but this is just kind of wire central in your chest this night and the day you forgot me. I mean, it feels like a kind of a William Burroughs type cut up here, but it looks like it's probably made with chat GPT AI. Again, this is generative AI. So again, just nice work here.
00:05:22.156 - 00:05:49.206, Speaker A: Interesting work. Again, the hypothetical bodies here and here is more that have been minted here recently. So there is that, and there is this. And so anyways, just cool work. So lots to discuss and a great experimentalist with Santiago. So that will be super interesting and fun. Come join Runertune and me to hang out.
00:05:49.206 - 00:06:18.366, Speaker A: And so anyways, thank you, everybody, for picking up this work here. Wives of the richest men. So another just, it's just really fun to play with the sketchbook. And this is one of those images, screenshots I've worked over and over and over again. So here is kind of the first, I think it's the first digital version I've done of this. So anyways, thank you, everybody, for collecting another kind of promoted story in the pixel art sketchbook here. So that is awesome.
00:06:18.366 - 00:06:48.424, Speaker A: Thank you to all the collectors here. Nice group of people. Very nice. So, so anyways, so yesterday I was thrilled to, you know, as Rosaceo said here, you don't lose your audience. Or I think he meant like nobody unsubscribed, or maybe people did, but other people came on. So that was wonderful because, you know, I love that almost half of the show talks about simulation and reality. This kind of discussion is important.
00:06:48.424 - 00:07:27.974, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, I think it's, you know, I'm kind of back to this Gertrude Stein Salon. You know, these people in Paris at the turn of the century, writers and artists, like, yeah, it's not like they're just talking about works. They're also talking about big ideas and whatnot. And that's kind of the spirit of this show. I think if it was just, you know, antiques Roadshow meets Blade Runner, as I like to call it, I don't think it would be enough for me. So I, yeah, so I'm, I was kind of worried about going that far deep, but we had to do an outline and I'm just thrilled about this audience, those that have watched that basically have held on.
00:07:27.974 - 00:08:09.966, Speaker A: So I'm thrilled about that. And I have a very important correction to make coming right up here. And that's the difference between simulation and simulacra. It'll be very brief. We did the hard, heavy lifting yesterday as far as just painting a very rough outline of what is being discussed there because we might as well be literate in what this discussion is, especially as digital artists, especially dealing with AI, you know, let's be able to go on the biggest stages in the world and know what we're talking about. Right? So anyway, thank you for the comment, Rosaceo, great to hear. And thank you, human boy, for the comment as well.
00:08:09.966 - 00:08:34.638, Speaker A: And again, love the Baudrillard debate from Alesio. And there's Santiago there. And so anyways, I'm thrilled. And great Hercules chimes in Eichmann, Esteban. So anyways, thank you. Everybody means a lot, especially after a show like that. Anyways, so this is going to be very brief here, but this is an incredibly important distinction.
00:08:34.638 - 00:09:36.806, Speaker A: Remember yesterday, or correction, I was saying yesterday that basically simulation and simulacra are basically the same thing, not the case. So, as you'll see here. So I asked chat GPT four, which is becoming an incredibly helpful philosophical assistant, because imagine if I had to go into this, into books and then trying to read and then going through dense text and trying to, I mean, I could have, Wikipedia might be able to help me, but basically, this is incredible that I can ask very specific philosophical questions. And because chat GPD has scanned most of this stuff, it can actually give a real answer. So let's look at this. So simulacra and simulation are related, but not the same. These concepts are central to Baudrillard's postmodern philosophical ideas and are discussed in detail in his book simulacra and simulation.
00:09:36.806 - 00:10:09.498, Speaker A: Let's break down the difference between the two. Simulacra. Simulacra refers to the copy or representation of something that has no original or no longer has an original. In Baudrillard's work, he distinguishes between different orders of simulacra, which evolved through history. The first order is a faithful copy of the original. So again, you do a portrait. So mimesis, I think we could say, or Greek for doing a copy.
00:10:09.498 - 00:10:33.198, Speaker A: I am here. You make a portrait, you're making a copy. The second order is a distorted copy. So. And I think what's meant here is purposefully distorted, but you see another copy, but a different. Of a different kind. So again, I would say, like they would say advertising, maybe you could put propaganda where there's some sort of agenda, perhaps, is one way of looking at it.
00:10:33.198 - 00:11:05.914, Speaker A: And the third order is a copy that has no relation to an original reality. And this is where it gets tempting to say that AI imagery is a simulacra, not a simula. I mean, well, actually, we'll get to simulation. It's an important distinction here. But is an AI image, say, produced by Midjourney, we could call a simulacra. Okay, so a copy, a representation, kind of like a thing that is produced. Okay.
00:11:05.914 - 00:12:21.440, Speaker A: For Baudrillard, the third order of simulacra represents the current state of our postmodern society, where copies have replaced the original reality and the distinction between the two has become blurred, where copies have replaced. So it's kind of, again, like, I mean, when we really parse this out, you know, not only was oxym kind of right, but it looks like he's super right as far as this idea, because in a sense what we have with AI imagery, arguably, feel free to disagree, is we have an image that is produced from a whole bunch of copies or from a whole bunch of previous works, right. That they have sampled and then they've kind of melded it all together and produced something new, let's say. So we have that, that is produced, but we don't have the original, is what I'm trying to say here. Where copies have replaced the original reality. So the original has disappeared because we don't even know where this is coming from other than conceptually, but we can't see the original. Okay, so where the distinction between the two has become blurred, where copies have replaced the original reality and the distinction between to has become blurred.
00:12:21.440 - 00:12:52.058, Speaker A: And I think, again, this is kind of hyper reality, but let's not go there. And finally, so that is a simulacra, a copy that is produced. An image, for example, that is produced. A simulation, on the other hand, is the process of creating or mimicking reality. So we might say, in this case, mid journey is creating a simulation. It creates a simulacra. It creates a thing, but it's under.
00:12:52.058 - 00:13:34.644, Speaker A: It's the process of creating is simulating a simulacra. So it's kind of like the action. It's almost like a verb. It's like the action of creating a simulacra is the process of creating or mimicking reality in which the distinction between the real and the artificial becomes blurred. Simulation involves the substitution of signs and symbols for reality, creating a world in which the representation takes precedence over the original. In a sense, simulation generates the simulacra that replaces the original reality. So this is what I want us to walk away with today.
00:13:34.644 - 00:14:11.162, Speaker A: Don't even worry about understanding every little bit of this. The important thing is the simulation generates the simulacra. The simulacra is the thing that is created, the image that, for example, that replaces the reality. So we might say mid journey is simulating or creating simulacra. The art pieces, the AI art images, using this definition, are simulacra, from my understanding. Okay, so. And it's mid journey that is doing the simulation to create those simulacra.
00:14:11.162 - 00:15:06.748, Speaker A: Okay, so that's something real that we can walk away with here, okay? Which is kind of a rare thing in when you're dealing with kind of post structural things. But thanks to chat GPT, it's happening beautifully. In summary, simulacra are the copies or representations that have replaced original reality, while simulation is the process through which these copies are created and reality is mimicked. The processed mid journey. Here, AI images, the two concepts are interconnected, but they are not the same thing. Baudrillard's work critiques the way these processes have impacted society, culture, and our perception of reality, arguing that our postmodern world is dominated by images and representations rather than direct experiences of reality. This is all arguable, in my opinion, but it's a really interesting way of thinking.
00:15:06.748 - 00:15:37.904, Speaker A: So, anyways, just a quick correction, an update on that. So kind of following with that. We haven't looked at RJ's series yet, I don't think, because this was just minted May 5 here. So he's done a whole series, and here's an example of 51 of one's ask AI answers for all. And here's. And they all have different questions. So another concept piece by RJ, what is true authenticity? And so also on his laptop and a table with a black background.
00:15:37.904 - 00:15:56.108, Speaker A: So ask AI number 16. So here they all are. And they all have, like, different questions. So here. Why am I filled with love so oftentimes kind of emotional or, you know, this sort of thing. Kind of human esque. Questions for the machine.
00:15:56.108 - 00:16:22.592, Speaker A: A question for the machine. So, anyways, kind of an interesting series that I thought was worth touching on. So there's still a few left at ten tezos each. And they're all kind of one of ones, but kind of an addition of 50, but each is unique. Continuing on, p one has a beautiful pixel artwork with some great music. Road trip. Enjoy a nice weather along the long drive.
00:16:22.592 - 00:16:52.072, Speaker A: Pixel art and music by p one. So pretty cool. Very modern work. You even see the windmills, the wind turbines, as they call them, in the background. And just cool music. So it's interesting to see, like, I mean, this could be the subject matter of an impressionist painting, right? A road trip, or just, you know, some traditional landscape. But it's quite fun to see, kind of gamified version with, like, some hard pixel art from.
00:16:52.072 - 00:17:17.849, Speaker A: From p one, who is no stranger to pixel art here, has been doing it for a while. Really interesting artist. Speaking of pixel art, gogolitis, I don't think we looked at this. This was a signature. Did we look at this already? I always get it confused. But anyways, I think we might have looked at this already, actually, now that we look at it. But here it is, a beautiful work here by gogolitis, with the continued colors and everything.
00:17:17.849 - 00:17:46.274, Speaker A: So just using his name, it's kind of like the free mint work, but here it's using his name for Tezos art collective. And it's basically, there's a little bio here. So this is an edition of 1000 available for two tezos each. So here it is. Are they sold out? How is that possible? They sold 1000? Let's just take a quick look. Oh, no, it is still available. So there you go.
00:17:46.274 - 00:18:20.334, Speaker A: Datura with a beautiful work here, and it's called Panorama delol. Acidic hot spring. And so again, a super interesting experimental artist who kind of has a lot of pixelation and glitch is how I'd kind of describe the combination. I mean, again, I think this would hang really well with, say, lorna Mills just playing in the same show. It's a landscape as well. I mean, you could have a really far out show called landscapes that you're using. Works like we're seeing here.
00:18:20.334 - 00:18:40.186, Speaker A: That would be pretty amazing. So beautiful landscapes, panorama. And Datura often uses, you know, representational things like here's a storm subject matter. Here's another panorama, the Sierra here. Quickly look at that. I think we looked at this one. We did look at a previous episode.
00:18:40.186 - 00:19:16.860, Speaker A: It's a little bit in slow motion here, but anyways, you get the picture. So just beautiful. Kind of, again, kind of like this impressionistic work here. Continuing on, Bytebybit has found, who uses a lot of retro technology, has found Kidpix. And I'm finding this super interesting because astrubal waffle mentioned Kidpix as being one of his favorite tools, and I've been meaning to check it out. So it's fun to see byte by bit, discover it, and now start to use it to see, kind of like what this thing can do and see kind of bite by bit, discover how to use it. So anyways, just great to see.
00:19:16.860 - 00:19:37.946, Speaker A: There are a few, I think. Yeah, this was just minted, and we have a couple of others here. I think Ilay picked up a couple. Yeah, here's Ilay. This one of one for nine tazos. So it's just kind of fun to see bite by bit experiment with this retro tool, because I've never used it. And again, so you get the sense of how it works.
00:19:37.946 - 00:20:08.410, Speaker A: It's almost like there's stamps, you know, of sorts with the anchor, the apple, the ladybug, you know, you can drag the hearts, so. And then you have brushes, so anyways, letters y o y. And here's one more. 1991 Kidpix 1.0. So I think there's, I suspect there's emulators or JavaScript versions of this here. Again, you see like the stamp like of the star that's kind of dragged across sun. So, anyways, just really cool.
00:20:08.410 - 00:20:51.052, Speaker A: Looks like really fun to use, so I'm gonna have to break that out at some point. Anyways, so there is some new work by bite by bit. Also went to Ilay. So Ilay is all over this, which is super cool. Stippin pixel with a gorgeous pixel artwork, safe and sound. Again, we're kind of back to this weird and interesting connection between impressionism and pixel art. A new discovery here, isn't it? Because, I mean, it kind of makes sense, like, when we think of Georges Seurat, who is considered post impressionist, and his divisionism, you know, using little points of paint to create the work.
00:20:51.052 - 00:21:27.636, Speaker A: Again, basing it off of science at the time. Kind of similar ideas are going on here with this kind of impressionistic pixel art. We're seeing little pixels instead of little dabs of paint, aren't we? I mean, this looks like an impressionistic rendering here, very artfully done. I mean, can we zoom in here? I mean, and because you see, there's a couple of colors here. And so anyways, I mean, it kind of reminds me of an impressionist painting, you know? So, anyways, very cool work. Edition of three from Stippin pixel. Very cool.
00:21:27.636 - 00:22:01.272, Speaker A: And here's another one. Soaring blue. And this is slightly less impressionistic, slightly more conceptual, maybe with a house that's kind of like, you know, almost like a rocket ship here, or just got kind of being dragged visually below with some moving, dithering and kind of this experimental staircase. So. And look at the beautiful yellow on that blue in the windows. Really helps make the piece a nice contrast there. And again, complementary colors, right? Sorine blue, a one of one for 15 tezos.
00:22:01.272 - 00:22:20.984, Speaker A: So pretty reasonable. Francois Gamme, with a beautiful work here. Dans. And this is already going for ten tezos. So it's funny, some of Francois's work just flies right off the shelf and some doesn't. She releases a ton. And anyways, it's great to see.
00:22:20.984 - 00:22:58.228, Speaker A: It just goes to show how choosy the collectors are and how if you're not selling on one piece, don't think that you'll never sell again. I find in digital, there's a bit more of a bias towards the work itself over the artist, in a sense, rather than just like, oh, it's that artist, I'll buy it no matter what. Which I just think in the traditional contemporary art world, there's slightly more focus, just slightly, on the artist rather than the work. And I don't think it's either good or bad. Just an observation. Anyway, cool work here. Another interesting piece.
00:22:58.228 - 00:23:26.806, Speaker A: Marcel Munciano C eleven. So just an artist I've never seen before with a really interesting, again, plants, pixelated, weird pixelated background and everything. You see the dithering in the back. So interesting work here. That is a gif again, Marcel Munteanu. And just a quick look here, quick look and a follow. So maybe a new direction, maybe not.
00:23:26.806 - 00:24:05.082, Speaker A: So anyways, always a new discovery here. Around every corner, a gorgeous work. It's almost looking like mature deluxe paint work by Sabato here, taking milk and cookies and doing a chrome work or a black and white monochromatic work here. A beautiful rendition here. It looks like chocolate chip cookies here. Some milk, some oreos and maybe some ice cream sandwiches or some other kind of treat here. Interesting, artificial, a real portrait of, you know, late 20th century, early 21st century life here with the Oreos.
00:24:05.082 - 00:24:23.894, Speaker A: I mean, undeniably modern here. And look, you even have the biscuit sandwich cookies. Maybe that's what these are. Double chocolate chip. So how fun is that? A veritable cornucopia of treats. So these are ten tezos, each addition of 36. They're actually moving pretty quickly here.
00:24:23.894 - 00:24:46.354, Speaker A: So that is by Sabato. Cover your eyes. Let me actually. Okay, for those with flash, flashing image issues, you know, the next minute or so, you're going to want to skip over. So this is Renky, who we've been looking at, and this is something called hayato. Okay, so that is going for ten tezos. And that is an edition of ten.
00:24:46.354 - 00:25:13.086, Speaker A: Kind of cool experimental work here. Edgy. And here's another one by Shilly the kid color one. I mean, really reminds me of. I mean, I'm sure you guys know that artist, what is his name? The guy who had the big show at the Whitney that I remember seeing somewhere like in 2007 or something like that. I'll look it up for next show. But anyways, interesting work here from Shilly the kid.
00:25:13.086 - 00:25:31.690, Speaker A: Interesting abstraction, very interesting edition of 25. And they're going for ten tezos each. And there are 24 left, so lots left there. And here's another one. This one's way cheaper, going for 0.1 tazos, high heel digital display. Kind of a similar concept here.
00:25:31.690 - 00:26:07.046, Speaker A: Almost playing off of that Christian. I can't remember the one, the high heel fashion with the red underneath and here instead putting that, putting the rainbow or the, you know, the gradients here, colorful gradients on the bottom of the high heel as I attempt to describe that so using dal E. Interestingly in there too high heal digital display. Oh, that is so cool. So anyways, edition of 25 for only 0.1 and so that is available for cheap. Koda Nakazono Continuum number 106.
00:26:07.046 - 00:26:54.326, Speaker A: This is an edition of one and so a new one here. I always love the different, like how it's almost like the Photoshop canvas in the background here and then we have some nice pixel just always just, you know, playing with these different elements here to create a digital experiment of sorts and just seeing what different things work together. Went to Sky Goodman in a transfer and ran exteer with a couple of more abstract works here. Entities going for only two tezos. I think it's an addition of ten. So anyways, just more interesting kind of abstract work and they all look good together, like they all fit really nicely together. So you start to see a process too underlying all of this, which kind of makes it more beautiful and valuable.
00:26:54.326 - 00:27:28.388, Speaker A: So only two tezos and only an addition of ten from Rannix Deer. So a couple of interesting works here. And of course we looked at the first one, if you recall here's actually number four was just released and we looked at this one, I think the other day, or maybe it was this one, nature's prism. So anyways, just interesting series here by Rannix Deer. Continuing on. This was sent to me, I think by Santiago, Lydia Moon. He sent me this artist that I'd never seen before who seems to have actually quite a following here.
00:27:28.388 - 00:27:51.854, Speaker A: So let's just turn this up. Thought it was kind of interesting, a display of, looks like a retro tool. So I'm trying to remember what drawing tool that might be. So anyways, kind of glitched out. February 2, 1987, 835. There we go. I think it'll run now.
00:27:51.854 - 00:28:14.648, Speaker A: Kind of like an ancient photoshop is what that looks like. But who knows? Kind of a interesting emotion it creates in a sense, interesting music and then this strange bouncing thing. So anyway, interesting discovery there. Edition of ten for seven tazos. That's on primary. So lots left. Actually a few have sold.
00:28:14.648 - 00:28:31.640, Speaker A: Santiago picked one up, max capacity. So musee void. Interesting. Cool work. Bzaya two pack loves you. And I think what really got me on this again, see the textured paper. Interestingly, I thought this was kind of hilarious though.
00:28:31.640 - 00:29:15.394, Speaker A: The Inri on top of the cross here, done with basically, I mean, what, you know, it looks like a street sign for what you'd call the speighty out here or for like, you know, a small store you'd have like the light bright display here on top. So. And there's two pack as a crucifixion and some fire in the background. Some classic kind of bazaic colors here. That pink is kind of trademark, that kind of muted pink and even bleeding here. So anyways, interesting. It almost has a bit of a Salvador Dali crucifixion because you see how the perspective feels a little strange.
00:29:15.394 - 00:29:34.122, Speaker A: Kind of reminds me for hip hop. I mean, kind of reminds me if we go to dali crucifixion, I think it's hypercubic. Hypercubic Christ, maybe is what that's called. Kind of has this. A little bit of this feeling to it. I don't know if that's on purpose. Not hypercubic.
00:29:34.122 - 00:29:51.634, Speaker A: It's this one. But, yeah, that's quite different, though. So. But the perspective seems a little bit similar. Almost like you're kind of looking down a little bit. So anyways, interesting work from Bezaya. Here's an artist that I don't know if I've ever shown here before, Jimmy.
00:29:51.634 - 00:30:16.634, Speaker A: And Jimmy is kind of, in my universe, a tezos kind of classic. And I'll show you in a second, like the work. I mean, I'll show it to you now, actually. I mean, many of you have probably seen this work before. I mean, it was there from the very outset. Just kind of a very classic work that stands out. And it's like an edition, I think, of 402 rooftop jamming session.
00:30:16.634 - 00:30:35.616, Speaker A: This is one of those early works I came across that really impressed me. And cartoons isn't necessarily or, you know, quote unquote cartoons or kind of cartoon illustration isn't necessarily my thing. But I just, I think. Pretty sure I collected that. And. Yeah, see, I got one there. Just a cool work.
00:30:35.616 - 00:31:05.856, Speaker A: So, anyways, Jimmy is still putting out work and also on exchange, art, our rendezvous. Just kind of making these moving images. And there's some sound here, too, I believe. This is super interesting. So I think that's the Jimmy character there. Just kind of beautifully put together, you know, could hang really well with Adelia, maybe in the same show. And you see this little fish tanks.
00:31:05.856 - 00:31:21.780, Speaker A: There's something just super charming about Jimmy's work. And Jimmy has some pretty serious collectors, too. Like this already has a. A bid of 13 Saul, $267 here. So that is not. Nothing like Jimmy is pretty popular. Look at that.
00:31:21.780 - 00:31:49.408, Speaker A: 69 Saul. Last sold for. That's the price. Last sold for 25 Saul over here. 25 nine. And then you see over here, a visual art student on a profound quest to mend his ways lent aid by a boy who trapped in a bittersweet trip down memory lane. There's something kind of just beautiful and magical look like 888 just on like people want a lot of money if they're going to part with their Jimmy works.
00:31:49.408 - 00:32:13.954, Speaker A: And just kind of one of those interesting artists I only would have found on object probably, you know, or maybe exchange art or on twitter, but you know. Anyway, just a really cool artist here. So new work from Jimmy. Classic, classic, classic work here. Just kind of moving. Purple drank in service of the meme makers. So kind of a epic work here.
00:32:13.954 - 00:32:44.714, Speaker A: Usually doing a kind of pastiche of sorts. I'm not sure what the original is. These kind of look like saints and that almost looks like Jesus here on the right. And so anyway, and some interesting design here. So I'm not sure on the reference on this created for hologram gallery. So actually hologram, hologram gallery, which is Chi Moscu Jackson, has a show called Subconscious Bloom art show. Subject matter, title and description made in collaboration with chat GBT.
00:32:44.714 - 00:33:14.194, Speaker A: So interesting work here. Frog thralls. So anyways, cool work from Purple drank. And here's another one for the drink portrait of Duke Bartholomew Pondleton. So this is probably another famous portrait and kind of some hilarity there in the pants there. And so anyways, just a really cool work here by purple drank as usual. And Pepe is in the imagination right now.
00:33:14.194 - 00:33:30.314, Speaker A: So purple drank edition of one. Let's just see what happened here. Sale for only five tezos. So a short auction here. So someone lucked out. They got a one of one purple drank for five tazos. Good deal.
00:33:30.314 - 00:34:02.884, Speaker A: Turkarak continuing with Ariske works here, although not directly neighborliness. And here you see just another kind of edgy illustration by Turkirak with the neighbor kids or neighbors finding themselves here. So anyways, really brilliantly illustrated here. So again, edgy artist, one of one for 15 tezos. Pretty reasonable. Again, like kind of brilliant composition. There's a lot going on here.
00:34:02.884 - 00:34:30.471, Speaker A: So Turkirak continues to impress from over here, Daniel W. Live slow, die old. And here is a new work from Daniel W with a coffin. Don't think there's any sound. So just a cool kind of illustrative work by Daniel W. Continuing in that series we saw the first two and the third here has a coffin with a skeleton. And just looking like Daniel's experiment.
00:34:30.471 - 00:34:50.055, Speaker A: Experimenting. A bit interesting here at the top, how it goes from thick to thin and using the gif to just do, because you can do both. Right, as I always like to say, with design, there's kind of. There's more than. There's right answers and wrong answers. But there's more than right one right answer. But there are several right answers here.
00:34:50.055 - 00:35:14.423, Speaker A: You could see all the different right answers you could have to fill this area here. And what's funny about the gif is you can try them all. You can put them all into one work. So anyway, cool work from Daniel W. One of one for 70 tezos and another one, no exit. Kind of in the more kind of horror kind of vein. And here it looks like a couple of hands that are hanging from a fire exit.
00:35:14.423 - 00:35:33.260, Speaker A: So anyway, cool work here. And just always interesting architecture and composition from Daniel W. Even like this little kinda. These black dots, black marks, actually add quite a bit to the composition. These tiny black marks, the shadow of the exit sign. Moody work. And very cool.
00:35:33.260 - 00:35:47.440, Speaker A: And let's just see what happened here. This was burnt. Interesting. Maybe minted again. Shall we see? And it is gone. So, okay, so we'll see what happens there. If that is reminted.
00:35:47.440 - 00:36:07.644, Speaker A: But looking like it's in the same series here as the W. Flora Marquez. Continuing interesting take on the collage here with a, you know what looks like a photo of pattern here. And also here. So cool experimentation from Flora Marquez. At the end. We all want the same thing.
00:36:07.644 - 00:36:31.942, Speaker A: So the bird girl, triumphant, somewhat, with a leaf in her or a branch of some kind in her beak. May 5, 2023. So, anyway, available for 20 tezos. This is another work that was burned. And I. You know, the first time I saw it, I wasn't sure. Then I came back and I was like, this is actually a really good looking work.
00:36:31.942 - 00:36:54.890, Speaker A: And kind of has a real, for lack of better term, contemporary art feel to it. Just this repetition of this figure. There's something really brilliant and beautiful about this work. Anyway, it didn't sell that well. One sold early on. And I think maybe Dan asked the person to burn it or something. Day late, buck short to burn it.
00:36:54.890 - 00:37:20.672, Speaker A: I don't know what happened, but they've all been burned and they're all gone. But I think this one, it was one of those works that the next day I liked even more. So interesting to see if it'll be reminted or not ready for school. I really like that series. It's wearing really well over time because there's, of course, the other one with. I think it was Mickey Mouse. Here it is.
00:37:20.672 - 00:37:48.164, Speaker A: This one here with fake whale. And it looks like Mickey Mouse and Astro boy. So, anyway, I. You know, I like the simplicity of this one. Like, what if you just had the Mickey Mouse repeating? There's something about it, at least from my perspective over here. Doctor version with a new work here, landscape number twelve. So playing with the shapes and the different treatments in the different areas of the composition.
00:37:48.164 - 00:38:12.604, Speaker A: And so anyways, you have beautiful colors here and the pink triangular type structures here. Kind of a surrealist landscape to a certain degree, but done with kind of Gif video or. Sorry. Yeah, like analog or glitched video is what I'm trying to say. So anyways, kind of cool landscape here. Landscape number twelve. And one has sold here.
00:38:12.604 - 00:38:34.152, Speaker A: And so none listed here, though. DJ Curo with a cool glitch work. I think this is called Jumbotron or Jimbo Tron. Kind of a heavy file here. Let's see if we can play it. So, pretty glitchy. So anyway, nice piece from DJ Curo.
00:38:34.152 - 00:38:54.874, Speaker A: Big shout out. So anyway, cool, cool work. Temporal replica become transformed through boundaries and critical practice. Jimbo is left with a testament of the edges of our future. So edition of four and hasn't been listed yet. So very cool. And we're cruising Sky Goodman with a work here, hiking boots, some AI boots.
00:38:54.874 - 00:39:34.184, Speaker A: I thought these were really pretty and just a cool variation on the whole AI sneaker, lost sneaker series. So hiking boots and a cool kind of landscape in the background. Kind of almost looks like an ad. Mister Shapeless, who seems to use object as a place of experimentation. So face of the future number four, pretty nice piece here using, you know, Mister Shapeless's trademark colors here. But almost, instead of doing a landscape, applying maybe a similar technique to just a close up of the face. So a close up portrait.
00:39:34.184 - 00:39:49.674, Speaker A: Face of the future number four. And here's Danielle King. Okay, so one of the AI women derived from my explorations of alternative art history. So probably a fake person. AI woman. So we're kind of back to. Let's review.
00:39:49.674 - 00:40:19.660, Speaker A: So this is a simulacra. This here as a copy or a representation or as the thing, the image that, say, is produced by AI. This is the simulacra. And the simulation is the act of making this, the process of making this, say here, it's with mid journey. Okay, so here is the simulacra created by mid journey. Okay, cool painterliness too, actually in the background here. Very nice.
00:40:19.660 - 00:40:57.388, Speaker A: So anyways, cool. Hannah, this is available for 75 tezos, a one of one and a couple of works here by Simone Pompeii. Simone Pompeii. Just some interesting kind of city, Sci-Fi cities here of the future. And there seems to be. There's a couple here, the pneumatic reverberation station, the second layer of the world and where fossil fuels have been depleted. So almost this kind of post apocalyptic landscape, but post oil and post fossil fuel sort of landscape here, the skywave amplification system.
00:40:57.388 - 00:41:16.046, Speaker A: So anyways, interesting landscapes here, created, I believe, by AI. The account is Simone Stumer. AI. It is. AI by Simone. Simone Pompey. So anyway, cool works here and five have been minted and that's part of a whole larger series.
00:41:16.046 - 00:41:38.760, Speaker A: And finally, Ilay here with a cool combination of flowers and fruit and big shout out to Ilay for doing the timestamps yesterday. That is super cool. And anyways, here is just a really cool AI painting by aylay of peaches and flowers. I think you. I don't know how you pronounce that. Poinies. Peenies.
00:41:38.760 - 00:41:50.080, Speaker A: I don't know how. Ponies. I don't know how to pronounce these flowers. I'm not a flower expert. So anyways, cool work here. And here is another one. Strawberries and wildflowers by aylay.
00:41:50.080 - 00:42:10.104, Speaker A: So again, I think we'd call these simulacra, produced by, you know, AI tools. So very cool work by eyelay. Kind of painterly. You gotta love this reflection here. Like a real oil painting. She's getting really good at that oil treatment. So anyways, by now for five tezos, there are seven left.
00:42:10.104 - 00:42:39.500, Speaker A: And finally, another home office, HQ number seven by Zoom edition of eleven for three tazos. So I love this series. Portrait of the contemporary world here. Beautifully done. And on and on I could go. So, HQ number seven, three tezos edition of eleven. And finally, Charles AI with an addition of 100 for 20 tezos each of Pepe here looking like he's in Greece, isn't he? Looks like Crete made it.
00:42:39.500 - 00:42:55.112, Speaker A: A tribute to the remarkable ascent of Pepe and the lives it has transformed for the better. Yeah, I echo that. That is great. So there is Pepe celebrating, looking like in Greece. I want to go to Greece now. Made it. 20 tezos each.
00:42:55.112 - 00:43:04.784, Speaker A: And that is your show, everyone. Hope you have a great week. I'll see you on spaces tomorrow, 09:30 a.m. Eastern standard Time. Thanks for joining me again. Until next time, take care.
