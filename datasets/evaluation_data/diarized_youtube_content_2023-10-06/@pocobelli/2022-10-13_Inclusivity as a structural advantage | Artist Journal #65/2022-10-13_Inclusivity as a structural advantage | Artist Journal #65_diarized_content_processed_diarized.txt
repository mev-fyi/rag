00:00:03.960 - 00:00:39.074, Speaker A: I have turned down the mic. It was coming in a little hot yesterday, so hopefully this is better. I tend to project right into it. Artist Journal, October 13, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, artist reporter, which has a special meaning if you dig back into those previous episodes. It is a term put together by Robert Rauschenberg, very obscure term, and it has a very special meaning. This is not a news program.
00:00:39.074 - 00:00:51.430, Speaker A: Welcome back. Thank you to everybody. Thank you for all the comments, the tweets, everything. Look at this fantastic work by. I think it's burselector bur sector. Let's just look. Let's get it right.
00:00:51.430 - 00:01:26.864, Speaker A: Bur sector, another tribute we remember, the one from strange thing, which was totally awesome. You win. I mean, this is the ultimate kind of trophy, isn't it, in the digital world, you get a burr sector work. Here, of course, is the myth with a lot of his classic iconography, whether it's the sea, the mountains, the clouds, and classic myth colors here, that lime green and pink score 99999. So just a fantastic work. And I had to put it on the front. So you win.
00:01:26.864 - 00:01:50.224, Speaker A: Pixel myth, my tribute to the man, the legend, the myth. And I'll just show you the other one for those that haven't seen it, of course, there's the strange thing one which was a super classic. So anyways, I love these works. Bersektor, let's give him a follow. Lots of pixel work. I guess this looks like it is a FX hash. And so anyways, let's go to our show notes.
00:01:50.224 - 00:02:03.528, Speaker A: Here is some of his work. So anyways, very. Oh, he did this work. This is a great work. I love this artist brr sector. And he's got more. Well, I'm going to have to buy this.
00:02:03.528 - 00:02:33.974, Speaker A: So anyways, brr sector, follow him. Thank you to. I sold a quick, very quickly to Martin Jo ss, a couple of these rocket booster works. You can check them out. They're about 20 seconds, so I'm not going to go through the whole thing. And also to, to moneymaker 21, give him a follow on Twitter, too. So anyways, so it was great.
00:02:33.974 - 00:03:11.676, Speaker A: The offer came in before I could put the price on this one. So thank you, moneymaker. That made my evening. They flew out the door at a mere ten tezos each. Thank you to both of them and give them a follow on Twitter. An interesting, a note from Runetune on yesterday's show, which I wanted to pick up runetune with more provocative, interesting content here. Let's see if we can do that I love that established artists like Marina Abramovich and Damien Hirst are showing interest in NFTs and digital art.
00:03:11.676 - 00:03:54.074, Speaker A: But it strikes me as a bit of a postured money grab, being that they don't collect any nfts themselves. Excellent point, Rune toon. And as we all know who have bought nfts, there's kind of nothing like buying an NFT to understand NFT culture, because if you've never bought an NFT, you are missing a piece of the puzzle. So I think, correct me if I'm wrong, and it's possible they have bought them, but not that I know of. I think that's a really interesting, important point. I have a rule, and that is I don't collect established artists who don't collect other artists work. New and emerging artists get a little bit of a pass, especially if you're on ETH.
00:03:54.074 - 00:04:48.724, Speaker A: Like I took about almost a year before I bought my first NFT because especially if you have no money when you're starting and you're starting on ETH, you're not about to drop $1,000 to get, like, just a beginner, you know, work, or I guess $400. It's what it would cost you. Is it really validation if the artists at the very top of the trad art world are only accepting our money without putting anything back into the ecosystem? So. Great point. And, yeah, I mean, look, I'm not looking for validation. I think if anything in my universe, and maybe Pokebella universe, is different from, you know, everywhere else, I'm sure it is. But in my universe, if anyone's seeking validation here, ironically, and the tables have turned, it is Damien Hirst and Marina Abramovich who are kind of getting a foot in the door.
00:04:48.724 - 00:05:15.826, Speaker A: Should this completely blow up. You could argue it already has. But all my friends, you know, are all your friends buying nfts for their wall and the screen on their wall, not me. So I don't think it's really. I think we're on our way, but I don't think so. I think they're just kind of getting a toehold, a foothold into this scene, should it blow up. And then they're like, hey, here we are, and we already have our collections.
00:05:15.826 - 00:05:42.414, Speaker A: And to your point, there is a lot of money that they are making here. Like Marina Abramovich's mint. As far as I understand, the mint price was 100 tezos. And I don't know how many works were on there for the horse. And then Damien Hirst, as we saw yesterday, he has 1000 of the currency works that he has, and the floor price is 5.8 ETH. We calculated that to be $7 million.
00:05:42.414 - 00:06:32.334, Speaker A: So each one of those is seven or $8,000, which is a pretty nice vacation. A very nice vacation. So if you're sitting on a thousand vacations, you go, okay, fine, I'll burn all the physical work. Kine problem, as we say in Deutschland here, no problem, I'll keep the digital and we'll burn those works because I have $7 million of art here. Watching this again, and it kind of sickens me to hear Damian's words read off his twitter. I've been in the physical art world a long time and I expect people have agendas. Well, what is your agenda on Opensea, Mister Hearst? Now here I would say, let's be charitable at the same time, because despite all the criticisms we could make, I think the point he was making is the physical art world, what I call kind of the contemporary art world, for lack of better term.
00:06:32.334 - 00:07:14.990, Speaker A: It's kind of full of like, I take his point like it's kind of, there are a bunch of people with agendas and it's not like, I mean, everybody to a certain degree acts out of self interest. This is human nature. But I think the point he was making is, you know what, this is a really great community. And you know, ultimately he kind of gave a thumbs up to the community. And no, we don't need Damien Hirst validation. But if Damien Hearst wants to send some positive vibes, you know, a renowned contemporary artist wants to send positive vibes and gives a thumbs up and gives his 100% commitment. Hey, are we gonna say we're too good for that? I don't think we should do that.
00:07:14.990 - 00:08:21.326, Speaker A: I think we should welcome him in and anybody else, frankly, inclusion, you know, like the problem with the contemporary art world is it's so much of it is about exclusion. And it's cost the contemporary art world an enormous amount because they're not getting the talent. They don't have the same stream of talent that is in the digital art world and open platforms and on Twitter here, they just don't have that same resource. So they are paying a huge price for that. And so this inclusive vibe is not only is it just funner and better, it's actually a structural advantage over the contemporary art world and why, I think people talk about how nfTs, and I think super rare John was coming out, how long is it going to take for it to flip? Some people say that it's almost a meme, you know, nfts to flip the trad art world. It's going to happen, I think, for this very reason. The openness, okay.
00:08:21.326 - 00:09:01.822, Speaker A: That is the structural advantage. So thank you for the very provocative, interesting points, rune tune, as always. Another just kind of, you know, culture comment, this time from popple. So Artie Hands wrote, art doesn't look better on super rare, y'all. So pointing out, like, why is art on super rare going for more? This is social proof. We talked about this on a very earlier episode. If someone very important, let's say, you know, Damien Hirst buys my work, then all of a sudden my market goes up and then other people want to buy it because Damien Hirst bought it.
00:09:01.822 - 00:09:20.846, Speaker A: So social proof. And superwear has a little bit of that, this kind of exclusivity. It was kind of like the first major, exclusive, exciting platform. I'm sure there were others before it. I'm not an expert in the history. So anyways. But we all know super rare has a great brand in terms of the sales.
00:09:20.846 - 00:10:08.674, Speaker A: The sales alone speak for it and the, you know, reputed artists and all this sort of thing. So let's look at Popple's point here and speed this show up curation and or gatekeeping by platforms on when on one hand is the chains. And here's the point here. On the other hand, it's the beacon for people who are not used to true freedom. They need someone to tell them what to collect instead of collect something that they really like. Some will embrace freedom, some never. And this brings about a topic that I was discussing in the Arthropo Twitter spaces yesterday with Mikey and the crew there at Arthropo, which is, I think there will be a reassessment of all the art and the value, in a sense, the chain.
00:10:08.674 - 00:10:37.748, Speaker A: It actually doesn't matter. I think in the long term, I think in the short term, it totally matters. And we see that with the same artists selling for ten to 15 x on Ethereum. Right. We see that directly. We're going to see it again today. But I think there will be a reassessment in whether it's two years or 20 or 100, maybe two or 20, there will be a reassessment.
00:10:37.748 - 00:11:06.302, Speaker A: It could be 20 years. When I think Tezos art will be seen completely on the same level, you know, as in terms of value. I think there will just be a reassessment because a JPEG is a JPEg. And really, the chain ultimately does not matter. But I think culturally, we are in that mode okay, let me speed up a bit here. Another very good point by agor. NFT.
00:11:06.302 - 00:12:03.690, Speaker A: If I own NFT created by an artist, do I need his permission or her to exhibit this NFT in an art gallery? This is something that I think is a great question, because we see it with the. On cyber, like, technically speaking, I think with copyright law, you do have to ask permission if you're going to put up an artist's work in a gallery. So, especially if you charge money for that show. So I think this is a really deep, interesting, simple, in a great way question. Do I need an artist's permission to show an NFT in a gallery? In an art gallery? If anybody knows the answer to that question, feel free to leave a comment, because I actually don't know the answer to that question. From what I understand, it's a yes. Lavon sold his work for 269 tezos to Gigachad Pepe.
00:12:03.690 - 00:12:19.120, Speaker A: So a little offer of $0.10 from seven art. Thank you. Seven art, beating out Vincent van do. So this went for 269. And what was also interesting is Vincent Van Doe, that same day, acquired. So that is part of a series called Incognito.
00:12:19.120 - 00:12:46.732, Speaker A: See, this is incognito six. So Vincent van Gogh acquired incognito one from our guy, Mikey Wilson, again, who I was just talking about, for 400 tezos. So I brought up. I think I brought it up incognito one. Here it is. So this sold for 400. So Lavon is having a great day to Vincent Van do.
00:12:46.732 - 00:13:09.634, Speaker A: So congratulations to all. And to Mikey Wilson, too, there. Vincent van do and Lavon. So, just kind of interesting, a little bit more market news. So, threesomes. This guy, who I don't know too much about, but seems to be pretty old school on Tezos. I'm sure some of you know way more about him than I do, but he had 30,000 tezos of sales yesterday.
00:13:09.634 - 00:13:30.794, Speaker A: So he writes. I keep trying to tell you guys, sheesh. Fake whale there. We're also going to look at 900 tezos, which was interesting. So I looked, and these works here, I looked at his activity. This work here, I think I brought it up. This sold for 18,000.
00:13:30.794 - 00:13:48.958, Speaker A: And this sold for ten or eleven. So there's your sales here. So these white cubes, complete insert. So, I don't know, you probably get a bunch of free. It's probably a utility card. You know, this has future utility. So I don't think it's purely about this piece here.
00:13:48.958 - 00:14:12.674, Speaker A: I think it's. I think that's part of his thing is, I think they probably get a whole set or I'm not exactly sure what. But impressive market people are willing to drop 18,000 tezos. I mean, that's 25, $30,000. So impressive. Now we're going to speed up. I keep promising we're going to speed up here.
00:14:12.674 - 00:14:32.364, Speaker A: Fake whale. You see, though, I was like, oh, fake whale. That gallery we were looking at, or who does additions, had 900 tazos. So what happened there? So, of course, they put out the die with the most likes. So they put out this work with Jesse Draxler. And so nine of these sold is from my understanding. Yeah.
00:14:32.364 - 00:15:02.252, Speaker A: So there's your 900 tezos. Mikey Wilson bought one dressy Draxler I actually don't know too much about. Did we bring up. Now there's only one reservation I have on this. Like, we kind of went in a previous episode of how to set up a gallery on Tazos, because, look, you go to fake whales account, and now you have the art with super. Sorry, with die with the most likes. And here you have the art with Jesse Drexler.
00:15:02.252 - 00:15:36.800, Speaker A: So this is how you start a gallery on Tazos. My only thing, my only reservation is, I don't know if they put these alphabetically. I want the artist to be minting it, though, not fake whale cross. And here it's ambiguous. Again, I don't know if they just put these creators alphabetically, but you see, with the die with the most likes. And again, I don't know if it's just an alphabetical thing. I want the creator to be minting the work always, like, just as a general rule, even if there's more than one person on the thing.
00:15:36.800 - 00:16:01.428, Speaker A: I don't know if it's just an alphabetical thing, though. So anyway, so Jesse Draxler, again, he's got a ton of. I assume it's a he. A ton of followers on Twitter. I don't know too much about him. I've never heard, but has a very healthy market, as some people were joking about it. Was Ed Marolla there? So anyways, so let's get into the art here.
00:16:01.428 - 00:16:27.822, Speaker A: This was just an interesting piece, open to offers on super rare. This is by Adil Hasilart and kind of has almost a die with the most likes, but its own thing and just kind of chaotic. And it's getting offers of 2.69 ETH. Unfortunately, it was inevitable. So just kind of interesting to see this. This is a bit of a head turner for me.
00:16:27.822 - 00:16:50.378, Speaker A: See? Almost vesuvian man or something. Turned into a clock. Um, also a cross chain business over here. Triple zero nine is. I think this is zero zero nine's genesis work on super rare has a half ETH offer. He does all the blob kind of AI work. So that's impressive.
00:16:50.378 - 00:17:16.710, Speaker A: Look at all these, all this bidding. So current offer is 0.5 ETH, $640. An isolationist genesis piece went for an ETH yesterday. So very cool. We were looking at that. And continuing on, there's a one ETH offer again from a Tezos artist who moved to super rare, who still puts out work on Tezos once in a while.
00:17:16.710 - 00:17:43.496, Speaker A: One don't knows or I don't knows. He got an offer for this. Anonymous it's called for a new work on super rare for an ETH. So the markets, you know, there is money out there for artists. Drank Frazetta, also known as purple drank. He's got a drank dao token and you can buy them for 35. On secondary, there's gonna be eight plus curated drops.
00:17:43.496 - 00:18:04.932, Speaker A: So if you own the token, you get the drops. So FYI, purple drank is up to stuff there. I should probably pick one of those up. I mean, for 35, you get eight works. Also, just an automatic pepe. It's nice just to see the process. So Chris Granneberg, the guy we talked about automatism.
00:18:04.932 - 00:18:21.142, Speaker A: So here's just another example. I guess he works on a notebook first and then moves to procreate. So just kind of interesting. Automatic pepe. And another work in progress by Matias Laplata. I know you missed my masterpieces. New drop coming soon.
00:18:21.142 - 00:18:47.718, Speaker A: That looks like Michael Jackson. So that looks very promising from Matthias La Plata. Now, we were talking about how Haiti was having this notification issue. I'm still not getting the notifications after he cleared the cache twice. Remember that? So I don't know if that solved because I don't know if that solved the problem because there are like three or four works. I didn't get notifications. I don't know if any, maybe other people are.
00:18:47.718 - 00:19:17.752, Speaker A: So just an FYI there. So this is called so and 199 x edition of three. So again, you see these tiny additions for him. So you wonder if he continues to have notification issues there. Minting at 21 39. Offers come in. Usually he gets within minutes, and offers came in 15 minutes later there.
00:19:17.752 - 00:19:42.176, Speaker A: So I think there's still an issue. Those are glitch rom works, by the way. These are like Nintendos put through the glitch Rom process, which many of you know. So just an FYI here. Interesting pixel work from Ponpon Pon. Beautiful scenery, and it's got some music. I thought this was just kind of a funny, funny work here.
00:19:42.176 - 00:20:02.044, Speaker A: See if it plays, or we'll come back to. Let's move on because there's too much we've gone through. We'll see if Ponpon comes back here. Let's try again. Okay, good. Phew. All right.
00:20:02.044 - 00:20:24.834, Speaker A: I just thought this was kind of fun and innocent looking and actually kind of interesting from a technical level. This kind of two planes. Just interesting in passing. One tez. Nice pixel work with some music. Ed Morolla, eternal plant, interesting pixel work. One tezos.
00:20:24.834 - 00:20:40.704, Speaker A: So just kind of fun. Always interesting. Over with Ed. I picked one of these up again. Only a tezos, and there's only four left. These might be gone by the time you load it up. Another pixel work.
00:20:40.704 - 00:21:11.234, Speaker A: A tribute to purple drank, who we just talked about with his drank dao, a tribute to the great purple drank, and a max Leffer inspiration. So there is your purple drank, and there is, I guess, skeletor, a popular meme. And that you can get for a tezos 50. So some really cheap pixel art here for you today. This was also interesting. This is tentezos. Let's see if there's sound.
00:21:11.234 - 00:21:44.146, Speaker A: I thought this was really original and interesting. We'll look at the name of the artist here in a second. Just fun, right? I mean, again, we're. This is the last 24 hours, from what I understand. So anyway, who is this? This is Josephine Johnson. You can see right there at the bottom there. I couldn't find her on object.
00:21:44.146 - 00:21:58.706, Speaker A: I'm sure she's there because all Teia works are on object. But that's where I found it. New work by the myth. Our star in the front there, the guy who won. Shame. This is a myth rarity work. So this is from 2017.
00:21:58.706 - 00:22:42.324, Speaker A: So an early myth. Interesting color usage. Looks like a very early work, doesn't it? But what's so interesting about it is, you see a lot of the kind of same kind of psychological themes seem to be going on here. You know, there's, like, this couple in intercourse here, and then, like, this crazy sort of weapon thing going on and more weapons. So the symbolism, you know, this is 2017, which is pretty early for myth, but you can see all the seeds are there, you know, and even just, like, the originality with, like, the pink and the green. So a very interesting work. The red eyes, it's all kind of there, which is really interesting.
00:22:42.324 - 00:23:02.544, Speaker A: It's called shame. So I think that's sold out now, or is this sold out because there were 15? Let's just look quickly. Should this load up, you can still get it. It's 20. So still available. There are ten left. So it's going pretty slow for a myth work.
00:23:02.544 - 00:23:38.032, Speaker A: This is almost a tribute to the myth, I want to say, because this mask, I mean, this has myth written all over it, but this is by board me social club called homesick. And I just thought, this is kind of another interesting work. You have a UFO and some guy being brought up in it, some interestingly painted palm trees, and this dude who looks little blue, so a little sad. So here's homesick digital painting. Boardme social club, small edition, sold out. Mikey Wilson, Bali Jojo 350. So a nice price.
00:23:38.032 - 00:24:03.374, Speaker A: This came out a couple of days ago, and Audie Woody released his work. Looks like there are still some left. Only two when I loaded this up. They may be gone by now. There are still two left. So this Mike Tyson works with some colorful language, a yellow cab. So again, just more oddness from Audie Woody, but always just find it interesting.
00:24:03.374 - 00:24:28.564, Speaker A: An art of the present. I was joking to myself. I was in the gym yesterday, and I was thinking about this work. This is an atomic bomb. So Dan control, what does he say this is? Little boy was the code name for the type of atomic bomb dropped on the japanese city of Hiroshima on the 6 August 1945. It was the first nuclear weapon used in warfare. So interesting subject matter.
00:24:28.564 - 00:25:01.076, Speaker A: And, yeah, you can just tell it's in the zeitgeist. That's another, like, covering all this art. We kind of get the undercurrents of the zeitgeist, the spirit of the times, a german word. So there it is. So interesting subject matter from dan control. I want to bring up this limbo really quickly just to highlight the colors here, this color scheme that we're seeing with this kind of anime manga look. And you can see, look how BeautifuL LImbO's work is in black and white as well.
00:25:01.076 - 00:25:20.904, Speaker A: So no wonder it takes him a while to make his works. There is a ton of work that goes into it. So beautiful, beautiful work. He should be working in comics and art. Like, it looks like this is really nice work. So anyways, linear art to color. Some experimentation from Sabato.
00:25:20.904 - 00:25:56.470, Speaker A: I kind of like this beach scene. Rom corruptions. So these are ROM corruptions. Two and game photography, but a completely different take on ROM corruptions here. So I thought that was worth paying attention to a complete, because ROM corruptions are kind of usually done in a similar manner where we distort the original code a little bit and then you get your kind of glitched out ROM. I like how he's taking it in another direction because I think there are many directions you could go with Rom corruption. So interesting.
00:25:56.470 - 00:26:21.046, Speaker A: It's called little shades, which looks like a beach scene. Here's another one here. Pilotwing topography's excursion. So again, is this a glitch? Yeah. Rom corruption and game photography of Pilotwing 64 on Nintendo 64. So interesting. And a lot of people, I think, use Super Nintendo, I think, for glitch Rom.
00:26:21.046 - 00:26:39.018, Speaker A: So also interesting that he's using Nintendo 64. Here's another one, Parezo. And just give you a quick look. So these are going for 25 each. Just interesting. And then he has a record of provenance from glitch photography. So I don't know if this work is old or not.
00:26:39.018 - 00:27:09.528, Speaker A: 2020 2022, maybe put some new work on it. Another work from Kazuhiro Ehaira, whose work we were looking at the other day. Just interesting. And you see he's got one version here and another version here. So I just think an interesting artist to pay attention to. Again, I love this idea of doing different iterations of works, which we can do with digital. You can't do that with physical.
00:27:09.528 - 00:27:50.890, Speaker A: If you make a painting and then you want to remix that painting, you wreck that painting. If you want to paint over it and do different versions with digital, we can remix to our heart's content. Another AI painting melding combination by Ilya Shipkin. Buy for 15 edition of ten painting and AI merged into one unspiritual one. So just kind of interesting. And as we go into AI here, here's another one from scandal, whose work we were looking at, I think, yesterday. Reserve price of only 0.15
00:27:50.890 - 00:28:05.810, Speaker A: ETH. Thanks for your support. Fam links below the sun foundation. So some interesting AI work. This one's really nice. Let's keep going. Javier Tomao, also on foundation.
00:28:05.810 - 00:28:20.114, Speaker A: I believe the last auction is left. Thanks for the bid from Claire Silver. Punk. So he's doing well. So this AI art thing continues to have a market look. Current bid 0.25 ETH.
00:28:20.114 - 00:28:42.014, Speaker A: We've been looking at Javier Tomeo for a couple of weeks, at least. 0.15. Winning bid here sold for 0.16. This beautiful one that we looked at, 0.1815. So he's making bank actually like this turns into an ETH. All of a sudden he's paying rent. So interesting.
00:28:42.014 - 00:29:05.366, Speaker A: Who is this one more time whose work we've looked at before? Genesis on foundation, 0.1 ETH. So you can start to see the prices too, of a lot of this AI art, you know, around that 1.1 to 0.2 range, which seems fair this early on. And if you're just kind of getting started. So Abbott's dwelling.
00:29:05.366 - 00:29:24.088, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Red rum dropped this. You can call my art red mythological weirdism. So just another interesting work that I thought we could see in passing. And look at this. So this looks like it's from the shining. And of course, red rum is supposed to be from the shining.
00:29:24.088 - 00:29:44.958, Speaker A: That reference. So maybe these little girls here are like this figure here. And Lily low. Lily illo. We have a few from her now. I don't know if, I don't think this is the one we looked at yesterday. It's very similar though, right? Because I think that other one had a detailed wallpaper.
00:29:44.958 - 00:30:04.750, Speaker A: So a similar piece. So GM, she's been putting out a lot of work. Like, we'll see another one here. See this one here, minted October 12. And then we go back to her page. That's way down here. Okay, so it's back to this AI.
00:30:04.750 - 00:30:33.944, Speaker A: You can be very prolific with AI art, but I mean, a very nice result, right? Did this sell? 60. 60. So imagine you're putting out like, let's just look at her activity very quickly as we wrap up here. So this work edition of ten, we see a lot of activity just in the last hour. A day ago, two days. So, you know, respectable. Very nice.
00:30:33.944 - 00:30:48.956, Speaker A: I mean, very respectable. So just interesting. And this is on auction right now. Zero bids, 21 hours to go. Minimum bid, 50. So interesting. So.
00:30:48.956 - 00:31:09.948, Speaker A: And just interesting style. So continuing on, quick work by Shilly Preston. I like his gallery works a lot, actually, which is why. So he's got a rare pepe in there. Pepe as pope on Time magazine, Warhol and his gallery contemplating Pope Pepe. And I guess that is Andy Warhol and his wig. I believe that was a wig.
00:31:09.948 - 00:31:29.316, Speaker A: It had to be a wig. Physical NFT draws grief lunch. This is just another beautiful work. I think she's burning them. Whatever isn't sold in like another day or so. So it's only 50 tazo cents. So, I mean, again, just a master of colored pencils.
00:31:29.316 - 00:31:51.648, Speaker A: I was tempted to start with this. I got really tempted to start with this awesome piece, this pancake meteor shower. You see the blueberry and the pancakes flying through space. Pancake meteor shower by illusion. T buy for only three. You know, my bias against like nfts of physical work. I still cover it here as we did with del cante draws.
00:31:51.648 - 00:32:16.232, Speaker A: But this is just an awesome piece. I mean, if I went into a gallery and I, you know, if they offered this to me for $80 or something for the physical work, I'm sure I'd buy it, you know. So very interesting. Finally here, more art on the phone, right? Look at how good that looks. I believe this is triple zero nine. Love this community. Thank you.
00:32:16.232 - 00:32:42.456, Speaker A: So putting zero zero nine blob work on the front of the phone and then this is. I just wanted to stop and wrap up with this. Everything is changing. Playing with combinations of AI and Ar again. This time I am using the target tracker in spark ar stable diffusion for generating images and frame interpolation ML for making animation. So pretty wild stuff. So there we have it.
00:32:42.456 - 00:32:45.624, Speaker A: Thank you for joining me once again. Until next time, take care.
