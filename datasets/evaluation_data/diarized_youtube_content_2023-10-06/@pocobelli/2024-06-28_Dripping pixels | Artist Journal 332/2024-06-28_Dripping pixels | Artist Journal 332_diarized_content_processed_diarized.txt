00:00:05.280 - 00:00:39.486, Speaker A: I feel like I'm swimming back to the ship. The ship is left without me and now I'm swimming furiously to get back on the ship so that we can continue our journey here. Thank you for your patience, everyone. Triumphant patience from everybody here who has been following this show. A weird amount of circumstances just led to this kind of sporadic show in the last few weeks. So again, thank you for all the support through that artist journal. June 28, 2024, broadcasting from Berlin, Germany.
00:00:39.486 - 00:01:12.018, Speaker A: I am back for a couple of shows here Friday and Monday. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and yeah, going to Spain, finally going to Spain on Tuesday and I'll be there just for a week. And then all the traveling should be mostly wrapped up. There may be other stuff coming down the pike in a month or two, but in a month, maybe six weeks. But nothing too crazy. I think we've gotten through the, the hump here. We've gotten over the hump and everything.
00:01:12.018 - 00:01:52.548, Speaker A: We've gotten through the storm, so to speak, to use our sea analogy that we love over here. And so now just finally, so there's going to be a show on today, of course, this show and Monday, then I'll have a week off and then I think it'll be the following Wednesday, just to keep on top of things. And what else was I going to say here? This is what I was going to say. This is not going to be like some comprehensive, bring you up to date show. This is me. I have a window here, as you can imagine, when you go on, you know, when you go away, even if you're working, there's still a massive catch up to do. So I had a massive catch up here.
00:01:52.548 - 00:02:26.932, Speaker A: I have a window of opportunity here today. And, you know, it is all about showing up, as I say this, after a sporadic couple of shows, but it really is all about showing up, and that's what I'm doing here today. I said to myself, it doesn't matter how long this show is, whatever, you just have to put something out today. So that's what I'm doing. So luckily, the artists, there's no shortage of brilliant artworks. I showed this to a friend of mine. I was just in Brazil and this came out, I don't know, a week ago from Zuozo, the plant computer, which I'm about to hit play on.
00:02:26.932 - 00:02:47.332, Speaker A: He didn't know. He was asking me about what I'm up to and I was like, oh, yeah, doing this YouTube thing. And of course, most people have no idea what we're up to over here. You and me both. And so I was like, well, here's the work that just came out. It's called plant computer. And this is what I showed my good friend Ryan in Brazil.
00:02:47.332 - 00:03:24.570, Speaker A: So I try not to kill our audio again. Scotch tape and scissors here, my friends. Let's see if we can hit play on this. It's tempting to call genius artwork here by Zozo. Zoom in. I mean, it's brilliant. Again, I don't know what they're doing in the museums, but this is what we're up to over here.
00:03:24.570 - 00:03:44.530, Speaker A: This is what we're up to over here. Like, this is rad. Like, what? Is this what I love, what I absolutely love about Zozo. Swear, my friend was like. My friend was so impressed. He was like, what on earth was that? I. Well, I kept.
00:03:44.530 - 00:04:28.919, Speaker A: He's like. I kept on watching that on loop, you know? So Zozo again, it's like, yeah, this is what we're up to over here. I say proudly, these artists. My God, you know, and I only discovered Zuozo, I want to say, like, maybe four months ago or something. Five, six months ago. It's kind of a recent discovery, you know, in quotes there. And the title again, like, if I walked into any institution, you know, here, like, you know, hamburger Banoff, anyone, like, you know, the kindle that they have here in Berlin, kind of contemporary art, you know, and they showed this, I would be like, wow, this is rad.
00:04:28.919 - 00:04:48.235, Speaker A: Like, capital r rad. So here's more plant virtuality. I mean, and just the title, the concept, the zoom ins. My friend has done, you know, who I showed this to, has done documentary film. He's like, I want to make nfts. After he saw that, you know, he's like. And the zoom, like, how it zooms in.
00:04:48.235 - 00:05:04.790, Speaker A: Like, he loved the directing of the work. And even, like, the subtitle here, technological nature. This has all been, like, figured out. Kobe gets it. It was on the market for, like, an hour. Unfortunately. Like, I would have just jumped on that.
00:05:04.790 - 00:05:20.080, Speaker A: 22 tezos. Sorry. Emir Gork resells it for only 33. I mean, this. You could add a zero, as far as I'm concerned, on this thing. Like, this is. This is a head turning work, uh, from Zozo plant, computer, something.
00:05:20.080 - 00:05:53.338, Speaker A: Again, people who have never experienced digital art, like, in the way that we're experiencing it over here. Uh, like, this is like a holy moly moment. Holy moly. What on earth is going on over here? Like, this is. It's back to the undeniable is undenied. As David Hickey, the great art historian, was saying in reference to Rauschenberg, Robert Rauschenberg, undeniable is undenied. And my God, you know, to quote William Burroughs, you know, Zuozo plant virtuality.
00:05:53.338 - 00:06:28.026, Speaker A: Let's see what else the mysterious, magnificent le manifique zuozo is up to here. A follow up work to plant computer. Look at these brilliant clouds. All the decisions. You know, one of the things I love about Zozo's work is how I would never make this work in a billion years. Like, that's. That's one of the things I love about it, because, like, it's so original.
00:06:28.026 - 00:07:01.280, Speaker A: Like, I don't even know what to compare it to. Like, what is this? You know, here's another one. This is called plant body. It almost gives, like, a swamp thing. Like, for me, I'm like, maybe swamp thing, you know? Like, that's how kind of far off the references I have to go. I mean, it's kind of computery, like, video gamey, kind of. It's kind of got a weird.
00:07:01.280 - 00:07:21.094, Speaker A: I'm almost tempted to say. And you see Zuozo's name, like, a japanese feeling, maybe. I'm gonna see if we can get Zuozo on the spaces. I mean, I just want to learn more about this incredible artist. Plant a book. So I'll just. Before I hit play on this one, so you can see Plant city and plant house.
00:07:21.094 - 00:07:42.230, Speaker A: I actually got one of these. I got inside plant house. So if you're quick, you can get a zuozo here. Plant a book. They're coming out these one of wands. Like, I can't think of a better deal in art, you know, other than wok, you know, but these are even cheaper than a wok, you know, a wok physical for, like, â‚¬100. That's ridiculous.
00:07:42.230 - 00:08:09.158, Speaker A: So here you have a Zozo digital art, and I'm not serving my collection well by, you know, broadcasting to the world here that these works are cheap as hell and cheap as heck, as we like to say over here. And. But all to say, I mean, what an artist. What an unbelievable artist. So you see the plant theme. Love it. Love it to death here.
00:08:09.158 - 00:08:33.840, Speaker A: And here is another one. Plant a book. Let's see. Let's see what happens here to joy. This is joyful arthem. This is happy art. Interestingly, like, it's art that brings joy.
00:08:33.840 - 00:09:31.630, Speaker A: It seemed like there was maybe 40 years there where that was not. Like, where that was not allowed or that was not something to be done. The serious art is not joyful. Was kind of like what you could, you know, you could argue was an underlying, unspoken how dare your art be joyful. Well, I submit to, you know, I declare it thus to quote, I think, samuel Johnson kicking the piece of matter, referring, responding to who was it the great idealist philosopher who was saying everything was made, George who said everything was made of mind. And then Samuel Johnson, I don't know if this is apocryphal or not, kicks the stone and says, I refute it thus, you know, and I refute this idea that we can't have joyful art. I refute it thus with Zozo.
00:09:31.630 - 00:09:49.212, Speaker A: Genius. It's tempting to call it genius. You don't want to use these words like masterpiece and genius to masterpiece and genius too loosely. But I mean holy. Right? Holy. Anyway, let's continue here. Thank you, Skomra.
00:09:49.212 - 00:10:13.380, Speaker A: Awesome space from Skomra. And of course, runetune co hosting that really cool, awesome space on Wednesday that is in the feed. You can find it. And soon enough, now that I'm back, I hope to put these on Spotify. I need to do a six month update for Spotify. I should be doing these regularly. But just, and just a big thank you to Skomra.
00:10:13.380 - 00:10:40.144, Speaker A: I also, I don't know if I mentioned this like this one, I showed the Twitter, of course I use it for the profile now, but Skommer sent this to me around May 31 and I just wanted to say thank you for that. Just awesome portrait there. So thank you for that. Go in the collection. NfT bubble burst comments so thank you for all the comments, everyone. It was a fun show out there from my bedroom in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Kyle Flemmer.
00:10:40.144 - 00:11:03.176, Speaker A: Our living room couch is pretty much the same pattern as your childhood wallpaper, which, as you see here, is this beautiful floral design, inspired, I think, from 1970s interior decorating. Shout out to mom for and also my dad for the decisions there. Kelly Burns. Wow. Thank you so much, Adrian. Means a lot here. And so Kells, of course, has a YouTube show, so do check that out.
00:11:03.176 - 00:11:28.190, Speaker A: Truly delighted broadcast from your childhood bedroom. The wallpaper tells us much about how you became the pokebelly we all know. So thank you, Kells. Appreciate that. And yeah, indeed, perhaps it had an oversized influence on my development to buy eagles Field. Great conversation on minting and storage. Right? So I believe this was the whole blockchain debate.
00:11:28.190 - 00:12:05.854, Speaker A: Which blockchain? BTC, bitcoin, rune tune. Provoking a conversation here. Yeah, very small size art to go on blockchain, because as far as I understand it. So to go on chain, in other words, to not use ipfs or ifps, international interplanetary ipfs, interplanetary file storage, very small size art to go on blockchain. Because as far as I understand it, it's piggybacking the ledger metadata rather than by design. Yeah, like, as far as I understand, on chain art, it's because it's all going on chain. So you don't have a ton of space.
00:12:05.854 - 00:12:53.700, Speaker A: That's very expensive, I assume from this, and I may be wrong, that the space would be ridiculously expensive to be on the blockchain. You can get fantastic art from size constraint mediums, of course. So do you think Tezos missed a trick by not having some options of limited size? And they could do some variations in formats too. Pixel art, vector, and possibly some other methods of storing interesting aesthetics governed by their compression methods. Now, there is like, if you know, eight badoo, if I understand the comment right here, to buy to Biclesfield, if I understand the comment right, there is eight baidu, which is, I think they have 24 by 24 pixel. You have eight by eight pixel. And we've gotten comments here in the past referencing how that is all on chain.
00:12:53.700 - 00:13:19.820, Speaker A: So there is. There are like Tezos type solutions, of course. What I would like to see, though, is a solution like, I don't see, you know, I don't know how complicated it is. And I mentioned this last two shows, I think, so I don't need to repeat it over and over here, but I'll see it quickly. What I'd love to see is if Tezos just expanded the block size. It's all they do here. And I should.
00:13:19.820 - 00:14:08.860, Speaker A: Where did that, like, come from? I don't know if you saw that. Like, that just kind of appeared on the screen there. Anyway, I don't know why they don't just expand the block size, you know, it's probably very complicated is why they don't do it. Or if they're, you know, and, you know, because we hear bitcoin, four megabytes, why don't you have like a 200 megabyte blockchain? And then everything goes on to the blockchain, like on chain, then you're not relying on ipfs, you know, again, it's just somewhere a point of failure, we might call it there, relying on that. So as far as your question, though, or your comment, I would say eight baidu, if I'm not mistaken. I've always been massively opposed to fees too. It's usually conflated value and artistic substance.
00:14:08.860 - 00:14:46.020, Speaker A: Yeah, put it this way, I've opposed them, like when. Put it this way, when you're paying, I've paid as high as $200, maybe more, $250 at the height of the bull market in 2021 to mint on Ethereum, which still uses ipfs that I am opposed to as well. I don't feel as bad about it minting or inscribing on bitcoin. Like, I just paid $90 actually to put a palm tree. I'll have to show that. Not today, because I'm getting already weird, kind of freezing up here. We just got to get through this show and show up.
00:14:46.020 - 00:15:17.276, Speaker A: But I just meant to say, if you go to my ordinals page, you'll see like a palm tree that was like 70, maybe 60 or 70 kb large work. But it only cost me, I think it was $90 actually, which is super cheap because fees are low right now. So I do find it. I don't feel so bad about doing that on bitcoin because this could be, you know, there's Michael Saylor. You just put out an interview. This is economic immortality. And maybe Michael Saylor is overstating it.
00:15:17.276 - 00:15:39.980, Speaker A: Maybe he's not to a certain degree, though, like as far, this could be around for tens of thousands of years or at least two. Right. Or one or 500 years. That's not nothing. Right. And maybe it gets transferred to the next tech, should there be another 500 years. So I don't mind, you know, because again, I think we're in this very.
00:15:39.980 - 00:16:39.490, Speaker A: And I want to make a video of this pronto because fees are cheap right now on how to inscribe on, like, make an ordinal on bitcoin. Because I think we're in this little window of opportunity where artists can upload for not insane amounts of money. To me, it's an opportunity, like, I hear what you're saying on the fees for Ethereum on bitcoin, because it's, again, it's going up to interplanetary file server. You're not even getting it on chain, right? But for bitcoin, you're getting it on chain. And I think we're in this little window of opportunity before bitcoin could really go past, like, where we can't catch it. And as artists put work on that's more than 2 kb without, you know, breaking the bank and the computing time, people aren't, you know, if we go to mempool here, just very quickly, I'll just show you, like, we're at like eight to twelve v bytes. If you wait, look, even the no priority is down to six, like you can see here.
00:16:39.490 - 00:16:57.990, Speaker A: And I'll show this in the video. This is the mempool for bitcoin. You can see how much it's costing. 13. This is pretty expensive. But you look, just 2 hours ago, eight v bytes is a good amount, right? That's what I did for the 70 kb file that cost me like $95.90, $95.
00:16:57.990 - 00:17:22.750, Speaker A: So now it's at 14, but you look, no priority down at six. Like, it's working through this whole. This used to be one to eight sats, now it's down to seven. That means that they're working through this really low fee structure here. Anyways, I'll save that for the video. But all to say, if you can get it at eight, when you see eights across here, that's when it's cheap. And again, I'm going to go back into that.
00:17:22.750 - 00:18:05.470, Speaker A: So I see it as a window of opportunity, and I don't feel so bad if one of my artworks is there for, you know, potentially thousands of years, especially in this little window, when you can put that much, you know, file size on the blockchain. So I see it as opportunity. I don't feel the same way outside of bitcoin, though. It's kind of like, you know, the longer I'm in this space, and I think a lot of people are kind of feeling this in the whole crypto markets. You're seeing it in the altcoins. I think the longer you are in the space, all of a sudden, I understand the people who've been in the space since, like, 2013, and they're just like, not about altcoins anymore. I'm starting to understand, and you kind of got to learn the lesson for yourself.
00:18:05.470 - 00:18:33.464, Speaker A: So, again with BTC, I see an opportunity, and that window could close tomorrow. If all of a sudden, BTC goes up 20% or even 10%, the fees are then going to go up, because then everybody's going to be doing their ordinals and ruined stuff, and you're going to lose your opportunity. So this could be it. I'm hoping we have chop for six months and, you know, or even goes down. I'm happy if it goes down for two years as an artist. Let's continue. Love the wallpaper.
00:18:33.464 - 00:18:45.464, Speaker A: It's a seventies psychedelic wonder. Thank you. Crash. Stop. Shout out again to the parents. Welcome to Brazil, and you may enjoy our winter. You know what I'm thinking? I loved my time in Brazil.
00:18:45.464 - 00:19:24.040, Speaker A: I was in a really interesting area near northeastern Brazil, near Fort Aleza, there's some kind of nice. We went dune buggies on the beach as well as there's dunes. Like, there's so much beach over there, white sand beach, that it literally turns into dunes, you know, like 500 meters a kilometer inland. Thank you for that. I kind of want to go during the. Go to South America during our winter over here in Europe. Summer is beautiful here in Europe, but the real time I'm excited to go to South America is maybe January, February, so maybe like, that's where it's 30 degrees, you know? And so let's continue here.
00:19:24.040 - 00:19:42.824, Speaker A: Let's continue. Rune tune. Thank you, Adrian, for the very thoughtful commentary on my skepticism over pricey inscription. I'm not sure how I feel about it now, but your response has softened my viewpoint. I love that the file size limitations gave you such a formative creative breakthrough with the Pixel art Inferno series. You make excellent points. Thank you, Runetune, and thank you for bringing that up.
00:19:42.824 - 00:19:57.272, Speaker A: I think a lot of people. I got a few comments. People love that discussion. So Rune tune, provoking another super interesting discussion here is limbo. Hi, Adrian, also known as Marco Maragi. Hi, Adrian. I'm here with a cup of coffee, enjoying the show.
00:19:57.272 - 00:20:10.584, Speaker A: Thanks a lot for the earworm shout out. And so, of course, limbo is putting out a comic on Solana. So far, a lot of great topics are being brought up. Cheers. Your friendly, distant neighborhood. Limbo indeed. I'll have to go to northern Italy sometime soon.
00:20:10.584 - 00:20:23.820, Speaker A: Practice my Italian pP universal. Thanks, Poco. Great show. Awesome to hear. And Jonathan Edward Gibson, longtime listener. It's just awesome to hear from you on the road home. Indeed, indeed.
00:20:23.820 - 00:20:44.260, Speaker A: Yeah, the long road home. It was good to be back and reconnect in Saskatoon, that fishbone. No, you don't understand. You can also make nonsense with AI. Instead of it being an exploration of your own subconscious by letting your ideals flow from your mind to your hand. You just click button until something looks kind of neat. It's totally the same of self expression, guys.
00:20:44.260 - 00:21:11.176, Speaker A: So it sounds sarcastic, but, you know, like, you know, I think this is sarcasm. I'm usually the last to recognize that. But you know what? Like, this is actually very much how I work. It's an exploration of your own subconscious by letting your ideas flow from your mind to your hand. You just click buttons until something starts to look good. That's not that far from what I do. As a matter of fact, it's totally the same as self expression.
00:21:11.176 - 00:21:44.596, Speaker A: I mean, it's about the results in large measure. Put it this way, I think we can. One of the measures we can have here are the results. And if it gets too easy, I mean, this is a very early debate we discussed here on AI. I think there's an early show, like episode 50, where we're looking at strange thing, and strange thing has the beautiful masterpiece thug lord. Pivotal work, I'd argue, in the AI art space. I, you know, that's what I would put in the moma entrance.
00:21:44.596 - 00:22:48.396, Speaker A: You know, were at my decision when I was, that was when I had to deal with AI art because I go, what do I do with this? I was thinking like, is this pushing a button? And I think that was the name of the show, is AI put? Is, is this pushing a button? Is AI art? You know, you push a button, you get it, and then look at what I did. The reality, though, is if you've actually tried making AI art and if you actually study it and look at what's come out, you really do start to be able to sort, as they would say, the wheat from the chaff. There is a spectrum of quality, and within your own work, even you could say, as you're making it, and you can start to see, okay, it's not as easy as it looks. And all this stuff that looks easy, well, a million other people are doing that too, so it doesn't look super original. So it's kind of about being that top 10% of quality that's hard to make right. Like, there's a lot of great artists and it's not easy. Like, try reproducing a lily illo, see how you do, you know? So if this is, if I am interpreting this right, that would be my response.
00:22:48.396 - 00:23:07.800, Speaker A: Like, let's see what you're up to with AI art and then show us how easy it is. Okay, continue. But thank you for the comment, by the way, and all comments are appreciated here. Ex Cerentia, you silver wolf. I don't know if that's referring to the hairdouse. That's one of the things I liked about Skommer's piece there. It was nice and kind of dark hair all across.
00:23:07.800 - 00:23:29.896, Speaker A: I felt ten years younger just looking at it, looking at the community, artist journal community. And you can find that on my profile, actually. Just go here. I got a question about it today, and you see my profile and just click on artist journal. Community. As you'll see, the Internet is working. The Internet is working like a dream here so far.
00:23:29.896 - 00:23:43.116, Speaker A: So that is fabulous. And look at who's back. Speaking of fabulous, look who's back. Rosaceo with a new work here. And so this is a free mint. And look at this. So Rosacea took a little break and is back.
00:23:43.116 - 00:23:56.068, Speaker A: Zero plus mint fee. The super chief gallery and remote control. So super chief props app. Maybe that's not imprompts. That's a different one, I think. Claim your free mint anyway, of a rosaceo. Beautiful work here.
00:23:56.068 - 00:24:14.900, Speaker A: So coming back with a slightly different feel. Similar but different. So awesome to hear from Rosaceo in the community there. Thank you for bringing that to my attention. If you ever want to bring your art to, you know, to maybe, you know, it gets on the show actually is what happens. Feel free to post here. Try and do like one a week.
00:24:14.900 - 00:24:31.934, Speaker A: Put your favorite a week. Some people kind of can over post sometimes, so just try and be moderate about it. Let everybody else have their work scene too and everything as well. Santiago, escomra today was amazing. So referring to the space, it was a great space. Super interesting space. Escomra floor.
00:24:31.934 - 00:24:46.970, Speaker A: Good morning journal. So beautiful work here. And where is this? This is called caterpillar dreams. So kind of a semi abstract work here. Interesting digital art. And of course, a great Kurt hussle collective on Zora. And just super cool work here.
00:24:46.970 - 00:25:11.576, Speaker A: Even some audio, you gotta love it. From folder to screen to world Wide Web. Kind of a symbolic work here from J and K posting the folder. Remysylium. New work owed to Antilopus. Ode to Antilopus. If I'm pronouncing that right, that is on Zora.
00:25:11.576 - 00:25:23.622, Speaker A: Very cool work. And little cakes was on fellowship AI. So that is cool. So check that out. It is posted in the community simulacro. And I brought up a simulacro work. Thank you for posting.
00:25:23.622 - 00:25:40.602, Speaker A: And this was awesome too. We have a simulacra work later in the show. This was super cool too. I've never seen this artist before. So this is a great thing about the community. Morgan Higbee flowers, just totally different kind of artwork discovery here. Chris Warr.
00:25:40.602 - 00:26:12.398, Speaker A: And who is the electronic, well known electronic music artist, also digital art maker. So, you know, you can guarantee or you can assume produced by Chris Werther and some cool shipping containers. Very topical. Trade disruption act J and K. Another work from Kurt Hussle collective. So just very cool works here. And this is on object, this one.
00:26:12.398 - 00:26:24.562, Speaker A: And skull takes and we can't go. So there's a lot of ketchup to do here. Case, surreal. Very cool work. Ernesto with another work here. Thank you for posting and simulacru. This is the work.
00:26:24.562 - 00:27:00.884, Speaker A: We will see that later in the show. Martin Jo awesome new work on tazos from Martin Jo. I'm seeing a ton of people post on Zora and you know, I always say like, the artists are like the devs, they follow the liquidity and people are posting on Zora. This is a really cool work. Also, this is by Leijo. This is posted by Lejo X, generisis Oxdk and this was really cool by lajo x themselves. Just kind of a cool stamp.
00:27:00.884 - 00:27:16.988, Speaker A: Look at that tank. Almost pixel art tank. So skull takes and we'll have to. And we're actually going to look at this closer. Trippy collector posting the new. What is this? You'd call it like a PFP profile picture collection from Hastrubal waffle. I love how we got a few.
00:27:16.988 - 00:27:35.680, Speaker A: As you'll see up here, we have a few open sea series that are coming. I love the timing of it. As open sea volume starts to die. Enter the tezos. Or a lot of just digital artists that are all of a sudden enjoying the space now that it's dead or dying a little bit. Or at least we'll call it in a bear. Who knows? In a lull.
00:27:35.680 - 00:27:45.730, Speaker A: In a lull. Anyways, let's continue. Okay. Nart. Cool work. Looks like photographic, perhaps AI bosque. Gracias.
00:27:45.730 - 00:28:05.674, Speaker A: Cool. I need to actually message bosque, who may now in Lisbon, at Lisbon, made in Berlin, Ernesto Ash and several more. So Diane Lindo. So thank you. This is everything I would hope for from the community. I'm going to start posting article links too, once in a while. So just more cool work here.
00:28:05.674 - 00:28:18.226, Speaker A: There is a ton to get through. Just hilarious work here. Brilliant work as ever from the Kurt hussle collective. And some cool AI artwork from Santiago. Thank you, everybody for posting. Oxdk. Look at that.
00:28:18.226 - 00:28:45.156, Speaker A: So just a ton to go through here. But isn't this great? I mean, it's almost like a kind of, you know, it's great. It's almost like a kind of submissions, you know, of sort of sorts here. Like, this is just awesome. Just post your work if you're interested in just sharing it with the community. Now let's go. We're already half an hour in here and I don't have a ton of time, actually, already kind of breaking deadlines here, Beanie.
00:28:45.156 - 00:29:09.790, Speaker A: Let's go. So continuing with this PFP generative art NFT kinda super bear, some people think going to zero. I don't think it's gonna go that far, but let's just see. So, Beanie, controversial account, but with some interesting posts here. A few months ago, squiggles dao. So squiggles are these abstract artworks here, and they are animated, and they go for a fortune. I think they were going for ten eth at one point.
00:29:09.790 - 00:29:35.340, Speaker A: They're called squiggles. So the Squiggles dao took a $1 million loan to buy more squiggles. Since then, the floor price has been cut in half, and that was a few months ago, and liquidity non existent. And this is the issue. I've been calling this a liquidity market. That's why we're seeing the kind of crunching of the contemporary art market. You're not seeing a total crunch, like warhols.
00:29:35.340 - 00:30:00.782, Speaker A: There's still a good market for impressionist paintings. There is still a good market for. It's the stuff on the. It's like the smaller liquidity sort of stuff, the more edgy contemporary art, the big installations by artists you haven't heard before that are going for a million, $2 million, $500,000. That's the stuff that's kind of getting killed in this market. You're seeing the same thing in crypto as altcoins start to kind of get crunched. This is a liquidity market.
00:30:00.782 - 00:30:40.300, Speaker A: It's kind of like people want safety with their money right now. They still want to invest, but they don't want to be in something in a $2 million market cap altcoin or stock or a very expensive artwork. So there's no sensible economic reason for the Dow to pay to repay this loan. So they took out a million dollar loan as the collateral value likely isn't even half the loan value. So quite interesting development on these are kind of iconic of the 2021 bull market, as the cryptopunks were and are. And actually, we're going to see a little bit more now. Snowfro is the artist, I believe, who put the squiggles together.
00:30:40.300 - 00:31:07.380, Speaker A: Here's another post the next day, more evidence that the generative art bubble has burst. Full spectrum squiggle went for 16 ETH at Sotheby's, which is about a 90% loss for the seller. So was this going for. So this sold for $57,000.01 of this squiggle here, a full color one. This was also used as collateral for many loans at har 30 ETH valuation. I mean, this, that's off the charts.
00:31:07.380 - 00:31:31.338, Speaker A: ETH, of course, is almost $4,000, right? I mean, so, I mean, is that millions of dollars maybe 7800. That's just wild. Like, I mean, clearly, maybe it was 800,000. I need to get my calculator on that one. The loan default fallout is the next shoe to drop. It's coming. So a lot of people in the crypto space were taking loans out using these squiggles as collateral.
00:31:31.338 - 00:31:57.514, Speaker A: If it's worth a million bucks, hey, let's give a loan. And what I understand, from what I understand what Beanie is saying, don't pay back the loan, just let your squiggle go. They gave you, they lent you way too much money, in other words, and you're kind of better off keeping the loan and losing your squiggle. Pretty interesting. It sounds like it's about 50%. What they'll give you the loan for wildness. Liquidation cascade on crypto punks down.
00:31:57.514 - 00:32:22.810, Speaker A: So this was on June 21, and we are at June 28. So about a week ago, we were seeing crypto punks. I think they're back around 28, 29 ETH as a floor, but we're seeing it as low as 22, 21, 0.78 ETH as fear enters the market here. A liquidation cascade. Punks 22 eth. Am I dreaming? So, yeah, so, pretty interesting.
00:32:22.810 - 00:33:00.580, Speaker A: The legacy, and we actually have another punks thing. But here, the legacy ethereum NFT market keeps falling after the main blur farmer pulls bids. As I've been saying for a couple of years now, the bubble popped. What you're witnessing is typical deflation. Prices were artificially held up by points farming, but that has come to an end. So if you're not in crypto, this may seem like a foreign language to you, but basically what Beanie is saying here is buying and selling these nfts on the blur platform was giving you points that were kind of redeemable, or they'd give you crypto for it, for. For buying and selling nfts.
00:33:00.580 - 00:33:39.080, Speaker A: And as far as I understand, what Beanie is saying, that was artificially supporting prices. Now that the farming or the point making is over and you no longer get that crypto, the liquidity is being pulled from the market. And here we see bored apes again, which were at 150 ETH. Now at nine, we'll have to look on maybe the next episode where they are the mutant apes, which were at 15 we're looking at, are now at 1.61. So down 90%, and it may not be over yet. So here's another one post. Somebody just sold these crypto punk nfts for a combined $600,000 loss, both purchased in 2021.
00:33:39.080 - 00:34:06.166, Speaker A: So you're seeing massive losses. This looks like a very nice one. Same account is selling this one too, and paid about $200,000 more than current market value. So pretty interesting. Now, interestingly, I suspect this is someone trying to kind of juice the market a little bit. Pablo Puncaso sells one of the works was offered 250 ETH, or 838,000. So the other side of the story is you are getting.
00:34:06.166 - 00:34:32.166, Speaker A: You did see a work sell for almost a million dollars here. Kind of a more iconic one with the hoodies. These are more desirable. And that sold for $840,000. I suspect kind of bucking the trend. But I suspect when I saw this, I thought, eh, someone's trying to prop this market up. Like, oh, if I do a kind of insane amount, maybe prices will come back.
00:34:32.166 - 00:34:45.810, Speaker A: I don't think it worked. Last I looked it was maybe 29. I think it's just not the. They could come back at some point. But I think it's just the nature of this market. Right down market right now, again, it's a liquidity market. Right.
00:34:45.810 - 00:35:09.078, Speaker A: So continuing on, Sabato. Sabato at the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City, which I think is a pretty interesting museum. This is in New York City. Museum is the only us museum devoted to film, television, television and digital media. In other words, gifs and whatnot. Now open Thursday to Sunday. Admission tickets available online.
00:35:09.078 - 00:36:01.600, Speaker A: So Tezos, working with the moving image, working with the moving Image museum of the moving image, have partnered up and they started with a few artists, including Sabato. It starts with Barbie world breakdown by the first commissioned artist, Sabato Visconti at museum of the moving Image Schlosser media wall. So big congrats to Sabato and that awesome, awesome series. And the thing is, like, we're still seeing a lot of. You see how Zuozo is selling out. Within minutes. You're seeing Sabato, you know, like the great thing again, and I keep repeating this about Tezos art is it's so cheap that you don't feel like, you know, even if it goes to nothing, even if it all gets disrupted, quantum whatever disrupts the blockchain, who knows? Cracks it.
00:36:01.600 - 00:36:28.384, Speaker A: You still, like, you're not losing a ton by spending, you know, $15 on a zwozo. One of one. Same with these. Like, Sabato works like, you get really high quality art. My friend who I was showing the Zozo, he's like, how much was that? You know, we want to buy. I mean, I would call him like, your typical kind of person outside of the bubble, who was like, this is amazing, right? And to me that. That's interesting, interesting feedback.
00:36:28.384 - 00:36:47.656, Speaker A: I was expecting him to think it was cool. I wasn't expecting him to start wanting to make nfts and maybe collecting them. Right? So pretty interesting. There are a few artists in this. We can't read all this. We're already 36 minutes in and we have to make sure this computer does not crash on us. The art newspaper here.
00:36:47.656 - 00:37:02.000, Speaker A: This was in the art newspaper. I almost forgot to mention though. I mean, there's Sabato. You have to see this. A piece of the action music. So here's the art newspaper. Prominent, prominent art media publication.
00:37:02.000 - 00:37:30.120, Speaker A: Hilariously, one of my contemporary art friends was actually on the COVID at the Basel art Basel edition of the art newspaper. We'll have to show that at a certain point. But here, the art newspaper, there's Sabato. Sabato's work. Sabato Visconti's Barbie world breakdown. So more bullishness. Interestingly, in this market, the Internet, who goes to websites anymore, you know, as they encumber on to us.
00:37:30.120 - 00:37:42.800, Speaker A: But this is totally awesome. Hopefully that's in the print too. Sobeto should try and get a copy of that. Just awesome. So big congrats there. There are other artists there too. I don't see them, like clearly mentioned.
00:37:42.800 - 00:38:02.594, Speaker A: Maybe. Alexandra Atomorfeska, head of arts for Trill Tech. So you can read the article. We can't go through everything. Here's also museum of the moving image easel engine. And here you have Sabato in partnership with Tezos. So Tezos, I think Tezos, I think they already knew that art was kind of their main thing.
00:38:02.594 - 00:38:35.938, Speaker A: But it really is, as you see, the altcoins kind of get crushed in this market. When we have more time, we can pay a little bit more attention to the financial side of the crypto market. But you're seeing them get crushed. Absolutely crushed. But I think tezos can be like, hey, we have a real use case here. Interestingly, Zora is picking up steam though. Like, I am seeing more and more artists using Zora because I think just the money, like, it's good economics and artists gotta do what they have to do, what they have to do.
00:38:35.938 - 00:38:59.248, Speaker A: So continuing on, go young with a comment here. Who makes these beautiful artworks that we've seen before? I took a break for a month. For the first time. I spent a month not creating any work and just getting to know myself, discovering what I like and dislike. I realized that I didn't know myself as I thought. Now I have a clearer idea of what I want to do and what I want to create. It will take a long time, but I'll build my story at my own pace and vibe.
00:38:59.248 - 00:39:37.388, Speaker A: So spoken as a true artist there. And there is a virtue in taking breaks. Even me coming back here fresh, the break was too long, in my opinion, and it's still kind of again, I'll do a show on Monday, take another week off, and then I'll be back more on a regular schedule, at least for a full month. But there is a virtue in taking breaks. Like, even if it's a couple of weeks and then coming back to your work and go, what am I doing here again? You know, getting some distance, some perspective on your work. So interesting thought from Goyeong Xerox. The surest path towards success is to just keep arting, no matter what.
00:39:37.388 - 00:39:59.664, Speaker A: And this is what I'm really excited about in this scene. As you know, there's all, as we saw with Beanie, all of this kind of chaos in the market. I love how much people, like, I don't feel like a lot of the artists that we pay attention to here have missed a beat. Like, they keep just going. And that makes me excited. I'm excited. I'm putting all sorts of stuff on ordinals.
00:39:59.664 - 00:40:42.440, Speaker A: That's kind of like, that's what artists do. A good market is great, but I actually like the bear markets more in terms of, I just don't have the distraction of, like, holy, this stuff's going up like crazy. And that's what you're focused on. When you don't have that distraction of the economic side of things. When you don't have the distraction of getting rich, it's actually really good for your art because all of a sudden you're like, okay, what am I doing here again? What am I doing with my digital art? And you can afford to, you know, mint it a lot easier, too, and cheaper on blockchains like ethereum and bitcoin, for example. Before web3, I thought art was a noun, but ask anyone here and they'll tell you it's actually a verb. I'm arting all over the place these days.
00:40:42.440 - 00:40:54.584, Speaker A: So another cool comment from Xerox. Big shout out to Xerox. Strange thing. First breakout post for another app. Small wins 54,000 on post three. It looks like TikTok. It is.
00:40:54.584 - 00:41:15.674, Speaker A: I'm surprised strange thing has taken so long to get to TikTok and look at that strangething. AI very smart here as far as a handle. And I wonder if that's strange Things website. We'll have to look again at another point. 54,000. Yeah. Like, there's something very TikTok esque, and there's a virality to strange things work.
00:41:15.674 - 00:41:37.298, Speaker A: So, you know, I've put a couple of. From our Twitter spaces, I put a couple of, I think, gogolitis. I have a quote. I think I put up a sabato work. They got, like, a, you know, interesting amount of views as far as expanding, it's just a matter of time. I am not even uploading them to Spotify right now, just because of time, just to do this work right now. Again, I'm kind of breaking deadlines here.
00:41:37.298 - 00:41:52.772, Speaker A: Let's continue. Element ly. Scales. So traveling through the mediums here. Element ly. Look at how great this is. So this looks like, if I had to guess, maybe let's see if we can get actually a closer look.
00:41:52.772 - 00:42:24.440, Speaker A: It kind of looks like a. One of those, I think you'd call them japanese. Is it japanese closet? Or there's a word for it, for these kind of screens, right, where you maybe get dressed behind it or something. So element li. Using cardboard to make one of these japanese, if I'm not mistaken, screens and reconceptualizing it as an artwork. Putting paint, I believe, on top here. Right? Painting on top of the cardboard.
00:42:24.440 - 00:42:40.992, Speaker A: This is paper. Putting paper just as well, frankly. And then on top. Oh, so this is probably printed, interestingly, or burned in. You would have to see it in person. And there's the signature. You know, I started signing my works on bitcoin.
00:42:40.992 - 00:43:17.240, Speaker A: I'll show them hopefully next episode. I will show them soon enough, because I thought, you know, if this thing is around for 10,000 years, maybe it won't be. But if it is, I kind of want to have my name on there just in case, you know, in case there are, you know, nuclear wars and nobody knows what anything is. And that's all we have left, the only data layer we have left, or even archaeologists, who knows? Thinking very long term here, you may want to sign your name if you're putting on your digital art. Sometimes I don't do it on. On any of the other ones, but bitcoin, I was like, this could be around a while. Maybe I'll sign this one.
00:43:17.240 - 00:43:42.816, Speaker A: These ones, we'll check those out soon enough. Walk order is chaos. So just walk in the studio, seeing again the master at work in the studio here, getting, I don't know how walk gets these incredible sprays, but just knows incredibly well what he's doing. And some great pP universal drawings here. Totally awesome. Some physicals. I'm ready for the death of nfts.
00:43:42.816 - 00:43:54.840, Speaker A: Just received some PP universal physical drawings. I love it. From Generis. Very cool and good. I am following generic. Oh, look at these. So hilarious.
00:43:54.840 - 00:44:17.350, Speaker A: Look at all these drawings. We're gonna have to scroll through kind of quick. Love the air. The fighter jet here. Something very kind of fun about it. Let's continue. Has strublewaffle 2600 Ad portraits from the year 2600 AD as told by time traveler Kujeb Shero, also known as his drubble waffles, created from memory on an emulated amiga 1200 using ditch paint.
00:44:17.350 - 00:44:40.340, Speaker A: So this is something I've been thinking about for a long time and I kind of love now that Opensea is as we saw with Beanie, kind of. We saw the volume kind of collapse. Enter the artists. We have waffles, we have radae. You know, I love it. We have Santiago on a different platform. Who's this? We have demon ego, you know, hilarious.
00:44:40.340 - 00:44:55.640, Speaker A: I don't know if these are on base or not. That might also be part of the reason people are doing them. This looks like it's on Eth. Let me just look here, because I think, degens, this is on base. So waffles is on eth here. And I really love what waffles is doing here. This is.
00:44:55.640 - 00:45:21.460, Speaker A: It's kind of something I've thought about. Like, what if you were to just kind of start putting some. I don't want to say random, because they do make faces, but they're just two dots. Like, he's kind of putting scribbles together and then go, ho, boom. Put it into the PFP kind of maker machine and you get all these results. Like, what if I just put some layers together here, a loose version of a head. And I love it.
00:45:21.460 - 00:45:33.430, Speaker A: I absolutely love it. I picked up a few. I think I got three of these. Two or three of these I picked up. And so they're available now. They're not a bad floor price here at 0.01. So $30 each.
00:45:33.430 - 00:45:53.256, Speaker A: Are there any even available? There's one available, so get it while you can. So just very interesting and cool. 57 owners and it looks like it's sold out, I assume. Just awesome to see that. And rata degens by rada. So this is 0.013. I say healthy.
00:45:53.256 - 00:46:19.960, Speaker A: This is like $35. And you can get. And that's, you know, you can get this one here. Very cool. So this is Rada's PFP collection. This is on base based, one of one degenerative community by rata. So very nice looking PFP series here, as you see, like, to me, you know what's interesting? I'll tell you what's interesting on the PFP market from my perspective that I just kind of thought about today.
00:46:19.960 - 00:46:37.088, Speaker A: So we had all the pfps on ETh. We had mfers. We had, what else? We had the bored apes. We had all these different kind of PFP series. I can't even remember the names, in my opinion. Let's just leave it there. I can't remember the names.
00:46:37.088 - 00:47:14.456, Speaker A: There's the pudgy penguins, which are still doing well. And what we saw then was ordinals. We started seeing the puppets. Uh, there's the node monkeys. And all of a sudden, the pfps on bitcoin started to get a lot more attention. And what that kind of told me is, you know what? This PFP kind of meta it's been, or at least format, has hardly been explored. I mean, we have a few on ETh that have been put together, and all of a sudden there's, like, a new series that went on ordinals, and all of a sudden it's like, oh, those are just as good, if not way better.
00:47:14.456 - 00:47:47.906, Speaker A: One could argue the market has argued they go for way more money. Who cares about my opinion? The market is saying that. So we're just saying it as an observation here. And also, you're getting these better, and, you know, these ones that are more appreciated or more valued by the market, and all of a sudden, you go, there could be way better. You know, that just haven't even been done yet. Like, this has hardly been explored, this form. We've had a few, like, the artists, to me, like, I would argue a lot of what we've seen are devs putting together, you know, PFP collections.
00:47:47.906 - 00:48:17.856, Speaker A: And there's nothing wrong with that. But what about artists? You know, like, I'm like, once we see hasdrubal waffle, we're seeing rata. I mean, remember die with the most likes? That was one of my favorite kind of PFP collections with the. He had two, right? So, like, again, it makes. When I see these guys working here, it makes me go, yeah, like, this is. I still want to do this, you know? So I just think it's really cool. And Rata did a really nice job here as far as putting this all together.
00:48:17.856 - 00:48:33.280, Speaker A: You see, like, it's just different layers. Like, there's the hats, the same. And then you put in the randomizer. PFP maker. These variables. Just a beautiful, beautiful collection. So untapped territory, uncharted territory in large respects.
00:48:33.280 - 00:48:54.150, Speaker A: This whole kind of layer. Randomizer maker, or even just the PFP sort of things like these. Yeah, like, just really interesting works here. Here's improp. So now this is AI. This is by Santiago, as far as I understand here. And just putting together a very interesting series on improps.
00:48:54.150 - 00:49:07.798, Speaker A: And I think it sold out. This is on tazos. Only two tezos per work. Edition of 50. This came out January 18, so maybe I missed this. James Bloom collected three. Name eight things today by Santiago.
00:49:07.798 - 00:49:30.406, Speaker A: Great gen art series indeed. I love the contrast here between the super soft and the hard edge. Very nice series indeed. Here's demon ego. And I think this is from invitation by Opensea. Like, again, like, if Opensea, if I. Once again, if I ran the world, if I was at Opensea, why not? I would be saying, hey, thank you, waffles.
00:49:30.406 - 00:50:01.990, Speaker A: We see what you're doing here. Like, can we put this on the homepage for you? Thank you, rada. Can we put this on the homepage for you? Like, I mean, because they're losing volume incredibly. And it's sort of like we see with tezos as the market shifts and moves and the art live, the art is stays, you know, like, I'd argue that's why Tezos is still a thing. The art remains. Okay? Like, you know, like, if tazos didn't have all the art, it would probably be getting totally crushed. It'd be down at $0.20,
00:50:01.990 - 00:50:34.302, Speaker A: not 80 or 75, whatever it is now, right? Like, why would you have tezos if there's no art on it? And I think Opensea, even though it's not a blockchain, but they should be thinking along the same lines here. Like, what is going to last, right? So here's demon ego. So I think they're really smart to be inviting people like demon ego. Hey, put some stuff on the chain and we'll help promote it. Can you do something for us? So, June 2024, demon ego. 924,000 items created. So I don't know what's going on here.
00:50:34.302 - 00:50:49.810, Speaker A: Maybe that's people minting. That would be incredible if you got a million, 6000 owners. So I don't know how this all worked out. That sounds like almost like x copy with the fly. The mosquito or the fly. What is it called? Mutato. Mutatio.
00:50:49.810 - 00:51:10.402, Speaker A: Anyways, let's continue another masterpiece, another beautiful work. Let's call it better to understate than overstate. Another gorgeous work here by Murikit. Look at this. And it's almost like dripping pixels here. It's almost like dripping paint right there. That is not what that is, but it almost looks like it.
00:51:10.402 - 00:51:24.842, Speaker A: Look at this gorgeousness. And remember, we're talking about the animation. That is not animation. It's just movement. It just gives life to the image. It's not trying to make the two figures here move around. That's not the point of this animation.
00:51:24.842 - 00:51:55.616, Speaker A: This point of the animation is to kind of just create a small life in the image, which is a different kind of animation. And just beautiful textures here. There's something to. With combining illustration with this kind of rough pixelation. This again, like, this looks like a gorgeous painting. When I see what look like almost like drips, these digital textures, it's hard to leave. It is hard to leave.
00:51:55.616 - 00:52:24.728, Speaker A: Can I only too minted. Like, I need to go and mint all the mirapixels I can. That's something that, like, that's something to make time for, is just finding some works on Zora before they disappear. You could imagine these things being quite collectible. And I mean. I mean, what if there's only ten of these that are minted? You know, there's another 26 days to go, or even a hundred. But in 20 years, are you going to be able to get your little collection? Maybe no one will care.
00:52:24.728 - 00:52:42.060, Speaker A: Maybe they will really care. Continuing on, running fish, this superchief props app. So the wheels keep moving here on with digital art and the blockchain. You got to love it. Look how gorgeous this is. Let's see if there's volume. No volume on this beautiful work here.
00:52:42.060 - 00:53:15.206, Speaker A: As ridifish continues to develop here, this, this style, this theme, these colors, this translucent psychedelia, you know, just very, very powerful, gorgeous colors. Continues to just like, they just get better and better, don't they? Your cat swallowed my hand. Very cool type title here, too. So superchief props app. I have no idea. Another platform for you. And here's another one going multi chain here.
00:53:15.206 - 00:53:35.970, Speaker A: Rini fish on Tezos motherland. June 24. Escape the planet earth. Find the motherland. So, really loving what's happening with the colors and the backgrounds and the animations, right? Just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. What did that sell for? That sold for 95 tezos at auction. Not a bad price.
00:53:35.970 - 00:53:59.038, Speaker A: You know, again, this is like, that gets your grocery. That gets some pretty nice groceries these days. So nice work. Dana Ulama from new work. More new work. So whatever the market's doing, artists continue to deliver these beautiful works here. And of course, Dana Ulama has some works, I think, on super rare, a couple other platforms too.
00:53:59.038 - 00:54:21.120, Speaker A: Just a really cool artist and beautiful kind of, I want to say, cyberpunk meets vaporwave. Cyberwave. Is that what you'd call that? Viber? What is it? Vapor? Vapor punk? I don't know. But very cool work here. You see the cat, the depth of field, everything. Just a really cool artist. And here's another one.
00:54:21.120 - 00:54:42.650, Speaker A: Euxine skincare. Kind of a hilarious work here. Put on Zora and look at this. Great textured. See that? I don't know if you can see that. If you zoom in, unfortunately, this is the most we can zoom in on Zora, but at least they have the full screen. Now, if you zoom in, you can actually see just a slight bit of brushwork here.
00:54:42.650 - 00:55:04.302, Speaker A: Very nice, careful details here showing. And here, the brushwork is getting gorgeous, actually by Aksin, another artist who continues to evolve here in this kind of humorous work. And then contrasting, I mean, I think a wasteman. Gold minevitchen contrasting this and, yeah, I can't wait to look. I haven't. There's none in this show. We'll have to look.
00:55:04.302 - 00:55:23.558, Speaker A: There's actually, how did I forget? There's the pokebelly works. Yeah, we'll show that next show. Again, I'm just trying to show up here. What else did we have? Anyways, we'll get back to that. That great work. It's like my memory here. Anyways, beautiful work.
00:55:23.558 - 00:55:36.918, Speaker A: Hilariously, the skeleton kind of crypto figure. Beautifully, beautifully painted. Oh, it was international Pokebelly Day. That was hilarious. Anyways, we'll take a look at those works next episode when we have a little bit more time. That was awesome. Thank you.
00:55:36.918 - 00:55:58.078, Speaker A: Retro Manny. Who's actually going to be on the spaces. That was planned way beforehand, by the way, and going to be on the next spaces. Anyways, everywhere I look on this work is beautiful. And what I was going to say here, it's like the waistband, Goldman, the solid purple here. No texture contrasting with these kind of brushwork here. And then back to the skeletal things.
00:55:58.078 - 00:56:19.094, Speaker A: No texture within the work. Although the edges, you do have a little bit of texture. Anyways, just gorgeous work that's on Zora. Zora, Zora, Zora. As far as you're collecting, if you want to collect cheap Zora. And look at all the artists that are posting on Zora. Like how many did Oxyen sell here? Just for the sake of argument 98.
00:56:19.094 - 00:56:31.616, Speaker A: So bringing in a few hundred bucks here and now. And that was probably a very quick. Sometimes it's like a day or a week with Axeen. You got to be quick. And then getting some of these tokens here. So nice work. There's John Gates.
00:56:31.616 - 00:56:49.024, Speaker A: Awesome. Another beautiful work from another awesome artist. Jan Lucas Migone on Zora. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful little ethereum over the angel with the VR headset. Or the apple vision pro. Almost like a Saint Sebastian arrow coming into the baby here. Or the angelic figure.
00:56:49.024 - 00:57:10.890, Speaker A: This kind of looks like a bit of a pastiche from like a 17th, 18th century kind of ceiling. Kind of almost reminds you of Raphael here. The two, two cupids there at the bottom of that work. Just cool. Very, very cool. Nice picture. Just a beautiful digital painting by Jan Lucas Migone.
00:57:10.890 - 00:57:30.120, Speaker A: Here is Ed Morolla. I mean, the art has not slowed down, as you can see here. We have. Admittedly, it's been a couple of weeks since I've done a show, but look at the quality of the work that we're seeing here of the artists. I mean, again, plant computer. Plant computer. Ed Marolla just submitted the family to remote control.
00:57:30.120 - 00:57:48.858, Speaker A: Just submitted this family to remote control. Super chief NFT open call. So here, the great Ed Marolla once again at work. I can't make this any bigger than it is, but just another cool work. Just looks like Jesus saves is coming in here at the back. Just beautiful work. Here's Uri J.
00:57:48.858 - 00:58:08.826, Speaker A: And I picked up one of these. It's called Octagram. I loved how it's like a play on the Microsoft Windows, kind of like the newer windows here interface. And I love it. Just using that as a compositional device. It almost looks like a Zoom call or something. But then everything changed.
00:58:08.826 - 00:58:22.372, Speaker A: You have an octopus here instead of the video sign. You know, audio. Instead of the audio sign, you have a chair. Just rad from Yuri J. Here. So very cool work. Three tezos.
00:58:22.372 - 00:58:39.970, Speaker A: And I think the sale is over. Has this sold out? 21 left at three tezos, which is only $2.30. What is that? 70 cent tazos? Good time to collect many artists here. Sandro. Sandro. This is also by Uri J. I think there was a portrait.
00:58:39.970 - 00:59:06.770, Speaker A: Look at this. Look at the detail in this. I think there was like a portrait tez portrait day or something. All these different textures, you know, really, like, I don't care where the market goes. Like, I just, like as long as these artists keep going at this point, it's almost like even if the market dies, or we start selling for ten cents. At this point, it doesn't matter. The market has done its job as far as getting us going.
00:59:06.770 - 00:59:37.028, Speaker A: And if people, I hope that the market continues, and I think it will because I think there's real value here. But even, like, the important thing is that these artists are keep minting. It's sort of like Xerox was saying, just keep arting because it's getting very exciting. I mean, just look at the quality. And we haven't even hit, like, we've hit like a quarter, you know, a fraction of the artists here that we often look at. I mean, and like, I mean, look at the quality of the works that we've seen so far. I'm halfway through this thing.
00:59:37.028 - 00:59:53.956, Speaker A: Not even, here's a machine, right? And painting my friends. So as you see here. So people are submitting kind of a crazy one with bleeding gums. Kind of perfect. And there's machines portrait. So another artist who just continues to evolve here, painting my friends. So hilarious.
00:59:53.956 - 01:00:21.344, Speaker A: What machine is up to on Instagram, I believe. Sols favorite place. So here's an artist we haven't seen before, or I haven't seen before. I can't remember who retweeted this, but just really interesting. Kind of very, you know, it's bold work, it's experimental work. And you can go like, what's this about? You know, that's like the reaction I had when I first saw NUV, 1914. Like, what on earth is this about? So here's salts on twitter.
01:00:21.344 - 01:00:40.952, Speaker A: Sorry. On object, I should say. Just really interesting, kind of wild experimental work. Original. Right? And you see a consistency here, too, right? Maybe we have looked at one. I feel like maybe one of these who might have looked at in the past, but just a really interesting artist. Make sure I'm following them.
01:00:40.952 - 01:00:54.164, Speaker A: Kind of a new discovery for me, Saul. So just more interesting work. Here's Kikilo. This is on Zora. There was no link. And Kikilo. I looked online to try and find this on Zora, and I went, here, I'll just show you.
01:00:54.164 - 01:01:08.340, Speaker A: This is an example of why you should post your link under, despite, even if it hurts your reach. It's better to get a few people with the link, in my opinion. Do. Do what you will. But then I go to the page. I can't even find it. Right? So let's say I wanted to buy that.
01:01:08.340 - 01:01:21.708, Speaker A: Where do I. There it is. I guess I'd go down here. So I do find it, right? But look, I shouldn't, you know, as a collector. I gave up here, right. So just kind of a lesson and I would post the link. But hey, it's got a lot of reach though.
01:01:21.708 - 01:01:32.868, Speaker A: So hard to say. Depends what you are trying to do. If you want views, maybe you don't post the link. If you want sales, maybe you post the link. This was a rad one by Katarina. Create portrait of another girl. Love this one.
01:01:32.868 - 01:02:00.948, Speaker A: Kind of reminds me of those 1920s, you know, modern paintings of like smoking woman or something. Very nice piece. And a really nice texture within the cigarette here. And just really nice, kind of. Again, you know, we're almost in this kind of animation without animating. Although the smoke is animated, but over here it's just kind of creating the vibrancy of life in a sense. The edges are being animated.
01:02:00.948 - 01:02:22.764, Speaker A: Right. The lines are being animated. Interestingly, it's almost like different versions are being animated here. Is this a gif? It is a Gif. Pretty cool gif that you can buy for ten tezos edition of five. And I think there's probably one left or that's listed on secondary. Sold on primary for five tezos.
01:02:22.764 - 01:02:34.826, Speaker A: Beautiful colors in this one. Just awesome. Daniel W. Denial. Some very interesting work coming from Daniel W. Here. Kind of always has a bit of a print feel to it.
01:02:34.826 - 01:02:52.166, Speaker A: And these awesome skeletons with this beautiful kind of yellow on pink design. Very cool. Skeleton's reading a book. It feels like out of a medieval manuscript. But it's beautiful. I've never seen it before. And there's even the little signature there.
01:02:52.166 - 01:03:07.490, Speaker A: Just awesome, awesome, awesome. Now. So sold out at edition of ten for five tezos. Bringing a quick, you know, 35 $40 to the artist. And look at all the work that Daniel W. Has been putting out that came out a while ago. Like we haven't even looked at this.
01:03:07.490 - 01:03:20.586, Speaker A: You know, Daniel W. Can be a little heavy because they're 5000 by 3000 here. So maybe I shouldn't do this. I shouldn't risk the show. We have others by Daniel W. Here. Psychostasia.
01:03:20.586 - 01:03:41.740, Speaker A: But all to say, there's some catching up to do with Daniel W. Here. Look at how beautiful and huge this is. So just really nice work here from Daniel W. Another just like awesome artist who continues to evolve and develop. I mean, that's the key. Bullishness is that you just keep getting better.
01:03:41.740 - 01:04:10.228, Speaker A: What more could you ask for? It's going to be interesting to see the sun may change its position here in the month that I've been gone from this apartment. Athanor Rubito. I don't remember the sunlight coming in like this. Hilariously, another one by Daniel wooden. Loved this concept. Almost like a circuit board type concept or a maze or Pac man, and then turned into, you know, meets a tarot card or something. Very interesting.
01:04:10.228 - 01:04:29.406, Speaker A: Very, very, very interesting composition. And even, again, some more almost alchemical looking stuff. This looks like the. What do they call it? The mixing bowl. There's a word for that in alchemy. This looks like alchemy here. There's almost a max ernst feel to this, who is also obsessed with alchemy.
01:04:29.406 - 01:04:44.662, Speaker A: The snake. The ouroboros snake eating its tail. The fire. Right? This is the mixing bowl, mingling, all that sort of stuff. So very interesting. Look at this Cuompa. More just brilliance here.
01:04:44.662 - 01:05:15.380, Speaker A: Look at all these brilliant artists. I mean, when was the last time, like, compare this to your last museum visit? You know, this is just the last couple of weeks out here. So again, this is just a work in progress. But you see, this is using, I'm tempted to call it modern Microsoft paint. I thought they got rid of Microsoft paint, whatever their drawing program is. So some works by Cuompa here, and here's some prints which Cuompa is selling. And here's some inspiration behind the work.
01:05:15.380 - 01:05:31.932, Speaker A: Interestingly, you know, so just using, you know, so that is inspiring, this pretty interesting work. Cuompa. Just an awesome artist here. Let's continue. Here's Naimi. Starry night. I think this is new.
01:05:31.932 - 01:05:46.140, Speaker A: This is on foundation. This is on base. I think you can mint it. I'm kind of, you know, only three of 30. And so this would probably be $30. Okay, so it's not a free mint. Let's see if there's volume.
01:05:46.140 - 01:06:14.130, Speaker A: There is. How are we doing? Hour five. All right, we gotta move, but almost like a crowd, right? Beautiful work. Like, I mean, the details in here, just awesome. So that's on foundation. I'm really excited from a collector point of view of the value that I'm seeing in this market right now. Here is sui soichi.
01:06:14.130 - 01:06:26.646, Speaker A: Should I go back to Ms paint? Yes, you should. And I follow Suizoichi. That is a glitch on x. Look at this. Almost different hands. Kind of pixel art. Yes.
01:06:26.646 - 01:06:34.118, Speaker A: You should definitely use MS paint. Rhetorical question. Totally. This is awesome. Look at all the love that. That works. Getting there, too.
01:06:34.118 - 01:06:55.606, Speaker A: Looks beautiful. Here is Nicholas Dietrich. New work in progress. Castles and underground scenes. The enigmatic Nicholas Dietrich continuing with the wild, super interesting pixel art. Almost like a modern de Chirico over here, I would argue. And just the mystery that's created this looks like it could hang in the same room.
01:06:55.606 - 01:07:13.540, Speaker A: This is element Li, and we saw that on what looked like the japanese screens there. Part of my skills for the annual exhibition of University of Applied Arts, vienna ubermorgan.com class. See you on the site tomorrow. So just more beautiful work here. Almost looks like a drop shadow. Hilariously.
01:07:13.540 - 01:07:26.846, Speaker A: Hilariously. There is a drop shadow on these pixels. Hilariously. Interesting work from element li. Interesting, interesting. Let's continue. Brain dead.
01:07:26.846 - 01:07:49.618, Speaker A: Proudly announce our collab. Right click dead with Chris WvR. So, of course, Chris War, also the electronic music artist renown played works. Karl Cox played some of the works and more. Very cool. Richie Houghton soon will be on object.com, so they're collaborating and of course, Braindead joining kind of the pixel art factory work, making it their own.
01:07:49.618 - 01:08:09.942, Speaker A: Awesomely. And just very cool. You know, that great genre pioneered, I believe, by Kareem Safa, which we've seen so many awesome artists. You know, pick go go litis, more gogolitis. Also put out, hilariously, a PFP collection. Like, I love that. And we're gonna have to take, I think we looked at it briefly, so let's continue here.
01:08:09.942 - 01:08:33.260, Speaker A: Glitch western icons. This is John hard times in the blues, a pioneer of the glitch western genre. Hard times. And there is a glitched out. It's almost like John Cates is experimenting with pixel art a little bit, or at least pixelation, shall we say three minted so far. I'm very bullish on these low mints. From a collecting point of view.
01:08:33.260 - 01:08:55.762, Speaker A: I think there's a lot of opportunity there where all of a sudden, you know, they disappear after 30 days. You know, maybe people don't remember, or they see it for a week and it just has a low mint and that's it. And you collect it for a couple of bucks or whatever it is. Very interesting. So Martin Bruce also, let's see if we can make this bigger. See how well the Internet's working. I think I told the story of how I fixed it.
01:08:55.762 - 01:09:17.844, Speaker A: I have sim Internet. I didn't realize, and the SiM card had sort of gotten loose and I had to re just put it in, and then it's working better than it's ever worked ever, which is interesting in itself. So just a cat angel. Martin Bruce, just cool experimentation. Here's cider with some cool experimentation as well. Just posting on x here. No comment.
01:09:17.844 - 01:09:33.524, Speaker A: Just rad. When you look at here, let's just open that. Oh, that is full size, I think. Let's just try one more time that is full size. So. But very interesting textures here. Look at this pixelation in here from cider.
01:09:33.524 - 01:09:53.122, Speaker A: I think we have another one. There's more. So very interesting from a texture master as well, this digital texture thing. Skammer was talking about that. How interested skamris and textures. And it does seem to show there is a painterliness to digital texture. Interestingly, like an overlap, a visual overlap.
01:09:53.122 - 01:10:06.314, Speaker A: Here's. I think we've looked at this before. Perhaps it kind of looks like an island on the sea or like a coast of some kind. Not sure. Beautiful. Again, this. This painterliness we see in the texture here, it's almost like.
01:10:06.314 - 01:10:21.230, Speaker A: These are almost like drips. This is almost like a brushstroke that went so novel. Kind of digital textures here from cider. Here's x mortal. Beautiful. Another beautiful. We started with x mortal just a couple of shows ago, I think.
01:10:21.230 - 01:10:43.470, Speaker A: And here's just another beautiful work from X Mortal. Look at the edges, the colors, the glitchy, you know, lights, the waves coming in. Remember, we started with the. It looked like the cliffs of Dover or something. Similar idea. This you can mint on Zora. Still available for five days.
01:10:43.470 - 01:11:05.160, Speaker A: I need to get serious about mint, you know, and Zora is what I'm thinking just as far as collecting memory wave. Like, I want one of these. $2. There's only 53. And look at what Kiro's doing. I mean, everybody continues to get better and, you know, like, put it this way, to continue to dazzle. Oh, it's like, look at this.
01:11:05.160 - 01:11:27.644, Speaker A: Kiro eth hydromax. Again, like, this is just dazzling work, you know, just dazzling. Just like it's modern. It looks like modern art. Like, again, these video paintings. Here's another one, black and white. Just some interesting shapes, very interesting body of work that Kiro's making here.
01:11:27.644 - 01:11:46.564, Speaker A: And here's Klaus, kind of. And so we haven't looked at Klaus for a couple of weeks here, I want to say. And you're starting to see the frame here is starting to kind of get fuzzed out. We're starting to see a bit of a different kind of composition. It's starting to evolve. And just, again, beautiful colors and textures. Close.
01:11:46.564 - 01:12:03.700, Speaker A: Has a real sense for color, as you can see. And Emilia Versace, picking that one up for 21 tazos. And that's in the AV collection. Cool title. One of one. Kenji, look at this. Well, on, on one device, the video runs perfectly without the dark part.
01:12:03.700 - 01:12:17.444, Speaker A: On the other, it gets dark out of nowhere. I don't know where it will appear. All to say whatever this is, Kenji. It looks beautiful. Look at this. Just very interesting work is being made here. The texture.
01:12:17.444 - 01:12:40.664, Speaker A: We're kind of back to the texture and just interesting. It's fun to look at. It's beautiful. Super interesting work. Here's Santiago Ruao with another variation on this abstract technique here, using the gradients within the shape. And again, keeping it new and original. Five minted so far, again on Zora, so you're welcome.
01:12:40.664 - 01:12:49.956, Speaker A: Cool title here. 2024. And so only five minted here. 187 days to go. Though you do have time on that one. Astral male. Look at this.
01:12:49.956 - 01:13:07.080, Speaker A: Shawn. Luke. Beautiful. Again, playing with this kind of frame composition, abstraction in the middle. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work. This is on tezos. And this was transferred about a week ago, maybe to previous collectors.
01:13:07.080 - 01:13:25.702, Speaker A: Edition of 20. And here is Andre Olivera Cibola, who we started with mannequin. I'm not sure. I think we've seen a variation on this. So, because we have seen a mannequin before, but I don't think we've seen this one. 3D Scan object and creative coding. And because I think we looked.
01:13:25.702 - 01:13:47.592, Speaker A: We started a show with a different kind of mannequin. Let's see if I can make that full screen here as we hit the hour 13. It's amazing how much artwork there is that these shows are so long. Right. Unfortunately, that is not loading up. Sometimes foundation takes a while. Very, very cool artwork from Andre Olivera Cibola.
01:13:47.592 - 01:14:08.710, Speaker A: Very cheap mint here, too. Continuing on, zuka Kipiani, synthetic echoes. Brute auction live for 4 hours. Okay, that's on fellowship trust. Fellowship AI. A little bit of volume there. Kind of playing with this kind of facial recognition or object recognition surveillance camera.
01:14:08.710 - 01:14:23.270, Speaker A: Cool audio. Just interesting work. Here's simulacro. I think we saw this in the intro. Maybe the Internet finally has failed here. Let's see. Nope, it's doing pretty good.
01:14:23.270 - 01:14:46.500, Speaker A: It's doing pretty good. I mean, just the fact that I'm not trying to. Not trying to restart and everything. Just really cool work here. I love the white chairs. There we go. Cool loop.
01:14:46.500 - 01:14:59.328, Speaker A: Nice audio. And this strange cloud. Strange cloud in the middle here. Love the plastic chairs. Brilliant brainstorming, v. So maybe just putting some stuff together. Tez portrait day.
01:14:59.328 - 01:15:20.870, Speaker A: Interesting edition of 44. 757. 50 tezos seven tezos 50. This was hilarious. I love you, salawaki. With a guy, kind of a dude who's very kind of sweet and happy with an Internet kind of written on the forehead there, and just kind of a funny work. I love that.
01:15:20.870 - 01:15:40.376, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting experimentation from dan control. Putting photographs on Zora. Bringing something different to the blockchain by dinghy. Yellow rocks, crystal clear water. So putting photographs. I've been trying to convince a friend of mine, and he actually wants me to show him how to put works on tazos. I'll tell him to put it on Zora, too.
01:15:40.376 - 01:15:57.146, Speaker A: I'm starting to see some momentum on photograph. On photography right now. I'm starting to just see it here and there. I think Robert foundation, who I think just left foundation. He did a good job, though. You know, he was like. He was a very.
01:15:57.146 - 01:16:16.242, Speaker A: He was a hustler. And you kind of need a hustler in this business. You got to be a bit of a hustler in this business. I could hustle more, say, for example, my own work. I don't really, you know, I'm hustling for this show in terms of just putting in the effort, but in terms of the sales. Right, like, hustling. Like selling your work.
01:16:16.242 - 01:16:28.418, Speaker A: That's a very important quality. And Rob was a good hustler in that respect. Anyways, let's continue. I'm sure he'll reappear. Beautiful work. Beautiful photo. So puts on Zora, 37, minted.
01:16:28.418 - 01:16:53.482, Speaker A: Well, I'll tell my friend this. I mean, yeah, I have a friend who just picked up $70, I'm assuming maybe more on Zora with his photograph. You might want to consider it joa glimpses of non concentric realities. So Yoha in continues to experiment here as we move into AI and, of course, digital painting and collage. YoIin does a lot of combination. Beautiful work. Nice color, as usual with Yoiin.
01:16:53.482 - 01:17:18.740, Speaker A: Almost like paint drips. Just beautiful. Look at these textures. It's probably AI, I'm guessing, a work by Santiago, trying to make sense of this more super interesting AI experimentation from Santiago. Here's another one, I believe, by Santiago. It is just awesome. Very interesting AI artwork.
01:17:18.740 - 01:17:37.942, Speaker A: Here's Marina Amidova. This is part of a series for the culture. We'll bring that up quickly here, but very cool. I believe this is an AI painting by Maria Amidova. Nice move. Very interesting. Look at the texture there.
01:17:37.942 - 01:17:53.558, Speaker A: Again, we're back to texture. These beautiful emulation, these simulated paintings. Right? Just super duper interesting. Sunlit, fleeting. There's so much interesting art. So that is from this show here. Trilobite with a work there.
01:17:53.558 - 01:18:14.204, Speaker A: Very cool. And so we can't go through everything. We're at hour 17, but just a quick tour here of. There's Ana dart, awesomely rosa Jade, and so all sorts of people actually brought up yo ao Salazar grimoire. Right? Very cool. So a ton of awesome work here. Huge show.
01:18:14.204 - 01:18:27.800, Speaker A: Look at this. There's Stalamere. Wow. So, yeah, we may have to go into some of these again. Max capacity human boy. So just a huge show here. I mean, this is massive.
01:18:27.800 - 01:18:37.574, Speaker A: So very cool. Now he, there's Nami. So that is also. Nami is the starry night that we looked at. Demon ego. I'm not sure. The show is so large.
01:18:37.574 - 01:18:54.366, Speaker A: I'm not sure actually what the deal is. This is a massive show for the culture. Cool. Kanek Zapata. That's on foundation. Kanik Zapata, glitch artist, doing a lot of AI, just rad experimentation here from Kanik Zapata. Very interesting.
01:18:54.366 - 01:19:15.600, Speaker A: Here's Skomra, who's on the spaces. And just more beautiful textures, as you can see here. Kinda easy. And I believe stable diffusion, an early version of stable diffusion, I think 1.1. And the textual inverters, if I'm saying that right. And some physical work as we wrap up, Ilia Beribin. And then get back to my appointment that I am super late for.
01:19:15.600 - 01:19:33.106, Speaker A: Okay. Yeah. And ilia beribin with some physicals here. Really interesting piece. Skateboarding on grass, but almost like a ballerina here on top. Very, very interesting work here from just conceptual composition. Just a very interesting piece.
01:19:33.106 - 01:19:48.906, Speaker A: Almost like a surrealist piece. Here is Filippo Francocci, work in progress. These two paintings are turning into a diptych. Looks beautiful, doesn't it? So more interesting artwork. All sorts of different, kind of. Almost has a dali like feel there. Very interesting work.
01:19:48.906 - 01:20:13.810, Speaker A: Beautiful, kind of suggestive, abstract. Here's yo Osalazar, memory and data. And this is also for the culture, physical NFT. And here it is. So brand new one from yoa o Salazar, combining, you know, Windows XP or Windows 95 type iconography with general Internet iconography. Some painting textures. Very cool.
01:20:13.810 - 01:20:29.890, Speaker A: Available on foundation. And here is walk. I love five of ten still available. I think this is the work. I'm not sure this words by walk. Again, look at how beautiful this is. I don't know if you can see that, but just the little drips.
01:20:29.890 - 01:20:45.670, Speaker A: This is gorgeous. Bidnow foundation app. What a brilliant ad. And I actually love how these smaller works make a large work. And that's on foundation. And five of ten still available. So that's on foundation there.
01:20:45.670 - 01:21:04.266, Speaker A: So we've been looking at some of these. Here's another one. Win. And again, you just see the masterclass in spray paint art from wok every little speck of paint and even the drips. Masterful. Absolutely masterful. Win reserve 0.01
01:21:04.266 - 01:21:13.460, Speaker A: and that, my friends, is your show. Thank you again for joining me. Thank you for all the support, and we'll see you on Monday. Until next time, have a great weekend and take care there.
