00:00:07.240 - 00:00:45.576, Speaker A: Broadcasting internationally, a digital repertoire of the world's latest, greatest images. Your digital art DJ is back, and I welcome you back, dear listener, dear viewer. Artist Journal, January 9, 2023 Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and I'll show you what turned my head. And first of all, just a big shout out to everybody for all the retweets and everything. Friday was kind of next level. Like, I mean, it was a really, like, my phone kind of blew up a little bit.
00:00:45.576 - 00:01:18.544, Speaker A: So I totally appreciate that, guys. I mean, it's been like I was telling you in earlier episodes, we've kind of built this from 30, just the base of 30 subscribers since August. And kind of one by one, it's been kind of really fun to watch. And it just does basically keep growing every time you basically put out an episode. So, anyways, and the only marketing has been putting out a tweet on Twitter and saying, okay, this exists. And that's been it. So that's super cool.
00:01:18.544 - 00:01:45.382, Speaker A: And anyways, it's really great. And the conversation is maybe my favorite part of this. Of course, we're getting responses throughout this episode. You're going to see responses from the artists, which is super exciting and awesome. So the enthusiasm is contagious, my friends. Now, looking at this work here, this is Venta, and this definitely turned my head. So on the left, on the left, what we see here, and I think I brought this up bigger.
00:01:45.382 - 00:02:23.516, Speaker A: So this is the left side, we see Aventa digital painting, you know, sampled brushes. It seems like going on here also in the wood of the fire. I really like this fire, by the way, with the big, chunky finger painting and then the thin. Just a really nice fire, actually. And, okay, so we see kind of a. I don't want to say typical, but a digital art painting, okay, a digital painting, okay. It is put into AI, as far as I understand, and processed.
00:02:23.516 - 00:03:00.936, Speaker A: So again, so you see how the composition is mirrored here, but on the right is the AI treated version. So the implications of this are pretty kind of staggering in the sense that, like, you know, so I assume this was uploaded on the left and then a prompt was probably added. I think this is not mid journey. I think this is probably something like stable diffusion. I am still learning all this stuff. I'm still on mid journey, and so uploading stuff. I don't think it's as close on mid journey.
00:03:00.936 - 00:03:52.936, Speaker A: I don't think they stay as close, and they had some reasons. I was looking in the user guide because I think they don't want to put people's faces on other things and whatever. So I think this is probably stable diffusion, but correct me if I'm wrong out there, I am very new to AI still. And you see the tree. So you can have a kid's drawing, you put in a prompt, and the kid can put in a prompt at grade two and come out with pretty interesting art. Like, you know, sometimes they kind of raise the profile of, like, seven year old painters, and you go, oh, there are some nice paintings, but you sort of go, okay, but whatever. In the future, with AI, even today, potentially, you could have a kids drawing on the left, and then with them, with a few prompts, you could have a twelve year old that could put together some pretty amazing work.
00:03:52.936 - 00:04:18.830, Speaker A: And they have the time. They have the time. So anyways, this turned my head. Look at the clouds, right? So, and how many different versions of this could you make, you know? And then I would always be like, okay, I'll put these all as layers in Photoshop and take my favorite parts of each. So very, very interesting. Only one retweet on that. But that, to me, was a big head turner.
00:04:18.830 - 00:04:56.034, Speaker A: Just a very big head turner. And I brought this up as well. It kind of reminds me of Venta's work. You know, let me just show you in the AI, these kind of, like, you know, arms and the kind of corporeal, like the corpuscular or however you want to put that, the volumetric, you know, arms, sculptural. You see, like, there's almost drop shadows here on the sky, as if, like, this is like, play doh that's put onto a board here. It kind of reminds me just these arms and legs that kind of don't amount to an actual body. Reminds me of this dally piece, soft construction with boiled beans.
00:04:56.034 - 00:05:19.650, Speaker A: And so we like the art history here. So. And it's kind of been lurking in the back of my head as I've been looking at Venta's work. So finally, I thought I'd bring this up, so don't alert too long. But then I saw this. Then I saw this guy, and I was like, hey, that's the guy from the pharmacist of Amerdam seeking absolutely nothing. See this? That guy.
00:05:19.650 - 00:05:45.230, Speaker A: This is one of my favorite paintings, by the way, the chemist. Another kind of title is like, the chemist from Amerdam, who's looking for absolutely nothing at all. I've shown this work, like, maybe 50 episodes ago. And anyway, that guy, you can see a crow is landed on my balcony. That guy is here. So there you go. And so anyways, yeah, that's what that venta work has been reminding me of.
00:05:45.230 - 00:06:00.698, Speaker A: So I finally put it in there. A big shout out to hasdrubal waffle, whose work I am just becoming a mega fan of. And he did this. I mean, who would have expected this post? Alley oop. Thank you for the support and kindness. Basketball, pokebelly. Alley oop.
00:06:00.698 - 00:06:18.666, Speaker A: So this is me. And so thank you, hasdrubal waffle. I'm. Look at the textures in all this. Look at the, you know, the dots and everything. And I used when I first looked at hasdrubal waffles work, I thought that was kind of, like, lo fi. Like, I didn't get it, as you know, but.
00:06:18.666 - 00:06:32.824, Speaker A: And here just, you know, now I just go, this is so rich, this work. And so I'm just a huge fan. I can't believe it. Okay. Like, I mean, I didn't expect it. And look at the pathos here, too. And there's hasdrubal.
00:06:32.824 - 00:06:52.052, Speaker A: So. And, you know, the basketball, it's a beautiful composition. It's just even the lines on the wood of the court, you know? So just an awesome, awesome work. So thank you for that. You know, just amazing. A one of one. And a beautiful work by edgeq.
00:06:52.052 - 00:07:36.424, Speaker A: So back to this idea. I mean, you know, back to this idea, though, of, I guess this is, like, an uploaded image with maybe it's sampled from video. Like, I don't know. Maybe it's a screenshot. I don't know how they do this, but, like, the way that the eyes are looking directly at the viewer, I mean, I'm kind of stunned. I don't think I have a photo that's this good of me in terms of kind of capturing me in this kind of, you know, if I was a senator or something, I don't think I have a photo that would do justice to, like, if I became, like, a major government official. But I think Edgeq here is approaching that.
00:07:36.424 - 00:08:00.994, Speaker A: You know what I mean? Like, it looks like a beautiful 18th century portrait with my. And then he puts my face on it. You know, I'm stunned because I see, like, portraiture here. I see, like, an avenue for portraiture. So thank you to edgeq. Adriano Pocabelle di Firenze, musician, painter, and patron of the arts. So very cool.
00:08:00.994 - 00:08:16.572, Speaker A: Another one of one. So thank you to edgeq. And finally, one more poly jojo. So again, the reaction is, like, awesome, guys. I appreciate it. And it's super cool. And that's, like, great work.
00:08:16.572 - 00:08:47.239, Speaker A: Like, I mean, again, I look at this and I go, I don't know if I have a picture that's that good of me, that kind of captures a meditative, you know, like, you know, almost like a religious, you know, like, monk like figure here. And it almost looks like a St. Anthony or something. So anyways, yeah, AI and Photoshop. So I don't know how you guys are doing it, but I see, like, a portraiture business I love. Even, like, the bags under the eyes. I mean, that's me.
00:08:47.239 - 00:09:10.524, Speaker A: It's a genetic situation. My aunt in Rome always wears sunglasses. It's hilarious, even inside. So anyways, this is something else first. Like, I mean, the tribute is awesome. The technical business, though, is, again, head turning for me. Like, I don't know how this is possible, but I think there's a business here.
00:09:10.524 - 00:09:27.592, Speaker A: Interestingly, maybe it's easy. Like, I don't know. So anyways, thank you to Aksin, who picked up ravers on secondary for 75 tezos. A nice price there. So thank you for that. Just a pixel art sketchbook work. And here's some more sketching.
00:09:27.592 - 00:09:51.330, Speaker A: Having a ton of fun here. And the 808 sketching over here. Thank you to all the collectors here who collected makes my day. So thank you. And finally, trueface here. So we were talking, okay, and this leads into a major correction I need to make. But the correction, I got some stuff right here, which is good.
00:09:51.330 - 00:10:21.146, Speaker A: True face. Love this guy and his very accurate observations about my new artistic name, about titles of my artwork. So remember I was saying it's probably made by AI, like, true face's name, the title of the work, anthropology of love, which was, I believe it was called, about the diffuse texture of my outputs. You are more than approved by an aiog like me, and I'm glad to know your ideas and Personas. So very nice. Again, the reaction was off the charts in the last couple of days. So you guys make me feel really great and special.
00:10:21.146 - 00:10:48.450, Speaker A: So thank you for that. As an artist, as we all know, it's not easy. As I've said in the past, you know, it's 98% rejection being an artist. So this means a lot, especially from artists, you know, like, that kind of, for me, is the real exciting thing. Now, I did make a huge mistake, though, in the Michelangelo work. So remember, Mega. Remember, I was saying that this is Michelangelo.
00:10:48.450 - 00:11:20.078, Speaker A: This is not a self portrait of Michelangelo. This is the damned man. As soon as I finished last episode, I was like, wait a second, I think I got. This is the self portrait, and I'll show you Michelangelo in a second. So this is Saint Bartholomew, and he was flayed, basically skinned alive, and that is how he was martyred, according to the story. And then the flayed skin that he's holding and holding the knife here. And again, this is Michelangelo's last judgment in the Vatican, in the Sistine chapel.
00:11:20.078 - 00:11:35.818, Speaker A: And so this here is the portrait of Michelangelo. And I'll show you the portrait. So here's Michelangelo. I don't. I assume he did this. I'm not sure who did this portrait here, but. So you can kind of see mostly in the hair.
00:11:35.818 - 00:11:54.918, Speaker A: So I think this is a theory. Okay, so I just want to correct that. So this here is, people think is maybe there. So you can judge for yourself. There are the two images for you. And this guy is the damned man, and is known as the damned man. The damned man.
00:11:54.918 - 00:12:14.446, Speaker A: And he's, you can see being kind of whisked off by these two demons here. Terrified. So, anyways, just want to make that quick correction here. And yes, the damned man. And so anyways, so I'm glad I got the AI stuff right, though. True face. Thanks for the comments.
00:12:14.446 - 00:12:54.860, Speaker A: That was totally awesome. So, regarding the open editions and the royalties, remember I was talking about OpenSea? Charles AI wasn't getting the royalties. Austin Lawrence does the option in Manifold for Opensea need to be activated if you deployed the contract before January 2, 2023 cutoff. So I thought this was an excellent question, and I don't know the answer to it. What Austin is asking. Remember I was showing in the last episode, when you're in manifold XYZ's contract, that you have to turn on the Opensea royalty thing in order to ensure you get the royalties. And he's asking.
00:12:54.860 - 00:13:28.994, Speaker A: Austin is asking. Very interestingly, it didn't occur to me, does that need to be turned on before January 2 to basically be activated in the contract? I don't know the answer to that question. I assume my assumption is in manifold. If I can turn it on that, from there on in, I assume I can leave it on. Like, if they're going to give me the option of turning it on at this point, even though it's already after January 2, then I assume it'll work. That would be my answer. But I thought that was a really good question.
00:13:28.994 - 00:14:07.068, Speaker A: Does it need to be activated before January 2 to even work? I assume if we turn it on now, if it's still available as an option, it must still be available. There's a bit of debate on open editions right now, and that kind of came up in our Twitter spaces actually, last week, and Joe Rogan's dad was talking about it and he's actually going to be in the Twitter space that's coming up here. This is art pleb. I think open editions are cool consumption items. Open editions from top artists will be a signal of, quote, I was there when, like, having a demo tape of pearl jam before they made it. Yes, I know I'm old. Having one is cool.
00:14:07.068 - 00:14:33.450, Speaker A: Having a dozen is less cool because you clearly don't care and just want to flip. So anyways, I think there's been, to me, the takeaway is the open edition thing. I mean, I felt like I was jumping on the bandwagon when I put it out, but I thought, if not now, you're never going to do it. So I put one out, but it did feel like a bandwagon thing. But I think it's great. Again, like, it's. If you don't overthink it, I think it's awesome.
00:14:33.450 - 00:15:15.712, Speaker A: So anyways, I think what this tells me is maybe the open edition trend is starting to crest a little bit. And Charles AI also brought up some interesting comments. Just saying, if you're to do this, like, every week or every month, you know, is it too much? You know? And he seemed to be suggesting it was final kind of little news item here. Excited to have been listed in worlds, a foundation's new tool for curation. So this is Georgina Hooper, who's on super rare. It's an honor to be selected by somewhere art for their leading curation art times machine. So I guess the point of this that I wanted to share with you is foundation has a curation tool.
00:15:15.712 - 00:15:48.818, Speaker A: So this is interesting because object has kind of not. I mean, I think it was either Bizaya or purple drank was saying, like, where's our curation tool? And I was mentioning that as well on a previous show. Like, it would be nice to be able to curate on object. And right now, I don't know if it's a possibility and it should be. So anyways, it looks like on foundation you can curate. So just kind of a heads up there and a quick update on Euxine's market here. We were looking last episode.
00:15:48.818 - 00:16:16.680, Speaker A: Is this the big throwdown? And so it's been a busy weekend. Like, here's your update. Let's just do a quick refresh. Yeah. Like this just sold in the last 18 minutes for 600, which is actually pretty cheap, as you're going to see here for edition of eleven here. Jailbreaker sold for 600. These editions of, like, 321 selling for 60, 23 old ones selling for 149, you know, edition of 111 selling for 100.
00:16:16.680 - 00:16:41.892, Speaker A: But let me get to the bigger sales here. I mean, there are so many sales. Look, 888. This is just 14 hours ago. And we've gone through this many sales. There has been 450 for 1000. And there was another one for 1000 for 690 for addition of ten.
00:16:41.892 - 00:16:56.140, Speaker A: So here's another one for 1000. And there was actually like, yeah, look at this. This is all in the last. Like, this is still not even 24 hours ago. Here's another one for 1000. Addition of ten. So anyways.
00:16:56.140 - 00:17:24.233, Speaker A: Or addition of 20. So, I mean, that market. So again, just kind of interesting. Is this the big throwdown? The question remains, you know, it hasn't been disproven yet. So interesting. Okay, so we're about to look at hasdrubal waffle, and I just want. I dug up this comment from Santiago about a month ago on the channel here, and I was talking about hasdrubal waffle.
00:17:24.233 - 00:18:04.100, Speaker A: And he said, hasdrubal waffle is my favorite artist in the whole NFT scene, including any chain or any kind of art. And when I first saw that, I thought, as I said on the show, I was like, huh? I never would have expected that. I'm starting to understand, though, like, when I see the textures and everything that's going on in there, the fun, the experimentation. Now I understand where you're coming from, Santiago. Like, yeah, it's an acquired taste, and it takes time, as you said in that tweet as well, in that you recently released. So anyways, now I'm starting to understand. And here's a recent piece, doppelganger by hasdrubal waffle.
00:18:04.100 - 00:18:26.764, Speaker A: Mario paint, homage to object 546365. So we're going to look at that. Actually, maybe I'll bring it up right now. So here's the original that it's based on. This is by an artist called Bebe, and this is a physical work, acrylic China marker. So interesting to use this as a subject. And so he did this in Mario paint.
00:18:26.764 - 00:18:58.506, Speaker A: And so anyways, just, you know, beautiful work as ever. Here. Again, you look at the textures. I think it's the textures that really do me in, but it's also just like, you know, there's just something kind of really free and nice about it and these nice little frames. You know, you can go on and on. You can decide for yourself how you feel about it. But I thought a very, very nice homage here to BB in this work here by hastrubal waffle.
00:18:58.506 - 00:19:28.116, Speaker A: And here's some more work by Bebe, who we've never seen, I've never seen before, before this weekend, before the chef came out. So anyways, interesting artist, and this is also by BB, which is a gif. And this is called torture Chamber. So just kind of, you know, I don't know who these artists are, but that's why it's fun. When you find kind of a unique artist like hasdrubal waffle, then you go through, okay, that's the guy he's referencing. Let's look at his collection. Interesting work here and interesting title.
00:19:28.116 - 00:20:09.970, Speaker A: Torture chamber instrumental for a silent gif. Okay, so interesting people sold for $0.20 for a one of one in March. Okay, so we are finding new undiscovered countries here on object hasdrubal waffle. Another one, peekaboo. And edition of five. And so I don't know if this is using Microsoft paint or, sorry, super Mario paint or something else, but again, you just see the wild experimentation here, you know, like the fuzzy, you know, hand, you know, fingernails on the hand and on and on, you know, the texture, the crazy texture.
00:20:09.970 - 00:20:34.484, Speaker A: You know, brushes which might be thought of as ugly, but then embraced and celebrated and not worrying too much about it looking too real. The freedom, it reminds me of kind of like Warhol, where it just looked kind of effortless, you know, and the. That's what these works are. They just look effortless. Peek a boo. It's like, oh, he's just a stick figure. Anybody could do that, you know? But he just.
00:20:34.484 - 00:20:56.310, Speaker A: There's something about it. Another comment by Santiago. Those are important artists making nfts today according to a 2600 mindset. To a year 2600 mindset. There are important artists making nfts today according to a year 2600 mindset. I agree. That's why, partly why I do this show.
00:20:56.310 - 00:21:40.498, Speaker A: Again, like this is evergreen content in my universe. This is kind of, there's so much to track here that it's exciting to just discuss. If I didn't think that, I wouldn't do this, because why would you do that? So I agree entirely, Sabato. So remember this horse here? And we're mentioning Etienne Jules Marais, the guy who did the chrono photography here. Actually, Sabeto says it very nice. Thanks for the shout out. The drawing on today's artist journal, he brought up Etienne Jules Marais chrono photography of a horse in motion, this one from 1886.
00:21:40.498 - 00:22:08.730, Speaker A: And this was definitely on my mind when drawing. So there it is. So exactly like that was the first thing I thought when I saw this was. So that's cool, right? So battle is referencing art history and read his write up. It's fascinating, actually. And he's got a lot to say here. And he also brings up another guy whose name I was trying to remember, Edward Muybridge, who did the horses in motion.
00:22:08.730 - 00:22:38.160, Speaker A: I think this is actually who I was thinking about originally. And then I brought up Etienne Jules Marais. They're kind of see often spoken of in similar, in the same conversation, these two photographers. And so anyways, Edward Muybridge and Etienne Jules Marais were the inspirations here. And here's like a really nice kind of progress shot of just the outline of the horse. So very cool. So thanks for describing that, Sabato.
00:22:38.160 - 00:23:03.302, Speaker A: That's super interesting. Look at this work by spagels Maskinen as we go into more work here. I think this was retweeted by Sabato, last exit and kind of a wild billboard. This sold really nicely for an ETH on Ethereum here on foundation. So last exit. And let's just see how this went. There was a buy now price, which was interesting.
00:23:03.302 - 00:23:41.484, Speaker A: And so that went, it was set at 712, listed at point, listed two minutes later, and then bought at 726 minutes later. It was bought for an ETH. So pretty interesting. So anyways, just a nice sale there. A new commercial from one of our favorites, Kurt Hussle collective, available for 97 ETH. Let's just see if we can get this going here. Just reload and get some volume.
00:23:41.484 - 00:24:18.310, Speaker A: And here is a Gif by Kurt hussle collective. Also came out at the same time. 1900 1997 900 and we'll get back to the video as soon as it loads here. Let us see. Here we go. So all the humor. 900 1997 900 and give your passion.
00:24:18.310 - 00:24:40.008, Speaker A: Yeah, so I just love their commercials and the phone. Just. Ninety seven cents the first minute. So anyways, totally awesome. I think it's about 30 seconds there. So you got a nice chunk of it. Buy for basically an ETH.
00:24:40.008 - 00:25:04.894, Speaker A: Buy for 97 ETH on foundation. And of course, as I was showing you here, there's a gift that also came out. 1900 1997 900 KHC calling card. Got your calling card. So anyways, always fun for those big time callers that live on the line. Newark by Popple is part of his kind of monster series. And he actually had some interesting things to say about that as well.
00:25:04.894 - 00:25:26.924, Speaker A: Heart of sewer. And he has some writing here. The heart of sewer beats beneath the ground. A steady pulsing sound. A sound of rotten decay. A sound that will forever stay. Popple is also a writer, as we know, and has a bit of an alien feel, like the original aliens film.
00:25:26.924 - 00:25:52.194, Speaker A: Feel like it's pretty cool. Kind of dark, kind of gothic pixel art, almost, for lack of better term, kind of dark Sci-Fi interesting greens there too. And there's the heart. And so edition of 25 sold out. Yeah, you see, even he's calling it gothic too. Buy for 120 on secondary part of the sanitarium series. And he also actually had some interesting things to say.
00:25:52.194 - 00:26:09.094, Speaker A: It's a new series. Was in a cabin in the woods for a week during the Christmas holiday. Stranded with a ten year old that heats and a computer that heats. Like an electric stove. Like an electric stove. And I started to doodle a series of weird beans. Gonna bring them on screen one by one.
00:26:09.094 - 00:26:20.370, Speaker A: So there was the other one that we were looking at last episode. So very interesting. And thank you for sharing that. Popple. Looking great. So original. Right.
00:26:20.370 - 00:26:40.530, Speaker A: Kappen with a new work edition of 20. This was just released yesterday, I believe. Kind of an interesting. Another just kind of interesting. I don't know if this is part of the Astral Hazers series, just more like. Again, it's this idea of pixel art as high art. This is called shine until the two become one.
00:26:40.530 - 00:26:56.150, Speaker A: Astral hazers by Kappan. Buy for twelve. Let's just see what it went for originally. 333. So popple got the last one. So a nice small community here, as you can see. For those that you know.
00:26:56.150 - 00:27:20.956, Speaker A: So the guy who we're just looking at, he picked up this work, right? For those that are maybe new to object and tazos, you can see how tightly knit of a community it is. So if you're looking to join, it's joining. It's open to everybody and even foundation. You don't need an invite anymore. And that's on Ethereum. So anyways, the green pastures are still here. Ed Marolla with an interesting work platform.
00:27:20.956 - 00:27:43.044, Speaker A: Number two in his signature colors. And again, we're looking at more kind of experimental pixel art, right? So kind of like. Well, I don't know if I'd call. They are kind of like vaporwave colors, aren't they? But this doesn't look like a vapor. I mean, that's his palette. Ed Marilla. So anyways, it looks like a tree on a platform.
00:27:43.044 - 00:28:34.770, Speaker A: Very mysterious work here. And then the rail goes down, kind of goes off the out of space, and then kind of becomes part of this abstraction on top, right? So, as I keep saying, find abstract, find pixel art that does these kind of crazy experimentations anywhere else. And soon you'll be thinking, oh, pixel art. As high art is to be found mostly on object, but other places, too. Bite by bit with some beautiful nebulas here. I miss this one, but I love the kind of spreading here of the stars and even just the, just the, almost looking like a canvas of the background shining through here, white and gray. But I guess that's just the color.
00:28:34.770 - 00:28:47.534, Speaker A: Bite by bit. Cigar. Galaxy. I think that one's pretty famous. Andromeda. This was a quite nice one, too, and with a nice star. So anyways, just some updates from Byte by bit.
00:28:47.534 - 00:29:17.494, Speaker A: And one more. I picked this one up, cartwheel galaxy. So I liked how there's a lot of stuff going on in this one. So just interesting pixel art here. And Ilay with some more experimentations with Yasci. And she's making progress on a daily basis here, as you can see. So this is ASCII vaniteas tulips original AI image and art generator times kanexep Zapata.
00:29:17.494 - 00:29:59.584, Speaker A: So if I understand that right, there's an AI image. So this is kind of like what we saw at the beginning in reverse, because we had a drawing that was turned into AI by Vanya. Now it looks like we have an AI image that's being put into an ASCII processor mixed with Kanek Zapata somehow. So I'm not exactly sure exactly what's going on here, but it's looking good, isn't it? I'm quite enjoying these ASCII works here, actually. And there was another one in there. Look at this. And so this is using a different font, a different script.
00:29:59.584 - 00:30:23.904, Speaker A: So very interesting, isn't it? And here's vanites. Tulips two. So I assume using the same process, here's kind of a more simple, kind of in the style of dan control a little bit. And then here, kind of its own thing. Tulips two. So anyways, super interesting. I was quite, especially this guy here.
00:30:23.904 - 00:30:36.720, Speaker A: So anyways, all of them, very interesting. This was found by Ilay. She just posted this this morning. Second street newfound. I thought it was just kind of interesting. 128 animated frames. I'd never seen the artist before.
00:30:36.720 - 00:31:01.170, Speaker A: Nft noob. And let's just make that big. Almost looks like Super Mario type clouds and some kind of game that you've never seen before. Pixel art aseprite animated. And here's the artist who I've never seen before. Give them a follow kind of reminds me of Ed Morolla here in the figures. So just experimenting with pixel art, continuing on.
00:31:01.170 - 00:31:23.316, Speaker A: Here's an artist that I followed for a long time that just had kind of interesting abstract kind of shapes and stuff. And hagluc. And they put out a couple of new pieces, pretty undiscovered, I think, editions of 1514 available. So, yeah, so they've sold one. So anyways, interesting work. And I think I have another one for one. Tazos.
00:31:23.316 - 00:31:45.944, Speaker A: Yeah. So there's tons left here, I thought. Pretty interesting. Unsplace floating in the distance. So just playing with these kind of architectural cube spaces. It's a bit of a motif that we see in a few artists here. These kind of like aerial, kind of 45 degree angle view on what looks like architectural, whether it's a city block or something like that.
00:31:45.944 - 00:32:05.390, Speaker A: Pretty interesting glitch work here. This is by eSIM. And I think I've seen eSIM on Twitter. So anyways, I thought this was a pretty interesting kind of animated abstract work at auction for 88. It's a one of one. So it's doing well, I think. Yeah, it's getting like.
00:32:05.390 - 00:32:24.262, Speaker A: It's pretty attractive. Smaunter, who has these kind of odd Sci-Fi drawings. And here's another one. And what was the title of this again? Boy on his break. A boy enjoying his break from work in a space city. Life in space can be hectic at times. So I just thought a very original work here.
00:32:24.262 - 00:32:51.440, Speaker A: The boy is in green, and there you see kind of like a Magnus robot fighter Sci-Fi world with, you know, spaceships instead of cars. And anyway, I just thought, like, a lot of decisions here with the red and the orange and the warm in the background with the green boy. And even the interesting clothing. Interesting piece. Buy for a Tezos 50 edition of ten. Nine left. Okay, so it's more undiscovered work.
00:32:51.440 - 00:33:07.548, Speaker A: And actually, I picked this up for two from nature. From Gino. Gino. Gino, probably. And I thought this was a very fun take on a farmer's field. And so anyways, nice work from Gino. Available for two.
00:33:07.548 - 00:33:16.460, Speaker A: I think it sold out. Yeah. So maybe he kept one. Yeah. So edition of three. You gotta love it. Edition of three for two.
00:33:16.460 - 00:33:47.366, Speaker A: Tazos. I thought this was just kind of an interesting work that I also saw kind of more in an abstract illustrated sort of genre, shall we say. Insel by Lolly. Gag design or insole is the name of the artist 102 collected by Andrea Litmus on form, function. Thank you for collecting so this was on form function, which is solana, a one of one platform on Solana. Interesting abstraction there. Back to Santiago.
00:33:47.366 - 00:34:18.394, Speaker A: So kind of showing a progress shot. And he uses gimp, which I find really interesting because I tried to use gimp. It's basically a free photoshop, from what I understand. And when I got a new computer a few years ago, and I found it very hard to use because I'm probably just used to Photoshop, but Santiago uses it quite a bit, I think. And so anyways, some pretty interesting experimentation here. You kind of get a feel, you know, you see like, these pixels that are. Look like they're being transformed here.
00:34:18.394 - 00:34:47.437, Speaker A: So anyways, just interesting, kind of see a work in progress, and you see almost here, like these little pattern things maybe are being used. So anyways, pretty interesting. Kind of could show in the same room an artist I'd never seen before. Nzfs kind of reminds me of some of the abstract works that we've seen, the digital abstract works, but kind of pixelated. So just kind of interesting. And I think I brought up their page here. I did.
00:34:47.437 - 00:35:14.534, Speaker A: Yeah. So it's not the first one they've made here. They have quite a few in this spirit. So, anyways, media artist from Buonos Aires, and we are cruising through this episode. A couple more from human kernel, which again, was a hasdrubal waffle discovery for me, going through his collection in this anti profile picture project collection, and speaking through vibrations. Yo, said I. And I replied a similar thought.
00:35:14.534 - 00:35:52.118, Speaker A: Human kernel. So anyways, so here's another PFP. Anti PFP. Interesting. You know, even just the experimentation here, again, kind of along the lines of polka Sigmar polka in my universe, where you basically put mark making underneath, and then on top, you put a completely different mark making that basically ignores the lines underneath. And then you get this kind of poetry here. So here, maybe there's trees in the outline, but you just put the color, you know, so, again, feels like a bit of a polka, even though you know, the mouth.
00:35:52.118 - 00:36:11.822, Speaker A: And it's kind of. I call it instant poetry. When you do that kind of random mark making underneath, and then you put stuff on top that's random. You put them on. That's why you can take layers from one file. I'll do this once in a while, and then put them on a completely different file, and you start to see poetry oftentimes. So, speaking through vibrations.
00:36:11.822 - 00:36:50.284, Speaker A: And we have another one again, in kind of a different, completely different style. So you see the experimentation here. Water and voices wake. Everyone almost looks religious with this almost looks like a Mary Magdalene, but a dude. And here we have kind of a, you know, oil painterly kind of look, but looks like digital oil paint again, contrasted with this super digital outlines here and a gradient and some pixelation. So I'm really enjoying this kind of corner of tezos that I'm discovering through kind of hasdrubal waffle over here. So, yeah, some very rich stuff.
00:36:50.284 - 00:37:30.344, Speaker A: A nice addition to the failed artist series number 13, self portrait, the Garden of forking paths. This is by Treza Rodanx. And here he has the path that faces all of us artists, which is go the route that society wants us to go and be successful, or go the route pursuing your obsessions, and you end up with fries on your head and a bottle of whiskey, let's say, and a hot dog and a cigarette and a cast. So I really liked this series. Buy for three. Tayso is still available. I just picked one up.
00:37:30.344 - 00:37:56.444, Speaker A: Board me social club with some new ones. Waiting room. This is from the blue notebook. And just another interesting painting, an old school rotary phone. You see what looks like a Jason mask, like a Halloween mask here. Again, these kind of disorienting floors, right? Because the perspective is backwards. And we're seeing, this isn't an accident.
00:37:56.444 - 00:38:29.976, Speaker A: We've seen this many times with board me social club, and it really creates an effect. I think it's really interesting, and frankly, I've never seen that in painting where people are purposefully doing the opposite perspective. Very disorienting. So super interesting. This is also a very interesting texture here of this wall. Kind of got a surrealist feel to it. And again, this strange figure here with the dead hands and the modern shoes and everything, and the weird kind of hood, the shadow of the chair, the bananas.
00:38:29.976 - 00:38:52.592, Speaker A: It has definitely a surrealist feeling to it. Even the shadows, the psychological shadows. And what's this other shadow here? So continues to be very interesting. Waiting room buy for five, still available edition of 20. Here's another artist who just starred on super rare. My first artwork for super rare mus. And this is Grigala.
00:38:52.592 - 00:39:14.528, Speaker A: And I've never seen Grigala before. And it looked pretty interesting to me. And so here it is on super rare. And you see, basically it's pretty painterly here, I assume digital. It looks like it's a digital original, definitely. And this was, this went for 0.3. So a nice beginning here.
00:39:14.528 - 00:39:42.114, Speaker A: And as you can see, there's a bit of a bidding war. Like, I wonder. I mean, yeah, they put it for 0.1 and then basically, there was a bidding war all the way to 0.32. So isn't that interesting? Like, I think a lot of people out there are feeling like they're getting art cheap right now. Like, you definitely feel this on Tezos, right? And Tezos has gone up to, like, $0.84. So it's not quite the deal it was when it was $0.70.
00:39:42.114 - 00:40:17.334, Speaker A: So I think, you know, like, if you're getting one of ones on super rare for $400, that's not a bad deal, especially for a genesis work. You know, if you have a lot of money and you're big in crypto, you know, you go, oh, why not? For 0.3, I have, you know, a whole bunch of ethereum. Why not? It's probably, you know, a good investment. Another Santiago. Santiago is sort of sprinkled throughout the show here. Time and the pleasure of mistakes, of mistake painting made with AI tools and gimp, as we were just looking at gimp there by Santiago.
00:40:17.334 - 00:40:36.490, Speaker A: So combining AI. So Santiago is using AI and combining it with gimp. So just an interesting result here. A one of one. And was it sold? Yeah, for 155. So that is pretty nice. Again, these one of ones are very desirable.
00:40:36.490 - 00:41:30.102, Speaker A: You know, like, when you're collecting and it's a one of one, it's like there's only one. And so, like, to state the obvious here, sometimes you can make more with a one of one than an addition, like, depending on. So it's always something to think about, because if you had put out an addition of 15 at seven, what would he have gotten here? Like 105. And here someone just offered 155. So see what I'm saying? So this went, this beautiful work here, another really cheap price here for this beautiful venta work. And we looked at this before. I mean, again, this has kind of real gallery vibes, contemporary art gallery vibes, where I think, if you know the gallery down the street here in Berlin, those trendy galleries, I think they'd be more than happy to have this work up in their gallery and sold for a song.
00:41:30.102 - 00:41:50.374, Speaker A: Their first work on foundation. Foundation vent, its first work went for 0.1 ETH. And what is that, like, $130? So I think this person, Kyle, loves you. They got a steal here for this work. This is a very, very nice work, if you ask me. Looks like AI and digital painting, I would guess.
00:41:50.374 - 00:42:13.854, Speaker A: This seems like AI. So again, this combination, what we were kind of looking at, we opened with Venta here today. Here's some more venta. You have no idea how excited I am to get this collection out into the world. I've been trying my hardest to make my AI art unique to my style. So we were looking at Venta's page and said, what happened to the AI? The AI was looking spectacular. Well, she's been working on it.
00:42:13.854 - 00:42:38.346, Speaker A: And so, anyways, here's the latest. And she's very excited. Again, I think it's a she very excited to release new work here. Pretty nice work, if you ask me. Again, that soft construction with boiled beans, that kind of reminds me of, for some reason, another work by Santiago. Here, look at this. So you can see Santiago seems to be getting into the AI.
00:42:38.346 - 00:43:25.354, Speaker A: This is when we sat down and you told your story. So this looks like AI to me, especially considering Santiago's style, which is traditionally abstract. I assume it's his, and it looks like just a work in progress. But isn't it interesting when you get all the experimentation again? Remember Santiago's super rare piece, the abstraction, where he's taking all these other sources and making abstractions out of it? What happens when you get an artist like that working in AI? So, anyways, in this blue and black over here, pretty interesting. Some other AI, Anna Dart, with just an interesting work here. Again, just something you'd maybe never do without a machine, I assume. Yeah, this is made with AI, AI art.
00:43:25.354 - 00:43:58.654, Speaker A: And I thought this was an interesting take and seems to be similar to those two portraits that were done at the start in AI that were done because this looks like. I almost recognize this face as an angra. So this looks like an angra painting that's probably uploaded a source image and then kind of modified with prompts, I'm assuming. Okay, so just pretty interesting. This is Jam Jimpolsky M. And let's just see. Right, so this is in a thread.
00:43:58.654 - 00:44:20.328, Speaker A: Here are a couple of my oil paintings. Soon is nft. So this is an oil painting. Okay. So I thought this was an AI artwork. That's interesting. Okay, now my first question then is, was AI used as a source for this? Who knows? Very interesting.
00:44:20.328 - 00:44:45.416, Speaker A: Again, I thought this was an angra. You know, like, if we look here very quickly, angra girl portrait. Let's see if we can find. Yeah, I mean, it looks exactly like portrait of Mademoiselle Riviere. So I just assumed. And maybe that is how this was constructed. This is an oil painting, and this is what I've been kind of saying about the AI.
00:44:45.416 - 00:45:26.974, Speaker A: And we don't know if that's what happened here, but the temptation, for me, one of the temptations of a billion different things you can do these days is you make a work in AI and then you paint it, right? So interesting edge queue. Who did one of the portraits at the beginning, you know, he was the guy who was doing the trading cards, remember? And like, the kind of the chill, trip hop sort of tunes. He has been experimenting with AI. And look at the resolution he's getting. Like, I don't know if you can see, but this is sharp. Like, very sharp. So I think he's been experimenting with, like, we can look here quickly.
00:45:26.974 - 00:45:48.314, Speaker A: And that's a drum machine by him. Like, he hasn't been experimenting. Maybe he's been experimenting for a while. Because again, this, I picked up this piece, this Keith Haring. These are done with AI. Some of these pieces, like this one here, the Keith Haring. It's probably like basketball in Keith haring style or something like that.
00:45:48.314 - 00:46:33.968, Speaker A: But now he's gotten into this kind of, like three dimensional. And I just think, like, look at how fast this can happen. And, like, the resolution is off the charts when you just look at how, like, if I just load this up, like, it's pretty sharp. Okay, so all to say, this is how fast you can get good at AI. And pretty interesting piece, too. And you kind of, you, you know, know, it looks like a DJ type guy, you know, at his music controls here, or maybe working the, you know, working in the music studio. Signore Giacomo y Dilla, the almighty on the Manichina de sampler.
00:46:33.968 - 00:46:55.242, Speaker A: So it's probably a sampler here. So super interesting. And here's a drum machine, the first drum machine in the world. So a hypothetical first drum machine in the world created by da Vinci. And so anyways, pretty awesome by edgeq here. Super interesting. And you see how fast you can get good at this.
00:46:55.242 - 00:47:15.264, Speaker A: I mean, that's not to take away. I mean, he's probably working pretty darn hard. Martin Jo also working in AI. And these works seem to be going somewhere for me. Like, they're. It's pretty interesting, these bears and everything. Pleasure wasteland, the kinky bears sort of series.
00:47:15.264 - 00:47:50.604, Speaker A: And so anyways, Martin Joe edition of 50, available for one tezos only. See, this has a similar kind of feel to Martin Joe's work, too. So I assume also AI Newman's from my surreal musical instruments collection, 50% gone. So anyways, and you can see here, at the risk of crashing our mic, we are going to take a look here. And so here are more surreal music instruments. So it kind of went with our drum machine there, our hypothetical drum machine created by DaVinci. So look at that.
00:47:50.604 - 00:48:11.998, Speaker A: So all sorts of interesting things happening in AI here. You can pick them up for 0.777. A new work by what is Iana. And again, combining digital painting with AI. So. And this actually is now being bid on. So what is Ayanna continues on his role.
00:48:11.998 - 00:48:49.722, Speaker A: So that is super cool. And true face, who we started last episode with GMO. Geez, can you name this animal? So again, true face seems to have some pretty advanced algorithms that may be homegrown here. So pretty interesting kind of results. Kind of plants that look like kind of, you know, it kind of, what's his name? Archimboldo. Kind of reminiscent a little bit. Arkim Boldo, who many of you will know who does the fruit that turns into the face and all that sort of thing.
00:48:49.722 - 00:49:17.526, Speaker A: Right? Arkim Boldo, kind of just a 16th century, a unique sort of 16th century pitch painter. I mean, it's pretty distant, but you see what I'm saying with the flowers that basically make the animal. So interesting work there. And Mister shapeless with some nice works to close us off here. If this is raw, AI too, like these very soft clouds and beautiful sky. And there's our kind of wanderer figure. It looks like they're facing us this time.
00:49:17.526 - 00:49:42.148, Speaker A: Lavender fields of Venus. And one more bliss by Mister Shapeless. So just another beautiful landscape by Mister Shapeless. And do we have any more? Here's another one. Crystal Lake. And these things with the reflection of the sun, again, looks like the Arctic, a hypothetical arctic. And then these shapes over here, reminiscent of Yves Tanguy.
00:49:42.148 - 00:50:02.154, Speaker A: A little bit of his late work. And should we just quickly. Yves Tanguy. So I want you to look just right here. See that? All these kind of shapes and everything put Yves tengui paintings. Yeah. Especially, like, let's see if we can get a decent size here.
00:50:02.154 - 00:50:19.064, Speaker A: Kind of, you know, reminiscent of these kind of shapes here. Yves Tangi. I haven't shown the images from this surrealist exhibition I went to about a month ago. I need to show that to you guys. This is a friend of mine. This is from Instagram. And I didn't put it because he's a friend of mine.
00:50:19.064 - 00:50:33.404, Speaker A: This is my friend Ben, who lives in Berlin. I thought this was an outstanding still life. This is pencil and oil on paper. I assume this is pencil here. And oil on paper. A still life. I thought this was gorgeous.
00:50:33.404 - 00:50:52.814, Speaker A: So very nice work there. And here are some other ones that he was working on, but this really stood out. And that, my friends, is your show. So thank you for joining me. And until next time, which is tomorrow, take care. We're gonna have a Twitter spaces on Wednesday, same time, same place. Wednesday at 09:30 a.m.
00:50:52.814 - 00:50:55.054, Speaker A: Eastern standard Time. Until next time, take care.
