00:00:06.640 - 00:00:22.094, Speaker A: I'm back and I have good news. It is haircut day today. It's actually not terrible today. It almost looks like I got a haircut, at least in my mind. But later on this afternoon, a transformation, hopefully, will occur. Welcome back. This is artist journal.
00:00:22.094 - 00:00:42.594, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokobelli, your artist reporter. It is October 6, 2022. Thank you for the very nice comments. I got some great comments on YouTube yesterday. And then we are going to look at, there's a few things, as ever, and then we're going to look at this beautiful mimocat work. Beautiful. Beautiful.
00:00:42.594 - 00:01:01.352, Speaker A: Very quickly, before we get to those comments, actually, isolationist is on super rare. Congratulations. So just interesting to watch this cross chain thing go on. I think it's great. I like how it's not like some huge competition. The world is too small. Life is too short.
00:01:01.352 - 00:01:34.254, Speaker A: I think this is great. This is good for both chains and everything. Also here, a post by super rare. Earlier this year, a job posting appeared online at the Museum of Modern Art. MoMA was searching for a web3 associate. So we have job postings here, too, on my little public journal. If an institution like MoMA wants to dip its toes in web3, what does that mean for crypto art? And so you can read the whole thing here.
00:01:34.254 - 00:02:05.358, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's exactly. We pointed this out maybe ten or 15 episodes ago. And so this continues, which is why I bring this up. So they are looking for a web3 person. They're pretty slow, aren't they? They're pretty slow. Now, this term crypto art, I've always been mildly troubled by it. You see, I think it was in that artnet article that we saw, it was two words, and now in super rare, they, crypto art, people use it as one word, which is just kind of interesting.
00:02:05.358 - 00:02:41.072, Speaker A: I mean, I've always kind of shied away from it and just in this respect. And then we'll move on to other more important things. But if I'm introducing myself at a gallery to someone and saying, I'm in nfts, I much prefer saying I'm just into NFT art or something like that, because crypto art, for me, just personally, and everybody has their own feeling about it, but to me, it feels like dungeons and dragons or something like, no, I'm really into dungeons and dragons and I. It's really awesome. Believe me, it's the best. You know, it's got a bit of that feeling to me. But whatever.
00:02:41.072 - 00:03:08.484, Speaker A: I mean, and will it stick? My take is, I think it will. But for Ethereum art from let's say 2018 to 2021 or something. Maybe that will be known as crypto art. Just a theory, who knows? So you can read the whole thread here. It goes into depth. But yeah, I just wonder, all these different genres, and I keep saying I'm going to do the genres of digital art and I will. We heard from Roontune.
00:03:08.484 - 00:03:29.488, Speaker A: Enormous gratitude for the thoughtful discussion. So isn't this wonderful? Thank you, roon tune. Much to think on and much more to unpack. Indeed. As I said, this one, you yesterday's episode wouldn't have happened without runetune. So this is a conversation, as some people pointed out. And he also put out a really nice tweet.
00:03:29.488 - 00:03:52.534, Speaker A: I assume it's a he looking for some texture and perspective on AI and digital art market. Look no further. Another insightful overview of NFT art and the way the current moment threads into art movements of the past. So thank you rune toon. This is awesome. This makes me happy. As I said yesterday, this is why, you know, this is what we live for on this program.
00:03:52.534 - 00:04:05.746, Speaker A: So thank you. And some really nice comments here from Evan Major. Thank you for this. What a conversation we're all having. Blessed to be a part of it. Excellent, this one, Adrian, thank you. From Valentin and Vito.
00:04:05.746 - 00:04:22.056, Speaker A: Very interesting episode. Bravo. So people really liked that move into history. Yesterday one person messaged me and was like, a little less history, please. What I said is, you know what, this is a public journal. I like the history. It could be shorter though.
00:04:22.056 - 00:04:44.560, Speaker A: Like, I am trying to make these episodes shorter. So we're moving on here in the episode. Hilarious post from rustic digital art. This morning when pokebilly the movie, I had a good laugh. Thank you, rustic. I told them the rate that these episodes are increasing in length, it's not going to be long. We're going to be publishing movies here daily and a couple of auctions.
00:04:44.560 - 00:05:06.966, Speaker A: Greco, our guy with the horse painting. Let me just make sure I got his name right. Is it Greco? I thought his name was Greco. Maybe on twitter I saw him. I think his name is Greco. He's got a horse painting. My head is going to burn and he's got an auction is what I'm trying to say here.
00:05:06.966 - 00:05:43.814, Speaker A: Cool Lacoste bic lighter, a few cigarettes. Just a cool work. Interesting paintings in the background. 10 hours to go, no bids. So opportunity knocks and I think, and I'll correct that if I got that wrong yesterday, but I thought I saw him on twitter and also bazaya botanic trip is also at 42 tez, so doing pretty good with 5 hours to go here. And let's just take a quick look at this awesome mimocat. Still available, by the way, for two tez.
00:05:43.814 - 00:06:10.194, Speaker A: Um, these keep on getting better and better. You see the texture here again, you see this beautiful floral thing going on here. Which totally reminds me, I brought it up of Botticelli. You know, not to, I don't want these to sound pretentious, but, you know, it really. And Leonardo does the same thing. So just, I mean, it's really nicely done. Let's just zoom in.
00:06:10.194 - 00:06:33.198, Speaker A: Yeah. You know, like, it's not a huge stretch there, is it? I mean, it's, it is and it isn't, let's put it that way. But I just think, look at the care that has been put into this. Like, it's beautiful. You know, value is being created here. What else? We had this amazing. Do we get everybody else? Yes, we had this amazing work by Marcelo Pinel on super rare.
00:06:33.198 - 00:06:55.594, Speaker A: So a quick, super rare work here. Let's see if we can get the volume. Let's see. Yeah, we'll see if it renders. Look at this. I mean, really next level. The music is awesome.
00:06:55.594 - 00:07:14.588, Speaker A: You know, I used to be a Goa DJ. As I've said before, this speaks. They'll, they'll love that. The psychedelic trance scene. I used to be huge into that like 15 years ago. They're gonna love this guy. So this guy is going places.
00:07:14.588 - 00:07:32.460, Speaker A: There is an auction. Someone made an offer for six. Is that where we are here? So I don't know if the reserve has been met. So. Yeah, so anyways. Marcel Pinel. Marcelo Pinellas.
00:07:32.460 - 00:07:46.424, Speaker A: Starting bid 2.69. Sound on auction starts tomorrow. Okay. Work by Dextere that I missed the other day, but just saw it. I guess I wasn't following him. I am now. Just a really, really, really nice.
00:07:46.424 - 00:08:13.400, Speaker A: Just a really nice gif, isn't it? Sunset people on a car again. Dextere just has a way of just hitting the right notes there. That went for 250 each. So raising his prices by fifty cents, I believe. And yeah, edition of ten. You might be able to put an offer in another one who we've been looking at. Lewis Osborne put out his moving cities.
00:08:13.400 - 00:08:30.644, Speaker A: Six. If you're lucky enough to own two of the other moving cities, you got this one for free. So a nice way of rewarding collectors there. And already let's see if any, what they've sold for. I mean, really nice. Look at that. He put out a couple of works yesterday.
00:08:30.644 - 00:09:00.824, Speaker A: Very nice. Let's just look at the market. If any have sold. None have sold, interestingly, but you can buy it for 69. So let's see where that goes. Then there is this other piece, this interactive piece, and that's a whole other kind of mini genre of these interactive works. Mood decider, the first piece from me and play NFT's new interactive collection on object, accepting the top 29 offers tomorrow.
00:09:00.824 - 00:09:24.234, Speaker A: So here it is. So you see how it works. Depending on where you click, you get the happy or the sad face. So just interesting. Again, as I was saying the other day, unapologetically digital. You cannot do this on analog painting, right? So that is fun. Click hold and release to find out your mood for the day.
00:09:24.234 - 00:09:39.750, Speaker A: Let's just see what the offers are. Just out of curiosity. It's always fun to follow Louis Osborne's market. Wow. Purple drank putting in a 70 Tazo 6942 bid. So generally. Okay, so there's an addition of 30.
00:09:39.750 - 00:09:59.454, Speaker A: Generally what happens with Louis Osborne's work is in the last five minutes you get a whole shrack load of offers come in. So already again, there are 27 offers. This thing's gonna go probably. He's gonna make a lot of money off this. He's probably gonna make 1000 tezos is my guess off this. So, wow. Or both of them.
00:09:59.454 - 00:10:25.452, Speaker A: Moving on. Remember this guy with the UFO and who collaborated with Lewis Osborne? Well, there was another work that came out that I also missed on October 3. That kind of goes really nicely. Again, just this illustration, it's kind of half psychedelic, half just graphic design. Touch psychedelic. Just a beautiful illustration. Kind of reminiscent of Escher, but not really at the same time.
00:10:25.452 - 00:10:37.926, Speaker A: Totally its own thing. That's by paper crane. So another interesting work from them. Buy for 77. Let's just look at what the mint price was. Accepting offers. 42, 30, 26.
00:10:37.926 - 00:11:00.114, Speaker A: So mint crane, is that right? Yeah. So taking the top offers here also. So the lowest was 20 edition of 15. So 300 tezos at least. More like probably 400 when it was all said and done. Pretty good for your illustration. $600.
00:11:00.114 - 00:11:28.280, Speaker A: Newark from rustic digital art and Santiago, a collaboration stream of consciousness. So just a nice work. This looks like Santiago in the middle with kind of like the Van Gogh esque drawing lines and very nice combination, I have to say. And then we got some kind of hidden icons, question marks inside. It's going for 14. Still available on primary. Very nice work.
00:11:28.280 - 00:11:50.344, Speaker A: More lackos. So unfortunately, another person in reference I haven't heard of, Kim Jung gi. I assume I'm pronouncing that right. Seems like a pretty big deal. From what I've seen on Twitter, unfortunately, he passed away, I think by surprise. Sound like chest pains or something. 1975 to 2022.
00:11:50.344 - 00:12:11.534, Speaker A: A very nice work of what looks like Kim Jong ge doing work in Morlaco's trademark style. He's really good at that. He can just take anything and trace it in his style. And it works. How much was that? Fifty cents. Fifty tezos cents. I don't think I've picked that up, so I'm going to have to buy that as soon as I'm done here.
00:12:11.534 - 00:12:31.398, Speaker A: Cloud Pepe as well by Morlakos. So he continues with the Pepe series. I believe this is on bitcoin. Interestingly, I believe another beautiful work by spugelsmaskinen from his abnormal series. Let's just. This is the. I believe an elevator.
00:12:31.398 - 00:12:41.154, Speaker A: Let's just look. A hurdle. Life plant. Suitcase. Shopping cart. It looks like some sort of elevator, though. Let's see if this plays.
00:12:41.154 - 00:13:05.130, Speaker A: So it looks like the suitcase is blocking the elevator door. It's brilliant. Again, this poetry of the abandoned shopping mall. I am all over. I am all over. We mentioned JG Ballard. Here he is all over that.
00:13:05.130 - 00:13:20.894, Speaker A: Empty swimming pools, that sort of thing. The poetry of the abandoned shopping mall. Very cool work. This was also interesting. We're kind of racing through things here today. Okay, so this is by Sky Goodman. Look at this intro.
00:13:20.894 - 00:14:13.332, Speaker A: Pretty cool music. So I'll let you check out the whole thing. Pretty cool. Nice, nice, nice collaboration. Music by Joey Mealand again, using, I think, many tools, which is what I like about what Sky Goodman does, is he exports from tool to tool, which I think is a great method created using VR blender, video feedback, textures and resolume, you know, softwares. Some of them I haven't even heard of, like resolume. So interesting.
00:14:13.332 - 00:14:36.916, Speaker A: A very interesting collaboration with Francoise Gamma. Look at this. Because we've seen often this walking guy that is this trademark sort of thing with the lines and now with pixelation. Very nice. I miss this on primary. I think it only went for one tezos. Now it's ten.
00:14:36.916 - 00:14:53.634, Speaker A: So you gotta figure out if you want to pay. Oh, no, it's all ten tezos. Sorry, history tentezos. I was looking at the quantity. So they're ten tezos. But I mean, it's a very, very nice work. What is the addition number? Um.
00:14:53.634 - 00:15:18.664, Speaker A: I don't see it here. I don't want to count all that. Looks like about two, four, six. It looks like twelve or 15, something like that. It's probably a better way to find that out. Continuing on calming river. So a new work by our indonesian artist Michael Alexander, aka M e K txt, Mek TxT.
00:15:18.664 - 00:15:42.722, Speaker A: He makes really beautiful pixel art. I love his nature work in particular. So he's got a new one. I don't believe this is for sale yet. And when you buy this one, then you get this as a token of appreciation for all primary collectors. So you get two for one here. So very.
00:15:42.722 - 00:16:01.994, Speaker A: I just love his nature work. So a new one over there. This guy is interesting. I'm not sure what his name is. He did a tribute to Coolio. So another tribute here, a pixelated portrait of Coolio and 3d animated loop. So I'm just going to show you this.
00:16:01.994 - 00:16:32.736, Speaker A: If it loads up here, let's try this. Because there are older works that I'm going to go to that I really, really like, that are done with kind of a game boy. So I'll show you some of his older work. I bought these older ones. Yeah, like old dirty bastard, you know, I love these works. So there was this one and there was another one. And again, I just saw these side by side.
00:16:32.736 - 00:17:09.472, Speaker A: I just think a really nice take on the modern portrait, you know, and you get. You get the profile. It's almost like a mug shot to a certain degree, I guess. Here it's only three, four profile, but still, it's almost weirdly scientific in the way that you kind of get a sense for their profile and just what they look like. So very, very nice portraits here. I don't know the name of this artist, unfortunately, but pretty cool. If you put Pixel Coolio into the search, you will find him some more works by Haiti that I missed because I don't think we get notified anymore.
00:17:09.472 - 00:17:23.238, Speaker A: Total gangsta. So nice piece here. I guess you have to follow him on Twitter. So just a simple glitch. Rom work. Pretty cool. And this was also interesting.
00:17:23.238 - 00:17:42.938, Speaker A: Rad disc gif image edition of 13. Kind of classic, although slightly different for him at the same time. I think we might have some more flashing images. Careful with this one. If you're sensitive. We'll turn it off right away here by native Ed. So kind of more kind of optical art type stuff.
00:17:42.938 - 00:18:07.808, Speaker A: New work by Elbie. Just kind of video textures, which are very interesting. They're quite beautiful, atmospheric. I mean, would go great on the wall of a party, wouldn't it? A very meta work by Minta. My portrait of my portrait of my portrait. I was trying to figure this out. So my portrait of my portrait, my portrait.
00:18:07.808 - 00:18:31.670, Speaker A: So she's doing a portrait of her portrait that, I guess someone else did her portrait, and she's doing a portrait of that portrait, which is her portrait. Okay, I think we figured it out. Still available for Tezos 50. Always fun. On Minta's side, I thought this was just a great work. I saw this on Twitter. So simple but powerful.
00:18:31.670 - 00:18:49.378, Speaker A: This keyboard here. Massive, massive keyboard. Retro computer. Who's this by Lola Dupre, artist and illustrator. Time, Nike, Penguin, New York Times. Okay, so they have a pretty nice resume there. So very nice work.
00:18:49.378 - 00:19:19.554, Speaker A: I didn't see it on object, though. Interestingly, just some AI works. This was interesting because we've been talking a lot about Max Ernst, and Danielle King has been continued her AI mashup series of different artists. Now she's added another interesting thing. Not only is she doing Max Ernst, which is a very interesting artist to use for this series, but she's compared it with a writer, which is super interesting. And this brings up this Twitter space. So kind of an interesting work.
00:19:19.554 - 00:20:12.650, Speaker A: And I was in this or listening to this Twitter spaces yesterday. Maybe I'll bring that up. First of this, AIad. I think it's an art show. I'm not totally clued in, but there's some kind of big art exhibition that if you put the hashtag AIad, I think you'll find it AI art show. And I was listening to their Twitter spaces, and it was very interesting because these people that are very deep into the AI art thing, it's very interesting to hear what they're saying, which is almost like they're having a conversation with a machine and how they're putting in hundreds of prompts into the AI tool, whichever it is, you know, mid journey or. What's the other one? I was looking it up here.
00:20:12.650 - 00:20:37.830, Speaker A: I actually just signed up to it, stable diffusion or something. And then, of course, Dali. So that was interesting to hear because you heard of how much work was being put into it. Back to this idea. Okay, well, it's not just pushing a button. There's a lot of refining going on. So anyways, and another guy made a very important point, too, I think, which he, he was saying, and I can't remember his name, unfortunately.
00:20:37.830 - 00:21:06.766, Speaker A: He was saying how this is just going to become a part of our tools. And to not use AI as a tool right now is the equivalent of ignoring digital when Photoshop came out, or. Sorry, ignoring Photoshop. It's like that equivalent. It's just resisting the new technology. And that point resonated a lot. So it reminded me of, don't take forever to learn this technology, you know, get your, use your free credits at Dali.
00:21:06.766 - 00:21:23.222, Speaker A: Try these different things. Go to mid journey on discord, et cetera, et cetera. There are many YouTube videos about it. Actually, I missed talking about this. So this is by weird Nikita. Just an interesting. Again, I guess you can get this on object as well.
00:21:23.222 - 00:21:50.390, Speaker A: Let's quickly look at the market on this thing. Edition of ten offers for 21 accepted. So, yeah, so a very strong, healthy market. AI art continuing on. What is this called? Declay decay of replete revelation. I love this one. And this one was also particularly educational and illustrative because I wondered, generated by AI Daly.
00:21:50.390 - 00:22:24.954, Speaker A: Two, is this the prompt? Like, if I put this prompt into Dali, am I going to get, like, something similar? You know, this comma bicarvaggio, an angry mob of Ronald McDonald's protesting for bad working conditions at McDonald's. So, I mean, a pretty nice result. And look at this other one is this. This looks like a different one, right? I mean, so it's very like. I mean, we have to give credit to this. Like, we can't ignore this, as that guy was saying. It's like ignoring Photoshop in the nineties, you know, like.
00:22:24.954 - 00:23:02.500, Speaker A: So another AI. That's why we give so much attention to AI here. We're trying to figure it out, all of us together. And I think we made some good progress yesterday. Another very quick point. Remember the comparison that rune thun was doing with abstract expressionism? I think another thing we learned yesterday is surrealism is maybe the artist movement that really goes well with AI if we're going to start to look for predecessors, because it's so similar, it seems, again, like an extension of a surrealism. Like, it's like a surrealist tool, one could argue.
00:23:02.500 - 00:23:34.824, Speaker A: So again, I think we've seen this artist before, Charlesai ETH, with these huge windows, which I found. And then you have big paintings inside, and the paintings. And you see how the outdoors comes into the indoors. And this beautiful light, just kind of grand, as this person says, beautiful. And it really is. Here is another one natural museum. Okay, so people in a museum looking at nature, it looks like one big window, but you can't tell.
00:23:34.824 - 00:24:00.768, Speaker A: And sky at the top, and you can't tell if it's real sky or if it's painted sky. So just a very nice, ambiguous piece, I'd argue. Another AI work, leaks of time by Javio Javier Tomao, which we, who we also looked at. So it looks kind of like an undersea thing going on. Very beautiful, you know, very nice results. And my almost empty tezos wallet. So we're going to keep it simple and short today here, folks.
00:24:00.768 - 00:24:05.544, Speaker A: Thank you for everything. Thank you for the comments. Until next time, take care.
