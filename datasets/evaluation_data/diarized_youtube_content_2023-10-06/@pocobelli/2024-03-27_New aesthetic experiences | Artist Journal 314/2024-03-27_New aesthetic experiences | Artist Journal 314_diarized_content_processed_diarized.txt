00:00:03.040 - 00:00:23.302, Speaker A: Full blast. As we take off on our journey into the unknown one more time, my friends, again, I am blinded by my imagination here as I say these words. I see our ship. I don't see the beautiful sun and sky outside. I see our ship. I see that sea. I see the reflection of the sun on the water.
00:00:23.302 - 00:01:02.724, Speaker A: A beautiful, calm, sunny day on the pirate ship of the mind. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, broadcasting from the inner half of the nervous system here with the great cedar plank. Perhaps fittingly for our pirate ship. Is that a metaphor anymore? I'm not even sure. Maybe it's just become reality here, a surreality, as our friends back in the 1930s used to say. So anyways, welcome back. A stream of consciousness edition, which is almost totally fitting as I was looking at this work here by Cedar Plank, aka hastrubal waffle.
00:01:02.724 - 00:01:51.584, Speaker A: Now, what I love, what I love about this artist and this work, first of all, again, it can be difficult to understand what we're talking about and why. You know, for a lot of people, you know, this might be a surprise. Why would this start the newspaper of the imagination? And for me, there was just no question. It was very obvious. I mean, there were other kind of people, other works that were fighting their way here, but just for. But it was just so obvious because it had that head turning quality. And it's the translucent waffles who, of course, uses the mysterious waffles, uses many aliases, and uses retro software.
00:01:51.584 - 00:02:13.304, Speaker A: And what we're seeing here is an introduction of, you know, transparency into the mix here. And it's head turning again, there's. It reminds me of. We've mentioned this before with Hysdrubal's work. It's like what I call the Doodle style. Right? I mean, it's almost like these guys, I think, or. Or women, I'm sure.
00:02:13.304 - 00:02:46.982, Speaker A: But as far as works we're seeing here right now, you know, again, I'm thinking of hysterubel waffle and Basquia. Right. The doodle style. You know, things I did in high school just kind of like, you know, endlessly doodling. And here it is, doodling again. And what's so beautiful and brilliant about this style is once you kind of nail it, you. Or once you get comfortable with it, shall we say, you can kind of do anything.
00:02:46.982 - 00:03:51.096, Speaker A: I mean, what is this? Right? What is this work? I mean, here is our clue from the tweet. Here is our clue. I wish to speak to the manager, which is kind of amazing, actually. It kind of weirdly fits maybe this king figure here and almost a touch Basquia esque, shall we say, with the three pronged kind of crown there and even with the kind of maybe the skeleton a little bit, although completely different simultaneously. But this kind of whimsicality, really, again, the doodle style. And as we see here, I would say, I would put hasdrubal totally in the tradition, say, of Basquiat and these doodle artists, which perhaps, I mean, in a sense, we could see Keith haring as a kind of doodle artist, right? And there is, you could say, an overlap with graffiti and street art. It is a kind of doodling, right? You're kind of just.
00:03:51.096 - 00:05:24.478, Speaker A: And there is kind of a, again, an overlap with people in high school, you know, just kind of, you know, it's kind of that kind of style of artwork, right. I mean, and it's easy to overlook, again, this is almost a product of, like, post 1960s or post 1950s, like, you know, world, you know, high school without the kind of seriousness, in a sense, just to illustrate the point, I mean, in the 1920s or 1910s, were they, you know, I felt like the world was a little too uptight for there to be big doodlers in class. Right? This is almost a product of our kind of more modern world. And with it, again, it's like this doodle sketchbook style has been transposed or transplanted or reformatted or recontextualized or just has continued, let's just be very simple about it, has continued onto the digital space where it's like, okay, I'm making some art pieces. People seem to like them and buy them, and I make them in my browser, oftentimes using various tools, you know, imagining what's going on in Cedar Planck's head here. And so continuing again, the doodle style here and again, weirdly, it doesn't even need to make sense. It's the celebration of digital mark making, for lack of a better term.
00:05:24.478 - 00:06:16.980, Speaker A: Because the reason I say for lack of a better term is, you know, if you make a big square, these kind of digital squares with what look like little gradients inside the square, I mean, you know, this square here with a circular gradient inside, it doesn't really feel like mark making, does it? Although it is, you know. And what is Mark making? I mean, it's something that often people who go to art school will talk about. It's like, oh, that's nice, mark making. But, you know, ways of making different kinds of textures, ways of creating different kinds of, you know, outcomes when you are applying paint to canvas, or in this case, pixels to screen. Right? So again, what's so interesting about this and mystifying is it doesn't need to make sense in a weird sort of way. Like, these are feet. There's a face.
00:06:16.980 - 00:06:46.004, Speaker A: None of it needs to work because it's beautiful. The work is. It justifies itself. The aesthetic quality, the exploration, the novelty, the difference speaks for itself, doesn't it? And, like, I mean, if I had to guess, this looks like a chicken, you know, a piece of chicken or something that's been repeated, but maybe it's a person. Again, it doesn't matter. Look at the bone here, and there's the head. The freedom.
00:06:46.004 - 00:07:16.654, Speaker A: The power of the doodle style is once you kind of get comfortable with it and get good at it, you can kind of do anything, right. It ceases to be like, the subject matter matters. This stream of conscious subject matter. Again, here we have, like, a burger right here we have an eye coming out. It reminds you of the sneeze. The sneeze artwork by waffles or cedar plank here. And here you have green smoke coming out.
00:07:16.654 - 00:08:01.180, Speaker A: The skeleton over top of the body. Again, x ray, translucent, maybe making a commentary of sorts on the see through nature of the, you know, the style here. So all to say, just really original, interesting, and ultimately a head turner before. And what was so interesting about this as well, and maybe you had a similar experience. I assume a lot of you have already seen this work, who are on x and who kind of follow Cedar plank. What was interesting about this is I didn't need to look at the name of who it was, even though it was kind of a different kind of work from cedar plank or waffles. I didn't need to know who.
00:08:01.180 - 00:08:56.788, Speaker A: I knew exactly who it was immediately, and I knew I loved it before I even saw it. It was one of those things that all of a sudden, you're like, this is totally new, but aesthetically, something is really working here. And I would say, you know, it's, again, what is finally here, not to go too long on this, but what is the. The revolutionary act here? I don't think it, like, in a certain degree, I would say waffles. It's not like waffles is going out and saying, today I'm gonna make a revolutionary artwork. And here it comes again, the power of the doodle style. It's more like, ah, you know, if I had to guess, hey, I'm going to experiment with this, and this looks kind of cool, and I'm going to do this and because waffles regularly makes work and is prolific and is doing a lot of things, this comes out, and it's like, you know, and there you have it.
00:08:56.788 - 00:09:24.852, Speaker A: It's. And then all of a sudden, you go, wow, what did I just do? Again, it's kind of a stream of consciousness kind of act. And very similar to the show, art making is a kind of improvisation. I don't know what I'm gonna say. Generally speaking. Sometimes I have vague ideas, but generally speaking, it's an improvisation, and I'm often surprised at what comes out. And I think this is a similar situation with the art.
00:09:24.852 - 00:10:23.254, Speaker A: Again, I think of also Robert Rauschenberg, who, very importantly, one of the most important kind of interviews I ever watched, and I mentioned this before, the interviewer asked him. I think it was the same interview, which I can't find on YouTube, by the way, even though that's where I originally saw it, where the first question the interviewer asks is like a 1970s interview. And the woman interviewer asked, tell me about the artist reporter, this amazing term you've come up with. And I wish I could find that. And Rauschenberg was almost kind of embarrassed and like, oh, like that was just something I had come up with, kind of something that didn't really stick. I love that term, as many of you know. And then the next question, if I remember the interview, right, if I'm not conflating them with several interviews into one, was, do you plan your works? Do you plan your works? And the answer was never.
00:10:23.254 - 00:10:53.514, Speaker A: And I'm sure, again, maybe similar to this show. Okay, I know I want to play with this JFK image. Maybe I want to play with this, you know, picture of the moon landing if I'm Rauschenberg. But ultimately does. Is he going, okay, I'm going to put that in the top left, I think, today. No, he opens the canvas, and he just starts going. So the power, you know, of stream of consciousness in terms of novel imagery is kind of where I'm going with this, kind of.
00:10:53.514 - 00:11:30.580, Speaker A: Again, it's kind of weirdly similar to this show. It's a similar act of embracing the moment and really embracing a process to a certain degree here, which is here. Okay, I'm gonna take this retro software, you know, vintage software, as Kristin Roose would put it, and I'm gonna try some different things with it and see what happens. I mean, that's ultimately. And maybe keep it within my. And play with my doodle and doodle. I mean, that's pretty much what seems to be waffles, you know, process here.
00:11:30.580 - 00:12:11.682, Speaker A: And also from the interview we did, I think, over a year ago now it feels like longer, actually, but with waffles. Hystrubal waffle, again, the older incarnation or the alias, we might say, of cedar plank. One thing that waffles does is come up with the idea or the title ahead of time, something which is actually kind of difficult. But if you're not worried about how, you know, it's one way of working where he said he had a text document where he'd keep, like, if he had a title, he would write it down, right? Or an idea for an artwork. So all to say, just very interesting. And again, I want to speak to the manager. I wish to speak to the manager.
00:12:11.682 - 00:12:41.184, Speaker A: Maybe is one of those things. Who knows? Not necessarily. Maybe just going just while working, saying, okay, this is what kind of came to mind. Maybe this is the person wanting to speak to the manager with this lime green frame. Again, that's part of the process, playing with, you know, this has become a habitual thing, these frames, these very interesting frames. I think at Ed Marolla here, it's orange, and here's another piece. And, you know, I can't help but look at the signature there.
00:12:41.184 - 00:13:25.714, Speaker A: You know, like, what? What does that say, Max? Something, right? And then here, what looks like another piece of chicken, interestingly so maybe I was right about the chicken in the last work. And this person that looks like they're made of fries with a cigarette. And again, you know, not worrying about anatomy, not worrying about anything. This is the doodle style, but really embracing the medium. And almost, it's like this idea of when you're working and recognizing that, hey, this is a pretty. It's almost like, kind of like Nev, 1914, who we're going to look at in a second here. Being able to recognize new aesthetic.
00:13:25.714 - 00:14:21.736, Speaker A: New aesthetic situations, for lack of a better word, new ways of appreciating visual beauty, new aesthetics. Using these digital mediums so that have not been entirely explored yet, which I would argue makes it the most interesting space in the entire world as far as visual arts concerned, because for all of the brilliance of the painting and the physical paintings we see and the airbrush style, not to go too long here, actually, this should be a shorter show, theoretically, like the airbrush style. The reason why that's so interesting is because, oh, we have something kind of different here, right, in painting, but there's not much where it's digital. We still have all of these tools. There are multiple softwares. There you have Santiago making his own software. Right? So there.
00:14:21.736 - 00:14:50.166, Speaker A: That's why there's. There's so much to discover. There are so many aesthetic aesthetics, you know, let's call it that. There are so many aesthetics to discover here. And I feel like here, again, the reason why this was kind of a no brainer for me is like, this feels different, but I still appreciate it, and I get it, and it looks great. I would argue maybe you disagree, but I think this looks great. This is different.
00:14:50.166 - 00:15:05.606, Speaker A: This is exciting. This is painterly. Again, we're kind of back to this idea of digital texture. Now here's another one. This was from March 22, and this is on Zora. Let's see if we can make it a little bigger. So just, you know, so recent works.
00:15:05.606 - 00:15:49.234, Speaker A: This is using Pantavision. I'm not sure which software that the other one looked like. One of the softwares that Hasdrubal had been using previously. This is, I'm pretty sure Fantavision here, which is a trickier software. But you see this guy go from not many muscles to many muscles, and this just beautiful loop that's a little glitched out, right? So waffles really able to take, again, the anatomy doesn't need to be perfect, but I have to say it's actually pretty good. You know, I would say it's surprisingly good. And just on that point, Basque, I think, I don't know if he studied anatomy, but he had Grey's anatomy, from what I remember.
00:15:49.234 - 00:16:20.060, Speaker A: Like, he was pretty. Like he knew his anatomy, as far as I understand. And I kind of get a similar sense here. I don't know if waffles is a brilliant and anatomist, so to speak, or has a ton of knowledge, but it's actually, you know, it does. Things do kind of work because when you don't know what you're doing, as many of us do, you know, maybe the elbow will be totally wrong and it'll be really out of shape. So all to say a hypnotizing piece and just exciting work. And so we begin here.
00:16:20.060 - 00:16:43.496, Speaker A: So today, Atlas Pop is going to be talking about with Runetoon, actually, who are both putting a show together in Brooklyn, their exhibition in New York, Brooklyn Crush, it is called. So that should be a ton of fun. And that is today. So I will retweet that out right after the show here. And that'll be in about 3 hours. Here we will begin. So check that out.
00:16:43.496 - 00:17:04.224, Speaker A: And it'll be pinned in the. It is pinned right now in the Twitter feed in my Twitter feed if you're looking for it. I also big thank you to NUV 1914. Check this out. Sent to me and my mom, a beautiful flamenco dancer. So my mom was thrilled. OMG.
00:17:04.224 - 00:17:32.994, Speaker A: And how beautiful is this? So what a delightful, beautiful act. And what a beautiful piece. So my mum was thrilled flamenco won, so now we have two flamenco works. So my mom's collection is getting larger here. I haven't set up a wallet for her, so just holding onto it for her. But thank you for sending that over. 1914, a beautiful work and my mum was absolutely thrilled.
00:17:32.994 - 00:17:50.984, Speaker A: So again, just thrilling. Thank you. Just a beautiful act. You know, we never know how long we're on this earth, so it's moments like this, like, that's just a beautiful thing to do. So I really appreciate it. Trad. Okay, so let's look at comments here.
00:17:50.984 - 00:18:11.388, Speaker A: Radda Yonke, speaking of death, we are, where is it we do art to not die, and we die a bit on each try. So interesting, enigmatic comment there from Rada. Always awesome to hear from you, Rada. Getting a few likes there. Bosque gratias. Always a pleasure to take a coffee with our friend Adrian. Indeed.
00:18:11.388 - 00:18:24.874, Speaker A: And likewise. And thank you. Bosque and just amazing things you're doing there in Argentina. Santiago Marquez, such kind words. Adrian, you're amazing. Thank you for all the support. My absolute pleasure.
00:18:24.874 - 00:19:05.896, Speaker A: Santiago and Tyler appreciate the show so much. I'm really enjoying how much it complicates received ideas about art craft, art making and art consumption. I I'm thrilled to hear that. It's a really nice thing to hear, Tyler. So I'm really, because it is complicated, because ultimately, we're talking about different kinds of value. We're talking about financial value, right? And that financial value is interestingly linked to the aesthetic value. And, you know, just speaking of cedar plank here, also known as Hysteruba waffles, like, you've seen the secondary say on object.
00:19:05.896 - 00:19:46.276, Speaker A: I haven't looked for a while, but it was actually, it was pretty, doing pretty well, where you'd have to spend one or 200 tezos for additions, right. Editions of five or whatnot. But interestingly, considering, I think the excitement that Waffles brings as an artist, it's actually a pretty, and not financial advice. It's pretty reasonable. I was thinking to myself earlier as I was drinking my coffee, it's a pretty reasonable secondary, considering how exciting this work is and relative to what, you know, what else is going for several ETH or whatnot. So it's all very interesting. And it's just a.
00:19:46.276 - 00:20:43.654, Speaker A: It's all together, it's all related, because let's just, just to wrap up this point here, the reason why it's so related, like this money and art, it hasn't, like if we go to the cave paintings, we would say, well, is it related? You would only say, well, you know, again, very distantly in the sense of, of course, there was no money back then, but they were trying to get food and maybe they were drawing in order to, again, perhaps a kind of sympathetic magic, if I had to guess. An incredible paintings, by the way, some of those, like 40,000 year old, 80,000 year old cave paintings. I mean, it's like, I think some people have called it like a Sistine chapel of sorts, like incredible. So. But I want to bring it to the Renaissance, though. It's always very important. And I thought a profound point, that the Medici were bankers.
00:20:43.654 - 00:21:31.772, Speaker A: They were basically enlightened bankers, to over generalize, because some of them were better actors than others, from what little I know of that. But they're basically bankers that bankrolled the Renaissance to a large degree, which was already underway, but really a catalyst. You know, you could argue with Giotto and Cimabue. The Renaissance really started Dante. Dante, as I kind of go deeper into the purgatorio and explore that work again, maybe the first encyclopedic work of literature, where it's just trying to incorporate everything. I'm trying to think of an antecedent. Right.
00:21:31.772 - 00:22:30.866, Speaker A: You know, it's kind of interesting. Can you think of a literary work which was kind of trying to incorporate so much of history into it? It may exist, and I just am not thinking of it. So again, you could argue that the Renaissance really was started, you know, with Dante, Giotto and Cimabue often thought of as medieval artists who got the ball rolling towards naturalism and really kind of. And beauty, again, this idea of appreciating beauty in a new way, that's kind of like you could argue back to our discussion on waffles. This idea of new ways of appreciating beauty, recognizing beauty, is actually where I'm trying to go with this new ways. It's recognizing beauty in new forms, in new mediums, in new ways of thinking. So, you know, art and civilization really are, at the core, very deeply related.
00:22:30.866 - 00:23:24.324, Speaker A: And back to this discussion here, which I've gone way too long on, has to do with value, values. Right. What is at the core of a civilization, right. These ways of appreciating beauty, what is morality. They are beautiful actions. They are actions that a society might consider beautiful, right? It's beautiful action. So this notion of beauty, we've talked about this before, many, many episodes ago, is kind of core, and there's a financial, and as that is valued, these expressions of beauty and the significance, meaning, as we kind of understand and come to recognize and appreciate certain kinds of deep meanings, that becomes more financially valuable as a cultural artifact of import, of importance, of significance.
00:23:24.324 - 00:23:55.868, Speaker A: Right? So then again, when we go back to waffles there, and if I'm right and we say, hey, this is kind of different and new, I've never seen anything quite like this. And then all of a sudden you go, well, that seems to have value. Right? This is doing things differently. This isn't just a meme to a certain degree. Cause a lot of the crypto kind of scene goes with memes. It's like, oh, well, whatever's memeing is kind of valuable, but, you know, but so there's different ways. This isn't simply a meme.
00:23:55.868 - 00:24:31.532, Speaker A: This is a kind of, is this pushing the envelope? That's the question I ask when I'm trying to determine know value, so to speak, in art. Is it pushing the aesthetic envelope? Are we doing something different here? Is this worth discussing or even considering? Or if I really like it, paying money for. So all to say, going long here, I am desperately trying to keep these shows shorter. There are far less tabs in this show. Pp universal. Thank you for the comment, Tyler. Hey, poco, muchas gracias for every, for, for everything, I believe is what that says.
00:24:31.532 - 00:25:03.634, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you, Pp. Sarah Kretschmer, thank you so much for answering my question regarding own versus listing work on object makes much more sense now. Okay, awesome. So kind of a classic kind of newbie question, which is, you know, how do I keep one? Right? And so, yeah, you list. And so you understand it now. So I'm super thrilled that you asked, Sarah, and I'm really glad to see you on here. And if you have any more questions, by all means, reach out or post another question in the group there.
00:25:03.634 - 00:25:37.288, Speaker A: Ratna, again, I'm with gogolitis. It looks pretty bad. Not following back a soul. So referring to the Tezos foundation, or I think just the Tezos account, not following anyone back. And we were saying how maybe it's like the Ethereum foundation, not following anybody because all of a sudden it creates a sense of centralization. But at the end of the day, people are starting these accounts. So it's an interesting tension and I sympathize with what you and gogolitis are saying, radha, very much k town cryptoking, keeping the Tezos nft art dream alive.
00:25:37.288 - 00:25:57.364, Speaker A: Kudos. Kudos from Penticton, BC. So totally cool here. Great to hear from a fellow canadian over in British Columbia and Vinnie Hager, awesome to hear from you as ever. Great to hear from you. Also, very quickly, comments here on the Twitter video here. Thank you again for the support.
00:25:57.364 - 00:26:30.422, Speaker A: Denise Sanchez, thank you. And Atlas Pop, who will be actually our special guest on today's show. I love you that you mentioned Dancontrol's latest work, fly as not cheap edition of 50 for ten tezos each when the equivalent cost to list on ETH would be free plus gas. That's the magic of tezos. So yeah, gas fees on ETH are off the charts, actually. They have improved a tiny bit it seems, in the last week or so. Just the ETH gas prices, like the gas, it's at like 24 oftentimes rather than like 89.
00:26:30.422 - 00:26:57.538, Speaker A: So I don't know if that's just people not using it as much or what. So all to say, yeah, the magic of Tezos indeed. So interesting. Thank you for the comment there, Lord Misfit Mutat mutatio was also done by neonglitch 86. He deserves the credit also, so thank you for pointing that out, actually, because I actually thought it was an X copy. I did mention neon glitch, but I didn't realize he was involved in the work. He's an artist you should really look into.
00:26:57.538 - 00:27:14.480, Speaker A: He has done incredible things in this space. You can also use fly in the metaverse, by the way, and I think we saw that in some of the galleries. Bullish on Santiago's work, who we started with there from Roerich. Always good to hear from you, retro Manny. Hot coffee ready. Thank you for the comment, Kels. Thanks for the mentions.
00:27:14.480 - 00:27:47.366, Speaker A: Great show. Amazing stuff on base with x copying xing. Mind blowing. Indeed it is, right? I mean, again, this is the digital art dream is you have like a million followers, let's say, and then you sell a work for a dollar each and you're a millionaire every time you sell a work. I mean, that's kind of the, that's why it's exciting to be on x, I think really it's that potential to have just like tens of thousands of followers, hundreds of thousands lotrips. Your hair is one big mega galaxy bound together by art. Yes, order and chaos, my friend.
00:27:47.366 - 00:28:11.086, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment. John Cates crash art market traditions crash art market traditions. Yes, well, yes. So interesting comments. So the traditions out of the, out of the, out of the traditional art world maybe should also be crashing, if I understand John Cates correctly. Thank you for the comment. Awesome to hear from such an awesome artist.
00:28:11.086 - 00:28:30.342, Speaker A: Lord misfit. Oh, you did mention him. Yes, so I did mention neon glitch, but thank you for pointing that out because I actually didn't realize that he was a part of the work. So, isoichi, thank you for the comment. And Allende, thank you for the comment. And thank you everybody, for posting here in the community. Again, for those that are wondering, you know, basically how to get on the show, this is the easiest way.
00:28:30.342 - 00:28:52.554, Speaker A: Basically, I check it every time I start the show here. And so, and it's just a cool way to get your work out there because other people will see it as you see here, you know, five likes, three likes. So other people see the work on here. And look at this. I mean, pretty awesome by Filippo Francocci. Happy Tuesday. And I try and go through it.
00:28:52.554 - 00:29:08.966, Speaker A: These are older works here. This looks like a software that Hasdrubal was using as well as someone else was using. I can't remember, maybe Kidpix. This kind of looks like Kidpik software. This was a cool work. P'nial gland. I was going to put it up, then I realized it was two years old, but thank you for posting it.
00:29:08.966 - 00:29:36.286, Speaker A: Anyway, just super interesting to discover your work. Sunyata Viru Paksa it's very interesting work 2002. Thank you for posting. And here is macrometry, looks like a mushroom done in hexadecimal or something. And another interesting experiment here done on Zora and, and this one we're going to see later in the show. So again, thank you everybody for posting. And just finally on.
00:29:36.286 - 00:30:01.086, Speaker A: So August ground was finally featured on the Pokebelly show just after Renki. And it's hilarious. Actually, that was accidental. But now I remember that August had purchased a really cool Renki work with the strobe there, a personal goal and dream. So thank you for that. And the reason I bring this up is John Thurmond put it out. And on the flip side, it feels, it hurts to feel excluded.
00:30:01.086 - 00:30:40.292, Speaker A: I think was referencing the show basically saying congratulations, but it sucks not being on. So I feel like I've had John Thurmond on the show, but maybe, yeah, so it's a tricky business here. This is why it's a journal in a sense, as far as rather than, you know, I call it a newspaper, the imagination. But it's not a news show, as I've said since the beginning of this show, because as I always say, it's kind of like just putting your hand out in the waterfall and collecting what's there. I can't possibly follow everything, but I made sure I am following you, John Thurman. And so I am paying attention. And again, the best way, if it's something you want to be on, then check it out.
00:30:40.292 - 00:31:06.340, Speaker A: The community there, just start posting stuff. Because then you put out a new work, or, you know, we'll work every two or three days. Whenever you're putting out of work, put it out. Maybe just one a day, but. Or, you know, one a week, whatever works for you. But ultimately, that's the best way. If that's something, because I can't follow everything, I'm one person, right? But ultimately.
00:31:06.340 - 00:31:22.256, Speaker A: But good to know. And I guess I mentioned that because there's probably a lot of people or some people that might feel that way. And again, I don't see everything. Like, I love showing Ed Marolla's work. I miss Ed Marolla's work oftentimes. Right. For example, here.
00:31:22.256 - 00:31:41.174, Speaker A: Right. So I'll just say, let me continue here, everybody. Thank you for the comments and the support. It means a ton as we continue to zoom through spring here. Ed Marolla, how do I art on bass manifold question mark. And so a few answers here. So brave was saying NFT dot coinbase.com
00:31:41.174 - 00:31:56.654, Speaker A: and I think I brought that up. So interesting. This got launched during the bull run. Wow. Bored apes at 13 ETH that has crashed. Wow. So lazy lions.
00:31:56.654 - 00:32:20.196, Speaker A: This is hilarious. And I don't mean to go on a tangent here as we enter the 32nd minute, like these things were going for $5,000. It's amazing actually, in 2021, these lazy lions. I mean, yeah, just hilarious, right? It's kind of amazing. They're going for 0.11 ETH, which is still $500. I mean, that's amazing.
00:32:20.196 - 00:32:50.358, Speaker A: Why aren't they worth zero? You know, and maybe, I don't know. Obviously, I don't know what's going on with those projects and everything, but pretty interesting. Wow. So there's Suzuki 5.2. Those were at 20 ETH at one point, if I remember correctly, pudgy penguins were just at 20 ETH and now they have come down, but they've actually rocketed higher in the last year. Anyway, getting off topic here, but it looks like you can mint on Coinbase to Brave's point. Ed got it working.
00:32:50.358 - 00:33:12.826, Speaker A: You can also mint base on Zora. So that is interesting. I guess what you do is you just bridge over some ETH onto base is what you do. And then you can use manifold, you can use Coinbase here and it looks like you can use Zora. Always do double check everything here and. Yeah, and braindead. So it's kind of a thing right now.
00:33:12.826 - 00:33:47.684, Speaker A: We're going to see a couple of works actually that have been put on manifold. Manifold kind of. I kind of like manifold. I like the independence of manifold. But you never know as far as if there is a base, if there is a base airdrop, maybe Coinbase is not a terrible place to also put work because maybe they give you more tokens. Who knows if there is even an airdrop. But as we see in airdrops can be lucrative in this business, as we saw with optimism just recently, Zach from Zora build on our Zora get funded.
00:33:47.684 - 00:34:16.748, Speaker A: Today we're introducing a new era of clarity for retrofunding. The collective has allocated a total of 850 million. Optimism, I mean, that's. Optimism is at $3 a coin, last I checked, 350, let's call it three. That's like two and a half billion dollars to incentivize impactful work across the optimism collective and the super chain. So not exactly so it sounds like it's a retro funding. Maybe they gave Zora a bunch of money.
00:34:16.748 - 00:34:40.739, Speaker A: I don't know. But that's a lot of money. That's billions of dollars, if I'm not mistaken. Like two and a half billion dollars. So optimism, you know, optimism is pretty impressive, I might add. Like, as far as using it, it's fast and it's cheap, so it is impressive. It seems like the most exciting L2, from my experience.
00:34:40.739 - 00:35:26.132, Speaker A: Jan Lucas Magoni just putting a work on Zora here. So the genesis, so moving, or adding Zora going multi chain, which really interestingly, multi chain has become normalized. And the reason I say that is because when I started this show, you know, it's getting on two years in August, it'll be two years. That was not the case. You know, there is very much an ETH centric and a Tezo centric world, and maybe a solana centric. And for artists I remember, to move from tazos to ETH was kind of a big deal. It's something I've always advocated to go multi chain for the obvious reasons.
00:35:26.132 - 00:35:52.604, Speaker A: There are collectors, different collectors on different chains. There's, you know, with, you know, it's just, it's hedging, it's, it's diversifying. It's. It's just good business management of yourself as an artist as, as a business, art as a business. So, so this is cool. So it'll be really interesting, actually, to see how Jan Lucas Migon does. Has a wonderful following, very, you know, big following there.
00:35:52.604 - 00:36:27.028, Speaker A: So all to say, pretty cool. Anzora, Mikey de la creme, you can fud the blockchain and its indifferent leadership, referring to Tezos, but you can't fud the culture exposing who's really in it for the art since 21. So. And I agree. And exactly, you know, at the end of the day, there's a great scene on Tezos and it continues. It's been a very resilient scene, I would maintain. And, you know, and there's some great art on it, as we all know, some of the most exciting art.
00:36:27.028 - 00:36:56.262, Speaker A: So. But I'm thrilled, I have to say, that things are multi chain and that, you know, something like base comes out and everybody's basically, hey, let's try out base. I think this is smart. I think it's healthy, because you don't want everything on one chain, and then all of a sudden, who's running that chain, because a lot of these things claim to be centralized and are not right. So, you know, depending on, in different measures, in different chains. Referring to the market, I believe here, cider. Two sales today.
00:36:56.262 - 00:37:19.880, Speaker A: Nah, it's not over. Socider has been doing very, very well, making several $2,000 sales, and it looks like making two sales yesterday. So cider has done fantastic. Cyber mystic Marcelo Pinel. Today I celebrate three years in this space. I think someone who started on tasos, to be honest, I've come further than I imagined. I've never been a very ambitious person or wanted to be famous.
00:37:19.880 - 00:37:46.396, Speaker A: The greatest joy I've had as an artist is to be able to work with my art, my research and experiments. And seeing it resonate with people. Seeing people from all over the world touched by your art is priceless and there is no way to buy it. Indeed. And isn't it exciting? You know, this is a very important point here. From all over the world, touched by your art. Being able to provide a decent life for my family and work exclusively with art is a privilege.
00:37:46.396 - 00:38:25.424, Speaker A: Perhaps it's the best job in the world. Thank you very much to all the friends and collectors. You're a part of this story, and each of you gave a brick to build the dream of a brazilian artist and supports their family. I don't know where this adventure will lead. Everything changes so quickly here but I'm pleased to be with you on this journey. I love you and this space. So we've discussed this before where the, you know, the really, interestingly, like, in a sense, traditionally, it was always like, oh, you want to go to New York or London or Paris in order to pursue your art dream? La, maybe Hong Kong, I don't know.
00:38:25.424 - 00:39:21.958, Speaker A: And now it's kind of like, if you actually want to pursue your art dream, maybe it's like places like Brazil and Argentina, where you can actually live, where costs are a little bit cheaper than in the west, where you can actually live off of your art. Because, like, would Marcelo Pinel be able to live off the art if he lived in Paris? You know, so interesting question. I think Marcello is a he, and I think this is actually just the translation here, but I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I thought so. Open to correction there. So we've been seeing improps for a while here. Dev roadmap to launch. We've been seeing the remarkable textures and AI art that has been created using M props and just again, this incredible painterliness.
00:39:21.958 - 00:39:37.806, Speaker A: So it looks like it's going to open up here. Launch day is coming. Opening the floodgates to the improps platform. I think they're getting close to here. Our devs are hard at work building and implementing new and requested features. I think. Let me just show you here.
00:39:37.806 - 00:39:56.282, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going live. M prop subscriptions begin to go live March 28. So that is tomorrow. So if you're interested in improps, that's how you do it. Continuing on, pollution. So we heard about this. Very excited to announce our PFP collab with Daniel W.
00:39:56.282 - 00:40:35.684, Speaker A: Customize your avatar with a wide range of unique traits and attributes. So a PFP collection from Daniel W, which I think looks awesome. And this is done with poll the very ambitious meme coin here that has a hole that is doing things. Additional benefits and exclusive rewards for pull token holders. Adapt your PFP to match your evolving tastes and interests. So very cool to see what Paul is up to there with the pfps. Retro Manny Tazos Tuesday happy Tazos Tuesday Retro man website is coming, going to be taking the retro man experience beyond crypto, Twitter and NFT marketplaces.
00:40:35.684 - 00:41:35.000, Speaker A: Get ready. And this is another reason because I should be, I should be more present on Farcaster because the crypto scene is there. But I really love being apart. I don't necessarily want to stay in a bubble either. So I really like, it's really nice to be able to get outside of also the crypto bubble. I think it's really important, actually, as artists, that you don't necessarily want to be purely have all your, you know, put it this way. I mean, one way to look at it, some of the Elliot wave theory, financial investor speculator types, forecasters, they see a big, massive bear market in crypto in something like 20 late 2025, 2026, where the fifth wave, who knows? Right? But all to say, I thought that was an interesting thing because all we've seen in crypto really is basically to the moon and then with big kind of drops in between.
00:41:35.000 - 00:42:23.204, Speaker A: But really, it's been kind of a straight path where they're expecting a secular bear market, in other words, a multi year bear market crypto. So who knows? But all to say, from this kind of diversification business perspective, it's nice to be outside of the crypto bubble. That's why it's great. If you show in a gallery, you get your work in a museum as a digital artist. And to not have everything kind of based on this crypto scene, which has been, we have to also recognize, insanely generous. That is why it's the sheer amount of money that's in this scene that enables people like Marcelo Pinello to survive and many others and to actually get income from your art. It's revolutionary and should not be taken for granted.
00:42:23.204 - 00:42:53.604, Speaker A: And also use this as an opportunity to also expand beyond crypto is sort of how I would put it. So all to say, check out this ad. Very cool. There's even what looks like a password and everything here. See if there's any volume. So looking pretty impressive from retro Manny, retro Man universe. And here, just another ad, the CD, I love it.
00:42:53.604 - 00:43:04.130, Speaker A: Hitting the gas. I love it. Kind of vaporwave colors. Beautiful. How are we doing? 43 minutes. I. Yes.
00:43:04.130 - 00:43:29.014, Speaker A: And this was sent to me also. This was sent to me from, I think it was Leros Loras here. Loras. Just since we were on the Brooklyn exhibit here. Theres also one in Brooklyn here capturing post photography Thursday, April 4. So around the same time as the exhibit that runetoon and Atlas pop are doing. So that is kind of cool.
00:43:29.014 - 00:43:52.986, Speaker A: So maybe you can see them both. So I'll just say the waitlist is done. But just a FYI, as we move into the pieces here, here is Martin Bruce with another radical work here. A ton of radical work as we began this show with. And here you see these. Look at this. These kind of fuzzy dogs made of little strange dots.
00:43:52.986 - 00:44:31.314, Speaker A: And look at all this wild mark making kind of looks like the trace is being used from adobe illustrator, perhaps. And then here, though, mixed with maybe some photography, all looking like it's within the context of a old Mac with this radical mark making here. Again, it's back to this idea of pushing the aesthetic frontiers here that so all very interesting. Look at this. I mean, at the bottom here. I mean, what I mean, the decisions that are going on here, really radical stuff. Super original.
00:44:31.314 - 00:44:51.680, Speaker A: Rebels without a cause. So great title there. That is 25 tazos edition of twelve from Martin Bruce. And also posting a work on super rare. I wasn't sure if I knew Martin Bruce was on super rare, has sold several works actually on super rare. Here's the new one. This is going for half an ETH.
00:44:51.680 - 00:45:18.644, Speaker A: Looks like mostly a physical painting here. And look at the plant. Look at the plant kind of mixing with the wall there with what looks like a painting of a plant, maybe. So, interesting piece as ever. Is that a CD or is that part of a bowl or a vase? And then interesting texture over here. Just an incredibly original artist. You see the snake coming out of this kind of plants over here.
00:45:18.644 - 00:45:42.866, Speaker A: Salt shaker snake. Just radical work by Martin Bruce. And here's another by Nuff 1914 Hatta. Kind of looking like a variation of a Disney type angel here. And so just another. Again, look at this, look at this gradient at the top here. And this beautifully done magic wand, an angel figure.
00:45:42.866 - 00:45:59.194, Speaker A: And again, this radical floor here. Just wild work. And we have a couple more from NUV 1914. This sold for twelve tezos. And this also sold for twelve tezos to Yuri J. Direction two. Again, just wild experimentation going on here.
00:45:59.194 - 00:46:23.908, Speaker A: Again, as I titled an earlier episode, pushing the aesthetic frontiers. Just, you know, that's what makes this space, I'd say, so exciting. There are so many different areas that can be explored. And as Marcelo put, I wanted to highlight that word researched. It's a kind of research, visual research here. Abrazos. So again, interesting.
00:46:23.908 - 00:46:48.944, Speaker A: Almost like a tree over here. And a couple with a baby. And maybe just some abstraction, some architecture, not sure. Addition of one, selling for twelve tezos to Vitteo. So nice work. So. And here we have bhuboy with an interesting textured piece here with buboy style, but done in black and white and almost this interesting texture underneath.
00:46:48.944 - 00:47:04.028, Speaker A: And is there a physical? Sometimes buboy will put a physical with it. No, my black and white art works. So this is just a digital selling for 0.19, Ethan. I mean, that's $600. Nice work. Look at this frame too.
00:47:04.028 - 00:47:24.844, Speaker A: We're looking at the frame in the early at in waffles work, this pink frame, it's very cool. Again, almost a frame here. Insiders work called now Pepe dispenser is now live. 29 of 42 editions available. So this is on BTC. So interesting. At 0042 BTC.
00:47:24.844 - 00:47:45.190, Speaker A: And then very interesting. So if you sold all of these, what would that turn into? I maybe 0.4, if I'm not mistaken. Or would it simply be. I'm not sure. All to say, very cool. And cider is on fire, so I'm not sure if it's sold out or not.
00:47:45.190 - 00:48:07.274, Speaker A: If not, you can look on bitcoin for this call now, Pepe. I wish there was a link. I wish there was a link so we could actually see where that was from. I'm not sure if we looked at this. I think we did. I know we looked at the preview, but I don't remember seeing like this cowboy here. So I bring it back up and I don't remember looking so closely at this laptop.
00:48:07.274 - 00:48:23.634, Speaker A: We saw this as a work in progress, of course. This is Yuri J. And here we have another just beautiful room. And there's a net. And again, this bunk bed. I think we had a close up like this where Yuri Jay was saying, you're not ready for this. Indeed.
00:48:23.634 - 00:48:47.856, Speaker A: And look at this frame. Almost a frame. This is the roof, actually, of the room and the piano in the corner, again, with a laptop here, plugged in. Very contemporary work. Again, pushing the aesthetic frontiers, as I keep saying here. That is why digital is so exciting. I mean, why are we here instead of, you know, with physical painting? A, there is an economic reason.
00:48:47.856 - 00:49:54.874, Speaker A: It costs almost nothing to make and you can sell it for pretty nice prices. So there is that. But it's also new, it's fresh, it's the art of now, you know? And so even when I make, say, physical artwork, which isn't that common right now, but when I do, it's always with the digital in mind, and how am I going to make this physical work new, incorporating digital thinking and making a work that is physical, that could never be made pre digital, you know, that is part of the mindset, at least for me. I mean, again, people make art for different reasons, but that's part of what goes into the equation for me personally, as I continue to write my visual journal here live, improvising with you, my friends, over coffee or tea or whatever your drink of choice is. Here's gloomTube, as we continue to run here, a very interesting piece here by Gloomtube, continuing with the depth of field kind of photography thing going with the plants here. And then just interesting. Almost a, that looks like a moldy either piece of cheese or bun.
00:49:54.874 - 00:50:10.174, Speaker A: And then some candy. And so some very modern imagery here. A knife to give it some edge, another moldy orange. And some processed food here. French bread. Pepperoni. Yes, indeed.
00:50:10.174 - 00:50:23.034, Speaker A: Danger. Danger, indeed. Stouffers. And there is the cord. So kind of a mysterious work. It has a little bit of a feeling of a dally still life. You know that still life.
00:50:23.034 - 00:50:50.214, Speaker A: Let's see if I can very quickly bring it up. The beauty of not having as many tabs is I can actually do stuff like this. Dally still life. Knife, water, probably a lot of, you know the one I'm thinking of. Yeah, this one here. You know, this still life here, 356. Do we have a larger version here? You see how different they all are.
00:50:50.214 - 00:51:26.430, Speaker A: But you see here, you know what, the Internet's getting kind of sad how you can't even find, because of all the copyright police, you can't even find a decent size. Here's 900 pixels. Maybe we go with this one. Let's see here. So, okay, this is pretty good, kind of, you know, this still life with almost that's animated. This ensouled still life, you know, this moving on its own kind of objects. Right? The anima, right? So interesting in this wonderful kind of cosmic perspective there.
00:51:26.430 - 00:52:02.016, Speaker A: And, of course, a heavy erotic theme here with Dali as ever, you know, kind of a similar kind of vibe, like in the sense that this almost feels like a face here on this light on this extension cord, which seems to have life, this, even this little rag here. There seems to be life in this, in this still life here. Concealment and convenience. So edition of one for 90 tezos from Gloomtube. Interesting piece. This is from Melia. Interesting piece here.
00:52:02.016 - 00:52:23.472, Speaker A: Just posted on X. And look at the heart. So again, trying to bring in new artists when I see them. Really cool work here. Kind of old cell phone. Just kind of a wild work. I assume this is digital, but a really just kind of fun juxtaposition of different objects and everything.
00:52:23.472 - 00:52:51.744, Speaker A: So there's one from Laia pinned on her ex feed profile. And here's geek Kells meets geek. Kind of a nice painterly work here. It almost looks physical, doesn't it? But I think. Or is it physical? It's actually getting hard to tell, isn't it? Look at that little surveillance camera there. Very hard to tell if this is physical. Do we have a clue? This is one of my first paintings that I truly like with different technique.
00:52:51.744 - 00:53:21.444, Speaker A: This piece, it's meaningful for me. So this is actually a painting. It really has geek style to it, doesn't it? So very cool. So again, it's very interesting to see digital artists working physically because they're going to bring something different to the table. This is a composition that is from someone who's probably used to making compositions digitally and even just working and mark making digitally. So then they go back to painting. So interesting.
00:53:21.444 - 00:53:42.676, Speaker A: Very carefully and nicely painted work there by geek. Kells meets geek. And that is eight tazos. Continuing on, we have one from Lord Neutron, a one of one. This is on foundation and this is available for 0.1 ETH. So I think pretty reasonable price for a Lord neutron work.
00:53:42.676 - 00:54:23.806, Speaker A: And just another kind of wild work here with the skeleton. Again, I'm never sure how Lord Neutron makes their works. What's so interesting about neutron's work is the different kinds of mark making. Like here you see a certain kind of mark making like a spray, kind of soft shadow here you see, you know, maybe we can bring this bigger just quickly here, you know, here you see like texture and kind of a hard outline. And again just different kinds of mark making. Like I'm always back to. I have no idea how this was used, what was used and everything.
00:54:23.806 - 00:54:48.856, Speaker A: So again we're kind of back to this idea of new visual experiences. Also the name of a former show we've done here. This is also. That is kind of what I'm getting, these kind of new aesthetic experiences, new visual experiences. So beautiful work from Lord Neutron on Foundation. Here's, I think a work in progress, I'm not sure from limbo because usually they're animated. This could work on its own just as a still life here.
00:54:48.856 - 00:55:06.832, Speaker A: An interesting start game. So almost looks like a video game inspired work and classic, you know, almost eyes in the sky from limbo here. And here's a mansion. Again, almost looking like the beginning of a video game. So cool work. Look at that. 224 likes, 47 retweets.
00:55:06.832 - 00:55:35.344, Speaker A: Great job by limbo. Cush keeper. So this is from an artist I hadn't seen before either. No, easy. So just an interesting illustration here. Kind of psychedelic, kind of contemporary here with the cold storage wallet and for crypto. And here's smoking something and interesting, kind of colored, you know, almost like that work we started with, with the green smoke on the cigarette there and everything.
00:55:35.344 - 00:55:55.816, Speaker A: So just an interesting work here. Again, kind of retro phone, retro cell phone machine gun. So this is an edition of twelve for ten tezos each and already six gone. Interesting. So nice piece there. Burka Bayram waiting for Godot. Is this new? March 26, 2024.
00:55:55.816 - 00:56:27.454, Speaker A: Cool. So Birka Bayram does a treatment of waiting for Godot. How fun is that? And just classic, beautiful work here, as we see. And I believe these are digital, right? And so just classic Burka Bayram style treating a literary, treating a famous book. Kind of hard to watch, hard to read. It's kind of notoriously boring, but that's kind of part of the joy, I guess, of Samuel Beckett's waiting for Godot. Kind of part of the point.
00:56:27.454 - 00:57:02.538, Speaker A: So it's kind of one of those interesting avant garde works, isn't it? Kind of a great idea. It's interesting, though. How enjoyable would you want to see a play of waiting for Godot for those that have read it? It's an interesting, interesting question. Would you find it as funny as it's trying to be? You know, it's interesting to think of how these works are standing the test of time. Is it kind of too full of itself as an artwork? Is it not as funny as it's trying to be? Or is it. I'd have to revisit. I haven't read it in 15 years.
00:57:02.538 - 00:57:17.762, Speaker A: Interesting question. Daniel W. The night watchman. So continuing this corporate dungeon series and looks like something is happening in this kind of print inspired work here. Digital artwork, of course. Daniel W. I believe out of Brazil.
00:57:17.762 - 00:57:48.808, Speaker A: Is this hell? Are we in hell? So kind of, and kind of a haunted horror work. And look at that. Look who is waiting at the top there. Cool work. Nice frame there and everything for Tezos edition of 18 and selling multiple copies there on object here is blue retina, serpentic serpent, serpenticon. So of course, blue retina, well known for using this blue and even this kind of orange and yellow. So cool work here.
00:57:48.808 - 00:58:23.524, Speaker A: This is on base, interestingly. And it almost looks like kind of a snake like figure here made of these spheres. It's kind of Sci-Fi here, kind of in nature, kind of painterly, as you see here. So just a nice textured painterly work here from blue retina and already 17 minted. And again, this is on base, based on a true fairy tale to celebrate base minting season. So again, seems using manifold and again, seems worthwhile to put one of these out. The hype's there right now.
00:58:23.524 - 00:58:45.428, Speaker A: It kind of reminds me of when everybody was doing the open editions on manifold. Like what was that a year? And like it was in January a year over a year ago. And that was kind of all the rage kind of reminds me of that. So all pretty cool. Mumble boy, look at me. Look at you. So here, just an interesting piece by mumble boy.
00:58:45.428 - 00:59:19.104, Speaker A: Kind of looking representational of two figures here, really originally done. And of course, as we saw with Mumble Boy, using physical and digital in combination, going back and forth, as far as I understand, and creating these incredibly original works, as you see, a very digital gradient here as we go down, just very interesting work. Again, this is eight Tezos edition of two. And here is lxtxcx. And this was bought by Somfei for 21 Tezos edition of one. Desktop nightmare. So, of course, we recognize this artist's style.
00:59:19.104 - 00:59:51.978, Speaker A: Kind of a print feeling to the whole work and just really cool kind of artwork, isn't it? As we zoom out here, kind of a window and kind of a reference to computers here. Desktop nightmare. So interesting play on desktop and kind of vaguely, again, feels like a computer desktop. And even here, these little arrows give the sense of some sort of media player or something. So interesting work there. Kind of ambiguous, poetic. This is Etkin Sapphire.
00:59:51.978 - 01:00:22.414, Speaker A: Just a cool work here. Edition of one, selling for 20 tezos. Just a beautiful, serene artwork. Is that what it's called? Sapphire is the name of the artwork. So as you see here, just a palm tree with like a classical arch here, or almost like a triumph style thing, but actually just modern architecture, but with reference to the old. And just on a sea with a pool here, kind of vaporwave colors. Just beautiful work here is retro, Manny, retro man cutscene.
01:00:22.414 - 01:01:07.048, Speaker A: Welcome to Orion. So let's get this going. So it's going somewhere, this whole project. Beautiful audio, if you can hear that. Kind of serene, isn't it? Kind of wonderfully serene. Orion starbase with almost what looks like Sanskrit there. I took first year Sanskrit.
01:01:07.048 - 01:01:16.944, Speaker A: I used to be able to at least sound the letters. So interesting. Retro man cutscene. Welcome to Orion. That is sold out. Nice work. Or transferred.
01:01:16.944 - 01:01:26.594, Speaker A: Transferred over to probably previous collectors. Nice work. Retro Manny. Kyle Flemmer. Another interesting piece. Nebulae. Just fix the mic here.
01:01:26.594 - 01:01:37.206, Speaker A: Carefully fix the mic. Nebulae. N a p E l. North America. Pelican. So interesting. So what this looks like, right? Let's just.
01:01:37.206 - 01:02:02.712, Speaker A: Oh, we can't zoom in any more than this. You know, this looks like the tiles. This looks like Kyle Flemmer is using the tile making kind of function in aspirite and making cool, making Kyle's own tiles and then kind of creating these. Interesting. Like here, it's North America. It kind of looks like a constellation, but different but it's a map. It's kind of ambiguous.
01:02:02.712 - 01:02:20.584, Speaker A: Very interesting work. And selling to solar bones for seven tezos edition of five series one. Pretty cool. Here's another work on bass. Who is this? I'm not sure who the account is. I found it on x and then I clicked the link. Total minted two.
01:02:20.584 - 01:02:36.868, Speaker A: Now, is this on base? Yes, it is. As you can see here. So selling two already at 0.01. So not an insignificant price there. And so, cool work on base. Interesting artist. I wish I knew the name.
01:02:36.868 - 01:02:55.312, Speaker A: Symphony in pixels. Here's gogolitis. Here's a snippet of a piece I've been working on diligently these past few days. This looks pretty rad. Go go Litis in color continues to turn the head here. Pretty excited to see. And this is just like a small fragment of that work.
01:02:55.312 - 01:03:16.366, Speaker A: Just gorgeous. It's gorgeous. So, pixel art going somewhere here, do you art here is Renato Marini. Kind of cool retro desktop icons here, cool pixelation, really fun. Kind of retro rainbow gradient at the bottom. Interesting framing. Just a nice piece.
01:03:16.366 - 01:03:36.614, Speaker A: Do art edition of one. And that has been minted but not listed. Interestingly, here's element Li is. I'm going to speed through this again. Here's element li doing another really interesting piece here. A house where you can kind of see through the roof. Kind of architectural.
01:03:36.614 - 01:03:56.470, Speaker A: And then here, just again, almost like doodling on the side. So. And again, kind of that video game perspective here a little bit. And here, the tree, just kind of half finished. Just beautiful minimal color. Here's a very minimal one. Park, you know, almost very impressionistic.
01:03:56.470 - 01:04:16.264, Speaker A: Not worrying about things making sense too much. Just beautiful typography and calligraphy. Inspired, interestingly. Yeah, you kind of see it here as well as here. So cool experimentation from element ly. Here's stippin pixel, just posting this on x crossover March 28 in Zora. So more cats are coming.
01:04:16.264 - 01:04:44.514, Speaker A: And again, you see that beautiful kind of four on the floor pixelation here from stippin pixel. And again, the cats coming in. So working on a new piece, it looks like. And here's Ed Morolla functus, which is part of the they are dreaming us series. This is only a Tezos edition of 51. And here you see what looks like a magician or doctor working on a massive machine with what looks like a kind of a city underneath. Hard to say.
01:04:44.514 - 01:05:01.008, Speaker A: Or geometric shapes. And look at that frame. These digital frames are so interesting, aren't they? So look at that. So beautiful color there, too. Almost like a golden yellow there. So again. And several.
01:05:01.008 - 01:05:13.704, Speaker A: How many are left here? 14 left. So selling. So nice. So selling 36. Kristin Roos on object, RGB IV boxes. And four sold at 20 tezos here. Edition of 20.
01:05:13.704 - 01:05:33.728, Speaker A: And so interesting, you know, again, vintage software, as Kristin Russoud put it, a gif. And this just came out. So again, 20 tezos each on object. Here's a cool one from Francois Gamma. Interesting walking person here. New variation on it. And there's another beautiful work here.
01:05:33.728 - 01:05:54.860, Speaker A: Syntax error, not visible label edition of 40. And this was put on object. Very cool work. Again, incorporating almost like this old programming language. Looks like basic or something. With a very cool abstraction here. Very cool work from false was gamma.
01:05:54.860 - 01:06:15.744, Speaker A: Here's popple with the new work. Number four, Nakamura sisters night sampling. This is 16 tezos edition of 25. And there are five left. Get it while you can. So here is the work. And again, using basically black and white pixel art and what looks like some generative art, a little bit for some of these animations here.
01:06:15.744 - 01:06:40.216, Speaker A: So just another really cool work, a, with this series, almost a sailor moon type outfit. And you wonder, you know, this almost looks like a simultaneous narrative. What you see in Renaissance paintings, where the. You'll see St. Peter twice, famously, and I can't remember the name of the artist always escapes me. But this almost looks like the same character here. Right? And that's.
01:06:40.216 - 01:07:09.564, Speaker A: Again, you see that in early and sometimes not so early Renaissance paintings, where it's like different parts of the story. Doesn't it look like that? Or maybe it's two separate people. They're sisters. Okay, so this is not simultaneous narrative. The Nakamura sisters, Katie and Anzu, ventured back to their half demolished old apartment to retrieve the secret meat infused miso juice for the special school lunch party. So pretty cool. And just rad artwork from popple, as usual.
01:07:09.564 - 01:07:27.696, Speaker A: Here's Kappan on 0.01 ETH on Zora. Two minted. So far, so nice work from Kappn. And again, this was on Zora. And is this using base? I'm not sure. So probably on Zora.
01:07:27.696 - 01:07:38.818, Speaker A: So cool work there. Synapse two. Just a nice abstract. See if we can make that slightly bigger. That is the full size. Continuing on brawn with a really cool piece. Look at this.
01:07:38.818 - 01:07:51.262, Speaker A: Not mono number one. So cool. The black and white looks pretty static. And then the color is dynamic or moving. Nice combination. Kind of nice. Minimally done here.
01:07:51.262 - 01:08:14.546, Speaker A: Nice effect from Braun. So cool variation on the abstracts. That's an edition of one, still available for 15 tezos. Look at Nicholas Sassoon cabin. These gorgeous landscapes here done by Nicholas Sassoon. So just beautiful, kind of cycling colors. Who knows how Nicholas Sassoon makes this? Almost looks like woven, doesn't it? But I believe all pixel.
01:08:14.546 - 01:08:32.954, Speaker A: And just another beautiful nature work here is wok. And this sold to Lucca for 420. And this is a one of one called Moby Dick. So part of this marijuana plant series from Wok. This is edition of one. And here is Santiago Ruau. Random work.
01:08:32.954 - 01:08:57.492, Speaker A: So nice variation on the whole abstract series here, playing with these shapes and everything. Totally recognizable, but totally different and totally different colors. Again, this framing is really kind of grabbing my attention, this digital framing, because it does add to the work. Right. And Frada two and 13, minted so far. Open mint. And here's feels.
01:08:57.492 - 01:09:27.462, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this is new or not getting a nice start there. And look at this. So just a very cool work by feels. Who you can find a lot of their older work on object. And here's Koda Nakazono with another new work here, CVZ number four, as you see here. I think they're pretty big files, if I'm not mistaken, because they take a little while to load. And interestingly, this kind of red liquid area is static with the rest moving.
01:09:27.462 - 01:09:49.474, Speaker A: Kind of a psychedelic movement there for tezos. And that is an addition of ten, one left. And that actually looks like on secondary LB glitch exercise. So cool work here by lb kind of looks. Again, the popular exercise video theme with the video glitch artist. Nice glitch here. Kind of a different take with these kind of cubes here.
01:09:49.474 - 01:10:00.540, Speaker A: Very nice edition of eleven five tezos. And just listed here's Klaus. Cool, big pixelation. Composition number 173. Great color. Continuing. Look at this.
01:10:00.540 - 01:10:25.264, Speaker A: Beautiful violet, dark, almost desaturated violet in the black background, you know, contrasting with the saturated there. Again, these nice huge moving pixels. Beautiful work. 21 tezos. Here's Renki with a couple here. Continuing this kind of wild series that we've been looking at. Really cool, just very solid, you know, everyday putting out an artwork here.
01:10:25.264 - 01:10:51.272, Speaker A: So we have a couple. This one's red and just minted and not worrying about listing them, interestingly. I mean, that's a whole other strategy that is possible. Like, let's say you're super bullish on your art and the long term, and this space sticking around, maybe you don't even want to sell it. I mean, I think a lot of us have actually had that thought. It's sort of like, I don't need to sell this maybe I'll just mint it and not worry about it. I don't need to do it necessarily for the money.
01:10:51.272 - 01:11:08.180, Speaker A: You might think to yourself, right? So here's another one. Yukui edition of one. And let me speed through this. I really want to shorten these shows here. So again, using blue here. And here's a cool work by Sky Goodman on Zora. So my feed in Zora is starting to populate with people I follow.
01:11:08.180 - 01:11:19.756, Speaker A: So that is awesome. So look at this. So this is on Zora. Cool variation here from Sky Goodman. A sneaker air force one psychedelic colorway. Look at how great that all looks. Just a nice product.
01:11:19.756 - 01:11:37.620, Speaker A: 159. Minted. Great job by Sky Goodman here, who I am working to get on the program once sky is a little less. Wednesdays are tricky for sky. This is the reason parsimostogi. Look at this on Instagram. So look at this CGI.
01:11:37.620 - 01:11:59.688, Speaker A: I mean, this looks like a real sculpture, right? I wonder how hard it would be to turn this into a GLB. Just out of curiosity. Maybe it is, but CGI 8100 x 6480. I mean, really high res, very convincing. Looks photographic, doesn't it? And Islay, with a couple of more gorgeous works here. AI works tableau verdun. Not sure what that means.
01:11:59.688 - 01:12:21.956, Speaker A: Minted for the Tezos art vending machine Lume studios event. Again, I think this is using, if I'm not mistaken, m props, where you get these incredible, you know, brushwork. This incredible brushwork here. So nice composition here. I think Matisse and Gauguin would love these. Here's another one. Look at this.
01:12:21.956 - 01:12:55.284, Speaker A: This wild table here and this great plants in the background underneath. Interesting color, beautifully painted. Again, a whole other strategy. As you make these works, you don't release the AI, and then you basically use this as a source for a painting, because I'm kind of back to this idea. If you started making paintings like this and then you didn't show the source, I mean, it would be kind of like, wow. We see AI, and we go, okay. We're used to, you know, really interesting, beautiful looking works coming from AI, and we go, that's nice.
01:12:55.284 - 01:13:10.730, Speaker A: Pretty good. Pretty good, right? But you see it as a painting. Then all of a sudden, it's like, you'd be like, how did this person. How did this person do this? Anyways, beautiful work here from Ilay A. A provocative work. Provokes discussion. Looks sold out edition of one.
01:13:10.730 - 01:13:27.122, Speaker A: And that was in the Tez vending machine. Here's Santiago with another, I believe, AI artwork. This must be AI and, of course, I follow Santiago. So beautiful work here, isn't it? Looks like an AI artwork. So just another beautiful AI painting. Here's Moe. Shit.
01:13:27.122 - 01:14:01.450, Speaker A: The nathig, the nothig, 50 tazos. So again, playing with the plane, with the textiles, and cool, kind of almost a medieval scene here. Wild, wild AI artwork here. Again, you turn this into a little drawing, burn the AI work, you know, it's like you get rid of the ladder after you climb up, you know. Here's Lily Illo. I thought this was a really nice piece here. A really interesting variation on the chairs here.
01:14:01.450 - 01:14:23.700, Speaker A: There's a lot of chairs. And we have the white on white. Super original and interesting from Lily Illo as we go into the physicals here. Barabin positive plane. Look at how great this looks. A two paper, so nice size airbrush, oil, pastel and acrylic. Very nice painting here, isn't it? Plain, made of happy faces.
01:14:23.700 - 01:14:52.874, Speaker A: I love this piece. Again, this airbrush style. Very exciting airbrush, oil, pastel and acrylic. Now, we've been looking at this artist, Adam Lister, Arnold Laffini portrait. So of course, we recognize this work from the Renaissance. Is it Van Eyck? I believe. And so, all to say, a beautiful, large homage there.
01:14:52.874 - 01:15:29.670, Speaker A: Here's Alison Gray, interestingly original art spring auction. And so this is to support their cosmic project there, I think, in northern New York, New York state. And so playing with this isemic writing is one of her main themes is kind of psychedelic letters, watercolor. Nice piece. And there's Alison Gray at the bottom there. This is a very popular Instagram account. Mary Lynn Buchanan, she also has a YouTube where, if you're interested, she goes to New York art shows.
01:15:29.670 - 01:15:51.026, Speaker A: It's actually a pretty useful YouTube. Nice find here, isn't it? Look at this wild painting here, these big canvases. Really nice piece. Kind of original. You see how hard it is to be original, I would argue, in painting. I mean, people are doing it to people's credit, but I'd say the low hanging fruit is in digital right now. But this is beautiful.
01:15:51.026 - 01:16:09.108, Speaker A: I mean, there's no question. Like, very interesting. A quadriptic made up of four, seven foot by five foot canvases. Who is the artist? They're part of Mary Lovelace O'Neill's current exhibit at Marion Boesky Gallery. So pretty nice. This is. So it's not gallery who.
01:16:09.108 - 01:16:32.556, Speaker A: We love to show their posts here. William Dark Drac. And just an interesting coinbase visa card. Wild, wild, wild work here from a content perspective. And again, more airbrush right. So it's really interesting, this trend with airbrush painting here. And again, not worrying too much about what's going on with the hand and everything.
01:16:32.556 - 01:17:04.604, Speaker A: Like, again, pushing aesthetic, creating new aesthetics really is what we're getting down to here. Bondozo bandito account. When you grow up, there's no God, there's no evil. I thought just a radical juxtaposition of artwork here, kind of reminiscent of Warhol a little bit using the projector, right, of the late Warhol, where we had the, I think the Virgin Mary there, Raphael Mary. And just an interesting looks. This looks like it's from a kid's book. And here's the Bondozo Bandido character.
01:17:04.604 - 01:17:22.794, Speaker A: And what is it? Okay, 210 by 200 cm. Nice work here. Junwu Park. I think it was maybe Renny Fish had shared this in the stories. And I thought, wow, this is amazing. So just interesting kind of wild artwork here. Again, provocative.
01:17:22.794 - 01:17:41.598, Speaker A: Pushing the aesthetic limits again. And one more here. This is walk with a beautiful kind of emoji here. Just expertly, masterfully done as ever, as I keep saying here, so beautiful work by walk post. It looks like it's on a canvas or a piece of paper. Oh, look at those. Beautiful.
01:17:41.598 - 01:17:56.852, Speaker A: Just down here. Just brilliant, as usual. And that is your show, my friends. How are we doing? Hour 17. I'm going to get it below an hour next good Friday. I'm really, actually going to make it. I'm going to do an experiment in a short show, maybe to everybody's or most people's happiness here.
01:17:56.852 - 01:17:59.364, Speaker A: Thank you for joining me once again. Until next time, take care.
