00:00:06.080 - 00:00:50.645, Speaker A: It continues this time in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The second broadcast. I'm trying not to scream too much into my microphone as I like to do in courtesy and thinking of the neighbors here. So welcome back, artist journal, August 19, 2024, broadcasting from Buenos Aires, Argentina. My name is Adrian Pocabelli and here we are, the first show after the two year anniversary, which I believe is August 12th. And I'd say the August 10th when we did the Neutro art show, which many of you saw, maybe on Twitter, at least the posts that. And Neutro posted it on their YouTube as well.
00:00:50.645 - 00:01:37.655, Speaker A: That to me was the kind of two year anniversary party. So it was kind of beautiful. And I just was thinking to myself, you know, talking, you know, waking up and talking to my computer and hitting the record button. And then, you know, here I am two years later in a continent I've never actually, I guess I went to Brazil two months ago, but to a country I've never been to, to a continent I've barely been to, South America in the Southern hemisphere, where I've never been. You know, I've been pretty kind of west centric in my travels. So this is quite, you know, there's Brazil two months ago and there's Argentina now. And it's all just kind of amazing to me when you abstract everything, which is what we're going to see in this Ed Morola work.
00:01:37.655 - 00:02:20.789, Speaker A: You know, just waking up and talking to this screen here, here I am. Had I not talked to my, you know, this piece of metal and plastic and microchips, I would not be in this interesting country right now. So it's all quite interesting to me. Kind of surreal and exciting. So with that, let me just, first of all, before we start, just give a huge thank you and we're going to look at it in a second here. To the Neutro crew, to Bulls, Santiago Santi and the whole neutro crew, all 200 of them that put on that massive show last a week from Saturday, so about nine days ago. And then also we did a.
00:02:20.789 - 00:02:49.525, Speaker A: I did a presentation, second Generation of Digital Art with some other amazing presenters, including Bolz this Saturday. So a true honor here and just want to say a big thank you and shout out to everybody who helped put it on and who. Very professional. The AV people are super professional. And just everybody who showed up. And this is by far the friendliest country I've ever been to. If you've never been to Argentina, you have to go.
00:02:49.525 - 00:03:11.939, Speaker A: And I look forward to coming back in their summer of Course, it's winter here, which is another surreal aspect. I do feel like I'm living in a dream kind of half the time here. I don't know what's going on anymore. Anyways, with that, let's start with Ed Morola. There's a ton to get through here. There are so many works I could have started with. I decided to go with this one because I felt like it kind of captured the zeitgeist a little bit.
00:03:11.939 - 00:03:49.435, Speaker A: We build this together. And I don't know if Ed did that on purpose with all of the discussion of free mints and everything, but what I loved about this work, it almost takes like, imagine he did, and I don't know if he did, but it takes something particular and specific, like, say, an argument about a certain thing. And I'm just reading into it. Free mints, for example. And we'll get into that whole discussion, this episode, if you're not sure what I'm talking about here, but. And it abstracts it. It goes from the particular, the specific argument, and then to the universal.
00:03:49.435 - 00:04:38.957, Speaker A: Because what do you see here? You just basically see a whole bunch of humans in debate and talking and trying to figure things out and in discussion. It's quite brilliant, isn't it? If that is in fact what Ed has done, you know, taking this kind of specific thing and made it something that everybody can relate to. This could have been a scene from a thousand years ago, a thousand miles away, or, you know, you name it. This is something we've all experienced quite regularly here, actually. This is X, this is Twitter, this is social media. So, Ed, with a gorgeous work here. And another interesting thing that's going on here, we have to notice is how it looks like a kind of like a photo of a piece of paper.
00:04:38.957 - 00:05:13.605, Speaker A: You can even see the drop shadow here is the surface. Like you see the shadow there. So talk about traveling through the mediums here, you know, what is this, I assume? I think we can call it a digital artwork at the end of the day, but we didn't get there on digital means alone. Sure, even the camera may have been digital, if in fact this is a picture. But, you know, we needed a piece of paper, we needed a surface here, this frame of sorts. So very interesting work. And I just came.
00:05:13.605 - 00:05:37.943, Speaker A: There's a big John Baldassarre show at the. What is it called? The Latin, The Mabla. The Museum of Art of Buono's Museum of Art. Malba, I think, is what it's called. I'm not sure what the L stands for. In Malba at this moment. But fantastic John Baldazzari show, which was there, I just saw yesterday.
00:05:37.943 - 00:06:08.515, Speaker A: I can't wait to go back. Baldassarre, I'd almost forgotten, is basically, you know, if you asked me in 2017, 2018, who my favorite artist was, I would have probably. Probably said John Baldassarre. And so what a gift to come here and see a Baldassarre show. Oh, just the first big kind of Latin American survey in Latin America of Baldassarre's work. So that was fantastic. And speaking of traveling through the mediums.
00:06:08.515 - 00:06:39.605, Speaker A: So we'll have to return to that discussion of Baldassarre sometime very soon. An incredibly inspiring show. And thanks to everybody, actually, who brought me out to that show. So kind of a fun beginning here. There are so many works that could have started this show. Let's just look again at another work that Ed just recently put out here. And again, we're seeing these incredible textures, this very painterly work here, and these figures that have just been kind of cobbled together.
00:06:39.605 - 00:07:07.929, Speaker A: And again, we're almost in this kind of universal situation where, you know, people talking and then showing a skull and, you know, maybe this is kind of a devil figure. Maybe it's a priest who knows. People looking at death and thinking about it. Another very universal subject here. Next in line for Before Forever, For Noon and for no one. Very poetic work here. As we've.
00:07:07.929 - 00:07:30.965, Speaker A: I've become very used to. As we all, I think, have become used to in this scene. And wait till you see the works in this show. And just a quick apology in advance. I'm going to move pretty quickly here because there's too much to go through. And I actually have a pretty hard deadline here in maybe an hour and 15, but let's see what we can do. I could probably stretch it, but let's try and get this done fast.
00:07:30.965 - 00:08:00.235, Speaker A: This is what happened last Saturday. That is the biggest group hug I've ever had. So, again, there's Bowles there, Santee and everybody, all these wonderful people. Santiago, that's the Neutro crew. And what an incredible experience that was. And again, the AV people, it was just amazing what they did and everything. So if you go to Neutro's page, Neutro Arts, they did a recap of it all.
00:08:00.235 - 00:08:22.621, Speaker A: And Quilanina there. Santiago, Simulacro. And there's bulls. And there's this unbelievable work by Kappen, which looks sensational on a screen. Part of their show and everything. So there's mental noise and There's Sulky and Moda MT. So just a really cool show.
00:08:22.621 - 00:08:41.968, Speaker A: It's on their YouTube channel and they're very impressive, I have to say. Neutro Arts. So also this was on Saturday where I'm discussing a little too much text. Things you need to work out. You got to work your way through these things. It's experience alone. It's like broadcasting.
00:08:41.968 - 00:09:10.335, Speaker A: There's no shortcuts. And same with presentations. You just have to do it and do it and do it and you will eventually get better. So anyways, thank you and thank you for all the positive feedback on it and thank you for humoring my kind of wild thesis there at least. So I think on the second generation of digital art. Also thank you for the drawings and there were several. Here are a quick couple that were on Twitter.
00:09:10.335 - 00:09:32.309, Speaker A: So this is awesome. Who posted this? Juan Pez. Humble and quick portrait. So there I am, blazer and all, straitjacket and all. And also Jan, who you probably recognize this art from the PFP project. Got to meet Jan. And there was Locobelli by Jan, an original artwork he made during some of the talks.
00:09:32.309 - 00:10:09.295, Speaker A: So big shout out and thank you to everybody at Neutro, Jan and Juan and everybody. There is a couple of more portraits I'm going to try and bring in to the next show also. Okay, so massive Twitter space last Wednesday with Mikey De la Creme. Absolutely fascinating and kind of heart wrenching in a amazing way. A true journey of someone, one of the biggest collectors, one of the most recognized names in this entire space. Kind of a journey of redemption. So just an amazing story here.
00:10:09.295 - 00:10:25.409, Speaker A: An amazing space with Mikey de la Creme. And it's interesting, these numbers just keep going up. People are checking that out. So that is awesome. And also this week, Runetoon's on vacation. So Dina Chang is going to be guest hosting, which is super exciting. And we're going to talk to Dr.
00:10:25.409 - 00:10:56.171, Speaker A: Bill Kolomichek, which hopefully I'll learn how to pronounce the name correct. Generative art OG Algorithmic computer art from early 70s Original plotter art collection. So someone who's been around and for those that heard the Acevedo show, you'll know Victor Acevedo. You'll know. It's really interesting talking to these guys who have been there since the 70s and 80s. There's a lot to learn, a lot has changed. So that's coming up this Wednesday.
00:10:56.171 - 00:11:21.985, Speaker A: We'll broadcast from this apartment. Quick comments here. Bosque Grazia, see you soon. Hopefully we're going to try and overlap there. I go back to Berlin on Sunday so I think there's about 12 to 24 hours where bosque and I can meet who I believe is in Berlin. Thank you for the comment. Runetune Sometimes when your video freezes, the image of you left on the screen looks like a rat cloak painting.
00:11:21.985 - 00:11:59.733, Speaker A: So I hear the neighbors here, so I'm trying not to yell too much in the microphone. That is hilarious. So thank you for the comment and I lay on Beauty. This might be too much for this show unfortunately because there's so much in here. But let's return to this on this idea of beauty and we're going to return to this. So thank you for the comment. Runetoon Also here on the Twitter thank you for the huge response here on that super powerful work.
00:11:59.733 - 00:12:16.485, Speaker A: Someone was just mentioning to me yesterday how this work how impressed they were with Ratcloak's work. Nuv thank you for the comment. K's works A wonderful watch. Thank you. Dan Kelly We've got a couple of works by Dan. Great show as usual. Thanks for the feature again.
00:12:16.485 - 00:12:59.365, Speaker A: I also was using the Nintendo 3DS I believe. 3DS was a handheld console released by Nintendo in 2011, named for its dual screens and its ability to display stereoscopic 3D images without the need for 3D glasses. Very cool. And you might remember that the recording of the screen traveling through the mediums traveling through the different technologies Rorich awesome to hear from you really. Early person I met in the space who clued me into the fact that Myth and Ratcloak were using Microsoft Paint. So someone who's been around. Big supporter of Tezos Artists B thank you for the comment.
00:12:59.365 - 00:13:19.165, Speaker A: Filippo Francocci My pleasure showing your work. Have a great trip. Thank you. It's been wonderful. Amazing. I highly recommend visiting Buenos Aires Valley Pocan. Where should I post for critique in the community is the best place to do it and here is the link for you.
00:13:19.165 - 00:13:41.881, Speaker A: It's also on my profile page. You'll see it on X Golo thanks for showing my work. Always getting inspired watching your show. That's awesome to hear. What I love to hear as an artist. And thank you Segovia and AK Dell I have a pixel art collection on an object that was created using carpet design software, which is hilarious and has attracted the attention of many collectors. Pixel art is very popular.
00:13:41.881 - 00:14:05.789, Speaker A: We discussed pixel art as an interesting genre. I warmly invite you to explore the entire collection and perhaps find a piece that resonates with you to add to your own collection. I will add it to the mental checklist here. Thank you, Ak Dell, Luke500, who also set me up with Dr. Bill, actually, for this week's spaces. Thank you, Luke. Happy second anniversary.
00:14:05.789 - 00:14:22.509, Speaker A: Pocabelle's Artist Journal. I'd have missed. I might have missed a handful of episodes in total, probably 10. Hard to say which ones. I mean, amazing. That is amazing. I mean, as we are at like 346, I think, watching now the special live episode from Buenos Aires with Neutral Arts.
00:14:22.509 - 00:14:35.909, Speaker A: So totally awesome. Thank you, Luke. Appreciate that. Massive supporter there and friend Ernesto Ash. So quickly in the community. Let's. Oh, what happened to Ernesto? Here we go.
00:14:35.909 - 00:14:54.467, Speaker A: Trapped on object.com, so here's 369 with a cool animated abstract. Thank you for posting. Open Edition. Just posted Ernesto Ash with a few works here, a few abstracts here. Almost looks like pictures of the screen. Very interesting textures here from Ernesto Ash.
00:14:54.467 - 00:15:14.987, Speaker A: GM Ernesto Atlas. Yeah, thank you, Atlas Pop, for posting this link. I did see this young artist road to a $712 million boom. Then came the bust. We've kind of been commenting on this for a few months, haven't we? The contemporary art world is. There is a bit of a. Kind of a bursting of the bubble of certain works.
00:15:14.987 - 00:15:51.707, Speaker A: I'd argue it's more towards the more obscure, the more riskier bets, just like the stock market. Whereas the bigger, more solid works or artists that are more recognized, like a Surrealist or a Warhol, those still command regular prices. But the more obscure stuff is feeling the crunch. So I think that's what we've been seeing there. That was a New York Times article that just came out. Macro Metry Creando Melvis velocibe. So maybe a reference to the psilocybin here, Interestingly.
00:15:51.707 - 00:16:14.431, Speaker A: So very interesting digital art here. Pixel process from Macro Metry Micara de la Creme with a cool almost kind of digital collage and painting. Very interesting color. It looks like a photo even down here. So very interesting there. Luke 500 pre NFT era, but during the blockchain era edition of 25. And this.
00:16:14.431 - 00:16:27.559, Speaker A: I think I saw this somewhere. Maybe I saw this post. Michael Spalter. Yeah. So here, early work by. Well, actually not so early. I mean, it's 2011 by David Hockney.
00:16:27.559 - 00:17:19.417, Speaker A: You see the brilliance of Hockney here with this massive plugin and then a phone, the old iPhone plugin again. You know, as Baudelaire, Charles Baudelaire said, you know, one of the kind of roles of the modern artist is to paint the Present. Right. And it's kind of, it's, it's valuable and important by virtue of the fact that it is about the present. And so you see that here and you also see it done with contemporary tools as we see with this kind of, you know, interestingly, what looks like a non textured brush. Just what I would be tempted to call a classic digital art brush, which is basically a circle, you know, your classic almost pencil tool in Photoshop, probably using an iPad here. Will it ever, will it even work? Right.
00:17:19.417 - 00:17:38.391, Speaker A: So kind of some humor there from Hockney, which is awesome. The first dance. So very nice CGI 3D artwork from plag. Thank you for posting. Chrome Void how to make on chain art on Tazos. So something we saw with eight Bedoux. And we're going to return to this discussion.
00:17:38.391 - 00:17:49.783, Speaker A: And here's Ernesto Ash again, very cool piece here. Nice negative space on this. Nice repetition. Great color. Austin with a work as well. So thank you everybody. I'm going to move a little.
00:17:49.783 - 00:18:08.235, Speaker A: Ilya Zura. We have so much to catch up on. We're going to see this work by Kurt Hussle Collective again in the analog glitch section. We need to debrief on the lunch. Yeah. So I did meet, I mean so much has happened here. I did meet the myth, which was epic as well as Santiago and we went out for coffee there.
00:18:08.235 - 00:18:26.623, Speaker A: That was totally cool. There's a picture on the feed. Yes, it's been very eventful here. And thank you everybody, Valipan for posting AI Art of the Brain from mid-2021. Fascinating. Ilya Barabin, Kurt Hassel Collective. We are going to, we're going to see that work again.
00:18:26.623 - 00:18:52.085, Speaker A: Kiro and everybody, thank you for posting. And I think we. And also John Carroll, also known as John, posted some pretty cool works here. John made approximately $250 using rodeo. I now regret minting only one of each since we talked about the economics to put things in perspective. In just three days, John made approximately $250. So interesting.
00:18:52.085 - 00:19:09.521, Speaker A: Yeah, we're going to discuss this a little more. And here's Plagg again, another very cool artwork. So thank you everybody for posting. Jake Studios. Awesome. Kurt Hustle posting some works and Noodler, thank you for posting. And everybody, so the community alive and well.
00:19:09.521 - 00:19:28.093, Speaker A: And here's Lajo X. Very interesting. Looks like AI Atari Xerox desktop. So just a ton of fun here. Thank you everybody. And also Martin Joe and we had an awesome space as I got on the plane out to South America here. Thank you Everybody Artie Hands with some wisdom here and bringing it all back home.
00:19:28.093 - 00:19:54.855, Speaker A: Great art will prevail regardless of the chain. And I would. I think I 98% agree with this. It's interesting. Like if you do like a more obscure dead chain, you do wonder about that. Another reason to make work physical in my mind is as a means of preservation of the work and the concept. So just.
00:19:54.855 - 00:20:14.270, Speaker A: Yeah, so. But nevertheless, great art will prevail regardless of the chain. And Verse, which has been doing very nice things, are coming soon to Tezos or they're going to incorporate Tezos. So that is interesting. Kind of another vote of confidence for Tezos. And here it is. RipCash.
00:20:14.270 - 00:21:01.105, Speaker A: The mainstream assumes NFTs have been dead for a while. Unpopular opinion. But this is a good thing for the various art scenes in Crypto gaining momentum and mindshare under the radar on the timeline these gaining momentum and mindshare under the radar on the timeline these days. In other words, If I understand RipCash right, do you remember back in 2021, if you were there and all your artists friends were trying to we're trying to figure out how to get on the blockchain so that they could mint work and make a fortune because people were all of a sudden selling for more money than they'd ever sold in their entire lives. Quiet is good is another way of paraphrasing what RipCash said. Because now there's not as much competition. So you can get out there and your work can be seen.
00:21:01.105 - 00:21:38.045, Speaker A: So if you're new to this scene and you're watching this video, it's still a great time to get on because if people think it's dead, that's an opportunity. You don't want to come in when everybody thinks it's the next big thing because then you're going to be crowded out and you're not going to. You're going to get one like if you're lucky on your tweet with your image. So now is the time to rip Cash's point Mal NFT word is 2 to 3 more NFT marketplaces are on life support. Nobody want to be first know that. And I think this is known origin was KO'd or knocked out. I expect dominoes to fall.
00:21:38.045 - 00:22:19.959, Speaker A: So lots of volatility shall we say in the and who knows if this is true but sounds credible. Who knows but yeah a lot of volatility in the NFT marketplace area as we've been seeing and here's actually right click or RC XYZ this is a tough decision. We're stopping the development of RC XYZ. Despite onboarding 1000 artists, we couldn't establish a sustainable business model. Thank you to all artists and collectors for your faith and support, especially all of these artists here. Your contributions made this journey special. What's next? The site will remain operational, but there will be no further development and support.
00:22:19.959 - 00:22:51.965, Speaker A: Our DMs will remain open and will stay active here, waiting for the time when the idea of a registry will be needed. They were providing kind of the first hints of a major kind of registry where you can kind of find almost a database where you can look up an artist and see all of their works on chain. That seemed to be the direction they were going, which is quite exciting. Anyways, it was a very cool website. I don't think they had and I don't want to say but I feel like they didn't have Tezos support. But I could be wrong about that. I could be wrong about that.
00:22:51.965 - 00:23:50.025, Speaker A: Maybe they did actually. Anyways, Kvon so I believe this is the person that replaced Rob on foundation if I'm not mistaken. And so I believe also behind Rodeo folks learn things from the last cycle that now need to be unlearned. The tech has fundamentally shifted. Block space isn't a constraint. GAS isn't a constraint. And this is what I wanted to highlight what's needed social experiences that excite millions of people to participate on chain so this is what kind of stood out to me because I've been discussing this like why isn't there an arc blockchain where we don't need to use IPFs where all of the where the block space is huge enough? If this is true and I'm not an expert on blockchain, why isn't there an arc blockchain where we don't need to use an IPFS or International File Protocol Protocol? File server.
00:23:50.025 - 00:24:13.493, Speaker A: Right. Interplanetary File Server and that name and nothing against the but I'm kind of it's a touch concerning for me. Interplanetary. You know I hope it. I hope it all works out. I hope it all works out. But as I think Jason Bailey has pointed out, there could be an apocalypse in NFTs in a couple of years.
00:24:13.493 - 00:24:49.243, Speaker A: As Mark especially if marketplaces go down as we saw with known origin also in the connection to your files. You need to back that up. I think using Right Click's tool there, I think they have a free one. I think I haven't used it. I should so all to say I don't Know why? Again, why isn't there a blockchain where the ark can just be stored if block space isn't a constraint and gas isn't a constraint. Speaking of gas, Ethereum was below 1 Gwei, which is super cheap. And now last I looked it was at 2, but I saw it at 0.75,
00:24:49.243 - 00:25:36.407, Speaker A: 0.79 or something cheapest I'd ever seen it. Bitcoin was at 3 in the mem pool, which was super cheap. So all to say, interesting times and opportunities at least if you want to mint on Bitcoin or Ethereum, it's getting really cheap right now. Max Osiris, who's been a huge critic of these Free Mints, if you're wondering why I'm so angry about and so outspoken against Free Mint platforms, is that it took a lot of years by a lot of pioneers who put all their efforts into creating a space that respects and pays artists. We finally created a system that worked in a traditionally f over artist mentality that dominated commercial art and the likes of Tumblr and Web 2.0 that would aggregate the artist's natural desire to be seen, but then extract their labor for their own ends.
00:25:36.407 - 00:26:30.261, Speaker A: And mostly a skewed monetary relationship. So pointing out the real, you know, for all of the criticism of crypto as being this kind of degen, it's even kind of self celebrated, but a lot of people outside of the culture don't see it favorably. For all of the criticism of crypto, it could kind of rest its hat on this idea that artists were paid and that were sovereign and were basically for lack of better term, respected to paraphrase and maybe overgeneralize over paraphrase. Uh, and now that's starting to. We're seeing with Rodeo where all of a sudden you instead of, you know, the Free mint turned into 17 cents if people, if the reporting is correct. I've never minted on rodeo. Uh, I don't think you know, this whole.
00:26:30.261 - 00:27:30.113, Speaker A: And also Zora followed along maybe two or three weeks later also adopting this kind of 17 cent or 20 cent per mint model. I don't think that I'm not as convinced as everybody else and I could be totally wrong that you know, social media or Instagram fork using the exact same interface as Instagram is going to be what I don't see them, I don't even see crypto people using it. So are. Is the person on the street again, do they want to monetize their lunch? The like a picture of their lunch and then put that for sale or pictures of their kids. You know, as I was telling people that were asking me what I think, I don't think people want to monetize every last aspect of their lives. And so I'm not convinced on this whole idea that social media, as actually Kayvon was saying there last post, is going to be the thing that onboards millions of people. I think it's a very crowded, competitive space.
00:27:30.113 - 00:28:29.135, Speaker A: Social media, nobody wants another platform right now, Even Farcaster, which was doing surprisingly well. I mean, are people using it even right now? Maybe a little bit. But all to say, and you're going to be another platform and then another platform and we're going to have 20 different social medias. So I'm not at all convinced that this is a viable from my own whatever opinion for what that's worth. And so, yeah, so put it this way, I thought what Zora was doing before they switched the model from basically giving artists making the fees about, let's call it $353.50 and then splitting it between the platform and the artist, as far as I understood the model, I thought that was a very good platform because it gave the artists incentive to make work and sell work. Even if they weren't popular, even if they made 20 sales, well, then they made $40, which is a lot of money in Buenos Aires.
00:28:29.135 - 00:29:02.185, Speaker A: Right. And so the point, the place where I'm going with this is the I'm not convinced that ultimately that this going for a small amount of money is. I don't put it this way. This is where I was going as I lost my train of thought there. I've come back to it. The way to build a social media network is actually what they already had. They had a social media network.
00:29:02.185 - 00:30:01.887, Speaker A: It's basically doing what Object is doing. I've called it a futuristic social media network, which is exactly what actually I'd argue ZORA had, which is a social media network where instead of uploading your lunch and nobody wants to monetize that or buy that anyway, that's not what you use Instagram for that. You're not gonna use crypto for that. What you do is you upload imagination, you upload your art, and that becomes a more useful and interesting and futuristic social network, as I've been calling Object for probably two years now, almost two years. It's like a futuristic social network. Instead of uploading your lunch, you upload your art and then you even have a marketplace. So I'd argue they went, they had something and they Zora I would argue, and they actually destroyed the most important thing and the only thing I would argue.
00:30:01.887 - 00:30:43.027, Speaker A: And a lot of people would disagree with me that they had. I would argue like, I don't want to use some Instagram fork to mint 17 cent works, which already makes it feel worthless anyway. And then what? You're going to have a thousand editions, 2,000 additions, and then what's the collectability in that? So all to say, I think Max Osiris, who's been very vocal on this whole thing, is kind of right. Like, I don't. I totally agree. You know, people are comparing this to Spotify and music's been a disaster anyways, but we've all heard these arguments. So maxos Free Mints are a waste of time for everyone involved and actively heard artists.
00:30:43.027 - 00:31:09.275, Speaker A: I'm not going to write a thesis about it. For those that don't understand this and there are a lot of defenders of it, they're usually not artists, though. If not, I don't know if I've heard a single artist that's excited about this. They're usually devs, right? Max Osiris, your freeloaders are not your collectors. They couldn't care less about you or why you make art. You're the free mailer coupon. And they'll hoard as many other coupons in case one of you make it big.
00:31:09.275 - 00:31:51.025, Speaker A: It's not a great new paradigm that needs to be dismantled asap. And I'm kind of back to this idea, like in terms of media, this was all that they really had. Like, I don't understand why that is being kind of thrown under the bus, it seems to me. And maybe that was never the intention. Maybe they thought the artists would be excited to mint at this and that they'd get. You know, there's this idea that, you know, if we get 90% less for our art, it's going to work out better for us because we're going to get way more Mints and somehow we're going to get more money for it. But again, Spotify.
00:31:51.025 - 00:32:13.067, Speaker A: Yeah, here it is. Andy Schwetz, thank you. Because I've also been thinking a lot about this Spotify comparison today. This democratization only helps the really big artists with high streaming fees. Everyone below that loses out. It could be similar to the Free Mints, except that we have a much smaller target group. I mean, the magic of the Free Mints was they weren't free, they were two bucks.
00:32:13.067 - 00:32:49.941, Speaker A: But for Ethereum, it was basically free and almost cheaper than fees because you're Using Zora as a L2, that was kind of the beauty of it because for all intents and purposes, you're getting it for less than the fees you'd normally pay on Ethereum. We can call it a free mint and you're still paying 350. We split that with the artist and it works out. I think they stumbled upon this model and it worked. And I think, yeah, so let's continue. I find this orientation of art is almost free consumer goods questionable. And I don't see a ton of artists, like, I do see some using it.
00:32:49.941 - 00:33:11.123, Speaker A: And we have like maybe a couple of tabs here from Rodeo, but we're not seeing a ton of usage either. We can already view it freely on the Internet anyway. Why does it have to be free to own? And so, yeah, interesting. Unknown collector. Free mints. Giving the same quality work away for free that you sell elsewhere will hurt your market. Why would anyone.
00:33:11.123 - 00:33:39.389, Speaker A: Why would someone pay for something they can get for free? I'm not against them per se, for media, for example. Just trying to show some pitfalls when it comes to art. Ah, heck, I would a thousand percent rather collect your work on Tezos, where I know you'll be getting paid on the primary market for works I plan on vaulting. I want to treasure these works. I know they're far more valuable than what I am purchasing for. Even on Tazos. It just feels so unfair taking them for zero in a sense.
00:33:39.389 - 00:34:28.051, Speaker A: There is such a beautiful model and it still exists. And I think it will actually continue to exist because I think what these platforms are going to learn, so I think is that actually the artists, rather than being kind of okay, maybe they're one of many categories of things that are going on on a social media network. Zora saying we're a social media network. We're not like an art marketplace. I think what they're going to discover is the artists were basically all they had is what I would argue. I don't know anybody who wants to use a crypto social media tool other than Farcaster. But again, why did people want to use Farcaster? Because they're getting a bunch of tokens, Degen tokens.
00:34:28.051 - 00:34:57.325, Speaker A: And they were able to get more mints on their work. So as a way of getting it was benefiting them. If artists aren't going to be benefited, if they're not going to benefit, what is the point? And they're just. I think the free market, you know, will work its way and they just won't get the. I mean, Tezos is probably Going to get much more as well as, you know, super rare. Making a bit of a comeback. And we're seeing more mints on it as well.
00:34:57.325 - 00:35:14.917, Speaker A: And look at the token with super rare. Kind of getting bullish on. Super rare again. Ahic again. I'm still taking the pieces I enjoy from Zora and Rodeo, but when I see the same artist minting works for sale, I have.01 interest in collecting. I have zero interest in collecting.
00:35:14.917 - 00:35:42.793, Speaker A: Something has changed in me and I just want to share that for whoever it might help. Yeah, I haven't. Honestly, I'm pretty conservative with my wallet, so I don't even like to plug into new networks unless I, you know, unless I have to. So I haven't even really actually minted anything on those networks. Tornado Rodriguez. So changing the subject matter a bit here, having fun with Aspirate. So this is super interesting.
00:35:42.793 - 00:36:13.249, Speaker A: So we see a Tornado Rodriguez work drawn and I'm actually going to hang out with Tornado, I think on Wednesday. So that'll be awesome. Meeting a ton of faces here to put into the art and everything. But all to say, I say it a lot here. Use new softwares, use different softwares that will give you more versatility. And here we see Tornado Rodriguez's style done with Aseprite, a popular for those that are looking to do pixel art, this is your software there. So very interesting.
00:36:13.249 - 00:36:37.205, Speaker A: Let's continue. Dan Control at Museum New Barcelona. So there is Dan and there, let's see. You can see there's Dan in this exhibition at a museum, Museum Nou new in Barcelona. So very cool there. Collected a walk physical. Can't wait to hang it on the wall.
00:36:37.205 - 00:37:38.149, Speaker A: And the more I see this kind of volatility in these marketplaces and the vulnerabilities, I would say, of ifps and even ordinals, the more I am convinced that physicals are very important for all the serious artists out there. I think it's just a great thing to have and just a way of preserving your work, ironically, because usually you'd think digital would be the thing that's going to last forever. But think, and I just say think of the digital artists from the 60s and 70s. What if they had never made physical versions of their work and they just put it on a disc? Would we even be able to read half of them? Right? You'd need specialized tools, you need old computers. You'd hope the computers and the discs still work. Gregorio Zanardi new collection available only 16 unique pieces. So here we are, some physicals from Gregorio Study of facial expression in rats.
00:37:38.149 - 00:37:57.745, Speaker A: Interesting Object one of one. So I think selling physicals online. And look at that. That is actually what I wanted to highlight. This is how it's done with a. See that? You get a stamp, you get the date, you get the name. Signature.
00:37:57.745 - 00:38:13.101, Speaker A: Very professional. So good work. Maybe a certificate of authenticity. Luciana Guerra, GM Friends. In my last paintings as guest artist in Stupia's exhibition, Denise Sanchez Art painting on top. Hey, equipped. So here, I think, is Denise Sanchez on top.
00:38:13.101 - 00:38:28.951, Speaker A: There's Luciana Guerra. Guerra. And they're, I believe, out of Argentina as well. And I'm actually surprised at how many people I'm realizing are out of Argentina in this scene. I want to say it's like 30 or 40. Maybe 30%. Another Argentinian artist here.
00:38:28.951 - 00:38:46.751, Speaker A: Here's Santiago, his work on the COVID of a book. Silencia Intensiva y Philosophia Virtuel. And so interesting title there with. So there is Santiago covered by me. Very cool. So as we go into the work here. How are we doing? 38 minutes in.
00:38:46.751 - 00:38:59.715, Speaker A: Not terrible. Yuri J. Latrina. So a new. Let's bring this up large. So we're starting to see some more mints on super rare here. We saw Santiago make a couple of big sales there.
00:38:59.715 - 00:39:29.545, Speaker A: And here you see a bathroom and a very domestic scene almost having a slight AI feel there. But I don't think so. But I wonder. Probably not. Probably just a filter on a filter. But we see here we see Uri Jay's just continuing to evolve the style here, just like we're seeing with Ed Marola. The styles are evolving.
00:39:29.545 - 00:39:54.995, Speaker A: And the most bullish thing I see on this scene, in this scene is the fact that the artists are continuing. That's all that matters, in my opinion. The rest will sort itself out as far as the money and everything. And as long as they have enough that it's incentivizing them to keep making work here and posting it. And I almost think it's too late. Even if they didn't at this point make money, I still think there would be a core that would keep going. It may be too late.
00:39:54.995 - 00:40:23.855, Speaker A: Interestingly, in a good way, inside the world's most secret house built into a mountain. So another work minted by Uri J. This time minted on Object on Tazos. So another just super cool interior here. There's like a Kindle and all of these different, you know, again, taking outlines and basically using these outlines as opportunities to put different textures and everything. So almost looking like photography there in the background. In the window.
00:40:23.855 - 00:40:53.981, Speaker A: Not sure, just very evolved works. Here's work posted by Yuri on Twitter on X. So again in that trademark Mosaic filter. And even in the background here, nice and small, becoming a master, hilariously, for those that use Photoshop. You know what I'm talking about. Hilariously of the Mosaic filter. This is a filter that almost nobody wanted to use that was, I would argue, thought of as unusable here.
00:40:53.981 - 00:41:14.395, Speaker A: Urij has made it a signature and really shown what you can do with it. Here it is again. And what is this work called? So very prolific here. I'm not sure if these are new works. I think they are, but I'm not positive on that. So they're a guitar. And if not, I mean you just see all these great, great modern interiors here.
00:41:14.395 - 00:41:45.345, Speaker A: Let's continue one more moon's escape. So maybe that's the moon in the background here and these just gorgeous textures here. And then the clock also sign of a Uri J here and almost looks like a windowsill. Kind of has almost a renaissance feel to it with these, with the composition here. Very cool work from Uri J. Here's cider. No text here, just no text, just texture with cider.
00:41:45.345 - 00:42:02.277, Speaker A: Let's look up close here. So here you go. Just more super interesting experimentation. Cider out of Brazil. Verging on total abstraction. But usually there's something you can hang on to barely. Maybe this is a plant.
00:42:02.277 - 00:42:21.595, Speaker A: Not sure. Always kind of, you know, flirting with complete abstraction. Continuing on. Here's an artist I don't think I've seen before. Infinite canvas posted on x here. Untitled Dreamscape 01 edition of 3 and 2 sold. Maybe PP Universal posted this very interesting artist here.
00:42:21.595 - 00:42:49.700, Speaker A: Just again, kind of almost like Michi Asu. Kind of almost with these kind of very kind of blurred out brush strokes here, contrasting with the super sharp brushstrokes here. Just interesting work. More fresh work here. And here is the infinite canvas. 25 tezos. One left on primary if I'm not mistaken.
00:42:49.700 - 00:43:03.045, Speaker A: Oh no, PP Universal selling that on secondary and sold out at 750. Maybe the artist keeping one. Always a good idea. I call it the retirement plan. Hopefully. Fingers crossed. Michiyasu Dreaming on the cloud.
00:43:03.045 - 00:43:31.045, Speaker A: Our recent discovery of Michiyasu here. So again, wild, wild work here. This is an edition of one. And this sold to Dan Kelly who does the pixel art dogs, I believe. Seven tazos. Only seven tazos. And we saw some more masterpieces here by Zuozhou.
00:43:31.045 - 00:44:10.479, Speaker A: Here is one again. Another work that could have started this program. Let's just hit play here, make it large. So just amazing here from Zuozhou. Here's another one. Mysterious, beautiful, huge pixelation here. This one's gorgeous.
00:44:10.479 - 00:44:37.751, Speaker A: Look at the color. Almost looks like a piano. Maybe that's something else. Maybe a stand night table, who knows. And another one, I mean super prolific here. Just beautiful textures. Interesting.
00:44:37.751 - 00:45:11.153, Speaker A: And the title, Sunshine in the Bedroom. Great, great title. And Lonely Raindrops has a lot of good titles and beautiful music. Trying to remember who this sounds like. It really reminds me, I almost want to say like Harold Bud or something. The Pearl, for those that know that album I think produced or co done with Brian Eno, I think, or Robert Fripp. It's been a long time.
00:45:11.153 - 00:45:24.609, Speaker A: Beautiful Lonely Raindrops. And bring the mic back here. So Nova 1914 putting out a ton of work too. Also out of Argentina. Zozo out of Argentina. I mean it's quite interesting. We're kind of in.
00:45:24.609 - 00:45:56.659, Speaker A: It's tempting to call this a major digital art capital here. You know, it's kind of. It's kind of something to think about when you consider all of the artists. Again, here's another one with NUV 1914. And look at the edginess here with this, with this line, you know, and then bringing in some texture into these dogs and then keeping the frame. And so again with that line we see some of this earlier experimentation. It kind of brings us back to some of that earlier experimentation.
00:45:56.659 - 00:46:17.627, Speaker A: Only 15 tazos, very reasonably priced here. And there were a ton of dogs that came out, but these were some of my. The ones that just kind of jumped out at me. This one's 16 tazos. Again, this very edgy, edgy background and contrasting beautifully. And even the square eyes and square nose. A lot of experimentation here.
00:46:17.627 - 00:46:43.833, Speaker A: I mean again, trademark these kind of wild decisions here. Here's another one. Another dog. So all to say, just really beautiful, Beautiful work here. Pero 4, here's Dan Control, another kind of artist that loves gradients and playing with the shoes, taking the vans and just repeating it. Kind of a classic. Dan Control here.
00:46:43.833 - 00:47:05.221, Speaker A: Need too many. Really nice piece. Always finds inventive ways of making a new work and reusing elements. Right here is rare on exchange. Sold for five Soul Curled robot on a stool. So kind of an interesting composition here. Not exactly sure rare.
00:47:05.221 - 00:47:26.961, Speaker A: Almost always uses pastiche. So not exactly sure what the reference here is. Interesting painting. Ewan Hugloh's 1983 figure painting Curled Nude on a stool. So interesting pastiche there. That's on Solana from Rare the myth is on super rare. Finally dropping a work.
00:47:26.961 - 00:47:41.465, Speaker A: It's available for 0.77 ETH. And here it is. And it's called Life is death. So epic work here by the myth. Also out of Argentina. Again, really happy to meet the myth.
00:47:41.465 - 00:48:06.323, Speaker A: Last weekend with Santiago doing the translating. That was hilarious. Look at the almost the wild expression in the face here. And these little guys, these little homunculi. And even this beautiful painterliness that we're seeing here. I believe using procreate, the wild chair, the skull, everything. So just super interesting.
00:48:06.323 - 00:48:20.227, Speaker A: This the sky, a little more kind of refined than it used to be. A little more detail. Very beautiful. Almost renaissance looking work here. Putting out a few works. Let me remember. This is the myth 2024.
00:48:20.227 - 00:48:29.501, Speaker A: This is on object. Beautiful work here. Edition of 10. Had no tezos in my wallet. I wanted to pick this up. Took a while, two or three days. He had an opportunity to buy it.
00:48:29.501 - 00:48:47.185, Speaker A: Beautiful work here. Playing the piano. So just more beautiful digital painting here from the myth. There's the myth character in the background. The lemon head, the homunculi, the sky and the piano. Beautiful. The myth with Bola Deneve, Cuban singer and pianist.
00:48:47.185 - 00:49:08.409, Speaker A: Made of blood and pain. And here. This was sent out for free to collectors of one of these artworks. I think that last one classic myth with the green and the pink here and the hoodie. A faceless myth here. So almost removing a layer perhaps pretty classic. And that strong red mask.
00:49:08.409 - 00:49:24.525, Speaker A: Face without eyes. Cool gift to people who were to other collectors. And one more. So the myth is back with several works here. Some classic. The cigarettes. And you've seen the little guys.
00:49:24.525 - 00:49:43.589, Speaker A: A bit of a surrealist. The myth here and here. Wild work here with the throat cut. And again this kind of reference in the picture. Just full of invention. Edition of 1. How much did this sell for? Transferred to Hegel art collector.
00:49:43.589 - 00:50:05.365, Speaker A: So maybe a private sale. And here is Cesar la Familia. So another digital painter here. And a car, kind of 1950s car. And interesting, kind of like golf course sort of flags here, maybe beach flags and then a heart. So interesting piece here from cesar. This is 250 edition of 10.
00:50:05.365 - 00:50:27.515, Speaker A: And here is Pamela Cirone, who also out of Argentina, who I met also last weekend. Thought a brilliant piece. This also could have started the show with the two mouses. Felix the mouse transforming into Mickey Mouse. Quite brilliant actually. Interesting. Some noun glasses there for those in the crypto culture.
00:50:27.515 - 00:50:54.329, Speaker A: So this is 166minted, let's call it $0.20 each. So maybe $32 not bad. I wonder though, on. It's interesting to ask the question, okay, what would this have gotten on Tezos? Beautiful work by Pamela Cirone. Omg, I drawed it. And just, you know, on that point, I don't think anybody should ever be shamed for posting wherever.
00:50:54.329 - 00:51:22.935, Speaker A: I think artists just have to experiment. For all we know, these could be great platforms for artists, for all we know. And so those people that are posting and, you know, finding out for everybody else, you know, I think you do whatever you want to do is sort of my philosophy in this space. Let's look at omg, I drawed it. Omg, I drawed it. Whose name I always struggle with here. Let's see if the work comes up.
00:51:22.935 - 00:51:43.015, Speaker A: Otherwise let's just go back to it. I love the title of this. Unchained in 98. So here it is, kind of a. Looks like a reference to a portrait of 1998, you know, so kind of looking back there, kind of retro. Louis Osborne putting out some new work on Tezos. Not backing down.
00:51:43.015 - 00:52:08.155, Speaker A: Interesting reflection here and looks like two bumper cars. So always kind of a metaphor for the human spirit here a little bit. And psychology not backing down. Louis osborne edition of 20 selling out for 10 tezos. Not going super expensive here. Interestingly, fake ID, so this is pretty funny too. And I believe this is sold out at 10 Tezos each as well.
00:52:08.155 - 00:52:33.205, Speaker A: So pricing to the market, interestingly, so not going super expensive here. And again, just really cool to see new work from Louis Osborne. Cool title, cool concept as usual. Here is Katarina create edition of 10 for 5 Tezos Wimbledon. And here a nude as a tennis player. Very cool. Or cure 4 sold so far from Katarina Create.
00:52:33.205 - 00:52:44.177, Speaker A: And a little bit of movement in the line there. Kind of just kind of. It's tempting to call it animation. There's just movement. That's what I want to call it. Tornado Rodriguez. Tired of waiting.
00:52:44.177 - 00:53:14.385, Speaker A: So a gorgeous work using I believe the Tazos, kind of the equivalent of the Microsoft paint tool. Just minimal colors here. I mean it's two colors really. This could be screen printed actually. So again, just beautiful, kind of ambitious work here from Tornado Rodriguez. Really finding kind of a niche there with object paint 98. Selling out, I believe at 888 each edition of 10.
00:53:14.385 - 00:53:26.999, Speaker A: Gorgeous work there. Let's see what comes up. Here is Jake Studios. And this is. I'm seeing more people. Mint on tea. Ed Morola actually minted on Taya at the start there.
00:53:26.999 - 00:53:48.563, Speaker A: There. That work. Working together or what. The title, title's escaping me. So Continuing on, Jake Studios. So here we see a cool animated illustration. Kind of modern baseball bat, kind of branding, but then kind of as a weapon, kind of again, like a surreal illustration from Jake Studios.
00:53:48.563 - 00:54:05.185, Speaker A: Interesting pixelation there in the middle. That's Antea. That's an edition of 1 for 222 Tezos. Here's an edition of 1 for 200. Very cool work by Daniel W. Is the artist here. As you see.
00:54:05.185 - 00:54:29.385, Speaker A: Gorgeous, gorgeous piece here. So again, I believe out of Brazil, the longer these artists go again, the more bullish I get on this entire scene. I mean, this is beautiful. Cause the works just get kind of more and more persuasive over time. So again, grounds for bullishness here. Empress Trash. The text here is pretty interesting too.
00:54:29.385 - 00:54:43.921, Speaker A: So cool work. Kind of a wild piece. I don't know if there's volume here. I don't think so. Interesting piece, right? Kind of an alien figure on the beach. Check this out though. I've been talking about minting on polkadot.
00:54:43.921 - 00:55:24.147, Speaker A: Look at this. Seven day open edition, part of the Moonbeam Network, which is on polkadot group curation drop on wearable and on the front page with loads of other dope art. I hope the aliens like it. So I think that's Polka dot, interestingly. So how wild is that if all of a sudden polka dot came on the scene? So it's kind of like if you're kind of on the outside looking in, you see how kind of it really is the Wild west out here in the digital art blockchain world. Like, you see all of the volatility and change. So all you can do as an artist is just keep releasing your work and frankly, just focus on your work.
00:55:24.147 - 00:55:50.403, Speaker A: Make sure you keep putting it out. Make physicals just in case and document your stuff and back it up, you know, let's continue here. Juana Pedro, how are we doing for time? We're doing okay. So Juana Pedro with a beautiful. Another just super interesting abstract here. Kind of a recent discovery for me. This is on foundation and this is on base and a reserve of 0.025.
00:55:50.403 - 00:56:05.571, Speaker A: So I think this is a one of one, if I'm not mistaken. Very cool artwork. This is wild too. This is Element Lee doing kind of 3D1 of 1. Commissioned this. Our 8th commission was garden Wall by Element Lee. He had this to say about the piece in our interview with him.
00:56:05.571 - 00:56:41.295, Speaker A: Gardens are one of my main topics. I love gardens in real life too. They're a place to rest and relax as well as a connection node to nature in the man made world. In this work, a pixel creature is likely escaping from or trespassing into the garden. The wall is a metaphor for the limits or boundaries of an area. I mean, Element Li always experimenting here, as you see, even bringing in the drawings that were getting pixelated that we've recently been seeing. And so you can read the whole interview with Element Li with one of one who's also doing a pretty cool series once a month that I'm a part of with Santiago on.
00:56:41.295 - 00:56:56.551, Speaker A: We just look at manifestos. I think we're going to look at maybe I shouldn't say now, but a really cool manifesto next month. And look at this, Marcel. Oh wow. Element li in 3D. That's so cool. It's true home run commission.
00:56:56.551 - 00:57:11.085, Speaker A: So very cool. Element ly in 3D. This also could have started the show. This was really cool. New artist on the scene here. Schrodinger's unicorn, Nick Shumika. Look at this.
00:57:11.085 - 00:57:37.177, Speaker A: So looking like in the middle here, a repetition of the unicorn here. Look at what's going on here. Kind of almost like circles that are almost faded out. And then you have super high resolution or more or just kind of unfuzzy pixels in the front here. Looks like a repetition of the unicorn. This is wild experimentation here. The color in the middle, the beautiful composition.
00:57:37.177 - 00:57:53.545, Speaker A: I picked one up. It's 50 cents, 50 Tazo cents. It's 33 cents. Edition of 50 Schrodinger's Unicorn. Very, very, very cool work. Again, another tempting work to start with here. Here's another work by this artist, Nick Shumika.
00:57:53.545 - 00:58:08.351, Speaker A: Pixel Morta number one. Also edition of 50 for 50 Tazo cents. I wonder what that unicorn work would have sold for as a one of one. So super interesting. New artist here. More new talent coming in the door here. Murray.
00:58:08.351 - 00:58:44.385, Speaker A: Pixel Sirena, probably also known as a siren or mermaid. Again, this kind of movement, we could call it animation, but we're not seeing the figure being animated, just kind of making the image dynamic. I'm finding this super interesting, making it shimmer. So again, very interesting piece here by Murapixel Murakit. So on foundation and did that cell just listed, listed, minted but not listed. Nicholas Dietrich detail of a nearly finished new piece. More strange goings on.
00:58:44.385 - 00:59:21.443, Speaker A: So we've discussed Nicholas Dietrich's experimental, what I call enigmatic pixel art. And you kind of see it in progress here. You see even that kind of dark gradient, almost the street photography kind of has, as I like to say, almost a Giorgio de Chirico Kind of vibe to some of the elements that Nicholas Dietrich plays with. Here's Kapan from the Neutral Arts Latam Culture Builders show. This was on a screen. This is on a screen at the ALIF conference. It looks absolutely spectacular.
00:59:21.443 - 00:59:48.535, Speaker A: It's actually fit perfectly to I guess the old screen ratio. This looks absolutely stunning in person. When you see it on a screen, it looks stunning. Now I love the flatness frankly of this work. This is another spectacular work by Kapn. Again physical. You see that, you feel like you could see that in the highest, best galleries in the world and you would be like, this belongs here.
00:59:48.535 - 01:00:11.017, Speaker A: That's how I felt about it. It's really spectacular. If you're in Buenos Aires, go check that out. More work by Figments, also known as Kapon. Same artist, kind of a video game esque composition here. Even with this little portal here, there's a plant, the figure almost like the soul here and the dog. Really interesting.
01:00:11.017 - 01:00:48.685, Speaker A: Glitch Wave point edition of 16 selling out by Kappen for eight Tazos artists keeping things pretty reasonable here. Interestingly, Figments inside the Glitch Storm, another work edition of 16. And again we see almost like this video game scenario with this portal of the person and the dog with the ground showing up below where the figures are. Again, kind of almost for me reminiscent of Ultima iv. I think this is using an older software that makes these brilliant horizontal pixels you see in the plant. And also the animation I think is done in Gimp if I'm not mistaken. Here's Stalamere.
01:00:48.685 - 01:01:05.885, Speaker A: More wild pixel art here. Sci fi pixel art coast. Fun and kind of like an ancient Egyptian vibe, kind of an alien vibe. Look at this. Almost Nile of sorts here. The green and yellow water. Wild work, almost like telekinesis going on here.
01:01:05.885 - 01:01:32.965, Speaker A: And then square being held up by so again kind of ancient and futuristic at the same time. Fused in Pixel art edition of 26 and sold out at 2tezos. Super reasonable. AFM number 2. This is UGO Digi putting a new work here on Tezos. So seeing a lot of mints on Tezos. Interestingly, I wonder, I suspect probably what you're going to see.
01:01:32.965 - 01:01:59.259, Speaker A: I'm not seeing a ton minted on Zora. I'm not seeing a ton minted on Rodeo right now. I mean when you look at this, you're seeing more on super rare, you know, super rare again. And you saw the token go wild from 6 cents to like 30 cents in like a few days, three or four days I think. Binance Futures it's kind of like a financial. It's become more kind of liquid I guess you would say. So the token is being rewarded for that.
01:01:59.259 - 01:02:32.712, Speaker A: Anyways, cool work here. Not to get off topic from Ugodigi made with graphics to a popular retro software here is bytebybit who also likes to use retro software. Coming back a little bit as you see playing with three different abstractions I think this is. What is the name of the software has Dribblewaffle uses it as well. I want to maybe PC paint maybe it says here fantavision it's fantavision ega 16 colors. I think it was for PC. This is a one of one.
01:02:32.712 - 01:02:52.495, Speaker A: I think ilay picked this up actually 15 tazos so it's always cool how byte by bit releases one of ones makes it very collectible. If you have problems selling your work make it a one of one. Put it at an attractive price. It'll very likely sell. Not sure who this is. Let's see. Silvasand twos Interesting.
01:02:52.495 - 01:03:08.671, Speaker A: So Silvasand2's who we know doing a lot of glitch Rom look at this. Trying something a little different. This is spectacular. Totally different. Fresh. What is this? Very very interesting. So this is on Zora155 minted so far.
01:03:08.671 - 01:03:26.799, Speaker A: And how long has it been? Seven days. So if we were to guess maybe 30 bucks. If I had to guess maybe more 35. So interesting. Beautiful work here. Very interesting work from Silva Santuz. Interesting I always love.
01:03:26.799 - 01:04:03.765, Speaker A: I think it's so important to have different series experiment try different softwares. You don't know what you're capable of really till you try them. Anis Abdin Gamla Fabrikin so continuing the one pixel art work a day. Staying disciplined here on day 224. Anis Abdin so incredible interview. I did an interview with Anis about six I want to say four or five months ago I downloaded all of the X spaces so they will be updated to the Spotify. I think in the next couple of weeks I'm going to update it all is the plan.
01:04:03.765 - 01:04:28.719, Speaker A: Manatal Unknown Love this is on Rodeo So this is 62 Tezos. I wish there was a maximize here on. We'll see if they brought in. There's still no date either on the mint date but so 62 minted. So maybe 12. Maybe $15 if I had to guess 12 15. So interesting work here.
01:04:28.719 - 01:04:52.765, Speaker A: Unknown Love pixel art from Manadal. Beautiful piece, cool colors. Here is Dan Anthony Kelly and let me look at the time here. Gotta speed up A little bit helicopter dog. So very cool. I'm starting again. It took me a while to kind of understand that Dan Anthony Kelly was doing something a little different here with the pixel art.
01:04:52.765 - 01:05:18.559, Speaker A: So very kind of unusual, experimental, unique pixel art. Draw a dog Tuesday edition of 10 on Tezos here also maybe being filtered through that Nintendo 3DS console. Perhaps you see what looks like filming a gif on a screen, right? Filming a screen is what this looks like. Super interesting. Here's pixel array. Still pixel life. And look at this.
01:05:18.559 - 01:05:39.719, Speaker A: You can see it moving. So kind of just slightly glitched out a little bit and not all of it. Some of it's static, some of it's moving. So super interesting work here from Pixelari. This is an edition of one and this sold to Flying Beagle for 60 tazos. Nice sale. And here's Sabato August 12th.
01:05:39.719 - 01:06:04.265, Speaker A: Brief as a flower. And I'm not exactly. I think this might have been transferred to previous collectors of one of the Barbie works. So a cool. Where Barbie's kind of disjointed a little bit and glitched out here. The rest of it again, it's very poetic. The movement just in the figure and then the rest just static and it works Beautifully.
01:06:04.265 - 01:06:22.861, Speaker A: Edition of 11. Here's John on rodeo. And yeah, so cool frame. I love the gradient on the frame. I think Luke500 may have pointed me to this series. It's pretty cool. Abstract Window 08 and I think John Carroll has put out a few that have done quite well.
01:06:22.861 - 01:06:39.915, Speaker A: 375 so starting to get. I mean what does that. That turns into 70 bucks? I mean if John had put this on Tazos. I mean I always ask myself, I wonder if John Carroll's on super rare. I don't think he is. He should be. I think he's earned his way there by far.
01:06:39.915 - 01:06:53.699, Speaker A: I mean has a huge amount of collectors. How would that do on super rare? Interesting question. LB wavelength. So LB back on the scene here. Cool work. Kind of pixelated analog video glitch. Nice composition.
01:06:53.699 - 01:07:29.189, Speaker A: Nice abstract wavelength edition of 11 selling for five tezos. Each feels with a cool work here blossom. So quite, you know, kind of lame the amount of views this gets considering 176 retweets. Again, maybe it's because it's election season, but X you see the again the volatility of being a digital artist right now. The marketplaces turning everything upside down. The social media platform. We're going to give you a lot of reach.
01:07:29.189 - 01:08:12.055, Speaker A: We're going to give you almost no reach. It's quite, you know, it is the wild west out here. And you know what? Those are always the greatest times, I would argue in movements, in, you know, the stock market in the 1920s. That's, you know, that's where really legends and history is made, is when things are just kind of out of control, legendarily. So that's kind of. It makes me kind of when I see this amount of volatility and unpredictability and change and wild Westerness, that actually makes me bullish as well, that we're kind of in a special time. So I think so that's Bealls great animated abstract artist.
01:08:12.055 - 01:08:38.995, Speaker A: Here is a work by. I think this is owned by Cryptopathic. And I think this is Simon Lazarus. Just a wild work here on Occomparts. We've looked at, I think this artist before, but just a work from a recent show that appeared on my feed. Again, super interesting work here from this artist. I hadn't seen them in a while, so I thought worth highlighting.
01:08:38.995 - 01:08:57.955, Speaker A: Here's Neuro Color with a cool work as well. Would hang together nicely in the same show. Just kind of abstract and also animated. A lot going on here as usual with Neuro Color. And here's Kazuhiro Ehaira. A very cool work. An edition of one for 369 tazos.
01:08:57.955 - 01:09:26.145, Speaker A: I mean, it's great. You know, people can price whatever they want here and it's still pretty reasonable for a one of one. And just beautiful. Look at this wild experimental digital artwork. Right? Like, if you saw this in a contemporary art gallery, I mean, I would be impressed. I'd say this is a pretty cool gallery is what I'd say to myself. PS17 edit 10 edition of one on Tezos tea.
01:09:26.145 - 01:09:50.950, Speaker A: You are watching Kurt Hustle Collective on Teya. So interesting. This is an edition of five. It looks like it's sold out. Let me make sure. Always great music. It's beautiful.
01:09:50.950 - 01:10:03.485, Speaker A: Love the music. Always. And the visuals. Not used to Taya here. Let's see. Okay, and then we have another one. Another brilliant one.
01:10:03.485 - 01:10:21.321, Speaker A: Warning. KHC Warning. Beautiful. This could have started the show. That would have been hilarious. I mean, there were so many works in this episode that, you know, I would have happily. It was a very difficult decision.
01:10:21.321 - 01:10:43.177, Speaker A: Anyway, it's just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Two minutes. Hilarious. And here is Ex Mortal. Another gorgeous work here. Loving these kind of nature landscape works and just love the side of the work here and the color and the waves of color coming in. Stunningly gorgeous.
01:10:43.177 - 01:11:03.393, Speaker A: Little Sun, Little Wave edition of one sold Transferred two little birds. Ex mortal. Another super beautiful work of nature by Exmoral. This is a GIF I believe. And interestingly and kind of a different kind of glitch on this one. So very cool. And speeding along here.
01:11:03.393 - 01:11:24.334, Speaker A: Here is Kiro on foundation. Very cool kind of minimal video painting here. Very, very cool. I love the minimalism of it. There's something very soothing about it. So just very, very nice piece. Auction starting bid at 0.02.
01:11:24.334 - 01:11:47.175, Speaker A: Untitled 307231 here's walk with work. I believe it's from the Pokemon card series. This one. It's kind of funny how some of them. This one really stood out to me as a gorgeous one. Is this only one tazos one bid here 18 hours ago. Someone might walk away with a real steal here.
01:11:47.175 - 01:12:16.615, Speaker A: Five hours and 48 minutes to go. Rattata. And here is another one by Bedala who early in the show I showed some works by Bedala. Kind of lost track and now are starting to show up on my feed again. And just a really cool, I believe, collage, kind of digital collage artist, very original artist here. Really nice kind of compositions in the wild. Number 10 edition of 25 and selling for only a Tezos 57, maybe a dollar.
01:12:16.615 - 01:12:44.423, Speaker A: Here's Toques with a work. This is on wearable 0.075 ETH. So almost like the free mint price that used to be on Zora. Interestingly, mint page is live open edition max 3 per wallet. Interesting. I wonder if Rarible is adopting the old Zora open edition price.
01:12:44.423 - 01:13:04.439, Speaker A: That is interesting. If anybody knows that, feel free to message Toques. Another one available on super rare. I'm not sure if this is new or not, but very wild AI artwork from Toques. Here's another one. This one's stunning, just stunning. So just beautiful work here from Tokes.
01:13:04.439 - 01:13:28.113, Speaker A: And here's Lily Ilo with an older subject here and beautiful hands and everything. A little bit of a frame on this one. GM to those who care about other humans. Indeed. I mean, this almost looks like a physical, but it's hard to tell. Is that AI or is that a physical? I assume it's digital. Here is Kennexapata.
01:13:28.113 - 01:14:02.105, Speaker A: And what is this called? Spark. And very cool work here with some. With some interesting. Almost looks like a big tablet here and kind of looking more eastern in the subject matter and just kind of a cool Spark here. So cool combination of work can exapita, I believe, coming out of the glitch scene from what I understand. Here's Martin Jo and We did an awesome space with Martin Jo a couple of weeks ago now, and it was awesome to meet Martin Jo over at the Neutro event. Here is another GM Bears.
01:14:02.105 - 01:14:26.065, Speaker A: GM Bear work, which we all love here. Got coffee. And these works are getting more and more just beautiful and kind of just these grand narrative paintings that Martin Joe's making are just very cool. Machine Emo Boy. So another kind of. So it's just interesting. So this is on Zora by machine here.
01:14:26.065 - 01:14:48.945, Speaker A: And so this looks like a physical painting, I believe, put on Zora. So 207 mints. So if we had to guess, maybe like 45 bucks. If I had to guess. So that's by machine and that is Emo Boy. So as we go into the physicals, Lucena Guerra, King of Pain. These are gorgeous.
01:14:48.945 - 01:15:05.601, Speaker A: So collage with monotypes. So taking monotype printing, I guess, and then making collages out of it. Very cool. Very. I love the yellow kind of contrasting with the white here. We have another one here too. Collage with monotypes.
01:15:05.601 - 01:15:20.747, Speaker A: Work in progress. Number four, Aeolus and the Little Devil. So very interesting physicals here. And who is this natural. Natural tourism. Yesterday's story. Pretty sure I follow them already.
01:15:20.747 - 01:15:46.975, Speaker A: That is a glitch on X. So interesting piece here. And here's the artist we've been looking at that's been doing Noah Verrier, who's been doing the McDonald's and peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a martini as an oil painting. And here is Walk with. I'm not sure if we've seen this one before, but just another. You see the virtuosity in the spray paint here with this work. And that, my friends, is your show.
01:15:46.975 - 01:16:01.525, Speaker A: Thank you for joining me again. Probably the next one will be probably when I get back in Berlin in about a week. So thank you for joining me. Hopefully I see you on the Twitter space on Wednesday with Dr. Bill. Until next time. Take care.
