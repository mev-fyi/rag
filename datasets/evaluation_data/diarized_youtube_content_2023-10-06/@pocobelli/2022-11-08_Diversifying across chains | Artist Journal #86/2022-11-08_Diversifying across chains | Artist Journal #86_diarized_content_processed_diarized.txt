00:00:04.200 - 00:00:32.354, Speaker A: You know, I woke up this morning, just as I woke up, that first thought in the day, and I was thinking to myself, think of how hip my mom is. She's watching this show every day. She's totally clued in to the visual arts underground, what sometimes is called the avant garde of digital art. Here on November 8, 2022, in Berlin. Tuning in. And she loved the birthday greetings. I got a great message.
00:00:32.354 - 00:01:05.774, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and I welcome you back, dear viewers, and all new viewers as well. Yeah, so anyways, I just thrilled that mom is happy. And look at where we are here with an avant garde work, dare I say? If you disagree, feel free to leave a comment. We love comments here, good and bad. Okay, so look at this. Mason III down the rabbit hole. We go with a Nintendo glitch rom experimentation.
00:01:05.774 - 00:01:32.994, Speaker A: Of course, Heidi Rockette is a pioneer of this, but this goes all the way back to Corey Archangel at the Whitney, where he has. Maybe we can quickly bring it up here, because maybe probably most of you haven't seen that. How do I do this without losing anything? Let me bring this up. Let's see. Very quickly. Query. Archangel clouds Nintendo.
00:01:32.994 - 00:01:48.686, Speaker A: Yeah. Okay. I think we even have a video here. Hopefully the copyright police do not attack us here. This is basically it. And just clouds going across. And of course, there's some eight bit music, too.
00:01:48.686 - 00:02:12.384, Speaker A: Super Mario clouds 2002. I think I saw this in 2007 at his big show at the Whitney in New York City, where I think it was my first trip to New York. All I remembered thinking was, this guy's the same age as me. He was born in 1979, and he's got a show with the Whitney. But so it goes. And, you know, you never know how it goes. And we persist here.
00:02:12.384 - 00:02:41.942, Speaker A: And so anyways, let's get into this show. Monument of confrontation rom corruption still frame produced for the holders of the supreme battle. So this is a still. Okay, so this still comes from this brilliant nintendo glitch rom work. And of course, there is Arcadetown Glitch. Who is going to comment here? Arcade Town glitch is also a great. Vito is also a great Nintendo glitch RoM artist.
00:02:41.942 - 00:03:08.136, Speaker A: I want to join the party. Let's take a look at this, though. Let's see. There is no volume, but maybe no volume is required. So look at how much is going on in here. Like very, very, very cool experimentation here from Nintendo. Sorry, from Maison the third.
00:03:08.136 - 00:03:35.404, Speaker A: Now, regular watchers will recognize Mason the third. Look at this great work here. So tons of experimentation almost made like the people are almost made of other, you know, screen filters or screen grabs and kind of pasted on. Who knows? Let's actually just look. Made by live code breaking on PSX ROM. So that's interesting. So it.
00:03:35.404 - 00:03:56.224, Speaker A: Because usually we see, I think actually Vito is going to mention another. Usually there is a different ROM corruption software. I think it gets mentioned here, raw glitches, no color retouch. Post process for video editing. Mp 441 seconds. Only 52 megabytes available for one tezos $0.44. So if you got a couple of bucks, you can pick up that work.
00:03:56.224 - 00:04:27.452, Speaker A: Now, you may recall this is the artist Mason III, who made this very sad piece. I realized in retrospect, I showed my girlfriend this piece over here, don't take my child away. And she thought it was really sad. And also I kind of felt like I understood a little bit more of the piece. I was just looking, I guess, more at the formal elements of this and just thinking, I love that digital frame again. Sometimes I'm very slow to understand these things. But anyway, slowly but surely we make our way.
00:04:27.452 - 00:04:51.946, Speaker A: And of course we saw this work the other day, so really enjoying this work by mazen rom corruptions and glitch now. Okay, beautiful. So Vito chimed in, Glitchtown arcade. Thanks for the mention, Adrian. As you said, I was playing with the concept of game over. So remember that was the work where it looked like the world was coming to an end, or like the world. So game over.
00:04:51.946 - 00:05:09.270, Speaker A: The world is over. And the fact that our world is half screwed. I composed the glitch using RTC. So this is another glitch rom corruptor. I can't remember what that stands for. I actually have it. I assume that's after effects AE and Photoshop.
00:05:09.270 - 00:05:35.276, Speaker A: Over and out. Thank you for the additional information, Vito. I hope to join that glitch Rom party at some point. Maybe that'll be in a month or two. Yeah, so, and this actually brings up a very important show note, which I kind of alluded to a couple of times here already. But I'm gonna basically, the new schedule that I'm kind of aiming for, because I've been going basically every day that I'm not on vacation here, including weekends. I'm going to cut the weekends.
00:05:35.276 - 00:05:59.864, Speaker A: Or actually, the way I'm going to do it is I'm going to make them optional sometimes because I'm going away to London at the end of the month. That's on a Monday, Tuesday. Maybe I can do it because I'll be traveling alone. And then I go to Canada afterwards. So I may put in weekend stuff if I'm going to have some weekdays off. But all to say, yeah, the art, I'm not doing as much art. And the art for me, in my universe is the main show.
00:05:59.864 - 00:06:37.024, Speaker A: So, yeah, so weekends I'm gonna take off. But I think it gives people a chance to catch up as well, because not everybody has 20 to 40, sometimes 50 minutes a day to watch a show. So it gives people time to catch up, which I think is fun. Also a comment from crypto future. Solana also can be turned off at the moment when you want to sell or buy an NFT. And when it works, it is, of course, very fast, because it's centralized, just another web two company disguised as web3. And, yeah, I mean, this is a common criticism of Solana as well as binance smart chain.
00:06:37.024 - 00:07:10.676, Speaker A: I mean, that's how binance smart chain worked BSc so well and fast when it first came out, because it was centralized, there's like 18 or 31 or whatever. It was centralized. I don't know if you'd call them nodes or whatever they are. I'm not an expert in these things. And Solana also has that. As an artist, I'm not overly concerned. Like, I actually like this idea of diversification, and I kind of like the feel of Solana, so I don't really worry about it too much.
00:07:10.676 - 00:08:09.508, Speaker A: I think it's good to be on different chains. And ultimately, I think the archivists, the archive people, are going to figure it out, and if it works now, they're going to be able to get it working 30 or 50 or 100 years from now, one would think, with even better technology, one would think, and who knows? I mean, crypto future brings up a very true point here. So that is something to keep in mind when you are working on Solana. It's not as decentralized as ETH, but, I mean, Luke 500 actually wrote me a message, and we're going to get into. He was saying how? And we're actually going to talk about Dmitry Cherniak, who is a big player in the generative arts space. He was saying how that Dimitri, according to Luke 500, and I asked him if I could mention this, and he said yes, was actually a critic of Tezos because it was centralized. And Luke 500 brought up the point.
00:08:09.508 - 00:08:33.852, Speaker A: I wonder if he still feels that way now that the proof of stake merged, now that the merge has happened. Because one could argue with the merge on Ethereum, things are more centralized. We're kind of just, you know, us artists here, we're just. I think it's good to just spread yourself out. I think, you know, get yourself on foundation is pretty easy. Put out a tweet and you can probably get on foundation. You just need an invite from another artist.
00:08:33.852 - 00:09:41.968, Speaker A: All, everybody who's on foundation has ten invites. Okay? So you can get on ETH. I say diversity diversification is fun. There are different audiences, you know. So again, we're multi chain multimedia over here at Artist Journal, at Adrian Pokeballi's artist journal, Capstone had a very interesting tweet relating to this multi chain theme. So just as all the Tezos artists are migrating to ETH, which is actually a good point, and I don't know if they're migrating, but they're diversifying to ETH, without question, over the course of this short program, or of course, last two and a half months or whatever, however long we've been doing this program, the use case for Tezos becomes stronger and stronger just as people are migrating, as ETH marketplaces look to screw over artists. So remember we were looking at myth, and he coolly, I don't know if that's a word, he generously released his financials, so to speak, on how he did on tazos, and he basically made like a nice middle class salary.
00:09:41.968 - 00:10:16.790, Speaker A: It was something like 30 or 40,000 tezos, I believe, or maybe it was around 30,000 tezos, which we could call 50,000. $60,000 is what we calculated it to be. And so are you going to ignore Tezos? And almost half of it was on secondary. Okay, so again, to me, the great lesson here, because. Exactly, let's say you went all in on Ethan, and now maybe you're not getting your royalties. So again, I just like spreading it out. You get slightly different audiences.
00:10:16.790 - 00:10:56.486, Speaker A: Like, I don't get the same people collecting my work on tezos as I do on ETH. For the most part. Some of those people will be cross chain. But you know what I'm saying here, right? So as an artist, and that's what I am and what we are all about here, from artist's perspective, I think diversification makes a ton of sense, and that's what a lot of the artists do. Unless you're already some mega artist on ETH, then maybe you stick to that for a whole bunch of reasons, some political, probably, you know, you don't want to offend your collectors by maybe going over to tezos and whatnot. So interesting. Just developing on this royalties side of things.
00:10:56.486 - 00:11:11.370, Speaker A: Object.com put out this tweet yesterday. Here's why. Object will not switch to 0% royalties and is committed to putting creators first. So let's take a quick look at this. And there's a very delightful ending, let me tell you. But one step at a time.
00:11:11.370 - 00:11:43.030, Speaker A: Royalties have been fundamental to empowering artists in web3 and revitalizing the digital creative movement. Very true. To maintain and strengthen this, it is essential to provide a platform that inherently respects the creators and innovators of this new economy. So some common sense and stating the obvious here. Thank you, object. While off chain royalties are not technically enforceable, it is ultimately a platform's choice to uphold them. We at object choose to do precisely that and stand behind our creators.
00:11:43.030 - 00:12:26.822, Speaker A: So more reason to just be diversified and stick on Tazos, as that previous tweet was mentioning from capstone. This is interesting, though, and kind of exciting for all us. You know, Tezos lovers, royalties are just one of the many ways to monetize creative output. We have been testing and are working on alternative methods to help creators diversify and reinforce their income streams. We are excited to share more information on this and the object dao token Airdrop soon. So that could be epic, guys. And kind of makes me feel better about missing my blur I o from a deadline, which I'm still like, I think about every day.
00:12:26.822 - 00:13:06.204, Speaker A: Not too much, you can't worry about this stuff, but it kind of makes me feel a little bit better. Guys, something to look forward to, because a lot of us who watch this program are on object, and so another reason to just kind of get yourself on there. A token airdrop is coming soon, so just kind of exciting. Another reason to be in web3. It's just a creator economy and it's very true just very quickly. I mean, I've been doing digital, you might say, in a really intense way since like late 2015, early 2016. I think it was November 2015.
00:13:06.204 - 00:14:05.142, Speaker A: I think whenever the iPhone six s came out, which I consider the first art phone phone, I've been intensely digital. I did the 200 image series on the peloponnesian war art book and whatever, whatever. Did a ton of work, which I'm going to start tweeting out actually more often here. But the point is, back in 2016 and all the way up to 2020, when I understood finally what super rare was doing and understood crypto for the first time, fairly late to the party, but not too late, I was always trying to figure out how to make things physical, okay? And so I could actually sell and make money from my digital art. So this is no small matter the market side of things, because as we've seen, as I like to call it, a cambrian explosion, a digital art revolution is taking place. And I think the market forces are a huge incentive for artists to make art and to potentially live off their art. A lot of artists do, and a lot of us aspire to.
00:14:05.142 - 00:14:32.130, Speaker A: Okay? And we want to keep that dream alive. And royalties definitely helped that story. Continuing on, tradscape, one of our favorites here, and the guy who makes the brilliant music at the beginning and the end of this program, a great episode. And I totally agree about royalties. Discussing yesterday's discussion on royalties, I will literally never release on a platform that doesn't support them. So tradscape weighs in and. Exactly.
00:14:32.130 - 00:15:18.832, Speaker A: And as I put in my reply here, it's kind of like, as people say, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should do something. So just because you can not pay royalties doesn't mean you should. And ultimately, I mean, I would argue, and I don't want to get too long here, because it's already getting too long, but ultimately, acting in a good way is self. Is in your self interest, I would argue, and I think that's kind of, again, back to Platonism and Santa Socrates. Okay. It's in your interest to act good, because how good are you going to feel if you steal that bag of chips from the store when the storekeeper turns his head? Just because you can. Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
00:15:18.832 - 00:15:54.498, Speaker A: And to me, like, the fact that this debate has gotten this far is a little concerning. Right? So word up, tradscape. Glad you're enjoying it. Now, Luke 500 sent me these over messaging, and I asked him if I could mention it. Of course. So this is the guy who is also kind of talking about the CEO and being, you know, where basically you don't need to be a CEO, or he's saying something about how important royalties are to artists. Dmitry Cherniak, and we had never looked at his work.
00:15:54.498 - 00:16:28.558, Speaker A: He's a generative artist, but these are some early works that he did before the generative art, and look at how much they went for. $2.4 million. I mean, I think this went to some of it, to three arrows capital, who was kind of throwing money around like there was no tomorrow. And I think that kind of actually helped boost the valuations of all these, which leads to, you know, I'm actually a little concerned for some of these ETH generative art projects that there could be. There is no mean to revert to. But I think they may be revalued at some point.
00:16:28.558 - 00:16:53.476, Speaker A: And actually I could see Tezos art being revalued higher, but not investment advice at all because that could take 100 years, frankly. You just don't know. Or it could be two months. We don't know. So here are the works. So very interesting. The system of these were the first works that led to this series here, the Ringers, which many of you will be familiar with.
00:16:53.476 - 00:17:11.023, Speaker A: So I believe this is generative art. I believe it's all on chain. Feel free to correct me in the comments if I am wrong. And look at how much these are worth. Like last sale, 20 ETH. But look, selling for 134. Like if you want to buy one of these, price low to high.
00:17:11.023 - 00:17:39.980, Speaker A: Let's put buy now. And yeah, 65 ETH, that is your floor here. 65 ETH, which is basically $100,000. Let's just call it that. So anyways, just so that we're all familiar, because this was news to me, these works on super rare, a lot of you will have seen them. I mean, 6400, which actually sounds like a lot, but it's actually not that many when you think about it. So anyways, here are the works.
00:17:39.980 - 00:18:09.284, Speaker A: So just to be familiar. Quite cool. And it's quite interesting to see what they developed into as a generative art project. So continuing on LB, I like to just touch on this always this display issue. And here is an on cyber gallery, which I have also showed skepticism of just because it's too much work for me personally. And some people I've talked to privately have agreed with me on this point. It's a lot of work just to get from the point a to point b.
00:18:09.284 - 00:18:36.472, Speaker A: So what I would do if I was on cyber, and maybe they already do this, I think they might even already do this, is there's the way you can go like here, like a virtual reality gallery. And also I think they do this already. Just give it to me like a slideshow, kind of like this show where I can just go through everything and not have to worry about the walking. Give me the option. And then I think you have a rock em sock em product here. You already do. And.
00:18:36.472 - 00:19:16.044, Speaker A: Yeah, so my two cent there. So anyways, so there is an lb work in kind of a country western wall. So very cool. Continuing on, Dan Control sold his Ronald McDonald for 25 ETH as well. And we covered that earlier on the show. So I just wanted to give a shout out another, you know, I love the consistency and the sheer amount of works that Dan Control is putting out something to aspire to. And also Jnk Kurt Hussle collective are just a quick shout out.
00:19:16.044 - 00:19:42.350, Speaker A: Best offer accepted in 48 hours. And this came out about 12 hours ago. So you have a day and a half to make a bid on this fantastic the talk night show episode two by Kurt Hussle Collective. Currently 150 tezos. So selling it for a song so far, and just a couple other kind of, you know, semi industry notes. So again, I advise with Arthropo. And this is a.
00:19:42.350 - 00:20:00.724, Speaker A: So they are putting out a release with Mikey Delac Creme. And this is one of the pieces. And it's actually really interesting. So first of all, gloom tube on Ethereum. This may be a first as far as I understand. And what does it say here? Backyard smacked down by gloom tube from field trip there. There goes the neighborhood.
00:20:00.724 - 00:20:17.544, Speaker A: The first from vvDs. I'm actually not sure what that stands for. Pics will be released Monday, November 14. So a week from now, next Monday edition of ten. Small edition available with a drop pass for 0.5 ETH. All five works.
00:20:17.544 - 00:20:31.642, Speaker A: Or. And this is interesting too, so. Or as an individual work for 0.15 ethanol. So you can pick this up. Only addition of ten. So what I really like about what Arthropo is doing is they are evolving with each drop.
00:20:31.642 - 00:20:50.342, Speaker A: They are trying out new mechanics. And that, my friends, is how you do it. That is how you build a business. So very cool heads up there and just a couple other sort of things. So we're in this kind of bear market here, but there's a lot going on GM. This is from Ezra Eslint. Here's an announcement.
00:20:50.342 - 00:21:14.018, Speaker A: Tezos posse with fake whale gallery and we've seen fake whale with die with the most likes. And there was another artist that we looked at and so on. Nifty Gateway. And so I think there's a, you know, as you can see here, there's a bunch of artists walk is on there. It was Wok, it was the other artist. So anyways, twelve artworks. So things are happening.
00:21:14.018 - 00:21:43.544, Speaker A: So nifty gateway. I guess this is maybe the moral of the story is working with Tezos. We're just kind of cross chain business, as we saw with Arthropo Tezos artists on Ethereum. And finally another initiative, art to act. Aksin showed us this beautiful work here with his wonderful brushes that he has generously shared with people in the community. I'm participating with art to act Genesis collection mint date November 10 so that is in two days. Today is Tuesday so that is on Thursday.
00:21:43.544 - 00:22:24.344, Speaker A: So heads up there. And finally I just. Here's limbo working. I think this is like, this makes me excited on a personal level, you know, because I'm, you know, I lived and breathed this synth culture for, you know, ten years at least. And I still, like, I don't have time, frankly. But if I had more time in my life, if we had 48 hours in a day, I might spend like six of those or two of those hours doing, like, music production just for the hell of it. Because those toys have become so incredible.
00:22:24.344 - 00:22:55.870, Speaker A: Rolling cloud, all that stuff. So something's cooking and uxing. I haven't forgot your suggestion about some acid house recommendations in the program. Again, this is another reason why me taking weekends off could work to the benefit of the show as well. Because then maybe I have a couple extra hours in my day to figure that stuff out. Dana Ulama, just a GM, and I just love, again, a limbo discovery. We have another one that's limbo discovery here, or I learnt about from limbo.
00:22:55.870 - 00:23:17.764, Speaker A: So just another beautiful work. These vaporwave colors and some futuristic Tokyo looking landscape somewhere in Asia, there in the east. So Dana Ulama with another beautiful work. This is also an artist I discovered from the great limbo. Sad girl. Bye for six. So as we go into our roll call here.
00:23:17.764 - 00:23:35.264, Speaker A: Yeah, just an interesting. Looks like Sailor Moon kind of glitched out. This is part of a larger series. And got to be careful I don't kill my mic here. Yeah, you see, like, over here, I'm not sure if this is Sailor Moon, but it's. Wow, look at that. That's already going for 33 tezos.
00:23:35.264 - 00:24:07.444, Speaker A: So it's so fun, right? Like, what kind of art collector would not like collecting on tazos, right? Like, I mean, you buy it for. I think I picked this up on secondary for twelve. Now you have to buy it for 33. Like, three days or a week has passed, right? And it's a great artwork. I almost never sell. You know, I'm like CZ, I never. I hold, right, okay, continuing on, Ezra Eslin, who we're just discussing who is in that nifty gateway drop on with tezos.
00:24:07.444 - 00:24:23.784, Speaker A: Let me show you something here in the closet. And she's also cross chain. She also uses ethereum to good effect. I think she's on super rare. She is. So anyways, let me show you something here in the closet. And so one of her disturbing scenes, which I just find head turning.
00:24:23.784 - 00:24:45.404, Speaker A: I'm not sure if that's old or new. Here is a new artist that turns out to be. I got it here. The long suffering wife of Max capacity. So this is Bug Slayer Betty, and she's also multi chain. I just thought this was a really nice work here. And kind of a.
00:24:45.404 - 00:25:05.932, Speaker A: It reminds me of a rosenquist, actually. So we see here the woman screaming and the Kitkat clock. Let me see if I can bring up the James Rosenquist. It's even spaghetti. And there's a car. Car grill. Let's see if this works.
00:25:05.932 - 00:25:33.762, Speaker A: Yeah, this is one of my favorite Rosenquist works. Let's see if we can open this properly. Yeah, look at that. James Rosenquist, pop artist. He was a billboard painter and then turned pop artist. So isn't that great? Like, how made to order is that sometimes this later work is quite controversial, I'd say, just among collectors onto what happened, because there's kind of like. I'll just quickly show you.
00:25:33.762 - 00:26:14.424, Speaker A: These shows are going way too long. You know, I was thinking Twitter has a 42 minutes limit when they get their videos set up, and that could be good, because that will just put a cap on this show if I start releasing it on Twitter as well. Let's just see if I can find. Yeah, this isn't what I was looking for. Yeah, this is kind of more like it. Yeah. So these kind of works here are sometimes, like, I remember being actually at Art Basel Miami in 2012, the last time I was there, and there was, like, one of these works, and you could hear, like, these kind of rich collectors just being like, don't know what happened to Rosenquist, that sort of thing.
00:26:14.424 - 00:26:36.280, Speaker A: I mean, you make your own decision. But I'm a big fan, obviously, of James Rosenquist, and this work is brilliant. So, anyways. And of course, there's that work. And, yeah, he's a classic. So, yeah, so that work by Betty art just kind of echoed and, you know, lightly echoed this kind of. This kind of structure.
00:26:36.280 - 00:26:58.830, Speaker A: You know, this kind of. And what I like about it, it's kind of like, you know, again, surrealism juxtaposing two opposite realities in a new context. Well, here are two separate realities in the context of basically an art piece, an image. So using the framing device, is that new context. Interesting. Here's another interesting work. And kind of, like, jarring a little bit.
00:26:58.830 - 00:27:25.162, Speaker A: Hey, this abstract work by tux. Now, you may remember tewks from. And I think I have. Yeah. You remember this work? Who did? I think I brought up their tooks object here, remember? You know, so we've actually been. This piece here. So tooks plays a lot with just abstraction, but with different kind of means, different mediums, you might even say, or different methods, you know, pixel art, I think.
00:27:25.162 - 00:27:48.334, Speaker A: I'm not sure if there is AI in here or not. See what I mean? Like, just playing with abstraction in the digital sphere. And so here is a new piece using glitch AI, digital collage and painting techniques to visualize the Internet dream. So that is pretty profound. So just kind of interesting. Available on Solana. So interesting.
00:27:48.334 - 00:28:13.674, Speaker A: Another multi chain artist. And I just thought this was funny, this work by Turkirak. Someone waking up from their Internet dream. Okay, so anyways, here's some of Tuke's work on exchange art. So, yeah, so here's. I think this is ungated way to get on Solana, if you're looking. So maybe I'll start here, put on my massive list of things to do.
00:28:13.674 - 00:28:45.104, Speaker A: So that is Tuks Louis Osborne with a new piece and taking offers. I did not look at his twitter, but always just interesting to follow his work. Looks like a lot of fun is being had here with red wine and drinks and everything else. So. And then you see the reaction of the person. So another original way of doing things and kind of interesting. Also see the background with this graph paper and then the movement of the.
00:28:45.104 - 00:29:14.188, Speaker A: You know, there's kind of like this rough kind of brush texture here that is also moving. So you put it all together and it just all comes together. It overwhelms the brain, basically, right? So in other words, it overwhelms the brain. So you just accept that reality that Lewis Osborne is presenting here. So you can see the offers as low as nine, as high as 25. Edition of 25. So interesting a work by francoise gamma.
00:29:14.188 - 00:29:29.320, Speaker A: We have a couple here. So this is the high res version. Tr. So interesting. You know, always interesting experimentation with Francoise. Here's the low res version called abspel. So interesting just to compare.
00:29:29.320 - 00:29:46.280, Speaker A: Right. As we. You know, phenomenologically, I don't even. Now, I was going to say, I don't even know what that word means, but I actually think I do. It's how we experience. Experience, I believe, is what phenomenology is. As I was saying, as we phenomenologically go through.
00:29:46.280 - 00:30:34.594, Speaker A: You know, again, you don't need to. And I'm not talking about anybody's work here, but we don't need to love every work that we look at here. Part of it is just to understand what's going on out there so that we can have a better grasp of the experimentation that is part of the spirit of this program, I want you to know, but here is a great work. I love this work, actually, by Edmorola, Phil. Now, can you tell what's going on here? What I love about it is it looks ancient, because this looks like someone filling their water vase. And Ed has this weird, like, he has kind of like an ancient greek vase or just even prehistoric vases that he's referenced in the past. So you gotta love that contrast of prehistoric humanity with pixelation.
00:30:34.594 - 00:30:51.086, Speaker A: A wonderful contrast. So that is available for 20 tezos. A one of one from Ed Morolla. You gotta love his what? His nicely priced pixel art. One of ones. You gotta love it. Smoking is a smoker.
00:30:51.086 - 00:31:14.804, Speaker A: Smoking smoker. And again, this could be ancient as well. And it looks like he's using some of his sampled crayon technique. So again, always interesting with Ed Marolla, part of the Marolla's art shop series, and one of my personal favorites, bite by bit, who also does those printer works that we see. Thank you. And all that. So here is a nebula.
00:31:14.804 - 00:31:40.894, Speaker A: And what is this one? The Calabash Nebula, also known as the rotten egg Nebula. So that is a one of one, also available only for nine tezos. And the little Ghost Nebula is a planetary nebula located in the constellation ophiucus. And some more details there. So I'm just a huge fan of this series. Continue to be. Now, look at this.
00:31:40.894 - 00:32:08.808, Speaker A: I thought this was hilarious. So there's a lot of things going on here. First of all, we have what looks like a trading card, right? Like OPG or tops or whatever. It looks like it's been modified, not like it looks like a collage in a trading card. Then the background is moving, so it's kind of like a gif. In this case, it's a movie. It has the container, which I've done drawings, like my nostalgia studies series.
00:32:08.808 - 00:32:49.308, Speaker A: I've actually done, like, Jose canseco trading cards. I've used the same concept, basically, where you. Where you also portray this part, like the mint condition or the grading and all that. Now, this person, Edgku, has a completely different way of doing things, though. Look at the music. Like, this, isn't it? I just think that, like, hilarious. Like, you know, what is this? So it's talking about basketball.
00:32:49.308 - 00:33:34.074, Speaker A: So maybe it makes perfect sense. And I'm just the clued out one, as per usual, Steph, with Curry's holographic five of five has this sold out. Not listed yet. So pretty cool music, too. I wonder who maybe that person made the music so again, we're seeing this interesting fusion of music and visual art in the NFT space by virtue of the medium and the technology. Continuing on, Michael Macasso Mech TXT you know, I always point out his landscapes, which I think are wonderful. And I've already pointed out that contrast that I love of organic curvilinear shapes with pixelated rectilinear, you know, pixels.
00:33:34.074 - 00:34:12.406, Speaker A: But he has been doing all these other busts of famous people, and this one, I think works particularly well and has this great red. I love the color on it too, and maybe the color, I think he might have changed it to red from blue on a lot of these. And for some reason, this red and yellow, it seems to work a little bit more for me. In my universe, everybody has their opinions, but I just thought this was a really nice piece. Again, these things you could screen print till, you know, edition of 100 and sell that stuff out and make a nice little business. So you pixel artists out there, static pixel artwork. Yeah.
00:34:12.406 - 00:34:41.274, Speaker A: And I'm also telling that to myself, as I tell you yet again, exploring uncharted waters, which is always encouraged, trying to make some sketches with a couple of my old drawings meshed into one. This dumb flu isn't enough to stop me from my adventures yet. Well, get well soon. Mech txt we love your work, as you know, and continue with the experimentation. I think it's looking good. This almost looks like an asteroid or something. So it's kind of this weird pixel art impressionism.
00:34:41.274 - 00:34:58.034, Speaker A: Look at this. Quilla Nina has finally minted her first piece, 100% digital piece. Maybe my genesis on procreate amoniser. I hope I'm pronouncing that right. Amoniser. Amoneser. Amonikir.
00:34:58.034 - 00:35:24.002, Speaker A: Huge resolution here. Edition of ten for five tezos each. This collection will be featuring small houses in the mountains. Link in comments so I picked this up, it was twelve tezos on secondary. I think it is now sold out. And yeah, I'm not going to reload it because sometimes that kills my mic here. But I'm sure you could put an offer in if people picked it up only for five, so.
00:35:24.002 - 00:35:49.640, Speaker A: And I think there are some flippers that get her work. So you could still get it. Yeah. So she's just got that kind of. I don't know if you'd call it magical realism. I usually think of that as, is it Georges Louis Borges? Or am I getting that name right? That famous magical realist novelist. What is the name of that book? I want to call it a thousand something.
00:35:49.640 - 00:36:07.990, Speaker A: Anyways, it kind of has that south american magical realism vibe to it, doesn't it? Always kind of a mystical thing. Tezos on the house here. So great work. Quilanja. Excited. You know. You know, I've showed my reservations for physical works as nfts and I don't want to stop anybody from doing that.
00:36:07.990 - 00:36:34.572, Speaker A: I totally encourage anybody to do whatever they want. It's free world. But for me personally, I'm all over Quila Nina doing digital work. Continuing on airs of victory mot Mt. Motemt, who's very fun and interesting to watch, has an auction on. It's at 42 tezos for this one of one the hall of vanguard with a soccer sweater, some stussy. So again, that contemporary clothing.
00:36:34.572 - 00:36:53.612, Speaker A: Huge fan of that stuff. Interesting floor. I mean, this is like a renaissance. This looks like it was borrowed from like a Raphael at the bottom or something. Not sure about that, but yeah, interesting. I'm all for that. That is, to me, that makes it very interesting.
00:36:53.612 - 00:37:21.000, Speaker A: So signature and all. Every victory is celebrated in honor of those who are no longer with us. Airs of victory. I really like mote or Mt's poetry. I find him a very poetic and kind of a moving artist. Diego Barrow, whose work we were looking at yesterday at who was the Mexico art fair or something. GM friends, nice week for all wishing to mint new artwork tomorrow.
00:37:21.000 - 00:37:49.952, Speaker A: So this is looking good. A beautiful work here. I love the green background and just kind of a pretty work in Diego's style. So heads up there. Heads up and shout out to Diego Barrow. So of course, these shows are going too long. I'm going to wrap up here and we are wrapping up as we go into AI, but unknown collector, my favorite collector artist put out a little thread here and I'm going to zoom through part of it.
00:37:49.952 - 00:38:27.002, Speaker A: Are we really an art community? I think it's time to tell you a little more about my first minted untitled artwork from some months ago. This artwork was partly a personal social experiment for the space, so this was made in raw AI, meaning there was no alterations in Photoshop m I art. And I was thinking, you know, unknown collector is going Duchamp on us. And there, sure enough, this inspiration behind this piece was Fountain of Duchamp. I'm not sure if you know this piece, but short summary. By using the readymade urinal, he showed that art is not defined uniquely by its aesthetic, but by its concept. Art is thought provoking.
00:38:27.002 - 00:39:01.666, Speaker A: So I'm not going to go through all of this, but all to say, let's go here. So I want to make a statement. I want to achieve the most simple, raw AI piece that I could think of that naturally evokes the feeling of rejection. It doesn't look like art. It's white background with black words. What? It's what is so special about it? So anyways, we can't read the whole thing here, but he was working with mid journey, and this was basically, he was basically saying his social experiment. I was almost sure that because I'm a big collector, nobody will criticize this work.
00:39:01.666 - 00:39:23.354, Speaker A: I chose an exorbitant prize. It's reference to the first ever super rare piece sold, which was an AI piece, and the last secondaries to sell for 100 ETH. And I chose the simplest visuals I could think of. And I am sure the combination awoke some skeptic and shaking heads from people that saw this piece, but nobody dared to criticize it. This is what I was trying to get to here. I'm sure there were some people thinking, no, this is not art. This is stupid.
00:39:23.354 - 00:40:18.042, Speaker A: So he's sort of bringing out, because he's a big collector, people are not going to criticize. I think it's kind of bad form to directly criticize artwork. I mean, he's sort of saying, you know, we need criticism, is what he goes on to say. I just encourage you to go to unknown collectors, Twitter, give him a follow, and like. But he's basically saying, isn't that what that's all about, looking at art, talking about it positively and negatively, starting discussions and learning about yourself and the world? Are we maybe just like an add on chat to the art marketplace? Is this a pure, toxic, positive promotion platform for art? I think it's a valid question. Like, in a sense, to me, I celebrate art that I like by talking about art that I like and that I think is interesting. So in a sense, it's kind of a guilt by omission, if anything.
00:40:18.042 - 00:40:54.794, Speaker A: And that's not to say if I don't cover it, that I just might not know about art. And I can't cover everything here either, even everything I like. So don't think because I don't cover it that it's, you know, again, but basically. But if I don't love an art piece, I'm basically not gonna call attention to it because I don't think it's worth our time, in a sense, unless there's some. And I'm very kind of, I like to think, in my universe, fairly humble as an artist. I understand how hard it is. So that's why, I may even look, bring up artworks here that are maybe not my favorite artworks in the world, but I can see there's something interesting going on there.
00:40:54.794 - 00:41:37.544, Speaker A: And that should be pointed out, this is a salon of sorts here, so at least that's what I aspire for here. So anyways, interesting piece. And then someone chimed in, who is it, Zack? And he said, if I had seen it, I would have spared my, I wouldn't have spared my words. I have been in the field for almost two years and I have seen that nothing is related to art here. You can see the high priced manipulative buying, selling transactions of some artist collector groups, depending on the population. So that is a part of this kind of NFT world we're in, too. And I think people, you know, I always say assume the best, but people tend to assume the worst.
00:41:37.544 - 00:42:34.494, Speaker A: And if you ever want proof of that, generally when we walk down the street, I would argue on a primal level, we do tend to reduce people to their weakest link. So if someone is wearing, you know, dirty jogging pants, we will reduce them to that. And so people do assume the worst. And I think when people, outsiders of the NFT scene look at the NFT scene, oftentimes in terms of the masses, they will be assuming the worst. And so I think, and so when they see this sort of stuff going on, which is probably true, it just kind of confirms their previous beliefs that the NFT scene can be ignored. What I would say to people feeling this way, though, is maybe you should watch this program because I think there's a lot going on here and nobody's really getting rich on tezos, not even myth. So maybe I'd direct you over here and then shout us some comments here and tell us what you think.
00:42:34.494 - 00:43:01.734, Speaker A: Because in a sense, that's the beauty of Tezos to a certain degree, is because there's not as much money involved. It really is about the art for the most part. Right. And we love the market here, too. And I have no problem with the business of art. It's fascinating. As someone pointed out, I think it was oxyou know, good art is business art, as Andy Warhol said, or good, what is it? Good business is good art or good art is business art or something like that.
00:43:01.734 - 00:43:38.984, Speaker A: In the ABCs of Andy Warhol or the Philosophy of Andy Warhol, one of those two books. I remember reading that a GM from Charles AI. I think we've seen this work before, but I just wanted to, it's good to return to works, too, because Charles AI has just made another sale on super rare, this time for two ETH $3,250 for his AI work here. So he is going from summit to summit, captured falls, almost playing with this indoor outdoor kind of vibe. So congratulations to Charles AI, who is doing very well. And that, my friends, finally is our show. Thank you for joining me and until next time, take care.
