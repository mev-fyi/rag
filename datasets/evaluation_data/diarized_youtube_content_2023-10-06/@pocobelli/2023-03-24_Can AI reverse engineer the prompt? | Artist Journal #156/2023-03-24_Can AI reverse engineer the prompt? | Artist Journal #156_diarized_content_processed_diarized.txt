00:00:05.480 - 00:00:42.270, Speaker A: We are back, ladies and gentlemen, sailing through this world on a Friday, a wonderful Friday, to gaze upon the sea. Here from Berlin, Germany, Artist Journal, March 24, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from the ship in my mind on the high seas of the imagination. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Welcome. Welcome back to our one of a kind show here. I probably should have been announcing wrestling matches for a living, but here I am talking to you.
00:00:42.270 - 00:01:01.304, Speaker A: No living being made here yet. But maybe one day, my friends, maybe one day. The subscribers keep funneling in here. It's a battle, you know, it is a great battle here, one subscriber at a time. So anyways, welcome back, everybody. Let's get to it. Try and keep these shorter.
00:01:01.304 - 00:01:41.164, Speaker A: But with, you know, incredible works like this by Ratcloak, it is hard. They are dark. So yesterday I thought the, the little fragment that we saw here of this very dark area of this work by Ratcloak, I thought that was the entire painting. But it turns out it is this much larger work and much more complex work with a very dark work. And we're going to go up close here in a second. Of course, it's hard to look at ratcloak's work and not think of Ukraine and not sure if he likes us to think of it in that context, but it's just so hard. I mean, nobody can imagine really what that's like.
00:01:41.164 - 00:02:04.542, Speaker A: But we can look at the work and maybe explain some of the darkness here. Although these hanging figures, this hanging figure here. And, yeah, I find it disturbing. But, I mean, a lot of great art is disturbing. They predate, they go back a couple of years. So it's not unique to the last year or so. But we do see an army figure here.
00:02:04.542 - 00:02:40.668, Speaker A: We see a cartoon figure here, and we see just kind of like a run of the mill figure here, someone with their backpack that could be on an U Bahn in a subway in Berlin. And also this could be out of a protest in Berlin here with the police taking down the figure. Let's take a closer look. And this mysterious figure here in the middle with the fedora sitting on a lawn chair with rubber boots, it kind of has all the trademarks. Looking down the rabbit hole here has all the trademarks of a rat cloak. And particularly, let's actually zoom in. Maybe we can get rid of that.
00:02:40.668 - 00:03:10.076, Speaker A: You know what I love about Ratcloak's work, and let's go to a different part here for my benefit. You know what I love is this flatness of the sky. This is trademark a rat cloak here. And he does it here, too, in the road. This flatness contrasts with, say, all the detail that's going on in the figure here. That is trademark rat cloak. And even this stripe here, which at first looks like sidewalk.
00:03:10.076 - 00:03:38.004, Speaker A: But then you realize this is road, a painted line in the road. Let's go up close here and see this figure with the raiders. So just full of symbolism. One's tempted to think and look at this, you know, trademark kind of Microsoft paint detailing. I was not sure. I mean, I feel like perhaps this is a hybrid of Microsoft paint and maybe another app he's using. But maybe it's just Microsoft paint.
00:03:38.004 - 00:04:10.264, Speaker A: I mean, this would be pretty expertly done using Microsoft paint. I mean, that is next level. So I'm not sure. But I mean, this sort of kind of textures here does sort of, you know, shout Microsoft paint, which is kind of trademark. How he sort of built his reputation, one would argue. And anyways, but then we see here a bit more gradients and stuff, so I'm not sure if it's more than one. We were discussing that yesterday on the detail and all sorts of wild details here.
00:04:10.264 - 00:04:51.910, Speaker A: So, anyways, quite a stunning work by ratcloak. And these basically look like bombed out buildings. You sometimes see churches. There are churches in Berlin at, you know, Krfirstendamstrasse, where there's like a half bombed out church. And to, you know, the government of Berlin's credit in the last 50 years, they did keep these because they're, you know, it's kind of a non finito in a certain sort of way. You know, the central image of romantic literature, capital r, romantic literature, as far as I understand, is the ruin, the half, the ancient building that's kind of half destroyed. So here we see basically ruins.
00:04:51.910 - 00:05:22.820, Speaker A: And there is a, you know, as dark as it might be, there is a poetry in the ruin, at least according to the romantics. And so there you go. So let's keep going here. Actually, let's look at the market quickly because he sold it for quite a bit of money for a Tezos edition. I mean, Ratcloaks. Ratcloak. See, Ratcloak is a pretty prominent artist, but 75 tezos, and it sold very quickly here in 20 minutes at 75 tezos, each, like $100 each addition of ten.
00:05:22.820 - 00:05:51.750, Speaker A: So a quick. I mean, tempted to say quick thousand dollars, but this probably took a while to make, one would imagine. But who knows? Not sure about the title here. But anyway, really cool work and big shout out to Ratcloak. Who retweeted this show, like, very early on. He was one of the first people to actually just kind of help this show along. So, anyways, great to see him still making art and still kind of wowing.
00:05:51.750 - 00:06:06.480, Speaker A: So anyways, just a couple of comments. Stephen Sugarman, shout out to Steven. Great to see you're watching, too. We were talking about joa in's work yesterday, karenika. Absolutely. So, Stephen, Steven Sigarman is in agreement. And also a comment from Rada.
00:06:06.480 - 00:06:31.658, Speaker A: Thank you so much for the spotlight. Never miss the show, which is pretty rad, as me and JrD was saying, in the spaces that are going on Spotify and those are going, I just edited another one today. Rada is the guy who kind of brought us into tezos. It was his art, his pixel art. Learned a lot and always appreciate what you do for the community. Likewise, Rada. So great to hear.
00:06:31.658 - 00:06:51.446, Speaker A: So just on this guernica. Absolutely. This is the work after yesterday's show. It's kind of funny. I was going, you know, washing my hands and looking in the bathroom mirror, but this is what I saw. I was like, this is the work that really reminds me of Joa in's work. And so, anyways, I thought I'd share that.
00:06:51.446 - 00:07:11.204, Speaker A: I was like, it just kind of locked. I was like, what is the work? This is the work. So this is, of course, Pablo Picasso, dancer. So the plot thickens on that little AI mystery. I was thinking to myself, actually, before we go to Slava Triangle, not slave, angel. It's Slava triangle. Thank you for the message yesterday, Slava.
00:07:11.204 - 00:08:01.404, Speaker A: What was I going to say here? This is what I was going to say. I was sort of wondering to myself, at what point is the AI going to be able to figure out what the text prompt is, where you give it the image? I mean, maybe it can already do this, but where it can reverse engineer the text prompt from the image? Is that possible? Surely that's going to happen at some point, and that will be very interesting. You know, these. These prompts that are basically generally kept secret, these prompt engineers, their secrets may be, as I rub my hands here, like Mister Burns, these prompts may be revealed at some point. Who knows? But one would assume. So Slava triangle messaged me yesterday. There is a right click.
00:08:01.404 - 00:08:22.216, Speaker A: Save robbery. So let me just make this bigger here. So someone, let's just. I'll just read it out here. Offensive thing, a confusing scheme, one bit. Loops that I've been making and selling for a year on Tazos have been sold again through a site that I have not seen before. It was ETH mint and collection volume on OpenSeA.
00:08:22.216 - 00:08:43.096, Speaker A: And it was an ETH mint and collection volume on Opensea is now more than eight ETH. So someone took. And I think I have some of these works here from Tazos. Yeah, this. This is one of my favorite, actually, if you can see this one in the bottom left here with the car. Fantastic work. So, yeah.
00:08:43.096 - 00:09:22.124, Speaker A: There is also a possibility that the primary fast mint of 222 items was a manipulation in an artificially created hype. And most sales on secondary market can also belong to the scammer wallet. And then, like, this was a sophisticated scam loops by Peter Dimitrov. So I guess there's enough people out there don't. That don't know who Slava triangle is. So then Peter Dmitrov, who was credited for these scam loops, had to put out a message. Today I found out that someone is impersonating me in order to create, promote and sell a new NFT collection.
00:09:22.124 - 00:09:47.650, Speaker A: This is so off the wall that you can't help but kind of like, marvel at this. I mean, please be careful and be aware. I have not created any of that, and I'm not endorsing any of it. And as Slava Triangle says, also, Peter Dimitrov, who is listed as the author, has nothing to do with this. And his name and links to contract details were just taken to form. Taken from form information about the collection. So, pretty wild stuff.
00:09:47.650 - 00:10:03.494, Speaker A: So anyways, Slava Triangle asked me if I could make a PSA public service announcement. And I'm more than happily. I mean, it's a. It's an amazing story. And you got a feel for the people that collected. I mean, that's a lot of money. 80th volume.
00:10:03.494 - 00:10:27.870, Speaker A: So anyway, all to say, be careful out there. And there is a. A limited edition that the real Slava triangle is putting out on app. Manifold. I'm sorry, Manifold XYZ. And it is called scammer edition of 50 at 0088 ETH. So pretty cheap burn to redeem event with no time limit soon.
00:10:27.870 - 00:10:47.540, Speaker A: And here is the work. So, yeah, so there's the stolen collection. So a quick response from Slava triangle. Not slave angel, as I've been saying here, thanks for being a good sport. Rata has a similar message here. Beware of copy mentors, fishers and fake links. Rata.
00:10:47.540 - 00:11:11.884, Speaker A: WTF is a safe place to find all my creations for now, always double check. Also recently did some updates. Goodnight. For real this time. And so this is rata. WTF? I believe crypto artist, crypto rattus. Okay, so anyways, just double check everything, especially when you start to go off these main websites.
00:11:11.884 - 00:11:40.664, Speaker A: Okay, so continuing on, Sabato retweeted this, and I thought it was really cool. Andre Oliver Acebola, if I'm pronouncing that right, glitchbox revolution. Visuals generated through creative coding. Arduino, which can be triggered independently on the screen one by one, or be combined according to the audience's wishes. This work will be on exhibition in Buenos Aires for a month. Thanks, Artdao XYZ Museum of crypto for the opportunity. And here it is.
00:11:40.664 - 00:12:11.164, Speaker A: I wonder if there's volume. No, there is not. But anyways, it looks like, you know, Pong, and you see these, like this ancient, what's tempted to be called, like an ancient joystick, but not quite. It's probably just some sort of controller of certain kinds. Anyways, of. Pretty interesting, isn't it? Almost back to that crossover of video mixing. And we're going to go back to that artist who was super cool that we looked at yesterday, who just released, I think, some new work.
00:12:11.164 - 00:12:39.278, Speaker A: So continuing on, look at this sale, because some people, I guess, are, there's a lot of this money talk. I guess it's a topical subject. I just thought it was something that was coming up, so I brought it up. But it actually sounds quite topical. And as we're going to see, it sounds like some people are actually leaving the NFT scene. But I wanted to highlight this. This, you know, x copy just made a huge sale of $618,000 for this work.
00:12:39.278 - 00:13:09.584, Speaker A: I believe from 2019. We'll look in a second. I wonder if we can make this larger. I will risk it. I was having mic problems yesterday. It's always fun to look up close at these works, isn't it? I think it's really added to this show, actually, the zoom in because you really see where the rubber meets the road here. And, yeah, so there is the Xcopy and you see some dithering here and the roughness, you know, again, we see that kind of rough, you know, it's tempted to be calling messiness and axing, too.
00:13:09.584 - 00:13:46.594, Speaker A: It's an interesting contrast, the digital pixelation and everything, with the kind of organic, you know, movement of, say, a hand on a wacom or with a apple pen or whatever the case might be. So, yeah, $618,000. And how does that make you feel? So maybe slightly sarcastic, dark work, perhaps? XCopy 2018. Pretty nice piece. And yeah, look at this person, too. Crowvault. This person here, final offer, Nomo wreath is the person who is making the bids.
00:13:46.594 - 00:14:13.068, Speaker A: And they started March 15 at 300 and March 10 at 320, and they had to have it. And so they kept going up to 355 ETH, $618,000. At which point, final offer, no more ETH. I don't. I think they sold it because he accepted and then. Yeah, and then final offer from Crow vault. Crow vault accepted it.
00:14:13.068 - 00:14:46.838, Speaker A: Final offer, no more ETH. Sent it to their curated vault. So anyways, things are happening out here. This is super interesting. So a lot of, you know, art gnome is a prominent figure in the NFT space. A very, very early person on the scene, pretty friendly guy on Twitter now, part of he runs probably with other people, club NFT. And he kind of, you know, blew the whistle, as he says, on this idea of safeguarding your nfts.
00:14:46.838 - 00:15:16.884, Speaker A: And this is actually pretty interesting to almost everybody who might watch this. Today's news about ledger. And this is a ledger here. This is a ledger for those that don't know. This is for storing your crypto in cold storage. Today's news about the ledger, club NFT integration is in part about validation. When we first blew the whistle about off chain NFT assets, many people thought club NFT was nuts to have the number one brand in NFT security acknowledge.
00:15:16.884 - 00:15:35.476, Speaker A: Club NFT is amazing. So this is interesting, a way of kind of backing up your NFT. So it definitely has my attention. It sounds free as well. And here's the announcement on Ledger's website. Club NFT joins Ledger live. Protect your nfts no matter what.
00:15:35.476 - 00:16:09.690, Speaker A: So for those of us, for those of us that are playing the long game here, as far as our art collections, you probably want to check this out. I'm going to check it out because it sounds like an awesome way to, you know, secure. Because who knows? I mean, maybe ipfs goes down at some point, you just don't know. So you might as well. I mean, if you're going to spend all this money on buying stuff, you might as well secure it. So club NFT and Ledger is the search, is the query. And Estelle Flores, just kind of an interesting note here.
00:16:09.690 - 00:16:33.414, Speaker A: Today is a very important day for me in this journey. I've been learning code for a few months now, and this certainly feels like a breakthrough. Thanks, everybody, that helped me along the way. Here's my first code work on FX hash night vision. So this is pure code and it shows that you can do it if you apply yourself. And I think we have others here, mint for fortasos. And you can see other works here.
00:16:33.414 - 00:16:50.414, Speaker A: So all with code, from what I understand here. So that is pretty cool. So that is Estelle Flores. Night vision is the name of the series. So pretty cool. Generative art. Human boy put out another beautiful gallery here.
00:16:50.414 - 00:17:17.568, Speaker A: I think human boy has a talent for this, because remember the ilay one, I believe that was human boy, and that one looked. I find usually these galleries, for me personally, they seem too cramped and crowded. But somehow human boys seem to look at this like, see how the. Let me just make it big. Somehow human boy seems to avoid that, even though these works are close together. But because they're all related, often works will not be related. And so there's a logic.
00:17:17.568 - 00:17:43.830, Speaker A: So I don't know, I think human boy seems to really know what he's doing when it comes to this gallery thing, and he seems to have a passion for it. So that is noted over here. Just finished my biggest gallery yet. This one is going to strange system, so it's full of sculptures and gifs. Give a minute or two to load, make sure you check out all the amazing artists. So I'm going to stick with the GiF here so it doesn't crash my computer. But anyway, I'm pretty impressed.
00:17:43.830 - 00:18:01.680, Speaker A: So that is cool. From human boy. And another show in the metaverse here. The metaverse has not died, ladies and gentlemen. Maybe it will one day, but it hasn't died quite yet. We have another virtual gallery, this time from shino Pixel Friends number one. Hi fellow art lovers and artists.
00:18:01.680 - 00:18:30.868, Speaker A: I'm proud to present my art exhibition format, Pixel Friends. The first edition will showcase Michael Macasso Mech TXT, the Owl King, I believe you'd say that. And nine, four L1 pixel artists. The opening will take place in my spatial IO virtual gallery on the 28 March at 04:00 p.m. So that is coming right up in a few days here. So that is cool. And there is mech TXT, and there's 94 l one.
00:18:30.868 - 00:18:55.240, Speaker A: And there's the owl king. It looks like they're all going to go beautifully together. So see you in the metaverse, maybe. And there you can be so not dead yet. And look at this brilliant work of art by Michael Macasso here. A beautiful, beautiful work if you haven't seen it. And just very quickly here, unknown collector commenting on how people are leaving the space.
00:18:55.240 - 00:19:18.390, Speaker A: Unknown talks how to stay inside the space. We've seen a lot of great people leave the space recently, and it's sad to see. I actually haven't noticed any, but sometimes I'm the last person to notice these things. And I just kind of have. Maybe I'm in a tunnel on Twitter, but I actually haven't seen any of the artists announce that they're leaving. But I don't doubt it's happening, though. So I thought I'd write a little thread about how to keep sane here.
00:19:18.390 - 00:19:39.734, Speaker A: This is my personal opinion. Think about it critically. And. Yeah, there's. Yeah, so this kind of feeds into what we just saw with the scam of Slava triangle. This space is full of grifters and bad actors that are throwing their shadow on our principles for making a quick buck and gaining power. Yeah, there is so much money in this space.
00:19:39.734 - 00:20:13.664, Speaker A: I mean, we just saw with the x copy, $618,000 that there's a lot of money going around here. So it's going to attract some shady characters. We can't change that directly, but indirectly. That's why I focus on what we can do instead of what others need to change. And basically, motivation of being here, expectations, individual contribution. This kind of feeds into yesterday's discussion on what was the name of that, you know, this is more than, you know, stakes are more. Are bigger than money or something to that effect.
00:20:13.664 - 00:20:52.578, Speaker A: Just focus on your art and what you like and don't overextend yourself as a collector. I mean, it can happen. I've been there and just, you know, just focus on the. I think as long as we're all focused on the art and then the money is just kind of there, then it's a beautiful place to be again. The money is a wonderful problem to have that there is money in this space because as someone that's gone to Berlin art openings, you know, for years, not so much these days, although I think I'm going to start going more. But before the pandemic, going all the time, there's not a ton of money going around. Even in Berlin galleries.
00:20:52.578 - 00:21:42.266, Speaker A: It's not like there's a lot of. It's not known for having a lot of sales. You go to cologne or you go to even Munich, maybe Frankfurt. But Berlin, you know, so all this, you know, money focus, I just remind people it's a wonderful problem to have. Now, I think unknown collector is saying other things. So I focus on the art, and it's actually, there are sales being made here, so, yeah, so I think that's great. Now, I think part of the reason, I suspect this is just my theory of why people might be leaving the space and maybe why I don't know about them is because remember, we were seeing Grant Riven Yun with his triangle yesterday, and he had PFPs at the top and then generative art in the middle, and then one of one at the fulcrum here at the bottom of the triangle and one of one PfP.
00:21:42.266 - 00:22:20.454, Speaker A: So I wonder if the top of that triangle is starting to have issues because, I mean, doodles, and I don't want to spend a ton of time on this, but these used to be like ten ETH floor like lowest price. Now they're at 3.36. So these have gone from like $20,000 to maybe six, maybe $25,000 to six. And as you see here, see the chart here. Now, average price is 3.68 ETH of a sale, you know, and things are going for $3.46 thousand, which some might still find outrageous.
00:22:20.454 - 00:23:05.132, Speaker A: And this is another collection moonbird. So we're part of this bigger ecosystem here. And there could be, you know, ramifications for, you know, this used to be like 20 or 30 ETH, I mean, $100,000 and now it's at like 6500. These are going for these moonbirds. So, you know, I wonder how much this might be. You know, people throwing in the towel, kind of just, I'm done with this PFP thing. Maybe they spent $15,000 or $20,000 on one of these and they're losing their shirt, who knows? But just kind of putting that into that conversation about perhaps people leaving and maybe that's related.
00:23:05.132 - 00:23:34.178, Speaker A: Just speculation, RJ. So also commenting on the space, and I love how reflective the space is on itself. Again, every 24 hours it feels like a novel has happened here. RJ. Morning, morning, 6 hours left on cultural logic and want to do a quick little background thread to read alongside a GM coffee. So he has this work here, and I believe it's available on foundation the cultural logic of web3 production only three minted. And it's going to end in 2 hours.
00:23:34.178 - 00:24:07.910, Speaker A: So you might not be able to get one by the time this is up and going because it takes about an hour and a half. So maybe if you run and you're watching this as soon as it's released. So if you're following along at all, you'll know. A lot of my work has investigated the ideas of computers standing in for people. See, for example, night screens in computer and void, where Hopper and Hockney's figures are replaced by laptops. The metamorphosis. GPT took this further and had AI write the narrative of a human turned into computer, something which sought to investigate the blurring of the lines between the two as the computer gains the ability to create language independently.
00:24:07.910 - 00:24:55.642, Speaker A: And finally, cultural logic follows this thinking. The name of this series here, but does so to ask what's going on for the human in this space in particular, where does the constant pressure to produce, to market, to sell, lead us? If the human and computer can be blurred, then the answer is to a cracked screen. If you felt in any way broken by the demands or keeping up in web3, then you may well identify with this computer. Now, remember, we were talking about deltasauce, or deltasauce had that comment kind of to a similar effect. Just a final. Well, we see it all here and, you know, but I guess I don't worry about this stuff. Like, I mean, and maybe again, it's this over focusing on the money.
00:24:55.642 - 00:25:39.860, Speaker A: It's. Again, it's a great problem to have. And I think maybe, like, the kind of, like, the kind of the most positive mindset you can have in this space, from my perspective, is to focus on the art and take every sale as a kind of gift. Because, again, people leaving the space, let's say you're an artist and you leave the space. Like, where are you going? Is all I'm asking you. Where are you going? Are you gonna go into, like, the Berlin art scene and then you're gonna start selling, even make $50, you know? So that's kind of where I'm coming from. So I come out of that scene to a certain degree, and, yeah, I go, this is.
00:25:39.860 - 00:26:04.290, Speaker A: I'm still in the promised land here. I can post a work and it sells within a minute or two minutes, and I get, you know, $100. I'm laughing, but maybe I just have really low expectations. I don't know. I love it, you know, and I can even keep building my sales and everything. So, yeah, so, yeah, just counsel whomever, if you're getting worried about it. Focus on your art, because that's all that really matters in the long run.
00:26:04.290 - 00:26:26.574, Speaker A: Money's great and it matters, but it's not everything, and it shouldn't be your primary focus. Anyways, I may have to mint one of these. Only three have been minted. It's very cheap at 0.025. So what is that? Probably $50. And this really cool print or work by RJ. So very cool, super bright has got one mark head and not a number.
00:26:26.574 - 00:26:55.814, Speaker A: Shout out to not a number and to RJ, who is awesome. So, anyways, let's run through this episode here. So artistsutu someone I've never seen before. This just sold on super rare for, I think, three and a half for three and a half for $3,500. So two ETH and let's just get the volume here. Cool music. Inspiring.
00:26:55.814 - 00:27:35.762, Speaker A: Very cool. You know, music for me is one of the big strengths of this space because I just hear something like that and I just get kind of excited. Great music. So t u on super rare. Very interesting. And this preview by gogolitis in collaboration with native Ed is also kind of seems to go kind of nicely with that whole kind of techno vibe. What if you could preserve your memories, record your dreams and share them? What implications would such an advancement hold? One could see technological revolution.
00:27:35.762 - 00:28:00.060, Speaker A: I mainly see it as the first step towards a philosophical disruption. Gotta love go go Litis. And I'm gonna have that episode up right away. Go go Litis is a very deep thinker from what I've heard and seen. And here he is. I mean, again, remember that other work that we're looking at and he's comparing it to Plato's cave? Those will be up on Spotify. I may do that one today.
00:28:00.060 - 00:28:26.238, Speaker A: I just put up rares. I will send out the lake when everything's ready. And that's coming in like days. A matter of days here. Anyways, nice preview from Gogolitis and native ed. Interesting solution too, because how do you collaborate, right? So here it's like, okay, let's make windows within the pixel art factory here. And I love how you even put native's signature, or maybe native Ed put it and then put native Ed's work in the windows.
00:28:26.238 - 00:28:51.690, Speaker A: Very cool collab and a philosophical work. Interestingly, also in kind of an interesting kind of dynamic, moving art that's just kind of moving around here. Demon ego. The phobia of having your worst creatures. Interesting title. And so, March 2023 by demon ego. Bid placed by the wire at .2
00:28:51.690 - 00:29:18.822, Speaker A: ETH. So it looks like this is on its way. 11 hours to go. So again, who wants to leave this space? I mean, I would focus on the positive sides here. The fact that there's money at all for our digital art is like an unbelievable miracle in my universe, you know, so. But it does, you know, kind of make you think, like, make work while you can and sell it while you can. You never know when things change.
00:29:18.822 - 00:29:59.364, Speaker A: The phobia of having the worst creatures. Anyways, cool work on foundation from demon ego. Interesting dithering here and just kind of, kind of playing with that style that we were seeing on object, but kind of a different black and white version. Ed Morolla, the Seeker edition of 15. This is for 20. So someone else who's kind of raised their prices, maybe it's just for this work, who knows? But we saw Ratcloak at 75, which turned my head and totally, justifiably, in my opinion, and Ed Marolla, because I've always just found it magically cheap, the art here. And now it's like, okay, these are starting to be like normal prices or what you'd expect.
00:29:59.364 - 00:30:18.988, Speaker A: But anyways, Edmorola, 20 tezos each, Seeker. And here is the work. Now, what's really cool about this, I'm going to show you, is he describes his process. So here it is. How many sold, by the way? I think like five. Let's just look. Or have any sold.
00:30:18.988 - 00:30:32.210, Speaker A: Maybe people aren't used to the new prices. Okay, people aren't used to the new prices yet. When was this? March 23. So yesterday. So people are not used to the. Well, let's see. You know, sometimes you just, you know, need to wait, too.
00:30:32.210 - 00:30:52.654, Speaker A: I mean, they probably all will sell. Sample some. So this is cool, though. Sample some Hieronymus Bosch art and sample it down to pixel size. So he goes through his process. So takes a fragment of Bosch, really cool, samples it down, and then let's see what he does. Make custom brushes.
00:30:52.654 - 00:31:23.946, Speaker A: So this is really cool. And I love how he's kind of sampling from the traditional, again, it's back to this kind of visual hip hop idea. It's kind of like sampling James Brown, a bass line of James Brown. And then, you know, and then you manipulate it, loop it, you know, add your drum machine, etcetera. Anyway, so what else does he say here? Make custom brushes. And so it looks like these are kind of fragments and like this. So takes these different things and you see.
00:31:23.946 - 00:31:43.842, Speaker A: Yeah, so as I call these samples, these are dragged samples, these brushes, and then you have fun. And here is your result. And this is also, I love how he's just revealing all. Use lots of blur and noise in the background, draw some eyes, and then it's not abstract anymore. Yeah. So he's revealing all. And here are the eyes.
00:31:43.842 - 00:32:00.852, Speaker A: And it goes from abstract to representational. So ed is sharing everything. And here is the link which we just looked at. So there it is. Edmarola Seeker on object. Another super cool work. Drum two m's, a one of one.
00:32:00.852 - 00:32:25.424, Speaker A: And let's see. And this was just transferred to mentalist. Maybe it was a commission. So pretty cool. Music here, too. Very cool music. And I assume he's made it himself.
00:32:25.424 - 00:32:46.824, Speaker A: Right? So the artist, the writer, the cinema maker, the movie maker, and the musician are all fusing here. Pretty cool. Love the vibe. And I even love how there's this little almost sequencer at the bottom here. Very cool. And the dithering kind of flows all around. So maybe a commission.
00:32:46.824 - 00:33:21.064, Speaker A: Here's another one, nanslate. And I can't remember, maybe it was gogolitis or edmarola. I think it was gogolitis who retweeted this. So just kind of more hanging figures, but this time, maybe it's not. It's just decoration here, these little ghosts here, and some flowers and some rain and a little kind of dithered paint, bit of paint that's kind of dripping down. Maybe wire city rain may pour down and clouds may darken the sky, but remember that the sun still shines bright above them. So maybe it is a bit a rain prevention doll.
00:33:21.064 - 00:33:35.216, Speaker A: Maybe that's what this is, are rain prevention dolls. Interesting colors. Interesting, you know, back to this. Pixel art as high art. Two tezos edition of 15. Still have five left. Mewgi continues to impress.
00:33:35.216 - 00:34:04.214, Speaker A: Bubblegum square, edible buildings, mint and tutti frutti flavored 356 by 480 x four. Made on retro software, among other processes. So, yeah, I think he uses deluxe paint, as we've seen in the past, and we see those kind of trademark gradients and some nice dithering and everything. I'll have to try that software. I'll add it on the infinite list of things to do. Kind of like the darkness here. So, pretty interesting planet.
00:34:04.214 - 00:34:32.720, Speaker A: Interesting work, eh? Kind of mysterious. My favorite word to explain many of these works here, r milk, 88 tired pixels. So it is Friday in pixel land here with armilk. And just another interesting work here with the bottles and everything. Kind of mysterious machines here. Trademark armilk. You can recognize, interestingly, the style just by looking at it.
00:34:32.720 - 00:34:48.700, Speaker A: You can tell the artist. So this looks sold out. And this sold for six tezos on primary. So it's. Again, these aren't cheap, but they are selling. And look at this. This, you know, will sell out in, like, 2 seconds.
00:34:48.700 - 00:35:17.678, Speaker A: I mean, Mandal, this is the death card from the tarot card. Another just gorgeous work in the color and even just the smart animation. I tell you, this cat tarot will, you know, I kind of get the sense it'll stand the test of time. Let's just put it that way. It's a nice. In my universe so far, what we've seen this is a nice contribution to the whole tarot deck tradition. This is a real contribution, which is quite something to do, you know, it's not easy.
00:35:17.678 - 00:35:46.220, Speaker A: So many people have tackled the tarot. I see a pretty nice contribution here. Let's read it quickly. Death, the 13th tarot card. The death tarot card exhorts you to do what you can do, to prevent what you can, to prevent what cannot be avoided, to do what is required, and to embrace what is inevitable represents a change in one's spirituality. Signals the conclusion of a significant stage in your life and the beginning of a new one. So maybe not all bad there.
00:35:46.220 - 00:36:06.954, Speaker A: 131 by 180. So you get a sense for the canvas size here. A nice little frame there, too. Beautiful. By manital, not for sale yet. Usually goes for like two tezos and sells out and 1 second, and then you have to pay like ten tezos on secondary. So Rada's auction here is progressing.
00:36:06.954 - 00:36:23.794, Speaker A: It is at 99 tezos, courtesy of axin. And so that is where it is. There are 8 hours to go. And this is for the x copy homage that we were looking at yesterday with the rat instead of the businessman. Really cool work. He did a good job. Peak green ginger.
00:36:23.794 - 00:36:42.768, Speaker A: So another interesting kind of pixel work from green ginger. A landscape and people traveling along the landscape. Really interesting canvas ratio here. Like very wide, you know, ratio here. So that is interesting. Peak pursuits. This is a special piece to commemorate materialization of abstraction.
00:36:42.768 - 00:37:13.648, Speaker A: On reaching 1000 tezos, volume traded. Interesting. Another one from stipend pixel prism for tranquility. More experimental work from stippin pixel. And it looks like we have palm trees here and a building, and just very interesting. I love how, like, he's just consistently tackling this theme here of, you know, playing with this, you know, dithering in different colors and everything. This rendering playing with pixel art as stippin pixel always does.
00:37:13.648 - 00:37:31.980, Speaker A: Here's another one from Paimon art. Just kind of an interesting piece that I thought, more pixel art. VFX hex shield. So just kind of a cool little animation. I also really like the canvas, almost like the Photoshop canvas in the background. Or maybe that's aseprite. So anyways, just kind of fun in passing there.
00:37:31.980 - 00:37:52.708, Speaker A: KaPn's gift shop with a few works here, lollipop used making, also with deluxe paint and gimp. So, yeah, we're gonna have to look at gimp. A lot of people love gimp, and it's free. So that is interesting. Kind of a free photoshop, from my understanding. Last I looked, which was like six years ago, maybe. Fudge brownie.
00:37:52.708 - 00:38:17.840, Speaker A: So a few more. One of ones for ten tezos, each from Kapn's gift shop. So here is some ceviche, which also maybe looks like a sweet dish. I mean, that almost looks like marshmallows, but maybe I have it wrong. But in this great background here, you can see black pixels on matte black. All to say, once you're done, you're going to need a toothbrush with that. And take care of business and take care of your dental hygiene.
00:38:17.840 - 00:38:40.500, Speaker A: Look at this beautiful rendering here. As we zoom in, can we zoom in even more? That's the max. Anyway, all still available, I believe, for ten tezos. Each one of ones from, you know, pixel art master Kappen. Sad girl with a cool work. Fractured. So again, sticking with the anime manga, glitchy.
00:38:40.500 - 00:39:08.524, Speaker A: Glitchy work. And, you know, it was some nice pixelation and rasterization and all those dithering in there, all those adjectives. So fractured by sad girl and then Lorna Mills with the work. This was kind of an interesting work. I mean, more experimentation. I still see Lorna Mills pushing her boundaries. This looks like someone making bread and then covering up hands with black.
00:39:08.524 - 00:39:20.284, Speaker A: A black. You know, we used to do this. My dad used to make bread. I think he still does. You punch the bread, the dough. They still make their own bread at my house. That is like an italian thing, maybe.
00:39:20.284 - 00:39:39.794, Speaker A: Anyways, it looks like someone making bread and the hands are masked out here in her trademark style. Tropic of petro. So kind of an interesting title there. Future patio lounge chair. So we're still outdoors here. We're enjoying spring with Eizo. So let's see what we have here.
00:39:39.794 - 00:40:00.518, Speaker A: So just more beautiful, beautiful textures with a super stylish. I feel like this is the price is right with a super stylish outdoor lawn chair, which includes a bench on the side. Future patio lounge chair one. Yeah, this is just like, the price is right here. Well, it's five tazos. Pretty reasonable. 23 left.
00:40:00.518 - 00:40:14.186, Speaker A: So this is probably just released. X mortal. Stay cool. So not sure if that's okay. So an old tv on the background. Remember exmortal just sold for like, 0.47 ETH on foundation.
00:40:14.186 - 00:40:35.304, Speaker A: So there is a real market for kind of glitch video art, to state the obvious. Anyway, here's a skull with sunglasses and a tv on the back and some interesting white noise. Stay cool. So did this sell out? It did. So things are going very well for exmortal for five tezos. Each and an edition of 15. Nice work.
00:40:35.304 - 00:40:59.944, Speaker A: Some very interesting work from Kurt Hussle collective. Keeping us guessing here. And it looks like they're still in Japan on vacation. Kurt Hussle collective Jnk and Terry visual and here's has rupaun. So this looks like jNk. So digging hustlepon. So digging the Tokyo vibe.
00:40:59.944 - 00:41:19.328, Speaker A: And here is terry visual. These are still available. Five tezos and collect them all. And why not have Haiti rocket in there hustling it? Hustle pon. And there he is enjoying his time. Maybe he's also in Tokyo. I'm starting to feel the FoMO guys edition of three.
00:41:19.328 - 00:41:44.170, Speaker A: So that one's a lot smaller. I imagine that was just sent to ad rocket. I know how you guys work. So saiko ihara artist and VJ so remember we were looking at this work yesterday, this artist, and we were seeing kind of like this pixelated work and everything. So here's just more work. And I just think this is a really interesting artist. So I just saw more on Twitter.
00:41:44.170 - 00:42:07.994, Speaker A: So I thought, let's show some more saiko ihara and was in a lit space, lit WTF and talking artists talking about their background. And I think there's another one here. GMJ flowers. This was collected. This is an anniversary NFt for launching GMJ exhibition in Tokyo. I'm glad flowers have a beautiful home now. Thank you so much again.
00:42:07.994 - 00:42:32.722, Speaker A: And here you even see Mutec which is an electronic music festival in Montreal that I remember. So interesting that there are our sponsors here at the bottom. How weird is that? Anyways, cool work. And there it is by psycho ihara. And let's keep running here, these shows are gonna get shorter. Ladies and gentlemen, Santiago. Someone want me to stop making my viral art? I will not.
00:42:32.722 - 00:43:03.558, Speaker A: So here is another really cool abstract work from Santiago. So again, I like how it's kind of a bit of a doughnut here. And he's playing with the general structure of the work here, kind of the composition of the abstraction. Interesting. Yuri J with some interesting experimentation and abstraction here, continuing to push the boundaries of what's aesthetically acceptable here. Very interesting work. Edition of five for nine tazos.
00:43:03.558 - 00:43:26.528, Speaker A: Bold work. Here's another one by Yuri J. This looks slightly more representational, representational. Joe Ruskin. So here we see a table and all the kind of mad perspectives and patterns that we know from Uri J here. And maybe a bowler's hat or a banker's hat while working on the Verona and its rivers edition of one. Let's just see if it's sold.
00:43:26.528 - 00:43:39.548, Speaker A: Just minted and not for sale. Greco gm my love. Sold out. And thank you. So playing with the animals, I think this is so a reversal here. And we're going to see this again later. So I don't know if something's in the air or if there's a festival.
00:43:39.548 - 00:44:08.526, Speaker A: But we see a reversal here where the owner has the dog head and the owner is on the leash here. And then we see almost like a dutch still life, the chicken in the background, hanging from the background. Another painting from Sir Damos. And I feel like I recognize this artist, the tez prince de la creme. A portrait of Mikey de la creme. And so anyways, there he is on his throne with his tezos. Would you call it sepulchre or.
00:44:08.526 - 00:44:27.384, Speaker A: No, a wand, the king's staff anyways. And some fire here and everything with some cool graffiti in the background. Let's just see what happened to that. Transferred to collectors maybe. Maybe of Camp creme. And also some sold for 650 each. All pretty reasonable.
00:44:27.384 - 00:44:52.884, Speaker A: Jan Lucas Migone 1666 is the price. And that is on secondary. And then we'll look at the work in a second here. Just seen six tazos. Pretty reasonable addition of 30. So anyways, we were just looking at this work I think yesterday being built, it almost looks upside down, doesn't it? Because it looks like the clouds are here and the grass and landscape is there. Wild.
00:44:52.884 - 00:45:12.400, Speaker A: Really kind of plays with the whole balance of the picture. It feels like you're falling. Maybe that was the point. And then an arrow going into this figure here. Very interesting. Escape from paradise rarities collection and running away from old structures and experiences. Sometimes life feels inverse to death, sometimes not.
00:45:12.400 - 00:45:39.490, Speaker A: Maybe the paradise is not what you expect and you have to find something else. Kind of an existential reflection from Jan Lukes Migone and a work by Graphica PnG. As we run through the rest of this here. So just super duper cool artist here, graphica Png. Need to show more of the work. Just edgy and interesting and different. And here we have Martin Joe, portrait of the artist with delicious sandwich.
00:45:39.490 - 00:46:01.814, Speaker A: So working with digital drawing tools now part of a new series here. So shout out to Martin Jo with a bear head. We see the kinky bear, maybe head and eating a sandwich. And here is another work, axe stone. So more animals here and interesting textures. And it looks like a monkey. And just really interesting.
00:46:01.814 - 00:46:24.404, Speaker A: Nice textures here. So ax stone and more animals. Sumireusi with an addition of 20. And you see a wolf with bleeding eyes that kind of turns into a river, kind of painterly here. A little bit with the textures. And then this blood moon here, maybe don't touch it. Edition of 24 have gone at five tezos each.
00:46:24.404 - 00:46:41.704, Speaker A: Dark work. And Dan control with a one of one for 200 tezos. A bunch of cutlery in a pile. Kind of trademark dan control, shortage of cutlery. And here's some more items for the house. Flora Marquez. Sometimes I feel more confident, sometimes I don't.
00:46:41.704 - 00:47:09.732, Speaker A: Interesting juxtaposition of, you know, this kind of, like, personal feeling with these works here. Interesting juxtaposition. So some nice vases with plants in it and maybe some tea, and everything looks like it's growing plants. Anyways, continues with the theme from before and looks great. And let's just see what happened here. 17 tezos to flunk d'Artes. And this is absal, whose work we were looking at yesterday.
00:47:09.732 - 00:47:43.488, Speaker A: This is a different kind of work. And here you see a big windows screen and then people walking into this kind of retro monitor here. And a bunch of cubicles. People working in cubicles. Almost a portrait of nineties office life, you know? So continuing on to Gracie, Jeffrey with a weird, interesting work here. This is part of a triptych, apparently. It looks very promising, doesn't it? So hopefully, hopefully I find this one when it's done.
00:47:43.488 - 00:48:13.502, Speaker A: Part two of an upcoming triptych. So you have the curiosity going. And then Andre, summer blues art, who we haven't looked at for a while, a new piece, intrinsic deliverance. 24 hours, open edition. So it feels like a very crowded space still, actually, for as little as it is, people are like, I mean, look at how much work is being released in like, 24 hours or announced or whatever. So summer blues art by Andre is going to come out today. So that is cool.
00:48:13.502 - 00:48:34.052, Speaker A: And look at this. Killer acid. The USA is the crime organization in the world. So a bit of a political statement. Changed my mind by killer acid. So anyways, very cool work, isn't it? Again, just screams like those underground comics, c o M I x from the 1960s. Kind of a Robert Crumb feeling to it.
00:48:34.052 - 00:48:56.864, Speaker A: And Astra karma. So here we have another one of these reversals. So I don't know if something's in the air here, but here's the owner has a dog head, and. And the dog has the owner's head as they walk out of a bakery. Astra karma is pretty cool. And here's another reversal with the goldfish looking in at the cat. Interesting reversal here.
00:48:56.864 - 00:49:07.198, Speaker A: World gone mad. Breaking news. And so Astrakarma is actually a really cool. This is an older work. I've collected some of her older works. She just does these great. I think it's a.
00:49:07.198 - 00:49:24.606, Speaker A: She does these great. Still lives. Still lives. Shout out to mom. Still lifes. And, you know, just these portraits of, you know, this, what I call contemporary illustration, these portraits of, you know, our lives, you know, of our everyday lives. Tough love.
00:49:24.606 - 00:49:46.108, Speaker A: Great title too, with the candy there that's in the shape of a heart and a knife right there. So all kind of symbolic. And you gotta love the nineties retro phone with the pixelation inside. Totally awesome. Moving into AI. So here's a work by dreaming digitally, the garden's nightlife. And so again, just a beautiful illustration here.
00:49:46.108 - 00:50:02.892, Speaker A: More plants and pots, this time courtesy of AI. So that is cool. By canadian artists, dreaming digitally created in collaboration with AI. So cool. More images of the week. Artificial memory number 20 available for five tazos. More stunning, stunning, stunning colors.
00:50:02.892 - 00:50:23.300, Speaker A: That green seems to match my shirt almost perfectly there. Beautiful work. Remember we were comparing this to the Rauschenberg's drawings in terms of composition. And here's another one. I mean, I think Rauschenberg would just adore this series here. Artificial memory number 19. I adore it.
00:50:23.300 - 00:50:58.050, Speaker A: And how many? Three left at five tezos. So very reasonable. And Perl tez, who I think might be pastelet, because pastelet was tweeting this out, a wavy pearl stretching. So working with AI, if I had to theorize, because it's Pastelay's colors too. This looks like Pastelay's AI account, because now she's putting, or Pastelay is putting out a lot of works under Perl here that are AI generated. And here you can see it looks like a pretty new account. So again, playing with this pearl texture, I thought that one was quite beautiful in particular.
00:50:58.050 - 00:51:10.650, Speaker A: Give a follow. And finally, look at toques. I hack art. So more just kind of stunning AI art here. Awesome color. Awesome. Just combination of everything.
00:51:10.650 - 00:51:31.012, Speaker A: Look at the eyes. The color is just stunning. And even the composition, you have this interesting signature here and everything, just stunning. So tewks continues to impress. And look at Venta. So, AI, you know, mid journey five, I'm assuming, because things seem to be ramping up here. Venta with a hyper detailed work.
00:51:31.012 - 00:51:44.724, Speaker A: This looks like Venta's prompts put into mid journey five, if I had to guess. You're not alone. Gm. Pretty nice work. And here's Sabato with mid journey v. Five. Three states of Miata.
00:51:44.724 - 00:52:04.458, Speaker A: So Miata, I assume the convertible here. And again you see mid journey five. The photographic capabilities here, especially in the background there. So anyways, pretty impressive. And a work by Sky Goodman. An open edition. I think it's Sky's first open edition five have been minted at 333.
00:52:04.458 - 00:52:31.322, Speaker A: In the mood to go out. So more sneakers here using. What do we have in gravity sketch? Designed in gravity sketch VR and brought into mid journey after many iterations, the best version was fed into dal e two. After choosing my fave version from there, I brought the image into blender to add lighting, texture, touch up and up res. So I love the exporting an authentic Sky Goodman work here. So very cool. And then some physical work.
00:52:31.322 - 00:53:00.286, Speaker A: There's a lot of physical work. Handmade collage on Polaroid. Winning bidder will have the opportunity to redeem the original physical artwork. I expect to see more of this, which is, we saw it from, I think, Gaba, the Mickey Mouse with the broken ear artist. We're selling an oil painting on object. And then just, you hear you can buy it for 100 tezos, and then you get it in the mail. That's what's going on here, I think.
00:53:00.286 - 00:53:15.214, Speaker A: And I think I'm tempted to do that. I have a ton of physical work. I mean, maybe I should just experiment with that. So here's an. Here's a physical work by threesomes. I don't think we looked at this one part of, again, this kind of sepia colored series. Again, painting the trading card.
00:53:15.214 - 00:53:39.404, Speaker A: And this is five young, three sib, three c's, boxing insert. So again, very nice paint action there. These look, you know, very nice. You can tell he's done a lot of them. And here's another one on super rare oil acrylic paintings by Aeneas, 16 by 20, wooden frame installed. I wonder if you get the. It doesn't say here that you get the work, necessarily.
00:53:39.404 - 00:54:00.280, Speaker A: Pretty nice painting, though, isn't it? Very nice painting. Very, very nice painting. A tiger's aqua sold for four and a half, $1,000. So that is impressive. And look at this. So this was sold three weeks ago, not even March 7. Minted by Harley Davidson.
00:54:00.280 - 00:54:10.512, Speaker A: Oh, no. And then an offer was made. So Harley Davidson is the artist. Got it. And then JD Sears made an offer of two and a half ETH. And there it goes. And one more here.
00:54:10.512 - 00:54:28.232, Speaker A: Yao Salazar, web five. And this looks pretty physical, too, doesn't it? And you gotta love it. Almost looks like play doh. I assume it's physical, but these days you actually don't know. There's the right click save as guy. This could also be like mid journey or something, but I assume it's physical. Anyway, pretty interesting.
00:54:28.232 - 00:54:49.778, Speaker A: And walk with another stunning spray paint work, the master. And here is Peter from I think it's family guy there. Master of spray paint here. Just stunningly beautiful. Manages to make, you know, dripping new like walk. Watch out for Wok is what I say. And that is your show, everybody.
00:54:49.778 - 00:54:53.514, Speaker A: Have a great weekend. Thank you for joining me thus far. Until next time, take care.
