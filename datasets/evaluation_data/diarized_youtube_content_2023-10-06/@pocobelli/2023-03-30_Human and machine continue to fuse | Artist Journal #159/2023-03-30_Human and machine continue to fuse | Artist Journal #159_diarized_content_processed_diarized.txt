00:00:05.440 - 00:00:22.434, Speaker A: It is the marathon. It is the countdown to Tuscany. We're gonna make it. We're all gonna make it. Welcome back, everyone. Artist journal, March 30, 2023. Broadcasting from Berlin, Germany.
00:00:22.434 - 00:00:42.234, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and I have to sprint through this. We're gonna discuss that actually in a comment. You're rushing through everything. Well, we do this every day, folks. Almost. Almost. So welcome back, Tuks.
00:00:42.234 - 00:01:07.236, Speaker A: Tuks. Tuks continues to stun and just kind of mystify and amaze with, like, what do you call this? Abstract AI. Feel free to leave a comment. I don't know what to call this. I guess it's abstract AI, maybe. It's pretty simple, pretty rad. Again, like, there could have been 50 different things.
00:01:07.236 - 00:01:25.424, Speaker A: I mean, Dan controls fish, which we're going to see is unbelievable. Unbelievable. There are so many things we could have started with. I went with this. Look at this. An interesting three here, isn't there? But it's more abstract. Anyway, let's just see, because actually, there's a super interesting comment here.
00:01:25.424 - 00:01:51.890, Speaker A: Yes, we are recording. Good. I am held together in the nothingness by art. I mean, that is probably the perfect sentence that was put here. And I think, I mean, Tewks messaged me, actually maybe a month ago, two months ago, six weeks ago. And I believe, if I remember correctly, I'll have to go back to that message, that this might be AI as well. Yeah.
00:01:51.890 - 00:02:23.574, Speaker A: You see, it's in quotes. And I believe even, I think Tooke is another one of these artists. I'm not. Let me go back to my notes here, but I believe is another one of these artists that uses the prompts from AI to create this. So let me figure that out again, as I said with that last show that we started, tooks with staring into the heart of a machine, and it still feels that way. So I'm still trying to just kind of wrap my head around these images. Here's another one.
00:02:23.574 - 00:02:36.938, Speaker A: Again, I think Sky Goodman retweeted this, and it went around a bit. Gm. Gm. Yeah. Nice. Gm. So we're seeing, I think, I don't know what else to call it, but breakthroughs in abstract art, courtesy of AI.
00:02:36.938 - 00:03:01.660, Speaker A: If you have another. You have another summary for me? Help me out. Very interesting. And we were discussing on yesterday's spaces, which I edited, and I think it's the most pro kind of show I've done on with the Twitter spaces in terms of a product. Afterwards. We'll look at that in a second. We're discussing about physical art and digital art going back and forth.
00:03:01.660 - 00:03:27.220, Speaker A: And I have to say, and for those that might not know, Hannemullah paper is some of the best paper. It's kind of art quality paper. Hanamula is kind of industry. Industry grade. The fool on the hill owned by Haidja Albino Square 40 by 40 print. So, all to say, this looks stunning. And I was sort of mentioning in yesterday's episode, you know, inkjet doesn't always cut it, but it sure does here.
00:03:27.220 - 00:03:48.988, Speaker A: It sure does here. This is. And you see the power of Hanamula paper. And this is probably a professional printer, one of those massive Epson, you know, printers. So, you know, tuks, tuks, tuks, tuks. And of course, we saw this small. I think this is part of hitch Switchers, which is on Nifty Gateway, also took.
00:03:48.988 - 00:04:25.184, Speaker A: So tuques is really, I have to say, I love the progress and evolution since we. I've been looking at took since, I don't know, October, and it's like very, very rapid evolution. So thanks, everybody who came out yesterday to the Twitter spaces. It was a really great show. And, yeah, and the good news, I recorded it this time, as I forgot to do it last week. It is recorded. This is the unedited version, which you can listen to, but I actually edited it last night.
00:04:25.184 - 00:04:45.592, Speaker A: And these are some of the things we discussed. Actually, I edited it last night. I'll show you where you can. It's actually on the YouTube, which maybe you saw that already. Check this out. So this came up in the discussion, if you listen to it, and I recommend you do. Almost the end of a wonderful art mater times nouns week, let's recap all the steps that led us here.
00:04:45.592 - 00:05:04.860, Speaker A: Look at this. So this is a pen plotter, that. But it's like a paint plotter instead of a pen. It's a brush. So that is amazing. I assume they put the paint first, but I'm not positive on that. And then the brush kind of comes in and makes the texture.
00:05:04.860 - 00:05:44.622, Speaker A: But, you know, this texture, this chaos in the brushes, as we were mentioning, in the spaces, this chaos in brush strokes. I mean, that's kind of what makes this attractive. You know, that chaos, that randomness, controlled randomness in a brush stroke, you don't know where every bristle is going to go. So all to say, the human in the machine continues to fuse here. And this is quite a solution here, because what happens if you take Tuke's work and then you apply it here? Right? So I believe runetune shared this yesterday. Really cool. I'm going to show you some other very cool stuff.
00:05:44.622 - 00:06:08.562, Speaker A: Look at this. Now, is this done with the same. This is also art mater times noun. So this is using that tech, as far as I understand here. So you can see this noun here. This pixelated work has been rendered, you know, physically, with all the kind of painterliness that we might expect from a human created physical painting. That is quite something.
00:06:08.562 - 00:06:26.404, Speaker A: So, you know, here we go. Some. So that's, you know, that's what happened yesterday on the spaces. So it did not disappoint at all. I mean, it was a fascinating conversation. I think a lot of people's minds were blown, including mine, by this tweet. I think runetune shared it.
00:06:26.404 - 00:06:48.654, Speaker A: So that is cool. What else? Robot Prince. And this is another one, also runetune. So this is the artist Runetoon saw Matthew Stone at the Hole in New York City last week, which he was discussing on the last episode, which, unfortunately, was not recorded. But let's just. Let me just show you. Put some music on.
00:06:48.654 - 00:07:18.944, Speaker A: Actually, I'm gonna cut the music, because sometimes we get weird copyright issues. So a little snippet of the music here. But this, look, the robot is printing oil paint onto linen, so I'd never even heard of that, seeing that Rune tune's in New York, so he, you know, has a front row seat on a lot of, you know, this. This is. That's often where that kind of stuff is going to happen first. So stunning. This robot is printing oil paint onto linen.
00:07:18.944 - 00:08:05.228, Speaker A: And I'm kind of back to, like, what if you apply that to tuques? So, again, this kind of promised land, one of the promised lands, shall we say, is between this digital and physical, this interaction, this traveling through the mediums, as I say, over and over here. And this was also shared by Nicola Villa, who is doing etching, who is doing etching of kind of pixel, of pixelation here. So you see, and, of course, when you etch it, you get all these little errors that come in human error, and that gives it a lot of the charm. Right? And it's kind of, you know, and that's what you're not going to get from inkjet printing. So, very interesting. Nicola had a lot to say, shared a lot there. I actually followed.
00:08:05.228 - 00:08:21.988, Speaker A: That's a Twitter error. I follow Nikola Roon tune, digital to physical. Obviously, I follow rune tune, too. That is a Twitter error, everybody. If you ever see that, that's why I do this a lot now. You can see it clear, and then I don't have to worry about that error. Rune tune, digital to digital to physical.
00:08:21.988 - 00:08:51.780, Speaker A: This was also shared, and this is neurocolor in this kind of glass, mylar, plastic, whatever it is. I mean, I feel like I saw this originally with beeple, like a year, actually, maybe two years ago now, right? In 2021. At the height of the bull market in February, when beeple was breaking out, I felt like I saw. Anyways, it's pretty cool. And this do we have. I'm not sure who. Maybe it's in the spaces.
00:08:51.780 - 00:09:15.318, Speaker A: If you're wondering what the technology, it's not impossible objects. It was something else. Sail, by the way, from lone wicked. Thank you for picking up mountains. And the reason I bring this up is because I've been meaning to bring this up, and it's just more physical. And see, this is like a test print because there's errors on it, but you can sort of see how. How fun and beautiful this pixelation kind of comes out.
00:09:15.318 - 00:09:36.004, Speaker A: So I have the whole series here, but I've been meaning to show that to you guys for a very long time. So there it is. So anyways, thank you, lone wicked, for bringing that up. And finally, just on the spaces. So here is where you can get it. I'll try and remember to put the link in the description. It's also on YouTube.
00:09:36.004 - 00:09:54.796, Speaker A: I'm uploading it too. But if you want to, if you prefer, Spotify. I finally have the editing. I've kind of put the work in, figured out the work process. So now I kind of feel good about basically sharing it. I put all the previous episodes, they're kind of more rough edit, but they are there. And there's some stunning, actually, interviews.
00:09:54.796 - 00:10:08.200, Speaker A: Go go Litis purple drank. Some really great discussions here. Rare. That was great. So we had some great fun. So this is all up now. I'll start posting a link in the YouTube.
00:10:08.200 - 00:10:25.924, Speaker A: Just search artist journal on YouTube also. That's what you saw here, if you're wondering. So anyways, I'm excited about that podcast side of things. I think it just extends our reach and everything. I think it's just a heck of a lot of fun. And. Yeah, so quick comments here.
00:10:25.924 - 00:10:44.600, Speaker A: Shout out to Mary. Migraine. Great to hear from you as always. And I'm glad you're enjoying the show. And Mary loved eternity by stellar particular, who keeps it on loop in the music for background. And also shout out to human boy. And we had a couple of comments regarding new artists on the show.
00:10:44.600 - 00:11:06.926, Speaker A: Okay, so let me just go into it quickly. Quasi objecto, amazing show, as usual. Love when you bring art history. Giving it a deep background. Marilla Baccioni and the pope from die with the most likes is his take on an AI image that went viral this week for being confused as an actual photo of Pope Francis wearing a puffy jacket. Yeah, I saw that after the show. I was like, oh, that's where it's from.
00:11:06.926 - 00:11:39.688, Speaker A: I also gotta agree with the other comment, and we'll go to that other comment saying you could diversify a little more. I'd rather see you spending more time featuring a few works from unknown artists or even deep analysis on current topics such as social proof. Yeah, that's rushing through the same artists, then rushing through the same artists every day. And I need to speed this show up today. It gives a sense that the community is that small when actually there's a bunch of people out of the spotlight. Please take it kindly. I still believe this is an amazing initiative and it's your show anyway.
00:11:39.688 - 00:12:20.164, Speaker A: Yeah, I really got the sense that this was a friendly sort of, hey, how about some other artists? I'm. And I guess what I would say is I'm doing the best I can. Like, I. It is, in a sense, it's a newspaper of the imagination. I kind of literally mean that, where it's like I'm going out there and almost taking snapshots, people's art, and then I'm organizing it almost like a newspaper editor, and going, here's the headline. Toques, look at this. So it's kind of based on that now, I am always, I mean, to me, finding a new artist that people haven't seen, that's like an exclusive in my kind of newspaper of the imagination here.
00:12:20.164 - 00:12:51.646, Speaker A: So I'm all for it. So what I would say to quasi objecto and also to, I think, Arturo, I think you shouldn't repeat so much the same artists. Maybe just take the bestsellers, the unseen jewel and discovered new artists. What I'd say to you both is, here's the deal. If you put new artists in the comments here on YouTube, I will put it on my radar. That's what I say to everybody that messages me, and it's, you're on the radar. No guarantees about anything.
00:12:51.646 - 00:13:32.060, Speaker A: But I will look and I will follow and everything, and it's on the radar. So if there's someone you think I'm missing, by all means, you know, these other artists, put them in here, help me out, because I'm one person. Okay? So that's all I would say about that. So I appreciate the comments, though, because, you know, you guys are like, you know, you're coming back and you're. It appears to me you care about the show and you also kind of care about me, and I appreciate that. So I appreciate the comments. Maybe when I can find some new ones while I'm off in Tuscany, hopefully drinking wine.
00:13:32.060 - 00:13:51.544, Speaker A: And just another comment from Emily Thompson here. Thanks, Adrian. I love the show. It's really valuable to hear your thoughts on social proof and how to manage unsold work. It got me think. I think I'm gonna write a little blog post about that, actually. It got me thinking maybe I should be minting more and then reviewing the number of unsold editions later.
00:13:51.544 - 00:14:18.626, Speaker A: I actually like that idea a lot. I've always quite liked the idea of using the blockchain as an art diary, with sales being a bonus, which I think is a very healthy attitude. However, I currently have two collections on object with unsold editions, so I've been holding back minting more. I've been experimenting and enjoying creating new work. So maybe I should just be getting out there. Mint now, curate later. Yeah, I'm a big believer over time.
00:14:18.626 - 00:14:58.148, Speaker A: I used to think it was all about making the perfect work, and then you don't need to have that much output. But I had a copernican revolution in my head at about 2013, 2014, when I was making two paintings every two years, and I realized this is just a failed business model and I wasn't enjoying it and all this sort of thing. So I'm kind of a believer in quantity over quality now, which is. That's a copernican revolution, because that's outrageous, in my own mind, to my previous self. But I'd rather put. And I'm, you know, you want a standard of quality without question. Okay.
00:14:58.148 - 00:15:28.864, Speaker A: But it's sort of like, don't be over precious about it, don't be a perfectionist about it. Experiment, and you'll learn along the way, learn by doing. So I think that's a. I think you have a great attitude about it, and, yeah, don't worry about it. And the memories are short here. So if stuff isn't selling, all of a sudden, you can blow up, like, within a day, you know, in this scene, or within a week, or it happens, like tuks. I mean, six months, axin six months, like, so it's literally six months.
00:15:28.864 - 00:15:54.748, Speaker A: You can go become a star in six months. You can become a star in this scene. And I'm not sure if that's exactly possible in contemporary art. I think it moves slower than that. So, you know, at the speed of light here with our Internet communications, that's possible. Speaking of stars being born, I mean, Spagelsmaskinen was already a star, but look at this. I mean, talk about deja vu here.
00:15:54.748 - 00:16:30.016, Speaker A: Grail secured, x copy. You know, in reference to Spagels Maskinen, this awesome work which we actually had on the show, Grail secured. So I went over to Spagel's page and yeah, all of a sudden the sales started going. I got the last of the abnormal that I needed. Also a spagels masked series, because I was like, oh man, these are all going to disappear and I'll never be able to complete that series if I don't get it now. So luckily I got the last of that. And this is also something spaghels Maskinen put out here, 48 by 48.
00:16:30.016 - 00:17:09.808, Speaker A: This classic Lego, what would you call it? Like ground or platform, for lack of better word, and then some Legos in here. It almost needs the square ones, but the square ones would be impossible to take on and off. But anyway, very interesting here. Just kind of a fun way of maybe composing pixel art. So anyways, congrats to spagels and spagels maskinen. And obviously we'll be following very closely the developments on that one. Santiago Issachorl had a message, and I guess Santiago, who I think has commented a couple of times, at least more than that on this show, shout out.
00:17:09.808 - 00:17:36.964, Speaker A: Santiago is also with tea, if I'm not mistaken, and also an artist. Tea is about to start charging fees again. When we finish the process of legally conforming the LLC. We are just waiting for the multisig vote from the core team to activate them. So you can still benefit from the zero fees program for today or during the next hours. So I guess they had zero fees. If I had known that, I think everybody would have been minting on tea.
00:17:36.964 - 00:18:03.064, Speaker A: Tea Lovers unite. We've just executed the Dao multisig proposal to activate the marketplace. So this went through. Tea's marketplace contract will now collect a 2.5% fee for the tea Dao treasury. You know what else this gets me thinking is because a lot of us are just kind of getting by as artists. That's basically the norm, almost, if you're lucky, at least out here in Berlin, I mean, from the people I know.
00:18:03.064 - 00:18:29.964, Speaker A: So what I would say is maybe it's worthwhile to mint on tea in case they do a token drop at some point, because that's what all this seems to be almost leading up to. And if they have fees, where are those fees? Going to go to the DaO. Well, what do you know? So you can put the. Do the math on that one. Just a gallery here. A lot of artists we know. Er dice Akira D.
00:18:29.964 - 00:19:06.300, Speaker A: I'm thrilled to unveil my updated curated NFT gallery with tezos only art from object tis a fraction of all, so expect v 20 soon, but please enjoy. So I thought it was just kind of cool. And I thought also another these galleries are getting more persuasive to me and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's just the way the works are being collected, maybe it's what's not in it because it doesn't have some. Nothing against cryptopunks, I love cryptopunks. But maybe because it's not just a typical cryptopunk and that sort of thing. There's gogolitis, there's oxine.
00:19:06.300 - 00:19:40.192, Speaker A: Like, this looks great. So I like, you know, to me it just makes me bullish on what's going on there. And also, Jeremy Austin, thanks to everyone who picked up an edition of 690 kilopascals of pure joy on Nifty Gateway. Also a huge thanks to Oshi gallery for inviting me to be a part of urban root show. So here is the work by Jeremy Austin. And it looks like this is the digital and then this is how it looks on the screen. And also we see here works being displayed.
00:19:40.192 - 00:19:59.106, Speaker A: So shout out to Jeremy Austin and always great to hear from you. And here is more works being shown. This time it's Rada. And I think we can make this bigger. And Rada is always kind of hilarious, isn't he? So anyways. Yeah. Is there volume? No.
00:19:59.106 - 00:20:22.040, Speaker A: Oh, there is. Okay, I'm gonna. I'd love to play that, but we're not going to for copyright reasons. So our video doesn't disappeared. Get disappeared. Anyways, it's all looking really good, isn't it, RJ GM all just minted the first piece of a new collection signing in. Great title, the Internet's daughter.
00:20:22.040 - 00:20:53.594, Speaker A: More details. And as a collection signing in, imagine figures from modern art caught in the world of web3, it adapts and transposes social, historical, and political contexts in order to reflect on the state of art today. So here is the first work. And who is this Paula Rego, who was born in Lisbon in 1935. So you can read all about that. But, you know, I'm. Yeah, so, you know, as I was reading those YouTube comments, I was like, does that mean I don't get to show RJ anymore? I.
00:20:53.594 - 00:21:17.286, Speaker A: You know, so you have to kind of go, it's art, it's super subjective, so you just got to go with what you love. And that's how I can show up all the time. It's just like, oh, look, another RJ. I can't wait to, you know, and then the cat and everything. So anyways, this was fascinating. Spagels Maskinen. I was tempted to start with this too, but Spagels Maskinen retweeted this.
00:21:17.286 - 00:21:53.994, Speaker A: Thoughts delegated. This is by Clara Volstate, and it is actually on. It's on super rare. There is a bid for 15. And this is a conceptual piece of art that explores the idea of outsourcing intellectual labor to artificial intelligence. A major theme right now, specifically chat GPT. I mean, they say that, you know, white collar workers are the ones who are more threatened by chat GPT than blue collar workers, right? Or people that work with their brain, who do writing, are more at threat of losing their jobs than people that work with their hands.
00:21:53.994 - 00:22:46.690, Speaker A: So you can just check that out. The artwork is inspired by a scholarly paper on the impact of AI on neuroplasticity in youth, with the unique twist that the paper itself was entirely generated by chat GBT, an AI language model. So, yeah, just finally, by emphasizing the artist's absence from the creative process, thoughts delegated invites the viewer to reflect on the implications of relying on AI, like chat GPT, for human cognition, knowledge generation, and the potential ethical concerns arising from such delegation. I almost wonder if that was written by chat JPT, because chat JPT often talks about the potential ethical concerns, having used it quite a bit. We talk about it at the start of yesterday's spaces, by the way, too, for about five or ten minutes. Chat GPT and just kind of the latest things that I've been discovering on it. Lewis Osborne.
00:22:46.690 - 00:23:08.100, Speaker A: Just the stickers. The sticker bomb, open edition ends in just over 2 hours. So this actually already ended. But again, it's kind of like back to this. These are digital stickers, but it's almost back to this physical thing, physical to digital and back. And here we see digital stickers. So a digital representation of a physical thing.
00:23:08.100 - 00:23:29.846, Speaker A: And I'm just crying out for the physical versions, but of course those wouldn't move. So maybe that justifies them being digital stickers is the fact that they move animated stickers from Lewis Osborne. This was an ad. Okay. Western digital. I thought it was really cool. You know, here's the Mona Lisa.
00:23:29.846 - 00:23:53.930, Speaker A: It almost reminds you of those warhols that are the. Almost like the paint by number warhols kind of has. Maybe it is like a direct kind of reference. But anyways, I'd never seen it like that. And actually kind of a fun frame here. So all to say there's western digital, some ad. And I was like, eh, I quite like that.
00:23:53.930 - 00:24:41.338, Speaker A: I clicked on it and I was like, oh, it just takes me to website. Flora Marquez, another work here. And another thing about showing the same artists is I like to see the evolution too. Like I am an artist and you know, and artists work on different series and you know, I like to see that evolution. And as doing this show, I also kind of check out some artists series, not others. So I kind of all to say I like seeing the evolution. And we're going to see more examples of how that's kind of beneficial because you see how artists evolve, because then you start to see the conceptual, what's going on behind the image, like the thoughts that go into it.
00:24:41.338 - 00:24:59.844, Speaker A: And here, look at how Flora Marquez has developed from January. And it looks great. So anyways, I think I picked this one up, actually. I did for 17 tezos. I regret nothing. I think that's a quote of Jean Paul Sartre. Je regrette rien.
00:24:59.844 - 00:25:27.418, Speaker A: Quite a statement. As William Burroughs said, there's not a single day that goes by where I don't regret something I did something I said. So anyways, I'm more in the Burroughs camp than the Jean Paul Sartre camp on that one. Timothy Julien living loose. So. And great to, you know, we returned to artists here as well. We haven't seen Timothy Jullien for, you know, months, a couple of months, maybe, maybe six weeks.
00:25:27.418 - 00:25:44.566, Speaker A: And with another new piece and a very interesting piece here. An interesting treatment of this blue here. Is it a sky or is it paint? So there's ambiguity there. Kind of a liechtenstein feel. But still. Timothy Julien is this. I'm not sure it's for sale yet.
00:25:44.566 - 00:26:12.234, Speaker A: I thought I picked one up though. Seba sestero GM, everyone. So interesting illustration here too. Interesting contrast with the fuzziness in the background there, isn't it? And kind of a surrealistic, almost like suggesting corporate reality, corporal reality, but not emphasizing it. Still kind of semi abstract here. And a new one from En Haglook. Dream of box.
00:26:12.234 - 00:26:28.590, Speaker A: Cool title. Cool. Kind of a variation on the composition. Seems to be a kind of a. It's pushing the boundaries of the series here. And so anyways. And really interesting business going on here.
00:26:28.590 - 00:26:53.684, Speaker A: Almost looks like an impossible space here, doesn't it? Dream of box. Hope for a miracle and a dream. Kind of Escher like in a certain sort of way. And continuing on, this beautiful, beautiful work by Dan Control. Yeah, here's another work we could have easily started. Headlined our newspaper of the imagination with this surreal YouTube show that we have here. Look at this.
00:26:53.684 - 00:27:14.814, Speaker A: All made with gradients. He's almost getting too good at it. And look at the water in the background. Dan is getting very good at this gradient tool that nobody uses other than for simple gradients, you know, to generalize. This is a stunning work. Six tazos. I picked one up.
00:27:14.814 - 00:27:34.608, Speaker A: Yeah. So anyways, I think they're still available. I'm your huckleberry. So this is Mikey Wilson continues to make a nice evolution here. And I thought this sky is really interesting too. That's almost white. It's like an extremely pale blue sky.
00:27:34.608 - 00:28:03.614, Speaker A: And this kind of Sci-Fi situation, they almost look like guns here, but not quite. Maybe something else. Who knows? Interesting, mysterious work from Mikey Wilson. A one of one that sold for 77 to M. Colonna. So shout out to Michele Michael Michella, who picked up the work from Mikey Wilson. And here is some monochromatic works by rosatio.
00:28:03.614 - 00:28:17.354, Speaker A: So pretty cool. This is in a world. I don't think I brought it up, but anyways, cool to just see the black and white versions here. And also. Oh, it moves. Let me just do this. Go back.
00:28:17.354 - 00:28:33.246, Speaker A: There we go. Yeah. Foundation can be a little tricky with the caching here. How are we doing? I have a hard deadline in half an hour, so we will continue to run. Anyway, cool work by Rosatio here. Look at the skulls. This person, this figure made of skulls.
00:28:33.246 - 00:28:53.386, Speaker A: And there is the skull again, it's looking great. So there is a bid for 15 ETH from Kao Kao. And here, all the bidders will get this piece. All bidders will get an edition of this on ERC 721. Don't sleep. So reason to bid here. That is always a cool idea.
00:28:53.386 - 00:29:20.118, Speaker A: I think has dribble waffle once did that too. I'm probably many times for rewarding the bidders. It's a cool idea. Also works by Rosatio. I think these are older, some secondary sales. But again, yeah, I like going because if we always have new artists, where's the narrative here? So it's always a challenge to kind of keep a narrative together. It's a balancing act, let's put it that way.
00:29:20.118 - 00:29:55.674, Speaker A: Cause. And I'm always, again, people, if anybody sees new artists that I should be adding here, by all means, leave them in the comments on YouTube. Don't leave a link. Cause that will be hidden and I won't even be able to see it. YouTube hyzos just put the name of the artist and the platform. So like Rosatio foundation, for example, look at Yuri J, this work from 2021, which also gives us a clue into Yuri J's style. So, first of all, Yuri's been working for a while here, clearly, and we see how this style has evolved because we've looked at a lot of Yuri J's work.
00:29:55.674 - 00:30:33.678, Speaker A: So it's interesting to see this earlier work here, which is why I show it continuing on, a new interesting composition from Santiago. And I'm loving this kind of negative space here, maybe more than anything. So a nice take on it, a really nice kind of light orange in the background. And this nice, you know, almost kind of drips or whatever they'd be. It's going to be listed on artists of today. I'm actually also in that show and a lot of great artists on foundation world this April 1, which is on Saturday. So that'll be awesome.
00:30:33.678 - 00:31:14.798, Speaker A: That's going to be a fun show by Legojo. And here, commemorative dithered screenshot for the drag and drop draw tool, human kernel. And Santiago, a really cool piece that I believe was probably made by chat GPT. And they actually released, I think there's another piece, I believe, where you can drag and drop your image. So they probably use this software as they're doing that other stuff where you could repeat the heads, if you remember that show from about six weeks ago. Anyways, made using the drag and drop tool and a screenshot from the browser and gimp. So interesting work.
00:31:14.798 - 00:31:37.954, Speaker A: Six tezos edition of 20 really looks good from a distance too, doesn't it? And up close, but. And you see a lot of this sampled brush sort of thing here, you know, dragging. It's just interesting. So is this at the bottom? I'm still processing this piece. Might have to return to it. Edmarrola future, you futuru. Let's see if we can get.
00:31:37.954 - 00:32:21.518, Speaker A: And the music is a little different on this one edition of five for 25 tezos. And that light in the background there, very nice music here. Ed's ready for Berlin. If you ask me, that music has Berlin all over it. Like it has some sort of special event at the, what do they call the orchestral place. I'll remember another time. And look, this is also going to be in the Lagojo show by Ed Marolla.
00:32:21.518 - 00:32:40.126, Speaker A: These kind of really cool work, these lasers kind of trademark. Ed Marolla. Really cool. And then a little figure here, Susanne Violetta and her magnificent pixel synth in an original composition. So hopefully there's music on that one, too. If there's not, that's okay. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
00:32:40.126 - 00:33:01.654, Speaker A: Kappan. Only three minted so far of wild eye. Interesting work. Just what kind of mystified me on this one. I was like, oh, it's kind of like the face and the moon, but the moon seems to be over here. And then you have this. So, anyways, anyways, just an interesting piece here from Kappen Open edition.
00:33:01.654 - 00:33:33.886, Speaker A: Also some pixelation courtesy of Oxyn. And this is, I believe, an edition of six. And really cool, you know, Gif. He's very good at the mechanics of the GiF. And just playing with, you know, making similar images on different frames and then just playing with that again. You can tell in that beautiful matte black, you can tell Euxine has been making, you know, graphic work for years and years and years. Makes it look very easy.
00:33:33.886 - 00:34:02.654, Speaker A: And look at this really cool series. Oxen also put out cards lacking a specific purpose. And here you can buy for 65 on secondary, which is actually not bad at all. These are great playing with the pixelation, and it almost looks like a magic card or something. And here's another one. Rug pull. So, playing with web, three tropes, or just crypto tropes, extra debt, go broke, lose everything.
00:34:02.654 - 00:34:37.726, Speaker A: 666 edition of three and paper hands and some. Looks like a skeleton. Classic euxine, available for 65 edition of 33. So, anyways, very fun and very cool popple sketch versus finish. And I've been meaning. I think I've shown a few of these, but I really like how popple's doing this, and it's really fun to see. It looks like it's hard to tell if, you know, popple's using a mouse or what, because I believe this is in aspirite, which would suggest a mouse.
00:34:37.726 - 00:34:55.145, Speaker A: But I guess you can use wacom. I don't have a wacom, so you could probably do a wacom too. Anyway, sketch versus finish. And there it is. So an incredibly original series here. It's sort of like Bjork. If Bjork didn't make it, nobody would have made it.
00:34:55.145 - 00:35:09.914, Speaker A: That's kind of like how I feel about this, you know, a lot of popple's work. If Popple didn't make it, nobody would have made it. It's very unique. Stippin pixel with a. I thought a pretty stunning pixel artwork here. Eternal cascade retreat. So not disappointing.
00:35:09.914 - 00:35:28.862, Speaker A: Look at this treatment of the tree here. There's a lot of stipend. Pixel has made a lot of nice pixel art, in my opinion. Edgy, kind of pushing the edges. Pretty original edition of three for five. I think I picked one up. I think I might have picked up the last one, actually, right before I loaded this up.
00:35:28.862 - 00:35:41.850, Speaker A: Mikey Wilson, Haiti Rockette so a nice group of collectors there. Stippin pixel, the bluebird's perch. This is a 101. I might have. Did I? No. So this is still available. So interesting.
00:35:41.850 - 00:36:01.134, Speaker A: Almost like a treehouse or something. Are we doing, we're doing well. Another one by stippin pixel prism for Mystery edition of five. So part of that series. And again, look at the evolution here. Now it's the building almost seems to be crowded out by the noise. So that's also something we're following here.
00:36:01.134 - 00:36:25.006, Speaker A: An enigmatic cityscape with deep dark colors and intricate architecture that sparks curiosity. Very interesting. Pixel artist Mech TXT was something kinda, I don't wanna say out of left field. We're in the middle of the week. Be wary of exhaustion, fellas. Take some time off for the signs of it. Just kind of a soothing piece from mech TXT, kind of a fun piece.
00:36:25.006 - 00:36:46.002, Speaker A: Almost. More cartoonish is almost, how I say, the bird and everything. It almost looks more like a video game. So interesting. Speaking of video games, auction has ended now on Ultima Thule Eclipse. I think this is related to Ultima Four, that video game from my youth that I love. And so Ultima Thule is my second.
00:36:46.002 - 00:37:04.450, Speaker A: So this seems to be a tribute too. So that is interesting. Is my second one of one ETH work in Mentalist 420 collection. So just always look at that. And then, yeah, that looks like Ultima with the phases of the moon there. Very cool. Brave.
00:37:04.450 - 00:37:30.572, Speaker A: So I couldn't find these. We have a couple of works by brave with cool music, by the way. Very nice music. I couldn't find these online, but pretty funny. And look at the dithering in the sky and the sideways eighties, you know, space, car, whatever you want to call it. So pretty cool. Here's another one by brave.
00:37:30.572 - 00:37:58.918, Speaker A: Again, I couldn't find them. Owned by hamster Labs. I don't know if I looked on object, I looked on foundation, almost a bit of a pop hole feel, looks underwater, maybe. Pretty cool Sci-Fi pixel art. They would definitely hang well. Definitely hang well with popple. Continuing on, Tom Bombadil, another one of my works on foundation.
00:37:58.918 - 00:38:33.670, Speaker A: So we've looked at a ton of Tom Bombatl's work on object with the guy with the gas mask and everything. Pixel art. So here are different. A different series and there is no volume on this but it was just kind of interesting to see after seeing so much of Tom Bombadil's work see the other work here and just kind of interesting, you start to see connections here and here's tomb and battle on foundation and you see like I wouldn't call it a completely different style but kind of a different series. Let's put it that way. Still pixel art but in a much different vein. So that is interesting.
00:38:33.670 - 00:38:44.304, Speaker A: That is great. Pepe, the NFT collector. That is beautiful. Doesn't look like. I guess it is sold. Jaggedsoft owns that one. Anyways, interesting stuff.
00:38:44.304 - 00:39:16.944, Speaker A: And gogolite us with a preview of a work in progress here. So more stuff to keep us excited for the weekend here. Shout out to gogolitis. And here's Dextere who's been experimenting with pixel art here. And Dextere makes a lot of landscape. So anyways I was just interested to see how Dextere treats a landscape and look at the sky. I have to kill my Siri.
00:39:16.944 - 00:39:38.212, Speaker A: One moment. This is going to be on the bloopers here. Okay, hopefully Siri stops talking to me but I keep saying the name. Anyways, we have to run here. Dexter with a really interesting sky. Here is what I wanted to highlight and playing around with the pixel art. So edition of one for 15 tezos.
00:39:38.212 - 00:39:55.044, Speaker A: And of course Kurt Hussle collective dream savers software. So very interesting as ever. I like the title of this series. Dream saver. Almost like a screensaver. And there's a lock. And very unpredictable as ever here.
00:39:55.044 - 00:40:14.574, Speaker A: Dream saver's clip art minted on tea. By the way these last few works. So I don't know if that's a thing if minting on Teia is the new thing but it makes you wonder. And we'll also take a look at this. Just one call. So there is a new ad from the Kurt Hussle collective. See if we can get it working.
00:40:14.574 - 00:40:56.954, Speaker A: Are you having trouble saving your dreams? Then why not call dream savers today and learn how to bring those dreams into reality? Call now on 1900 1997 900 keep those nightmares at bay. Your true dreams are only a call away. Wow. 1900 dream savers. Awesome glitch. It's so beautiful. I love those guys.
00:40:56.954 - 00:41:16.814, Speaker A: So yeah, that is still available. Ten tezos Koda nakazono. I missed this one. This is an edition of one. Let's just see what it sold for. Only 55 Olaf Breuning and. Yeah, I mean I digging the hard edges here, almost like this pixelation in the white here.
00:41:16.814 - 00:41:39.630, Speaker A: It's just kind of endless. What it seems like Kodak can do with this series here. Continuum number 88. So here's a new one. And. Yeah, just see the background here where it's almost experimenting with what looks like a hard edged digital brush or something. Pencil tool maybe, or something like that.
00:41:39.630 - 00:42:06.134, Speaker A: Anyway, interesting. And Lorna Mills, coda's work just gets better and better. I want them all. Yeah, Coda is turning heads here, so. Yeah, so, yeah, so it's good to follow artists, right? Watch them evolve and everything. Native Ed continuing with this series here. Coexistence DMG Exe Web aesthetic is the series all in one solution.
00:42:06.134 - 00:42:21.938, Speaker A: Just kind of a cool work here. There we go. So anyway, is that a gif, like. Yeah, that's a GiF buy for 78. So that must be on secondary. It is. And sold for ten tezos on primary.
00:42:21.938 - 00:42:53.352, Speaker A: Sold out within a day or two days. Pretty good, though. At ten tezos, that's 200 tezos, which is what, $250. That's pretty awesome. Elie low with an unusual piece. All you knew is a trash. So interesting.
00:42:53.352 - 00:43:05.232, Speaker A: Very interesting. Not sure. Like, again, keeps it unpredictable, which I love, actually. Look at this other work by LB. I missed this one. I ended up picking both these up. These are only two tazos.
00:43:05.232 - 00:43:26.204, Speaker A: Addition of ten. And let's just make it bigger. I mean, I just think it's very good looking glitch. I'm not much of a skateboard person, but this is awesome, right? Raw vhs distortion, CRT, scanned like. And I love the tv frame, actually. How are we doing for time here? Good. Some stills from LB.
00:43:26.204 - 00:43:37.480, Speaker A: Very nice stills. I think spagels maskinen actually picked these up. Both of them. Saw it on Twitter. Oh, no. Flunk, maybe that is. No, I thought spogel might have picked these up.
00:43:37.480 - 00:43:46.274, Speaker A: Let's look here. There we go. Picked up this other one. Still number 31. These are gorgeous. These are gorgeous. Let's just see what the price was.
00:43:46.274 - 00:43:58.650, Speaker A: 15 tezos. Yeah, I mean, they're beautiful. Continuing on. And this. Incredible. This also could have started this show. Sabato Autotopia with this.
00:43:58.650 - 00:44:33.664, Speaker A: Feels like Camp Creme never ended for Sabato over here. So the angels and the cars and mid journey five continues. This one really kind of turned my head and I have no idea what's going on in this series. If you think you know what's going on and it's probably not too. Usually there's explanation in Autotopia you carry the weight of the sublime. So kind of mysterious here. Corral again, kind of that religious sort of, you know, theme generative AI photography documenting humans and their cars.
00:44:33.664 - 00:44:58.896, Speaker A: Created with mid journey V five and edited with gigapixel and Photoshop. So nothing quite like it. Here's another one, speedrun Saturday. And it looks like burning man or something. And anyway, really wild, wild, wild work where love and loyalties are tested with speed trials. So very interesting. And you can see more of Sabato's pretty wild series.
00:44:58.896 - 00:45:16.304, Speaker A: I picked this fancy write up because. Yeah, I mean, I like the humor. I mean, humor is very. It's an underrated thing in art. Humor is really nice and important. And to me it shows. It's a very great quality for an artist to have, is humor.
00:45:16.304 - 00:45:41.908, Speaker A: It really. Like Max Ernst. It's full of humor. You could argue Magritte, you know, dally, dally. There's a ton of humor in with a lot of the modern art. That's what Andre Breton was. Was trying to say with the essay on dark humor is that, you know, that it has an aesthetic quality to it, you know.
00:45:41.908 - 00:46:03.400, Speaker A: Anyway, speaking of humor, 1700 Gucci water pipe. So this is a shisha pipe. And we got all sorts of places you can smoke shisha in Berlin. Edge queue with cool AI work here. So Gucci Shisha, courtesy of edge queue. And they're all still available only for two tezos. Shout out to edge Q.
00:46:03.400 - 00:46:28.426, Speaker A: Moonchild with some experiments here. And look at this. So anyways, we haven't looked at moonchild for a little bit here. So just kind of interesting. These are AI experiments here. And you can see more and. Yeah, so anyway, it's just kind of interesting to see Moonchild and the direction moonchild is going in.
00:46:28.426 - 00:47:00.742, Speaker A: So, anyways, just some experiments from moonchild here. Continuing on. Look at this person. Here's a new artist, I think, Mister Besold with these great AI still lifes. Shout out to mom with these great AI still lifes of flowers and enchanted dreams edition of three for three tazos. So again, sort of like we were hearing from Emily at the start of the show, like, yeah, don't despair, my friends, because these are great. Okay, three tazos.
00:47:00.742 - 00:47:14.446, Speaker A: This is really beautiful. Don't worry. These are great, I think. Very interesting, attractive. Still life's tapestry florals. And here's some recent work by Mister Bissold. Living life in Amsterdam.
00:47:14.446 - 00:48:40.664, Speaker A: Give Mister Bezold a follow and look at all these great works here. I mean, it'd be tempting if I was Mister besold to maybe reduce these to additions of one and then you could probably put them at $10 and maybe they will go quicker so anyways all interesting over here and you can tell who this is this is walk with a beautiful work of I guess that's Marilyn Manson look at this portrait look at this incredible portrait this is a physical work I'm sure a brilliant master of the spray can die with the most likes continuing the painting here with a darker work almost reminds me of war where the leaves no longer fell so interesting painting almost has a german expressionist feel to it in this one very nice painting from die with the most likes and of course Yoao Salazar next week on object so another plasticine work and there's the 404 again I love the 404 and the verification and everything such an original interesting artist and I already follow let me just show you guys see that is a twitter bug and that's your show everyone thank you for joining me again until next time take care Sa.
