00:00:02.520 - 00:00:18.462, Speaker A: Okay, we are on full blast. We are on battery power, but we are here. And welcome back, everybody. I'm broadcasting from Taormina, Sicily, which is a stunning, stunning. Look at that. A stunning city. If you've never been.
00:00:18.462 - 00:00:44.592, Speaker A: My first time in Sicily. Welcome back. Artist journal, October 24, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Taormina, Sicily. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back. And, you know, the newspaper, the imagination, here, here at the editor's desk on the pirate ship of the mind, the newspaper of the imagination. It's such a difficult decision sometimes what to start with, I had to go with this.
00:00:44.592 - 00:01:26.832, Speaker A: I mean, there were three easy candidates that could have just kind of hit it out of the park here. But I went with this. And I think it's just how the evocation of oil painting, and I think it's in this very carefully painted, and I'd argue kind of more. Maybe careful is the wrong word, but it's a much. It's a tighter finish than Bezaya might, you know. And that's not to say one is better than the other, by the way, but just in this gorgeous yellow jersey here, this Lakers jersey, and even the tattoo, it's almost like bzaya is taking. And of course, this is Bzaya.
00:01:26.832 - 00:02:01.940, Speaker A: For those that don't know, it's almost like bazaya is taking almost a bit of an old masters kind of feel to the work here and the carefulness, but still trademark Vizaya. And it's almost like. See, it's almost like cut out here. And let's just look at the gorgeous color in here, too, in this rich, rich orange here. And this is, again, like, I mean, this could have been white. It could have been a gray white. It was done in this beautiful green, almost feeling like trademark color from Bezaya.
00:02:01.940 - 00:02:22.200, Speaker A: And you gotta love, like, the roughness that you see in here. There is a little bit of roughness along with the tightness. All to say, the color in this one, even down here, is stunning. It is absolutely stunning. Even the tattoo here, it's just stunning. And pretty cool tattoo. It makes you wonder if Bezaya invented that.
00:02:22.200 - 00:02:43.918, Speaker A: Not sure. I don't know the reference to the person here. Maybe a lot of you do. Often buzzaya uses pop culture references. Look at that rich red lips there and everything. The great headband, always super stylish and cool with bzzaya. And we see that here once again.
00:02:43.918 - 00:03:03.554, Speaker A: Let's look at the market on this one. And again, it's the color, and it feels like a. It kind of has that richness you find in beautiful renaissance oil paintings is kind of what this is screaming out at me. So let's just look here. Only 20 tazos. This is only 20 tazos. There's two left.
00:03:03.554 - 00:03:18.004, Speaker A: Incredible. Maybe this is an old tab. Let me just look. 20 October. This was probably opened a few days ago. I imagine this is sold out by now. Stunner from.
00:03:18.004 - 00:03:55.996, Speaker A: Shall we do a reload just to check here? Sometimes I keep tabs open for days on my computer just to save us, save myself the effort here. Anyway, maybe the Internet is slow here. We might have to check another time. So anyways, all to say, gorgeous work here from Bezaya as I continue to refine the mobile setup here. And this is part of a series timeless freestyle series. Want to be your own boss? And we've seen quite a few of these. There's Ratcloak, who also had a stunner, this, you know, in the last couple of days here.
00:03:55.996 - 00:04:21.060, Speaker A: We're going to look at it in a second. So drafted. Cool title too. I super thrilled and excited to announce on the show here that tooks is going to be on the Twitter space tomorrow. So that is very exciting. It is a rare appearance. I don't think I've ever heard took speak, but I've seen tooks in many spaces as an audience participant.
00:04:21.060 - 00:04:50.200, Speaker A: So I'm super thrilled that tooks accepted to be the special guest. So that is going to be one not to miss. A just a real pioneer in my opinion, of what I would, you know, I barely know anything about AI art. I was actually pretty skeptical when I started this show. But as the conversation evolved, I became a convert. And now it's basically a staple of every single show. You know, kind of hit the AI art section.
00:04:50.200 - 00:05:27.498, Speaker A: And I have to say toques has really, from my perspective, pushed the limits as time goes on, continues to push and push and never getting too comfortable in a style and a, you know. So there have been a lot of victories with took. So again, thrilled to have tooks on Wednesday here it's going to be with Rune Toon. He's back and feeling good again. So that is also good news. So do check that out if you're interested in here is just a new work by Tewks. For those that might not know, just brilliant titles here.
00:05:27.498 - 00:05:59.586, Speaker A: World of appearances, kind of metaphysical. Beautiful, beautiful title. An ancient theme going all the way back to Shakespeare and Plato and probably beyond the classic distinction between appearance and realities or in the reference there. And this beautiful abstract work which tooks is just kind of knocking off left and right. So big shout out and thank you for the comments. Last episode, you made Francesca's day. Let me just, let me just.
00:05:59.586 - 00:06:38.064, Speaker A: Paper doll. Dear Adrian, your enthusiasm for art is contagious. I love how you present intricate concepts in such a clear and unpretentious manner. And I've heard that maybe once before in this entire show. I never get sick of hearing that, to be honest, because, you know, as I like to say, you know, art is real. And there is oftentimes, you know, I generally live in Berlin and nothing, you know, against, but often you'll go to these very pretentious art talks. And I always think to myself, like, to me, it shows a lack of conviction in art when people are trying to be too pretentious.
00:06:38.064 - 00:07:17.284, Speaker A: Art is a real thing, and so there's no need to pretend it's a real thing. And that's kind of. It's kind of shocking to me sometimes. You know, crazily enough, you might think putting out four shows a week in a Twitter space and then putting out my own art. But I'll never forget, say, seeing Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's Einstein on the beach in 2012 in Toronto, which was amazing. And it reminded me that, you know, the avant garde is a real thing. It's not just some fancy idea of some, you know, amazing, you know, it's a real thing.
00:07:17.284 - 00:07:43.010, Speaker A: And that's kind of a, you know, it shouldn't be a revelation, but sometimes the way art is treated, it can be. So I take a lot of pride in being as unpretentious as possible and just explaining things. So thank you for the comment there. Thank you for sharing your expertise with us. Just things I've come along the way. PS, I must say Francesca stands out as a gem in this one. And thank you for that comment.
00:07:43.010 - 00:08:11.022, Speaker A: I told Francesca that I passed on the comment from paper doll and Rada to Francesca and literally made her day. I mean, ten minutes later she's in the kitchen. Stands out as a gem. She was saying to herself, so much appreciated. That was great. Continuing on, this is Evelyn loves Sarah Berman. She makes a harlequin pattern as an underpainting and then builds up the background, making the great texture and light coming from the background.
00:08:11.022 - 00:08:36.230, Speaker A: So thank you, Evelyn, for. So Sarah Berman is one of these up and coming artists we're seeing from the contemporary art world that I was showcasing. At the end of last episode. I did a search after on Sarah Berman and there was some thought that maybe there's wax on there well disposed. I agree with Pokebelly. It sort of has a look of encaustic. I wonder if she paints with wax or if that's an illusion she's creating.
00:08:36.230 - 00:08:51.846, Speaker A: So I guess we'd have to see in person. Thank you both for the comments. Rosatio, love your dedication to the show while you're on the road, and thank you for highlighting my work. You're welcome. That massive, I think, 17 meters piece by Rosatio Skomara. Great show. Thanks for showing one of my works.
00:08:51.846 - 00:09:04.918, Speaker A: Again, love the gloom tube work, which I'd missed. And I appreciate your reference to the atrocity exhibition pref. Preface. It was a treat to track that down. It's online and read the preface. It's very short, too. It's maybe five paragraphs.
00:09:04.918 - 00:09:46.084, Speaker A: When we're a little more caught up on the show, I actually like, if there wasn't that much art, I would be opening that and just, let's go through it. I would love to just go through that. So just put that on the shelf to, you know, that is, I intend to come back to that. There was talk very briefly, there was talk about, I don't know, four or five, six months ago about doing kind of a series of lectures on the atrocity exhibition. Because I did my master's thesis, I basically wrote a book on the atrocity exhibition. It's a user's guide, to use Ballard's term. And JG Ballard is the author of the Atrocity exhibition.
00:09:46.084 - 00:10:17.096, Speaker A: And it's basically his response to naked lunch by William Burroughs is kind of one of the many things that are argued. I basically show how Ballard's influence was more from the visual arts in that novel than from the kind of literary tradition, a word he didn't like, interestingly. So I'll just say, hold that thought. More on this later. And Radda Cake, artists rock son of 1914. Indeed. Hi, Francesca.
00:10:17.096 - 00:10:39.544, Speaker A: A delightful selection, sir. So again, thank you for the shout out to the cousin. You know, sometimes it's a thankless world out there, and a little thank you here and there can really make people's day. So again, appreciate that. And Grim. I think we looked at this work a couple of days, a couple of episodes ago, the inverse work, and here's the original. So thanks, Grimm, for showing that.
00:10:39.544 - 00:10:53.392, Speaker A: I think this is a stunner. I think this is a collaboration, I believe. I'm not positive on that either way. I just think it's a stunner. It's a beautiful contrast that's going on here. So great work there. Interesting question from retro Manny.
00:10:53.392 - 00:11:58.284, Speaker A: Serious question. How has your art evolved since you got into nfts? I actually think this is a fascinating question because I think it's actually, I've gone basically, and I don't intend to stay 100% digital, but I've gone 100% digital in the last year, year, let's say. And I intend to go back to physical digital first. I've always been digital first since the iPhone six s came out, the phone still being the main tool. But I think this is actually a super fascinating question, which actually, in a sense, we don't have time to go into, but stuff like the pixel art sketchbook. Just speaking from my own experience, I never would have done without nfTs. Like, I kind of had to discover for myself what pixel art is and then appreciate it and then say, oh, you know, what? Like, what would I do? What's my response to something like pixel art? So I'll just say it's been a huge influence, and I suspect that's true for a lot of people.
00:11:58.284 - 00:12:24.706, Speaker A: Very interesting question. Maybe there should be a space on this. That's a great. It's just such a great question. I wanted to highlight it and deltasauce with an interesting comment here. The I believe AI artist biggest takeaway since joining this space has been to stop caring who is selling for what price, and just focus on my art and community. There's a lot to be said for this in the sense of when you stop worrying about the financials and not everybody can.
00:12:24.706 - 00:13:07.024, Speaker A: Again, a lot of people live off of this, especially if you're in a poor country, it's more, you know, that's the irony, you could say, like, people are always going to these massive kind of. Generally, traditionally to these western countries, you know, Berlin, London, especially Paris, New York. The great irony of all that is if you're somewhere, say, you know, in the global south, if you're in some small town in Argentina, it's probably a lot easier to support yourself. It actually becomes a doable thing. On if you're making, say, $800, it probably becomes a lot more doable in a month. So it's an interesting. Even Sicily is quite a bit more cheaper.
00:13:07.024 - 00:13:42.304, Speaker A: And of course, you get certain perks with being in the big city. But there is a liberation in not worrying too much, just on the financial side. As important as it is, as I like to say, it's the beating heart of this scene. And financial incentive. If there's no financial incentive, I don't think we'd have the revolution that I would argue we have continuing on. So transient labs. So we've been hearing a lot about this show, which is a collaboration between transient labs, Artmatter and all of these artists here.
00:13:42.304 - 00:14:34.070, Speaker A: Let's just read a bit of this. Introducing reflections, an exhibition by tender art stewards of generative art and art matter co. Who we've had on a space and was fascinating, showcases a portrait of series by nine pioneering AI artists dive into an extraordinary blend of traditional artistry and modern tech, where AI driven art evolves into physical masterpieces. So we've been looking at this and maybe we should just open this up. I had one small concern here, and I saw it before, and I wasn't sure if it was just, you know, and maybe I'm not giving it fair because there's a lot to go through here. But one concern I had was paintings by art matter here, maybe paintings in collaboration with art matter, but I mean, this looks like a lily illo, for example. And I just.
00:14:34.070 - 00:15:19.144, Speaker A: I'm kind of big on credit, and I'm not saying they're not giving credits, I'm sure you go deeper in. There's. I'm sure all the credit is given. But when I see something like this, and I did see it once before, put it this way, I always err on the side of giving too much credit to others rather than not enough. And here I just go, is it the robot? You know, and of course the robot is making the paintings, but who is guiding the robot? And so all to say, I have some reservations here, and that's all I'll say. And art matter, people are awesome, by the way, and they showed up on a space they didn't have to. And I'd love to work with these guys as an artist, you know, so.
00:15:19.144 - 00:15:53.488, Speaker A: But that would just be my two cent on that. That kind of stood out to me. But you see, again, very much a revolution here doesn't simply reproduce works. Their robotic system intricately layers white oil paint for texture, then applies colored oil with digital precision. I mean, as I said, in the space, it's a new way of mark making, and that is no small matter. So all to say, watch this space looks very interesting. And here is, I mean, look at this.
00:15:53.488 - 00:16:31.128, Speaker A: I mean, this is rivaling, if not improving on the painting of humans, I would argue. And here are the artists here. Strange thing. I mean, can we see that comes out maybe October 31. So maybe this is the preview. My Internet is a little like, are these painted? I am not sure. I mean, that would be quite something, wouldn't it? So I'm not sure if this is a physical painting, painting size or if this is.
00:16:31.128 - 00:17:04.288, Speaker A: I think this is the work and I'm not sure we've seen the painting yet. Remember the Danielle King work that I thought was the work, but it was the digital preview. Continuing on, cyber mystic here. A little bit of the process of the great cyber mystic here, the great visionary artist here. And you see, I mean, the hundreds of elements here, the enormous amount of processing power. Look at down there that Marcelo Pinel puts into the works here. I mean, it's stunning.
00:17:04.288 - 00:17:38.074, Speaker A: It's like a 3d structure here. So interesting because again, it makes you think these elements could probably be reused and maybe even make a 3d diorama of sorts. Who knows? But all to say, super interesting to see that. And Rada. So Rada had this ticket that was posted, I think, earlier. Was it only October 22? I thought I saw this earlier. And this is to a one use token to claim original, one of one physical random drawing stickers from classic tazos mints and more.
00:17:38.074 - 00:17:57.214, Speaker A: So here it is. Here are some of the physical works by Raddus. So again, a very accomplished artist here. And you see the great kind of watercolor paints there. And so just awesome. They're going to receive a special treat. And for the rest of your nothing, my friends, Christmas is near.
00:17:57.214 - 00:18:23.302, Speaker A: I gotta give a big shout out to the awesome collectors who've been my backbone on this project, helping it grow and evolve. And I think we have another here. Once in a life, you have the chance to collect a random physical watercolor from your favorite, including encrypted love messages. So look at that. And edition of 23, a magic number, kind of a. I don't know if I'd call it a mystical number, but it's kind of seen as a magic number a little bit. Probably not accidental there.
00:18:23.302 - 00:18:54.028, Speaker A: And again, you just see the dynamism of rada there. So shout out and cool looking work from Rada and Spiegelsmaskina. New folder. Awesome title here. Pre sales soon. And here you see a physical screen and it's kind of like a light bright kind of screen, but instead of square pixels, I think you get the circular kind of light bright works kind of like a homemade screen. Kind of reminds me of those raspberry PI, you know, mini computers that maybe you'd connect to this.
00:18:54.028 - 00:19:19.914, Speaker A: So all looking very interesting from Spiegels. And check this out. And I think there's. Yeah, I mean, how interesting is this? This is mom of Oiku. So I'm not sure. I should probably kill the music for copyright, but. And I just find this super interesting.
00:19:19.914 - 00:19:56.412, Speaker A: And look, even the fact that it works, too here is also interesting. But even if this was just static, I would be fine. This, you know, again, traveling through the mediums, it has an alchemical effect that all of a sudden it becomes completely new. Right? Sometimes it's that simple. That's why I'm a fan of tracing, because tracing it turns it new. You know, Warhol, you know, again, just took these media images that we'd seen before. Coca Cola made it new, you know, just by kind of making a new version of it through, you know, what you could argue is tracing maybe using the projector.
00:19:56.412 - 00:20:20.856, Speaker A: Roy Lichtenstein, by the way, used the projector a lot. I remember seeing a, you know, for a mural, Roy Lichtenstein tracing that, you know, so interesting there. Dmitry Martowski. Yesterday's experiments for inktober, mix of collage fragments and ink illustrations. And I thought this was just a cool collage here, isn't it? So a cool frog here. And I love the text for the face. So just cool.
00:20:20.856 - 00:20:48.754, Speaker A: Dmitry Murtovsky. And here, this was interesting, using Lego as a kind of screen print of sorts. And I thought it was actually of, you know, this is one of those kind of works you'll see on. Look at how good that looks. Actually like it kind of because you get the errors of the physical world, right. So again, I thought actually, you know, pretty cool. It was kind of like one of those viral videos.
00:20:48.754 - 00:21:03.270, Speaker A: Look at that. 712,000 likes. I mean, one of those viral videos you'll find on, like, Instagram or TikTok or something. But I thought, you know, this is legit. Like, this is pretty cool. So very nice. Now, going into the paintings here, we have a pretty.
00:21:03.270 - 00:21:42.216, Speaker A: What I'd consider, well, I was going to say dark, but maybe extraordinarily sober. I mean, it's a dark situation that Ratclake, who is in Ukraine, is in. And I mean, the numbers that we've seen for the, you know, the counteroffensive, the. I think I've seen numbers of 80 to 100,000 people dead in this counteroffensive. This rivals, like, as far as I remember. What do they call it? The war. This rivals, like, ancient roman wars.
00:21:42.216 - 00:22:14.034, Speaker A: What was the name of the general who something. A pyric victory where the, like, these massive roman. I mean, it rivals these massive ancient roman battles of 80,000 dead. I mean, so it's, it just puts it into context because when you read that, say, I think it's Plutarch. When you're reading that, you think, this is insane. That's what's as far as I. These are the kinds of reports I'm hearing.
00:22:14.034 - 00:22:53.714, Speaker A: Untitled number 523. If the picture seems pacifist to someone, you're wrong. Unlimited respect to all ukrainian soldiers, especially volunteers who are not afraid to accept death as part of their lives. You know, and it got me thinking, this great artist here, Ratcloak, it got me thinking, super original composition on top of it. I mean, just again, we're kind of back to this idea of. To talk about the art of. It almost feels kind of preposterous in light of the magnitude of the events that are taking place and the significance and the reality.
00:22:53.714 - 00:24:15.218, Speaker A: Nevertheless, if Ratcloak is not doing this, what's left? It's pretty complicated, this whole discussion here of art and war. I don't really want to go back into it, but this evokes it. And you see these figures here, these soldiers with skulls and maybe ratcloak or someone looking on in this strange composition here, this almost window like doorway. Is it a gallery? It almost looks like a gallery of sorts. But maybe outside with the cigarette, who knows? But it got me thinking, you know, as far as the artists who have kind of addressed this war like rat cloak to me, I don't, you know, and I'm sure there's all sorts of artists in the Ukraine who are trying to kind of capture. But for me, maybe it's because it's the only artist I've seen out of the Ukraine that has really kind of full on address this war. As far as I understand, this work, Ratcloak, you know, put it this way, I guess this is what I was thinking to myself.
00:24:15.218 - 00:24:55.670, Speaker A: And again, it might sound crass to bring a market perspective, but when you consider how important, you know, Ratcloak might be in terms of an artist that's portraying this war, and this is being, you know, sold on secondary for a profit of 20 tezos. At 60 tezos here, $42, only an edition of ten. It seems like these are very reasonably priced and still available. I might pick one up here after this show. So. Yeah, and let me just actually zoom in quickly here. We have a million things to get through, but you don't want to shortchange the great rat cloak either.
00:24:55.670 - 00:25:24.158, Speaker A: With, you see these beautifully painted works, interesting copies here, maybe repeated here. And we were seen in our earlier rat cloak. This use of copy and ratcloak could have very easily changed the teeth here, but decided not to. Decided to go with someone identical, but maybe different lighting, perhaps, or not. Or not. So, interesting work here. Again, beautifully painted here.
00:25:24.158 - 00:25:57.262, Speaker A: And a sobering work from ratcloak. Interesting kind of details and color here. So interesting again, maybe just the repetition here, the direct repetition, maybe referencing a kind of allusion to the numbers involved and the death involved. Continuing on, detaste. This death, the death and me. So another work here. Now detaste.
00:25:57.262 - 00:26:22.286, Speaker A: Is this Sold really well for detaste, a one of one. Again, going at auction for 45 tase. Still actually available. And de taste. The long shadow I see is my past, a paradise of love that I lived in the heart of hell. So I thought just a really interesting painting. And I think these auctions, the taste continues to just grow from, I think, a pretty small market.
00:26:22.286 - 00:27:06.168, Speaker A: It just continues to grow in these interesting eyes coming out of the, you know, drawed curtains, for lack of better terms, these shades here, the light shade and the car and kind of nice roughness in here. Interesting work. Kind of, you know, trademark for a lot of these artists is using what I call contemporary clothing, the new balance shoes, you know, and here, kind of a dark figure, maybe a bit of a rat cloak potentially, I'm not sure. Influence here, not sure, but totally the artist's own as well. And this beautiful brick on the house here. Nice piece. One of one at 45 tezos at auction.
00:27:06.168 - 00:28:04.832, Speaker A: Gozo with another AI artwork, digital collage and again, stable diffusion materials. So AI is involved here, but then collage, then seriously edited here. And again, these wonderful colors here, these totally novel compositions, different kinds of textures and everything here, great work from Gozo. These burning tires here, horse beautiful textures, a variety of textures as well. Great work from Gozo, another artist that uses graphica, another artist that uses AI and is heavily edited oftentimes, and kind of painterly. Graphica Png kind of working seemingly as you see here, as you see here, working with the accidents created by AI and then even here, and then maybe stretched out a bit. Super interesting painting here.
00:28:04.832 - 00:28:22.654, Speaker A: The mouth almost covered over by the AI. Again, the pants kind of, you know, I was going to say zeroed out. That's maybe not the right word, but kind of cut out a little bit. Repeated. Interesting mark here. Again, it's got the feel of AI, but it is heavily edited. Let's just see what happened here.
00:28:22.654 - 00:29:04.610, Speaker A: Reserve of only 0.11 ETH for a graphica Png. So lots of deals out there to be had for those that are still buying as we go, our separate ways Luca ponsato art so isolation. So Luca Ponsato artwork generated using P five j's and chat. GPT I didn't realize, again, this is a theme we're seeing more and more often, which is the where we're seeing less and less. We're less and less able to tell. I'd argue we, all of us, what is an AI painting and what is not like AI is starting to seep into all of the other genres.
00:29:04.610 - 00:29:37.344, Speaker A: I would argue you even see it a little bit, although it's more obvious with Skomra, with the illustrations, though, right? So here I didn't even realize. I thought this was just a digital painting made in procreate. This is an AI art painting. And there's a good title as we go our separate ways. So here you see light and dark kind of figures here, and almost like a lighthouse of sorts. And then all the crowds of people, maybe a relationship ending. And this kind of yin and yang, you know, on, but separated, but only by a little mark here.
00:29:37.344 - 00:29:47.712, Speaker A: So beautiful work. Interesting color, too. Another artwork. This is straight up digital painting by Yuri J. Sold for 0.2 ETH. Again, lots of.
00:29:47.712 - 00:30:09.288, Speaker A: I mean, it is getting more expensive out there, too. ETH is going up quite a bit, and as bitcoin is, we'll see if that lasts October 23, minted on October 22, and sold for 0.2 ETH. You know, you keep making, I was looking at Ed Morolla's page. You keep making these. 0.150.160 .20.25
00:30:09.288 - 00:30:24.130, Speaker A: sales. Like, that's real money. That's real money. And again, when you consider the costs of materials for digital artists, it's a nice profit. Like, it's not a bad gig. It's not a bad gig. So here is the work.
00:30:24.130 - 00:30:46.346, Speaker A: Another cool kind of interior by Yuri J. Kind of off kilter perspective. Love the pianos. Got the light here. Kind of almost reminds me of Picasso a little bit, the light as well as this formation of space. And again, playing with kind of filters that no one dare use in Photoshop, perhaps, and I mean, maybe way beyond that at this point. Look at the blur over here.
00:30:46.346 - 00:31:12.750, Speaker A: So again, a ton of innovation. And look at even almost like, you see, like, the very flat, it's kind of like very vertical and horizontal, almost pixelated floor here in the popcorn. Like it's movie night. Really brilliant work here from Uri J. And there's another one which feels like a pizarro or something, you know, a cousin of a pizarro. What is this called? Let's just look quickly. Late night renovating.
00:31:12.750 - 00:31:24.046, Speaker A: Sold for 0.16. So basically 0.17. I mean, again. And these probably are selling pretty quickly. And nice. Kind of light here. Beautiful tree again.
00:31:24.046 - 00:31:48.358, Speaker A: Kind of feels like a modern impressionistic work, but done. It's a digital painting. This is like a digital painting, you know, as we've seen a few already. Very impressive rustic digital art edition of ten for ten tezos. I think this is probably sold out by now. This was loaded on my browser probably a few days ago. Another just really cool, probably from memory landscape.
00:31:48.358 - 00:32:02.646, Speaker A: It's kind of hard. These almost look like greenhouses, maybe. And maybe a bit of an agricultural scene, perhaps. Interesting. And look at the cloud here. Just a lot of interesting work. And the beautiful road.
00:32:02.646 - 00:32:26.396, Speaker A: This could probably hang well with a uri J when it's all said and done. Cruz del sur photoshop and mouse. And this was kind of funny, too. This was posted on by rustic digital art. Fake uk scene times, rustic. So a shout out to uxine here by rustic digital art. A fake axin incorporating the colors and the flashing and just kind of hilarious.
00:32:26.396 - 00:32:55.780, Speaker A: Almost looks like oil, these oil. Not tankers, but drilling for oil. I can't remember what they call it, but a reference to oil there, which is interesting, kind of cool subject. Look at this. Chaturscuro. So great text here as ever by Euxine, and incorporating a little bit of shading into the figure here. And then, of course, with the gift flashing from Euxine.
00:32:55.780 - 00:33:21.516, Speaker A: Speaking of axing, Pipi Universal, there is another work here, edition of five. Kind of has a bit of a medieval theme here. And again, almost seeing the influence of yuri J after that collaboration, which was that stunning collaboration. I assume we'll see more. Nice piece here from Pipi Universal. No title. Nuve 1914.
00:33:21.516 - 00:33:48.748, Speaker A: Another cake, torta y mariposas. And so looks like some butterflies and some cherries here. Another beautiful, you know, work. And I have to say, I love this experimentation too, with whatever is radiating here behind the cake. And again, NUV 1914. Bold artist here, edition of five, none sold yet. I may pick up one.
00:33:48.748 - 00:34:06.788, Speaker A: Six tazos. NUV 1914. I thought this was quite nice, too. I don't think I showed this last one. White flowers drawing on smaller iPad by hello, I am you, or you you on Twitter, 2023 October. So, brand new work here. Kind of reminiscent, a little bit of Hockney, but has its own feeling to it.
00:34:06.788 - 00:34:59.704, Speaker A: Again, using that kind of. To me, this is kind of like the native digital paint brush, the kind of hard contour square brush. I love it a lot. David Hockney celebrated it. I celebrate it in some of my work. The screen memory series, it's kind of, as well as in the peloponnesian war series, it's kind of a new mark, you know, made by digital, that is like, exclusively digital, because, of course, if, you know, whatever you're using as a marker to try and make that, it's still going to bleed and whatever. So that universal kind of opacity, we might say, and edge, it's kind of like the opposite of a basque where, you know, Basquiat goes out of his way to kind of put that extra kind of brush roughness on the edge to give it that kind of poetic look.
00:34:59.704 - 00:35:17.408, Speaker A: This kind of brushwork is exactly, you might say the opposite. It's just that hard contour, but then celebrating that and going with it. So interesting work here. Another interesting work. And got to speed up a little bit. We're already at 35 minutes by Skazaism. Minimalist landscape.
00:35:17.408 - 00:35:32.514, Speaker A: Mini lands zero, zero, four. This is on exchange art. Let's see if it loads up properly here. And Solana, I mean, we've seen the token. I'll just leave it small here. We've seen the token. Solana is doing really well.
00:35:32.514 - 00:35:53.798, Speaker A: So, again, as an artist, I think, you know, alpha for artists here. Still think it's well worth your while to mint on Solana. I haven't done it yet, but I still want to. It's got a nice feel to that whole chain. A beautiful work here. And reference, Henri Matisse, memory of Oceania, which I'd never seen before. This is by RJ.
00:35:53.798 - 00:36:21.554, Speaker A: So here is RJ's work. And again, you see the Pepe reference. I brought up the original, which I'd actually never seen before. So here is the original by Henri Matisse, done near the end of his life here, 1953. And here is RJ. So just really, just slightly changing it, you know, moving this. So pretty brilliant to make a pepe here.
00:36:21.554 - 00:36:38.322, Speaker A: I love this series, the Pepe pastiche. I don't show a ton of Pepe works, but, I mean, when they're great, they're great. So very, very cool work here by RJ. As usual, brilliant pastiche. And this is an edition of ten. And let's just see what happened here. Offers coming in.
00:36:38.322 - 00:37:10.678, Speaker A: Drew is fat, who loves RJ, as do I. This was also interesting for the RJ fans out there. After what must have been some extensive digging, Legojo seven has uncovered a secret stash of RJ Halloween pixel art from 2021, and is doing a little giveaway so here it is. Halloween is coming up, and in celebration, I'll be giving away ancient works of art by RJ. This looks like, you know, maybe how RJ started. I brought up the page here, and I had no idea. And they're kind of a reference, you know, doing the pastiche early.
00:37:10.678 - 00:37:36.280, Speaker A: A reference to John with the window there, you know? And to me, like, this is a lesson for everybody out there. You know, humble beginnings can end up, you know, it's only two years, you know, like, let's look at the date on this. October 2021. Now we're in October 2023. It's only been two years. And look at where RJ has gone. So there's hope for all of us.
00:37:36.280 - 00:37:56.264, Speaker A: Just get started, you know, enough preparing. Just start making stuff. Continuing on, Ed Morolla with new. Actually, this is three months ago. Brilliant work, actually, which I'd never seen. You got to love the moving frame. And again, when you make a ton of work and shout out to.
00:37:56.264 - 00:38:20.284, Speaker A: I should have brought this up. Runetune actually put out a cool tweet referencing the benefits of being prolific. And when you're prolific, you just do tons of experimentation, as Ed Marolla is one of the most prolific artists in web3. And here you see the frame moving around when you're making a ton of work. Why not, right? You don't need to be overly precious. This one. Let's make the frame move.
00:38:20.284 - 00:38:35.040, Speaker A: So more. This is, I believe, new crucifix. And this was minted October 6. I don't think I've seen that. That was in DJ Quiro's friendly integration bid was sold for. .2. I mean, let's see if there's volume on that.
00:38:35.040 - 00:38:55.964, Speaker A: No volume, but cool work. And I believe. I thought there was a crucif. Oh, here we go. Wow. I love these moving works by Ed Marolla. And the sound, just awesome.
00:38:55.964 - 00:39:21.608, Speaker A: And look at the, like, fuzzed out clouds. Maybe more volume here. I think we still haven't seen the crucifix. Here it is. I mean, so that's about $400 now. $380. Nice sale.
00:39:21.608 - 00:39:54.506, Speaker A: Great work. Another work by Ed Morolla that I think we missed earlier on. And there's some awesome music here. Let's just see if we can. Let me put it to the start. I mean, there's nothing really like it, is there? So we got a ton to get through here, but, I mean, totally rad. Five tazos on object, edition of 16.
00:39:54.506 - 00:40:17.904, Speaker A: One left. Get it while you can. And here's another. 1 October 19. Underwater dream of fish I mean, this is awesome too. Again, dreams being Ed Marolla's basically main theme, the unifying sort of thematic across all of Ed's works. And just a totally awesome piece here celebrating the underwater world.
00:40:17.904 - 00:40:41.844, Speaker A: And of course there was a great spaces that runetun and I did with Ed Marolla that actually, I need to post, actually that stuff's all probably gonna be posted this weekend. It is a priority. Continuing on low. Trippy freighter battle. I thought this was pretty interesting. Just a cool kind of pixel art gif here. Kind of a Sci-Fi pixel art gif here again, but this time by lotrippi.
00:40:41.844 - 00:41:00.184, Speaker A: Pretty interesting, kind of impressionistic in its style. And let's just see what the market is doing on that. 460 I think on secondary or two left on primary at 460. Interesting price. Lotrippy. Kazuhiro eheira dithersai. I thought this was pretty cool.
00:41:00.184 - 00:41:19.918, Speaker A: I think saiko was mentioning kazuhiro. Very cool. Experimental artist, really. Again, takes a lot of risks. Could hang really well with Martin Brooke actually. And maybe NUV 1914. Just kind of edgy digital art here.
00:41:19.918 - 00:41:38.500, Speaker A: Very nice piece. And of course cap and you know, easy to love. And here is just a campfire. So maybe a preview of an upcoming work. You gotta love these really horizontal pixels out here. The clouds in the night sky. Really horizontal pixels.
00:41:38.500 - 00:41:52.932, Speaker A: You see them going up in the from the fire. And also these kind of little. What looks like almost x's here. Maybe that's a tree, a cactus, who knows? Just beautiful. It's always beautiful. And here's another work. Stare into the night.
00:41:52.932 - 00:42:10.676, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this is an older work. Maybe this is minted on tezos. Not sure. Sometimes cap and will release works and hold onto them for months before minting them. Extremely prolific artist out of Costa Rica also did a great space with that. That was super interesting. Commanders of the cosmic expanse.
00:42:10.676 - 00:42:33.604, Speaker A: So this is a new one for sure. Just turn that down a bit. Looks like using the same software. Bit of a video game feel to it. These kind of cut out figures here. I love this. I mean, there's a music video for you.
00:42:33.604 - 00:42:48.804, Speaker A: And so again, collaborating with music artists. Weird grip on this. 115 tezos. There are eleven left. And it's an edition of 20, of course. Mech TXT. I mean, I was very tempted to start with this.
00:42:48.804 - 00:43:14.260, Speaker A: This was gorgeous. So more just delightful work from Mech TXT. Tall ivory tower and flat wooden houses. I mean, there's so much great work coming out. I feel like it's time will come. But this is just stunning. And again, Mech is making, it's kind of MS DoS inspired work, but making his own little tiles here, just like as if you were making a video game.
00:43:14.260 - 00:43:40.324, Speaker A: And interestingly using a video game type software to actually do some animation. Let's just see what mech writes. More incremental progress. Familiarizing myself with how the tilemap animation works in Godot. I assume that's the software. I imagine I could use so much stuff with it, even sans this art style, even without this art style could even make the small mech character animation in game and do a platform game. Got me very excited.
00:43:40.324 - 00:44:13.142, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean it looks like an old pc game or Apple game. Again, it's very reminiscent of Ultima Four lit Firebase, you know. And so learning how to make. How cool is that? I guess they do the logic for you, the programming logic, and look at how beautiful this is. So really fusing art and video games here in this really, really cool project from mech TXT. Just so excited. Someone asked me, messaged me, what are you most excited about? It's this, it's mech TXT right now here.
00:44:13.142 - 00:44:46.210, Speaker A: Sound on. And so I believe this music is by just more awesome made music, if you could call it that way. Akin to the old earworms and those old games. I invite all you fellow eighties nineties kids to remember the love hate relationship we have with these kind of tunes on the retro times. So just teasing us with these works here. I don't think any have been minted yet, but I also maybe influenced a little bit green ginger. The uncontrollable chaos artists respond to other artists here.
00:44:46.210 - 00:45:04.174, Speaker A: And kind of reminiscent here as well of those Ms dos. So really just super cool. Again kind of reminiscent of Ultima four in its own way. But many games I'm sure this is by green Ginger. Sold out now. 850 on primary, let's just. On secondary, let's just see how fast.
00:45:04.174 - 00:45:20.092, Speaker A: About six or 7 hours, maybe longer. About seven or 8 hours. So interesting. It looks great. Interesting take on it with different animation. Cool frame here. And of course go go litis putting out a work edition of 30.
00:45:20.092 - 00:45:42.508, Speaker A: Only 50 tezos on secondary here. And so this is kitty training I think volume five. So the great gogolitis at work again. Let's just see here. So yeah that is on secondary, let's just see sales of 33 tezos each. So just putting it right out on the primary at 33 tezos each. Pretty reasonable Haiti rocket.
00:45:42.508 - 00:45:58.008, Speaker A: Let's zoom through these. We got a few Haiti rockettes here. Video power neon edition. Again, the attention of digital copies. We see it again here. And these great pixels in the screen, kind of retro tech rad on the wall here. So here.
00:45:58.008 - 00:46:28.686, Speaker A: And here, a cool kind of poster. Almost like the screen. Almost like the screen is on the wall or something here. Cool edition and cool maybe manuals here and everything. And so just playing with different versions of things. This is, to me, the essence of digital art to a certain degree, is playing with this ability to infinitely copy. And there's a weird tension because the blockchain kind of creates scarcity.
00:46:28.686 - 00:46:47.182, Speaker A: So it's just a super interesting, very kind of uniquely digital topic, shall we say. Here's another one. Video power wildfire edition. And here's another one. Bloody glitch edition. So, I mean, you could make thousands of these. These are editions of four.
00:46:47.182 - 00:47:05.454, Speaker A: Video power everyday edition, kind of slightly different. And there were others, too. I mean, so check out Haiti Rockette's page. Here's son of Stag witch hunt. And kind of having these kind of old horizontal pixels here. A cool kind of video game portrait. And I think this was hand animated is how Sonosteg described it.
00:47:05.454 - 00:47:22.316, Speaker A: Edition of 20. There are 18 left at seven tazos from so's son of stag. Big shout out. Imposter, exit liquidity. So maybe a reference to the markets here. Maybe that's how people are seen. Maybe that's an interpretation.
00:47:22.316 - 00:48:02.800, Speaker A: You're getting your financial news courtesy of an NFT as the pump it, will it stay? If not, maybe that's just exit liquidity, as they say. Cool work here, using kind of petsky ascII kind of filter, for lack of better term or animation. And this is an edition of ten, I believe, sold out and maybe just sent or offers, accepted offers of 55, 60 tezos. So nice sales there for imposter. And continuing on, cloud noise micropoet times 45. So this is in DJ Curo's gallery. So nice, kind of minimal.
00:48:02.800 - 00:48:27.158, Speaker A: Again, the computer theme here. And continuing on, we got a ton to get through here. This is atelier 407. I have 25 isometric pieces almost ready, and I'm still going to work on the colors. I want to look at them all together and add some new palettes, then create a visual identity to promote the collection. More news coming soon. Again, an artist I discovered, I think, in Louis Osborne's collection about a year ago.
00:48:27.158 - 00:48:46.746, Speaker A: Cool artist, nice illustrator. Here's another interesting illustrator. This is Borde Jose. Kind of reminiscent of another artist, I think. And here you have just kind of retro tech. The disc men, everything here, chocolate milk and pancakes. And this sold for 0.1353
00:48:46.746 - 00:49:07.958, Speaker A: ETH and Borde Jose. So almost a genre unto itself. And you also think of Adelia, contemporary illustration. I like to call that a limbo is back on the scene, which is great to see. And almost like a trading card meets a video game here. So cool colors too. Kind of a slightly different palette.
00:49:07.958 - 00:49:33.706, Speaker A: Saturn odyssey animation about an NECPC 98 graphic adventure rpg that never existed. So of course, limbo has been doing this for a while. Video games that never existed. I guess there's a soundtrack. Oh, so these could just all hang together. There's mech retro manny mech Txt. Very nice tune.
00:49:33.706 - 00:49:52.554, Speaker A: Very, very nice tune. Continuing on, Turkarak coffee shop trysting. So it looks like a coffee shop, I guess I was gonna say in Amsterdam, but it could be anywhere these days. And just another cool contemporary illustration from Turkarak. Totally awesome. Really interesting. Edgy artist, coffee shop trysting.
00:49:52.554 - 00:50:14.358, Speaker A: And here's Tornado Rodriguez. And we see a few of this series here. Press and hold to see your fortune. And so this is part of that kind of PFP project that tornado was working on, as far as I understand. Maybe it's called the Wheel of Fortune. Just really cool. I think that was on Solana, if I'm not mistaken.
00:50:14.358 - 00:50:27.634, Speaker A: I thought this was interesting. This seems a little low res here. New yellow happy creative coding. So a couple of creative coding works. Let me just reload this here. Yeah, I think we can get higher. Yeah, there we go.
00:50:27.634 - 00:51:00.984, Speaker A: I just thought, kind of interesting, right? Just new visual experiences here every day. And here's kind of like, again, these guys could hang in the same show. This is a little blurry. Let me just reload this too. So what does this remind you of? For me, it was Jasper John's numbers series. See how it's going all over top of each other? I actually brought it up here just for us to look at. So just pretty cool.
00:51:00.984 - 00:51:25.818, Speaker A: And remember this Jasper John series, zero through nine, all kind of put on top of each other. Totally reminds me of that. He also did this version. He kind of came back to that over and over in different ways. You know, once you have your theme, often you like to go over it over and over and over again. A little blurry there. And then some other numbers doing it from a different angle here.
00:51:25.818 - 00:51:37.346, Speaker A: Anyway, let's continue on here. Osborne. Good morning. The world is fragile. Handle with care. So some kind of current events feeling work here. Some kind of big picture for a global world.
00:51:37.346 - 00:52:01.494, Speaker A: For an entire world. Here's Osborne's speaking to the world. The world is fragile, handled with care. A universal work that I think a lot of anywhere around the world you could probably understand. And very modern digital work here. Guru, guru hyenas. I can't remember who tweeted this out, but they picked one up of the cybocat and I thought that was pretty interesting work here.
00:52:01.494 - 00:52:38.614, Speaker A: Original kind of animated GiF here from guru, guru Hyena, Martin Brook with some interesting work here. This is on Mint, fun, I guess, on the Ethereum channel. And this is also kind of very low Mint price edition. And so here's the work. So cool work from Martin Brooke. And continuing on, another work by Martin Brooke, this time on Zora. And I thought this was pretty cool too, again, seemingly using video and mixing it with painting in this kind of very experimental, I guess, landscape.
00:52:38.614 - 00:53:09.498, Speaker A: So look at that. I mean, just novel new, right? I mean, and there's something to be said for new visual experiences, right? So very cool work from Martin Brooke. More cool pixel art. Green Ginger dips challenge, I mean, goes for 54 seconds. So kind of. Again, this video game theme keeps cropping up, keeps popping up. So just very interesting.
00:53:09.498 - 00:53:31.306, Speaker A: Of course, a new tarot card from Manadal, night of cups. Very grand looking and very nicely animated pixel artwork. Let's just see what's going on here. Offers are coming in at six to seven. Tezos, Renato Marini with a work. This is on object. This is a one of one for 111 tazos.
00:53:31.306 - 00:53:54.118, Speaker A: So playing with different kind of Windows XP, as windows, as framing device, and then putting different things inside of it, repurposing it. Very interesting. Harnall, Aventezos detoura, snow faults. Interesting title, snow faults. Nice. Kind of minimal work here by Datura. Black and white too.
00:53:54.118 - 00:54:15.424, Speaker A: Very minimal, very cool. Almost looks like it says snowfalls. It almost looks like rain across a windshield, but maybe it's snow. Always representational a little bit with Datura. And here is, I believe this is Max capacity. Let me just look. Yes, it is Max capacity on zero one.
00:54:15.424 - 00:54:37.104, Speaker A: So let's just make that large. So interesting piece. Very small quick loop here from max capacity on zero one. So it continues. That is on avalanche. And here, of course, is Kurt Hussle collective with a 13 minutes work collage of an archive of japanese commercials from the eighties and nineties. Just give you a smidgen here.
00:54:37.104 - 00:55:13.480, Speaker A: So always kind of cool here. Always cool. So let's see what that is selling for. That is an addition of five and none have been listed yet so interesting piece, 13 minutes long. Kotonakazono, continuum number 162. Almost like an orbiting kind of digital animated element here. Orbiting across this kind of biomorphic, metallic structure.
00:55:13.480 - 00:55:31.590, Speaker A: Looking structure. Almost pastel, maybe. Who it reminds me of is rinny fish. A little bit in the color and even in just that kind of soft pastel kind of luck. Interesting. Koda Nakazono, continuum number 162. Remy, as we go into AI here, I thought this was quite beautiful.
00:55:31.590 - 00:55:54.022, Speaker A: Ocean allurement 250 edition of ten and nine left. You know, Remy, I would just maybe turn this into a one of one. It looks like one has sold. Maybe it's too late. Pretty cool work. And again, you see this, how this could easily work as a screen print? Here we have AI artwork, I believe. Yes, AI art.
00:55:54.022 - 00:56:15.398, Speaker A: I mean, this would work beautifully as a screen print. Great work, Santiago. Life and art number 372. Just a little, you know, just taking it out of the waterfall of works that are coming out of improps, I thought pretty nice and interesting AI art that they're producing here and here. Infinite yay. We haven't looked at infinite yay for a little while. And a cool, just digital painting.
00:56:15.398 - 00:56:35.314, Speaker A: Again, just AI art. If you wouldn't, if AI wasn't there, you wouldn't see a work like this, I would wager. So more cool work. White solitude with a nice AI digital painting. And what is this called again? Solitude. Sometimes it's the best society. Sometimes it is.
00:56:35.314 - 00:56:47.724, Speaker A: And so here we go. Just a beautiful. Another beautiful. Really has nailed the brushstrokes in AI. White solitude. Kdeans GM so I'm not sure. I suspect.
00:56:47.724 - 00:57:07.632, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this is actually an imper. I thought this was AI. This could be, like an impressionist painting. I can't tell. Maybe because I just don't recognize the painting. If anybody knows, I mean, good question. Hey, GM, this could be, like, I don't know, Manet, but maybe it's an AI painting.
00:57:07.632 - 00:57:39.284, Speaker A: Interesting. Looks like a newspaper. Very interesting. Danielle King, Cecilia, part of my artists muse series for the upcoming Reflections exhibition at art matter in New York City. So I assume this will be painted with the robots. And so, again, looking forward to seeing the results there, also by Danielle King, still exploring the abandoned mall. So I love the, I think Ballard called it the poetry of the abandoned shopping mall or the poetry of the shopping mall.
00:57:39.284 - 00:57:56.910, Speaker A: I grew up with that thought in my head. Yeah, we've seen spoogles deal with that theme. It's a beautiful theme. It's an awesome kind of dystopian theme a little bit. And here we see an old couch and an old shoe. Same colors, interestingly. And some leaking, you know, some architecture.
00:57:56.910 - 00:58:12.656, Speaker A: Almost like a leaky floor. As if it's all been left behind. Into the contemporary art world. We go with some physical paintings. Look at this. Great work by Michael Piebus, Pee wee Herman. For those that are old enough in the eighties and nineties to remember.
00:58:12.656 - 00:58:22.544, Speaker A: Cool painting. Nice rendition. Even like the grid underneath. Really cool. Acrylic and flash and graphite on canvas. Nice mix. It looks fantastic.
00:58:22.544 - 00:58:47.204, Speaker A: 40 likes, right? If you buy physical art, you might approach that person. You might get a really good deal. Apelberger. So we've looked at some of their work before. And here is more. So solo show with brigade gallery out of Copenhagen, Abel Berger. So here is some close ups of this artist we've been looking at that uses colored pencils.
00:58:47.204 - 00:58:58.944, Speaker A: Very nice work here. And here's more colored pencils. Stefan Schwarzer, who we've looked at a lot. Nice composition. Nice piece. Very nice piece. Colored pencil.
00:58:58.944 - 00:59:15.490, Speaker A: Polychromos auf papill. And also this is Louis Simo. A cool portrait here. Just stapling the canvas to the wall here. So interesting piece. And look at this. We've been looking at this artist, but I thought this was a stunner.
00:59:15.490 - 00:59:35.954, Speaker A: This close up of a dog. Mike from Los Angeles, California, Donnie O'Donnell, I think is the artist. Beautiful. And even this framing thing on the left, the sun, it's pretty brilliant and beautiful. Mark Belden, another artist we've looked at a lot. Just another beautiful piece here. Kind of brown paper with these neon colors on top.
00:59:35.954 - 00:59:56.234, Speaker A: And this beautifully painted brown. Very nice. And gloom tube astigmatism at the drive thru. Now I think the stigmata is St. Francis. When he gets the stigmata right, the Holy Spirit puts the holes in the hands. I don't know if this is related.
00:59:56.234 - 01:00:09.674, Speaker A: Stigmatism. A non stigmata at the drive thru. Not sure. But anyways, cool work from Gloomtube. Let's just see if it's sold for 305 tezos. Nice sale. Very nice sale for another physical work by Gloomtube.
01:00:09.674 - 01:00:24.866, Speaker A: And here's another one. Angel ship by Tachibana. I thought another. Just interesting. Original looking work. There is so much great art out there, isn't it? Isn't there? Thank you for joining me. I'll try and make the next show a little shorter.
01:00:24.866 - 01:00:33.354, Speaker A: Until next time. Take care and I'll see you with Tukes. Take advantage of the opportunity to hang out with tukes tomorrow at 930. Until next time. Take care.
