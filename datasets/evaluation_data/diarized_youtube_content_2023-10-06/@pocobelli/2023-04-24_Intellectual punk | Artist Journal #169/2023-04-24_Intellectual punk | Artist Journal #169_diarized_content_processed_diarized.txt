00:00:03.320 - 00:00:29.358, Speaker A: It warms my heart to see these figures here. We can feel it coming. You can feel it coming in the other works with Uglato and Mutato. Mutato. Anyways, welcome back, everyone. Artist Journal, April 24, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from the ship in my mind in Berlin, Germany, sporting a new haircut, which has been the object of much discussion here.
00:00:29.358 - 00:01:12.222, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Vocabelli. Welcome back. And I think I did a search, actually on Foh Hawk, and I actually think it's not that far from a faux hawk, but I'm ready to be proven wrong. And anyways, there's all sorts of fun shout out to everybody with the hilarious comments there on the weekend. And everyone, welcome back, everyone. So it warms my heart again to see these yellow, you know, Devo jumpsuits here and these great, you know, upside down flower pots, I think they'd be called that Devo used to where as their helmets. This awesome work by Hasdrubal waffle, again just warms my heart.
00:01:12.222 - 00:02:04.128, Speaker A: And interestingly, I mean, just on a technical front, very quickly, from what we gathered, what we all gathered here on the Hasdrubal waffle artist journal spaces, from the Twitter spaces that we did with Hasdrubal waffle, he often almost sounds like he has several tabs open and then he might layer after things in. So it looks to me on a technical front that you see at the bottom here, it's kind of like this noisy almost you see the repetition here. So that's one program underneath. And then it seems like maybe Mario paint or whatever the texture paint program, maybe Kidpix that has dribble waffle is using. I still need to open. Kidpix is put on top. So again, just cool, adding interest and contrast and everything.
00:02:04.128 - 00:02:41.092, Speaker A: And of course, that wonderful kind of gradient, warm gradients here, gradient of warm colors here around the side. Interestingly, I mean, so it's a bit of a play on Devo, Bell biv Devo, Belbiv Devo. And there you even see a little e that's been erased out. So one of those Easter eggs that Hasdrubal talks about. So let's see if there's bellbev Devoe. And now, you know, probably, probably a play on a Bell Biv Devoe song, perhaps. I'm not, I don't know really anything about Bell Biv Devoe other than the name, but I know a lot about Devo, a huge Devo fan.
00:02:41.092 - 00:03:12.608, Speaker A: And so anyways, I could feel this coming. So this is an edition of five and what happened to this? There was an auction for it and sold for, you know, a steal, really, of 25 tezos for this awesome Devo work here. And the other four were sent out. So interesting selling and kind of sharing dynamics, I guess, market dynamics from Hasdrubal. As usual. There are these other three works here that previewed it. I'm not sure if we looked at one of them, but here's.
00:03:12.608 - 00:03:59.644, Speaker A: So here's one. Chango, come up the river like a meat man. So again, I think we may have looked at this piece. It almost doesn't even matter. We can look at it again. You know, what's interesting to me is when you see these kind of, this noise and these accidents and this, you know, you see a similarity with axine and just, you know, it's just that looseness and the looseness. And Hasdrubal was mentioning this in the Twitter spaces, how much we all love the looseness and how he can spend like a super long time on a work, but then he does something really quick and it's the stuff that people that he does really quick that people want to buy that maybe has the most market attraction, or for lack of better word.
00:03:59.644 - 00:04:18.872, Speaker A: So that's what I see here. So again, it's embracing the looseness, embracing the noise, embracing the accidents and all that. So here's another one. This one's gorgeous. Oh, no. So again, just super beautiful, super loose. Again, it's kind of that same noise that you're seeing here.
00:04:18.872 - 00:04:46.728, Speaker A: And. Yeah, I mean, I've worked like that in the past, and it's a wonderful way to work digitally. Just loosen. I'd call it painterly. And it's just. Yeah, because the thing with digital is it's so precise that when you start working loose again, it's almost a contrast unto itself, one could argue. And here, I think we saw one of these last time because I remember the devolution tag, uglato.
00:04:46.728 - 00:05:00.056, Speaker A: I think we saw this one. So tomato devolution. So all sorts of stuff going on here. So we saw this one. It's fun to look again. And so anyways, super Cool series here. I'm all over this series.
00:05:00.056 - 00:05:26.874, Speaker A: Like, I love it. I can't believe I don't own any of it. And here it is. I had to show this because this is a work I did from 2017 just on the iPhone six s, and I had to highlight the Devo character here. So I just had to do that because it's just so funny. The very oldest homo sapiens was what this Wall Street Journal article was about. So this is really old 2017 phone work.
00:05:26.874 - 00:05:41.254, Speaker A: And we're gonna see people are posting old work. I think that's a super cool trend. And I think I'm gonna join the party here, I guess you might say. I started right now. And people were asking about music as well. So we're talking about hair. We're talking about music.
00:05:41.254 - 00:06:02.846, Speaker A: So I'm going to put the Lego mix. I haven't posted it yet, but I'll put it on my website right at the top as soon as I finish this program. And I'd put it underneath the link, but it's just an mp3 mix. There's lots of devo on it. And people were wondering about music mixes. So anyways, I'll put the Lego mix up that was made in 2007. I just listened to it.
00:06:02.846 - 00:06:33.616, Speaker A: I actually love it. 2007, I think it was 2007. I was in Montreal. So anyways, the Lego mix, there are a few devotracks on there. And since I was in my folder looking at my old podcast covers, this is actually from 2000, if you can believe that. And this is basically my first mixtape cover music for hyperspace. And if you're wondering why I have those icons beside my name, the wave, the beach, and the palm tree and the UFO, well, kind of.
00:06:33.616 - 00:06:55.456, Speaker A: This is the source. It was kind of like aliens on the beach was the vision. And remember how I said I like to come up? I used to like to come up with the title first. So this was kind of one of those cases here. It worked out a little easier. This is one of my very first kind of digital artworks. And I'm not sure if this is like a scan of a printed out version where I lost the original file.
00:06:55.456 - 00:07:26.376, Speaker A: But anyways, it's all here. So all hilarious. And while we're on this, I mean, the significance of Devo can't be understated for people like myself and maybe Huzdrubal and many people out there. So, like we mentioned research publications, we've mentioned William Burroughs and JG Ballard. A lot of people were introduced to these ideas by research publications here. And we've mentioned research before, research pubs. I actually redid this.
00:07:26.376 - 00:07:44.842, Speaker A: I made this logo. It's based on their old logo, but adding the.com and everything and the color there. And Vail loved it. So he's kept it for, I did that in, I think, 2007 again. And back to this is kind of like the research mix here when you listen to it. So anyways, just a little bit of background and research.
00:07:44.842 - 00:08:20.374, Speaker A: Published search and destroy and the reason I'm mentioning all this is because Vail v. Vale was the person behind research publications. He was a great grouper where he kind of showed the connection between Devoid the band and, say, the dead Kennedys and William Burroughs and JG Ballard. And he kind of saw it as kind of a, you know, intellectual punk. Like a. It was punk. But he sort of showed the intellectual underpinnings of that whole movement.
00:08:20.374 - 00:08:38.738, Speaker A: And this is, again, you have to imagine this is before the Internet. So he put out a tabloid search and destroy, which was super cool. And. Yeah, and you see these just. It's just super cool. So Devo was in here and everything. There's one with William Burroughs and you see JG Ballard.
00:08:38.738 - 00:09:08.956, Speaker A: So these came out in the late seventies, early eighties maybe, but I think it was like late seventies. And again, Vail started search and destroy, this tabloid here. This is pretty much maybe close to all of them. There's maybe twelve or 13. And he started this tabloid on a $100 given to him by Allen Ginsberg when Vail was working at Citylight's bookstore. So a little history here because Stevo brings that out and so old mixes and everything. So I'll post that on my website.
00:09:08.956 - 00:09:26.228, Speaker A: For anybody that wants to listen, just go to the homepage and you'll have. The first post will be the Lego mix, should you be interested, because there was interest. There's Jello Biafra, so very cool. I think you can still buy these. $30. I mean, it's actually a pretty good deal. See, there's the atrocity exhibition.
00:09:26.228 - 00:10:00.584, Speaker A: This is actually the best version of the Atrocity exhibition, if you're looking, because it's the annotated version that Vail convinced Ballard. It's released under research publications. And so it's new revised edition is what you see there. And so Ballard added footnotes because it was such a cryptic work. And the footnotes are some of the, like, the greatest, you know, ideas you're going to come across. So anyways, good job as struble to bring out the devo and to highlight Devo. That's just too much fun and too cool.
00:10:00.584 - 00:10:16.074, Speaker A: Always delivering there. So anyways, thank you for the comments, everyone. Human boy Flora and DJ Kiro and Retro Manny. And it was a novation launch station. Launch key. It was a novation keyboard. Yes, a novation launch key.
00:10:16.074 - 00:10:25.010, Speaker A: 49 to be exact. Looking forward to the drop next week. Thanks for the mention. So. My pleasure. Thank you, everybody, for the comments. And yeah, it's just awesome.
00:10:25.010 - 00:11:24.796, Speaker A: It was a very fun Friday there after the haircut. And also coming up on Tuesday, retro Manny is going to have this super cool cyberpixel anniversary collection. And there's all these cool artists like mech, TXT Brave, a lot of 186 pixels light, Tom, bombatilus, Armilk, Stalomeir and more. So I'm going to co host that over here, special space co hosted by me and I believe retro Manny. So anyways, that's happening. So check that out. On Retro Manny's feed we've been discussing, remember a portrait of the future, right? This idea that one of those popular Twitter AI feeds was bringing up of this idea that you can start to use AI within the layers, how that's going to get integrated into Photoshop, and I'm not sure if someone sent me a message or someone else told me, but Adobe has already started on the AI train and I didn't even know that.
00:11:24.796 - 00:11:56.336, Speaker A: So Adobe Firefly is the name. And check this out. Like, it's kind of like what we were discussing here, generative AI made for creators. And you can sort of see, you can start to replace stuff. So here they select the lighthouse and generating variations, and then you get different kinds of lighthouses you can put in there. So you're starting to see another just window on the future here, the water. Okay, look, we want to generate the water underneath to expand the image.
00:11:56.336 - 00:12:32.624, Speaker A: So AI is really coming hard and fast, I think is the, you know, the takeaway here. And you're starting to see, look at this. And then you can just expand the canvas. So, and even some of these upscaler tools that, you know, big shout out to Evelyn o who sent me a link to some upscaling tools. I mean, it's incredible how you can make it image bigger. Now, I had some stuff, but it wasn't nearly as good as some of the stuff out there for free on the Internet. So anyways, there's a visual for what we're discussing here.
00:12:32.624 - 00:12:56.222, Speaker A: And look how text and image are really getting mixed here in different ways. Astounding video edits simplified. So this is video. It's coming for video. So anyways, I just wanted to highlight that because we were discussing it. It's already like a product. I don't know if that's out or what, but Adobe Firefly, this is a beta version.
00:12:56.222 - 00:13:22.754, Speaker A: You can use everyday language to generate extraordinary new content. New content. Looking forward, Firefly has the potential to do much, much more. Explore the possibilities below. So they're just getting started. They probably had to rush this out, but you see, right? I mean, so just like Google now has to rush their AI out, Adobe once mid journey, like, because these guys could all be left behind. Because again, don't forget and then we'll move on here.
00:13:22.754 - 00:14:04.998, Speaker A: Don't forget, midjourney is creating drawing tools, right? So this is a threat to Adobe if they don't start having their own AI solutions. Because everybody, or a lot of, especially designers, their bread and butter, they're corporate clients, right? These agencies, they're going to want AI because that's the fastest way to work. Okay. So anyways, pretty fascinating stuff, what we're working on. So continuing on, so just the market, I mean, the market does continue to be interesting with nfTs. I mean, maybe we should even look at a couple of NFT projects, like see how they're doing on Opensea. Let's read a couple of comments first.
00:14:04.998 - 00:14:25.966, Speaker A: Dan, control pfps are dead, not the art. And I say this from someone who has recently embarked. Embarked. And maybe it doesn't matter that much, but the search for expression and communication of each of us, I think, holds all of this together. It's not that if someone doesn't make as much money as before that, then everything collapses. On the contrary, art. Yeah, spoken as a true artist.
00:14:25.966 - 00:15:02.068, Speaker A: It's, you know, again, like I always kind of bring it back to the Berlin art scene here. Like many people, like, I'd say the great majority have not made sales in a year or more or in some cases ever. Okay. You know, so here you can still make sales. Maybe you have to lower your prices, but stuff is still selling. Okay. And maybe, I mean, if Dan were to put stuff for a Tezos, and he doesn't need to, but if he weren't, he could still make money and that's still better than, you know, good decent times in the Berlin art scene.
00:15:02.068 - 00:15:24.508, Speaker A: So exactly like, and those people aren't complaining. Those people are still here. You know, they're lifers, a lot of them. Sky Goodman, another comment on this. Feel this, referring to the NFT market. Feel this sentiment completely. That's why artists who have been working before, bubbles during and after are still here working, creating.
00:15:24.508 - 00:16:03.284, Speaker A: Exactly. Like if you're a driven artist, like the money is truly secondary because all bubbles burst and no one thing is the thing that changes everything. It's a lot of little things in putting the work in every day. An unknown collector has a couple of comments here that I also want to highlight because it kind of captures the spirit of now in this scene as well. GM friends, unknown collector, if you feel demotivated from missing sales. That's totally normal. But is it a reason to leave completely? Take the easy way out? No, no, for me, not just take a long break, reevaluate your timeline, your expectations, how you want to approach this journey.
00:16:03.284 - 00:16:52.682, Speaker A: If you want to leave completely forever, you are here for the wrong, unrealistic reasons and expectations anyway, most of the time, even if you have enough from Twitter promoting and all the b's, nfts are the way to prove provenance of digital assets. They are the future, not just for art. If you're tired of everything, just mint them, at least on tezos, even for free, to have the provenance of your art in case one day you need it. What is your opinion about it? Yeah, so, exactly. Just the market is secondary. I mean, the important thing, I mean, a lot of the artists like Hasdrubal, has been doing well in the last few months, but it's not like Hasdrubal was drowning in money, from what I could tell a year ago. But you keep doing it, right? And if you're driven, you're not going to stop.
00:16:52.682 - 00:17:30.474, Speaker A: Right? One more follow up here. So after that post, I felt such a positive vibe and somehow still motivated community of artists that it makes me happy. It's not normal for me to feel down now, but art lives forever on the blockchain. All these PFP projects will be forgotten, but your art will always inspire someone somewhere. That's a good thing about art. It can't go to zero because it's priceless in a way. And that's another thing, like in Hasdrubal, again, to go back to what he was saying on the Twitter spaces, he had a really fascinating take on collecting, and he's saying, I think there's going to be a payoff for collectors at some point.
00:17:30.474 - 00:17:48.950, Speaker A: And I kind of agree. I think his instincts are good, are right on that. So, anyways, someone's going to want to collect this stuff. And. Yeah, so it may be volatile. I mean, crypto, you're rich one month and two months later you're not rich. Let's talk in two months.
00:17:48.950 - 00:18:48.770, Speaker A: Maybe we're all super poor, or maybe we're rich again. So it's just the nature of the beast. Let's quickly, quickly look at Opensea, let's just look at doodles, which is kind of a, this is like, you know, a popular PFP, which really dropped, I mean, two and a half ETH. It was down at 2.16, but I mean, it was at like ten or I think 16 at one point, if I'm not mistaken, moonbirds was another one that was at, like, super expensive. So these have kind of come up a little bit, like they're kind of bouncing off the bottom a little bit, but it could be a dead cat bounce, too. So anyways, so, and as we saw in an earlier tweet from, I think it was Grant Riven Yoon, the argument was being made in this chart that he was showing that PFPs are kind of at the top of the funnel here, and then it goes into generative art, and then it goes into one of one, you know, Nfts art, kind of our bread and butter here, or just nfT art.
00:18:48.770 - 00:19:16.288, Speaker A: So if these things start to go down, that might be, you know, so sales could be impacted pretty hard. So it might not be about your art. So that is interesting. Now, we've been, I'm really liking this trend, and I think I might join it. Rosatio, good morning. Kind of missed in real life exhibitions. This one is from 2014, Bandung new emergence, volume five at Selazar's scenario art space.
00:19:16.288 - 00:20:02.310, Speaker A: Yes, I've been doing this for that long, and that's what's kind of great. Like many people, many artists, and these are the people who are probably have been around for a long time, and these are probably the same people who are not going away, you know, because, you know, for various reasons. There's the blockchain. That's pretty cool, isn't it? So look at Rosatio. There's the blockchain where it's kind of provenance, and it's still, despite all, you know, in the worst of markets, let's say it's still pretty good. When you look at where are you going to go? You know, are you going to go from gallery to gallery, you know, hoping that one day you'll show your work, like many in the Berlin art scene do. You can do that for years, you know, with zero results.
00:20:02.310 - 00:20:17.794, Speaker A: So. And I. Yeah, like, I know people. I've practically lived that. Here's another one from 2020. Lucifuge GM have a wonderful Friday. I created this drawing in 2020 was the beginning of a series of paintings and drawings called benzodiazepines.
00:20:17.794 - 00:20:42.108, Speaker A: Benzodiazepines inspired in sleep paralysis, lucid dreams, and madness. So this is 1 meter by 0.7 meters. So again, you see, Lucifuge has been doing it a while. Like, these people, I don't think are going away, you know, just with a, you know, quote unquote bad market. So pretty cool. Work, by the way.
00:20:42.108 - 00:21:15.252, Speaker A: So again, just adds credibility too, when you see, okay. Because that's something that collectors, if they are looking at art as an investment, and we all kind of partially do, but some more than others. And if you're spending like 2030, $40,000 on a work, you want to know that the artist is committed, right? And so. And that is not just some one off. And then they decide not to be an artist, and then all of a sudden your thing might not be worth the same. So all this stuff helps build credibility. And here's no new ideas.
00:21:15.252 - 00:21:43.798, Speaker A: Friday, October 17, 2014 so I think this is old work from 2014 and just, you know, and Axin did a lot of zines. I think AK means three in Turkish. So three zine or something like that. So again, you can see just collecting ideas from the looks of it, printed out ideas. No new night, no new ideas. So this looks like it's from 2014. Okay, so that's cool.
00:21:43.798 - 00:22:11.088, Speaker A: So traveling through the mediums here, we have more woven work by Kristen Ruse. The awesome animate an abstract artist on object and on, I believe, on foundation, maybe super rare, too. Really interesting artist. Retro tools, vintage software, as Kristen calls it. New weaving mounted and framed recently. So was doing a lot of weaving of some of the works. And I'm a huge fan.
00:22:11.088 - 00:23:08.082, Speaker A: Like, I consider this like an iteration because he probably, this is probably based on a digital work, right? And so this is an iteration, but now it's a completely different work of art if this was some animated thing that he made in deluxe paint. So I'm a huge fan of this and I do it myself. And I think this is a wonderful way of going physical, of not just trying to necessarily capture the exact replica, but play with. Okay, I'm going to go with knitting or with some sort of weaving in order to create a work that is an iteration or an extension of this original idea to create a whole other new work. And I just think that's super interesting and it's a very exciting way to work. Here's some more animated abstract. This could actually.
00:23:08.082 - 00:23:25.074, Speaker A: This is from cream safa. This could actually hang well with Kristen Roose. This sold for two ETH on manifest XYZ, which is pretty cool. Let's see if we can get rid of that. There we go. So there's music and everything. Let me turn this up.
00:23:25.074 - 00:23:54.306, Speaker A: Of course, we saw Kareem safa with the pixel art factory. Factory of nothing, maybe. So anyways, super cool cosmos. And there's a really cool. Check this out. Speaking of traveling, through the mediums here, check this out. I turned off the music, but you can see this kind of like, looks like a virtual space, but it's not actually clear to me.
00:23:54.306 - 00:24:18.374, Speaker A: It's almost like. So this is like a. Almost like an ad and almost looks like pong or something. Like a real life pong. So anyways, cool ad. It probably doesn't hurt to have that sort of stuff or presentation of the artwork. So what does it say here? Cosmos auction will be concluded in less than 7 hours.
00:24:18.374 - 00:24:36.238, Speaker A: This audio visual piece is curated by Dalbin Paris. So maybe they made this and is also available on their custom designed Dalbin tables. Wow, that is pretty cool. See it in action in the trailer. So this is for real. It's available on. So you're getting digital tables.
00:24:36.238 - 00:25:02.702, Speaker A: Remember we were talking about the walls going digital. To me, this is a step towards that, isn't it? I mean, you start with the table, maybe you start with something smaller. This is gonna happen with the walls at some point here. Here's more interesting stuff. Spugelsmeskinen. So I saw this, I didn't know what it was. He was connecting stuff and everything, but it looks like a screen is what turned up here.
00:25:02.702 - 00:25:27.114, Speaker A: So that is pretty cool success. And it looks like he managed to hook his Mac up to this hardware here. And now he has this kind of cool, light, bright type screen here. So anyways, that is pretty cool. Ratcloak. So nice to see from Ratcloak with kind of a dark work here. Winter will never end and this is still at auction.
00:25:27.114 - 00:25:54.856, Speaker A: It's at 66 and just a simple dark work. Kind of looks like a self portrait. It looks like the guy in St. Christopher, which I think also was a self portrait. So anyways, of course Ratcloak is in Ukraine, so it adds a whole other dimension to this. Winter will never end, summer will never come will warm up in hell. So interesting, powerful work.
00:25:54.856 - 00:26:33.462, Speaker A: Let's just zoom up, zoom in on it. And you can see it was sent out to a few people here, maybe previous collectors of another work, and then one is going for auction, and it's currently 66 tezos to purple drank. So we'll see what happens here. Let's just zoom in here because oftentimes we can tell the program by zooming in this one, it's a little harder. It looks like maybe Microsoft paint though, because of the kind of dithering pixelation. Maybe not dithering, but pixelation in the brush stroke there. And then of course this is a video, though I don't know if Ratcloak has ever done a video before.
00:26:33.462 - 00:27:04.810, Speaker A: So, anyways, very interesting, kind of keeping with the fire theme. Big shout out to Ratcloak, by the way. Sunday service, Edmarola. So anyways, a really Ed Marolla, I think, is kind of hitting it out of the park right now. I think he's hit his groove. The Metallica thing seemed to kind of get him on a whole new level, and all that preparation, all that work seems to really be paying off. And he's got all his tropes and everything.
00:27:04.810 - 00:27:33.392, Speaker A: It's all starting to combine into these really what I want to call beautiful canvases and these kind of mysterious works. I mean, it kind of looks like a portrait of the inferno with this, almost like this, this pope, this anti pope, you know, kind of a surrealist idea on its throne. And it kind of looks like, you know, an anti pope in hell. What's it called? Sunday service. We might not be that far in. Kind of interesting skeletons here and everything. And look, I mean, 0.25
00:27:33.392 - 00:27:59.620, Speaker A: ETH, someone just made an offer. It was listed at 15. Someone doesn't want to do the auction because check this out. This one went for 0.4, which Ed was tweeting was a new all time high. So things are going very well for Ed Marolla. So again, it's kind of like you can't let your individual story don't get down on the general markets, because look at, there's going to be individuals.
00:27:59.620 - 00:28:32.284, Speaker A: It's sort of like the equivalent of. It's kind of an excuse if you're, say, an entrepreneur, and then you're building a business, and then you go, oh, well, it's a bad economy, so therefore my business is not going to do well. And that may be partially true, but at the end of the day, all sorts of great businesses are born at terrible times in the economy. And so to me, this is just kind of inspiration for anybody that might be down on the market. Look, Ed's hitting all time highs, gained 0.4 ETH for his work. So that is pretty awesome and a pretty cool work.
00:28:32.284 - 00:29:02.744, Speaker A: Again, using a lot of his trademark, you know, dragged brushes here, sampled brushes, the texture, the moving kind of canvas here in different ways. Here it moves a little bit to the left and right. This house on fire, the mysterious iconography, almost like the hell and the skeletons and everything. Hellscape. So hell is the order of the day. And look, as Ed was mentioning, bit of a bidding war. And I think this might be the same account that made the 0.25
00:29:02.744 - 00:29:23.242, Speaker A: offer. Let's just take a quick look here. I think it is. So you know, Ed, and that's all you need, is two collectors, right? It's two collectors who really got to have your work. And life is good, so that's not impossible. Mattias la Plata. Finally, Friday.
00:29:23.242 - 00:29:42.792, Speaker A: It was a wonderful Friday. I walked back from the haircut place and there was a cool american pizza place, they called it, and I had a taco pizza and walked back in the sun. It was glorious. Kind of took it easy. Finally, Friday today, and I take the devil for a walk. So more kind of devil theme. This time's from Matteo La Plata.
00:29:42.792 - 00:30:10.344, Speaker A: And on procreate here. And a couple of clowns. Very nicely done. And this is something I saw on Twitter, just someone I hadn't seen before, Bert. One psychedelic pop and folk surrealism, or someone I hadn't seen for a while on super rare. Interestingly, let's see if we can actually bring up the super rare really quickly. I'm doing way less tabs now, so hopefully that will speed the show up, because I think it's actually important to keep this to half an hour.
00:30:10.344 - 00:30:25.532, Speaker A: And we're already at half an hour. That's hilarious. Well, we're moving in that direction, doing way less tabs. Anyway. This is a beautiful work. How has half an hour passed already? That's what I want to know. And probably talking about Devo, though, which is well worth it.
00:30:25.532 - 00:30:43.690, Speaker A: So anyways, look at how cool this is, Bert one. So let's just take a quick look and. Yeah, so this sold for 3.4 ETH. You know, this is the kind of work that, yeah, people are willing to spend a lot of money. Look at that, 6.8 ETH.
00:30:43.690 - 00:31:02.354, Speaker A: This sold for $20,000. My, oh, my. And that was March 13, 2022. So that was a year ago in the heart of the bear market. I mean, we're still in a bear market, but this is, it's kind of back to the point. Don't let a bad market, you know, fool you. You know, all sorts of good things can happen.
00:31:02.354 - 00:31:22.594, Speaker A: Don't act like it's all over here. This person sold for 6.8 ETH, $12,500 a year ago. Okay, Dan, control with a some really cool chairs here. This is a one of one, by the way, for all the collectors out here. This is my favorite. He released four chairs.
00:31:22.594 - 00:32:18.272, Speaker A: So Dan, who we were hearing from earlier in the program there, and this is my favorite one. And this is classic as well, where again, we see this consistency where Dan likes to play with the border and go, okay. Because there's this question, this arbitrary question, in a sense, or a question. The question you can ask yourself as an artist when you're making a composition, say, of a chair. And you go, well, how much margin, you know, and what I love should I put around the chair? And generally we put some sort of padding so it breathes a little bit. And what I love about this is Dan has distilled that question as an artist to me, to its most rational answer, which is we go straight to the edge and then making that kind of a trope of his, just like Ed has his things. Now you start to see Dan, the conceptual style of these artists.
00:32:18.272 - 00:32:30.082, Speaker A: Okay? And you're gonna see it again here. This is my favorite one, the color, everything. It's a beautiful rendition, too, of this office. Chair. Trapped. Office. So here is another one.
00:32:30.082 - 00:32:50.638, Speaker A: And again, trapped. Probably referring to how these go straight to the margin here. Also for Adtezos, a one of one. So there are a few of them here. So here is a wood chair. And they're fairly common chairs that most of us would recognize. Again, kind of back to this, you know, furniture, what I'm tempted to call furniture of the mind.
00:32:50.638 - 00:33:19.830, Speaker A: Or with. We saw it with spagels, Maskinen and with John Kernel. These familiar objects that we're all familiar with. And that kind of hearkens back to the surrealists. Before the mass media was a big thing in the twenties and thirties, it was about the common objects of everyday life, what's sometimes called the furniture of the mind. And here we're kind of seeing that because we all know this chair for the most part. So here's another one.
00:33:19.830 - 00:33:38.430, Speaker A: Another interesting. And this edge here is hilarious. Right? So I love this kind of. This conceptual solution to the border here. All with keeping with his style of the gradient style. Here's another one. This looks like a school chair that many of us might be familiar with.
00:33:38.430 - 00:33:56.154, Speaker A: School, right? So. And nice compositions too. Like, it's not like a straight on shot. Like it's a very nice, you know, sort of three quarter shot profile of this chair. Nice color too, and everything. Well done gradients. So all available for Adtezos.
00:33:56.154 - 00:34:26.968, Speaker A: I mean, if I was like an enterprising digital or enterprising museum that was trying to get into nfts, I'd just buy the whole series. Right? So another gorgeous work by manital called the Star. And this is just another cat tarot card, the instant classic in my mind here. And nice little animation with the star in the background, the wonderfully beautiful bright light colors. And the star so kind of looks like. Reminds me of Aquarius here. Let's just see.
00:34:26.968 - 00:34:52.190, Speaker A: 17th tarot card represents hope, rejuvenation, and a fresh star, indicating that you may feel content with your mental recuperation, experience an improved frame of mind. It can be compared to taking care of one's own emotions and sentiments. Like a young woman bringing water to a pool. She's also added water to the earth, which represents material and outside things. To revive it. Hand pixelated and animated. Tiny, tiny.
00:34:52.190 - 00:35:05.422, Speaker A: And then multiplied by ten. 121 by 170, multiplied by ten. So beautiful work for manital. Here's another one. And we're watching the work in progress. I love the Polaroid. You know, it's kind of.
00:35:05.422 - 00:35:28.474, Speaker A: I'm kind of back to these margins. This margin adds a lot for me, to me for some reason. And you even see a light, I don't know if you can see that. There's a light gradient on the white here. Interestingly, I love the Polaroid kind of composition. And then you have this nice classical composition. So this is going to be on exchange art tomorrow, on Tuesday, April 25 for one solution.
00:35:28.474 - 00:35:44.104, Speaker A: And. Yeah, so anyways, cool work from mandal. And here's a work in progress from Mannadal or sorry, Miyaji, this is someone else. So that is Mandal. Beautiful work. And this is Miyaji working on some pixel art. So I thought I'd throw this in.
00:35:44.104 - 00:36:09.116, Speaker A: Work in progress. 50% remaining decoration and animation. So here is another pixel artist that loves cats. And here's mech TXT with just more pixel art. And mech TXT, of course, is going to be at that retro Manny talk on Tuesday, which I will be co hosting. So that'll be fun. Mech TXT sounds great on the radio out of Indonesia.
00:36:09.116 - 00:36:48.378, Speaker A: So we have some works here, a hypno card, and then here cosmic laundry, which is pretty hilarious. And just beautiful colors actually, of what seems like a laundry line here in mech TXT's trademark style. And here is, I think, a piece of a landscape practice piece for something. So just a beautiful color, two color river with tons of dithering, which looks so great when you make it large like this. And here's some even larger dithering from Mech TXT, the flying green. So referencing the pepe token, which has made a lot of people a lot of money. And so that is pretty cool.
00:36:48.378 - 00:37:01.784, Speaker A: Mech TXT. And let me just look at. So this was sent out to a few people. And so just taking offers right now. I'm not sure what's going on. You'll have to go to the Twitter feed if you want a copy. Pretty cool.
00:37:01.784 - 00:37:27.010, Speaker A: That looks like a Twitter logo on there with the pepe the frog and a chart in the background. And we saw this the other day, but we didn't see it large. We just saw a small version on Twitter, I believe. So. Anyways, I'm pretty sure maybe we were looking at the cave. So maybe I just like this piece so much, I wanted to show it again here. So anyways, again using the marquee tool, the selection tool is how Lorna Mills makes these.
00:37:27.010 - 00:37:40.674, Speaker A: I think so. One of one for 600. I think we've already seen that. This was interesting. Lorna Mills posted this, this artist that I hadn't seen before, Flint Pope. And we can look at Flint's page here. This is a one of one.
00:37:40.674 - 00:37:58.490, Speaker A: Interesting title. Paolozzi factory. So Eduardo Paolozzi is a pretty well known. I don't know if you'd call him a pop artist. I think so. He was actually good friends with JG Ballard. I've seen a good paolozzi show here at museum here in Berlin.
00:37:58.490 - 00:38:15.334, Speaker A: I want to call it like the Berlinischer Gallery, I think it's called. Anyways. Has some cool kind of glitch generative art thing going on here. So interesting artist highlighted by Lorna Mills. So I thought I'd show it. Thought that looked pretty good. Let's just see what happened on the market here.
00:38:15.334 - 00:38:39.354, Speaker A: Five tazos. So you are early if you're buying Flint Pope's work. Edition of one. And here it is. So, yeah, edition of five for one tezos. So here is an artist that is largely, probably undiscovered Brillo pad salesperson level two. And so anyways, so there is some new sort of animated, abstract generative artwork for you.
00:38:39.354 - 00:39:00.780, Speaker A: And here's another one from Renki, also a recent discovery. Kurume. And so anyway, just more interesting. Animated abstract art, kinda. Yeah. I'm not sure what's going on here, but it kind of drags and leaves its trail a little bit. Kind of reminds me of the delay tool a little bit.
00:39:00.780 - 00:39:17.480, Speaker A: Or these sampled brushes. This looks like almost like live action of those. Where you take a sample of a piece of, you know, of a digital canvas and then you drag it and you start getting repetitions or something. Anyways, Renki with cool work. Somfeh with another work. Wayfair. This one is new.
00:39:17.480 - 00:39:38.160, Speaker A: This is a one of one released April 20. I don't think we looked at this one. Anyway, it sold for 70. So cool work from Somfei. And continuing on, this is also really cool work by augurs with some nice sound. Let me bring this up here. Really moody, atmospheric piece here.
00:39:38.160 - 00:40:04.954, Speaker A: So it's almost like a beach. Let me restart this. There we go. I really like this piece. It's just very moody and atmospheric. So you get the picture it's people throwing a ball around on a beach or kicking a ball around. So just kind of moody and moody and nice.
00:40:04.954 - 00:40:21.934, Speaker A: I see I'm going to have to put more effort at making these shorter. Gonna need even less work. And here's feels with a cool work. Again, getting massive amounts of views. 77,000 views for feels. Just cool work posted on Twitter. This I think was burned or something.
00:40:21.934 - 00:40:36.854, Speaker A: Test zero five from. I thought these were gorgeous. I saw a few of these from MCHX. Look at these beautiful, beautiful animated abstract works. I think they were burned. We'll take a look here in a second. But look at this.
00:40:36.854 - 00:40:55.902, Speaker A: And of course we remember some slightly Rothko, you know, inspired works before, but this is like totally different. And look at that. I mean, just gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. So let's just see. I think. Yeah, burned. So anyway, cool test zero five looks great.
00:40:55.902 - 00:41:15.446, Speaker A: Mchx. If you happen to be watching this Polygon 1993 with a really cool. I think this is like a Mario. So that is pretty cool. And even this ext three and all that sort of stuff. I'm not sure where that's available. Phantasm world for prints.
00:41:15.446 - 00:41:36.134, Speaker A: So I'm not sure if this is an NFT artist or not, but pretty rad if you ask me. And here's one from Curo, I believe. Or e boy, created by e boy, sorry. And split with. So I think Kiro put together the show. This is part of friendly integration by Kiro. So this is another work from Kiro's show.
00:41:36.134 - 00:41:56.298, Speaker A: So a pretty cool, kind of reminiscent of that Mario. We were just looking at kind of big pixels, kind of looking like on an old screen, this sort of thing. Kind of the glitch analog video situation. Cool work. And it's called Spider el akiro. So maybe a reference in homage to Quiro. Very nice piece by Francoise Gamma.
00:41:56.298 - 00:42:16.338, Speaker A: MCAP. Just a very nice piece. And froissoise gamma is putting out a ton of work, I think, old and new. So anyways, a really cool piece here. Continuing on, another piece by Tiegenhof. This is going for tazos. And it's an addition of twelve.
00:42:16.338 - 00:42:54.372, Speaker A: And we got more clues actually. Or maybe I missed it last time. But this uses AI that is edited. So this is a really interesting solution. Again, it's sort of like, to me, this is kind of one of the big promises of AI art, is really edited AI art, which we see with Yoa in and then using it and then adding to it. Right. So raw AI, I think, is rad and amazing, you know, but also this editing, AI, AI generated images edited and animated almost in like, kind of reminiscent of kappan a little bit here.
00:42:54.372 - 00:43:20.744, Speaker A: So these are beautiful works. Super interesting. The colors are great. One went to Ilay here. So really cool work from Teganhof. Ilay was some really cool AI work, AI and digital painting as well. So again, these look like somewhat influenced by, like when you put in AI, when you put pixelated, when you try and get pixel art out of AI, it's reminiscent of that.
00:43:20.744 - 00:43:54.360, Speaker A: But then it sounds like there's some, also some editing going on here. So I wasn't sure exactly how at first, but then I saw another one. And to me, this looks like Pixelmator brush strokes here, that beautiful square brush that's so easy to use in Pixelmator. This kind of reminds me of that. So another cool work. And a cool contrast with this painterly background here and what looks like painting on top, AI and digital painting. And so if we go back here, then I start to go, oh, maybe some of the banana, some of the.
00:43:54.360 - 00:44:12.940, Speaker A: Maybe these are square brush that was put on top in some areas. Really nice work from ilay. Mech TXT picked one up. That is great. So you see the community here. For those that are new, a lot of these people kind of know each other online, which is super cool. And collect from each other the magician.
00:44:12.940 - 00:44:33.648, Speaker A: And you see how small it is. So this is a collaboration between Lily Illo and Ben Canize. So yes, immediately recognizable as Lily illo style. But then maybe the animation is by Ben Canize. So with. And yeah, who. Yeah.
00:44:33.648 - 00:44:51.044, Speaker A: Blends art and technology to create a dynamic and enchanting experience. So anyways, the magician. Cool subject too. And that's interesting. Oh, I may have missed the whole piece. Wow. I didn't even know you could do that.
00:44:51.044 - 00:45:12.386, Speaker A: It's magic. It's magic. Wow, that's really cool. Super cool. Soon, headquarters, number five. So the home office, a wonderful subject. Here is another one, number five.
00:45:12.386 - 00:45:50.742, Speaker A: In this beautiful, kind of beautifully painterly effect, I believe it sort of says del e to me in these beautiful textures here. Gorgeous textures. And look at that. You can just kind of stare at this forever. These background von Doyle, this seems to be, uh, this seems to be, uh, AI, right. I bring the music in and out just for copyright reasons. Pretty wild, if you ask me.
00:45:50.742 - 00:46:25.710, Speaker A: So anyway, just interesting, kind of dizzying, overthinking everything. Good title, and we're almost done here. This is don't be so bassia with a really cool work gm and just really nice textures. And again, I think we're dealing with AI and maybe a little bit of digital painting. But again, the AI painting is looking more and more convincing. This sense of texture, this spray, the brushwork, it's all way more persuasive than it seemed to have been even like a few months ago. So anyways, more, I believe this is generally raw AI.
00:46:25.710 - 00:47:01.378, Speaker A: An assortment of AI concept footwear from the files, from strange thing. And this is the amazing thing about AI, is you can be so prolific. Like in strange thing, you must be putting out like 100 images a day. You know, like is sort of the impression and just all this really great stuff. So beautiful concept where I love the snike logo here. I mean, there's so much going on here. Great grip and here, I mean, so anyways, keeping it interesting and beautiful.
00:47:01.378 - 00:47:26.132, Speaker A: Teenage mutant ninja turtle shoes. Even see the shell. Anyways, very cool from strange thing. Really interesting series. Finally from Sabato, this autotopia series, kind of a very surreal artwork. And he has a little explanation here. There are some fresh mints coming from autotopia, my series of AI photographs documenting the singularity of human and car personhood as dromology.
00:47:26.132 - 00:47:42.704, Speaker A: I don't know that word. And alchemical attempts at forging a capybara Ferrari. Okay, same deal as before. 404 editions, top three offers accepted. Eleven tez minimum. So here are some of them. So pretty wild, unusual series here.
00:47:42.704 - 00:48:03.672, Speaker A: This looks like an auto factory car repair sort of thing. And here's another one, glory on the boulevard. Let's just see. And, yeah, waiting for offers there. So anyways, looks like La. And again, playing with almost the religious imagery, the wings and the car. Very interesting fusion.
00:48:03.672 - 00:48:22.592, Speaker A: This is, I believe, not a number exactly. Nen dev. So also playing with AI here, seemingly so interesting work here with this reflection in the water. And also had a different version here. A little bit stronger contrast here. And fixed it. White balance.
00:48:22.592 - 00:48:46.630, Speaker A: I kind of like the first one slightly better, just in terms of light. I don't mind this kind of soft light here, but, you know, you could go either way, maybe it depends on your mood. This was interesting too. Skurbo with who? I'm not sure I've ever heard of before. Give them a follow. They're on super rare. So anyways, interesting kind of piece here, isn't it? So it looks like using some sort of pixelation as a mask.
00:48:46.630 - 00:49:08.414, Speaker A: Anyway, creating very odd object here. But very cool is what I'd say. This kind of crazy contorted body here. And into the physical we go. We are the last witnesses of time. A cool work by demon ego from the sketchbook here. But again, remember with demon Ego, all this stuff on the edge, it's a new work for demon ego.
00:49:08.414 - 00:49:27.422, Speaker A: The shadow of the page kind of in the middle here and everything. So anyways, beautiful work from demon ego. And let's just see, five tezos. There are seven left. And some more work by Gloomtube, which is kind of exciting. I want to see this. It's looking better and better.
00:49:27.422 - 00:49:55.574, Speaker A: It doesn't take long. This almost reminds me of the OJ Simpson chasing the white Ford Bronco. And then here, this looks like maybe Waco on fire. So maybe he's taking these famous media images as a subject. A few paintings together at Gloomtube's Instagram and some more just kind of experimentation. So gloomtube is going for it, practicing doodles. And here's axine with a cool screen print with a stretched out profile picture.
00:49:55.574 - 00:50:26.322, Speaker A: So anyways, that's looking really cool. And it looks like it's on top of some sort of canvas here. So that's kind of interesting as well. And also Flora with almost like a hand drawing, almost charcoal looking on real lined paper here that is animated. So also interesting. Again, Flora's gonna be on the Twitter spaces on Wednesday, so if you're a fan, do check that out. I'll put out the tweet later today or tomorrow morning before the show.
00:50:26.322 - 00:50:48.530, Speaker A: So anyways, awesome work from Flora. And finally, Mark Belden, who we've looked at a lot of his work. Here's another one. Just beautiful half finished flowers with gorgeous colors, beautiful textures. So simple room gouache on Saint Armand paper. So you see the importance of materials here. To me, this is all about the materials and the gorgeous color and the gorgeous composition.
00:50:48.530 - 00:51:17.584, Speaker A: Really cool artist here. So one more, yoao Salazar, modeling painting. So more kind of insight into how Yoao is working here. So adding texture here, not just so using plasticine to create these super kind of witty works that are so interesting and often about technology. So using play doh is just a really interesting contrast. And that is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me once again. Until next time, take care.
