00:00:03.800 - 00:00:27.278, Speaker A: I think I figured out why the ship is taking on water. It's because there are so many people on it. There are so many tabs open here today. I am gonna have to go very fast just to get it all done and not have the computer collapse on me. Welcome back, everybody. Artists journal, March 13, 2024. Broadcasting from the non space of the mind, where there is space.
00:00:27.278 - 00:00:42.318, Speaker A: But we'll figure that out. Not afraid of contradictions and paradoxes here. Welcome back. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and it is a massive show today. It is a monster. I was saying to myself, so help me out. I don't know what to do.
00:00:42.318 - 00:01:11.838, Speaker A: I'm exasperated. I think what I'm gonna do as far as shortening the show for the sake of my computer, for the sake of. For the sake of everybody, at least for the sake of myself, I think I'm just gonna put a time limit in the morning on what I can get done. And I'm just gonna experiment. So with that, just a kind of a heads up there. So let's, again, a huge show here and look at this. So you probably recognize the artist.
00:01:11.838 - 00:01:52.928, Speaker A: And I thought to myself, as I was thinking, what to open with here. Again, you know what I imagine? I call this a newspaper. The imagination. I really do think of that as the. I really do think of it that way, as almost like those little newspaper bins that are on the road that they used to have, that they don't really have anymore. And, like, what would the person on the street, you know, what would catch their eye and get them to buy that paper? Almost like Stan Lee. We were discussing the COVID was 90% of the impact of the sales was the COVID for Marvel Comics in the sixties, which is why the covers were so beautiful.
00:01:52.928 - 00:02:23.340, Speaker A: Stories were all right, you know, again, not to go on a huge tangent here, amazing Spider man, you know, one to 100. I do consider, I've mentioned this before, one of the great novels of the 20th century. I think it was Stan Lee's kind of magnum opus as a writer. Other than that, I think he was just. I don't want to say he was just filling in the blank, but to a large degree, he was. That's a whole other conversation. But all to say, I have a soft spot in my heart for what we open with.
00:02:23.340 - 00:03:43.196, Speaker A: And so here, what a provocative, interesting, delightful image that strange thing has made here. And it fits right in with our conversation of this, what we're calling the hyper postmodern here. This idea that Yuri J. Was bringing up of should with AI should we be, you know, trying to emulate painting with this kind of techno tool to kind of, you know, restate, to maybe oversimplify Uri J's point? And I think here, I. It's like I always start with the work itself and does the work hit me? And when we look at this work, you know, this, you know, black Jesus with the crown of thorns, with the hoodie or christlike figure, shall we call it, you know, with the crown of thorns, the nike, the hoodie, you know, the blood here and this, you know, really beautiful, frankly, background, dark background here. And this stunning cracking of the paint, fascinatingly, only on the clothing. Only on the clothing here.
00:03:43.196 - 00:04:51.444, Speaker A: So very, very, very cool work here. So to me, this is an example of why it is worthwhile. And we see it in music all the time where, like, in a sense, you could also kind of reframe Yuri J's very interesting and also provocative question. You could also think of that in the context of sampling, right? Like with, you know, should. You could say, should we be, as, you know, techno or hip hop artists, you know, whatever your sampler genre of choice is, sampler based music genre of choice is should we be sampling, you know, James Brown or craft work in order to. Rather than making just the synth noises, the fresh new noises with our new synthesizers, should we be bother sampling these older works? And I think if we look to music, we see clearly we should be. We have had so many great songs coming from this sampling process.
00:04:51.444 - 00:06:01.524, Speaker A: Clearly we should be. And I think this is just another example, another kind of angle on this is this is an image which simply wouldn't exist. And it's using, you might say, I want to say maybe the modalities or the craftsmanship, the technical, the techniques or referencing the techniques of renaissance art in order to provide, again, what kind of strange things. Main thing is contemporary fashion in a Renaissance AI context. And the final thing I want to say on this before, again, we have to run through this episode. And again, the pathos here, the pathos of this image, this almost emotionless, like, it does look like a Christ like gaze, powerful gaze here, the seriousness. The final thing I want to mention again, we've been talking about Jeff Koons within the context of this idea of referencing the past, the copies of the copies.
00:06:01.524 - 00:06:54.300, Speaker A: Here we have, you know, Jeff Koonz's team with the gazing Ball series. You know, of course, as we were saying, it was post modern. He was making a copy of the Mona Lisa painting because what they would do is they would paint the cracks as far as I could tell, that's what's going on there. And I thought to myself, what if, you know, strange thing, had Jeff Koonz's team, could you imagine? I mean, if you saw a brilliantly painted image like this, painted with, again, Jeff Koonz's team, where you couldn't even really tell. It was so well done. And this was an oil painting, right? Like the gazing ball series, minus the gazing ball. You would think this, like, that would be mind altering, at least for me, that would be mind altering.
00:06:54.300 - 00:07:23.072, Speaker A: And I would go, that is amazing. So, once again, I start with the image. I start with the pathos of the image, with the power of the image. This, you know, very high res, detailed, beautiful, beautifully colored shot with this black background here. It's very powerful. So many good decisions here. And even the beard here, we see its AI up close here.
00:07:23.072 - 00:07:43.454, Speaker A: But there is a touch of that kind of Raphael type beard curl, if you know what I'm talking about. Perfect little curls that we know from Raphael. So just a really interesting, provocative work. Now, there was a. A quote here from strange. Greater love than this. No man hath that a man lay down his life for his friends.
00:07:43.454 - 00:08:03.542, Speaker A: John 1513. So, I mean, just awesome, if you ask me, just totally awesome. Here, let me bring this up a little larger. So very cool work. And another very interesting work while we're on here. Now, I'm going to have to speed through this so that we don't. So that this computer doesn't collapse on me.
00:08:03.542 - 00:08:17.184, Speaker A: But I think we're good. I think we're good. This was quite interesting as well, of course. Strange thing. Very prolific, putting out a ton of work. I thought this was an interesting move. A spray painted GM over top, dripping, I assume.
00:08:17.184 - 00:08:46.830, Speaker A: Once again, I assume this was done with AI. It's an interesting question. Was this done manually with some sort of, you know, digital paint spray, or was this done with AI? Pretty interesting question. And again, using this pose, which I think is taken from a giorgone, if I'm not mistaken. I mean, it's very recognizable, but I'm never placing it. We're almost back to this, you know, hyper postmodern. What is the referent here? Referent.
00:08:46.830 - 00:09:37.538, Speaker A: And look at these wonderful cracks here, as I always say, fetishistically done. And this Renaissance landscape here, but unrecognizable, but familiar, fascinating. With, again, what looks like a modern breakfast. We see the toaster, you know, the sliced bread, the manufactured bread, interestingly, off white in the coffee cup there. A delicious breakfast, you know, and then again, we see almost a Salvador Dali like tablecloth here. So all to say, just spectacular work from the great strange thing coming up, we have neutral arts collective on the Twitter space, and I think they were at the Bosque Grazias workshop or residency. They've been up to all sorts of things on Zora and so.
00:09:37.538 - 00:09:55.098, Speaker A: And also, I think, on object as well. We're going to find everything out. So if you're curious about neutral arts again, I think out of Latin America there, they're going to be on the show. It's going to be a big learning session. There may be a few artists. We'll see who they bring. So that should be great.
00:09:55.098 - 00:10:12.110, Speaker A: Looking forward to that. That is coming up this today at 330. So if you're watching this, it may be live at 09:30 a.m. Eastern time. It's now 230. I just realized that it's 230 in Berlin. Wow.
00:10:12.110 - 00:10:27.044, Speaker A: I'm glad I. Wow. I almost might have missed my own artist, my own Twitter space had I not been on top of things here. Okay, Pp universal, some comments from last show. Great show, Poco. Hope you have a great week and thanks for the feature. You're more than welcome, Pp.
00:10:27.044 - 00:10:39.272, Speaker A: A brilliant work by PP I found on Instagram of a computer. We're going to look at that one. Cider. Good morning, brother. Thank you for the appearance, as always. Awesome episode two. Well, thank you and awesome to hear from you.
00:10:39.272 - 00:10:55.826, Speaker A: Just brilliant work from cider, as usual. Energy web blockchain solutions sailing into the great unknown. I love it. Let's go. Kudos from California, Canada, a fellow canadian there. So awesome. Great to hear from you and welcome aboard.
00:10:55.826 - 00:11:35.334, Speaker A: And radda ahoy. Ready to board the pirate ship of the imagination. Mind is in the brain, no doubt about it. As we were saying, where's the mind? Is it, you know, is it all of the nervous system? You know, I was thinking about Radha's comment, actually, because this came about a day ago, as it says here. And it is interesting because you can cut off your arm and you're still there, but you can't cut off the head. So there may be something to what Raddha is saying, but maybe also you could just say that the mind or the brain is just essential, but maybe we can still think of it as. Who knows? Anyways, awesome to hear from you, Rada, and also from Sabato here.
00:11:35.334 - 00:11:52.588, Speaker A: Great comment and very useful comment. Actually, no, poco, get a pc laptop instead of a Mac, you can buy an amiga forever. License. Total alpha here. Thank you, Sabato. And make deluxe paint art with the entire gang. You can easily emulate and glitch video game roms.
00:11:52.588 - 00:12:21.012, Speaker A: You can interface with the dead. You can get a gaming laptop with twice the memory and video specs as a MacBook for the same cost. Plus your pc computer will have cool led lights. Pc computer, very interesting. I mean, what I like about the Mac, and I actually have a pc that I bought for glitchrom a year and a half ago, but I probably spent too little on it. It's a terrible pc, but it's a 300 euro pc. So I just got the cheapest pc you could so that I could try and make roms.
00:12:21.012 - 00:12:44.880, Speaker A: But, you know, I didn't know about this Amiga forever license. That is pretty rad. Like, there is definitely. I agree with what Sabato is saying here in terms of there is. There are grounds to get a pc computer. As a digital artist, what I do love about the Mac is despite my issues with video, I don't have a separate video thing that I put on. The camera is good enough.
00:12:44.880 - 00:13:09.832, Speaker A: It's kind of good to go. And I find it a little less crashy, despite all of the issues I've been having recently. But, I mean, I put this thing through the ringer. We have probably. I probably have 100 5175 tabs here. Maybe I'm exaggerating, maybe I'm wrong, but I put this thing through the ringer and then with all that open, then I hit record and it does hold up. So thank you for that, though.
00:13:09.832 - 00:13:26.940, Speaker A: Great alpha there on the amiga forever license. Cause I would love to join that party. Sabato. And a big happy birthday also to Sabato, whose birthday it was. Sabato Visconti. So thank you for that. And go wish Sabato a happy visconti.
00:13:26.940 - 00:13:44.850, Speaker A: Go wish Sabato a happy birthday. A wonderful, great artist who we've started this program with many times in the past year. Let's continue here. A few more comments. Denise, thank you for the comment. Actually, we have a work of yours in the final part of the program, simulacra. We also have a work from you.
00:13:44.850 - 00:14:17.876, Speaker A: The laptop is going strong. Indeed it is. Indeed it is, Kels. I don't want to push my luck, though, trying to imagine how it would feel to be kayla perhaps hearing. So I think probably this brilliant genial artist here who started last show with an incredible artist. The joy, the humor, the hilarity of the work. Imagine how to feel to be kayla perhaps hearing from a friend of this guy, Adrian, talking about your work then actually watching the review.
00:14:17.876 - 00:14:34.632, Speaker A: And you're right. Such brilliant stuff. It must be the rarest and most excellent feeling. Awesome, Voco. Glad you enjoyed that. And I was thrilled to make that discovery. It was immediately I said this, those talents where you say I have to start with this huge talent there.
00:14:34.632 - 00:14:48.552, Speaker A: Ilay hundredths like glad your laptop is operational. That's great. Completely understanding regarding total freedom. I felt the same way with my laptop. Sorry, the pronunciation of peony. Peony alludes you still. I tried.
00:14:48.552 - 00:15:06.192, Speaker A: Indeed you did. Sometimes my memory is not wonderful because we even read it out loud here. How to promote. As I say, my memory could be better. Thank you again for all the support Ilay over the many, many months here turning into years here. Tornado Rodriguez. Thanks Boco, for showing my work.
00:15:06.192 - 00:15:19.968, Speaker A: Have a couple of more brilliant works here from Tornado Rodriguez. Awesome to hear from you. Lucas Lejeune, awesome to hear from you. And we have a work by Lucas here, a collaboration. Ima Troz, my new radio in the morning. Thanks for your time. Poco.
00:15:19.968 - 00:15:29.908, Speaker A: Awesome. And we have a Twitter space again coming up this Wednesday. It's every Wednesday at 09:30 a.m. Eastern time in New York. There. Leprochant Gogo. Now I'm watching Ranix.
00:15:29.908 - 00:16:21.194, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you as well as you. Leprochant and Chrome show is always hilarious. And we have the soccer, the sports, you know, very interesting, isn't it? This whole idea of sports being particularly interesting. It's subject matter which we were kind of discovering during the show, I'd argue last show, maybe it's all the bodies in motion here, the drama of the body, because usually in artworks we see the body is kind of muted. There's not much happening, unless it's like a mythological scene where someone's fighting a mythological creature, which maybe is part of what gives the drama, the body in action. It's kind of an interesting thought. And is that what's going on with images like this, even? There's a dynamism, an excitement, just kind of interesting.
00:16:21.194 - 00:16:35.318, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment. Chrome Yoao laptop is in shape. Thank you. Lubedel, who makes those hilarious gifs. Cool episode. Thanks for your work. I noticed how uncomfortable you were, because the very small size of the GiF, 200 by 200 by two.
00:16:35.318 - 00:17:10.454, Speaker A: We discussed this issue with Nietrich, and his argument in favor of a larger zoom was precisely the inconvenience of the display. Now I see it. Yes. And so I say, you might as well. I mean, that's how I treat it with the magnification if you're going to go once, why not go twice? Because it is from a collector's point of view, it's a real delight to be able to go up close. It's a whole other viewing experience seeing pixel art up close. And so if you're going to magnify it once, why not magnify it twice or four times? So awesome to hear, Selwaki.
00:17:10.454 - 00:17:28.344, Speaker A: I'm glad the laptop is still working. Me too. Thank you for the comment and skull takes. And this is actually coming up here, I think maybe next tab. Thanks, Moca Belly, for showing my little print studio. It is linocut. I use small blocks in water based ink, so it's really easy to do in a home studio or small space.
00:17:28.344 - 00:17:54.344, Speaker A: No press yet. I just use a wooden spoon and the power of what I call humble tools here. And here's a linocut for those that are wondering. And you take, I should bring it up here. I actually have these tools. You have like, basically a scraper that you just kind of push along and you get these beautiful, you know, results here. Again, very physical world results where all the little accidents happen.
00:17:54.344 - 00:18:16.030, Speaker A: So let's pray the everything doesn't collapse. And here, I think this is a result. Look at how good quality this is for those people that have done linocut. That's actually not that easy to get what skull has done here to do what skull has done. And cool idea. Using different colored paper. Different kinds of paper.
00:18:16.030 - 00:18:31.078, Speaker A: Love it, love it, love it. And also, the community is bustling here. A few works. This will actually be in the show. So thank you, everybody, for continuing to contribute here. It is a precious feed. A lot of these works are going to be in the show.
00:18:31.078 - 00:18:54.794, Speaker A: Some will be in future shows. And so I kind of work them in where I can. Again, we have 175, maybe 175 tabs open here, if I had to guess, rural idol. Great to hear from you, too. And we have a comment coming from rural idol. So the community continues to look at this. Just awesome, awesome work there.
00:18:54.794 - 00:19:14.412, Speaker A: So I'm going to keep going back to find more work. Study here to mine out of here. Thank you, everybody, for the contributions there. Now another comment from rural idol. This is. I thought it was an interesting art comment. I wish I'd had the guts to be an artist instead of hedging my bets in commercials.
00:19:14.412 - 00:19:48.104, Speaker A: Everyone going all in age 20 or something. Nothing but respect for you. A really nice comment here. And it's very much the jury is out. Like, I know a lot of people say in the Berlin art scene, you know, they would never be able to buy an apartment, and they're in their forties or fifties, you know, I'm probably one of them, right? And so, you know, if rural idol, it's a different lifestyle to a large degree. To a large degree, but not entirely. And again, it's more of a boom bust, you know, and it depends, like, do you have a family? Because, you know, all these things kind of matter.
00:19:48.104 - 00:20:39.884, Speaker A: But to your point, the younger you are, the more you can afford to kind of screw things up and it not succeed, because then all of a sudden, if you're 30 and you're starting again and let's say you decide to go into commercials because it didn't work from 20 to 30, it's not the end of the world. So I thought, a really nice comment there from rural idol. And on that same theme, here's toques. Since embracing nfts for my art in 2021, my life has transformed entirely. And tooks, I believe, is in Brazil, transitioning from a nine to five job at a shopping mall where I struggled to afford basic necessities for my newborn son and newlywed wife. We lived on about $250 per month. So again, I think in Brazil, this would be impossible in Europe or North America, but so I think in Brazil, entering the NFT space changed everything.
00:20:39.884 - 00:21:29.362, Speaker A: In just the first year, I was able to buy a car, a thought that was once unimaginable. Now I'm in the process of buying a brand new house. It's absolutely mind blowing. Who would have thought? So it's important. We really do, as digital artists, have to be grateful really to this crypto scene. Like, it has to be kind of recognized that these investors, speculators, just being within the ecosystem of crypto where there is so much money is incredibly, is something that has, you know, enabled tuks to buy a house. Okay, so this is, we have to be, you know, as I kind of have said, I think a couple of times before, where would you rather be as an artist? Like, I'm.
00:21:29.362 - 00:22:03.736, Speaker A: I love being here in the digital art scene. You know, it's, it's just the costs are negligent and the benefits, you can make money pretty easily. So it's a wonderful place to be despite sometimes liquidity issues and whatnot. It's still a wonderful place to be despite having no formal education, dropping out of university due to financial constraints, battling drug abuse, family abuse and mental health. I've come this far against all odds. I stand here today. It's never been easy so all to say, here I am, unstoppable and ready for more.
00:22:03.736 - 00:22:24.008, Speaker A: And I think of Brian Tracy, the great life coach. If you're ever down on your lucky Brian Tracy, unstoppable. Just awesome. Demon ego, another success story here. I'm looking at everything now and maybe the 20th time. I can't believe it. I became one of the artists whose works was selected in the one of ones category.
00:22:24.008 - 00:22:49.938, Speaker A: This is for optimism's contest. My words are inadequate to express my surprise, happiness and excitement. I'm going by the shortest route. I'm very happy right now and I can't explain the joy we felt when I shared this news with my wife while I was on holiday. I congratulate all 188 artists among the winners. So I think the payoff is pretty big with optimism here. So just totally awesome.
00:22:49.938 - 00:23:08.458, Speaker A: So optimism. Continuing to reward artists. Interestingly, another post here from demon ego. Good night. I would like to thank you very much for again the love shown to my art and the congratulatory messages I received as a result of the competition. I hope all my artist friends experience these feelings. I send my best wishes to you.
00:23:08.458 - 00:23:36.938, Speaker A: And what I have to say is it sure seems a lot more common out here in the crypto land than it does in the, you know, physical world, you know, in the contemporary art scene. So it feels like it's just a little more possible out here. And I end the day with my work that I entered in the competition. So this is the work that won while waiting the deaths of those I admire. So a classic demon ego work here. Signature demon ego. So very cool.
00:23:36.938 - 00:23:57.340, Speaker A: Mixing mediums there. So congratulations to demon ego and to tukes. And finally here from demon ego. I'm the same person I was yesterday. Approach people art with the same love, respect and tolerance. Hope everyone can achieve the success they desire without harming others, without feeling angry, holding grudges or being jealous. These feelings are no use to anyone.
00:23:57.340 - 00:24:26.402, Speaker A: They never have been. And I think this is the important thing to remember. Like, for those that do feel envious or jealous, this is actually a natural feeling. But success is fleeting, particularly in the arts. It's pretty rare that you get people that kind of get success, remain successful and keep building. It does happen, but it's not very common. So you really just have to be happy for anybody where great things happen to them.
00:24:26.402 - 00:24:55.850, Speaker A: In this, you just have to be happy for them. This is not common and it's not like these things stay necessarily for a long time. So when the success comes, be happy for those people. I totally agree with what demon ego is saying. The key is to keep working, finding your own path and fighting for your dreams as demon ego has. We had demon ego on the spaces maybe six months ago. It was a great space and I do have them all ready to upload.
00:24:55.850 - 00:25:28.530, Speaker A: I just need to do some basic editing on each of them and the Spotify will be getting a massive update here shortly. Zach so I wasn't exactly sure what their new initiative here at Zora. Maybe we can figure this out here. Zach Krebbit we have a bunch of new initiatives directly supporting artists over at our Zora. At Zora. One of them is the new 1111 series where we deploy an NFT and set the automatic split to benefit a curated artist. New funding models for a new Internet this month's 1111 funding will support the work.
00:25:28.530 - 00:26:22.414, Speaker A: So maybe Zora puts out an NFT and then just decides, kind of, you know, we're going to give it to this artist, the split on it. This month's 1111 funding will support the work of Tyler Givens, a visionary, multidisciplinary artist based in New York, crafting a groundbreaking aesthetic, infusing fantasy and existential themes. So more kind of wins, a lot of wins in this space, and we have to be thrilled about it. Tyler pushes the boundaries with innovative image making, leveraging 3d modeling software and custom AI models to captivate audiences with creativity and evocative narratives. So again, we have to recognize, I think most of us, if not all of us do, that. We are in the crypto ecosystem here. And again, when you see stories like this, where would you rather be? This is one within the last.
00:26:22.414 - 00:26:58.926, Speaker A: Since the last show, we have kind of three big good news stories here from artists, and that's not like super common here. I'm going to keep running here because the computer, I'm getting concerned. Less than 24 hours in this has generated 2.36 ETH, which is close to like $9,000, 80% of which will go directly to the featured artist. So that artist is basically getting $8,000 new funding models for a new era of global creativity. Awesome work, sack and just totally cool. August I wonder if object ever regrets the fact that they are all in on tezos.
00:26:58.926 - 00:27:15.832, Speaker A: Like many of us. Like many of us at least they are strong life raft. They engage and are deeply involved in the community and ethos. Without object tea and effectshash, tazos would be dead in the water. Yes. And so kind of riffing off of the earlier conversation that was being had. Let's see what happens.
00:27:15.832 - 00:27:50.718, Speaker A: I say, you know, let's see what happens. And another comment from August ground. So why doesn't Tezos foundation or trilatec do something like optimism just did, and reward the artists who could benefit the most? Why does Tezos do something, anything to generate positive pr? Isn't the bear over where is the leadership? So voicing a lot of, I think, the sentiment among people out there. So it continues. Retro Manny my goal was to create a cinematic. So creating audiobooks. This may be the first audiobook that I've heard of on the blockchain.
00:27:50.718 - 00:28:28.460, Speaker A: My goal was to create a cinematic cyberpunk audiobook, one that could give the big publishers a run for their money. Six of ten chapters done, and I couldn't be prouder of what I've accomplished so far. Huge thank you to everyone that stuck with me on this journey. So pretty cool. Tezos Outpost 2049 simulacrum strangers this is pretty cool. So more innovation happening here on the blockchain, courtesy of Retro Manny Kika Nikolayla, the curator over at object one. Is there anyone who still says AI art is not art? My first fine art prints from my AI art on 100% cotton paper, which will last about 100 years.
00:28:28.460 - 00:28:50.704, Speaker A: They look stunning in person. And they do. They look quite vibrant is actually how I'd put it, in these great colors here. Look at these. They're gorgeous prints, aren't they? So nice. You know, inkjet can be a tricky way of doing it, but if you pick the right paper, and I assume it's inkjet, I'm not positive. Here.
00:28:50.704 - 00:29:13.568, Speaker A: Ready to be mounted tomorrow and put for sale Friday to Sunday at the limited art fair in my favorite art place in Brussels, the villa en pain. I might use NFTs as certificate of authenticity, so web3 collectors could also buy their edition of ten. Very cool. They look great. Kika. Mumble boy. More analog may mean less digital, but it's the digital that feeds the analog for me.
00:29:13.568 - 00:29:39.568, Speaker A: So I've been speculating here for a few weeks on what mumble boy is up to. Here is a massive clue as to it looks pretty complicated, but you see the exacto knives here, or the paper cutter, and you see what's going on. So from physical to digital and back, a powerful method. And here's tornado Rodriguez. Also, work in progress. Storytelling takes time. You can find this piece for seven.
00:29:39.568 - 00:30:00.226, Speaker A: Tazo, $0.77. So $10 on. And here we see, you know, sort of like we were seeing with Ed, just this blocking in. I'm learning this as I try and do it myself. Demon ego. Our collab work with my dear friend Chris Doctor WVR Chris war selected to be showcased at Beeple Studio. So more good news for Demon ego.
00:30:00.226 - 00:30:26.384, Speaker A: Now going to be at Beeple Studio's upcoming event, digital art deathmatch. I think Pixel Lord is also going to be in that. Thank you so much people for this opportunity. So again, working hard, putting your head down, trying out new things, paying off for demon ego and also posting this. Just a really nice physical work here, as you see. But you know, little, maybe that's tape or little kind of patterns here being cut in. Just a really interesting artist.
00:30:26.384 - 00:30:54.594, Speaker A: Very nice piece here. Continuing on, also traveling through the mediums here, element li with again, this posting this. Interestingly, as an NFT on object, we have another kind of laser engraving acrylic and cardboard. So this has been posted here as an NFT. And this went for 250 tezos to trippie collector. So great sale there for element ly matter particle. A one of one.
00:30:54.594 - 00:31:13.714, Speaker A: I don't think that includes the physical. It's an interesting question. Donnie app 48 hours Twitter auction. Bidding starts at $150 plus shipping and handling. The circuit glitch cam comes with a cute carrying case to keep your camera safe and feature several cool photo modes to complement the glitch. That is amazing. Different photo modes.
00:31:13.714 - 00:31:26.602, Speaker A: Wow. That is really cool. There's even tetris on this thing. The camera will also be signed if the buyer chooses. Drop bids below. Last minute bids will extend clock by 1 hour each time to prevent sniping. Very cool there.
00:31:26.602 - 00:32:05.154, Speaker A: And here is John Cates. I don't think we looked at this and we'll see if the computer we'll see if the computer responds here. John Cates has discussed in the Monday morning we're getting a little delay here in the Monday morning meeting into my Kunsthaum or art space Lakeside exhibition proposal glitch western Far east cool concert of course. John Cates I believe is in Taipei, which I'm sharing with all y'all website pronounced Patreon. And there's John Cates, who looks like a pretty cool dude. Let's get into this Monday morning. Love the cowboy hats, the glitch cowboy.
00:32:05.154 - 00:32:25.622, Speaker A: Love it. So continuing on, exmortal in dreams is on this homepage of exchange art. Stoked to see this. This morning managed to get a work in progress of this one. Look at this setup by xmortal. So you see everything that goes into making an xmortal work. And you gotta love this like big tv or projector or whatever's going on here.
00:32:25.622 - 00:32:42.788, Speaker A: Very cool. So that's on exchange art and was on the homepage. And here is don't buy who I do follow that is a glitch on x. 30 minutes to the end of the daily XYZ auction fellowship. Current bids. And so it looks like there's bids almost across everything here. So very cool.
00:32:42.788 - 00:32:58.524, Speaker A: We looked at a couple of these works. I think we saw the vase with the recycling bin. So congrats to don't buy. So things are booming. I would submit. Here is rinifish at super chief. Cats Twitter spaces is live now.
00:32:58.524 - 00:33:13.984, Speaker A: Join us. And here is rinifish. And you got to love how they displayed the cat. It is a cat, I believe, here. And this was a collaboration, so that was very cool. And here's another work. So the cats at super chief, and I think that's in New York, but not positive.
00:33:13.984 - 00:33:44.726, Speaker A: And this was interesting too. Paloma Rodriguez from Super air. Love to see Adam ad at Adam dispro at super Rare and the art crush gallery, who they've been putting these public displays of the artwork around. They did it with one of mine. I'm still looking for the video. I downloaded it on my hard drive and I can't find it all to say this looks awesome and it's great to see super rare curators, you know, just giving shout outs to artists. I think that's awesome.
00:33:44.726 - 00:34:18.462, Speaker A: More. I think something's going on at super rare, which is why part of the reason I brought that up because, and we'll see it here, too. I think they're making another push is sort of what my kind of editorial kind of what I'm kind of sniffing out here. On December 12, 2023, a curator of super rare, this is Kayley van Fossen, reached out to me and asked if I'd be interested to join super air. As an artist, I'd have been quietly creating my most special and complex artwork I have ever made. I've teased this work in progress a few times and I am thrilled to share that. Not only is it finally done, but it's my best and most favorite masterpiece to date.
00:34:18.462 - 00:34:45.394, Speaker A: So again, and here is maybe part of it. And there's, you see a little animation here and some cool music, if you can hear that. So a little preview there. So very interesting. Again, we see the website redesign. You can get the sense super rare again is making another push. You don't know who we are.
00:34:45.394 - 00:35:05.662, Speaker A: Ancient tokens creation live on collector sh. Let me make sure we're not getting volume there. We go and we'll see if this loads back up. Look at the computer. You can tell we're not going to test our luck here. We're going to keep running here. So collector sh your digital gallery.
00:35:05.662 - 00:35:20.350, Speaker A: So there is a GLB with Sky Goodman and several. You don't know who we are. Salawaki. So as you can see here, just some awesome artists. I think Sabato is in this too. Arch Genesis from hell. So a GLB exhibition.
00:35:20.350 - 00:35:31.416, Speaker A: Very cool. Lidice, Santiago, Edmarola. A lot of familiar names here. So a lot of people. We're going to keep running here. Strange P and more. There's Sabato.
00:35:31.416 - 00:35:55.398, Speaker A: Cyber mystic is doing the vending tes vending machine, which is now, I think maybe getting called the vending machine project because of course we saw the story where they ETH. They're getting an ETH grant. So that is pretty rad. So look at this. You gotta love. So of course, all the artists are redoing the vending machine by one, by three. Very cool.
00:35:55.398 - 00:36:19.374, Speaker A: And as you're gonna see here. And let me just actually close that for memory issues. So Marcelo Pinel has put out a whole bunch of works as part of the tes vending machine. So here, edition of 52 sent. Sorry, sent to the vending machine. What is now being called the vending machine here is bull and bear. So cool work there.
00:36:19.374 - 00:36:36.114, Speaker A: And so I missed when this is going to start, but I think it's going to start right away. Here's Inferno. Very cool. So just a whole bunch of works here made by Marcelo Pinel. Phoenix. Kind of these mythological creatures. See if this plays.
00:36:36.114 - 00:37:04.254, Speaker A: There you go. So another just awesome work here. Should probably close these, although they are going to be in the curation, so I should keep those open. Mandrake. So another, I think that's a root, a plant root. Interesting piece here. So just to give you a quick kind of look see of what Marcelo Pinella is up to with the tez.
00:37:04.254 - 00:37:20.154, Speaker A: With the vending machine. With the vending machine project. And here, this looks like the ouroboros, the snake eating its tail. And that is indeed what it is. Cool work there. And here's salamander. So just really cool work here.
00:37:20.154 - 00:38:00.376, Speaker A: Maybe I will close these and add them after because they may be taking a lot of ram here and we don't want to sacrifice the show here. And because of course, I have the space at 230 here in Berlin, which is an hour earlier than normal. So all to say, very, very cool work here. Let me just quickly close these. And one more pelican kind of has a bit of a. What is that mythological tale where the crow eats the guy who Promethea, Prometheus, who stole fire. And then, of course, the birds eating, I think, the kidney, if I'm not mistaken, or the liver of Prometheus.
00:38:00.376 - 00:38:14.076, Speaker A: And it growing back every day was the punishment. So I'll just say, look at all these works. So a ton of Marcelo Pinel works available in the vending machine. This is a great one, too. Unicorn. Beautiful. Just a ton of awesome work here.
00:38:14.076 - 00:38:57.224, Speaker A: So there you have it. Now here's Zuozo, the great Zuozo, misty ottoman koda. Another totally rad experimental work here. Just see if we can. So another totally experimental wild work here from Zuozo. Totally rad. Like, where does this come from? What dark region of the brain does this come from? Or a very light region of the brain? Only three tezos edition of 20.
00:38:57.224 - 00:39:13.060, Speaker A: Very, very cool work from Zuozo. As usual. Here's Nuve 1914. Few pretty interesting works here, too. So more experiments. Kind of looks like a woman figure here. Maybe some flowers and some abstraction on El Parque.
00:39:13.060 - 00:39:31.270, Speaker A: So maybe in the park, maybe with an animal here. Edition of one. So the edition is a wonner bag for nine tazos. I would have bought this for my mom. My mom does flamenco dancing, flamenco bele edition of one, selling for nine tezos. I would have loved to have picked this up. So.
00:39:31.270 - 00:39:53.954, Speaker A: And even my mom had the red dress there. So shout out to mom if you're watching this. Just really cool work. Thought of you when I saw this. Cool work by NuV, 1914. Here's Ed Marolla ladder again, playing with these sampled brushes and then putting over top different kind of techniques here with this person in a ladder. Big kind of figure here.
00:39:53.954 - 00:40:09.614, Speaker A: Very interesting work from Ed Marolla. Really pushing things. This is an edition of one for 55 tazos. You get a one of one Ed Morolla for. Pretty reasonable there. A gracious lady. This is a digital drawing by board me social club or BMSC.
00:40:09.614 - 00:40:31.294, Speaker A: And we see the Rubik's cube again, and a lightsaber. And just beautiful colors here. Beautifully painted. Kind of three eyes, kind of Sci-Fi on fire, and an interesting Mickey Mouse figure in the background there. Some palm trees and just beautifully painted. Very beautifully painted. Not worrying about perspective too much.
00:40:31.294 - 00:40:50.198, Speaker A: It has its own perspective, which I really enjoy. It kind of reminds me of medieval perspective. Very nicely painted here, as you see with the cigarette and the ashtray. Five tezos edition of ten two gone. Beautiful. Here is la Delmas with another great work here. This is on forest of broken hearts.
00:40:50.198 - 00:41:09.834, Speaker A: Awesome title, too. A brilliant work. I brought it up big here so you can get a feel for how detailed this is. So look at the grass and everything. Awesome color, awesome composition. And there's the, I think the Kitkat clock in red. Interestingly great forest.
00:41:09.834 - 00:41:21.904, Speaker A: Just beautiful work here. Just, you know, the rabbits coming out of the tree. Just a very cool work. How many mints? 32 minted so far. Pretty good. And how many days old? Not sure. Maybe six days old.
00:41:21.904 - 00:41:41.876, Speaker A: And continuing on PP universal. Just came across this on Instagram. Very interesting piece here of this old computer. Just very cool. Can't read the Spanish there. I assume this is on tezos, but not sure. Very cool work from Pipa Universal.
00:41:41.876 - 00:42:03.388, Speaker A: A couple of works dropped on x from axine. And I think this is pretty interesting, kind of the sketchbook layout and just some sketches here. And the unhappy face. Happy face. A little bit of, you know, text here. Just very interesting work. And I think dopamine boost.
00:42:03.388 - 00:42:22.200, Speaker A: And of course, I follow Euxine. That is a glitch on X. And I thought this was funny, too. Also by Euxine, playing off of the bull and bear market. Fetishistic logic. When you feel strong when things are up and weak when things are down in the chart. Power of money.
00:42:22.200 - 00:42:42.482, Speaker A: And there's the person with the suit and the skull and you see it in the eyes, don't you? All time high. Brilliant. Here's Lord Neutron with a wild orc that I found on Instagram here. The ghost 2024. Just a really enigmatic artist here. You're never quite sure. Like, I would never guess what software put this together.
00:42:42.482 - 00:42:55.914, Speaker A: Let's put it that way. Just very interesting artist. Kind of feels like there are physical elements, but you're not sure. Maybe photography involved. I'm not sure. Super interesting, Lord Neutron. Interesting suit by Dan control.
00:42:55.914 - 00:43:19.122, Speaker A: This may be older, but I'd never seen it before. I wasn't familiar with it. And pretty cool. Kind of has a Magritte feel to it, doesn't it? It's like the suit is full but no person inside, interestingly. And here is another really cool work, a fool's kit. Vape batteries and batteries listed on foundation. So I think this is new, exhibited during the 2024 SXSW film and tv festival.
00:43:19.122 - 00:43:41.306, Speaker A: So I thought this was great. Again, there are cigarettes, cigarette packages and are there vapes in here or lighters? And just taking, again, these elements, reusing elements like dan Control has done in the past. And then here's a different one. Here are vapes all put together. These look great. And then the batteries, maybe for the vape. Not sure.
00:43:41.306 - 00:44:10.742, Speaker A: Those are probably usb powered, I imagine. Who knows? Brilliant, brilliant work here by Dan Control, Flora Marquez, Ludovico Pattinson, bourgeois. So more in the fashion based series here on Zora. Eleven of 200 minted, so putting a limit, interestingly, on the mint here. I think it's still an open mint, though, as far as Fremont, I should say so. Just another beautiful work here. Nice kind of light gray background with a bit of shadow there.
00:44:10.742 - 00:44:29.684, Speaker A: Beautifully executed. And here we have boti cumbia. This is by Pamelo. And also on Zora, Pomelo's candy shop. Interesting painting here. Kind of almost looks like the same paintbrush as wasteman. So maybe this is done with Microsoft paint, but not sure.
00:44:29.684 - 00:44:53.544, Speaker A: Interesting texture. And just a fun work by Pomelo on Zora. Here's Pipa. Universal. Again, I thought this was interesting. A new one for universal dreams collection in Zora, collage from old drawings I did, painted with watercolors and colored pencils, and finally passed through Photoshop to stick them together. So again, working through old work and repeating things a little bit, using them in Photoshop.
00:44:53.544 - 00:45:28.762, Speaker A: Interesting reuse of elements here in a completely different way. And here's mumble boy, who we're looking at at the beginning of the show, we saw in the studio, working with physical and digital. Napolequa, I think you'd say anything would be the translation and just all could be anything. So again, we saw some hints and clues there that there is actually, in fact, physical involved here. But here you see it looks more digital. So a combination of digital and physical. It almost looks like probably physical for the composition.
00:45:28.762 - 00:46:11.434, Speaker A: And then digital comes in as another layer to kind of fix things up a bit, so to speak, correct the errors, as I would say, twelve tezos edition of one. So reasonable. Here's Kyle Flemmer Snow sprite. And we saw something kind of along these lines from rustic at one point, I think, with Super Mario. So here we see kind of a different take on it with the snow, what looks like a princess figure, snow White, and then repeated and almost just kind of distorted out. So again, painting with these kind of video game elements, pretty, pretty cool. And it looks great, doesn't it? And so that's an addition of one for only 420.
00:46:11.434 - 00:46:28.266, Speaker A: So a bid was, has been placed. So this is an auction. So cool work from Kyle Flemmer. Here is critical cheese. And we are still recording. Everything is in business here. So another addition to the series here from the ever prolific walk.
00:46:28.266 - 00:46:49.750, Speaker A: Gotta love it when people take an idea and just run with it as walk does. Just very cool. Here is gloom tube, a cascading series of past and future selves. So here's the gloom tube figure. And kind of this very interesting texture here. A different take on Gloomtube's work here. Almost looks like Xerox photocopies.
00:46:49.750 - 00:47:16.450, Speaker A: Or an airbrush tool in the digital art. A digital airbrush tool. This is 333 edition of 33 from Gloom tube. And here is RJ Internet head, which is a pixel reimagining of Francis Bacon's head from 1947 to 48. Didn't realize that was such an old painting. And this is the full size here. And interesting stuff going on here with the pixelation and stretching out and even just these kind of square areas.
00:47:16.450 - 00:47:28.066, Speaker A: A true interpretation here by RJ. A pixel reimagining Internet head. That is. Twelve tezos and five are gone. Nice piece. And here's another one. Rustic digital art.
00:47:28.066 - 00:47:47.044, Speaker A: G. Another Game Boy color appropriation. But again, substituting the content here, this time animated. And this is an edition of five and sold out for $4.20 each. Nice work. And this is a work also by Rustic made on object 98, object paint 98.
00:47:47.044 - 00:48:10.216, Speaker A: And this is an edition of seven. I think this sold out is on secondary now for 15. Just interesting piece here. Again, it's awesome to try out different softwares. This is the power of trying out different softwares because all of a sudden it just brings about different work. Right? And it's like. I guess it's like a techno or a hip hop artist, you know, trying out a new synth.
00:48:10.216 - 00:48:33.164, Speaker A: And also, you know, because the know how is still there. The wisdom, the art wisdom that has been accumulated over a lifetime is still there. But then you bring it to a new tool and then different things come out, which is quite interesting. So there's a real value in trying out new tools. Rustic digital art. This is sold out at two tezos each. And now 15 tezos on secondary.
00:48:33.164 - 00:48:54.004, Speaker A: And here's Tornado Rodriguez. Everything is not what it seems. I don't think we looked at this one. It was March 12. No, this just came out yesterday. So another great work here with synths, guitars, and what I'm tempted to call the Tornado Rodriguez figure, but I'm not positive on that. And their house pet and on a couch and everything.
00:48:54.004 - 00:49:13.080, Speaker A: Interesting. So this big eye, it's almost like a giant is coming into the house and taking out the figure. Everything is not what it seems sold out at 333 each. And that is an addition of eight. I thought this one was great too, doing nothing, thinking about everything. Also coming out yesterday. So working pretty fast here.
00:49:13.080 - 00:49:40.074, Speaker A: Beautiful work here. Nice big kind of composition. And there is, again, tempting to say, the tornado Rodriguez character. You know, it's one of those phenomenons of this digital art scene where people create characters. We see it with Ratcloak, we see it with myth particularly. I think it's an interesting phenomenon. So all to say this is just now, is this a one of one? This is an edition of eight and not listed yet.
00:49:40.074 - 00:50:01.620, Speaker A: And I think taking offers. Beautiful work here. Continuing to evolve a Guggenheim, the notifier, replenished honesty. So I guess we could put this under this surreal illustration banner here. Pretty interesting piece. Interesting kind of almost airbrush background. Kind of has a paper feeling to it.
00:50:01.620 - 00:50:20.644, Speaker A: Edition of 20 for five tezos each, three gone pretty good. I mean, everybody is selling, a few additions. This is the thing like and some selling out. And to me that's a healthy market. It's not like two or three artists are selling and then nobody else is selling, then we're in trouble. I see a healthy market here. Gem master, my precious.
00:50:20.644 - 00:50:34.008, Speaker A: And so this is a one of one by Uyo 66. Again, continuing with the red and blue 3d. Kind of look here. Kind of surreal illustration here too. Gem master. Cool title. Cool look.
00:50:34.008 - 00:51:13.850, Speaker A: Here's Seba Sestaro. So anxious GM again, just beautifully capturing these psychological spaces as we see the person here and we just get a sense these are all the people in that person's life, potentially perhaps, and just overwhelmed by all of these figures here. So anxious GM, really cool work from Sebas Estaro as usual. Murlakos junkyard and so here, we don't want to know. Mozilla or Firefox might just crash this entire computer. MuRlaco is here signing the work here, awesomely. Just another cool illustration here.
00:51:13.850 - 00:51:41.902, Speaker A: Kind of taking the 45 degree angle view here. Interesting angle. And then here a figure in the background here. Shell oil barrel and everything here. So just a cool work from Morlaco's cool illustration. Would fit really well with Ezra Eslin and the other artist whose name escapes me at the second here right now, Daniel W. Corporate bestiary number four.
00:51:41.902 - 00:52:05.616, Speaker A: So continuing the series here and here with hands holding up these kind of hands. So interesting piece here, edition of 18 for tezos each. And strange thing in Mikey Wilson picking up six left. Nice piece. Kelly from HR, hilarious blooming creation number seven. So this is Katarina create. This is an edition of 190 tezos.
00:52:05.616 - 00:52:19.384, Speaker A: Maybe that's on secondary. And these great mushrooms that are growing from the sky. Another great piece here. Yeah, that sent. The doctor collector picked that up for 60 tezos. Nice sale, $90.60 tezos.
00:52:19.384 - 00:52:36.160, Speaker A: And now on for 90 tezos. Great work. Dean Drayd, Carlos contact. So, a new artist I don't think I've seen before here. Cool kind of. Again, surreal illustration. You can have a whole show and you could probably just call it surreal illustration.
00:52:36.160 - 00:52:49.368, Speaker A: Contact. Exclamation mark edition of ten. Looks like it sold out. And now you got to put an offer in. So cool work there. Burka Bayram with a new work here. So long and thanks for all the fish.
00:52:49.368 - 00:53:04.200, Speaker A: Who was that again? Douglas Adams. Douglas Adams. And a homage, I guess, to Douglas Adams. And here we see dolphins flying through the stars here. I have never read hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. I probably should. Pretty cool work here.
00:53:04.200 - 00:53:21.360, Speaker A: Edition of 20 for 420 each. Oxygen picking one up, emilia Versace and more. Here is another artist. This is Santiago Rao with a different kind of work here. And this is on exchange art. A beautiful abstract here. And this is one sol.
00:53:21.360 - 00:53:41.190, Speaker A: And this was. Oh, this was listed two years ago. Wow, two years ago. So here's an early version of a Santiago rouault. I thought it was a new one, trying a different style. This is a two year old, so you see the evolution, actually, interestingly great looking work on exchange art. This is braindead.
00:53:41.190 - 00:53:59.690, Speaker A: So of course we saw all the user interfaces. System 8008, 610, g minor. We started g minor. So this symphony of pixel art machines here. Again, a different take on the whole pixel art factory with these beautiful colors here. Great sense of color from braindead. This is an edition of 25.
00:53:59.690 - 00:54:24.814, Speaker A: And these are 666 each. So that is on object. Here's Spiegel's maskinen with a cool work. Gn goodnight. With these computers and all these cubicles being just all the objects from the cubicles flying away there. From Spuegel's a fantasy for many of us who have worked in those cubicles. Kana Suzuki, a new work from Popple.
00:54:24.814 - 00:54:39.454, Speaker A: So more in this series here. So popple putting out a lot in this Tokei Jihan series. This is number three. And this is, I believe, sold out now. And now it's 29 tezos. And again, just very cool work here. Keeping it at one of.
00:54:39.454 - 00:55:02.364, Speaker A: You know, we were talking about magnification before with loubital here. Popple's keeping it. He's not doing the magnification. Interestingly 800 by 800. And again, combining probably generative art, I assume, with pixel art here in black and white and selling out at 17 tezos each. Nice work from Popple. Here's Rata with a work in progress.
00:55:02.364 - 00:55:21.362, Speaker A: Pretty exciting pixel artwork. Let's see what Rada says. Work in progress soon available on foundation. So pretty rad. Looking forward to seeing that. A depiction of a pirate ship. And it looks like a rat in battle here as the ship is being boarded.
00:55:21.362 - 00:55:41.516, Speaker A: That one looks totally awesome. So looking forward to that. Anis Abdin, memory lamp. And this came out March 7, so I don't saw this one. So another beautiful depiction of nature by Annas Abdin. As we see the lamp post here lighting up the snow, which are these big square pixels. Brilliant work here.
00:55:41.516 - 00:56:11.424, Speaker A: This is at a reserve of 0.32 on foundation. And here's a new work, day 71, all time high by Anus Abdin. And you can see a very subtle animation here in what looks like a sunset, with all of these wires of the power poles, of the pole, with the power wires looking up at the sky. All time high. Poetic work from honest Abdin. And here's Manidal and P one now.
00:56:11.424 - 00:56:25.932, Speaker A: So I don't think there's any. So this is. So maybe. So there's no music on this one. So a visual art collaboration. And maybe Mandal doing the top, I'm guessing, but not sure. And maybe p one doing the bottom.
00:56:25.932 - 00:56:40.894, Speaker A: Cool kind of comic book format here. Excuse me. And beautiful. What is it? Hire 69 by hr. 69 times ten. So you see how important for pixel art the size of the canvas is. This is 169 pixels.
00:56:40.894 - 00:57:08.618, Speaker A: You see how incredibly important it is because it really determines the size of everything. That is, if you keep the pixels the same size, another fun thing to do is export. And then all of a sudden, you export to a different size canvas, and then your pixels are a different size that can create a really cool contrast. Anyways, this is called here we go. Or here VR go edition of 30 for three tezos each. Quite a few go in already. Here's someone I found on Instagram.
00:57:08.618 - 00:57:40.670, Speaker A: A pixel artist. Two bit heartbreak, arts of win. And so hilarious, so wild. So wild and cool. Very, very cool work here. It's very interesting, I think, how the eight bit music accompanies the eight bit art, what I'm loosely calling eight bit art or two bit art. The pixel art.
00:57:40.670 - 00:57:55.278, Speaker A: Very interesting. Here's green ginger. Embrace the sunrise. Nice piece here. Beautiful depiction of the sunrise here. And interesting how the the city cycles out of it. Interesting.
00:57:55.278 - 00:58:31.614, Speaker A: And this person looking over that reminds me of the place we had in Porto at New Year's embrace. The sunrise. Two tazos, each edition of 20, if you going already, notorious man XTz mother Nature. More interesting pixel art here. And can we zoom in? This is the max. Zoom in and you see kind of a nature inspired work here. Maybe a mother goddess figure in green and a dithered gradient sky with these kind of psychedelic tribal lines, so to speak, on whatever's in the front here, these kind of poles of sorts.
00:58:31.614 - 00:58:54.488, Speaker A: Here's element Lee again. Dinner in the wild remake. Quite a totally poetic artist element Lee really enjoying. And look at this outrageous negative space that is, and all the white in the background there. And the subject matter, just really, really cool artist. Big fan. Dan.
00:58:54.488 - 00:59:16.302, Speaker A: Anthony Kelly homebody dog, I think does a dog every Tuesday if I'm not mistaken here. So here's the new one. Interesting work, you know, again, experimental pixel art, I'd say edition of five selling out at accepting offer of 15. These are pretty collectible, as you see here. Emilio Versace, 15 tezos. Nice work. Now you have to buy it.
00:59:16.302 - 00:59:27.554, Speaker A: There's one left at 15 tezos. Nice sale. Highway. This is silva sand two s. Nice simple glitch rom here. Very cool. Nice glitch and everything.
00:59:27.554 - 01:00:03.802, Speaker A: So that's highway world grand Prix pull to finish is the game edition of 30 for one tezos and one sold so far. Braun screenbreaker number double zero. Another interesting pixelated abstract work here from Braun. Pretty, just interesting work as we see some pixels static here, not moving, and other pixels moving. Creates a nice contrast there. And we see some stretching going on there. Just interesting edition of one for 23 tezos.
01:00:03.802 - 01:00:26.154, Speaker A: Here's Sean Luke Cuba serpents. A really interesting piece here, transferred maybe to previous collectors. And nice piece from Sean Luke on object here. And look at the frame. Kind of a different take on the frame here, too. 66 frames, 620 by 620. I should put the amount of frames when I do a gif.
01:00:26.154 - 01:00:44.346, Speaker A: Good idea. Dao testing has started on tea. So this is Antea Morgan hybe flowers, and this is called autocast gif. And this is an edition of 50 for only one tezos. See if we can get. So just a cool animated abstract here as we continue to run through this episode. But cool.
01:00:44.346 - 01:01:00.094, Speaker A: I think this is posted in the community. So thank you for posting that. This is awesome to see and just very cool. And like, just nice kind of contrast here. A great abstract. So thrilled to discover that. Strano, take a moment.
01:01:00.094 - 01:01:18.522, Speaker A: Interesting piece by Strano here. Kind of big pixelation kind of cycling through. And here's acid boy again. Back from a little break, I think, Jim. Dudes and dudettes. So a little bit of experimentation here from the wild psychedelic master there. Acid boy.
01:01:18.522 - 01:01:39.694, Speaker A: So just always cool. And 2000 views, pretty nice. And again, just great to see what acid boy is up to. I think it also has a really foundation and which we looked at last episode the day before the bull market. This is Joanie B. So great to see Joni B. This is kind of what seems to be a sad work.
01:01:39.694 - 01:02:03.464, Speaker A: And we see a kind of a dithered, if you can see that. It's kind of like this dithered house here on fire. And this is kind of sad because I think it's the story of a lot of people, actually. I lost everything before the bull market. So I no longer look at the behavior of candles. So, you know, the bear market, it can be a tricky beast. You know, like, you know, if I had done nothing, I'd probably be much better off during the bear market.
01:02:03.464 - 01:02:17.404, Speaker A: So it's interesting. So, you know, I didn't lose everything happily, thankfully. But I can relate somewhat to this sentiment. I think a lot of people can. I no longer look at the behavior of candles. Bearish, boring. Crypto is a dream.
01:02:17.404 - 01:02:35.694, Speaker A: Yes, indeed. This is an edition of one for 66 tezos. But, you know, it's. But I go back to the start of this episode. It's remarkable the amount of wins that happens in a short period of time. So I think there's something to be said for just kind of sticking with it too. Macro G matry.
01:02:35.694 - 01:03:04.446, Speaker A: So also a new discovery here in we looked at a couple of works by macro Matry, a newer account here. And so this was also posted in the community. So cool abstract here. And here's another one. Asymmetrico, same artist, matro G matry. As you can see, just a cool minimal work here. The edition of 28 and three or four or one transferred to Lucas Lejeune.
01:03:04.446 - 01:03:19.934, Speaker A: And three gone. DJ Kiro, picking up a couple and I think picking up a couple of the other one too. Max Strecker. It's awesome to see Max Drecker back. Composite number one. Just a really cool, I'd say static abstract artist. Kind of geometric abstract.
01:03:19.934 - 01:03:57.146, Speaker A: Kind of plays with these illusions a little bit and expectations. Very cool artist. Nice color, just interesting kind of og of tezos, I'd say 3000 by 3001 of the sort of earlier artists I discovered when I started kind of exploring on object there edition of one. And that was transferred and here's another one, composite number two. And this is listed for 50 tezos. And here again, just another interesting abstract with surprises along the way. Nice kind of light blue, light bluish gray background there, contrasting beautifully.
01:03:57.146 - 01:04:16.010, Speaker A: It's always a cool combination. Blue and red edition of one. Again, 50 tezos. Here's Sabato's birthday abstract here. Raw skies number 46. So I think bringing this from Solana, I think, not sure. And then listing this on tazos, I think 390.
01:04:16.010 - 01:04:41.056, Speaker A: And how many sold here? 40 editions. So nice work. So a birthday work here. Yeah, I picked up, I think at least one, or I think a couple of these works on Solana on exchange art way back when. The computer is freezing. I'm going to keep running here. Santiago, how do you feel about time? Another AI abstract here from Santiago.
01:04:41.056 - 01:04:59.234, Speaker A: Very cool work here. I'm concerned about this next work. Crashing the computer here. Let us see. Okay, cool. Almost 16,000 by 11,000 pixels seen. In the name of all saints, please, Santiago, do not crash my computer.
01:04:59.234 - 01:05:29.594, Speaker A: Here it is, though. This is why I kept it. I kept on wanting to take it out. I'm like, this is going to crash my browser. It's beautiful, though, isn't it? I'm not going to zoom in, but we're going to leave it there. That's 100 tezos edition of one and never to return in this show, at least the moment where all the thoughts take one direction, this is gone's interesting abstract. And as you see here, kind of has a touch of a Gerhard Richter feel to it, doesn't it, of those squeegee paintings.
01:05:29.594 - 01:05:50.750, Speaker A: So interesting work there. Edition of one for 75 tezos. And here's death, Retina drowning in a halicon days. I think maybe this was also listed in the community here. So another interesting discovery. Interesting abstract lot going on here. And interesting animation of color here, especially in the bottom right there.
01:05:50.750 - 01:06:04.554, Speaker A: And then you see it along the bottom there. Almost the entire frame is animated. Cool work. Edition of 25. And they are 25 tezos. Each accepting offers. So big audience here is this ad accept offer.
01:06:04.554 - 01:06:18.348, Speaker A: Oh, it is. So it's a combination of ad and death retina. Got it. Okay, awesome. So cool work there. 25 tezos. And how many are left? Eleven left on primary.
01:06:18.348 - 01:06:38.692, Speaker A: And here's Kodonakazono. Different kind of work here. CBZ number one. Totally different kind of work from codenacizono, who we know is those biomorphic, you know, fluid entities or things in front of a, kind of a gradient background or pixelated background. So different kind of work. Here. Very interesting.
01:06:38.692 - 01:07:01.356, Speaker A: 420 edition of ten. Congrats to codad to just always keeping it interesting and different here. Very cool. Daniel Todd, a new discovery here. While creating on chain art, I have become obsessed on finding the infinite in the tiny. It's a weird aesthetic challenge as an artist. Again, I'm trying to make two kilobyte files with my little pixel art dante inferno thing.
01:07:01.356 - 01:07:21.564, Speaker A: Let's see how it turns out. But it's a very fun challenge. I liken this to a singularity, everything compressed into a single moment. And I would love to hear how big this is. Like is this like a tiny JavaScript file? It probably is. It's probably like a kilobyte. This is on foundation.
01:07:21.564 - 01:07:53.088, Speaker A: Running along here is again, we don't want to tempt the computer gods here. This is who is this parallel? 369 I think is the artist 369. So a new discovery here. And this is on exchange art and just an interesting animated abstract here, isn't it? So again, some dithering in there. And this is edition of ten and for .03 sols only $4.62. Here's Strano again.
01:07:53.088 - 01:08:20.716, Speaker A: We'll see if we can get this going. Doris Lucy's a light experiment. So interesting work here on the animated abstract front from Strano. Really interesting area. I mean, we see Renki here, Kata. This is an edition of one and not listed. So we just see, you know, again, just very interesting things happening in the animated abstract area.
01:08:20.716 - 01:08:54.000, Speaker A: Here is Lucas Lejeune and Gengoya doing the Gengoya treatment here of the Gengoya character in profile and then getting the Lejeune treatment, I should say very cool work there. Edition of 24 and offers coming in at ten tesos. Very collectible. Here's Roccano. Soda war two. And again, love the soda pop kind of theme. Seems to just say something about consumerism and everything and they just run into each other here, you know, Roccano always having a good sense for, for subject matter.
01:08:54.000 - 01:09:26.828, Speaker A: So do war two. Edition of five. Five tezos and two gone. And here is elie lo, trash artist. Pretty cool. There's the trash. Really cool.
01:09:26.828 - 01:09:42.548, Speaker A: Trash bag season two, episode eight. As I gently move the microphone here to not provoke the computer. 220 and edition of 20. This looks like it is on its way to sell out. Ten half gone. Space hustlers. This is the Kurt hustle collective.
01:09:42.548 - 01:10:21.974, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get this going. Is edition of 25. Xenor kind of has an old Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica sort of feel. I think the end the end is. Is hilarious too here. American hustlers. American hustle games.
01:10:21.974 - 01:10:44.274, Speaker A: Interesting, subtle seeming satire here. And there's the disc at the top right. Hilarious. So very interesting as usual from Kurt Hussle collective. Here is simulacro. See if we can get this one going. Brainstorming too.
01:10:44.274 - 01:11:13.584, Speaker A: Nice music. And we see what looks like the brainstorm here in the middle. So more interesting work from simulacro. That is on object edition of twelve for six tezos and already six collectors there. And here is bosque. Gracias, Las Estrellas. And let's see if this one will play.
01:11:13.584 - 01:11:52.004, Speaker A: If we get through the videos. I think we're going to make it here. If just a beautiful video again, right at home in a contemporary art museum, isn't it? And you gotta love the tv. You gotta love the tv frame there so that we can't play the whole thing. That is seven tezos edition of five just listed by Bosque gratias. And here is a very cool work here by Elbie. This is on Zora.
01:11:52.004 - 01:12:06.334, Speaker A: I left the bigger version here. Look at this again. Kind of painting. We saw this with rustic. We saw this with Kyle Flemmer. Kind of painting with these video game elements. Right? As a brush.
01:12:06.334 - 01:12:25.154, Speaker A: Super interesting and hilarious here too. Now let's look at the actual work. Is it different? I think it is. I miss strangers. This is a free mint on Zora from Elby. So really nice piece. And of course, that face Elbie uses as a profile picture and I think comes from Mario paint.
01:12:25.154 - 01:12:47.624, Speaker A: So pretty cool work there again, taking like a rom or a video game piece, screen record, and then glitching it out a bit. A double glitch. A combination of glitches. Skull takes. Interesting kind of glitch going on here too. A whole bunch of skulls. And that is put on X.
01:12:47.624 - 01:13:10.348, Speaker A: This one hasn't been loading for me, this Klaus work. Give it one more quick shot here. And otherwise we have another one by Klaus coming up and. Yeah, well, not sure. Maybe we can get a small version of 164. Yeah, it had this great triangle. I really wanted to show that, but it wasn't loading up on my computer for some reason.
01:13:10.348 - 01:13:23.914, Speaker A: I don't want to force it. But we have another one. And this one's gorgeous. Composition number 165. And here, another just really cool work by Klaus. Very beautiful one of one. This is 21 tezos.
01:13:23.914 - 01:13:39.958, Speaker A: That is on object. And here, as we go into the AI, here's Santiago. Interesting AI artwork posted by Santiago. Kind of almost looks like a kid's drawing. I had to do a double take that this was AI. It's pretty cool there. Edition of 30 for three tazos.
01:13:39.958 - 01:13:58.456, Speaker A: Selling three. Pretty cool. And here's Skomra. Let's see if this loads up. Interesting piece here. Skamra continuing to experiment here with AI and text and everything. Again, getting novel imagery here a little bit.
01:13:58.456 - 01:14:20.738, Speaker A: Again, kind of has that stable diffusion, textures. Here's no hygiene. Bo 92 2000 by 2000. So another experimental AI artwork here by no hygiene. A wild, wild work made with mid journey. I wonder if these are edited. I mean, that'd be pretty amazing.
01:14:20.738 - 01:14:41.162, Speaker A: I mean, we have to stop for a second and go. If this is just raw AI with no editing, that is pretty amazing. What's going on here? Edition of 111 tazos. Here's Okote with an interesting piece here. Prompt to la quilos. And this is AI. And again you see what looks like a woodcut here.
01:14:41.162 - 01:15:02.410, Speaker A: And a laptop computer in the middle of this discussion of what looks like somewhere in Latin America in the 16th century. But who knows? Cool work from Okote. As usual. That is an edition of one for 20 tazos. Here's another brilliant work here from the Globalsouth series. While you go. We are already back.
01:15:02.410 - 01:15:21.576, Speaker A: And edition of twelve for 250. So another one of these jungle works as we see the parrots in the background with phones and even musical instruments. And interesting. Almost like a jaguar or a leopard mask, I guess we'd say. Plants in the foreground, too. Another beautiful AI painting from Okote. Here's Skye Goodman.
01:15:21.576 - 01:15:50.780, Speaker A: May all your wishes come true. And another, just interesting piece. Looks like a figure here in the middle in this AI VR and blender landscape created in VR and blender. Humanoid figure created with various open source AI tools for Sabato on his birthday. So cool edition of one and transferred. And here's another birthday work for Sabatto. Much love to Kanek Zapata, a glitch artist from back in the day, I think, for this beautiful gift.
01:15:50.780 - 01:16:02.524, Speaker A: And we've seen a ton of great work by Kanik Zapata. I think we actually have one. Canx Zapata. A prompt museum tribute to the echo, the dolphin glitches. Thank you so much. So cool work there. Nice gifts for Sabato.
01:16:02.524 - 01:16:26.774, Speaker A: This is pretty interesting. These works by Mister Bizauld fluidity. There are a few here. And so this is an edition of one and again playing with kind of these outdoor scenes and these paintings, you know, leaking out basically into reality, into the gallery. Here's another one, I thought. Pretty powerful, aren't they? As this kind of waterfall leaks out. You see the sun coming through into the gallery.
01:16:26.774 - 01:16:50.484, Speaker A: Convergence. Here's stillness edition of one. Again we see the lava almost coming out into the gallery here. Interesting work by Mister Eternity as the water leaks into a beautiful gallery here. Beautifully lit gallery. Here is kanik zapata with brillo boxes done in AI style. The brillo boxes.
01:16:50.484 - 01:17:17.036, Speaker A: Very cool work there. Interesting kind of AI writing homage to Warhol, one assumes. And here's triple zero nine, continuing the super interesting, almost photographic series. GM urban artifact 318 24, tender verse. So very interesting series here that zero zero nine is working on, I assume AI. It's getting harder to tell. Tuks GM.
01:17:17.036 - 01:17:33.938, Speaker A: Interesting combination. Interesting structure here, isn't it? Interesting juxtaposition in this, like pink sun in the snow. Beautiful. Here is venta. It's about time I dropped on Zora. Not so simple, a free mint. So venta is on Zora.
01:17:33.938 - 01:17:52.146, Speaker A: Let's see how that one does. Just cool kind of plasticine work. And here's lily illo, again, kind of has a modernist feel to it. These seemingly, maybe an architect or just a portrait of a person. Here. Again, kind of 1920s feeling. This one's slightly different here.
01:17:52.146 - 01:18:12.834, Speaker A: Interesting background, two figures, AI distortion with the eyebrows and more. Here's another one by Lily. Illogical. The grid pulls us in, grounds us, forms clear areas to populate. So kind of the blue, using a blue pen, keep between the lines. All the structures will be held. So playing with the chairs that Lily illo does, but doing kind of a blueprint and ballpoint pen version.
01:18:12.834 - 01:18:36.100, Speaker A: We are still recording. We're in business in another beautiful chair here from Lily Illo. And I love the shadows that don't match up. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant AI artwork here. And here is mo shit. And this is on Zora. Another cool work here using what looks like kind of a textile texture.
01:18:36.100 - 01:19:02.454, Speaker A: And a girl playing video games, but maybe a robot with figures from the video game seeming to come out. And here's walk. Appetite for destruction, of course, a famous record from the. I guess that'd be the late eighties, early nineties. Brilliant interpretation of the COVID here, isn't it? I mean, you see it, but it's just the outline that is retained. And then you just get, again, these beautiful sprays. Here's more from Wach.
01:19:02.454 - 01:19:15.970, Speaker A: Kind of playing with writing here. What does walk say? Words. So an incredibly prolific. Seems to be just making art constantly. Very cool there. Here's NUV 1914. An interesting.
01:19:15.970 - 01:19:34.268, Speaker A: It looks like a physical, very minimal, very interesting. This is an edition of one for ten tezos. I think it's just the NFT. I think this is Santiago. This is posted by Yuri and I think just a. I believe this is a Santiago watercolor. Arlen Maltby for five.
01:19:34.268 - 01:19:49.458, Speaker A: Tez picking that one up. And here is demon ego. A nice drawing here. I think this is from the sketchbook. Kind of looks like demon ego when you look over here. Brilliant drawing from demon ego. Very cool.
01:19:49.458 - 01:20:11.678, Speaker A: I thought this was hilarious because there was an image that was put out of Kate, I think, over the weekend, who was in the hospital, the future queen of England. And of course, it was photoshopped. And there was controversy around that in the british press. I thought this was a hilarious subject. I actually thought about it. I actually have. I may do a different kind of version of this.
01:20:11.678 - 01:20:28.686, Speaker A: I actually took a screenshot. So HB lovebucks, who has the instinct for great imagery, of course, doing the evil Knievel work, zeros in on a portrait of Kate. Very cool. I thought this was interesting. This was posted on Instagram. Nikiguayo. Never heard of the artist before.
01:20:28.686 - 01:21:01.012, Speaker A: But you know what this looks like to me? This looks like digital art that's being put on a canvas. This looks like something that was digital that is being put on a canvas. And I could be wrong about that, but that's kind of what that looks like. I love the way that this doesn't go all the way to the edge too. Again, kind of gives it that irrational poetry. Interestingly, here's another one by Norio Monma. And again, we have a similar thing where just paint put over top and then a little animal outlined over top of a work here.
01:21:01.012 - 01:21:18.954, Speaker A: Acrylic and mixed media. Pretty large work, 2 meters. It's not gallery merloo ball. Another really interesting, kind of fuzzy jpegged out work here. Wild work. Kind of the new humor a little bit. Christian Hellerdy Gallery Rita Mikova.
01:21:18.954 - 01:21:40.634, Speaker A: Really interesting, kind of surreal work here from this gallery I've been following pretty closely.
