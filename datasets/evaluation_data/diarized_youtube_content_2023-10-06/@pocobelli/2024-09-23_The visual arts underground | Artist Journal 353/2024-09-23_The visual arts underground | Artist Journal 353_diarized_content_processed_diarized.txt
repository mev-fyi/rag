00:00:05.760 - 00:00:33.169, Speaker A: Back in the studio, how good it feels. Feels grand. As we continue our chronicle here in real time of the international visual arts underground. My name's Adrian pocabelli. Artist Journal, September 23, 2024, broadcasting from Berlin, Germany. My name's Adrian Pocabelli. I think I just said that.
00:00:33.169 - 00:00:58.061, Speaker A: And that's okay. We're excited, all of us at least. Me here and my fake team behind me here. My invisible friends, shall we say, who continue to help me here. So there's a ton of masterpieces to get through this today. There are a lot of tabs. The computer is performing quite well right now, which is thrilling.
00:00:58.061 - 00:01:22.653, Speaker A: It's thrilling to be back here, actually. I have finally gotten enough of summer, and I'm embracing autumn, what I often call fall. I'm embracing it, and I'm enjoying the cooler temperatures, as a matter of fact. So go figure. Every year is different. And so let's go. There's a ton to get through here, as usual.
00:01:22.653 - 00:02:02.503, Speaker A: So, of course, many of you may recognize this. We have been noticing, many of us, how RJ has kind of made a big splash back on the scene, I'd say in the last three weeks after taking a little bit of a break. Small. And so here. And it seems like he has a new process or at least has incorporated. He already was incorporating AI into the process, but here it seems like he is really, kind of. Put it this way, he's able to produce a lot of work, which looks really impressive.
00:02:02.503 - 00:02:27.899, Speaker A: Works like this work here. And you know what's super interesting that I'm just noticing as I look at it now, it's flashing. And we'll look at the title in a second. But you know what's kind of interesting? And maybe you can see it. It's like RJ is going from the original AI output, perhaps, I don't know. Or at least a rendering of it. And again, it's not super high.
00:02:27.899 - 00:02:48.985, Speaker A: Let me get the cursor here. It's not super high resolution, I suspect on purpose. And hopefully the computer continues to act well. But it's almost like rj. It looks like there's maybe four frames here, if I had to hazard a guess. And again, it's animation. It's movement without animation.
00:02:48.985 - 00:03:21.649, Speaker A: Dynamism, we might just say in its kind of pure form. It's just shimmering, right? It's not trying to make the plant grow or do something, but it's like it adds pixelation or dithering. Right? These kind of, you know, this patterning here, this digital patterning. And it's like. It shows. It looks like there's about four again and four frames, and it just kind of comes into focus, the dithering, and then goes out and then leaves. Interestingly.
00:03:21.649 - 00:03:42.701, Speaker A: Always interesting. On a conceptual level, RJ studied. What did he study? I think. Was it philosophy? I think. Did a PhD. Was it in literature? We had him on the space. I mean, it's almost time to, you know, bring him back on and kind of catch up with rj, should he want to do that.
00:03:42.701 - 00:04:10.495, Speaker A: I will put it on the list here of the many things to do here. But I'll show you what I love about these works. I'm kind of a big fan of this sort of business here where you kind of get the roughness of almost. It's like the equivalent of the paint drops falling on a Basquiat, or you name it. Pick your contemporary artist who uses paint drops. There are several. Many.
00:04:10.495 - 00:04:40.367, Speaker A: And I also like even just this rough cutting here. And it does make you wonder, is this just a raw AI output? There is AI involved? I'm pretty sure. I'd say, like, 99% sure. But it is treated and everything. But, you see, I mean, this is the kind of stuff. Again, it's very painterly, as I like to call it here. This kind of stuff, you see where the pink and the white meet and everything.
00:04:40.367 - 00:05:06.559, Speaker A: I mean, it's just loaded with texture and interesting from a conceptual level. And here you almost see, like, there's a yellow pixelation that kind of comes in and out. Interesting use of the GIF here. And then you zoom out and. Quite a beautiful composition, isn't it? Like. And even again, it's stuff like the yellow here. Was that the machine? Was that rj? I know.
00:05:06.559 - 00:05:44.335, Speaker A: Not. I don't know. But, you know, the plant and everything, like, what a. It's a spectacular composition. I mean, it's a beautiful painting, isn't it? And even the hair. I mean, if you look at, like. I mean, it looks like if you were to try and make this in paint, it has maybe a rose, you know, layer, and then maybe a purple layer on the rose layer, on the pink layer, and then a little bit of green kind of smattered through, Right? What other medium are we getting this kind of effect in? I would say none.
00:05:44.335 - 00:06:09.619, Speaker A: And it's just, you know, as I always say, here we are just scraping the surface of what is possible in the digital realm. Realm. And this is just another example. Like, here's just rj. Okay, let's, you know, getting in the kitchen so to speak, getting in Yuri J's kitchen and starting to make a meal. Right. I love that cooking work by Yuri J.
00:06:09.619 - 00:06:33.326, Speaker A: I don't know if it was on purpose or not, but to me it's such a metaphor for what we're doing. Of course, cooking, I believe is, you know, alchemy is thought to have come out of cooking somewhat, I believe, you know, mixing things together and everything. But right now we're on RJ here. Let's look. So this is actually still available. $69.06. This one of one by RJ.
00:06:33.326 - 00:07:15.185, Speaker A: Mysterious title for me. Yuka Gloriosa, 874 by 874 pixels. And you know what's interesting about this? Again, as you know, it was kind of all. When I was making, say, art on my phone in 2016. It was all about like, I gotta make sure that these are big enough. So I, when I print them, they're gonna be crisp. One of the advantages I would argue of working on the screen as the primary display of your work is you can go low resolution like this, 874 by 874.
00:07:15.185 - 00:07:44.945, Speaker A: And as I was thinking to myself, when I saw that, I thought, it's just right. It's not too big, it's not too small, it's just right. It's like 874 by 874. Of course, a lot of the outputs, you know, if this is mid journey, who knows? I don't know. But I think midjourney was doing a thousand by a thousand if I'm not mistaken. So this is kind of a classic, you know, close to AI rendering, like default size without upscaling. Right.
00:07:44.945 - 00:08:37.975, Speaker A: So, and this is also interesting because of course one of the tricks, so called, or techniques, shall we call it, of AI is upscaling. So all of a sudden you take 800 by 800 work and you can make it into 8,000 by 8,000 and the AI will make it persuasive, right? Like we've basically reached that point. Seems to me, it seems to me, and I kind of like this idea in this case of just kind of keeping it. It seems like RJ is trying to keep the output kind of, you know, be true, so to speak, to that original output. Pure speculation on my part. Final parts on this piece. Look at the, look at the plant again, I suspect is RJ like a genius painter, maybe indirectly, but directly.
00:08:37.975 - 00:09:18.071, Speaker A: This looks like the machine, RJ recognized it and created the technique. However, without question. But I mean, if I saw, put it this way, as a Thought experiment. If you saw this as a physical, if it wasn't moving and you saw that as a physical in a gallery, I mean, and it was just still. But someone had somehow painted this or something, it would be. That would be something to behold. It would look like, who is this unbelievable talent who has showed up here? And so it just kind of adds to this whole conversation of when people are basically criticizing.
00:09:18.071 - 00:09:33.479, Speaker A: And I didn't even have. There are too many tabs here, as you can see. But there is a tab that I got rid of of someone saying like, oh, all AI art is kind of bland. And it's like. What did they say is like dolphins. Maybe a lot of you people. Maybe a lot of you saw.
00:09:33.479 - 00:10:22.685, Speaker A: Saw that tweet it' Dolphins, you know, going over a river or a rainbow. Like these kind of cliche works. You know, again, I'm back to this idea like, of. Was it Samuel Johnson responding. And now I remember the name to George Berkeley, Barclay Berkeley, who was saying everything was made of mind. And Samuel Johnson, if I remember correctly, the great writer, 18th century writer and co writer and co founder, I believe, of the. Is it the Spectator, I can't remember, but of a famous publication in the 18th century, speaking of English literature here, responding to George Berkeley and kicking the rock or the piece of metal or whatever it was on the ground.
00:10:22.685 - 00:10:47.147, Speaker A: And say, I refute it thus. And that's kind of how I feel when I see these AI works. I sort of say, or at least AI incorporated works. When people are saying AI work, art sucks, I say I refute it thus. As we've said in previous episodes. Here's another wild title here, Euphorbria triangularis. I don't even know if these are real words, interestingly.
00:10:47.147 - 00:11:14.661, Speaker A: So this, I think is a static one, interestingly. And you gotta love this kind of overlay here. It could be using AI outputs and then layering on top, different outputs. That's a technique, actually. I like to use a lot different screen renderings here. Kind of done with a. Perhaps with a AI flavor, so to speak.
00:11:14.661 - 00:11:32.225, Speaker A: And then layering over top. Interesting. Nice flat background here, actually contrasting with kind of a bit more depth in the figure here. Also flat background there. Beautiful, beautiful work here. Kind of figurative work, I guess. Edition of 10 for 10 Tezos.
00:11:32.225 - 00:12:02.009, Speaker A: Only one sold to Skomra, interestingly, from the botanical garden. This is also another edition for 100 Tezos. And this one is larger. Quite interestingly, based on our previous discussion, I would say slightly different rendering here as a result as well, because I Guess the pixelation will be smaller. Right? So interesting. 1400 by 1400. So RJ is still kind of working out to a certain degree.
00:12:02.009 - 00:12:20.409, Speaker A: One could argue the process. Or some works are bigger, some works are smaller. But pretty impressive, I would argue. And look at this wonderful almost turquoise frame. And we're going to look at, like, RJ's put out a ton of work. And actually, I should speed up a bit because of how much we actually have to go through here. Zamio Cultus.
00:12:20.409 - 00:12:51.645, Speaker A: Zamio Flo Folia. Sold to Skomra for 100 Tezos. And this one is moving as well in a slightly different way. So it does seem that RJ is doing some experimentation here and maybe using. I mean, if I had to guess, it does look like the stable diffusion. Stable diffusion, I think what Skomra calls textual inverters or the texturing. It kind of looks like stable diffusion texturing, if I had to hazard a guess here.
00:12:51.645 - 00:13:16.095, Speaker A: But look at the face here. It's pretty awesome. I mean, where else are you going to find this? Anywhere in the visual arts, this face. That is why, again, as I open the show, this is the untold story in real time of the visual arts underground here online. So. And there it is again. I refute it thus.
00:13:16.095 - 00:13:30.355, Speaker A: So another interesting one of one. Sold for 100 tazos. Nice. Sale to Skomra. Monstera Deliciosa. This is an edition of 10 for 10 tezos each. So interesting.
00:13:30.355 - 00:13:47.841, Speaker A: This one's smaller. And these very interesting frames. Again, the painterliness, the texture. You gotta love the seat, the edges. Celebrated. Not trying to correct it as you might have tried, like eight years ago. You'd be trying to correct that stuff now.
00:13:47.841 - 00:14:25.261, Speaker A: It's celebrated, you know what I'm saying? So pretty interesting. So here's some of RJ's recent works. We saw some of these along the way. We couldn't look at everything. This beautiful computer, I think we looked at, so putting out a ton of work. And it seems to me, when I look at RJ's huge output, leveraging AI, but doing it in a way to make lots of work, but doing it in a way where the works are still persuasive. Right? I'd say going on the very, you know, just from a personal opinion, going on the edge of too much.
00:14:25.261 - 00:14:44.157, Speaker A: But I would say going up to the line and not crossing it, but going up to the line because. And the. For the sake of illustration here, had RJ put out, you know, 200. To use an extreme example of these works, then you Go. Okay. There's a process at work. You know, basically boom, boom, boom.
00:14:44.157 - 00:15:32.901, Speaker A: If all of a sudden, so going there is a sense, you know, almost to, you know, hearkens back to the AHEC comment of can you put too much work out? You got to manage the market. So managing the market, trying to putting out different series here and now this one. So this brings up a whole other topic that RJ is on top of as well, which is this on chain minting. Let's see if the computer unfreezes here. Let's hope the computer unfreezes because. Okay, I'm going to keep talking here and hope that at some point the computer unfreeze. Okay.
00:15:32.901 - 00:15:51.829, Speaker A: I was getting concerned. It's getting very concerned there. Okay, let's continue. We have a lot of tabs open. I may start shutting them along the way, actually. So rj, very pleased to use NFT protectors. So on chain minting, Tezos, another topic we've discussed here.
00:15:51.829 - 00:16:31.039, Speaker A: Why isn't there a blockchain where you can just put the art where the block size or whatever it is. I'm not a blockchain expert, is big enough where you can just upload the work basically directly on chain? And because usually size is the issue. That's why we have compressionism. Why isn't there a blockchain that's designed for just massive files? I think you can do it. There was a whole debate on bitcoin years ago on should we expand the block size or just keep it as what I think it's 4 megabytes. So interestingly, NFT protector. And we're going to see these tweets later on.
00:16:31.039 - 00:16:52.697, Speaker A: We're going to look at this. It actually looks. I've minted a first on chain Tazos gif. So RJ has actually put out some works here. And we're going to see here it is on and here, no data, interestingly on the author, maybe the first one. Trying out a different wallet. Not sure.
00:16:52.697 - 00:17:12.033, Speaker A: Machine art in the making. But here you see these are on chain. And as you see here, I'll tell you my. I'm kind of back to these superficialities that I have on. Look at how beautiful it's. I look at the frame here and I go, I love this work. And then you see a computer.
00:17:12.033 - 00:17:26.484, Speaker A: Clearly an AI computer. Right. We've seen the. You recognize the keyboards. For anybody that's experimented with AI and tried out, you know, make a computer, this is. Looks like an AI computer to me. And here you see a work on it.
00:17:26.484 - 00:17:53.475, Speaker A: Interestingly, staying true to RJ's whole theme of celebrating the screen. Right. So, as we saw from the very beginning of RJ's work. And if my computer wasn't protesting so much, I would go back right now, but we'll see it in another time. So this is also. And here, another clue here, compressed AI, interestingly, and pixel painting. GIF four frames.
00:17:53.475 - 00:18:17.939, Speaker A: Okay, so sounds like I'm about right there. 178 kilobytes. And here, look at this frame. I love it. I love the painterliness. Again, I'm thinking of artists in the studio in the 1980s doing their work, letting the drips. And in a sense, showing your trailer, right? A very modern idea of showing a trail, so to speak.
00:18:17.939 - 00:19:14.015, Speaker A: It recollects those works that show the trail of the art being made. You see the drips, you see almost like the tape that's been taken off, but celebrating, in a sense, to paraphrase, celebrating the errors, so to speak, embracing the errors. And you could say that with this kind of frame here, as you see, it's only got three sides. And then you look here, and maybe that's. So it's probably the AI. So RJ taking these outputs, seemingly these AI outputs, and then making them more visually interesting, I would argue, as by kind of pixel arting them or, you know, pixelating them, so to speak. Doing that extra layer of work to basically put his stamp and signature on it and really make it his, which, again, helps if you're putting out a lot of work.
00:19:14.015 - 00:19:34.871, Speaker A: Well, at least it shows. Okay, there's some gift going on. And as a collector, you go, okay, that's cool. It works, you know, so just very interesting. The Cutting room edition of one sold for 42 tezos to AHEC at auction. So you see how small this community is. So continues to be interesting.
00:19:34.871 - 00:19:55.155, Speaker A: Here's a couple others. Some static ones. These are not on chain, interestingly, here's another. So a ton of interesting experiments here from RJ. And here are the phones. So 27 new phones, I think these sold, I want to say, for 20 tezos each. Not sure they're all one of ones.
00:19:55.155 - 00:20:36.179, Speaker A: So I thought I'd just bring this up and you can see, I love the roughness and the texture and the painterliness. And just taking all these different phones, applying this process and going, there you go. Kind of Warholian, right? Take your source image, apply the process, and there you go. Here's 20 works today, or 27 or however many it was. So very cool work from rj, as usual, continuing On Little Cakes on this week's spaces has put out a lot of AI Video. Just doing really interesting work. I've been talking for the last few months of bringing Little Cakes on and now it's been a while I think since Little Cakes has done a space.
00:20:36.179 - 00:20:52.623, Speaker A: So bringing Little Cakes on this Wednesday. So that'll be awesome. Out of Japan, I believe. Actually sort out of the US but I think. I think Japanese. I guess we'll find out. So a very fun, cool person, interesting artist.
00:20:52.623 - 00:21:13.675, Speaker A: Here's a sample here that was just put out. Have a sweet Sunday. Very sweet person. So looking forward to talking to Little Cakes on AI AI Video. And what is going down what Little Cakes is finding interesting. What's exciting Little Cakes as far as art and everything. This was kind of hilarious.
00:21:13.675 - 00:21:39.361, Speaker A: So I went to my object page and saw Howdy do had sent me the chair. The chair. The easy chair by Yuri J that so many people want, including myself. And just a very nice gesture from arguably the arch villain of the Tezos ecosystem. There. There he is. A lot of people, you know, have issues with how to do nft.
00:21:39.361 - 00:22:30.167, Speaker A: I mean I was talking and I did invite Howdy do to the spaces and it was after he sent this. But some people were like, well, is this pay to play? But if you go back to the AHEC space with Joshua Sobel maybe 2 or 3 weeks ago actually online while we're having the space, I was I actually discussed bringing on Howdy do just so everybody knows. And while I was talking to Josh, I was like, oh, I think we should actually bring on how to do. And then so just so you know. Anyways, I've always found how he do to echo what I said in that space to Aheck. I always thought Howdy do was actually never took himself too seriously. And I think the thing that Howdy do doesn't like is and I'm just speculating is artists or people, anyone out there who's taking themselves too seriously.
00:22:30.167 - 00:22:52.167, Speaker A: I think that's when how you do starts to become the wrestler, so to speak, the WWF wrestler on the Tazos digital artist sphere. So anyways, hilarious and thank you. How did again, let's see if Howdy do comes on a space. That would be amazing. Rural Idol this was hilarious. Of course I follow Poco. That is a glitch on X.
00:22:52.167 - 00:23:22.391, Speaker A: The reason I I think that's hilarious and I appreciate it and thank you. Rural Idol that's hilarious. I had a good laugh. The reason I always say that is because I'm always concerned there's going to be. And there always are kind of new listeners or viewers coming on the show, seeing the show and then when they see that I'm seemingly not following people or if other people see it, the artists themselves, I always feel like I need to say it because you never know who's kind of new and watching and everything. And it really is a glitch on X. Anyways, that's hilarious.
00:23:22.391 - 00:23:58.625, Speaker A: Thanks for sending it to me as well. Rural, who's also been on the spaces. So thank you and check that one out. I think we have a work here in we do because Rural Idol has actually used the subscription service, which I think it's Saints. We'll see later in the tabs here. Let's look at the comments on last show. Thank you everybody for the support as I was kind of working under difficult conditions there tiny table in some Airbnb and I realized as I told a friend of mine who I was also visiting over in Crete.
00:23:58.625 - 00:24:16.405, Speaker A: Fantastic. Crete for the archeology was the highlight. You'd think it was the beach. The beach was awesome. The archeology Knossos. What was the other one? Malia Palace. I went to those two and then the archaeological museum in Heracleion.
00:24:16.405 - 00:24:38.419, Speaker A: Spectacular. Absolutely spectacular. It's old. 1700 B.C. 1800 B.C. like when you consider Ancient Greece, classical Ancient Greece, I mean we're talking like 500 BC like over a thousand years older than the Parthenon. So that's quite something.
00:24:38.419 - 00:25:27.843, Speaker A: So it's old, you know, some people call it Europe's first civilization. Who knows? I've also seen it explained in a documentary that we shouldn't be thinking of Crete and Minoan civilization, as it's called, as necessarily the south east of Europe, but more the northwest of, you know, what's often called the Middle east and like Egypt and everything that's going on there. So a real kind of bridging thing in old, you know, Ancient Egypt, the first pyramids probably 37, 38, 3900 BC the stuff these palaces are like 1700, 1800. That's old, you know, which turns into 4000 years old. So let's continue here. Edmural comment slash show thank you everybody for commenting. As usual.
00:25:27.843 - 00:25:58.709, Speaker A: I always find it amazing to watch the shows now that we have a Twitter block in Brazil even more. And I'm really glad to hear that, Ed. And it kind of adds another kind of more significance for me personally to what I'm doing here. A true window into the community. Thank you, Adrian. I really feel bad for the People in Brazil who cannot, especially the artists who cannot connect to their, basically to their communities. It must affect sales and everything.
00:25:58.709 - 00:26:23.065, Speaker A: So whatever you can do to help people like Ed and other Brazilian artists, please do it. You really have to. Hopefully that gets resolved at some point. I think there are certain politicians who are trying to impeach the judge, the Supreme Court judge who made the ruling. Let's continue. Takashi, it's always nice to see my friend's art being showcased in your journal. I love your work, Poco.
00:26:23.065 - 00:26:38.271, Speaker A: Thank you, Takashi. And we've looked at some of Takashi's work on the show and we will continue to. Awesome pixel artist out of, I believe, Buenos Aires, or at least Argentina. I met Takashi when I was there. That was awesome. Retro Manny. Great watch as always.
00:26:38.271 - 00:27:00.095, Speaker A: On the compressionism point, I saw a tutorial showed how to turn a high res blender animation into low res pixel art. One of the comments was, but why just learn pixel art? It was tempted to respond by saying, because compressionism. Very funny. Yeah. So I'm not seeing as much on compressionism. Could have been like flash in the pan. But I think from a.
00:27:00.095 - 00:27:55.755, Speaker A: Put it this way, what I think is interesting about this is it was already kind of front and center focus, trying to get work small before the word compressionism ever came into being. We've been talking about it for over a year, I would argue when Spiegels was making these four kilobyte files. And, you know, and it continues, even if the term disappears, it's still kind of front and center for a lot of us as we try and put work on bitcoin just for financial reasons and just limitations of the technology. Maybe on chain minting gives this style a reason beyond just aesthetics. Yeah, in a sense, part of the aesthetic you could argue is the need for low works. And so how do you creatively manage, how do you achieve that? Low work, as we've discussed many times, creates a relationship between the art and the need to preserve it. Not that I'm too precious about it.
00:27:55.755 - 00:28:14.231, Speaker A: Well, exactly. Yeah. Like, I mean, why do you want to put your art on bitcoin, for example? Or why might I want to put my art on bitcoin? It's like. Well, it's kind of like the best bet for lasting a thousand years. You could argue, maybe longer. Static drama. Thank you for the comments and the enthusiasm.
00:28:14.231 - 00:28:32.865, Speaker A: Thank you everybody for the comments. And also on X here, comments. Nice to see my piece sneaking in there at the start. Yeah, that's a beautiful thing. Thank you Libroblock awesome to hear from you. And that is, you know, I'm really glad to have the community in there where basically anybody can be on the show. Right.
00:28:32.865 - 00:28:50.119, Speaker A: So I love it and it's cool work. Like I learn about artists here and I've brought them on the show. People post links as we're going to see here. So thank you for that cool animated abstract. Libro Yan Lucas Magone Superb. Thank you for the positive feedback. Rizzi Great sesh.
00:28:50.119 - 00:29:10.003, Speaker A: Add me in next Poco well feel free to join the community. It is the way to get on this show. Should you have that desire. That is how you do it and then, you know, gets on my radar. The loose rule I need to add it to the rules is try and do it once a week. Right. Because then because people get over enthusiastic and they'll post like every day.
00:29:10.003 - 00:29:27.053, Speaker A: Do it once a week. That's still lots, you know, that'll get Whoever's in that community will see your work. Braindead awesome to hear from you. Thanks for the support. Sabato I never saw this comment. Feels like I found a secret artist journal. Thanks for sharing my pixel arts and I hope you made it to the castle.
00:29:27.053 - 00:29:40.341, Speaker A: I did. To the palace. Indeed. I made it to both. And thank God I did. I'm not sold on the compressionism thing either. It sounds like a marketing buzzword for processes made many digital artists have been using for ages.
00:29:40.341 - 00:30:07.255, Speaker A: Exactly. While it's fun to downgrade my older drawings and engage with the space, I ultimately prefer working with more colors and frames. Compressionism can feel like an austerity fetish, and I'm not convinced that minting art on chain makes it more everlasting. Interesting. Very interesting. For me, it's like a better bet is how I would qualify it, it seems to me. But I think it's very early on.
00:30:07.255 - 00:30:37.197, Speaker A: It's an interesting question. I mean, maybe on chain art minting doesn't make it any more everlasting, isn't it? I would argue it's put it this way. From purely a engineering perspective, I would argue it's one less point of failure. Right? Because you can have IPFS fail and the blockchain not fail. Right. In a sense, the inter and the name. I find, as I've mentioned before here, mildly concerning interplanetary file server.
00:30:37.197 - 00:30:54.363, Speaker A: Does that sound like it's going to be around in even 10 years? Maybe. Probably. I don't know. But it's just one less point of failure that you have to rely on if the blockchain's around, you'll be good if you're minting on chain in theory. So I would say that. And it's like. Yeah, it's.
00:30:54.363 - 00:31:55.595, Speaker A: It's the term itself that is maybe the issue. But I'm still excited, I would say, like, I was just looking at works and doing mixes that are incredibly low resolution and then as a way of making other works from that original kind of work that you might make, as Sabatta was doing with say, the fish there and other works. So I think it depends how you approach it, but I'm still kind of fascinated by this idea of again, being able to put a bunch of versions of work on Bitcoin that hopefully are as persuasive or maybe even some people. I mean, I know like just looking at art or I want to say baseball cards or whatever it is, sometimes the variations are kind of like even more exciting. Right. Again, it's like a Warhol where there's like you have your one screen print to the Maryland and then there's like literally like a thousand different other versions of that, you know, or iterations. So interesting.
00:31:55.595 - 00:32:03.749, Speaker A: Thanks for the comments, Sabato. Awesome to hear from you. Trippy collector. Wow. What a show stopping piece from NUV 1914. Crazy color palette too. Yeah.
00:32:03.749 - 00:32:21.533, Speaker A: This work here, the Picasso homage. And we have another showstopper. As much of a showstopper as that one. This episode. Nuv. It's beautiful to watch what nuv's doing. And again, it just goes to show, you put in, you make like three works a day.
00:32:21.533 - 00:32:31.597, Speaker A: Over and over and over again, maybe more. You really get good. It's almost inevitable. Hasdrubal Waffle. Awesome to hear from you. Thanks. Poko.
00:32:31.597 - 00:32:46.245, Speaker A: We have another work from Hasdrubal this episode and Ilay sent you pancakes. Hidden tab. Awesome. So, you know, I've started to. Yeah, like rodeo. I've started to lose track. What's going on.
00:32:46.245 - 00:32:58.315, Speaker A: I was doing a little bit of collecting because of the waffle works, and all of a sudden I'm just losing the habit. Again. Thank you everybody for sending works and everything. Waffles. Thank you. Aile. Awesome to hear from you.
00:32:58.315 - 00:33:16.705, Speaker A: Quick look at the community here. And if you want to join the community, it's just on my profile on X Louis JPD. Finished prep of new zine featuring my latest artworks. 24 pages, volume 10. Usually I'll select two to be minted. So here. So look at this.
00:33:16.705 - 00:33:30.691, Speaker A: So it's always fascinating to see how people render. Look at how good that looks, how people render. Digital works in Physical. Love the stapler. It's like a zine. Very interesting. I'll select two to be minted on object.com
00:33:30.691 - 00:33:53.305, Speaker A: Very interesting work from Louis JPD looks great. Plague disintegration of the Persona 2024 kind of feels Dall esque, doesn't it? Pretty nice I suspect. AI. Almost AI CGI type work there. Very cool From Plagg. Tim Rinaldi. This is pretty cool too.
00:33:53.305 - 00:34:10.445, Speaker A: Beautiful works here, getting shared on the community. Thrilled about that. Kind of has a printer kind of vibe to it and looks like a CMYK except for yellow or RGB background. Red, green, blue background there. Sports. Interesting title. Love it.
00:34:10.445 - 00:34:40.245, Speaker A: That is Tim Rinaldi. And here's Gregory Nikshumika. Anybody? Still minting on Rodeo? Minimal techno fractal mandala. So my computer is suffering here. So as a result, be sure to put your work itself on the community because sometimes, like today I don't want to as we saw the screen freezing. But look, I don't want to open a new link if I don't have to here. Very cool looking work though from over here.
00:34:40.245 - 00:34:54.545, Speaker A: Thank you Gregory. Nick Schumacher and Zizo. A cool what looks like an AI kind of sci fi work. This is on object.com cool kind of desert sci fi. Very cool. Kind of has a 1950s vibe.
00:34:54.545 - 00:35:20.375, Speaker A: Rosettio, great to hear from you as ever with a work from 2023 and there we see Duchamp in the background there and all the classic palette iconography that you'll find in A Rosatio. And this one, Rural Idol for Norman D. Paint study of Norman Aykroyd Stack and Armin Evening. Love it. I think it's actually in the pixel art section so we'll take a closer look in that. Thank you for sharing that. Rural Idol, very cool work.
00:35:20.375 - 00:35:37.661, Speaker A: And Skull takes interview with Yuri J on one of one. So just loving everything that's being shared here. And this was a really cool show and beautiful artwork. Or sorry, a very cool interview by one of one with Yuri J. Here's Sailor Mokos. Hi amigos. Come check out.
00:35:37.661 - 00:36:00.715, Speaker A: So this is on Zora. I actually have an earlier version of this work with the in Illustrator where you can see like the tracings. We'll see it later here. So here is the finished work posted in the community in Austin. Here are some cool masks. I believe I brought this up in the pixel art section too. So thank you everybody for posting August Ground new work here.
00:36:00.715 - 00:36:18.275, Speaker A: And again feel free to post in the actual in the actual post the image. So I don't need to open it. As you can see here. Having slight computer issues, but looks cool from over here. August Ground and Rural Idol. Yeah. So Tradscape.
00:36:18.275 - 00:36:30.877, Speaker A: We'll look at this in a second. Actually raising money here. And Skull takes physical from Stalamir. Yeah. So interesting take. And as we saw, kind of. Yeah, yeah.
00:36:30.877 - 00:36:44.717, Speaker A: Lenticular prints by Stalamere. So pretty cool. And B, a spam art scene. And there is the spam. And there is this Legio X posting a very. This account. Super cool.
00:36:44.717 - 00:37:06.147, Speaker A: Many of you have seen it blank. You're seeing all sorts of weird. I don't know if it's an AI account or if this is real stuff, but, I mean, look at how cool this looks. This like. It looks like AI to me. But it doesn't have the technical look of AI it looks real. That would be super cool.
00:37:06.147 - 00:37:25.897, Speaker A: A landscape in like a T shirt info tag. T shirt tag. And trippy collector here. Wild news, Runway. Today we are excited to announce that we've entered the first of its kind partnership with Lionsgate. So Runway is the AI video software. So they're partnering with Lionsgate.
00:37:25.897 - 00:37:34.137, Speaker A: Interesting. Which I believe is Hollywood movie studio Toro. My head thunders. Thank you for the drawing. And beautiful. Nice. Kind of.
00:37:34.137 - 00:37:46.161, Speaker A: I love these two color works here. Cool drawing. And Atlas Pop. We'll look at this in a second. Thank you for posting this. I brought it up in the show as well. How come? So, and as you see here, we've been looking at this artist.
00:37:46.161 - 00:37:59.815, Speaker A: They were in the New York Times, hilariously. No, no. Avery's painting of a sandwich sold for $5,000. This person, I think, is actually pretty well known. I only just discovered. And we'll look at this work here, too. Love this work by Katarina Create.
00:37:59.815 - 00:38:16.527, Speaker A: This is also in the show. So we'll take a closer look. And then I think we are back to where we were. Thank you, Louis jpd, for the post. I think we saw that last episode. So this was sent to me. Lily Illo.
00:38:16.527 - 00:38:50.875, Speaker A: So Dean Kissick is a famous, as far as I understand, writer in the contemporary art scene. I completely agree with Sean, AKA Art Manhattan here, that the arts quote, that the arts are currently in a uniquely aimless and uninspired state. End quote. And everyone knows it. And that our problem is one of relevance in particularly art's current inability to generate it. End quote. This is why, again, I call this the visual arts underground, because I don't think people are aware of what's going on here.
00:38:50.875 - 00:39:35.915, Speaker A: The energy is here, I would argue, in what we're kind of seeing in this show and really I've been kind of singing this song here for a couple of years now on this show that the contemporary art scene is kind of run out of ideas, it's run out of energy. It's, you know, as this person as Dean Kissick is recognizing here, you know, and here. Let's just continue. And with Jacko. That contemporary art feels like such a 20th century remnant indeed, doesn't it? And its diminishing resources are put to work defending what the center no longer looks after. So kind of vague there. Most public institutions have given up on art at the same time.
00:39:35.915 - 00:39:50.335, Speaker A: The market is collapsing. Many galleries will close and collectors will swallow huge losses. Contemporary art is over. As you see there. The energy is gone. It has moved elsewhere. Indeed it has.
00:39:50.335 - 00:40:14.481, Speaker A: Indeed it has. And can we bring that back? Let me just see here. Otherwise I have other tabs open with this being discussed here. Okay. And I think is that. Yeah, so the energy has moved elsewhere. This is an interesting thread on millennial contemporary art by Charlotte Fang.
00:40:14.481 - 00:40:32.787, Speaker A: And then here we have Oscar Murillo. Murillo, who was, you know, really pushed for the last at least 10 years in the contemporary art scene. So Charlotte Fang. I mean, just look at this tamales. I almost feel sorry for them. They got chewed up and spit out. Financial machine they emptied themselves into.
00:40:32.787 - 00:40:54.187, Speaker A: Their only legacy is demonstrating the consequences of profaning art communion with the beyond into a shrine to nihil. Nihilistic hedonism. It gets you possessed by. You know. It's actually not a bad description. It gets you possessed by the dullide gunar brains. So lost generation.
00:40:54.187 - 00:41:05.567, Speaker A: So getting very. So I'm pretty sure I have these tabs open. Yeah. So here we are. And it's simple. So this is Charlotte Fang. It's simple.
00:41:05.567 - 00:41:36.567, Speaker A: The zeitgeist seeks a return to meaningful art made by artists with conviction and a light to shine on contemporaneity. Not the empty nihilism of millennial MFAs. Right. And this is one of the huge criticisms I would say I have on just an instinctual level when I go to art fair these days. The last time. It's been a while, I guess I've been to. I was in Greece during the Berlin Art Fair that just happened here last week.
00:41:36.567 - 00:42:23.545, Speaker A: And it was the right decision, by the way. You know, when I go to art fairs now, I feel like when I see the works I'm hearing or sensing the conversation that was had between the student and the art professor at the university. That's what I see. And to me that's not working, if that's what I'm kind of feeling and seeing is like, that looks like something that was done after studying at the right school and being told how to make art. So again, it's very interesting for me personally to be seeing this coming out finally. This could have been said 10 years ago. I was probably, you know, not to toot my own horn here, but I think I've been saying this for a very long time here.
00:42:23.545 - 00:43:09.567, Speaker A: And so I'm actually thrilled that you know what seems like prominent people in the contemporary art scene, writers and whatnot, are recognizing this and or at least admitting it. Finally, this can only exist outside a neoliberal art world which demands savvy financial self platforming. So let's just read this again. The Zeitgeist seeks a return to meaningful art made by artists with conviction. Right? And a light to shine on contemporaneity, not the empty nihilism of millennial mfa. This can only exist today outside a neoliberal art world. Well, welcome to our art world, which is completely international and heavily biased towards what's often called the Global south, which demands savvy financial self platforming.
00:43:09.567 - 00:43:53.715, Speaker A: I mean, is this not what we're doing here? Is that interesting? And here's the Oscar Murillo work, as you see here, that was being looked at to Malley's Oil, oil stick and dirt on canvas estimate 50,000 to 70,000 passed. So not sold, just passed over. Dean Kisick. Finally, we're at this funny inflection point where the millennial painting market appears to be collapsing. Many lots going for under their estimate or unsold or withdrawn completely. While Milady maker is worth $200 million, which is a prominent NFT collection, I think speculators should have just bought loads of weird NFTs. You wouldn't have the storage costs either.
00:43:53.715 - 00:44:43.375, Speaker A: Interestingly so. And finally, on this whole subject, and again, thank you to Lily Illo for highlighting it for me. Matt Dreihurst I encountered something else recently decrying that Post Internet was the last contemporary art movement. And as I was mentioning in Buenos Aires, and maybe I've mentioned on this show before, I've always had an issue with the term post Internet because it's not being used. I think the reason people use it is because they want to put post in front of something. But we don't call postmodernism postmodernism because it. We call it postmodernism because it's after modernism, not after the beginning of Modernism, which I think is how I interpret post Internet as being a term.
00:44:43.375 - 00:45:08.005, Speaker A: In other words, the way I think post Internet is why it's called post Internet, because it doesn't make sense that it's after the Internet. It means after the Internet started is how it's being, I suspect. Otherwise I can't make sense of the term otherwise. It's nonsensical to me personally. So after the Internet started is therefore post Internet. But we don't say after modernism started. That's all postmodern.
00:45:08.005 - 00:45:44.479, Speaker A: When we say postmodern, we mean after modernism, not after modernism started. So the term itself is highly problematic. It's Internet artists. It's not post Internet artists, they are Internet artists. And the reason in my opinion why post was being used was for purely pretentious reasons to basically make it sound more important than it is. There was a time, I'd argue it still kind of exists, but it's really starting to fade. But there was a time 10 to 15 years ago when people wanted to put post in front of stuff just to make it sound important.
00:45:44.479 - 00:46:07.359, Speaker A: And I think that's exactly what happened here. And it was right around that era, 2005. Is that post Internet, you know when that term. So let's continue here. The last contemporary art movement was post Internet. It occurred to me that that was true, but not in the way the statement was intended. It always goes back to Malick's on the necessity of art's exit from contemporary art series as it was clarifying for me at the time.
00:46:07.359 - 00:46:41.649, Speaker A: He was also the first person to curate me in a show. Post Internet was likely the last contemporary art movement, with contemporary art understood by Malick as just another genre or epic of art. Broadly, I actually totally agree with that. Contemporary art, again, it's almost like a misnomer or like a. Because what is contemporary art? It's art of now if you just define it as you take it literally. But really what contemporary art basically is, as far as Matt Dryhurst is saying, it's actually just another movement. And it actually isn't about it being contemporary.
00:46:41.649 - 00:47:26.997, Speaker A: It's about a kind of way of approaching art which was seen as super modern, super forward thinking installations, very difficult, very conceptual. So I think this is a fair assessment. Largely agree with this. Post Internet took the radical stance of taking online work seriously and then was tamed a little as there were few mechanisms to support such work other than selling artifacts. Yeah, so in a sense. But they had the issue of selling screen work is difficult works at selling artifacts of contemporaneity back to an older art world in the forms they understood, sculptures and painting and so on. So again, it was like Internet artists weren't allowed to be Internet artists.
00:47:26.997 - 00:48:02.419, Speaker A: Which was. Which you could argue is the preeminence of the screen being the primary mode of display. More power to those who made often cool work doing that. But it wasn't the true potential of the movement. So it's very interesting. I suspect this is another contemporary art thinker here. Post Internet shows transitioned from alien new ideas online into expedition like museum shows, where artists trained in the tradition ventured out into the Internet to shock an older class of curator and collector by what they found in the wilderness.
00:48:02.419 - 00:49:17.819, Speaker A: Post Internet was a massive opportunity missed by contemporary art infrastructure oxymoronically incapable of embracing the contemporary or just ironically, artists from around that time, many who were involved in Post Internet just simply kept diving online in search of building new habits and institutions. People got interested in crypto and peer to peer and AI which each offer their own conceptual rabbit holes, and found themselves so engaged they never looked back. It's telling when you read accounts decrying the death of contemporary art, how utterly unfamiliar many are with these areas. The myriad crypto experiments to build new economies around art are completely unknown to people. So Matt Dryhurst here actually kind of, I would argue, speaking, I'd say pretty clued in actually, on the reality of the situation. From my perspective, with the exception of trashy headline events that a casual reader of the Guardian might chuckle over. And I think this is actually another astute observation, like so much of what is determined reality in the contemporary art world is like, did some writer at the Guardian talk about it? Isn't that true? AI works are only referenced on the occasion they are exhibited in the same familiar spaces.
00:49:17.819 - 00:50:08.489, Speaker A: Critics might at the same time claim are irrelevant. And we've seen the complete failure, dare I say it, the complete failure of the contemporary art scene to adequately embrace and address, in my opinion, AI art. Like it's completely missed it. There's, you know, there's a little bit of AI art, you know, but it's hardly really a proper engagement. Again, it's kind of like there's just unknown to people. None of this is lost on Dean Dean Kissick, who we were looking at earlier. The challenge now is to synthesize all the work done outside of the institutions with places that may have previously been referred to as contemporary art institutions, but importantly not make concessions or tame those ideas, which was the big mistake last time.
00:50:08.489 - 00:50:44.477, Speaker A: I'm quite optimistic about that. So I don't think they're aware of what's happening over here. And I think the. The key to our success, I would argue, artistically, is what I always come back to, the free market. The beating heart of this scene, I would argue, is there is incentive to make art, but the money, it's free market, but the money hasn't really corrupted it yet. There is some, of course, inevitably, but the really big money hasn't come. You're still able to buy Your Urij for 12 bucks and Yuri's happy.
00:50:44.477 - 00:51:22.085, Speaker A: And if I buy it, I'm happy. Right. So. And it's not costing you a fortune. Should the big money come in, it could change things, which is why it's always like, really enjoy this moment we're in is a final kind of, you know, thought here. So again, this is all based on this Dean Kissick, who was responding to someone else. So very interesting to see these kind of contemporary art thinkers wrestle with the irrelevance, dare I say it, of much contemporary art.
00:51:22.085 - 00:51:40.785, Speaker A: Very interestingly, Alexandra, art trad is struggling. Digital art is used to struggling, but definitely doing better than pre nfts. With new people around, a lot of expectations on how things should be and sourness brewing as our bubble becomes smaller. Worth taking breaks to zoom out for. Reality check. Exactly. It's actually doing very well.
00:51:40.785 - 00:52:10.455, Speaker A: It may be small, but it is, I would say. But it's thriving is actually how I describe it. There's a ton of enthusiasm, There's a ton of great art. You know, I'd say it's doing quite well. Let's see if Dybus Stevens tab here shows up. Maybe I should be closing. Actually, I'm going to just close a few of these tabs here because that may help us.
00:52:10.455 - 00:52:44.505, Speaker A: And actually I'm going to close some of these over here too. Just a few technical issues. It's a massive show today and so there is a lot to work on here to deal with for this computer, which is also recording at the same time. Let's see if we can get Steven Diabas. Let's continue here and we'll try one more time after this. I love the unique sensation that digital art gives me, which is quite interesting comment. Indeed, indeed.
00:52:44.505 - 00:53:12.243, Speaker A: Kind of a simple but I would argue verging on profound observation by Rada here. And I think, well, we know where it is here. It's right after the YouTube link. Let's continue. Uh, oh, okay. So we need to fix this on the fly here. The computer is.
00:53:12.243 - 00:53:24.373, Speaker A: And it was going so well here it is. Here it is. See if we can get that working. Okay. NFT Protector. So this is no hygiene. Okay.
00:53:24.373 - 00:53:46.213, Speaker A: And who got 650,000 views on a work? Astonishingly. So we're going to try and go back to that. But no hygiene. Going a little bit viral there on X. That was amazing. NFT Protector on chain minting on Tezos. Just want to mention that Object Open edition and maybe regular contract supports this already.
00:53:46.213 - 00:54:17.935, Speaker A: The main difference is that due to flexibility, it needs to happen in multiple calls so it can be used for Open Edition. Should we enable on chain minting in our UI now? NFT Protector I believe. Bringing art to everyone with object.com so one of the people behind Object is talking about putting on Chain. You know, it sounds like it can be done. I wonder how much it costs because that's kind of like the final piece of this puzzle. If it's affordable and much more affordable than say Ethereum or Bitcoin.
00:54:17.935 - 00:54:35.819, Speaker A: Again, it gives more reason to. It's like it gives more justification to put on Tezos. Let's continue. Skull takes on chain minting. Theoretically any file size. So only slightly bigger than the limit in one transaction. But it serves an example.
00:54:35.819 - 00:55:02.665, Speaker A: Theoretically any size is possible, only limited by what you can afford. So now it's about how much does this cost? And we actually have the link here. I'm going to open it in a second. This allows minting on chain with files larger than what fits into a single transaction. So here it is on chain. Object minting prototype. So this is what RJ used, I believe to put those two works on Tezos.
00:55:02.665 - 00:55:36.217, Speaker A: So super curious about that. And going back, we got Steven Dybus here. This was great. I'm glad this showed up. After three years of chaos, scams, bored apes, endless beauty, endless generic AI and a new platform every couple of months, I have the feeling the only thing that is about to survive all this is the Tezos art community. It's kind of a funny statement, isn't it? It's quite, you know, it's. It's actually a prescient observation.
00:55:36.217 - 00:55:56.081, Speaker A: I would argue a lot of things like, you know, bored apes kind of came and went to a certain degree. So many things have come and gone. Crypto moves very fast. Tezos art community just keeps chugging along. Including in the Bear. You know, so many of us were there. This show was really started in the Amidst the bear market.
00:55:56.081 - 00:56:07.187, Speaker A: 2022 in, you know, August. Right. We've seen it. Right. So let's continue here and. Okay, awesome. No hygiene shows Up.
00:56:07.187 - 00:56:43.115, Speaker A: Look at that. 652,000 views here for this wild experimental artwork of this. I assume it's AI. This pixelated heart. Is it all raw AI? Last I heard from no hygiene, it was 6000 retweets. Super interesting and kind of fits within that larger discussion of these contemporary art thinkers who are like, you know, there's no energy anymore. There's, you know, and look at the masses are like, hey, look at what no Hygiene is doing.
00:56:43.115 - 00:57:20.423, Speaker A: Very interesting, isn't it? They're not doing that with your typical, you know, contemporary art business, you know, so it's just interesting. This was put on by or tweeted by Jake Studios, who, of course, I follow. That is a glitch on X. Obviously not going to make it, not going to mint it. So Ethereum fees have come back on, and I'm kind of kicking myself for not finishing minting the Peloponnesian War there when the fees were below 1 guai on Ethereum. But I'm sure it'll quiet down hopefully again at some point. But now it's like 20 GW.
00:57:20.423 - 00:57:39.057, Speaker A: It's a completely different story. So there's 60 bucks to mint a work, if I saw that correctly. $63. Outrageous. And here is the Noel Verrier who've been looking at these paintings, I guess, in the New York Times. My oil painting in the New York Times. So very cool.
00:57:39.057 - 00:58:22.225, Speaker A: No painting of a sandwich sold for $5,000. Accused by some of being too commercial. He said he prefers objects connected to who we are today. So remember, we're talking about relevance and just to kind of like, you know, dismantle what we were hearing in the contemporary art discussion. Earlier tabs, they were saying how it's kind of not relevant anymore, weren't they, to the world and here, you know, when this guy makes something relevant who's, you know, really following Baudelaire here, Art of the present connected to who we are today. Kind of reconnecting to a certain degree with the tradition somewhat. One could argue he's being called too commercial.
00:58:22.225 - 00:58:57.905, Speaker A: You know, you're not allowed to make an oil painting, I guess, anymore, of a sandwich without being commercial or whatever. This is so pretty interesting. Rob from Maker's Place now at Maker's Place from Foundation. I'm. I think a lot of us are glad because Rob's a hustler in the sense that he'll send you a lot of links and do all this, but he does really work hard and he kind of seems to deserve. And I think I don't know if he was forced out of foundation or what happened there. But he's basically he was running it and then he wasn't.
00:58:57.905 - 00:59:21.911, Speaker A: I'm proud to announce that I've joined Makerspace as a collector and artist advisor. If you're a collector looking to develop a meaningful relationship with the Makerspace team, DM me and let's schedule a one on one meeting. If you're an artist looking to release a meaningful body of work via Maker's Place, DM me. So that's cool. I'm happy for Rob at Foundation has Dribble Waffle. Interesting piece here. More Donald Ducks.
00:59:21.911 - 01:00:24.023, Speaker A: Interestingly, outsider folk brute visionary art is done by people often marginalized by society and driven by absolute compulsion who do not care about ego, fame or wealth. They aren't terminally online degree holders designing fashionable jpegs for hairy bourgeois baby talkers. So we friend so interesting again, kind of interesting. Within our larger discussion of contemporary art that we're seeing in the mfa, it really has become where rich kids want to make art. They go to mfa, do an MFA at a fancy school and then they have their little art career and it shows, you know, and I'm not saying all those people are not going to be good artists, but to generalize, it really shows that's what it looks like, right? So you know, it's an interesting comment from Waffles Clona Contemporary will be sad to see. Here we are at an hour. There's a lot to catch up on here since last Wednesday.
01:00:24.023 - 01:00:57.365, Speaker A: Will be sad to see Lily Illos, Fumica go. So Adam disbrow, who is 80 A.D. and so who joins Adad A Peter Niche and Warhol in its new home. Look at how stunning this looks. I mean again that violet purple on the wood, again with the reflection, it's just stunning. So congratulations to those guys, Michaela Colonna, Lily Illo and everybody there, Adam Furor. So who posted this? I can't.
01:00:57.365 - 01:01:14.385, Speaker A: Maybe it was Dan Control, I think retweeted this. This was pretty interesting. Always just kind of like seeing plotters. Look at how perfect those circles are. So just kind of interesting what you can do with a plotter. Still need to experiment with that. Finally, Kyle Flemmer, History's Ledger.
01:01:14.385 - 01:01:42.703, Speaker A: So he's calling the Tezos Art Review number seven on collecting. Book of Water by Spiegels Maskinen. So Kyle Flemmer putting out more more reviews on art on the Blockchains. Very cool. That's on Medium and here Rural Idol. I sure hope Rural Idol shows up. Just going to Close a few more tabs here as we fight against.
01:01:42.703 - 01:02:10.005, Speaker A: There were many, many tabs. We haven't even started, as you can see the art yet. Hopefully we don't have any issues there. Let me just close this and thank you for your patience. I hope you're enjoying and having a wonderful fall. As we get things figured out here, let's see if this works. So Rural Idol is doing the Saint subscription.
01:02:10.005 - 01:02:46.471, Speaker A: And also we have here Tradscape's house, which actually we saw earlier in the community now as a result. And we'll go back to those two posts here in a few minutes when they load up. So we saw the post that Tradscape put of his kitchen ceiling collapsing and saying, you know, I'm not to ask for money here, but if you guys have a few bucks, feel free to help. So Yuri J put out an open edition. Only four tazos, 73 minted. Only an hour left. I need to get mine Tazos Artist Kitchen.
01:02:46.471 - 01:03:18.511, Speaker A: Hilarious. And so beautiful work here from Uri J to help out. I believe half of the proceeds go to Tradscape here who makes the music for the music that a lot of people like that start this show. Also the ending music in the show composed and created by Tradscape. So give Tradscape some help there if you can. It might be too late for the mint, but otherwise, do what you can. Here we have Uxene doing a release.
01:03:18.511 - 01:03:33.983, Speaker A: Interesting. Only three works with Fake Whale and Vincent vignette. Viknit. Not sure what that means. Make selection. So it looks like a jukebox, doesn't it? Gorgeously painted here by Uxine. Interesting textures here.
01:03:33.983 - 01:04:02.345, Speaker A: Actually continuing to push here the technical side of things with this grill. Very interesting work here by Uxine. Hilarious jukebox here with these candles here. I believe the name of the show a twisted carnival of sound soundtrack to an existential. Is it Freak Show? We'll see in a second here. Existential Freak Show. Exactly.
01:04:02.345 - 01:04:24.955, Speaker A: So here's the works. Three works released with fake whale by Xine Edition of 11, 5 and 22, all selling out. Now available on secondary. And so here is another work, Cosmic Noise, as you can see here. Basically a rat playing the turntable. Timid. No Shay.
01:04:24.955 - 01:04:46.395, Speaker A: So maybe some more Latin there. And as you can see, just gorgeously painted. Cool colors expanding the palette seemingly a little bit here. Love the cursor here and everything. And just a classic Xing digital painting. And this was spectacular too. Unfiltered Scream into the void edition of 11.
01:04:46.395 - 01:05:13.245, Speaker A: So kind of playing with and look at how awesome that is. Kind of Space Invaders meets Pac Man Ghost. And there's Downward Spiral. I guess that's Nine Inch Nails, hilariously. And here you see what looks like an old ipod variation on one. So very cool work from Uxene. And here is Tradscape, who of course I follow.
01:05:13.245 - 01:05:31.245, Speaker A: I'm asking for help. And so here's the kitchen again. Almost got knocked unconscious while he was doing dishes. So very glad. Thankfully Tradscape is okay. And just check on roll one more week. Only available for subscribers on Saints app.
01:05:31.245 - 01:05:57.615, Speaker A: And so here, unfortunately, this work isn't loading by Rural Idol. We'll see if that reloads. And it doesn't. Okay, I'm gonna have to move on here. We'll try one more time later on. Continuing on from Xine, we have Hasdrubal Waffle when you are a Martian Church. So again, this is on Rodeo, so of course we're just hearing from Waffles there.
01:05:57.615 - 01:06:42.429, Speaker A: And he was posting some very interesting links, by the way, to artists who of the kind that he was describing there. Almost perfectly shaped to our screen here. Very cool work, cool colors. And on Rodeo, here's another one, Glory. And here, quite a large work again, probably using a lot of browser paint programs. And if you're curious which ones, you can always check the space we did with Waffles back in about a year and a half ago, I think. Here's Ed Merola, purchased by ahek for 69 tezos a 1 of 1.
01:06:42.429 - 01:07:02.615, Speaker A: And look at the textures on this thing. So a skeleton basically smoking in the middle of what looks like a forest. Maybe that's fire here. Sampled brushes, all sorts of different techniques here. Gorgeous, gorgeous texture around the skeleton to make that light, beautiful work from Edmirola. There's a little bit of dithering up there. All Good.
01:07:02.615 - 01:07:23.155, Speaker A: Edition of one selling for 69 tezos. Here's another one. The best way to display digital art hilariously. And here's a laptop. So a bit of humor here and all these figures kind of facing each other. Just more beautiful, fun work by Ed Morola out of Brazil. And beautiful frame there too.
01:07:23.155 - 01:07:52.169, Speaker A: And there finally is the Rural Idol work. When you're out of memory, the gifts will loop forever. So Rural Idol doing a lot of birds and mountains. And so this is, if you're a subscriber on Saints app, kind of tempting to use something like this, isn't it? So I'm curious to see how that goes for people. If people are subscribing, I imagine somebody's subscribing let's continue here. This was hilarious. The failed artist number 89, self portrait wanderer above the Sea of Fog.
01:07:52.169 - 01:08:17.209, Speaker A: So here, playing off of Caspar David Friedrich's Del Van Dere, as we like to say here. And interesting. Nice use of texture and paint over top of what looks like almost the original version of this with also the failed artist figure. Real Life. And there's McDonald's in the background. Interesting technique. Like, true.
01:08:17.209 - 01:08:46.697, Speaker A: I think you'd call this pastiche, right? Like, kind of reminiscent where, you know, Banksy would take those kind of paintings you find in antique stores that are barely paintings and painting over top of it. Kind of a similar digital version of that here. The texture really helps create the contrast with the work in the background. Interestingly, edition of 10, five tezos and four sold so far. Very cool. Wasteman Goldmanovich. Here's Cesar Family picture.
01:08:46.697 - 01:09:04.745, Speaker A: Really cool work here. Characters I made from July to September. And of course, characters are kind of a big part of a lot of these digital artists here. They could almost. It's just like the myth, like creating the character. It's almost like you could. These could be cartoons at some point.
01:09:04.745 - 01:09:21.992, Speaker A: You can imagine the myth cartoon maybe here with these other characters. You know, YOLO, supreme, everything. Nice piece. Open edition. Two tazos, only two minted. This was listed on September 22nd. Here's September 18th from Jan Lucas Magone.
01:09:21.992 - 01:09:45.309, Speaker A: Playing with the figures and kind of an interesting piece here. Looks like digital painting. And there we see an orange splash. Beautiful color choice there. And here maybe red would have been too literal. Right? And orange kind of looks pretty cool. And all of these figures almost surrounding this person who seems to have been.
01:09:45.309 - 01:09:57.349, Speaker A: Who seems to be deceased. Error, Balance. Shadows of the Soul collection. Very nice piece from Yanlikes McGon. Here's Rat Cloak with something a little different. Let's see if this opens. Look at this.
01:09:57.349 - 01:10:11.439, Speaker A: Playing with brushes here. It looks like a new brush that Rat Cloak's using. Very cool. Kind of has more of a spray paint kind of feel to it. And you see here, putting it over top there. Very interesting. Just posted to X.
01:10:11.439 - 01:10:23.119, Speaker A: I don't believe minted anywhere. I don't think. Very interesting painting from Ratcloak. I don't think there's a title. Nope. Just. And of course I follow Ratcloak.
01:10:23.119 - 01:10:37.625, Speaker A: Let's continue. Ruse stuck. So interesting artist. I think these are physical, but I'm not. But I think said. But there's definitely a digital component here. This may be a hybrid of digital, of digital and physical.
01:10:37.625 - 01:10:53.861, Speaker A: So interesting Work here from Ruse, who definitely starts physical from my understanding. But as you see here. See digital right there. So edition of 20 for 10 Tezos. Very interesting. Selling already. Yuri J.
01:10:53.861 - 01:11:11.791, Speaker A: Picking up a couple. Very nice. Continue here. Here is Stulka, who is great to see. Great kind of contemporary illustrator and painter. This is on Mallow Art, which I believe is Solana. So new work from Stulka.
01:11:11.791 - 01:11:36.493, Speaker A: Always super interesting artist. Go to her work on Tezos as well if you want to see some fantastic, you know, what I'd call contemporary illustrations. Dreamy Visions is the title reserve of 0.77. Saul picnic. So this is after Obar de Fernando Botero. Look at this work. So another stunner, absolute stunner by Nuf, 1914.
01:11:36.493 - 01:11:58.671, Speaker A: I actually picked this up. I was lucky, I think, to get the second last one. Just gorgeous, gorgeous work and the color and everything. I showed this to a friend who's not in the, you know, digital art scene and he's like, oh, that's impressive. It really is. He's like, I don't normally love the art, but that was pretty awesome. So Yuri J.
01:11:58.671 - 01:12:21.897, Speaker A: Picking up a couple arty hands. My little account there, my little ghost account. A Capirinha di Tarcila do Amarel. So probably another homage here. So not sure. Kind of looks like a Latin American artist, if I had to guess, but not sure. Another beautiful work here by Nev, 1914.
01:12:21.897 - 01:12:47.935, Speaker A: Looks like they are all sold. And now list or one left at five tezos. And here's another Moro de Favola, NUV 1914 after Obra de Tarsilla do Amarel, Eka Pormi and here, maybe a Favola. So very cool work here by Neve, 1914. Just gorgeous. Available for 33 tezos on secondary. And look at this.
01:12:47.935 - 01:13:24.437, Speaker A: Hombre sobre Toro. Gorgeous work by Nav, 1914, picked up by Artie Hands. Three editions just sitting there for a few days. Nobody touched, so I grabbed them all and Nav was kind enough to allow me to burn the extra two to make it a one of one. Yeah, kind of controversial, but if you ask, I think my kind of take on that is if you ask the artist before doing anything, then it's sort of like then you're not destroying digital property. If you ask the artist, then it's like, at least with their blessing and then it's there. I think that's okay because if everybody's agreeing to it, then why not? Is basically my reasoning.
01:13:24.437 - 01:13:51.915, Speaker A: Look at how gorgeous this is. The edginess of this work. I mean, it's spectacular. So Nev 1914, like Yuri J. And many artists in this scene. Completely on fire, you know, which is again, within the context of this earlier discussion of what's happening in contemporary art, I find hilarious and wonderful and exciting, frankly. Here's Dan Control.
01:13:51.915 - 01:14:11.047, Speaker A: What if Solana Drop. Interesting call. Maybe doing some botanical gradient layer work or gradient work. Really cool composition here from Dan Control. Here are some windmills. Very contemporary, right? Beautiful. Fascinating piece here by Dan Control.
01:14:11.047 - 01:14:36.395, Speaker A: Clean. Very cool. Here's Zozo, picked up by Yuri J. Our little bubble here. Let us see if this plays pretty short work. Cool work. Kind of reminds me of Max Ernst garden airplane traps, where the plants are over.
01:14:36.395 - 01:15:00.241, Speaker A: Where the plants are overgrowing the plains or something to that effect or whatever that architectural structure is in the Max Ernst. And look at this background here. The edginess of this work. And again, just part of it. Oh, it is almost all animated. But interestingly, these fills are not. These gray and blue fills are just static.
01:15:00.241 - 01:15:12.107, Speaker A: Beautiful work. Congrats. And I think that sold for 60. 60 tazos. $41. Again, one of one very reasonable cool digital art. Sailor Mocos.
01:15:12.107 - 01:15:27.891, Speaker A: So we saw the finished version. I thought this was quite interesting. We saw the finished version in the community. Quite like it. And has released other works with these Adobe Illustrator like vector lines on it. Very cool. I think when you put the cursor over top, you can take a screenshot.
01:15:27.891 - 01:15:57.027, Speaker A: If I remember right, Sailor Mocha. Cool work. Here is Secret Temple by LXT xcx. And let's see if this plays. So you see a little bit of animation here and there's a little bit of animation there. Cool kind of gradients here, mixing, you know, operating system iconography with what look like kind of columns. Secret Temple where magic hackers go to prey edition of 8 for 33 tezos.
01:15:57.027 - 01:16:20.937, Speaker A: And with fake whale picking up one foregone. Cool work. Very nice piece. Here's Fall Bouquet by Katarina create edition of 10 for 3 tazos. I love the kind of the distortion, so to speak, of the figure with the small head. There's something really great about that. Also the way it's filled in and kind of painted, you know, not perfectly and letting some of the background shine through.
01:16:20.937 - 01:16:38.325, Speaker A: Kind of painterly. Very, very, very nice piece here by Katarina Create three Tezos. Selling two so far. Here's the myth on Surreal App, which I'm not sure which blockchain that's on. I don't know if it's Zora or if it's a Different one. Optimism. I don't know.
01:16:38.325 - 01:17:04.945, Speaker A: But here it is, the Mythinator. So with a drawing here of a myth figure, perhaps on a motorbike. So kind of a different work, more illustrative work from the myth. Here's Santiago with kind of an illustrative minimal work here. Love portrait, of course. I follow Nemarx, AKA Santiago. A beautiful, beautiful, minimal kind of piece here by Santiago.
01:17:04.945 - 01:17:21.645, Speaker A: Here's another one. And what is this? 10 editions for 15 tezos. That's on Taya. Love the negative space here. And of course, these fantastic kind of AI abstract collection collages. And another work by Santiago here, Goblin Call. And this is from September 19th.
01:17:21.645 - 01:17:39.741, Speaker A: So putting out a few different works here. This is more of a pixel art abstract, shall we say. A very interesting piece here and selling quite a few for seven tezos each on primary. And here was an interesting piece. I wonder to myself. This is Dan Cooper. Figs from Plums.
01:17:39.741 - 01:17:57.553, Speaker A: I wonder to myself if this is a plotter, because we do seem to have some texture in here. I'm not sure how this was made. Is it a screen print? I don't know what this is. It's pretty cool, though. Very cool abstract there. Here's Haiti Rockette edition of 3. Putting out a couple of really rad.
01:17:57.553 - 01:18:16.095, Speaker A: Look at how huge this is. Beautiful colors here. Love the huge pixels here. Beautiful abstract from Haiti Rocket. Okay, is everything back? Is okay. So noise, Sully. I got to speed up so that the.
01:18:16.095 - 01:18:46.775, Speaker A: So that the video doesn't crash on me here. If you make it too long, it can crash. Haiti Rockette with a check mark here. Kind of almost iconic for Haiti. Rocket doesn't get enough credit for actually creating this kind of, I would say, terminology or, you know, using the checkmark the way it is. Very creative Internet artist Hitty Rockette edition of 420 and probably limited at this point. Let's continue.
01:18:46.775 - 01:19:13.635, Speaker A: Popple. Let me actually close these kind of technical difficulties, but we're kind of surviving them. Let's let Popple load up. Here's Braun for Clouds in the Sky. So interesting, kind of what I'd loosely call a Warhol structure here. Very interesting work here because usually with Braun you'd have one of these and then it would be more detailed instead. Doing four.
01:19:13.635 - 01:19:33.005, Speaker A: Quite a beautiful work, I would say, for Clouds in the sky. Four clouds in the sky edition of 15. 10 tezos each and one gone so far. Beautiful piece. And here comes Popple. Here is Popple. And not sure if this is a new one.
01:19:33.005 - 01:19:47.945, Speaker A: Let's see if it Plays. You can see Popple in slow motion there to kind of again this monster series. Just gorgeous. So original. Again, the energy of this scene. There's so much creativity. Oh de.
01:19:47.945 - 01:20:12.505, Speaker A: This is Odec scan exploration main. During Busque Grazia's autumn residency I saw this retweeted edition of ten. Interesting abstract here. I would say so More interesting experimentation called Reef3Tazos. This is by KF Kyle Flemmer. Tron Nort typographic visual poem inspired by Tron font. Very cool.
01:20:12.505 - 01:20:32.255, Speaker A: And that is only 0.75 tezos. Here's Strano Chromatic Engine who helped out with RGB MTL. So very cool kind of pixel art work here. Animated abstract. Here's human by definition, who I hadn't heard of before. Someone retweeted this very interesting piece here.
01:20:32.255 - 01:20:52.453, Speaker A: So just cool Internet art, isn't it? Here is, I believe, Kyle Flemmer again, red Rover. So working with the tiling again. You see a slight Ultima 4 vibe to the rocks and the ground. And then you see the rover here. Curiosity. Love the space theme. Very underutilized.
01:20:52.453 - 01:21:01.837, Speaker A: And there is the rover. So doing a homage. It is on chain on Tezos. One of one. At one of one scale. Very cool. Here's another one.
01:21:01.837 - 01:21:23.467, Speaker A: Coat hanger microcosmos number 16 again on chain on Tezos. Very cool pixel art there. And continuing on, figments definitely have to speed up here. Son of Man. So again, another kind of religious. Because we saw the one with the cross put out by I think Kappan. Here's figments under the geyser Captain.
01:21:23.467 - 01:21:42.815, Speaker A: Interesting theme here and just very cool work. Kind of like a video game portal on the bottom left. Love the ground here that's kind of half blotted out. And the little dog there. Broken memory portal. Another one, this kind of animus figure here. The dog a little bit of kind of micro chippery.
01:21:42.815 - 01:21:57.709, Speaker A: And maybe some sort of portal. Broken memory portal. It's like a circuit board meeting. Like a video game portal. Fascinating. And here's, you know, you and me looking on with a little plant beside it with these horizontal leaves. Just gorgeous.
01:21:57.709 - 01:22:19.099, Speaker A: 22 tezos. On secondary here is Oogie Ugo Digi. I love this. This looks like that famous game. What is it called? Whose name escapes me. But we all know this game. It's very famous where they put billions of dollars into it.
01:22:19.099 - 01:22:47.087, Speaker A: Now it'll come to me at some point, not to worry about. But cool screenshot. You see it sometimes, like it's not Gallery has doom perspective. Very cool. Austin Jeremy Austin again, just some very interesting kind of cool freehand pixel art which is quite a powerful technique. Use it myself. Pinky Blue today at Base Paint xyz we're making a canvas theme.
01:22:47.087 - 01:23:10.445, Speaker A: About Me we're making Pinky Blue's artwork among more than 200 artists. It will be available tomorrow. So Pinky Blue doing a work on what I believe is. So this must be so basepaint xyz. I'm not sure if they have a marketplace there too. What does it say? Paint together Mint Daily live on base L2. So maybe it's just a place to basically do Microsoft paint online.
01:23:10.445 - 01:23:26.201, Speaker A: This is a great work. I think. Sabato retweeted out of Santiago done by stypnpixel. Awesome piece. I had to pick it up too. Very cool pixel artwork. Great to see Stypn Pixel back on Tezos Here is brain dead.
01:23:26.201 - 01:23:41.497, Speaker A: Who of course I follow. I'm not dead. This is just how I look. And here we see a broken Mac again. Classic iconography here of the Mac. Here is Mech Txt. I think this is an older work.
01:23:41.497 - 01:23:53.169, Speaker A: Recharging now. Good night. Beautiful though. Just a stunning landscape here. Kind of reminds me of Greece a little bit but more volcanic we might say. Or more kind of higher mountains. But yeah, beautiful work.
01:23:53.169 - 01:24:15.507, Speaker A: Here's Rural Idol. And here this is Antea also object. And here you see a very cool. Love this. I wonder if these are icebergs De paint Study of Norman Ackroyd Stack and Armin Evening. So love the concept here of just taking a famous landscape 18th century landscape work and making a pixel art version. Beautiful.
01:24:15.507 - 01:24:34.183, Speaker A: These beautiful grays. Only two tezos edition of 11. Here is Silva San 2's Try Another channel. Very nice piece here. Of course Silva San 2 is making Nintendo glitch ROMs forever here seemingly. And quite a large rendering here. Very cool.
01:24:34.183 - 01:24:42.943, Speaker A: 888 frames. Amazing edition of two. So open edition. Here's Kiro. Mr. Clipper. Beautiful beautiful textures here by Kuro.
01:24:42.943 - 01:25:05.805, Speaker A: So plain. I think this was Sega actual doing hardware glitch ROMs and then looks like maybe some processing. But I think had mentioned on an earlier episode that it's actually just the pure. It wasn't. I don't think it is actually processed through video processing after I think this is raw so to speak. 0.01 eth.
01:25:05.805 - 01:25:20.705, Speaker A: And that is again Kiro on foundation. Here's another one. Plasma another. So Kiro putting out a lot of work. Cool video painting as I like to call them. Very cool. I was putting out Some of the raw versions or earlier versions.
01:25:20.705 - 01:25:43.037, Speaker A: Here's another one by Kiro. Another beautiful piece. And here we're seeing just some beautiful glitchery and everything that so nice guest landscape by Kiro and all of the everything breaking down there. That is only $0.05 edition of 99 on Tezos. And here is Lena Eckhart. Our love is going to be all right.
01:25:43.037 - 01:25:55.119, Speaker A: Gm so cool. Orc here. So again, animated abstract. It's tempting to think you could see it as a landscape. Hard to say. Interesting lines and textures. Just really beautiful work.
01:25:55.119 - 01:26:17.635, Speaker A: Almost looks like AI in here. But maybe that's actually just. That's probably just a fact. I don't think that is AI but hard to say because you even see some brushwork in there and it's tempting. Tempting, but hard to say what's going on. Interesting piece in Avari with a cool, very textured abstract here. This is posted on X.
01:26:17.635 - 01:26:43.311, Speaker A: Cool piece. And here's Renki who continues to dazzle with just a very interesting just combination of effects and such a defined style. Probably available on Object. Or you could put an offer in Shawn Luke's screen friends. This is quite beautiful and minimal by Sean Luke. I thought an interesting frame there too. Beautiful color.
01:26:43.311 - 01:26:59.335, Speaker A: And here's Nicholas Sassoon. RGB study number one. And so of course commenting on how X reduces the size. So again, just cool animated abstract. I think maybe it's a sun rising. Hard to say. RGB study.
01:26:59.335 - 01:27:14.183, Speaker A: Letting the pixels sing. Maybe this is up close or doing a low resolution version with Nicolas Sassoon. Very, very cool. Should mint that on Bitcoin. Would be amazing. Probably would sell spectacularly. Get rich overnight.
01:27:14.183 - 01:27:31.959, Speaker A: Acid boy, check that out. So new work. Two different kind of elements in conversation with each other here. Interesting color on the dots too with that red and blue. Very cool. Here's Salawaki with some cool GLBs. So three hours of catch and cook videos.
01:27:31.959 - 01:27:52.445, Speaker A: So there is the Salawaki figure, maybe with the hoodie. Looking at their laptop. Edition of 20 looks sold out. And here is the Salwaki figure surfing the mouse. So very cool piece here. And that is 36 Tezos, I think. Sold out, I believe one on secondary.
01:27:52.445 - 01:28:13.995, Speaker A: Let's continue. This is a rad work too. So this account blank posting something by Stephen Allman. Very interesting account that's posting all this stuff. I don't know if it's AI, if it's cgi, if it's collage. Very cool, isn't it Stephen Ullman. Here's Simulacro Optical Phenomenon.
01:28:13.995 - 01:28:42.469, Speaker A: This is on object. So it's 45 seconds, so we can't play everything, but we can do some little highlights here. So all the moodiness and great music of a Simulac. I was happy to meet these guys. Whole team. And there's a figure coming in. Awesome music.
01:28:42.469 - 01:29:00.595, Speaker A: So watch the whole thing on Object. Estelle Flores, who actually has a big show on Object one right now. This is Rad Girl two output from Stable Diffusion. So AI data set, fine tuning prompt. I thought this is pretty rad work here. And there is a figure. I think it's based on the Sims.
01:29:00.595 - 01:29:18.071, Speaker A: Yes, Inside the game. A group of images I made inside the game. The Sims 4. So pretty cool. I think Estelle Flores does a lot of glitch, if I'm not mistaken. But this is her work here, edition of one and that sold for 20 tez. And as we go into more AI here.
01:29:18.071 - 01:29:34.145, Speaker A: Here's Inigo Bilbao. Look at that spectacular work. Let's do a quick open image and new tab. So I don't know if this is the full size, but kind of reminiscent of those Mickeys, isn't it? But different color. Very cool. Very, very cool. Here's Skomra.
01:29:34.145 - 01:29:49.153, Speaker A: Check my pin for auction. So beautiful work by Skomra here. Awesome textures again. Looks like Stable Diffusion. Another one by Skomra. Some more incredibly interesting AI artwork here. Here's Lily Illo with some AI artwork.
01:29:49.153 - 01:30:09.881, Speaker A: Juni. Just beautiful here. Beautiful painting. AI painting. Here's another one by Lily Ilo, kind of more abstract. Here is Toques with another beautiful painterly work here, as you see. Let's see if we can zoom in.
01:30:09.881 - 01:30:22.823, Speaker A: Look at that. So spectacular brushwork we're getting from the AI artists. Look at that. I mean, it's. And we're only like a few years in here. Like what happens in two years? It's gonna be. It's already spectacular.
01:30:22.823 - 01:31:02.799, Speaker A: But maybe, you know, maybe it's like Lily Illo, the earlier versions of, you know, Stable Diffusion and Dall E, sometimes are the ones that have all the magic. So depending on the artist, of course. Look at this. All this great painterliness, that beautiful sea. Spectacular work here from Toques, as usual. Here is Quilanina Hen Memories and a beautiful AI artwork by Quila Nina over out of Buenos Aires, or actually, I think Argentina and Peru, if I'm not mistaken. Interviewed her on the special neutral show we did in Buenos Aires.
01:31:02.799 - 01:31:22.845, Speaker A: Bazaya, of course. I follow Dave 30th of Ricardus. So I think these are AI if I'm not mistaken. I'm not positive on that though. But I think kind of, I think making works from previous works. Here's another one. Because when you look up close here we have the myth.
01:31:22.845 - 01:31:48.581, Speaker A: It looks like AI to me, but it might not be, but I'm pretty sure it is. If anybody knows, feel free to drop a line. So interesting work here. The man, the myth Ricardus. So just really cool work here by Buzziah. Great to see Buzziah at work. And here's Nohyjin who, another artist who's really hitting it out of the park.
01:31:48.581 - 01:32:12.101, Speaker A: Going through the wilderness, really going completely in their own direction. Me is the name of the work. And I mean, the details in here are pretty wild. I don't know if this is pure raw AI. I mean, that would be unbelievable. And we have again, this kind of angel figure, wild work selling for 35 tezos on object. Here's another, I think AI artwork.
01:32:12.101 - 01:32:30.047, Speaker A: This by Plague. We saw this earlier disintegration of the Persona. Again, kind of looks like Dall? E cgi. Cool work by Plague. Here is Demon Ego. As we go into the physicals, you know, and very nice to see. You could almost know sign this thing.
01:32:30.047 - 01:32:46.407, Speaker A: All it needs is a little signature there and you could almost finish that, leave it unfinished. This is fantastic. New artist I discovered. Famo is dead. Look at this Donald Duck here. Do you think of me like I think of you? Wild, wild piece here. Beautifully done.
01:32:46.407 - 01:33:05.895, Speaker A: Really interesting artist. Famo. Here's Donnie O'Donnell. So we've seen this artist a ton of times. If you watch this show for a long time now, putting their art on the walls and making it into murals. Very impressive looking, isn't it? Super impressive. Gotta love that.
01:33:05.895 - 01:33:18.115, Speaker A: Very cool. Here's Machine who's killing It. Look at that. 6,600 likes. You can see where the energy is, you know. And here's Michael Jackson. I don't even know the reference.
01:33:18.115 - 01:33:36.565, Speaker A: I know that was going around. But yeah, just really interesting art here. I guess it's based on that animal there. And somehow Michael Jackson being a part of it. I have no idea what's going on there, but it's cool. David Hales, artist I've been following for a long time. Still needs a title.
01:33:36.565 - 01:33:52.941, Speaker A: Watercolor and ink. Doing really well here. Beautiful, beautiful work. And here's Moto Moto Hero, where the tiger is being fused with a motorcycle. Again, tons of energy, lots of humor. Here's Pippa Universal doing a Birth of Venus. I thought this was quite beautiful.
01:33:52.941 - 01:34:16.485, Speaker A: Kind of feels like an art brute. Sort of feel. Argentina es al faro del mundo. And here's Kayla Matis again, more exciting artwork. This piece is in a big group show, Amor Tuyo, created by Ozzie Juarez and Tilak Studios, opening tonight. Another just awesome work here from Kayla Matis. Just a super fun artist.
01:34:16.485 - 01:34:30.825, Speaker A: I guess that's the show group exhibition textile work. And that, my friends, is your show, hour 34. Thank you for joining me. We're going to have a space on Wednesday with little cakes. I'll also have a show, hopefully a lot shorter. Until next time. Take care.
