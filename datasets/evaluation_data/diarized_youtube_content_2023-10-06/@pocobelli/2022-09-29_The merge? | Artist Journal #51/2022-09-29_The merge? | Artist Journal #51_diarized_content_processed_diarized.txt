00:00:08.760 - 00:00:42.278, Speaker A: People make fun of my music. A couple of friends have commented on the music Artist journal, September 29, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, artist, reporter, and you long time watchers will know what that means. Welcome back. There is a ton to get through. Interesting developments, let me tell you. So before we open with this, let me just give a quick shout out to Arthropo.
00:00:42.278 - 00:00:57.546, Speaker A: Yesterday's Twitter spaces was awesome. I was totally impressed with the team there. They seem serious. Okay. And so they have a drop that they just did yesterday. 0.5 ETH for four works, which you can see here, and you also get a bonus work.
00:00:57.546 - 00:01:36.116, Speaker A: Okay. What was cool about the spaces is it was full of artists and a few collectors. Almost all artists, though. And I thought to myself, first of all, if you go to their website and you listen to them, and the Twitter spaces was a lot of fun, you just see the care that is being put into this. And this is the time to build, because if you're in some bull market, first of all, most of the artists are going to be too busy because they're making too much bank in a bull market. And everybody's going to think you're kind of there for the cash. But if you build in a bear market, well, you can kind of establish your credibility.
00:01:36.116 - 00:01:52.060, Speaker A: It's quiet. Artists have the time. Everybody has more time. And, I mean, this could last for years. It's very possible. And that's okay, because by the time this turns around, or, I mean, this could blow up in two months for all we know. Okay.
00:01:52.060 - 00:02:19.036, Speaker A: Like, Robnis put out a tweet a couple of weeks ago, or maybe more like a month ago, saying, you know, tezos is gonna. It's only gonna take a couple of whales to spend like crazy, and that whole thing is gonna explode. Okay. And I think he's right. I mean, that could take a while, though, or it could be tomorrow for all we know. So anyways, welcome back. Check out Arthropoh.
00:02:19.036 - 00:02:46.328, Speaker A: There's also just some interesting developments here. And then we'll get back to that really cool pepe work that I opened with. Bazaya, who I like to call three a five a one a has just sent his application to super rare and won every one of the pieces of the pieces. Weird GM and wanted to show everybody one of the pieces. Here's weird GM, la mafia del flo into house. Wish me luck. And I appreciate the likes and retweets, so give Bezaya some support.
00:02:46.328 - 00:02:58.712, Speaker A: He's doing very well. 59 retweets and 129 likes. So he's got a very strong community. And look at this man. I didn't even see that in the background. That is hilarious. And there's.
00:02:58.712 - 00:03:09.400, Speaker A: I didn't even see either of these guys. Nice details. So it's funny. You can look at a work and totally miss it. So very cool work by Beziah. So. But I did want to.
00:03:09.400 - 00:03:42.548, Speaker A: This is almost like we're seeing more of what I'm calling emerge. The real merge, or at least the art merge. We saw rat cloak, see on foundation. We saw arthropo is on Ethereum. And we also saw the myth suggest intimations that perhaps there would be a drop on Ethereum as well. So we're starting to see more movement. And then I saw this Haiti rocket at super rare.
00:03:42.548 - 00:04:13.362, Speaker A: Question mark f. Yeah, 60%. Lol. 39 I guess 40%. So, you know, you're starting to see what I'm calling a bit of a merge of both blockchains here. So who knows? I mean, some people argue in a multi chain future, none of that's going to matter, you know, and it's an interesting question. So who knows? But just interesting to watch it happen again.
00:04:13.362 - 00:04:42.164, Speaker A: I'm on both, and I like it that way. I mean, I guess my final thought on this is, as an artist, I love Ethereum because I sell for, you know, like, say I sold that work for almost nothing to the museum of crypto Art yesterday. It was like dollar 250 on Ethereum, which is 0.2. So pretty low. But on tezos, you know, 150 tezos is a big deal. I mean, gloom tube, as we'll see, sells his one of ones for 300. So as an artist, I love ethereum.
00:04:42.164 - 00:05:08.628, Speaker A: As a collector, I love tezos, right? And we're seeing a lot of artist collectors because we all love images. And on tezos you can collect cheap. And I love that middle class being able to buy and create an art collection. And I suspect it won't last forever. But who knows? Again, there's a lot of unknowns here. So anyway, let's get to the work. Very cool.
00:05:08.628 - 00:05:42.614, Speaker A: Hilarious. Pepe was dropped by this guy, this person called 0010. Again, just a great work here. They're on super rare, and we have just a couple of ETH artists I want to touch, people I found on Twitter, really almost digital Twitter artists. But I did just want to kind of look and just, you can see this kind of designy work. I feel like there's a guy that we saw go go Litus actually collaborated with him. Let me just bring up very quickly what this reminds me of.
00:05:42.614 - 00:06:14.582, Speaker A: Gogolitis did a collaboration with an artist who. This reminds me of this one, Gora. Kind of reminds me of gora a little bit. Kind of in that same kind of style. A little bit. I mean, it's a bit of a stretch, so let's not go too far with that. But you see Gora here, so, I mean, in the same province, you could put them in the same show, in the same room.
00:06:14.582 - 00:06:38.534, Speaker A: Let's put it that way. We're also curators here, so just an interesting artist. 0010 again, that Pepe was a headturner, which is why I want to open with it. This was another head turner. This guy is on foundation. Sluge, sludge, maybe? Check this out again. Kind of fits our world right now.
00:06:38.534 - 00:07:24.428, Speaker A: Kind of has a geopolitical feel to it. So I have a few works by sluge or sludge. It's probably sludge. I'm terrible at pronouncing people's names here, as Beziah knows. Another one kind of has a surveillance tip to it, almost like drones, you know, almost like quasi military. Again, almost a geopolitical feel to it. Interesting.
00:07:24.428 - 00:08:05.990, Speaker A: I mean, this almost looks like an oil thing or some sort of power, you know, electricity structure. Who is scanning this? Right? Just make sure the volume is loud enough here. The audio is awesome on these. Very ominous. And speaking of the merge, it kind of makes you, you know, feel like this is something I'd see in a contemporary art gallery. It's got that kind of ominousness, right, this disconcerting feeling. So interesting.
00:08:05.990 - 00:08:35.458, Speaker A: And I think we have one more or a couple more. This one's pretty short, so that one's really short. And one more. I just thought they were, like, very provocative works here. Here's the last one. So just really good audio. Let's.
00:08:35.458 - 00:09:05.264, Speaker A: Let's stop that now. So on foundation, and then we will get to our regular featured programming. Not terrible prices. Last sold for three ETH for Ethereum. That's, you know, it's pretty low, right? So, yeah, so just interesting artist. Okay. A bit of a PSA, bit of a public service announcement here.
00:09:05.264 - 00:09:38.110, Speaker A: Sky Goodman. I forgot to renew Skygoodman Tez, and now I have to bid against someone in an auction for it. So keep tabs on when your tez expires, because there are weirdos out there who are looking to. Who are looking to basically scalp or to, you know, buy your tez from before you renew it. So just renew it before they get. Don't give them that opportunity. I think mine's up in December, so I need to stay on top of that.
00:09:38.110 - 00:09:56.038, Speaker A: Maybe I'll do that right now or today. But don't forget about that. Uczene or Ukzene? I've been seeing his work on the periphery for a couple of weeks now. He's been around for a few months. He's got quite a bit of work, actually. But awesome work. Again.
00:09:56.038 - 00:10:29.192, Speaker A: It's just kind of always been on the periphery. And then finally I just saw it again and I was like, how have I not profiled this yet? It looks like a pretty clear criticism, I guess, of the digital world. This kind of almost medieval, I'd say. This is actually more renaissance, even later. 16th century figure here with a skull and very digital pixelated cursor. So great contrast. Awesome colors.
00:10:29.192 - 00:10:48.288, Speaker A: Worship. Okay, uczine. So beautiful work. How much did these go for? Just transferred, not for sale. And then 660 burned. So interesting. 666, beautiful fountain, buy for 33 again, let's just quickly look at the market here.
00:10:48.288 - 00:11:05.942, Speaker A: Sold to Bridget or Bridget to lvls. I think I just bought something from Bridget yesterday in New York City. Okay. For 15. Okay, let's look at this. Awesome work. Maybe procreate, I'm guessing, is what was.
00:11:05.942 - 00:11:29.614, Speaker A: So Duchamp's fountain right side up in procreate, I assume. Who knows? Purple and that kind of. That kind of brushwork contrasting with the green. Again, awesome palette here. So just a beautiful work. A little bit of commentary here. Digital fountain based on sculpture by Duchamp.
00:11:29.614 - 00:11:46.042, Speaker A: Another work, private key of Satoshi, based on St. Francis in meditation. Francisco de Zurbarane. Zurbaran. Very, very nice work here. Uczine. One of one.
00:11:46.042 - 00:12:04.904, Speaker A: Did this sell? Yes, for 345. So he has his collectors, he or she. Another beautiful work. Edition of eleven for 34. Really, just really nice work. Just kind of fun, exciting. Kind of goes with our previous.
00:12:04.904 - 00:12:15.964, Speaker A: Kind of goes with sludge's work. Pretty well. Kind of ominous. Web zero blackmail. And you can see pretty healthy market too. Not too much. That's cheap.
00:12:15.964 - 00:12:36.330, Speaker A: This 50 edition of 50, you can get something for ten. This is older. I'll just bring up a newer page. Interesting. What looks like kind of an x copy derivative is actually the cheapest here at ten. Yeah. So again, that work worship is very nice.
00:12:36.330 - 00:13:10.118, Speaker A: So just an interesting artist to keep tabs on. I wanted to just touch on Ultra 4200 or 400, whatever this is. 40,200 home invasion dedicated to the vanguard. So out of this vanguard group here, black edition. Cover your eyes if you're sensitive to flashing lights, because we have another work here. So what I wanted to highlight on this, and I'll stop this right away because it's kind of a lot. Okay.
00:13:10.118 - 00:13:44.586, Speaker A: So what I wanted to highlight here is how this person, Ultra 40, they put out this work here, and then they did a black and a white version. So there's a dynamic mix, and they put out one version of the dark and one version of the light. And I just thought that was really interesting. So, yeah, I just wanted to point that out in kind of a cool work, right? Just an interesting composition. The black is actually the most expensive right now. Interestingly. Moving on, moving on quickly, new work by dextere.
00:13:44.586 - 00:14:09.862, Speaker A: September 28 edition of ten. Rebecca enjoying summer. And there is just something about Dextere's work. And again, that contrast between the static, this person that's not moving here, and the water and the birds, and then again, a static sky. Interesting contrast. So nice work by Dextere. A couple of works.
00:14:09.862 - 00:14:28.794, Speaker A: I don't know if this is a work in progress. This was never minted by Matthias La Plata, as far as I know. Maybe there's an older work, but just what looks like. I don't know if it's a work in progress or what. Maybe a preview or maybe of an older work. I'm not sure. When I die, remember me as a good person.
00:14:28.794 - 00:14:45.884, Speaker A: So Matthias is always very intense. He's a younger guy. He's like maybe 21 or 22. Almost reminds me of that Goethe work, the sorrows of young werther. Very intense, shall we say. So great artist. Always enjoy following his work.
00:14:45.884 - 00:15:15.726, Speaker A: And Morlakos put out this very interesting work in progress. It appears kind of again on that kind of a medieval tip. So I don't know if this is going to be. It almost looks like maybe it'll be a bitcoin, one of those Pepe works, who knows? But always just fun to watch. More Lacko's work. Another artist that's kind of been on the periphery a little bit. I just discovered yesterday or the day before.
00:15:15.726 - 00:15:38.326, Speaker A: Sad music for kids. Again, another Twitter discovery. It kind of has a bit of a japanese woodcut feel to it, especially with this fish here. Strange work. At the end of the day, I'm not exactly sure what's going on here, but it's beautiful. I picked it up, edition of 30. So kind of a high edition, but a strong market.
00:15:38.326 - 00:15:54.430, Speaker A: Sold. Let's see how quickly it sold. Listed at 03:09 a.m. Berlin time. And sold basically less than, I guess, almost 24 hours later, sold out. It's a pretty healthy for addition of 30 at three tezos each. So sad.
00:15:54.430 - 00:16:24.122, Speaker A: Music for kids. And I wonder if it's a bit of a breakthrough work. Again, a lot of the work is kind of illustration and almost a little bit on that japanese woodcut kind of vibe. It looks like a bit of a breakthrough work, I'm tempted to say, but you can check it out for yourself. Jakarta base designer. Just another interesting Hughes of chiji. Another kind of Twitter discovery here.
00:16:24.122 - 00:16:46.494, Speaker A: Just an interesting, nice GM. Some props to the web3 community roadmap. We're all going to make it chill. LFG and on and on. I just kind of like this piece. He uses gigi and is the name of the creator GG and Gmers. A work that personifies the facets of web3 in the culture of GM.
00:16:46.494 - 00:17:04.884, Speaker A: So GM to Hughes of GG. And you can see so not much work released here. A few portraits. I really like that GM. A couple of more cubes here from the side hustle. So here's a black and white one. Interesting kind of movement behind kind of static movement.
00:17:04.884 - 00:17:42.123, Speaker A: Remember that artist Kappen who had the dynamic movement behind static pixels? We kind of see that here with side hustle. Let's just see if we can find Kappn. Yeah, here we go. Kind of a similar process, you could say here, this was a great work. Again, see static pixels with dynamic pixels or pixels in movement in the background. Just kind of a similar idea. Very powerful.
00:17:42.123 - 00:18:21.346, Speaker A: I think it's a very powerful kind of process here. You don't get that I picked this one up just because I just love the color. So this is a purple version, but a similar process in that previous one where we saw the pixels behind the bricks here, moving like in Kappen's work. Here's the one of one by Gloomtube. This went for 300 to greatest Tanuki, whose name I've seen a few times here. Kind of a divergence here in a couple of ways from Gloom tube's other work. Normally we'd probably see just like a sad face or like just a black mark, but here you see the teeth.
00:18:21.346 - 00:19:00.390, Speaker A: So kind of interesting. Not sure what's going on there. And then the shiny eyes and then miracle water. I think that's what this is called, miracle water. So again, a criticism of kind of these suburban, of suburbia and criticism of basically the spirituality really of suburbia, as JG Ballard called it, who I like to quote here, the suburbanization of the soul. And Gloomtube is a master of that I think we could call die with the most likes. Another master, I was looking at greatest Tanuki's work.
00:19:00.390 - 00:19:22.308, Speaker A: So interesting just to see what else he was collecting here. He got this Ralph Stedman, which we are going to cover here. So just interesting to see what other people are picking up. This almost looks like an AI work here, but a couple of Kappa works. And let's continue on here. Let's continue on. So Joe Rogan put out a fashion AI.
00:19:22.308 - 00:19:46.888, Speaker A: AI. Fashion Versace subs. Make an offer. And so interesting. Let's just go to the page. So again, we're back to this will AI blow up fashion? And I'm thinking it will if it hasn't already. And wouldn't it be fascinating if it came out of the blockchain here? Surely this is starting to turn people's heads in the fashion industry.
00:19:46.888 - 00:20:06.644, Speaker A: I mean, are they using it already? It's interesting. I feel like I'm seeing it here before the catwalks, but I don't read Vogue every month, so I don't visit the website. Maybe I should. Maybe I should just put in. Maybe we should all put an AI fashion into Google news and see what comes up. So he has a couple of offers here. One for 20.
00:20:06.644 - 00:20:30.936, Speaker A: And moving on, here is another piece. Again, you see this design here? AI assisted digital painting mid journey and procreate on iPad. So another work by Joe Rogan's dad. So again, exploring this AI fashion. Balenciaga. Balenciaga, the gallery collection. Buy for 16.
00:20:30.936 - 00:20:52.608, Speaker A: It's an edition of twelve. And yeah, selling well. Okay, so these originally sold. He was accepting offers. Remember that? Because probably issues with flippers. Continuing on, another new AI work by Sumi Ray. And I just like the lighting in this painting.
00:20:52.608 - 00:21:08.656, Speaker A: Edition of 20. So AI assisted Dali and lightroom. Another one of the studio. Room 17. I'll show you the one that really caught my eye. There was another one that she put out. This is a one of one doesn't look like it's for sale.
00:21:08.656 - 00:21:35.774, Speaker A: I like this one a lot because it looks like there's a computer here. And that is the modern studio, isn't it? The computer in the studio? And so that was like, just to me, that made this extra exciting. Let's put it that way, because that is the modern studio. It looks like kind of a retro computer, if that's what it is. Maybe it's just the back of a painting or something. Maybe I'm missing it. Wouldn't be the first time.
00:21:35.774 - 00:22:02.650, Speaker A: But a computer there. I'm sure you can see that now, too. That's exciting. And here, Ralph Stedman is back with another physical work on the blockchain here. Again, I guess a scan or edition of 150 sold out. What was the mint price here? Let's just see. Ten.
00:22:02.650 - 00:22:44.218, Speaker A: So a cool 1500 tezos for Ralph Stedman for this 1991 work. So you see, like, I'm, as you know, if you've watched this program, I'm a little skeptical of the physical works on the blockchain, but Ralph Steadman is selling very well, so we can see a very healthy market. I may be wrong over the long term, and we've already had that debate, so we don't need to go back into it. I mean, we'll return to it here and there. And that's also why I like to follow it, because maybe I'm wrong. Right? So, 1991 acrylic and ink on paper. Looks like a scan based on the resolution here.
00:22:44.218 - 00:23:03.754, Speaker A: High res scan. I'm here a creature. So just a very cool work by Ralph Stedman. I picked up this eight Bidoo works. I don't buy many eight BDU works, but this one, I just really, really like just a three and a half inch disk. I thought it was just so minimal and clean. Higher densities.
00:23:03.754 - 00:23:18.234, Speaker A: I had that on my radar since I was on ape bedou. I don't know if it was four months ago, whenever that was studio Yorktown. You can still buy it, I think, for four. So that's kind of cool. Yeah. Still available. I bought it for four, but I thought it was a classic.
00:23:18.234 - 00:23:38.338, Speaker A: Now, quick correction. Someone sent me a message for this myth work. Myth hug. Actually, it was sent to the eight bidoo wallet. I think I brought it up here. Yeah. So remember, I was like, who has collected 515 eight bidoo pages of eight bidoo works? Well, it's eight Baidu.
00:23:38.338 - 00:24:11.940, Speaker A: When you go to sell a work on eight bidoo, it sends it to their wallet, you know, just like it does on hen or wherever else. And so this is still available, this beautiful myth work for 51 of my favorites. Let me just fix this. So quick little correction there. And finally, I minted this work from the beach of a beach. Help me out here. I kind of struggled with this one pixel down here and whether to remove it or not.
00:24:11.940 - 00:24:39.084, Speaker A: I'm going to show it to you in Photoshop, what it looks like without the pixel. And I literally spent, like, a good deal of my afternoon yesterday trying to figure out which one. And I'll tell you the debate in my mind in a. The one that's on object.com, which I got rid of the listing. None have sold so I can still burn this thing so feel free to leave your opinion. A or b? I like a because it has this balance to it.
00:24:39.084 - 00:25:12.576, Speaker A: I like b because this looks a little bit more like a beach. This is a bit of an irrational pixel here and this just kind of works and I just accept it right away and I like that. Although I don't mind an irrational pixel. The problem with this one though is the sun and the clouds start to kind of pull this whole work up and it starts to feel a little unbalanced as a whole. Tell me if you agree with that. Like tell me what you like. I'm just curious for feedback because I was I've spent too much time debating between a and b.
00:25:12.576 - 00:25:24.904, Speaker A: If it's obvious to you, please drop an a or a b in the comments if you like. So with that, thank you for joining me today. Until next time, take care.
