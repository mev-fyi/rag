00:00:04.280 - 00:00:17.410, Speaker A: New words. A new week. A new beginning. A new Monday. A new Monday. Artist journal, July 22, 2024. Broadcasting from Berlin, Germany, my name is Adrian Pokebelly.
00:00:17.410 - 00:00:48.804, Speaker A: Sailing full steam ahead under cloudy skies here. Finally give. Give the uv light a break. Give our bodies a break from all the uv light that so many of us are taking in. Glad shout out to mom. Thanks for buying me a hat back when I visited in, in June to Canada that I have put that hat to good use. So big shout out to mom.
00:00:48.804 - 00:01:35.036, Speaker A: So let's go. As I continued to try and keep these shows, I figured, like, I been talking to people, it's like, I wonder, I wonder if the show is being held back to a certain degree by them being so long. Like, I think we have to, you know, sometimes you have to take the view of the viewer rather than the person putting the show together. And it's like, what's the ideal time here? 30 minutes I'd say is the ideal time, but I think it's just not possible to kind of get everything that we like to cover here in 30 minutes. But I think 40 to 45 minutes is an ideal worth striving for because then you don't open it up on your YouTube or whatever and see an hour and a half and go skip. Right. So I think it's worth trying for.
00:01:35.036 - 00:02:01.130, Speaker A: Let's see what we can do today. So here's Rosatio, an artist I've been covering here on this program from probably episode, I'd guess, 60 or so very early on. Good memories we have together. Rosatio on this show has left many comments over the years. Yeah. So just awesome to see Rosaceo back taking a little break. Right? Like this one came out recently.
00:02:01.130 - 00:02:43.464, Speaker A: And you know what's interesting, again, stuff that kind of, you know, quote unquote, everybody's an artist as far as I'm concerned, or can be an artist. But for people that don't make art, this is kind of like, you know, here's a work that just came out in July 12, right? And then there's this work. There's tez pool, I think this one. When did this come out? February 6. So a couple of works out, right? But these are almost echoes of works that were done over here, right? Probably half finished works that rosacea goes, okay, I might as well finish these and let's get these done. There's some, there seems to be something a little different going on here, which is why I want to highlight it here. It's quite beautiful.
00:02:43.464 - 00:03:11.330, Speaker A: There is a minimal thing. It's we see a reduction in the amount of colors you see. Almost like in a nice, like, contrast here, complementary colors, blue and yellow. Where is it? Violet and yellow, but basically almost on the opposite, blue and orange, violet and yellow. But basically, you know, it's a very good technique. Again, when you go across the color wheel to the complementary. And then you go one overdem.
00:03:11.330 - 00:03:32.070, Speaker A: And that's basically what we have here. We have blue and yellow, of course, blue and orange. And you just go one bit further and you're at yellow. Okay. Very powerful, beautiful contrast. Of course, if you have the equal amount of blue and orange together, that's a clash, right? So, but you put blue and yellow, that's a little easier. And so here we are.
00:03:32.070 - 00:04:09.172, Speaker A: So less icons and less color. A more minimal rise here after a break. In a sense, the benefits of taking breaks in a series, you come back with new eyes and new ideas, interestingly, and here also kind of a suggestive, like a knife here within this skull that is beautifully painted. Like it looks. And repeated here, it looks like Rosatio has a very interesting style. Digital collage and digital drawing. Right? So what I wonder, and I remember, I think Rosatio saying, you know, basically copyright free works.
00:04:09.172 - 00:04:52.698, Speaker A: But I wonder to myself if Rosatio is painting over top also, like, is Rosaccio painting this hand or is this, you know, a sampled hand from somewhere else? And even this beautiful skull, because. And the reason I say that is because Rosatio's works do have a certain texture, you might say, a kind of painterly texture, even. We see it in the technique, you know, the process, the arthem of Rosacea's work here. And kind of, you see it, you know, in the. I don't know if you can see it, but what you have here is there is texture, even in this kind of matte black and in the kind of off purple here, the blue purple. And then here you have the bright blue. And so there's a bit of texture here too.
00:04:52.698 - 00:05:22.660, Speaker A: An interesting repetition of the skull here, kind of almost like cycling through here. Here it's a circle, and then the skull almost cycling through. We see the bottom half here, maybe the top half here, a little bit missing in between. But then we have these windows, maybe with the missing area, not sure. So just a cool, interesting digital, truly digital collage here. A beautiful work. And, you know, just a final thing on this piece, the color.
00:05:22.660 - 00:05:55.034, Speaker A: Rosatio always manages to get a kind of harmony in the works. And you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of making work. This is what I used to do. I'll do it once in a while now, but I don't find the filters on Instagram as kind of useful anymore as I used to. But I remember, say, back in 2017, if I was making a work on my phone sometimes I would purposefully not worry about the color. I'd even go in randomly. Let's bring in random color, random color, random color with the idea.
00:05:55.034 - 00:06:30.228, Speaker A: Part of my process in those works, often in the peloponnesian wars, but peloponnesian war and other works, too. The idea was, that's okay. If none of these work, it can be garish and whatever, because I'm going to put it in the Instagram filter, which is going to harmonize this stuff. And then I can get the slider and decide how much of the filter I want to be used. And then I can kind of harmonize all these kind of wild colors, garish even at times. And then all of a sudden, I have a beautiful harmony. It's almost like putting notes that are random for music into like a scaler or something.
00:06:30.228 - 00:07:10.896, Speaker A: And then everything is scaled right. Everything is harmonized. It's harmonic. So when I see Rosatio's work, and just to back up, like, look at how kind of wonderfully color, like harmonically colored it is, I want to say, and just across, you do tend to see a fairly consistent, you might say, kind of color harmony. So just kind of interesting. It makes me wonder, is there a filter sometimes used, which is a great technique I'm a huge fan, say, of using. Sometimes you can use the, if you have an iPhone, you can use the Apple filter and whatnot.
00:07:10.896 - 00:07:33.054, Speaker A: So all to say, great to have rosatio back. Let's continue. A beautiful, beautiful work to start the show there. Love it. Let's continue. Lily Illo, fantastic AI artist. Again, we've been following probably since, you know, once we made the AI, once I made the AI breakthrough over here with strange thing, Lily Illo was not far behind of artists.
00:07:33.054 - 00:08:02.640, Speaker A: Probably shown dozens of her work here as well on this show over the episode. So thrilled to finally get her on as a guest on our live series on Wednesdays so that believe she's out of Australia. So that might be pretty late for her. So big shout out and thank you to Lily Illo. Come check it out. Should be another interesting discussion on art and in this case, AI. Of course, if you're not familiar with her work, this is kind of classic lily.
00:08:02.640 - 00:08:42.854, Speaker A: Hello. A surreal chair, an AI distorted chair playing with the mistakes kind of in a glitch like way with the mistakes of AI oftentimes, and having a beautiful kind of painterly style, especially, like, look how beautiful this looks on the website. Very professional looking situation here. And even these wonderful kind of crops that are going on. All sorts of stuff I love, just like this blue stripe. So just a little hint of what she's up to. Big shout out and thank you to everybody who picked up a piece of this new work from the secret history of World War Three.
00:08:42.854 - 00:08:59.910, Speaker A: Second round of negotiations, finally putting out some work here as I try and shorten this show. So giving me more time. So that is good. I got the show down to an hour last week. Let's keep moving towards these end goals here. Thank you, everybody again for picking one up. And thank you, Greek DX.
00:08:59.910 - 00:09:17.498, Speaker A: Janny Sortas putting in an offer which I just accepted, actually. Thank you. And I felt bad. Ilay put in an offer. I was out all day yesterday, was taken back, and then, you know, Jani Sortas, I couldn't say no. And actually I wanted to. I don't even want to say this, but I wanted to send my extra to waffles.
00:09:17.498 - 00:09:51.158, Speaker A: I'm going to send you another work, waffles. Because Waffles has sent me so much. We're going to see another work. So I'll just say you guys are on the short list of just me sending you some works, aylay and waffles. But Jenny Sirdis is the first person who ever actually bid on a work of mine on super rare, so I couldn't say no to that. So all to say thank you. And basically, what is this? This is combining a photo of paint with sampled paintings and also just screenshots of the news.
00:09:51.158 - 00:10:34.510, Speaker A: All made on an iPhone, mastered in Photoshop and just incorporating several techniques, you know. And so, yeah, using the fill here and everything. Yeah, I'm excited about this series. So again, hugely encouraging and support to get that support from everybody. Thank you so much. And a big thank you also to waffles, also known as sincerely, Kujib. Sync 18 with the pokebelly hair here that we saw from a previous PNG, I believe, pasted over top here, joy division shirt sent over one of one that has graduated in my universe to my profile picture on x.
00:10:34.510 - 00:10:51.570, Speaker A: So thank you. Huge thanks to Kujeb, who I owe a whole bunch of works to. I need to send some works to Kujeb. So you are again with Ilay on the shortlist there. Huge thank you. Just awesome comments show. So we got a few here.
00:10:51.570 - 00:11:11.318, Speaker A: Kyle Flemmer. So much respect and love for Kapn. Indeed, Kapn is a hit. And of course, for those that didn't see it, this is the work, Kappen's work from last show. Just a rad artwork. Like, you see the value in the artwork here, and it's gonna bring up an interesting conversation that's coming up in a few tabs. Teddy schnapps, bro.
00:11:11.318 - 00:11:31.464, Speaker A: Bringing back the dwarf fortress style, I assume that's a video game, and I assume that's referring to cap. And bringing back this kind of retro computer graphic style, I assume, is what's going on there. Thank you for the comment, Teddy. Ed Marolla. Hello, Poco friend. Always a pleasure when you review my art with your sharp eyes. Thank you, Ed.
00:11:31.464 - 00:12:26.340, Speaker A: Also, the art versus capital a art is very interesting. I love the understanding that art is a real thing, part of everyday life, and present in the mundane. Very important statement here. And I think, unfortunately, one of the effects of contemporary art getting so far out in a conceptual direction in the last, let's say, 30, 40 years is, I think, part of the public. I think it's disenfranchised part of the public. So that some parts of the public, you know, if, let's say you studied engineering or commerce, you know, did your thing, and then you're interested in art, but then you're getting, like, this super conceptual art that is supposed to be important, but just doesn't speak to you. I think, unfortunately, what can happen to a certain amount of the public is they don't think art is a real thing.
00:12:26.340 - 00:13:04.548, Speaker A: And it's a very important. Like, when I see this statement here, you know what I think of? I think of when I saw Philip Glass and Robert Wilson's Einstein on the beach in Toronto in 2012. Half empty theater, I might add, half empty theater. And shockingly, and I had chairs, like ten chairs in every direction I could sprawl. It's a four hour show, whatever. But the point is, when I saw that work, this avant garde work, it reminded me, I remember very clearly that. How I was excited, because it reminded me the avant garde is a real thing.
00:13:04.548 - 00:13:24.322, Speaker A: It's not some, you know, nebulous. I know not what that, you know, conceptual. It's not a reason. It's a real thing. It exists like avant garde art when it's awesome. Say, in the case of Einstein on the beach, that four hour opera, I mean, it is. That is like, it's real.
00:13:24.322 - 00:14:13.360, Speaker A: And to me, it was a bit of a reminder that the avant garde is a real thing and how awesome that is. It's exciting and inspiring and, uh, so let's continue with Ed's comment. The pedestal of fine arts and the elitism bias we often see around art spaces is dangerous. And I agree. It's unfortunate is how I would put it. Maybe it is dangerous because what does that do if a certain amount of the public is disenfranchised from art, which one could argue is a core, you know, elemental part of the human experience, and they are disenfranchised from that because of over, what I call over sophistication, I. What does that like? Does that actually, it probably does negatively impact society.
00:14:13.360 - 00:14:34.448, Speaker A: You know, art ultimately is a humanizing force. It should help rekindle feeling, as I did, as I felt when I saw Einstein on the beach. All of a sudden I was, I was inspired, I was moved. Right? What happens when we reduce art to a bunch of reasons? Right? So let's continue. I'm often confused. Yes. And you got the point instantly.
00:14:34.448 - 00:14:43.184, Speaker A: Awesome. Great to hear, Ed, great show. Kappen is so good. Great analysis. So Kapn, just loved across the board here. Gravitopia. Gravitopia.
00:14:43.184 - 00:14:56.706, Speaker A: Wow. Master cap. Amazing artist, right? So one of the true highlight, you know, great artists of this space. Totally agree. Kelly Burns, great to hear from you. We got another comment more in detail in the Twitter. We'll go to that one.
00:14:56.706 - 00:15:30.622, Speaker A: Thank you, Kelly, for the, for the, thank you, Kelly Burns, for the comment. Ah, heck. Joshua Sobel. I also completely agree with you, Adrian. The digital art stars of tomorrow are here today, clocking into their nine to fives. Gming, right? Because we saw, I think it was someone from verseworks was sort of like, all we need is the artists to get us, you know, our artists to get us to the next level of accessibility, where all of a sudden the art market will turn into this thing and will hit mainstream accessibility and this sort of thing. Yeah, exactly.
00:15:30.622 - 00:16:08.776, Speaker A: The artists are already here. I mean, what more do you need than the, say, kappen, work here, die with the most likes? You know, it's like, again, I struggle to shorten this show because there's so much interesting art coming out. So the issue isn't we don't need new artists and new artists are going to come and they're welcome and everything. That's gonna be great. But the artists are already here, as Joshua is agreeing with here and stating, the masses won't catch on until the larger narratives are considerately introduced. Interesting, interesting. Let's check back in a few years and.
00:16:08.776 - 00:16:32.050, Speaker A: Exactly. I mean, this could happen in a month, it could happen in six months, it could happen in six years, it could happen in 20 years, maybe even longer. It could be in decades. I don't think it will be because I think there's actually just too much real art going on. Like as we saw with that kappen piece. That's just too exciting for too many people is sort of my take. And there's only 16.
00:16:32.050 - 00:16:58.826, Speaker A: That's a market. And it's only, you know, maybe it takes a generation of young people who also like that kind of art, who are like, you know what? Enough of this. Whatever you guys are trying to peddle here. We like this and we're going to put it in our textbooks because it matters to us, right? So it really is a matter of time. Totally agree, ahack. Awesome to hear from you. We're in tune with a bit of a philosophical discussion here.
00:16:58.826 - 00:17:35.680, Speaker A: We're discussing techne. So going to try and keep this as short as we can. It always surprises me that in these rigorous conversations about art, beauty, techne Immanuel Kant never gets brought up. It's been a long time since I approached his text, the critique of judgment. So I won't waste our time pretending to be an expert. But as I recall, he makes incredibly useful analysis of our judgment of tastes or beauty or on beauty. And of course, he has a very famous, basically aesthetic theory on beauty, which again, there's too much reasoning in it for me because I've heard it before.
00:17:35.680 - 00:18:10.760, Speaker A: And even in Berlin I had an art consultant friend who's like, Adrian, you really have to know. You know, Kant's theory of beauty or aesthetic theory is very influential and important. And it's just a bunch of reasons, though, and that's okay. And that's cool. But I start from the experience of the art itself, and that is where I begin. As far as my understanding is, you know, as Terence McKenna would say, the felt presence of immediate experience is where I kind of begin. And then I rashed rationalize from there.
00:18:10.760 - 00:19:01.190, Speaker A: Why does this feel significant, let's say. So let's continue here, though, because just to get back to rune Thun's point here, which we haven't really discovered yet, ultimately, my takeaway, as I recall, was that the domain of craft and the domain of art are distinct from one another. And that while there may be crossover, ultimately these distinctions are made by the nature of purpose, right? So. Or telos, the talos, you know, to use the greek or the end, the ghoul the purpose that for the sake of which. So, of course, now to understand a little bit, at least this is the framework I bring very quickly. Hegel was seen as kind of the response, like he was an idealist. So he was sort of seen as a somewhat of a platonist to.
00:19:01.190 - 00:19:44.010, Speaker A: And then Kant, who was seen as more of the response to Aristotle, like almost the echo of Aristotle, let's say both at what I think would be the beginning of the 19th century, maybe the end of the 18th century, a little bit german philosophy. So as far as this whole, you know, I brought up here in a second here, cheap et. I think I brought it up. I may have actually got rid of it. I brought up that, you know, the first lines of, you know, cant's work, just to give that sense of the language of both Kant and haggle. I may have actually gotten rid of that tab. I did get rid of that tab.
00:19:44.010 - 00:19:59.834, Speaker A: But all to say, maybe I could bring it up very quickly. I do want to keep these shows short. Let's see. Chat GBT. Let's see. Can't. Here we go.
00:19:59.834 - 00:20:30.206, Speaker A: Okay, so let's finish rune tune's point then. Let's go. But again, this is semantics. As I recall, the domain of craft and the domain of art are distinct from one another, but they ultimately cross over until these distinctions are made by the nature of purpose. So I think what we're getting at here is, you know, certain things are made by craft. And again, these words are slippery. Do we mean arts and crafts like papier mache? Or are we talking about the craft of building, you know, back to the shoe? You know, craft of making a shoe.
00:20:30.206 - 00:21:04.664, Speaker A: The techniques, the processes, what we might call the art. Right. But I think to give the charity of interpretation a great lesson from Plato's crito, what I think runetoon is getting at here is the distinction between, you know, craft, the craft of making something and capital a. Art is the purpose in art. We're trying to do something poetic, let's say. Whereas with the shoe, we're trying to do something kind of functional and build something for your shoe. Again, I think this starts.
00:21:04.664 - 00:21:43.378, Speaker A: Yeah, so I would just say we're getting into weird semantic territory, which we could spend an entire show on. I actually think, just discussing this, maybe we should, I'm not interested enough in Gantt to do that, to be perfectly honest. And I'll show you why in a second. I brought it up on chat GPT, but I just think there's a lot of semantic slipperiness where it gets hard to say too many things with these words meaning so many different things. Art means so many. So that's why I like the Greek. We just go with the Greek, and it's like, oh, it shows the art of something.
00:21:43.378 - 00:22:27.686, Speaker A: But what do we mean? And the word often, though, because we use the words almost interchangeably. And art, the art of war, as you will say here and then, art, capital a art. And we don't put a capital a on it. And what they share is a series of processes or techniques or a process or a series of techniques that join together to get a certain result. You know, ultimately, what are artists? They are people that put together a series of processes or techniques, I should say a process, and that is their art, ultimately. And then you can try different kinds of processes. You know, you can like.
00:22:27.686 - 00:22:55.526, Speaker A: So for one series, I'll have a certain process. For a different series, I'll have a different set of techniques. And then those come to embody that series, as you see with secret history of World War three there, or with the peloponnesian war, another series, I did add a different set of techniques or a process. Right. So, yeah. So let's continue the comment here. We have a common language that uses the word art to describe anything that requires a skill or aesthetic.
00:22:55.526 - 00:23:35.290, Speaker A: The art of war, the art of cooking, the art of shoemaking. But Kant makes a distinction between art and craft design by underlying the function of art versus the function of craft. Right? And then you get to the point of, you know, again, I come from a different. Don't forget, like, cants are romantic. Capital r, romantic. So there was a very clear distinction between, you know, high art and low art, which arguably doesn't exist as much like that box up there with the 808. Like, to me, that's a, you know, in the, in a post duchamp world, where you all of a sudden put the urinal on its side, or I put the shoebox in a gallery.
00:23:35.290 - 00:24:06.348, Speaker A: You know, what's, you know, is this. Then you get back to this, like, can't. Talking about the purpose of the whatever. It seems like there was a very clear distinction between high and low art, or, you know, poetry proper or the sublime, and, you know, making shoes, which I don't think exists in the same way anymore. And I'm not sure it ever actually existed again. That's why I like my definition, frankly, of its poetic. It's art with.
00:24:06.348 - 00:24:56.728, Speaker A: With irrational input, things that make sense on an irrational level. That's what poetry is for me. That's the difference between a website and a painting is painting incorporates what I've titled another show, irrational variables and things that just seem to work, whether, you know, and I'm kind of back to what is poetry at the core? You know, the Odyssey, Shakespeare, like its simile, its comparison, its simile, you know, metaphor. Its using like, or as, you know, or like the wine dark sea, the rose, rosy fingered dawn in the Odyssey. Right. Its comparing, you know, and so its actually very kind of simple. So when Kant comes with all this stuff, I go, fine, but I just, I just see a castle in the sky with a loose, with a shaky foundation.
00:24:56.728 - 00:25:39.140, Speaker A: From my perspective, everybody's free to think what they want, but that's why I don't discuss, can't, because I don't find it particularly interesting, actually, I do, you know, and I want to be familiar and I want to get more close, but I don't need to, you know, I'm not going to struggle too far with can't. I think it's interesting. I think it's interesting input, as we'll see in a second here. Let's just finish. But Kant makes a distinction between art and craft or design by underlining the function of art versus the function of craft. So a very aristotelian thing. What is the telos? Just like the talos, the goal of the organism or the human organism, the purpose is to become an adult.
00:25:39.140 - 00:26:09.942, Speaker A: This is very kind of aristotelian thinking. The four causes and everything that I haven't reviewed in a long time, that there is a telos that, you know, say the human organism, it does have a certain end goal, which is to become an adult human. Right. And there's these stages of development. What is the telos? Right. So this is very, again, aristotelian, and this is as far as I can take us. Rune tune says I need to reread Kant.
00:26:09.942 - 00:26:56.708, Speaker A: We all need to read Kante, I guess, you know, again, I think we should be familiar with it. I would take the. I wouldn't like. And here's just very, very quickly here. So what's the first line of Kant and Hegel? What are the first lines of their texts, just for the sake of argument? Like, how do they open up their most famous works? Here's Kant, the critique of pure reason, human reason. This is the first line of the text, has the peculiar fate in one species of its cognitions that it is burdened with questions which it cannot dismiss, for they are posed by the nature of reason itself, but which it also cannot answer, for they transcend every capacity of human reason. So what does this mean? Very quickly, human reason.
00:26:56.708 - 00:27:23.798, Speaker A: So, not because you could argue animals reason, too. A dog at a certain level is reasoning. It's like, I want to eat that. Like, and this, I don't want to eat, and I want to go outside. This is, you could argue, a kind of cognition. So human reason has the peculiar fate in one species of its cognitions, in one way of its thinking, that it is burdened. Again, huge interpretation.
00:27:23.798 - 00:28:27.020, Speaker A: Is it a burden? Isn't this like we could argue? It's like it's should be thankful with questions which it cannot dismiss, with questions about these things. Like, is it a burden? There's all sorts of interpretation, slippery language. So the burden, though, for Kant, employing the charity of interpretation, is, hey, there's questions that are being that our reason creates a branch of our thinking and cognition, that creates, that we can't dismiss. We've created, you know, questions that our reason creates, questions that we can't dismiss, and they're posed by reason itself, but reason cannot answer them, for they transcend reason. Okay, so again, I just see, okay, interesting. But just from me personally, there's too many assumptions in here. For me personally, this is starting, putting too much faith in thinking and reason, as that's going to solve all the mysteries of the universe.
00:28:27.020 - 00:28:57.630, Speaker A: I much prefer, you know, again, I'm kind of back to Socrates. Where are you going? I'm going to the port. There's a little party. Oh, cool. A dialogue between two people, and then it grows and grows, and the mystery gets, you know, final point on this is, I was thinking to myself, like, philosophy is a strange word. Love of wisdom. Again, I think coming from the Pythagoreans in the 500 bc, love of wisdom, it's a weird little domain.
00:28:57.630 - 00:29:40.408, Speaker A: It's kind of like almost a secular wisdom tradition to a certain degree. I'd argue in the west or out of ancient Greece, call it what we will. So what Kant is doing here, I would argue, is a different project. It's related. Like, okay, we're trying to figure out stuff with our brain, but is this about the love of wisdom? Which is a pretty weird, esoteric, actually project. This is more about how far can we get with just abstraction alone. Right? You could call it philosophy, but it's just a different project.
00:29:40.408 - 00:30:45.786, Speaker A: And maybe that's fair enough. It's changed in the thousand years since, but in retrospect, we group it all together as the same project called philosophy, and then we take classes thinking. Okay, this is, you know, the evolution but I'd actually argue back to almost Kants Point, which is ultimately an aristotelian one. There are different goals here. The goal of, say, ancient greek philosophy is, how do you live a good life? How do you, like, what do we actually know? A very skeptical kind of, you know, do we know anything? And if we do, what can we know as far as we can think that we know it here? It's like, where's the humility? You know, like, oh, I'm just making this huge declaration here, and there's no sense of skill. It's just like, here's the truth from the philosopher that we're all supposed to believe. So it's just a different kind of way of being that when I'm reading, and that's just one line, how many more assumptions are going to be in the next line and then the next line and pages and chapters and whatever.
00:30:45.786 - 00:31:31.910, Speaker A: So then it just becomes about, like, okay, like, based on what, you know, Kant finally, you know, was like, famously never had sexual intercourse, as far as I understood. He stayed within 5 km, famously or something to this effect of where he worked his entire life. So are we gonna, are you gonna all of a sudden say, okay, this person has the theory of art that we must all agree because he thought his way through it. You know, I just start from a different step. So that's kind of my sense of like, no, I don't feel like I need to spend hours and hours with Kant. I'll read the chat GPT summary, preferably, and we actually have that here. We don't have time to go through it all.
00:31:31.910 - 00:32:18.660, Speaker A: I just want to bring one more point, though, up, which is Hegel's phenomenology of spirit. How does it start? What is the first line of this masterpiece by Hegel? Finally, again, these are, you know, this is the time of romantic genius. Like, what is the year on this? I'm guessing like 1819 or something like, shall we look just Hegel phenomenology of spirit, date 1807. Okay, so we're talking like romanticism, capital r. We're in the heat of it. This is how it begins. In the case of philosophical work, it seems not only superfluous, but inappropriate and misleading.
00:32:18.660 - 00:33:20.722, Speaker A: To begin with an explanation of the end the work aims to achieve, as well as the means by which it aims to achieve it. So what is he saying here? When we're doing philosophy, it seems not only superfluous, but inappropriate and misleading. To begin with an explanation of what we're trying to do, what the end of the work aims to achieve the end or purpose, the telos, the goal, as well as how we intend to do it. This is inappropriate, according to Hegel. So am I going to struggle through the phenomenology of spirit? Maybe I need to go through further, but there's only so many texts you can read. I would rather read the summary. And I guess at the end of the day, I'm incredibly skeptical of a lot of like, again, this is kind of canonical, without question, in philosophy departments everywhere.
00:33:20.722 - 00:33:54.300, Speaker A: But just from a personal perspective, I'm not living my life according to these sentences, according to these words. You know, is this promoting thinking? Again, this is a different project as far as I'm concerned. This is like speculation. It's a similar project. But, you know, again, you could say the presocratics are just speculating on reality too, but there just seems to be too much faith in reason, which makes sense. This is from the enlightenment, right? So as an artist, it's like you studied surrealism. We've seen what happened with World War two, World War one.
00:33:54.300 - 00:34:36.898, Speaker A: The data is responding to World War one and the reason and the failure of reason. Can we go to these texts and start saying, how much credulity can we give them now? Unfortunately, we do not have time to go through all this. I did bring up the critique of judgment. Also, you can get a summary on Kant's theory of aesthetics from chat GPT and here, I mean, the famous part of it that I do remember is the art for art's sake argument, judgment of taste, disinterested pleasure. For Kant, I'll just look at one part, though, because I think it's important. It's right at the top. For Kant, the judgment of beauty is based on disinterested pleasure.
00:34:36.898 - 00:35:30.290, Speaker A: This means that the pleasure derived from perceiving something as beautiful is not influenced by a personal interest, desire, or practical purpose. The appreciation is purely contemplative. Again, a very romantic notion. And I look at my secret history of world War three, like in my ideal of ideals, it actually has a very practical purpose. If all of a sudden you start getting news and then artists start responding to the news and transform the narrative, a kind of mirroring transformation, as we see with Warhol and taking iconography, this alchemical transformation that artists do of icons that we've already experienced, that's interesting. And you know what? That's practical, I would argue. So I'm kind of back to like, this is interesting, but art for art's sake, like, do we live in this world anymore? So that's why I start with just very basic.
00:35:30.290 - 00:36:02.502, Speaker A: What's the greek? Okay, what can we say? And I don't go too far. I'm not going to try and build some castle in the skyd because I almost think it's a fruitless endeavor to a certain degree. But I'm very skeptical of what we can know. Science works, and that's all. We don't even know why. When you really dig down and you watch all the lectures on the history of science, which I have, there's brilliant ones from the great courses. You get to these lectures, which are like, we don't even know why mathematics and science work well together.
00:36:02.502 - 00:36:26.608, Speaker A: We just know that they do, but we don't know why. Okay. Like, that's, like, the science just works, so we go with it. Like, that's where we are philosophically with science. And so I don't know if Kant and Hegel, I think there's too much hubris, frankly, for them to be at that point. They believe. I mean, okay, fair enough.
00:36:26.608 - 00:36:46.270, Speaker A: What do I know about Kant? His main famous thing is a critique of pure reason. So he's saying what we can't know ultimately. Right. So maybe we'll leave it there, though. Yeah, like, what do I know about can't is kind of like my kind of final thing on this. But I go with what? Just my thoughts. This is a journal.
00:36:46.270 - 00:36:59.238, Speaker A: It is not a philosophy class. Although I do intend on going back to the early platonic works. Let's continue. Or to the platonic corpus there and the. Yeah, but we will. Xu Xiliang watching. Awesome.
00:36:59.238 - 00:37:12.912, Speaker A: With a classic. Xu Xiliang. Loading. Filippo francocci. Thanks for featuring my work, Adrian. As you mentioned, I began the painting with randomness and refined the details with brushes. Reminds me of Salvador Dali's ink drawings where you'll see a lot of spray.
00:37:12.912 - 00:37:45.564, Speaker A: I think I brought did I? I had them up here before we went to here. It reminds me of Dali's ink works later works where I think he was incorporating some of what we were learning from John Cage and the abstract expressionists, which were all the rage in the fifties. When I think Dali was making some of these ink works, similar process. Put down a bunch of ink, what do you see? And then start drawing around that. Very fun way to work. Very cool way to work. Using irrational and rational techniques.
00:37:45.564 - 00:37:55.880, Speaker A: We could argue. Thank you for the comment there, Filippo. I'm honored to be on your show. Thank you. I love the process because it often yields surprising results. Awesome. Dropkick.
00:37:55.880 - 00:38:08.296, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment, Kelly. Burns. Love this one. Adrian. And the last one with die with the most likes tapping into new realms here. It's awesome to see a kind of and kind of scary as well. Joy Division, psilocybin, Terrence McKenna.
00:38:08.296 - 00:38:18.608, Speaker A: So much great stuff. Go, man. Love it. Awesome. Glad you're enjoying that. This journal, that's the beautiful thing about the journal format. You can really go in any direction you want.
00:38:18.608 - 00:38:26.644, Speaker A: Maestro Museum, awesome episode. Thanks for the great work. My absolute pleasure, Maestro. Thank you for watching. Skull takes. Great show. NFts are dead.
00:38:26.644 - 00:38:50.320, Speaker A: It's digital art or digitized art in my opinion. Yeah, I don't think nfTs, again, someone else brought this point up a long time ago. Like, we don't call it, you know, credit card art or check art or cash art as we do. Like, you know, we don't refer to how the process of it being paid. It's digital art ultimately. And I think that's probably what's going to stay. NFTs of course have the stigma.
00:38:50.320 - 00:39:09.286, Speaker A: It seems very historical. It's already starting to sound like an old concept. I don't know about you, but NFT, just as a concept, it sounds very 2021 in my universe. So it's interesting. Let's continue. Shinobu Takuru I hope you one day will scratch one of my pieces. That is what the community is for, Shinobu.
00:39:09.286 - 00:39:19.506, Speaker A: So feel free to drop a link there. Try once a week. Max put a work in there. You're more than welcome to. That is how you get on the radar. Kazeworks it was a great watch. Thank you so much.
00:39:19.506 - 00:39:40.274, Speaker A: Oyaniki and just awesome. Continuing on first syndrome high artist journal community and we have AI. I think it's AI. Video of dogs. Dogs with look like 1960s haircuts there. Very interesting. Ballad to wig dog.
00:39:40.274 - 00:40:00.996, Speaker A: So wigged dogs. Interesting. I assume that's AI, but I do not know. Retro Manny I love Albert's art. Hope you enjoy it too. So here, what looks like kind of digital painting, kind of in the comic book style, kind of watercolor, but we see the pencil here, so obviously done on procreate. You see how powerful digital art tools are.
00:40:00.996 - 00:40:15.522, Speaker A: Very cool, very nice. Thank you for posting that, Manny. Ilya Barabin, my home studio. And here we see the airbrush at work. The tool of the moment, the airbrush at work. Ilya Barabin thank you for posting that. Skull takes.
00:40:15.522 - 00:40:41.250, Speaker A: This is one of my pieces for the horse trading event horse of July, hosted by Texadelic and John Cates. I have some left. If you have a horse to trade. And here. So, of course, John Cates, pioneering the western glitch art style. And of course, they do the horse trading. Victoria Widim Wittheim sensitive to objects, part of an idyllic quest to reveal the sensitive character of metal.
00:40:41.250 - 00:41:01.100, Speaker A: So here are some examples. Interesting project there. That's on Zora Black line, an animated abstract and texadelic, another horse trading work. And there we go. And we are back to last show. So thank you, everybody, for posting rad work here from Kurt Hussle collective, which I think we saw last show. We have another one this show.
00:41:01.100 - 00:41:38.250, Speaker A: Into the comments we go, Santiago. Everyone believes Tezos is being paid attention and we are growing. And soon a Tezos summer and madness is coming. I actually do kind of feel that way, too. It is starting to feel like the animal spirits are starting to light up a bit on Tezos art. And it's interesting because the art, you know, crypto has been very kind of up and down, I'd argue the digital art scene, particularly based out of tezos. And then also Zora, is, it hasn't really skipped a beat.
00:41:38.250 - 00:41:53.186, Speaker A: It hasn't missed a step. Like it kind of just continues pushing through. Do I have a way to check this idea that Otezo's summer is coming? No. Do you have a. Do you have a way to check. I've been bullish nonstop three years, even if that, when it could sound absurd. Yes.
00:41:53.186 - 00:42:09.448, Speaker A: Yes. You can look at Santiago's timeline there. Here's another example. Like, I'm seeing a few more kind of sales like this. Here's Kristin Roose. So nice to see a significant secondary sale. And I mean, this beautiful work here by Kristin Roose, I think sold for two or 300.
00:42:09.448 - 00:42:50.364, Speaker A: We can check really quickly here on secondary 300 tezos for an addition of 25, hopefully. Okay, we are back, and there is the work. So 300 tezos edition of 25. Not bad at all. So continuing on, unknown collector, while everyone else seems to go up in flames, while everything else seems to go up in flames, tezos rises from the ashes like a phoenix. It's kind of, you know, there is, again, it seems like tezos, the power, like the. It's very bullish on what we've been discussing here for the last two years, which is the art is significant, and if it is truly significant, it will stand the test of time.
00:42:50.364 - 00:43:07.654, Speaker A: And I think this is kind of what's going on here. This got a lot of attention. 70,000 views. Incredible. Super rare, John from super rare. So I think the founder, one of the founders, of super rare. Are people still minting on Tez? If so, curious why, and there were a ton of responses.
00:43:07.654 - 00:43:50.488, Speaker A: I got a couple here. It is a genuine question, as we'll see here. And so I think it's very simple, actually, which is the reason why people are still minting on Tez is because artists follow the money. And the easiest way to get money in digital art is to put your work on Tazos. And the reason is because the prices are very low and the fees are very low. So there's an automatic market, and art is cheap. You can get a Kappn for $10 like we saw last episode, and it costs you no fees, right? And so everybody wins.
00:43:50.488 - 00:44:11.830, Speaker A: And that's why the additions are a big thing on Tazo. So the reason why is because artists are making money. That is the reason why. Why are artists minting on Zora? Because they are making money. It is that simple, I would argue. I call it the beating heart of this scene. So this got a huge response.
00:44:11.830 - 00:45:04.758, Speaker A: And unknown collector, most interesting art related projects happening then elsewhere, referring to tezos and more in comparison to their size, to be frank. Really trying to connect digital art to the world, pushing great curation, art experimentation to the front. When a platform like object, and now also the Tiz foundation invests so much time and energy to genuine support art and culture, they deserve support back. It really. I still think it's about the art itself, though. And the reason the art is good is because the money is real, like, so, you know, there's a very important relationship between art and money that exists because it creates incentive. And so there's, especially if you live in somewhere like South America, where all of a sudden, if you're making $30 a day like Zuozo or NUv 1914 is, I mean, that's a paycheck, as far as I understand, $30 american.
00:45:04.758 - 00:45:39.888, Speaker A: That's not a bad paycheck. So, you know, so let's continue our also still best alternatives to l two s. So Tazo, still a better alternative to some of the l two s. Still not brought on the idea of centralized, single point of failure chains for fine art, which get criticized a lot, these L2s as being too centralized. Rather risk losing provenance on tezos, where things were born naturally in a real culture exists, than supporting l two money machines. Interesting. Still think eth main is the chain for art when it comes to Providence, which is interesting, but my fave alternative, definitely tazos.
00:45:39.888 - 00:46:23.716, Speaker A: Very interesting. Why sigma toad mates? Let's give the lad a benefit of the doubt because a lot of people are harsh on super rare John. It seems to give you give in to pettiness. Understandable when questions like these are asked. I am unclear as to what promoted the inquiry, but hey, I am here for it. So yeah, so yeah, in a sense, I guess it's just a cultural difference between the chains and I think it's and you know, to super rare John's credit just got my object collecting account yesterday, you know, and it's almost like all crypto, like you got to do it to understand it. And so finally I would think super Airdrogen already had a Tazos account, but apparently not.
00:46:23.716 - 00:46:45.186, Speaker A: So now collecting on object, so happy ending and all is good. Rada as a crypto artist and collector, I've tested many networks and Tezos is the most friendly, stable and fast. I would yeah, and it's the notifications on object as well. Object has an excellent website. Someone was criticizing. I don't think I brought it up here. I may have, but I don't think I brought it up.
00:46:45.186 - 00:47:31.850, Speaker A: Someone was really criticizing the UI on object, which I thought was like, this is like, I've called it like almost a perfect website. So yeah, anyways, let's continue. I wish I could collaborate, but I can't. It's just my user experience. So, Rada, loving the tezos over there. Also minting works on ETh Jedi Wolf recently I came across statements from ordinal maxis that struck me as manipulative seeming aiming to undermine Ethereum and NFTs by citing external technical aspects like IPfs usage or interplanetary file server usage. In other words, having to link to a separate decentralized solution where the images are where I think you have to pay fees, if I'm not mistaken.
00:47:31.850 - 00:47:59.316, Speaker A: Firstly, I dismiss such voices. No solution is perfect. There are always trade offs for ordinals as well, and they go into it. And there's a very important lesson here because the person is saying, well, actually, ordinals, Maxis ordinals lack official support from bitcoin core dev team. Actually, they see ordinals as exploiting a vulnerability in bitcoin core. That's true. Bitcoin's l one wasn't designed for storing assets on chain.
00:47:59.316 - 00:48:48.934, Speaker A: It's intended as a payment system and store of value vulnerabilities for exploiting vulnerabilities for unintended on chain asset storage and bitcoin could be seen as a form of hijacking without official support and overall consensus regarding ordinals, the future of their art on BTC is uncertain and it got me thinking. All of these blockchains, I would argue your future is uncertain. IPFS has, as this person points out, there is no perfect solution here. Ordinals is not necessarily going to be there forever. The IPFs ultimately, it seems like at some point, servers are kind of even ethereum. It sounds like some people will talk about how if Amazon Web Services went down, what would happen to Ethereum. Interesting.
00:48:48.934 - 00:49:11.884, Speaker A: I don't know. Don't claim to know. But I'll tell you the lesson. What I thought to myself, I talk here about digital artists making physical art. Here is a reason for you to make physical art. Because if all this stuff crashes, what are you left with? Another reason to make physical art as far as I'm concerned. So interesting comment JPEG's twin.
00:49:11.884 - 00:49:38.898, Speaker A: Random thought this morning as I'm scrolling the timeline being maxi, anything seems like such a self defeating way to go about things. At some point you'll find yourself arguing and defending your standpoint just because you've self identified with the community of that particular thing you're maxi about. Why impose limits on yourself? Exactly. From the artist's perspective, there's no need, I would argue, to be tribal on your blockchain. It is self defeating. I would argue. I'd agree with JPEG's twin here.
00:49:38.898 - 00:50:26.232, Speaker A: I'd argue what you want to do is use actually multi be multi chain as an artist, a digital artist, and you know, make physical art of your digital work. It gives you more credibility as an artist, I would argue. And there's more resilience there then maybe like, I mean, who knows, maybe the physical work is what actually stands like survives the longest rather than your ordinal. Adrian Right? So just I thought that provoked some interesting thoughts. I was like the importance of physical work was reminded to me, demon ego, my two physical works sold on crowd moves are ready to go to their collectors and they are leaving tomorrow. So there they are. Look at how beautiful the shipping situation is.
00:50:26.232 - 00:50:42.808, Speaker A: Look at that certificate of authenticity. Demon ego doing a wonderful job there. That is so important. Even a cool UPC code or QR code, I should say. Cwampa. Thanks for the love. The nearest shop I can get a canvas from is 250 km away.
00:50:42.808 - 00:51:05.952, Speaker A: Thanks to digital art. I don't have to rely on art supplies. I can carry them anywhere I want. Awesomely. And how true is that? And a work in progress from Cwampa. Awesome artist here is dancontrol showing on a screen showing physically more cool stuff here. Good morning from the meat show here is Hermipe pixel art.
00:51:05.952 - 00:51:21.426, Speaker A: A artist. A very cool pixel artist. Look at these physicals. I don't know if you can see that. Look at how cool this looks. So again. And if this was purely digital, would we have the same effect? I would say no.
00:51:21.426 - 00:51:35.970, Speaker A: It's way more powerful physically here. So I continue to be excited by the physical here. It's continued. Look at how great it looks. Even the signing underneath. Very cool. Xerox.
00:51:35.970 - 00:52:03.160, Speaker A: Trust the process. As you see this Gif developing here and here. Like those old dot matrix computers, line by line, loud, so almost looking like using an old computer style or computer printer, putting on paper. Very smart, Sabato. It's the last weekend to catch Barbie World breakdown. Here's actually the free work I believe that you can get when you. So if you go to Sabato's page, click on the link here.
00:52:03.160 - 00:52:22.332, Speaker A: One more week and you just gotta love this pixelated Barbie here that has been completely taken apart, disintegrated into pixels. Beautiful, beautiful. This is just kind of funny. Walk here. Julie Marutu's painting versus walk studio. Kind of. There is a similarity there.
00:52:22.332 - 00:52:37.336, Speaker A: Walk. Even in the color. Hilariously. Victor Acevedo Art now la just published a review about the DNA, fourth of four digital art retrospective, 1975 to present. Here is the website. So here, just some works. And as you see, kind of.
00:52:37.336 - 00:53:12.540, Speaker A: You see the impact of Photoshop on what I call the first generation of digital art, especially on the eighties and nineties. You really see that here. This, I think also Victor Acevedo made this work here, which I think using some 3d software as well. So just interesting, interesting, interesting. Human boy, look at this. So I think we've learned something very important from human boys experiments. When you put the flashing images of different images, that works the best on the algorithm.
00:53:12.540 - 00:53:39.592, Speaker A: Here we see again coming back to form with, you know, over 20,000 views, 253 retweets. And it seems like the reach of digital art is declining a little bit. Interestingly, like you're not getting as much bang for your buck. 253 retweets should be higher. More views than 20,000. Right, here's. Here is Martin Bruce actually on Zora.
00:53:39.592 - 00:54:00.466, Speaker A: Really interesting digital art piece here by Martin Bruce. Fits the screen beautifully here. That has only been minted. Let's see, five minted so far, available for another 27 days. That's on Zora. Here is hastruba waffle, also known as Kujeb sink 20. So putting out a few works.
00:54:00.466 - 00:54:13.562, Speaker A: Little mini terminator here. So to be finished would be a relief. So there's one. Love the eyes on this one. Sync 19. This went to Mikey Wilson. I think I saw this minted.
00:54:13.562 - 00:54:27.946, Speaker A: I didn't have any tez in my wallet. And this was. Look at this. Has dribble waffle lists this for two tazos, $0.30. His one of one. Hilariously so. Mikey Wilson, very quick on the draw there.
00:54:27.946 - 00:54:40.790, Speaker A: I saw that being minted. I missed it. I had like a tezos 80 or something in my wallet. Hilariously. Rec cloak with a one of one edition of one. Let's see if we can zoom in here. So again, playing with a couple of different brushes here.
00:54:40.790 - 00:54:56.434, Speaker A: Kind of like oil stick on the edges here. And then kind of a paintbrush in the back. Kind of a wild. Another kind of surreal work by ratcloak. Kind of dark, 27 50 by 3000. And sold for 150 tezos. Nice sale.
00:54:56.434 - 00:55:15.898, Speaker A: A one of one here is axin. And here, just kind of the sketchbook style, right? Just putting just, you know, here's the weather or your phone here, just various different things. We saw the. Thank you. Have a good day. Here are some friars. So very cool.
00:55:15.898 - 00:55:28.662, Speaker A: Very nice post there. 15,000 views. Pretty good. Here's Bazaya, who, of course, I follow. That is a glitch on x when you load up a bunch of tabs. If you want to win, bet on me. So kind of a weird, almost a crucifix here.
00:55:28.662 - 00:56:18.060, Speaker A: Looking work with MF mask here. And kind of a trading card like structure, even in the name here. So interesting piece there from Bezaya here is Kurt Hussle collective. It's two minutes long, so we can't watch the whole thing, but a kind of a parody of the news here. So really cool music as ever. And it keeps going. So just beautiful, beautiful work here.
00:56:18.060 - 00:56:31.682, Speaker A: Hilarious soundtrack. Five tezos. I picked one up, actually, yesterday. You have selected news. Here's Uri J. I think we saw the work in progress. This is now on Zora six, minted so far.
00:56:31.682 - 00:56:51.320, Speaker A: And this is available for another 26 days. And here you see a tree and what looks like almost like a fire truck or something, maybe a park bench. Interesting size or canvas here. Ratio. Here's another super interesting piece by Uri J. This is of a house. You almost get a window into Yuri J's process here.
00:56:51.320 - 00:57:06.348, Speaker A: The outlines of our lives, as I was calling it, the other show here. And which maybe get filled in. So kind of a window from Yuri J. And here, Yuri J. This is just a variation. Don't take it seriously. Well, I can't help myself because it still looks pretty cool.
00:57:06.348 - 00:57:29.750, Speaker A: We see the interesting repetition of layers here that Yuri J. We saw on the last work here with the lamp. And it's tempting to see maybe with the chair over here too. So just end here with maybe a little bit of repeating layers. So interesting work there. Here is goyong arts and this. Usually these are moving, but this is just distill here.
00:57:29.750 - 00:57:47.280, Speaker A: Maybe a work in progress or maybe an older work, not sure. Beautiful work here with these kind of pixelated masks. Here's Nov 1914 doing what looks like f one. And people cheering and everything. Hilarious. So new subject matter here. 26 dezos edition of one.
00:57:47.280 - 00:58:12.600, Speaker A: This is also NUv 1914 on Zora. Look at this piece playing with the teddy bear vibe and doing this almost very minimal color scheme. And unfortunately I can't see how much it's like blue on blue. You just have to hit the mint there. So I can't tell how many have been minted. It looks like a few comments though. This is a new artist I haven't seen before, Buju Bunang.
00:58:12.600 - 00:58:34.790, Speaker A: And check this out. This is also on Zora 36. Is there volume? Oh, there is. Not sure if that's copyright or not. Anyway, pretty cool. Maybe it's AI. A very interesting pixel artist here.
00:58:34.790 - 00:58:46.704, Speaker A: Buju bunang. That's again on Zora three minted only. Here's Argyle duckduck zoos. And this came out about a month ago. Completely missed it. Interesting. Escher like Mc.
00:58:46.704 - 00:59:06.350, Speaker A: Escher like patterning here on the left. And very cool. Just pixel art piece overall, this wavy pattern. Also the frame edition of 13 sold for only. I saw a tweet, only 15 tazos. Pretty good. Anis Abdin here is liquid city playing with Game Boyd.
00:59:06.350 - 00:59:31.314, Speaker A: Seemingly color scheme here. Doesn't it look like it? Yeah, there it is. Game boy color hashtag with the city there. Here is kikilo blue sky. So very interesting pixel art here. Kind of reminds me of murakit and suisoichi. These kinds of like different kinds of pixels and nice kind of movement here as well.
00:59:31.314 - 00:59:47.168, Speaker A: Another work by rip cash. We saw the redhead and I want to say, can't remember the other color. Maybe red and gray. Now we have the blue and gray. Right again, these could all be physicals. Very cool. Orc here from Ripcache.
00:59:47.168 - 01:00:14.800, Speaker A: Here is Sabato open edition blue screen of death, of course, referring to the news event. And here, new write up here. And playing with the QR code that is animated using deluxe paint. Four, I believe. Yes, it is emulated on an on an emulated Amiga 1200 computer. So cool there. Postmodern uribos with a cool kind of play on a screen.
01:00:14.800 - 01:00:28.046, Speaker A: 100,000 views. My word. That is impressive. And then the great Haiti rocket master blaster. This is an edition of one. I'm the master blaster. And very beautiful work here.
01:00:28.046 - 01:00:43.322, Speaker A: I don't even know what it is, but it's beautiful. The colors are beautiful. Just rad work from Haiti rocket. Here's Kristen Rus. New work, color bars. So let's open this and see. So here it is at full.
01:00:43.322 - 01:01:01.844, Speaker A: So quite a large work for Kristen Roose, actually. And. Yeah. 15 tezos and edition of 15. Here's another work, Renato. Be the rainbow. So very interesting kind of low resolution artworks, aren't there? And look at this rainbow.
01:01:01.844 - 01:01:30.402, Speaker A: It's quite beautiful as a stream. And this interesting kind of 45 degree angle grid here is exchange art and kind of a pixel art work here. And is it Taka, the name of the artist? Taka's bounce. Takashi being the artist. And a reserve of $90 or half a sol. Cool work there. Here's some cool works by Francoise Gamma that came out a few weeks ago here.
01:01:30.402 - 01:01:44.670, Speaker A: I thought this had. I thought this was a video. Maybe it's just a gif. And the others are videos. So here is the first one. Interesting, kind of smaller, kind of looks like playing with the glitch roms. Here's some audio.
01:01:44.670 - 01:02:15.180, Speaker A: This is a video. Very interesting. And here's just a snippet of the third. It's almost like a glitched out video game. And glitching out the audio too, maybe. What's funny is I feel like I recognize the audio there. I'm not sure what game that's from, but I feel like I recognize the audio.
01:02:15.180 - 01:02:28.388, Speaker A: Weirdly. Here is DJ Curo. That was flossoise gamma. Here's Kiro. And we'll see if there's any volume. No, this is on rodeo, which I think is foundation's kind of version of Zora's app. I think it's just a free mint sort of thing.
01:02:28.388 - 01:02:44.690, Speaker A: Similar structure. So not sure. You might be able to get some low mint. Only one minted or none. So you might be able to get some good. Because not too many people using rodeo right now. So you might be able to get some low editions for very cheap.
01:02:44.690 - 01:03:20.170, Speaker A: Interestingly, here is Zozo. Just drifting. Always super original and interesting. This is on Zora, two minted only. So very interesting. Here's another one by Zuozo on object. You see the cat on the chair.
01:03:20.170 - 01:03:41.200, Speaker A: Kind of a different kind of piece from Zozo doing a cat. So very fun. There are two interior design cat edition of one selling for 30 tazos. Pretty good. Here's another one. Sin also selling for 30 tezos. So zuozo putting out like at least a work a day, doing very well.
01:03:41.200 - 01:04:00.382, Speaker A: You can see why. So just super original digital art here from Zozo. Six second clip on loop. Interesting title. Sin. There's the snake, maybe garden of eden. Here is Uyoh 66 bloodbath.
01:04:00.382 - 01:04:15.274, Speaker A: Let's go. So again, I'm just going to have to put less works in to get that. 40 minutes to 45 minutes. Ideal I am pursuing here on this show. So uyo 66, another beautiful work. Blood bath. This is on object.
01:04:15.274 - 01:04:37.960, Speaker A: Kind of a different feel for Uyo, who usually has a pretty illustrative style. Here is axtone on super rare, so reserve price of 2.2 and let's see if we can make this bigger. And there it is. So really cool. Artist on super rare puts out work occasionally that I see. Cool piece.
01:04:37.960 - 01:04:55.180, Speaker A: Kind of a Sci-Fi looking situation. Not exactly sure cool. Illustration Black Mesa x by axstone. Here's Ezra eslin. Boys don't cry. This was minted July 17, so not that long ago. I don't think we've looked at it because I don't remember all these little devil figures.
01:04:55.180 - 01:05:07.760, Speaker A: So a new one. And there's depression. Kill me please. Supermarket. So there's the ghosts. And so another cool one from Ezra eslund starting a bit of 0.66 eth.
01:05:07.760 - 01:05:26.658, Speaker A: And here is someone called Fiedler, which I saw. I don't know if someone post this in the community. I saw this online, this on foundation, see if it loads up here. It is so cool. Animated illustration here. All sorts of logos in the background. Sold for five eth.
01:05:26.658 - 01:05:45.954, Speaker A: And this is from June 7, 2023. So this is a year old, but I've never, I'm not sure we've seen this artist Fiedler. Cool. And here is Jake Studios. This is on Zora Gatil Yeo 13 minted. So far so cool. Animated illustration from Jake Studios.
01:05:45.954 - 01:06:05.470, Speaker A: And here's another one. Hey Leng, say heaven cool. Almost person made of pixelated drawn clouds here. And the mirror turning into a lucifer like figure. This is an addition of one now at 20 tezos. Interesting. Atelier 407, who we haven't looked at for a while.
01:06:05.470 - 01:06:33.454, Speaker A: They put out a series 40 of 40. So here is just a snippet, I think, of some of the works in this series and sold out. Minted out, by the way, impressively, here's Lorna Mills playing with yellow right now. And here, as you see on her instagram, goes according to color, oftentimes. Here is mumble boy. And interesting combination of a little bit of drawing here. So kind of a different feel in this mumble boy.
01:06:33.454 - 01:06:45.660, Speaker A: Not all photo collage. Interesting piece. Edition of two for eight tazos. And here's an addition of one for twelve tezos. Also loft. I think it's loft in space. Or is it loft in space? Let's see.
01:06:45.660 - 01:07:08.360, Speaker A: Loft in space, indeed. Huge file, 6000 by 5000. And here's psycho futurist. Will this be in the test? Kind of a wild, kind of CGI like animation. Another cool one from psycho futurist on edition of ten for ten tezos. And selling quite a few, actually for five. So almost selling out here.
01:07:08.360 - 01:07:26.852, Speaker A: Maybe it's listed on secondary for ten tezos. So selling out at five tezos. Here's walk abra, I think, part of the Pokemon series, if I'm not mistaken. Another digital artwork from walk. Here's ex mortal. Beautiful repetition here. Lonely.
01:07:26.852 - 01:07:40.670, Speaker A: So really fantastic glitch here from exmortal. This is really beautiful glitching. Just the double and the difference in the double and just the texture. Really nicely done. Sean. Luke. Dragon knot.
01:07:40.670 - 01:07:56.050, Speaker A: Interesting. So playing more with this kind of patterning here. Cool colors. And edition of seven. Here is Renki Junior ogura. So interesting work here. We saw a similar piece last episode.
01:07:56.050 - 01:08:09.018, Speaker A: This is a new one. Here's Lena Eckert. Eckart. Eckert with a piece, an animated abstract here. So we saw that super, I think that super distorted one. That was super cool. Abstract.
01:08:09.018 - 01:08:26.000, Speaker A: Here's another abstract. So super cool there. And continuing on, Sulkian, a remix on Zora, using a lot of CGI. Very surreal kind of artist, Sulkian. Think I'm going to see him in Argentina. Here's no hygiene as we go into AI. Very experimental AI.
01:08:26.000 - 01:08:41.282, Speaker A: This is called bird. This is 35 tezos on object edition of one. And here, just wild AI artwork. I'm not sure if this was posted anywhere. Also by no hygiene. Not sure if that's raw AI. That would be pretty amazing.
01:08:41.282 - 01:08:55.034, Speaker A: Santiagony. Santiago. This is on super rare. And did we see this work? I'm not sure. We may have, but I don't really remember it. Quite cool. This went for half an eth.
01:08:55.034 - 01:09:08.420, Speaker A: Beautiful. $1,700 minted on. So super rare. Super rare. So super rare is back. Santiago, selling for half an eth here. Nice work.
01:09:08.420 - 01:09:41.120, Speaker A: Very cool. We were discussing Ripcache doing all these iterations, Santiago putting this out kind of like a nice black and white version. It's like an iteration of a previous work or a work that's unreleased. Very cool. Here is Olivera Derdovik, sentinel superstars I believe AI endpainting. Very original use of aih here as we go into the physicals. Shomio take very edgy work here as you see in this painting.
01:09:41.120 - 01:10:03.074, Speaker A: And again using kind of airbrush and spray paint. Very wild work from it's not gallery posted Boba chic Metea we've looked at a ton of this person's work and now we're seeing some of the elements just kind of deconstructed. But this is 2018. Interestingly beautiful. I love this piece. It's from 2019. Some of my favorite works of this artist.
01:10:03.074 - 01:10:24.166, Speaker A: This is beautiful. Didn't realize these were so early. And here's Gregoria Zanardi oil paint and it looks like the hunter S. Thompson is what it looks like there. Beautiful portrait, isn't it? Nice oil painting. You could almost stop there. And speaking of stopping, this video is gonna glitch out soon if I don't stop it.
01:10:24.166 - 01:10:42.238, Speaker A: Noah Verrier my oil painting of champagne in a cup of noodles. Very contemporary looking. And here's die with the most likes. Feed on the phone. All influencers become one, so they're feeding here. And finally, David Arhils still needs a title, watercolor and ink. 2024.
01:10:42.238 - 01:10:55.818, Speaker A: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. And here is Filippo Francocci, my first self portrait. Very nice Filippo. Very cool. Physical work. That's your show, my friends. Thank you for joining me and until next time.
01:10:55.818 - 01:10:58.410, Speaker A: Time when the show shall be shorter. Take care.
