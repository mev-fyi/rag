00:00:01.720 - 00:00:13.750, Speaker A: Hi, guys. Welcome to the artist journal. My name is Adrian Pocabelli. You are always. I always appreciate you all coming. Thanks for the comments in the last videos. We're gonna have more info on nfts coming up.
00:00:13.750 - 00:00:40.732, Speaker A: Very interesting discussions on copyright. I was telling people about nfTs, a couple of artists friends, and how they probably need an NFT strategy. And they're bringing up really interesting issues about copyright, which I'm gonna get into. I mean, not this episode, but the next one. So anyways, appreciate the love, smash the like. And I want to talk about this painting here today. I woke up with this painting in my head at midnight last night.
00:00:40.732 - 00:01:12.014, Speaker A: And I've known about this painting for 20 years, and I hadn't thought about this painting for a long time. Like, it's one of those things I haven't, you know, consciously thought about. So it was very remarkable in that sense that it kind of was. Appeared in my head and was so just front and center. So I just wanted to talk about this work by Max Ernst. And it's part of a series of apparently twelve paintings that he did called the entire city. And they're all kind of variations on this theme of a sky.
00:01:12.014 - 00:01:59.858, Speaker A: Some sort of circular disk is usually in the sky, either a sun or a moon. Then there's the city, and then you have this kind of jungle or foliage like plant matter at the forefront of the painting. And what was interesting about waking up with this was the epiphany that I had of what it was about and what I determined. And, you know, I don't know if this is what Ernst was getting at, and we'll try and find some more official interpretations. But for me, it was actually very simple. Again, Ernst is a surrealist who I actually studied quite in depth when I did my master's thesis on JG Ballard's atrocity exhibition, which is a very important surrealist novel. At least important for that tradition.
00:01:59.858 - 00:02:34.796, Speaker A: Important for some people. Anyway, this painting, I'll give you my interpretation, which is very simple. The sun is consciousness and the city is our rational mind. It's the ego, it's order, it's law. Nomos, the greek word. And underneath you have the foliage over here. And this is the unconscious upon which the ego rests.
00:02:34.796 - 00:03:01.934, Speaker A: And so this is the, you know, kind of the very dense jungle matter of the unconscious. And you see there's almost like some menacing shapes in here. So it's always ambiguous, the unconscious. There's a violent side to it, you see over here. So it's not all it's life and growth. But it's also. There's kind of a latent violence in the jungle there.
00:03:01.934 - 00:04:03.030, Speaker A: But the key was the sun that I woke up with, and this omnipresent, dominant sun of consciousness. And without this consciousness, none of the city or the jungle are possible. And so what really amazed me, the epiphany, so to speak, that I had as I was waking up, was just how simple this is. It's radically simple. I mean, I was thinking to myself this morning, I wrote a little post on this. I go into detail on it, on my medium, in a medium post. And I basically say this is the kind of painting that an alien could potentially look at and relate to because they're growing up with the same elements, likely, at least, the sun in the sky, wherever they come from, there is probably a sun in the sky.
00:04:03.030 - 00:04:46.336, Speaker A: And to me, what was so kind of shockingly universal about this piece is all conscious life has been accompanied, basically, with these elements, particularly the sun, the sun in particular. Maybe not all conscious life has been accompanied by city. All conscious life has been accompanied by jungle, likely. I mean, or at least very close. So all to say to me, this is really. It's just like it couldn't be a more bare bones summary, our situation. And that was the epiphany that was kind of the artist journal development of the last day.
00:04:46.336 - 00:05:10.644, Speaker A: So I just want to take us through a few more from the series. So this is also here. I'll just reduce the size of me, so I'm not. There we go. So this is also from that series. So you see here, the disc almost looks like a moon. The city is more blotched out, and the jungle is almost removed.
00:05:10.644 - 00:05:33.402, Speaker A: So there are variations on this theme. Here's another one with a very big sun, almost a moon, though you see the ambiguity. It's just the disk in the sky. Again, these are the visual ingredients of our consciousness. Right. And I think that's what Ernst is getting at here. We'll look at the more official interpretation.
00:05:33.402 - 00:06:15.074, Speaker A: But I think, like, again, he was a surrealist. He was concerned with the unconscious, you know, the furniture of our consciousness, so to speak. What are the elements we all share? And looking at those elements and analyzing, recontextualizing those elements. So here we have a moon, sun in the sky, a disk, and again, the city with some foliage in the foreground. The foliage is a little less menacing here. Now, here's an interesting one where the sun or the disk in the sky. And again, this green sky, it's a bit more menacing.
00:06:15.074 - 00:06:57.340, Speaker A: It's from behind. It's still lighting the landscape, but it's not directly lighting. It's more just like this aura or presence hiding behind the hill. And again, a more kind of lazy foliage here in the foreground. And a bit more developed of a city. This almost looks like a greek city. Again, it looks like ancient Athens, almost especially here, is that a Parthenon type structure, these columns, again, reinforcing this kind of rational order interpretation law that I was going for, that I was expressing in the first image.
00:06:57.340 - 00:07:21.210, Speaker A: And here's another one. And so here's like a gray sky with a blue disc. So you see he's playing with these elements and he's just doing variations on a theme. And you see variations on the city. Again, this is more the blocky city with these big sort of triangle diamond shapes. And again, the foliage is almost removed. Bigger sky in this case.
00:07:21.210 - 00:08:00.164, Speaker A: So you see, he's playing with these extremely simple elements and he is doing variations because there's so much to work with here. So I just, before we go, and here's Google images, you can sort of see now, what's interesting about Google images, and I've made series based on these, is that I call related images, which is, you know, this is the same painting here. This is brighter, this is darker. So the representation of art, this is actually the same painting here, this top and this bottom one. But anyways, you can see the different variations. Here's something like, you see, he's playing with these elements. And this is a much earlier painting here.
00:08:00.164 - 00:08:30.054, Speaker A: Not sure. Some of these aren't even by Max Ernst. This is definitely by Max Ernst. So, just to give you a taste of what's out there on Google images, when you put Max Ernst entire City series. And finally, let's just look at the Tate now. So the Tate has one of the images there, and they say the entire city is painted in 1934. And this one here is an oil painting on paper mounted on canvas.
00:08:30.054 - 00:09:48.118, Speaker A: And right below here, it says the entire city is part of a series of around twelve paintings on the same theme that Ernst made between 1933 and 1937. The two final works in the series, made in 1935 to 1937, also entitled the entire city, are larger in scale than the earlier versions, measuring 97 cm by 160, other 97 by 146 cm. Both these versions have a large expanse of sky that covers one half the canvas, in contrast to the earlier paintings, where the sky forms about one quarter of the overall composition. Ernst recollected in 1953 that he painted the 1934 version of the entire city this one here, owned by the Tate, in the studio of the british surrealist painter Roland Penrose at the Chateau de Puys in the south of France, where he was being hosted at that time as an exile from his native Germany. So the Tate sort of puts a bit of a political spin on it, which is quite possible. And it talks a little bit about the technique that Ernst was using. Again, this gratage is what they call it.
00:09:48.118 - 00:10:33.734, Speaker A: He's using, actually, the spine of a fish to get some of these shapes, apparently working with randomness and then editing the randomness. So a technique that I have also adopted, one of my favorite techniques is you employ randomness and you edit it. So, all to say, I just wanted to highlight this little series because it's quite profound, I think. And I actually think my interpretation is probably more accurate than the Tate's here. The Tate doesn't go too much in detail, though, to be fair. But that's all I want to say. So just want to do an update on thoughts on Max Ernst's entire City series.
00:10:33.734 - 00:10:34.514, Speaker A: Thank you.
