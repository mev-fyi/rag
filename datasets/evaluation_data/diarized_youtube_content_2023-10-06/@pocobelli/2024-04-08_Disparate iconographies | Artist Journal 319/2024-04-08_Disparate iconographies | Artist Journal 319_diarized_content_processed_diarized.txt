00:00:03.560 - 00:00:31.526, Speaker A: All right, let's do this. A hard deadline. I think in 45 minutes, maybe we call it a soft deadline. If I'm not totally positive. Let's see how far we can get, how quickly as we continue to journey forward in our journey towards the sun, towards the light, this landscape, again, blinding my eyes as I look forward here in Germany. You call this a hoth? Kind of like the inner area of the apartment, where there's a little place to put your bikes and everything. Anyways, welcome back.
00:00:31.526 - 00:00:54.886, Speaker A: Artistry. April 8, 2024. Broadcasting from the inner half of the nervous system. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back. A wonderful weekend of art as you're going to see here, and lots of great experimentation. Again, the ship continues to move forward. Interestingly, this isn't a ship that's kind of anchored forever at the same island, not going anywhere.
00:00:54.886 - 00:01:37.404, Speaker A: And I'd argue it works like this by element. Lee, an artist that many of us are familiar with, this experimental pixel artist, for lack of a better term, and I think self declared. We'll check the twitter in a second. I think, you know, and using a phone, I'd say primarily, you know, again, I think on the object, it said, you know, experimental pixel artist using a smartphone. But the reason I say primarily is because we've seen a ton of laser engravings on cardboard of some of this pixel artwork. And can't you almost already just, you know, my brain is drooling, wondering what this would look like on cardboard. And, again, kind of.
00:01:37.404 - 00:01:58.192, Speaker A: You could also screen print this again, and. But the laser engraving, this might work particularly well. And it's only got, like, three colors. You have your background color of, like, this white, gray. Can't tell if that's white or a light gray. And then you have a black, and then you have, like, an orange red. Very simple in terms of the color.
00:01:58.192 - 00:02:23.988, Speaker A: And so, again, something you could render physically without too much work. And I'd say a rezo probably wouldn't work too well. Debatable in the sense that the rezo might not get you this kind of hard edge, because I think it uses. It's like a photocopier, so it's a little kind of rougher along the edges. So maybe all this kind. Kind of. Of subtlety in what this seems like a sleigh going through the sky.
00:02:23.988 - 00:02:55.558, Speaker A: Maybe this is us, you know, with this fish. These fish, excuse me, these fish leading this almost what seems like a japanese type fan in the background. Not even sure what the references are here. There's a bell on the top right, what seems like clouds with this beautiful pixelation here. And you know what's interesting? It seems like, I call this the four to the floor pixelation. It's a really nice kind of. Or dithering for the floor dithering.
00:02:55.558 - 00:03:25.496, Speaker A: It's this kind of checkerboard dithering. It seems like, I was going to say it seems like element ly primarily uses the kind of four to the floor dithering. Interestingly, again, this checkerboard pattern. Now, this is, of course, juxtaposed. This is a theme that I was. I'm very enthusiastic about. Again, this is what I was doing in the peloponnesian war series, which we might actually see a work which appeared in this interview from one of one.
00:03:25.496 - 00:04:12.688, Speaker A: But before we get there, it was this idea of the war of all iconography against all iconography. And here, this is kind of like a juxtaposition that I relish in here. This midi notation is being juxtaposed with this pixelation, this pixel art. And it kind of works right? And it starts to become, again, forgetting all your preconceptions of what art is supposed to be and what it's supposed to look like in a gallery. This starts to become an interesting visual experiment, juxtaposing, you know, different kinds of media and as element Lee says here, or different kinds of iconography, I suppose we would say, let's actually see what element Li says. A little night music. Ein kleine nacht musik.
00:04:12.688 - 00:04:30.200, Speaker A: Referring to Mozart visualization. Drawing of my bad remix of Mozart's music. Part of a homework for my uni audio class. Details and comments. And I actually brought this up. Let's actually take a quick look. So cool, you know, always being original here.
00:04:30.200 - 00:05:09.768, Speaker A: Let's link to a Google Doc. In this remix, I turned Mozart's ein kleinnachtmusik to Midi, which of course, is. What is it? Music instrument digital interface. So of course, this is the programming that you'd use for synthesizers to our earlier discussion. And use several audio synthesizers and effects to make it sound like ancient oriental temple music. You know, this is very interesting, too, just taking midi files from a music perspective and just punching them in and then changing the synth, the sound, the patch. And all of a sudden, maybe this sounds like something completely different.
00:05:09.768 - 00:05:32.746, Speaker A: I had also made a dry note of the music shown below. Mini tracks are so beautiful and so visualized by themselves already. So I combined them together and added some mythical beans. The midi notes look like waves on a river or rolling mountains. So again, and here it kind of looks like the. Almost the sun reflecting to a certain degree on this water here. So.
00:05:32.746 - 00:06:14.284, Speaker A: And you gotta love this, too, the font there. So just a really cool work. Again, showing the sophistication, I'd argue, of what's going on here. When you forget about all, everything you've been told and you just look at this, you say, this is interesting. This is very interesting, at least for me. So very cool work here from element ly to get us started on a new week. And big shout out and thank you to one of one who put out this really large, awesome interview with me that we did maybe about a month ago, maybe even six weeks ago.
00:06:14.284 - 00:06:32.236, Speaker A: It is a written interview. I thought the headline was hilarious. So this is on their substack. So if you are wondering, it is one of one art, substack.com, if you can see that, and just one of one art written out. And you can also see it on my Twitter feed. I linked to this.
00:06:32.236 - 00:06:51.324, Speaker A: I thought the headline was hilarious. To refine results, raid the classics. Pretty hilarious. So just a really nice interview here with. Yeah, so. And here's what I'm talking about, actually. So it's kind of fitting, because here I have kind of, like, mathematical equations.
00:06:51.324 - 00:07:23.748, Speaker A: I'm not even sure where these squares came from. And this might even be from, you know, you see there, like, this might even be from, like, I was using quantum physics diagrams that I would sample from. And then I juxtapose it with this greek imagery, and then you'd see numbers put upside down. So kind of a similar idea here. There you have some, you know, again, this looks like math formulas juxtaposed. So just juxtaposing everything here with the greek imagery and then done on a phone. So kind of a.
00:07:23.748 - 00:07:44.672, Speaker A: You know, in a certain way, these works are thematically similar with the element li. Interestingly so that is from the peloponnesian war series. So I'll just say a really nice profile here. Look at it. I think one of. One of the guys from. One of one was saying this was the most words and images that they'd done so far in one interview.
00:07:44.672 - 00:08:01.112, Speaker A: So it's very. It's tempting to call it comprehensive here. So, again, just massive shout out and thanks for putting this all together. This is a lot of work. Of course, there's an early phone work. I was really proud of that one. And so just a ton of work here.
00:08:01.112 - 00:08:17.102, Speaker A: Yeah. So look at. Look at how huge this is. So you gotta love it. You gotta love it. So you can't ask for anything more as an artist when people are putting together a profile and interview. So again, just massive shout out.
00:08:17.102 - 00:08:59.004, Speaker A: Give them a follow on Twitter. Again, you can find I retweeted it on my account and I'll put out another tweet again just from myself. Coming up, I'm very thrilled to announce John Cates is going to be on the show, of course, like OG crypto artist or, sorry, og glitch artist. Look at that from the nineties. And I can't, I can't wait to have this discussion because of course I remember, you know, nineties, maybe early two thousands, very late nineties, where I had a couple of friends who were kind of into glitch. Like, it's nothing in a sense. It was nothing new for me to hear, you know, when in the crypto scene.
00:08:59.004 - 00:09:35.564, Speaker A: So I'm just very, very curious to hear John Cates story and it should be really interesting. And again, one of my favorite pieces is that horse that John gave me. Just such an original glitch work and pioneer of the glitch western genre. So join Rune Toon and I in the saloon with John Cates for good times and great conversation that is this Wednesday. So I am thrilled about that. Just quickly on the comments here, human boy on last show, the title had me a bit worried. Of course, the title was taking a step back.
00:09:35.564 - 00:09:53.212, Speaker A: I meant getting perspective, but I thought about that later. Good point. But it is very nice to take a step back and get a new perspective on things. Exactly. And the work you shared is AI edited in gimp for color and texture. So the human boy work that we saw was AI edited in gimp. Thank you for sharing in.
00:09:53.212 - 00:10:01.084, Speaker A: Great episode. You're welcome. And thank you for that information, human boy. Always appreciate the comments. John Cates. Repetition is raw power. Agreed.
00:10:01.084 - 00:10:22.644, Speaker A: Yes. It is a blunt instrument. Repetition is a blunt instrument. It's sort of like that whole propaganda line. If you, you know, say it enough times, people will believe it. Right? Something to that effect. It is incredibly powerful repetition, isn't it? So, yeah, very interesting.
00:10:22.644 - 00:10:58.526, Speaker A: John Cates also bonne comme le quincontre for tweet surine table de dissection d'une machine accoutre et dune parapluies. I don't know if I've ever read the French Vermont, also known as isidore ducasse. Of course, this is the inspiring line. You know, the beautiful meeting of a fortuitous meeting of a sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table. You know, you could. If surrealism had an axiom, it is two opposite realities in a new context. And it was.
00:10:58.526 - 00:11:23.842, Speaker A: That axiom was inspired by this line, one could argue. If not, yeah, it's pretty, you know, commonly thought of to be inspired by that. Comment by the great Armand. I actually have read Le Chand de Maldour in English when I was about 23, 24. I thought it was good. I thought I had to read it in order to write about Ballard properly. JG Ballard.
00:11:23.842 - 00:11:39.264, Speaker A: For the master's thesis, I felt like I needed to know the primary documents of surrealism. So all to say this is. It was pretty mind blowing. At times it was difficult. At other times, I tried picking it up. I think I actually have it here. Do I have it here? I do.
00:11:39.264 - 00:12:17.334, Speaker A: I tried picking it up recently and it was more difficult than I thought. Right. So all to say, very important. And just finally on this point, a little trivia, I think it might be in the introduction of this book, I can't remember, but apparently, and this is super interesting, apparently, Isidore. Isidore Ducasse would have a piano, and he wrote this all when he was like 23 or something, by the way, he would have a piano and he'd play the piano and then the music would inspire him to say things, right? And so the music would inspire him. He'd just hit some keys. Right.
00:12:17.334 - 00:12:55.802, Speaker A: So just very interesting in terms of process. And when you consider how important, you know, again, this was considered the Bible, sometimes called the Bible of surrealism, you know, Magritte, hugely a very literary painter, hugely influenced by Lotre Amend and just the. And the whole dark humor also. So just a profoundly important artist and just kind of a one off there. Of course, in France, maybe it was Paris, not sure, but a French, you know, so not too far from the intellectuals there in France. Fascinating. John Cates.
00:12:55.802 - 00:13:11.186, Speaker A: This is an important connection, embracing a rational and following the flamingo. Indeed, indeed. We've got to follow the flamingo. One could argue Pokebelly is the web3. Jeff Goldblum. You know, not the first time I've heard the comparison, as you can imagine. Thank you, Derek and Ugo.
00:13:11.186 - 00:13:52.314, Speaker A: Graphics two and deluxe paint are similar, so the final render is the same. I think. It's difficult to know which software it is when it's not noticed. Thanks for the highlight of my new series. It's interesting, I sometimes get the sense of graphics two just a tiny bit. But that's really interesting because I've actually never used graphics two. But there is an artist whose name escapes me, that I haven't seen from, for a while on object, who used to use graphics two as just a slightly different quality, but it's very similar, especially, I think when you get to the cycling gradients also, and so not exactly sure what this means.
00:13:52.314 - 00:14:21.676, Speaker A: So anyways, hilarious comment here, and John Cates are glitches of self transforming machine elves. Well, that's what I'm going to ask you, John. Maybe I'll open with that question on Wednesday, so maybe be prepared for an answer on that one. Also, thank you for the comments on X. Hygiene said. Great to hear from you and Argyle. I was really hoping my newest piece would be included this week just because I loved hearing you call my last piece manic pixel art indeed has a nice ring to it.
00:14:21.676 - 00:14:49.058, Speaker A: Regardless, thanks for what you're doing. You're welcome. Yes, I'm trying to accumulate and sometimes I just miss again, I call it a waterfall where I just put out my hand so it's hard to get. You can't get everything. Even when I was trying to get everything, you still miss stuff and you spend half your day. So all to say we're on a clock here, but all to say thank you for the comment, Argyle, and I appreciate that. And again, feel free to post in the community as well if you guys want to.
00:14:49.058 - 00:15:27.364, Speaker A: In cases like this, if you want to be included in the show, be very succinct. Binuel was a very important spanish filmmaker who did films in Spain, Mexico and France. Very influential as a surrealist filmmaker, but also doing works that have a neorealist tint like Los Olvidados or Viri Diana, but are still very much of his own style of film. Very interesting. Yeah, film is one of my weak spots to a certain degree. I don't really watch much, many movies, just I always feel like there's a lot of time that's involved and I'm always trying to get so much done that it's hard for me to watch movies. But I do every once in a while.
00:15:27.364 - 00:15:50.520, Speaker A: Dune two was mind blowing. Even Steven Spielberg, who I'm not really a huge fan of Steven Spielberg, was saying this is one of the greatest Sci-Fi movies ever, but to hear him say that is quite something. So anyways, thank you for the info. Be great to hear from you, Zozo, thanks a lot. I'm glad you mentioned repetition, another reference to repetition. It's very important in my work. I think it's very powerful as it is in mantras or Krautrock.
00:15:50.520 - 00:16:33.672, Speaker A: Awesome. I guess Zozo listens to Krautrock, who is an example of Krautrock it's been so long. What is the name? What is the name? Oh, it's been a while. Of course, Ino and Bowie were thought to have kind of borrowed heavily, let's say, from Krautrock in the trilogy that they did on the late seventies. And I think there was a little bit of, just a touch of bitterness from some of the Krautrock people. Now, King Crimson was later, but there's a band I'm thinking of that's on the top tip of my tongue. That was kinda.
00:16:33.672 - 00:16:45.736, Speaker A: Yeah. Anyways, I try to make each piece to be seen in a loop. And you're right about haiku's having three lines. Maybe the third line is my. In my haiku is the video. Yeah. Hilarious and really cool work, Alex.
00:16:45.736 - 00:17:02.224, Speaker A: Thank you for including my work. My pleasure. Great to hear from you. Filippo Francocci. Thank you so much for featuring my work again on your show, Adrian. I wanted to mention that Krita is a fantastic free open source painting and 2d animation program that I've been using for some time. I've been hearing about Krita also.
00:17:02.224 - 00:17:44.516, Speaker A: Thanks for sharing Brian Tracy's audiobooks. I'll definitely look them up as I'd like to improve my public speaking skills, especially when discussing my art. Yeah, I consider Brian Tracy this is very important public speaking, as I was discussing last time, Brian Tracy, you know, it's all just, I call him, you know, just a great practical philosopher. It used to be a thing like, as far as there's practical ethics and there's theoretical ethics, say, in the nicomachean ethics of Aristotle, just briefly here. And practical ethics, it used to be something. I guess it is. I've asked people, I guess it is taught once in a while, but it's kind of a bit of a lost art, which is basically the sense of how to act.
00:17:44.516 - 00:18:11.562, Speaker A: Sometimes it gets turned into religious class, but then for those that are non religious, usually it's practical ethics. Anyways, for those that just want to get, you know, better at just kind of being in the world, this is one not everybody loves. Brian Tracy. I have friends that recoil at Brian Tracy, but I'm a big fan, actually, of Brian Tracy. And I just find it helpful. So well worth checking out. There are some good ones on public speaking and just life in general.
00:18:11.562 - 00:18:27.854, Speaker A: Lips in black. Great to hear. I am going to watch you all drinking coffee. Great to hear from you, Kalo. Awesome to hear from you. Let's just put a big, a big heart for Kalo. And there we'll put the burning heart for Kalo there.
00:18:27.854 - 00:18:35.694, Speaker A: Great to hear from you, Kalo. Awesome. Lily illo. Love all these sparkling neurons. Awesome. Yes. John Gates are glitches, the self transforming machine elves.
00:18:35.694 - 00:18:47.962, Speaker A: Okay, good. And here we have the comments we just saw. Thank you, John Gates. Can't wait. I think John's excited about the show. I am very excited about that show on Wednesday. So looking forward to that dropkick pop.
00:18:47.962 - 00:18:59.602, Speaker A: Awesome. Thanks to hear from you. Nice to hear from you. So continuing on as we rush through this show, just a few people in the community here. This was interesting. And we just got a new piece. Look at this.
00:18:59.602 - 00:19:14.650, Speaker A: Just more interesting work here. This is on exchange art in Apejo. Very cool drawings. And actually this is in the show. So we'll look at this work by Ruslan Vialtzev later in the show. Skull takes bosque. Gracias.
00:19:14.650 - 00:19:33.738, Speaker A: Is going to be in Berlin, Portugal, Spain, Italy and Berlin. So they're going on the road from May to July. That sounds incredible. So I'll just say xfollow ninja. Thank you for posting and everything. And we have some unbelievable works by Kiro this episode. A free mint too on Zora.
00:19:33.738 - 00:20:01.478, Speaker A: There are some great works, so we're going to come back to those later in the show. And Oknarts, thank you. And ugodigi and everybody, thank you for posting. So one of the works in graphics, too, and also Zani Yegar and everyone. So thank you, everybody. And here's August ground with some interesting pieces here. And we're gonna look at this gorgeous curo here later in the show.
00:20:01.478 - 00:20:20.956, Speaker A: So thank you, everybody, for posting here. We're having a ton of fun over here, aren't we? And actually we're going to look at this Luke 500 post in a second. And here is August grounds work. And I still am going to reach out to you, August. So here, all to say, just an interesting. So this is the work that was posted. And this is an edition of five.
00:20:20.956 - 00:20:51.194, Speaker A: And they are 25 tezos, each three available. Zach, continuing on our little news segment here, Zora has built in Ar. Zora has a built in AR viewer, augmented reality viewer. So your GLB's work in spatial computing, look at this arzora with apple vision Pro. And look at how convincing this looks. This is like the recording, I guess, from this person that's wearing the apple vision pro. Pretty wild, isn't it? Virtual sculpture.
00:20:51.194 - 00:21:24.286, Speaker A: That's pretty freaky. So I've never tried one of these out, but it's looking pretty interesting. Max Papacy, sometimes known as Max capacity. I just unfollowed object one because they're not even following me, let alone listing my work. Who are they even for? It's always been attention, actually. And Kika replied, because, of course, Kika Nikolayla and shout out to Kika is the curator. I don't know if she's the curator, but she kind of runs, as far as I understand, or helps run.
00:21:24.286 - 00:21:45.802, Speaker A: Object one is saying, we have a social media person. We'll hopefully have a social media person soon. And it's based on the curation. We also curate program, write curatorial, text, interview artists. So they're doing a lot of things. But I thought this was actually the takeaway here. Max Pabsti, I'm not taking it personally, and it's not your fault or kablan.
00:21:45.802 - 00:22:41.206, Speaker A: I love you guys, but the whole nature of exclusive curation is going to be adversarial no matter how hard anyone works at it. And I guess what I'm highlighting here is the ongoing tension, I would say, with the object one platform, because the beauty of object and of Tezos was its openness and that there was no gatekeeper. Like, really what Hen did was when, like, people forget in 2021 when all of the trad artists were trying to get into crypto there, they didn't know where to go, and there was, all of the platforms were gated, even foundation. You had to have an invite, and, like, it wasn't easy to get in. And so some people would just mint on OpenSea, I think Justin Aversano, the photographer, ended up minting on Opensea, if I'm not mistaken. So it wasn't easy. So hen kind of broke the mold by allowing things to be open.
00:22:41.206 - 00:23:22.158, Speaker A: So I've always found it a bit of attention to object one, because I always wondered to myself, like, it just brings back up the issue. Like, I don't know why they don't just make it an open platform for where it just aggregates all the one of ones. And then you put the curated part over top, like you would, and so, and then, but I think people would use it more because now it's sort of like, yeah, there's always this kind of adversarial thing. It's like, well, they're not, they've never invited, you know, my art to be on, you know, and it's kind of. So it kind of goes counter to the ethos. I kind of agree, and I don't think Max capacity is being bitter here. I just, I kind of agree with the sentiment.
00:23:22.158 - 00:23:43.254, Speaker A: So I just think it's interesting and shout out to everybody. K. Blaine, Kika and Max, all in. Good discussion here, Eric. I've never had. I thought this was interesting, and this is more relating to just like NFT PFP projects, but I thought it was interesting. I've never had any less of an interest in buying ETH nfts than I do now.
00:23:43.254 - 00:24:22.942, Speaker A: A big reason ETH founders have been asking to let them cook for three years. And it seems none can produce anything other than some partnership or a low tier event. Because, of course, a lot of these PFP projects and kind of NFT projects, it's all about kind of promising something that basically never, like, comes right, because the economics, it's all about you mint, you get exclusive access, but to what, at the end of the day, more mints and then you dilute and everything. So. And also any flex it had is completely gone. And I guess the big picture, you know, taking a step back, so to speak, on this, is we're seeing the effects of time. This is what time does.
00:24:22.942 - 00:24:51.626, Speaker A: It's like, it seemed like such a great idea three years ago, and now these projects, a lot of them are down like 80 or 90%. And so it's just interesting. Like, this is time at work, you know, doing its thing. Neutro, this is great. I don't speak Spanish, but if you do, you can see Flora Marquez very long interview here by Neutro, by neutro arts. And they actually have a YouTube channel. Interview with artist number six is now available, along with Flora Marquez.
00:24:51.626 - 00:25:36.810, Speaker A: You can watch it on a delayed basis, wherever, whenever you want, and learn about Flora's history and journey as an artist on the blockchain. So how cool is that? So check that out, Luke, 500. Just on this very interesting thread here, a brief thread of what I believe is one of the best case studies about institutional adoption of the blockchain technology and NFTs and digital assets, those dirty things that are dying every day, according to the media. A 10,000 collection, a ten k collection, a collection of 10,000 works by the Belvedere Museum, which, of course, is one of the most significant museums in the world, located in Vienna, Austria. I've never actually been to the Belvedere. I've never been to Vienna, but I'm pretty close over here in Berlin. So maybe I'll do that.
00:25:36.810 - 00:26:05.556, Speaker A: So just quickly, because it's one of the themes we're very interested in here is the institutional side of things, and I really need to speed up here. But at the beginning of 2022, the austrian museum decided to venture into the craze of the metaverse. Meta it was during the COVID era. And the digital assets were proven to generate new revenue streams. A perfect chance for the mission to innovate in this space. So the rest is history, but also still present. They created 10,000 tiles, each one capturing a precise coordinate of this 120 year old masterpiece.
00:26:05.556 - 00:26:45.562, Speaker A: They sold 3000 of them, generating $4 million in euros in revenue. There's still 7000 to go. So all to say. So here was the museum entering into NFts by dividing up a painting this famous, you know, is that the kiss by Klimt? And then there's, you know, raffles associated, and then there's this beautiful ordinal. Interestingly so here's the alpha here. Last February, to celebrate Valentine's Day, they dropped a 10,000 generative art collection on the ordinals protocol. I believe they are the first traditional institution to bet on art on bitcoin.
00:26:45.562 - 00:27:10.954, Speaker A: And so they put this, and I think they gave like a whitelist or did a free mint for people that owned this NfT kiss. Exactly. It was given away for free to kiss NfT holders. So just interesting, isn't it, to see how institutions are coming in. Kelowna contemporary headed upstate with deltasauce. Pretty cool to see the process in person. So deltasauce, of course, making a lot of AI art.
00:27:10.954 - 00:27:33.562, Speaker A: And here, let me just. So here you see what seems to be. I think it's art matter, actually. And you see the texture underneath and then the inkjet over top. It's kind of hard to see the texture here, but. And then here is the finished result. Of course, you see this kind of painterly texture, so you see the process in motion.
00:27:33.562 - 00:28:03.724, Speaker A: And there's a delta sauce looking like a painting. Interestingly, here's Jake's studio is also some process here. So seeing the wizard at work, this interesting, surreal illustrator and all of the interesting. Let me speed through it a little bit here. All of the changes along the way. So you see all of the work. And I love those letters in the shoes or the boots.
00:28:03.724 - 00:28:32.374, Speaker A: So the chair disappears, interestingly. So very cool to see that at work. The process at work. Here's Lorna Mills on the side of a building curated by Robert Seidelcombe de moi. Two. So one of Lorna Mills works, combining several of her, of these gifts, which is actually what she was telling me she used to do, and then these works that are just one of these gifts was kind of a result. That's what came out in the Twitter space that we did.
00:28:32.374 - 00:29:00.290, Speaker A: Or the x space that was a result of the NFTs. I asked her if Nfts changed her art. She said, well, sometimes I just do one of these gifts now, and I think we'll see one today. Santiago Ruao works from the residency. We're shown in Times Square, so the world gets smaller. Thanks, flexosaurus rex and bosque gratias, for generating such an amazing experience. So there is Santiago Ruau, who will see some work from this episode on in Times Square.
00:29:00.290 - 00:29:25.686, Speaker A: So that is pretty cool. And here's Andre Butzer. This is in Florence, so almost looking like in a church or something here. So, of course, many of you are familiar with Andre Butzer's work and taking up an entire wall. Just a cool display there. I thought that first image in particular was an interesting juxtaposition. And here is a ratta, a classic rata from, I think, 2021 in.
00:29:25.686 - 00:29:41.634, Speaker A: I think it's called the degenaisance in a. One of these beautiful frames. I just saw this in a storefront, actually, yesterday, so these are getting more popular. This one in particular, I'm starting to see. Look at that. That looks great, too. Continuing on, so into the work we go.
00:29:41.634 - 00:30:13.148, Speaker A: Gorgeous canvas here by Ed Morolla of this. Just a beautiful, grand, sweeping canvas. And here, this figure riding like a massive, you know, iguana or something, and a tree and just beautiful river and sky. Doesn't need to matter what it is, you know, I'm working on this Dante pixel art. I think I add a lot while I'm working on it because you just see the freedom of it and of not worrying. Just make your drawing. And it's very liberating.
00:30:13.148 - 00:30:24.010, Speaker A: I'm very close to being done it. And there's a classic ed Marolla vase. And there's that nice little frame. Very nice. Gorgeous color. Here's one from. Here's one from cedar plank.
00:30:24.010 - 00:30:46.554, Speaker A: And I'm not even sure which, which blockchain this was put on, but one of these. Awesome. Another awesome. This looks like Fantavision. Just another great piece. A little bit of illustration here from waffles, also known as cedar plank. So cool work there.
00:30:46.554 - 00:30:58.834, Speaker A: Just transferred. And here was another one, remote viewing. I think this was transferred to me, actually. In fact. Thank you. Waffles, transferred five days ago. Of course, remote viewing was a hilarious.
00:30:58.834 - 00:31:25.554, Speaker A: I almost want to call it a meme. That was on coast to coast am. Art Bell, one of the great radio hosts of american talk radio, had a show from midnight to 04:00 a.m. Or midnight to 03:00 a.m. And remote viewers for people, these kind of people that could see into the future, but you just never quite knew how it worked. So all to say, more rad, rad artwork from Cedar plank. And here's one more.
00:31:25.554 - 00:32:02.604, Speaker A: Not even sure what's going on. Kind of looks like. Doesn't this look like one of those games you'd see on like cable tv with people trying to knock each other off of a column here? And there are the people watching. Just more classic work by Cedar Planck continued on popple with another monster here. This one is gobble GRD, red and blue. And just kind of moving pretty quickly, actually. And so another addition with this kind of operating system window as background.
00:32:02.604 - 00:32:17.886, Speaker A: And that is very cool. And look at this. Rinne fish on ordinals. What an exciting artwork this was. This is. And it's really cool. I am so delighted as I work on my two to four kilobyte files.
00:32:17.886 - 00:32:44.474, Speaker A: I think they're about 4 kb, let's say, in the ones I'm working on, which I hope to mint this week. I have to. The halving is coming, so you have to kind of mint while you can because it may get much more expensive, according to Nick from gamma. So use it as a deadline just to get work done. Look at how awesome this is though. So this is available for only $256. I mean, get a runny fish on ordinals, on bitcoin.
00:32:44.474 - 00:32:58.982, Speaker A: So this is on gamma. And look at how great this page looks. You know, for those that aren't on super rare, you can be on gamma. I think anybody can go on gamma. As far as I understand, anybody can mint. So I think so. Look at that.
00:32:58.982 - 00:33:17.154, Speaker A: So just very cool. I just delight in the small file size, in trying to make things small. I'm very curious to see how big this is. And here's Renee Fish's page. So they have a very nice site. I tell you, it looks like super rare. Looks like super rare's new site.
00:33:17.154 - 00:33:36.774, Speaker A: I wonder who came first. Interesting, interesting, interesting. You know, they're be very much. Gamma is very much becoming the super rare of ordinals. And I think it's a lot easier to get onto. Here is la Delmas with a beautiful work. Nice juxtaposition of pixelation with painting.
00:33:36.774 - 00:33:49.782, Speaker A: So interesting. Even some graffiti in the background. A beautiful work. 51 minted. Which is pretty good. So by la Delmas here on Zora. So very cool work here.
00:33:49.782 - 00:34:16.188, Speaker A: Involuntary thoughts. Great title. A very different kind of work from NUV 1914. Situation Hogar. So here we see just hanging out, having a fireside hangout here on the la z boy with a. On the chair with the books and everything. Kind of an interesting piece, isn't it? This sold for ten tazos.
00:34:16.188 - 00:34:46.144, Speaker A: And this was just listed yesterday. And here's another one, Mar. So I assume that's night and maybe the sea at night, and maybe people maybe night swimming in this great, great sky with these wild stars. So just more super interesting work from NUV 1914, also selling for eight tasos. Super prolific. Here's Pipi universal with some cool experimentation of boxing gloves. This is on Zora.
00:34:46.144 - 00:35:31.292, Speaker A: I brought it up here on x, just because you can make it bigger. So interesting subject and really interesting process here, where you see these kind of gradients mixing with really, with digital kind of mark making in a really interesting way. And these wild kind of gradients here that you often find in Photoshop. Here's real world data. And get closer, I think, I see here. And so another kind of metaphysical work, we're almost going back a little bit to the roots here with oxyn. Again, another very loose work here, interestingly, and it's almost like a meditation on subjectivity.
00:35:31.292 - 00:35:57.276, Speaker A: Here is your image of yourself. And there is a phone, seemingly, perhaps. And you have these lines here, this perspective and this beautifully rendered skull. Very beautiful, isn't it? So this is sold out at 22 tezos and edition of 22. Cool work there. And here is wasteman gold Minevich. We gotta run through the rest of this.
00:35:57.276 - 00:36:41.180, Speaker A: Le dejeuner sur le Simon. So playing off of primanese Dejeuner Solebe once again. And here we see a kind of a menacing looking figure with an axe here and people hanging out outside of a. Is this a McDonald's? It is a McDonald's, which is a jail. And again, the juxtaposition of this texture and non textured brush and this black sky with, again, what looks like the prison warden with the axe here, because we see another one, a guard of the McDonald's jail, and not even sure what's going on in the river there. So this is an addition of one for 123 tezos. On we go, Bezaya.
00:36:41.180 - 00:36:59.672, Speaker A: This is a burn to redeem preseason day ten. So if you burn the animals, you can get one of Bezaya's portraits here. This is on base seven, redeemed so far. Not able to maximize that, unfortunately. So. But cool work here. Classic bazaya portrait.
00:36:59.672 - 00:37:30.730, Speaker A: Again, sport references and some kind of like a cheetah coat and interesting background there. Kind of a bit of a print feel to it. Again, I think bizaya works mostly on the phone. Here's Santiago edition of one, seven trees seen from heaven mall edition of one. And let's see if we can get this loading another massive file here. So this, I think we saw it at 111 tezos. So another cool abstract, nice kind of creamy orange background color, 111 tezos.
00:37:30.730 - 00:38:07.074, Speaker A: And that's on object. Here's Santiago Ruao flowing in the constant movement of the time. This is on Zora. So cool work here. Another original composition using this brush, this kind of hard edged brush, as you see here, that we see often in San Diego's work here is Katarina create sunset ride. And this is sold out at one tazos, I think. And pretty cool, kind of different color work, different style of work, and a woman riding a bicycle.
00:38:07.074 - 00:38:37.670, Speaker A: Kind of a pink theme here through the grass. And interesting, different kind of clouds contrasting with the bottom area with the grass. Interesting. And here's another one by Kristin Roose, Paintworks gold. And so paintworks, I've never heard of paintworks gold. So isn't this interesting? So another work, paintworks gold for Apple IIg's. I remember that that was like the advanced Apple Iie and Activision 1987 edition of ten for ten tezos.
00:38:37.670 - 00:38:57.878, Speaker A: So the series continues. It's a ton of fun. Here's Mac paint 1.5. This is created in 1985. So you see like, Photoshop didn't invent this palette here. Interestingly so. And of course, Christian putting interesting greek, greek writing there on this building.
00:38:57.878 - 00:39:10.522, Speaker A: Wonder what that says. Interesting. Here's fossils. Gamma error test zero four. So more interesting experimentation. A lot of work coming out from Francois Gamma. This is an edition of 30 for three tazos.
00:39:10.522 - 00:39:32.854, Speaker A: I'd love to see a one of one from Francois Gamma. Braindead. Okie dokie. So more interesting. So this is braindead with some beautiful colors going on here, a pixel artwork. And it looks like almost like printer, inkjet kind of colors, hourglass, some file icons and everything. So almost looks like turntables to a certain degree.
00:39:32.854 - 00:39:51.114, Speaker A: 420 is the price and edition of 20. So still available. Mannadol and P one. So is there. No, there's no audio on this, so let me just maximize. And there is the cat. And look, they're doing skydiving.
00:39:51.114 - 00:40:09.174, Speaker A: So the pixel art cats are skydiving and they are taking with video along the way. And you gotta love it. So tons of fun. Edition of 30 and not listed unlisted. And here's Anis Abdin. Interesting piece from below the earth. Goufre de Padechac.
00:40:09.174 - 00:40:41.444, Speaker A: And again, we see this where there's the static version and the animated version, a common way of displaying gifs now, at least on Instagram. Here's Glitchtown arcade with another cool work, kind of more abstract, these works, which I'm really enjoying. And again, there's something about this margin which kind of helps out, too. So just cool, cool series here. My indecipherable thoughts. This is an edition of one for only 520. This is at auction, so that is cool.
00:40:41.444 - 00:41:03.006, Speaker A: Here is Silva sand twos and another. This is on Zora and five minted so far. And this is called bungee Jump. So more Nintendo glitch rom here. And interesting piece. And here's Lorna Mills feral faucet. So we really have to run through this episode here.
00:41:03.006 - 00:41:28.810, Speaker A: So a very bright red and this faucet that is kind of like a toy where you can wash your hands. So just more interesting work from Lorna Mills, who we saw there at the start of the program on the side of the building. Edition of 30 for 20 tezos. And they are going three gone so far. Here is Sean Luke. Rainy days with a gorgeous work. So continuing this series with the frame and the gifts, cycling through it.
00:41:28.810 - 00:41:39.562, Speaker A: And almost looks like an umbrella. It is an umbrella. Rainy days. And these are going for 42 tezos. Amazing edition of nine. Sold out. So doing very well there.
00:41:39.562 - 00:42:02.762, Speaker A: $54 each. Beautiful work. Cybokat by guru, guru hyena. Interesting experimental work here. And, yeah, I mean, what is there to say? This is a gif. It's abstract, interesting repetition through here and different kinds of writing. Just kind of a wild work done with deluxe paint, too, interestingly, edition of five.
00:42:02.762 - 00:42:25.290, Speaker A: And it looks like it's sold out at 555 each. Nice work. Here is Ruslan, who we saw earlier and who we saw in the community there. So if you're looking for the link, look there. So cool work, cool shapes. Kind of a different kind of piece. Kind of looks like CGI combined with digital painting on chain freaks.
00:42:25.290 - 00:42:39.634, Speaker A: Four of a hundred minted so far. And people are sharing this. Enjoy. It's kind of like the degen token for Zora, I think. Sadbunny 40. Here is another interesting piece. This is by 2000, what I'm calling 2002 here.
00:42:39.634 - 00:42:59.478, Speaker A: More interesting experimental work combining pixel art and different kinds of textures. That is on Zora, eight minted. So it's not bad. I mean, we have to consider like eight minted is probably like $20. Not bad. And that's just getting started. This just got released here's renky with more work.
00:42:59.478 - 00:43:16.148, Speaker A: Now we're going with white and red. I think this is a one of one. So again, playing with light and simple forms. This is an edition of one and unlisted. And here is Rannic Steer. And here's Rannic Steer. Kind of looking like one of the series.
00:43:16.148 - 00:43:31.552, Speaker A: And again, another minimal work with a gorgeous gradient here. And great color. So nice and simple. And yeah, just very nice work there. A lot of retweets and likes. Couple from walk. Skunk.
00:43:31.552 - 00:43:49.816, Speaker A: This is a one of one. And again, you can still get one day. We may rue the day that we could have gotten a one of one from walk. And we never did for only here at 667. So, Dan control, getting in on the action. There's a bit of a bidding war here, so that is exciting. It'll be interesting to see.
00:43:49.816 - 00:44:13.724, Speaker A: I mean, maybe one day these will go for hundreds or thousands. Wouldn't that of be hilarious and fun and kind of not great? Like, we're seeing the auctions, we're getting three or four people. So walk and I liked how this one was a little different. This one was white. Right. And what's the sensei star is the name of this one. So walk continues to provoke in a very interesting way and get success with it.
00:44:13.724 - 00:44:34.144, Speaker A: Boat row. I thought this was an interesting piece, which could kind of hang well. It's kind of more just digital manipulation of what looks like a shipping. Massive shipping. Cargo, freight, cargo ship. As you see, these huge boxes of cargo on top. Really interesting treatment.
00:44:34.144 - 00:45:10.306, Speaker A: Here is Elie Lowe. A trash bag, a new one. And I think wild one. Wild, wild work. Ton of work put into this. VST instruments, hand paint and photo scan, textures, modeling, rigging, vhs and digital glitches, layering, genuine sadness. Hilarious.
00:45:10.306 - 00:45:28.464, Speaker A: Kind of. This is for 445 are gone. So there's probably just. I'm assume. Yeah, there's three left on primary. And here's this gorgeous work by DJ Kiro. This is on foundation, so this is on bass.
00:45:28.464 - 00:45:48.668, Speaker A: Let me just hit play here. This was beautiful. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. You know what else I love about this work? It's kind of subjectless. Where is the subject? And I think that's what I love about it. This is a very poetic work. And maybe it's just a close up of a face, but it almost looks like just like an empty space.
00:45:48.668 - 00:46:06.376, Speaker A: And it's all about the surrounding area. Very cool work. So that's on base. And we got a couple more from Kiro Setafil. I believe this is also on base. So another beautiful work here. Gorgeous textures, analog video art.
00:46:06.376 - 00:46:21.872, Speaker A: Another interesting one, keytruda. So here are a few more shapes. And again, great textures. And another one, hard candy. And I believe this is with Rannixteer, if I'm not mistaken. I. Maybe I am mistaken.
00:46:21.872 - 00:46:36.792, Speaker A: Okay. I thought I saw one that was with Ranixteer, but that might have been a different. That might have been one of those. I'll have to figure that out. So sometimes collaborating there, maybe that was another work. Here is Klaus. This is number 186.
00:46:36.792 - 00:46:59.524, Speaker A: As we approach 200 here, I thought this is pretty rad, Klaus. Keeping it new and keeping it interesting as we go on. 186. And this was sold for 21 tezos and still selling, by the way. Here's an addition to one also selling, I mean, amazing here at. I think this is 187. Another gorgeous work.
00:46:59.524 - 00:47:31.092, Speaker A: So again, maybe one day we just think we could have got one of these for only 21 tezos. And you could see them going for a lot more at some point. Moe shit the nothig with some more. Just wild AI art, texture, textile work. AI, textile art, kind of these medieval times. And I don't know what the prompt is or what the sources might be, but it's pretty amazing. They've done pretty well.
00:47:31.092 - 00:47:52.372, Speaker A: Also on Twitter, on X. Interestingly, these are great too. Most built quite an audience for themselves on X. Here's a, I think one edition 30 day mint 0.02. So trying different things too. Again, kind of a medieval theme here with the knights and this beautiful fire. So again, texture and AI.
00:47:52.372 - 00:48:11.808, Speaker A: It's pretty convincing, isn't it? And finally, this is owned by Mo. And this is no hygiene. So another baby in a sandwich, which there's something about. There's something kind of amazing about this series. How much did this sell for? Just transferred. So cool work there. Here's Sarah.
00:48:11.808 - 00:48:34.776, Speaker A: Sarah Kretschmer. Metal islands. So a cool work. Probably using a whole bunch of different technologies here, softwares. And we see trees, a kind of landscape, maybe using some AI, maybe using some blender, not sure, just a cool landscape. Metal islands and no links. So just on X, posted on X.
00:48:34.776 - 00:48:54.348, Speaker A: Here's Denise Sanchez with a nice. A nice abstract as we run through the rest of this. A very nice abstract. Look at this. So I think this is a physical. It looks like a physical artwork, doesn't it? Nice piece. This is without a preconceived.
00:48:54.348 - 00:49:12.700, Speaker A: The dynamic creative process emphasizes the significance of chance without a preconceived plan. There's a beauty in working like this. The more you can work like this, the more fun I think art becomes. Like, I notice it with the pixel art Dante thing. I'm working on that. I don't need to have a reference. I can just kind of make whatever I want.
00:49:12.700 - 00:49:32.858, Speaker A: And that's kind of powerful. And I'm kind of endlessly surprised that I actually am, that I like it. My own work when I'm working on it, when I go just straight from the imagination. Now this is January 20. I just saw that, but posted on X. So I'll say cool work. Walk with a shoe.
00:49:32.858 - 00:49:43.818, Speaker A: So a drawing by walk here, who of course, I follow. That is a glitch on X. Look how beautiful that shoe is. So just a cool drawing. I love the subject matter. This is on Instagram. Sketchbook insights.
00:49:43.818 - 00:50:08.152, Speaker A: And I think this is by a tattoo artist. It is, I thought, just an interesting piece, isn't it? So this is in a sketchbook. And there you see it on the skin. And here is Bob Cheek Matia. More interesting, original work. This is 70 by 50 in gouache. And again, playing with this kind of skeletor and different toys.
00:50:08.152 - 00:50:23.170, Speaker A: Weird landscape. Very whimsical, edgy work. Posted by it's not gallery of Mary Lou Belle. The work is by Mary Lou Bell. And so just interesting painting. Very kind of contemporary, kind of edgy. And here's another one.
00:50:23.170 - 00:50:35.466, Speaker A: Ricardo Passaporte. We've seen a few. So a poodle with a clock. Just interesting work. Here's bondozo Bandido. We drip in like the 17th century. Interesting putting these four works together.
00:50:35.466 - 00:51:03.234, Speaker A: You know, David Hockney does this too. If you want to make a really big work, you can always. This might not be large, it's hard to tell. But if you want to make a really big work, it's totally legit to break it down into several canvases beautifully. Nice documentation there. Look how beautiful that is. And you see it is fairly large, right? David Hockney will put like 15 of these things, 20 of these things together, and then you have a massive piece.
00:51:03.234 - 00:51:18.792, Speaker A: A good hack here is Ilya Barabin with a cool work. This is airbrush. The work was done on a three paper acrylic and airbrush. Beautiful work here. So looking like a figure and almost with a baguette for a head. Cucumber head. It is a cucumber.
00:51:18.792 - 00:51:51.220, Speaker A: And this is another. I found this from our other weaver we're looking at, I think Kayla Mattis, if I'm not mistaken. She posted this artist visit she did of Kayleigh Kate Shuck, who is another weaver here. A different style of weaving. So very interesting, kind of a, you know, analogous style they could show in the same show. Right. Here's another work kind of this farm, you know, scene, you know, farmhouse scene, a scribble from summer.
00:51:51.220 - 00:52:01.444, Speaker A: So just very interesting. And that is your show, my friends. So I will see you hopefully join us on Wednesday with John Cates. Thank you for joining me. And until next time, take care.
