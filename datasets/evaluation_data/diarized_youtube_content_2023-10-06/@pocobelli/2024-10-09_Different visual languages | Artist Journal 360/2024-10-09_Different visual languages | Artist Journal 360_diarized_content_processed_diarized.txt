00:00:04.160 - 00:00:34.995, Speaker A: All systems go. As we move forward, letting the music fill our souls, will we find inspiration? It is a gift from above. Let's see what happens, my friends. Artist Journal, October 9, 2024. Broadcasting from an unusually sunny day in Berlin, Germany. My name's Adrian Boccabelli. It continues and I think it will be a short show.
00:00:34.995 - 00:01:12.335, Speaker A: I'm kind of optimistic on that. So I guess we'll find out. There's always a bit of a dramatic irony, I think it's called, where the audience knows something that the actor in the play does not. Because of course I don't know how long this is going to be. But you, my friend, can just look down in the corner and see how long this video is. So it's always an interesting dynamic here as we travel through time with our conversation, this delayed conversation with you that I'm having recorded on this computer, which seems to be performing well. So let's begin.
00:01:12.335 - 00:01:51.561, Speaker A: Here is Manatal and P1, you know, a very prolific, consistent, very focused in their pixel art work and very kind of cat oriented, you might say. And yeah, I mean it's just beautiful. It is a pixel art work. Let's look at how big it is. And actually there's music here. It kind of jumped out at me and Yeah, I kind of wondered to myself. It kind of jumped out at me.
00:01:51.561 - 00:02:18.741, Speaker A: So I bookmarked it and it remained here on the front page of the newspaper of the imagination. It remained Mandel P1. The warm library. So pretty. Beautiful. You see the Rubik's Cube here? Couple of fish. Sorry, a couple of cats reading in the library.
00:02:18.741 - 00:02:54.287, Speaker A: But they're reading about fish hilariously. And the little turntable there, bouncing up and down the needle. Beautiful. Some cameras and there's Manidal and so super cool, incredibly charming. And I always wonder to myself, I always wonder to myself again, like, you see the size here. 352 by 432. The original dimensions scaled up to 2464.
00:02:54.287 - 00:03:12.927, Speaker A: So I guess that's maybe times eight, if I had to hazard a guess, but not exactly sure or something. Maybe seven, not sure but. Or six. But quite a small. Like in a sense the. At least the digital. Put it this way.
00:03:12.927 - 00:03:32.305, Speaker A: Remember we were looking at the small works by Kyle Flemmer kf and we're delighting in how small they are. And actually Kyle wrote about this today, which is super interesting. I. This is. I see the same thing here. You know, what if this is on chain. What if Bitcoin.
00:03:32.305 - 00:04:02.427, Speaker A: But Tezos just that's okay. Too. These pixel artworks are just made to order because again, they're probably not huge. How many colors do we have here? We have black, brown, turquoise, kind of this peach, and maybe kind of white, gray, right? There's maybe six or seven max, eight colors here. And this beautiful frame. And look at how brilliant that is. Where it's almost like the frame is like.
00:04:02.427 - 00:04:58.423, Speaker A: There's a three dimensionality here almost, you know, like weirdly. Weirdly reminiscent to Renaissance paintings, I think Bellini, Venetian, Italian painting, where they'll have a scene and then at the bottom of the painting they'll have like. Almost like a shelf, as if it's like a window. And then they'll put things on the window sill, right? As if it's like kind of bringing in a whole other dimension of space. You kind of see this here because all of a sudden this frame goes from a pictorial device to perhaps a kind of architectural element, perhaps, even though it doesn't really look that way. But with this ladder here, it just adds a kind of ambiguity in the space, doesn't it? And perhaps. I wonder.
00:04:58.423 - 00:05:29.175, Speaker A: I mean, and maybe this is what the Italian painters were doing as well. Maybe it's a way of creating increased depth, right? Because all of a sudden it stretches the space out because you have something in the foreground. Anybody that's drawn, you know, using perspective. You put something really close and you put something really tiny far away. That'll create a big sense of space. And perhaps, just perhaps this ladder is fulfilling this function. I mean, interestingly, there is a sense of space here.
00:05:29.175 - 00:06:01.123, Speaker A: Not to go too far on the space tangent. Like, I mean, the Rubik's Cube is flat, the books are flat. But then you see, the turntable has space. So who knows? All to say, really gorgeous work that jumped out at me as I was bookmarking works in the last couple of days here. You gotta love the cat statue here. And of course, classic Manidal the cat character. This could be a cartoon as far as I'm concerned.
00:06:01.123 - 00:06:22.433, Speaker A: And maybe it should be a pixel art cartoon. It kind of like you don't even need to change anything. Like, you have the even. Like the animation even. All you need is like. And you do have audio here, but you'd have the cats talking. You'd already have your songs, your music for the beginning and different parts of the drama.
00:06:22.433 - 00:07:10.399, Speaker A: You just need to animate it more. Where you could probably just hire a. Like, you know, could probably hire someone. Where Manadil would be like, here's what we need to be done here's. Your basic frame for this scene, you know, and then they could talk and then maybe the cat would walk across, who knows? Beautiful work here. Beautiful pixel artwork. And it raises just finally, before we move on from this, to me, it raises a huge question to me, which is one I've struggled with and wrestled with with pixel arts from the very beginning, which is this very kind of childlike, shall we say, content, right? I mean, this could be a animation.
00:07:10.399 - 00:08:09.157, Speaker A: Like I'm saying, this could be a kids cartoon to a certain degree. As seen from a kids cartoon, it's pixel art. So I mean, it kind of raises the whole question of. But is it, you know, like, is this in the same tradition as the Mona Lisa? You know, And I still would say yes. And it raises this kind of huge question, though, that I wonder to myself in terms of how these works will be valued like 100 years from now, will it be seen as a kind of pioneering, you know, work of this, you know, pixel artist from 2024. Early pixel artist, you know, And I suspect it will, I suspect. But I'm not like, I don't necessarily have huge conviction on it, but it's all to say it's a super interesting, well put together work.
00:08:09.157 - 00:08:38.965, Speaker A: And what I kind of love about it is the fact that it does actually raise that question for me. You know, it is so cute, so to speak. It is so much like a cartoon. But, you know, it's sort of like, you know, it's this interesting overlap. We see it with Carl Barks, right, With the great uncle, the inventor. From my understanding of Uncle Scrooge. Right.
00:08:38.965 - 00:09:02.063, Speaker A: Uncle Scrooge was not, you know, invented by Disney. Donald Duck was invented by Disney. But Uncle Scrooge. And I believe Huey, Louie and Dewey were invented also, I believe. Not positive on that. Not positive on Huey, Dewey and Louie, but I believe at least Karl Barks, Uncle Scrooge, pretty sure. Maybe even Huey, Dewey and Louie.
00:09:02.063 - 00:09:34.031, Speaker A: Not sure on the nephews, so to speak. But it raises this whole question, like, and maybe very quickly, Karl Barks paintings, which are quite collectible by the way, it kind of brings up the whole comics as art. And anybody that's, you know, you look at a page of Jack Kirby and you say, you know, like, these are oil paintings. There's Karl Barks. Actually, let's bring up Karl Barks. If my Internet will work. I'm kind of struggling here a little bit with technical difficulties.
00:09:34.031 - 00:09:47.279, Speaker A: Let's see. These are oil paintings. If we can bring this up. And there is Barks. And if you don't know what this is. I can't remember the name of this, but this steadies your hand when you're oil painting. I had to take.
00:09:47.279 - 00:10:13.535, Speaker A: I never learned that when I took studio painting in university, but later when I went to the Academy of Realist Art in Toronto for a couple of workshops. I think it's a mallet stick, is what you call this. This stick here is for steadying your hand. This is like, you know, it's a classic thing. And of course I took four years of painting and I never learned that hilariously in university, which is kind of funny. I think these. This is a print.
00:10:13.535 - 00:11:23.289, Speaker A: This kind of looks. Not exactly sure what this is, but this is definitely based on a painting know. So again, you're kind of in this realm where it's almost like pixel art in a weird way is analogous to comic art in the way that it seems to be a product of pop culture, but sometimes it's done so well that it is you. It that you can't not call it art. You think of Frank Miller, right? Daredevil, Sin City, you know, Dark Knight Returns in the comic land, you know, these great artists and you see a cover of a comic and even all the, you know, again and there are, you know, you see Steve Ditko, Spider man and pixel Art. For me, particularly a work like this reawakens that whole question of what do you do with this? And I think ultimately you from a. Just from a tradition point of view.
00:11:23.289 - 00:12:14.495, Speaker A: And I think ultimately my default is if it works, it works in a sense. My view is to basically have a radically unsnobby view of what constitutes art. Even things that sometimes are not even intended as art can sometimes be like brilliant art pieces. I think of some 1970s space age furniture, right, which can be beautiful sculptures, for example. And so all to say, it does kind of bring up these interesting questions, questions, evaluations. Put it this way, if I was to speculate, what I think is going to happen at the very minimum is you're going to have a subculture that just like there are. There's kind of a subculture of people that love comic art.
00:12:14.495 - 00:13:03.261, Speaker A: And that subculture is going to exist for pixel art. And you're going to have what I'd call traditional art collectors bleeding in to that subculture. As you see, I would argue with comic art. And I think we're going to see something similar here. And so I think. And another final point on this, and then we'll run through this show, is the element of time, you know, when, like 10 years after, you know, in the 1980s, let's say, if you're looking at the cost of a page of Jack Kirby comic art, you know, you probably weren't paying very much. But by the 90s, all of a sudden, it's starting to look more Precious.
00:13:03.261 - 00:13:28.459, Speaker A: By the 2000s and 20 teens, 2000 teens, it's starting to look very precious. And all of a sudden you're getting, you know, I think it was the COVID of Mr. Natural Number One by Robert Crumb, you know, selling for over $100,000. And it'd probably sell for $500,000 now. Right. And so. And, you know, and there's another kind of awesome example, you know, who Robert, you know, Robert Crumb.
00:13:28.459 - 00:13:53.199, Speaker A: Who? Robert Hughes, the famous, you know, critic, art critic at time for 20, 30 years. Who he. Who wrote or who did the film, what is it, the Shock of the new on YouTube. Haven't talked about this for a while. Robert Hughes calling Robert Crumb the American Bruegel. Right. And I think that's legitimate.
00:13:53.199 - 00:15:20.455, Speaker A: And what final point on Crumb, for those that know Robert Crumb, what also makes Crumb, you might say, in that kind of precious, you know, for lack of better term, fine art. One of the things that I'd argue makes Crumb, you know, within the pantheon of the elite greats, for lack of better term, where you can see it's unambiguous, is Crumbs radical portrayal of human nature. For anybody that's looked at underground comics artist Robert Crumb, you'll see it shocking. But what is he doing? That I'd argue that the Marquis de Sade and that whole other tradition that flows through Surrealism, that is not worried about morality or aesthetics, what are they? And also goes through Henry Fielding in the introduction to Tom Jones, where our main dinner is what. What is our main feast, according to Fielding, human nature. And so, and back to this qualitative science, I dare say, what do we see with what is Marquis de Sade and Robert Crumb? What do they share? A radical, a radically honest, one could argue, portrayal of human nature. They are, you know, what I call transcribing the nervous system.
00:15:20.455 - 00:16:05.717, Speaker A: It is. And it's an inherently modern act. And it's what I would call, according to Ballard, what is JG Ballard doing, a writer, also interestingly, radically honest view of human nature, which, interestingly, finally, Ballard considered a hallmark of the modern. And remember, we were talking about the naive, right? The artist as naive. What is that naivete? You know, coming to the world on their Own terms, what does that mean? You know, basically having a radically kind of honest view, like, you know, view of what you're trying to portrayal. Again, you're. You're not just making a pretty picture.
00:16:05.717 - 00:17:49.255, Speaker A: You're doing a kind of what I call qualitative science, a kind of speculation, a speculative, you know, science or qualitative science, speculative exploration of what it is that you are as a human, you know. And so as we've, as I've commented on before, finally, this is the similarity, the weird similarity you're going to see between Marquis de Sade 1790s, the 120 days and Krafft Ebbing and the scientific work that starts with psychopathia, you know, so, you know, and what, what do they both share? I mean, they're almost a similar structure, I would argue. I don't know how Manidal got us to SAD and Krafft Ebbing, but almost a similar structure of these cataloging of really the perversions, you know, and what is that? You know, so, but coming from different angles, Krafft Ebing was doing case studies of people that came to his, you know, office, so to speak, in Germany in the, you know, 1890s. Sad is just in prison and outraging, just writing the most outrageous stuff he can even come up with. All very interesting. So again, and so I bring that back, it was through Robert Crumb is how we got to SAD and Craft ebbing, you know, this radical honesty. But on the other hand, using this you might call humble medium of comic art, but which really, you could argue traces all the way back to the beginning of, you know, at least to the hieroglyphs.
00:17:49.255 - 00:18:32.067, Speaker A: So who's to say, you know, in a sense, the medium should not disqualify it, particularly when it's beautiful. And so once again, then you return to our beautiful pixel artwork by Manadal in P1 and you go, that's a pretty nice work, isn't it? Aesthetically quite persuasive. What is in the library? It starts to be your next question. There's coffee, which gets me excited. Anyway, very interesting work here. The warm Library, beautiful as ever by P1 and Manidal edition of 20 for 6 Tezos. Gorgeous big show today.
00:18:32.067 - 00:19:06.269, Speaker A: Unknown Collector on the state of the Arts should be great. Of course, the last show with Unknown Collector was named after Unknown Collector's tweet. Wondering if it is in fact a revolution that we're undergoing here. Interesting question. So I'm gonna going to ask some more about that and discuss that with Unknown Collector Today. So do check that out and it'll be posted on the feed when after it is, it will be recorded and it'll be on the feed if you miss it. Ed Marola.
00:19:06.269 - 00:19:28.563, Speaker A: Oh, so happy to see Unknown Collector with the rabbit pfp. So I guess Unknown Collector is using a rabbit pfp perhaps made by Ed. And good news as far as I could tell. I believe the Brazilian. I think the Brazilian artists are back on the scene here. I think they're kind of re engaged. They have been let back onto X.
00:19:28.563 - 00:19:47.047, Speaker A: So that is exciting. So big shout out to Ed Merola. Awesome to hear from you. Kyle Flemmer. Totally agree about the weird precociousness of a small file size. It is very weird, you know, and it's something that is weird. Yeah.
00:19:47.047 - 00:20:31.085, Speaker A: Like it's a phenomenon because again and in the small file size it's not exciting. With a JPEG of a photo, right. You get a 500 by 500 photo. It has to do weirdly I think to investigate it a little bit with the crispness there's. It's almost like a miniature. Right. And like it's almost the same kind of delight you take in seeing like a miniature at the Met and this tiny, you know, little thing that's been carved by a medieval artist and you know, a little sculpture and you say how on earth did anybody do that? And there's kind of a fetishistic quality to the miniature.
00:20:31.085 - 00:20:52.027, Speaker A: Right. So it's almost like the small file size images are like miniatures of sorts. Let's continue. I've been upscaling pixel art to post on social media, which is required. Otherwise it'll be fuzzy, out of habit and didn't think to export and mint it at one of one scale until I saw your tiny synth artwork. Of course. Yes.
00:20:52.027 - 00:21:08.811, Speaker A: On Bitcoin there. I am still posting those works and yeah, just. Yeah. So let's continue. There's definitely something charming about a crisp little image. So crisp. But like you said, it takes some time to develop an appreciation for it.
00:21:08.811 - 00:21:36.423, Speaker A: Indeed, I found that was particularly true for my own images. I agree. I found the same thing which I get used to looking at up close. Now taking a big step back to see it as true scale has become the most satisfying part. I almost want to go to those Dante works. Thanks again for showing and shining your light on digital art. I mean, shall we just do a quick like so people know what we're talking about here? Let me see.
00:21:36.423 - 00:22:00.083, Speaker A: Usually I am lucky here and I managed to find my page. Let us see. And here like if we were to pick a piece here, let us pick. Let's pick this one. And so this is all garbled by the. But here, now, is that the right size? It feels like it should. This is the right size.
00:22:00.083 - 00:22:23.755, Speaker A: See? 100%. This is the right size, hilariously so. That is what we're talking about here. This tiny little work. And then as you make it bigger, you can start to see, but it starts to fuzz out. That's why you need to multiply the scale here. So there's something about this and all the data is there.
00:22:23.755 - 00:22:39.223, Speaker A: Right. So it's quite interesting. It's quite interesting. Thank you for the. Thank you for highlighting that. And it's very interesting to hear that it's not just because then I start to go, oh, it's not just me. And then we're back to if.
00:22:39.223 - 00:22:56.571, Speaker A: Well, if 30 people feel this way, why not 3,000? Very interesting modem. MT. I appreciate your words, Adrian. Awesome to hear from you. Modem, also known as Turo, awesome artist, is in the Neuro. In the Neutro special I did in Buenos Aires. Check that out.
00:22:56.571 - 00:23:12.227, Speaker A: Ed Morola. This is all pretty darn interesting, for sure. Indeed. And I believe, talking about everything that's going on here. Awesome to hear from you, Ed, and again, looking forward to your return on X. Rosaccio. Love the enthusiasm in the first couple of minutes.
00:23:12.227 - 00:23:35.771, Speaker A: Yes, I watched a bit of that and I was a little bit taken aback by myself, but I'm glad it didn't scare off everybody. Also, Salowaki's work is so weird. I love it. Indeed, I love weird art, which is why I decided to create something inspired by Salowaki's art. So, yeah, that awesome, awesome homage to a Salowaki artwork. Very cool. And J.H.
00:23:35.771 - 00:24:49.293, Speaker A: pedro, I believe one of the great things about this moment is that in the past there was a certain dictated language of digital art where the artist was obliged by the environment to use the quote, unquote latest language. Whether that was a general purpose programming language or a particular art program like Photoshop that represented a industry standard approach to image creation, an accommodation that brought in traditional artists, but one that wasn't necessarily coming from the artists themselves. Very interesting. Since the technology was presented as part of a rat race, the social atmosphere created a lot of pressure to use the latest and not be, you know, quote left behind, end quote. I think that moment for industry standards as we knew them has passed. The blockchains are a bigger source of consensus and that changes who is making the language and this is a very, very interesting comment because it's easy to forget. And it's almost like it's fun to take an image first approach in a sense, right? It's almost like we were discussing to a certain degree with Manadal and P1's work.
00:24:49.293 - 00:25:26.689, Speaker A: Like, just go with the experience and ask questions later, but don't say no before you have the experience. And perhaps this is kind of another angle on this, which is it doesn't matter what software you use and look at all the different kinds of softwares that are being used. It's kind of the result that ultimately matters. It's that reptilian, you know, effect that you go. That just makes you love it for whatever reason. This phenomenon, this appreciation of beauty to a certain degree is one way of framing it. Now, bringing up this issue of language, too, is super interesting.
00:25:26.689 - 00:25:54.265, Speaker A: I was discussing this last show how people who. Where I feel sympathy for people coming into this, say, digital art scene on the blockchain and kind of not really understanding the language at first and maybe even dismissing it. And why even. Even look. Look at Mandal going, well, is this art? Right? Like, I mean, as I did two years ago. And so my. I think there are several languages.
00:25:54.265 - 00:26:32.715, Speaker A: There are several visual languages here. You know, you could say there's a kind of a. Idiom, so to speak, or a dialect of, you know, pixel art. There is an idiom or a language of glitch. There's almost a language you could argue to digital painting and this tension that exists between virtual brushes and physical brushes and digital, purely digital brushstrokes and, you know, brushstrokes, which are clearly inspired by physical brushes. So that's a whole kind of conversation unto itself. And then there's also mixing everything together.
00:26:32.715 - 00:27:23.865, Speaker A: There's also collage. There's also a language you could argue, again, an idiom, a familiarity, you know, in AI, right? I mean, you don't. Isn't there like that classic distortions, you know, the six hands even, or the six fingers? In early AI art, that's kind of disappearing and that almost becomes a trope. It's like a thing, right? It's part of the language. And the first time you might see that, you might not think of anything of it. But if you know the language of AI art, you go, oh, okay, that's kind of coming from an early, earlier AI or AI art from a certain time, shall we say, 2022, 2023. It's tempting to say you still get it once in a while, but not that often, right? And that that's a thing, right? And that's something to appreciate.
00:27:23.865 - 00:28:36.031, Speaker A: It's part of this kind of aesthetic, this celebration by keeping that in, right? So it's like these are different visual languages that we're engaged in here, which is part of the reason, I think the world, I would argue, is it is adopting. It's like you see an increasing popularity, as we've been noticing on Tazos for this art, but it is slow to adopt. Like, it's not like you'd show Amanda work necessarily, and people are going to, you know, jump for joy and go, this is the greatest thing, right? But maybe after looking at a whole bunch of pixel art, they might go, that's spectacular, as I would say, with its few colors there and gorgeous composition and perfect, you know, pixel art, for example. Part of the appreciation of pixel art, and this is why it's helpful to be an artist making art is actually the size of the canvas and what decisions are made. So when I see man at all, it's like, oh, interesting 340. That becomes a part of the language, right? Part of the understanding of what is going on. It's like, oh, it's pixels that are this kind of size, right? So very interesting.
00:28:36.031 - 00:29:07.875, Speaker A: And you know, I suspect, like, I never really thought of it as like these softwares that you probably had to use, but probably that is, you know, how people kind of thought of it maybe in more of the contemporary art scene or the trad art scene, like there are certain ways of doing things or softwares, who knows? But very provocative and interesting comment. Thank you, Pedro. Also, Ternine, thank you for the massive support here on the show. Ver Clousy. Hi Adrian. Found your podcast and videos recently. Great episode.
00:29:07.875 - 00:29:19.865, Speaker A: So thank you version. Welcome. I'm thrilled. It's thrilling to find people that are new that like the show. So I really appreciate the comment. Jan Lucas Magone, looking good. Thank you.
00:29:19.865 - 00:29:39.177, Speaker A: I assume you're talking about the art there. And so anyways, appreciate the comment. Yan, always awesome work as ever. Absurd deity. We have a new comment here. Hello Adrian, Great show. As you shared your introduction to the land of Tezos art, right where I discovered it through Haiti Rockette, I couldn't help but reflect upon my own.
00:29:39.177 - 00:30:06.815, Speaker A: It's been two years of mostly stumbling around in the dark with the help of artist and collector friends who generously guided my journey. Sincere gratitude to all those who have given me tips along the way. Too many to list, but you know who you are. I've recently been asked a number of times how I Discover the art I feel compelled to collect. Of course. Absurd Deity collecting a huge amount on Tezos right now. Well, would it surprise you at all to know that I used the same technique you fell into early on? Yep.
00:30:06.815 - 00:30:43.757, Speaker A: Going down the object.com rabbit hole, following the collection of one artist or collector to another, then another and on and on. What's this is like a new way of art collecting, a new way of discovering art. It's incredibly powerful and it also is part of the social media, I would argue, of these NFT marketplaces, these digital art marketplaces. It is, you know, they are, that is social media as far as I'm concerned. Because you're looking, I look at, you know, where you're looking at other people's collections and considering buying the works. It's like you're giving it even more importance than you would a friend looking at their photos.
00:30:43.757 - 00:31:03.545, Speaker A: Right. You're looking at. Should I spend money on this? What's with the lousy. What with the lousy X algo object is quote unquote the way. It's also just so incredibly enjoyable to embark on these journeys of discovering new art through the object looking glass. Indeed. Almost dangerous, I would argue, from a financial point of view.
00:31:03.545 - 00:31:32.765, Speaker A: I leave you with the very first collected work, which was playing cards number 160, a secondary purchase of a collaborative generative art minted on FX Hash by the artists M. Noel and John, well known artist. So Here a cool fx # generative artwork by John and Mnol. And I guess this was the first work collected by Absurd Deity. So and here Vahid. That's amazing. Your first piece is such a great choice.
00:31:32.765 - 00:31:52.563, Speaker A: I find generative art really fascinating with so many stories embedded within it. I'm glad we share the same similar experience. And the journey of discovering new art never seems old. Thanks for sharing. Indeed, it is a new way of discovering art. And that is significant. That is very significant and it's incredibly enjoyable.
00:31:52.563 - 00:32:27.961, Speaker A: If you're on artsy, you know, another web platform or Saatchi Saatchi art, you know, let's say you're looking for art. I mean you don't really have that, do you? Because. And the artists aren't exactly buying a ton of physical work, whereas here, because it's cheap, the artists will buy other work and you start to, you know, and sometimes they spend a lot of money. I've spent a lot of money. But sometimes, you know, so. But all to say, the collecting is much more omnipresent, shall we say, on the blockchain scene, particularly on Tezos, you don't see as much on super rare. You see some.
00:32:27.961 - 00:32:53.097, Speaker A: But not everybody can afford to spend 3, 400 or $1,000 on a work. Whereas here, okay, I can get a Yuri J for 20 bucks if I'm fast, right? Or you name your artist or manital for like 4 bucks. Awesome. So very cool. Armilk whose work we showed. Remember the track the truck from yesterday made of Windows operating system components. Hi Adrian, great release as always.
00:32:53.097 - 00:33:09.145, Speaker A: I'll answer your question. The folder van is hand drawn. Surprising. Only some classic elements for the grotesque are inserted but they are also aligned to the pixel grid. So very cool. I mean that would make a great physical artwork too. So thanks for letting me know.
00:33:09.145 - 00:33:25.179, Speaker A: Armilk. Love that work. Almost started with us. Yes, this is an exciting opening feeling the energy and love the new followers comment indeed. And energy of the show. Always great and essential viewing. Had to get a coffee myself to meet the vibes.
00:33:25.179 - 00:33:39.569, Speaker A: And the second sip of water moment. A rare artist journal occurrence. This is a good screenshot. So hilarious. Thank you Ailey. Much appreciated the support. Long supporter of this show and just great artists there too.
00:33:39.569 - 00:34:04.637, Speaker A: Heidi Rockette Much love. Awesome to hear from you Heidi. Of course we started the show with there is Haiti Rockette's work and there's Haiti Rockette's hilarious profile picture which I think is taken from a video game and just a total character here. So just an awesome, awesome Internet artist. Rocco, thank you for the comment. Filippo Francocci thanks so much for showing my work Adrian. Indeed.
00:34:04.637 - 00:34:29.861, Speaker A: Max Ernst has been a big influence in my work. His decalcomania technique opened a new path as I often struggled to choose subject matter in my figurative art. So I guess I was onto something there. I always look forward to your show and get loads out of every episode. Thrilled to hear Filippo. Awesome to hear from you and super interesting and super interesting art. And there we go.
00:34:29.861 - 00:35:03.701, Speaker A: Pedro Jose time for artist journal and some coffee. Hilarious, awesome and trippy Collector. The opening convo reminded me of the artist Nielsen Ochsniel's work and not sure and then we'll let that load up here. Entropy Collector Second official water consumption documented. Let the record show so it is recorded there for everybody to see. I'm having a bit of Internet issues here so I'm not sure if this is going to load up here. I'm going to continue and maybe we go back to that.
00:35:03.701 - 00:35:26.061, Speaker A: If it loads skull takes actually it might be object actually you know how people were having issues with object loading. I think it might be object but not positive. It could be my Internet as well. Let's just quickly look at the community. Some interesting work here. Skull takes I minted some new arts. Death Bytes 03 and 004 are up for auction in the next 24 hours.
00:35:26.061 - 00:35:42.015, Speaker A: And here they are. So interesting. Almost three dimensional pixel art here as you see here as well. So very cool work. Thank you for posting. Skull takes 369 up down. So this kind of looks like some programming art.
00:35:42.015 - 00:35:55.919, Speaker A: And this looks like interesting. Almost looks like cut up or backwards letters down. We maybe a backwards poem. Interesting. Thank you for posting. Cool work in Katarina Create. This is actually going to be in the show.
00:35:55.919 - 00:36:16.175, Speaker A: Good morning or good night Artist Journal fam. So this will actually be later in the show is what I'm trying to say. Today I want to share my new drop on object visor Ferrari. So white Ferrari and here is I guess the white Ferrari in the background. So awesome piece. Love the almost game board Monopoly type UI here or framing device. Very cool work.
00:36:16.175 - 00:36:33.175, Speaker A: We'll see it again. And here Human Boy happening tomorrow on Tezos. Happy to be with so many wonderful artists. So mark your calendars for art market day release on object.com going live tomorrow. Get the preview as artists begin to mint their works. So a ton of new works here I think I found actually there's Rene Fish.
00:36:33.175 - 00:36:55.313, Speaker A: There are a few that I am showing in this show as well. But you can find it all on object. Very cool. Here's Macro Metry with almost a person here. Thank you Phil is the name of the work. And this work we're about to see in full resolution with the music. Awesome piece by Kurt Hessel Collective that I believe will start us off on the works.
00:36:55.313 - 00:37:15.537, Speaker A: And Runetune in the middle part of the show. And Runetoon collab between me and Kavanaugh. This also I had already bookmarked it. So awesome. Of course Runetoon the co host of the space for two years now. I think we're going on two years in December. And here is a work by Runetoon.
00:37:15.537 - 00:37:32.425, Speaker A: We'll look closer later in the show. Interesting combination of photo and illustration. And took. Good morning. Very cool work here. Looking like some collage and maybe a little bit of digital painting that's on the art market that we just saw. Zizo with some works here and cool works here.
00:37:32.425 - 00:37:51.547, Speaker A: Kind of looks like perhaps AI Lego X. Thank you for posting. Cool kind of illustration. Ernesto Ashley with some cool I guess you'd call them abstracts here. Thank you for posting. And Venta GM friends so Venta, of course, great AI artist. And look at this.
00:37:51.547 - 00:38:38.119, Speaker A: A twin drop of a new collection presenting original digital paintings alongside AI reimagining. So using the original work and then putting into AI to get this kind of three dimensional rendering. A very interesting way of working. What is a way. Now I feel like I'm trying to go, yeah, it's too complex to say, but I have a process where I no longer worry about finishing it in a certain way because I know in the second process I'll be able to just. It will kind of take care of what needs to be finished. And what I'm trying to say here is you can theoretically put a work up that let's say maybe this is probably finished for Venta and this is.
00:38:38.119 - 00:39:22.213, Speaker A: And that's great. But you could theoretically you could put a work that's kind of like let's say 80% there and then you put it into the AI and maybe it doesn't make a difference and maybe it's even better than if you kind of put all the shading and every last little detail. Kind of an interesting, you know, from a process point of view, even philosophically, like what does that mean? Right? Is this a kind of like is this a quality of digital art that you. A characteristic that you can do something like that? It kind of seems that way but not sure. I guess theoretically you could do it with photography that wasn't great. And then you put it into screen print and that finishes the job by doing a certain process. So perhaps not a digitally a digital characteristic.
00:39:22.213 - 00:39:30.159, Speaker A: August Ground New work. Please repost. The wind. Always the wind. Video Audio poem so new work. We'll see if it loads. I'm not sure it will.
00:39:30.159 - 00:39:50.815, Speaker A: I was. Yeah. Web server. We're having a lot of issues here with object. We'll see if this loads and maybe it will. August Ground with a poetic swing. Kind of glitched out.
00:39:50.815 - 00:40:08.605, Speaker A: So interesting piece. IPhone 6 camera. Very interesting cool work. The wind. Always the wind. Video audio poem from August Ground. Thank you for posting and Psycho Futurist continuing the tarot awesomely.
00:40:08.605 - 00:40:34.619, Speaker A: And we're gonna have to speed up a bit here but very cool work in the tarot and also let's. And primitive Also thank you for posting 369 Abstract here. Thank you for posting and Ernesto Ashley and yeah. And remember everybody, just once a week if you can. That would be great. But cool looking work here. And little cakes.
00:40:34.619 - 00:40:51.307, Speaker A: Cool. I have a bunch of shows I want to show to see while I'm in Japan. The Tony Oersler show being one of them. So I guess this is a show. How cool is that? And feel free to post links like this stuff that's going on. Look at how cool that looks. And little cakes.
00:40:51.307 - 00:41:07.657, Speaker A: Really interesting artist. I believe we have some works there in the AI section. Thank you, Ernesto. Thank you Louie jpd, which we saw last show. Thank you everybody. Let me just close that. And thank you Ilay for the screenshots with the different effects here.
00:41:07.657 - 00:41:32.985, Speaker A: Glitched effects, colored pencil and hilarious. And that work we'll see later in the show as well. So very cool. Into the comments we go. Sabato, who of course I follow. For all the hype, there isn't much visibility in the Shape ecosystem unless you're one of the featured influencers. But maybe if I pretend to offer medals for minting for reading mackenzie works, Gamer theory for writing a short critical essay with citations.
00:41:32.985 - 00:43:11.977, Speaker A: So yeah, I, yeah, I guess the, you know, I mean this is the problem, right? Like I kind of saw it at the last crypto conference I was at. Like it is a weird mix, the crypto scene, which is very tech oriented and the art scene which is kind of in its pure form, very kind of culture and history oriented and it's just a completely different conversation. Right? And so it's just interesting and I actually think it's great that these two kind of cultures are colliding on the blockchain through crypto basically. But I think that's part of the tension that you see here in a sense. Interestingly, crypto culture, it's kind of weird to a certain degree that art has become such a big thing, I would argue in crypto culture because it's not like it is valued and we're painting with a very broad brush here and generalizing, but it's not necessarily at the top of the agenda. And you see it say with PFPs where all of a sudden it's like even the art can be questionable, but then we're going to collect and everything because of some other kinds of reason. And so all to say, it's a weird marriage and I think you're seeing that weird marriage between devs, so to speak, and artists.
00:43:11.977 - 00:43:56.385, Speaker A: I think you're seeing in Shape here where. And again, so yeah, so it's just kind of interesting. So another report on Shape from Sabato. Much appreciated on what is going on over there. Sanso Sanzo Eth Saint Sanso if I'm being honest, one of the reasons I've been spending more time reviewing older NFT digital art collections is that I find the constant release of new work to be overwhelming and a source of anxiety, especially when I think about how new work will continue to be released. Allowing art time to breathe and hype to dampen allows me time to determine how I feel about the work. How does it fit in the canon? Is it important? Do I really like the work or am I being influenced by other forces? How does it fit with other pieces I've collected, etc.
00:43:56.385 - 00:44:23.793, Speaker A: It is interesting. I wouldn't call it a source of anxiety for me. I'm surprised at how much I, you know, that resonates with me. And maybe it's back to this earlier discussion of visual languages. Right. But I'm actually surprised at how. How much is like resonates with me that I feel like, okay, I can show this work and feel good about it.
00:44:23.793 - 00:45:01.995, Speaker A: Right. And so yeah, I mean it's kind of with anything like look at writing, I wouldn't feel too much anxiety about writing. You know, all this new writing that comes out, the world is like drowning in writing for decades now. I guess you're not collecting writing is the difference. But interesting. It kind of. But as a collector, perhaps it reminds you to really focus on the works you think are going to survive because there is so much out there that you do have to consider that.
00:45:01.995 - 00:45:34.771, Speaker A: So interesting comment from Sanzo Saint Sanzo Retro on every other chain it's possible to be blockchain agnostic, especially once the hype and the money dries up in one place. But on Tezos, there's a ton of die hard users who swear by it. Even if. Even if. Even if it has made them broke. The weird thing is most of these die hard users do not align with Tezos Capital T long term goals or even Tezos Foundation. Then why Sotez Maxi? I think it's because on some level they see it as the last real community in Web3.
00:45:34.771 - 00:46:02.673, Speaker A: A group of artists, collectors, devs and bakers who do not want to go everywhere el where everyone else is going. Even if it leads to more money and success. Yeah, as far as. Yeah, I wouldn't call myself a maxi, that's for sure. I am kind of proudly multichain, but I'm not sure I would agree with. I think the reason why. The true reason, I would argue, and I'd be curious to hear what RetroManni has to say about this.
00:46:02.673 - 00:46:40.545, Speaker A: The true reason why Tezos remains vibrant and remains relevant and arguably central in this whole blockchain art discussion is because there's money, is because you know, it's the easiest way, I'd actually argue, to make money. Putting a work on ETH is not, you know, it's a trickier thing to make money there. Put it on Tezos. There's much more of a collector community. There's much more, many more people who will. If you put it for a Tezos, you will sell it. If it's kind of decent and you promote it enough, you will sell it.
00:46:40.545 - 00:47:10.211, Speaker A: Right. So I actually think the reason why Tazos, I would argue, is I don't think it's just kind of a counterculture thing. I think the whole crypto scene is pretty counterculture in a sense. Even as mainstream as bitcoin is, what we're doing over here is not mainstream, I don't think. Right. So I think it's about the money is actually, I'm kind of back to the free market. I think that's what really keeps people coming back.
00:47:10.211 - 00:47:32.329, Speaker A: Because if people aren't don't have an incentive other than to put their art on the blockchain, I just don't think you're going to get as vibrant of a scene. And I think collectors in turn have to think that their investment is going to be worth something. Right. That they're not simply throwing money to the wind, which is entirely possible. Right. So let's continue. There's a cause in there somewhere.
00:47:32.329 - 00:47:50.571, Speaker A: Maybe it's about freedom. Maybe it's linked to anger at the system. Yeah, I'm kind of back to free market, to be honest. I only mint on Tez, but I'm not sure I'm part of this group of Die Hards. Right. And this is what Retromania is discussing is really Tez Maxis, which is interesting. Maybe that is the issue.
00:47:50.571 - 00:48:29.959, Speaker A: Like maybe when you're talking about Tezmaxis, Tezos, Maxis or people who only want to use Tezos, perhaps this is exactly what's going on. Kind of a counterculture, you know, anger at the system, perhaps. Tezos to the moon and happy. Let's see what Ahek has to say. Joshua Sobel, someone was asking in a previous episode, who's Joshua? This is Joshua Sobel, a hack who left a big comment three shows ago, which is why we're referring to him as Joshua. Speculative things like price and hype don't matter as much as genuine connection rooted in authenticity. The art scene on Tezos is meaningful and inclusive.
00:48:29.959 - 00:48:52.015, Speaker A: And inclusive. And it's attracted bright lights, is sustained this energy for years and that consistency has earned it a loyal following. Yeah. And as I put it they haven't, like, object hasn't royally screwed up yet. And so that in. As a result, their credibility has been building over two years and three years. And that's a long time in crypto.
00:48:52.015 - 00:49:22.545, Speaker A: Right? Like, that's I think. And I think that credibility is starting to consolidate. So as long as they keep not screwing up, they got a good thing going right now and the market is almost rewarding it and it's recognizing that something is going on here because something has been going on here for years now. Right. So, quite interesting. Ilya Barabin soon. So I thought this was interesting as an artist, as someone that, you know, okay, I've had to ship work before.
00:49:22.545 - 00:49:54.689, Speaker A: I love this idea. I've never thought of this or seen it, but this idea of like, okay, I'm going to put this poster here that's underneath and this, you know, often it's put in this roll or in this kind of container that's round here. And this, what do you. Not a cone, not a oval, but this, you know, this round container here rolled up. Right. But I've never thought of putting the artwork on the outside. I wouldn't want to give incentive, though, in a sense, perhaps I'd have reservations on it.
00:49:54.689 - 00:50:33.721, Speaker A: I think it's a really cool idea, but perhaps I'd have reservations on it in the sense that perhaps it would give incentive to people who are delivering it that all of a sudden if they think some valuable artwork is being delivered, you know, maybe it risks the delivery also. So this is the work, interestingly, since we were here, and I believe a physical work, and this was included in the Fake Whale gallery here. So a physical, what we might call a physical NFT. Cool work. Very cool work. Photo of physical work 2024 and airbrush, pencil, oil, pastel, edition of 10. And that is not listed yet.
00:50:33.721 - 00:50:44.885, Speaker A: Here is the Kurt Hustle Collective. So here is the work. Emote rotation. How many of these are left? One left. I haven't bought mine yet. I wanted to. I don't have 10 days in my wallet.
00:50:44.885 - 00:51:14.523, Speaker A: Get the audio here. Very soothing. Always original music here. And just awesome, awesome artist. Almost feels like a Friday, Friday opening, doesn't it? So really cool work there. One left by. By the Kurt Hustle Collective.
00:51:14.523 - 00:51:25.553, Speaker A: KHC on object. Here's Martin Bruce, Picnic Cat. So after. Now this is going for 50 tazos. Let's see how much time is left. 38 minutes. I was looking at this piece.
00:51:25.553 - 00:51:49.483, Speaker A: Uh oh, now it's. It's good that, you know, everything was working My Internet object and everything was working here we're going to get a very slow. Here we go. It is going to load up and here you can see a very interesting. It's kind of still loading up. Let's let that load up for a second here. Picnic Cat by Martin Bruce.
00:51:49.483 - 00:52:02.619, Speaker A: And let's go here. Desnudo Azul with NUV 1914. Look at that. Filling the screen beautifully here. Beautiful work. Kind of has a bit of an Argentina flag kind of feel to it. Not sure if that's accidental.
00:52:02.619 - 00:52:17.893, Speaker A: Very cool. Nude. And this is based on a Matisse. Interestingly. What's interesting is Matisse often is fairly, you know, flat. I guess it's. Sometimes it's painterly and has volume, but here you see total volume.
00:52:17.893 - 00:52:47.659, Speaker A: So it's almost like taking the influence of the shapes and then doing what N does. Very cool work. Edition of 10 sold out at 15 Tezos. So NUV. You know, it wasn't that long ago that N was selling works for 15 tezos for a one of one even cheaper. So that's part of the beauty of this space is how fast things can change. Your market can heat up really quickly.
00:52:47.659 - 00:53:21.679, Speaker A: So that is exciting. It's happened to Nov a couple of times again. It's a boom bust business. And so all to say, Gorgeous by Martin Bruce here, you know, again, as I always like to say, he thinks with his eyes. And here probably based on a physical with this wild, you know, again, the physical taking you three quarters the way and then the digital being the final kind of leg of the race, so to speak. And here just an interesting kind of gif movement, gift ness. 900 by 700, nice and small.
00:53:21.679 - 00:53:44.371, Speaker A: Only 50 tazos. This one we saw. This one was brilliant. I picked one up Musicos after Botero, Fernando Botero, very famous Latin American artist. And so beautiful, beautiful piece here. I haven't seen the original of this and now I'm very curious. Gorgeous, gorgeous work here by NUV 1914.
00:53:44.371 - 00:54:16.759, Speaker A: And even the background of these big, you know, oval spheres here at musicos. Now 26 tezos on secondary. Yuri J picking up the last1@15tezos 1 day ago. This is Reny Fish and Fluffy Bliss is the name. This also in fake whale. Struggling, struggling with the Internet here. Not sure what is up.
00:54:16.759 - 00:54:41.169, Speaker A: Shall we try. I'm gonna try switching Internet here. We'll see if it's object. So I'm. No, it's probably my Internet. So Reny Fish, very cool. Kind of translucent, translucent pastels.
00:54:41.169 - 00:54:58.929, Speaker A: Very kind of psychedelic, Fluffy Bliss edition of Tan and two offers coming in. So not for sale yet. I'm not sure if any of these works are for sale yet. Let's continue. Very cool work here by Enigmatres. Look at that. 53,000 views.
00:54:58.929 - 00:55:15.683, Speaker A: 226 again, you're back to the fruit. Simple and powerful. Even kind of the right scale here. Love the orange text on the oranges. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. Nice and simple. Interesting text here with the green as well.
00:55:15.683 - 00:55:30.709, Speaker A: Just giving some highlights there. Kind of the math. The math fonts. And here also with the math and a much kind of smaller composition. 23,000 views. 161 retweets. Very impressive.
00:55:30.709 - 00:56:00.581, Speaker A: And here again, you see the visual ascii. You see the green math ascii. And then even here you see kind of a different kind of ascii. And it almost looks like a couple of works put together, as if this is like a screenshot of enigmatic screen, you know, as if something. It almost looks. But it is the same painting, I think, because you see the fruit and then there's this. But I'm not positive, actually.
00:56:00.581 - 00:56:18.961, Speaker A: I'm not sure this is the same painting because you see the fruit continuing here. This part here I'm not sure about, but it probably is because you actually do. I think it is all one painting. I was starting to wonder. Is an ink mattress using two paintings in one. Constantly experimenting there. This was interesting.
00:56:18.961 - 00:56:40.033, Speaker A: This was a work by rj, a homage to Uri J's octopus here. So interesting. Great textures here, as ever from rj. And so here's the octopus by rj. And I'm not sure if we looked at this work yet. The panther. And this is on foundation.
00:56:40.033 - 00:56:53.929, Speaker A: I think we might have looked at this on Twitter. And here you see McDonald's and a panther in the foreground. A lot of texture there. And no bids at 0.15 ETH. Dan Kelly, draw Dog Tuesday. Of course, I follow Dan Kelly.
00:56:53.929 - 00:57:19.845, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get that plane. And there is the dog. So again, you oftentimes filming a screen, right? So this is. That's what this looks like to me. This looks like filming, you know, putting a phone over top and then filming something else that's going on another screen is what's going on here, I suspect. So every Tuesday, Dan puts a dog out, I think buzziah.50 caliber.
00:57:19.845 - 00:57:36.674, Speaker A: Cool work here as the baseball card and the pink background. Continue here. Really cool. I love the trading card kind of series here.50 caliber. I guess that maybe that's 50cent. I've had to guess 20tezos.
00:57:36.674 - 00:57:52.403, Speaker A: Now on secondary and selling out at 5tezos. Keeping it nice and reasonably priced here. Doing quite well for himself. Putting out a ton of work. The myth. This is on fake Whale Gallery Family Portrait New York. So interesting work here.
00:57:52.403 - 00:58:10.267, Speaker A: Perhaps that's the myth. And there are the new homunculi. The black, the red and the yellow homunculi. And their classic myth colors, the green and the pink in the background. Myth clouds. And here a woman and the myth. And what is this called again? Family portraits.
00:58:10.267 - 00:58:22.331, Speaker A: So maybe hard to say the relationship there. Edition of 30 and not for sale yet. Here's rat Cloak. Crypto decadence. A gift. A gift for friends. Bazaya and Cloak.
00:58:22.331 - 00:58:38.955, Speaker A: The drawing is based on their works. Interesting. So edition of two and their gifts. And there looks like kind of like a Mike Tyson like figure. Pretty large painting. Cremes, referring to creme de la creme. Kind of early kind of, you know, affiliation, so to speak.
00:58:38.955 - 00:58:51.249, Speaker A: I don't know if I'd call it a group. Sure, let's call it a group. On Tezos there back to 2021. So interesting. Very nice painting here. And the baseball player. So I guess it's like a myth.
00:58:51.249 - 00:59:14.843, Speaker A: Mike Tyson with kind of like a Bazaya baseball player done by Ratcloak. So how cool is that gift? And sent to the myth and Busaya. You will never be able to buy that piece. The son of a comedian, perhaps Rosaccio after Rene Magritte. Maurizio Catalan, the Son of man, times comedian. Interesting. So there is the Maurice Catalan.
00:59:14.843 - 00:59:33.499, Speaker A: Maurizio Catalan with a famous tape banana. And then the son of man. Trying to remember the Magritte that that is. Shall we look very closely here sort of in. Let's speed up after this. Magritte Son of Man. It's probably like a guy with a bowler hat.
00:59:33.499 - 00:59:44.741, Speaker A: Exactly. This guy. So that is the son of man. So interesting take. Right? Of course. And the apple there is in front of the anatomical figure. Very cool.
00:59:44.741 - 01:00:17.675, Speaker A: Not for sale yet. And here is Xean just posting on X. There's leaderboard with an Amazon smile. So again, referencing what I would call the tension here between the arts and the kind of the crypto speculative culture, so to speak. And so here you see a bit of satire, arguably beautifully done with this kind of silhouette here and everything by. And here the marionettes, the puppets here. But they're skulls of the people and.
01:00:17.675 - 01:00:39.335, Speaker A: Yeah. And so here is probably the crypto person manipulating all the skulls here. That is leaderboard. That is my interpretation. Gloom tube. With a couple of works here, different kinds of barriers. Addition of one interesting piece here, looking like window, like shutters of a window.
01:00:39.335 - 01:01:01.497, Speaker A: How much does it sell for? 75 tezos. Nice sale for Gloom tube. And another one back of the garage. So we saw garbage bags. Remember those? And now we're seeing more kind of unglamorous parts of the house. You know, the spray paint at the back of the house. Just weird compositions to a certain degree, but familiar at least if you grew up in North America.
01:01:01.497 - 01:01:30.705, Speaker A: Right back, the garage edition of 10 and 4 sold so far at 10 Tezos. Here's a really rad work. Digital artwork by Walk, of course, Van Gogh's bedroom done in Walk style edition of 10 for 10 Tezos. That is on object. And here we have another one by Greg Nikshumika using I think it's Excel and the gradient tools in Excel. The great wave off the coast of Manhattan. So pretty cool.
01:01:30.705 - 01:01:45.801, Speaker A: Almost like a loose reference to Hakusai. There it is. Hakusai Ekoupormi. So cool work there. It sold out at three tezos. Nice work. Here's Dan Control with some TVs in a very simple landscape here.
01:01:45.801 - 01:02:09.697, Speaker A: Not sure if we saw that one, but we may have. And here's another radical, radical work by Dan Control. Taking a cigarette, electronic cigarette, and stretching it all the way to the side and to the borders. And just a classic Dan Control move. Just a cool conceptual work by him. Here's the myth in Jake Studios. And this was picked up with a new mythson.
01:02:09.697 - 01:02:27.618, Speaker A: So by the myth, but perhaps with some contribution by Jake Studios. Not sure. Maybe it was the tattoos. Not sure. But a new myth work. And a little bit even the animation looks like perhaps that was done by Jake Studios. That went to uncurated for 150 tezos.
01:02:27.618 - 01:02:56.395, Speaker A: So Ms. Sun's doing very well. Here's Malayang Teatro, also by Jake Studios. This going for 10 tezos. And here you have again some, you know, just various devices. A cursor, some kind of cocktail there. And you know, bag on the head and targets and looking like the front of a video game here with the explicit and a computer.
01:02:56.395 - 01:03:32.857, Speaker A: Here is Runetoon with Cavity. What is going on here? So we have a photo where this figure who is drawn comes in, right? And like extensive animation looking like they are. And then having a smoke there. And then after their smoke, all sorts of smiles are happening. Background by Runtoon using Fujifilm, Adobe Premiere and Photoshop animation outlines by Runtoon using Procreate in Photoshop Color infills. By Cavity Stephen Kavanaugh on Procreate. So a true collaboration here.
01:03:32.857 - 01:04:03.553, Speaker A: So pretty cool. And none so edition of one and not listed yet. Continuing on Boo Boy on Ethereum reserve price of one eth. And here is the work and it is called the Pastel War. So cool illustration here by Boo Boy as we always, as we've been tracking here for at least a year and a half. Very cool artist listing on super rare. Very cool.
01:04:03.553 - 01:04:33.305, Speaker A: Oyo 66. The ultimate movie night. So this is on Tezos, interestingly, and that is where I got introduced to Uyo 66 is work, which is on Tezos. If you go to Uyo 66 history, it's super interesting. Oldest first and you'll see all sorts of brilliant, brilliant artworks. Actually this one's awesome. Crypto machine edition of 122 tazos.
01:04:33.305 - 01:04:56.547, Speaker A: So right. And so yeah, this is like a classic. OYO66 here on Tezos Crypto Machine. Love it. Katarina Create Visor Ferrari. So we saw this earlier, the white Ferrari. So a cool almost again game board design with the happy and sad faces going through them, almost like a Monopoly board.
01:04:56.547 - 01:05:16.003, Speaker A: And here again, loving these distorted figures. Not going for the right proportions on purpose. The small head, huge hands, very stylized, very fun. Really enjoy that. And look at these great shoes with a Ferrari with some kind of rainbow colors in the wheels. Awesome. Morandanga Republic.
01:05:16.003 - 01:05:45.369, Speaker A: This is by Flora Marquez. A new stamp. And this is another artist you're going to see from way back in 2020, 2021 making these awesome illustrations, these awesome stamps. Morandanga Republic. Let's see very quickly here what we find. And as you see, some true classics here as well from this artist. I mean, yeah, now I assume that was a new one that came out.
01:05:45.369 - 01:05:58.563, Speaker A: Yeah. Like this is a classic, right? Just gorgeous, gorgeous work. Let's just make sure that was new. Maybe it was an old one. October 9, 2024. Yeah, so it's back. So celebration.
01:05:58.563 - 01:06:27.685, Speaker A: Awesome. Here is Quampa Color composition study in Microsoft paint. So getting pretty elaborate here and zooming in a bit awesomely here for us to look up close. So very complex, abstract, mostly abstract composition, but kind of doodly at the same time. 3800 by 1500, only 1.6 megabytes. Interestingly, love these screenshots with the UI of what looks like the new Microsoft paint.
01:06:27.685 - 01:06:51.005, Speaker A: Gonz. An infinite detail. 35 Tezos edition of one. And here you see some sampled brushes making an abstract that is on Tezos. Here's Mumble Boy Hagakure. So another Here you can see collage with a little bit of experimental repetition here. Over top with this green shape.
01:06:51.005 - 01:07:12.023, Speaker A: Interestingly. And continuing on, Kristen Roos color bars number six. So continuing to experiment here with Kristen Roos with this abstract color research, as it's called. Edition of 15 for 15 tezos and three sold so far. Very cool artists. People of Tezos and Armilk. So this is our milk 88.
01:07:12.023 - 01:07:30.575, Speaker A: So this is AR milk doing a self portrait. Very cool. And love the different kind of shapes here. Really kind of nice how this patterning here is in contrast with its surrounding areas. Interesting colors too. Even this kind of beige background. And that is our Milk.
01:07:30.575 - 01:07:57.155, Speaker A: So that is addition of one for 25 tazos and still another 19 hours to go in that auction. Here's Element Li Bridge 2024. I think they put out Element Ly, I think puts out a work a day, if I'm not mistaken. A work at least one work at least. So here's the bridge and cool again, experimental pixel art from Element Li. The Mean Machine. This by Figments.
01:07:57.155 - 01:08:20.643, Speaker A: Where you see an interesting composition here. Love the streetlight. This could almost in itself be a composition. I think Kapn posted this or Figments posted this on X by itself. I thought that was a piece hilariously. And here you see the guy and the dog and that beautiful plant. Perhaps we're using Elements Interestingly, very cool.
01:08:20.643 - 01:08:41.412, Speaker A: And love this kind of universe of stars in the background. The Mean machine edition of 16 and 6 sold so far. Here's brain dead 1 bit pixel art version for Inktober. This is for Passport. Very cool. So futuristic looking passport. All dithered positive and negative versions here of the passport photo.
01:08:41.412 - 01:08:51.796, Speaker A: Very cool. Here's Low Trippy with Speak no Evil. Hello. Hello. So interesting. So dithered. So kind of like a 3D work that has been dithered.
01:08:51.796 - 01:09:11.833, Speaker A: Look at all the likes there. 4780 likes. I mean that is incredible. Good job, Lotrippi. And here's Zozo, a different Zozo Zoxo Bicycle. A pixel artist and sometimes doing very minimal works. Almost like the stars in Super Mario here doing a bike ride.
01:09:11.833 - 01:09:35.903, Speaker A: Very kind of experimental. This is open edition for another three days. Tezos 30. Here's Anis Abdin who they are just moving dots who has done some very interesting work. Trying to remember where in like, I want to say, like Hollywood movies or something. Anyway, very cool, ABS pixel artist.city day 281.
01:09:35.903 - 01:09:47.335, Speaker A: We are nearing the finish line. Anis Abdon. E Boy Arts. Interesting. Eboy Database So just putting some clouds, of course. Eboy Arts, a pioneer. A duo out of Germany.
01:09:47.335 - 01:10:05.061, Speaker A: Pioneers of pixel art. Nature's gift. Takashi, see if this will play. Okay, so maybe we actually looked at some of this already, actually. So here's the plant. I think we looked at some of this the other day, but it's a minute long, so we didn't necessarily see all of it. And.
01:10:05.061 - 01:10:23.549, Speaker A: But perhaps not. I mean, we did see something with Bosque. Grazias, right? So one raining day, 320 frames. Cool work by Takashi. And here is Dan Kelly. This is also in the fake whale art market. Very minimal piece to the point of abstraction.
01:10:23.549 - 01:11:05.183, Speaker A: Pixel art piece. You see where pixel art starts to get like, really like, this isn't just a cartoon, right? Like where it starts to become much more ambiguous as far as, like, is this an abstraction? Is this one of the dogs? Like, again, what I love about pixel art to a certain degree is it raises this question of how do I deal with this? It's kind of like seeing a great comic artist. It's like, how do I contextualize this within, you know, the larger tradition of art? So very interesting. Putting Pupper dog edition of one and sold for 150 tazos. Nice sale. Yuri J. Easy, easier chair.
01:11:05.183 - 01:11:33.137, Speaker A: So Uri J. Putting out a couple of minimal works of minimal versions of the chair on 8badoo, which is a platform that does 8 by 8 on tezos. Really cool platform. And it's probably important that people use this platform so that they keep keep it up. Because we saw with type art, if you don't stick with the platforms, the platforms will often go out of business, so to speak. And so. And I miss type art.
01:11:33.137 - 01:11:51.397, Speaker A: There were some works I wanted to make using that interface. So all to say, doing quite well. It is still urij season selling 13 tezos each for addition of 20. Here's another one. Little gas stove. So here's the gas stove small version. And this sold for 180 tazos.
01:11:51.397 - 01:12:13.697, Speaker A: Pretty amazing. So Urij continues to burn up the blockchain. Glitchtown Arcade 56. So cool kind of minimal artwork by Glitchtown Arcade using Nintendo Glitch ROM edition of one. And there is a bid of two Tezos, so you might be able to get that cheap. Here's another one by Glitchtown Arcade. Eclipse Zip.
01:12:13.697 - 01:12:28.805, Speaker A: And again, edition of one. And here it is. So again, Nintendo Glitch rom. Not sure what video game that's from, but very cool. At auction for 25 Tezos. Here is Rocco on The fake whale market. Game markets.
01:12:28.805 - 01:13:03.363, Speaker A: And again you see retro video games here. And kind of a scene, kind of combining a couple of the objects moving around on their own. That series with these kind of rooms that he would pan around and some palm trees in the background. Edition of one and unlisted and bite by bit with a cool GM surprise. This actually hasn't gone with its simplicity. So GM done by using Bannermania. Kind of a classic work here by bytebybit.
01:13:03.363 - 01:13:23.135, Speaker A: And very cool. Edition of one for 15 Tezos. Here's another one. This was picked up by first syndrome for 15 Tezos. BBB E3. Did we already see this? This is October 8th. This is a new one, as you see here.
01:13:23.135 - 01:13:35.185, Speaker A: Play the sound. Interesting. Made by 1988 Fantavision. Interesting. I'm not sure. Interesting. So Fantavision made that.
01:13:35.185 - 01:13:52.633, Speaker A: Not sure how that works. So Mika aladev, artifact number 91. Edition of one. This sold for 40 tezos. And Mika Eladev, kind of a cool, I guess you'd call it glitch. Glitch and pixel art basically combining here. And here's another one.
01:13:52.633 - 01:14:09.661, Speaker A: Artifact 90. This is 21 Tezos, I think at auction. Let me check. So wild, Wild works here. Addition of nine for 21 tezos and one listed on secondary. Selling out at 950. So nice sales.
01:14:09.661 - 01:14:39.079, Speaker A: Cool work by Acid Boy. A little bit of a different one, isn't it? So a little bit of texture kind of a little bit. So Acid Boy is starting to push his own limits, interestingly. And here's another one by Lena Eckert. And here, let's see if we can get this plane and do this. And here, just an interesting kind of minimal abstract work here by Lena Eckert. So very cool.
01:14:39.079 - 01:14:52.715, Speaker A: As we see here. As I speed through it a little bit. It is a minute and 16. So interesting piece. Prismatic Reverie, part of the Forget Me not collection. Available on foundation. Here is Kiro.
01:14:52.715 - 01:15:12.207, Speaker A: And here is another video painting. Let's see. It is on foundation. We'll see if it loads up Again, struggling with Internet today. Here is another one and we'll see if we can go back to that other one. This one's on Object and it's called Bent with rad lettering. And that is seven tazos.
01:15:12.207 - 01:15:24.845, Speaker A: Only seven tazos. And here's the other one. This one's on foundation. And there it is. And what is this one called? Slash. So very cool there. Here's Ex Mortal with a beautiful work.
01:15:24.845 - 01:15:47.991, Speaker A: Edition of 13. And more beautiful distortions here. And more pictures of the Seashore or videos of the seashore and waves coming in which seem to work really well. Glitched VHS loop and other. This is everything that is being used here. So a ton of exporting. Interestingly, Renki Higashi Toyama.
01:15:47.991 - 01:16:01.423, Speaker A: So a couple of new works here by Renki. As ever, very cool. The red grid and here's the white grid. Mizu Hashi and then three smaller spheres. So just endlessly experimenting here. Here's another one. Eraser head.
01:16:01.423 - 01:16:37.175, Speaker A: Never seen this in the art market. We'll see if there's any. We'll see if it plays first of all and then we'll see if there's any volume Know there is kind of sci fi. Kind of looks like Alien first movie or was it the second? I can't remember. Alter 4. This is an edition of One and Not for sale yet. That's by Eraserhead.
01:16:37.175 - 01:17:12.529, Speaker A: Here's ivan Hugo GMSunflower GLB. And here just an interesting. So GLB is a 3D digital sculpture file as you see here. And so I can control it in the sense I can turn it around. Interesting GLB kind of abstract, but not kind of see pixelation there. Just kind of a Wild Work Sculpt VR Sandbox Special Drop for Tazos Tuesday Edition of 10 for 250 Kapita with some works here too. And here you see what looks like AI, doesn't it? See, you can read.
01:17:12.529 - 01:17:41.251, Speaker A: If you can read the language of AI, you go first you'd know Kanexapata makes a lot of AI. So that would be your first suspicion. But then you'd start to see and it may not be AI, by the way, but then you start to see little kind of distortions and how the pixels aren't perfect perfectly square. And then even in here and you start to go, I think this is AI. It is getting harder to tell. So yeah, made. This video was made using midjourney.
01:17:41.251 - 01:18:09.605, Speaker A: Okay, so it's a video interestingly. Maybe it's not plain interesting. And here's another work by Ken Xapata. And this sold for 20 Tezos edition of one. So wild AI video here, isn't it? And this kind of unimaginable kind of pixelated rainbow. So really pushing the AI. And here looks like almost like Niagara Falls.
01:18:09.605 - 01:18:25.013, Speaker A: Here is what this is based on. Pretty wild. That sold for 20 tezos. Cool AI artwork. And here's one more by Canikzapita just posted on X with a little more texture on this one. Interestingly. And speaking of texture, here is Skomra.
01:18:25.013 - 01:18:44.205, Speaker A: Thanks So much to absurd deity for collecting Eruption on auction today. Awesome. So here is. It looks like a mountain on the sea. I either think of. I think of a couple of places. I think of Aetna in Sicily, right by Taormina there, between Catania and Taormina.
01:18:44.205 - 01:18:59.407, Speaker A: Or also in Santorini. Is it Thuria? Anyways, let's continue. White Solitude disco ball. So this is AI. I'm pretty. Put it this way. I've always known White Solitude's work as an AI.
01:18:59.407 - 01:19:14.681, Speaker A: As an artist that makes AI and has done some pretty painterly works with AI. So pretty impressive, I would say. Here it is. AI artwork by White Solitude. Euphoria. This Dr. Lee NFT picking this up.
01:19:14.681 - 01:19:35.945, Speaker A: And again you're seeing these incredibly looking like. It's getting pretty persuasive, isn't it? The brushstrokes here and that sold for 50 tezos. Nice sale to Dr. Lee. And here is Lily Illo with some cool AI paintings here. Kind of different one with the figure in the glasses and the two eyes. These, you know, AI distortions.
01:19:35.945 - 01:20:00.115, Speaker A: And continuing here is Toques with some. With a wild kind of landscape work and all those beautiful colors. And this wild sun really coming through the trees there. I thought this was a brilliant work. I feel like I've seen it before. This is by this account called Blank, which you've probably seen by Lola Dupre. So I guess the artist is Lola Dupre.
01:20:00.115 - 01:20:30.639, Speaker A: I thought I've seen a lot of these kind of AI computers. But this one kind of captured, you know, with the massive keyboard, kind of captured the AI distortion, so to speak. Here is Human Boy, remember? And some. So a new work, or I think it's from last week actually. A work by Human Boy made in Mid journey, edited with GIMP edition of 5 for 10 tazos. And here is Skomra, a more easy subject matter to digest. Great textures here as ever from SCOMRA.
01:20:30.639 - 01:21:04.065, Speaker A: And that's one edition of one at auction for 30 tazos. And here is Mikey Wilson Waiting Room Blues. So another AI painting here, this time by Mikey Wilson, continuing with the guitar series. And look at how huge this painting is really, you know, if you want to learn the language of AI, though, you see these little distortions here. Like this is what it looks like up close right here is as you see, you know, so you start to be able to recognize it quite clearly when you zoom in. Addition of 10 for 10 tezos. And look at this.
01:21:04.065 - 01:21:33.635, Speaker A: Eight sold. Nice work. And here is Little Cakes Ashes to be semi reluctant Goodbye. And it looks like One was sent to me, which is awesome. And so I think this is celebrating two years on the blockchain for Little Cakes. Of course, Little Cakes was just on our spaces a couple of weeks ago, which was fascinating, actually. And so who knew that paper mache had difficulty burning? I did not.
01:21:33.635 - 01:21:47.439, Speaker A: My friend needed a little help. Now his ashes are going to Uruguay. So is this AI? Because I figured it was. But maybe this is a. Okay, AI. It is, I think. Or maybe a combination of video and AI is probably what it is.
01:21:47.439 - 01:22:08.037, Speaker A: That's probably how you get that transformation. Interesting. Here's another one. I arrived in Tezos late 2021. So here's a still version and a one sent to Kels and one kept for the archives there. And so celebrating two years on ham, as far as I understand. So very cool.
01:22:08.037 - 01:22:20.869, Speaker A: And here, finally, more difficult, challenging art here. No Hygiene. And eight. So here we go. Cool. AI artwork now is this. I sometimes wonder if these pixels are AI.
01:22:20.869 - 01:22:36.115, Speaker A: I mean, last time I asked or heard from no Hygiene, it's like this is all raw AI. So I assume it's still the case. And there's absurdity. Picking one up. For 25 days I was patron of the arts. As we go into the physicals. Donnie O'Donnell.
01:22:36.115 - 01:22:58.685, Speaker A: Interesting. We've been following this artist for a very long time, and there's something I noticed on this one that's different. And can you see it? It's hard to see its texture. We're starting to see a bit more texture and it's adding a pretty cool dimension to this work. You can kind of see it here if it, you know, I understand it's probably small. Here we go. Now you can see it.
01:22:58.685 - 01:23:18.325, Speaker A: Interesting, isn't it? It kind of gives a different vibe to the work because it was so much about those outlines before. So interesting. Here's Rune Christensen. Very interesting artist. Had a show here in Berlin. This one's curated by Joachim Official. Interesting Flowers for Stuttgart.
01:23:18.325 - 01:23:36.579, Speaker A: So very interesting. This is probably a great artist list here. Interesting, interesting. Bookmarked and liked. Yeah. So there's a couple of vases and likes to use these kind of. Instead of the classic orange or brown background underpainting, we'll use almost like a neon orange.
01:23:36.579 - 01:23:59.985, Speaker A: Great technique and lets it bleed through a little bit, as you can see there. Very powerful and does kind of bring a. Give a kind of saturation to the entire work of brightness. Beautiful still lifes there. David Hales watercolor in ink. A very nice piece here. And there's up close on some of this Work as you see, very talented watercolor artist here and very kind of surreal.
01:23:59.985 - 01:24:22.725, Speaker A: It's not gallery. Sasha Yazov. So again, kind of looking like a video game or something. Like one of these 3D video games that are painted. I love it. Again, we're traveling through the mediums here. We're taking something digital and then we're putting in the context of painting and all of the connotations that the history brings and it just transforms the work.
01:24:22.725 - 01:24:38.305, Speaker A: Very interesting. Sasha Yazov, I think, was the artist. Adam Lister Studio 10 Michael Jordan paintings. So I believe the rookie card of Michael Jordan. And so here are different versions of Michael Jordan. Awesomely. I wonder if these are all from.
01:24:38.305 - 01:24:49.875, Speaker A: This looks like a Fleer basketball card. And that also looks like a basketball card. Gorgeous. Look at the colors. They really knew what they were doing with the basketball cards too. Faymo is dead. This was interesting.
01:24:49.875 - 01:25:11.407, Speaker A: It was based on a meme. I don't want to show too much of it for copyright, but here it is. That's the point is there's a meme here that Famo is dead was commissioned to make or recreate just a scene from it. This woman in a jet. Here's another work.
