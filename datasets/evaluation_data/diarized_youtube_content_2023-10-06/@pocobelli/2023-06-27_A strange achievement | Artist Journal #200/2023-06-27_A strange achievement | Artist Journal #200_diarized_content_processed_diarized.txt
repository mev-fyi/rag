00:00:05.360 - 00:00:42.754, Speaker A: It is a strange achievement. We have achieved 200 episodes, you and me, my friends, from deep in inner space. Sometimes pirate ship flying through the sky, sometimes cruise ship. But we are here and we are real. And I welcome you back to this one of a kind show. Artists Journal, June 27, 2023, broadcasting from the cruise ship in my mind as we sail through the summer here in the sky. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back again, improvising as usual.
00:00:42.754 - 00:01:35.356, Speaker A: A little bit of preparation here and there, some thoughts here and there, but basically one big improvisation for you and for us and for all of our edification here. And it wouldn't be possible without all these artists here making these incredible works to give us something to talk about. Otherwise, we're not talking about anything other than pontificating about abstractions, which sometimes has its value. Anyways, welcome back and thank you for all the support and love that blew my mind from, you know, I started this very briefly last May. I think it was August 10, so it hasn't been a year. It's been about eleven months. And I have to say, I never expected the reaction that occurred along the way.
00:01:35.356 - 00:02:06.944, Speaker A: And it's really been heartwarming. And some people say Twitter is a dark, scary place. I gotta say it's. And sometimes it can be. But overall, I have to say it's been an incredibly positive experience. Maybe it's, you know, the bringing art lovers together. It's people of a certain, you know, flair, shall we say, coming together and discussing beauty, which is something that we should go deeper into.
00:02:06.944 - 00:03:07.420, Speaker A: There are some very important, you know, metaphysical, philosophical theories on beauty. Particularly I am thinking of plotinus the enneads. I think it's three eight that we need to discuss at a certain point, so let's just file that away on the shelf for future reference. These are profound ideas that we have to engage in at some point soon here. Speaking of profound, look at Ed Marolla with this gorgeous work here to celebrate and begin our 200th episode with this hilarious work. It was actually unknown collector that had posted a tweet saying, what a great, interesting social commentary. If you're not paying attention to Ed Marolla, what are you doing? Anon, as unknown collector said, who will be a guest, by the way, in a couple of two or three short weeks on the Twitter spaces.
00:03:07.420 - 00:03:37.782, Speaker A: And we have another huge guest coming up tomorrow, so lots of exciting things going on. Ordinals, bitcoin. There's too much to do, and I am moving, my friends, but we will continue on here. So I believe it's called guy looking porn at the gallery. And so that is the title. And so here's the beautiful work. And I actually made it big for us on this initial one so we could actually look up close, because that is one of the things we like to do here.
00:03:37.782 - 00:04:07.290, Speaker A: And it's actually quite illustrative. So it's not massive, this file. So we could make it a little bit bigger here. But you do see, and I believe this is what's going on here. This was perhaps if I had to theorize what was going on. I mean, first of all, there's the great social commentary, as unknown collector was pointing out. There's the guy with the Tazos hat, seemingly looking at racy images on the phone and beautifully, you know, done.
00:04:07.290 - 00:04:49.224, Speaker A: And then maybe a devil guy smoking as the work, looking on. Spectral devil figure in high heels looking on, you know, in the gallery here, this beautifully painted wall. You know, I think this might be my favorite part, but if I had to theorize on what's going on, because I don't know if you can see it, maybe I can even zoom in some more. I can. You see, it's all dithered here. And Ed Morolla left us a big, juicy clue about three months ago on this idea. And a couple of times also other that I believe what Edmarla is doing is working in procreate.
00:04:49.224 - 00:05:28.992, Speaker A: If I had to theorize and then bringing it, I believe, could be wrong, I believe, into aseprite. And that's where you're getting this dithering, where there is a plugin, I think the dither plugin, which is lost away somewhere in my bookmarks. And so I think that's what's going on here. So the dithering comes later. It's interesting, we're seeing these incredible works by Santiago, these abstractions. I'm starting to wonder if that's also this kind of post dithering, we might say. So, a beautiful work here, and an interesting painting, actually, in the painting.
00:05:28.992 - 00:06:03.614, Speaker A: And you just have to love how roughly painted this frame is. But then again, almost all that roughness, it contrasts, you see, all this looseness, as my friend would call it. It contrasts with this, you know, mathematical dithering, we might say, this geometrically precise dithering. So it makes a beautiful contrast here. And we just even, just like the shadows, the looseness, one has to love the looseness. So a beautiful, beautiful work here. I believe unknown collector picked this up.
00:06:03.614 - 00:06:28.710, Speaker A: And look at the floor. It's just so quickly done. It's so beautiful. And the color, importantly, unknown collector for only 125 tezos, which is less than $100, maybe about $100, put an offer in after an hour. And so great collect there. And beautiful work. It's one of those paintings.
00:06:28.710 - 00:06:54.410, Speaker A: It's so rich, right? Like look at the wall. So. And of course, Ed Marolla is also building credibility because of his prolific prolife, pro profligacy, I think is how we put it, being prolific. So look. And here we go. Procreate and aspirite. So more confirmation, more evidence of our theory here.
00:06:54.410 - 00:07:26.778, Speaker A: Let's continue on. So I'm thrilled, and I'll believe it when I see it. I confirmed with art matter yesterday. So this is happening. Thrilled to welcome the incredible art matter with ox eye, who I think works with or for art matter, to this week's spaces. Come hang out with runetoon and myself to hear the latest developments in pen and paint plotters from the cutting edge. So I would not miss this one for the world.
00:07:26.778 - 00:08:10.304, Speaker A: This. If you are an artist, if you have artistic ambitions, if you make any kind of digital art ever and have any kind of ambitions, you have to attend this. You have to attend this. This is the cutting edge, as you can see here, of the transition from digital. One of the ways, one of the many ways that you can transition from digital to physical and look at what they're doing here. So it's, you know, again, art and technology are deeply linked from the very beginning. The tools, right? The tools.
00:08:10.304 - 00:08:42.368, Speaker A: And this is the cutting edge of tools. Until I see otherwise, or until, feel free to leave a comment if you see more cutting edge than this and go to art. If you don't know who artmatter is, go to their twitter and you'll see all sorts of incredible things. Of course, they worked with Zancane, with the pen plotters to great effect, charcoal and more. So I can't wait to see where that one goes. That should be incredibly exciting. Thank you, everybody, for the support on yesterday's show.
00:08:42.368 - 00:09:07.072, Speaker A: Ahec. Big shout out. Pirate ship, cruise ship, museum or gallery of the mind, as long as the format isn't changing, will continue to support you on this educational, informative and thoughtful journey. So big thanks to AHEC and big, big thanks for the collects and everything and just the comments. And I'm glad you're enjoying it. No plans. The cruise ship is in my mind, so it transforms instantly.
00:09:07.072 - 00:09:33.868, Speaker A: And I imagine at some point in the future the cruise ship will be taken over by a pirate ship. So it is sort of a summer cruise. I'm putting on my white pants and putting on the yacht rock and kind of putting my feet up here as we sail through the summer in the sky here. And also Andre Blues. So the Grim Reaper. The Grim is inspired. Remember the Grim Reaper playing the violin in yesterday's beginning.
00:09:33.868 - 00:09:57.858, Speaker A: Opening image the Grim Reaper is inspired by avenged sevenfold song title, a little piece of heaven. So that's interesting. So perhaps that is a unique idea on Andre Summer blues part to put a violin in the hands of the Grim Reaper. What an incredible image that was. And thank you for the show. You're welcome. Already booking my ticket for the cruise ship.
00:09:57.858 - 00:10:19.984, Speaker A: Big shout out to retro Manny and to Tom Bombadil. Thank you all. Quick interesting. I thought this was hilarious based on what I answered, Retro Manny. The main reason people collect on art on Tezos is investment opportunity, entertainment, support and connection. They don't anymore. I put investment opportunity kind of.
00:10:19.984 - 00:11:05.936, Speaker A: It's just like for me, I just see such unbelievable value in this art. You know, I'm. My take is as long as IPFs, the international Protocol file service, or however that's ifPs, maybe as long as that doesn't fail and you can back up those images also using club NFT. As long as that doesn't fail and the Tezos blockchain remains secure, which I don't see why it wouldn't. I don't see how this art doesn't appreciate at some point. I see the same classicness that I see in golden age comics that I see in 1970s hockey trading cards. And on and on.
00:11:05.936 - 00:11:36.360, Speaker A: I could go, there's a classicness to this scene. So I kind of rushed to press on. Investment opportunity, but this is quite heartwarming. Support and connection, 54%. So very interesting from Retro Manny and I thought this was kind of a funny addendum to that poll, to that survey. When they said diversify your portfolio, they probably didn't mean diversifying between multiple hundreds of illiquid artworks asking for a friend. Absolutely.
00:11:36.360 - 00:11:54.528, Speaker A: I believe I am over diversified into illiquid artworks here, so let's hope it pays off. I mean, who knows? Let's hope so. I just thought that was. It's funny because it's true. So again, unknown collector in mid July. So that is super exciting for a Twitter space as well. Heads up there.
00:11:54.528 - 00:12:47.868, Speaker A: Patrick Amadon discoverability. This is also a bit of a Jack Dorsey word. When he was running Twitter, he talked about the challenge of discoverability. Patrick Amadon Discoverability is a critical issue in the space and it's only becoming harder to find art and artists with the sheer number of platform and chain options we have available to address that, we're building a monthly exhibit that gives every artist the chance to share one work and it will be easily visible in a gallery on join XYZ platform and chain agnostic. Whatever work you feel you want seen. No price limits, but only one work per artist. Ideally, this will become a resource for collectors to discover new artists and help artists highlight work they want seen, leading to new relationships by cutting through opacity of chains and platforms to just focus on the art, which is what we love to do here.
00:12:47.868 - 00:13:11.736, Speaker A: So here is the join XYZ. So I guess it's a part of object one. I was surprised to see this and there's only 4 hours left, so if you're watching this, you might just drop everything and try and get to this website if you haven't. But it sounds like it's going to be monthly. I haven't signed up. I haven't had. Yeah, so time is of the essence.
00:13:11.736 - 00:13:28.434, Speaker A: Antidote open call. So here it is. And here are all the submissions. So very cool initiative here. And it's kind of like a big, why not? I mean, so very. And again, you can just scroll through and scroll through. I'm still waiting.
00:13:28.434 - 00:13:59.118, Speaker A: Yeah. So let's see what happens with object one. Let's see what happens. Because here you actually see the first signs of object one actually opening up, where all of a sudden it's like, yeah, we could do a curated show where anybody could put a work in a one of one and then we'll show it on the site. So maybe this is the first signs of object one opening up. So to becoming a more open platform that is exciting outdoor activities. Yuri J with a beautiful work here on super rare.
00:13:59.118 - 00:14:28.530, Speaker A: So continuing with the surreal, you know, I guess it's a landscape. It is a landscape because you see this beautiful sea here in the background with almost like a bit of a coast. And then here you see a soccer field and or football, as they say in England and Europe. And a ping pong table, table tennis. So we're international over here. And some beautiful patterning. I just thought it was a beautiful composition.
00:14:28.530 - 00:14:51.884, Speaker A: Instantly recognizable as Yuri J's style. Outdoor activities. I mean, a really cool and fun work. Kind of has a bit of a vacation feel to it. But sports, I mean, we see basketball here too. And interestingly, I mean, I kind of miss this here. This is kind of an interior that is simultaneously an exterior.
00:14:51.884 - 00:15:25.944, Speaker A: So psychologically interesting. Quite interesting, I would argue. And, you know, the psychology of architecture to a certain degree. And sports itself is a fascinating and underutilized theme. I mean, myth to his credit, has done a couple of tennis works, but there are, I mean, what is the name of that artist? I'm not sure if I can remember the name here. Jonas. I want to say he's with Gagosian.
00:15:25.944 - 00:15:49.554, Speaker A: Jonas Wood. Okay. And then we'll put like, I believe it's tennis courts. Yeah. This wonderful series here. So this is Gagosian, artist, probably the most famous gallery in the world. And you see here the use of tennis and sports iconography as subject matter.
00:15:49.554 - 00:16:01.398, Speaker A: Sports as subject matter. And there's Abu Dhabi. I mean, very, very, very cool. Look at this stuff. Beautiful paintings. Oil and acrylic, 88 by 66 inches. Interesting size.
00:16:01.398 - 00:16:32.706, Speaker A: So that's 2.2 meters by 1.67 meters. So this brings about another interesting question about scale. As a friend of mine said, a painter friend, and we both went to the University of Saskatchewan and took some art classes together. And he made an interesting comment that one of the professors had told him, you know, when are you going to move beyond student size for artworks? You know, this sort of like, you know, 0.6 by 0.4,
00:16:32.706 - 00:17:00.196, Speaker A: or maybe a meter by 0.6 meters. You know, you need to make something bigger. And it was just very interesting to hear him reference smaller works as almost like, quote unquote student size. And here you see another example of that, Jonas Wood, you know, 2 meters by 1.67. You know, that's professional size is one way of talking about it. I mean, we have to remember the persistence of memory is a 30 centimeter wide painting, too.
00:17:00.196 - 00:17:24.644, Speaker A: So take that idea with a grain of salt. But it's an interesting idea. This is grand. This is grand. So these are from 2021 and huge paintings which, do you know, the alchemy of scale, as I always say here, it does impact the aesthetic experience. So continuing on. So that is Jonas Wood.
00:17:24.644 - 00:17:44.028, Speaker A: And that's just a hint of some of the sports works for tennis courts. Very cool. Continuing on. So we have a few works here by Yoznier, who goes under occurrences on instagram. And so some new work here. And we haven't looked at. Let me put these in order here.
00:17:44.028 - 00:17:57.230, Speaker A: So we haven't looked at Josnier's work for a while here. So these are some recent works on super rare. And this sold in February. So this is part of a new series. This is for. .1 oh, no, sorry, that's someone else.
00:17:57.230 - 00:18:25.888, Speaker A: This was just transferred to someone. So private sale. We don't know how much. So here is just a series here by Josnier, and there is a new one that came out recently and just a really interesting illustrator who has his own style and almost has a bit of a tarot card feel to it. Like the rider tarot deck a little bit. And just a really interesting original artist. This came out June 26, so just came out.
00:18:25.888 - 00:18:54.782, Speaker A: And this one came out June 26, and so the last three have come out just yesterday. So another one, again, kind of a rider tarot deck feeling, but still completely its own thing and has a legion of collectors here. They're all being transferred, probably for private sale. So a very cool series here called shadow work by Josnir. And they're again, kind of surreal. Surreal. Illustration is almost a category you could put together.
00:18:54.782 - 00:19:27.814, Speaker A: Kaposage chained to glory. And this is a new one, classic kaposage. Colors and mayhem. Look at those wings, those wings made of hands, which I have never seen, almost in this pepe green. And this is quite beautiful here too, with the flowers and the snakes. Really careful. Again, these hugely ambitious compositions with these almost, you know, these are almost like the plague doctors from way back when with these kind of bird hats.
00:19:27.814 - 00:19:59.100, Speaker A: More big snakes that almost look like fashion brands colors here, designer snakes, we might say. And there is a little bit more in the scarf here and the interesting orange sky. So just a ton going on here. Let's see what's going on. 26.99 on secondary edition of ten and sold for accepted offers of twelve tezos on primary. And there's Mikey Wilson again, Moda Mt with a new digital work.
00:19:59.100 - 00:20:24.070, Speaker A: This came out a couple of weeks ago and I didn't see this one. Secrets with death. And I believe this is a digital painting. And you see butterflies and another grim reaper type figure here with the scythe and almost like windows. Butterflies over here and a massive amount of butterflies here. So interesting, kind of mysterious, kind of has a 19th century feel to the whole thing. Digital painting.
00:20:24.070 - 00:20:42.854, Speaker A: So it is a digital painting. And that sold for five tezos on primary and is now off. You'd have to put an offer in on secondary. Here's another one by Moda Mt. P ad PI a dad. And so this is a physical. So I didn't realize Moda Mt made physical work.
00:20:42.854 - 00:21:25.636, Speaker A: And you can see it here, 60 by 73. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish, but maybe I can translate here. No, translate on the actual post, but you can see the work here. So pretty cool. And again, that looks like pastiche because I'm sure I've seen this figure here before in another painting in, you know, maybe 18th century, 19th, 17th, not sure. And then really interestingly, paint it here so you can see it's a physical, but is it? Maybe it's a digital that's printed because you see these little hang things to hang it on. Unfortunately, I can't read this.
00:21:25.636 - 00:21:53.932, Speaker A: Maybe this was printed onto a kind of canvas of sorts. So I'm actually not sure if this is physical. It actually looks like it's digital printed on physical. I'll have to work on my spanish to work that out. Continuing on, Dan control with playing with kitsch, as the first of this series is called, the first one to land will dominate the scene. So kitsch, all animals. So this is part of the all animals series.
00:21:53.932 - 00:22:19.716, Speaker A: And here we have some butterflies with beautiful gradients. And so combining also this plant interpretation of plants by Dan control using gradients. An interesting background there, almost kaleidoscopic. So interesting work there from dancontrol. One left for eight tazos after that at 65. So Dan control continues to build. And check this out.
00:22:19.716 - 00:23:01.404, Speaker A: This is a collaboration called hallucinogenic plants with RICTC Ricardo. And we'll see the name in a second here. They have a cool kind of trailer, so pretty cool ad, actually, for art. And you see some of the gradients there, and then it looks like they're going to be processed by Rick RTC. Very cool. That sounds promising. There's a famous book, actually, there's a Golden book, which is a pretty conservative publisher by Richard Schultes, who some of you might know called hallucinogenic plants.
00:23:01.404 - 00:23:25.924, Speaker A: And it was just a little golden book. And it was actually. It was very scientific. It's kind of before it all got politicized, I think it came out in maybe the fifties, early sixties. And so just a heads up on that. That's what that kind of reminds me of Lydia Moon with another portrait here. Aria is so part of kind of the Lydia moon's mythology here, shall we say.
00:23:25.924 - 00:24:00.530, Speaker A: So another just kind of interesting artists to follow here on tezos, with kind of an elf creature here and some sparkles and emoons. Interesting background, too. Gradient background available on primary for seven. Tazos wasteman gold Mineovich, food of the future gates food paste. It's all you got. So there's Bill Gates there and a. So it's a bit of a satirical work here and showing how food in the future, according to Bill, will be Bill Gates food paste.
00:24:00.530 - 00:24:23.802, Speaker A: Maybe made of insects, too, wastemen. So, anyway, interesting work here available for two tazos six left. Nice portrait of Bill Gates in there, by the way. Pamelo Cerrone. I hope I'm pronouncing the name right. Cerrone, il Grande Esploratore. And so Pamelo is starting to put out a lot of works here.
00:24:23.802 - 00:24:46.778, Speaker A: A lot of great one of ones. Kind of reminiscent of Flora Marquez when she was putting out all those. One of ones. There's lots of opportunities to get cheap. One of ones here with some really nice work here, as you see this river and these people on a riverbank here, and just kind of having fun. Available for 25 tezos, $20 for a one of one by Pamelo Cerrone. I don't expect that to last very long.
00:24:46.778 - 00:25:23.660, Speaker A: And a new one from demon ego, June 2023. Paper collage. This is a physical, available for eight tezos. There are ten left. And here we go. So again, using the notebook structure, this was just minted. And these beautiful colors here, these beautiful colors, which I wonder how demon ego is able like, is this spray paint that is put on, is this printed gradients? It's very beautiful, isn't it? These works that are collaged in here, and then these nice checkerboards and everything.
00:25:23.660 - 00:25:56.454, Speaker A: A great, interesting artist here. We think we rise, we see us fall. Demon ego. So we looked at this already on Twitter, but I just wanted to say, if you're looking for this, it's available on object. This great work by RJ. Beautiful, kind of, I believe, probably AI source of what I again am tempted to call spectral pastiche, with a pixel art rendition on top of this AI remix. Really cool work here at the gallery.
00:25:56.454 - 00:26:27.030, Speaker A: Cool post here from Goyong arts. Just another. I mean, once you have your process as Gohyong does, you can just apply it to anything and everything. And that's what we see here with this beautiful cheetah from behind. And again, the masked pixelation, the beautiful illustration, all combining together with a beautiful background there, too. And making a great work that I had never seen before. I find this hilarious because it takes a while to load, as some of Santiago's works do.
00:26:27.030 - 00:26:53.694, Speaker A: So I wonder how huge this one of one by Kurt Hussle collective is. This iconic phone number now, at least in our community. 1900 1997 900 call now. So again, a iconic message in the Tezos art community here from Kurt Hussle collective. One of one. Maybe you can put an offer in. I don't think it has been sold yet.
00:26:53.694 - 00:27:37.648, Speaker A: This kind of went around a little bit. Euphoric vomit by Semha. And I thought it was a pretty cool work. And here just a very colorful, you know, almost like psychological representation of vomiting and this person, you know, with their, almost like a psychedelic trip here and the eyes are going around the head. Just a beautiful work actually. And continuing on, pixel dealer with work I missed in on June 7 edition of ten for only 18 tezos, I mean pixel dealer, when I first got to tezos, if I'm remembering, maybe it was pixel fool, but pixel dealer and pixel fool both sold for quite a lot of money. So there, while are opportunities there.
00:27:37.648 - 00:27:54.000, Speaker A: Really interesting. A artist, cool abstract for $14.43, pretty low edition. Let's just see what it sold for. On primary, sold for 13. So it's basically selling almost at primary. So a lot of deals there.
00:27:54.000 - 00:28:56.850, Speaker A: Max Drecker with a new series here, I think extraction and playing with the horizontal lines and so just kind of a cool abstraction here and experimentation. Animated abstract by Max Strecker, available for five tazos. Ten left Santiago with a couple of more. So pumping out these really cool abstracts now, I was mentioning how maybe Santiago was bringing this into aseprite after, but I'm not so sure anymore because this looks more like even, like he may have created this program. It looks like one of those JavaScript programs, or even one of the programs. Look at how beautiful that is. Maybe it's, it could be, you know what it looks like to me, it looks like some, like one of these JavaScript programs, like remember where you could drag the faces and make works out of the faces? I think it was called the waffle draws.
00:28:56.850 - 00:29:29.274, Speaker A: This looks like waffle draws, but then maybe it is dithered after, because look at in here, in the top yellow here, it's like there is no stone unturned, there's no pixel that is left unturned here. Everything is what we might call geometric. Everything has been dithered in the end. So that does make you wonder. So very interesting. It feels like there's a couple of things, a couple of exports going on here. And so this is an edition of 20 for five tezos each, and there are nine left.
00:29:29.274 - 00:29:55.460, Speaker A: This series is quite popular and it's wearing well with time. Here's another one edition of eleven at auction for six tezos. And here we see more of those Andre butzer faces, and shout out to Santiago, who just actually put out a tweet. Thank you for telling me about Andre Butzer. So it was an accidental similarity, we might say. So another just really interesting. Unique.
00:29:55.460 - 00:30:26.566, Speaker A: It's not easy being unique. These are unique abstracts. How easy is it to, like, how hard is it to make unique abstract artworks? I mean, it feels like it's all been done well, not yet. Muji, with this gorgeous work. I was happy to pick one up, floating, colorful. And you know, I remember Muji, it was only a few months ago, who was so thrilled to be just seen alongside Sabato. And here you look at Muji's market and selling out of everything.
00:30:26.566 - 00:30:50.516, Speaker A: Things are going for quite a high price. And now just increasing the addition to 20. Was doing mostly additions at ten. I'll show you very quickly. So, as you can see here, not much that's available cheap. You know, I remember this one of one going for 125 and thinking that was impressive. Now it's starting to feel pretty cheap for a one of one.
00:30:50.516 - 00:31:28.072, Speaker A: This is awesome, this connection one. You see these lower editions though, so these low editions, it really does make a difference in terms of the price, the secondary market, doesn't it? I mean, to state the obvious, here's a one of one for 77. Interestingly, here's another one for 102. But I think people have a bit of a bias for these deluxe paint. Again, the dithering and the pixel art really, really just resonates with everybody, or with the public, with most people. So, a new one by mech txt. This was minted in June, so I don't think June 3, I thought this was new.
00:31:28.072 - 00:31:52.164, Speaker A: So I don't think we've seen this yet. It's possible we've looked at this a few weeks ago. We're returning to it again. Mech. TXT returning to this continues to do the dynamic pixel art, moving pixel art. And so again, playing with the classical themes and the landscapes here. And here's another beautiful work here with this really great palette.
00:31:52.164 - 00:32:10.642, Speaker A: Lunch break. Color studies, a pilgrim back to my roots. Look at how gorgeous this is. So, you know, mech TXT making it look easily easy. Nice little border there and everything. Just mint and money with these things, because they're beautiful. P one and explainer gallery so continuing with the Trader series.
00:32:10.642 - 00:32:36.646, Speaker A: And here we have a couple of a mouse and a cat, maybe playing with cheese and fish. And they are trading with this kind of mainframe here or this server farm. I mean, how cool is that? So p. One, a renowned pixel artist on tezos. Cool background too. So, so simple. That's pretty funny.
00:32:36.646 - 00:33:15.970, Speaker A: And it goes for a minute. So that is pretty cool. And is that sold out? It is not listed yet. Green ginger with a cool kind of minimal work. I quite like the negative space in this one work cycle. Wake up take a shower, prepare for work, commute to work, work, go home, repeat with a park, a pond, in a convenience store to maintain the mental state. So almost here is your entire life in a 45 degree angle perspective from a bird's eye view, your entire life in architecture in an almost like a gated, community type style.
00:33:15.970 - 00:33:57.282, Speaker A: You never have to leave. Maybe that's the future. Only a Tezos 80 edition of 30. A new one by Spiegels Maskinen continuing the journey series, which celebrates the car. This one was beautiful, just driving along the road and the day turns to night. I was wondering to myself where the original, like, I don't know too much about blender and all these 3d modeling softwares, but it does make you wonder. I was like, are these coming from car commercials? Are these being sampled? Or are they just original constructions that you can make using this 3d software? That's how little I know about 3d rendering software.
00:33:57.282 - 00:34:34.704, Speaker A: But what's also interesting about this is it looks like it's using Spiegelsmaskinen's previous process of objects that are moving around and doing things and kind of have a life of their own. And he also dithered them before, but it's like he's taken the dithering to a whole new level. And so it feels like there are two layers of process here. The first is the 3d rendering and the second is the dithering. So again, using more than one process, which I think is a powerful thing to do. Look at those great stars too. Edition of 25.
00:34:34.704 - 00:35:02.160, Speaker A: The offers are coming in at 25 40. Amazing. And here's Tazo's art collective doing signatures, the artist's signature collection. I'm way behind on doing mine, myu signature. And just kind of a cool. So there is the signature up there, the video game, and there's street fighter. So cool pixel artwork here with the skeleton riding one of these old school arcade games here, which I miss.
00:35:02.160 - 00:35:16.368, Speaker A: I remember those when I went to university. So that is for $7.90 on secondary, continuing on. Interesting work, I believe. Gogolitis. Or maybe it was popple who retweeted this. I think it was gogolitis.
00:35:16.368 - 00:35:44.006, Speaker A: Metalink stream reloaded. This is by pixel gems for 1.88. I'm not sure if this is a one of one or not. Not used to the exchange art. Let me see if there's no volume. So interesting kind of pixel artwork here. Very colorful, kind of a guy in a arcade once again, seemingly, if that is what that is.
00:35:44.006 - 00:36:06.582, Speaker A: Meta link stream reloaded, maybe in some virtual reality here. Too. And maybe you're seeing what the person sees, what the guy sees here, perhaps another interesting work on Twitter that I saw here. This is by Cenk, freshly minted and listed for auction. Digidoodle number nine. Interesting. Just kind of novel abstract here.
00:36:06.582 - 00:36:35.272, Speaker A: Again, kind of has that video game vibe to it. And that 45 degree angle looking down diagonally on the scene. And looks like, again, some stuff representational, but kind of turned into a large abstraction. Interesting work. Continuing on figments, with a very cool title here, actually, the subtitle is what I liked, kernel panic, which sounds very cool. Kind of a cryptic title there. C zero r three is bigger than zero one.
00:36:35.272 - 00:37:10.940, Speaker A: I love this work, though. And it kind of feels, again like these works by figments, aka Kappan, aka plants, aka Kappen's gift shop. They seem to be going somewhere, don't they? So just very cool, minimal, technological, you know, themed abstractions here. Cool animated abstracts, pixel art. Beautiful, you know, cappen, more great work here. Also bite by bit with some kind of really cool experimental. It works with pc paint 3.1.
00:37:10.940 - 00:37:43.172, Speaker A: And you can see just black and white abstractions here would hang well, I would argue, with Santiago's black and white works and with his abstractions, they are, again, they're all using. We're kind of back to this pixel art idea they're all using. You know, they share in common this square brush, so to speak. And so a cool one of one for $7.23 from Byte by bit. Here's another one. This one is sold, I believe this one is sold for nine tazos.
00:37:43.172 - 00:38:11.732, Speaker A: So again, very cool, simple abstraction here. You know, just. It's interesting to see, again, they would hang very well with Santiago's works there. Recano. So, playing again with the 3d software here. Here we have what looks like a McDonald's in Thailand, and a menu, and maybe going through the drive through. Nice kind of orange sports car and some palm trees.
00:38:11.732 - 00:38:36.824, Speaker A: So it's hard, you know, what's not to like in all that? Just kind of fun and cool from Mercano and just kind of shifting around as usual. Edition of five available for 20 tezos on secondary. Sold out for eight on primary. So very cool. And speaking of objects that are kind of discombobulated. Lorna mills with chatticode. Interesting title.
00:38:36.824 - 00:39:05.828, Speaker A: And almost a living object here, too, with the dryer kind of spinning out of control from Lorna mills. Kind of cool pixelation here and everything, kind of almost. So it's interesting to see how the mask is gray here, which kind of throws you off a little bit. And you can almost see, like, the background coming in a little bit. Interesting work. Interesting, interesting piece by Lorna Mills. Chatta code available for 35 tezos on secondary edition of 20.
00:39:05.828 - 00:39:29.574, Speaker A: Edition of 20. Hosua's gamma continues to experiment with the glitch rom, really putting her own flair on it. So here's a person with some just noise. Glitch noise in around with the interesting kind of background here, too. Bright green background. Edition of 15. There are 13 left, so not getting all bought up there at once.
00:39:29.574 - 00:39:44.798, Speaker A: Animated Rom zero two. Quite like this one, too, of a cat. So just cool. Variations on the Nintendo glitch Rom process. Glitch process. So eleven left at three tezos. And here's another one.
00:39:44.798 - 00:40:03.664, Speaker A: Animated Ram zero three. And here is someone with a computer head. And again, just kind of cool. Interesting colors here. And there are twelve left. Mason III with a. I believe you'd call this a glitch Rom, but this is more of a different kind.
00:40:03.664 - 00:40:35.524, Speaker A: Let me just bring it up here, see if there's music. There is. And let's just see if that plays. We may have to let it go because time, even though it is the 200th episode, you get the picture. I wish this would play, but this. You know what this possibly is? This is possibly my computer running out of space rather than the Internet. So I'm not sure we're going to solve that here and now.
00:40:35.524 - 00:40:57.144, Speaker A: So I will hit pause. But Mason the third. Here we go. It's pretty cool, actually. Mason the third has great music. That is pretty cool. I love that piece.
00:40:57.144 - 00:41:12.844, Speaker A: That's a one of one that really. I'm glad we got to play that. That is a one of one for 100 tezos, $80. Pretty cool. PlayStation one corruption made with hex editing and rom corruption tool. Very cool. One of one.
00:41:12.844 - 00:41:30.744, Speaker A: DJ Curo with a work here edition of ten for only a tezos. So just cool. Kinda analog video glitch work. And so nice textures and everything. Kind of abstract ecrock. So very cool. And there are ten left, so they are still available.
00:41:30.744 - 00:42:15.294, Speaker A: Sky Goodman, a change in the valley again. Combining probably several technology exports, as sky likes to do. So just cool kind of video analog glitch with some also all sorts of stuff going on that I don't even know because it also looks like some of the AI works, or at least the color from some of the AI works is coming out, so. Or as a source. Video feedback kind of looks like remixing a change in the valley, maybe remixing previous work, but it's in this analog video union series edition of 20 and sold out at seven tezos. And a cool work by Osborne. I don't think we've seen a Casio, a red Casio watch yet.
00:42:15.294 - 00:42:36.034, Speaker A: I have a Casio, actually, so this one resonated extra, but the red is pretty cool. I wonder if that's Osborne's invention, the red. And here is Osborne's name in the watch. So classic here. Just interesting GiF work. And Clownvamp continues to mint from the series. And this one here is quite beautiful.
00:42:36.034 - 00:42:59.224, Speaker A: Really looks like a kind of homage of sorts. AI homage to Edgar Dega. And so that is pretty cool. And that was minted yesterday. Yeah. Link. Likely inspired by Edgard Degas work recording the Paris Opera Ballet, Charles began a new fascination with male dancers starting in 1890s and continuing on to his death.
00:42:59.224 - 00:43:27.682, Speaker A: So, as we know, Clownvamp is what I call a visual novelist. And he often creates these kind of stories through many paintings, as we've seen. And this one is probably called Chester Charles, or is based on this character, Chester Charles, which is the name of the series. And there are now seven works in the series, and they're selling quite well. Here's another one, Daniel 1927, from the same series. And I brought this up. There is an offer of 1.8
00:43:27.682 - 00:43:48.914, Speaker A: ETH, not taken yet. $3,381. And you see here, I want to show just the brushwork that we're seeing from AI art. You see it there. Just beautiful textures that we're seeing here. And again, who does this look like? Maybe voyageur, or maybe a touch, maybe Vuillard. Edouard Vuillard.
00:43:48.914 - 00:44:07.770, Speaker A: Just interesting. Maybe we have a clue here. I don't see an artist listed. So a very cool series here from Clownvamp and one by Lily. Illogical how your music makes me feel. So this is released on object. And this is an edition of ten.
00:44:07.770 - 00:44:28.434, Speaker A: And again, playing with the shapes and the people and the kind of beautiful wood background here. Probably raw AI. There could be some artwork by australian artist Lily Illo in collaboration with AI. So maybe a little bit of editing there. Very cool. And Richard Nadler with some cool AI here. We haven't looked at Richard Nadler's work for a while.
00:44:28.434 - 00:44:45.046, Speaker A: Just an interesting landscape here. So a lot of novel imagery coming as a result of AI here. And I thought this was quite poetic by Zoom. Look at this. Searching for self. And it looks like a labyrinth of sorts, some kind of maze. A beautiful, beautiful work.
00:44:45.046 - 00:45:02.654, Speaker A: And I love the poetry of the work. And the color is also beautiful. So just really nice work. Edition of nine and they have been burned. So maybe it's a one of one. Now. Shall we see, shall we see edition of nine? So maybe only one burned.
00:45:02.654 - 00:45:35.420, Speaker A: Okay, got it. One burned, so available from Zoom, but not listed yet. And finally, Martin Joe, a huge supporter of this program and of the Kinky Bear series with a very cool work here. I hope it plays sort of one of those. If Martin Joe didn't make it, nobody would have made it. So just cool, I guess. Video art and using AI.
00:45:35.420 - 00:45:55.068, Speaker A: And it's an open edition, only one has been minted. It's very reasonably priced. Pilot bear, join the trip. I love it. And you see here, there's been a few open editions here, and there's a one of one here. So sometimes you get lucky, like this person, so you can get some very nice slow editions. Another one of one was playing with abstraction.
00:45:55.068 - 00:46:09.204, Speaker A: We looked at a couple of these pieces. We also looked at that. So anyways, Martin Joe, big shout out and thank you for watching. Thank you for being a part of this journey, my friends. And until next time, see you at art matter tomorrow. Most importantly, until next time, take care.
