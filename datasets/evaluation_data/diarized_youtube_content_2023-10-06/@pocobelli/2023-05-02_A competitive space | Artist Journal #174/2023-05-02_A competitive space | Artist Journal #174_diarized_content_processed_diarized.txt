00:00:04.760 - 00:00:44.590, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody, to the pirate ship of the mine that continues to sail forward to unknown places, to undiscovered countries of the mind and the imagination. Artist journal, May 2, 2023. Broadcasting from inner space in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and this mad show continues. I continue to show up here all the, you know, it really does feel like, you know, again, in. In my mind, like, this really is just a ship going, you know, to unknown territories. And maybe that's what makes it funner.
00:00:44.590 - 00:01:13.940, Speaker A: Maybe that's why I keep showing up. One of the reasons, and, of course, for you, dear viewer, the much appreciated for all the support so far, the likes, the comments, just the watches, the time. So thank you for that. And in that spirit, I think I have a shorter show, but for real this time. I am putting a very strong effort into cutting this show to 30 or 40 minutes. I think it's best for everyone. So, anyways, let's go and look at this.
00:01:13.940 - 00:01:47.522, Speaker A: So this awesome, awesome artist. I think the name is goyong arts. We're gonna look again. I hadn't seen anything for a while, and I thought maybe since the sheep, if you remember the sheep, like, two or three months ago. And so finally, I just was like, have they not released anything? So I went back and they've released a ton. So we're gonna take a quick look and get an update. This is maybe from a couple of weeks ago, but one of my favorite artists in the space, so original, brilliant use of pixelation and everything.
00:01:47.522 - 00:02:27.274, Speaker A: So let me remove so. And even the frame and even the sound. And this pixelated butterflies. Again, I just, you know, I marvel and I go, I would have no idea how to make something like this. So that is awesome. Interesting decisions, too, like, say, with the frame here, how it gets kind of fuzzed out, you know, which seems to be keeping with their style of this kind of distortions, what we might call, like, digital distortions, you know, pixelation being an example of that here and there. And then, you know, and then you just look at the pure drawing, which contrasts so beautifully with that pixelation.
00:02:27.274 - 00:02:43.164, Speaker A: And the pure drawing itself is beautiful. So we have an extremely talented person here, and the market has been rewarding it. And look at these great butterflies. Half pixelated, half not. So anyways, just beautiful. Let's just do this. Do this.
00:02:43.164 - 00:03:01.416, Speaker A: So, again, and you make it smaller. And it looks good, too, like, and it looks, like, even kind of better and etcetera, like, it looks great, too, is what I'm trying to say. Look at this. Offer of three. And it doesn't look like it was taken. Now, sometimes what happens is the person waits too long. Oh, no.
00:03:01.416 - 00:03:14.978, Speaker A: Sinister. Accepted. Offer accepted. Three ETH. So, I mean, real money, $5,200. Not bad at all, you know, well earned. That being said, here's some.
00:03:14.978 - 00:03:39.982, Speaker A: Here are some others. So I'm going to try and keep more tabs on goyong. This is from March 4 that it was transferred, minted on March 3. Got an offer of two and a half ETH. So $3,900. So goyong arts is making a nice, you know, bit of cash here. And, yeah, just, you know, really beautiful and smart art.
00:03:39.982 - 00:04:32.936, Speaker A: I'm a big fan of this move. So it looks like a race car there. I'm a big fan of this move that I see, you know, rat cloaks, he also does it with just this kind of flat sky. And maybe this is, like, done in a different way here with Goyeong arts, because it's almost like that is the underpainting, but here in these areas, then Goyeong maybe adds the dots on top. So it's all, you know, it's strangely simple, one could argue, you know, but then you add the animation, you add the pixelation, which really is the secret weapon, in my view, on these works, because it creates that awesome contrast. And you know what it almost looks like to me. And again, I'm not an expert in kind of video, but it looks like a pixelation filter has basically been painted on.
00:04:32.936 - 00:05:15.348, Speaker A: It's been masked. And so all it does, because you see the race car here, which is going to come through, it becomes pixelated when it goes through the pixelation here, which suggests that that's some kind of pixelation mask in maybe Adobe after effects or something like that, a software I haven't used that much. So anyways, another gorgeous work here. And here is another temple. And this came out in February. So, you see, I miss all sorts of stuff. One of my favorite, favorite artists here in this scene, which I only recently discovered, you know, and probably a lot of you who already know this artist are thinking, why is he never showing this art? I mean, this is fabulous.
00:05:15.348 - 00:05:36.742, Speaker A: Look at this. The audio. I mean, super cool. I mean, I just came from Berlin, you know, gallery weekend, and I'm like, this is awesome. What we're looking at here. I don't, I don't know if I had that kind of reaction. I had some, like, you know, again, like the air, people in the airplane seats.
00:05:36.742 - 00:06:05.898, Speaker A: I thought that was, you know, the word that came to me after, it's witty. I thought it was kind of witty, but I didn't have like this kind of like, oh, my God, that's awesome sort of moment that I'm having right here with temple and this, like audio, like so. And this is just one of four works that we're looking at. So this one just came out here. April just came out. April 7, transferred to Ann Vault. I wonder if that, wonder if that's Ann Laramie there, perhaps.
00:06:05.898 - 00:06:34.826, Speaker A: And so no price on there. We'll see what the, see if there's audio on this. There's always audio. Beautiful night scene. And I think let's look at the bus here and see if my, see, it looks pixelated. So I think my theory is not bad on how this is being done. There's another seeming filter here with the cat's tail.
00:06:34.826 - 00:07:10.624, Speaker A: You can see almost kind of like a blurry kind of filter similar to the frame that we saw. Similar to what we saw in the frame in the first. Waiting for you. I mean, so a digital poet here, goyong arts. We will do more over here. I will do more to make sure I follow Goyong arts because that is just such cool, exciting, fun work. Speaking of which, and I thought this question came to me last week as I was actually prepping for the Flora Marquez show, how have NFTs changed your art? And I just kind of love that question.
00:07:10.624 - 00:07:41.692, Speaker A: And so that is going to be the topic of tomorrow's spaces. And so there is no special guest other than you, dear viewer. So come in. Your chance to, you know, work your public speaking among friends, meet some cool people, and worst case scenario is just me and runetoon hanging out. And that's wonderful, you know, so come hang out on tomorrow's space has got actually some pretty nice traction here so far. So thank you for that as well. I will pin that up right now.
00:07:41.692 - 00:08:20.294, Speaker A: And so, yeah, if you want to check that out just on my page here. And, yeah, just discussing how NFT technology may have, you know, altered the direction of your art, you know, because I'm making work that I wouldn't have made otherwise. I was making digital before, but say, my little pixel art sketchbook, you know, that's something that I was really just like something I wanted to make for object, you know? And so, yeah, so it's really interesting. I think it'll be an interesting discussion. So check that out on tomorrow's spaces that will be live at 09:30 a.m. Eastern standard time. Thank you for the comments.
00:08:20.294 - 00:08:35.234, Speaker A: I thought this was quite funny, actually. Gogolite us an open edition on ethanol. That's an idea. I have an open edition scheduled next week, but is on Tazos. Thank you, Adrian, for showcasing my work. I think there's just a lot of money to be made here. Go go Litus.
00:08:35.234 - 00:09:05.928, Speaker A: And I still think so. Like, I mean, I don't know what the number would be and people are much better than I am at pricing stuff, but I mean, you put it at like 0.01 or 0.02 open edition with a Gogo Litis, you know, pixel art factory of sorts. I could see that going gangbusters there. And thank you, everybody else, for the comments. Rosatio, Joshua, Stalka, Vinny, Bombadil, Rada, and Andre.
00:09:05.928 - 00:09:39.812, Speaker A: Summer blues also was watching, so that was awesome. So I totally appreciate summer blues is here. That was great. So it makes me so happy that the artists like this show, that a lot of artists like this show. And just on gogolitis here, since we were discussing gogolitis and doing well, look at this number four on object here with the pong, I think, pong delivery system. So gogolite is doing well. Let's just take a really quick look and just see the pong training system.
00:09:39.812 - 00:10:01.634, Speaker A: And you see what happens when you start selling work, then you start to sell other work. Cause then people check out your other work. So it really pays to just kind of have a steady stream of stuff coming out. But, yeah, it did really well. 56 on primary here. Taking from offers, I believe one person got it for five. Okay, maybe that was secondary.
00:10:01.634 - 00:10:17.532, Speaker A: These are probably primary. Anyway, continuing with our short shows here. How are we doing? We're doing well. So this is quite interesting. Sotheby's metaverse marketplace. Sotheby's launches secondary NFT marketplace. So this sounds like a direct competitor to super rare.
00:10:17.532 - 00:10:35.304, Speaker A: So look at this. Artists first, fully on chain, two and a half percent fee. Kind of like object there. Artists royalties, that's really cheap because I think super rare, like, it's at least 10%. I could be wrong on that. Correct me if I'm wrong. If anybody knows, this seems really low.
00:10:35.304 - 00:11:20.684, Speaker A: Artists royalties enforced at the marketplace's smart contract level, highly curated. So I wonder, yeah, I wonder if you'll be able to buy this on Opensea, these works now. Highly curated. So what's interesting about this? I'll show you in a second. What's interesting about this? You know, it'll be interesting to see how well that goes for Sotheby's. I mean, if anybody, it's going to work for one would assume it's Sotheby's, but aggregator of one of one's cross marketplaces, interesting content focus, defend and promote artists above just offering for sale. So is Sotheby's moving into the gallery space? In a sense? Like that's what these platforms have kind of replaced to a certain degree.
00:11:20.684 - 00:11:48.668, Speaker A: So that is kind of interesting too. So that's Michael Buhana, who is VP and head of digital art and NFTs and contemporary art specialist at Sotheby's. So interesting. And that is an exclusive that was released to NFT now. And there's something else I wanted to show you in here. So this is quite interesting. Sotheby's will also establish a new digital art gallery through the web3 art gallery platform.
00:11:48.668 - 00:12:52.714, Speaker A: They're going to use oncyber, which is interesting. Which interesting. That's great for Oncyber, I would say, which will exhibit select works from the secondary market. For the cyber gallery launch, Sotheby's metaverse is partnering with well known digital art collector Cosimo de Medici, who will curate one of the gallery rooms to feature a selection of works from their famed collection. So they're going to start with, you know, Tyler Hobbes X copy, Claire Silver, Deanna Sinclair, so kind of, you know, more popular, you know, what we might even term like so far, seemingly canonical artists within this scene. So that'll be interesting. I mean, like, don't forget, in a sense at least, my theory of what happened with super rare where object, where the people were putting out so much good art, like super rare, had to kind of like, and this is just a theory, maybe that didn't happen at all at HQ, but it seemed to me that they kind of had to start onboarding because there is too much talent in the, in these open platforms.
00:12:52.714 - 00:13:17.548, Speaker A: And you're going to see another look at this, just another comment relating to this fellow artists. I know you're concerned about the future of the space because super rare currently only has three live auctions compared to 59 on foundation. Like, that blew me away. That is like a 20 x. Okay. Engagement seems to be lacking. So now it's a tough market and they're different.
00:13:17.548 - 00:13:51.238, Speaker A: But you see the. So it's just kind of interesting. It'll be interesting to watch, right? Like in object one. Like I haven't seen too much activity. So again, they could have opened that up to everybody and still could in theory, but I mean, they may have other plans for it, but it's just kind of interesting to continue to watch this kind of open versus close look at foundation again, who you needed an invite at the start. Then they started letting other artists give them ten invites and now it's just open. So interesting.
00:13:51.238 - 00:14:17.722, Speaker A: You know, there is a free marketness, free marketedness to object and foundation because it's just pure market. There are no barriers to entry. And one wonders if that in the end will produce the best results. You could make the argument so far, it could be made. I mean, it would be very debatable and contentious, but you could make that argument. Luciana Guerra, look at this. Just having a stellar month here.
00:14:17.722 - 00:14:53.474, Speaker A: Another month starts on April. I had an excellent balance. Look at this huge exhibition at a national art museum, exhibition with fake whale. My art selected at an art biennale. My art selected for a national salon, hope to have more amazing at a national salon, hope to have more amazing achievements, or at least working hard to follow the same path. Thank you all for being with me in this crazy dream. So dreams come true in this scene, more common than in others is kind of maybe why I want to highlight that and look at score, also known as psycho, with a really cool just display here.
00:14:53.474 - 00:15:44.966, Speaker A: So I always like to turn off the music just in case of copyright issues. But my point here is look at, look at how grand this looks. I mean, this is like, you know, wow, that is quite the, you know, light installation courtesy of score or psycho. So anyways, pretty impressive projection, right? So yeah, pretty cool. I mean, the music just looks like it's accompanies the visuals that are like overwhelming. And again, scale when it's digital art massive is incredible. You know, oftentimes the isolationist, I like this title, influencers dissociation.
00:15:44.966 - 00:16:27.074, Speaker A: So kind of a dark title here. And yeah, I mean, isolationist has always had kind of like a heavy kind of vibe to it, but really well done. And so just a really nice kind of abstract work, but seemingly a kind of figure here and maybe a couple of tiers here drawn on. So anyway, someone who's been around for, on the Tezos network for a while and deserves more attention on this show, a game of patience, influencers dissociation. Who has a great market, doesn't really need this show, frankly, selling for 30 tezos in addition of 20. And let's just see. And has ten left.
00:16:27.074 - 00:16:54.704, Speaker A: So anyways, but making a lot of money here and doing well. So anyways, cool work from isolationist. And the myth has made it to the COVID of Playboy, at least on the myths, in the myths imagination. So the man, the myth, the legend, and all sorts of stuff here. Psilocon Valley, psilocybin, all sorts of. So pretty funny work from the myth here, as usual. So this is a one of one for 300 tazos.
00:16:54.704 - 00:17:17.804, Speaker A: So let's see how long that takes to go. Pretty reasonable for a myth, one of one. And I'm sure you can guess who this is. This is Debbie T with her land of cats, which is now on Bueno, NFt. That almost sounds like a Latin American. We're looking at this earlier and we'll go to the website. So anyways, thrilled to announce my new work.
00:17:17.804 - 00:17:47.634, Speaker A: Land of Cats is now live on Bueno, NFt limited edition of 30. I think they're 0.05 ETH. So anyways, just a very beautiful work, as one will expect from Debbie T, who clearly has some sort of design background. And again, I'm kind of back to that illuminated manuscript sort of feel here to this writing, which apparently does have meaningful. So anyways, a lot of fun here and just so expertly done and just gorgeous colors. And you wonder what this says.
00:17:47.634 - 00:18:06.686, Speaker A: So anyways, beautiful. And all these cats. And she has an explanation here, too, so you can check out her feed to get all the deets on this. Look at how great that looks, though. So anyways, I mean, there should be Prince Shunter. I mean, this is just gorgeous. I think she made a gicle once and it was gorgeous.
00:18:06.686 - 00:18:39.324, Speaker A: So here it is. This is on bueno art. So zero five, it would be nice if they could make it bigger. It's always good if you can make the art, you know, bigger. That would be my only sort of comment on that. But otherwise kind of looks like a cool platform. So it's a pretty competitive space, isn't it, these platforms? I mean, now Sotheby's metaverse, I mean, there's good money to be made if you can, you know, elbow your way in and become a place that artists want to display their work.
00:18:39.324 - 00:19:03.810, Speaker A: So. And kind of a vote for web3 at the end of the day with Sotheby's doing this, you know, they are investing to their credit. So people of Tezos have put out a bunch of new people in the Tezos ecosystem. So, Ezra Eslin. So I'm going to touch a few throughout this show. I can't show all because that would be pretty much all the tabs. They released a ton of them.
00:19:03.810 - 00:19:25.910, Speaker A: So I'm just going to show some, and then we're going to do an overview of the whole kind of series, which we can see small. Anyways, here's one by Ezra Eslin. A one of one. And let's just see here. So I guess that's Ezra. A self portrait of sorts with knives and blood coming down and cigarettes and a gun and a phone. So, yeah, that sounds like everything.
00:19:25.910 - 00:19:56.090, Speaker A: Ezra Eslin and just falling from the sky here. Interesting clouds. Hey, so. And just, it's quite interesting, her style, like, it's very interesting how she, like, total trademark, which gives it her look is by breaking up the lines like this, putting these little gaps in everywhere gives it her look and you just see it throughout. So anyways, really, really cool artist. And it's really interesting how she makes the blood. You know, there's no contour on the blood.
00:19:56.090 - 00:20:19.130, Speaker A: So her coloring is really kind of interesting as well. And just, you know, again, trademark. And here is another one by summer blues, I believe, Andre. So shout out. Thanks for the comment, Andre. And here is a brand new mint for 77 ETH on foundation. So I think this came out right after our show here yesterday.
00:20:19.130 - 00:20:36.230, Speaker A: And here's a. So this one's a little different. I think yesterday we had kind of a psychedelic theme. Here is a knife coming through. Someone almost has a bit of a medieval feel. And here's the heart, or seemingly so anyways, that is cool. And then the flower leads up to the sun.
00:20:36.230 - 00:21:25.816, Speaker A: So again, a very, just kind of psychedelic. So core liberation. There's almost an Alex Gray kind of like very, you know, indirectly. There's a bit of an Alex gray kind of feel to this. I can feel my inner self becoming stronger and more sure, with each stride, you know, these portraits of inner space as I take and I give to its undeniable, with each stride I take, as I give in to its undeniable appeal. So again, this kind of core liberation of the soul, Flora Marquez with an interesting kind of comeback, let's say, after a couple of days, taking a couple of days off, after four months, I mean, after 120 days of delivering a drawing every day. So coming back with some kind of refreshed and it is good to take breaks, you know.
00:21:25.816 - 00:21:50.856, Speaker A: And here, there seems to be a little bit of collage in here somehow, or screenshot. So this is an ill, you know, that's cut out or masked. So anyway, cool experimentation here. Starting to feel like a little bit of a surrealist direction. And really just this is nice, too, this figure, this bird figure here and everything. So very nice piece. Available for 20 tezos.
00:21:50.856 - 00:22:20.374, Speaker A: Again, incorporating what looks like a little bit of collage here. Reminiscent very, very distantly demon ego rosatio. So the first, to me, we must have said something memorable today. So anyway, it's just cool and mysterious and you see here. So, yeah, let's see what happens next with Florida Flora. Shout out to Flora and tornado. This is a really interesting work.
00:22:20.374 - 00:22:46.174, Speaker A: OMG, I drawed it and, yeah, so this artist here. So this looks like a portrait of the artist. Of course, this is also for people of tezos. So another illustration here kind of fit in our illustration section. And just a really interesting, cool artist that I'd never seen before. Synths and everything. Interesting colors too, aren't there? Even the planets hanging from the ceiling.
00:22:46.174 - 00:23:02.734, Speaker A: So, anyway, nice discovery here. OMG, I draw, edit or draw it. OMG, I draw it. So that was a one of one. And I don't think that's sold yet. Burka Bayram celebration. When he's gone, we'll all celebrate together.
00:23:02.734 - 00:23:35.340, Speaker A: I think this might be a reference to the election in Turkey, perhaps, where Berka is based. And so classic burka Bayram work. This is for a new series here. And so interesting, I was trying to figure out what these were because they're not quite fish, they're not quite birds. And then I just decided, I think these are just figures. These are shapes with happy faces on, I think is what's going on here. So anyways, this is part of a kind of new collection here, Museum of Wild and newfangled Art.
00:23:35.340 - 00:23:58.260, Speaker A: So buy now for ten edition of 50. And of course, burka has been on tazos since like, the beginning, practically museum of Wild and newfangled. So here it is. 50% woman. Founded digital museum with a pack of 342 new and emerging and established artists from 59 countries. Developed an AI curator, New York City based, established. So I've never actually seen this before.
00:23:58.260 - 00:24:40.938, Speaker A: So maybe these guys have been around for a while, but there's only two tapes, two pages. So you wonder to yourself, one wonders to oneself, is this kind of like, is this the equivalent of a gallery, you know, on a platform where you start to invite artists and, you know, so, anyways, kind of interesting here, and we're going to look at one of these later. And so here is just kind of the big picture. Of course, we cannot go through every one of these, but just to give you an overview here. So very cool. And I just always love, you know, the great Hasdrubal waffle, who is calling himself authentic waffles on this account. And of course, I mean, this, maybe some of you can recognize this.
00:24:40.938 - 00:25:21.784, Speaker A: I mean, it seems to be a shout out to the residents. So Hasdrubal never disappoints with his countercultural references. I'm always pleased that I can. I think I'm getting it right. I'm always pleased that I seem to be able to get a good portion of them, definitely not all of them, but it's a fun kind of game actually to play here. So anyways, of course the residents were the guys with the eyeballs for heads and the top hats. And they were kind of, I think they were out of Texas and they came out in the seventies and they were famously anonymous, as far as I understood, so kind of way ahead of the game on the anonymity front, kind of beating that trend by a few decades.
00:25:21.784 - 00:25:42.052, Speaker A: So this is part of the neat series neats. And this is neat 116. Let's just see. So this went to virtual real for only 30 tezos. Wow, good. So sometimes says drupal waffle will do like two hour like auctions. What was this? Yeah, see, this was 515 and then 715 it sold.
00:25:42.052 - 00:26:14.432, Speaker A: So he plays with the mechanics. A lot of selling nfts. Here's the resonance, by the way, you know, if we're not going to show the residents now, we'll probably never show them. So here they are. And they just kind of capture the imagination, kind of, you know, I want to say a very, very underground version of Devo is almost what I'd say, but not quite, but kind of. Again, it's almost like if they were artists, you could hang them on the same. In the same show, you know, if it was a group show, but quite different.
00:26:14.432 - 00:26:32.792, Speaker A: And I never got like super into the resonance, but I had one album and there was a couple of songs I actually really liked. I think I had this one and I guess, you know, oh, wow. Co founder, dead at 73. Wow. So I think they. I thought they were still together. They're one of those bands that'll probably never break up.
00:26:32.792 - 00:26:55.450, Speaker A: So anyways, that's the resonance counterculture kind of lore for you, courtesy of authentic waffles. And here's neat 115. I do not know the reference here. If there is one. I assume there is. Nice. You can see there's a different program or a different brush being used here, and then you can even see the brush over here, seemingly.
00:26:55.450 - 00:27:17.064, Speaker A: So interesting work. And often Hasdrubal will do screenshots. So maybe that's like the brush in action here. Really interesting work here, as usual, as we expect. Interesting background too here. So cool work from Hasdrubal waffle went to not a number for only 27 tezos for this one of one. Again, another two hour auction.
00:27:17.064 - 00:27:45.180, Speaker A: Very interesting. Rinnefish reshared this in her stories on Instagram. This is an artist called Andrea Diesnin. And I just thought this was a really cool work. Original, kind of very soft, the, you know, treatment here and just kind of fuzzy. It almost looks like physical, but it's probably digital. And just maybe a woman on her phone and these stars coming out.
00:27:45.180 - 00:28:07.464, Speaker A: Just a really original work here. I've never heard of this person, but, I mean, they have 19,000 followers on Instagram, so they're doing quite well. And here's just a quick overview. So this one really stands out. Beautiful, beautiful work. And look at this. I thought this was quite stunning, the painterliness of this axin work that he posted, chatbots making friends.
00:28:07.464 - 00:28:34.884, Speaker A: And I thought this is quite beautiful. Like, look at the brushwork in here. So sticking with these beautiful brushes that euxine has. And this here looked extra painterly. And there's another thing that I really liked, and that's the color, the color here. So deviating a little bit from, say, the darker, what is it, purple and black and green, and then adding this pink is quite beautiful. And it goes quite well with that neon green there.
00:28:34.884 - 00:28:51.554, Speaker A: So nice work. And this is for people of Tazo. So Oxyen has joined the party here with the people of Tezos. And there is axine on an old Mac clicking. So a pretty witty work here as well. And some noise here and a pirate flag. That is beautiful.
00:28:51.554 - 00:29:08.110, Speaker A: It is beautiful. So it'll be interesting to see how much these go for. They seem to go for quite a lot. Like, I was doing this, like, I think in the last round that they had. And I was quite surprised at how much these went for. They're quite collectible. So it'll be interesting to see how much these go for.
00:29:08.110 - 00:29:36.846, Speaker A: I think we have a few more here. Bezaya, you know, who's been on since May 2021. So a rare kind of self portrait of bzaya with the trademark colors here and the flowers and this beautiful sky in the background here. So that is super cool. And the adidas with the Gucci logo or Gucci adidas logo. So anyways, just very cool from Bzzaya. And Astra de la creme with a nice work here, too.
00:29:36.846 - 00:30:06.706, Speaker A: So just a few people of tezos here, and I think she works physically. So I suspect this is physical, but I'm not positive. Tezos sun here, and an infinite image here, as you can see here with the nouns glasses, and then holding the phone infinitely. And here is gloom tube in the. I thought this is quite hilarious. Who's also on the people of Tezos. So this is a portrait of gloom tube at the laundromat or in a washing, seemingly.
00:30:06.706 - 00:30:19.018, Speaker A: Right. And so here is the laundry, you know, the washing machine. Or this is the dryer stack. Dryer. Gloom tube. Gloom two and gloom tube laundry. So I thought that was quite hilarious.
00:30:19.018 - 00:30:40.506, Speaker A: So anyways, let's see what these go for. Here's another one. Guandanarian, who put kind of a pixel artish work, again, kind of makes these pixel art factories along the lines of gogolitis and cream safa. They would all hang really nicely together in a group show. Interesting eye here. I think that's an eye. And continuing on.
00:30:40.506 - 00:31:11.370, Speaker A: And here's one of Sabato. Interesting self portrait of Sabato here. So seemingly using deluxe paint, almost for sure with the trademark animal whose name I can never check, Capi Baras, which I think is like a brazilian animal that is endangered. So anyways, there is Sabato. And I thought I brought up. Let me just bring up quickly the people of tezos. I'd love to show everybody here, but they released quite a few.
00:31:11.370 - 00:31:28.404, Speaker A: So we're going to show Danielle King. And we showed. Yeah, so we're actually going to show Sky Goodman. So we're going to show some others. But anyways, I just wanted to give everybody an overview so you can kind of see the others. There's native edges and Casper and others. So anyways, Strano.
00:31:28.404 - 00:31:45.744, Speaker A: That's funny. So anyways, okay, continuing on, and we're gonna continue to rush through here. We're doing well. Gamma check from Mech TXT. So this is just a new series here. 69 unique small cards, gacha, 50 static cards and 19 animated ones. They all sold for zero two.
00:31:45.744 - 00:32:08.662, Speaker A: ETH sold out. And here they are. So that's pretty cool. So really cheap. And as a result, selling out, because who doesn't want a Michael Macasso for zero two? So that is really cool. And so here is the series. And this looks like it's going to come out by Manatel sometime today with a reserve of only 1.5
00:32:08.662 - 00:32:27.018, Speaker A: sol. And let me see if I can get this going. See you this night on exchange art. So a really nice waterfall piece. This was on Instagram here, courtesy of Manital. So just a cool pixel artwork. And continuing on, John April 30, 2023, Sunday best.
00:32:27.018 - 00:33:01.114, Speaker A: So here's another in the studio studio visit. And here seems to be the artist covered in flowers with a beer and chilling out. So anyways, another studio shot from John, edition of 25 for 50 tezos on secondary. And here's v four w anko with kind of a cool, I think we could call this generative art. So just kind of a cool piece here. Could hang with a lot of artists that we know here. Rp 24 clean ISO surface transformations voxel pattern media GIF 1024 by 1024.
00:33:01.114 - 00:33:31.566, Speaker A: So, yeah, just interesting. And acidboy laboratory number ten. So, of course, you know, for a lot of artists, that's what tezos can be, because of the cheap minting and everything. It can be your laboratory, in a sense. It's kind of like a laboratory of sorts for me as well, if that's what acid boy meant by laboratory here. Anyways, the master of psychedelic abstraction is back with this very interesting shape, seemingly almost impossible shape here. So interesting work there.
00:33:31.566 - 00:34:09.164, Speaker A: And of course, McHX with a reserve of 0.2 on this work here. And this is list. This was minted yesterday. So again, playing with this kind of abstraction here that is moving, animated, abstract, very minimal, having some color field sort of vibe to it. And I think AI may be used in here as well. You see, the effect is quite powerful, you know, and it's just a beautiful, you know, for me, a beautiful extension of the color field, you know, tradition, really, for lack of better term.
00:34:09.164 - 00:34:48.596, Speaker A: So part of a collection called Les Reve artificial, artificial dreams. And this is also in the Museum of Wild newfangled Art by augers. And I thought this was just kind of a nice, almost impressionistic work here, but it's kind of glitch by augers. So it looks like a woman in water, perhaps. Just kind of nice colors and everything. Artist Henrik Kartako, I think augers multidisciplinary video artist from Brazil. A happy day at the beach, made with processing for each frame, is digitally painted with data from personal archive photographs, finished with video editing software.
00:34:48.596 - 00:35:11.390, Speaker A: And here's Sky Goodman. See if we can get this working here. So this is also for people of Tezos. So this is cool. I really like this project because it forces artists to do a self portrait. Like, I think that was the first time I ever did like, actually, maybe not the first time, but one of the first times I'd actually done a self portrait was when I. When I was on this.
00:35:11.390 - 00:35:27.902, Speaker A: So, anyways, let me see if I can get this playing properly here for sky. So, anyways, cool work. A very cool portrait of Skye Goodman here. Very nice piece. And turning around. I like this kind of background, too. And the foundation and this interesting square.
00:35:27.902 - 00:36:16.148, Speaker A: So anyways, another piece for the people of Tezos. And continuing on, look at this by Tuks. You know, Tuks could easily just sit back and, you know, regenerate works that they've made with AI. But what I really like about Tuks is this continual push to develop and to push what, you know, different series and different ideas and here bringing in a flash, kind of glitchy flash into their work with this strange, you know, probably AI still life. So very cool AI artist, tuks. So one assumes this is AI and here, like it's off the chain, so to speak, illusory sky, also by Tuks, open edition for zero eight. So again, pushing things here.
00:36:16.148 - 00:36:49.258, Speaker A: So I'll stop that just in case people have flashing issues with flashing lights. But anyways, interesting experimentation from tuks. Here's a new one from Venta, Venta times AI the architects, which is kind of a cool title. And again, playing with these kind of what I always seem to call biomorphic figures here. Interesting anatomy here in everything. And so anyways, just really interesting AI work from Venta, as usual. So that is cool edition of ten for eight tezos, one left.
00:36:49.258 - 00:37:12.970, Speaker A: So selling well. And here's another, people of Tezos, Danielle King. So that's pretty cool. You wonder how close, I mean, this is. AI, right? So an AI self portrait, I don't know if I've ever seen that before, to be perfectly honest. Like, I assume people, you know, people have made AI portraits, I guess, of me in the past. So obviously people have done self portraits before.
00:37:12.970 - 00:37:30.534, Speaker A: But anyways, a very nice portrait here by Daniel King. Very nice self portrait. She's CFO and COo of club Nft. I didn't know that. I need to back up. You can back up your nfTs, I believe, with club NFT. So anyways, cool work here.
00:37:30.534 - 00:38:04.764, Speaker A: And look at Lily Illo with a new, I think this is new, I assume. But anyway, it's just really nice work here too, kind of this painterly style. So anyway, it's just a really nice piece here posted on Twitter. And here's Zayo Siwa, who we've been following, who's been releasing a lot of this kind of painterly AI artwork and just these interesting figures in a room. It's very painterly. Again, so just interesting work and just numbers as a title. And finally here, Kazuhiro Ihara.
00:38:04.764 - 00:38:49.950, Speaker A: This is with fake whale swept the doubtful grass, as we can see. So this is a digital painting. I kind of put it in here, interestingly, in my own mind with the AI art, because again, increasingly, AI art is starting to blend in, just like we're seeing digital and physical. It's starting to get more and more. The lines are starting to blur a bit. It's not as clear the distinction I feel over time, as things move forward. And here it's like this seems to work, this painting with this AI art that we're just looking at by like, you know, you see the painterliness here and you see by Zayo, right? So anyways, interesting work from Kazuhiro Ihara with fake whale.
00:38:49.950 - 00:39:09.346, Speaker A: So nice one. A beautiful painting, right? I mean, this very nicely done digital abstract. And here is headquarters number six. I love this series by home office. So again, very contemporary subject matter. So that is awesome. And, you know, very colorful piece.
00:39:09.346 - 00:39:27.978, Speaker A: Seems awesome with the colors edition of 1514 left. This was just minted. And here's Mark Belden again with a beautiful work that I had to share here. I was looking at the flowers earlier and then this was posted. I love this combination of colors. It's kind of neon orange with violet. It's beautiful.
00:39:27.978 - 00:39:38.244, Speaker A: So let's make sure we give that a light like. And that is your show, my friends. So hopefully I see you on Twitter spaces tomorrow. Thank you for joining me again. Till next time, take care.
