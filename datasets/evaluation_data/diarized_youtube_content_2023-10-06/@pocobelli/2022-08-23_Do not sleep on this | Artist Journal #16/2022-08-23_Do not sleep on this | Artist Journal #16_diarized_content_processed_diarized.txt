00:00:05.240 - 00:00:26.542, Speaker A: Artist journal, August 23, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. I am your artist reporter. Great Rauschenberg term, which we will go into in a future episode. But. But last night was a late night, so bear with me here. And it's probably gonna be a short one, hopefully.
00:00:26.542 - 00:00:55.954, Speaker A: I just thought I'd show some recent acquisitions because. Why not? Why not? I didn't see huge news. I mean, I'll show you actually something very quickly, and then we'll come back to Sumire. You see, I wish I could pronounce her name right. Very friendly person. I'll show you actually very quickly the latest on Louis Osborne because I think there's something interesting. Just quick update, and then we'll come back to Sumi.
00:00:55.954 - 00:01:31.434, Speaker A: So this is, you know, sold yesterday for 135 and 145 to the same person. And so this isn't exactly what it seems, because then he came out on Twitter and he said, I'm going to list these for 280 each, which I believe he did. Yep. Two at 280. And all the profits will go to towards buying more art on tazos. So you're seeing what I'd call, like, rampant speculation now. So.
00:01:31.434 - 00:02:06.028, Speaker A: Which gives one pause. And so anyway, so just a little kind of note. I'm not saying it's good or bad, but it does. You're seeing heavy speculation now because assuming that you're just automatically going to get 280 for this, great as it is, is a pretty big assumption. I mean, speaking of recent acquisitions. And then we will go back to the great Sumi Ryusi, like, for 280, I mean, for 325. And I'm.
00:02:06.028 - 00:02:52.394, Speaker A: Again, I'm running out of BTC here, but I just can't help it. I mean, to get a one of one gloom tube, I think I paid 350. So if you think you're going to get 280 for an edition of 25 when you can get a one of one gloom tube, you know, it's just like. Maybe, but it's just very speculative is all I would say on this. So just a quick update on that, just so you know what's going on over there, interestingly, very quickly. And then, you know, it's funny how these videos go along quickly. Just looking at the activity, though, I want to point out something which I think you can write a master's thesis on, which is artist pricing and social proof.
00:02:52.394 - 00:03:40.248, Speaker A: Now, social proof, if you're not familiar, probably most of you are, is a very important concept in marketing. It's basically the testimony. The testimony on Amazon, for example, when you, or the review, when you are you know, looking at a product, has this ever happened to you where you're looking at a product, you're not sure and then you read like ten amazing five star reviews and then you want to get it. Well, this takes place also with art pricing, I would argue, and I think that's obvious, that once you start seeing other people buy, oh, well, that person must like it, so it must be good. That's what's called social proof. Very powerful. It probably plugs into our herd instincts.
00:03:40.248 - 00:04:15.034, Speaker A: So this is instinctual, incredibly powerful. So that is all preamble to what I wanted to say here. Let's just look at the latest sales. So he's still making good sales and then we will return to Sumi. But this is what I wanted to point out. So he bought these two, I think it was a guy, I'm pretty sure he put a message out on Twitter for 135 and 145, the same guy. So he blows 280 tezos, which is like 400 and 5450 us dollars.
00:04:15.034 - 00:04:56.824, Speaker A: But then shortly after this, moving cities goes for 80 tezos. And you wonder if the person who bought this was looking at these two and going, oh, you know what, this is a steal at 80. Meanwhile this guy, the other guy's doing rampant speculation and maybe this guy's just going, I better get it while I can. So now the price is 200 though, and this is again, part of the fun of object is you buy something and all of a sudden it's like the price triples. Or here it's two and a half times very powerful again. And final little comment here is like this is like the new Facebook as far as I'm concerned. Like if I was Facebook or Mark Zuckerberg, this is what I would be worried about because I'm hooked on this, obviously.
00:04:56.824 - 00:05:34.646, Speaker A: Like it's probably like an ailment at this point. Probably buy art till I have no money left at this rate. So I need to stop basically right away. But all to say, yeah, this is, you get your little notifications in the morning, which just brings joy to my heart. So the world is coming and it's a very small community if you ask me still. I mean, you look at the collectors and a lot, you still recognize a lot of familiar names out there, which again was great to meet some of these people on a Twitter spaces the other day. I'm sure only more of that's going to happen, which is super exciting.
00:05:34.646 - 00:06:15.204, Speaker A: So let's take a look just very quickly at Sumire UC. I'll have to find out how to pronounce her name. But look at these great works I picked up for $23.40, and you can get one for 23.50, edition of 20. And what's cool about her work is, I believe we'll have to confirm this, but I'm pretty sure she uses AI in these images that are in the work. Like, if you can see the framed images on the side of the wall, those, I believe, are AI paintings.
00:06:15.204 - 00:06:52.364, Speaker A: So a very creative use of AI and getting that kind of contrast between, it's all about contrast. A lot of design and art. At the end of the day, the beauty in art is often about contrast. And here you get a wonderful contrast between her work, which is, you know, done by hand and done by a person who's thinking semi rationally. Not too rationally, hopefully, but you know what I'm saying? Like, someone who is organizing stuff. And then that contrasts with this artwork, which is created by AI. So you're getting a contrast between human and machine is, I guess, where I'm going with this.
00:06:52.364 - 00:07:24.642, Speaker A: So a beautiful work. And again, you get. It's actually hard to tell if the carpet is like a photoshop, like of a real photo of a carpet, or if it's kind of traced. I think it's a real carpet, which kind of just adds another contrast. It's all about contrast. If you take a design class, even if it's web design, kind of contrast is front and center, you know, have really big letters and really small letters don't do, you know, just slightly different, strong contrast. Look at Van Gogh.
00:07:24.642 - 00:07:53.206, Speaker A: You see a ton of strong contrast in the color. Often the complementary color will be used. That's why they're so beautiful. So some great contrasts here. And I just want to show her work as just another example of, you know, these are the kind of artists that I think will be all bought up like that. The institutions are sleeping on. And I would say Sumeri is definitely one of them.
00:07:53.206 - 00:08:28.090, Speaker A: And again, a very modern sort of setting, like, you know, the hoodie. This could be someone's living room today. And kind of hilarious. I actually really like this Rubik's cube iconography. You find it all over the NFT space. And, you know, when I was a kid, you know, the Rubik's cube was, like, not ironic, but now you get the sense, like, I think she's only 26, this artist, if I remember right now, you get the sense the Rubik's cube is like this thing that the next generation looks at and just finds kind of hilarious. And so we're going to put Rubik's cubes in our.
00:08:28.090 - 00:08:42.164, Speaker A: In our paintings. It's like. It's like putting an old monitor or, you know, a 1.44 megabyte, 3.5 inch diskette, which I also remember. I was very young, but I do. That was my first computer had that.
00:08:42.164 - 00:09:02.864, Speaker A: I kind of grew up in the eighties. I was born in 79, hopefully not TMI. And let's just look at this other one. Actually, we'll look at a couple, and then we're going to wrap it up here because I have a ton to do today. It's my girlfriend's birthday. And let me tell you, Bolivians take their birthdays very seriously. So I have a lot to do, a lot of running around to do today.
00:09:02.864 - 00:09:28.944, Speaker A: And I was up late because I ran into a friend after leaving the Lululemon store buying presents, and I ran into a friend in Berlin. And that's a great feeling, too. You know, when you've been here for six years and you just start running into people on the street, that is a wonderful feeling. And. Okay, so let's just take a very quick look. All to say it was a late night. Let's just take a very quick look at room 123456.
00:09:28.944 - 00:09:56.300, Speaker A: Room six. Again, you see what I probably think is removing layers. You know, you're starting to see how layering affects the making of artwork. And I use this a ton. I've been using this for years. And that's not necessarily what's going on here, by the way, but that's what I imagine is going on. See this outline of the chair? I imagine at one point that was filled in, maybe, and that that layer was removed.
00:09:56.300 - 00:10:31.004, Speaker A: Like, you start removing layers and testing out stuff. I could be totally wrong on that, though, so who knows? But anyways, just another really interesting, beautiful work. You have the gun on the chalkboard that kind of has this weird, twirly red thing. You just see someone who's really enjoying making art. The strange faces, which are super beautiful. The chalk, again, looking at other textures and just kind of playing around with the different mediums, which is also one of my. My themes.
00:10:31.004 - 00:10:47.080, Speaker A: And so really cool. You see it was made in 2022. Sorry, 2020 as well. And so here. And she minted this on 2022. So she's not just, like, showing up and saying, okay, I'm going to start making art. And there's nothing wrong with that, by the way.
00:10:47.080 - 00:11:19.974, Speaker A: I actually applaud that we saw with Kappa the development that's happened in the last, like, three months. Amazing. And you see these guys buying new equipment. It's really exciting, you know, like this is. I almost want to call it like a middle class art revolution that's going on here, which makes it way more exciting. And so. Yeah, and then I pay, you know, what was it I paid 1950 for this, okay? And then someone relisted higher, unfortunately, like, again, like, keep these prices low.
00:11:19.974 - 00:11:41.948, Speaker A: So you guys. But I paid $30 for this, maybe $32, $33 for this beautiful work of art. An edition of 17. Again, I just see more opportunities. So check her work out. I mean, and quick tip for those who just don't know, go to her work. And a nice way to do it is just go price low to high and you can see what you can afford.
00:11:41.948 - 00:12:10.836, Speaker A: This new one she put out, it's only three tazos. It's a beautiful work. Actually, I picked it up right away. You can get some other works. I mean, this stuff is cheap, okay, for less than $10. So moral of the story, it's actually coming back to a previous theme, which is the middle class is not supposed to collect art. As far as the elites and everything in history is concerned, we're not supposed to collect art.
00:12:10.836 - 00:13:00.704, Speaker A: And here is your basically once in a lifetime opportunity to collect awesome art. Do not sleep on this because you can have you put in 1000 or $2,000 here. That'll give you like 1300 tazos. And as you can see here, you can start having a pretty significant art collection for next to nothing. And I may be wrong on my conviction that this is temporary, but I would say this is very unusual, historically speaking, to have access to this kind of art. And I mean, think of how many. If the world knew what was going on here, do you think you'd be able, like, there's only 25? There's how many billion people now? Seven and a half billion? Is there 8 billion now? I don't know what the number is, but it's over seven.
00:13:00.704 - 00:13:35.748, Speaker A: And I'm just saying, you start doing the math, you look at how many art institutions are there and frankly, I think they would be delighted to pick up, you know, these works. I mean, these are sensational works. Just bring up the other one. These are sensational works. So anyways, I'm going long here, but that is, again, the moral of the story here. So I thought I'd bring a new artist to your attention here. Not a ton of news here over here.
00:13:35.748 - 00:14:09.448, Speaker A: I've been running around the last couple of days, and just a quick note like this may not come out every day, but the reaction I've gotten so far. Let me tell you, folks, I am committed to this. And again, like, I, you know, was drinking last night and everything. So I may not do this every single day. Maybe even sometimes I take two or three days off. But I am here, okay, because I am loving doing this and I get, I got some beautiful comments. I'll actually very quickly read the comments.
00:14:09.448 - 00:14:27.524, Speaker A: Thank you for the great insight on the Tezos art spec art space. I'm getting FOMo watching how fast this space is growing. Thank you, Ethan. Hurley. Hurley and Tjadupin love these videos. Exclamation mark. Let me tell you, like, this is incredibly encouraging.
00:14:27.524 - 00:14:38.734, Speaker A: So leave those likes. Leave those comments. Six likes, guys. Because, I mean, and it's hilarious. Like, enjoy. And this is another thing, final thing. And actually a couple things.
00:14:38.734 - 00:15:08.964, Speaker A: Enjoy the journey. So if you're an artist that's not selling much and that's actually where we're going to go next, do not worry, because you'll look at those days as like the, oh, remember when? And, you know, if you stick with it and you keep training yourself, you will go somewhere. Okay. And so enjoy. Like, I love, it's like I got 33 views. That's like, I mean, let's look at the visits really quickly. Sorry, I'm all over the place today.
00:15:08.964 - 00:15:24.644, Speaker A: Bear with me. I am. We've got six new subscribers. We're at 46 or 47 now. We're at 53. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your support. But you see 33 views yesterday, 19 the day before, 16 and 37.
00:15:24.644 - 00:15:44.364, Speaker A: These are not bad numbers for some guy just like, you know, putting it out on his quiet Twitter account that doesn't seem to get any traction. Feel free to like and retweet. Actually, I have gotten some. So many thanks. I have noticed that. And very quickly, just wrapping up. Not going to get a ton done today, but I would like to thank.
00:15:44.364 - 00:16:06.702, Speaker A: We sold out a bez, kind of a nineties raver. Happy Mondays. Let me stop this because maybe there's people out there, but very quickly, Mikey Wilson, actually, he has been very supportive on Twitter. Thank you, Mikey Wilson. Much appreciated. I hope you enjoy your one of three. So we sold that and we sold something else.
00:16:06.702 - 00:16:33.428, Speaker A: I think we sold two things or I sold. I will get to it the next episode. But all to say, it really helps to get your name up there, too. And just to show up, you know, you can't be out there and you can't be bitter about the world not knowing about you if you're not showing up and putting yourself out there. And. Yeah, so there's that. And finally, I think I have this.
00:16:33.428 - 00:16:59.372, Speaker A: Yeah. And I'm just working on this. And I have different versions of these. So this is very new. So you see how I kind of work my process, and maybe I'll be like, oh, maybe I want that blue dot that's kind of at the bottom here, but I want to keep the rest how it is. So maybe I'll put on a mask and I'll start experimenting and be like, okay, maybe that. And, okay, maybe kill that, you know? So that's just part of what I'm working on.
00:16:59.372 - 00:17:21.202, Speaker A: So I'm working on this screen memory here. I really like how it's coming, actually. And I added the iPad to the mix just to add. I used to go phone to laptop to make this series, but I've added the iPad as in between. And it's actually. Yeah, it adds another fun element. And here, back to contrast.
00:17:21.202 - 00:17:59.174, Speaker A: Finally here you get a nice contrast. You have extremely flat color shapes here, almost digital hard, you know, curved shapes. And that contrasts with, say, this italian painting that is kind of graded, you know, chiaroscuro or, you know, the light and dark. I mean, I wouldn't necessarily consider this necessarily. It's probably a little bright for a traditional chiaroscuro, if I'm pronouncing that right. But you see contrast, strong blocks of color with, like, this kind of brownish gradient. So that's a strong contrast.
00:17:59.174 - 00:18:16.874, Speaker A: So just a practical example of what I'm talking about. Thank you for joining this episode, and we will have many more. Again, don't worry if I miss a day here and there. I'm completely committed to this. Okay, so that's all for now. Enjoy your day. And until next time, take care.
