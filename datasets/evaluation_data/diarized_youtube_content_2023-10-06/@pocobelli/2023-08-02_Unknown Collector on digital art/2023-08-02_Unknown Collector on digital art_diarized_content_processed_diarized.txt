00:00:30.840 - 00:01:03.196, Speaker A: We had to start a new space. There was, for the first time, a Twitter glitch, and I'm pretty sure it was Twitter. Welcome back, everybody. If you. If you follow art on the blockchain, you've probably read his tweets giving insight to both artists and collectors on how to navigate this young, inspired and tricky space. Today we're welcoming unknown collector to the show to discuss all things digital art from AI to experimental pixel art. Artist Journal, July 19, 2023.
00:01:03.196 - 00:01:18.904, Speaker A: Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelly and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show, Rune tune. How is your week going?
00:01:19.244 - 00:01:24.676, Speaker B: I've been good. Twitter has been mighty glitchy these days, hasn't it?
00:01:24.860 - 00:01:53.320, Speaker A: It sure has. I started the space and what happened? And then nobody joined in. And then even unknown collector couldn't join in, so I had to start a new one. So unfortunately that 86 people who had, you know, got the reminder, well, hopefully they'll find us now. And we do have people coming in here and unknown collector is connected and we already have wonderful crowd here. Santiago, Ed Morolla, ah heck. Doctor Virgin, Emily Libro, and many more here.
00:01:53.320 - 00:01:59.390, Speaker A: So thank you, everybody, for showing up here and checking out this awesome conversation. Rune tune, how was your week going.
00:01:59.422 - 00:02:09.686, Speaker B: There in New York City? Nothing terribly exciting to report here, I suppose. Just kind of plugging away. I saw that you were in quite.
00:02:09.710 - 00:02:11.494, Speaker A: A few spaces this week talking about.
00:02:11.534 - 00:02:22.854, Speaker B: Yourself and your art, poke. That was pretty cool. I missed the one on, the one that Kant hosted. I'll have to check and see if he has a recording later. But yeah, that was fun.
00:02:23.474 - 00:02:56.644, Speaker A: It's kind of interesting and fun to actually talk about your own art for a while. I was almost rusty, you know, like, it's kind of funny. Before the show, you know, a year ago, I, you know, I kind of had my, you know, my thoughts pretty clear in my head, but I guess I've said so many things on this show that people then ask me about it, like, what do you mean by, you know, digital folk art and all this sort of thing? And I'm like, I don't. I have to go back. You know, that was. That was about 50 shows ago, so it was really great. And it was really great to just have the practice.
00:02:56.644 - 00:03:25.524, Speaker A: And the one with Kant was awesome. It was 90 minutes and you really never know where that's going to go. So, yeah, otherwise over here, it's been super busy with moving. I actually have a mover coming. My friend Bob is coming in about 90 minutes here to help me move. It's kind of like the big moving day where we move everything, you know, from one place to another, and then I give over the keys on Sundays. So it's just a lot of work, a lot of cleaning, a lot of packing up boxes.
00:03:28.824 - 00:03:41.204, Speaker B: Yes. That's, you know, I've. I haven't moved in, I think, eight years. So the memory of what it takes to move, especially in a huge metropolitan city.
00:03:41.884 - 00:04:02.524, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, I feel for that. I am very grateful to my friend Bob, who is renting one of those huge vans, one of those share. Share vans. But anyway, let me get to our esteemed guest here, unknown collector. Thank you so much for joining us on our weekly spaces here. We've seen your tweets, you know, for a long time. They're always thoughtful.
00:04:02.524 - 00:04:11.984, Speaker A: You have this great, you know, interesting, you know, taste and art. I really, really love it. And so I just want to say hello. Welcome to the show.
00:04:12.924 - 00:04:17.036, Speaker C: Hello, thanks for having me. Nice to be here. Welcome, welcome.
00:04:17.100 - 00:04:18.332, Speaker A: It's great to hear your voice.
00:04:18.428 - 00:04:19.524, Speaker B: Nice to hear you.
00:04:19.644 - 00:04:21.344, Speaker C: Yeah, nice to hear your voices, too.
00:04:22.604 - 00:04:27.544, Speaker A: So I assume you're in an anonymous location. Can you tell us what continent you're in?
00:04:28.124 - 00:04:29.796, Speaker C: Europe. I'm in Europe.
00:04:29.940 - 00:04:37.226, Speaker A: Okay. Very good. So again, welcome to the show. So how is your week going? How are things going with you?
00:04:37.410 - 00:04:48.514, Speaker C: Pretty good, actually. I'm also moving, but not today. It's a pretty. You're smooth about it, like a show in between, and then the move and. Yeah, let's go.
00:04:48.634 - 00:05:11.060, Speaker A: It's pretty crazy, actually, everything I'm trying to do. And I've had these, you know, all that heat out here in Europe. I mean, all around the world, really. I'm not really an allergy guy, but these days, I sure am. And so that's just adding more. More chemicals to the stew here, more challenges. But again, with the help of friends, it actually becomes more manageable.
00:05:11.060 - 00:05:16.144, Speaker A: So I'm happy about that. So you're moving, too, and did you find a place?
00:05:16.724 - 00:05:33.324, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, no, we are. We will move, like. Like in August, 1 week of August or something like that, I think. But, yeah, we will move cities. So also, it's a little bit challenging, but not the same. Like. Like in Berlin, I imagine that it's a little bit more.
00:05:33.324 - 00:05:36.424, Speaker C: The traffic and the people and. I don't know.
00:05:36.764 - 00:05:47.252, Speaker A: Yeah. Can happen just to find an apartment. I mean, there are people that I've heard of who are going back to the US because they can't find an apartment. Like, it's, it's that bad.
00:05:47.348 - 00:05:48.292, Speaker C: That's crazy.
00:05:48.428 - 00:06:12.708, Speaker A: It is. Like, it's all about just like your who, you know, like, those are. The only opportunities I had is my girlfriend's sister's ex husband was moving to Barcelona and he wanted to hold onto the apartment. So he was like, oh, you can rent out the apartment. It was like that. So without that, I mean, I had a couple of other maybes that I didn't really love. And so we're going with it and.
00:06:12.708 - 00:06:28.774, Speaker A: Yeah, so let's talk about art here. Unknown collector. So maybe just start us off here. Tell us a little bit about your journey. Like, you know, even going back. Like, did you go to art school? When did you first start getting into art? And what brought you to the blockchain?
00:06:29.714 - 00:06:40.454, Speaker C: I got into art. When did I start my twitter account? Let's see, October 2021. That's when I got into art the first time.
00:06:41.154 - 00:06:43.934, Speaker A: Amazing. Very recently.
00:06:44.434 - 00:07:10.694, Speaker C: Yeah. It was like a coincidence, I have to say. My family is pretty, like, they, they, they are, they make art, like, as a hobby. And my mom is painting and all my coffee machine is going off and my mom is painting and my sister too, so. But we were never like the family that goes to a gallery or museum together. I don't know. I never really was interested in these kind of things.
00:07:10.694 - 00:07:41.100, Speaker C: But then I wanted actually to buy an NFT for a good friend of mine that is, like, very tech interested. And I was looking into it, like, as a birthday present to, yeah, give him like, a picture, JPeg. And then I was like, but the gas fee is $80. The picture is $80. I don't know. This makes no sense. But it got me interested because I was like, there needs to be a reason that people are, like, interested in this and what is behind all of this.
00:07:41.100 - 00:08:22.104, Speaker C: And so I got into the NFT, like, the technical side of it all. And after some months, thanks God, I left the PFP, losing money without even having something nice to find art. And then I got, like, hooked. And since then, I think since I started here, there wasn't a single day that I saw art like it. Even if I have nothing like a free day or something like that with the family, at least in the night or on the toilet. I don't know. I look at art, so I'm passionate about it.
00:08:22.444 - 00:08:31.424, Speaker B: So would you say that it was the craziness of the 2021 market that got you looking at NFTs in the first place?
00:08:32.084 - 00:09:19.996, Speaker C: Yeah. Yeah. It was like the punks that I saw the day I saw them, like, I don't know, 2019 or 2020, but I was always like, what is this? I never, you know, it always takes me some time, even with crypto, to start thinking about, but why are people so interested in it? What is, what is, what is the revolutionary thing about it? Or is there any. And this is just bullshit. So I started to, to read about provenance and digital ownership and all these kind of things. And since then, I found it very interesting in combination with art, that now digital art can be sold, that you can prove that you're the, this is like the provenance, you're the owner and all these kind of things. That was not really possible before.
00:09:19.996 - 00:09:25.304, Speaker C: So I found really interesting opportunity for art and artists.
00:09:26.154 - 00:10:25.244, Speaker A: Well, the quantity of the art that we all consume is something I really think about a lot, actually, is like, I think just by virtue of it being on Twitter and a lot of us being on Twitter for maybe, I don't know, an hour or two a day, probably in a lot of cases, means you're consuming a lot of art. And in a weird way, like crypto, it seems like the main use case in a lot of ways. I mean, one of the main use cases is digital art. As you're just saying, being able to buy and sell jpegs in a credible way. And so it does, it does make me wonder what that's doing to us. Like, put it this way, I think it's forming tastes and it's forming judgments, like, it's forming analytical skills, shall we say, that are developing. And I think maybe that's why what's so interesting about you already is.
00:10:25.244 - 00:10:47.224, Speaker A: I mean, you started collecting and getting into art in 2021. I mean, this is like, perhaps less than two years ago, let's call it two years ago. And already, I mean, there you are, practically one of the thought leaders in the space, putting out interesting commentary for artists and collectors. Do you have anything more to say about just all the art we're consuming?
00:10:47.604 - 00:11:46.212, Speaker C: Yeah, I find it interesting. Like, you have the chance, I feel, you know, I don't say that I have the best taste or something, but I definitely see the development of the taste and the judgment of the quality of art is getting better just because I pressure myself to see a lot of arts a little different art, like, not just relying on the timeline, that's like the bubble that you have, but trying to reach out in different, yeah, I don't know, object and see everywhere art, and, like, trying to put myself out there and learn something every day. And I feel that it's very, like the biggest part of this is subconscious. You know, it's like you see a piece of art and you have this kind of feeling that this is something special. And this happens because you are, you saw so many thousand pieces of art and you can, like, subconsciously say this is something different. You know, it's not like the super. Yeah, that's not the best definition of it, but it's like the learning process is more subconscious.
00:11:46.212 - 00:11:56.304, Speaker C: And the rest you have to do, clearly, you have to read about it and these kind of things to. Yeah, to can, to, can judge it consciously.
00:11:57.284 - 00:12:38.832, Speaker A: It's quite interesting, that whole process. I mean, I find it's quite fast. Generally, if an artist isn't too tricky, like, you know, has druba waffle took me actually quite a bit of time to appreciate. Some artists are challenging, and then once you appreciate them, sometimes they become your favorites. But generally speaking, when I see an image, I feel like I can, you know, it's like less than a second, and I feel like I can just kind of, it's just got that feeling, that thing that, you know, maybe as you're sort of saying that subconscious thing that, you know, the things that I'm looking for in an image, do you find the same thing or is it something that you kind of think about for longer?
00:12:38.968 - 00:12:39.288, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:39.336 - 00:12:40.520, Speaker A: How does that work for you?
00:12:40.632 - 00:13:05.934, Speaker C: Yeah, I think it's the same, but it, like, because I'm so early in the early, not like short time into art, it definitely is a process that is always changing. You know, that it could be. I had it so much times that I thought about an artist. What is this? You know? I don't. Yeah. And then I look at it back, six months later, I was like, wow, it's like the most genius artist that we have here. Like, it's never.
00:13:05.934 - 00:13:39.182, Speaker C: I can never. I'm trying to never. Now that I had this enlightenment that these things happen with me and art piece, I always try when I see a piece of art and think, like, what is this? It's like more of a sign to dig deeper into it, to leave it, like, to save it and to look at it again and to try to understand what's behind it and learn more about it because, yeah, most of the time, it's not. It's not the piece of art. It's me. So which.
00:13:39.358 - 00:13:45.954, Speaker B: Can you recall which artists first got you very excited about what you were seeing with nfts?
00:13:47.774 - 00:14:10.732, Speaker C: My first. Kelvin. Kelvin. I will. Can I. How was the last name of Calvin? Something like a brazilian artist I never can say the names because I'm always just writing and never, never actually speaking. So, Calvin Estefau, is this the name? Something like that.
00:14:10.732 - 00:14:33.064, Speaker C: I hope I say it right. And I bought pieces from him very early on in my journey and I still buy pieces of him. And now, and I see like the development and how, how his vision stays the same. But like now he made still images, now he makes like moving pieces that are something else. And so he was the first one. I will try to find the name.
00:14:36.164 - 00:15:14.204, Speaker A: And also while you're doing that, unknown collector, what was it like to buy your first NFT? Like, what was the experience for you? And you're saying maybe you started with the pfps. Was it a big leap for you to go to art from there? Because it was, for me, pfps still felt like an investment case. And I feel like your journey was similar to a lot of our journeys where a lot of us started basically as speculators and profile picture projects and ended up with a little bit of extra cash and then started buying art with it. When was your aha moment? Buying nfts?
00:15:14.984 - 00:15:43.688, Speaker C: Yeah, so I found artists, but I don't know how to link him here. But it's the name Kelvin Estefau in the way you say it. In Brazilian. In Brazil? In Portuguese. So. And for the question, yeah, like, it's, the thing is, with pfps, I just like you, I started and it was like more this kind of FOMO thing. I didn't have an idea why should be which PFP should be like valuable and I just bought some and I burned a lot of money.
00:15:43.688 - 00:16:13.544, Speaker C: But it's a lot about who's hyping this. If it doesn't have like cultural relevance, like punks, maybe that is like the start of it all. But for other things, it's like more who's behind it and other things that you can find out with some data. And it's like very mechanical to trade pfps or to. Yeah, I don't know. To can know which ones will gain in value. And I really don't enjoy this process.
00:16:13.544 - 00:16:49.148, Speaker C: And maybe it would be better, maybe I could make some money with it besides just buying art and don't earning nothing. But no, it's not my interest in art. You have like this. It's more about the art than the NFT. You know, for me it's just like that now with nfTs, you can actually give it some relevance for the people that before didn't get it. And a lot of still don't get it like that. Nft give them the relevance, these pieces with the provenance, but at least more and more our understanding.
00:16:49.236 - 00:17:02.224, Speaker A: So, and you started with AI art, is that correct? And, and what was it about AI art that kind of drew you to it? Is that the first art you collected?
00:17:02.604 - 00:17:28.490, Speaker C: No, no, no. When I started collecting their, I didn't even know AI existed. I think I was not, I'm always a little bit, like, I'm early, but a little bit late. So I started with normal illustrations and all this kind of different art. Yeah, I tried. You know, it was like a, it's kind of an addiction. Also, you not just, I cannot just look at it.
00:17:28.490 - 00:17:54.144, Speaker C: I need to own it. It's like, this is the, this also makes me so hopeful for the future because it awakes this feeling in me that I need to own it instead. Just looking at it, it's a different kind of feeling. I don't know. But I collected a lot of pieces. Then I had, like, I always search for new visual conceptual stimulation. Then I started to collect photography for someone's only photography.
00:17:54.144 - 00:18:25.814, Speaker C: And then I got into AI art, and then this was the longest period, I think, that I, that I was very focused in it. And after that, now I have my favorites and I always start to look what's coming new, which artist I didn't see because there's so many thousand artists, and you always think, yeah, I should know them all by now, but they are always coming up. A lot of artists that are here for some years and I never saw before, and I was like, wow, how is this possible?
00:18:26.484 - 00:18:43.424, Speaker B: You know, that's funny. That's a, that's a problem I have as well. And actually, it takes me so many times in a row to see an artist's name, to have it kind of like, stick with me and like, you know, associate a name with the type of art making.
00:18:45.684 - 00:18:49.420, Speaker C: Yeah, I just, I started with the list.
00:18:49.452 - 00:18:50.384, Speaker B: Helps with that.
00:18:52.384 - 00:18:54.776, Speaker C: Sorry, I didn't want to interrupt.
00:18:54.840 - 00:19:07.924, Speaker B: I was just saying, I know that for me, Poco belly show has kind of helped me, you know, better memorize these artists names because you're right. There's thousands of artists that I see every day.
00:19:10.064 - 00:19:37.804, Speaker C: Yeah, definitely. I started to watch, finally, after I always saw it on my timeline, I started to watch the artist journals, and now I'm a little bit addicted because it's always very entertaining and you always see a lot of great teasers. Art mostly, that is always something very different and fun to dive into afterwards. So it's a very fun show. I really love it.
00:19:37.964 - 00:19:59.400, Speaker A: Well, I appreciate that. And you and my mom are addicted, so big shout out to mom if she's out there. And so. Okay, yes. So an ethereum, I assume, is where you started. Now, how long did it take you to discover what was going on on Tazos? I also started on ethereum. It took me at least a year of kind of following.
00:19:59.400 - 00:20:31.134, Speaker A: I thought I was following what was going on in the art scene on the blockchain, but then it was quite a revelation to me after maybe three months. Being on object is when I first started to realize that there was stuff that just kind of really appealed to me. You know, I think it was Haiti, Rockette, you know, Jnk, who's now Kurt Hussle collective. And then I started looking at what they were collecting. How was that journey for you? Because now you've even released art on tezos, if I'm not mistaken.
00:20:31.474 - 00:21:03.792, Speaker C: Yeah, that was also a long process, I always thought. But I'm always like, I need some time to. To really dive into it, because I'm always thinking, yeah, I have a lot. Always so much to find out and see on Ethereum. But one day, I was like, okay, now I will finally try to find good art on the. It was incredible for me. It was like a different world because it's so small in comparison, and the quality is, I would say, much higher.
00:21:03.792 - 00:21:54.014, Speaker C: Like, for, like, on Ethereum, like, on foundation, you have, I don't know, 200,000 pieces available, and a lot is just, like, crap. Crap. No, I don't want to say that, because it's not that there are some things I just want to sell with cheap AI art or something, but there's, like, very generic art, a lot of that. And on tazos, it's much smaller. There are still a lot of artists, but I feel like there's much more quality experimental art, something that really makes you think that you didn't see before. And this was very interesting, and I really got into, like, a streak of collecting on tasers until the money stopped flowing in, so. But on tasers, I could collect every day.
00:21:54.014 - 00:22:00.704, Speaker C: There's, like, always so much good additions or one on ones for. For good prices, so.
00:22:00.824 - 00:22:23.496, Speaker A: Yeah, well, that is the strange thing about it. I mean, I don't know. I didn't blow all my cash, but I made a nice amount of money in that bull market, as many of us did, especially if you're in the PFPs. And I had the MFers, and I had, like, nine of those things. I wish I'd sold them at six east, let me tell you that. I did not. But I still sold, you know, still did all right on those.
00:22:23.496 - 00:23:09.572, Speaker A: And I. Yeah, like, to your point, I mean, it's very addicting once you start collecting. And I think part of the, you know, part of the reason is exactly what you're saying. It's so cheap and it's like, so the value, like, I mean, we haven't really seen, I mean, except for, like, a handful of artists who have taken off, like maybe Louis Osborne, Oxine, maybe. Strange thing, we haven't really seen a huge payoff from buying this art, in a sense, interestingly, but I still think that could happen in the long term. What do you think about the investment case? It sounds like that was part of the reason that you were so excited to buy.
00:23:09.708 - 00:23:28.934, Speaker C: No, it's not the reason. The investment, it's just I could still afford it. I was doing the exact same thing for ten x the price on Ethereum that I was just collecting, collecting without any strategy, and I. I blew all my profits from the bull market. You know, I don't need much. I need. I have a comfortable life, but I don't need much things.
00:23:28.934 - 00:24:11.382, Speaker C: I don't need a fancy car or things like that. So I was very addicted also from the idea to help artists, like, following their dream to live from their art. It was like a very comforting thought that you buy a piece of art, you own it, and you help someone with it. It's like a very. Yeah, this is like, the most beautiful thing about collecting art. And so I spent, like, I don't know, 300 etherium, all my money on Ethereum, on art pieces, just because I was so addicted to this feeling, and not just because of that, because I was like, at some point, I was deciding I don't want to do something else. I want to somehow, like, fill my life with art and help artists or.
00:24:11.382 - 00:24:32.198, Speaker C: Yeah, curate art. I don't know, with everything, everything that is surrounded with art. I want to fill my life with this, and I need to find a way to keep doing it. I'm still not there. I'm not earning with anything, but I'm. I want to stay inside the world of art. And so I was like, okay, I would just spend my money that I luckily made in a bull market with crypto.
00:24:32.198 - 00:25:03.964, Speaker C: I was just spending on art, and I will live the decentralized ideal. Thought of, like, how you say that, sharing. No, but like, that, you spare the money on all kinds of directions and just have art and help people and I think investment wise, it's the same like on teases. It's the same like on ethereum with most art that you buy, you don't make any money. I didn't make any money with art. It's not like the thought behind it. Maybe in.
00:25:03.964 - 00:25:50.644, Speaker C: In ten years, there will be some. Hopefully some pieces that I have that will be worth something and I can keep collecting art. My goal is to keep collecting art and live my comfortable life that I have now that is not full of luxury. That's the only thing that I need. Because I don't think that it's necessary to drive a Lamborghini and all these kind of things when so many people are struggling, so many beautiful souls, like all the artists that I met on my journey, that are struggling to create, that this is in the society is not even valued or supported. So I feel that we have a big chance with this space. This is my big dream.
00:25:50.644 - 00:26:12.158, Speaker C: I'm an idealist, but I feel you need to act like you want to see the world or the space changing. So that's what I'm always trying to do, even though it's not for my personal, personal benefit, economic growth. But, yeah, here we are.
00:26:12.286 - 00:26:13.078, Speaker A: I hear you.
00:26:13.126 - 00:26:13.758, Speaker C: Exactly.
00:26:13.846 - 00:26:15.886, Speaker A: Here we are. Sorry, Rinton. Go ahead.
00:26:16.030 - 00:26:36.690, Speaker B: Are you trying to just continue, you know, growing your trading and collecting, or are you trying to, like. I mean, I see that you've curated a lot of, like, what is it on cyberspaces. And you're doing this object one curation. Can you talk a little bit about curation?
00:26:36.842 - 00:26:58.938, Speaker C: Yeah. So I'm not sure how I will, like, I don't think I will. Yeah. I'm not sure how I will make money from it all. It's not like I don't want to make just money for the sake of money. I wouldn't buy so much art if it would be like that. But there will be some ways in the future when this space grows, I think I will be fine.
00:26:58.938 - 00:27:14.650, Speaker C: Like, at least in my. In my little expectations that I have monetarily, how to. How to spend the money in real life. So it will be fine somehow. But it's on cyber galleries that I made. This was, like, fun thing in the beginning. It was not very.
00:27:14.650 - 00:27:43.084, Speaker C: I don't. I probably should take off the links because I am not very convinced anymore of how it's done. But this was all part of the learning process because, like, collecting, like judging, like curating art, it's all a big learning process that never stops. I'm very beginning still of my journey, but I'm, like, curious to learn every day about it. And now tonight I have the space with object one. Tomorrow is the drop. So they.
00:27:43.084 - 00:28:05.568, Speaker C: I like normal, like everyone, I was applicating with the idea for curation about naive art in the digital space and in connection with web3 and shared value. Shared values. And they like how I say that. Agreed. No, they accepted.
00:28:05.616 - 00:28:05.920, Speaker A: Agreed.
00:28:05.952 - 00:28:34.906, Speaker C: They accepted. They sometimes missing the words. They accepted this curation. So I was, like, a little bit strengthened in my ideas that this is a good way for me and that I have some kind of eye talent for this all. And that is like, a good space to start off to grow and to keep growing and to use that. This space is still very immature and I have time to grow myself also. And there are not a lot of.
00:28:34.906 - 00:29:12.332, Speaker C: Not a lot of professionals, I would say, collecting or curating. I see there a lot more very good curators coming to the space, which I find great. But yeah, I feel we are very not super professionals, but I also feel that I have time to grow, but I also have the feeling that this happens very fast. Like you said, I started two years ago to sea art, and now I have tomorrow my first curated drop accepted from very great curators from object one. So I'm very proud for the development that I. That I took. And it has nothing to do with money.
00:29:12.332 - 00:29:33.024, Speaker C: And money spent. Like, sometimes it's all about, like, the biggest collection, the most expensive is the best one, sometimes seen like this in social media. But these things you can buy, you know, and this, like, something like that I'm very proud of because it's not something that you can buy, something that you have to earn for yourself. So, yeah, yeah.
00:29:33.104 - 00:30:14.480, Speaker A: Big congratulations on that, too. And as I like to say, it's a testament to this space that, you know, you can go from buying your first art piece, let's say, a little over two years ago, let's say, to curating a pretty, you know, one of the more serious platforms, we could say a level platform in that short amount of time. And, I mean, imagine trying to do that in the contemporary art world, right? You're just. You'll be lucky just to get a curation anywhere within that timeframe. So that's, again, the beauty of this space is how really, how fast things can go. And we have a ton of the artists that you're mentioning here. There's a ton of people in here.
00:30:14.480 - 00:31:04.664, Speaker A: So if anybody wants to join and join us on stage and talk and ask unknown collector a question, leave a comment, feel free to put in a request and I will bring you on stage happily to join us here. So you're doing the curation and tell us a little bit. I'm kind of back to this thing you were mentioning, or I was mentioning that you were into AI art. It seemed like you kind of had a bit of a phase there. Are you still excited about AI art? What is next? What are you excited about right now with, I mean, you've been consuming this stuff like I have, and like, many people here, almost, probably everybody in this room, practically. What are you excited about right now? Where's this going? And start with AI. And if you can move over to what's next.
00:31:05.764 - 00:31:33.444, Speaker C: Yeah. So I definitely was, like, more excited about it six months ago because it was also new. Like, all the visuality, like, the visuals and all the pieces seemed so, so new, so never seen before. Like the glitches and all this kind of stuff. It was very fascinating for me. And it, it went on for a lot of time, long time like that. I kept exploring and I always found new.
00:31:33.444 - 00:32:00.504, Speaker C: Yeah. New works that are, that were, like, dragging me inside and that, it was like, I never saw that before. So interesting. I will. I will research how it's done or what is. Yeah. What's the idea of the artist? And I don't know, but now with mid journey version five and this kind of things, and it's so easy to reproduce, like, photographs and all this kind of thing, it gets a little bit boring.
00:32:00.504 - 00:33:08.034, Speaker C: I'm still finding the same AI artist. Like, my favorites are the same for the last month, I would say, and I don't know if it will change because it's just so easy to don't invest time to create art with it. But in the end, it's about using the glitches, using the language of the AI to use the weird things that it produces, to make something unique, to make something special. And I feel that is, like a lot of really good artists, like, got into it and they're still using it and they're still doing it. But, like, new people that start to use AI now with the new versions, they get pushed into these visuals, this perfect 3d, like this perfect photo realistic image. And this is a little bit boring for me. So I was, I was surprised from the fellowship drop a post photographic perspective.
00:33:08.034 - 00:33:42.596, Speaker C: The last one I found, it was really interesting, and they pushed themselves to go outside the typical post photographic visual. So that was pretty interesting. I loved that. And I knew most of the artists, but some were new to me and was very fun to to see the collections and to see the pieces and. Yeah. So what's new? I would say, like, now it's the same with the visuals that came out that was very interesting. They were very new, very raw, very glitchy.
00:33:42.596 - 00:34:16.614, Speaker C: Now, the same thing is happening with the AI videos. So I'm pretty excited to see more of those, to see more animations made with AI. It has like a special kind of charm, like this kind of abrupt movement. It's not so smooth at the moment. It's like this pulsating animation, which is pretty, pretty different to a normal animation, which is fun. But besides that, I'm always open. Now I'm more open and more interested in other kinds of genres and art.
00:34:16.614 - 00:35:10.944, Speaker C: Again, after seeing so much AI art, I also feel that sharpen my judgment about what's special, what's unique, what has a good idea, what has a good visual idea, and the conceptual idea and this kind of thing. So I'm happy that AI came out, like, at the same time that I started to see art, because it definitely helps to better your judgment, I would say, like, to think about what makes art special. Is it the visual? Is it the idea? Is it. Yeah. What makes it special? So it's pretty interesting, and I'm pretty happy that it aligned, timeline wise, all of this with me that I glitched into art on the blockchain and AI and all these kind of things.
00:35:11.964 - 00:35:57.602, Speaker A: It does sort of turbocharge your judgment, in a sense, or back to that idea. Your critical eye is, especially because it's like a whole different. I mean, you've made AI art as well, and as you know, it's like a completely different process from drawing. So all of a sudden, you know, if something is beautifully rendered, well, you're not thinking the aesthetic isn't like, oh, look at how, like, it can be beautiful in and of itself, but it's got, like, it. Like, as to your point, maybe it's just not as special or it has to be extra beautiful for it to be special in a sense. Like, so you're almost starting to look beyond, at other things. So it's an interesting place that you started.
00:35:57.602 - 00:36:43.656, Speaker A: And tell me what you think of this. I mean, what I'm most excited about when I see AI art now, weirdly, maybe, are the brushstrokes. I mean, that stuff, or what we maybe, let's expand that and let's just call it textures, because then you have someone like graphica there who I think is in the crowd here, has these beautiful, I'd say textures they're not so much brushstrokes, but then I see the work of strange thing and others, maybe Lily Illo and these beautiful brushstrokes. I feel like that is part of the newer AI, is they're really able to make, you know, brushstrokes that rival even would.
00:36:43.680 - 00:36:45.792, Speaker C: I'd be tempted to say like, you.
00:36:45.808 - 00:36:47.844, Speaker A: Know, traditional oil paintings.
00:36:48.824 - 00:37:37.772, Speaker C: Yeah, I think so. It's like to find what can the AI do different than other mediums before, you know, it's not so much interesting to have a photograph reproduced because we could already take photographs for me for my personal taste. But exactly like you say, which kind of visuals can you achieve with the AI painting in the brush strokes, how you call it? And yeah, you have the great example. You name some great examples. Graphica is one of my favorite artists in the space. And I feel it's like, just so he uses the AI glitches to perfection. Like it's there, there, but in the, like, you're always like drawn in what is happening in the, in his pieces.
00:37:37.772 - 00:37:55.034, Speaker C: You know, you, you, it combines, it combines the glitches with the aesthetics that are like, yeah, that you normally know. It's like this mix, like a simplistic piece and then there's this glitch that strikes out and you're like, wow, this is interesting.
00:37:55.534 - 00:38:18.514, Speaker A: Yeah, and maybe, sorry, go ahead. I was just going to say maybe there's something to be said for as you're sort of, I think you were kind of highlighting this idea that there are glitches, like celebrating the glitches that are, uh, native to AI, you know, as a way of kind of, you know, exploring the medium somewhat. And maybe those become a little bit more relevant, you know, in a, in a certain context.
00:38:18.894 - 00:38:57.570, Speaker C: Yeah. For me, this, these are the brushstrokes, the, the new ways of creating, like the oil, like, I don't know, other materials. These glitches are like the brushstrokes that are, that are, that only AI has, you know, that makes it special. If you can just reproduce things that already existed, it's just a way to mass production, but nothing else. Like there still can be beautiful pictures and you can use it for, I don't know, design stuff. But for me, art is always like disruptive in a way. It always tries to find something new and find something special in concepts, in visuals.
00:38:57.570 - 00:39:35.824, Speaker C: And, yeah, this is the art that I like, you know, that's something that you've tried to highlight the weird things that surround us. And with AI, that is like pretty weird. You can make that in a very new and innovative way. And I admire if artists are trying to use that to their advantage and try to go deep in what can I achieve with the AI that wasn't possible to achieve before. That's maybe it's something super difficult to, to even do. So this is very impressive for me.
00:39:36.164 - 00:39:39.556, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I completely agree. Sorry, go ahead, Bertin.
00:39:39.660 - 00:40:39.040, Speaker B: Sorry. I think one thing that's kind of interesting is the way AI has affected art outside of AI tools because, you know, like with photography and everything, just like, you know, using a camera, AI is capable of, you know, pushing out so many compositions, like really complicated images at just a huge rate of production. That's harder to do as an artist, just drawing, painting, even, whether that's with traditional mediums or on a tablet or something. And I see a lot more artists who are kind of ambitious in trying to do like, you hear these artists all the time that are trying to put out like a, an artwork a day or, you know, something to that effect. And I think part of that is just trying to keep up with the rate of production that AI tools allow other creators to accomplish it.
00:40:39.192 - 00:41:32.704, Speaker C: To me, it definitely like pushes the, I would not want to say mediocre, but if you want to earn money with your art, of course you need to have some kind of judgment, say, okay, this is good art. This is not so good art because why should I buy it? You know, you need to do, you need to judge it in some way to, can make the decision. This is art that I want to buy. So let's say like a mediocre illustration. Of course, now with AI, it will be pushed against the wall. It will lose its, its special, its specialty, you know, it will be very easy to reproduce. And this is a challenge, I feel it's also a challenge for artists to push themselves to find their, what makes their art special to others, you know, into images that can, can be recreated, maybe with AI.
00:41:32.704 - 00:42:13.782, Speaker C: So in the end, it's like the natural development that you have to push yourself to keep up to date and to still, to still sell your art. But the only thing that is problematic is that it's like swamped everywhere and it's hard to find the real good stuff. This is, for me, the hardest part about all these easily produced AI images. And for that, when I entered the space, I was like, eye curation. All this gatekeeping stuff, you know, we don't need it, but it's very much needed because it's just not possible in all the swamp to find everything that is good. It will be buried. So that I changed my opinion about that.
00:42:13.878 - 00:42:30.390, Speaker B: Yeah, I mean, one thing that is kind of crucial for digital artists, I feel like, is this, there's this demand to be productive and if you don't produce at least a couple artworks a week, or at least maybe one a.
00:42:30.422 - 00:42:32.542, Speaker C: Week, then it's easy to get kind.
00:42:32.558 - 00:43:04.864, Speaker B: Of buried beneath all the other image making that's being shared out there. And so that's, I mean, that's why I kind of brought up that point about AI kind of pushing artists to hustle a little bit harder. Do you feel, do you feel the same way? I see what you're saying where it's like, you know, just to say it the way you said it, like, you know, there's a lot of mediocrity being pushed just for the sake of keeping up with a rate of production.
00:43:06.284 - 00:43:38.584, Speaker C: Yeah, that's definitely a challenge, but it's like we need more content, real content curation, other projects that are, that are focused on art, that are spotlighting artists that are really, yeah. Challenging us and with their art. So I feel it's not another way. We won't go back. It won't be better. The next bull market for NFTs will be horrific. You know what, which kind of amount of AI art will be minted and try to get sold.
00:43:38.584 - 00:44:27.754, Speaker C: So we need to find a way to educate ourselves and more artists the same like collectors. You know, I also feel some artists are trying to use AI and produce images, but maybe they don't know how, how, how not special it is. Like how easy it is, actually. Like I, that I try to produce with, create images with AI and I always try to find something that I maybe can bring into it, you know, of course, in an amateur level because I'm not an artist and I'm very new to this, but like an idea, at least an idea that is different that I didn't see before, even though the visuals can, like, it looked like a photograph, but it may be some, some concept that I didn't see before or something like that.
00:44:28.854 - 00:44:35.794, Speaker A: Chaz Gold has been waiting very, very patiently on stage here. Chaz Gold, welcome to the show. Where are you calling from?
00:44:36.134 - 00:44:37.686, Speaker D: I'm from Portland, Oregon.
00:44:37.870 - 00:44:42.714, Speaker A: Oh, nice. Nice. So do you have a comment or a question?
00:44:43.614 - 00:45:08.618, Speaker D: So many comments, so many questions, so many thoughts. But I'm going to try to, try to break it down first. I want to say, like, about the mediocrity thing. Glad that somebody's finally saying something about it because like, I've been keeping my mouth shut about that for the longest time. I'm just like, I'm like, watching, like, art scroll by on my screen sometimes. I'm like, crap, crap, crap. Low, low effort.
00:45:08.618 - 00:45:23.172, Speaker D: Low effort. Low effort. Low effort. It's like, it drives me crazy when people like, it's like, if you're going to do AI art, put some effort into changing it a little bit from the, from just the prompt. If you're gonna do just prompt work, then sell it for less, less money.
00:45:23.228 - 00:45:23.484, Speaker A: Don't.
00:45:23.524 - 00:45:45.296, Speaker D: Don't charge people up the wazoo for something that you did in like 3 seconds, you know, I mean, like, I mean, you might. Prompting might be that good. And I know because I've been doing AI for two and a half years now. Like, art. I've been doing this since the early days of like, of like a wombo and, like, it, like, in like, a dream care night cafe. And. And God, God knows that I.
00:45:45.296 - 00:46:04.592, Speaker D: I probably sunk $1,500 into snowpixel dot app back in the day, you know, because I couldn't figure out how to do. My brain could not wrap around snow, get around about a Google Google cloud folders. I didn't understand it, didn't know it, didn't want to learn it. I figured, like, you just put money into it, I could just make more art and like, just get on with.
00:46:04.608 - 00:46:05.564, Speaker C: It, you know what I mean?
00:46:06.304 - 00:46:16.974, Speaker D: But I was going to add, the one thing I want to ask about that I didn't hear come up is additions versus one on ones. What's your thoughts on it?
00:46:18.434 - 00:46:45.726, Speaker C: Hey, nice to meet you first, and let me say one comment to what you said. I feel it doesn't even have to do with the medium. If there's a lot of mediocre art, it just has to be like that. Because to something to be great, there needs to be also something that is not so great. It's just normal. And we see that in every kind of medium. But just with AI, it's pushed into an extreme number that you see every day.
00:46:45.726 - 00:47:29.834, Speaker C: And it is challenging, like you said. But it has, for me, not so much to do with if it's raw AI, because you can still have a vision. Like, for example, Inigo Bilbao, he like, is making this horrific human AI animal computer sculptures with AI that are completely raw. He doesn't change a thing. He just pushes himself, produces so many outputs, tries to like, find a little different word. I don't know how he does it to arrive at his, at his pieces.
00:47:30.974 - 00:47:33.554, Speaker D: How to curate all your final images. Of what you're saying.
00:47:34.234 - 00:47:57.854, Speaker C: Exactly. And then if you have a good idea, if you just produce raw, you say, like, make something with it, and most of the time, it's. This is important, but there can be raw AI art that has, like, a concept. Like. Like, a concept that is interesting, that you can still say, this is so much better than art that is, like, I don't know, produced in one month, you know, but very rarely.
00:47:58.314 - 00:48:07.002, Speaker D: Yeah, I'm just saying, like, I just don't hate. I hate seeing art that looks like somebody walked across your keyboard and smash your keyboard and mid journey, and you got something cool out of it.
00:48:07.098 - 00:48:07.482, Speaker C: I don't know.
00:48:07.498 - 00:48:12.094, Speaker D: Maybe I can, just. Because I've been doing it for so long, maybe I can just tell, like, when people have done that.
00:48:13.354 - 00:48:39.772, Speaker C: I think so. Yeah, I think so. And that's important that you. I would recommend every artist, collector, and everyone to just see. I don't know if it's. The easiest thing is to try to produce oneself or to see, like, the mid journey feet, and then you can. Yeah, you get an idea of which things are very easily reproduced and done and without the real, like, artistic idea.
00:48:39.908 - 00:49:10.784, Speaker D: With, like, people learning their prompting really, really well in tighting. So tight that, like, you can prompt something perfect straight out of the. Out of, like, the first. The first run. But it took that person usually, like, I know personally, for me, it's taken me years to get to where I can write those kind of prompts, and now I'm. I'm trying to go back from mid journey back over to stable diffusion, and I'm like, I'm having a hard time transitioning back over to civil diffusion because the prompting is a whole different animal over there. And I was like, man, I forgot about this.
00:49:10.784 - 00:49:35.064, Speaker D: I was like, wow. You know, but, you know, I can tell it's almost. It's the whole story of Picasso. And the lady walks in the end of the cafe and asked him to him to draw something for her, and he gets something out on the napkin, and he hands it and goes, that's $300, please. She's like, $300? You just draw something for, like, 10 seconds on the napkin. He was like, yeah, but it's the 30 years of experience that I got here to draw that in that napkin that I'm charging for.
00:49:35.444 - 00:49:38.668, Speaker C: Yeah, I love. I love that story. That's really funny.
00:49:38.756 - 00:49:50.104, Speaker A: It's almost an argument for rock AI in the end. And ella, I want to bring Ella on stage here, who has also been waiting patiently here. Ella, welcome to the show where are you calling from.
00:49:51.124 - 00:49:51.636, Speaker C: Thank you.
00:49:51.660 - 00:50:01.844, Speaker E: Good afternoon. I'm calling from London. So, yeah, thank you so much for bringing me up on stage. I really appreciate it. If it's okay, I just wanted to chip in on the discussion that's going on.
00:50:02.004 - 00:50:06.144, Speaker A: Absolutely, yeah. Question, comment, whatever you like. Go for it.
00:50:06.724 - 00:50:35.964, Speaker E: Yeah. Okay. So we've got into the whole AI thing again, which is absolutely fine because AI is a huge topic. It is the single most transformative technology of our generation. You know, it's up there with the invention of the printing press or the invention of the Internet in terms of what it's going to do to human society. And I'm not just talking about art, I'm talking about the technology itself that underpins these, you know, these tools that we're all using. There's a lot of low effort AI around now.
00:50:35.964 - 00:51:07.286, Speaker E: I completely agree. And if anything, I mean, I did traditional art for 20 years or whatever, however old I am, I don't know, my whole life. Used AI for about the last year. And it is the amount of low effort stuff that's out there that is actually, it's kind of almost pushing, certainly me and other people as well away from wanting to use it because, you know, if you come up with anything cool, somebody's just going to slap it into mid journey. Use the describe function and there's going to be 20 low rent ripoffs before you've even posted it on your timeline.
00:51:07.350 - 00:51:17.824, Speaker A: You know, I've tried that. It actually, I did. I found it didn't really work. I was just kind of curious if that's. If the describe work, have you tried it? And it works?
00:51:18.524 - 00:52:03.106, Speaker E: I've used it on some of my own stuff as a test when I was still doing AI. I've kind of stopped mostly recently, but yeah, if I could get a really close result by using describe and then reprompting, I'd been it an idea basically, because I know I'm just going to get copied in 3 seconds, which is sad, but the point I wanted to make was a few months ago you had grant young copies everywhere. It was minimalism, wall to wall, everybody doing rip off minimalism. And then a few months before that, you had, you know, I don't want to sound like I'm throwing shade on anyone, but there was a lot of, you know, women in leopard print, you know, you know, that kind of specific style of illustration. Again, nothing wrong with that if you like that style of art. But it was everywhere. It was wall to wall.
00:52:03.106 - 00:52:36.406, Speaker E: And then before that, you had, you know, 18 months ago, half a foundation was anime. You know, so there are trends and there are always going to be trends and there's always going to be some people that execute those trends beautifully with real thought, real, real effort, real passion, real conviction, because they love that style of art. And then there's going to be a herd of people copying them because they see an easy buck. And I don't feel like it's fair to beat AI up for that particular thing because it's just going to be the next style, the next trend, whatever it is, in another few months time. Anyway, that was just what I came up to say. And thank you so much for allowing.
00:52:36.430 - 00:52:37.342, Speaker C: Me to say it.
00:52:37.478 - 00:53:25.168, Speaker A: Well, it's an absolute pleasure. And I think you bring up some very interesting points. Ella. You know, my take on that whole thing is if it's that easy to copy, I think it should be pushed further. I think then it's probably too easy to make. I mean, maybe that's, again, if the describe function works that well, then maybe that's not a fair point on my side, but I think if it's that easy, then it should be pushed further. Maybe there should be more editing, maybe there should be more blending of other works so that, you know, because if you're using the blend command on mid journey, I would be surprised if people could easily reproduce that without kind of knowing what the source image was, for example.
00:53:25.168 - 00:54:07.004, Speaker A: You know, and it's so, it's quite interesting, you know. And to your point though, I think it. Yeah, I think it should be. Or adding to your point, I think it should be harder to make than being able to copy it that fast. I think it needs to be pushed further because when I'm making art, it's not like you take the first AI thing that you get and then you go, okay, now it's for sale. Probably some people do that. But I mean, as we had clownvamp on, he described his process as like, it sounded like thousands of images were involved before that kind of final, you know, special image that Clownvamp wanted to, you know, use and release.
00:54:07.004 - 00:54:11.336, Speaker A: Do you have any quick comments on that before I turn it over to.
00:54:11.360 - 00:54:14.124, Speaker B: You don't know who we are 100%.
00:54:14.424 - 00:54:53.362, Speaker E: If you're doing AI right, then you're treating it almost like a photographer does. You know, you take thousands and thousands of pictures and you need skill and experience and knowledge just to get your shots set up and to know which pictures to take. But then you end up with thousand and it goes back to what the guys were saying before you've got to be able to curate, and then you've also got to be able to edit. I don't think I've ever spent any less than about. I think the quickest was about 4 hours, but usually eight to 12 hours on any AI piece that I've actually minted. All the post processing, the tweaking, just getting it exactly right. And yeah, I agree wholeheartedly with everything you say.
00:54:53.362 - 00:54:56.792, Speaker E: It comes down to effort and intent. If you really want to sum it.
00:54:56.808 - 00:55:00.000, Speaker C: Up in a single sentence, beautifully summed.
00:55:00.032 - 00:55:11.564, Speaker A: Up there, I appreciate the. Just the economic language there. You don't know who we are. Welcome to the show. Thank you for joining us. Where are you calling from? And you don't need to tell us.
00:55:12.184 - 00:55:12.808, Speaker C: Hi.
00:55:12.936 - 00:55:49.264, Speaker F: Poco belli Roentum and Unel collector and every friend in Santiago and everyone. It's nice to be here among friends. And I'm talking from Brazil and the interior of so Paulo. And it's so nice to hear you guys talk. And I've been following, following no collector for some time. And it's always a pleasure to read the threads that he makes, hear the.
00:55:49.564 - 00:55:50.724, Speaker C: His thoughts.
00:55:50.804 - 00:55:54.156, Speaker F: His thoughts and know about.
00:55:54.340 - 00:55:55.064, Speaker C: He.
00:55:55.484 - 00:56:35.344, Speaker F: He brought the process of the collecting. And I have to say that it's more, more good to hear his voice. And now here, actually, he's saying how passionate he is about collecting art. It makes all the difference. And if, and I know that you collect from a lot of brazilian artists, then that is big, big, huge for us. And, you know, it's very hard to make living in Brazil from art. So it's a great thing to have to support and to feel evaluated.
00:56:36.084 - 00:56:36.824, Speaker C: And.
00:56:39.164 - 00:57:31.920, Speaker F: I want to talk about to. About this, what you're talking about. AI works because from the first time that I saw some I works, too, I didn't like them. And I was very. I don't know, I didn't like so much of the I works that I were seeing. But after I. I started using it and, I don't know, found out that this could be a great creative partner, it changed my mind and I don't know, using the photographs that we took from some physical masks and creating other works of AI has been so great.
00:57:31.920 - 00:58:16.894, Speaker F: You know, like to see our creativity and the technology being together to create another images and another kind of masks and styles and I don't know every single of this and I don't know. I just want to thank you all. And I want to ask to uno collector what he. What are. What he think about what makes, like an artist unique and how he judges it if he do some research, and I don't know that kind of stuff. And thank you all.
00:58:19.274 - 00:59:01.040, Speaker C: Thanks for that. That was very nice words. And I agree, it's a big chance for, like, artists in Brazil. Yeah, I heard a lot of talk about a lot of artists of Brazil that they said that it was tough to sell art, and now with NFTs, they have the chance. And there are a lot of super talented men and women in Brazil that are creating art. And so it's glad that we could, with NFT space, open the door for them to show their talent and their vision to the world. And hopefully this is just a start to your question, what makes somebody special? I would say this changed a lot.
00:59:01.040 - 00:59:59.312, Speaker C: You know, I changed from seeing just one image to trying to see, like, what is the vision of the artist? Like, this is for me, we have a lot of new artists in the space that are just finding their voice, that are experimenting. This is so nice. And you can see, I love to see the process, like, where they started, where they're now, and there are some that are creating for so many years, and you can see that in their pieces, too, that they already found their, their vision. They have different, maybe visualities, like I always saw here, Sky Goodman now, and, for example, has so much different visual ideas, I would say. But it's always possible to see the artistic voice behind it all. And this is something very special. And I think that we all forget that a lot here with the fast paced world.
00:59:59.312 - 01:01:08.232, Speaker C: And we always hype an artist for some months and then he's forgotten and tried to make money. Some collectors tried to make money with that and the hypes that we said and all this kind of stuff. But the real value and the real, like, who's doing something special or not will be visible in for most, in maybe some years, you know, to see if they, they kept producing and kept creating art that pushes their own vision and their own view on the world and on art. Yeah. So I'm trying to always, like, see now than before, try to see the history of an artist and see where they come from on the blockchain because, yeah, I don't have other references at least. But, yeah, to see what is, this is the most interesting part for me, like, where somebody starts and if they are professional for 30 years or if they're like a newcomer and they try to make it here, here and do they have interesting ideas and do they have the passion and, yeah, these kind.
01:01:08.248 - 01:01:21.760, Speaker A: Of things, do they have the vision? Santiago and we're going to have to be faster here because I have a moving truck coming in about 20 minutes here. Santiago, welcome to the show. Calling from.
01:01:21.832 - 01:01:30.724, Speaker G: How are you guys? How are you? Bogo roul, you see? How are you doing? It's great to hear you.
01:01:31.404 - 01:01:33.384, Speaker A: Great to hear you, too, santiago.
01:01:35.844 - 01:01:44.064, Speaker G: I was sent to earth to fight with a no collector, but I will be easy on him today. How are you, man?
01:01:44.404 - 01:01:48.068, Speaker C: Hello, how are you? All good.
01:01:48.236 - 01:02:34.264, Speaker G: It was great to hear your story. Really beautiful chat, and it was very cool, too. That AI is still a hot topic. It brings some different views and it sounds fun. Always makes think, at least for this short period, that is so important. So, yeah, I was gonna ask about your artist side. You have been making some ideas about the space, right? Turning them into prompts and artworks.
01:02:34.264 - 01:02:36.624, Speaker G: And how will that follow?
01:02:38.204 - 01:03:19.770, Speaker C: That's a good question. First of all, I love the energy, and I love the portuguese pronunciation of the English, like, with a lot of energy. So you bring some. Almost finishing the space, but now we are awake again. So for my art, I, of my creations, I would say. I wouldn't say that I'm an artist because you have to prove that you're an artist for some time and not just say, I'm a for me at least, you know, but my creations, I don't really have, like, a plan for them because I can't pressure it. I don't want to just sell something.
01:03:19.770 - 01:03:50.906, Speaker C: It's not about that. It's more about do I have fun and do I have feel that it is adding at least a little bit to something, you know, that I. That I feel satisfied that I. That I found something new for myself inside the art or that I could convey a message through art that. That maybe is a little bit more that stays, you know, that's the cool thing about art, that it stays on the blockchain and will be there. Tweets go away. Bad tweets go away.
01:03:50.906 - 01:04:09.690, Speaker C: Thanks, God. Also, you know, we deserve. We don't deserve some tweets and. Yeah, so my. This is a whole different journey. I take all the time that I have. I don't think that I'm especially talented or something as an artist.
01:04:09.690 - 01:04:36.014, Speaker C: I have no. I do some AI art and hope I can go from there when I have some more time and some faces with less projects that I can explore. Also digital painting and all these kind of different mediums to just have fun and grow and see where it's going and see if the ideas are coming and, yeah, I don't. I don't want to pressure myself with that and I'm not doing it.
01:04:37.994 - 01:04:40.298, Speaker A: Excellent. Go ahead. Go ahead.
01:04:40.426 - 01:05:17.244, Speaker G: May I ask just one more short question? Yeah, thanks, Poco. How do you see this kind of crossing roles would be, but it's just the nature of this space now. But collectors that get the itch to make art and many do great stuff and artists constantly collecting art. How do you see this? I guess positively. But what's your reading on all this happening in this period of time and in this art scene?
01:05:18.144 - 01:06:00.656, Speaker C: I think, like, what I think is not perfect. It's like when an art and collector makes. We had that before that he made like a pretty easily reproduced image without, interestingly for me, and sold very high and these kind of things feels a little bit unfair towards the artists that create for all their life and so much. They have so much ideas and so much skills and so much. Yeah. Everything that art needs and they are struggling, but it's like, it is the world's not fair. So in general, I love that, that collectors create because it opens also your mind up to a different angle to art.
01:06:00.656 - 01:07:09.804, Speaker C: You can learn about, like appreciate different things in the process differently and you learn much more and you maybe realize what is important to look up or to research or to learn about and read about. And so it's, that's very cool and very important somehow to appreciate art more that you are collecting. And then on the opposite side, I hope this will re, will be rewarded in the future that a lot of artists now not only are minting themselves, but also collecting from other artists and hopefully have some masterpieces that will be worth a lot in the future so they can create with more calm also in this kind of like, perspective that they had some great investments. I wish that. I think it's not super, like, who knows? You know, who knows? Maybe always we will keep chasing the trends and all the art that we collected will stay worthless. But I don't think so. And when you look how collecting works in general in the world and the psychology behind it, I don't think that this will change so much.
01:07:09.804 - 01:07:36.118, Speaker C: And, yeah, so I hope that it will pay off for everyone that is collecting art on the side as an artist. And I love to see it and I always love to browse collections of artists because if I have an artist that I think is very great, that I love, that I love, I'm almost sure if, if that artist collects art that this, that is great art that they collect.
01:07:36.166 - 01:08:15.048, Speaker A: So, yeah, yeah, I think it was art gnome that was saying artists make the best collectors. And I thought that was just an interesting point, whether it's true or not. And I think it's also interesting what you're mentioning about how collectors, there's a real benefit for collectors in making art. I think it really helps you kind of develop as a collector. And I also just like, it's another thing I really like about this space is the wall that's breaking down between the artist and the collector. Artists are becoming much bigger collectors than they are in the contemporary art world. Collectors are becoming artists, and sometimes they're pretty darn good.
01:08:15.048 - 01:08:28.564, Speaker A: So it's really interesting. And AI and pixel art totally makes that possible. MVP, welcome to the show. Are you still here? Yes, MVP is still here and asked you to make it a little bit quicker if possible.
01:08:28.984 - 01:08:30.044, Speaker B: Welcome back.
01:08:34.624 - 01:08:36.164, Speaker A: You may be on mute.
01:08:37.444 - 01:08:38.276, Speaker C: Are you still here?
01:08:38.300 - 01:08:42.604, Speaker A: Oh, MVP might have had to go. Oh, there he. Okay, MVP can't speak.
01:08:42.644 - 01:08:43.716, Speaker C: I feel it doesn't work.
01:08:43.740 - 01:08:45.344, Speaker A: I'm going to invite to speak again.
01:08:46.204 - 01:08:50.396, Speaker C: Like he is not muted or they are not muted, but you might have.
01:08:50.420 - 01:09:02.624, Speaker A: Pressed the wrong button. I invited you to speak, MVP. So in the meantime, we will quickly go to it's Nas. Welcome to the show. If you have a quick question or comment for unknown collector, go for it.
01:09:03.104 - 01:09:03.624, Speaker H: Yeah.
01:09:03.704 - 01:09:04.032, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:09:04.088 - 01:10:13.412, Speaker H: Thank you so much. So hey, everyone, thanks for having me. Yeah, I have a question and about the unknown collector because when I'm joining to the NFT space, I met the unknown collector as the attend ten people I know in the NFT space. So, and I know you as a builder all the time. You know, it's not about the collector or artist, you know. And my question is what's the purpose about the building? And are you thinking the people understanding your concern about the NFT culture? Because I saw many times you down because of the behavior of NFT culture. And sometimes I like you and I really love to know about what's your purpose about building the community or building the NFT culture in web theory.
01:10:13.412 - 01:10:15.224, Speaker H: So, yeah, thank you so much.
01:10:16.004 - 01:10:55.574, Speaker C: So thanks. That's a good question. I would say it's a long question. I will try to make it short because we don't have much time. But for me, the more important than money, for example, is like to have a passion about something that you wake up and you are passionate about to do it and to grow something. You don't even know where it will go. I'm not sure what is my purpose of it, but I know that before this, I was always very without a lot of motivation to to, like, really professionally saying to start my day.
01:10:55.574 - 01:11:25.268, Speaker C: And I didn't know what I want to do with my life. Like something with a bigger purpose. I have a master's degree in psychology, but I always felt that it's also very heavy on myself in this kind of job. Like, it's a lot of pressure and it's tough to really be happy surrounded by so heavy prones all the time. So I was like, you need to be very strong to do this kind of job. And I was not very happy. And I.
01:11:25.268 - 01:11:51.824, Speaker C: When, since I discovered art in this space and I saw that I can have like an influence. I, not an influence, but I try to always say that, don't take it seriously. Like you, I am growing in this space like everyone else. And it's so beautiful that you. I have the chance as an art outsider to. To grow and to make my opinion up and people listening and I don't get excluded. Like, it's the same in the.
01:11:51.824 - 01:12:25.284, Speaker C: For artists then for me, like a collective curator in the traditional world, you know, here you have the chance to be heard and to participate at least a little bit. You know, often we are not heard and we're ignored and types and scans and these things are bigger. But in the end, like, every little change that we, that we can do is worth something. That's. That's what I feel. So I'm just trying to push my ideals of. Of putting the artist and the art first to.
01:12:25.284 - 01:13:14.248, Speaker C: To give them something that they. That we can create, something that really helps to change something in the life of an artist. Because I feel, for me at least, it opens so much doors mentally and from a happiness point of view, to see so much great art and to dive into it and to really try to understand or feel it even. And often art can't be understandable, but just felt, you know, and it's something beautiful. And I just feel that it's the right thing. And I'm not sure where this all will go, but since I started, there was always a new project that I could take on and everything was a learning experience, even though this is all like, voluntarily unpaid. And at some point I probably need to see if I can keep going doing it, because we only need to live.
01:13:14.248 - 01:13:42.164, Speaker C: But it's just so much fun. And I hope I can continue and I will find the next project, I will find the next step and that I can keep pushing the space like I want to see it. That is like favoring artists. And I try not to see all the shit that is happening on the side to really, like, see my vision for it and that I keep going after it and that I not. Doesn't matter what happens on the side.
01:13:44.104 - 01:13:47.272, Speaker A: Absolutely. You know, it's funny.
01:13:47.408 - 01:13:48.176, Speaker C: Going somewhere.
01:13:48.240 - 01:13:50.432, Speaker B: Sorry, sorry.
01:13:50.568 - 01:13:52.368, Speaker A: You cut out for a second there.
01:13:52.536 - 01:13:56.604, Speaker C: No, no, no. It was the perfect moment. It was. I was finished.
01:13:56.724 - 01:14:26.486, Speaker A: Okay, good. I was just going to say, you know, it's funny, I miss, like, so much of the stuff that happens on the side and I wonder if it's just because I'm so. I follow the artists that I like and everything and just artists in general and I miss a lot of it. I'm always like, where's everybody getting all this information from? MVP, welcome back to the stage. Can you make it quick? Because I actually have to leave in about less than maybe eight minutes here, so maybe a quick question here or comment, whatever you like.
01:14:26.550 - 01:14:27.486, Speaker C: Welcome back.
01:14:27.670 - 01:14:34.470, Speaker I: Hey, thanks for bringing me back up. Sorry, it's the typical twitter rug ville for sure.
01:14:34.622 - 01:14:35.794, Speaker A: Hardcore today.
01:14:36.974 - 01:15:12.894, Speaker I: Yeah, thanks for having unknown on and unknown, thanks for being on. Just wanted to express my appreciation for what you do for the space as an art educator. Just love the voice that you bring to the space and I think the respect that you'd garnered from speaking your mind and not being afraid to say things that need to be said, I think that the space needs a voice like yours in it. So definitely just wanted to come up and say, I read you, I hear you and keep on keeping on, man.
01:15:13.754 - 01:15:45.904, Speaker C: I appreciate it. Thank you so much. Always nice to hear, to keep staying motivated because, yeah, sometimes I think we all have that. We think, like, it's just so abstract to live in this virtual digital space that just is like, words and images. So sometimes we need to remind ourselves that this is real and that we are doing something that we believe in and has some purpose for ourselves and for people around us. So it's nice to hear these words.
01:15:46.724 - 01:15:49.700, Speaker A: I echo that. Beautifully put. Sorry, go ahead, MVP.
01:15:49.772 - 01:16:29.684, Speaker I: No, thanks. Thanks, Paco. Just one more quick question. I wonder what you think about, like, legacy works that are being minted and brought into the marketplace and, or if you want to speak to any kind of, like, traditional media. And it kind of just seems like, at least for now, the trend is for, like, whatever is new is kind of what's popular and being bought by collectors. And I wonder if it's just, if it's a pendulum, it'll swing back the other way, or if really what NFTs do represent is kind of avant garde, cutting edge of the art space.
01:16:30.744 - 01:17:45.410, Speaker C: So I think it's like we are mixing here in this space, like this fast, making money with art and with collecting in the traditional way. So it's very mixed and we all feel it's all just one pot, but it's happening, like at the same time, you know, there will always be people trying to make money on hypes. And I don't know how it works, how they do it, but I'm sure they are somehow pushing it to get value that is not there. I think that, like historic works and all these kind of things will always have appreciation in some circles and will always be important. And we can also see that with generative art, like art blocks now have like their new. In midst of the bear market, there is like the appreciation for it so much. And so I also think that, like with photography, like the really good photography collections that, that were like shaping the space in the beginning and also something that is coming new, that maybe has like something a new twist on photography, I think you need to stand out, of course, to the mass of collections, but like the historic, very good collections that, that are out there, they will gain in value.
01:17:45.410 - 01:18:13.628, Speaker C: But it needs time. It needs a lot of time. It needs more people that understand what is the value of a photography on the blockchain. Like, it's revolutionary that, that you minted a piece of photography on the blockchain before AI could recreate everything, you know, before it could recreate every photograph. And you had this piece here minted in this time that is very short. Like when this time span before. Before NFTs and before AI.
01:18:13.628 - 01:18:38.772, Speaker C: This is so short. This time span is so. It will be so important in the future and in. It takes time. It takes time. And I think that's the thing that we always forget because everything is so fast lived and so hyped and, and we should, yeah, we should. We should take a step back and try to understand that it's not like to sell, it's not easy and it's.
01:18:38.772 - 01:19:06.464, Speaker C: It shouldn't be the main priority. Of course, if you live from it, it's a different kind of story. But you need to like give in to a lot of pressure, like, like Runtoon said, like mass produce more because you need to keep up with the space to do, to sell constantly. So I think we just need time. We need to mature. We need more educators, like real people that know about art, that are heard. So I always am open to.
01:19:06.464 - 01:19:47.350, Speaker C: To listen to people that, that have like a lot of experience and that I can. That I can borrow my voice and I always try to borrow my voice to people that are not heard, but that have a lot to say. And it's, yeah, because social media is a strange place. You know, it's popularity and these kind of things and it's very, at the end, it's a little bit stupid actually. But that's why I started my account. I visioned that I can somehow give a positive voice the midst of all the grifters and scammers and people trying to make money. And it's, now it's slowed down in the bear, but it's, it's happening and we're, we're getting hurt.
01:19:47.350 - 01:19:50.478, Speaker C: And I hope to continue like, like this.
01:19:50.646 - 01:19:59.686, Speaker A: Well, exactly like MVP says, you are being heard. Unknown collector and vige, very quickly, do you have a question? Comment for unknown collector hello.
01:19:59.750 - 01:20:29.466, Speaker H: Hello, everyone. I sent a lot of love from Greece. Yeah, I have some more questions and very thankful for this. All of, I can tell a lot of educational information was thank you so much. Really appreciate. One more question. I wanted to ask you how you choose artists or photographer or someone, another artist for collection.
01:20:29.466 - 01:20:45.734, Speaker H: It's someone on spearing or you know this person so long time and you follow him and take a look what do what going on or you just come in random take and go away.
01:20:47.634 - 01:21:13.832, Speaker C: Yeah. So that's also a good question. It changed a lot in the beginning. I was like, want to help as many people as possible. As many artists just collected one piece of everyone and it was like exciting and I don't know, but it's not some like, it's, it's also hindering the growth of both because you feel responsible for so many artists, like a little bit, but you cannot keep up. I cannot. I collected from I'm not sure.
01:21:13.832 - 01:21:54.994, Speaker C: I'm sure we are getting close to 1000 different artists. So it's impossible to keep like helping them and pushing their art and this kind of thing. So now then also I don't have money anymore. I spent it all. And I try to focus when I collect, I always try to focus on artists that I really think that I really believe in them, that I believe in their vision, that I believe in their visual, that I believe in their concept, in their, in their grit, in their passion. And I try to keep supporting them if I have some money to spare. So that's at the moment my strategy.
01:21:54.994 - 01:22:31.064, Speaker C: I think we need it all. We need the streaks of collecting from somebody that gets into nfts and addictedness like collecting everything. And this is also something that lifts up the spirit and that everybody sees. Yeah, we're still going. And it's like the first time now since always we had slow phases, but there was coming one collector collecting it all, and it was always fun. But now we have a little bit of a very slow, very, very slow time. So I hope somebody will find their love for art and NFT soon, and they go crazy with their money.
01:22:31.564 - 01:22:45.080, Speaker A: Well, like you say, it's like, it's too much fun to imagine this going away, you know? Like, it really is fun for those that get into it. August ground, glad to have you on the show. Be very quick, if you can, in the dying minutes of the show.
01:22:45.212 - 01:22:45.536, Speaker C: All right.
01:22:45.560 - 01:22:49.144, Speaker A: Can you hear me, sir? Loud and clear. Fabulous.
01:22:49.224 - 01:22:52.032, Speaker C: I just want to say, especially to.
01:22:52.048 - 01:23:21.286, Speaker A: The two of you, that passion, that sort of leap of faith, is precisely what creates value in art. And we are the people. If you look traditionally at things that weren't considered art and that were sort of peripheral or problematic, it's the people that have that sort of passion or leap of faith that brought that work to the world.
01:23:21.430 - 01:23:22.606, Speaker C: And I think that's what the two.
01:23:22.630 - 01:23:29.634, Speaker A: Of you are doing. And I just want to commend you on that because sometimes it's really fucking difficult.
01:23:31.494 - 01:23:36.074, Speaker C: So, yeah, that's all. Thanks a lot.
01:23:36.374 - 01:23:47.800, Speaker A: Very nice of you to say that, August, and great to hear from you. I see the comments. Let me wrap this up here. Unknown collector, do you have any final thoughts before we turn to runetune and sign off here?
01:23:47.872 - 01:24:13.022, Speaker C: Yeah. I want to say to your show and how you do things, and I love, like, you keep pushing every day, your artist journals, you're not even sure, like, where this will go. You're just doing it out of passion and, like, better, in a very incredible way. And I hope that more people will find these artist journals and they will look back at it at some time. We're like, wow, this. This guy, like, what a passion. The start of the NFT world.
01:24:13.022 - 01:24:29.514, Speaker C: And he was, like, just putting it out there and with a lot of sensibility and thought and always caring for what is the community, telling him, you're doing a great job, and I hope more people will find you soon.
01:24:29.854 - 01:24:57.606, Speaker A: Well, I totally appreciate it. And you showing up on spaces like this definitely helps that mission. And, you know, just on that point, like, what's so weird about it for me? I mean, it's weird for me, too, obviously, in the sense that I don't know what's going to be said, where the discussion's going to go. Like, it. It really is a community effort. Like, I'm amazed at where the show is going in the sense just intellectually, like, and I almost, you know, I'm moving. I almost didn't do the last show, and I was so glad I did.
01:24:57.606 - 01:25:18.564, Speaker A: I was like, that was so interesting where it went. And, you know, when I don't do the show, it's not like the conversation continues in my head and develops, you know, maybe a little bit, but nowhere near as fast. So it really is. It's socratic, you know. So I appreciate the thoughts, but it really is a conversation. Rune tune. Do you have any final thoughts before we sign off here?
01:25:18.904 - 01:25:33.214, Speaker B: No, I think MVP said it best. You know, unknown collector, your authenticity and your passion definitely comes through very loud and clear, and we all appreciate you for that. Thanks for coming on and talking with all of us.
01:25:33.634 - 01:25:39.282, Speaker C: Thanks. It was a pleasure. I hope we do it someday again. A lot to talk about still.
01:25:39.418 - 01:25:54.540, Speaker A: Well, we would love to have you back. So maybe in like, I don't know, five or six months or something, whenever. Let's do that again. For sure. Thank you, everybody, for coming on stage. Thank you, unknown collector. Thank you, runetune, and thank you, everybody else out there listening.
01:25:54.540 - 01:26:01.104, Speaker A: Thank you for just another awesome show, and I hope you have a great week. And until next time, take care.
01:26:01.484 - 01:26:02.204, Speaker C: Thanks and bye.
