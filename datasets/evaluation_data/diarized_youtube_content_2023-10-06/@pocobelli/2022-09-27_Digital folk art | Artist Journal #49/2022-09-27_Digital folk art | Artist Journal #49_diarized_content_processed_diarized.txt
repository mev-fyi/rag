00:00:10.760 - 00:01:10.734, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 27, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, your artist reporter, who is so happy that we have such great work to talk about on a daily basis here. Again, I mean, I've said it a million times, I'm having more fun checking my notifications on object than I am going to contemporary art galleries. And frankly, it's not even close. And another kind of interesting thing is, I'm trying to think to myself if I've ever bought physical art in my life before, other than a poster. Other than a poster at a university art fair for my wall, you know, of a beach, I think it was a beach scene with palm trees, you know, which is kind of funny. You know, ironically, you might notice in the background here, a lot of my walls are bare.
00:01:10.734 - 00:01:22.482, Speaker A: I do put up some of my own art, actually. Maybe you can see that. You can see these. Those are really big screen prints. But anyway, I'm getting off topic here. So. Yeah, so there's a.
00:01:22.482 - 00:01:51.714, Speaker A: But here I go. You know, I've drawn back my spending a lot, but I have spent a fortune on this platform. So all to say something's working. Fx hash. We have a new project on FX hash. This was retweeted by Bzzaya. And if we look at the project, I mean, again, contemporary, you see the weed pipe, you see the gluten free breadsticks or whatever they are.
00:01:51.714 - 00:02:13.936, Speaker A: This is interesting, this strawberry. And again, FX hash is where. Let me see. I think. Yeah, where you can see they're using, basically it randomizes layers. And when you mint on the platform, it'll render a work for you. And so you can see what's going on here.
00:02:13.936 - 00:02:51.956, Speaker A: So again, kind of a new kind of art that is based on half algorithm, half creativity, and then using random. So, I mean, using randomness. So this is very, I'd say it's working with a lot of themes that exist in what we might consider the traditional or contemporary art world. It is by La Agust, if I'm pronouncing that right, table landscapes. And I just want to read the first line here because I thought it was actually interesting. It's a little artist statement y in here, but just the first landscape. So we have a clue.
00:02:51.956 - 00:03:38.474, Speaker A: Table landscapes is my first generative NFT project, a reflection about micropolitics based on fragments of everyday life scenarios that can be seen in the presence of objects of use, consumption and contemplation, and also an in depth study of packaging as a discursive device and its possible rhetoric. So all to say, its contemporary objects in a contemporary setting using the still life. So very cool. I thought you can still get it. There's only 87 of 332 minted, and it's pretty cheap mint. And you can see a lot of them here. So again, I just thought, like a nice, you know, contemporary art, or like just a new.
00:03:38.474 - 00:04:09.558, Speaker A: Again, an art of the present. This is what I'm getting at here. And I think, you know, I thought particularly the weed pipe was interesting. I think the gluten free, again, the stuff that just makes it like something you would see if you went over to your buddy's house and your counterculture buddy's house. And we're looking around, is this like some sort of sex toy here? You see, it's kind of got, again, a bit of a. I don't want to call it counterculture. That's pretty mainstream these days.
00:04:09.558 - 00:04:31.589, Speaker A: A collar, right? So kind of edgy. Some cookies, I mean, rope around. So kind of suggestive there in a kind of surrealist way that's interesting. Almost an s and m kind of vibe on the cookies there. So very fun, very interesting work there. What is that called? Table landscapes. Great title.
00:04:31.589 - 00:05:04.474, Speaker A: Great, great title. So also, speaking of Bazaya, he put out a new work, El Macol, which is a homage to the great Mikey Wilson in the retro rare wrestlers series. See if that works there, like creme de creme. And so I thought this was hilarious blockbuster written over with Mikey Wilson's jpegs. And one of one offers selected multi editions, three by two, etcetera. So I think, really cool. It was interesting.
00:05:04.474 - 00:05:39.692, Speaker A: The release on this was what I'm calling a silent release. It was like that Adelia, someone had commented, remember the Adelia that I had missed? And I was like, oh, I never saw that. I guess I had too many notifications. Well, someone wrote in and they said, well, actually, that's on a discord. And you have to be in Adelia's discord to be aware of the release. And I think that's what was going on here as well. And so just an interesting thing, I think it's really the reason they do this is probably to prevent the flippers from coming in and just, you know, inflating the prices.
00:05:39.692 - 00:06:13.992, Speaker A: So, you know, and it's, again, it's interesting. Like, on one hand, the last thing I want, you know, just to bring up Adelia's piece here, because I thought it was so kind of ironic what she was showing as her piece that she released, which is this digital exhaustion. As I was about to say, the last thing I want is kind of another digital thing I have to check in on. Like, you know, you could extrapolate. Okay, so Adelian and Bezaya. Okay, sure. I'll join the discord if I can find it, and then.
00:06:13.992 - 00:06:52.706, Speaker A: Okay, and I'll check in and hope. But I mean, what if you have, like, 50 artists that you track and are you gonna. So that's one side, which is just like, oh, no, another thing that's gonna kill time, and I'm gonna end up like the person on here. On the other hand. On the other hand, though, I was thinking to myself, you know, to have these, it's kind of a really cool thing as an artist. If you want to build your community kind of beyond Twitter, it sounds like kind of an exciting way to do it. Like, you can do all sorts of stuff in discord if you can convince people to give you that time to do it.
00:06:52.706 - 00:07:27.904, Speaker A: But if you're, you know, people love your work, they will give you that time, I assume, if they can. So anyways, just a kind of an interesting dynamic, I guess, a market dynamic and a bit of a community dynamic, a relationship between artist and audience dynamic that I just wanted to, you know, highlight here on the bleeding edge. I mean, these are very new experiments. Okay, so I just wanted. I didn't mention this the other day, but I love this work that Bzaya also put out. He posted this on Twitter. A Gucci car.
00:07:27.904 - 00:07:50.940, Speaker A: And this looks like Gucci. Not Louis Vietton, but Gucci patterning and maybe some colors here with their LCD lC. This means something. I haven't. I don't know what it means, but it means something. It looks like roman numerals here. Gucci brand.
00:07:50.940 - 00:08:23.436, Speaker A: So I think this is an awesome piece. I went to his page, and I didn't see it, uh, minted, but just an awesome piece. Uh, you know, sometimes works just hit. We were talking about quoting with the rat Cloaksie yesterday, quoting the Lucas Cranach Eve. Right. And I wanted to show you this because here is another example of quoting that we can find in the history of art. And so this is Edouard Manet's Dejeuner Solebe.
00:08:23.436 - 00:09:10.374, Speaker A: And you see this figure here? And this is thought of. I watched a lecture on the great courses a long time ago, and Ori Saltz, I think, is the professor, and he pointed out how art through the ages. So you see this guy here in this famous, famous impressionist painting by Edouard Manet, and he was pointing out that this is very similar to this roman God figure. Here or this one, the river God. There are a few. But see, this whole trope, for lack of better words, this river God motif. And then we go back and you kind of see here, this is a play on this ancient roman sculptural river God.
00:09:10.374 - 00:10:19.956, Speaker A: Right? So just to kind of show you in art historical terms, like classic, classic, classic art historical terms, this dialogue that goes on through the ages. And again, this idea of quoting, you could argue quoting gives this painting credibility in a sense. One could argue the difference. I argue, actually, the difference between folk art and what we might consider art of the tradition is art of the tradition is basically in dialogue with the tradition, where so called folk art, and I love Henri Rousseau is one of my favorite artists of all time. He is considered like, a quote unquote, I think it's probably not the right word to use anymore, but a quote unquote naive or a folk artist is what I would call that. You know, I think a lot of what we see on the Internet right now, I call it digital folk art. Okay? So the difference between what I consider quote unquote folk art and art of the tradition is art of the tradition is in conversation with the tradition.
00:10:19.956 - 00:10:46.580, Speaker A: And so here we see Manet. And I mean, this also. I mean, this is probably taken from something else, too. And who knows? Maybe all of these figures, but a quoting of the past here in le Dejeuner Soleherbe with. I mean, you really see it here in this guy with a quoting of the river God. So, continuing on kappa, new work, new kind of outrageous. Well, I don't know if I'd call this too outrageous for Kappa.
00:10:46.580 - 00:11:10.354, Speaker A: This is pretty, you know, not too crazy. Just some paint, we can assume some. Yeah. Yellow paint on the. On the women here, some spider tattoos in this kind of house series vanguard. More just craziness from Kappa here, who is always full of surprises. And an interesting kind of headband here.
00:11:10.354 - 00:11:39.186, Speaker A: And if you look, I brought it up, you can see this is kind of part of a three part series so far. Maybe there will be more of houses and the front of these kind of suburban lawns. Kind of suburban houses gone crazy is kind of what it is. Girls gone wild. Suburban houses gone wild. If you remember that infomercial from. I guess that was like, 15 or 20 years ago now they probably, again, you probably can't even put that infomercial on tv anymore.
00:11:39.186 - 00:12:09.654, Speaker A: A couple of comments about AI. So we're going to talk about AI. Paul Sims and Diego left a couple of comments that were very interesting. Paul Sims, I share your concerns about AI generated pieces. I've begun to limit myself to either very inexpensive stuff or obvious grails, like strange thing, but not much in the middle anymore. I find it hard to believe that art from a command prompt will hold value long term. So, you know, the debate continues.
00:12:09.654 - 00:12:43.514, Speaker A: Yeah, I have concerns. I still buy some of it, but I actually really share. I tend to go for the inexpensive stuff, as Paul puts it. And I bought one grail, which was that Sumi Rayuci, that studio series that she did. Let's see if. And I had bought the one of one. And I thought just for, as I put it, for museum purposes, I picked up these six and I paid 300, which is pretty insane, but for this one of one.
00:12:43.514 - 00:13:28.704, Speaker A: But now if AI kind of it will, it's going to be a thing one way or another. But I want to just have one kind of special work that kind of made the so called the museum in my mind important. You know, that, okay, you have to go to that museum if you want to see this piece, that sort of thing. So, interesting comment by Paul. Cause I basically am, yeah, like, I'm not like throwing the bank at AI art right now personally, but I'm watching with super interest right now and it's developing very fast. And again, I think the main thing is just to walk in with a very open mind. And I do have some thoughts about this AI thing.
00:13:28.704 - 00:14:04.700, Speaker A: Let's just look at Diego's comment and then let's see if I can remember to talk about just these extra thoughts. Diego. Interesting, Adrian. I think when everyone can master the technique, the aesthetic result won't be surprising anymore and will start to feel very repetitive. So to me then it will start to depure and the interesting concepts will remain. And we are starting to see certain repetitions now if we look. And where was it? So I can't believe I missed Le Salon.
00:14:04.700 - 00:14:29.360, Speaker A: I was talking about this yesterday and I figured it would be up for a couple of days. It was fifty cents and now it's an edition of three. Sold out. I really wanted to pick up that piece. It was just a nice, cheap, and really good looking AI piece. Who was it? Freekeen hell. Right? So this is what I wanted to discuss just a little bit.
00:14:29.360 - 00:15:54.638, Speaker A: This idea of what if in AI we start to leave behind this idea of authorship somewhat in a sense we could still give strange thing credit for. Okay, he was the first, but likely from the looks of it, to kind of do this contemporary clothing with Renaissance paintings. But where we removed any stigma of say, exploring that meme, it kind of had a meme flavor to it, is where I'm going with this. And what if as an AI community, AI art community, that that starts to get recognized as a meme and then people come out and start exploring that meme? Say, as I would argue, freaking hell has to a certain degree, right? And that that's not a bad thing. And that actually, maybe there's an inevitability to this is that when an AI work kind of really hits that, all of a sudden 20 artists start kind of exploring that meme. And it's not so much like, oh, you're, you know, imitating the style, which is a little taboo, say, in what we might consider just quote unquote normal art, non AI art. If all of a sudden I start just totally lifting someone's style, like directly, I might.
00:15:54.638 - 00:17:00.480, Speaker A: And I'm not saying this is happening here, by the way, there are major differences. I mean, this is a magritte, and I'm not saying that at all about freaking hell, but there is some derivation. We could argue with some confidence. But what if there was just kind of this letting go of worrying about any of that at all and that once something achieves a kind of meme status or something is just exciting to people, there's zero stigma and that, you know, and, you know, and you start your anonymous account or some account, and then you just completely take that idea and start exploring it some more and it becomes almost this weird kind of darwinian, you know, hyper market kind of scene, so to speak, where all of a sudden a meme is created, know, say, contemporary clothing in traditional oil painting, you know, context. And then just once it hits, and then all of a sudden you have like 20 or 30 artists who are just running with it. It's kind of fun to think about. And with zero stigma, you know, from the community, zero taboo, this is okay.
00:17:00.480 - 00:17:38.276, Speaker A: And in fact, we encourage that in the AI art community. So just another kind of provocative thought to think about as we, because there is an perhaps an inevitability to this. If people can create anonymous accounts and then just start to go, oh, that's a cool idea, I know how to do that too, but I want to put this spin on it. And to Paul Sims point, like, maybe it does make the command prompt interesting if, you know, if all of a sudden I can sort of tweak that command prompt. And I think there's more to it than just a command prompt. But I still need to explore this more. I think there is uploading of images you can do on Dali.
00:17:38.276 - 00:18:01.392, Speaker A: So that adds something. And potentially, you could upload your own images, which is a whole other sort of side to this. Right now. We're basically kind of seeing a lot of art history being used and remixed, which I think is really fun. Again, that waste man, gold mine of it piece, I would have loved to have picked up salon. So anyways, just some extra thoughts there. New work by waste.
00:18:01.392 - 00:18:38.854, Speaker A: I'm not trying to cover wasteman Goldman, but again, it seems like he's doing some really interesting things and developing this idea, this AI art every day here. And so interesting shoes, different color, just an interesting blocking out going on here. There is still shadow, but the floor turns into the ceiling. Reminds me very indirectly of Yves Tanguy, the surrealist horizon less landscapes. I'll show you Yves Tangi really quick, and then I'll start to kind of pick up the pace a bit here. Yves tenguy paintings. Horizonless landscapes.
00:18:38.854 - 00:18:54.410, Speaker A: Yeah. There's no horizon line in Yves Tangi. Another. What is this? From green to white. Let's just go back. Here we go. You see? No horizon line.
00:18:54.410 - 00:19:13.658, Speaker A: These great late Yves Tangui are magical pieces of art. Let's just look, see if we can find another. See, even here, no horizon line. It looks like there's. That's just a shadow. So. And you'll see that through.
00:19:13.658 - 00:19:43.196, Speaker A: If you look at Yves Tenge's work. Great. Surrealist, classic surrealist, you'll see no horizon line. We saw that a little bit in that wasteman gold minevitch where the floor turns into the ceiling. A quick thing on just Eddie Tree. I'm just enjoying kind of tracking his development again. Like, if I did a Sci-Fi pulp or some sort of science fiction magazine, I would start to think.
00:19:43.196 - 00:20:32.164, Speaker A: And actually, we'll come, here's another Eddy tree. This is kind of, like, perfect for some sort of science fiction magazine where I'm looking for illustrations, where kind of another take on this is, you could almost call them AI designers, where if I run, let's say I ran a science fiction magazine with science fiction stories, I might be tempted to hire Eddie Tree and say, eddie, if you can provide me, like, ten images, I need one of ancient Egypt meets martian landscape. I need this and this. And then Eddie Tree can provide me with stuff like this. I start going, okay, great. This is probably way cheaper and way faster, potentially way better than, you know, my illustrator that I'm, you know, hiring on the Internet. Interesting idea.
00:20:32.164 - 00:21:11.330, Speaker A: So Eddy tree here, which kind of, I also wanted to say this kind of reminded me also of this style. We were seeing it in Varya Varja, who has a lot of kind of plant work. And speaking of Arie Rousseau, there you see, we see a lot of plants almost these jungle like landscapes, especially there with the leaves. Like I was looking a second ago and surely we were talking about folk art and so called naive art. Art of the naive, which I don't think we'd use that term anymore. Maybe. I think it actually is still used, though.
00:21:11.330 - 00:21:39.742, Speaker A: I think I saw like a naive art fair. But it seems in our day and age that wouldn't be a term you would use anyways, you see here, I mean, this is clearly Henri Rousseau, who made the great jungle paintings beloved by the surrealists and Picasso. And these are spectacular paintings to see. Like, look at this. These are spectacular paintings to see in person. They're so colorful. I think this is just a snake charmer.
00:21:39.742 - 00:21:54.592, Speaker A: No snake charmer. Let's just look at that quickly and we will wrap this up. Yeah, the snake charmer. I think this is in Moma. Oh, and we have a huge version here too. Awesome. Yeah.
00:21:54.592 - 00:22:16.386, Speaker A: So, yeah, this is a spectacular work. Again, these big jungle scenes. Beautiful, beautiful. The snake charmer by army were so. So. Again, these kind of big jungle scenes, though. This looks like Henri Rousseau was actually used in the creation of this piece, an earlier Varja Varja work.
00:22:16.386 - 00:22:43.650, Speaker A: So anyways, just kind of interesting parallels there. What else? So wrapping up here. So we have a collaboration with Lewis Osborne. Animation by Lewis Osborne. The paper crane. So a UFO with looks like mushrooms going up from a bowl. Back to our counterculture friends and cancelled offers.
00:22:43.650 - 00:23:02.154, Speaker A: Yeah, so these went pretty quickly. 18 tez, new physical meets digital NFT. So these are physical by daocante draws angry fishermen. I guess they didn't catch anything. Just she's got excellent composition. Okay. Like.
00:23:02.154 - 00:23:22.894, Speaker A: And she's very good at her colored pencils. I imagine she has a gallery somewhere. Very quickly, clownvamp is doing some sort of novel thing. Choose your own adventure. So just a heads up here. Like, I don't want to focus on the novel stuff, but we touched on it yesterday. But I think we should be aware of it just as NFT people.
00:23:22.894 - 00:23:35.366, Speaker A: So you can read his whole. Right up here. You have to acquire a story. Pass nFt. So not quite sure what that's about. Here's the. So a big series.
00:23:35.366 - 00:24:08.648, Speaker A: So just interesting to follow this Nft meets the novel thing. A couple of quick things, a couple of more cubed houses. So by side hustle, aka Pixel nachos and we have another one. Okay. This one's quite nice really like the windows there. So we explore. I guess we'd call this pixel art and some eight badoo works junk or sorry JnK or Kurt Hussle collective released.
00:24:08.648 - 00:24:42.584, Speaker A: Here's a portrait of JNK. Sorry Jnk. It is JNK but happy always to profile your work and great to see you on eight badoo as well as Terry visual here. So they have some portraits that they put out. You can still get the Terry visual. The JNK is sold out so credit to him now it costs you five and myth put out a new do this put out a new eight Bidoo work. So very fun to watch all that happen.
00:24:42.584 - 00:25:01.544, Speaker A: That is a one of one. I believe it went for 30. Okay, that went for 30 released yesterday. It is called life is shit mammoth Legend. Interesting. And I have put a price on this stars I'm putting at 3.16 our PI decimal here.
00:25:01.544 - 00:25:11.284, Speaker A: And that my friends is our show. So thank you for watching once again. I hope you enjoyed it. And until next time, take care.
