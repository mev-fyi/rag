00:00:02.880 - 00:00:15.342, Speaker A: Happy Friday, everybody. It is going to be a short show. Fabulously. I have been helping my girlfriend move today. We are behind schedule, but it's going to be fun. And look at this fascinating work. New talent left and right here.
00:00:15.342 - 00:00:40.854, Speaker A: Artist journal, July 7, 2023. Broadcasting from the editor's desk on the pirate ship of the imagination in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Timing your intro to perfection, all in jest. Welcome back, everybody. And check this out. I mean, it looks like an AI artwork.
00:00:40.854 - 00:00:54.902, Speaker A: I think the name is John Thurman. You can see. See the signature in bold down there. I just love this piece. I just love this piece. And I think the reason why. And again, I believe it's AI.
00:00:54.902 - 00:01:11.456, Speaker A: There is no. It's an obscure piece. I mean, there are zero bids. There's 20 hours to go. Minimum bid is one. Tezos I'll bid. I'm sure probably, I'm maybe adding competition, perhaps, by putting this out here.
00:01:11.456 - 00:01:35.122, Speaker A: But I thought it was great. And the shopper, what a great title. I was like, I don't even know what the title on this is, but I do love it. And I'll tell you, it's a great title, the shopper. And what I love about it is a few things, is its artificiality. And it even maybe makes even more sense that AI made it. Maybe it makes it even better.
00:01:35.122 - 00:02:06.750, Speaker A: But I was thinking in terms of the content, the artificiality of the environment. This is humanity completely divorced from nature. Whether it's the light, the food, the situation. Like hunting for food with a shot, with this piece of metal here with wheels on it. It is, uh. There's something really special about this piece. As I, you know, have said from the beginning of this show, sometimes works just hit.
00:02:06.750 - 00:02:31.154, Speaker A: And this work just hits. At least it hits for me. And interesting kind of floor here, too. The color is nice. And again, it's kind of just a portrait of all of us. I mean, who doesn't do this? And I like that universality. Well, you know, this is, in a weird way, this is what we've been reduced to, you know, so.
00:02:31.154 - 00:03:10.924, Speaker A: And even just like that ceiling, you know, that dark ceiling, which is like half stage set and half just gloom. And then you see the light coming in here. Again, I think this is an AI artwork. It looks like an AI artwork. If this was painted, I would be pretty impressed, I would have to say, because then it's like this person composed this all themselves, which would be quite brilliant. And the food itself, you know, finally here, the food itself is quite persuasive and it's like one of those really big grocery stores. And I just think this is wonderful.
00:03:10.924 - 00:03:38.920, Speaker A: The, the, there's a poetry here. And so it's a beautiful work. It's a poetic work. Again, I can't help but relate to it. So a nice, you know, John Thurman, zero XTZ, zero tazos is your bid. And just beautiful. So every day for a year, I will make a one of one piece related to a lesson I learned this day.
00:03:38.920 - 00:04:03.568, Speaker A: So let me just very quickly, look here. Today I went grocery shopping. The bright light from overhead threw my shadow upon the floor like a puddle of essence that had leaked out of me. So there's the shadow there. Will consuming my purchases restore what has been lost? About the series. Every day for a year, I will make a one of one piece related to a lesson I learned that day. This will be minted on object and sold at a 24 hours auction.
00:04:03.568 - 00:04:23.080, Speaker A: With a one tezos opening bid the lowest the site allows. Unsold works will be burned. Well, I have my eye on this and maybe a couple other people if they're watching this. There's still 20 hours to go, so I'm going to put in a bid. But maybe, I think it would be thrilling if John got a whole bunch of bids. I want. I'd love to see more.
00:04:23.080 - 00:04:44.882, Speaker A: I want to see a series of this great, great subject matter. And here's John's page. John Thurman artist and so, you know, experimenting a lot. If you're making a piece a day, that's pretty cool. I'm really into this everyday sort of stuff. The gas is too darn, too damn high. And here.
00:04:44.882 - 00:05:04.952, Speaker A: When was this done? July 5. And there is the signature there and everything. So a gas station in the middle of nowhere looks like Independence Day. Kind of a really american scene. Weirdly, I'd say you could. You could, you know, have a guess at that. This is an american scene particularly.
00:05:04.952 - 00:05:30.950, Speaker A: It's Independence day with fireworks. Interesting kind of conflation of fire. It's like a Magritte esque conflation of fireworks in a bright sky. Wouldn't that be interesting? Have you ever seen a fireworks display in broad daylight? There's your question. Another mission impossible. So it is always mission impossible here. I love those movies, by the way.
00:05:30.950 - 00:05:49.302, Speaker A: I find. I don't watch many movies, but I find those mission impossible movies incredibly inspiring. I need to watch Rocky anyway. TMI. Let's look at some of the comments here. Mick renders Kappen has been on fire as always. I totally agree.
00:05:49.302 - 00:06:29.112, Speaker A: Kappen is really kind of, you know, in the shadows there is doing quite a lot of fun there. Yeah, it's so fun to see figments and otherwise. I agree. Kappin is really going somewhere in the art space, like what we're kind of seeing and discussing here. The watching piece is one of my favorite, one of my recent favorites, and totally appreciate you showing it. The right, so Mick had put that kind of pixelated, dithered CCC, CCTV camera, the quote unquote inevitable CCTV crypto art, if you will. Haha.
00:06:29.112 - 00:06:57.344, Speaker A: That is hilarious. So, yeah. And then also another important comment here. Also, the Polygon piece Polygon 1993, that was divided into several sections is a Yugi o reference to the five different pieces of exodia, each its own card in the game, combined to create the most powerful card. So, yeah, so that was definitely lost on me. And again, thank you, Bettina, for the comments. And also, Edmarola, pixel art network.
00:06:57.344 - 00:07:31.164, Speaker A: I love it. And so do I. So, yeah, this has legs. As I said in Ed Morolla's feed, their livestream, this has legs because you, you could build a network. So, Ed, if you're watching this, I would say, just keep putting stuff out, and I will keep putting stuff out and we'll see where this goes. Let's see where this goes. And, you know, other people were streaming, I think, Andre summer blues.
00:07:31.164 - 00:07:54.824, Speaker A: I mean, it's quite interesting. So the gears are going. I don't know what it all means, but a pixel art network is a glorious idea, isn't it? So I'm glad you love it too. And also, Bezaya, thanks for the shout out, amigo. The guy in the artwork is ice cube. Okay, another great episode. Thank you, Bazaya.
00:07:54.824 - 00:08:11.840, Speaker A: And also, I think this is bulls, the 91 woods. Love your hidden oil painting collection. Thank you. Best of wishes. So thank you very much. And thanks to clownvamp for asking me to show those, because, yeah, I'm always. I was actually kind of surprised at the complexity.
00:08:11.840 - 00:08:31.168, Speaker A: And, you know, it's funny returning to your work after years and just kind of like, analyzing it with fresh eyes. It's quite fun. So I'll just say thank you for the comments, everyone. So look at Ed here. And this is what I wanted to show here, too. I mean, so this is, you know, pixel art network. We have Ed Marolla live.
00:08:31.168 - 00:08:58.094, Speaker A: Maybe that's the name of that show. Or the pixel art masterclass. We can take our pick here and look at this. So, Ed, let me just show you and you can customize your shortcuts. I use it almost all of them as they come, so, and there's like nice music and everything. So a couple of things. First, this is incredibly cool.
00:08:58.094 - 00:09:42.342, Speaker A: And Ed has released a new episode. So if you're looking how to use aseprite, it gets pretty advanced pretty quickly. And I'm still like, I'll save it for some weekend watching. I've just caught some, you know, bits of this, but this is all I need to see in terms of knowing how amazing this is. And I mean, this is when I saw this. The shortcuts, you know, learn the shortcuts for Photoshop and for all your kind of desktop apps, it will completely change how you work and it'll make it much funner. It's kind of like, that's something I learned in Montreal when I was a graphic designer 15 years ago from the pros there.
00:09:42.342 - 00:10:03.524, Speaker A: The pro graphic designers is learn the short keyboard shortcuts. And Ed, I mean, I'm not surprised. Here he is in episode two. Here are your shortcuts. This is serious. This is someone who works in this program and is sharing how to do it. So pretty exciting stuff.
00:10:03.524 - 00:10:45.408, Speaker A: Has a few more subscribers here, so all pretty exciting. This is my new favorite channel, and he has times time stamps. Again, Ed, if you're watching this, if you put this in the description, then it will divide up the timeline here because I noticed it didn't work. You have to put it in the description, not just the comments. And for anybody else that's interested, I saw walk post this twitch thing, and I'm thinking like maybe walk is thinking of doing streaming. And again, you can use behance, you can use twitch. So just kind of interesting, you know, it's kind of back to, I think I mentioned this last time, it's that Terrence McKenna idea, create your own roadshow.
00:10:45.408 - 00:11:17.050, Speaker A: And this is turning into a roadshow, you know, so just all very interesting. And if anybody else is streaming out there, don't hesitate to message me and just send me a link. I think this is a hilarious kind of development that has come our way here. Polygon 1993. Physicalizing these incredible digital art pieces. X three holographic prints are available now shipping worldwide. So let's just actually take a quick look.
00:11:17.050 - 00:11:44.250, Speaker A: I didn't realize they're so interesting. Now, this looks digital, but maybe this is a, is this a portrait of, how can that be? This looks like a digital file. So a little confusing maybe, at least for me. I mean, maybe you guys have it figured out. So I assume it's kind of like the lenticular print. I'm not sure what the difference is, but it's pretty interesting. €60.
00:11:44.250 - 00:12:01.214, Speaker A: So. And then you have different designs. So that is pretty interesting. So, you know, and this is another way of monetizing your views because, of course, look, 135,000. It's interesting. I'd be curious to know how many you're selling. You know, so, smart move.
00:12:01.214 - 00:12:20.578, Speaker A: By Polygon 1993. You know, it's like Warhol. Good art is business. Art, like doing good business with your art, is a. Is an art in itself, and it's. Yeah, and it's glorious. So, continuing on, someone was asking if what's better, Tezos or Ethereum fermenting.
00:12:20.578 - 00:12:52.382, Speaker A: I basically said all of the above measureless was asking if I had any insights. I don't really have more than what I've already said, which is do both. Ethereum, you'll make more money, but you're not going to have as many sales. Tezos is more of a reliable money. If you're making nice work or if you're, you know, putting work that you're happy with that other people like, it's kind of a more easier sell because it's not as high. And then you do the additions, which can turn into just as much as the ETH work. Right.
00:12:52.382 - 00:13:15.138, Speaker A: Especially things have gotten pretty slow on ETH, as unknown collector was pointing out yesterday. So, you know, Axin just put out a work on tazos. So, you know, there be. There may be method to that madness as far as what Xcene's doing. It's like, oh, now is a good time. So it's all of the above. And then also Santiago, it's a codal.
00:13:15.138 - 00:13:44.796, Speaker A: Who watches this show? Consider BTC, too. It has a new wave of on chain tokens. And I have been looking at that, and we've actually, I mean, you know, ordinals. We were looking at putting the peloponnesian war. But those files, they're four megabytes. And I just found out from the people I was talking to who kind of, you know, the team, one of the teams that kind of does these kind of ordinal type minting things. They said it'd be like three or $4,000 per work, so.
00:13:44.796 - 00:13:58.590, Speaker A: To mint. To mint it. So I'm not sure if the peloponnesian war will work on BTC. It's a beautiful idea, but maybe you do. So. But maybe like a pixel art type thing. And maybe that's why there's so much pixel art.
00:13:58.590 - 00:14:28.884, Speaker A: So if you go here, if you can do a search, you'll find actually some great alpha from Santiago is a codal as to how to get started on ordinals, which is pretty exciting. I'll probably do that pretty soon. There's also something here I wanted to highlight at the end. So, Santiago, my take is that beside the current state of the market, if you're interested in the history of crypto art and NFTs and NFTs, you should definitely learn about counterparty rare pepes, etcetera. And. Yeah, I don't. It's an interesting.
00:14:28.884 - 00:15:00.494, Speaker A: I thought this was really interesting because I don't really have a particular. It's a whole rabbit hole, the whole rare Pepe's thing in counterparty. And it kind of brought up this kind of interesting thought in my mind because I think a lot of people, or some people think I have pretty big gaps when it comes to crypto art. And I. I don't disagree. Like, I kind of come for what interests me, and for me, that's the art. And so I think rare pepes are really cool.
00:15:00.494 - 00:15:25.764, Speaker A: They're kind of like trading cards for me, though. Like, I don't know if. And I think it's a debatable point. And I totally. If anybody feels otherwise, I'm not asking anybody to think like me, let's put it this way. But I'm not sure that the rare Pepes generally, you know, like the Satoshi Nakamoto or the Pepe Mono Mona Lisa. Pepe Mona Lisa and all this.
00:15:25.764 - 00:15:45.852, Speaker A: I'm not sure that they will be in museums for the art itself in 300 years. They might be for. From a collective. I think it's more of a collectible kind of thing. And again, feel free to disagree. It's very subjective. So this is why I'm not.
00:15:45.852 - 00:16:15.794, Speaker A: Because I think some people kind of wonder, why aren't you more into this other stuff? Because I'm not really, you know, a crypto art person. Ironically, with this kind of blockchain NFT channel, I'm more of an art person that uses crypto. And I love crypto. I truly love it. It's like a financial video game, a noetic financial system. A psychedelic financial system, I think is incredibly fun. It's very fun crypto.
00:16:15.794 - 00:16:54.138, Speaker A: But yeah, if people are kind, I think sometimes people kind of wonder, like, does this guy know what he's talking about? He doesn't ever mention this stuff. It's because I find it interesting. And I'll probably go down that rabbit hole one day. But it's not necessarily what grabs me. And this is a journal where I just talk about what grabs me, and I'm totally cool. And I think, and I brought this up, too, because this also came up, and I was like, this kind of relates so blackstar, can punks tell me about one technical innovation they did first? And this kind of illustrates the point. I was like, this kind of totally illustrates the point for me.
00:16:54.138 - 00:17:32.006, Speaker A: Now, there are some, and people list some innovations that they did. Maybe the first profile picture project on ethereum with this kind of generative art. But I think the reason why cryptopunks are famous is actually because of the art. Like, I think the reason why they sell for a million dollars, sometimes more, is because the art is excellent. It's brilliant pixel art. And I think so. I think that's really important is the actual art itself is what really drives it, because there's all sorts of stuff that's historical.
00:17:32.006 - 00:18:12.272, Speaker A: And you could make the argument that a lot of the rare pepes like these are historical from a blockchain perspective. But I think it's more within the culture of crypto. Whereas, interestingly, and remember Dmitry Cherniak, if you remember that show, he was kind of upset or not excited that his work was being shown alongside of cryptopunks, or being sold alongside of cryptopunks. I think at the Sotheby's auction, if I'm not mistaken, maybe it's Christie's, I'm not sure, but I think these are actually totally legitimate, like beautiful, brilliant art. I mean, you see it in the hair here. It's brilliant, brilliant pixel art. Look at how cool this is.
00:18:12.272 - 00:19:19.654, Speaker A: This is expertly done, this whole series. And even just the colors, this beautiful kind of purple sunglasses. So it's an interesting question. And just finally, on this, not to digress too far in this episode, but I think Vincent Van Doe recently had this post that said, if you're making art purely for based on the aesthetics, then you probably need to work on your art. And, yeah, it was a kind of a maybe who was just kind of, I don't want to say click baiting, but just kind of, you know, creating controversy. And probably what he meant was, if you're purely concerned with just making something pretty, but you're not concerned with the concept, then you probably need to work on the art a bit. Although aesthetics itself, I would say, you know, when you call something aesthetic, if you're working just on the aesthetics, well, an idea can be beautiful, right? And you can make something that's purposefully, ugly, but that's still beautiful because I guess at the end of the day, we are in the business of beauty.
00:19:19.654 - 00:19:45.800, Speaker A: I would argue otherwise, what is this magical thing that we experience? What draws us back here? What inspires us? I would argue at the end of the day, even if it's a quote unquote ugly work, but if it's done in the right way, take Duchamp's fountain. I think that was actually listed as an example. Well, it's a beautiful idea. It's a brilliant, it's subversive, it's fun. It's beautiful. Right. The idea.
00:19:45.800 - 00:20:19.358, Speaker A: So even though it's using kind of quote unquote ugly aesthetics, a urinal. So all to say, I think the history matters here, but I think the real, at the end of the day, it's actually, it's because they're beautifully done is why these are worth a lot of money. So just a little. So, yeah, so I start again with the art, and then the fact that it's on crypto is great, but it's not. That's why I show work from Instagram that's not on crypto. I show physical work here, too. So continuing.
00:20:19.358 - 00:20:52.554, Speaker A: So, and very quickly, I don't want to go too far into this, but we did mention it six months ago or so. Punk 6529, how was kind of a seed investor, if I'm not mistaken, for blur. And Blur has taken a lot of flack for perhaps really hurting the NFT scene. So he finally responded. And if I had to sum it up, it was basically like, we invest in a lot of NFTs projects, and this was just one of many. We have a team. Some people thought it was a good idea more than others.
00:20:52.554 - 00:21:28.082, Speaker A: So a little bit of distancing himself because I think that probably there is increasing criticism now that you see bored apes down from 100 ETH, you know, maybe $250,000 down to 30 ETH, you know, $60,000. That is happening in the last year. That has happened in the last year. It's quite something to see. So the NFT scene is really getting hit hard. And so I assume that's why he put out this very lengthy thread here. So if you're curious to just hear it here, it is, because we commented on it before.
00:21:28.082 - 00:22:05.298, Speaker A: So I think it's important that we say, well, here's his response, and give everybody a chance to respond. Dan Control, this is great. So remember, we brought up the. I think the name of the book is hallucinogenic mushrooms by Richard Evans Schultes. The ethnobotanist out of Harvard. Famous, famous academic, really, in the whole kind of the rediscovery of hallucinogens in western culture. A very, very pivotal figure along with R.
00:22:05.298 - 00:22:35.098, Speaker A: Gordon. And they were starting to try and connect significantly the eleusinian mysteries in Greece, those hidden secret mystery rituals with hallucinogens. And they wrote a whole book on that. Was it called I'll look that up? I can't even remember. It's been years since I looked at that. But all to say, this is hilarious. So, Dan Control, thank you so much, Pokebelly, for mentioning our work.
00:22:35.098 - 00:22:59.984, Speaker A: And yes, the golden guide was very helpful to us. I thought that was just kind of accidental. But apparently that Golden Guide, they actually used it, especially during the project development phase. A big credit, of course, to Ricardo Malleo for the musical animations working together conceptually and creatively. And also, thank you, Pokebelly. We're so excited about this. The golden guide was a big inspiration for us, and it's amazing you notice that connection.
00:22:59.984 - 00:23:14.964, Speaker A: Danillo's work is vibrant, iconic and delicate. And it was such a wonderful creative collaboration. I agree. It's a real. The power of collaboration in this series here is unmistakable. It's really impressive. Looking forward to seeing more.
00:23:14.964 - 00:23:43.330, Speaker A: And also, indio robot Rahim is a dope artist and designer from Iran. And he has the Sikh collab collection where Daniel W. Is latest collaborator. Make sure to check out the pastel verse clowns two their feel good art. And so this is where these clowns are coming from, because I remember looking at this one. And so this Pagliacci, the great Pagliacci. So that is why you're seeing the clowns.
00:23:43.330 - 00:24:03.216, Speaker A: It is related to Rahim, an iranian artist. So thank you, indiorobot, for the context. And also, finally, retro Mani with a sketch. So we remember this completely awesome pixel artwork. And here is the background sketches. So I love it. I love it.
00:24:03.216 - 00:24:22.736, Speaker A: Keep this stuff, Manny, is what I would say. Keep this stuff. And I'm sure you will, but put it somewhere safe. The original sketches for retro man level one versus the final look. My pencil drawings be scrappy. Continuing on, finally, good morning, Internet friends. Strange thing.
00:24:22.736 - 00:24:41.864, Speaker A: In the midst of chaos, let your desk become an oasis of focus. Absolutely. And strange thing is one of the hardest workers and hustlers in this entire space. And continuing on. So here finally is some art. Max capacity. A really cool open edition.
00:24:41.864 - 00:25:06.784, Speaker A: N 0786. So just an exploding car here. Five tazos. Pretty nice work. I mean, just kind of. It's easy on the eyes, isn't it just kind of a beautiful, dramatic work here? So open edition, five tezos, only eight minted, so that is pretty good. Nice low edition so far.
00:25:06.784 - 00:25:20.704, Speaker A: And continuing on. Yeah, we're gonna have to let these load every time, I guess. I don't know what happened to my computer. So check this out. Haiti rocket. Check this out. I think he did a big GM.
00:25:20.704 - 00:25:46.594, Speaker A: It's beautiful, isn't it? So we're kind of back to this idea of artists making software, oftentimes with chat GPT. I mean, maybe this is using. A lot of people are using this JavaScript or js five thing. I'm not sure how this was made. And then you just hit escape and there's probably a way even to export or not, I guess you. There's no way to export. That's what I would.
00:25:46.594 - 00:26:08.674, Speaker A: That's my request. How about an export? That would be amazing. So look at how cool it is though. So that is by Haiti rocket, an edition of 13. And let's just see what happened here. Sold for 137 tezos, each 247. So making a cool thousand tezos.
00:26:08.674 - 00:26:23.124, Speaker A: Nice work. Rad cube brush from Haiti rockette. Have a nice day. Wow. Nice. That's impressive. Don't pull the carpet cartridge mic renders so nice and cheap, by the way.
00:26:23.124 - 00:27:01.612, Speaker A: Edition of 30. And you see what I see, I see Nintendo glitch rom processed here with. It looks like it's processed through like analog video glitch, you know, processing, video processing. So again, we saw a little bit of this with LB previously, but this looks great again, like combination. Don't pull the cartridge collected from physical hardware glitches on an NES clone console exported in after effects gif in Photoshop. So it's a gif too. So you can get that for one tezos.
00:27:01.612 - 00:27:21.928, Speaker A: And it's only an addition of 30. And there's 20 left. Wow. And here's a little write up on it. New collection 1000 on Twitter special I've been sitting on this footage and making a selection of gifs from physical hardware glitches. Cartridge pulling on a circuit bent clone console from your favorite NES games. Music by the amazing.
00:27:21.928 - 00:27:46.354, Speaker A: Let's see if we hear. So almost a nice little preview here. So look how beautiful this looks. So Mick renders continues to dazzle here. So it's great to see, isn't it? I think it was Mick renders who's doing the whole I'm experimenting with pixel art thing, so trying new things. It's brilliant. It's brilliant.
00:27:46.354 - 00:28:12.684, Speaker A: Silva sand twos with another cool glitch nes rom run away. And here is what looks like a little girl running away through a field with these beautiful glitches along the way here. And just very cool. Three tezos 50 edition of 22. And that's on secondary. So sold out at two tezos. And let's see how quickly selling out.
00:28:12.684 - 00:28:30.704, Speaker A: Really quickly. So that's interesting. Silva sand twos is growing. The market is growing. And look at this gorgeous work here by element. Li so bold in its kind of unfinished, you know, quote unquote unfinishedness. And it's.
00:28:30.704 - 00:29:00.244, Speaker A: I find this element very consistently bold in playing with aesthetics and composition and, you know, on the line of it almost not coming together, but it comes together like it's brilliant. And this beautiful lamp here, just a really, really, really interesting artist here. And it's just. I just find it incredibly interesting. Desk mean. It's. Yeah, it makes me want to pick one up.
00:29:00.244 - 00:29:15.660, Speaker A: 18 left. It was just minted. I. So I missed this Tom Bombadil ray of hope. So is now minting on foundation smartly and selling, too. I think this one was just minted. But then there's the skeleton figure.
00:29:15.660 - 00:29:44.188, Speaker A: So it's kind of back to this, you know, all of the above strategy here. You know, different chains have different collectors. So, you know, if I had more time. Yeah, let's mint on tezos. Ethereum, do a manifold do on Solana. You know, I'd go nuts, you know, and so just very cool. And it's also, if you have a ton of work, if you're very prolific, it's also a way of kind of spreading the work out a little bit.
00:29:44.188 - 00:30:09.922, Speaker A: So just a very cool series. I love what he, Tom bin Battle's doing here with the light. We've seen it also with the train and maybe the UFO, this kind of theme. And here you see it with the sunlight. Beautiful scene here. And here's another one playing off of Van Gogh. And maybe it's an older piece, but I thought it was so beautiful, and I'd never seen it before, so I thought I'd show it here.
00:30:09.922 - 00:30:35.654, Speaker A: So, again, playing off of Van Gogh's bedroom. And there's the skull robot guy and a robot serving him and all that Sci-Fi stuff. Really beautifully done. I think my favorite part is this pink here, as well as how it transitions to blue. Really just beautifully done here. There's something about it. Speaking of interesting and beautiful and experimental human kernel, you can get these for 80 tazos cents.
00:30:35.654 - 00:31:12.106, Speaker A: This whole series here, this is Dini de Kujeb Sharow who's also an artist on tezos here. So just a cool kind of portrait here from human kernel, who does all these experimental pfps and just all the nice little noise around here and everything. And then also. And human kernel, we see the works that look very, very similar to Santiago's work. So maybe this is a Santiago alter ego, Arlandai. So what I love about this is I just bought all three, actually, because I'm a big fan of series 80. Tazo sent.
00:31:12.106 - 00:31:27.262, Speaker A: I got it for two tezos. Forty cents. I got this one. You only get it for seven more hours, though, if you're watching this same day here. And here's another one. So just get all three. And because as you see here, there they are.
00:31:27.262 - 00:31:46.718, Speaker A: So they just go kind of beautifully together. It's a nice little series here and everything. So very cool. Another gradient from not a number here. And this one, another one of one. And this also looks like it sold again, kind of reminding of query archangels, but a dithered version. It's beautiful.
00:31:46.718 - 00:32:11.694, Speaker A: It's brilliant. And the colors are great. Pamela Cerrone from Argentina, cut cat. And here, again, playing with this kind of really chunky pixels here, but then also contrasting that with this kind of textured paper in between. And cool little kind of Gif machines here. Whatever you want to call them. Just cool gifs.
00:32:11.694 - 00:32:24.656, Speaker A: Cool Gif animation. These characters here. And this is an edition of five. And it sold out at 777. So that is cool. Doctor Lee, nft there. And check this out.
00:32:24.656 - 00:32:40.372, Speaker A: There is a magazine, KHC World magazine, number one. So we saw the merch yesterday with the t shirt. So here is the magazine. What it is and what it isn't. A bad idea. KHC is an umbrella corporation. So we have a network.
00:32:40.372 - 00:32:59.116, Speaker A: We have a corporation. And here they need their own show on this network, don't they? The curt hustle. Or they'll do the commercials. They'll do the commercials where the commercials are as good, if not better, than the shows. Redeem tickets. Okay. At least this show, cyber slums and everything.
00:32:59.116 - 00:33:39.460, Speaker A: So how cool is that? So there is your brochure, your magazine from the Kurt Hussle collective and everything. And this beautiful, beautiful work at the end here, the 1997 gorgeously done buy for three tezos edition of 50. There are 37 left. And also from the Kurt Hussle collective, another play on Jimi Hendrix, the Kurt Hussle experience. Are you experienced with an x? And there it is, an edition of 25 for seven tezos. Only seven left. And morlacos back on scene here with another cool piece, number 27, El duelo Criollo.
00:33:39.460 - 00:33:56.256, Speaker A: And this is for five tezos, just minted today. Really nice piece, as usual. Really mysterious. I mean, these guys look like they're in the water, but it's green water and everything. And this guy looks on. Just a really, really, really cool piece from Murlaco. It's really nice color, too.
00:33:56.256 - 00:34:20.272, Speaker A: Fascinating composition. I'm a huge fan of Murlako's work. I wish he'd put out a little more I wish he'd put out a little more work. Rustic digital art edition of one for 50 tezos. Haven't seen rustic for a while here. And this one's pretty experimental. Almost looking like cut out interest, almost cut out paper here almost, but not quite in the way that these shapes are.
00:34:20.272 - 00:34:43.220, Speaker A: And huge shadows here. And just another kind of hard to. Another hard to understand work from rustic digital art. It's hard to just see what's going on. It feels like a room. There is some light, but again, kind of like purposefully irrational works from rustic digital art. A one of one for 50 tezos.
00:34:43.220 - 00:35:04.606, Speaker A: Inside, outside part of the cloud period. Maybe those are clouds. These could be clouds. This whole series. So pretty wild series there sponsor with a couple of pieces, lost in the city, edition of ten for five tezos. And here you see the graffiti and everything. And just a figure walking through the city.
00:35:04.606 - 00:35:20.486, Speaker A: Interesting little thing with the sidewalk almost like that. Do not. Police, do not cross tape on the sidewalk. Interesting move. And here you see almost like Internet iconography. The check, check x and looking like a bus stop here. Interesting piece.
00:35:20.486 - 00:35:36.470, Speaker A: And then you see like the chunky, you know, window here. Almost feels like almost the future, but not sure. Interesting. Here's another interesting piece, detective. And almost reminds you of Ezra Eslin. Here. There is a murder.
00:35:36.470 - 00:36:03.500, Speaker A: And so this is the detective here. Almost like a Renaissance portrait, always at kind of an interesting angle. Sponsors compositions like, you know what I think is maybe the most exciting part of this composition is actually in the top right? How he gets this crazy perspective. And looking down, it's almost like the. The mystery and the. Almost the madness of the scene is kind of reflected in the illustration itself. Put it this way.
00:36:03.500 - 00:36:28.374, Speaker A: Another way of saying what I'm trying to say. The. The illustration magnifies the intensity of this crime, of what's being depicted. So more brilliant work from Smaunter. I'm glad that spontr is revving up the engines a little bit and really starting to release a lot of stuff. Diego Barrow, a digital drawing on procreate and iPad. So digital drawing with a pen.
00:36:28.374 - 00:37:07.834, Speaker A: And again, kind of reminiscent of that art show that Diego's having, I think, in Argentina, if I'm not mistaken. And here is a dog and, and a scene in the background almost looks like two different works, but not quite. It's probably, it's interesting. It almost feels like two different works put together, which would actually be really cool either way, I thought a really interesting composition and I loved how finished it is on top and how kind of unfinished it is at the bottom or loose, as my friend says. Edition of five for two tezos. Three are left. And continuing on, Sky Goodman with Mika Oladaf.
00:37:07.834 - 00:37:33.994, Speaker A: A new name here that I'm learning about. Crystal chunk pump AI heal by Sky Goodman. Glitched by Mika Al Hadef so an interesting, so here's, can you see the heel here? Is the heel here. And so glitched out. So again, combination exporting all sorts of experimentation here. I'm, you know, I'm loving it. To quote McDonald's there.
00:37:33.994 - 00:37:50.378, Speaker A: Crystal chunk pump edition of one. Let's just see what that's sold for. Let's see what that sold for. 50 tezos to explainer gallery right on. Explainer gallery on the scene. I love it. So this is Mika Oladaf, who I hadn't seen before.
00:37:50.378 - 00:38:18.878, Speaker A: And so I guess does some glitch work as well? Kind of harmonizes quite well with Sky Goodman, doesn't it? So kind of a natural collaboration there. And I brought this up here, this heal sync malfunction module. Today is the day. Lost sneakers presents a Skytimes Mikael Oladef. No description here. Oh, there it is. Actually a glitch 3d artist and an animated GLB for twelve tezos, but really so much more.
00:38:18.878 - 00:38:45.354, Speaker A: And here's a nice little kind of preview here. And I also brought up the. So that's pretty cool. So you see the sky Goodman within this little, really kind of reminiscent of the hasdrubal waffle drawing tool. Remember that crazy drawing tool that looked like it was ordered off eBay? Kind of looks like one of those. And I also brought that up here. Well, maybe it didn't load.
00:38:45.354 - 00:39:18.706, Speaker A: Having issues with loading the page here. We might have to move on, but we saw a pretty good view of it. And it looks like it's sold out. It is sold out at twelve tezos. There's explainer again, you know, again, like, it's quite interesting, the, here it is, the liquidity on Tazos. I mean, there are a lot of sales on tazos. I mean, if you just, you know, didn't see Twitter and didn't see what was happening on Ethereum or anywhere else, you'd see a lower Tazos price.
00:39:18.706 - 00:39:40.370, Speaker A: But I still see sales. Like, what my point is, I'm not sure. I know that there's a bear market going on. There's everybody selling their work, you know, not everybody, but you know what I'm saying, so. And selling out. So again, like, a lot to be grateful for. Twelve tezos edition of 20, like, you know, that's 240 tezos, 120 tezos each.
00:39:40.370 - 00:39:56.994, Speaker A: I'm sort of like, if you get like 100 tezos or close to 80 or $100 us for your work. It's a good day. It's a good day. So very cool here. And you see, I really like the back, too. And I thought just really nicely done. Almost.
00:39:56.994 - 00:40:17.830, Speaker A: Again, this story in a story type composition. Screen. In a screen. Interestingly, really beautifully done there. And here is Mikael. Mikael Knowlsson. The reason you're watching this show right now is because Mikael Knowlsson at the very beginning was encouraging the Spotify one Spotify two Spotify episodes.
00:40:17.830 - 00:40:31.318, Speaker A: I did do it on YouTube. So here it is. Who is abstract artist. Kind of like abstract expressionism, kind of digital abstract expressionism. And I believe mints on Solana. So here. Yeah.
00:40:31.318 - 00:40:52.416, Speaker A: So give Mikael Knowlsson a follow. And just a really cool work they posted. I think it's an older work, but you can see the sampled brush strokes that are dragged and everything. Just cool. I think Sabato was mentioning there's a lot of abstract expressionism on Solana and it's kind of true. It's got that feel to it. And collectors over there see if this loads.
00:40:52.416 - 00:41:16.430, Speaker A: And this is Ivano Ivanovd. Ivanovd. And there's this really cool cowboy series. It was Mikey Wilson that retweeted this, that brought this to my attention. It crossed my desk here. And here it is kind of almost reminiscent. This would hang well with Mikey Wilson's blues players, wouldn't it? You have these cowboys here.
00:41:16.430 - 00:41:32.286, Speaker A: So this was an entire series. I think it's AI. It must be AI, but it doesn't say actually. So I'm not entirely sure. Oh, minted by Mikey Wilson. This is Mikey Wilson. Maybe this is so Mikey Wilson bought this.
00:41:32.286 - 00:41:49.914, Speaker A: There we go. Mikey Wilson bought this. But he's not the artist. The artist is Ivano Muft, as we were saying before. And here you see all 40 of these cowboys here. So selling. Looks like, again, I'm kind of back to this, like, is this really a bear market? 0.035
00:41:49.914 - 00:42:02.774, Speaker A: ETH. I mean, what is that? 0.01 is maybe 20. Like, maybe this is 35. I'm not sure how much this is. 0.01 would be $20.
00:42:02.774 - 00:42:48.290, Speaker A: So this would be like $75 selling out. An addition of 40 or 38 of 40 have been minted. So basically sold out. I mean, for a bear market, what's going to happen? This is kind of like my grand Friday question for us into the weekend. If we're selling, like, if we're selling this much on in a pretty brutal bear market, what's happening? If it comes back, what happens in a bull market? I mean, that'll be wild. That will be very, very wild. And continuing on here, Venta, another work, another just fascinating AI artist here.
00:42:48.290 - 00:43:15.306, Speaker A: Putting out pretty regular work here. Pretty prolific selling out at eight tezos each. Just interesting colors here, too. And so I heard there's going to be a new mid journey, six coming out, so don't miss the train with mid journey. I'm starting to use it more and more. You know how you can tell you're really using it when it becomes your first tool that you bring out when you start working. And you can do it all on your phone, on discord.
00:43:15.306 - 00:43:41.878, Speaker A: That's a lot of fun. So very cool here. The red room by Venta, continuing that kind of similar vibe and series that we saw before as we wait for each page to load here. And strange thing with a really cool mouse. A very cool mouse. So more juxtapositions here. What is this? Is this a mouse? It probably is a computer mice collection.
00:43:41.878 - 00:44:02.404, Speaker A: Look at that. You know, really nice. You know, you could see this design here. It actually just like, you know, outrageously luxury mouses here. You could actually see these working here. So very cool work from strange thing as ever. Breaking new ground, like, literally daily.
00:44:02.404 - 00:44:27.996, Speaker A: And continuing on, Quila Nina with some physical art here. Acrylic and oil painting. The fire inspired by the tarot card, the tower. So very cool work here, as usual. Again, reminiscent of that great artist whose name I always forget. The guy where, like, almost like the upside down guy. What is his name? I always forget his name.
00:44:27.996 - 00:44:53.552, Speaker A: It's hilarious. Anyway, something to point out here that is quite, you know, unusual and cool is this yellow sky. It's not often you see a yellow sky. And even just like, the irrationality of this figure in this burning building, I guess this is the tower with the lightning hitting. And this, again, yellow sky. This bird here. Maybe this is a self portrait, perhaps of Quila Nina.
00:44:53.552 - 00:45:16.628, Speaker A: Oh, these kind of mystical works here. There's a really interesting snake. Beautiful work, el incendio. And finally here, yo? Ao Salazar with some beautiful painting. We know yo? Ao from the plasticine canvas works. Turns out Yoao can paint quite beautifully, too. And you'd almost.
00:45:16.628 - 00:45:44.476, Speaker A: What's kind of cool about it is how you totally recognize the artist, even though it's done with a different medium. More just really, really nice work, GM from Yoao. And of course, we know wok here. And I thought this was just, again, virtuoso in the eyes. It almost looks photographic. It almost looks photographic. What's achieved here with basically two colors of spray paint, maybe three really, really beautiful.
00:45:44.476 - 00:45:56.212, Speaker A: Probably two. Go quickly. Travel safely, my young friend, to the land of ghosts. And that, my friends, is your show. Thank you for joining me. I hope you have a wonderful weekend. Thank you for your time.
00:45:56.212 - 00:46:03.704, Speaker A: Until next time, take care. This is the pixel art. This is the pixel art network signing off.
