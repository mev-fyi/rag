00:00:04.200 - 00:00:39.502, Speaker A: We continue to sail forward, my friends, on our ship here, broadcasting from the pirate, from the pirate radio station on the ship in my mind, in inner space. Welcome back. Artist journal, May 15, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelly and it's so great to have popple at the start of the show here. When you see the numbers, I mean, the numbers are off the charts. I wonder if maybe this is a regular occurrence for popple.
00:00:39.502 - 00:01:01.374, Speaker A: I have no idea. But when I saw the, when I saw the tweet, I mean, let me just show it to you. Let me see here. Minimize. Okay, look at this. 189,000 views. 190,000 views on this work here.
00:01:01.374 - 00:01:37.790, Speaker A: So that is, I mean, we're getting in the neighborhood of a million here. Like this is a fifth of a million views. Reminiscent. It recalls Rob V Two's statement prediction that NFT artists were going to be the rock stars of the future. This seems to be adding evidence to that thesis that is really impressive. So anyways, and as ever, and look at Popple's account though is there, and just really no wonder it's doing so well. I mean, like, look at how cool it is put together.
00:01:37.790 - 00:02:02.924, Speaker A: And even when I highlight it, his name even does something when you highlight. So popple, writer, artist, computer culture scape and art. Collect my unfine art only if you like it. So anyways, on object. And this is another thing, was on manifold, which was an interesting thing. So again, 28,000 followers. So that is impressive.
00:02:02.924 - 00:02:41.432, Speaker A: So let me just. So this was on manifold, so this went for 69 ETH. I mean, I wonder, which is a really nice price, by the way. So I mean, what is that, 1200 us dollars? So that is impressive. I did think to myself, what if this was on foundation, you know, just by being on the platform. Does it help you in terms of if all of a sudden someone bids like on super rare, you'll see it, oh, someone just bid, it'll be in your newsfeed if someone bids on something. And I wonder to myself if this would have had more bids on foundation.
00:02:41.432 - 00:03:18.446, Speaker A: Just an interesting question. I wonder to myself, I think it's super cool, kind of indie, you know, and which kind of fits with popple's whole, you know, for lack of better term brand image or just like philosophy. It's consistent with the art which kind of has this edginess to it. I don't know if I'd call it like punk rock, but it's tempting, you know, this Sci-Fi pixel art, this alien Sci-Fi pixel art. So anyways, Edenfall one, the death of the old web. And let me just show you. So, really interesting title, I'm not sure.
00:03:18.446 - 00:03:46.774, Speaker A: And let me actually hit play here. There's not a ton of animation in here, but it's all you need. Again, reminiscent of Kappen, who does just, you know, just a little part of this. This image will be animated. And also reminiscent of Dextere, some of Dextere's work, where you'll have this static landscape, and then just a little bit that's moving. Again, this creates a contrast, right? If the whole thing was moving, you wouldn't have that same contrast. But you get, it's almost like the still pixels come to life.
00:03:46.774 - 00:04:27.522, Speaker A: The static pixels come to life a little bit and are given kind of a deeper significance, for lack of better words, by a little bit of movement here and there. So anyways, and then you have these kind of Android, kind of organic Android figures. Again, metal and alien seem to combine, almost reminiscent of the alien movie. And here you see, just again, that kind of Sci-Fi dark, Sci-Fi pixel art, almost dystopian. You see someone out here in the river, an ophelia of sorts. And again, just this beautiful minimal animation. And finally, there's something else I want.
00:04:27.522 - 00:04:58.060, Speaker A: So you see, it's kind of vertical. And I was confused at first because I saw 600 by 800 pixels, which is the size of an old computer monitor. But it's a computer monitor basically on its size, I think a really cool, from a conceptual perspective, a pretty cool size. 600 to 800 pixels, the old computer monitor size. So anyways, 0.69 ETH big congrats. I mean, I almost want to say this is a bigger deal, this 190,000 views.
00:04:58.060 - 00:05:30.404, Speaker A: I mean, and remember we were seeing that glitch artist Polygon 1993, who was reaching like a million views. This is quite something. Now, this and this contrast. I mean, we're going to see strange thing. Who is saying, you know, Instagram's where it's at as far as if you're an emerging artist? So an interesting kind of sub debate that kind of came out of nowhere here. Anyways, we'll get to strange thing in a second. And while we're on popple, I just wanted to show a couple of works that came out that we missed.
00:05:30.404 - 00:06:03.368, Speaker A: This is in collaboration with explainer gallery, which is out of Shanghai. And they've been doing a few collaborations here. And there's one with Kappn here that we looked at just the other day. So they've been doing they just started doing stuff here as far as I can tell in this trader series. So anyways, give them a follow. And so here it is, popple automated market maker. Maybe a reference vaguely to the technology by behind uniswap.
00:06:03.368 - 00:06:37.796, Speaker A: Okay. These stock crypto trading platforms online that are decentralized. So using almost reappropriating that title for Popple's own ends here. So another just cool Sci-Fi work. You're not even quite sure exactly what this is or what's going on, but it doesn't really matter, does it? And a beautiful lighting here. Stunning. I mean these are gifts, right? These are gifts still available for twelve tazos, four left, so you can still get it.
00:06:37.796 - 00:06:59.944, Speaker A: That is cool. And do we have, this is explainer again, gallery out of Shanghai. So interesting. And here's another one by popple, cyclops of dark matter. This came out on May 5, so about a week and a half ago. And so anyways, just another one of these monsters here. Kind of flashy, so I won't leave it on for too long with a poem.
00:06:59.944 - 00:07:32.314, Speaker A: 800 by 912. So very cool. And just a big shout out to ONBD magazine and the very friendly people behind it. They did a little interview chit chat with creator Adrian Pokebelly, which was super nice. And they also did a deep dive here into the realm, like a bit of a profile. So anyways, that is super cool. I'm going to put these on my description with the culture three article that I have.
00:07:32.314 - 00:08:06.598, Speaker A: It's in the description links. I'm also going to put Michella Colonna's podcast there. So anyways, thanks guys, that is awesome. And you can check it out, check out their magazine. I mean, look at how much is going on here. You know, it looks like, it just looks like a really cool kind of NFT magazine of sorts, for lack of better term. I think they're trying artist as curator, I think they're trying to bridge digital and kind of contemporary art world, which is an interesting kind of space, isn't it? So here it is.
00:08:06.598 - 00:08:35.554, Speaker A: Anyway, so anyways, thank you. And here's the chit chat. So yeah, you can check that out. And thank you to the people that picked up encrypted DM's this weekend from the secret history of World War Three. So continuing to just play, play with screenshots and kind of mucking around with the AI and just trying things out. It's really nice. I'm so glad I'm back on this project.
00:08:35.554 - 00:09:13.170, Speaker A: It's just there's so many different things. The more I work on it, the more ideas I'm getting of just how to approach it. So I just wanted to thank all the collectors here for picking one up and yeah, means a lot and it's just exciting. And just one last thing here. Look at how many views, kind of back to this reach issue. Look at how many 1200 listens people tuned into Santiago. So, I mean, I think there was like a couple of hundred live, but I mean, maybe it was on one of those pages.
00:09:13.170 - 00:09:39.564, Speaker A: If you ever bring up the. If you're ever creating a Twitter space, it shows you prominent ones. I have a feeling it made one of those pages because that is a higher number than normal. I don't have time to read all the comments here. There's some really good ones, so I'm going to try and summarize as best I can. Roon toon talking about Maxine Rykov and had some very interesting comments and basically showing appreciation. Here it is.
00:09:39.564 - 00:10:24.852, Speaker A: I actually love that he doesn't mint terribly often. There's a pressure to mint as often as possible. And I like that there are artists who are willing to work at their own pace for more dedicated artworks that aren't so simple. Yeah, it really is individual decision, and for me, it's something to aspire to, to be prolific. There's kind of a weird kind of bias I have where quantity matters, but I mean, there are just massive exceptions to this rule. Well, I was going to say Leonardo, I mean, who made like 20 paintings, but then you look at the notebooks and, I mean, I think we can call that prolific. But all to say, yeah, I think every artist has to kind of find their own equilibrium and be true to themselves.
00:10:24.852 - 00:10:55.048, Speaker A: So. Yeah, and I. Yeah, so I like that too, because I'd rather have a masterpiece by Maxine Rykov once, once a month or once every few months, then, you know, a non masterpiece, you know, so it depends on the work and it depends what you're trying to do. But I think it's an interesting and worthwhile comment. Micrenders also. So these were the spheres that turned into the plants. The plants in the series are 3D Scanned.
00:10:55.048 - 00:11:41.248, Speaker A: I think Sabato did some 3d scanning too, and then brought into blender for all the spherical and animation treatment, which was inspired by my fiancee's houseplant collection and mutual love of them. Great to be shown next to sky, one of my big inspirations and motivators in the space. So a testament to how small this still is. Good news. Rosatio also had some comments on collage and relating to what demon ego was saying about not planning everything ahead of time. And this is what I wanted to highlight here. When I'm ready to create something, I just pick out the ones that catch my eye talking about images, public domain images that Rosaceo uses for collage.
00:11:41.248 - 00:12:13.228, Speaker A: And when I'm ready to create something, I just pick one of them that catches my eyes and starts cutting and putting them together. It's kind of like letting my imagination run wild. So back to this idea of not overly planning without any real plan or idea of what the finished piece looks like. I might have a rough idea, but I'm always surprised by the end result. And it's a lot easier to bring it back to being prolific. It's a lot easier to be prolific when you're not overly planning is sort of my experience. It's like finding something unexpected and it's kind of a little more exciting.
00:12:13.228 - 00:12:54.808, Speaker A: I mean, everything has its kind of, you know, it's role and it's every strategy, every, put it this way, there are people make art for different reasons. So it really depends what you're trying to do. What is your purpose? What is your end, what is your goal? It's like finding something unexpected and really cool by chance. Kind of like surrealist automatism. Exactly. So yeah, so leaving, you know, the opportunity for chance and inspiration. So anyways, it's interesting how these two comments here, like we're discussing a similar topic from different kind of angles.
00:12:54.808 - 00:13:46.112, Speaker A: And finally, I did want to highlight this. If you haven't heard of touch designer, which I hadn't, definitely check it out. It's mostly used for live installation, project mapping and video dj stuff, but digital artists are harnessing its virtually unlimited power more and more every day. So an interesting tool again, score was using this, also known as ziko. It's node based, and you can take basically any inputs and modify it with any other input or parameters and create crazy outputs. So it sounds like a, it sounds like a filter of sorts, like a filtration tool, which is incredibly useful for just attacking an image from, as we see with axing taking a concept and attacking it from 20 different angles. And big shout out to bombadil and demon ego.
00:13:46.112 - 00:14:18.760, Speaker A: Thank you everybody for the comments. And this was interesting too. So Aqsin replied, yes, square brush with randomized size and spaces. So we're discussing this work here, and you see how organic these lines are, maybe we can stop it. You see how organic this is. So again, square brush with randomized size and spaces. So when you're making your own brush, you can create the space between and you can randomize the space.
00:14:18.760 - 00:14:30.128, Speaker A: So that gives a very organic feel. So right on target. I think we were right on target there. So that's interesting. Thank you for the comment and confirmation. Axin. That is totally cool.
00:14:30.128 - 00:15:00.424, Speaker A: And I had to show this India robot Axni gotchi concept, V two. So this is an ongoing joke because I thought one of Aksin's work was of a tamagotchi. And Indio is putting together some concept blueprints here for an actual tamagotchi. So with axine themed. So anyways, hilarious and cool. This was also interesting. So remember Haiti Rockette's newer works here? So here is another one.
00:15:00.424 - 00:15:22.580, Speaker A: And I was thinking, oh, maybe this is deluxe paint, right? Because it's kind of got that cycling gradient that we often see in deluxe paint. But maybe that was just a. So anyways, here's the comment. Huge thanks. Love deluxe paint and all. And all the artists. I'm using brilliant V 20, so I wonder if that.
00:15:22.580 - 00:15:40.932, Speaker A: I think that's a different software. I mean, I guess I could look it up. I love the new large case and small case letters. That Haiti rocket keeping it interesting. Retro commodore interesting. So this is another. So here you go.
00:15:40.932 - 00:16:08.654, Speaker A: So a little bit of alpha here. I was thinking to myself, this program is sometimes just like alpha for artists, you know? So anyways, how cool is this? I mean, the manual is pretty gorgeous. Look at how beautiful this manual is. Anyways, so anyways, this is brilliance 2.0 that Haiti rocket is using. I believe that's what we call it. Yes, brilliance V 20.
00:16:08.654 - 00:16:35.796, Speaker A: So anyways, more interesting work here. So just cool to see. I might have to bring that out. So this is using an amiga, though. And this is also, to me, this is a huge watch. This space, this ability now with AI for us to create our own drawing tools without basically having any knowledge of coding. I think this is what's going on here.
00:16:35.796 - 00:17:20.603, Speaker A: So this is native Ed GM with my new obsession on creating custom little tools, nineties style to draw with. You know, not sure why I put myself into, into this, but it's fun though. I think your instincts are excellent. I mean, this is quite. To me, this is a huge. Watch this space, because what happens when the artists can make their own tools, you know, it takes making your own brush and kind of hyper charges it. I mean, I've had a concept for an app that I want, which where I basically have like a circle as a drawing app and I want to be able to use the balance in the phone to draw with, to create kind of a random drawing tool.
00:17:20.603 - 00:17:44.304, Speaker A: I wonder, like, I could probably make that or at least, you know, you know what I'm saying? Like, so this is exciting. Look at the results. I mean, so we're starting. I mean, this is interesting. Look at all these different, like, you know, so. And look at this. Saving some outputs.
00:17:44.304 - 00:18:10.226, Speaker A: So this is super interesting. What's going on here more? So, yeah, pretty interesting. Yo, Salazar. Just with a working showing, a little bit of the process here behind the plasticine works here. We've seen the thinker before, but here's the sketch. So the preparatory drawing. And I kind of love that.
00:18:10.226 - 00:18:23.570, Speaker A: It's beautiful, actually. That's sellable. That's a beautiful sketch. So, anyways, I just thought that was cool. And random girl four k. R four k with new prints. So we were looking at the work.
00:18:23.570 - 00:18:41.566, Speaker A: I think it was last episode. Look at this. I'm kind of a huge fan of when stuff like this happens, too. Just these little marks down here. I guess you should probably cut it here, but who knows? I think it's fine if you leave that. Anyways. These are screen prints, I believe so.
00:18:41.566 - 00:19:19.246, Speaker A: Just interesting to see how R 4k, random girl 4k is translating digital into physical with the dots that you can use in screen printing. What do you call that? Rasterizing. So anyway, interesting results. Nice yellow up here. Just really, really interesting to see. Great contrast, really, between digital and just like, there's a natural contrast there, I would argue, you know why? Because these little rasterized things are on digital. They're perfect.
00:19:19.246 - 00:19:47.194, Speaker A: But when we screen print them, you get, like, little clumps of paint and whatever, and they're not perfect. And it creates a natural contrast, I would argue, which makes it. That's what I would argue is what's making it beautiful, philosophically. Anyways, continuing on demon ego. Look at this. So we've been seeing a lot of demon ego's kind of studio cutting board. I thought this was pretty cool, too.
00:19:47.194 - 00:20:18.644, Speaker A: So it kind of reminded me a little bit of Ed Marolla in the technique where it's, like, put down some random, random ish, random, somewhat random paint, you know, looks like watercolor, and then turn the. And then demon ego is turning them into faces again. Probably not planning out too much here, other than I'm gonna probably turn these into faces. But then, like, Ed Marolla, make a bunch of abstract stuff. Don't worry about what it's, you know, doing. Just make it unique. Don't worry about it being good.
00:20:18.644 - 00:20:39.332, Speaker A: And then if you want to turn into something, start adding eyes and, you know, features. Kind of a similar technique seems to be going on here, but using physical materials. Anyways, super interesting GM to demon ego. And check out this. Michele Kelowna has a physical gallery. Let's actually look at showtime. 10:00 a.m..
00:20:39.332 - 00:20:57.434, Speaker A: Today. And when was this? May 13. Kelowna Contemporary opens its doors to the Philadelphia mainline community of art aficionados. Give that a retweet. So here's Michele Kelowna's gallery. I think it's called Kelowna contemporary. And look, there's even like a digital frame here.
00:20:57.434 - 00:21:11.662, Speaker A: So this is looking impressive. And here is more. There it is. Kelowna Contemporary. Not messing around. So this is a pretty nice art books here. Very nice space.
00:21:11.662 - 00:21:36.152, Speaker A: And look at how good these paintings look. I think I remember this artist from has works on object. So here are the physical works. So anyways, this is looking really, really nice. So anyways, I just wanted to show that and big shout out to Michele. That is pretty amazing. And here's just another one.
00:21:36.152 - 00:22:05.182, Speaker A: So also has a Twitter account. Kelowna contemporary. Kelowna Contempo Web three digital art education onboarding is a critical component of Kelowna contemporary featured art human rights down bad by Empress trash. A significant exponent of the glitch art current. Happy to report the great reaction and interest level towards digital by legacy collectors. Yeah. So again, bridging the gap here between the contemporary art world and the digital scene.
00:22:05.182 - 00:22:29.376, Speaker A: This is, you know, we see it with ONBd. Now here's Galona. Like this is gonna happen. And I suspect there are still a lot of contemporary art collectors that would love to get in on this because it's still early days here. You know, I was telling you the story, you know, of my friend who collected. Who had his own gallery here, and he collected way back when and had Rauschenbergs. You know, he could.
00:22:29.376 - 00:22:37.352, Speaker A: He. I think he has a Warhol. Like a. Not. I don't know. I don't think like a major canvas, but a minor canvas. I don't know, or maybe a drawing.
00:22:37.352 - 00:23:09.014, Speaker A: But I know he has a Rauschenberg and all to say those, you know, that pasture has been kind of tilled. Like, it's kind of like that's. You're not. You're not early if you're buying a Rauschenberg or a Warhol, but you're early if you're buying these works that we see here that are selling for $10 each. Right. If you see something that you think is going to stand the test of time and it's selling for $5, that's kind of. Then you're early, right.
00:23:09.014 - 00:23:38.858, Speaker A: You don't really find that that often. And even if you're early in the contemporary art world, let's say you find a new artist. I mean, it's. Yeah, like, I mean, it's a much trickier sort of thing. So, anyways, I imagine there's gonna be intense collector interest in digital here and getting and just kind of helping people bridge that gap. So here, strange thing. So we were seeing the magic of Twitter with popple here, and so to tie the bow here.
00:23:38.858 - 00:23:50.814, Speaker A: Strange thing. Twitter is not for smaller artists to be seen by the mainstream. It was only a few days ago, this post was at 40,000. Now top my reel. That has 3.8 million views. So here it is.
00:23:50.814 - 00:24:33.312, Speaker A: A strange thing on Instagram. So strange thing continues to kill it on Instagram. And, you know, here's a theory for you. I could see this kind of fashion AI work doing better on Instagram, particularly because strange thing has a fashion component to it. I think it's, like, audience issue, where on Instagram, there's kind of a more natural kind of fashionista audience, whereas on Twitter, you're gonna get more of a pixel art audience. So I almost feel like it's. This is more photographic, whereas the pixel art sort of stuff that popple's doing, I'd argue maybe it's.
00:24:33.312 - 00:25:03.096, Speaker A: It probably would do better on Twitter. That is. So I wonder how much this has to do with this being kind of photographic and fashion based. Just interesting. So, you know, so it's not that it's all digital art, but it's interesting how certain genres is where I'm going with this. Certain genres of digital art might perform better on different platforms. How wild is that? And we could imagine on TikTok a similar thing.
00:25:03.096 - 00:25:28.520, Speaker A: And actually, and I've gotten some help. I'm actually starting to put out clips on TikTok. I'll have to put out my TikTok on the links there. I put out one kind of short on YouTube. If any of you saw that, I think it's too much content, frankly, on the YouTube, if I start putting out shorts, it's too much. But TikTok I like, because there's no content on TikTok. So then you can just put out little clips of this show on TikTok.
00:25:28.520 - 00:25:44.864, Speaker A: And I think that's super fun. So I'm gonna do that. Sabato. The market has been rough and absurd lately, but Mrbuddy ETH here has some words of encouragement for all the artists out there. Thank you, buddy. So I don't know if this was posted anywhere. Maybe it's put on ETH.
00:25:44.864 - 00:26:26.804, Speaker A: But I thought it was just a really cool work. And it kind of reminds me, I mean, I assume this is deluxe paint, but who knows? I mean, what's so interesting, I find about what Sabato is doing, it seems to have a touch of hasdrubal waffle, but totally in Sabato's own style, you know, but you see the roughness here. And so this is really, really, really interesting. What's going on. I feel like there's some real evolution going on here within this space. And even just these. Is there a glitch? I mean, it looks like this, this may be a glitched image that that's also been incorporated.
00:26:26.804 - 00:26:48.112, Speaker A: So I saw this image and I thought. And there's even commentary and it's almost like a joke. This could be put, you know, there's Richard Prince's jokes series. Oxine was putting out jokes. Sabato is now. This is kind of like a joke here with the lmao. And what is it like? The sole purpose of art is to communicate capital.
00:26:48.112 - 00:27:14.446, Speaker A: So lmao. So kind of a joke of sorts could be seen. It's probably funnier than a Richard Prince joke. Anyway, things are continue to be incredibly interesting conceptually out here. I'd argue with works like this. I mean, we're kind of seeing it in real time. Speaking of hasdrubal waffle, Htm WwFaf s three, how to melt WWF action figures.
00:27:14.446 - 00:27:21.422, Speaker A: This looks like Randy Savage. If I. Yeah, there we go. Savage. Randy WWF. I am old enough to know that. Step.
00:27:21.422 - 00:27:58.114, Speaker A: Wait for sparks and burning plastic smell. So edition of three. Now it's 77 tazos. But, you know, look at these big chunky pixels with all of this great texture, beautiful frame. Again, this is beautiful digital abstraction as a, you know, as a foundation for this portrait here. And again, you see here, like this roughness out here and just here. I mean, this is, to me, from an aesthetic, like digital painting perspective.
00:27:58.114 - 00:28:24.680, Speaker A: This is incredibly exciting. This is like, if I had to boil it down, this is incredibly exciting, what we're seeing here. This is just really cool. It's very painterly, but in a very digital way, super interesting. And there is Worf. Is that his name? Worf? Maybe. I'm the Star Trek next generation guy.
00:28:24.680 - 00:28:41.518, Speaker A: I think it's Worf. Yeah, Worf. These tags are very helpful. Bots talking. My hands on the keyboard create the kujeb based on a true story. So also has dribble waffles. So playing with one of these pieces, it's almost a genre, because I see other artists too, where it's like you.
00:28:41.518 - 00:29:18.414, Speaker A: You just put a whole bunch of stuff, in a sense, like Yoao Salazar has kind of like that technique where it's almost like a stream of consciousness and you just kind of populate the canvas with stuff. So anyways, very cool work here, too. I love the keyboard and the numbers on top. That is super cool. And again, you see the hand with the underneath, there's like this, you know, flashing green airbrush here and here. It looks like a Klingon or Circuit city. So anyways, I have no idea what's going on here, but it's super cool as usual.
00:29:18.414 - 00:29:40.920, Speaker A: Did any sell? One sold at an auction for only 19 tezos. Probably one of these super short auctions. It's probably a two hour auction. And so anyways, super duper interesting. RJ with some more conceptually interesting work. A muted conversation. Who are you listening to? So kind of deviating somewhat from the other style.
00:29:40.920 - 00:30:07.060, Speaker A: He's put out a few works in this style ever since my computer learned to talk, she said, all other voices have grown quiet. Interesting kind of commentary here. Someone like, you know, drawing at their computer and then kind of glitched out on the side here, you know. And he's put out a couple of other works like this. And so almost again, kind of like the office computer, an older computer. This is a one of one. And let's just see what happens.
00:30:07.060 - 00:30:25.132, Speaker A: Sold for 50 tezos. So pretty reasonable price for RJ. One of one. Spuegelsmaskinen. Continuing with the skeletons in small spaces and with the red and the black color theme as well. So here it's in an old phone booth. More retro tech.
00:30:25.132 - 00:30:40.636, Speaker A: Interestingly, current bid, 0.75. So art continues to sell, by the way. So that is interesting too. Skeleton phone booth, last call. Poetic title. And the series is called the closet. So anyways, very cool.
00:30:40.636 - 00:31:01.840, Speaker A: And check this out, too. This was a kind of a. I want to call it a sketch print by Spogels Maskinen. I thought this was a beautiful work. Speaking of screen printing, right? I think this is like a beautiful. And it's like a one color screen print on colored paper. You could do, you know, like, that is pretty cool.
00:31:01.840 - 00:31:27.046, Speaker A: You could also just do a Warhol technique where you just paint underneath, like you know where the gray is, just do. Or like as demon ego was doing, just put some random paint and then you put that on top. That'd just be like naturally beautiful. Anyways, cool work. Here's some more dithering this time from mech TXT. Good night for the unsung strugglers who burn themselves to pass a message of perilous importance. Self immolated.
00:31:27.046 - 00:31:44.006, Speaker A: Good night, fellow strugglers. So this almost looks like someone is self immolating here. So almost like some of the greek sort of theme here. Great color in this piece. And there's another one by mech TXT. Look at this. Almost like a gondola of sorts here.
00:31:44.006 - 00:32:09.880, Speaker A: This beautiful, beautiful moon or sunset. Interesting, interesting colors here. Almost kind of very web kind of color feel to it. And the dithering in here, in the sea here is what really captured me. Like there's some beautiful artistry going on in this dithering here. It feels very manual. It feels like every pixel was very kind of cared after.
00:32:09.880 - 00:32:31.420, Speaker A: This is no simple gradient here. I don't think I'll be resting for the whole day, walking our local park with the family. I hope you are well, fellow strugglers indeed. And here is. We got a preview of this last episode. And here is the judgment by manital. So, continuing the cat tarot, we're on card 20 here.
00:32:31.420 - 00:32:44.690, Speaker A: Beautifully done, as usual. And just fantastic color. I love the dithering up here too. Just like these little pixels in the sky. Sky. Pixels in the sky. Hand pixelated and animated, 121 by 170.
00:32:44.690 - 00:33:06.544, Speaker A: This is probably sold out. I thought maybe I need to reload this. Oh, it hasn't been listed yet, so still you can get it. Green ginger with a cool kind of abstract, semi abstract work here. Extraterrestrial golf. So this is available for Fortezos 90. I think that's on secondary.
00:33:06.544 - 00:33:24.320, Speaker A: So anyway, just kind of an interesting piece here. Semi abstract. Let's just see. Yes, so our milk. And so this sold on primary for three tezos. And again, green ginger is the artist. It's a more kind of pixel art.
00:33:24.320 - 00:33:45.034, Speaker A: Gif. Gifness. Osumi okawara by Renki. So more just kind of interesting work from Renki here, who's been putting out at least a work a day. Cool. You know, again, could hang well with Kappn actually, in a certain sort of way. Really nice kind of background there.
00:33:45.034 - 00:34:06.714, Speaker A: Continuing on, speaking of Kappn. Figments. So, figments, I was wondering, I've been seeing these being posted on Twitter, but I wasn't. It's like, I don't see Kappn minting them. That's because I think this is capping under a different name called figments. So here they all are. So let's go back to this piece that was just minted.
00:34:06.714 - 00:34:29.184, Speaker A: Kind of feels like a video game here. La routina. La Routina. I guess that's the routine, if I had to guess. Kind of a real video game feel to this abstract pixel artwork. So again, just like, yeah, I see sophistication here. I mean, we're taking, you might say, visual tropes from video games and incorporating them into pixel art pieces.
00:34:29.184 - 00:34:43.084, Speaker A: That's kind of, you know, kind of interesting. A buy now for, you know, $3. Actually, it's $2.26 for this edition of 15. I mean, there's six left. So I'm. Maybe I'll pick that up.
00:34:43.084 - 00:34:57.663, Speaker A: That looks fabulous. So anyways, pretty cool series here. Figments muji with an edition of twelve open. Sorry, it's an open edition. It is finished. And this start on Friday. I think it's called chips.
00:34:57.663 - 00:35:18.803, Speaker A: So kind of looking like processor chips here. At least this one on the top right. Again, I think using deluxe paint is. Here it is. Deluxe paint. So again, retro tools here. It's going to be interesting if the AI, I assume the AI could actually make something as complicated as deluxe paint.
00:35:18.803 - 00:35:58.012, Speaker A: In theory. I don't see why not. You know, if there's a feature you don't have in deluxe paint, I wonder if you could just ask it to give you the code of deluxe paint and then add this. Anyways, let's not get off track here. Colorful dreams by bleu 281. So some interesting kind of, I want to call it Ui kind of looks like, almost like window type structures, kind of interesting abstract, has a blueprint feel to it. And blue 21, I think Santiago forwarded me blue 281 and it's worked with Datura.
00:35:58.012 - 00:36:13.504, Speaker A: I mean, this is a beautiful piece. And so is this with Mick renders, who just left the comment there on the plants. Here's the work with Datura. It might be a little slow. Look, it's already 75 tezos. It's a pretty cool work. So this is also with Bleh 281.
00:36:13.504 - 00:36:49.466, Speaker A: And here's another one with McRender's. Bleh 281. So anyways, cool work here from Bleh 281 and McRender's and Datura continuing on. Speaking of Datura, fusion 121. So just another really interesting animated abstract work by Datura. Kind of circular pixel. The edges are circular on the outlines are circular rather than rectangular, which is kind of an interesting take.
00:36:49.466 - 00:37:12.994, Speaker A: Interesting colors, too. Wavering fusion. And then here's Francois's gamma. Not sure I was going to say if this is an old one. Kind of an interesting in 2009. So Francois's gamma, I mean, must have thousands and thousands and thousands of works if she's been working this intently since 2009. I mean, pretty amazing.
00:37:12.994 - 00:37:53.064, Speaker A: So anyways, cool work of what looks like a hand called Mokish. And here's another one, another variation here on the figure walking. So continuing to keep it interesting and to just like, reattack this theme over and over in an interesting way. Kodonakazono with a couple of continuums here. Here's 109 with some beautiful pixelation that down there, I mean, contrasting magnificently with the. With the soft gradients underneath here. So another interesting piece, edition of eleven.
00:37:53.064 - 00:38:22.692, Speaker A: Now on secondary for. I think that was 27. And here's number 108. This was quite different, an edition of one really playing with different contrasts here. This looks almost cartoony, the blue, this looks almost like sculptural 3d, you know, realistic. And then here you have this, you know, this column here. Not, I mean, kind of somewhat greek, but not your classic.
00:38:22.692 - 00:38:40.902, Speaker A: Is that a dorian column, perhaps. And then underneath, just some interesting kind of moving gradients. So continuum number 108, this is a one of one. Let's just see. Sold or offer of 100 not accepted. It was transferred to daylight bucks. Short, cool glitch.
00:38:40.902 - 00:39:03.014, Speaker A: David was kind of a cool glitch work. And here it is, just kind of short and sweet here. Spin class. I meant to celebrate my second year on tasos. Okay, so that looks like someone who is in a class, actually, and maybe two people dancing. Interesting. This was interesting, too.
00:39:03.014 - 00:39:36.774, Speaker A: This is by laser gun factory. Unique, I think it's called. There is no audio. Just kind of an interesting 3d rendering of sorts. Kind of glitched out some letters and stuff. Series represented an inherent correlation between organically and digitally generated forms of life in regards to the unique individual properties they're composed of. It was digital crypto artist from New York, based in Tokyo.
00:39:36.774 - 00:39:51.746, Speaker A: Okay, so cool. Very cool. And listed for half an ETH. Flintboat with a cool work here. 12th of never. Good title, too. Kind of very screen friendly, I want to say.
00:39:51.746 - 00:40:04.226, Speaker A: So anyway, this is kind of a different. Take another animated abstract work here. Completely. I've never seen one quite like this. This is kind of cool. 12th of never. Let's just see what happened.
00:40:04.226 - 00:40:23.594, Speaker A: Transferred out. I think I saw Lorna mills actually tweet this out. So shout out to Lorna Mills and Flintpope and, yeah, Lorna Mills got your workout. Flint Pope. So that is cool. Anyway, cool work. And our friend with the, you know, half a million views here with random access memory.
00:40:23.594 - 00:40:52.274, Speaker A: So the daft punk, you know, it feels like Polygon 1993 can kind of. Again, this is a process machine for me. Like, once you have your process, okay, I'll use these colors and I'll put it through these filters. I mean, Polygon 1993 can just keep making this over and over again, I think. And I think that's awesome. Sometimes the art is the process to, in a large degree, but it has to work aesthetically. One would think.
00:40:52.274 - 00:41:29.024, Speaker A: Here's a work by Sabato. Another, I think, older work, 2015 and 2023. Again, sort of like we saw with Popple using the size of the screen, in Popple's case, an old screen, 600 by 800 here. So this is what I want to kind of highlight is kind of thinking about the size of your screen from a conceptual perspective, you know? And here Sabato is doing that at 1080 by 1920. Again, like a classic, I think you'd HD or a widescreen tv ratio, shall we say. So this is an edition of six. Pretty nice glitch here.
00:41:29.024 - 00:41:46.064, Speaker A: This one really turned out. And let's see. Sold out at 888. So very cool. And here, I always think I'm gonna be keeping these short. Dan Control, Garfield. So just a beautiful, hilarious kind of work here of a cat.
00:41:46.064 - 00:42:04.724, Speaker A: And anyway, he's doing animals all animals series. This is available for three tazos. Really nice piece. Here's rustic digital art. New conversations. So playing with juxtaposition a little bit. The Mario and a portrait and everything here.
00:42:04.724 - 00:42:16.960, Speaker A: So just interesting juxtapositions here. New conversations. Cool title. Fortezos edition of ten. And there are six left by rustic digital art. Yuri J. Six in one.
00:42:16.960 - 00:42:41.352, Speaker A: I thought this was cool because it kind of reminded me of an italian altarpiece, you know, where these things that fold out. And so here Yuri J. Was putting some of his art into that style. And I just thought that was super interesting. And then turning it into a piece here. It's like something you'd find in someone's living room, some sort of piece of furniture that this so called altarpiece would be on. Very cool.
00:42:41.352 - 00:43:11.270, Speaker A: And one by Tiegenhof, another one with this AI generated image edited and animated afterwards. So another beautiful piece here. And this is an edition of 30 for two tezos each. And here's an artist I'd never seen before. Malaya, dudes. So it's tempting to think that these are physical, but then you get weird little glitches which make it look digital, these little lines that go across. Maybe it's created like.
00:43:11.270 - 00:43:31.182, Speaker A: Maybe it's based on physical work, would be my guess. And I think they're on foundation here. There's not too much information. Your favorite artist. So you don't know exactly, but it looks like it started physically, doesn't it? And then it's finished digitally. That's the temptation. So, anyway, it's just kind of interesting artist here.
00:43:31.182 - 00:43:55.494, Speaker A: And they're also on object Malaya XD and so anyways, cool artists. Just interesting work here. Continuing on, lily Illo. The aftermath, my submission for bloom AI exhibition. I feel like I've heard of that. This is bloom. So I think it's like, yeah, they have some sort of show.
00:43:55.494 - 00:44:19.934, Speaker A: Initial output created with text to image using stable diffusion AI. Then in painting and outpainting with Dali, two AI refined with Photoshop and upscaled with topaz gigapixel. So a lot of work going in here. The classic distortions with the fingers and the double hands and everything. Kind of a nice painterly look to it. Interesting arm as well. So cool work by lily Illo.
00:44:19.934 - 00:44:53.840, Speaker A: Continuing on, Santiago, who had this cool still life car parts and fruits vanitas. And so this looks like Santiago. More Santiago AI putting car parts. And of course, his car is breaking once every few weeks here in the middle, juxtaposed in the middle of a still life here. Almost a Dutch looking still life edition of 20 and sold out at four tezos each. And some were transferred. One was transferred to me, actually.
00:44:53.840 - 00:45:17.152, Speaker A: I actually saw the work before I saw the transfer, by the way, but I thought that shouldn't disqualify it. Evelyn. Oh, fiat crash. So this was another kind of interesting piece that I missed from Evelyn O. And just kind of a wild AI artwork here. Fiat crash. So kind of interesting, kind of Ballard feeling AI and digital painting 2023.
00:45:17.152 - 00:45:34.974, Speaker A: This came out in a couple of weeks ago from Evelyn. Oh, almost photographic there. And a beautiful work by Tuks. Desire flips mind persistence. Interesting title. So this just came out this weekend, and it has a bid already and a few bids. 0.186.
00:45:34.974 - 00:45:57.274, Speaker A: So pretty nice abstract AI. Art abstract by tuks. So just interesting on super rare. So, you know, nice price. And Euxine retweeted this out, and I think this is also AI. These are from 2021. I think we can look really quickly here.
00:45:57.274 - 00:46:15.594, Speaker A: 2021. So, I mean, a tribute to Amri Matisse. So I assume this is early AI but I'm not positive on that. So interesting. Maybe it's just. I don't know what this is, but it's a pretty cool. I mean, that almost looks like a Mickey Mouse figure.
00:46:15.594 - 00:46:39.346, Speaker A: And here it looks like jester or something. Interesting series based on that. Matisse, famous Matisse work. Cool remixes. And finally, David Hales, who is awesome on instagram. Just a really cool physical artist that I've been following for years. Mermaid on the shore, acrylic on paper.
00:46:39.346 - 00:46:57.590, Speaker A: So that is a pretty good looking work here. And showing maybe a bit of the process. Look at how great that looks. Beautiful. See the process, how it's being made here, just goes from one side to the other almost. That is pretty wild. Very nice.
00:46:57.590 - 00:47:30.712, Speaker A: I mean, isn't that interesting to see how he works? No drawing, it seems. Anyway, cool, cool artist. And there's some of the other work here. So you see kind of a common kind of feel to it. Look at this Michael Jackson work by Wok, another stunner from walk who's just hitting it out of the park on a daily basis here. So Michael Jackson, I mean, these sprays are incredible. Has just kind of mastered this, as I keep saying here, beautiful portrait by Wa.
00:47:30.712 - 00:47:34.984, Speaker A: And that is your show, my friends. So thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
