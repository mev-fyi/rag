00:00:03.440 - 00:00:32.328, Speaker A: My girlfriend has told me to raise the camera a little bit, raise my computer. So I have done that. So hopefully this is a better perspective. Artist Journal, October 17, 2022 in very warm Berlin today. My name is Adrian Pokabelli, artist, reporter, AI user. I recently rediscovered. I've been using AI tools for like years.
00:00:32.328 - 00:01:32.934, Speaker A: And why some of you might find this funny, and why I find it funny is because we've been having a huge discussion. Some, some of the new subscribers might not be aware of it, but we've been having a discussion over like 30 episodes here, maybe more since September. And this thing's been coming out daily about just AI and what it means and trying to have a very fair minded, interesting discussion, what I forgot to mention. And then we'll come back to Ed's work here. Ed Marolla yeah, so I've been using a tool on my phone, like some sort of AI art drawing tool since like at least 2018, which is kind of funny. Bubba Boo Bubba picked up one of these works here at Tempelhof, kite flying at Tempelhof the park, and I was like, ah, cool sale. I'd kind of forgotten about this series, portraits and landscapes that I was putting out on Versim, but now that versum works are available, and I was looking, I was like, AI powered photo drawing.
00:01:32.934 - 00:02:08.230, Speaker A: That's right. And just, and then, so this whole series, like, like, I use an AI tool, and it's just a tool I use. It's not like the final product, it's just a step in the process. 210 weeks ago October 3, 2018 I already had, like, I was trying to make iterations. I think I'd been using it for a year or two before that. So it's just kind of funny. So lest you should think that I'm anti AI at any point, and then I was looking at this series, and I actually use it for this series as well, the nostalgia Studies series.
00:02:08.230 - 00:02:45.852, Speaker A: It's a crucial part of this process for these works, and I had simply forgotten about it because I use that tool. Like, it's just one of the tools I use, but it is like an algorithm. You can set the settings, and I use my iPhone six s for it. Like, I keep my iPhone six s a as an archive because I made a lot of art on it, but for that process specifically because I like how it comes out on that iPhone, maybe because it's lower res, I don't know, it just works better. So all to say, all kind of hilarious. And so lest you should ever think I'm anti AI. I've been using it for years.
00:02:45.852 - 00:03:07.628, Speaker A: I was surprised to learn, thanks to Bubba's purchase. So, anyways, let's get on with it. Ed Marolla, very interesting work here. As you might know, I'm kind of obsessed with this idea of news art and an art of the present. And. Yeah, so here we have it. This headline of.
00:03:07.628 - 00:03:38.816, Speaker A: We all saw it, you know, the kids putting the tomato soup on the van Gogh. Ed had his commentary here. So I just find this kind of work, uh, interesting, uh, more from a potential point of view of where this kind of artwork can go, because, again, look. Look at the turnaround time. Look at how fast this was. This came out yesterday. The headline was, like, on Friday, uh, you know, so it can be put together very quickly in the digital world, as we know from AI art.
00:03:38.816 - 00:04:16.990, Speaker A: And just digital art in general can be done pretty quickly and shipped out and sold as the work. Not just like, here's a picture of the painting I did super quickly this weekend. You can buy the work and have it in your collection in a matter of hours after the headline comes out. And again, this idea of news artists is something that I. To me, it's just something I'm very obsessed with. So when I see Ed doing work like this, and he had his own commentary, we saw that with Minta, too, just in, you know, not in obvious ways, but in kind of just vague directions in that. Vague moves in that direction.
00:04:16.990 - 00:04:35.950, Speaker A: So he has this commentary here, too. Just stop art. So I guess the commentary is. And their hands are glued to the wall with his trademark sort of, you know, pretty simple faces, which is trademarked for him. That's what I love about Ed. It's unapologetically his own style. Like, he's not trying.
00:04:35.950 - 00:05:11.066, Speaker A: Like, that's what he wants to do there. And you really learn to love it. I guess the commentary here is they're trashing the art in order to make their point. I think it was just stop oil is the news photo and the protest slogan. And so he's put just stop art as destroying the art is what they're doing. So interesting. I just find the whole news art idea, again, artist reporter here, Robert Rauschenberg.
00:05:11.066 - 00:05:59.778, Speaker A: This is an idea that I think has to come back, because when that comes back, art will be so relevant, at least that sort of, like, there's a million ways to make art for a million different reasons. But a news art, a real time response, is something I'm obsessed by, which I've been trying to do and continue to do. I was doing it yesterday, just experimenting. And so anyway, I don't want to take too long on that, but that was a very important idea that I'm going to come back and back to. And I was glad to see Ed working on it. A quick shout out to Chi Moscow Jackson, who is the reason you're watching this right now. He has a show going on, but it was his comment, I believe there were two people when I did an audio version of this show just once, as like, okay, let's just put something out.
00:05:59.778 - 00:06:27.044, Speaker A: And on that audio podcast, I said, maybe I should do YouTube. And I think it was Chi Moscow was like, yeah, definitely do YouTube. And I was like, oh, someone listened to this? And he's like, yeah, keep going. There are two people. And so I just want to give him a shout out because I don't, like, I want to keep. I want to remember that because I enjoy doing this now it's like 60 episodes later. Super excited to share that hologram gallery is having our first in real life NFT show on January 5 in Seattle.
00:06:27.044 - 00:06:42.664, Speaker A: This has been in the works for a long time. Definitely going to have an open call. So good news for you as well. So all the homies can get work in. Maybe I'll apply to that, too. So open call coming from Chi. So give him a follow.
00:06:42.664 - 00:07:14.098, Speaker A: Just a couple of kinda in the ether here. Topics drank, frazetta, purple drank. Charge me whatever royalties you want. You made the art. So weighing into this royalties debate, for those that don't know, there are platforms that have come out in the crypto world where they are getting rid of the royalties that are put on the art pieces. And so this has become a big debate. I think it's lame that the debate is being had at all and kind of, to me, I mean, just my personal take on this.
00:07:14.098 - 00:08:02.880, Speaker A: I mean, Farouk had his take. I'll share Farouk's take and I'll share mine. Farouk also from rug radio. The most annoying part about the royalty conversation isn't that we are having it. It's that people starting it and having it don't actually care about anything else but raising more money at the expense of the culture this community is building. I actually do find it's annoying that it's being had, because to me, it kind of one of the best pr things about crypto is this royalty, you know, ability that nfts have and that artists can be fairly compensated and all this sort of thing. So I am actually, like, the whole debate itself, I think, is lame and kind of shows a kind of selfishness of the crypto world in its, like, it's so obsessed with money.
00:08:02.880 - 00:08:59.330, Speaker A: And that's one of the big criticisms that non crypto people think when they see, you know, they, it's just, to me, it's just like, we're gonna get rid of the royalties, and it's just, to me, it's just like a. It's not even a debate. Like, it's just kind of lame, you know? And sure, I'm an artist, so I have my interests and whatever, but, yeah, I mean, where does. It's kind of back to, we were saying yesterday, you know, we were talking about having self respect, and this actually kind of goes into that whole debate, which is where does. And something I didn't mention yesterday is where does self respect come from? It comes from values. It comes from having values and sticking to those values and going, you know what? At a certain point, I'm off the train. Or, like, some people in extreme situations are willing to die for their values.
00:08:59.330 - 00:09:33.822, Speaker A: So values are important. And when people start having the debate about, oh, should we keep royalties or not? To me, it's just like, where are the values here? Like, you know, like, and I get it. There's a technological side, and if you can get around it, and yada, yada. But so I'm not actually. That's why I've ignored the debate so far. But I thought I'd just touch on it a little bit because it did kind of flow into yesterday's conversation. Measureless had something that we've been talking about, a comment here as well.
00:09:33.822 - 00:10:14.146, Speaker A: Before we get into art, which is this idea of the FX hash dominating your object profile just pointed out there. And this might be a niche one, but on object.com, comma, is there any desire for the creations tab to have a folder option in which you could visually group a project? Almost like our curation idea we were having yesterday, seen as creations is the go to. I'd quite like to be able to collapse my FX hash and all sorts of people. I think popple weighed in on this at a certain point, too, where it's like five of his six pages are FX hash works. And that just kind of sucks. Cause it's actually harder.
00:10:14.146 - 00:10:34.564, Speaker A: Ratcloak. See, it's the same thing. It's harder to find his old work, and that becomes more obscure. Speaking of rack cloak, see, they should have a way to at least filter out the effects hash stuff, because it really kind of messes up people's profiles. On object, just a little. I like to always see how people are working here. So this is Ratcloaksee.
00:10:34.564 - 00:10:57.218, Speaker A: So just kind of interesting to see his process a little bit. And this is about 15 seconds or so. And you see it here. So there it is. So I didn't realize that. So that's just interesting just to see how people are working. Continuing on, looking forward to his new work coming out.
00:10:57.218 - 00:11:23.984, Speaker A: And look at how much triple zero nine's work went for. The super rare bought $3,000.02.3 ETH. So big congrats to his genesis work. On super rare to triple zero nine's genesis work. There were a lot of bidders. And also back to our cross chain, Yuri JJ got another offer, so now it's up to 0.4
00:11:23.984 - 00:11:43.948, Speaker A: for his genesis work. So, I mean, that's $524. So just very interesting. We've looked at this pixel artist before. I think it's japanese. And they put out just their pixel art on a t shirt, so that looks really cool. I think this is the artist.
00:11:43.948 - 00:11:59.664, Speaker A: He was saying, I translated the tweet. I think this is a coffee shop owner. And just a really interesting pixel artist. Looks great on the t shirt. Maybe you can order that from Japan. I don't know what shipping is these days. But anyways, just wanted to highlight that.
00:11:59.664 - 00:12:18.584, Speaker A: I thought that was cool. And this is just like, from, you know, fast food punks. But I just thought this was visually interesting. Why hasn't McDonald's done this yet? Like, the pixelation of their logo looks totally awesome. Maybe they already have. Okay, so over to artwork. Dan control.
00:12:18.584 - 00:12:37.124, Speaker A: I think this sold out, actually. See, that was for two. Now it's twelve. Okay, so dentures with his trademark gradient style here. I love the background. It's kind of haunting, this still life. He continues to turn my head and just impress.
00:12:37.124 - 00:13:04.228, Speaker A: So that edition of ten sold out within a day, and now is selling for twelve. And see the little boy atomic bomb, that's going for 25. And that also sold out. And you look at his market, it is doing quite well. Like, most of it is selling out here and on secondary. So nice work there. We've been covering Dan control for a while, and he's also doing well on foundation.
00:13:04.228 - 00:13:23.132, Speaker A: And these are really cool works. GM with another sale on foundation. Thank you for collecting assault, dear Jeezy. Likes to just turn off the ringer here. So a really nice work. Gradients and everything. Kind of medieval work from Dan Control on foundation.
00:13:23.132 - 00:13:38.634, Speaker A: Now, here was how much it went for. Assault for 0.3. ETH. So just a nice. Another very respectable sale. I mean, 0.3 is what, maybe $400 or something now? So impressive.
00:13:38.634 - 00:13:59.422, Speaker A: Tradscape has a new work. Let's just hit play here. Looks like an octopus. Haircutting octopus. Oh, no, a surgeon. This looks like a surgeon. So just wild, wild work for tradscape.
00:13:59.422 - 00:14:19.474, Speaker A: As usual. This is still available, I think. Really cool music. Usually he makes the music, if not always the music. To this podcast or video podcast. This show is tradscapes buy for ten edition of 20. There are 15 left, so you still have time.
00:14:19.474 - 00:14:55.214, Speaker A: So this is part of that new series called Animal occupation. And he had this other one, which is the. I guess that's a crow with some interesting hands. Spagels Maskinen has a new work from the abnormal series. So this one sold out right away. So retro technology. It's a very, very nice old computer in the background.
00:14:55.214 - 00:15:15.370, Speaker A: Beautiful music. So, yeah, just another winner. I think it's already. What is it selling? It's already for 50. So if you miss that, you got to make an offer or pay the full 50. Another portrait, which I love by who's. I don't know the name of this guy, but we've seen some of his pixelated portraits before.
00:15:15.370 - 00:15:40.240, Speaker A: He had those Game Boy portraits of, like, Coolio. See if we can get this working. And this is notorious big. See if this works here. So just an interesting portrait. How much is this going for? For four tezos. You see, it just does the three four view, I think.
00:15:40.240 - 00:15:54.154, Speaker A: Just really nice. Great size. Gets the resolution right. It's like the perfect sized resolution. So you can see it there. So just put in pixie biggie smalls. If you're looking for that Kangal edition.
00:15:54.154 - 00:16:11.074, Speaker A: Stop that. Another Ed Marolla work, river, which he found in his files. He put out a tweet. He was going through his old works. That's where you find some of the nicest works. I found some of my nicer works just in old files. So this is called river.
00:16:11.074 - 00:16:25.602, Speaker A: And a nice, beautiful rendition here. It looks like there's a little pot here in the bottom of the river. Or ancient vase. I really like this work. I thought about buying it. It's a one of one for only 20 tezos. Flow through me.
00:16:25.602 - 00:16:38.434, Speaker A: Until I become you, river. Another beautiful. What looks like a river with a sun. Good night. The spine kept on sketching even when the fingers stopped painting. The most precious arsenal we got. Have a good rest, everyone.
00:16:38.434 - 00:16:51.354, Speaker A: The brain. So this is by Michael Macasso. This hasn't minted, as far as I know. But it's a. Love the color. The color makes it, for me, just a really beautiful pixel work. This has been minted.
00:16:51.354 - 00:17:10.138, Speaker A: Endurance. This is 325. And it looks like just a rock, sort of part of its nature series here. And continuing on, we have more of these works byte by bit. These, which I find super interesting. A nebula. The Stingray nebula.
00:17:10.138 - 00:17:29.770, Speaker A: One of one available for nine tezos. Okay, there is another one. Planet pixel Helix Nebula. I love this series. And again, they're not expensive and they are one of ones. And he is using retro tools, as I like to call them, pc paint 3.119 88.
00:17:29.770 - 00:17:55.674, Speaker A: And you can see that in action. So he showed the work in progress. You can see the tools here. So probably using an emulator or something over here. Continuing on, a beautiful work that I just saw on Twitter. It's not new, but just an original take on Mickey Mouse, which seems to have that japanese woodcut sort of look to it. Right, from like the late 19th century.
00:17:55.674 - 00:18:13.996, Speaker A: Like, Hakusai is not the guy, but there's a guy that did a bunch of erotic drawings that are in this style. Japanese, really famous. You can find him at the library. They're not too risque, but they are risque. Nalta nia. So he's like just looking at my old works and. Yeah, so that one really stood out.
00:18:13.996 - 00:18:32.784, Speaker A: An artist that I've never seen before. Turkarak. And I thought this was just interesting. Kind of reminded me of this other artist that we'd been looking at, Ezra Eslin. So we'll go back. So one of these illustrator artists. Top secret meeting of the association of businessmen who want to wear pink shoes.
00:18:32.784 - 00:18:49.374, Speaker A: And what is going on here? Buy for five. There's only two. None have sold. So very low edition, pretty reasonably priced. Just an interesting illustrator. I brought up some of their works. So kind of edgy a little bit.
00:18:49.374 - 00:19:10.566, Speaker A: So, yeah, just interesting. Kind of undiscovered artist, I'd say, for the most part. And it's always nice to bring in new blood here. So Turkarack is the name and you can get their works. Get a one of one here for 20. So, yeah, pretty cheap. And here's Ezra Eslin putting out a good morning, Waldo.
00:19:10.566 - 00:19:32.902, Speaker A: So you might know where's Waldo? So her spin on that, she's selling it on Opensea. I missed that. Let's see if we can just see current price. .46. I don't know if someone bought that or what the history is. Yes, this is sale sold a few times. From the looks of it interesting.
00:19:32.902 - 00:19:55.230, Speaker A: Look at all these sails, just back and forth. There are ten of them. Okay, so that explains it. So just kind of an interesting work here. A play on where's Waldo? And you see her typical kind of death and destruction. You see someone lit on fire at the beach here. Otherwise a peaceful scene, but you can see actually someone's bleeding here.
00:19:55.230 - 00:20:20.266, Speaker A: So her unsettling works. Another person. So it's kind of her version of where's Waldo? From Ezra Eslin. This was just another interesting artist that I'd never seen before. Foundation was putting Flo Meisner's work on the front page, and I just thought it was nice work. So here it is. Just these flowers with the sky and a geometric pattern, basically.
00:20:20.266 - 00:20:39.334, Speaker A: Kind of a little bit of awp art. Let's just. Here's the expanded version. A heart, you know, a cross, a skull, just in these little boxes. I wonder if we have last sold for three ETH. Pretty respectable 4000 by 5000. This one was just kind of interesting too.
00:20:39.334 - 00:20:56.744, Speaker A: I couldn't tell if it was digital or not. I'm sharing this one because it's so important to me. This is Narciso, and did I. Yeah, this is also narciso or the same artist, and I really liked. So this was just kind of interesting to me. I couldn't tell if it was digital or not. Just an interesting work.
00:20:56.744 - 00:21:17.504, Speaker A: Then I went to the page, I think this is the same artist, and I went to his page, and I saw this beautiful. It is the same artist, and I saw this beautiful St. George and the dragon. Okay. And this is. Yeah, so this is, so you saw the original there by raphael. This is a beautiful rendition.
00:21:17.504 - 00:21:37.314, Speaker A: Again, I can't tell if this is physical or not. I would like to know. It kind of looks like when you look at the cape, it actually looks digital because it's so clean. Because if this is digital, I kind of want to buy this. It's an addition of ten for two tazos. I may just buy it anyway. It's a very nice rendition.
00:21:37.314 - 00:21:55.902, Speaker A: So, yeah, so that is the original. I've done my own just in passing, so this sounds super rare. This is probably my second biggest sale here. $5,000. 5150. And that sold to who? Bipbip. So thank you, Bipbip.
00:21:55.902 - 00:22:23.744, Speaker A: Again, that was almost a year ago now, but a wonderful sale. Long live the bull market. More physical work here. Before we go into AI Dao, Kante draws just another beautiful work from her. This looks like marker, almost end colored pencils. The delegate is in town. You see these small people rolling out the red carpet for what looks like the disco queen or the Disco king.
00:22:23.744 - 00:23:05.818, Speaker A: Zoom has. Okay, so she has a new series called New Generation art Studios. We were talking about this, computers in the art studio. So she has a new series now based on this, so you can buy it for three. Big computer literally every day of mine. And so maybe I'll have to pick this up because I really like this idea of a new take on the artist studio with a big computer and just like what it looks like today because it has changed and it's kind of like, it's kind of like a classic theme. So I believe that's AI, generative digital art.
00:23:05.818 - 00:23:25.464, Speaker A: AI, yes. So pretty nice. Okay. Very nice. And 400 tezos offer for my g for this strange thing from Lily Illo, who is another AI artist. So interesting. I just thought that was a pretty impressive offer.
00:23:25.464 - 00:23:47.438, Speaker A: So it's a one of one. And also, as we wrap up here, Ilya Bliznetz. This is on foundation, a reserve of 0.25. I thought this was a slightly different take on AI. So this is on foundation picnic. So I just thought that was kind of interesting. Just kind of turned my head.
00:23:47.438 - 00:24:14.434, Speaker A: And you see these kind of limbs that are separated. So almost playing with AI distortion and pushing the AI distortion and almost making what I call AI distortion the subject matter of the work to some degree. And here's another one which just kind of turned my head. This is by Petra voice. That last one was by, yeah. Ilya blizznets. So this is by Petra voice on Twitter.
00:24:14.434 - 00:24:36.074, Speaker A: And just some mushrooms and a woman. It looks like AI. This one was quite nice. I've never heard of this person. So you see how these AI artists can come out of nowhere, but we have seen this style a little bit with freakin hell. It's really reminiscent of freaking hell. Kirill Shulgin X.
00:24:36.074 - 00:24:57.172, Speaker A: And it looks like shulgin is the name here. So just a really kind of head turning work there. Very beautiful, moody work. AI, clearly, I assume. And one more AI work. Wild palms. So again, just a surreal landscape, very clean.
00:24:57.172 - 00:25:21.680, Speaker A: And this is by wild palms. And is there a work? So, yeah, I don't know if this is FX hash. Like it's being called generative art, which is kind of interesting. Maybe this is generative art. So AI meets generative. Maybe there is no AI, but I think there's AI in there. And finally, so there is a new AI tool for text.
00:25:21.680 - 00:25:43.602, Speaker A: Introducing lex, a word processor with AI baked in so you can write faster. Lex page. I've been working on this for a while. So glad to finally share it. And then this person. I just tried an AI powered writing app and I am so so hilariously out of a job it literally gave me goosebumps. I'm not allowed to share it with you yet, but I will when I can.
00:25:43.602 - 00:26:12.316, Speaker A: Please send me new career ideas so this could be a really good one. Lex page so a mind blowingly fast writing experience. So FYI. And finally Burka Bayram. I don't always draw. Sometimes I write, but when I write I also enjoy making illustrations next to my short stories, so why not both? So he is selling some mini books as PDF's on Tazos a journey to nothingness for five Tazos edition of 100. And there is his work.
00:26:12.316 - 00:26:25.724, Speaker A: So very cool. You know what this reminds me of is beyond painting, where Max Ernst added a lot of his own drawings in it and that's what it looks like. Anyways, that is your show. Thank you for watching. Until next time, take care.
