00:00:09.880 - 00:00:47.294, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 7, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, your artist reporter on the scene, sharing his personal thoughts publicly for all of us to consume. For all of you, I suppose, to consume. Thank you once again for joining me. Never a dull moment. I mean here another work I'm sure you've seen Francois Gamma, those who have been around a little bit. And just another interesting work.
00:00:47.294 - 00:01:21.574, Speaker A: We can quickly take a look at his work because it's just one to check off that you should know about if you don't and if you're new. It's just he's just been so consistent, releasing stuff, and he's been around a lot longer than I have. And so, you know, and I discovered him in Haiti. Roquette's collection. Actually, let's just look at his stuff very quickly now, just so you get a taste of it. And you can just see here he plays a lot with like pixel work and these walking figures. He does a lot.
00:01:21.574 - 00:01:45.214, Speaker A: So I think I picked up that one. He releases on Versum a lot, which may or may not help him. Probably not, even though I really like the versum platform. A lot of people do. But the sales, interestingly, don't seem to be as strong. But yeah, he's mostly on Versim here, so just some very interesting. He often does these running people with lines.
00:01:45.214 - 00:02:15.394, Speaker A: I really like this work, but he never actually sold it, I don't think. Yeah, he never sold this one. I haven't bought many of his works, but this one I wanted to buy and I couldn't buy it. So that was kind of funny. So anyways, just, I really liked this new work he did over here. So I thought, why not? It makes nice decoration at the start of the show. And I don't mean to say decoration in a bad way.
00:02:15.394 - 00:02:43.414, Speaker A: It's a beautiful work. And just another seems like a. I don't want to call it a new direction because he's always been experimenting with pixel work, but just a nice work on versum. Three tazos still available. Now, we got a very interesting comment yesterday that I wanted us to tackle. Here we go. So remember we were discussing AI and I was talking about the hand.
00:02:43.414 - 00:03:22.474, Speaker A: Remember that? We're talking about the hand now. I was showing some skepticism as we investigate this. I thought, well, you know, for 2500 tezos, I mean, this hand seems somewhat unresolved to me. Like, is it. And is it supposed to be a table or a chair? I suppose a chair arm or a real arm, you know, and it kind of. There wasn't a decision made here, and to me, it felt unresolved, as if maybe it had been made quickly. But the person who commented, blammo, thanks for the comment, blammo.
00:03:22.474 - 00:04:07.474, Speaker A: The AI looked, such as the incomplete hand, are becoming aesthetically popular. There are just too many who mint AI images to not create a forced new, ubiquitous style, which will probably start to be imitated by non AI artists. Even it doesn't make it good, but does mean it will probably sell better than we would have originally imagined. Interesting point. Like, this isn't a bug, it's a feature, is Blamo's point, and Blamo may be onto something here. So a very thoughtful comment as we're trying to figure this out. And again, I haven't even used the tools yet, so it's kind of a fun process of discovery here.
00:04:07.474 - 00:05:04.714, Speaker A: So just another way of considering all this, and let's just look at the name. There's a couple of other works by. Strange thing, because I was looking, I was like, oh, you know, I picked up this one and then I was like, oh, do I want to pick up this one? And then I took a closer look again and I saw the face has kind of this weird AI face to it. Maybe we can even make that bigger. It has the weird AI face, you know, and you can see in here, and again, it starts to break down a bit. And for me, this was a bug, but according to Blammo, I shouldn't be looking at this kind of AI look as a bug, but as a feature. I guess I'm still skeptical on that, but I'm very open minded to that idea.
00:05:04.714 - 00:05:22.166, Speaker A: Very interesting comment. Very interesting comment. So that's what stopped me. I was like, oh, maybe I should pick this up. It's a little expensive at 35, but maybe it pairs nicely. I always have this excuse to myself, well, now it's 50. Okay, so someone bought it.
00:05:22.166 - 00:06:07.360, Speaker A: There's web links. Shout out to web links. A great collector. So anyway, I wanted to point out that comment because I thought it was just very interesting. Like, again, this idea of the AI distortions as being a feature, not a bug. So that is something that should be considered, definitely. I mean, again, I would be my, in my universe, the way I would use AI, at least without having used it yet, and I will soon, is I would take all of the stuff that worked, which is like 99% of it, and I would actually try and fix this however I could.
00:06:07.360 - 00:06:31.876, Speaker A: And I don't think it would be that hard. It would be tricky. You'd basically have to find a head in this similar shape. But in the history of art and in the history, just something on the web, doing Google image search, using the image to search, I bet you could find something that could start to. There's not too many fixes you'd need here. And then it would just be like. And it'd be tempting to not even say it was AI.
00:06:31.876 - 00:07:29.834, Speaker A: Why should, like, there's probably all sorts of works out there, my friends, that are AI that are not being claimed as such. And so, you know, it would be tempting to be like, I'm not even going to tell people I made this on AI and I'm going to look like a genius because look at these works. Especially if I got rid of the obvious AI distortions. I think that's a nice term, actually, AI distortions. So anyway, more food for thought as we make our way through this. AI, what I was, what I'm calling AI summer, you know, versus JPEG summer last year. Again, I think it's unquestionable, actually, or leave a comment if you disagree that this is easily, you know, the most significant thing that's happening in the visual arts right now.
00:07:29.834 - 00:08:11.068, Speaker A: And you just think to yourself, these galleries, by the time they plan a show and get the physical works and find the artists, and maybe their artists are making some works by the time all that happens. I mean, this is months of planning. The digital advantage is you get out here, you put it on, you do your experiment, you can mint it, and the world can see it by evening, and the next day you can have another work and another work. And just so we know now, strange thing has not sold. Final little bit on here, the Jordan. This is not sold yet. So I'm kind of watching this because I kind of wonder if strange thing kind of overdid it a little bit.
00:08:11.068 - 00:08:53.880, Speaker A: But I've been proven wrong so many times on what people will spend and how they value things. And people just have different. Some people are like, all over this and are probably deeply thinking about it right now. So that's why I'm watching, because I'm not assuming that this isn't going to sell. Okay. Junk has a new piece and Terry visual, KHC, the Kurt Hussle collective, who I am long, I want to say long time fans of probably since February. So early, you know, early in my collecting journey, I discovered Kurt Hussle collective looking at Heidi Roquette's collection, who was one of the very first artists that I started collecting.
00:08:53.880 - 00:09:53.464, Speaker A: And I want to give him his due in another episode, because he is awesome, and he's just kind of out there on his own, and he's just, again, a major talent. So I discovered what used to be junk Jnk, but now it's Kurt Hussle collective, because it's actually two people. And I'm not surprised, because the works are quite elaborate. So he has a new piece, bet house boxing, playing again with this kind of television, nineties television vibe. Again, incredible production. It's perfectly done. The music is always good.
00:09:53.464 - 00:10:36.588, Speaker A: So I don't think you would mind me putting this on. The whole thing. Better luck next time. So, yeah, another mysterious work. I mean, I guess this is, like, japanese game show satire, parody, kind of with a nineties flavor to it. Again, it's got that glitchy video thing. The productions on the KHC's work, the Kurt Hussle collective's work is off the charts now.
00:10:36.588 - 00:11:12.338, Speaker A: I just wanted to show you some of the early ones that got me just so excited, like, and the music on their work. And do they say, looking for a cassette cleaner? Tm. Okay. Soundtrack by culture. Because listen to this track. And again, I'm always comparing this to the contemporary art world where we were mentioning this previously, where video is often just kind of obscure and heavy, and you don't. I don't relate to it.
00:11:12.338 - 00:11:37.214, Speaker A: Like, maybe other people are loving it, but I find it, frankly, alienating. Most video I see in contemporary art galleries, we have the Julius Stochak collection out here. Nothing against them. It could just be a totally different taste. And I was thinking, maybe this is generational. But I remember seeing, oh, she's like the same age as me, so it is just a different taste. And, you know, contemporary art video is quite.
00:11:37.214 - 00:12:18.044, Speaker A: For me, it's a drag. So that's why discovering, you know, junk and Terry visuals work. KHC was a huge revelation to me because it was fun, and I could even relate to it. And so we got this nineties ad here for cassette cleaner. Now we'll just put on the music here. So this is video I could get excited about, because first, the music was awesome. Like, really awesome.
00:12:18.044 - 00:12:44.038, Speaker A: Like, this is a great track. Okay. And then you put it all together, and I go, if I have a contemporary art gallery, I know what I'm putting on the wall. I'm putting this on the wall. This looks great. This is awesome. This is something a 15 year old can go to and be like, can we go to the gallery again? Okay, let me show another one.
00:12:44.038 - 00:13:32.756, Speaker A: I mean, these are just brilliant. I remember when these were coming out just like, what is it? Two months ago, February, I was just like, holy. Like, I was kind of obsessed with KHC's work for about a month. Like, my girlfriend. My girlfriend would be like, you know, here we go again. Adrian's talking about junk and Terry visual. So we knew we had to give KHC their due here, because, again, as I was saying in a previous video, I'm not much of a video art guy.
00:13:32.756 - 00:14:03.416, Speaker A: At least I wasn't until I came to this platform. And I'm like, oh, okay, this is some video art I can get into. Again, you imagine this on the wall, and you're like, wow, this is super cool. Again, it's kind of back to that idea. When was the last time you went to a contemporary art gallery? And we're that excited, and we're that, like, this is awesome. Maybe recently it does happen. And, like, so just hilarious.
00:14:03.416 - 00:14:37.824, Speaker A: Great glitches, beautiful production, crazy imagination, and again, like, almost like, interesting commentary, satire, you know? And just finally, one more that's just call the Curt call center right now. Brought to you by KHC. Just a dollar, 97 a minute. $2.72. 1900. 1997, 900. So again, great music.
00:14:37.824 - 00:15:09.174, Speaker A: Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. So edition of ten. You can get this for ten tazos. And let me say, he's a very, very nice guy. So I want to give junk and Terry visual their do. Now, just a quick. I've noticed now, we've looked at Heidi Roquette's work a little bit, but I noticed there, and he does a lot of Nintendo glitch, rom type stuff.
00:15:09.174 - 00:15:44.700, Speaker A: And I did notice recently this Glitchtown arcade is starting to appear in places. And so there are, you know, again, this has existed for a while, like, at least since Corey Archangel at the Whitney. I remember seeing Super Mario brothers, where it was just the clouds and then some really loud music. That was, like, a while ago. Like, a long time ago. So, yeah, I mean, rom corruption is something that's kind of on my list I want to try out at some point. Everybody puts their own kind of spin on these things.
00:15:44.700 - 00:16:02.852, Speaker A: So just another one. I quite like Haiti roquettes. Now, I don't want to leave this on for too long, because this is almost dangerous for some people. So that's acid boy has a new work. And, yeah, I'm tempted to get it, but I have to pull back. I mean, edition of ten for five. I mean, pretty interesting work.
00:16:02.852 - 00:16:29.664, Speaker A: Again, very consistent. So just want to show that. And there's this Yuri JJ who showed up. I think it was rustic digital art. Apologies if I got that wrong mentioned. Hey, Pokebelly, profile this guy or what about a profile on this guy and sure, why not? I mean, Yuri, JJJ I was looking, I mean, he's been around. I assume it's a he.
00:16:29.664 - 00:16:57.050, Speaker A: Let's just call him. Call it Yuri. Since June 14, so been a while and has, you know, has minted pretty consistently along the way. The market is quite healthy, as you see with these prices here. I'm always a fan of this keyboard stuff. I always like the keyboard in the computer. We see that with Adelia.
00:16:57.050 - 00:17:18.190, Speaker A: It's actually I have some beautiful nfts and I'll just show you the work that I picked up. I think there's a new one as well. Curtain with blue pattern. I'll show you the one I picked up like a month ago. You see, owned one. I was a big fan of this as soon as I saw it. It sold out pretty quickly too.
00:17:18.190 - 00:17:52.004, Speaker A: And again, just these takes on these interiors with weird space. Basically it's not cubist and you have this kind of flatness which turns into space. Looks like someone's studio apartment. Something you'd find in Berlin, frankly. So very interesting, you know, patterns, palettes. So just want to let people know about Yuri underscore JJ as we go through. I mean, there's so many artists out there, so just another interesting artist there.
00:17:52.004 - 00:18:22.184, Speaker A: I don't know if I'm going to be able to find. I'm going to find it for a future episode. Some of these keyboard and computers, but wanted to show that there's also a. I was on the Twitter and where is Yuri from? I was looking, I couldn't find it. There's also an update. Let me see if I have it. Ratcloaksee has another auction, by the way.
00:18:22.184 - 00:18:49.876, Speaker A: And we all know auctions are a great place to get new work. FOMO freezer or work at good deals. FOMO Freezer has a very interesting. FOMO Boy has a very interesting collection I was going through. I kind of have mixed feelings about these on cyber worlds. Like they're a lot of work to look at the work, but it looks great. You see an early myth here.
00:18:49.876 - 00:19:13.904, Speaker A: So check that out. Just go to Fomoboyz Twitter. I also want to just show the results of Lewis Osborne's. Remember how he was changing the selling technique to look, look. He's still open. Questions. Rough idea of next drops.
00:19:13.904 - 00:19:27.334, Speaker A: One or two random loops. Bloon 520 moving cities. Six airdropping to holders of two plus moving cities. Good. I'll get one wow. Because I bought some of those early ones for two. That would be great.
00:19:27.334 - 00:20:01.744, Speaker A: Anyone know a tool to check multiple holders of a collection on objects? So you see, Louis Osborne is trying to be creative because he's seen that, as I keep saying, the middle class is getting priced out. And there was, let me just see very quickly here. Here it is. So the last one where he picked the top nine offers and then did a draw on, like the last, you know, 15 or something. Huge thanks to everyone who placed an offer on this. All top nine offers and 15 random offers have been accepted. I think this process works a lot better than just top offers.
00:20:01.744 - 00:20:40.432, Speaker A: Please do let me know your thoughts, though. Pretty cool if you ask me, because it keeps everybody in the running. If maybe, you know, because 35 tezos just to be in the running, that's what it cost. It was a minimum, so if you want to be in the draw, you still had to pay 35. So it's not nothing, you know, that's $55. So interesting move. And maybe we'll see more of that as artists get more popular and ways of kind of keeping their original fans, which is probably what he's trying to do in the running, where it's still affordable.
00:20:40.432 - 00:21:10.660, Speaker A: Still expensive, but still affordable at the same time with that. Oh, there's just one other thing I wanted to point out here, which is a thank you to. How do you pronounce the name? It's like, easy. Easy, Jules. Easyjewels. That's probably what it is. Who sent me three works as basically a thank you.
00:21:10.660 - 00:21:26.264, Speaker A: I messaged and said, wow, thank you. I assume this is just for doing the show. And he said, yes, I appreciate it. I really enjoy the show. So he sent me this great Haiti roquette edition of Eleven. I was actually looking at this way back when. I missed it.
00:21:26.264 - 00:21:47.958, Speaker A: I didn't pick it up. And then. So thank you to easy jewels. I actually have it now, so good one. And let me just look through. And sent a couple of others. Sushi Master by Adelia and this Lewis Osborne, which I didn't have.
00:21:47.958 - 00:22:00.654, Speaker A: So just awesome. So thank you. Really nice. And he also picked up a work which was also appreciated. Let's just see. Yeah, here it is. He picked up the St.
00:22:00.654 - 00:22:14.364, Speaker A: Catherine work for ten, I believe. Yeah, for ten from. I don't knows. One don't knows. So. And I did this for the. Where you put out 100 of 100.
00:22:14.364 - 00:22:31.884, Speaker A: What was it? The Tezos. For Tezos, where you do an edition of 100 and you sell it for a Tezos. And this is a remix of an original work. And I'll quickly show you that. And we can call it a show here. Let's see if super rare loads up here. Let's see.
00:22:31.884 - 00:23:02.992, Speaker A: Yeah, so this is based on this original, which I actually have a huge physical version. Maybe I'll show that in a show. Cause my tagline says traveling through the mediums. Cause that's kind of what I do. I go from digital to physical and back, and I find that movement. A few people do this, but that movement is extremely interesting. And we'll go into that actually more in depth because it's kind of a Warhol and a Richard prince move that I'm kind of riffing off of.
00:23:02.992 - 00:23:29.574, Speaker A: So let's go really quickly into the Warhol, Andy Warhol, because it's actually really important. And I may forget. And we'll go very quickly here. There's a work in the Frankfurt gallery. What is it called? The Steidel. There's a work in the stedel, I believe it's this one or a version of this one. And it's huge, this work.
00:23:29.574 - 00:24:02.782, Speaker A: And what's so interesting about it? So how was it made? So Warhol has his original image. He adds, of, say, of Goethe. He blows. Takes a picture of it. Let's say he blows it up, and then actually, he traces it while it's still small. See this pencil line? Then blows it up. And then screen prints both the drawing and the photo in different layers.
00:24:02.782 - 00:24:32.162, Speaker A: And puts rainbow paint, as you see in the. Here you only see, like, the red and yellow, but different versions. You'll see a full rainbow in the pencil tool, in the enlargened graphite tool. Graphite, which is a photo of the graphite. If you see where I'm going with this, like, he's playing with scale and. And mediums. And I think that's kind of where a lot of the.
00:24:32.162 - 00:25:14.278, Speaker A: As far as the process side of contemporary art is concerned, is an extremely interesting area, particularly kind of pre digital. And I'm kind of adding the digital side to that and a digital element to this mixing of the mediums. Okay. And this kind of alchemical process that happens when we transform something, when you take a picture of a drawing, let's say, and then blow it up, it actually changes the look. Scale is a very interesting tool, conceptual tool. And you see it at work here, especially if we were in the statel looking at this. It's a beautiful thing to behold.
00:25:14.278 - 00:25:26.622, Speaker A: This photo of this painting does not do it justice. So let's leave it there. We're going to come back to this topic. It's crucial. And with that, thank you for joining me. Until next episode. Take care.
00:25:26.622 - 00:25:27.014, Speaker A: Bye.
