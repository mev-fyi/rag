00:00:03.160 - 00:00:48.924, Speaker A: It's kind of funny. I have Star Trek in my head to boldly go where no person has gone before as I look at the Star wars writing coming up the screen in this brilliant glitch. By Heidi Roquette, artist Journal, May 5, a day after May 4, 2023, broadcasting to the world from inner space in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokobeli, and welcome back. And isn't this just the coolest work? So cool. Whether it's each little scene, whether it's the Star wars writing here almost with japanese text. And again, it's kind of this interesting conflation of the movie.
00:00:48.924 - 00:01:19.480, Speaker A: Like, we recognize these scenes. Then it was interpreted by the video game giving us these highlights, taking the movie. And then, okay, we're gonna make a Nintendo game out of this. So we're gonna take these famous scenes, like here, you know, at the start of Star wars. And so there's another interpretation. And then maybe, you know, where you're part of the game is you have to get the tie fighters here. So, anyways, just a beautiful, super duper cool work by Haiti Rocket for May 4.
00:01:19.480 - 00:01:47.008, Speaker A: In other words, may the fourth be with you. Just really rising to the occasion, shall we say? Haiti delivers. Haiti Rockette, the great glitch artist, and more great digital artist. And so, anyways, a beautiful work here. He's still got a few left if you are, so maybe you can put an offer in. But I was looking at this. Cryptoronin is trying to get one.
00:01:47.008 - 00:01:59.844, Speaker A: Still waiting here. So let's see. Sold for $9.69 in the middle of the Berlin night. For ten minutes, it was available for nine. Tezo, 69. Few people managed to get one, and the rest have been burned.
00:01:59.844 - 00:02:40.288, Speaker A: Seven for Haiti. So, anyways, millennium Falcon is the title. A beautiful way to start our Friday. Almost like a punk rock way to start our Friday here. Thank you for the great comments yesterday. We got really nice comments. Gogolitis Artist Journal is a genuine philosophical adventure full of inspiration and discovery, and that means a lot coming from gogolitis, because if you go to the Twitter spaces where we're fortunate to have gogolitis as the special guest back in February, you see actually how philosophical gogolitis is in his, what was it? The reality simulator device that he's comparing to Plato's cave.
00:02:40.288 - 00:03:38.028, Speaker A: And it just goes to show the sophistication that sometimes goes into these pixel artworks as well. Something very interesting that he really highlighted in that was how much he cares about inspiration, and that's a very important subject. And again, we should return to Plato's phaedo, where you get the four forms of divine madness, which is actually a super interesting take on inspiration and artistic inspiration. It's a great subject that's not often discussed. And I think, yeah, like, I mean, there's many kind of ways of thinking about it, but in our modern world, we don't really, ideally, you'd say the professional artist, and I've said this myself, does not wait for inspiration. That's for amateurs, one could argue, right. If you're always waiting to be inspired, well, maybe you'll make a work every so often, but you're not gonna.
00:03:38.028 - 00:04:21.896, Speaker A: Like, the real professional is basically producing all the time. And so the, yeah, so that is an important concept. That being said, even though we might have this idea that, you know, inspiration, waiting for inspiration is for the amateur artist. You gotta get to it. Nevertheless, there's something to be said for inspiration as a real thing. Like in kind of one of my kind of sub studies as I was going through university was, you know, kind of becoming a somewhat like, that was a very important topic for me and kind of really studying that. And what does that mean? Because you have all sorts of, you know, it's got an interesting history not often discussed.
00:04:21.896 - 00:04:36.536, Speaker A: So anyways, thank you. I'm glad you're enjoying that. Go go Latus. And that is the spirit of this show. So thank you for the comment. You don't know who we are with an interesting comment here. Amazing show.
00:04:36.536 - 00:05:16.138, Speaker A: Thank you. The Santiago's work is one of the most incredible things. The questions, the pieces, the divulge ations. I personally consider him one of the greatest artists that I have the honor to share the same timeline of existence with. So I've always kind of had this theory that this is Santiago, the you don't know who we are account, and I suspect so. It's kind of, I feel like this is adding to the thesis, the overstating of things almost purposefully to make it so I think maybe, just maybe, you don't know who we are. Is Santiago here? And there's Santiago himself.
00:05:16.138 - 00:05:23.234, Speaker A: Thanks. You don't. Thanks. You don't. For all your support. Thanks for all the support, as always. My pleasure, Santiago.
00:05:23.234 - 00:05:40.074, Speaker A: And thanks for the hilarity, if that is you. And if it's not, my apologies. So anyways, all hilarious. And I was saying to you, don't know who we are. I couldn't agree more. Really interesting comment from Ariel Presti. Very substantial comments.
00:05:40.074 - 00:06:13.976, Speaker A: Excellent show. Thank you. The theme of Ballard's fiction and reality that you mentioned reminded me of the theory of fictional worlds developed by the literary theorist Lubomir Dolezel. In his case, more focused on how art and literature can connect with certain alternate realities. So that is interesting. I've never heard of Lubomir Dolezel, but interesting. I mean, what I always love about Ballard's work is how grounded in reality it is.
00:06:13.976 - 00:06:40.640, Speaker A: Like, I don't read a ton of literary theory, although I'll check this out. It could be really interesting. But what I love about Ballard's work is you can kind of, in a weird way, like, it almost gives an interpretation of surrealism that this is kind of over reality. Like, it's kind of like a. A super. As he defines, surrealism is where inner and outer space meet and fuse. You know, if you take.
00:06:40.640 - 00:07:10.134, Speaker A: That's almost his vantage point. And, like, for me, it's kind of changed to a certain degree. My metaphysics and my approach. You know, in a sense, I see imaginary things have a certain degree of reality by them being thought and in a very real way. And maybe we'll get more to this. We have a comment by axe on simulation and Baudrillard. So maybe we'll just hold that thought here.
00:07:10.134 - 00:07:25.574, Speaker A: Tornado Rodriguez. What I learned with you is unprecedented. Now I come to learn that Grey's anatomy is a pun on the name of a real book called Grey's Anatomy. Indeed. And this is a very important book. This is kind of what. What I'd almost call cool knowledge.
00:07:25.574 - 00:07:59.574, Speaker A: Grey's Anatomy. You should know. As to me, this is just kind of like one of those touchstones that are well worth knowing. Let's not forget, as we've discussed in earlier episodes, many of the great writers of the 20th century studied medicine. I believe Joyce, James Joyce did. Ernest Hemingway was on the front lines in World War one as an ambulance kind of attendant, you know, and who else? I mean, William Burroughs studied at Harvard medicine. Ballard studied medicine at Cambridge.
00:07:59.574 - 00:09:02.181, Speaker A: So it's this whole idea of, you know, what is the purpose of what we're doing here? And I'm kind of back to this qualitative science thing of one of the main things that arts can provide, that no other, you know, thing can do. The kind of knowledge, the worthwhile knowledge it can provide, one could argue, is knowledge. What I call qualitative science, knowledge of human nature, you know, like a lot of Sigmund Freud's work is sort of dismissed right now, as far as I understand, although I heard it's making a bit of a comeback, interestingly, as a surrealism. But a lot of Freud's work, which is very qualitative. I mean, there's no, it's not like I did a theory, I did a study, and seven no quantitative data. It's all qualitative kind of theorizing. So the scholars or the scientists, you know, the psychological scientists, the psychologists, modern, they don't know what to do with it, I would argue, because it's like, what do you do with this? There's no numbers.
00:09:02.181 - 00:09:49.820, Speaker A: This isn't the scientific method. This isn't science. But I'd argue there's a, you know, but it's sort of like, I'd argue it's a kind of qualitative science in the way that the history of literature, like if you go back to one of the first novels in the english language, one of the first novels, which is Tom Jones by Henry Fielding, if you read the preface or the introduction to that, it's about five pages, well worth your while. It's a huge book. I've actually read that book, amazingly to myself, the first five pages in that preface, it's all about, we're going to have a huge banquet here, and the subject matter is human nature. Okay? And so that's what we're going to go through. That is, in a sense, you could argue.
00:09:49.820 - 00:10:40.076, Speaker A: You could infer from that. That is the purpose of this book is to study the, you know, what in religious terms is called the soul, and in atheistic terms is often called the psyche. In Greek, it's all the suke, the psyche. Okay, so back to the anatomy and the doctor theme. If the purpose of, say, the artist or the writer, if one of the reasons you do what you do is an exploration of human nature, well, then it's probably worth your while to be studying the body, which is kind of our first, you know, pass at trying to understand ourselves. Right. And then we can go back to the Renaissance artists, you know, Michelangelo and probably Leonardo were doing the same thing.
00:10:40.076 - 00:11:04.744, Speaker A: They were doing dissections even when it was kind of a dicey thing to do. So the important, and here's Grey's anatomy. So it's kind of a. It's kind of a touchstone in your knowledge, I would argue, as an artist, depending on what kind of artist you are. But if your subject matter is human nature, then this is a fun thing to know. So anyways, thank you. We're going to look at Grey's Anatomy in a second, actually.
00:11:04.744 - 00:11:46.984, Speaker A: And runetune, very interesting approach to various size pixels on that mandal work. I totally agree. Thanks for sharing my pleasure. Yeah. Because again, when we're making pixel art, we're always thinking that we're on the same canvas size, right? And what seems to be going on in Manitobl's work is it's taking different canvas sizes and then maybe enlarging smaller canvas size, eight pixels by eight pixels, let's say. And then make clean it on the 100 by 100 pixel canvas, stretching it out, and you start getting this really interesting contrast, which you often don't really get, which is kind of easier to make when you're transferring across canvases. So, anyways, thank you for all the great comments here.
00:11:46.984 - 00:12:07.072, Speaker A: Very substantial and interesting. Grey's anatomy. Here it is. My sister had this copy, actually, when she was in pre med, and yeah, I remember it well. So this is, you know, the very famous medical textbook. So here it is. I don't know if it's medical textbook, anatomy textbook.
00:12:07.072 - 00:12:43.554, Speaker A: And here is just a quick. Just a quick paragraph here. And again, this is called the doctor's Bible. Okay. Grey's Anatomy is a reference book of human anatomy written by Henry Gray, illustrated by Henry van Dyck Carter, and first published in London in 1858. It has gone through multiple revised editions, and the current edition, the 42nd October 2020, remains a standard reference. So they did drawings, and you can see here, they did drawings of the human body.
00:12:43.554 - 00:13:20.148, Speaker A: And again, like 150 years, 170 years later, it remains a standard reference. I mean, that is incredible. So they really did a good job on. So that's Grey's Anatomy, not the tv show, but the book that the tv show, of course, is based on. It's interesting how they changed the spelling to Gray's anatomy with an e rather than an a. Maybe that was a copyright thing, who knows? Although the copyright must be dead after 150 years, but you never know how those things work. Nice comment from Microsyl.
00:13:20.148 - 00:13:39.376, Speaker A: I greatly admired Flora Marquez arts. Never thought that I had anything in common with her. I also don't exercise and don't eat well. That was a great episode. I'm sad and laughing while listening to this. It's really inspiring episode to listen to, and I'm glad to hear that microsil. And yeah, it's a great episode here with Flora.
00:13:39.376 - 00:14:06.442, Speaker A: I really polished the edit there, so it should be an easy listen as far as the spaces are concerned. So thanks for the comment. Much appreciated. So here we go. Axin on yesterday's discussion of fiction and nonfiction and AI mid journey five new mid journey reminds me of simulacra and simulation by Jean Baudrillard. Baudrillard maybe. But I like Baudrillard.
00:14:06.442 - 00:14:38.704, Speaker A: Real world filled with near perfect simulations. Real no longer exists. AI take our day jobs next. Salute. So, yeah, so interesting. So this whole word, simulations. Simulation and simulacra, I mean, I have a, I think it works with the AI thing because I think you could call that, and I'm not an expert, but I've done some reading and a lot of thinking about this and, yeah, I think we could call that a simulation.
00:14:38.704 - 00:15:56.704, Speaker A: Fair enough, in a sense. What's interesting, though, for me is the root. Like, I think simulations and simulacra, if I'm not mistaken, came out in 1980. And when I learned about Baudrilzi in the mid nineties, he had this essay that was already kind of well known and famous called the Gulf War never happened, if memory serves. And what I love about that whole concept is I think it highlights the importance of the media in the creation of simulations. Because I think part of what Baudrillard was thinking is that the media creates the reality. And what he meant by the Gulf War never happened wasn't that there was no war in Iraq in 1991, Gulf War one, Norman Schwarzkopf, and, you know, but that the war, as you know, maybe consumers of CNN, like us, people in North America and maybe Europe as well at the time in 1991, and maybe the rest of the world that had a television, that what was taking place on the tv screen was not actually an accurate depiction of what was happening on the ground.
00:15:56.704 - 00:17:00.400, Speaker A: So again, this very practical actual philosophy, and it kind of similar to Ballard, which is very practical, kind of modern day philosophy, you could argue like, you could argue again, we're talking about Ballard and almost, you could have a kind of metaphysics that's based on these ideas. So again, and back to this word of fiction that in a sense, the war as shown, let's say, by the mass media, Gulf war, one, one could argue was fictional, you know, in relation, relative, you know, whatever. However we want to define that relative to what actually took place. You know, this whole idea, it's a Ballard line that reality is a stage set, you know, of sorts. And so, yeah, so now it maybe this is getting intensified with AI, where again, we're back to this idea of the fictional content is becoming indiscernible from the real. So, yeah, the real no longer exists. Now, this is the thing.
00:17:00.400 - 00:18:41.040, Speaker A: This is a really interesting question to unpack as well, because let's not forget now, Baudrillard was a pataphysician, the science of imaginary solutions, which we could go back to Alfred Jarry, the french playwright, and I guess you could call him a novelist, I think, Doctor Fostrel Pataphysician, which is kind of a tough book to read, but brilliant of these guys who sail across the cement streets of Paris in a skiff or in a rowboat. Beautiful image, right? A proto surrealist. The surrealists loved Jari. So this idea of the real no longer existing, it almost depends on how you define it, because from, I think, the pataphysical or from the pataphysicians viewpoint, in a sense, yeah, it depends what we mean by real. And do we base our metaphysics on physical reality or in the pataphysicians view? I would argue, and maybe I don't know if anybody would agree with me in those circles, but the ground of the metaphysics is actually the imagination, that, in a sense, just imagining something, there's an ontological or a realness to something simply being thought of. Right? And so that's a different thing from using matter, which is generally the ground, oftentimes not always, of metaphysics. Again, you go to the platonists, and I don't want to get too far in the weeds here, and who knows where I end up there.
00:18:41.040 - 00:19:27.844, Speaker A: And anyways, all to say, you know, for some people, matter has never been even going back to the ancients is what I was trying to say there, that the soul is actually the groundwork. So back to this idea that the real no longer exists, it almost depends on how we define it. And I don't know, maybe Baudrillard would say that. I think he probably would say that the real has been engulfed and all this sort of thing. I mean, I use people like Baudrillard as a kind of. As a launch board to provocative ideas to get me to certain thoughts that I can kind of ground. And so, yeah, the idea of a simulation, for me has always been kind of very related to the media.
00:19:27.844 - 00:20:06.316, Speaker A: But I think it's a fair point with AI and media narratives being created, but with AI, where it is kind of re establishing the question so of what is real? And is that a simulation? It's an interesting point, and frankly, I haven't gone back to these texts in a very long time. But I want to come back to this. I think this is because we're seeing it with AI. This issue is pressing itself against us. And now we kind of like, what do we have in our toolkit? We got Ballard, we got Baudrillard. Right. You know, so I'm all for it.
00:20:06.316 - 00:20:28.282, Speaker A: And here's a not to get too. This should be a pretty quick episode. Look at how few tabs are here. So reasons to rejoice, everyone. Anyways, here's a nice little screen here of an auxine work. Almost like one of the gifts here, but again, treated differently, endlessly attacking the image in different ways. So which is super cool.
00:20:28.282 - 00:20:52.154, Speaker A: So anyways, and a nice kind of square screen here and everything. So just an interesting display here. Kim Acendorf, event horizon minting brT moments, Tokyo. So again, another one of these little screens. And again, this looks like one of those data machines. I'm gonna have to bring those up. Yeah, I can bring that up right now.
00:20:52.154 - 00:21:16.524, Speaker A: So let me see. This almost looks like a submarine. Let me see if I can. Dada Ral Hausmann okay, this is so kind of this famous image. A lot of you are going to know this. Almost like reminiscent. They were big on these kind of machines that have no function.
00:21:16.524 - 00:21:55.498, Speaker A: Didn't we just see that with Kareem safa, the factory that makes nothing or that has no function, it's just, you know, so again, kind of a data esque idea, the factory of nothing. Right? So anyways, here's that. And this kind of, is kind of reminiscent to me. Again, a kind of factory of nothing. Event horizons, maybe just some abstraction here, but kind of reminds me of those things. And again, using one of those screens that we saw that spugels Maskinen had, one of these kind of little screens that I've, frankly, I don't know where you'd buy or whatnot. But anyways, interesting to look at.
00:21:55.498 - 00:22:41.240, Speaker A: I wanted to highlight this again, this is one of these AI accounts that you've probably already seen text to website tools. In the next disruption dream enables anyone to build and deploy functional web applications with prompts instead of code. Just imagine how good these are going to get. And this is what I wanted to show though, the example drawing app, and I believe to go back to Santiago, he's made like the Hasdrubal waffle draws have been made, as far as I understand, with like chat GPT. And so here it is. I mean you can just, with AI, with chat JPT, you can make drawing apps. So that's interesting, isn't it? I mean, so, and then add a button labeled clear that can clear the drawing canvas and then it's that simple.
00:22:41.240 - 00:23:09.296, Speaker A: And then all of a sudden the clear button shows up here. So yeah, back to language programming. I mean, you don't need to be a coder anymore. That seems to be one of the benefits of AI is you don't actually need to be a coder anymore. You just got to have to be able to, again, use your language properly, program your language properly. Interesting thought here was just kind of a quick thing on the market. Then we'll get into the art here.
00:23:09.296 - 00:23:27.114, Speaker A: And we have a stunner coming up next here. Crypto art. So, WG. So, again, back to this idea of a bit of a bear market here. Crypto art has a big problem. Most artists are having basic sustainability issues. I think a lot of people in Berlin would have to step back and laugh a little bit.
00:23:27.114 - 00:24:04.504, Speaker A: Join the club, man. Many collectors just want to collect cookie cutter designs or the same that bigger collectors do because they were told it was hot and scared to venture out of their safe space. We need more collectors that want to grow outside their immediate wallets and actually care about art. So, all to say, I mean, most artists are having basic sustainability issues. I mean, to me, this is just an example of how good the people in this kind of crypto art scene have had it, right? I mean, that's how good people have had it. That several people have been able to sustain themselves. That is amazing just on their art alone.
00:24:04.504 - 00:24:27.640, Speaker A: So, you know, I still see, like. I mean, I'm not as worried as WG. Cause I see people out here on way less, and they're still here. So, anyway, to me, this was just evidence of how good it's been in the crypto arts scene. And look at this. I mean, this sold out right away. Marcelo Pinel with a beautiful, beautiful work.
00:24:27.640 - 00:25:00.344, Speaker A: Let's just. Speaking of the market, I mean, this sold at 38 tezos. So over $40 addition of, like, 25. Now, I think he held a few for himself, held seven for. So let's say 27 times 38. I mean, should I get my calculator here? As you look at this, I mean, you know, 27 times 38 is 1026 tezos. Now, it's a nice work, but this sold out, like, and that's with seven left.
00:25:00.344 - 00:25:35.592, Speaker A: So, you know, people are still spending money on art, from what I can tell. Maybe it's not, like, as crazy as it was before, but look at this anyways. This is called Taurus element Earth. So maybe this is part of a whole, I don't know, Zodiac series. Anyways, it's gorgeous. It's easy to forget the originality of what we see in the top left corner here with these kind of three 3d fruits. And didn't Marcelo Pinel, didn't he have some sort of computer issue where he had to, I don't know if it got destroyed.
00:25:35.592 - 00:26:03.248, Speaker A: He lost all his files. I think he had, if I'm not mistaken, he had to remake a lot of this stuff. So amazingly. So anyways, and you see the rainbow here, so very psychedelic. And let's not forget, Alex Gray follows Marcelo Pinel. And in my world, actually, if I was to think of who is the kind of successor, in my opinion, to Alex Gray, it's actually Marcelo Pinel. So who knows? I'll say.
00:26:03.248 - 00:26:41.398, Speaker A: But just kind of a very unique psychedelic kind of artist that really stands out. And it's hard not to see Marcelo Pinel as that. Anyways, great work from Marcelo Pinella, available on secondary for $69.90. And here's actually a cool, I think, what he called a black and white monochromatic sepia version. So that's cool. And again, makes you think about the physical versions of this that could come out so interesting foundation for physicals, if you ask me. So gloom tube is out killing the parts of yourself you hate most.
00:26:41.398 - 00:27:21.450, Speaker A: So an interesting piece here with a sharp knife and a person of the gloom tube character kind of attacking himself with some interesting experimentation here. You see the almost the gradient here, the circular gradients here. It's almost like, you know, this is a dream of sorts or out of his mind. And this is interesting here, too, almost. The psychoness of the scene is further highlighted by the blurred outedness, almost the depth of field that gloom tube is experimenting with. So always pushing the envelope here in terms of form. End content from gloomtube.
00:27:21.450 - 00:27:41.314, Speaker A: Very interesting. The couch looks great, too. So interesting piece here from gloom tube, available for 25. And what did that sell for on primary for twelve. And so not too. Basically have to pay double, but not a terrible price for a gloom tube here. Again, sold out in like 15 minutes.
00:27:41.314 - 00:28:03.074, Speaker A: Does gloom tube have any left? No, maybe just one of theirs. Anyway, so mostly sold out there. Continuing on, stalko with a really cool piece. I love this. Something kind of precious in the sense that it reminds me of like a Piero della Francesca Renaissance portrait. I think you even know it. It's in the, if you know the.
00:28:03.074 - 00:28:37.658, Speaker A: In the Met, I think it's there where there's the husband and wife and it's like a marriage scene and they're both facing each other. And I'm not sure if it has a border like this, but to me, this border, there's something very kind of Renaissance esque about it. And I think it's actually quite a beautiful kind of modern portrait of sorts but even here, it almost has like a bodicelli, like, you know, ribbons kind of coming down. Anyway, beautifully executed here. Interesting color. I mean, it's easy to forget this white hair, this black background, this pink, you know. Anyways, really nice piece.
00:28:37.658 - 00:29:03.706, Speaker A: I picked that up. I also picked up the last one, the Marcello pinel, inspired by belladonna of sadness. One of the most influential animations I've come across. This one has a very special place in my heart as I deeply resonate with what she has been through. So kind of this melancholy figure here too. So maybe like Piero della Francesca, perhaps love is the subject in the subject's mind. So a cool work here by Abdsel.
00:29:03.706 - 00:29:32.294, Speaker A: Mad world. Really interesting. The sensitive content thing overlay here, I found. And actually a really cool composition, kind of a really rough kind of drawing at the bottom with someone. And this is almost how you could do VR at the very start, where you could use your phone as a VR tool. I think I have some of those glasses somewhere out there in my apartment. And so interesting kind of interface here with the recycle and then the inter.
00:29:32.294 - 00:29:49.274, Speaker A: So it feels like. It almost looks like an Instagram screenshot. And maybe it is. Maybe this is. Maybe that is what happened. So let's just see what just mad world. Okay.
00:29:49.274 - 00:30:26.408, Speaker A: Anyway, cool work from Absal Flora Marquez, continuing a very interesting series, incorporating collage into the drawings. So really nicely drawn here too, the legs and the skeleton and using this landscape, kind of plate of a landscape, as a body, as a torso of sorts. So pretty interesting. Pumping blood is not small feet. It's not a small feet. And there is the heart there, hidden within it all, a little red heart. And this was mentalist 420 picks it up exactly 20 tezos.
00:30:26.408 - 00:30:51.964, Speaker A: Right on the spot here was an interesting piece by RJ. This came out a little over a week ago, nine days ago, for 0.25 ETH. Kind of a different direction a little bit. And there is a clown on a laptop. Kind of has a bit of an impressionistic, kind of Renoir lunch sort of thing going on, doesn't it? Very Renoir esque. And I mean, usually RJ is.
00:30:51.964 - 00:31:24.568, Speaker A: Is looking at a reference here. So, Hopper, Edwin Hopper painted soir bleu in 1914 after returning to New York from Paris. So it's almost like Hopper saw Renoir and then made his own version of it. And then RJ, of course, is doing his. I think it's pastiche of Hopper. So it's interesting art through the ages, as they say. And here, another work by RJ.
00:31:24.568 - 00:31:47.524, Speaker A: Your computer is intelligent conversationalist. It can answer your questions, whatever it is that you want to know, all you have to do is ask. And so they wait upon the oracle. And here it is. Ask AI answers for all. So a very. A work of the moment, right? A work of the present and interesting, kind of almost like the ghost in the machine here.
00:31:47.524 - 00:32:13.234, Speaker A: Well, you know, interesting questions here. Almost kind of very kind of personal questions, adding kind of an emotional side, a human side, to the computer. And here it is. And it will be minted shortly, or it can be minted shortly at 0.02 edition of 50. So more interesting conceptual material from RJ. Francois Gamma was kind of a standout work here.
00:32:13.234 - 00:32:46.162, Speaker A: Almost looks like, I mean, at first it almost looks like a constellation of sorts, but then it almost looks like maybe it's like an autocad or Adobe illustrator sort of vector that's being made here. So again, Francois Gamma continues to explore the technology through the subject matter of the body and particularly the body in movement. So, and aesthetically beautiful. So a great piece here. Edition of 20. And they're all left. Maybe I'll pick that up.
00:32:46.162 - 00:33:11.034, Speaker A: Walk sq. Two for three tazos. Beautiful piece. Love the matte black background, too. And here is one bit horror, who, I don't know if they abandoned Twitter or what, but they're just all about the Instagram, I think. And here's this, like dithered Rose. So just, again, just like totally original.
00:33:11.034 - 00:33:55.428, Speaker A: I mean, that's one of the things you have to love. And this looks like some sort of sigil or something. Cool music too, by the way. And this beautiful rose, very chill music, so very cool from one bit necro, also known as one bit horror on Instagram. Headless horse stream by Ed Marolla so look at this. I mean, I'm zooming in here just so I can show you what's going on in classic Ed Marolla is, you know, turn these abstract areas, put some eyes on it, and you start getting representational figurative work. Interesting.
00:33:55.428 - 00:34:20.072, Speaker A: Just sort of, let's see if I can back up here. And a little city at the bottom and this horsehead. So anyways, just kind of playing around here, putting out ideas not dissimilar to Flora Marquez in a sense. There's another figure here. And then just this beautiful movement. So instantly identifiable as Ed Marolla at auction. One of one for 35.
00:34:20.072 - 00:34:47.274, Speaker A: Let's just look at 9 hours to go, no one bid. So maybe get an Edmorola cheap if you're lucky. F u c k render teznown. So they are doing a test noun. A lot of dithering here. I think we have the tes noun. Interesting take.
00:34:47.274 - 00:35:05.893, Speaker A: And that is your loop. So an interesting take. Maybe that's the tes noun here. So pretty original, I have to say. And I didn't realize that they were on object, so I took a quick look here. And there it is. Just one page.
00:35:05.893 - 00:35:22.868, Speaker A: And. Yeah, then I brought up this work here. I was like, oh, some cool dithering here. Kind of like interesting interior with windows and everything. And just some dithering too, for one solitude. This is an edition of 20 available for 70. There's a few available around that price.
00:35:22.868 - 00:35:48.200, Speaker A: And anyways, just kind of interesting work. I actually don't know that much about that artist, even though I know it's a fairly well known crypto artist. So anyways, interesting piece here. And plants, haworthia tabrai type, succulent. So anyways, a nice plant by cap and Hayes. Look at this great border. Just beautiful.
00:35:48.200 - 00:36:11.944, Speaker A: And this great pot. And again, using the powerful contrast of the colored dynamic pixels with the static monochromatic black and white pixels. So just a beautiful simple contrast here. Yeah. So this is available for three edition of ten. There are four left. Get it while you can.
00:36:11.944 - 00:36:28.152, Speaker A: And also by Kappn, I believe, Esradones. So just an interesting abstract work here, I think. I think this is part of a series. I think we looked at this, where they're releasing a few like this. Here it is. Let's look really quickly. I'm pretty sure we visited.
00:36:28.152 - 00:37:00.634, Speaker A: So, pixels, maybe this is also look found in the depths of a lysergic dream by Captain Hayes. So, yeah, so going under the name pixels, right? And we've been here before. So anyways, kind of, you know, biological, you know, feeling multipixular organisms. So more kind of scientific biological work. Interestingly, Lucas ox new drop on object after my tez nouns. So here it is, amoeba number 26, linked below. Interesting pixelation.
00:37:00.634 - 00:37:15.884, Speaker A: Hey, jpegs, artifacts. And maybe that is actually just how Twitter is treating it. I'm not sure. But anyways, I thought it was interesting either way. Either way. So. Oh, here's the, here's the link.
00:37:15.884 - 00:37:34.972, Speaker A: And how are we doing here? And we're going to speed up here. We were doing so well. Okay, so maybe this looks quite a bit different. It's interesting how the compression changes it. So, this is amoeba by Lucas Ochs, edition of one for 28 tezos. So there you have it. I mean, it's a completely different work here, interestingly.
00:37:34.972 - 00:38:02.008, Speaker A: I mean, I think some of the glitch people would be all over these artifacts here. Continuing on, our milk with tired pixels, number 59. Pretty nice piece here. Beautiful. And our milk was also on a spaces which have proven to be invaluable to understanding these artists, because I think he was saying his dad, maybe his uncle, his family made stained glass. So that is where a lot of the kind of inspiration for his work comes from. So it explains a lot, that stained glass feeling.
00:38:02.008 - 00:38:20.918, Speaker A: Beautiful piece here, available for 20 tezos, and that's on secondary. So this sold out on primary, I believe he's out of Poland. And accepted offers. About ten tezos. So that's pretty good. And Rata also has a tez noun, and it's at auction for $124.81. So, class, of course, the rat with the noun.
00:38:20.918 - 00:38:40.412, Speaker A: Glasses here, pixelation. And let's just see how much time left. 15 hours to go. So this could go for quite a bit of money, actually, in the end. Shout out to Rada. Now, this artist here, Polygon 1993, who we've been looking a lot at, turns out they're on object. And remember the million views that they had.
00:38:40.412 - 00:39:04.724, Speaker A: So liquid. XYZ Polygon 1993 has so many incredible and lesser known editions on tazos that it feels like a crime not to share. Check out these two gems. So here are a couple. And here's another. And so anyways, I brought up their page here because a lot of us maybe didn't know that. And so here you can see some.
00:39:04.724 - 00:39:17.020, Speaker A: Some of the work here. Here's a moving one. It's pretty expensive. 2000 for a one of one, 2000. And so. And it's not exactly like the stuff we're seeing on Twitter. This is kind of close, though.
00:39:17.020 - 00:39:40.478, Speaker A: So this is 1500 tezos. So not cheap, but if you're getting a million views, it's probably not a bad deal. Not financial advice. So, Sora Yamagon. So this is a tribute. So this is a still, but pretty nice. You see those trademark kind of colors and textures, even the ext three, which they beautifully leave in, which creates a wonderful contrast and just kind of layer of meaning there.
00:39:40.478 - 00:39:54.484, Speaker A: Koda nekazono. A new filament. So more experimentation over here from Cota. More beautiful experimentation. Totally has a fan base. I'm not sure if these are selling yet. Just offers coming in.
00:39:54.484 - 00:40:21.768, Speaker A: So very nice place to be as an artist, where you can just wait for the offers to come in. Renki with a new one too, which could hang really well with that. Coda work. And this is called Ira. So there's one left at ten, tezos edition of ten. And then a work by Santiago, secret map inside a body. So this is a GLB file, 3d file to commemorate the AI body arts contest.
00:40:21.768 - 00:40:41.448, Speaker A: Made for what does it mean to have a body? So that is cool. So taking the AI body renditions and turning them into 3d files. So pushing the limits here. Impressively, a brilliant artist. Dancing baby. So I guess this is a meme. I guess I'm late to the party.
00:40:41.448 - 00:41:03.374, Speaker A: About the dancing baby. Mean Parsa Mostagima has this work and this. There's even some volume here. And this came out maybe last week. We'll take really amazing here. And there's the dancing baby and CD and all in this great keyboard here. Really beautifully done.
00:41:03.374 - 00:41:29.282, Speaker A: So cool artist. I guess this came out 2022, but just listed here a couple of days ago or, sorry, a couple of weeks ago, April 26. And it's available for 96 ETH. Nice music, kind of soothing. Here's another one of these, kind of. I'm almost calling like plasticine 3d Plato artists. So Steven Deibus, who we saw in the studio making.
00:41:29.282 - 00:41:55.230, Speaker A: And then it was giving away the painting in that other work. So here's a new one put on opensea. Interestingly. So another kind of interesting kind of one of these, what I'm tempted to call plasticine works here, available for zero, seven, five ETH. And I think there's ten. You can read the German there edition of ten, I think. And also Stefano Colferai, my entry for 36 days of type on Instagram.
00:41:55.230 - 00:42:32.204, Speaker A: So again, it's interesting to see how many of these artists there are these kind of 3d, almost like, what did you call it? Play doh or plasticine kind of animation. There's a word for that. Anyway, someone scrolling through their instagram. Pretty cool to see them all together. And there's of course Yoao Solazar. Right? And then you look at Venta here and it's almost got like a plasticine kind of 3d modeling feel to it here as well in this edition of six, available for ten tazos. So AI work, really interesting contrast to the figures up here with the background.
00:42:32.204 - 00:43:08.360, Speaker A: Very nice piece here. How many are left? Two left upon a perch. And here was an interesting kind of. I'm not sure if we saw this artist before. Gif Annex Melina kind of reminded me of what we're seeing from skirbo, but different. Remember Skirbo, the one who kind of has the crashed JpEG figures? They're all kind of falling apart. This is almost like a square, like a rectilinear version rather than the curvilinear version, kind of a hard angle version of what we're seeing with Skirbo's work.
00:43:08.360 - 00:43:48.692, Speaker A: So anyways, just interesting work kind of masking a photograph. And here's clownvamp with a very painterly work. The night June 8, 1970 fire and you're going to see the beautiful texture that we're starting to get here, even here. I mean you're getting the light coming down and it almost looks like a beautiful kind of impressionist painting of a flying saucer coming in or maybe it's the fire, some fire in London or something, who knows? But anyways, I think that was earlier than 1870, the great fire of London. But anyways, interesting work. Available on secondary for 18 tezos. Let's just see.
00:43:48.692 - 00:44:01.574, Speaker A: And sold on primary as accepted offers of eight tezos. So very cool work there. And that, my friends, is your show. Have a great weekend. Thank you for joining me again. Till next time, take care.
