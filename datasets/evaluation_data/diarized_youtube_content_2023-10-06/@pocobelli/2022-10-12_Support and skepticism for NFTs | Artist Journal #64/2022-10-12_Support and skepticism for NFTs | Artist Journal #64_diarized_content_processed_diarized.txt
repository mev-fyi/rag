00:00:03.920 - 00:00:35.166, Speaker A: I've been informed it is Nike and not Nike. I guess this is what it is to have a YouTube show. Thank you for the message, though. We learn something new every day here. Artists Journal, October 12, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, artist, reporter and things have never been more exciting than what I am seeing. Well, maybe they have been, but they're pretty exciting.
00:00:35.166 - 00:01:08.384, Speaker A: Let's just put it that way. Lavon making great progress here in the midst of geopolitical uncertainty. Lavon makes a beautiful work here incognito. Six mysterious artwork. Again, I find it a really interesting category here. The digital oil painting is what I want to call this. I mean, it's really using digital tools, oil painting tools, but with a really nice effect.
00:01:08.384 - 00:01:40.694, Speaker A: So and really nice bids, as you're going to see. So just kind of an interesting kind of like to me and feel free to comment. Otherwise, this looks like kind of half Lucifer, half rabbit, just a strange monster. So maybe very fitting in October here, a one of one at auction for 269. It made some very nice bids here from prominent collectors. Vincent van Doe, Gigachad, Pepe I haven't heard of. So they are duking it out.
00:01:40.694 - 00:01:57.354, Speaker A: Dextere, who we all know. I mean, it's hilarious. We know most of the people in this scene here, at least this little scene in the auction here. So anyways, so that continues. I was trying to load this up. Object wasn't loading it. Let's see if it works this time.
00:01:57.354 - 00:02:40.664, Speaker A: I keep getting a page not found, so I don't know if that's hurting the auction or not. Maybe it's just my Internet or what and a big GM from uszizine or Uczene or ukzene. I just thought that was funny. Again, keeping with our Halloween October theme in full effect here, that was one of the better GM's I've seen. Few notes here. Mikey de la Creme is announcing this November drop that he's doing for Arthropo NFT and he has like some of the biggest, heaviest hitters on Tazos, Ratcloaksea, myth, Matthias la Plata, Art deft and Kappa. So you can see it all here.
00:02:40.664 - 00:03:13.570, Speaker A: So just follow Mikey Wilson and there is Arthropo collectors road show Twitter spaces tonight. So I'm going to attend that and I believe Mikey will be talking. I'm not sure, but if you're a collector, join in and you could probably get on stage and start talking, share your opinion. So that is tonight, 09:00 p.m. Berlin time. Quick thank you to the anonymous collector for picking up fire here. Another eight bit nature series I'm proud of.
00:03:13.570 - 00:03:50.318, Speaker A: And thank you to Greco for I accepted the offer from Greco on my last one there. Generally I like to keep one because I'm kind of building this museum in my mind, but you know, you can't marry your work. And so thanks to Greco for making the offer and I hope you enjoy it. It's nice to get offers for your work. All is good. So thank you for that work, which is ravers. And some very nice comments from Marco Maragi, Mary Migraine and Vito Vitaca, who is Glitchtown Arcade, by the way.
00:03:50.318 - 00:04:22.946, Speaker A: So really nice stuff here. So thank you for that. Very encouraging. This is interesting. So a lot of you are probably familiar with this Damien Hirst currency project. It was launched on Opensea, or actually it was launched on this palm NFT bridge to Ethereum to make it environmentally friendly. Anyways, I'm sure everybody has seen this series and so Hearst owns a thousand of these things and here it is, the currency.
00:04:22.946 - 00:04:48.410, Speaker A: And of course, most of you know Damien Hirst, prominent contemporary artist. The year's over. Boom. That was quick. Well, not quite over, but we're working on it. And we have all had to decide NFT or physical, which kind of fits into one of our debates here. The final numbers are 5149 physicals and 4851 nfTs, meaning I will have to burn 4851 corresponding physical tenders.
00:04:48.410 - 00:05:16.334, Speaker A: So he has to burn a lot of his work. That was the deal. That was the experiment with the currency is you got to choose if you want the physical or the digital. I mean, philosophically, my opinion on this is actually the physical is the real work. The NFT is a photo of this physical work. So that is kind of my two cent on that. But we're going to look at the floor here and then we'll go back to Hearst.
00:05:16.334 - 00:05:39.144, Speaker A: I mean, the floor is 5.2, so 5.2 ETH. So we're talking over $7,000. And if he has a thousand of these things, that's like over $7 million. So maybe not the hardest decision in the world and just totally liquid. I mean, if he dumped it on the market, the floor would crash, but he could slowly release it should he want to.
00:05:39.144 - 00:06:18.042, Speaker A: I believe in art and art in all its forms, but in the end I thought, screw it, eff it. This zone is so effing exciting and the one I know least about. And I love this NfT community. It blows my mind. And this is actually super interesting here because we've been talking about the different cultures between contemporary art and web3. And so here's from someone that knows, okay, who's been there for decades. I have been in the physical art world a long time, and I expect people to have agendas, and I've seen a lot of bullocks, and I'm amazed at how this community breeds support and seems to care about stuff.
00:06:18.042 - 00:06:51.480, Speaker A: So in the end, I decide I have to keep all my thousand currencies as nfTs, otherwise it wouldn't carry on being a proper adventure for me. And so I decided I needed to show my hundred percent support and confidence in the NFT world. Even though it means I will have to destroy the corresponding thousand physical artworks. I still don't know what I'm doing. And I have no idea what the future holds, whether the NFTs or physicals are going to be more valuable or less. But that is art, the fun part of the journey and maybe the point of the whole project. Even after one year, I feel the journey is just beginning.
00:06:51.480 - 00:07:34.404, Speaker A: I think a lot of us feel that way. And this optimism we saw it. This optimism we saw in another artist, I want to call him like, fcate ETH. Remember that speech that that guy gave and said how, how much better he had? He had works in like, the Met and the San Francisco MoMA, and he was just, you know, waxing lyrical about how much better web3 was from a cultural point of view and just the community and everything. And it's something like, we commented it there with the YouTube comments and all of it. Like, that is part of what makes this great and the openness, which is why I push back when these galleries say it's not open. I showed it yesterday how you can set up your own gallery on object and you just got to make deals with the artists.
00:07:34.404 - 00:08:06.184, Speaker A: Like die with the most likes did with that gallery there. I've already learned so much and it's only been a year, okay? So. And I'm so proud to have created something alive, something mad and provocative, and being a passenger along with all the other participants in the currency, and to help build a fantastic community on Heni. Now Henny is again this blockchain. I don't know too much about it. When I first entered the space and I was just learning about Hen I confused the two. So, yeah, that was like a year ago when this project started.
00:08:06.184 - 00:08:35.496, Speaker A: More than a year. Long may it last and I can't wait for the next twists and turns. The road is long and the world's our oyster and all that. Who knows but, but here we go. Who knows where but here we go. So anyways, Damien Hirst committing and just celebrating web3 and this is a, I've never been a massive Damien Hirst fan. I don't not like him, but, you know, you might remember the works.
00:08:35.496 - 00:09:04.210, Speaker A: Like it's very famous. The sharks that are kind of cut in half or the goats. I always think about the animals when I see that and I'm not a vegetarian, but I do, you know, that's what I think of when I see that. But this was a show that he put on which didn't get nearly as much press at Palazzo Grassi in Venice. Treasures from the wreck of the unbelievable. And you see this like this show looked very impressive to me. We'll see if some of these load up.
00:09:04.210 - 00:09:32.160, Speaker A: Here we go. So, you know, skull of a cyclops. So this show totally impressed me. Severed head of Medusa, it got mixed reviews. Maybe it's too much fun for some in the contemporary art world. Look how good this looks, right? And it seems a sphinx. And it's probably all these simulated ancient treasure troves, ancient works found at the bottom of the sea.
00:09:32.160 - 00:09:59.038, Speaker A: So a big simulation from what I could tell. So just kind of conceptually interesting and everything else. A couple more news items here. John Perkins from Superrare. In 2018, Super Rare's first year artist sold $90,000 of art, which is pretty good for 2018 if you ask me. In the past twelve months, bear Market artists sold $130 million of art. So you might want to increase your piece of the pie if you can.
00:09:59.038 - 00:10:34.782, Speaker A: I thought I saw that and I'm like, I need to have a slightly bigger piece of this pie if $130 million the last twelve months. So bullish on the next five years of exponential growth in this new creator economy. So very cool. CNN is doing the opposite though of Damien Hirst who is pulling back. They had an NFT project and Farouk from rug radio was commenting on this. CNN rugged with an official press release. They said while we will no longer be developing or maintaining this community, the vault NFT collection will live on.
00:10:34.782 - 00:10:59.330, Speaker A: Head over to our discord server for more on that. You wonder if it had to do with this yuga labs crackdown by the SEC. I mean, this came out 15 hours ago for Oaks tweets. This probably came out yesterday after the SEC. If you heard about that, it's basically charging board ape club. And thank you to Roerich for saying we don't need CNN. We have pokebelly.
00:10:59.330 - 00:11:23.964, Speaker A: So thank you for that. And we have a nice picture of Bez there and isolationist getting in on the happy Monday's action. That's who Bez is there. So all too good and all too hilarious. And just a couple of other things. Limbo is trying to get onto super rare, so give him a retweet. He submitted three pieces, or it's hard for him to submit three pieces, but he's working on it and doing some nice work.
00:11:23.964 - 00:11:52.724, Speaker A: But then a few hours later, and this is going somewhere, I got something really awesome just happened after he put out that tweet that he wants to be on super rare, going to sleep after a good working night. So let's hear what happens there. And then this other artist I saw, they got an invitation from super rare. So I'm hearing more and more of this. That super rare is giving invitations out. And you see the email here. We'd love to have you join the super rare network.
00:11:52.724 - 00:12:17.598, Speaker A: So Tan Tan neoclassicist fine art with a subculture of popular art. And also here, the isolationist, he put out his genesis. I believe it's a he. My super rare genesis is open for offers. Gratitude to Ann Laurami for the invitation. So another invitation. Okay, so.
00:12:17.598 - 00:12:45.218, Speaker A: And a cool work by isolationist here. And finally, Burka Bayram. It's priceless to see my book cover design every time I enter the bookstore. So it's awesome. People are out there and they're getting out there, and the world is smaller than you think sometimes. So very cool. So metadreams put out this collaboration with one of one neo music.
00:12:45.218 - 00:13:20.094, Speaker A: And this is kind of back to our single rebirth of the single theme. Let me see if I can get this going. And it's a cool track, right? Kind of a nice, like almost like a nineties house kind of Detroit house or something. It's really nice. So this music thing and the single, this collaboration continues to turn my head. And nice music. Now get this.
00:13:20.094 - 00:13:48.544, Speaker A: So no fungible who jnk referenced Kurt Hussle collective. Look at this. Here is a music player. So let me just stop this. So cool track still available. There's like one sold out of 15 of that meta dreams, by the way, if you want to add to your NFT music collection. So this is interesting.
00:13:48.544 - 00:14:25.362, Speaker A: Disconnect from those centralized marketplaces and collect music with a real decentralized app. I believe that's what dapp is. No owners, no fees, no sales angle, just jams. So this looks very preliminary here on GitHub, but you start to see it here right. Very preliminary, but how cool is that? Remember we were talking about NFT music players. So finally, a little bit of art here for us today, too. So Bezaya is continuing this floral, this collection here, the botanical art with some of his salsa.
00:14:25.362 - 00:14:53.774, Speaker A: So beautiful work. It sold out right away. I think it came out while I was asleep here. Mf doom, who I now know the reference. And just very interesting with the eyes here coming out of the botanical creature. And then whoever this is, which looks like also a reference to the wrestling series, a woman with a beard. So you can read all about that here.
00:14:53.774 - 00:15:25.044, Speaker A: And we also missed Buzzaya's last work as part of this series, Selva Rosa. So also a very nice work. Contemporary clothing, a pink panther or cheetah with some Louis Vuitton pattern mixed in. That is very cool. Very, very cool. Floral flow, old school tv, so just, you know, and a bit of a Rousseau kind of feel to it, right? Almost a Rousseau jungle scene reference. Let's just see here.
00:15:25.044 - 00:15:43.764, Speaker A: Botanical art with his Celsius. So. And there's actually pretty cool little write ups here. I don't go into every write up. More than 500,000 new species were discovered here, like the Leo shark or the tiger leaf. Interesting. So this is a shark.
00:15:43.764 - 00:16:06.350, Speaker A: You always have to look twice at Bzaya's work. See this? This is the Leo shark. And that, I guess, is, was it the tiger leaf? Very, very interesting. So some surrealism from Bezaya. And this was also a piece we covered here, botanic trip, the first of that series. Continuing on. We haven't hit Bolin yet.
00:16:06.350 - 00:16:32.430, Speaker A: Bolin. 132, digital collagen. Actually, we have very early on, because I remember this prescribed in oil, which I don't know what that means, but just some interesting work from Bolin. Look at that. What I like about what they do is it's usually a one of one. So that is kind of fun. And this other one that I saw on Twitter, this is an edition of ten.
00:16:32.430 - 00:16:58.394, Speaker A: Okay. And actually I saw Mikey de la creme, who I think will be at that arthropo Twitter spaces tonight. He retweeted this and this put Bolin back on the map for me. So very interesting kind of combination. Again, digital collage and some painting, again, prescribed in oil. A little ambiguous there. And here you can see just more of a taste of Bolin.
00:16:58.394 - 00:17:24.094, Speaker A: 132. Contemporary collage artist sometimes uses a stretch tool, which is kind of interesting. And continuing on, audie Wood. Audie Woody is putting out another work. So just a quick heads up on that. Always weird, but always interesting. I buy all of it, as well as Stolka, who I think is also really interesting.
00:17:24.094 - 00:17:49.288, Speaker A: I kind of categorize Stulca into this contemporary illustration because she does a lot of scenes that are kind of like. It'll be like a date. Two people, you know, talking and it's just contemporary and it's just the art of now. So I really like following Stalka Diego Barrow. A new beautiful work here with some palm trees. And I might have to pick this up. Dark sky.
00:17:49.288 - 00:18:01.588, Speaker A: Interesting. The sky is not there, but the reflection is there. Digital drawing made on Procreate Buy for two edition of five. Still available. Love how he does this at the bottom, too. That's really just. I really like that.
00:18:01.588 - 00:18:26.880, Speaker A: I mean, these little details like that to me just really help make a piece. And also Minta, you know, a portrait. The screenshot as portrait, you know, from Minta here. So just continuing to be interesting here. It's screenshot as portrait. Good morning to everyone, especially to intro voice. So continues to be interesting.
00:18:26.880 - 00:18:42.496, Speaker A: Yuri JJJ 433 cover. So that was interesting. We've looked at Yuri JJ's work before. So a reference to John Cage. This looks like a ghetto blaster. And are these dice? I'm not sure. And eat an apple.
00:18:42.496 - 00:19:20.704, Speaker A: There could be random factors. And again, this combination of pattern and kind of space and kind of ignoring space while using it at the same time, for lack of better term. Quick thing on 433. I was looking at this just to see if there's anything interesting. And you know what the most interesting thing I thought about this? I was looking at John Cage, who is the guy who did 433, who we mentioned before, which was just four minutes and 33 seconds of the orchestra doing nothing. And the work is the sound of the audience. We've talked about this before, very famous work using chance.
00:19:20.704 - 00:19:49.624, Speaker A: You know what I found interesting about the Wikipedia article is? They mentioned 433 as the second paragraph. Like it probably. I think it's unquestionably. It's the thing he's most known for. Four minutes and 33 seconds. A 1952 composition which is performed in the absence of deliberate sound. The composition is not four minutes and 33 seconds of silence, as is often assumed, but rather the sounds of the environment heard by the audience during the performance.
00:19:49.624 - 00:20:28.124, Speaker A: So this was a very influential work. And it's kind of a simple idea. I mean, the problem with cage to a certain degree, is if you go and get his works at a CD at the library, I mean, chance does like it sounds like a bunch of random objects sometimes or random noises, you know, and so it's not. So I can see why 433 is his best known work. So anyways, I just thought that was really interesting how this was the second paragraph in the John Cage bio. That's how important 433 is. And again, we see 433 cover here.
00:20:28.124 - 00:20:56.770, Speaker A: One final thing, which I just kind of popped out at me. He was also famous for the prepared piano. And maybe we even have a picture of that. This is a great concept, which maybe can be used in the visual arts. And we see it here with just putting a fork or a spoon or whatever into the piano strings or like an eraser. Put whatever you want, and it just starts to change the parameters and so your music comes out different. So just interesting concept there.
00:20:56.770 - 00:21:19.196, Speaker A: Uczine, again, wearing the mask of sanity. I continue to enjoy Uczene's work and the awesome colors and just great concepts. Little tarantula on the head there. And again, looks. Looks almost traditional, but not because that looks like a hoodie. Not sure if that's a nike hoodie or not. And a work by tradscape, Harold Choppard.
00:21:19.196 - 00:21:40.994, Speaker A: So this is a new series. Animal occupation. Looks like he's using new pixel. This is like a vertical. We saw this with popple, too, who started using a vertical filter. See if this loads. You can always get original music with tradscape.
00:21:40.994 - 00:22:07.424, Speaker A: So another interesting work. Mysterious. Like, where does this come from? Right. Definitely has a surrealist feel to it. And are those flippers here? Like, that doesn't look like a traditional hand, but the head of a bird. So anyways, ten tezos edition of 20. How are they doing? Little slow on the.
00:22:07.424 - 00:22:29.180, Speaker A: On the go here. A little slow to sell for tradscape, but I'm sure they're going to sell out. They always do with him and Ed Morolla. A one of one. This was sold originally for ten, and now it's being resold immediately for 25. So you can still get it for a reasonable amount for a one of one. Trademark colors here.
00:22:29.180 - 00:22:51.464, Speaker A: And just very interesting pixel work. Again, like, he's one of those artists that, like, if Ed Marolla didn't make it, I don't know, like, nobody else would have. Like, I sort of think of, like, bjork like that. Like, if Bjork didn't make it, nobody would have made it. You know, there are artists like that, and Ed Marolla is definitely an artist like that. Here's another one. I think this is japanese here.
00:22:51.464 - 00:23:12.452, Speaker A: And just a very interesting pixel work. Kind of going with our October theme. Even have a trick or treat here. Similar colors. See, these purples are kind of tapping into something here. So very interesting. And popple making a new one bit piece here is a work in progress.
00:23:12.452 - 00:23:45.156, Speaker A: So who knows what's going on over here? Looks complicated. Almost looks like a music score. Keeping with our earlier discussion. Echo the dolphin, a new work, also by Echo, also known as Sabato. And so just interesting how he continues to explore this environmental extinction theme through Rom glitch, rom corruption using echo tides of time for sega Genesis. Here is another AI pixel work. Computer icon, chat icon.
00:23:45.156 - 00:24:17.482, Speaker A: This is by Kinek Zapta. And you see here, I think it's artificial intelligence. I could be wrong, but intelligence artificial ia I a art, because these pixels are not perfect. Okay. So I'm tempted to see this as, like, you know, AI pixel art, which I just think is interesting as a concept. I'm still working out the aesthetics and, you know, but it. I love to be.
00:24:17.482 - 00:24:57.046, Speaker A: This is an important thing. Like, I think it's important to always challenge your aesthetics. You know, people who maybe don't pay attention to a lot of art usually go with I love it or I hate it right away. And it's important to have patience and to just, like, challenge yourself. Should I like it? Maybe I'm wrong, you know, because too often I think we just make a decision, and sometimes it is clear, but too often I think we make a decision and maybe we jump the gun a little bit, and we don't give the work the time, you know? So just thoughts in passing here. This is a beautiful kind of surrealist work. This looks like AI.
00:24:57.046 - 00:25:03.598, Speaker A: This by infinite. Yay. Okay. Okay. These creepy AI fingers really need to calm down. Look at these. They are.
00:25:03.598 - 00:25:26.064, Speaker A: They sure are creepy. So very interesting. Kind of looks like Varya's work a little bit, but very different at the same time. But you're starting to see similar qualities in AI, and we're going to see that also here. Here's Olina speaking tomato. And I believe this is an AI work as well. I'm not positive.
00:25:26.064 - 00:25:44.874, Speaker A: Grab your sweet tea and delicious cookies. A bit of a surreal work. Also an AI work by Javier. Tamayo. Frosty night. So another beautiful landscape with this dark background by Javier. Really kind of excelling at that style.
00:25:44.874 - 00:25:59.094, Speaker A: Another AI work. Sweet dreams. So almost an asian theme with some just green all across. This is by one more time. And also tundra. You're starting to see similarities. This is why I put these all together.
00:25:59.094 - 00:26:26.884, Speaker A: Tundra here by motherLouisian or ML. So just another interesting word work. And also shilly Preston, monolith garden four. So just another, you know, you're starting to see similarities in the quality of the work. I mean, it's AI, so of course you are. So just interesting colors here I want to touch on, and we're getting close to the end here. Zero zero nine.
00:26:26.884 - 00:26:50.576, Speaker A: Good morning, friends. I got some great news I'm excited to share with you all. I almost wonder, is this a super rare invite? Until then, here's some morning art. So a good time to just be like, you know, retweeting Ann Loremy, you know, it's super rare. And the super rare Twitter favoriting or whatever the case is. So cool work by zero zero nine. More blobs.
00:26:50.576 - 00:27:04.474, Speaker A: You wonder if strange thing is next. This was interesting. We'll see if it loads. Stable diffusion VR. Real time immersive latent space. You hear this used more and more again, photography for the imagination. Small clips are sent from the engine to be diffused.
00:27:04.474 - 00:27:45.652, Speaker A: Once ready, they're cued back into the projection. I just looked at the visuals here, and we'll just play a little clip, but you see how this starts to just kinda get kind of wild here, right? Pretty wild kind of stuff. And so, yeah, I just thought I would highlight that for you guys. I'll let you watch the whole thing, should you be interested. Look now, fish, I mean, it just goes on and on. Pretty wild stuff from Scotty Fox TV, stable diffusion VR. And that, my friends, is your show.
00:27:45.652 - 00:27:48.964, Speaker A: Thank you for watching once again, until next time, take care.
