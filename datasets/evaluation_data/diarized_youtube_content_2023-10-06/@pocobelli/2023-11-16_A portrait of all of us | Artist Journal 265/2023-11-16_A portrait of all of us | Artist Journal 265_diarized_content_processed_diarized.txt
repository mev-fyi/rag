00:00:02.280 - 00:00:39.596, Speaker A: Stop the presses. The sun has come out in Berlin, and that, my friends, is something new that I have not seen since I landed here from the land of Scylla and Charybdis just a few days ago here on Saturday. So it is a welcome return, and it is a welcome return to have you back here, dear viewer and everybody who attended the spaces yesterday. Artist journal, November 16, 2023, broadcasting from the ship in my mind in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokabelli. And look at this. Look at this powerful work by Sabato.
00:00:39.596 - 00:01:15.440, Speaker A: Always the thoughtful artist, and quite a powerful, poetic, you know, rendition of our situation here as gazers on the global news media narrative. Right. And incorporating it basically, directly in the work. I believe Sabato said the footage is AFP and Al Jazeera. Interesting mix. So. And here I thought it was quite interesting, too.
00:01:15.440 - 00:01:44.274, Speaker A: I mean, it looks clearly like a deluxe four painting and or a deluxe four painting. You know, we're deep in the digital. When I'm calling like a work like this a painting, you know, that's how far deep we are in this digital world here, which I think is totally awesome, actually. I love referring to these as paintings because in a sense, it basically is a painting with a new medium, or, you know, quote unquote new medium with a digital medium. Right. Painting with a digital medium. There's the title of our show today.
00:01:44.274 - 00:02:43.714, Speaker A: Perhaps we'll see where it goes. It's always a surprise. So here, just looking at the setting, and again, it's almost got, like this kind of echoes that work that Sabato did of his girlfriend, I think, in bed. And here it seems like, you know, a lot of people these days probably have their laptop because I remember there's, I think, the woman with her laptop in bed, if I'm not mistaken. And here we are kind of, again, you know, kind of a portrait of so many people, you know, watching the news on their laptop. And here, kind of beautifully rendered, I thought, quite poetically and quite subtly in the sense that a lot of Sabato's drawing exercises have movement. And I think it was likely purposeful that all the movement, what you might call the focal point, is really this, you know, sampled news.
00:02:43.714 - 00:03:29.864, Speaker A: And it is sampled and even treated a little bit, I think a tiny bit, just maybe it's just transformed into this laptop here and even kind of, you know, somewhat, you know, I would say almost somewhat, a little bit roughly done, but in a nice way, a loosely done, as my friend always corrects me. And the hair is beautiful. I might add. And even this kind of what looks like maybe a wood paneling kind of thing and everything. And even this, you know, is this sunset in the background and even the kind of like the radiator heater and there's the watermelon, hilariously. And I don't know, is that monster drink? I don't know, the pillows. There's even a touch of a manet feel as I think the other boo.
00:03:29.864 - 00:04:00.492, Speaker A: A portrait of boo, I think, is the wor. If you haven't seen that work, it is. It is tempting to call that one a masterpiece. This is a beautiful work. And really, again, a poetic work, a work that is a picture of us, in a sense. It is a portrait of all of us in the world who are, let's say, able to pay attention to what is going on here. A beautiful, very contemporary portrait, a poetic portrait.
00:04:00.492 - 00:04:35.072, Speaker A: And interesting mixing of mediums here, too. And again, even just the pillows here, there's something really just charming. And I think, kind of careful. Finally, I think the. Not only is it just making it a focal point, I suspect. And who knows? I suspect Sabato is not kind of adding what I am tempted to call a rolling gradient here, as is often used in deluxe paint. Because perhaps that would trivialize the work a little bit, I suspect.
00:04:35.072 - 00:05:25.690, Speaker A: Again, Sabato is a very, you know, one of my favorite artists in this scene because it's so well thought out, so many of his works from concept to completion. And so it wouldn't surprise me if the reason we don't have movement is, first, it's the focal point, but also, maybe it would trivialize the painting a little bit to put this kind of retrogradient spinning through. And then would it trivialize the work a little bit? So I think a pretty interesting, intelligent decision here with war as the subject matter, as per usual here. So kind of an interesting situation. I didn't see it. I think it came out like, when did this come out? Came out November 13. It's November 16.
00:05:25.690 - 00:05:52.596, Speaker A: So this came out on Tuesday, I guess, at 1030. So we haven't had a show since. But I never saw it on object, which is interesting. I wonder if there's an issue loading up new tea files. Because, you see, here's sabatos created, and I suspect that's a new one, for whatever reason, doesn't show up on the object. Maybe there's a setting you can put in tea to prevent that. I don't know, but I had to go to Teia to track it down.
00:05:52.596 - 00:06:08.268, Speaker A: There are still quite a few left, which is. And I think that's the reason why there are 14 tezos each. Interesting title, the viewer. Great title. And this is also a very interesting touch here. Mg zero. Three marginalia.
00:06:08.268 - 00:06:29.310, Speaker A: Okay, so this is part of the marginalia series. And if I could just click on that. So here's the marginalia series. Right. And this to final, you know, to tie the bow on this. I believe this series had kind of a depression kind of theme to it. Kind of a depressive kind of works.
00:06:29.310 - 00:06:48.266, Speaker A: And hence the blue perhaps, if I have that right. So interesting part of the marginalia collection. Sabato. And I follow Sabato. That is a x glitch. I think it's okay for artists to reflect on the times they are living in. Because we are human, after all, as the poet says.
00:06:48.266 - 00:07:13.756, Speaker A: I wonder which poet that is. Maybe with the a there, I would assume maybe a Latin american. So I made a new drawing, an attempt to process the times, the viewer. So very. You know, and you got to applaud, at least I do. The ambition of trying to do this. You could argue.
00:07:13.756 - 00:07:54.614, Speaker A: I mean, it's very important. People make art for different reasons. One could argue one of the reasons to make art, and maybe one of the most important reasons is to basically give a reflection of the time to process the times, you know, and to deal with the world, you know, to quote Ballard, the world we live in. So, you know, and that's kind of what this is. And it kind of does give, like a bit of a Ballard echo with this kind of media reel, you know, cycling through, you know, this Gif cycle, movie cycle in this gif. And I think it's a gif. Let's just quickly look.
00:07:54.614 - 00:08:12.688, Speaker A: If this is an mp4, it is a gif. Like, how cool. How cool, you know, again, not to trivialize the subject matter here. How cool is that? Wow. Right? So very cool here from Sabato. Again, find it on Teia. It is 14 tezos.
00:08:12.688 - 00:08:24.584, Speaker A: There are still a few left. And just to. I kind of like this. I thought, you know, we didn't return to this last episode. And I looked it up. I was like, is it. It is Charybdis.
00:08:24.584 - 00:08:43.396, Speaker A: Scylla and Charybdis. And for those that may not be familiar, those are the two sea monsters. And they're in, I believe it's in the Odyssey. And it's actually in the Aeneid. They don't mention the Aeneid here. The myth in its proverbial use. I was actually very surprised.
00:08:43.396 - 00:09:35.664, Speaker A: I didn't see the aeneas here, or the aeneid, which is the roman, basically epic. So many of you have read the Odyssey and the Iliad. The Iliad, of course, comes first about the trojan war. And the odyssey is the return back to the homeland that takes ten years after the end of the trojan war. And along the way they run into Scylla and Charybdis, where mythical sea monsters noted by Homer, greek mythology cited them on opposite sides of the Strait of Messina, between Sicily and Calabria. And what was so interesting about that? Remember that scene I was showing you at the back? I think it was the last time we started with Sabato, which was only like a week and a half ago, maybe two weeks ago. I don't know how long it's been since I was in Tieramina.
00:09:35.664 - 00:10:13.828, Speaker A: Maybe it was two or three weeks ago. In the background was actually the edge, whereas Messina, you would probably see in the distance. And then on the other side was the toe of Italy, and that was Calabria. And it was there that Scylla and Charybdis were thought to be in greek mythology. So just so you know, Scylla was rationalized as a rock shoal described as a six headed monster on the calabrian side of the strait. So on the italian side, where the toe is. And Charybdis was a whirlpool off the coast of Sicily, right by Messina.
00:10:13.828 - 00:10:44.602, Speaker A: And again, that's the Messina strait. So a lot of people in the Odyssey were killed, taken by the six headed monster, I believe, on the way. A very dramatic episode, very quick thing on the Aeneid. Many people read the Odyssey and the Iliad. Not many people read the Aeneid. And if you haven't, I would highly recommend it. It is, I would argue in a certain respect.
00:10:44.602 - 00:11:18.666, Speaker A: I mean, they have their different qualities, but you really will understand. Basically, what I would argue is ancient Rome, ancient roman aesthetic and poetry, however you want to call that at its finest, at its most dramatic. And you don't need to go far into that book. I think it's book two. Like chapter two, basically. In the Aeneid, I think, was the fall of Troy. And that is not in the Iliad or the odyssey.
00:11:18.666 - 00:11:48.294, Speaker A: So I'm going too long here. But all to say, if you haven't read the Aeneid, do yourself a favor, Virgil. Virgil's Aeneid, find a nice translation and it's well worth your while. And it's sort of a staple. Final point on this. And part of the reason I'm bringing this up here, you know, I remember english literature class. I did a masters in English after I did, you know, a double degree in art, visual arts and English.
00:11:48.294 - 00:12:39.962, Speaker A: And I remember in undergrad doing an english class. And the teacher, Peter Stoichev, the professor who later actually became my advisor or supervisor, and he's actually president of the University of Saskatchewan right now, which is wonderful. He had this great sort of thing which I took away with me, which is basically, if you're going to be, say, for example, an english literature scholar, there are certain works you have to know. And he was basically saying, you got to know your Bible, and it's not like you need to know it inside out, but you basically need to have a pretty good idea of what's going on. Let's say, in the book of Genesis and the New Testament and maybe some of the more famous stories. Say, in the Bible, you got to know your odyssey and Iliad, you got to know your Shakespeare. You could argue to a certain degree, even a little bit of Sherlock Holmes, you probably.
00:12:39.962 - 00:13:17.724, Speaker A: And, you know, but he didn't go that far. You know, you probably got to know your Edgar Allan Poe. Like, there are certain. You got to know your Jane Austen, but he was sort of saying the big stuff, you know? And that always sort of stuck with me. I was like, okay, like. And the final takeaway here is, if you. The argument could be made that if you want to play the very big game of the art game, so to speak, across the millennia, there are certain works that you need to know in order to play that game, or at least be seen as a credible player in that game.
00:13:17.724 - 00:14:12.596, Speaker A: And it doesn't mean you have to and all that. But actually, if you want to play the grand game, I would argue, and I think the argument can be made, and I'm fairly sympathetic to that argument. And so this is why I quite happily bring up, say, Heraclitus and Psyllan Charybdis here. And I hope to continue doing that, actually, because I think it gives us credibility here, all of us, as we continue our discussion here with the latest and greatest art coming out across the planet in this revolutionary blockchain seen here. I mean, it is quite revolutionary what's going on here when you zoom out. So, finally, in the Aeneid, the Trojans are warned by Helenus of Scylla and Charybdis, and are advised to avoid them by sailing around Cape Passero rather than risk the strait. Later, however, they find themselves passing Etna.
00:14:12.596 - 00:14:35.984, Speaker A: And Etna is, you see it right there, Mount Etna. And here is the strait of Messina. So they tried to go around, but then they still got caught by. By who? Is it Scylla or Charybdis, who is on the edge of Sicily here, the whirlpool. And have to row for their lives to escape. So just a little bit there. Taormina is also right by Etna here.
00:14:35.984 - 00:14:56.500, Speaker A: And you can fly into Catania really easily here. If you can see that. Let me see if I can make that bigger. Yeah, so Catania is about here. Syracuse is here. You can see it actually right there. And there is Etna, which is, I think, the biggest active volcano in Europe.
00:14:56.500 - 00:15:09.844, Speaker A: And here is Messina, the city of Messina. And this is the Messina Strait. So of course, this is Calabria. Taormina is a must see. I had no idea. I guess white Lotus was filmed there. So a little bit of classics to get us started here.
00:15:09.844 - 00:15:20.116, Speaker A: Very fun. And continuing on. What a show yesterday. Thank you, everybody, for attending here. Nice turnout. It was like an all star. You could have had that.
00:15:20.116 - 00:15:51.666, Speaker A: The whole audience was so many stars, really, from this scene here. And of course, Lorna Mills, a fantastic discussion. There was so much reality. I think Rosatio was saying, put out a comment about how interesting the show was. And I was thinking to myself this morning, I wrote in a comment, you know, it's like Lorna Mills is the real deal. Like, this is someone who wanted to be an artist from six. From six years old, which I can relate to, actually.
00:15:51.666 - 00:16:21.944, Speaker A: It was something just like. It's just like they're, you know, and by eight, wanting to be famous and, well, you know. And there is just so much honesty and reality in that space. If you haven't heard it, I highly recommend it. Again, it's real world, you know, hard won experience insights. Real world insights from hard won experience is what I think I wrote in answer to Rosatio's comment there. And that was it.
00:16:21.944 - 00:16:46.080, Speaker A: So thrilling space there with Lorna Mills. She probably will come back in the new year, she said she would. So that is exciting to discuss. We only got to the robot painting at the end and she wanted to delay till next time. Till next episode, because there's so much to unpack there. So something to look forward to in the coming months. Quick comments here.
00:16:46.080 - 00:17:04.544, Speaker A: Mumble boy. Thank you, Adrian, for showing my work. We're going to show a few more mumble boy today. I really love that you thought of temble mismiz mo s h I t when you saw the piece, as he is my favorite tezos artist. Very interesting. And yeah, big hat. Tip to hastrubal waffle, who brought it to my attention.
00:17:04.544 - 00:17:33.228, Speaker A: So hasdrubal with a very interesting, good eye on the scene there too, and just sophisticated sense of what is actually going on out there. I've learned a ton from hasdrubal waffles, from hasdrubal waffle and who led me to curio Fringe. And we have a few works here on the curio fringe from the curio french feed. Just checking in again. Always interesting there. So thank you, mumble boy. Dan.
00:17:33.228 - 00:17:46.156, Speaker A: Anthony Kelly lurking for a while now. Absolutely loving all the art talk. Well, welcome home. Welcome home. Figured I would comment and just mention how much I dig the show. Awesome. Thank you Dan.
00:17:46.156 - 00:18:12.350, Speaker A: That is a wonderful comment. And again, welcome home skammer. Great to see you visit output volume again and or being prolific at the beginning of the show since it's something I think about all the time. There's a quote someone said once, I don't remember who, if you're super lucky and super talented, you get one work that lasts forever that everyone knows. For example, the Mona Lisa. I don't completely agree with the sentiment, but it was instructive to me. All of your bad works will be forgotten.
00:18:12.350 - 00:18:56.014, Speaker A: Even some really great works will probably be forgotten. Your goal is to make something that everyone remembers. And so why not roll the dice on a masterpiece as many times as you can? And I think that is actually exactly, once again, Skomra, exactly on point here. You are basically rolling the dice every time and you're working with, you're working with randomness. When you work a lot, I would argue. And so the more you just don't know what's going to come out, you're still the same talented person. But sometimes things just work out, right? So why not roll the dice on a masterpiece as many times as you can? Wise words.
00:18:56.014 - 00:19:23.264, Speaker A: Now say we roll that back some and say the concept of a masterpiece might not be our goal as an artist, maybe my main goal is to make work that touches the viewer emotionally or intellectually or financially. Haha. Just kidding. And this also, people make art for different reasons. So again, a very sort of insightful commentary here. In my opinion, the more work you make, the more likely you are to connect with the viewer. For me, those connections are the reason I'm making the work.
00:19:23.264 - 00:20:17.118, Speaker A: So increasing output just increases the chances we have at making connections. I'm the creator and there will be an owner, but the important person in the equation is the viewer. You know, bringing us to, interestingly, to our opening work here by Sabato called the viewer, and maybe that's a pretty interesting title. When we think of a viewer of a work of art, the observer here, it kind of adds another layer of meaning, too, because of Sabato's work, to a certain degree, the viewer doesn't care about how many works you made. They care about this one work that is resonating with them. This is a very good point, too. Like, if you're making shockingly good works, I don't know, as long as they're not, like, 30 a day, where people start to get suspicious, because who can? Then there probably is something that's too easy.
00:20:17.118 - 00:20:56.990, Speaker A: But if you're making a great work a day or every two or three days, then you're on Picasso's schedule. So happy to see you. Discuss no hygiene on this show. Who had the very edgy, again, historuba waffle put out the tweet, and I was like, I've been looking at no hygiene for weeks here, trying to figure it out. Hastruba waffle put out the tweet about a week or two ago, saying, you know, something's going on here with no hygiene. And I was like, you know, and no hygiene has also been very consistent with this kind of experimental, which builds credibility. So for me, on my personal journey of kind of crafting this show together, I go, okay.
00:20:56.990 - 00:21:15.898, Speaker A: This person, like, for me, it's like, okay. Like, it's kind of earned the spot in my little journal here. I've been enjoying collecting the works, and I have quite a few. Yeah, and they're fairly reasonably priced. The Alaniscore video game and pixels are irresistible to me on a gut level. Great show. I watched it twice.
00:21:15.898 - 00:21:30.734, Speaker A: Thanks for showing my work. Thank you. It was a great response on the last show, too. I think we were at 14 or 14,000 views the last I looked. That was a fabulous. So thank you, everybody, for the support and scammer for the comment. Hugo, how are we doing here? We got to speed up.
00:21:30.734 - 00:21:46.582, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment on my artwork. Oh, so this is Ugo. We like to joke as Ugo 42. Thanks for the comment on my artwork. The name of the little guy and I actually woke up in the middle of the night, and I was like, it's Clippy. And then you had this comment. Maybe this came.
00:21:46.582 - 00:22:00.194, Speaker A: I didn't see the comment, though. The little guy from Microsoft is called Clippy. Anna Young, an intrusive clippy, was kicked out in 2007. Jeez, that's almost 20 years ago. 15 years ago. This is a tribute to him. Awesome.
00:22:00.194 - 00:22:16.794, Speaker A: Thank you. Ugo 42 rada. Love the selections, Adrian. Gonna have to watch it again and do some shopping. Well, music to my ears, Rada. And I'm just so thrilled to hear from Rada every time and again. Rada putting out that super cool drop.
00:22:16.794 - 00:22:44.754, Speaker A: Physical digital playing with the mechanics there. Super cool. Rune tune. This is super interesting as well. On the topic of crap editing art matter, as you may recall from our spaces, this is Rune tune. And with them they made it very clear that they are not simply a fabricator for an artist's work, but rather a collaborator. So your analogy to adobe tools used by artists isn't quite accurate, because in that example, artists are using tools created by a company to produce work.
00:22:44.754 - 00:23:44.314, Speaker A: I would still say like, I would still. I'm not sure it's so different though, because I think you could argue that art matter is this exact definition, that artists are using those tools created by that company to produce work. Now, I don't know the extent of the collaboration, though. So with art matter, it is a process of trial and error here, and rune tune is explaining it here is a process of trial and error, communication, fabrication, reduce, repeat. As someone who has not had the opportunity to work with art matter, though, I would love to me as well, by the way, I can't speak from experience how involved this collaboration is, but to your point, I think what really needs to be brought into question when crediting art matter is the level of involvement between them and the artist. And you know what? Maybe the happy medium of this is, at least for me, the simple solution is painting credit goes to the artist and art matter. And I'd even be tempted to put the artist first.
00:23:44.314 - 00:24:02.334, Speaker A: And then it's sort of like that is the credit, and that is the most accurate. I can't think of a more accurate way of presenting the credit. Right, because the composition is the artists. You know, the impetus of the work is the artists. Art matter is still doing its thing. So. Sure.
00:24:02.334 - 00:24:20.870, Speaker A: But I think both deserve a credit on the paintings, is my take. Thank you for the thoughtful comment, and thanks for the mention. So I think this is Evelyn. You're welcome, Evelyn and Rada. Yankee first again. Absolutely. High five, Leonidas.
00:24:20.870 - 00:24:48.762, Speaker A: In the past 24 hours. So we've been following this ordinals developing story here. In the past 24 hours in the ordinal space, nodemonkeys announced it will be a free mint. So this is coming down to, okay, let's say you start making stuff on ordinals. How should you do it? So node monkeys are a free mint. Again, these are like PFP type projects. I think BTC ordinal announced a 10,000 supply collection, 100% on uncommon sats.
00:24:48.762 - 00:25:27.750, Speaker A: And what I think uncommon sats means is they're minted. When, you know, I was thinking to myself, I probably lost out on millions of dollars, or at least a million dollars, probably by not minting the peloponnesian war and spending. I don't have that money. But if I had $200,000 or however much it would have cost to mint it and kept 50 for me, they'd probably be like, 50 bitcoin, who knows? Who knows? Supply collection of 100% on uncommon sets are rarer sats. And the guy I was working with, he was like, yeah, I think I got some really rare sats. So that's life. Though unchained monkey hinted they will migrate to bitcoin by the end of the month.
00:25:27.750 - 00:26:01.778, Speaker A: So someone else is migrating. And Ninja alert said they are targeting the end of the year for inscribing their ninjas collection. Quadrillion art hits secondary, and a fourth person got a taproot wizards tattoo. The floodgates of high quality bitcoin collections are about to open. So I keep saying this, and when I was approached in August, what I was told is there's not enough, like, art on bitcoin, or at least like, you know, art in the sense that we're talking about it. So again, opportunity knocks. And if people have other examples, that was what I was told.
00:26:01.778 - 00:26:17.334, Speaker A: And so I'm just sort of saying, you know, opportunity knocks. There still, I say to myself more than anybody, this is super interesting too. L two s are not congested and often, fifty cents to swap. Solana is still cheaper. $1.52 to swap on Polygon. So.
00:26:17.334 - 00:27:03.698, Speaker A: And is that the ZK roll up version of Polygon? $1.52. So now what this means for those that don't know. So Solana has had a massive run. It's gone up from basically, let's say, $20 and it's around 60, $65 now. And meanwhile, ETH is up, these l two s are up, but nothing has really overtaken, like, nothing has performed like Solana. And this tweet, I think, maybe gives us insight into what's going on, which is, although Solana is centralized, it delivers very fast and very, very, very cheap transactions. And it is kind of back to this idea.
00:27:03.698 - 00:27:27.106, Speaker A: Like, is Polygon really going to be mainstream adoption when it costs $1.51 us to make a transaction? Even. Fifty cents. Twenty cents. So if Solana is at $0.01 or less. And again, I keep saying Polkadot.
00:27:27.106 - 00:27:59.874, Speaker A: You know, there's an obscure interview out there where Gavin Wood is basically saying we can make it feel less. We can even erase the whole wallet thing. So if that happens, you know, so it's just very interesting. Like, are we starting to see a little bit of stress here? So just in relative strength, as the financial people would say. So just kind of interesting. Zach from Zora and huge shout out to Zach. I'm on the homepage there.
00:27:59.874 - 00:28:20.854, Speaker A: Huge arzora update for all of you prolific folks out there. Batch update. Upload is real and live, so you can put many works at once. This is a great moment to bring larger sections of your archive on chain work in a broad series or just generally mint a bunch of things at once. Pair this with the mint, all. So here it is. You can mint.
00:28:20.854 - 00:28:45.692, Speaker A: See this? Upload imagination. I think that's a brilliant catchphrase or slogan. Upload imagination. I mean, that's worthy of a major of McDonald's as far as I'm concerned, or coke. Upload imagination. I mean, that's brilliant. So anyway, here it is, and big shout out to Zach and the people at Zora who are keeping it very interesting.
00:28:45.692 - 00:29:29.178, Speaker A: Robnis, I thought this was an interesting comment. The same old arch cabals are forming again, and it's boring as f edit. Maybe it's just the same old stupid human condition and it's just biological. No matter how intelligent we think we are. It is interesting. I think the good news, say, in this decentralized or on this Internet world is, I think because the gates are, especially with foundation object, because they're open platforms. Zora, which I never mentioned last time, because they're open platforms that are credible, where you can sell your art and not feel like, you know, again, walk makes eBay work for him.
00:29:29.178 - 00:30:07.784, Speaker A: But it's a tricky area. Like most people, if they were to put their work on eBay, I'm not sure it would, you know, a contemporary gallery might say to me, like, what are you doing putting your work on eBay now? Walk, it's part of the manifesto, and it actually is quite smart. It makes me take his work quite seriously on eBay and go, oh, maybe I should go in. But all to say, I think this is interesting, but I have a feeling they're not going to be, they're going to be more disruptible, is sort of my take. You could argue the show to a certain degree is kind of an example of that. I mean, nobody was asking for me to give my opinions on anything. And it's still a small show, as you'll see from the YouTube views, but it is kind of encroaching a little bit.
00:30:07.784 - 00:30:35.444, Speaker A: So I'll just say interesting comment, though, and something to watch out for, something to be vigilant on. So interesting comment. And speaking of old art cabals, Jerry Saltz. And I thought this was interesting. Of course, Jerry Saltz, the most prominent, you know, I guess you'd call him an art critic in the world. I think we could argue the most famous name, at least. I don't know if he's the most respected, but he's the most famous for sure.
00:30:35.444 - 00:31:00.124, Speaker A: And another kind of trashing here, it's a weird pattern, and again, kind of echoes this art cabal sort of mentality. Rafiq Anadal's mind numbing, multi million dollar spectacle is a house of cards and a hall of mirrors. Momentary, diverting gimmick, art. Take away the music, and it's just a banal screensaver. Cool by me. So he's saying it's gimmick. Gimmickry novelty.
00:31:00.124 - 00:31:31.018, Speaker A: A screensaver. And what I thought was kind of weird about this was Rafiq Anadal just arrived in Milan to give a masterclass at photo Vogue our metamorphosis. So here he's just kind of, you know, artists struggle to do their work, to be known, you know, to climb up, you know, at least. And I may even be sympathetic to Jerry Saltz's interpretation. I think there's something to be said. You know, maybe it kind of does look like a screensaver. Fair enough.
00:31:31.018 - 00:32:08.986, Speaker A: But I just find, like, what is this helping? Like, how are you? Like, what is. This is kind of my takeaway here. Uh, this person's just kind of. This person's not attacking anybody, just kind of celebrating their art. You don't have to love it, but do you need to try? Especially from the position that Jerry Saltz is in, do you have to attack it? I just find it bizarre. Like, he probably justifies it to himself as I am protecting what, you know, what we consider good taste is probably how Jerry Saltz rationalizes it to himself. But really, yeah, I'm not buying it.
00:32:08.986 - 00:32:21.328, Speaker A: I'm not buying it. And I think it's just kind of. I just think it's in. It's bad form. And I think it shows is actually what I would say. I think it's just bad form to start. It's different if it's solicited.
00:32:21.328 - 00:32:42.844, Speaker A: Like, we had this discussion the last time Jerry Saltz did it. It's different if the opinions are solicited. It's different if you're in a class and you're paying someone to help you get better. Okay, you're soliciting feedback, but even then, you don't need to insult it. You can still be kind of, you know, fairly neutral in your assessment. Right. In your language.
00:32:42.844 - 00:33:06.098, Speaker A: So just interesting. That wasn't a one off. That's why I'm showing that that last one wasn't a one off. So here it is again. And these are just the ones that I see. Lxtxcx GM, an art teacher, suggested, rather condescendingly, that I should focus on one style if I want to succeed in the art world. So we've been having this discussion again, the Richard Prince discussion.
00:33:06.098 - 00:33:41.944, Speaker A: The art world wants to put you into a box, or the body of my work would look unfocused. And so today, I couldn't be happier doing all kinds of art without being bound by the consequences. Interesting, right? And I think ultimately you have to follow yourself. I mean, I think the important thing is if you do a lot of things, that's fine. I do a lot of things kind of proudly. To me, it shows range as long as you're kind of consistent with those works and you kind of keep coming back. I mean, Lorna Mills yesterday was saying how she's going back to, like, works and ideas that she had ten or 15 years ago.
00:33:41.944 - 00:34:05.690, Speaker A: And, like, the. And I totally relate to that. I mean, the promoted stories series, I've been struggling with that since 2016, and I feel like only the latest rendition is actually a rendition that works for me that I actually really like. So it's interesting. Just. Yeah, it's another interesting discussion. This is also interesting from guandanarian, speaking of art school.
00:34:05.690 - 00:34:52.564, Speaker A: Art school costs 60,000 pounds a year. That is insane, isn't it? Aseprite costs $20, so isn't that interesting? And I think it speaks to this scene. And again, it's kind of back to Robnis's comment. I think the cheapness or the low cost of a lot of the software here, like, you know, to echo our AI artists that we've been looking at who did the Global south series. Like, the global south is. Is getting in. And as we see here, somewhat surprisingly, not anymore, but it was when you first discover it, when I tell people, they're surprised which countries, where's everything coming from? Are there certain areas? And it's like, yeah, turkey and Argentina outperform.
00:34:52.564 - 00:35:22.976, Speaker A: So it's interesting. So anyways, I thought that was a great comment and speaks to the Times. Roop cash artists wear a lot of different hats. Making art is only one of them. There's also sales, marketing, pr, production, logistics, accounting, strategy, research, editorial, et cetera. Juggle all of those, put in a ton of work, add a bunch of luck, and you might just have an art career. So, yeah, it is an enormous undertaking, and it really is.
00:35:22.976 - 00:35:44.160, Speaker A: To succeed as an artist is quite a superhuman endeavor. Lorna Mills has done it. And oxygen. I remember putting out a similar tweet like this maybe three months ago. I mean, it's sort of a topic you'll hear every often, all of the different hats artists have to wear. It is not. It is not for people that.
00:35:44.160 - 00:36:16.938, Speaker A: It's not for the lazy, let's put it that way. I basically work constantly, and I'd love to have another 4 hours in the day to make more work. Check this out, RJ. Narcissistic tendencies for selfie. Self portraits being inscribed onto the blockchain. So remember ripcash and Spuegles was inscribing onto the blockchain. So is RJ in an act of contemporary technological egoism again, I feel like that dovetails very nicely with our discussion yesterday with Lorna Mills.
00:36:16.938 - 00:36:48.302, Speaker A: So I guess that's RJ. So a face behind the voice in the works here. And all inscribed on the blockchain. So you'll notice there is not, I'd like to know, actually, how many kilobytes, how many bytes. These works are basically two color works from what I can see here, and not even that many lines. Right. So keeping it, again, it's, as Ripkash was saying in an earlier tweet, it's an interesting challenge.
00:36:48.302 - 00:37:15.226, Speaker A: And I find it like, when you succeed at this challenge, I think it becomes elegant. This is another what I'd call elegant solution here from RJ. So inscribing on chain Spiegelsmaskinen, the desktop at Bricks gallery, some incredible detail shots. So I just wanted to show some of these, what you'd call installation shots. And I think these are all. Yeah, so here are some. And I think at the start there was one.
00:37:15.226 - 00:37:31.906, Speaker A: That vertical one is pretty cool. Let me go to the start. I think there was like a little. Yeah, I thought that was great too. The desktop. So a physical, almost sculptural sort of idea here. And then you also see here the works, how they're displayed.
00:37:31.906 - 00:37:59.622, Speaker A: So just interesting installation shots from Spiegels, Spiegels Maskinen, also Louis Pont GM so this is case art in every home. We love cycles of disintegration. Number 23 of 30 by Louis Pont using infinite objects. And I'd never noticed this before, but I guess, interesting combination. They're almost like stickers here that are on top and almost translucent. Interesting. I never noticed that.
00:37:59.622 - 00:38:31.042, Speaker A: And kind of gives another kind of layer of physicality here. It kind of reminds me, actually of Eizo writing with marker on the Polaroid, giving it that kind of final layer. It's like it kind of. Those polaroids probably need that. And you could argue this adds a lot of kind of depth and preciousness, because when you're making a physical work of art, I would argue, I think it's self evident, but maybe people disagree with me. You want it to look precious. Ultimately you're selling something for hopefully, it's probably going for thousands and thousands of dollars.
00:38:31.042 - 00:38:51.594, Speaker A: It better look precious. If it doesn't look precious, maybe there's something wrong. So this is helping the preciousness. Polygon 1993 certificate of authenticity and art. So kind of hilarious here. A minidisc. I used to actually have a lot of Goa tracks on minidisc, and I would even, like, mess around with djing with minidisc, if you can believe that.
00:38:51.594 - 00:39:22.902, Speaker A: And there looks like a Polygon 1993 work. Another takeaway from Lorna Mills. Before blockchain, people would use USB sticks to sell work oftentimes. And I asked Lorna Mills about that and she said, yeah, and you make sure there's a really nice fancy certificate of authenticity with it. So here's a certificate of authenticity with a. Some sort of physical rendition here. And this was interesting, too.
00:39:22.902 - 00:39:45.064, Speaker A: Gogulitis, who I do follow, is at the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam. Of course, we were talking about the pikachu. And I can't remember what they call these things again. Pokemon. Pokemon at van Gogh, Amsterdam. So I guess they even have like a van Gogh as Vincent as Pokemon, Pikachu, where there are more than 200 pieces. Got to catch them all.
00:39:45.064 - 00:40:12.432, Speaker A: So, having fun over there and here. No gifts today. So looks like Euxine is working, I think. I guess this is acrylic, but not absolutely sure on that. This looks like an euxine being attempted in the physical. So how interesting is that? And I suppose this is by Euxine. So pretty cool and interesting to see the translation, isn't it? So interesting work there.
00:40:12.432 - 00:40:31.804, Speaker A: And finally, pale kirill. So we've been looking at this series here. Reflections is live. Nine of 16 pieces in the Notme series are available for purchase via reserve triggered auctions. Each token comes with original 26 by 30 oil painting by the artmatter robot. See all details below. So here it is once again.
00:40:31.804 - 00:41:02.510, Speaker A: And you see the works being made here. Do you see the texture when you look up super close? Actually, the texture doesn't match up. So you see, as you see here, maybe it's a mix. Maybe it's a mix of using painting color or just doing the texture underneath. Anyway, very interesting. Here it's just white, but then you see what looks like a colored. See that? That looks like colored paint.
00:41:02.510 - 00:41:15.554, Speaker A: So maybe they do both. Not sure. A little ambiguous there. Into the work we go at the 40 1 minute mark. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I think I promised that I was gonna make these shorter last episode, so. So much for that.
00:41:15.554 - 00:41:36.816, Speaker A: In the event of my death, please bury my Takashi six ix nine ine rainbow teeth atop it's bitsy Spider Mountain much thanks. A struble waffle edition of six. Pretty rad. Nice. Like kind of a, you know, like what it looks like to me are the ghosts in Pac man. Don't they. Don't they remind you of that? Just another super cool work here.
00:41:36.816 - 00:41:56.576, Speaker A: They look effortless by hizrubal waffle. Just making it look so easy in the event of my death. Cool title. You know, another hilarious thing about the Lorna Mills thing last spoiler, if you haven't heard it yet. She gets the titles of her works from racehorses. All of them. All the titles of her works are from racehorses.
00:41:56.576 - 00:42:21.414, Speaker A: Someone asked that and there were brilliant questions. It really took a team to get all the info out. Runetune asked some great questions and people were writing in underneath the space with great questions. It was really cool. We got a really great, kind of nice overview of Lorna's process work and everything. Poltergeist. Another work by Hasdrubal waffle.
00:42:21.414 - 00:42:40.134, Speaker A: I wonder if this is n 64 demi Moore. More pop culture references and ghost in my house. And so just really, really interesting. Cool. Original artwork from Hasdrubal waffle. Once again, no clues on the software here. Poltergeist.
00:42:40.134 - 00:43:06.426, Speaker A: And again, this is new November 15. So very fun to see the Hasdrubal waffle account up and running. Ed Marolla with a beautiful, beautiful work here. What was this called again? Summer town. Great title, too. Summertown. And what looks like kind of like a european town or castle almost looks like Praha or Prague and like a architecture you'd see in Prague.
00:43:06.426 - 00:43:27.044, Speaker A: And then these beautiful, beautiful fires here and almost the heat waves being put through and almost a bit of a haunted. Bit of a feeling of Halloween here. And the ghost. And even this. This looks like Prague, actually a famous castle in Prague in the kind of downtown area. And then kind of taken out. There's a famous astrological clock.
00:43:27.044 - 00:43:39.004, Speaker A: But then, of course, it's surrounded by other buildings. So pretty interesting here. Gorgeous work here. Ed Morollo. Reserve of 0.15, minted yesterday. Look at Martin Bruck.
00:43:39.004 - 00:44:12.420, Speaker A: I think this is a brand new mint here too. Two fountains. So more interesting experimentation here. Looking like pixel art, maybe AI pixel art, not sure with combining mediums with video here. Something that I think Curio fringe does as well. And you could argue like kind of these all fit quite well with hasdrubal waffle as well. Like these kind of just, you know, jittering, you know, looks like putting these digital paintings through a video processing of a certain kind of.
00:44:12.420 - 00:44:24.924, Speaker A: Interestingly, perhaps is what's going on here. So reserve of 0.12 from Martin Brook. This is on foundation. Two fountains. So one of all of our favorites here. Techno flower.
00:44:24.924 - 00:44:47.154, Speaker A: I think I saw this. There are a few from Curio fringes feed. Again, I rated Curio Fringe's feed here. Let me see. Is there any volume on here, I think. Let's see if this plays. Otherwise it would be sad, wouldn't it? My Internet here is.
00:44:47.154 - 00:45:12.062, Speaker A: Oh, is it gonna play? You know what I'm gonna do? Let's see if I can get onto my phone here. Let's see. Because the phone offers better Internet and let's. There we go. Hopefully. There we go. I mean, pretty wild.
00:45:12.062 - 00:45:34.336, Speaker A: And this great brush, the blue. So just, I mean, you gotta love. You gotta love an artist who, if they didn't make it, nobody would make it, you know, that's sort of the impression I get from Zozo. Just a really cool artist. What is this? Three Tezos edition of 20. 519 left. Techniflower.
00:45:34.336 - 00:45:45.360, Speaker A: Cool title. Mumble boy. So mumble boy is back. I saw the light. So again, just really interesting digital collage, it looks like here. And I think some of these are older works. I'm not sure, I'm not sure.
00:45:45.360 - 00:46:14.960, Speaker A: But when I made it, the song I saw the light came to my mind, and I may have titled it that. And for some reason, son of Mister Lundgren found my post on Instagram and commented on it. So it sounds like the guy who maybe made the song. So more interesting work here from Mumble Boy, a new artist on the show here, Ani Goko. Another work here. So interesting digital collage combined with this kind of rainbow background here and everything. Just interesting work as we get to know the work of Mumble boy.
00:46:14.960 - 00:46:29.764, Speaker A: Here's one more. Show me the pudding. So I think these are older works. I think I saw a tweet that mumble boy was going to be putting out some older works, so just interesting to see what's going on. Keeping it new over here. Edition of three for only Fortezo. It's very low edition.
00:46:29.764 - 00:46:59.844, Speaker A: This was interesting too. Not sure if this came from Curio's feed or just on Twitter. 2006, the year of the Dog and this is by Olivia Paty. Art by Liv is the series. So just an interesting work here. 2006, the year of the dog and just, yeah, just interesting artists I've never seen before. And just interesting work here.
00:46:59.844 - 00:47:22.308, Speaker A: Strange and interesting reserve at 0.3. So just cool to note. Rustic digital art. Sheeps and clouds. So continuing with these programmer clouds or ascii clouds, whatever it is, the text replacing the clouds. And these quite beautiful landscapes probably done from memory, painted by rustic digital art. So a nice addition to the collection.
00:47:22.308 - 00:47:48.728, Speaker A: Sold out at, let's just see, edition of ten, sold out at six. So again, a very healthy market here, I might add. Like people are still selling out and regularly. It's pretty impressive. Old school pixelized violence stamp. So of course this is gloom tube and kind of a cool use of cool concept here. Some pixelation because you can see here it's on, looks like a YouTube feed.
00:47:48.728 - 00:48:19.824, Speaker A: Maybe the second time gloomtube has actually used that old school pixelized violence stamp. So just live leak here. And so here you see some people beating each other up. You know, I was hearing stories yesterday on the Berlin subway, or my hairdresser was telling me a couple of days ago, Berlin subway at eleven, big fight bottles being smashed on people's heads. It's getting rough out there sometimes. RJ, midnight augury. Really cool work here.
00:48:19.824 - 00:48:41.984, Speaker A: Looking like maybe it was designed for on chain and decided not to. And then adding this trademark signature RJ screensaver here on the beautiful green screen saver on the laptop here. Cool work, I might add. And even I like the margins here. The margins add a lot. Kind of lets the work breathe. Interesting piece, midnight augury.
00:48:41.984 - 00:49:06.024, Speaker A: Interesting title edition of 522 tezos each. How many are left? Let's just see one left. I mean, RJ's just like, the market is quite healthy. Like people are buying a lot of art right now. This is definitely from Curio. Fringes feed sailor Mokos, Carolina George. So not exactly sure but I thought this was pretty interesting addition of ten.
00:49:06.024 - 00:49:24.804, Speaker A: There's eight left, and it's 0.7 tez. So this is like the classic kind of really interesting artwork you're going to find on Curio Fringe's feed. So give Curio a follow. Just really super original. Interesting art. This I think I saw on Instagram.
00:49:24.804 - 00:49:36.828, Speaker A: It is on Instagram. The failed pianist. And this is a digital drawing. So interesting subject. Kind of reminds me of the failed artist a little bit. I thought it was just a nice digital painting. Interesting.
00:49:36.828 - 00:49:51.848, Speaker A: The spilled bottle of wine here and all sorts of, kind of symbolism here. And here's other work by this artist. I've never seen them before. El Chup. Julian Rapalini. I guess I was following them. Gregorio Zanardi, I think.
00:49:51.848 - 00:50:12.062, Speaker A: Previously known as Greco undefined gold. This was just released and looks like perhaps. And this looks like a, what would you call it? Cricket player with the cricket kind of stick or whatever it's called here. Not there, interestingly. And in the air. So interesting work. And the horse is smoking.
00:50:12.062 - 00:50:27.174, Speaker A: So interesting piece here. I think this is already sold out again, like, healthy, healthy market here. Three tazos each. Pretty reasonably priced. All that being said, bezaya with a new one. Unknown man. That looks like Frida and Salvador.
00:50:27.174 - 00:50:41.746, Speaker A: Interesting combination of Frida, Kalo and Salvador Dali here. With a very nice background here. Nice work by Bazaya. And this is an edition of 20. And there are five left at 15 tezos. Nice color scheme. Uri J.
00:50:41.746 - 00:50:59.054, Speaker A: Pencil exercise. Very interesting piece here. Kind of a, you know, as you can see here, almost showing, like, drawings here. And there is the pencil here. Really interesting. There's something about it that it almost has. It's almost like cider here in its texture.
00:50:59.054 - 00:51:18.222, Speaker A: Almost like there's something kind of similar here in the texture. Whatever they're doing, it could be a completely different process. I'm sure it is, obviously. But these textures are really nice and impressive, even in the drawings here in the pencil. Just a nice piece here. Edition of 37 tezos. Ten left.
00:51:18.222 - 00:51:49.540, Speaker A: And so, continuing on, look at this brand new work here by Santiago on super rare, I will consider offers. So a nice, original piece here from Santiago. Trying new things here. And I brought it up big just so people can see again. So kind of, you know, vector based kind of abstract art here. I think we could describe it as. So a huge file, as usual, kind of trademark, these massive files.
00:51:49.540 - 00:51:59.392, Speaker A: Pretty nice piece. Pretty interesting piece. Pretty original piece. Now on super rare. Look at that. Interesting patterning here. But it's like, there are no straight angles here.
00:51:59.392 - 00:52:22.614, Speaker A: Everything is curved, interestingly, like a vector. Continuing on, this is gans. And another interesting abstract here. And here you see just a ton of experimentation. Kind of lo fi pixelation here. Interesting textures, interesting work. Abstract glitch, artwork made, mixing code, custom digital paint tool, and traditional image editing software.
00:52:22.614 - 00:52:38.842, Speaker A: Buy now one of one for 35 tezos. Very interesting. And here is cider. And you see these great textures here. Untitled 2023. And so I think interesting crop, too, by the way. Looks kind of like things are getting stretched out here.
00:52:38.842 - 00:52:51.770, Speaker A: Maybe you just take a little bit and you stretch it out. And then you start to get, like, the lighter part at the end. And then you put a process on top. Very nice. I'm not sure who this is. It's probably someone famous. 37,000 views.
00:52:51.770 - 00:53:32.208, Speaker A: Cider has just a massive audience graphica with a work here log lost mind map. So another one of these pngs, I believe. And here is just another with these great, like, looks like foundation in the background here on the top and bottom, as a framing device of sorts, are really nicely kind of stretched out and dragged out. Kind of referencing the, I guess, the sails, the sales tool, for lack of a better term, or the marketplace. I think this is. Is it Rita or is it pepitas? Pamelo Cerrone actually tweeted this out. It's on Zora here.
00:53:32.208 - 00:53:45.006, Speaker A: Only three minted. Interesting piece. Vuela palucha. 3000 times Rita. So. And I think pepitas is the. I'm not sure if Rita or Pepitas is the artist.
00:53:45.006 - 00:54:07.854, Speaker A: Uh, interesting work here. Kismet kazza. And here. I wasn't quite sure who the artist is either, because it kind of looks very trademarked Tornado Rodriguez in the drawing here. But the. These almost look like NUV 1914, don't they, in the gradient? So maybe they teamed up here. It wasn't exactly clear to me because I think kismet Cazza minted everything.
00:54:07.854 - 00:54:25.256, Speaker A: So I'm not exactly sure who the artist is here. I assume tornado Rodriguez has something to do with it. It really interesting piece here, even though the little window coming down here. Gotta love it. Nuv 1914 encampos. So another one of one. Let's actually look at what it sold for.
00:54:25.256 - 00:54:43.788, Speaker A: Going for probably only ten tezos to one of one. And I think one of one is next. No, it's in maybe a couple of weeks. Next week is gonna be Michele Colonna. And so that is next week on the spaces. I should email to confirm, but it looks like everything is in the calendar. Let's put it that way.
00:54:43.788 - 00:55:14.104, Speaker A: So more interesting work here from Nev 1914. And let's keep speeding along here. There's a couple others here. Organico. Interesting, almost kind of line drawings with, again, these trademark outrageous gradients in the background here and the flowers with different kind of smiles, making it look easy to make these sort of decisions here. These are very counterintuitive decisions that NeV 1914 is making, which I think is part of the charm. Again, putting a gradient here that is not common, but quite beautiful.
00:55:14.104 - 00:55:39.604, Speaker A: Right, so a lot of counterintuitiveness here. And again, look at this gradient through the figure here. Just super interesting, right? Its counterintuitiveness is part of what makes it so great, Dansis. And this is an addition of one selling to line extension only tentezos. Nice composition. Rinifish and waterleg clap piece, deer wings. And let's see, let's see if this one plays.
00:55:39.604 - 00:56:12.784, Speaker A: Kind of looks like Winnie fish is in the middle here. Work. Very deep vibe on the music there too. Collab piece. So I guess wanner leg is probably did this work in the background here. And maybe rini did a little bit of the color on there. Not sure.
00:56:12.784 - 00:56:34.678, Speaker A: Cool collab by now for fortezos edition of 50 42 left. And continuing on, another work by rinifish using these kind of cool pixels here. Let me see if I can make that even slightly smaller here so it fits the screen. Nice piece. Hey, a nice kind of abstract in the background. Great color. This nice kind of pixel thing going on on top.
00:56:34.678 - 00:57:03.046, Speaker A: Kind of translucent pixels with even, you know, kind of coming from the edges here. Almost like a spotlight or effect of certain kind. Continuing on, tea toys 90, the sinking voice, more kind of surreal illustration here. And we see an astronaut in a head. So Tito is a pretty cool artist here. And some animation and whatever's going on here with the hand. And really carefully, nicely illustrated.
00:57:03.046 - 00:57:20.554, Speaker A: Again, very counterintuitive. A lot of these decisions here. Very cool work. Really nice here. And then the beautiful tree. And this head is actually kind of like a sculpture, almost like a ruin. And then here you have like a, I guess you'd call that a manhole or something, a sewer cover perhaps.
00:57:20.554 - 00:57:38.994, Speaker A: The sinking voice edition of ten. And let's just see what happened here. Just minted. And Caterina create joyful blossoms. You can get one, a one of one for 20 tazos here from Katarina. Create. And just another really cool, fun drawing of flower blossoms for its own joy.
00:57:38.994 - 00:58:00.574, Speaker A: Very distinct, identifiable style and palette. And just beautiful work as usual. One of one. If you don't have your Katarina create unique yet Antonio loves with a one of one. And I think this was just sent to someone. Protect the preach, protect the peach. And here again, great to see Antonio loves back.
00:58:00.574 - 00:58:29.554, Speaker A: I didn't seen some work for a while. He may have been releasing some. And so anyway, just another interesting work here. Digital illustration transferred to bullseye. So a one of one here and interesting wings again, kind of always has a bit of a, you know, there is a surrealism to it. It's almost like a category, surreal illustration. And there's always kind of oftentimes an angelic sort of theme.
00:58:29.554 - 00:58:59.614, Speaker A: Almost looks like St. George and the dragon type composition here as well, though, with the guy with the sword. So just kind of interesting. Jake Studios Tazos Hooper so having fun here. This maybe is also a portrait of all of us here working on Tazos at least. And almost like, is that like Dennis Rodman perhaps, with the pink hair and classic sort of basketball look. Tezos hoopers so at auction, one of one for only five tezos.
00:58:59.614 - 00:59:26.774, Speaker A: So that is happening. Daniel W. The dreamer so another really cool illustration here from Daniel W. Kind of haunting, a little bit and almost a bit of a clip feel on this one. Black and white. And it's got that print and that print texture and also this kind of noise, which is really beautiful, the black noise coming through the white rectangle here. And different processing, you know, the lighter black and the darker black and everything.
00:59:26.774 - 00:59:48.434, Speaker A: Mp 410 frames per second. Five Tezos edition of 25 Lewis Harriot I'm not sure if this is new or not. The arterial gardenia. This is on Instagram here. Interesting illustration here. Kind of surreal as well. And you can see others, right, so interesting artist here.
00:59:48.434 - 01:00:25.368, Speaker A: And continuing on, this is Pomelo, one of one for only 15 tezos here. Let us play that. It's always cool music too. So pretty fun. I think it's part of like a turntable series or based series. Pretty cool track, you might add. So that is Tercero that is on object or tazos ugo UFO down.
01:00:25.368 - 01:01:02.204, Speaker A: So there is a alien drop by next wave collective. So there are a few kind of alien based works that we're starting to see. Cool kind of UFO done. Treated a la ugo 42 and really like the stars too here on this one. Nice color, by the way, and one also by element Li. And who did I see tweet this out? Was it unknown collector who also is putting out some really nice, just kind of curated unknown collector, I think I saw this on. So again, element ly with very kind of experimental pixel art.
01:01:02.204 - 01:01:36.634, Speaker A: Really interesting edgy pixel artists, I think makes it on the phone, interestingly. And here's just maybe a space person seeing a cave on another planet. So fun work there. Temple Mismus, also known as Moe S h I t, sad clown robot dude. So more of these very interesting kind of figures here. And remember in the comment there, we were saying how we were seeing how one of the artists was saying, temple Mismez is one of my favorite artists on tazos, or my favorite, I believe so. Anyway, here's some of the work.
01:01:36.634 - 01:02:00.758, Speaker A: More cool work here. One of one for only 20 tazos. Sad clone clown robot dudes technical service. And again, combining these figures that we were also highlighting here the other day, interesting clouds here. Very prolific artist. And the clouds and interesting in the top left here with this kind of rainbow of sorts, or at least just multicolor stripes. And this kind of machine here almost looks like a train.
01:02:00.758 - 01:02:26.104, Speaker A: Kind of a surreal orcure technical service. And here's another one, a wizard mammic. I think we might even have one more after this. So just interesting work here as we continue to scan the blockchain here. Interesting blue background uniting them all. One of one for 15 tezos. And here's one more necromancer cat trying to think of who these remind me of, these kind of figures here, these full bodied figures.
01:02:26.104 - 01:02:50.196, Speaker A: It does echo something in my mind here. And so just another cool work. Looks like painting with the skulls here and the maybe mustache or mouth and everything. So more interesting work here from temple mismis. One of one for 15 tazos. All available. And this is consino concino with another soccer work.
01:02:50.196 - 01:03:05.664, Speaker A: You lose. So this was pretty cool. Another just, I love the soccer works. I need to mint. I hope I can still mint the Diego Maradona. The goal of the century. Again, just cool subject matter and really fun and well done.
01:03:05.664 - 01:03:29.984, Speaker A: Ultra rare and muay thai food club. So probably ultra rare. I just saw this on Instagram here. Interesting pixel artist. Not sure if they meant. Pretty interesting work here, isn't it? And here you see flowers and just interest. Another take on pixel art, isn't it? Or at least on square brushes.
01:03:29.984 - 01:03:45.790, Speaker A: I think we could call this pixel art, but maybe it starts to ride the edge a little bit. But I think it still be. Yeah, interesting question. Feel free to weigh in. And this is, is violet trip. And one bit by violet trip. So pretty cool.
01:03:45.790 - 01:04:10.994, Speaker A: Let's see if there's volume on that. Oh, there is. The volume almost makes it too. Let's see. Pretty cool. This is on sealed art. Remember that? Let me see if I can.
01:04:10.994 - 01:04:31.442, Speaker A: Not sure if I knew how to stop that. Yes, sealed art. Remember we saw Quiro's work on sealed art. Gasless bidding. Not exactly sure beyond that what's going on there, but another work there, Jacques Renaissance. So just more kind of interesting crypto art here from Jacques Disclosure. Nice kind of light purple here.
01:04:31.442 - 01:04:51.312, Speaker A: And the black, kind of nicely done. And love the big pixels. Cool title, cool subject, cool composition. And there is Internet explorer at the top of the column here. Really treated and kind of like with its own kind of filter there, seemingly. And maybe that's also done up here and skulls. Looks like crypto art.
01:04:51.312 - 01:05:22.932, Speaker A: And here, of course, is Mech TXT, a friendly visitor. Sold for 759 ETH. So great sale here because, of course, ETH is at, let's say, $2,000. We're talking like $1,600 here. So nice sale here for Mec TXT with this very kind of pretty monochromatic work here with. And here you have the skull, what looks like maybe smoking a cigar, or maybe there's just like, this kind of luminescent thing, and then it's. Who knows? And then the c in the background.
01:05:22.932 - 01:05:38.818, Speaker A: Nice animation on foundation. Really working it across blockchains here, too. A friendly visitor. Cool title here, as we need to. We're already at an hour five. We got to run through the rest of this episode. Kappn, who I do follow, evaporate.
01:05:38.818 - 01:05:56.406, Speaker A: Just another cool work here from Kappen. Just putting it on Twitter Muji, with a couple of works that are the same, but with different colors. Overhang tower. So here is one, and here is the other. Overhang tower, v two. And let's just look at the. Oh, so maybe that first one was burnt.
01:05:56.406 - 01:06:12.470, Speaker A: So this one was burned. So there's actually probably only one. I think we can go very, very quickly here, but we got to run. Yeah, so there's only one that is officially released. Okay, so only one version. This is the burned one. And this is Opia.
01:06:12.470 - 01:06:32.574, Speaker A: Alone in the shadows, looking like using some sort of text, kind of filter here, or character filter. A nice piece. And you gotta love up here, the formula in the window, in the old Mac window. That's kind of fun. Alone in the shadows. Opia, 30 tezos, one of one tired pixels. Armilk, 88 tired pixels.
01:06:32.574 - 01:06:59.284, Speaker A: Number 63. Again, looking like using perhaps a few different, using ASCII, using maybe some kind of pixel. Interesting combination of elements here and cool frame as well. So Armilk, back at it. 25 tezos edition of ten. This is sold out, so that's on secondary and sold out at eight tezos each. Nice for Armilk myu with the pixel artwork.
01:06:59.284 - 01:07:18.484, Speaker A: Tales of the wandering samurai. Classic colors here from Mayu. Very cool frame here as well. So nice work. And I love the black and white sword, actually, with everything else being colored. 370 on secondary edition of 45. Maybe that's primary.
01:07:18.484 - 01:07:56.780, Speaker A: Marcel Muncianu this is an edition of 30 C 30. Just kind of a semi abstract, I guess, and just almost what I call the sketchbook style. Just kind of combining a bunch of different stuff with no real kind of sense of space, although there's a little bit of space here. Just interesting pixel artwork from Marcel Munciano and Silva sand twos with a really kind of nice effect here. Another glitch, Rom, kind of, you know, scaling down or upwards, I guess, with the angels here and. But not sure if you. Sometimes you feel like you're going up, sometimes it feels like you're going down.
01:07:56.780 - 01:08:14.400, Speaker A: And this maybe is hell. So kind of an interesting take on the last judgment here. Fallen. Great title, Snes. And that must be the game here. Open edition for 666. Renki Higashi Okayama.
01:08:14.400 - 01:08:38.700, Speaker A: And here is just another interesting work. Animated abstract by Renki. And of course, edition of ten, and probably none listed yet. Human boy with work here too, which kind of fit nicely. And so a nice animated abstract from human boy on X. And here's another one that could hang right beside it. This is by Datura Katok.
01:08:38.700 - 01:08:52.108, Speaker A: Pretty cool, very fast. Kind of jittery work here by Datura. And here's another one. Kazuhiro Eheira. And let's look at the speed here. This one. This is unusual, how the speed changes.
01:08:52.108 - 01:09:01.527, Speaker A: I'm not sure if that's my computer. I don't think so. I think that's the work. So interesting piece here. Kind of different textures. Very interesting. Animated abstract.
01:09:01.527 - 01:09:29.828, Speaker A: Kazuhiro eheira is a very interesting experimental artist. Edgy, always experimenting and not afraid to take chances. Aesthetically, this trash love is the work. And the creator is Mister VlD's ed. Fun work here. This is on zero one, so zero one is still happening. I love those big pixels.
01:09:29.828 - 01:09:56.978, Speaker A: And it all works because it contrasts with this almost photographic totter, totter, totter. Pretty hilarious music there too. In companion music. Elby wave two. So another really cool kind of animated abstract textured work from Elby. Really nice pieces coming out there. Edition of five for five tezos and two left.
01:09:56.978 - 01:10:11.002, Speaker A: Things are selling. Here's Kurt hustle. Collective taspo color metric analysis. And I think this is just music. I don't think there's any video here. Be the first to mint one day. Mint.
01:10:11.002 - 01:10:26.634, Speaker A: Wow. I'm gonna mint this. I shouldn't have showed this. Wow. What if. What if you're the only person to mint it? So very cool. From Kurt hustle collective.
01:10:26.634 - 01:10:55.894, Speaker A: Keep that window open. Selwaki. Let's bring up here and now. So always a bit of humor in everything with salawaki kind of video. Let's take a look. And here is the decision I think it was talking about face the world. Stay here as long as you like.
01:10:55.894 - 01:11:11.084, Speaker A: Almost like an Ed Russia sort of feel to it with the text on top. And let's just go to the question, are you ready to face the world? Yes. No? Okay, beautiful. So. And you don't have to. Salawaki, five Tezos edition of 20. And there are ten left.
01:11:11.084 - 01:11:27.284, Speaker A: Get it? Well, you can. Kota Nakazono, continuum number 171. So another continuing the continuums and across chains here. And so cool circuit board on this one. Nice. So keeping it interesting. Almost look like contact lens over here.
01:11:27.284 - 01:11:39.076, Speaker A: 29.99. So doing these low editions and selling out. Let's just see what the mint price are. 15 tazos. So nice work from Koda. This is from Curio. Fringes feed.
01:11:39.076 - 01:11:59.344, Speaker A: I thought would hang really well with Koda. Nakazona there collect for only 150. So, I mean, Curio finds these really kind of cool, obscure works that are usually super cheap. So here's another one. This is sombre senses. Maybe sombre is the artist. And I think this is called onis.
01:11:59.344 - 01:12:17.464, Speaker A: Super interesting here. Hour and twelve. We got to hurry up. Martin Joe, the pink room. Red wine and spanky chairs in the pink room. So another work here by Martin Joe using maybe some AI, maybe some 3d tools. And always has an edge here with these wild, spiky chairs here.
01:12:17.464 - 01:12:48.700, Speaker A: And always something going on here. And some red wine and upside down cross with the Tezos logo on top. Really nice floor, by the way. So and there's the person, you know, the Marquis de sade. What is it? Is it the 120 days where people are used as furniture? You know, so, again, kind of dark humor in a lot of. You see a lot of it with Martin Jo Pasa Mostagim. And it's very hard to read the entire harn.
01:12:48.700 - 01:13:21.132, Speaker A: 20 days by Marquis de Sade. I wouldn't even recommend it. It's something you kind of open up and look through to read the whole thing. I can't even imagine I think Juliet and what's the other one called are a little more readable. But it's interesting to open up those books. But viewer discretion is advised on those books. So here parsa most of some more kind of CGI type works that would also hang nicely in the same room as, say, Martin Joe with the CGI here, fructose chase.
01:13:21.132 - 01:13:43.850, Speaker A: So interesting piece here often to AI with really cool work here by Sky Goodman. Astralis is now live on props 40 long form generative AI, one of ones, ten tezos each. So here are a couple of examples. Pretty cool. And I even brought this was almost, I think this is in it too. And it's almost like, you know, plasticine like. Or you see the drop shadow there.
01:13:43.850 - 01:14:03.118, Speaker A: It's almost sculptural. So interesting. AI project by Sky Goodman one of one. And here's another one. And you can just cycle through on the emergent Properties website. And only two left. So pretty successful situation here from Sky Goodman.
01:14:03.118 - 01:14:23.426, Speaker A: Nice pieces. This is Dernadler Richard Nadler with a take on Hokusai's wave Izanami islands, arriving December 14. At least that's what it looks like. And again, kind of 3d esque, isn't it? I wonder if this is an improps. Oh, this is on verse. Interesting. So this will be on verse.
01:14:23.426 - 01:14:50.278, Speaker A: Read about Richard Nadler's upcoming series, Izanami. So if you go to verseworks, you can learn more about this cool AI art. Marina Amidova with a couple of cool flower works here. Again, kind of painterly in the background here, glimpses beyond this edition of ten for 650 and a one of one for 65. Soulful reflections. And again, a nice painterly flower work by Marina Amidova. Nice textures there.
01:14:50.278 - 01:15:14.926, Speaker A: And continuing on Zoom, the interstellar connection. This is an AI series that has been min. I'm not sure if this is improps or not, but a pretty cool. I love the stars actually in this kind of almost orange like moon. And just interesting composition here you can see more on Zoom's page. And also young Caravaggio. For long time viewers, you might remember young Caravaggio's shoes.
01:15:14.926 - 01:15:42.432, Speaker A: We're coming out like in maybe October, last October, a year ago, kind of, kind of would hang well with strange things, some of those shoes. Yeah. Remember these? That artist, young Carvaggio is back. I saw on Instagram, which is interesting. And look at this. Look at this work by strange thing, I think, like I went, it kind of reminds me of this market in Palermo. I went to a thousand year old market in Palermo I.
01:15:42.432 - 01:16:04.390, Speaker A: I was guessing it was 2000 year. The balloro, I think it's called. And everywhere I looked, it was like a Renaissance painting. Not necessarily the safest place I've ever been, to be frank. But everywhere I looked, there's like the guy who is running away with the money and the other guy kind of everywhere I looked, it was like a Renaissance painting. I was like, this market is ancient. And sure enough, I looked it up online.
01:16:04.390 - 01:16:34.668, Speaker A: It's a thousand years old. And of course, Palermo famously had arabic, norman and latin cultures and greek all kind of, you know, mixed together there in Palermo. Kind of interesting history of multiculturalism. Anyway, I'm off topic here. Look at these shoes. So just brilliant color. Strange thing is able somehow to really emulate the color of some just gorgeous renaissance artworks.
01:16:34.668 - 01:16:58.068, Speaker A: He's doing just a fabulous job here. This one is really fun. And these very colorful shoes and this kind of renaissance backdrop. It's brilliant. It's just brilliant. Olivera Durdevik lost edge so more interesting work here. AI painting, I believe, I'm almost sure, and kind of surreal here with this figure kind of coming in here.
01:16:58.068 - 01:17:15.118, Speaker A: So interesting piece. Inspired by a knife from the Hannake's funny games. And this was posted, I think, by rip cash in Cosimo's curator feed. And I thought that was pretty cool work here. Eternal cue. The artist is toddy. I've never seen before.
01:17:15.118 - 01:17:41.664, Speaker A: Doesn't it kind of remind you of those textures? I think it was Gozo, right? Doesn't it have that kind of gozo as well as skomra kind of feeling to it? And so this is AI collage. Moshed then dithered. So you're getting the sense that maybe similar tools are being used. It is being. It is at auction at 0.248 or 0.225 medici emerging.
01:17:41.664 - 01:17:57.724, Speaker A: 2 hours to go on that auction. And here is Skomra again, I think, using similar tools here. This is on foundation. I don't think I've shown this one. It's possible I did. What does it mean to dream of black rainbow? So all to say, these are starting to be minted here on foundation. 0.05
01:17:57.724 - 01:18:09.168, Speaker A: east. Very attractive price. Here's another one. Reserve of 0.05 ETH. So these super cool AI illustrations of people at computers. Just totally awesome.
01:18:09.168 - 01:18:22.960, Speaker A: Stable diffusion and diffusers. Textual inversion. So great work from Skomra. And then finally, nugget brain. Look at, like, this is such a brilliant work. I don't think I've shown this one before. It was just posted by nuggetbrain.
01:18:22.960 - 01:18:36.960, Speaker A: I think I might have seen it being made. Just an awesome artist. That's probably nugget brain there. I've shown a lot of nugget brain. Look at this one with the sunset in the background. I'm just such a huge fan of this artist. Really, really cool artist.
01:18:36.960 - 01:19:08.804, Speaker A: So you noticed it's not necessarily that huge. Some of these works, interestingly fun times with wacky wax pastels. Again, it's sort of like, as an artist, if you ever hit a roadblock, try a different medium and see what it does. Tetsu norita wairaya. Just interesting illustration here. Kind of has a zine feeling to it. Quite brilliant and original in the color scheme, I'd say, more than anything, very original color schemes here.
01:19:08.804 - 01:19:24.934, Speaker A: So pretty cool. Kind of looks like predator, doesn't it, here. Kind of. Kind of looks like alien a little bit there, but not so. Just really interesting work here. Maybe, Rizo, is how it's been produced. It looks like a really nice rizzo.
01:19:24.934 - 01:19:35.506, Speaker A: Pretty interesting work. Look at this artist. Bondozo Bandito. This is your reward for staying for an hour and 20 minutes. Look at this artist here. Bondozo bandito. Listen to me.
01:19:35.506 - 01:19:51.158, Speaker A: Kiss me badly. Just a super interesting artist here. Another discovery. We're drowning in art over here. It's just like great diptych. Looks like, you know, the sort of thing you'll see on Orion air flight. You know, these kind of instructions here.
01:19:51.158 - 01:20:18.006, Speaker A: This looks like a Dorer reference. So all looking like mostly appropriated art. Again, it has that airbrush or spray paint kind of look. Really not worrying about what it looks like, in a sense. And then at the end, it looks really good. Just really great work here from Bondozo Bandido, I think a younger guy here, as you can see. And there's these Robert Crumb works.
01:20:18.006 - 01:20:36.594, Speaker A: I brought up these other works like, this is Robert Crumb, I'm sure, and look like. But done with this kind of spray painty style, divided up. Move in, silent shining the noise. Really super interesting artist here. Let me. This is machine. Just want to.
01:20:36.594 - 01:20:50.144, Speaker A: I want to go to the. I will come back to that artist. Here's machine. Howdy. And so another really cool skateboard work by machine. Here's another one. Julian Pace.
01:20:50.144 - 01:21:10.544, Speaker A: And this wildly kind of, you know, distorted soccer player. Very tiny head on this canvas here. There's a ton of great work coming out in the physical world, too. And a lot of these people don't necessarily have, like, huge followings. This person has pretty big following. 21,000. You know what's interesting about this piece.
01:21:10.544 - 01:21:22.492, Speaker A: I was looking at it and I thought, I love the drips. I love the part on top. They kind of make the work. But it turns out that is actually. This is the work. And I like the work, actually. It's really well done.
01:21:22.492 - 01:21:38.424, Speaker A: But I thought this one was amazing. Isn't that interesting? New painting headed to Indonesia for Beca art gallery and Art Jakarta. The opening. Cool. Interesting work. And here's Joachim official. I don't think we've seen this Batman one before.
01:21:38.424 - 01:21:50.524, Speaker A: Very cool. The war years. Like an original Batman cover. And here's someone. Antonio Mergia. So this looks like maybe a collage. And with some paint.
01:21:50.524 - 01:22:02.432, Speaker A: 55 by 110 cm. So not tiny. Colpo di Firmini. Firmeni. Not sure what that means. Working on my italian. And of course, Yoao Salazar.
01:22:02.432 - 01:22:13.458, Speaker A: I think this is still a work in progress. So, still working on this piece. Looks like a combination of plasticine and paint. But not. But maybe this is just really thick medium. Very cool. And that finally.
01:22:13.458 - 01:22:21.594, Speaker A: Oh, my God. I'm gonna. I don't know what I'm. How I'm gonna make the show shorter. But we're gonna have to with that. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
