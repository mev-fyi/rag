00:00:06.240 - 00:00:25.320, Speaker A: The absurdity continues as we continue to move forward here. Absurdity in a good way. Don't forget we have Jari's Theater of the Absurd. It's not Jari, but he kind of maybe pioneered it. I think it was Antoine Arto. Anthony Arto, however you say it. Anyways, welcome back.
00:00:25.320 - 00:00:47.588, Speaker A: Artist Journal, November 25, 2024, broadcasting from Bologna, Italy, where there are the most spectacular Black Friday sales you will ever see. I am so excited. I have been shopping like a madman. I didn't expect it. I was here to kind of learn about genealogy. And I've just been shopping. I have learned certain things.
00:00:47.588 - 00:01:23.706, Speaker A: Interestingly, in Rome, I have found my old great grandfather's journal, courtesy of a cousin. And it was always kind of illegible. The writing was so, you know, that 1890s, you know, like, writing way back then was very. You know, it's hard to read, to put it simply. And we couldn't even barely read it. It was in Italian, of course, but ChatGPT, you take a photo with the new ChatGPT, and the old Chat GPT didn't do a great job. But the new ChatGPT, you take a photo, ask it to translate, and all of a sudden, the general poet.
00:01:23.706 - 00:01:41.510, Speaker A: Get that a general. But wow. The poet. The poet General Gustavo Pocabelli, great grandfather. So fascinating. A window, you know, it's a fascinating subject matter. So anyways, let us begin here.
00:01:41.510 - 00:02:13.622, Speaker A: But I think again, I think I'll come here every year for Bologna Black Friday, finally, just to give you a clue, you know, you can buy. So a suit that was regular â‚¬700, you know, in a beautiful, like, Italian, you know, clothing shop where everything looks good from the window. And I saw a nice kind of trench coat. I almost want to go and get it here. Nice kind of beige trench coat, the kind you'd find in, like, London sort of thing. That. And so I walk in for that, and then I'm being shown suits.
00:02:13.622 - 00:02:38.336, Speaker A: They're. They're upselling you, but they're doing it so well that you're just happy to be upsold because you're like, this looks beautiful. Got a full suit. Normally 700, already down to 400. And then for Black Friday was 200. So I felt like, this is spectacular. So I have to go quickly here in order to get to the tailors actually today to start just adjusting whatever needs to be adjusted.
00:02:38.336 - 00:02:59.956, Speaker A: But I am just having a ton of fun over here. Bologna, it continues. So just final show note here. There will be a show. I'm hoping it's always hoping. I'm hoping before I leave here on Thursday morning. I believe I leave here on Thursday morning back to Rome to drop off all these clothes hilariously.
00:02:59.956 - 00:03:24.044, Speaker A: And then it might be another week or so before the next show. Let's begin. So his dribble waffle, as many of you know, I think this is under cedar plank. It is so. AKA cedar plank, also known as. And just kind of a fun one to start the show. And I was commenting last episode on kind of the chaos of waffles works and big shout out to Waffles.
00:03:24.044 - 00:03:46.530, Speaker A: I, I mentioned maybe bringing waffles on for the space and it sounds like waffles is receptive. So I will reach out. I'm very excited about that. I haven't reached out to anybody for this week yet, but I may, I need to get canexapeta and everything. So anyways, I, I, I think there will be a space. I will reach out to people today. It is always a war against the clock, so to speak here.
00:03:46.530 - 00:04:24.096, Speaker A: So end Omega is the name of this work here. And as you see, actually, I think I brought it big. So what is the first reference? I mean, it seems like this is the Alpha, right? Alpha and Omega. Interestingly, you'll often find the Alpha and Omega signs on Italian paintings. I mean, occasionally where you'll actually see the Greek Alpha on one side and then the Omega on the other. In a sense, the Arche and the origin and the kind of the final destination. I can't remember, is it Arche and Omega.
00:04:24.096 - 00:05:07.632, Speaker A: I'm not sure. But the Alpha and Omega, Greek letters. But you'll often find in Christian painting where it's kind of like the beginning and the end or Right. And so here kind of a different feel. Kind of looks like the Alpha dude in the center of this painting with the Christmas or, sorry, with the birthday cake interestingly placed here. And once again, and I actually brought this up on a version we can zoom in on here. Interestingly, as we've noticed before with waffles work, I mean, the, the anatomy is surprisingly good, to put it, to be super blunt about it.
00:05:07.632 - 00:05:40.738, Speaker A: I like especially here. I mean, this is quite well done considering it looks like someone's just kind of like, you know, quickly moving. And I think waffles mentioned. I can't remember if it was an anatomy class or used to copy. I think took an anatomy class at one point or was copying out of anatomy books kind of a classic tradition. I mean, put it this way. If you're 16 years old and you're watching this, that's probably the smartest thing you could do is get an anatomy textbook and just start copying.
00:05:40.738 - 00:06:32.186, Speaker A: Just start getting to know everything. Because you got the time when you're 16, 17 years old, you got the neurons that are just like, aching to grow, get familiar, you know, in a sense, create those, you know, those brain trees. I almost want to say those neural roots, so to speak, that we were discussing last episode. I mean, it's kind of interesting. I don't want to go too long here because I have quite a bit to do today. But our discussion that we're having last episode on this whole idea of consciousness being a product, in a sense of neurons kind of making new connections and associations and kind of growing out a bit, however that happens. What do they call it in where the brain is? You know, it's.
00:06:32.186 - 00:07:15.576, Speaker A: It's. There's a word for it which means that it's like something morphic, that the brain itself is not a static thing. It's something that, you know, you can train. This is why they say as you get older, it's good to learn languages. Maybe chess is a good idea. Why is that? And I think as we start to kind of piece together a model, so to speak, is when you're doing these kind of things, you're making new connections. And it's kind of hard work the first time you make that connection and you don't necessarily enjoy it, in a sense, but then once it's familiar territory and you've been through it a few times, then it's more familiar territory, so to speak.
00:07:15.576 - 00:07:56.450, Speaker A: And so finally, on this whole topic, because I don't want to forget, and this is a journal of sorts, it got me wondering, like, is all. Are all kind of areas of knowledge simply this kind of flowering or this, you know, this tree outing or these roots, you know, the branching out, these stems in certain areas. So if you're learning a language, all of a sudden you're growing all these branches out, right? And then leaves are even popping up. Maybe you get. There's another word for this, of things that happen. Is that Alfred North Whitehead word. Anyways, I'm going all over the place here.
00:07:56.450 - 00:08:40.616, Speaker A: Forgive me, but all to say, I'm finding this interesting as well as aesthetic cannons, you know, or aesthetic, a, you know, appreciation of certain aesthetics, where I was kind of commenting on the commenter last episode, who is kind of very skeptical of the art we were looking at here. And I. I was basically saying, well, maybe it's just that the branches haven't come out yet. And the more you familiarize with it, the more the branches of the brain, so to speak, the neurons will connect and the more familiar it'll be and the more comfortable, in a sense, in a sense, enjoyable it will become. Because all of a sudden, it's not the hard work of making the neurons connect. It's more. You've already made the path, you've done the hard work, and now you can kind of enjoy the fruits of the labor.
00:08:40.616 - 00:09:03.040, Speaker A: If there's something to be there. If there's something there, in a sense, you have. You've created the path, and now you can reflect on that path as you walk down it. Maybe. Who knows? Anyways, let's get back to Waffles here. So as you see here. Is that a mushroom? That looks kind of like a mushroom.
00:09:03.040 - 00:09:35.854, Speaker A: Hard to say. Maybe it is Thor's hammer here with the lightning also coming out of it. Look at that. That kind of adds a whole other dimension. So zooming in, as you see here, Waffles is up to quite a bit here. And you're seeing different softwares being pasted in. And I think I saw Waffles put out a tweet saying the struggle he was having of trying to get different speeds of gif in to one picture plane, so to speak.
00:09:35.854 - 00:09:52.926, Speaker A: Because of course, gifs are a bunch of frames, right? That's how you get the animation. It's one frame after another. It's basically light animation. It is animation where. So. But if you're trying to do that at different speeds, all of a sudden it's almost like music. You're playing third notes and.
00:09:52.926 - 00:10:12.790, Speaker A: Right. And if you're trying to get it at different rhyth. So one wonders if that's part of what was going on here. You see some divers, a couple of divers that are repeated. You see what looks like a zeppelin. Who knows, maybe an underwater device. And here, more underwater imagery as you see the fish.
00:10:12.790 - 00:11:05.442, Speaker A: And here, this, you know, kind of a different, again, I want to call it, for lack of better term, different visual modality here, for lack of better term here, as we see this, what looks like an icon of a computer, right? Just kind of paste it on top. And then here, for shock, contrast, or just for the hell of it, we have a skateboarder on top of the computer. So here we have very 3D on top of very 2D with a background that is really. I mean, what is this again? I was referring to it as a kind of chaos here. It's hard to say what this is, but what it for me it feels like this digital. A digital tableau perhaps. And also you see, you know, maybe a stamp here with the clown face and then.
00:11:05.442 - 00:11:37.220, Speaker A: But bigger faces, the chaos with. But there is still a focal point here which is to a certain degree this muscular figure in the middle here with what looks like Thor's hammer or a mushroom with lightning going through it. And Alpha and Omega. Interesting title perhaps. You know, there is that finally here there is that famous book again. What was it called? Where the speculation. I actually read that book where God is a mushroom.
00:11:37.220 - 00:12:08.034, Speaker A: Do you remember? I'm sure a lot of you know that God is a mushroom book. Welcome to the show for all new list viewers here. The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross. Of course. I actually have read this John Allegro. It was on Terence McKenna's would talk about this book every so often. And so yeah, I mean it kind of evokes that because I think something to do with the rain and fertility and everything.
00:12:08.034 - 00:12:33.044, Speaker A: So who knows what that even is. Maybe it's not even a mushroom, but lots of lots to just chew on here. A great. Just a fun way to start the show. And so Hasdrubal Waffle AKA Cedar Plank. Let's just see what happened in the market here. Addition of five and tempert getting offering 81 tezos which is 100 bucks.
00:12:33.044 - 00:13:01.762, Speaker A: And again this is an addition of five. Transferring one to little cake. So the anarchy continues in the market. Transfers one to Eilay and Neon Monk who has been buying a ton of waffles work sends one over. So the generosity of of waffles continues and the unique selling style really just really kind of putting the fun first as it seems. So thank you everybody for the support. Let's look at the.
00:13:01.762 - 00:13:07.986, Speaker A: Let's look at the comments here. Welcome back, Mr. Pokebelly. Thank you. Omizu Ecotextile. Hi Adrian. Beautiful artworks.
00:13:07.986 - 00:14:01.950, Speaker A: Once more, thanks for the show. You are more than welcome. Rat a Yankee. Yes, sir. Video games matters because nostalgia matters. It's an interesting question, isn't it? You know, because sometimes because I've been having this discussion what was it on where I was I talking about old computer games? I was having a discussion with someone. I'm literally, I'm thinking like in 2012 in Paris when I was visiting one there for the first time, I think think at an Airbnb and with the guy and I was, I remember and I was talking about old Lego boxes and how I thought there was something kind of precious and as I like to call, you know, a lot of like design especially from the 80s, you think of the Star wars action figure boxes, you even think of board games.
00:14:01.950 - 00:14:34.340, Speaker A: You can think of stamps to a certain degree, an unrecognized canon, so to speak, of art exists in design. Adult video games, you know, especially 1980s video games. And my friend was saying as he read my essay on what is it that makes, I think, space, 80s space Lego so much better than modern Lego. I had a better title for it. I. And he was like, it's just nostalgia. As I wrap up my point here, he was.
00:14:34.340 - 00:15:35.506, Speaker A: I think it was Benoit Benoit was saying, but it's just nostalgia. And so when Rada says video games matters because nostalgia matters to me, it evokes a whole big discussion of where does nostalgia stop, stop, and kind of beauty and kind of art begin? And how much are they overlapping? Or is there kind of a dividing line where we can say, over here this is nostalgia, over here this is art. Do we have a, you know, a. In the history of art, do we have kind of examples of nostalgia? I think we do. You know, when you have these kind of pastoral kind of works to a certain degree, I mean, are the Pre Raphaelites. I mean, just to open the question, is that kind of like as the world is getting industrial, and then they put like these kind of pastoral, beautiful scenes. There's Ophelia, you know, in the water and, you know, referencing Shakespeare.
00:15:35.506 - 00:15:57.630, Speaker A: Is that kind of a nostalgia of sorts? I suspect it is. So we probably haven't had nostalgia for a while. It seems like kind of a classic human thing. And once again, and we have it in art, interestingly, I'd argue perhaps in the Pre Raphaelite. So anyways, it just brings up an interesting discussion. Thank you for the comment, Rada. Awesome to hear from you.
00:15:57.630 - 00:16:19.276, Speaker A: Also, thank you for the massive support here. 14,000 views, a ton of retweets and bookmarks here. Thank you all for the support on X. A very exciting platform. I see people like, with their, you know, I just made $6,000 on X just for posting. I was like, maybe I need to post more. Because I think I did the math right.
00:16:19.276 - 00:16:41.530, Speaker A: It's like, how much do you need? I think 5 million views in three months is to. In order to get paid on X. And so I did the math. 5 million divided by 90 days. And I think it's 50,000, 55,000, you know, impressions, whatever. I think that's a view. I think it's 55,000 of these per day for three months.
00:16:41.530 - 00:17:04.530, Speaker A: So no kind of mean feat, no small task, but kind of but, you know, if you start posting 10 times a day and everything, maybe you start getting checks. And maybe it's just incentive to post interesting content. And maybe you post interesting content. It actually gets a lot of traction. So just thoughts in the back of my mind here. So 369, finally back. The show must go on.
00:17:04.530 - 00:17:13.970, Speaker A: Indeed. Indeed. I woke up very early to make that show happen. Cedar Plank. Thanks, Poco. And congratulations on your auction. Happy to chat anytime.
00:17:13.970 - 00:17:27.684, Speaker A: So this is thrilling. So I will reach out to Cedar Plank for a show in the next two or three weeks as I continue to travel. It's a little tricky, but I can't wait. And that's thrilling news. Thank you. Cedar Plank. Hasdrubal Waffle Pederil.
00:17:27.684 - 00:17:48.760, Speaker A: Great to have you back. Thanks for purchasing some of my work. Lovely surprise to find out via watching the show. And this was a super interesting work. You may recall. Remember the Nintendo Glitch ROM that was. It was almost like it was selected a certain area and then it was edited and then we had like this big kind of canvas.
00:17:48.760 - 00:18:20.800, Speaker A: Fascinating. And to me, it just. And I think I said this at the time, it just shows we are scratching the surface of digital art here. Because of course, you could do the same thing with Video Glitch. Just take a frame and then make that like a small thing, and then use that as a source to do 20 other things. There seems to be, as we see in techno and electronic music, this endless capacity to recycle, which is kind of interesting. Again, this is kind of different from physical, isn't it? I think.
00:18:20.800 - 00:18:33.684, Speaker A: I think let's continue. I want. Thank you for the heart, Human Boy. Thanks for another great episode. Thank you, hb, for the ongoing support. We have a work by you at the end of this episode, actually, in the AI section. Braindead.
00:18:33.684 - 00:18:41.604, Speaker A: Welcome back. Thank you. Actually works by Braindead. Gogolitis. Thank you. Now I have something to watch and listen to while I'm pixel arting. This makes me so happy.
00:18:41.604 - 00:19:04.808, Speaker A: I think Uxine. Yeah, I said the same thing. Just over here. I. At first, when I started this show, I was concerned that it would distract people from making art. Because all of a sudden it's like, if you're putting out 45 minutes and it's like, are people watching videos rather than making art? I mean, I wasn't overly concerned, but I was. But I did voice my concern at a certain point.
00:19:04.808 - 00:19:14.596, Speaker A: So I'm thrilled that it's actually helping people. It's kind of like putting on music, maybe. So awesome to Hear from you. Go Go. Lightis and Uxine. Yo Pocoback. I can finally draw.
00:19:14.596 - 00:19:25.428, Speaker A: I can finally draw stuff. So this is awesome. And we have a really cool, I think homemade screen print by Uxie in this episode. Pedro Jose, welcome back. Thank you, Neon Monk. Good to have you back. Hadrian.
00:19:25.428 - 00:19:34.820, Speaker A: Thanks for the mentions. I tried to keep busy while I missed your regular dose of art enthusiasm. Awesome to hear. Just a wonderful community. So thank you. Neon. Great to hear from you.
00:19:34.820 - 00:19:47.270, Speaker A: Blue Alley. It's snowing in Paris. Adrian, 10cm chez moi so far. Have a great show. Yeah, it's even worse. My mom was saying in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, where I will end up in a few weeks. 25 centimeters.
00:19:47.270 - 00:19:56.162, Speaker A: 25 centimeters. So that is a huge amount of snow. Rose. Welcome back. We'll watch in the morning. Awesome. Yann Lucas Magone.
00:19:56.162 - 00:20:06.290, Speaker A: Pushing the start button. Awesome. Neural Divine. Nice show. Thank you. Max Bigglehelp, thank you for posting And Solu, welcome back. And thank you for sharing my art.
00:20:06.290 - 00:20:15.184, Speaker A: You're welcome. Rada. Enjoying the coffee with you. Inherent Liberation. Oh, can't wait. Thank you for the comment. And Blue Pastel.
00:20:15.184 - 00:20:30.160, Speaker A: Proud holder. Awesome. And very quickly, through the community here, here is Zizo. We have passed 700 members. This is wonderful. So Zizo, with what looks like a procreate drawing, here's Libroblock. This is for the Art for Artists event.
00:20:30.160 - 00:20:49.262, Speaker A: A cooperative contract where everyone shares a percentage from every sale. I was. I saw that. I didn't understand as usual, you know, as usual, I don't understand what's going on. To who, like who gets shared to who? To everybody. So I'm sure there's like an answer. I don't know.
00:20:49.262 - 00:21:16.296, Speaker A: Do you sign up to get the money? So anyways, but nice. It's pretty cool. A cooperative contract where everyone shares a percentage from every sale and. But so interesting. I want to learn more here. You're on Yakon, the definitive artist typology by Greg Nikshemika, Esthetician. So this may be a little long for us to go through, but thank you for posting and looks very interesting.
00:21:16.296 - 00:21:34.402, Speaker A: So here's all the different kinds of art types. The dabbler, the traditionalist, the fearmonger. You know, this is actually quite interesting. Ultimate Edition. That is quite interesting, right? I mean it's something we've discussed here over the last 370 episodes. You know, the role of the artist. We see it in the introduction to Crash.
00:21:34.402 - 00:22:24.250, Speaker A: What is the role of the writer? As Ballard says, in the introduction to Crash, the writer's role is no longer to invent the fiction, but to create a fiction, but to invent the reality. To, quote, invent the reality. You know, in a world of fictions of every kind, the role of the artist is they're here now to figure out what's going on in a surreal world. They are uniquely able and prepared to actually help us understand the reality. Because why? Because they are experts in fiction and in the imagination. And in a world that's increasingly filled with fictions of every kind, all of a sudden the artist, the writer is able to help us contribute in a very provocatively profound way into what is going on. Let's continue.
00:22:24.250 - 00:23:02.230, Speaker A: Maybe here's some info here from Heidi Thing. Hey Poco, Just sharing art for artists. 40 of us have created a mutual bread fond using TEA's collab contract. So everyone gets 1% of all primary and secondary and the remaining 99% is equally shared. So in lead times, everyone can do this. So does that mean if you sign up, then you get 99? So 40 of us have created a mutual bread fund using Taya's club contract. So everyone gets 1% of all primary and secondary and the remaining 99% is equally shared.
00:23:02.230 - 00:23:15.580, Speaker A: So interesting. And I assume you could. Anybody could sign up. So interesting. Interesting artist imagination. Happy weekend everyone. Passing by Compressing in progress.
00:23:15.580 - 00:23:40.638, Speaker A: Stay tuned. This was interesting. And yeah, so 369 hi Adrian, would love to share an idea that combined both on and off chain methods hybrid approach. The fully on chain isn't just a compression artwork. It's also a certificate of ownership of the original work. For example, collector got the original work, should get the FOC fully on chain certificate too. This can protect the collector, also can protect the artist's work.
00:23:40.638 - 00:24:08.280, Speaker A: This can be a challenge to the copy mentor. This idea, kind of like phygital, I think. NFTs physical and digital. This is what I have done. Yeah, it's an interesting idea. I mean, my only concern in a sense is it might diminish the artistic value in a sense of the compressed work. Because I think there's something to be said.
00:24:08.280 - 00:24:51.468, Speaker A: I mean, if you're simply doing, okay, I'll do the bitmap version and you don't put too much of an, you know, go beyond that, then maybe this makes a ton of sense. But from an artist's point of view, I find weirdly delightful this idea of trying to make small file versions of works or just of art in general. And you could do it also. I mean, I almost kind of love the idea of go Find all your. I've thought about this with bitcoin, I actually have mixes, I just haven't uploaded them and now here we are at Bitcoin 100,000. But I've actually done this with some of my other artworks where I've made kind of low res versions that could live on bitcoin. Right.
00:24:51.468 - 00:25:17.394, Speaker A: But to me, these, you know, as far as certificates. Yeah, I think sure, if that's how someone wants to do it. But for me it's like these are artworks, these are. Maybe they're even better than the high res versions. Maybe they're more exciting because of this weird delight from making things small. Right. So interesting point and I think just goes to show that you can kind of do.
00:25:17.394 - 00:25:46.386, Speaker A: There's so many approaches right now. I think an interesting, you know, put it this way, what I love about this is it gives you an excuse to make a small version of your larger artworks that are maybe 10 megabytes or more. And then hey, can you make a three kilobyte version? And all of a sudden you're making the small version and all of a sudden you're making a different artwork. I would argue you could argue it's a mix. But yeah. So anyways, super interesting. Thank you for the comment 369.
00:25:46.386 - 00:26:02.560, Speaker A: Interesting as ever. Suji. Hi everyone. My physical painting combined and recreated with AI. So again we're seeing AI is getting increasingly hard, hard to detect and very sophisticated. So beautiful work there. Thank you.
00:26:02.560 - 00:26:21.820, Speaker A: Nahid with a cool painting and that was posted on November 22nd. Kind of looks physical. Again, hard to tell. Skull takes new no code. Easy interface for minting on chain. Works on Tezos under 20 kilobytes and under V1 can mint one of ones V2 can mint editions. So here we go again.
00:26:21.820 - 00:26:48.956, Speaker A: I'll have to try how to mint fully on chain. NFTs on the Tezos Zero contract by Justem Zero no code. So we did see something about this I think recently. Thank you for posting. My concern was especially with Tezos, going up in price was, I think it was something like a third of a Tezos per kilobyte. And it was kind of comparable to bitcoin, maybe like a quarter or a fifth of the cost of bitcoin. And I've.
00:26:48.956 - 00:27:09.444, Speaker A: And then I say well if I'm going to put it on chain, well why not bitcoin? But who knows, In a sense it just a decision everybody has to make on their own. Libra block. Thank you for the very beautiful abstract here. These are really going somewhere Excited for where that's going. Psycho Futurist with some very cool works here. So thank you everybody. Dr.
00:27:09.444 - 00:28:14.710, Speaker A: Version, thank you for posting and I think we have gotten through, we did, we have gotten through the community, so thank you for that. Just a couple of stories kind of held over from the last couple of weeks. Vatican Microsoft Create AI generated St. Peter's Basilica to allow virtual visits and also hilariously to log the damage that is being done to the artwork, I guess. So let's take a quick look here and there's a concept here that I'm seeing more and more of the digital twin the Vatican and Microsoft on Monday unveiled a digital twin of St. Peter's Basilica that uses AI to explore one of the world's most important monuments while helping the Holy See manage visitor flows and identify conservation problems. Using 400,000 high resolution digital photographs taken with drones, cameras and lasers over four weeks when no one was in the basilica, the digital replica is going online alongside two new on site exhibits to provide visitors, real and virtual, with an interactive experience.
00:28:14.710 - 00:29:00.718, Speaker A: So this is something we're starting to see more and more across several industries, which is sensors creating, basically recording physical reality and then using that as a data input to give to AI. Right as, because as everybody knows, data is kind of like the oil, so to speak, of AI. And so here, here's just an example of that. And again, the digital twin is kind of where you have to start. I think this is just one of many ways of thinking about it, but just kind of interesting. Anyways, let's continue. Quote, it is literally one of the most technologically advanced and sophisticated projects of its kind that has ever been pursued, end quote.
00:29:00.718 - 00:29:32.350, Speaker A: Microsoft's president Brad Smith told a Vatican press conference. That's impressive. Finally, it's been launched for the Vatican's 2025 Jubilee, a holy year in which more than 30 million pilgrims are expected to pass through the Basilica's holy door, on top of the 50,000 who visit on a normal day. So it's going to get crazy in Rome. My cousin in Rome was saying that basically everybody's getting ready to rent their house out in next year. So everyone really should feel welcome in this great house. So it's going to get crazy in Rome next year.
00:29:32.350 - 00:29:45.644, Speaker A: Go while you can. Go this year while you can. You're running out of time. Let's continue. Online Marketplace Platform is launching an art fair. So this is called Platform. This actually just happened this weekend.
00:29:45.644 - 00:30:23.238, Speaker A: COO Richard Thayer says Chelsea Art Fair, which is the name of this fair, will offer an intimate in person experience of younger collectors that brings the company's thoughtfully curated online offerings to life. This is in the observer. Finally, platform debuted in May 2021 as a collaborative online showcase of artists, and it's built in partnership with David Zwerner. It was designed to give younger galleries a virtual venue to exhibit their artists while their physical spaces sat idle. Thanks to Co Covid. So I brought this up just to give you a taste of it. So a digital platform, and it looks like here to show physical works.
00:30:23.238 - 00:31:12.250, Speaker A: As you see this, just new artworks, oil on canvas. And so it's quite interesting, isn't it? It doesn't feel from a content perspective. My thought was it feels very trad art. It feels like something you would see in contemporary art galleries, which is, I think, what they're basically designing it for. But it kind of brings back to me a deeper question of content and of, you know, is. Let me pose a question for you to answer and you can answer it yourself. Is this, you know, what we're looking at here? Younger gallerists, maybe younger artists, perhaps? Is this the art of, you know, of the current generation? Maybe it is.
00:31:12.250 - 00:31:43.236, Speaker A: I ask it as an open question, but I mean. But I think it's an open question. And, you know, since when I see this, and I don't want to start making dividing lines and all this sort of thing, but what I see, and perhaps it is in certain respects, you know, especially you look at this, look at how great that is. And it's not to. But I wonder if this is, you know, and we're painting with a broad brush. There's several different artists here, but I'm kind of back to digital. I'm kind of back to digital.
00:31:43.236 - 00:32:05.370, Speaker A: And the excitement with digital, in a sense, like when I come here, I go, oh, there's some nice works here. Kind of interesting. Am I going to load this up every day? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Let's continue. Tezos on a tear. You know, weirdly, you know, call me a masochist, but I kind of love the low tezos price.
00:32:05.370 - 00:32:36.726, Speaker A: Tezos. Now it's getting expensive to buy art again. You know, it's getting like, you know, all of a sudden you're spending 40 bucks on this, you know, digital artwork, and you're like, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It was a lot easier when it was like, you know, 15 tezos and it cost me 10 or 30 tezos and it cost me 20. So interesting, but great news for everybody who's collected here over the last, you know, couple of years. Fabulous news for our collections, for the value of our collections, and probably good news for the artists.
00:32:36.726 - 00:33:10.664, Speaker A: You're going to make some more money here, one would think. Great to see Tezos up 75 for the week and approaching 26% up for the day. That was November 24th. That was yesterday. I think it went as high as a $160. And I think we have to ask ourselves, why is Tezos going up? Like, are the other old chains going up? I, you know, is it the. And I think the question, the underlying question to that is, is it, Is it the art? Is it the recognition that, you know, Tezos has a lot of, A lot of the.
00:33:10.664 - 00:33:37.360, Speaker A: A lot of important art from the blockchain, you know, a significant amount of important art on the blockchain is on Tezos. I think that's a undeniable statement here. So is that the reason? That would be quite the, you know, situation. If that's the case. Let's continue. Gogolitis, I thought this was interesting. We adore chaos because we love to produce order.
00:33:37.360 - 00:34:02.352, Speaker A: And that's MC Escher quoted by Gogolitis. And I think this is quite interesting in a sense. You know, I would kind of add on, like, we can't help but produce order. That is almost. It's what is understanding. And some people would say it's pattern recognition. And what is pattern recognition? Ultimately, you're saying you see a pattern, you see order, you're imposing.
00:34:02.352 - 00:34:51.560, Speaker A: You know, again, we're back to Freud's reality principle. What is, you know, you are rationalizing reality, you are making sense of your external world. Right? So now this all in the context of why do we love chaos? Why do we love randomness? And we do, we do love, I would argue, controlled randomness. Pure randomness is just randomness. But when you have a certain degree of control over that randomness, like we see in a Rauschenberg or you name it, or in a brush stroke, that kind of ordered chaos and where it works with randomness. I think we love that contrast. So it's just kind of an interesting topic from that.
00:34:51.560 - 00:35:09.816, Speaker A: Go Go. Lightest is highlighting here, courtesy of MC Escher or MC Escher. Quote courtesy of Gogalitis. Nobody's omc. Nobody is entitled to anything. Artists aren't always loyal to collectors that have supported them when new money enters the space. Artists aren't always loyal to collectors that have supported them.
00:35:09.816 - 00:35:50.688, Speaker A: Right, okay. So they can't expect collectors to be loyal to them just because they Stuck around. Earn success through your craft, not your presence. And I actually totally agree with this. There is a sense out there in the crypto world that doesn't, I'd say, exist in the trad art world that because you've been around, therefore your work is more important. It's actually, I would argue, the exact opposite in the contemporary art world. The longer you're around, if you haven't done, you know, if you haven't made waves and you've been around for 10 years, that's not a good thing, right? So I think at the end of the day it, you know, we're lucky we have a free market here.
00:35:50.688 - 00:36:21.034, Speaker A: I'd say it's freer than most and we're gonna have another tab that kind of discusses the market and what's happening here. But I think it's freer than the trad art scene. I think it's more open. I think it's more possible for things to happen here. Anybody can mint on Tezos and, you know, start making waves within a week if your work is kind of head turning. Right? So kind of agree Shash. Entrepreneurs who worked during the bear market on art, organized things and survived will win big.
00:36:21.034 - 00:37:11.570, Speaker A: Some artists who did, I've included in the thread below, share what you did besides art the last couple of years. So it's an interesting question here. Entrepreneurs who work during the bear market, I think there's something to be said for this, you know, all these names that we've gotten to know over the last three years, you know, and they continue working. Put it this way, it's something I've long said here, that prolificness equals credibility to a certain degree. Not always, but to paint with a broad brush, if you're around and you keep releasing and keep releasing and keep releasing, that builds credibility. So all of a sudden, if we get a massive bull market here, which seems weirdly possible, I'm almost like frightened of the, of what that could mean, you know, in terms of. Because I've just assumed, in a weird way, I just assume it's going to be like this forever.
00:37:11.570 - 00:37:40.380, Speaker A: But that's not what's going to happen. It's probably the more likely scenario is actually the scene kind of actually becomes bigger. I suspect especially with bitcoin going up, there is only one Tezos blockchain. And again, I'm multi chain here. I love all blockchains. You know, I've worked on Ethereum, I've worked Solana, I just put a workup Bitcoin, you know, I love it. So but you do wonder, you know, what could happen here.
00:37:40.380 - 00:38:28.894, Speaker A: Anyway, let's continue. This is interesting, Purple Hat. One of the biggest problems I have with many of the east on this website is they never took the digital art movement happening on Ethereum seriously. Vitalik not having a meaningful on chain art collection is somewhat embarrassing for a chain where there's been one of the clear. Where that has been one of the clearest use cases. And I have to agree, I mean what this, what this illustrates to me, there is a, it's a unholy marriage in a sense right now, I'd say between the artists and the tech people, for lack of better term not because some people, some tech people are artists and you know, some artists are tech people. And I'd actually argue most artists who are digital actually have a little bit of tech because you need tech in order to do your art.
00:38:28.894 - 00:39:03.596, Speaker A: But there is, I think oftentimes a lot of the programmers cannot really have an idea of the. And that's okay. And it's not a judgment but just a statement of fact. If they haven't taken any art classes or art history, which is sometimes, you know, the case, then where's the interest? Right? Then you maybe you're more into PFPs. Right. And so I actually kind of agree with this though. Like why doesn't Vitalik have an art collection? And probably it's just a symptom of this divide in a sense.
00:39:03.596 - 00:39:49.712, Speaker A: This, there is kind of, there is some overlap, but it's mostly artists I'd argue with a little bit of tech. I sometimes you get programmers with tech, but often you'll get programmers with artists, sorry, programmers with no art background. So I think just something you know, because as Purple Hat says, this is one of the most clearest use cases for crypto has been digital art, the buying and selling of digital objects. So very interesting. Let's continue. So and so so referring to this tweet by Art Gnome about the first X copy nft, the first super rare NFT and launched the entire lost Robbies market all for less than $500. Ask me anything.
00:39:49.712 - 00:40:22.826, Speaker A: Why did you do it? Because the old art world system was so bad, anything would be better. But then we replicated it. So I think Art Gnome is referring more to what we see. What I loosely, for lack of better term, called the mainstream kind of digital NFT art scene, so to speak. I don't even like the word NFT anymore. I think NFT, it just sounds like 2021. I call them digital objects and digital art and so I, I think this is partially true, but I don't think that's what we've done over here.
00:40:22.826 - 00:40:56.086, Speaker A: I don't think that's what's happening on Tezos, for example. I don't think that's universally true. I think really what's going on, again, I'm kind of back to Tezos. But we also see with like, you know, what happened on Zora, all the artists coming on wherever there's like an open playing field where artists get compensated for their work. You're seeing artists from all around the world. You are seeing, I'd argue an art revolution. It's just like there are different areas here, it seems to me, within this larger ecosystem of digital art on the blockchain, I suspect.
00:40:56.086 - 00:41:25.264, Speaker A: So I, so I don't think this is universally true what's being said here. But then we replicated it, I think maybe in certain areas. So Sanzo makes the comment on the comments. This makes me sad to think about. But then I remember that we still have thriving, very weird spaces like on Tezos or what is happening with blockchain contract based art where strange things can percolate but still have access to a worldwide market. And that makes me feel better. Indeed, indeed.
00:41:25.264 - 00:42:28.522, Speaker A: So in a sense saying a similar thing here, this is not universally true and I think what's going on, the art speaks for itself as we saw with Waffles work, as you saw last episode Masterpiece Theater, as we're gonna see here once again. Continuing on RJ Sunday, question, do we have, I guess what would be called agents here in Web3, like people who might take the output of an artist and manage how it might be released, platforms, pricing, maybe some social media, etc. Etc. For a percentage of the cut. I can think of some who I think would be very good at this. It's an interesting question, put it this way, my sense is the more I would argue that's a form of bureaucracy and maybe that's unfair. But I think the more people you get into the involved in the distribution of or in this scene in the market of digital art, the more expensive it's all going to be, the more unfair it's probably going to start to be.
00:42:28.522 - 00:43:15.780, Speaker A: And I could be totally wrong and maybe this is a necessary step. But just thinking out loud, put it this way, I think the logic of digital art with social media is actually that the artists themselves are their greatest representative and that that ultimately is who the, the collectors and the fan base, or however you want to put it, the people who are Observing. That's who they want to hear from. They don't want to hear from the agent and what is, you know, and then let's say you're a gallery and then you're dealing with some agent and you want to deal with the artist. Right. So I would argue, especially with AI, do we need an agent? Like, that's my question. And maybe we do.
00:43:15.780 - 00:43:30.768, Speaker A: Maybe I need an agent, maybe. Or, you know, so who knows? But it's a. I. I'm not sure, you know, I'm not sure. We do need that though. Tornado Rodriguez. I've already said it several times and I'll say a thousand times more.
00:43:30.768 - 00:44:01.800, Speaker A: Object is by far the best marketplace. It's hard to disagree with that in a sense, in terms of the marketplace that I keep buying and selling from. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to disagree with. Now, Subject, for those that don't know Michael Macasso and we don't have. I wish I could remember the other person's name here. Maybe it's listed. There's a programmer who's also pairing up with Subject here.
00:44:01.800 - 00:44:30.986, Speaker A: But first let's. So Subject. It's basically, we've had a kind of a long time issue now, maybe let's call it eight months with the notifications on Object being kind of, I would call it glitchy. And I love Object's website. I think they're doing a brilliant job, all the designers and everything. But it has been glitchy. Well, now we have the greatest notification tool ever, which is from Subject, courtesy of Michael Macasso and their partner on this project, who I have to.
00:44:30.986 - 00:44:54.304, Speaker A: Who I'll find on a future episode here. I'm sure they'll come up again. I will bookmark it, but look at how great this looks. So this is your new version of Notifications. And I tell you it's awesome. Like as far as me putting the show together, I load this up on. I still haven't connected my main account and I probably need to do other things just from a security perspective.
00:44:54.304 - 00:45:21.776, Speaker A: I'm not eager to connect to anything, but I've done it with secondary accounts and I'm totally impressed. So Subject xyz also Michael Macasso doing a little. Check this out. Showing pixel art to. So this is using Aseprite and we see here Michael Macasso. It's quite awesome actually. First does in blue the underdrawing just to create some guidelines and you know, does the traditional kind of boxing in.
00:45:21.776 - 00:45:41.540, Speaker A: You see that, that's how you do. Like if you go To a barge. I think they call it barg barge, you know, doing 19th century academic style drawing. That's what you do. You box stuff in first and then you kind of add the details just to get the ratios and so very cool. 10 minute video from Michael Macasso. And what we see here as well.
00:45:41.540 - 00:46:01.260, Speaker A: And here you'll actually see like how manual. Actually a lot of these pixels are surprisingly so as you go here. Right. So that, that not so manual. But watch this. You know, starts adding just little pixel by pixel here I think at the. Yeah, I mean look at that.
00:46:01.260 - 00:46:21.488, Speaker A: So anyway, just pretty cool as you see. And again doing it side by side. Right. Which is so to also give it some life and not just make it feel like a trace drawing. Right. So not a bad technique here at all from Michael Macasso. There's also from michaelmec.txt.
00:46:21.488 - 00:46:57.530, Speaker A: i'm launching a generative project on Etherlink this Thursday. So I have no idea what this is, but this looks awesome. So putting out a ton of things here. Michael Macasso, this, Cream Safa and Kristen Roose put out a music video. And because of copyright, I don't want to play super mounts, but I just want to play a little snippet here. Pretty cool. So Kristen Roo Spock.
00:46:57.530 - 00:47:11.866, Speaker A: So video by Cream Safa. Pretty rad team up there. Neo Neo. Stop mode Back home. I'm going to miss the forest and creating with my friends. And here's an original Takashi. So again, pixel art made physical.
00:47:11.866 - 00:47:35.000, Speaker A: See you next time. Bosque Grazia's family. Very interesting and cool. Speaking of which, Hermipe, look at this. We have a huge breakthrough here. At least some shared philosophy from Hermipe. Pixel art, multiple resolutions mixed in a single screen, mainly using the Mixel method.
00:47:35.000 - 00:48:19.470, Speaker A: The Mixel method activities and work creation. So I was commenting on this how we have different sized pixels rather than kind of your typical pixel art which is kind of a universal size. And then you start doing your, you know, illustrating whatever you're going to illustrate based on that universal size. Here a multiple resolutions mixed in a single screen is being highlighted, mainly using the Mixel method. And part of the joy of Hermipe's works. This is part of a solo exhibition, I believe in Japan. Is there anything else here? This exhibition, let's just see.
00:48:19.470 - 00:48:54.420, Speaker A: There's also nostalgia. Hermipe is an artist known for his meticulous and unique writing style where novelty and nostalgia coexist with pixel art as his main focus. There is something else. This exhibition will present works focusing on risographs and woodblock prints. So again, traveling through the medium is very powerful, especially in woodblock printing. We use finely separated prints, combining them like collages or daringly adding a slip, trying to create new expressions in an approach beyond the traditional framework of printmaking. Works which are inherently replicates.
00:48:54.420 - 00:49:24.410, Speaker A: So super interesting. And exhibiting since 2016, and it's worked with all sorts of Adidas and all sorts of people. Here's some more. Look at this. So here, this is Hermipe. I'm pretty sure it is. And do you see what's going on here? Can you see this? This is a surveillance camera done, I believe, with wood block, which gives us this wonderful texture here.
00:49:24.410 - 00:49:46.558, Speaker A: And you have to even just like the composition of this. This is a stunning work here by Hermipe. Let's just continue. And so, yeah, I mean, and look at even the signature, the one of six. How beautifully done it is. This is awesome. Totally awesome here.
00:49:46.558 - 00:50:16.760, Speaker A: Here's another one where you see two colors. Not sure this is posted by someone else. I'm not sure if this is a screen print or what, so. But more interesting work from Hermit Bay. Here's another one, Swing by solo exhibition. And so this looks digital, if I had to guess, cactus buds. But you see the Mixel style, right? The Mixel method.
00:50:16.760 - 00:50:38.276, Speaker A: You see the tiny pixels, you see the big pixels, right? And what do you get? You get contrast. And here you see the different lines here, the different kind of patterning. Powerful. Here's another work by Hermipe. A big crab. And you see all of the different ways. Red Crab Murder Mystery.
00:50:38.276 - 00:50:55.040, Speaker A: It kind of looks like the COVID of a book, doesn't it? Book cover. It is. Book cover. Book design. So very interesting. So, and here, one more time, pushing things here. So I don't know, let's see if we can make this larger.
00:50:55.040 - 00:51:37.920, Speaker A: What do you notice here? Can you see this? Let's see how big we can make this. What do you see here? I see that's not pixelation, right? This is like printing dots that you'd find like the Ben Day dots that you'd find in a comic book. Right? But then here we have these hard edges, but it's more with like the, you know, getting the grays, but done. So combining pixel art with the printing. Right. Again, traveling through the mediums. And what it does is it brings to life pixel art in a whole other way, in a physical format rather than just hitting print, which sometimes is legit.
00:51:37.920 - 00:51:59.812, Speaker A: Okay. But quite interesting here. And finally, Element Li. What on earth is element Li doing here. It looks very interesting. You know what it kind of reminds me of was the artist we were looking at just recently who does all the printed works and took the Apple ad and then we'll put a work on top whose name I always forget. Famous.
00:51:59.812 - 00:52:45.430, Speaker A: Famous contemporary art person. Yeah, it's just on the tip of my tongue here, but kind of reminds me of feeding in kind of found pieces of paper into the printer and then printing out stuff. And what is this? This looks like an element Lee work, doesn't it? It looks like an element Li pixel artwork and then maybe done with ascii, but printed ascii again, traveling through the mediums. And finally, I'm not sure if we looked at this or not. As you can see uxine with what looks like we may have looked at this before, I'm not sure. But a homemade screen print, I'm pretty sure, which is a feature. You know, getting all these drips and all these imperfections and everything.
00:52:45.430 - 00:53:08.324, Speaker A: There's a physical uxine. So beautiful work from Uxene. As we dive into the works here, 52 minutes in. Here is guess who it is. Yuri Jade 2 Gastau's 100 people. This is on Verse so work series exhibition, I think put together by Artie hands of Yuri J's work. Starting bid $111.
00:53:08.324 - 00:53:28.660, Speaker A: I think it starts today, November 25th. That is today at 7pm and so here is your preview of this auction here. And there's the paper airplane again. I love that image. And here, more kitchen work. So cooking and a different kind of fill here. I've never seen this patterning that I can recollect.
00:53:28.660 - 00:53:49.886, Speaker A: So keeping it new and keeping it super textured. And again, these are looking like paintings, aren't they? They're looking like full on digital paintings. And so these all start at only 0.03 ETH at the auction. That is what they start at. And here is another one. And you see the fridge.
00:53:49.886 - 00:54:09.806, Speaker A: So more interiors here. Interesting perspective. You know, that's my big question with Yuri J's work is where are these compositions coming from? Are they from Yuri J's head? And they're pretty impressive. They're unique. I mean, it really adds. Not only does Yuri Jay have a very interesting process. Filters on filters.
00:54:09.806 - 00:54:43.190, Speaker A: And taking, you know, again, as I always say here, the mosaic filter, you know, the unusable mosaic filter. And making it like a signature. Amazingly, not only does has these great textures, has this original, you know, you see the wall here, where you don't even see like where the wall ends, it just continues with the patterning across. Not only do you have that, but you have pretty interesting compositions here, even down to the, you know, window. And then you see outside. Quite interesting. Here's another one in search of clean dishes.
00:54:43.190 - 00:55:12.908, Speaker A: And here, let's see. And I think this is full size, but we can zoom in a little bit here. And so here you see a stove and everything. So another interesting, kind of like, you know, a freehanded version of a kitchen, as you can see here. Not worrying about making this perfect perspective. If anything, it's embracing just the freehandedness, similar to what we saw with Michael Macasso. Let's not worry if you make it too perfect, it starts to look kind of boring.
00:55:12.908 - 00:55:27.592, Speaker A: This is not perfect. And that is the charm here. So another kitchen. So rad works here from Yuri J. Now here's room for artists. And this is an edition of 40 for 10 tezos. I picked up one of these works here.
00:55:27.592 - 00:55:54.014, Speaker A: And this is pretty funny. Almost looks like a. I think it's referring to maybe a tweet about this. This, you know, shared contract and everything. So here just looks like a bad. And almost looking photographic over here, isn't it? It almost looks like photography has been inserted in here, interestingly. So another interesting piece.
00:55:54.014 - 00:56:13.890, Speaker A: This is from Yuri JJJJJJJ, the second Yurij account. That is 10 taizo still available. Here's Gozo. A sweet lie. So another super interesting work here. As you see the gorgeous textures here, kind of pixelated. Again, digital collage.
00:56:13.890 - 00:56:44.592, Speaker A: Kind of a surreal feel to it, as you can see here. And great color as usual. And those stable diffusion textures. I think just to cap it all off, beautiful, beautiful work. Would love to see this printed, like weirdly. I mean, one of the many ways you could do this. But this one, because it's so textured in the work itself, you could probably just do inkjet on a really fabulous paper and it would probably look really good.
00:56:44.592 - 00:57:22.006, Speaker A: If you use like archival inks and this sort of thing, it would probably look really good, you know, and then you frame it here on the wall of an Airbnb dance while you can. Ed Morola. So interesting work here. Almost a bit of a photographic feel, but I don't think so. At least in the background here as you look at the cliffs, what looks like cliffs and a couple of dancers who are kind of, as you see, kind of get some. Not rasterization, but kind of just like some digital textures. So what is the word I am looking for here? Words Fail today.
00:57:22.006 - 00:57:52.076, Speaker A: But as you see here, a couple of outlines, couple of figures here in an interesting, almost organic looking background here. It almost looks photographic. Dance while you can. Edition of 21, 10 Tezos each by Ed Morola. Here's another one and I think this is for the art Art for Artists Collective. Drop to dream of art at the mouth of a cave. And as you see here, so an interesting kind of almost like a nativity scene to a certain degree, but maybe not.
00:57:52.076 - 00:58:22.310, Speaker A: Maybe something completely different. So interesting cave here and all sorts of different processes and techniques been used here. As you see this almost texture that's being moved through the works and then this beautifully beautiful frame. Love the color and design of the frame. 251 editions for one Tezos each and 205 left. And here's one more PP Umutogandi. And this is an edition of 25 for 10 Tezos.
00:58:22.310 - 00:58:52.910, Speaker A: Interesting piece here. More interesting pixel art from Ed Morola. And here's Greg Nikshumika. Never waste a good fall. And so kind of a cool almost like could hang in an Ed Morola show or in the same room here. Kind of seems to have a sampled brush maybe and looking like a nature work of some fall trees in autumn is what it looks like. Edition of 10 and sold out at 250 or 33 tezos.
00:58:52.910 - 00:59:14.574, Speaker A: And here's Kudukola with an interesting work. And again, could kind of hang in that Ed Morala show I was just describing. Look at the carpet. Love the carpet. And then someone at a computer here. Again, kind of freehand, right? Freehand digital drawing combined with some stretching things here. And then it has a little bit of kind of patterning.
00:59:14.574 - 00:59:57.630, Speaker A: So you're getting this interesting contrast. Maybe that's what we delight in in Yuri J. As you see here, which is the freehand as well as Ed Morola, which is freehandedness, so to speak. I'm not going to worry about getting this computer perfect. I'm just going to draw it freehand. But then that is contrasting with geometric precision of this patterning or this line being stretched perfectly, or this line being stretched perfectly, or the repetition of this kind of sampled brush but then making it kind of chaotic. We're kind of back to Escher, right? We're seeing some order, some chaos and these mixing well together to create pretty cool result.
00:59:57.630 - 01:00:11.374, Speaker A: Another interesting piece, I believe. Cedar Plank, his dribble waffle retweeted. I think both these works out. Play with my heart. Interesting piece. Cuda Cola. Very experimental work here.
01:00:11.374 - 01:00:42.194, Speaker A: So just interesting art here. On the blockchain. Play With My heart edition of 1 for 10 Tezos by Kudukola. Here is Sols and a new one, Ingenuo edition of 2. And pretty wild, kind of. I'd say not quite abstract, but I'd say experimental digital artist, as you see here. You see what looks like a horse with a flower in their mouth and all sorts of kind of almost like noise, like texture here.
01:00:42.194 - 01:00:58.514, Speaker A: Pretty interesting piece. Nice gradients, working with a frame. Different size on top than at the bottom. Wild work here. Ten Tezos edition of two. Here's Bedalla. Early winter and indeed it is in Canada here.
01:00:58.514 - 01:01:29.024, Speaker A: So nice textures here. And yeah, kind of classic, kind of Bedala like lines here. Line work recognizably so. Edition of 15 and sold out at 3tezos. Nice work. Continuing on here is Louis JPD. Bespoke and so interesting kind of combination of illustration and what else? I mean, how was this made? Is sort of what I wonder to myself.
01:01:29.024 - 01:01:57.920, Speaker A: Is this a brush? Is this generative art? What is this? Is this a drawing that has been put into some sort of filter of sorts and then this is the result. Who knows? Pretty interesting piece from Louis jpd. Great color there too. Here is Enigmatras or ASCII artist here. And this. This looks like flowers and butterflies. We're seeing a ton of butterflies.
01:01:57.920 - 01:02:23.556, Speaker A: I'm not sure why. And so as you see here, we have outlines, we have visual ascii, we have texture, we have everything. And interestingly, monochromatic kind of grays and blacks and whites. Interesting piece, almost always keeping it new and interesting work here. Such a creative artist. Enigmatra is ASCII Explorations number two. And is this the.
01:02:23.556 - 01:02:40.180, Speaker A: I guess maybe that is. So this is the show. I see. So here are all the works now posted by Enigmatris on Superrare. So actually posting quite a few. I wonder if they're all sold. 10 artworks, total sales, so no sales so far, but let's see what happens.
01:02:40.180 - 01:03:02.380, Speaker A: So interesting. I thought that was a work unto itself and maybe it is here. Interestingly nice cover photo on Superrare there. Let's continue a walk with a work called Blood. And it kind of looks familiar here. Almost looks like some sort of architectural structure. I want to say England, but I have no idea.
01:03:02.380 - 01:03:17.624, Speaker A: Anyway, interesting piece. Interesting title. Edition of two or open edition. Five tezos each. Four more hours to go. Here is Michi Asu, souvenir photo number 196. So Michi Asu putting out a ton of work.
01:03:17.624 - 01:03:48.612, Speaker A: And here's just a sample of this kind of wild, more experimental digital art here. And you know, if you saw this once and then there's only one work, you might go, okay, not sure what to make of that. If you go to Mishiyasu's page, you'll see so much work. So this builds credibility, right? Because clearly Mishiyasu is exploring something here. And so pretty interesting artist. I mean, this is great. I was like, did I get that one? I wish I'd got that one.
01:03:48.612 - 01:04:04.640, Speaker A: So it's super interesting. I mean, that's back in September. First you see how much work is coming out, which also builds credibility. Kazuhiro Ehara Stack your true eyeballs. Not be fooled by the old games. So Here, edition of 1123 Tezos. Look at this.
01:04:04.640 - 01:04:47.624, Speaker A: What on earth is going on here, right? Is it physical? Is it digital? Is it AI? Is it everything? Is it none of the above? Wild, kind of almost like a diagonal canvas here. Very painterly. Pretty cool work. Not even sure what's going on here. Remember the cloud that I that we started with on this show maybe three weeks ago, four weeks ago, Same artist, right? So let me just bring that up here. There's the cloud, that brilliant cloud. What an interesting artist, right? Here's another work that we missed.
01:04:47.624 - 01:05:00.168, Speaker A: Dr. All Time High never fails to look at this. Kind of has the same feeling. It's almost like elements have been replaced in the cloud. Very interesting. So super interesting artists. Let's continue time.
01:05:00.168 - 01:05:24.960, Speaker A: AKA Santiago, with a cool colored, almost negative. Looks like an inverted version of one of these abstracts. Very nice piece here from Santiago. And there is the pump in the background there. Zebeisterio is the account. I'm pretty sure we've looked at their work before on Tezos. And here it is on Instagram.
01:05:24.960 - 01:05:54.520, Speaker A: Kind of small here, but here just very interesting digital painting here again, you see. And yeah, here are some of the examples of previous works. Like, again, you see the true experimentation, the true artistry of art on the blockchain. Like, it's not all easy, right? So pretty cool work. Here's RJ Anomaly. Cool work here. Almost looking like two figures, not sure.
01:05:54.520 - 01:06:13.588, Speaker A: And big, chunky purple background here. Great color on this one. Great textures and everything. And quite abstract. Almost within these seeming, these bodies here, as you see the foot there. Nice piece. And here's some interesting abstracts here from rj.
01:06:13.588 - 01:06:35.810, Speaker A: So here is one work, almost like these color field paintings. Here is another one. Pixel fields. Yeah, like color fields, right. It reminds you of almost like what Rothko's doing here to a certain Degree everything and nothing different kind of texture or size of pixel. So interesting abstracts from rj. Here's Vozo.
01:06:35.810 - 01:07:12.094, Speaker A: Wild, wild work. Let me maximize this. If you stare into the butterfly, like novel digital experience here. I think I almost hit stop recording there. That would have been catastrophic. So astral travel, that is by Zozo. 15 Tazo.
01:07:12.094 - 01:07:26.010, Speaker A: Still available. Edition of 15. And they're moving. And Yuri J just picked one up. Nine gone. Here's a really cool work which was part of the art for artists drop. And this is an edition of 88 by Sabato.
01:07:26.010 - 01:07:45.334, Speaker A: Sensational colors here and great concept. Just fish and loaves of bread. Almost biblical in subject matter here. And I have to say, the colors are stunning. The pink and the blue and then these big kind of yellow, orange pieces of bread just repeated. The fish repeated. So digital.
01:07:45.334 - 01:08:00.866, Speaker A: And then this great little gradient in the background to add just a little bit of complexity in the background. Totally awesome. Picked one up eight tezos. This is great too. So might be hard to see. Let's see if we can make this bigger. Nice.
01:08:00.866 - 01:08:19.332, Speaker A: Okay, so here is Sophie Agura. Let me just make sure I have her name right. Sophie O. Gore, if I can pronounce that right. Check this out. So this is interactive, so I press with. I think it should be maybe.
01:08:19.332 - 01:08:45.334, Speaker A: There we go. Look at that. So pretty original. I've been collecting a ton of Sophie's work recently because there's something very unique about it and just kind of unapologetically her own very defined style has been minting for a long time. So anyway, super duper interesting work made days. Interesting title. Edition of 8.
01:08:45.334 - 01:09:05.350, Speaker A: And I think that's sold out, actually. One's available on secondary for 15, so nice work. Francois Gamma. This is on Instagram. I'm not sure if this has been minted somewhere, but pretty rad. As you see here, it kind of looks like a face, but done with this whatever. It almost looks like a.
01:09:05.350 - 01:09:27.380, Speaker A: Who knows what kind of processing has been done here. But again, when I describe us, you know, kind of scratching the surface of digital art, you know, you think of Francois Gamma and the million iterations. One of the things I love about Francois Gamma is how they mint everything. As far as I know, or almost everything. Like, it's awesome. This was cool too. I'm not sure if this is new or old.
01:09:27.380 - 01:09:45.226, Speaker A: Let there be bits. And there is Michelangelo's Last Judge not Last Judgment, Sistine Chapel, the Creation of Adam. The hand here, the touch. And there are zeros and ones coming out of it. If you can see that. Totally awesome. By Gogolitis.
01:09:45.226 - 01:09:57.898, Speaker A: Here's another work, Aurora of Fire by Gogolitis. And that looks sold. Oh, no accepting offers. Nice offers coming in here. 20 tezos. I mean, that's $26. So, you know.
01:09:57.898 - 01:10:17.580, Speaker A: So artists doing very well here on Tezos. Nice kind of sunrise here. Aurora of Fire. This was, I think, retweeted by Gogolitis maybe about a week ago. Very cool artists here. Who is the artist? Hopefully this doesn't make everything disappear. And I think, okay, gelatin.
01:10:17.580 - 01:10:37.810, Speaker A: Very cool work here. Kind of pixel art, almost like a poster, but still kind of arty. Very interesting work. Here is Buju Bunoing. And this is on seal art. And so more interesting pixel art. There's a Rubik's Cube, kind of chaotic, in a good way.
01:10:37.810 - 01:11:01.216, Speaker A: Crisis of the Bubblegum is the name of the work. And here is, I think Pinky Blue is the name, as you see here. And let me actually just do this. Pinky Blue. And so here's the large version. So this is an on Chain. NFT on Tezos.
01:11:01.216 - 01:11:22.912, Speaker A: And as I think maybe Tornado was saying. Let me see if we have the original post. Welcome to the insanely wonderful Pixel Master Pinky Blue to this crazy on chain world. So it's on Chain. And there is the work. This tiny work here again, the delight in these tiny works that can be expanded infinitely. Size 12 kilobytes done using Aseprite.
01:11:22.912 - 01:11:41.208, Speaker A: So quite a complex. 281 by 280. Quite a complex image here. And so interesting. I think when you use black, it saves kilobytes. So I think that's because usually this size would be about 6 kilobytes or 7. But I think because there's no black.
01:11:41.208 - 01:11:59.812, Speaker A: Because I think black is just no color, I suspect. So interesting cool work here. I went for 52 tezos. So on Chain really does get people's attention. Here's Element lynch juxtaposition as an aesthetical or research method. Very cool. Very cool notes here.
01:11:59.812 - 01:12:17.412, Speaker A: Exactly. There's a lot to be said for this juxtaposition as an aesthetical or research method. Very well done. I want to put out the clap emoji for Element Li here. Juxtaposition with meaning. Juxtaposition just for novelty. Super interesting.
01:12:17.412 - 01:12:36.850, Speaker A: 256x256. Interesting research from Element Li. Here's another work, Amphora, 256 by 300 pixels. Almost looks like a little bit of an octopus there. So interesting piece. Another on Chain work the sting. And let's see if I can make this larger.
01:12:36.850 - 01:12:52.800, Speaker A: This is by Kyle Flemmer. Introducing text here as well as you see. So maybe the Scorpius. I love how it's all here. Even the title is in this work here. This on chain work. I did that with the Pixel Art Inferno.
01:12:52.800 - 01:13:26.810, Speaker A: I put the title of the thing so that you don't need anything else because maybe this metadata, who knows? It's kind of nice to just have everything all inclusive and look at how great it looks. This tiling that we're seeing in video games now being applied to create art. Microcosmos series. This is for 50 tezos at auction. Here's just a work posted by Kappen and I'm not sure if I've ever seen this one before, but a beautiful like still pixel artwork from Kappen and almost looks like a rock or a person here. Great color and even the stars. Super interesting.
01:13:26.810 - 01:14:08.790, Speaker A: Here's Gio Mariani, a couple of works posted on X and getting a nice reception here. So I think these might be older, but I'm not sure. So just wanted to show in case they're new and if they're not, well, they're still pretty darn interesting to look at here. So a very pioneering kind of pixel artist on Tezos influenced a lot of people like Ed Morola early on in 2021. Here is Star angel by 2002. And this is on Zora and so more interesting experimental pixel art here. I guess it's kind of an abstract, but maybe, you know, hard to say what's going on here.
01:14:08.790 - 01:14:32.770, Speaker A: Kind of minimal colors here. Star Angel 64, interesting piece. 128 minted. That's pretty good. Eboy Arts for Google Play at GStar 2024 agency. So Eboy the duo, I think out of Germany. Again, pioneering pixel artists from like, I think early 2000s, if I'm not mistaken here.
01:14:32.770 - 01:15:05.638, Speaker A: I guess pretty well known as pioneering pixel artists as well. So here a cool work that they got commissioned for Google Play. So pixel art continuing to kind of seep into the collective consciousness here. Here's Stip and Pixel Ethereal Echoes. So a few works here, as you see. I almost want to call them primitives of digital art. You know, there's these categories, like there's glitch, there's pixel art, and we got a few here by StippinPixel.
01:15:05.638 - 01:15:27.530, Speaker A: Right. And yeah, it's just kind of interesting. Let's continue Stippin Pixel Nebula Nook as we finish up here. So similar color scheme, kind of A haunted cloud over top of this pixel art house in the winter. And slightly different color scheme here. Glimmer Glade. And here again, kind of a sci fi situation.
01:15:27.530 - 01:15:53.932, Speaker A: And this house that's growing. So kind of interesting pieces here. Edition of one that went to Mech TXT for 50 Tezos offer here is Kyle Flemmer again. Hello Kitty. Interesting piece here. And I think we've seen other works, I believe from Kyle Flemmer in this series where he just takes a stamp, so to speak, and then uses it to the point of making an abstract out of it. I think this is super interesting.
01:15:53.932 - 01:16:10.140, Speaker A: Just nice and simple. And that's the beauty of it, is the simplicity and it gets quite complex within the image itself. Edition of 10 for 350. Super interesting work. And here is Sgam. I think Gogolites retweeted this one. Let's see if we can make it bigger.
01:16:10.140 - 01:16:30.470, Speaker A: So again, kind of pixel art meets video games as a GIF GM pixel art. So very cool. Let's see how it did. 13. Pretty good reception here, isn't it? So the people loving it. Morphogenetic grid, this by Figments, also known as Kappen. So a new work here.
01:16:30.470 - 01:16:57.540, Speaker A: So kind of a more complex one. Bit more of a maximal work by Kappen. Cool title here again, that's under Figments. And then here is Brain Dead, who as you see here, the cards playing with trading cards. But maybe replacing the spades with the skull or the heart with a skull. Pretty cool. You could probably actually make physicals of these at this point and just order them yourself.
01:16:57.540 - 01:17:12.940, Speaker A: Or like Brain Dead can make their own series. That's what I'm trying to say. This is not a test. Brain Dead. So a cool kind of illustration. So coming out of the. I think it was October or November where there's a pixel artwork every day.
01:17:12.940 - 01:17:42.726, Speaker A: Continuing with that trademark kind of colorful gray 0.03 eth, here's Pamelo Cirone. Just a nice simple work. Perks pixel art, bit of texture and this person kind of sideways here you see the fun and the energy of and the color of Pamela Cirone's work. Here's our milk. Love this work. It had kind of an interesting feeling where it's almost using an operating system again to create a landscape.
01:17:42.726 - 01:18:08.070, Speaker A: As you see Almost the Windows 98 in the background, the sky, as well as operating system elements that are being kind of used to create again like an urban streetscape here. And I love the graffiti. It's kind of the nice finishing touch. And even down Here. It almost looks like a magic wand type situation here. Super interesting work from Armilk. Not sure if this has been minted anywhere.
01:18:08.070 - 01:18:36.022, Speaker A: There's no info there. And here's another super interesting work by Rmilk, again using Windows operating system elements to create a chopper. And very cool animation here. And also Elna, Frederick, let's go here. And what is this? Chandek 56 and kind of looks like an open window and a remote control on a table. Very cool there. Here's Nicholas Sassoon.
01:18:36.022 - 01:18:59.970, Speaker A: Good morning. And just a cool, seemingly abstract work, but not entirely sure. These diamonds kind of moving across. Go to Nicholas Sassoon's website if you want to see these things in kind of full blast. They're quite spectacular. Here's Sunrise by Gino as we wrap up the show here. So looks like combining a few different ways of processing things.
01:18:59.970 - 01:19:16.890, Speaker A: Kind of looks like some pixel art. Kind of looks like some analog video glitch. As you see here, quite a few different effects. 256 colors. Edition of 10 and sold out at five tezos, I believe. And here's another one. This is by LB Shooting Star.
01:19:16.890 - 01:19:36.630, Speaker A: So cool work here. And this is an edition of 10 for 5 Tezos. And here is Primordial coast by Exmortal. That is an edition of seven and selling. And that is 15 tezos. And it sold for so a lower edition. Now 77 tezos on secondary.
01:19:36.630 - 01:20:04.134, Speaker A: So another cool kind of landscape from X Mortal. And here's another one, a fragment here. I don't know if this was posted anywhere. Very cool fragment, beautifully done by xmortal. Here is LB again, Karaoke Dreams. And an interesting kind of almost using Windows iconography with a window in the background or, sorry, a dolphin in the background. Cool work there.
01:20:04.134 - 01:20:34.496, Speaker A: As we go into AI with Skamra Girl at Boy Beach. And so beautiful textures here from Skamra with this AI kind of digital painting, a glade called Stable Diffusion. So more fascinating textures here. It kind of looks like a farmer's field beside a tilled farmer's field beside a forest, maybe. Beautiful novel. Another Internet artist work. This is an edition of 30 and a little bit of animation here interestingly within the painting as well as in the background up here as well.
01:20:34.496 - 01:20:53.578, Speaker A: And look at these textures over here. I mean, pretty spectacular. Like new visual experiences here. The Birth of Venus. Once again, AI artwork from Scomra. And I think this is full. Is this full? Here we go.
01:20:53.578 - 01:21:11.002, Speaker A: And almost looking like you see Photoshop on the right there. Interesting animation as well, hovering through this piece. And here, alternate timeline. Interesting. Probably AI composition, but not positive. And look at these kind of edges here. These textures.
01:21:11.002 - 01:21:20.578, Speaker A: So super. Fascinating work from Skamra. That's 5 Tezos edition of 10. Here's time, also known as Santiago. Best weekend ever. Number three. I think we saw Best weekend ever.
01:21:20.578 - 01:21:32.030, Speaker A: Number four the other day. As you see another massive file here. Interesting piece. And here, Making crypto art. This one was awesome. This came out November 10th. And this is sold out also by Time.
01:21:32.030 - 01:21:46.644, Speaker A: And so pretty hilarious. A little bit of humor here, too. And making crypto art here. And look at these. This kind of brushwork or this pen marks. These textures again in this work. Again, AI artwork.
01:21:46.644 - 01:22:00.160, Speaker A: Pretty sure raw AI. Here's Lily Illo. More time in the garden. Another AI artwork. These people in suits here all joined together. Speaking of which, I need to run out of here. White Solitude with a work.
01:22:00.160 - 01:22:17.690, Speaker A: And here, more AI digital painting. Look at how convincing this looks and how just impressive it all looks. This is an edition of one. November 20th. Available for 50 tezos. AI artwork and William Burroughs by Mikey Wilson. Junkie.
01:22:17.690 - 01:22:38.970, Speaker A: So interesting to see AI's take. It almost looks like the COVID Like, loose. You can almost see. Literary Outlaw, I think was the COVID Should we look really quickly? Literary? This is a pretty good. I don't really read biographies anymore because I find they're too. Oh, no, let me see. I added maybe a different version.
01:22:38.970 - 01:22:55.268, Speaker A: Oh, no, this was Literary Outlaw. I'm thinking of a different Burroughs biography. This is a famous one by Ted Morgan. But they. I find them too. These biographies are so romanticized in general. Whoever it is, the figures become larger than life.
01:22:55.268 - 01:23:02.148, Speaker A: I. I don't really like reading them anymore. I just. I just find them unrealistic. Maybe. Let's continue. Martin.
01:23:02.148 - 01:23:09.494, Speaker A: Just the way everything's portrayed. It's funny. It's not my favorite thing. Martin. Joe. GM Little bears. Nice.
01:23:09.494 - 01:23:24.454, Speaker A: GM Bears with Martin. With a bit of a space theme on this one. Pink spacesuit on the bear drinking coffee. Love it. And here's Human Boy Fall. Part of a few other works kind of in this series. So almost looking like a photograph that has been processed with AI.
01:23:24.454 - 01:23:40.816, Speaker A: And a lot of movement here. Edition of 5. And that is for 10 tezos on object. And here's no Hygiene with another wild work here. I don't know if we looked at this one, but if we did, here it is again. The meat and the girl crying. Where's.
01:23:40.816 - 01:23:55.504, Speaker A: I don't see an angel, though. So more wild work. AI artwork. Here's a beautiful work by Toukes here. Different color scheme. Pretty cool. Again, just endless novelty out here in the good sense.
01:23:55.504 - 01:24:07.066, Speaker A: Kenneth Zappata. Look at this. So kind of a landscape here. I think AI. We'll ask Cannex Appetite about that. Here's Violet Tripp. I think AI.
01:24:07.066 - 01:24:29.252, Speaker A: You know, a computer in this kind of beautiful, kind of natural landscape. This pink computer almost looking like a 1980s computer as we go into physical in the final minutes here. Bundesl Bandido. John Cage and a new page. So there's John Cage playing the piano, I guess. Very cool work here. Smaller artwork from Bondozo Bandido not available.
01:24:29.252 - 01:24:44.004, Speaker A: Interesting. Probably already sold. It's not gallery posting. Mark Martin Lucas. Cool LA Dodgers logo on this figure here and beautifully painted. So simple, so simple, so interesting. Here is Walk newsletter.
01:24:44.004 - 01:25:05.358, Speaker A: Subscribe now. Capturing the zeitgeist as ever. Here's Martin Bruce, 100 x 70 cm oil on canvas. And let's make this larger. Interesting, interesting work as ever from visual. The guy who thinks, you know, he thinks with his eyes, as I like to say of Martin Bruce. And there's Little Cat, a little.
01:25:05.358 - 01:25:17.794, Speaker A: Just another wild oil on, I think canvas. That was, ooh, this Spider Man. It's not gallery. Again, tribal curtains. It's not gallery. I mean, this is a wild. Such an inventive piece.
01:25:17.794 - 01:25:35.870, Speaker A: Just to do Spider Man's costume like this is super interesting. And then there's all the other imagery, the wings and the guns. Wild work. Craig Barack the View, oil on linen. Kind of has a bit of a Moto Hero feel to. To it, doesn't it? Just a tiny bit. Very nice painting here.
01:25:35.870 - 01:25:56.780, Speaker A: And here is Jesse Makinson with a drawing. Let's make this a little smaller. And so let's do this, do this beautiful drawing here. And this is again, Jesse Makinson. Here's another one. This is in Milan through January 25th. So this artist's doing very, very well, as you can see.
01:25:56.780 - 01:26:23.840, Speaker A: Kind of this new surreal kind of art that you're seeing. Kind of new wave of surrealism. Here's another work, this Lava Baby by I think Lava Baby maybe is the artist. And as you see here, again, just like this statuesque woman, you know, about to ski down the stairs. So again, more just kind of this Neo surrealism, I want to call it. Michael Pyblas, Black Mirror. Kate Perry.
01:26:23.840 - 01:26:53.160, Speaker A: So doing a tweet as a subject for a painting. Super interesting. And here's Atelier Adrian P. Gabrielle O/Plat Platin Gouache on paper. Again, very modern looking with the headphones and there may be DJing. Hilariously. A pretty nice modern contemporary artwork, isn't it? Here is O Shohei, whose work we looked at, started the show with about a month ago.
01:26:53.160 - 01:27:13.904, Speaker A: And look at this jacket. So a super interesting piece here. And here are the different. And there is a jacket kind of similar in spirit. Super cool work from Ochihei Shohei. And here's Night Gallery with a cool work by Bamboo Gilly at Art Basel, Miami Beach. Interesting colors here.
01:27:13.904 - 01:27:36.588, Speaker A: Super interesting artwork. Kind of looks like oil on canvas, if I had to guess. Oil on linen, 60 by 84. So quite large, 60 inches by 84 inches. Jerry Meyer, Sheep Love so playing with JPEGization, JPEG artifacts and then making them physical. Right? Super interesting there. Here's more work by them.
01:27:36.588 - 01:28:01.300, Speaker A: So quite powerful take on pixelation and increasing the size of pixelated works. Mark Belden, Lawn Chair this is fabulous. This is gouache on Saint Armand paper. So sold as part of artist support pledge. And here's my friend Ben. I'm not sure if we looked at this one, this beautiful version of Van Gogh's room. Just awesome.
01:28:01.300 - 01:28:26.776, Speaker A: I think we might have looked at this, but let's look at it again. Beautiful work here. I think that's spray paint in the back of the wall part of Bamberlin until Sunday. So I think that just passed. And Moto Motohiro putting some works together in the notebook here, putting some pages together. As you see this train here, full of people, this human train. Just more fascinating artwork from the super inventive artist.
01:28:26.776 - 01:28:47.384, Speaker A: And here's Wok again with a wok figure, let's say. And there's the wok currency at $13,000. Hilarious. And make war not art. So more satire, one assumes, from Wok here. So again, just kind of on the on on the zeitgeist there. Capturing the zeitgeist.
01:28:47.384 - 01:29:08.086, Speaker A: Noah Verrier. Finally, my oil paintings will be on CBS Sunday morning. Okay, so Noah Verrier doing very, very well. And there's the set. I mean, amazing. And these wonderful kind of contemporary paintings or paintings of contemporary imagery, but done in like a traditional style. A wonderful contrast here, as you see with the toasted cheese sandwich.
01:29:08.086 - 01:29:30.300, Speaker A: And finally, Ilya Beribin with what looks like a merry go round or a I can't remember what you call these beautiful drawing here, though. GM 2024. And that is your show, everybody. Thank you for joining me and thank you for everything. And I hope to post another show the next few days. Until then, take care.
