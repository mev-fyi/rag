00:00:06.080 - 00:00:29.798, Speaker A: I may have scheduled my haircut a little too far in the future. It's on Thursday, so we'll see how this goes here. I may have to cancel an episode or two, depending on the situation. Artist journal, October 3, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokobelli. I welcome you back. As usual, a ton to get through.
00:00:29.798 - 00:00:56.310, Speaker A: I'm going to try and keep these shorter because yesterday is just kind of like it's too long. We can't expect anybody, you know, to watch this every day, but I appreciate those that do watch it. I appreciate the likes that people have. You know, I put zero. I don't tell anybody to subscribe. I don't tell anybody to like because I feel like the more you do that, the more you kind of owe people because you're asking them to do something for you. And I don't want to owe anybody anything.
00:00:56.310 - 00:01:21.344, Speaker A: You know, I love, just like this is my public journal, okay. And I don't need to put anybody or anything. And it's just, it's free and that makes it zero pressure for me. It makes it fun or probably a better program. And yeah, and that's why it's easy. I look forward to it, which is kind of fun. I was telling my mom yesterday, she brought up a very important point, too.
00:01:21.344 - 00:01:47.374, Speaker A: It's not still lives, it's still lifes. It's the plural of still life is still lifesaver, not still live. So thanks, mom. Hi to mom. So very, very, very interesting development over here onto the show. Combination of AI and painting and digital painting. I'm sure this has happened before, but it is the first time it's crossed my desk here.
00:01:47.374 - 00:02:15.252, Speaker A: So I am very interested in that very quick, nameless artist here. So we're going to come back to that in a second. First, a very big shout out to, to thisisme tez for sending me this john work I was discussing. Last episode. Had nothing from John. I think it's carroll. Is his name John Carroll? And so thisisme tez sent me a classic here.
00:02:15.252 - 00:02:37.964, Speaker A: This looks like one of the classics. Like look at this, 2496 of these things and they're still selling for three tezos and 19 tezos sense. So pretty impressive. Windows still life 100. So I finally have a john work in the collection. So thank you again to thisisme Tez. I had a good laugh when I saw that this morning.
00:02:37.964 - 00:03:09.120, Speaker A: Very quickly, Ollie Issykoski, who is a very nice, friendly Twitter personality, feel free to follow Ollie on Twitter, wrote just a very interesting tweet I found this on Reddit signum loans at Signum Defi loans with NFTs as a collateral. Okay. Hmm. On tazos. Interesting. I would love to have your thoughts. Adrian Pokebelly seems very lucrative, but I remain a skeptic.
00:03:09.120 - 00:03:27.190, Speaker A: Time will tell, I guess. Yeah, I'd be extremely careful is sort of how I'd treat this. I looked and, yeah, it was like 2000% apr. I looked this morning. It's already down to 700%. 12 hours later. Yeah, I wouldn't connect your wallet to this.
00:03:27.190 - 00:03:54.310, Speaker A: If you want to have fun, do a burner wallet in a different browser is how I would treat this. This definitely has 2021 vibes. And what we learned in 2021 in Defi, I think, is that you can't make money out of thin air unless you're, I guess, a central bank. But that's beside the point. You can't, like, the economic law will prevail. We saw that with Celsius. We saw that with all these things blowing up.
00:03:54.310 - 00:04:19.934, Speaker A: Economic laws are real. Okay. And that prevails. So, as I put it here, seems a little too good to be true. 2000% APR, that was yesterday, when currencies, bonds, cryptos, and stocks are tanking. If it looks too good to be true, it probably is. Be extremely careful, and nothing against signum.
00:04:19.934 - 00:04:37.944, Speaker A: This could be a great protocol. Okay, so. But those are my thoughts. Let's proceed with extreme caution. If you are going to go and use this and use a burner wallet and don't put up anything for collateral that you don't want to lose is what I would say. So zero financial advice. Just be extremely careful.
00:04:37.944 - 00:04:58.872, Speaker A: Purple drank as another pepe work. Savage sword of Pepe drank, frazetta and savage sword of Pepe seven. I need to pick this up. It's another awesome work again on ethereum. Manifold XY. Or is this on foundation open edition? So he's kind of experimenting. This looks like it's on found.
00:04:58.872 - 00:05:18.484, Speaker A: Oh, no. It's manifold XYZ. This is manifold XYZ. Savage sword seven. So this is open to everybody, open to anyone to claim praise keck. So only 38 minted so far, and this is like, $5. Okay, so pretty good deal over there, so don't miss that.
00:05:18.484 - 00:05:51.318, Speaker A: For those trying to get on super rare, check out John Perkins tweet, because he is probably getting a lot of flack. Like, he put this out yesterday, I believe, October 1, so two days ago. To everyone frustrated about not hearing back from applying to super rare, we hear you. You're right. The system isn't good. And it isn't scalable. But our main focus right now is on building a totally new framework for getting listed on super rare based on decentralization and transparency.
00:05:51.318 - 00:06:11.830, Speaker A: So they are working on it over there. Go give John Perkins a follow and follow. And you can read the whole thing here. If you want to go into depth on what they are thinking. It probably doesn't hurt if you're trying to get on super rare. Read all this stuff. That only helps you give them a follow.
00:06:11.830 - 00:06:39.018, Speaker A: Put a favorite, all that stuff. It's like, oh, that's the guy. Because it doesn't sound like it's super decentralized right now. So if you're applying now, and they're probably getting a million applications, so patience and all that stuff. And Dan control. So this is just back to our kind of cross chain theme. Now, we know dancontrol from this plant here, the eraser, the cell phone.
00:06:39.018 - 00:07:08.406, Speaker A: So he just sold a work foundation. Okay. So again, it's very fun to watch the, you know, the move or the kind of just how object or Tezos artists are doing. Look at how pretty that is. Are doing on foundation or on ethereum is what I'm trying to say here. I'm not sure how much. Okay, sold for 0.1.
00:07:08.406 - 00:07:34.876, Speaker A: Okay. But in this market, and a pretty experimental piece here, you got to feel good about that. Don't forget Steve Jobs. You got to ship, you got to move your art. Don't hold onto your paintings endlessly hoping for some magical price that may never come. You have to think of your market somewhat, but you got to ship your work. That is probably the most important thing.
00:07:34.876 - 00:07:59.510, Speaker A: It gets it out there. So, congratulations to Dancontrol, who is doing well on foundation, who made a sale. Just one last thing here. In this kind of Twitter update here, downsfilms put out this interesting tweet here. What entices me about the wave blitter video synth. I love this term, a video synth. Maybe that's what the community calls them like.
00:07:59.510 - 00:08:25.784, Speaker A: I'm very familiar with synths, synthesizers. I didn't realize they call them video synths, which is super cool because that's kind of what they are. What's enticed me is its unique style. In a broader sense, it creates generative art, but there's no definitive category for it. It ingests real time audio, samples data, and transforms into nostalgic computer like patterns. Pretty cool. I don't know if there's audio here.
00:08:25.784 - 00:08:52.936, Speaker A: Let me just see. None on this work. But then Kristen Roose posted. So this is, maybe this is why Kristin Roos has a pretty good market. Like, maybe Kristin Rus knows his digital art quite well, so he can kind of has a credibility that people recognize is very possible. Edward Zajek, 1971, IBM 9044 plotter. So interesting.
00:08:52.936 - 00:09:13.304, Speaker A: Now, plotters are super interesting, too. Like, I've never used a plotter, but man, do I ever want. I think we had was there. Yeah, I think someone. Yeah, like pen plotter. Like, who doesn't want one of these. Almost looks like a sewing machine or something.
00:09:13.304 - 00:09:40.736, Speaker A: So, yeah, I would love to experiment with one of these. It's gonna happen. Has to happen. But again, like, you gotta pick your battles and one thing at a time here. So, yeah, so God of war, let's go back to this for a second. Then we'll go back to some other AI works. God of war lent me a night huskies.
00:09:40.736 - 00:10:12.944, Speaker A: Kind of all mysterious. A genesis work, I guess, by this artist who is combining AI with digital painting on top. And I think the contrast is very nice. It kind of gives a little bit of. A little bit more. And I don't want to. This is probably the wrong word, but the word I was going to use, which is probably the wrong word, but for illustrative purposes, a little more legitimacy, for lack of better term, because here it's like, okay, this is not.
00:10:12.944 - 00:10:36.836, Speaker A: It's back to this pressing a button criticism. And we've already discussed the pressing a button criticism and said, okay. When I started using, what's it called? Mid journey, I was like, okay, this is harder than it looks. And I actually used Dali yesterday on my phone. Used up all my credits pretty quickly there, so I have to buy some more. It's not as easy as it looks. But then let's.
00:10:36.836 - 00:11:14.314, Speaker A: So interesting. Interesting combination of painting, digital painting and AI is the point here. Now, if we go back, then there is this guy whose name, let's just call him Ortzke, this guy we had on yesterday doing some, what I'd consider pretty nice compositions here. These all look like they could be famous paintings in an alternate reality, especially this one, you know, with the bikes and everything. These have all been put out. Like, my notifications. I followed them yesterday.
00:11:14.314 - 00:11:31.162, Speaker A: There's probably, like, 50 paintings that were put out. I bought, like, two or three. And, like, I don't know how many notifications. Like, if we just take this one, for example. Okay. Minted yesterday. Like, you see how many are being put out here, and, you know, it's 13 pages.
00:11:31.162 - 00:12:18.640, Speaker A: And you start to go back to this idea of you know, if they released 25 works, which I think they did, maybe more yesterday, with kind of a pretty consistent, I mean, look at this. With a pretty consistent kind of look to it that's kind of convincing, persuasive enough, it kind of returns back to this pressing a button criticism. Okay? And they're selling for a tezos. And you know what? The more of these that come out and, like, the faster these, if he's putting out 25 a day, I started to think to myself, and I bought a few of these before the waterfall of more of them came out. Just as I discovered the artist. Maybe a Tezos is the right price. I'm just, you know, speculating to myself.
00:12:18.640 - 00:12:43.964, Speaker A: But that's what I start to think. If this person can put out 30 good paintings a day, maybe a Tezos is the right price. Because even these, I'm not like, jumping on them. I already got like five or six. And I'm like, eh, you know, if they're this easy to make, like how important and how collectible and etc, etc. But on the positive side here, back to clownvamp here. Happy Sunday.
00:12:43.964 - 00:13:05.600, Speaker A: AI. AI Sunday. Five artists showing what humans can do with the wonders of AI. So I thought we could quickly just take a very quick look at what Clownvamp profiled here, because he is definitely on the pulse of the AI scene. So kind of interesting. Very interesting. Again, it almost looks like a massive painting, but it's a window.
00:13:05.600 - 00:13:30.354, Speaker A: I've never seen a room like this. So I go, same with these massive windows. So I go, okay, cool. Not exactly sure. We have racecar Twitter legend Nicholas Dimes, so I'm not exactly sure what's going on here. Arrows, c'est la vie. We already looked at some of their work.
00:13:30.354 - 00:14:07.366, Speaker A: This one, I think we looked at some of their work. Indie do, indie do. So just to give us, again, my goal as we survey AI is to actually consume as much as possible. Because I think the more we consume, and that's the more we consume, the more we're going to know. And the solution to understanding AI art and what to make of it is by consuming the art, not by reading some dense text that really gets us nowhere. We need to know from the art itself. Javier Tamayo Hypero opulence this looks like another AI work.
00:14:07.366 - 00:14:30.952, Speaker A: Javier is part of what I think is like some sort of AI collective maif. I think. Stranger thing was telling me about it. A lot of the AI people seem to be a part of that, whatever that is. So this looks like another just head turning AI work. Again, the labor that would be required here would be pretty intense. And again, it's not easy to make work like this.
00:14:30.952 - 00:14:52.272, Speaker A: You know, I was discovering last night Varya has a couple of other works, a couple of houses here, I think. What did she. I think it's a she Rai house number 19, homes inside out. Okay. So almost like a dollhouse here. And I thought they're just kind of attractive paintings. Another one.
00:14:52.272 - 00:15:24.522, Speaker A: And you see how quickly these are all getting constructed. So again, back to this. How do we value AI art narrative? So interesting. And we're back to Danielle King, who is combining artists, an imagined collaboration between Kurt Schwitters and Sam Gilliam, I think Kurt Schwitters, we'd call. He was like the Murrahspo guy. There are the Murrah's works. If you know the japanese noise artist Mirzbo, he named them after Kurt Schwitters.
00:15:24.522 - 00:16:00.250, Speaker A: I think they were called Mers works. So an imagined collaboration between a couple of. I don't know who Sam Gilliam is, but maybe Kurt Schmitters is a modernist. So anyways, but not terrible results is what I'd say here. Now this is back to this. So we're getting back to the hen reunion and another painting collaboration with AI by an artist I already followed, Ilya ship, Ilya Scheepen. And you see this kind of jump here in this work here.
00:16:00.250 - 00:16:30.834, Speaker A: I think this is quite a nice work. A little risque, but painting wise, pretty spectacular, actually. Like very impressive edition of 100 available for two tezos. Looks like there's about 70 left. I think they're going pretty fast. This minted only a few hours ago, so get it while you can. So very interesting moorhen reunion stuff, this abnormal series by Spagelsmaskinen in this separate account that he made.
00:16:30.834 - 00:16:57.112, Speaker A: Maybe he's doing that to get rid of the bots or the flippers a little bit, I suspect. Let's see if we can play this. So atm, some sort of sludge or oil. Who knows what that is. Black sludge. Very, very, very cool. Nice piece.
00:16:57.112 - 00:17:21.054, Speaker A: I picked that up. I love the small series. Huge fan. There was another one, the shopping carts. Okay. They're very low resolution, like 240 pixels, which I think is super charming. So you see the shopping carts have a life of their own here.
00:17:21.054 - 00:17:46.580, Speaker A: So you know the poetry of the shopping mall. You know the poetry of the shopping mall. Spagels maskinen is exploring here. So here's the whole series again, this suitcase work now going for 60. You know, it's tempting to pick this up, because this is like, this is arguably a masterpiece. You walk in the museum, you can have this work. Everybody's head will turn.
00:17:46.580 - 00:18:05.304, Speaker A: Everybody understands it. We looked at this yesterday. This was one of the greatest works. If not to me, this won the hen reunion. It was just an instant win. Oh, let's just see here. Right? In case you didn't see yesterday's episode.
00:18:05.304 - 00:18:37.084, Speaker A: So to me, this is a masterpiece. It's tempting to call it a masterpiece. I'm not sure yet if that's a masterpiece, but it sure is tempting to call it one. Like, again, you put that at the first thing you see. I went to Kindle yesterday here in Berlin, which is a pretty prominent contemporary art institution, and they had nothing this exciting. I don't mean to. And so I won't mention anything, floor or whatever, but I just thought to myself, the contrast was enormous.
00:18:37.084 - 00:19:06.724, Speaker A: And I actually was thinking about, like, this work. And I was like, that work in that institution over there would just be like, everybody would be excited, and everybody would talk about it afterwards as remember the suitcase work. So I think I missed Hades. Another one who I'm not getting the notifications for. So I think there is a way to turn off your notifications when you meant to work. And I think the people that are having problems with the flippers are starting to turn off their notifications. So just a heads up there.
00:19:06.724 - 00:19:23.320, Speaker A: So just an interesting hen forever work from Haiti. This came out a couple of days ago. Again, I missed it. Using, I think, one of his previous works he put into a Petsky scan. Petsky filter. So pretty simple. He probably made this really quickly, but good looking.
00:19:23.320 - 00:19:50.092, Speaker A: And another work by Francoise Gamma. Work in progress. Emilio JP's pixel Cad drawings and algorithms meets Francoise Gamma's animations. Coming soon on versum. So pretty cool work over there. Another hen reunion piece. This was a really interesting work, I thought, just kind of fun.
00:19:50.092 - 00:20:11.888, Speaker A: Pixel art. Some weird dinosaurs. How long is this? Like a minute 24. So part of that genre where there's like a song almost pretty cool music. Pretty cool. It's fun. It is definitely not boring.
00:20:11.888 - 00:20:53.164, Speaker A: Okay, that much is clear, so let's stop that. Very cool work. Who is this brave? And you might remember brave. We brought up this work in a previous episode, which just caught my eye. I never picked it up, but I just thought, you know, there's something just kind of special about this work. And the music, again, was really good on this, which is kind of cool, right? So brave is one to kind of keep your eye on. New Louis Osborne work just a toaster.
00:20:53.164 - 00:21:10.884, Speaker A: Everybody could put a tazos bit on it. I put a tazos bit. I didn't get it. Cause there was, like, 200 people and only 100 editions. But just kind of a cool, classic work. Now going for 725, seven tazos, 25. I remember sad music for kids.
00:21:10.884 - 00:21:32.944, Speaker A: We brought up sad music for kids with this japanese woodcut sort of style with the fish. So just a new work. Just kind of interesting. Kind of reminded. You could put it in the same room as a Lewis Osborne. So I thought, why not put it up? Kind of a UFO, an octopus. Just kind of interesting, you know, buy for three, edition of 30.
00:21:32.944 - 00:22:01.676, Speaker A: Yeah. Here's their work. Right? So it's getting impressive. It is impressive. It's all pretty impressive, but, yeah, just another kind of head turner from the Jakarta based designer Rhett Cloaksy. Had a very nice sale, 150 tezos on something on the chair. I think it's called number 15 in his phone art finger art series with the three legs.
00:22:01.676 - 00:22:33.996, Speaker A: It looks like the invisible man with the Nightcrawler hands, as our collector was calling it. So just very, very, very interesting, as usual. Again, very nice sale. Another one. I'm a big fan of Kurt Hussle collective, and they have some hilarious stuff going on. And we'll come back to this in a second. This was one of my favorite works by Kurt Hussle collective, gourd, which is like God, as part of their puppet Pioneers series.
00:22:33.996 - 00:23:14.764, Speaker A: So now it's Stan. I mean, this is, to me, you could have a YouTube, like, puppet series with these characters, Stan and Gord, and it would be hilarious, in my opinion. Like, this is crying out for some kind of series here. Word up to, for your information, Netflix or whomever might be watching this at some point, Kurt Hussle collective, get these guys to make a show. Okay. I think they've written scripts for stuff. I've messaged a little bit with Gert Hustle or, sorry, with JNK, and they're kind of good to go for anybody that can make some money out of that.
00:23:14.764 - 00:23:45.412, Speaker A: Very interesting painting. I like Mori Gatto, and we're almost done here. Mori Gatto is the artist who did some of these works, so does a lot of experimental work with digital painting. And I picked up a couple of these, like, option six. I think I got just a very interesting digital painter. And so here is a new one. So I'd kind of want to see more in this style.
00:23:45.412 - 00:24:10.404, Speaker A: I don't know if there's a ton in this style. So just to, you know, I'd like to see a series, I guess it's a new one, so maybe there's more to come. Or there's others. So slightly different each one. I'd like to really see an exploration of that. Back to the physical art as NFTs. Dawcanti draws, who is an awesome illustrator, colored pencils with another work.
00:24:10.404 - 00:24:36.664, Speaker A: I assume Delcante draws has a gallery because she's got so much good work. So this is going for atezos. Let's see how many. Yeah, and she sells really well. Another painting as a NFT. This is digital scanned painting, JPEG original painting. So of course you only get the NFT here and not the painting.
00:24:36.664 - 00:25:06.852, Speaker A: So just kind of an interesting work. And another one, Quillanina. Another painting. Acrylic and digital painting. Acrylic and digital. So again, and this really muddies the waters, doesn't it, when you start to treat, because that's obviously the temptation. You take a picture of your painting and then maybe you want to change the color from blue to purple here, and you get like a beautiful contrast and you go, oh, this is even better.
00:25:06.852 - 00:25:38.362, Speaker A: And you can do that in Photoshop. So that really muddies the waters. As far as you know, is this a digitally native NFt? I think at that point it is, but you see there's no obvious answers to these questions. And finally, I'm wondering if this is a painting that is being sold here because it's an edition of one from working class, who is also a good follow on Twitter. Working class. The goat made with acrylic on 300 grams paper. So for 300 tezos.
00:25:38.362 - 00:26:11.076, Speaker A: So for that much, I almost assume that you get the original artwork, but I couldn't find out. I went on the Twitter cool work, the north face here, and all the classic sort of tropes that we have come to love from this community. I assume you get the work and not just the NFT, but I don't know that there is a bid. First offer, 95 tezos. And I looked on Twitter and I couldn't tell if you get the physical work. So that would be good to know. And with that, thank you for watching again.
00:26:11.076 - 00:26:12.884, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
