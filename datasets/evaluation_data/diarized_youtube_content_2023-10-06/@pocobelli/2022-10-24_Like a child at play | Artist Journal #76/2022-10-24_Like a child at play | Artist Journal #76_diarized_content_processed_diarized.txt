00:00:10.720 - 00:00:50.670, Speaker A: Your daily experiment in television in surreal television broadcasting brought to you from Berlin, Germany. Artist journal, October 24, 2022. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. Work here. This is by someone that was posting physical nfts or nfts of physical art. Controversial in my universe and. But all good, but then decided to go digital and experiment with digital.
00:00:50.670 - 00:01:37.282, Speaker A: So although this looks like physical tools, these are digital tools. I believe it's a work by. Let's just look at the name of the artist. Zala. This is a work by Zala. Digital experimentalism by Zala. So at the end of the program, we're gonna look at some of Zala's physical works as nfts, but really a stunner, I think, like what this looks like to me is someone who is experimenting with digital tools and it's like a child who is just really not worrying about where it's gonna go and just kinda coloring and oh, isn't that color pretty on that color? Like even the work, like, it's not really worrying about being anything.
00:01:37.282 - 00:02:09.324, Speaker A: This looks like the visual representation of a child playing, right, of like playing with toys and just trying stuff out, moving this here, moving this there. Oh, I'll try this brush. So anyways, that looks promising. Noisy traffic and I think she was calling it, I think it's her digital expressionism in a tweet. So anyways, really cool work. Buy it now for 0.55 ETH and yeah, so we'll come back to Zala at the end of the program.
00:02:09.324 - 00:02:52.092, Speaker A: A couple of shout outs and thank yous to who was it? So we were trying to figure out that Raphael work, so we got a couple of comments here. Beautiful episode, as always from Alessio Iagreca. The last painting is called Portrait of Pietro Bembo by Raphael. So it screamed Raphael, as I said to Alicio there. And also Chimascu Jackson chimed in, hey, brother, pretty sure that painting is portrait of Pietro Bembo by Raphael. And of course, Chimasuku Jackson is one of the two people that encouraged this show. And it was just a fledgling concept on Spotify.
00:02:52.092 - 00:03:30.240, Speaker A: In many ways, it still is a fledgling concept, just this time on YouTube. And Michael Knowlson was actually the other guy and they still watch, which is actually totally awesome. Loving these updates on Pokebelli's journey through the Tezos art scene that was just posted on October 22 or 23rd. Yeah, October 22. So super cool to have these guys back and thank you for again to Pietro and to Alicio. Alicio for figuring out who this was. And I had done a search on Raphael portraits.
00:03:30.240 - 00:03:49.464, Speaker A: And I came up with. Not this guy. I came up with this guy. And I was like, this doesn't look right because the hands, it's the wrong way. But I mean, the colors, the composition. Anybody that knows anything about italian Renaissance painting recognizes this work. Right? It's an iconic work.
00:03:49.464 - 00:04:12.258, Speaker A: So this is the one Raffaello Santi portrait of Pietro bembo. So and here you can get a really high resolution work. I can work with this stuff. I may. And so anyways, just. Yeah, I mean, look at that. So not in great condition, interestingly, but classic Raphael colors.
00:04:12.258 - 00:04:30.820, Speaker A: Let's go back to our walk work. This is a work by walking. And so here and not that. Let's go with back, just so you can see the contrast. So there and there. Okay. That is clearly the one.
00:04:30.820 - 00:05:02.208, Speaker A: So thank you again for that. And actually, one more thing I wanted to mention. When poke belly merch, can merch be tied to an NFT to prove we bought some of the first pokebelly merch. That's from 3d, FYI. I love this idea of, like, merch is some work. And just to kind of put this out, it is pretty effortless, but it does take a bit of time. So all this stuff, you know, in time, perhaps, should people continue to watch this show, which it seems to be, continue to grow.
00:05:02.208 - 00:05:29.496, Speaker A: So. Which is totally awesome. However, I do like this idea of just doing an NFT because that's super easy, right? I mean, that doesn't take much time. I can just make a little artwork somehow related to the show and then maybe we do it for, you know, zero or 0.1 or something, just so people don't buy a million of these things for free. And I think on versum you can limit the amount that people can buy. I think you can say one each.
00:05:29.496 - 00:05:54.404, Speaker A: So maybe you might need to use versum just so people don't buy like 200 of these things or, you know, you know what I'm saying? So maybe we'll start with that. Just do an NFT. And whoever's watching, go get the NFT and put it up for, I don't know, a week, a day. I don't know. We'll figure that out. I love the idea of a coffee cup, too, just for personal reasons. Maybe you do, too.
00:05:54.404 - 00:06:18.794, Speaker A: So anyways, the fun and good times continues here. Thank you for your support, as always. It continues to just kind of blow me away, frankly. Continuing on, is this a preview of Limbo's work on super rare? Because it sure looks like it have a good Sunday. And he mentioned he was going to do space. And here you have nebula. The stars are collapsing.
00:06:18.794 - 00:06:39.884, Speaker A: It looks like the front of a VHS DVD cover. And you got this just awesome use of vhs here. DVD. You know, he was doing these video games. I picked one of those up, actually. And so anyways, this looks like a DVD. He was doing covers of video games that don't exist.
00:06:39.884 - 00:07:09.640, Speaker A: And this looks like the COVID of an anime that doesn't exist. So super cool. Is it a preview of the super rare work? Not sure. Anyway, Timothy Julien put out a new work. Now, maybe you haven't seen them because Timothy Julia doesn't sell a ton, but I love his work. And it's kind of got a Roy Lichtenstein feel to it, doesn't it? But really well done and really in his own style. And so edition of ten.
00:07:09.640 - 00:07:24.154, Speaker A: Only a Tezos 50 and only one sold. And I'll show you some of his other work. I'm actually a big fan. I'll probably pick that up. This was the first one that really got my attention. Only seven tezos right now. And it's an edition of ten.
00:07:24.154 - 00:07:39.770, Speaker A: How many are available? Yeah. And that goes right up to 15 and 25. It's called tychos. I just love the composition here, let me just clear that out. Yeah. A head turner. And so this was not early, but something I found, like, three months ago.
00:07:39.770 - 00:07:58.546, Speaker A: An artist. And I think he just started minting again recently with these kind of modern art prints. What he was doing before were these interiors, contemporary interiors. So again, that kind of goes into my genre. And I will do. I keep saying this. I stopped saying it because I haven't done it yet.
00:07:58.546 - 00:08:33.824, Speaker A: But the genres of digital art, I still plan on doing maybe when I go to Prague, if I have a couple of days off the program, I'll use that time to just. I have an essay that's written, but it needs to be added a couple of genres and just tidied up a bit, and then we can just discuss it. But you see here in, you know, contemporary interiors, we have one of my favorite subjects here, the workstation. I think I actually brought this up. You have the kitchen. We'll go back to the workstation in a second here. Here's another workstation, the editing room.
00:08:33.824 - 00:08:55.264, Speaker A: So just a really fun, cool artist. Again, a bit of a Liechtenstein flavor to it. We'll bring up some Roy Lichtenstein here. Why not? And actually just do the compare and contrast. Here is that studio we were looking for. So just all the details, the style, everything about it. So there's a good chance that you don't know Timothy Julian.
00:08:55.264 - 00:09:37.444, Speaker A: If you do props and, yeah, just like, you can tell this is a guy who's got his style, he's got his art, and it looks great. Again, the painting and the painting. I love it all. So let's bring up Roy Lichtenstein here just for fun. Roy Lichtenstein and art and images because he's got some interiors that kind of, I mean, I guess his most famous work are these, you know, comics. But you kind of start to see it here. Look at this.
00:09:37.444 - 00:10:07.746, Speaker A: Some late Roy Lichtenstein. Look how beautiful that is. So you start to see some similarities there. Roy Lichtenstein. I've heard people, I've never seen a major retrospective by him, but I know people that have, who kind of went in thinking, oh, Roy Lichtenstein's okay. Like, whatever, and then went to the retrospective, maybe it was at MoMA or something, and came back and were like, this is, that guy's, like, unbelievable. Like, he was very prolific and really just kind of explored that style of his to the core.
00:10:07.746 - 00:10:33.124, Speaker A: These Benday dots and that comic book style. I mean, so we all know Roy Lichtenstein here. Let me just put in interior, though, really quickly here because. Yeah, okay. So you start to see, like, just the kind of overall vibe, you know, kind of reminds you a little bit, but it's totally his own. Timothy Jullienne. So that's what's kind of cool.
00:10:33.124 - 00:10:58.012, Speaker A: That's what's cool about it. This isn't just some derivative here. So anyways, really cool. So check him out. You can get it all cheap still, but maybe not for long. Continuing on, here's another guy just kind of in that kind of style, but totally different at the same time that I thought was kind of interesting. Just another kind of head turner on twitter.
00:10:58.012 - 00:11:22.434, Speaker A: So what was this? Les vrais by niarch. One weird abstract portraits. And. Yeah. Listed for .3 improvised digital collages made with elements of digitized hand drawings and pieces of old retro magazine parts mixed with digital graphic elements to create an abstract composition of surreal portraits in a weird landscape. So very cool.
00:11:22.434 - 00:11:47.376, Speaker A: Good looking work. So just, again, the plenty. What is the word? There is a word that escapes me. The fecundity and the fecundity of the digital art scene here. And look at this. So there are other pieces here that you can check out. Kind of reminiscent of some other artists that I've seen, but not, but still, like, totally its own thing here.
00:11:47.376 - 00:12:08.540, Speaker A: So anyways, just a cool artist. Seb Nyark one, the Sun foundation. And so continuing on, so Uncle Joseph, by the myth sold. And again, we looked at this work before with its really cool colors. I love the colors. And yeah, just another, I always like the myth's work. Another classic work I brought up who bought it, though.
00:12:08.540 - 00:12:40.094, Speaker A: So this went for 150 tezos at the auction. And look who bought it. Do you remember this collector? This is the collector that ratcloak was highlighting as buying a bunch of grails. And so this person bought the Uncle Joseph one of one. So interesting, right? They also got this new gloom tube, which we're going to look at right away here. So anyways, just interesting to see what's going on there. A new wallet, probably a new collector.
00:12:40.094 - 00:13:19.642, Speaker A: And also Mikey de la creme, he just put out this one of one, which he sold for 150. And I just wanted to highlight this major gratitude to the legend, Howdy do. NFT and shoutout to Howdy do, who has bought a couple of my works for picking up the grant Yoon inspired Wilson one of one, thus qualifying for an airdrop for future editions in the series. So Mikey Wilson is getting on the creative side of things, making work. So that's super cool. And also just making cool little airdrop mechanics, shall we say. So just anyways, a lot of fun.
00:13:19.642 - 00:13:53.554, Speaker A: Heads up. Gloom tube has a new work, signs of life, and I love this work. I was tempted to put it on the front cover there, but we've had gloom tube at least two or three times on the front, so maybe give it to someone else. But something we all recognize and I thought was great and goes with his, you know, suburban wasteland concept that he does ever so well. So just another beautiful classic work. I think it sold out right away. I lucked out and saw it, picked it up for six.
00:13:53.554 - 00:14:19.210, Speaker A: And now let's see how much it's going for now. Going for 13 and offers for 850. So just a cool work garbage can. I really like this by the artist formerly known as Fax Machinevich and Wasteman. Goldmine of it has a new one. And I really like this. I accidentally bought two because I didn't realize I bought the first one.
00:14:19.210 - 00:14:39.952, Speaker A: They're only $0.50, so. And I'm happy to have a couple there of the sausage McMuffin with still life digital painting by Trez et rodanx. So anyways, just a heads up. Seemed to go well. Seemed to pair nicely with the gloom tube there. A new work by Dan Control.
00:14:39.952 - 00:15:10.344, Speaker A: Really cool sunglasses work. So anyways, just a heads up on that really cool series. Loving how he's just exploring this very simple concept here and using his gradients in his trademark way. A new work by Dextere, which I think just came out. And I was looking at Dextere's work last night, and I just like it more and more. I wish I picked up some of those earlier works, and now I'm sort of just kind of looking at them. Stuck looking at them from a distance here.
00:15:10.344 - 00:15:40.920, Speaker A: Anyways, he's got a new work here with a car on fire. And so trademark Dexter, with the static imagery contrasting with just a little piece in movement. Fire, like a shattered hope. That's the image of a burning car I can only see and just keep silent. Interesting. Almost a political feeling to that one. So Santiago put out this new work on exchange art, which is on Solana.
00:15:40.920 - 00:16:01.940, Speaker A: I thought this was pretty cool. And we've looked at a lot of Santiago's work before, and he is, I believe he does physical work. He has work on object. So here's just a really interesting abstract work. Secret landscape under the skin. A place where to find each other in a non personal way, but possibly, yes, in a very deep way. So for .4
00:16:01.940 - 00:16:16.116, Speaker A: sol, $11.43. Ten editions left when I loaded this up. So is this working? Yes. So you can still buy it. You know, I just. I bought one of those sabatos yesterday, I think was, like, 0.2 or something.
00:16:16.116 - 00:16:34.844, Speaker A: Maybe I'll add to my Saul collection a little bit. Exchange art. Very cool. Attempting to put a series on there at some point. And, of course, we recognize Santiago from his other work, and I'm sure you recognize the style. So anyways, really cool. I didn't realize he was on exchange art as well.
00:16:34.844 - 00:17:09.454, Speaker A: Here's an interesting kind of take on the crypto punks. This is by Abrer and feels actually shouted this out. And so let me just show you. And it's kind of an interactive work, I think so picopunk compositions, and it loads up like a computer. And so I'm not. We'll have to look at what kind of press any button to begin. And there you go.
00:17:09.454 - 00:17:29.304, Speaker A: And so it's almost like a generative art. Is that what you'd call this? Because probably go up. And so it creates different variables. So it's just really cool. It's basically an art maker. It's like an art machine, an art tool, whatever you want to call it. Kind of interesting to see where this could go.
00:17:29.304 - 00:17:55.364, Speaker A: So picopunk compositions, p eight. Buy for 20 edition of 50, 45 left from the Janod La Pain Gallery. And we've seen Janot Le Pay gallery before, so interesting. Yeah, feels picked one up. Bodacious pirate. Shawn Luke Modi interctv collection. So anyways, interesting, interesting.
00:17:55.364 - 00:18:21.878, Speaker A: Continuing on, let's actually just quickly look at how many pages Janod Lapin has because I think Janot le Payne Gallery is reaching out to a lot of artists here. Okay. They have three pages of work. So anyways, just interesting, a couple of new nebulas from bite by bit. One of my favorites. This one went, like, immediately for nine tezos. A nice one of one.
00:18:21.878 - 00:18:39.934, Speaker A: This is the cat's eye nebula, which sounds kind of famous. That's what I like about these. Like, again, kind of educational, too. Fun and educational. Here's another one. Barnard's bubble nebula, one of one available for nine. So very cool.
00:18:39.934 - 00:19:07.394, Speaker A: And continuing on, so a bit of a nature theme here as we go from space to the sun. This is by Corey Haber, who I recently kind of discovered on Twitter. And look at this series here. This is on foundation. And, I mean, a pretty good looking series and not cheap. So this is how much for sale, you know, sold for 0.2. It looks like there's.
00:19:07.394 - 00:19:23.314, Speaker A: Looks like they all sold for 0.18, actually. And. But look at how great these variations are. I assume it's generative art. So I brought up a few that I almost just took randomly here, which looked really good. Like, look at that.
00:19:23.314 - 00:19:50.408, Speaker A: You know, so I guess this you could print out. And they even have that nice writing at the bottom. So I assume this is like machine made art, like generative art that you'd find on FX, hash or something, because there are a few other variations. It's really well done, in my opinion. And, yeah, I mean, this is not physical art by any stretch. This is computer made art. So just kind of interesting work.
00:19:50.408 - 00:20:22.868, Speaker A: Again, screams monetized scrims. Monet haystacks, actually, in the colors there and here. So another thing, I wonder if they used Monet as an input for the color. That's what this looks like to me, because this whole thing is kind of screaming impressionism, if you know. Of course, Monet's haystacks, let's just bring them up for fun because we love the history here. Yeah, these are spectacular. You know, just classic, classic impressionist works.
00:20:22.868 - 00:20:51.448, Speaker A: And, you know, Monet exploring light, right? So just taking that subject matter and exploring it a billion different ways, as we see right here. Continuing on, Diego Barrow has a new work. I miss the palm tree work. And I'm kind of like, yeah, I'll need to. I had no money in my wallet each time I went to buy one. Anyway, there's a new one, and it looks really cool. His combination of photos and paintbrush.
00:20:51.448 - 00:21:10.684, Speaker A: So the photos are getting less and less digital oil painting made on procreate. You know what it's like. He's gotten rid of the photo. Very interesting. Very, very interesting. So this is a digital oil painting. So let's just look at what Diego's up to here.
00:21:10.684 - 00:21:38.560, Speaker A: And did he get rid of it? Looks like he's getting rid of the photo in some works, because here, you see this looks like it's here. And this was a really nice work, which we highlighted before, because you see the kind of the hard rectangle of the photo, whereas in these recent works, it looks like he's removing the photo. Oh, you can buy it for ten. So I can get it for ten. It is available now. Yeah. So anyways, so interesting.
00:21:38.560 - 00:22:04.924, Speaker A: So Diego continues to evolve and try different stuff. I wanted to bring this up for two reasons. This work by holiday salts, who I never really heard of, just kind of a weird, interesting work. Kind of paired nicely with that Diego work. This one here. Or was it? Yeah. So anyways, before we get off track here, so I just thought an interesting work.
00:22:04.924 - 00:22:28.888, Speaker A: And if you don't know voodoo Ray, go find voodoo ray. This is like a great, great, great song. Classic acid house, as holiday salts is pointed out. So they're listening to voodoo Ray. Do yourself a favor and load that one up on YouTube after this. Anyways, just interesting work continuing on. And this was actually burned.
00:22:28.888 - 00:23:02.970, Speaker A: It didn't sell. I wanted to pick it up. I was waiting for the last minute, and I guess I woke up after the auction. So, anyways, also AI work by Trez at Rodanx, formerly known as fax Machinevich. And finally, so this is the person we opened up with here. Remember Zala? Remember Zala? So let's go back. And so these are some of Zala's physical works that they did, and I believe I brought them up here.
00:23:02.970 - 00:23:38.520, Speaker A: So pretty nice. Kind of has a Marc Chagall feel to all the coloring here. Really nice. And you see acrylic and oil pastels on canvas 2022, which makes me think, when I go back to this other one, which is just digital experimentalism, that this definitely is digital. And you like, even to do this pattern here would be a total pain physically, unless you did some sort of frottage like Max Ernst or something, or even all these lines. So anyways, here is Zala's physical work. And there's another one here.
00:23:38.520 - 00:23:59.304, Speaker A: It's a pretty cool painter. Right? And again, I brought up some chagall here just for us. So you can see the color, colors kind of bleeding into each other here. Right. And so, yeah, I mean, here's some very, very classic chagall. So that, my friends, is your program today. I hope you enjoyed it.
00:23:59.304 - 00:24:02.624, Speaker A: Thanks again for all the support. Until next time. Take care.
