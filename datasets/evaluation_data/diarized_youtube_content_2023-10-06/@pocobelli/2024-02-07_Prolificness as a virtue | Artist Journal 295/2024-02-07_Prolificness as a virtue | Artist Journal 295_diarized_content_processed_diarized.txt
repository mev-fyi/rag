00:00:02.440 - 00:00:24.034, Speaker A: All right, we are back. Welcome back. As we continue to set sail forward here through sunny skies, a harbinger, hopefully, of a summer, a beautiful summer ahead over here, everywhere. Summer of the mind. I made a mix called the summer of the mind. Anyway, welcome back. Artist journal, February 7, 2024.
00:00:24.034 - 00:00:50.164, Speaker A: Broadcasting after the gym and having a wonderful time, actually feeling great. The brain is breathing. That post gym brain is breathing. So let's see if it performs for us today. Welcome back. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and so a massive amount of tabs are in order here. So I'm gonna be as speedy as I can be.
00:00:50.164 - 00:01:38.634, Speaker A: It is astonishing how much gets released here, of note. And I'm just, again, as I always like to say here, you know, putting out my hand in a waterfall here and collecting whatever passes through my feed or stream of information here. And so it is quite astonishing, really, what is going on here. I mean, almost without parallel. I mean, where else, I guess, like, as far as the visual arts are concerned, I suppose, you know, once you're off the Internet again, like, is it going to galleries and. And all the business of the art scene, you know, it's the business of the art scene. And you just wonder, you know, probably, I assume, generally speaking.
00:01:38.634 - 00:02:43.874, Speaker A: Generally speaking, sometimes it competes. But generally speaking, the. The traditional art scene is going to be bigger dollars, right? But in terms of the actual content, and when you forget about the dollars and you just kind of look at what's going on, it does make you wonder, like, which is the more active scene, which scene has more things going on? And it's kind of an interesting question to a certain degree. Maybe it's a, you know, in a weird way, is this a kind of competition of sorts of images very loosely defined on Instagram versus Twitter? Of course, Instagram having a bit more of the traditional art scene, whereas Twitter or x having more of the digital kind of crypto scene. So all to say, let's not take too long here. So I'm sure the great majority of you will recognize the artist. And I had to do a double take because, of course, this is Lorna Mills, and this is Lorna Mills on Solana.
00:02:43.874 - 00:03:20.744, Speaker A: A wonderful opening here, a wonderful way of presenting herself to a new blockchain for her, I think, as far as I understand here. And this bacon with the pink. And again, I had to do a double take because I was expecting. I was like, where's the kind of the rude awakening thing that I'm gonna get here? Like, what's the joke? I don't get is almost what I was thinking to myself, maybe there is a joke. I don't get it is just bacon. And now I'm starting to wonder, maybe there is a joke I don't get. It kind of looks like a hashtag.
00:03:20.744 - 00:03:57.524, Speaker A: So all I know. All I know is, like, basically, in a sense, I don't have too much to say. The work speaks for itself. This very fun frying bacon juxtaposed with this kind of hot pink, this bright hot pink. And it made me think, just in a process, in the. How this was built, I assume probably there were two strips of bacon that started this work. And then maybe it felt like it wasn't enough, even though it probably was tempting to go with the two strips.
00:03:57.524 - 00:04:16.048, Speaker A: And then. So maybe we'll just put it across and add another layer of two more strips of bacon. And here we are. So who knows? Pure speculation, of course, on my part. And, of course, legendary weave. So here's Lorna Mills on exchange. Art sold out, by the way.
00:04:16.048 - 00:04:40.904, Speaker A: And how much were these selling for? How much were they selling for? It's a little tricky, you know, I think a go go lightus here with the ease, with the active history. Here we go. 0.75 sol. So seven and a half soldiers. Nice take here for Lorna Mills. You know, very nice compliment to her tazos business there.
00:04:40.904 - 00:05:00.568, Speaker A: So very nice. Just a very cool work here. And, of course, with Lorna Mills. Finally, finally, we have the racehorse names. I asked her, you know, where do the titles come from? On the Twitter space that we did. They come from racehorse names, of course. They always have unusual names.
00:05:00.568 - 00:05:20.856, Speaker A: And so here is just another example. All of her artworks, as far as she said, here is a more edgy one. I think it was on the COVID of exchange art or on the homepage there. And here. Kind of an interesting. Kind of pixelated out a little bit on purpose, of course. And just, you know, doing some exercise.
00:05:20.856 - 00:05:56.118, Speaker A: Exercises here. Kind of suggestive in circle, missy again. So it's very interesting, these titles here, because it seems to me the other one had weave in it, and it was almost like bacon was being weaved. It's like Lorna Mills looks at the title of the racehorses, then she looks at her work, and then she tries to find a congruence, an association, and, you know, then you see something like encircle, missy. Okay, we got some, you know, people at the gym, some women at the gym. Maybe there's a connection there. And there is your work.
00:05:56.118 - 00:06:07.742, Speaker A: There is your title. So all very interesting. So this is 15 Saul a one of one. So listed two days ago. 14,000. Sorry, 14. $50.01
00:06:07.742 - 00:06:24.368, Speaker A: of one. Let's see how it goes. Saul. Collectors can throw down as far as the amount that they'll spend. So bridge party here. Kind of an edgier work. And this is a family program for the most part, so gonna leave that one there.
00:06:24.368 - 00:06:50.250, Speaker A: But there is the page and there's love. The actual. The banner here looks great. And again, really cool. So Lord of Mill's selling out the bacon legendary weave on Solana. So a pretty fun, pretty fun development there from just a great artist and a very friendly individual. And big shout out to Lorna Mills, who I met in December.
00:06:50.250 - 00:07:39.424, Speaker A: I almost felt like, how have we not met before, having lived in Toronto? Anyways, I said we would go fast, so let's go fast here. So today there is a small chance that this will either be happening while you're watching this or that it is right before. I'm going to try and upload this video before our Twitter space with rannixdeer, a really cool artist who we've been showing for more than a year here. The abstract works on tazos, sometimes representational, kind of taking a minimalist turn, collaborating with MCHX on the AI, putting out just a whole bunch of interesting work. So finally, we're going to have Rannoch steer on the Twitter spaces today. So really excited about that. And of course, runetune, back from Asia.
00:07:39.424 - 00:08:13.884, Speaker A: Big trip to Asia, where I have never been. I have never been to Asia yet. And it's something that's gonna happen very soon, I'm sure. And maybe so I'm gonna ask Rune Tun about how the trip was just to try and even encourage myself to finally make the time, make the effort, go to Asia, go to Thailand, especially here in the summer, sorry, in the winter in Berlin, that is. It's gotten really expensive. I almost like there was consideration of going to Thailand. It's gotten a lot more expensive in the last few years, so I had to think twice about it.
00:08:13.884 - 00:08:27.584, Speaker A: Anyway, let's look at the comments here on the last show. And thank you for the big response here, as ever. Big as ever. Beautiful response there was. Goldman, thanks for checking out the art on the show again, Adrian, always an honor. Great to hear from you. Wasteman.
00:08:27.584 - 00:08:59.320, Speaker A: Great pieces. And I thought this was interesting. Thank you for discussing prolificness as a virtue, which is interesting because this is a debate sometimes still, because collectors sometimes get concerned that if you mint too much work that some, you know, it's a supply and demand issue. And then that will diminish the value of your work. Some people see it as a liability, being dmed with unsolicited advice to make less art by people who I wouldn't call artists. So it's good to hear an actual artist attach some value to it. Yes, exactly.
00:08:59.320 - 00:10:04.014, Speaker A: Like, you know, it's kind of one of those interesting dilemmas, isn't it, as an artist? Because to a certain degree, the collector, there's a. It's not based out of nowhere, this idea of supply and demand. So it's not out of nowhere. But as an artist, this is kind of where, you know, the market where, as an artist, you go, well, do I want to make art? In a sense, do, what is my goal here in terms of business goals? Am I out to make as much, have my work sell for as much as possible, or am I out to kind of dent the culture? You know, what game am I playing? And I'd argue the prolific game can even work out market wise. But generally, if you're. It's like wasteman's choosing the prolific game, which I am totally in favor of and would love to do myself and am trying to do now that I've kind of shuffled the schedule a little bit of this show. But that is the, like, do you want to dent the culture? Right? Do you want to have your images kind of, you know, like, put it this way.
00:10:04.014 - 00:11:18.464, Speaker A: When we look at the most famous artists of the 20th century, we look at Picasso, we think of Picasso, we think of Andy Warhol, and these are some of the most prolific artists ever. And so we really, as far as, you know, growing up and trying to make it as an artist, who are you going to take your cues from? And, you know, and. And ultimately, in the long run, one could argue the market rewarded the prolificness because then they became, arguably a more significant artist. Would they put it this way? Another way of framing this question? Would they be as famous if they hadn't been so prolific? Would their works be, as, you know, valuable? Had they not been so prolific? Had there not been tens of thousands of Picassos? Right. And almost to a satirical degree, if you've ever seen the ceramics, I'll never forget in Barcelona in 2004, I think there's a musee Picasso there. And I was just like, these ceramics, maybe I'd appreciate them more now. But I thought, this guy is just like, you know, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
00:11:18.464 - 00:11:53.782, Speaker A: So all to say, it's an interesting discussion, and I think you're parking yourself on the right side of history. So to speak or the right side of the argument as an artist. And you really have to go with, why are you an artist? You know, part of the reason is you kind of want to. There is a sense of glory associated with being an artist. There is a statement saying, it's not a humble endeavor. It's not a humble endeavor being an artist, is it? I mean, you're really saying, hey, look at this. My piece of imagination here.
00:11:53.782 - 00:12:16.962, Speaker A: Not only do I think it's worth something, but I'm going to put out a whole bunch. And, you know, it's kind of. There is a sense of outrageousness to it. This isn't being in the cave, you know, anonymously making, you know, cave paintings for, you know, rituals. Right. So all to say, very interesting. And the Jim Brain, let's see how it's going here.
00:12:16.962 - 00:12:35.570, Speaker A: It's going very slowly through this episode, but it is working quite well so far. Let's continue here. Thank you, wasteman, and love your work. And I'm really digging that contrast between the flat and the texture there. Jan Lucas, Miguel, pure gold in this journal, my friend. Well, thank you. Thank you very much.
00:12:35.570 - 00:12:49.594, Speaker A: And great to hear from such a talented artist. And actually we're going to see Jan Lucas Migone worked today, a new one. Bea. Keep up the good work. Thank you, Bea. And there's a great interview we did. And Martin, Joe, great to hear from you, as ever.
00:12:49.594 - 00:13:09.206, Speaker A: Little cake. Super cool. You took a bunch of time on the show to talk about botto, right? The community built work of art. Definitely think the visual pieces needed to be talked about in conjunction with the concept. So it's great you broke it down for everyone. Yeah, there is a sense. Exactly.
00:13:09.206 - 00:13:57.816, Speaker A: It's kind of back to this idea. And we also see it, I believe. Remember, Saul LeWitt would do the instructions. Right. And it's almost taking this logic of, to rectate last episode's kind of interpretation, the beauty is shifted from the object to the idea. For the most part, you could still argue that the latrine as a sculpture and on its side, you could still argue that's actually kind of an interesting sculpture of sorts. I was thinking to myself later, but nevertheless, you know, this idea of the idea taking a kind of kind of robbing the object or the results, where the beauty is more in the idea than in the result, the concept.
00:13:57.816 - 00:14:23.652, Speaker A: And again, we think of Sol LeWitt, you know, writing down the minimalist. I think he was. Was he considered a minimalist? I mean, a famous artist from the sixties and seventies. Concept artist, I think is what we'd call Solowit, you know, doing a lot of abstraction, geometric abstraction, and would really oftentimes just type out instructions and then there you go. That's the work. And then, you know, maybe the museum makes the work. So that's, you know, taken to its extreme.
00:14:23.652 - 00:14:47.666, Speaker A: So all to say, it's a very interesting discussion, and I take it as a very bullish sign that it's really coming up in the whole blockchain space. I think it shows how sophisticated the space is. In a sense, this space has nothing to apologize for conceptually, it's dealing with very big ideas. Anyways, let's run through this. Thank you, little cakes. Great to hear from you. Lucas Lejeune, awesome to hear from you.
00:14:47.666 - 00:15:04.780, Speaker A: Daenerys. Oh, my God, the crochet cigars at the end. Yeah. A little reward for those that watched all the way to the end are so awesome. Now I want it. Ilay Joy Division pp Universal is a portrait I drew and painted in canvas on Zora. Very interesting.
00:15:04.780 - 00:15:26.204, Speaker A: I had seen photos on the x by Pbuniversal and asked if I could reference. He didn't see the result until finished. There are original features in the composition. Thank you so much for thinking of and featuring. You're welcome. And would love to see more narrative paintings from ilay there also. Thank you, nbs and Denise, great to hear from you.
00:15:26.204 - 00:15:39.012, Speaker A: And glitchoholic also in Lepro chants. Great to hear. Lepro chant. Great to hear from you. And also just on YouTube, a couple of comments here. Let us see here. Pretty nice and inspiring show.
00:15:39.012 - 00:16:02.734, Speaker A: Thank you. Coach Kyoto. I think we might be, you know, the algorithm is kind of, I'm getting kind of subscribers here and there on YouTube, interestingly. And I wonder if it's the algorithm. So this is from, I was actually at the digital art museum. When was it? On Saturday. And so, of course, Wolf Leser here, the Berlin Digital Art Museum.
00:16:02.734 - 00:16:43.926, Speaker A: So putting out on the Instagram here, look how beautiful this work is by this artist, Harold Cohen, who is a famous pioneer of computer art here. If you're in New York between February 3 and may be, be sure to see Harold Cohen, Aaron at the Whitney Museum. So now at the Whitney, and I don't, you know, I'll be super, you know, transparent here. Like, I don't know a ton about actually the history of digital art in the sense that I was often kind of bored by it. Like, I get it. It was overly, you'll notice there's not a ton of generative art on this show. There is some, but I'm not like a huge, generative art guy.
00:16:43.926 - 00:17:40.024, Speaker A: That's just a personal thing. And it's not a judgment. It's just a personal, you know, you can't be expert or, you know, you can't love everything, right? And so that was so put it this way, though, had I seen more works like this, I think I would have been more into, you know, really getting down into digital art history, because this really speaks to me. I see all sorts of issues that we deal with here that, you know, that we'd see in, like 1980s, you know, late Warhol in, you know, beautiful Richard Prince paintings, you know, which are some of my favorite kinds of works of art, again, traveling through the mediums, and here you see this kind of awkwardness, almost as if it was painted with a mouse. But who knows? And maybe it's a pen plotter, who knows what the process is? But I look at this and I want to know more. That's what I see here. And there it is at the Whitney.
00:17:40.024 - 00:18:03.764, Speaker A: So if you're in New York, that looks like a must see. And I have to, you know, the color. How is this all chosen? And is this a physical. I suppose it is. There's a lot to really love. And, you know, what really jumps out at me is actually the, you see the plant here and then there's the background in red. What jumps out at me are how the red doesn't go all the way to the line.
00:18:03.764 - 00:18:49.326, Speaker A: And that feels very original and exciting and originality, and it's beautiful, and it kind of reveals something about the process. So there's a poetry there. That's the thing. When you put too much into the machine in generative art, I feel like sometimes, at least from my own sort of poetic aesthetic appreciation, sometimes I feel like it robs a work of the poetry to a certain degree. But here this is full of poetry. So very interesting and maybe a reason to visit New York, who knows? I just wanted to continue just a note here, more on this Rosenquist thing. There's a Phillips auction gives James Rosenquist to state the best of both worlds.
00:18:49.326 - 00:19:59.874, Speaker A: So having, again, as Katya Kazakhina said, the art detective was saying in our last show, having a bit of a moment, James Rosenquist, of course, the very famous pop artist whose works, you know, sound like they were going for quite a bit lower than the other pop artists. And again, I was suggesting this is because of the later work, which tarnished perhaps in some people's eyes, the. Because oftentimes, and I understand the skepticism towards James Rosenquist's later work, there is a sense of like, ooh, what's going on here? But generally speaking, the later work is often underrated in my opinion of artists like Warhol's later work. I'd argue Richard Prince is in top form here in the last like ten or 15 years. And all the things that kind of made Richard Prince famous, even Warhol, I mean, I like the Campbell soup cam. Maybe I'm just overexposed to it. But it's the later work, the painterliness, the bad painting on purpose, the collaborations with Basquiat, that stuff is just magic for me anyways.
00:19:59.874 - 00:20:36.566, Speaker A: So James Rosenquest, there is a bunch of works carrying an estimate of dollar 500 to dollar 700. You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of like a crypto project that it's going to launch at 100,000 market cap, but then it's going to 100 x. I really doubt after all of this press that these James Rosenquist prints are going to go for five hundred dollars to seven hundred dollars. Let's very quickly just see what they're saying. James Rosenquist offer around 50 prints, I mean across 50 years. This is the estate for the first time in a Phillips auction on New York on 15 February. It's no money spinner.
00:20:36.566 - 00:21:35.918, Speaker A: The sales total estimates tops at $410,000. I suspect it's going to be broken just for value because all of a sudden when you're talking $400, that's something that a lot of people watching the show could afford. And all of a sudden you have a James Rosenquist print, maybe even from the last 50 years here, maybe even from the sixties or seventies, with lots starting at dollar 400. Rather, says Mimi Thompson, the artist's widow and the board director of his estate, the aim is to put images in the hands of people who could spend $1,000. So a very noble goal here from Mimi Thompson. You do wonder, because of the cheapness, because of the low cost, if the flippers are going to like the trad art, flippers are going to jump in because it seems like an easy two x, doesn't it, if you're picking up something for $500. So let's leave this here then.
00:21:35.918 - 00:22:27.806, Speaker A: But I just kind of want to show that there is more buzz beyond Katya Kazakhina's article there and so very interesting there. And this, I just wanted to, this was in Bloomberg Business Week, can AI unlock the secrets of the ancient world? And of course, we like to deal with antiquity here too, in moderation, I guess almost 2000 years a volcano preserved Herculaneum's vast library of scrolls, but left them unreadable. A volunteer army of nerds has been racing to decipher them. So this is quite something. I mean, just, you know, for example, here, you know, Aristotle is thought to have had dialogues and we have none of them. And I think even plays, if I'm not mistaken. But they're definitely thought to have dialogues, maybe plays.
00:22:27.806 - 00:23:10.294, Speaker A: This stuff has all been lost. But look at this. This is very significant here. So the Herculaneum papyri are a collection of scrolls whose status among classicists approaches the mythical. The scrolls were buried inside an italian countryside villa by the same volcanic eruption in 79 AD that froze Pompeii in time. To date, only about 800 have been recovered from the small portion of the villa that's been excavated. So there are more in that villa, but it's thought that the villa, which historians believe belonged to Julius Caesar's prosperous father in law, had a huge library that could contain thousands or even tens of thousands more.
00:23:10.294 - 00:23:56.640, Speaker A: I mean, this could change everything, because we have to think, like, when you think of the history of western civilization, we're talking in about large degree. When you think of the church and Greece's impact on Rome and then the church, this could completely turn the whole understanding of the western tradition upside down. So, as they say here approaches the mythical. I had never heard of this stuff. I've heard of the Nag Hammadi manuscripts. I didn't realize there was a hall that was unreadable. But it sounds like they're going to try and use AI to decipher this.
00:23:56.640 - 00:24:32.624, Speaker A: This could be, like, just astonishing. Such a hall represented the largest collection of ancient texts ever discovered. And the conventional wisdom among scholars is that it would multiply our supply of ancient greek and roman poetry, plays and philosophy by manifold. High on their wish lists are works by the likes of Aeschylus, Sappho and Sophocles. But some say it's easy to imagine fresh revelations about the earliest years of Christianity. And let's just look at the quote here and then move on. Some of these texts could completely rewrite the history of key periods of the ancient world to a certain degree.
00:24:32.624 - 00:25:10.240, Speaker A: It could rewrite world history to a certain. To a certain degree. I don't want to overstate things here, but this is huge, says Robert Fowler, a classicist and the chair of the Herculaneum Society, a charity that tries to raise awareness of the scrolls in the villa site. This is the society from which the modern western world is descended indeed. So all to say, they're going to try and use some AI here. And so just a really fascinating look at this, look at where they lived. It's like, okay, show's over.
00:25:10.240 - 00:25:32.980, Speaker A: That was a good show. Let's continue here. Okay, so Solana shut down. And so this is interesting, Shilley Preston here, and go support Shilly Preston, who just missed out on a job there because of a license approval taking forever. That is unfortunate. So Solana shut down again. Blows my mind that an entire blockchain is able to just be stopped at any time.
00:25:32.980 - 00:26:06.274, Speaker A: So Solana shut down. So again, there's, you know, as I tell people, the most pushback I've ever gotten on this show is saying, what's the big deal about Solana? Well, maybe, you know, people are, maybe there's something to be said about skepticism towards it. You know, I'll still mint stuff on it, but interesting, you know, I'm an open minded person, and I think we just have to observe and take note. And I guess I never really thought it was decent, overly decentralized. So let's look at this. So Robnis v. Three blockchains aren't supposed to stop and start.
00:26:06.274 - 00:26:27.194, Speaker A: That's what banks do, have outages. So something to note here. Santiago is a codal. Tezos tech and infrastructure is way better than Solana. Interesting. Hype doesn't mean much if a small closed group controls how a protocol works. So it doesn't mean great art isn't there, though.
00:26:27.194 - 00:26:49.760, Speaker A: It doesn't mean art isn't great there, though. Art goes beyond any chain, in my humble opinion. But it is extremely important for artists to know how does any blockchain work, its protocol and its development environment, as well as who's running its nodes. We're responsible to be informed. So interesting comment. And there's, I think there's something to be said for that. San Diego is the cottle.
00:26:49.760 - 00:27:33.564, Speaker A: Nothing beats bitcoin stamps. So another observation and insight here on the blockchain, and, you know, much appreciated to San Diego, is a codel for the education here because otherwise, how do we know this stuff? And you don't even know where to look or how to ask the right question. So much appreciated there. So nothing beats bitcoin stamps when it comes to asset immutability. So Santiago and be interviewed me about a week and a half ago on a Saturday morning here, Friday night for them, and it was really fascinating. We talked a lot about stuff like bitcoin stamps. And so here, just for our discussion on ordinals here and just the overall, you know, tying this into the Solana shutdown.
00:27:33.564 - 00:28:21.870, Speaker A: Shaban Shami linked to by or tweeted by Santiago izucodal unveiling the immutability spectrum of blockchain assets. Check out my latest infographic. So as you see here, bitcoin stamps, if you look at immutability here and longevity, it sounds like they'll never be removed. With bitcoin ordinals, it's very high likelihood that they'll never be removed. But if bitcoin consensus, as you see down here, moves to censor ordinals and no operator maintains an uncensored version. So there could be a decision by the devs and just a consensus that if ordinals start screwing up the chain, there is a chance, although it's unlikely. And very high cost bitcoin stamps are extreme.
00:28:21.870 - 00:29:03.712, Speaker A: And look at this, maximum size is 10 kb. So, and I just wanted to mention, I almost forgot to mention this. So remember I started last episode with Kareem Safa's work. So I was putting, I was just kind of making a smaller copy for the curation on object that I try and do each episode. Most of the time I do you know how big that file was, is 13 kb. So that beautiful Kareem safa that we started with, you know, it almost would fit as a bitcoin stamp and would easily fit as an ordinal minting for $40.40, $50 depending on how busy the blockchain is.
00:29:03.712 - 00:29:47.774, Speaker A: So very interesting. And then of course, the mutability goes down or the immutability goes down and you see and the cost goes along with it. So interesting graphic there, posted or tweeted out by San Diego is a codal. Here was another very interesting development here. Breaking from the Ordi wallet, it appears that OG, or from Ordi breaking, it appears that OG bitcoiner and rare pepe artist who worked so rare Pepe is on counterparty, as far as I understand, skrilla Ventura just spent over one bitcoin. So $40,000 to inscribe these high res, one of ones into bitcoin. And so very interesting here.
00:29:47.774 - 00:30:15.264, Speaker A: So actual, like physical drawings, it looks like. So. But you know what I thought to myself, like, I want to look more closely here because $40,000 divided by two, four, 6810. So there's a 140,000 divided by 100, I guess. Is that $400 each interesting. These two, four, six. So maybe, maybe that's $400 each.
00:30:15.264 - 00:30:34.324, Speaker A: Right. Very interesting. Okay, so yeah, watch this space. This ordinal space. Zora continuing to iterate and develop here. Zora has now has arbitrum support, of course, arbitrum being a L2 on ethereum. So making things way cheaper.
00:30:34.324 - 00:31:05.792, Speaker A: So that is a pretty big move here. And there is a, I would mint this, you see, there's 21,000 minted. So there is, you know, discussion, will there be a Zora airdrop? In other words, free tokens given to users of the platform. You probably want to pick this one up. Arbzora, arbitrum, Zorb. If they're going to put out a special thing because they're, you know, if there is an airdrop, they're going to have to try and figure out who to give it to. Right.
00:31:05.792 - 00:31:30.110, Speaker A: And so having this NfT probably doesn't hurt. And that's probably why there's 21,000 minted. So FYI on that one, super rare. Also developing here, a whole new way to mint on super rare. So introducing, I think what you'd call lazy minting. With just one transaction, artists can put a body of artwork on chain at the same time without breaking the bank. Collectors cover the gas fees.
00:31:30.110 - 00:32:01.734, Speaker A: Right. So the collector, similar to what we see with gamma, as far as I understand, if I remember right, yeah, of course. Where the collector will pay the minting fee. So very interesting. And you know, again, I'm just thinking to myself, yeah, what works would I put on if I didn't have to worry about minting, you know, so very interesting. So something to check out here. Very interesting.
00:32:01.734 - 00:32:47.074, Speaker A: I wonder what the standard is if it's still a 721, ERC 721 or 1155. Interesting question, isn't it? Object.com comma gm everyone, are you ready for the launch of object galleries today? This space in the last 48 hours, I mean, and you know what, this is typical of how much news comes out in this space in 48 hours. I'm kind of back to my original question, like, what is the contemporary trad art world done in the last 48 hours? You know, it's just an, and I'm sure they've done lots. They're putting on a, there's going to be a Rosenquist auction. But I'm just saying like, it's quite astonishing how much is going on here. Fake whale who is doing the object gallery one day left to the fake whale gallery art market debut release.
00:32:47.074 - 00:33:06.720, Speaker A: And I think this came out yesterday. So, so this is launching today. In other words, our exclusive ongoing on chain exhibition. Created in collaboration with object.com, the exhibition will go live tomorrow, February 7, which is today starting from 04:00 p.m. Central european time or 10:00 a.m. In New York.
00:33:06.720 - 00:33:24.152, Speaker A: So during our Twitter space, this will go live. So you can listen to our Twitter space and maybe buy some art in the meantime. And here are all the artists. So very interesting there. And let me just make sure that is not going to create volume. Okay. And vending.
00:33:24.152 - 00:33:52.986, Speaker A: NFT's partnership announcement. This is pretty interesting too. So tes vending machine, I'm extremely pleased to announce a partnership with infinite objects and the Venn machine. So of course, infinite objects are the makers of this pretty well known format here, physical format of display and digital art. In this kind of almost, I guess it's glass or mylar like really nice wrapper here. An infinite objects is a display that plays a single visual loop permanently. Infinite objects are also known as video prints.
00:33:52.986 - 00:34:16.370, Speaker A: How will it work? So how cool is that? The Tes vending machine partnering up with infinite objects. So pretty big deal here. There's a, you know, people with infinite objects. Michael Macasso Takeo. Michael Macasso take over on February 11. So tons going on. His vending machine has its own token and everything.
00:34:16.370 - 00:34:31.384, Speaker A: So lots going on with the tez vending machine. So into the art we go. Another stunner. Let's see if we can make this bigger. This is by grasshopper in a moth. And I love this title. There's something kind of Aesop's fables about it.
00:34:31.384 - 00:35:11.584, Speaker A: I don't know if there is an Aesop's fable of grasshopper and a moth, but what an awesome. There's something kind of very anciently simple, for lack of better words, in a good way, about this subject matter here. Grasshopper and a moth. It feels like, again, like a fairy tale that I don't know about. And so if we zoom out here, can we identify the grasshopper in the moth? I mean, there is a sense of grasshopper ness here. And again, this is made with Microsoft paint. And you have to love, frankly, this screenshot here showing a modern looking Microsoft paint.
00:35:11.584 - 00:35:44.356, Speaker A: I thought they had gotten rid of Microsoft paint, but maybe they still have it. It would seem so. And then here, like, is this the moth? Not sure, but just another stunner here from Quampa. There's a big cross, interestingly, 50 megabytes. So just a beautiful work. I mean, when you kind of epic, right in its scale and everything, I mean, 7000 pixels. So another just like epic work here from Cuompa.
00:35:44.356 - 00:36:04.020, Speaker A: Interesting corner here. And, you know, so just very, very, very cool. So I didn't see this minted anywhere. Link to Instagram. Maybe this in print where Cuompa, I think, has been doing some physical prints. So Ms paint 2024. So a new one.
00:36:04.020 - 00:36:44.550, Speaker A: I'm pretty sure we haven't seen that one. And here is Marcelo Pinel, Aquarius. And of course, I am an Aquarius. Actually, it's my birthday tomorrow, so big shout out to Marcelo Pinel, Aquarius, February 5, 2024. And here is the water bearer, as it's called, with almost like a disco ball, water bearing vase here. It seems like it's developing here, doesn't it? Marcelo Pinel's work and style here, it seems to be, interestingly, just kind of evolving in very slight ways. And there's the constellation there.
00:36:44.550 - 00:37:14.156, Speaker A: And so what's so cool about this series, among many other, among many things, is how Marcello Pinel releases it. As you know now, we're in the month of Aquarius, so that is very cool and beautiful plants in the foreground here. Let's see how it did. Let's see. There are four left at 42 tezos. Selling edition of 25. So selling probably looks like 18 there at 42 tezos.
00:37:14.156 - 00:37:41.534, Speaker A: Nice take in a tough market shows it's just a more selective market, that's all that's going on. And again, it shows that there are, you know, money is being spent. Collectors are still looking for work. Now look at this brilliant work of art by, as you'll probably recognize, hysterubel waffle swallmo, current bid. So one day left and 9 hours on this bid here of zero point. So fairly reasonable. I mean, what is this $30 for this ethereum? One of one.
00:37:41.534 - 00:38:18.244, Speaker A: I love this piece. Again, this is. There are so many works I could have started with in today's show. This is one of them, which is because what I love about it, you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of the Caillebotte, Gustave Caillebotte work. Was it called the floor scrapers? Let me just look here. A very famous kind of impressionist painting, hung out with the impressionists at least. I mean, it's not typical impressionism, but it reminds me of this work here because you almost see the.
00:38:18.244 - 00:38:49.120, Speaker A: You almost see the surface of the can. There's almost like a self reflexivity here of the surface of the canvas. It's almost about painting to a certain degree, this work here, you know, scraping off the surface here. But it's being painted. And I see a very similar thing going on here with the digital pixels are kind of being mowed, and then all you see the pixels being, you know, and then you get this flat pixelation here. This is a brilliant work of art. Again, really easy to have started with this.
00:38:49.120 - 00:39:07.982, Speaker A: And you see this beautiful pink surrounding here. More brilliance, really, from hastrubal waffle. And just the, you know, just a super original background. Just a super original brilliant artist here. Can't see enough good stuff. So data, lasseus starting the bidding there. Very reasonable price.
00:39:07.982 - 00:39:26.478, Speaker A: A few others came out from waffles there. Cameo, interesting. And so no listing there. Always interesting. Kind of buying mechanics there. And big shout out. Actually, Hasdrubal sent me a work I didn't even realize till AhEc said, look at your hidden.
00:39:26.478 - 00:39:45.302, Speaker A: Look in your hidden folder in Opensea, and you'll see a hastrubal waffle. One of, one. So big shout out to both Ahec and hastrubal waffle. So all to say, just more beautiful. Love the background here. There's something almost kind of trading card esque about this one. Just kind of interesting.
00:39:45.302 - 00:40:02.006, Speaker A: Here's another one. This one is not moving. And you see some interesting dithering going on here in this work. And I think it's called pocket twerkers. And, like, just, you know, a reserve of free. So $20 maybe for this work. One of one work of art.
00:40:02.006 - 00:40:31.918, Speaker A: So all sorts of opportunities here. Ov laundry et al, and this is minted. And maybe you put an offer in for some of these. I'm thinking to myself, yeah, but all to say, very, very beautiful work here. Interesting pyramids down here, and just a lot of fun. Kind of interesting contrast between the still and the moving pixels here. And then here we have a big face, almost like a devil figure looking over, who knows all.
00:40:31.918 - 00:41:02.258, Speaker A: Just very interesting. Another work on foundation. This is by Santiago. So I'm starting to get the updates on new works being put on foundation, which is super cool. I assume this is on foundation and not on super rare. This is why we can't have nice things sounding like family, dealing with family to a certain degree with a beautiful abstract here. Another kind of interesting take on this abstract style that Santiago has been working on for at least a year here, I would think.
00:41:02.258 - 00:41:31.230, Speaker A: And interesting addition of these lines in here, isn't it? I feel like in this work, we're starting to see the incorporation of some different mark making into the mix here, which is quite interesting. And down here is pretty interesting too. Maybe we can. I probably shouldn't do this because it's such. Usually they're such huge files. But look at this interesting pixelation here. So we're getting a little more variation here in this work as we dig deeper.
00:41:31.230 - 00:42:09.154, Speaker A: And it's interesting, this kind of pixelation, because it felt like either we saw one or the other, whereas for a while, maybe I'm mistaken, but it seemed like it was either SB, you know, either vector or, you know, these smooth, mathematical, you know, curves here that you do in illustrator or pixel. Now we're starting to get both. And what you're seeing here is the contrast. You're starting to see them bounce off of each other. Right? And this is super interesting. Again, this is what happens when you make 100, 200 works. Then all of a sudden, you start making what seem like obvious breakthroughs, but they're not, because, again, this is not math.
00:42:09.154 - 00:42:38.264, Speaker A: You know, there's a lot of, you know, creativity required here and just risk. So here, this looks, I think, like perhaps maybe this looks a bit more. Okay, we'll look up close, really closely. Another huge risk I'm taking here. Yes, there is some vector here. This looks almost like all vector, even the pixelated areas, whereas in that last one, it looked like the pixelation was retained. So, very interesting.
00:42:38.264 - 00:42:54.736, Speaker A: Beautiful color in this one. And always just very nice composition. And here's a drawing by Santiago, also, who I do follow. That is an x glitch. And look at this beautiful pencil work here. So just really nice piece here from Santiago. Really nice drawing.
00:42:54.736 - 00:43:14.944, Speaker A: Again, showing versatility here, showing depth, showing range by working also in the physical world. Also. Jan Lukas Migon, angel of the flame without a trace. I believe this is new. Yep, February 1. So I don't think we've looked at this. So here we see almost like an angelic figure on fire.
00:43:14.944 - 00:43:38.474, Speaker A: And again, this skeleton kind of figure here. And I think we've also seen this kind of shiny, rainbow esque, kind of bubble ish figure here. And always having a bit of a kind of heaven and hell sort of vibe to it. So beautiful colors here. Beautiful work, beautifully painted, 0.2 ETH, and it's in the suburbs. Gallery highlights.
00:43:38.474 - 00:44:01.794, Speaker A: So another platform that's kind of in this kind of galleried mode. I think it's great, the competition. It's kind of like, what I see here is a fairly friendly competition, though, to who can make the best platform. So competition is good. So you're seeing, you know, Zora make inroads. You're seeing object make developments. Now you're seeing, you know, we've seen foundation do a lot of innovation.
00:44:01.794 - 00:44:38.230, Speaker A: Anyway, let's continue here, Santiago Ruao, with another interesting abstract, this one leaning into representation. Interestingly, it almost looks like a kind of gate or the kind of structure, what do we call them that are in Paris? What do they call it a triumph also, right near the colosseum there in Rome, I think you call those triumphs. Pretty sure. Almost looks like a triumph. So this is on Zora. And so interesting there, mumble boy, Setsuban. Interesting is the day before a new season begins.
00:44:38.230 - 00:45:46.634, Speaker A: So there are four of them in a year, but it usually means the day before spring. And it was February 4, which was yesterday, as I write this. So here, an edition of two for eight tazos from Mumble Boy here. So, doing some variation here. This is what happens, you know, to our earlier discussion with wasteman gold Minevich on prolificness, to what we were seeing with Santiago. Ultimately, as an artist, you have to do what works for you, but generally speaking, the bias, unless you have reasons for it, I think your default has to be to be prolific, because the more you do, the better you get and the more experiments you try, and the more you just evolve as a person, it's sort of like, who's going to be the better writer, the person that writes one page a week or the person that writes a page a day? Like, it's literally that simple, right? So, you know, so here we're seeing just more innovation, more range, more dexterity being built here by mumble boy. And another interesting piece here, eight tazos here is a very interesting piece, also by rustic digital art.
00:45:46.634 - 00:46:22.746, Speaker A: And this is called a webcam, with an interesting little animation in here, almost like a kind of Google glasses type situation here. Playing with the video game tropes here with the hearts. And again, playing with the webcam, sort of. Here's the person looking with the information, and maybe in a meeting, who knows? And there's a pikachu figure for good measure there. And there's a smaller version down there with even the windows desktop at the bottom. So always interesting from rustic digital art. This is quite interesting, too.
00:46:22.746 - 00:47:07.494, Speaker A: Now, who is this? I don't see, like, there should always be, on these platforms, there should always be the artist's name on the work or on the page with the work add to basket. I'm going to have to probably find this on another, uh, or, say, on another show. Very interesting print shop. The th zero thoztrk dot patterns by Etsy. Interestingly so I don't see the name of the artist here on these patterns by Etsy Pro 6100. This looks like a massive cannon. I have the Pro, Pro 1000 here, which is a beautiful.
00:47:07.494 - 00:48:06.224, Speaker A: Like, this is kind of. This looks like it's in a home. But usually the Pro 1000 is a pretty good deal because the paint's about €500, and the printer itself is 1000. It gets you, I'd say, 90% to 95% of the quality versus me going to Bethanyon out here in Berlin and getting those massive Epson printers. The blacks are slightly blacker there, so it is worth it if you're doing something very special. Like, what I use the canon here for is kind of the drafts where I'm working with stuff, testing stuff out, getting an idea of how this is going to print, maybe preparing stuff, and then I'll take it to there to get, like, the dark blacks. Looking at the blacks and comparing them is the one of the ways that you can kind of determine the quality just based on experience, not based on any sort of learning or expertise.
00:48:06.224 - 00:48:24.412, Speaker A: Beautiful work by this artist. I wish I knew who it was. It was, I think, based on a tweet, maybe fath. So I'll have to try and dig that up for next episode. But I thought a very interesting kind of work here. And then you see solitaire in the middle of this computer. Just a beautiful work.
00:48:24.412 - 00:49:02.904, Speaker A: So, hopefully, I will discover who this is, get verified, or devour 500 ads a day. So, referring to Twitter here, where if you don't get verified, you will be given ads. It's also, I think, on Netflix, where there's different kinds of tiers of subscriptions. So almost like those that can't afford it will have to watch the ads, is how things are kind of turning out in some of these digital platforms. So there, of course, is the check mark, pixelated out. So beautiful work here. I'm not sure if it's a newer one or not always kind of feeling kind of stage like here.
00:49:02.904 - 00:49:37.488, Speaker A: Like almost like a stage set of sorts in this very beautiful, almost kind of dekiriko esque tunnel here, but here in oxygen's colors. So just an interesting, interesting piece on x. I'm not sure if that was minted or not. Infinite reality. This is by John. So referring, of course, to the apple vision Pro, one assumes, and a new work here on foundation. And kind of a slightly different rendering here, I think, of the skeleton, maybe slightly less kind of dithering, I think.
00:49:37.488 - 00:50:18.990, Speaker A: Sold for 0.33, and this was listed on February 5. So nice sale from John, who's got a legion of collectors here. This is RJ word art. So more experimentation, more conceptual work by RJ Armut. Instead of putting it, of course, instead of putting it on the latrine in the fountain by Marcel Duchamp, which you could argue is kind of like a founding work of conceptual art to our earlier discussion of the beauty moving from the object to the idea and Sol LeWitt and all that stuff. So RJ, playing with these ideas here in this rendering of a computer putting, you know, the latrine was signed with Rmut.
00:50:18.990 - 00:50:37.022, Speaker A: This is rmut 2024. So interesting word art. Interesting piece. Nuv 1914. Who makes these brilliant experimental gradient works? How are we doing here? We're not doing too bad in terms of time. Look how big these are. Look at how big these are.
00:50:37.022 - 00:51:06.608, Speaker A: And you gotta love this jpegged out area here. Just very interesting, but sharper here. And again, another very prolific artist. Now, what's going on here? Planta de Moneda. So it looks like this is almost like the trunk of a tree, or maybe these are little plants. It's all suggestive and all kind of. Kind of reminds me of that early 20th century, I think it was a futurist who used kind of a lot of this kind of style of work.
00:51:06.608 - 00:51:31.216, Speaker A: I'll have to try and dig up what artist I'm thinking of there. Here's another one by NUv 1914. Cerezas I abeja. Not sure what that means, but it looks like we have maybe cherries or a flower. And here I'm just not sure. Maybe an animal kind of looks like a tail, but not exactly sure. Maybe if you know spanish, it's easier.
00:51:31.216 - 00:51:46.662, Speaker A: Emilia Versace. Loving these works by Nuv 19 1410 tezos. One of one. This was interesting. Romana poly randomly scattered in the wild. And this is a cyanotype. So we're looking at bosque gracias.
00:51:46.662 - 00:52:03.074, Speaker A: Cyanotypes. Oh, look, created in bosque grazias. Let's just see here. So there it is. Created in Bosque Grazia's art residency in Patagonia, which I believe is in Argentina. So very cool. So here are some of the results.
00:52:03.074 - 00:52:26.712, Speaker A: Actually, let's make this big. And here I thought again, these cyanotypes are just beautiful. And I guess you can have some yellow in here, interestingly so, another layer of yellow. An additional complicator, as I like to call them here. So just beautiful texture here. And you see how beautiful these cyanotypes are. And that blue is just special.
00:52:26.712 - 00:52:47.938, Speaker A: That's what I'd call it. Addition of five for fortezos each. Romano poli is the artist. Here's walk with a fairly colorful. At 1010, which I still think is 911 here. Fairly colorful work here, as we see with the red in the background. Kind of looks like someone walking on the street here, maybe with a backpack, interestingly.
00:52:47.938 - 00:53:16.194, Speaker A: And maybe some destruction there, but not sure. Edition of one at auction for two tazos. So people are, they're always selling. That's what's beautiful about them. But deals to be had, their cure art, two selves facing each other. I saw this in someone's feed that, I can't remember whose feed I saw it in, but it was pretty cool, I thought, and I'll show you why. So first of all, it's just kind of an interesting, you know, I guess we'd call it an abstract.
00:53:16.194 - 00:53:47.742, Speaker A: I guess it's AI. I wasn't sure, but it kind of has that AI feel again. It's getting more difficult and more difficult to determine what is AI now because these distortions are getting smoothed out. So I'm actually not sure if this is AI. And I'm starting to think maybe no, but it's literally like a flip of a coin. And that in itself is interesting. I'll tell you what else I like, though, was these kind of little empty areas.
00:53:47.742 - 00:54:15.834, Speaker A: Like, it seemed like the edges. It's kind of like what we saw with the Harold Cohen at the beginning where the paint didn't go all the way to the edges. It's back to this idea of Warhol and celebrating the mistakes. Here we are again. And at a distance, it kind of looks like these are mistakes, quote unquote. But they actually add a lot of character to the work. Again, the, you know, typically, the novice artists, they're always trying to fill everything in to be perfect.
00:54:15.834 - 00:54:32.970, Speaker A: After a while, you start to realize a lot of the poetry is in the things that didn't work out. And you know that the random things that didn't work out. Here's another interesting artist I hadn't seen before. Recollapse. I don't think so. Rocket dream. Someone who dreams of flying a rocket.
00:54:32.970 - 00:55:04.144, Speaker A: He designed a 3200 x 3200. So I assume digital art piece. Great texture here, and kind of looking like maybe there's some incorporation of physical you see over here, but then digital kind of looks like a mix, doesn't it? So interesting work here. I'd say primarily digital, but there may be some physical input here. And there is a space shuttle. That is awesome. This is, you know, you could crop the work right here.
00:55:04.144 - 00:55:27.440, Speaker A: I mean, among many other ways. Beautiful, interesting work here. Very interesting. In the texture on the face there and there maybe is the artist, perhaps rocket dream. Beautiful title. So let's continue on here. This is Saba Sestaro, who I do follow as the algorithm caught up to there.
00:55:27.440 - 00:55:51.010, Speaker A: Here, GM. So just an interesting piece here. As you see a ton of people here. Kind of ambitious work with a hand on top, hand on the bottom, kind of airbrush background. And it looks like. Does it say one of two? Is there another one? I don't see another one here, but pretty. Let's just look a little closer here.
00:55:51.010 - 00:56:14.608, Speaker A: Nice texture and everything. And all these figures between these two large hands with different colored fingernails. Interestingly. Let's continue turkrack with an edgy work here. This is seven tazos edition of one. So very reasonably priced. One of one from Turkorak here, who loves to look at the more horrific side or the edgier side of human nature, let's put it that way.
00:56:14.608 - 00:56:40.506, Speaker A: Eating a burger messily. Greedily. I remember there's a line in JG Ballard in one of the novels where so and so was eating greedily. And again, just the kind of insight you'll find in a Ballard book that sometimes people eat greedily. And here, I think this is where we see it. I think this is what Turkarak is referring to in the title, disgustingly. Seven tezos, one of one still available.
00:56:40.506 - 00:57:12.056, Speaker A: I thought this was pretty interesting too. Again, kind of a darker side of things. The man who saw his ex girlfriend with her new boyfriend. I wonder if Turkarak is playing with procreate, that new kind of animated procreate. What was so interesting about that software is it kind of came and it went to a certain degree. I mean, maybe it's being used a lot, but I didn't really hear anything about the procreate anim animation version much after. But maybe I'll open it now, now after the hype has kind of died down a bit.
00:57:12.056 - 00:57:33.824, Speaker A: Maybe it's time to open that. So 25 tezos edition of one. Interesting. Like it kind of looks like that's what's going on here because it's kind of like this image. It's like directing an image and zeroing in on this figure here and adding the eyes at the end. So very interesting piece from Turk rack. Here's another development here.
00:57:33.824 - 00:58:27.970, Speaker A: Another great piece by Katarina create in the writers series. Playing with a few different elements here as we see the sun and then the moon and then kind of conjoining here with the Katarina create figure with the mask, interestingly, and the cloud of hair. And here on a leopard or a cheetah, which is interesting in and of itself, which because sometimes it's like the leopard stripes can change its stripes. So sometimes there's a symbolic side to the leopard in the inferno. I think it's sort of seen as kind of like a fraud type character. I'm not sure if that's what's going on here, but an interesting change in animal, isn't it? So. And of course we see the tail here around the flowers here, and then some blood drops amidst it.
00:58:27.970 - 00:58:43.950, Speaker A: And then the kind of thorny flowers there. So interesting piece. And these interesting black diamonds there. Edition of one already sold. Emilia Versace coming. Supporting the arts here at 25 tezos. Very cool.
00:58:43.950 - 00:59:06.846, Speaker A: This was minted a little while ago from Jake Studios. I was looking at Jake's Zora work. This came out eleven days ago, so I guess late January. I thought, I love the color, you know? And here's. There's a whole bunch of other work by Jake Studios there on Zora, angels and degens. So a bit of a crypto sort of feel to it, or title. And love these cubes here.
00:59:06.846 - 00:59:25.156, Speaker A: And again, the color. Nice variation in the color. And instead of winged feet, it's like, almost like fires are coming from the feet. These angelic figures here. Again, kind of drawing the pixelation style a little bit here. And then these upside down pixelated clouds here, dripping over there. And then this wild landscape here.
00:59:25.156 - 00:59:37.924, Speaker A: Very interesting. Retro Manny. Stage six battle at Orion. So let's continue the retro Manny. The Internet is playing nice. The computer is playing nice. Pretty cool.
00:59:37.924 - 01:00:20.104, Speaker A: Turn that up. So pretty rad. Kind of feels like a video game, this kind of art. So very interesting work here from retro Manny. Playing with a lot of the tropes of video games. Very cool music. And there's your work there.
01:00:20.104 - 01:00:36.824, Speaker A: And you gotta love the audio. So all to say, this is 20 tezos edition of 21 and four have sold. So nice work there. Running along here. Francoise gammer. One of one posted this, picking up this work. I missed this one.
01:00:36.824 - 01:00:52.068, Speaker A: So shout out to one of one over there. Very nice. Beautiful piece here by Francois Gamma. Another one of these walking figures here. Qam edition of 21 for 250. Nice. There's xerox there.
01:00:52.068 - 01:01:13.092, Speaker A: One of one, picking one up. Nice. Akira dice, great color in that one. Growing up is hard. So this was, we saw each of these, I think, separately from Mech TXT. And now there's an edition of 20 of, I think all of them put together. I didn't realize it was like basically a triptych of certain kind.
01:01:13.092 - 01:01:29.928, Speaker A: Huge file. Interestingly, again, I'm curious to know how big this file is. We'll have to try. And maybe it says, no, it doesn't. I'd love to know how big this is. Again, kind of crying out for a. The pixel art is crying out because it can be such low file sizes.
01:01:29.928 - 01:01:47.488, Speaker A: 303 by 180 cries out for ordinals to a certain degree. Anyway, beautiful work here from mech TXT. MicHAel Macasso putting all three works together. And another beautiful dos work here. Finally a good night. And of course, I follow mech TxT. There.
01:01:47.488 - 01:02:29.844, Speaker A: That is an x glitch. Look at this great negative space here. Great color. And again, kind of taking these Ultima four kind of style tiles, maybe inspired tiles, as we're seeing in Kyle Flemmer's review, if I'm not mistaken. What's interesting about one of the interesting things that Amec is doing is, you see, it's kind of got the two to one ratio pixels, for example, for starters. So that's a variation, a creative variation there. And also just the overall composition, playing with this kind of almost like 45 degree angle, looking down work, kind of bird's eye symbolic view of that Ultima four and video games had.
01:02:29.844 - 01:02:59.972, Speaker A: But then here, you know, making a building of certain kind and creating this kind of space here with what looks like c, a red sea here. And isn't that interesting? Like it's kind of got more space. There is development here. There is iteration past the Ultima four, you know, graphic style, which is quite interesting. This was also super interesting. Muji desk bottom. So instead of desktop, desk bottom, a beautiful computer with crazy patterns made on retro software.
01:02:59.972 - 01:03:18.734, Speaker A: Look at how gorgeous this is. Almost like metal here. And the color is very rich. And then look at this, rich in this kind of desktop computer. The keyboard, brilliantly chosen. Kind of violet gray here, light violet too. The color is incredibly moody here.
01:03:18.734 - 01:03:44.974, Speaker A: Likely deluxe paint, maybe a couple others, but looking like a deluxe paint made work. And again, just beautiful here in this gradient. Again, it looks like metal. Selling well. Five tezos each, selling out at 20 tezos. So resilient market indeed. Bolt, this is by no brainer, glitch collective and ogbone, this is ten tezos.
01:03:44.974 - 01:04:11.992, Speaker A: So interesting piece. I'm not sure who tweeted this. Might have been gogolitis. Very interesting piece here. Kind of pixel art piece, kind of playing with, you know, this kind of abstractions in the frame and in the background, but then kind of a video game feeling. And here we, you know, in the inside and pretty large work. And here's some, you know, Windows XP type, windows here, operating system, windows.
01:04:11.992 - 01:04:40.112, Speaker A: Interesting piece, isn't it? So edition of ten, selling for ten tezos each four gone and so five, I think are available. I think we looked at this, but I wanted to return to it because it was actually. I didn't realize everything that had gone into this work. So this is Suizoichi last day to start Yonaguni's auction at 4.4 ETH. So I think this expired. This work cost me around five months of ideation, experimentation and execution.
01:04:40.112 - 01:05:11.666, Speaker A: Not to mention the last ten years of searching for unique and impactful artistic expressions. Just look at it and you will get the depth. So I actually brought it up here. So this is on super rare now it's five ETH for this one of one, I think we looked at it, but again, I didn't realize that this was like a. Such an incredibly ambitious work here. Kind of a japanese writing, I think, here. And just fascinating, isn't it? I mean, there's nothing like it.
01:05:11.666 - 01:05:29.930, Speaker A: So just very interesting. Just want to return to that work here. So the auction is ended. Now you have to pay five tezos. You can always put an offer in there. Here is Slava three on foundation. And let's see if we can get a full screen.
01:05:29.930 - 01:05:48.498, Speaker A: You have to click on the individual work. There we go. So pretty nice piece here by Slava three. Almost incorporating some programming text here. Very interesting. Kind of looks like a vision pro. And very skeleton dithered skeleton 404.
01:05:48.498 - 01:06:05.276, Speaker A: A lot of beautiful things going on here, including the color. Nice piece, Slava, so minting for 0.01 ETH. So pretty reasonable there. Realm of valor, neutro's homage. So a tribute to Neutro's tribute vaults. This is by da Nyris.
01:06:05.276 - 01:06:20.064, Speaker A: So looking. So this is on Zora, kind of looking again, like a bit of a video game theme here. And there's the neutro logo going around in circles here. So very powerful. 42 minted. There's Sulkian and many more. Neutro arts.
01:06:20.064 - 01:06:57.082, Speaker A: So very cool there. That page looks great, doesn't it? Of course, on Zora you can design the page, the website a little bit. The page that your art is on here is violet trip. So another work here, the stable diffusion illustrator and after effects. And here again you see this kind of window operating system, window file edit and then a kind of AI, perhaps animated kind of manga esque figure here, or anime esque figure. And here some dithering on top. Just another interesting piece, addition of one for 25 tezos, that is on object 16 bitsoul exe.
01:06:57.082 - 01:07:42.340, Speaker A: Cool title. Nifty monkey. So I'm not sure if this is new or not, but this is called exile and it's doing quite well, as you see from the 463 retweets, 74,000 views. And here you see all of the machinations here of a nifty monkey work. All of the, you know, hyperintensity here. This one's maybe a little easy, easier on the eyes, so to speak, without too much flashing. And you see this interesting machine here, this data esque machine circling around here, almost moving this whole machine forward here as you see what looks like a bug, pixelated bug with, you know, skull with kind of reindeer horns looking off.
01:07:42.340 - 01:08:16.224, Speaker A: And then this person riding it, almost like a modern day hieronymous Bosch here to a certain degree. And these skeletons down here making the whole thing work there does seem to be a Bosch inspiration, at least vaguely here. So interesting, interesting piece here from nifty monkey doing fabulously on x. This is Padu Padu. This is a reserve of one Sol on exchange art. And here you see a very interesting pixel art piece here too. Very minimal, very interesting, very original.
01:08:16.224 - 01:08:43.706, Speaker A: As you see these kind of checkerboard pattern running into each other. And almost like these water seeming tears almost coming out of the eyes. Who knows? And these chains going back and forth could also hang in the same show there, made with aspirite as nifty monkey there. So this is on exchange art for one Sol. Adventure island. This is Chaz. And this is an edition of 15 continuing the retro arcade games.
01:08:43.706 - 01:09:09.230, Speaker A: And here we have some beautiful sky in the background here. And looking up close, you see one of, you know, old video game that I don't really recognize. It's pretty amazing though, these arcade games, they all had their own specific interface to play the game. Interesting. Easy to forget that. Cool work, Mika Oladev. So here, another work by Mika Oladev.
01:09:09.230 - 01:09:40.504, Speaker A: Not as many gradients on this one. So another variation, again, super prolific artist here, as we see another figure, another kind of bust here of sorts, or portrait from Mika Oladeps. So I assume that will be minted probably pretty soon. Usually, if I'm not mistaken, they get released on x first and then they get minted. Here's Braun, whose work we've been looking at. This abstract kind of pixel artwork, you know, half moving, half, you know, a lot of selections. Interesting mark making, kind of sampled brushwork and everything.
01:09:40.504 - 01:10:02.744, Speaker A: And then this kind of cycling. Just very original abstract art here. Digital abstract here from braun flux number six coming out February 6. So we haven't seen this one that is new feels with a new piece. And this is already 44 tezos. And also. So this is 44 tezos on primary.
01:10:02.744 - 01:10:29.602, Speaker A: And feels of course, having a very, you know, large collector base, if I'm not mistaken. Og of tezos here and here. So a new work, you know, these animated abstracts which tend to do phenomenal on x flowchild. So a new one from feels. I thought this was super interesting, this piece. A very edgy work. I could have almost started with this.
01:10:29.602 - 01:10:50.982, Speaker A: This work by Shima Gahera. Renki. By Renki. Like on a quiet day, like this is such an edgy. Like it's, it's, you know, it's celebrating, you know, we're talking about celebrating the errors. Like this is celebrating the errors on steroids to the point of it's just becoming this whole other thing again. It's like an out of focus jpeg ization and here.
01:10:50.982 - 01:11:25.864, Speaker A: But it then celebrated and then for me it becomes a very exciting work, you know. So again, another prolific artist. Had they not been so prolific, I don't think they would have made this super interesting contribution to what we're all doing out here. Shima Gahara from Renky edition of one. Make an offer, acid boy here, also celebrating the jpegization. Seemingly so interesting work here from acidboy. Again, kind of celebrating these JPEG artifacts, so to speak.
01:11:25.864 - 01:11:45.628, Speaker A: Here, this work here. And we have another one, acid rain. So we were seeing this being previewed on the laptop there. Acid rain is a piece inspired by the incredible artist gogolitis. So interesting to see overlap between gogolitis and acid boy. The more you look at it, the stronger the illusion gets. Enjoy.
01:11:45.628 - 01:12:09.544, Speaker A: Acid boy. So isn't this interesting? Pretty powerful work here. It gets pretty intense. I almost feel like my visual field is telling me to run because the floor is, because the roof is collapsing. You can't look at that for too long. But brilliant work as ever from Acidboy. And here's gogolitis, the invisible spectrum.
01:12:09.544 - 01:12:47.592, Speaker A: So we're starting to see these artists seem to be influencing each other somewhat, which is quite interesting because they're not exactly from the same animated abstract and a pixel artist, as I like to call Acidboy, the master of psychedelic, of psychedelic abstraction. And here is gogolitis, like, you know, a pixel art factory master. Interesting to see the crossover there. It shows that artists, you know, trying out new things, growing their craft. Again, the virtue of prolificness, the invisible spectrum. Cool title edition of 30 23 tezos, I think on secondary, if I'm not mistaken. Now on secondary.
01:12:47.592 - 01:13:17.410, Speaker A: So nice work there. Selling out gogolitis, composition 114. So if you buy Klaus, so more beautiful works here. I was in the gym this morning, and I was thinking, you know, Klaus, I was thinking about Mo Moe shit and Klaus and just like, run like you guys are doing. You know, it's like Mo's getting all this traffic from these AI artworks. Klaus is putting out 114 works in what seems like a few weeks when you're. When you're on stride, you know, run and go forward.
01:13:17.410 - 01:13:43.162, Speaker A: Go for it. I was thinking to myself again at the gym, I don't know about you, but, you know, I tend to. I do the classes because I do ten times more work than I'd ever do on my own and at the gym. And I, you know, when you get kind of beaten down, beaten down, you're exhausted and then sometimes you hit escape velocity. And I was thinking, that's when I was thinking about these guys. I was like, now, you know, you're. You're going.
01:13:43.162 - 01:13:59.886, Speaker A: You speed up when you're getting exhausted. Also, you get a second wind is often what it's called. And I just thought, run. Run, Klaus, run, mo. You know. So anyway, here's some more beautiful, brilliant, you know, prolificness from Klaus. Composition number 118.
01:13:59.886 - 01:14:41.672, Speaker A: Again, feeling kind of like a modern day Kandinsky series here with these beautiful works, beautiful experiments. Again, a beautiful inquiry into video art and these different compositions here into analog video glitch animation, you know, here's call it what you will into gift making. 21 Tezos edition of one available. So all editions of one, which has worked out really well for Klaus there. And here's another one again, this gorgeous violet with this beautiful, you know, light white. And then this very interesting abstraction here in the inside. This is sold to Conehead squid for 25 tezos.
01:14:41.672 - 01:15:06.072, Speaker A: And here's another one, number 115, also sold to Emilia Versace, patron of the arts. Indeed, on tezos here. So just another interesting, beautiful work here. And here again, these could hang in the same show. This is Rannix deer and DJ Quiro. So of course, Rannix Deer is going to be on the show today on the Twitter space. Bedazzled new one from both artists here.
01:15:06.072 - 01:15:52.236, Speaker A: And as you see, kind of what looks like a Ranix Deer abstract with a DJ Kiro analog video glitch over top. Seemingly so interesting piece here. This is edition of 50 for only a tezos 22 and already starting to sell there. And here is Kiro, and I believe on a solo by Kiro here, solowork. And here, again, just another very interesting addition to these, you know, really abstract compositions done with analog video software, seemingly. So just very interesting. Of course, remember the pink panther from the other day, those beautiful paint, painted, again, works where pink panther is painting flow.
01:15:52.236 - 01:16:25.554, Speaker A: So this is Elbie and Jota video art made with blender by Jada and analog process by LB. So again, these analog video processing artists, analog glitch artists, they're very easy, I would say, to collaborate with because they can just add their hardware and start tweaking things over top. So right before remixing and collaborating with these artists. So there's one by Jada and Elbie. And here is an LB that I missed. This came out January 3. Video piracy is a crime.
01:16:25.554 - 01:16:44.794, Speaker A: And there is a hen VHS tape, and there's the soup, the Mario paint icon there. Video piracy is a crime. So all hilarious. Which LB has adopted, the genuine product, five tezos edition of 20. How many are left? Maybe seven. Seven left at five tezos. Let's continue on.
01:16:44.794 - 01:17:23.178, Speaker A: So more developments here from element least. So now doing taking, you know, the pixel art and now applying it to a GLB or a 3d wood engraving, combining digital drawing and nature. So just more incredibly interesting experimentation here from element Li, taking this, you know, the pixel art, this kind of minimalist, experimental pixel art, and applying it to different mediums to very interesting effect. Interesting title there, too. Ten tezos edition of 30. And let's continue here. And Sky Goodman.
01:17:23.178 - 01:17:49.444, Speaker A: Happy birthday to Sky Goodman. Sky's going to be on a Twitter space, I believe, in March. And this was put out, I think, for, as I think I was reading on, X is for Sky's birthday here. Kind of a birthday edition, if I'm not mistaken. So a beautiful GlB here. Minerva Mx Scanlines 15 tezos edition of 42 for all sneakerheads and video freaks. Cool in the back there.
01:17:49.444 - 01:18:42.152, Speaker A: So all to say, just another beautiful piece from Sky Goodman. And here's Cota Nakazono, continuum number 190. So a new work here from Cota Nakazono as we see the familiar, you know, biomorphic metallic liquid object here in the front, interestingly, with this little cube here, and then this almost like, you know, underwater organic, you know, animal, you know, tale of sorts here. And then such an unusual composition here with this kind of rainbow esque or gradients in the background with this, you know, odd, you know, wiring, so to speak. And then just large, beautiful gray background with maybe a touch of gradient there. But maybe that's my screen. 26 tezos on secondary and so selling out on primary.
01:18:42.152 - 01:19:19.244, Speaker A: So market's not doing bad at all, frankly. Salawaki keyboard drama. This is a minute and a half. I don't think we've looked at this one. This is February 5, so I might have to go, but just to give you a feel of it. So this is, of course, Salawaki was on the space last week. So a nice feeling here and a ton of work, these kind of CGI figures.
01:19:19.244 - 01:19:41.040, Speaker A: Unfortunately, we can't watch the whole thing. But just to give you a little preview here. Look how beautiful that keyboard is, too. And you see the ambition in this work and the hilarity with the trout. So pretty hilarious, actually. So go check it out on object. It is sold out, I think more sellouts.
01:19:41.040 - 01:19:56.388, Speaker A: This is great. Selling out at seven tezos for edition of 20. So this is, you know, you got to be happy with what you're seeing on object right now. So nice work there. Here's Sabato. Fill her up. So continuing the autotopia series, this.
01:19:56.388 - 01:20:17.924, Speaker A: I don't know if this has been minted. I don't think so. But just another kind of bizarre addition to the autotopia series. One of the weirdest AI series you're ever going to come across. Here's triple zero nine. Continuing this super interesting series here with these figures. And it looks like public transportation here.
01:20:17.924 - 01:20:43.982, Speaker A: And these people with sneakers and kind of a red background there and everything. So just a little very interesting kind of urban feeling to the series metro. And here is Danielle King with a new one here. And I follow Danielle King as the next glitch. And here it looks like an artificial memory, doesn't it? Looks like from that artificial memory series. So cool work here. AI artwork.
01:20:43.982 - 01:21:05.508, Speaker A: I mean, it looks like a photo, doesn't it? And kind of intense. Again, looking real but artificial at the same times. Continuing as we run through the rest of this little cakes. Sometimes you just go with it. So a new work here. Plain exquisite corpse with input image created on improps and video created on pika. Interesting.
01:21:05.508 - 01:21:29.024, Speaker A: So exquisite corpse, of course, being that surrealist game where you can't see certain areas and then you pass it along to different people to draw. Not exactly sure how that goes here. Maybe here in this area here. But anyway, interesting piece from little cakes. And that is six tezos on primary. Selling a few there. And there's one left.
01:21:29.024 - 01:22:00.600, Speaker A: So edition of ten. So nice work from littlecakes excursion into philosophy. This is venta times AI after Edward Hopper. So interesting piece here is February 5. So interesting kind of variation on Hopper here with the skull. And here just kind of almost has a bit of a, you know, vento did some Francis Bacon works, right? It's almost like Francis Bacon, especially with this kind of figure line on the ground here. It's almost like there's a Francis Bacon remix of sorts, even in.
01:22:00.600 - 01:22:19.702, Speaker A: Up here in this Edward Hopper inspired painting here. So interesting piece here. Again, kind of a spectral pastiche, we might say, after Hopper. I wonder if there's a hopper that's quite similar to this. I'll have to look. Interesting feat there, too. This is sold out at five tezos, each edition of six.
01:22:19.702 - 01:22:38.286, Speaker A: A lot of sellouts. This is good. Look at this. Brilliant work by true face. Another work that this show could have started with today, almost, you know, evoking. Is it Etienne Jules Marie, you know, walking figures there. Early photography, you know, which was obsessed with movement, of all things.
01:22:38.286 - 01:22:58.580, Speaker A: Very interestingly and seemingly, the structure is almost identical. Let me see if I can bring that up. We got a few by Joaquin, I think it is. Yeah. Here we go. Exactly. Exactly.
01:22:58.580 - 01:23:20.444, Speaker A: This is one of my favorite artworks, actually kind of evoking this. Etienne Jules Marie. Walking man. Chrono photography. What did Ballard call him? Chrono. Ballard references these works in the atrocity exhibition, calls them Chrono. I'll see if I can remember that another time.
01:23:20.444 - 01:23:39.864, Speaker A: Oh, and I just adore this one, this stuff. I find this incredibly stylish, this work here, where it's kind of abstracting. The walking figure here. Yeah, just beautiful. 1886. So seemingly inspired by that, but not for sure. Here's another one by true face.
01:23:39.864 - 01:24:13.900, Speaker A: My mind forgets the persons I have been along the way. Of course, true face, as long time viewers will know, makes some of their own AI kind of algos, as far as I understand. So Ariel kinda in, you know, not just using whatever, you know, store bought software, so to speak, but actually creating the algos themselves by Og AI. True face here. So I think out of Latin America there. And visual adaption of the poem Labyrinth by Jorge Louis Borges. So another reference to Borges, very popular artist.
01:24:13.900 - 01:24:38.164, Speaker A: Not listed yet, interestingly. And here's just some more work by true face. A series of hidden faces in the latent space. And of course, the latent space, often referring to AI, the latent space. The hidden space is another way of translating latent. So we. I have this too, a love letter, this beautiful work here by.
01:24:38.164 - 01:24:56.034, Speaker A: By true face. And is this listed yet so just minted not listed. Never get tired of palm trees. This is probably massive. So I may. Yeah, and you can start to see the AI here. But it's almost like AI being applied and inverted to a certain degree to those Etienne Jules Marie works.
01:24:56.034 - 01:25:25.228, Speaker A: I mean, but that's pretty, pretty vague, but interesting. That's pretty oblique, for lack of a better word, but interesting. Different compositions of palm trees. I love how they're just kind of laid out here. There's something really just gorgeous and fun and pleasing about this composition. Of course, the palm trees never hurt, do they? And let's run through the rest. Here's clownvamp with some new works here.
01:25:25.228 - 01:25:45.032, Speaker A: February 6. So just a ton going on here. Already in offers coming in here. So let's see how huge this one. Look at how huge this is. And it really stands up when you look up close on these clown vamp works, these beautiful impressionist, seemingly impressionist works. But then you see the Sci-Fi kind of building here.
01:25:45.032 - 01:26:07.248, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Let's see what's going on sometimes on some of these. There's already offers coming in here. Yeah, and a lot of these selling too. So here the truth. So I think a new series, if I'm not mistaken, or at least some new works here released by Clownvamp. Here's another one, the madness unleashed.
01:26:07.248 - 01:26:37.968, Speaker A: And here I thought I saw offers coming in, but this is an edition of 40. And this is again, just minted yesterday here. So let's take a closer look. The madness unleashed. So another, just very interesting. Look at how, like, this is incredible, isn't it, how well these stand up and just how painterly, you know, I mean, it's pretty impressive. And you can see a little bit of AI distortion, but just hardly any.
01:26:37.968 - 01:27:16.420, Speaker A: And there, look at how zoomed in we are. Very impressive from Clownvamp. And here's Lily illo playing with texture a little bit here in this chair series, almost having a little bit of Marcel Duchamp's glass work, seemingly, you know what I'm talking about. So get a good look at this because we're going to bring up Marcel Duchamp. Just some of the shapes in the glass. It's very famous. Do we have, okay, kind of similar, like the chairs there.
01:27:16.420 - 01:27:46.988, Speaker A: Kind of evoking, at least for me, this area right here of the glass, which actually got broken in transportation. And then, of course, Duchamp, ever the conceptualist, conceptual, the original, the real deal, so to speak, on conceptual art. The Og of conceptual art says, okay, it's finished once it broke. As far as I understand the story. So very famous work there. So here's another one by Lily Illo, at peace February 7. So this is going to be in the fake whale drop today in that new.
01:27:46.988 - 01:28:09.730, Speaker A: So we'll have to see how that gallery, what it looks like and what's going on there. I don't really know too much, really, about what object in fake whale has planned for this gallery initiative. So we'll see here. So this works is being previewed here. Interesting AI distortion there. And beautiful background from Lily Illo. And this is tuques with some flowers here.
01:28:09.730 - 01:28:31.136, Speaker A: Some experimentation from the ever prolific tuques. And here is another one that looked great from tuks. So just doing very beautiful work here, as usual. And here's strange thing. I mean, look at how many great AI artists are. I must admit it, I'm an addict. So I guess, strange thing, loving the haribo here.
01:28:31.136 - 01:28:54.692, Speaker A: A german treat, the gummy bears. And there are the wrappers there, too, at the bottom. And this figure here with the beautiful halo. Look at that. And the stussy. Kind of combining, again, modern clothing with kind of renaissance, you know, portrayals of ancient saints. Just another gorgeous color.
01:28:54.692 - 01:29:14.652, Speaker A: The color, the color. And another work here by Iblis, by Ibled, who we started with, if you remember, with one of these Mickey works. So another Mickey work here. And beautiful work here. So again, one of these distorted AI mickeys here. And here, you see the ears, just beautiful there. Let's run through the rest.
01:29:14.652 - 01:29:33.256, Speaker A: So, salawaki, joking me today and every day. I thought that was hilarious. And here is Moe. S h I t. So another, just like putting out a ton of work. And again, continuing to grow the following. Like, it reminds me of popple when popple started growing here.
01:29:33.256 - 01:29:54.914, Speaker A: You know, this has been, I think last I looked was 4700. Like, mo is growing rapidly here. This is on Zora. So cool, kind of textured work, hitting, like, resonating with the public. It seems this is how I spend my time. Also by Mo. Another interesting kind of textile work, textile based AI artwork.
01:29:54.914 - 01:30:26.178, Speaker A: Interesting piece here, 14 tezos edition of one. Another really experimental piece by no hygiene, green headed emo, angel wings, red suit and pink limbs. Look at that. So pretty edgy. And again, I don't mind these edges, these rough edges where the paint or the color doesn't go all the way. Again, reminds you of that Harold Cohen work that we saw at the start. Cool lasers here, for lack of better term.
01:30:26.178 - 01:30:55.716, Speaker A: As we run through the rest of the show, this might be the longest show ever. So apologies there. I'm going to really try and shorten these a little bit. Parsa, most of some nice CGI. So really cool. Kind of playing with the roulette or not roulette, playing with the slot machine on the figures here and some gambling tropes and everything. So beautiful CGI work here from Parsa, most of Tim Lahan.
01:30:55.716 - 01:31:21.304, Speaker A: Tim Lahan, who we looked at previously. Look at how interesting this is. This looks like blue paper torn beautifully or maybe some sort of material. And then you get this beautiful car over top, very reminiscent of actually Giocamo Bally. The futurists Jokamo Valley. Get a good look at this work here, okay. Of the car driving.
01:31:21.304 - 01:31:53.024, Speaker A: I think it's Joe Camo, am I futurist? Bala. Speeding automobile maybe? No, here, this one. Okay. So actually quite different but really reminiscent for me. Very interesting, very interesting. So cool work by Tim Lahon. Here's another car work.
01:31:53.024 - 01:32:16.224, Speaker A: Road tripping with my friend by Nancy Friedland. So pretty cool there. This is posted by Tamboran two gallery and just see. Let's leave that one there. Hidden New York paintings by Aaron Morse. So more just very interesting painting coming out here in the contemporary art scene. Physical painting for all I know.
01:32:16.224 - 01:32:42.372, Speaker A: Actually, these could just be Instagram people posting to Instagram, but it does seem, you know, hidden New York, that's probably related. It's probably in some gallery somewhere. Martin Bruce with another work here, another beautiful painting here. So here, kind of a kind of abstract background, mixing representational and abstract. Maybe a cat with a snake. And then you get this beautifully colored kind of area here. Always super unpredictable, super interesting.
01:32:42.372 - 01:33:07.234, Speaker A: Here's Stephen Schwarzer with a beautiful abstract here. Really abstracting. Stephen Schwartzer's whole process down to just mark making beautiful, very beautiful work here. Zeich Nogun. So drawing of Oster serie hindu temple, polychromos of papier. So colored pencils, I think, on paper, pretty large work, 120 cm by 84. Very cool.
01:33:07.234 - 01:33:47.718, Speaker A: And Julia Wachtell, who I think is pretty renown. Interesting combination here of, you know, cartoons and, you know, kind of what you might be tempted to call pop culture, low culture, and these kind of more serious photographs. Interesting juxtaposition. What really stood out to me and probably why I decided to show this was actually this innovation here of taking a color photo and then just taking a strip and then making it this kind of yellow, mustard yellow color. Very interesting move here. Again, looks simple in retrospect, but to make that leap, it's not necessarily easy. Nice work by Zoe Kim here.
01:33:47.718 - 01:34:05.110, Speaker A: As we wrap up here. So this is, I think, a close up of this work here. Super interesting artist by cry for me is the name of the piece. Only 4400 followers. Interesting. Here is Luciana Guerra with a work. A beautiful abstract here.
01:34:05.110 - 01:34:23.462, Speaker A: Another week, another chance to improve your art. Exactly. Very nice layering going on here. And would probably hang really well in the same show as a demon ego. And here's a new demon ego Gm. An interesting kind of just ink drawing here with different mediums. Maybe some colored pencils there.
01:34:23.462 - 01:34:41.070, Speaker A: Looking all physical on this one here. And of course the great walk. Another one you could have started this show with. There are so many great works that came out in the last 48 hours. It is astonishing. Look at how masterfully executed the simple, happy faces. Like it's just.
01:34:41.070 - 01:34:56.050, Speaker A: Again, I always say that with walk. Just masterful. That's on Zora and Rune Christensen. Look at how good this looks. When you put it in the context of people here. This painting looks just stunning. This is going to be in London.
01:34:56.050 - 01:35:11.014, Speaker A: At the Kristen Hellerdy Gallery in London. That's on Thursday, February 8. And that, my friends, is your show. Thank you for joining me. And in the Twitter space is right around the corner here. So hopefully I see you there. Until next time, take care.
