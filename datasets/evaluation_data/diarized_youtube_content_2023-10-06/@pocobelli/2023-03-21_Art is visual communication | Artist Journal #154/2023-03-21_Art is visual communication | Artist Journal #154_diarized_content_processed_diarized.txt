00:00:04.200 - 00:00:33.278, Speaker A: I have paused this artwork just for a moment to show that the video is not screwed up. Because as you're gonna see here, as soon as I turn this artwork on, everything's gonna go blurry on my side. So welcome back, everyone. Artist journal, March 21, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Focabelli. Welcome back.
00:00:33.278 - 00:01:00.288, Speaker A: Welcome back. So let me get to the artwork here. I, again, I just want to make sure people know that this is. There's nothing we can do about the blurriness here that you're going to see now and that it is temporary. So there it is. I'm going to try and stay super still here. This is by Kappin, and we'll look at the title in a second, but I just want to give you a feel for it and just kind of a really cool pixel artwork.
00:01:00.288 - 00:01:28.996, Speaker A: I think he posted this in December, I thought, on Twitter, but it is finally available here. Time. Good title. So again, you know, this pixel art is, you know, taking on huge themes, like time. You gotta love it. Again, this kind of pixel art is quote unquote high art, fine art, all that stuff. So here you can see, I mean, the great thing about Twitter gifs is you can pause them.
00:01:28.996 - 00:01:51.584, Speaker A: And this is a really fun thing to do with UK scenes work. You know, I think we actually have an xcene work. We'll have to do this because I think it's on Twitter. And you can see here just every little bit and piece of this thing. So Kappn has an open edition, I think there's only ten minted. And there's only 9 hours left for this. Pretty stunning work.
00:01:51.584 - 00:02:28.226, Speaker A: You know, it's just a really beautiful work by, you know, someone who's actually done a ton of experimentation. We're going to see more by Kappan, actually, this episode, we're going to see plants, his other project. And anyways, just a really cool work by Kappen. So tomorrow we have a spaces and I thought we could do, you know, what are your favorite art tools here? Got to fix my hair. I just came out of the gym. I just came out of the gym here. As the saying goes, one idea can change your life, which is a very fun, inspirational saying, at least for me.
00:02:28.226 - 00:02:59.194, Speaker A: There's always hope. So come talk about your favorite art tools. Digital or physical. With Runertune, with Runetoon and myself on this week's spaces Artist journal on rug radio. What are your favorite art tools? So could be, I'm hoping. Like, my dream here is that it's going to be a big knowledge pool or knowledge dump, really, that we all kind of learn and kind of get inspired by what people are using and everything. So just kind of more of talk and shop, as they say.
00:02:59.194 - 00:03:28.540, Speaker A: More of a technical discussion. But, you know, from beginner to, you know, master here all welcome to share. So that is tomorrow. That is Wednesday at 09:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. Big shout out to Defi Boston, who picked up radar truck, which I posted yesterday. It went really fast, in two minutes for 35 tezos, a one of one from the nostalgia studies series.
00:03:28.540 - 00:03:56.918, Speaker A: And so that was thrilling. And, yeah, I mean, it was great to hear, I think Defi Boston and a couple of other people. Was it Austin? Another person chimed in because they recognized this Lego set from the eighties. You know, to me, these Lego sets from the eighties are sort of where design turns into art because they just capture such a feeling. I actually wrote a whole essay on this. I'll have to dig it up, actually. It's.
00:03:56.918 - 00:04:41.510, Speaker A: Why is old Lego so much better than new Lego was the name of the essay. And I sort of almost like, if I was to boil that essay into like a line or two. The great thing about eighties space Lego, apart from the gorgeous design, was the kind of optimism of the smiling spaceman. And then, like in later Lego, you have kind of the unhappy, you know, spaceman and whatever, and all these other guys. And it was just that kind of broad international optimism, you know, a vision for this world one could argue in the future. Like, there was something inherently just optimistic about it. And I'm a big fan of that sort of thing.
00:04:41.510 - 00:05:07.028, Speaker A: So, anyways, the nostalgia runs steep here. And it's really awesome. It went to someone who also remembers the set's radar truck. I mean, even the name that. That's the name that they put on this Lego 889. You can see the original if you do a search on radar truck 889. Shall we do it really quickly? Let's just see.
00:05:07.028 - 00:05:21.144, Speaker A: Yeah. So based on. So I use the instructions or the box. Sometimes I include the box. So anyways, there is the original. Just a masterpiece here of design, which I like to celebrate in the nostalgia Studies series. So thank you, Defi Boston.
00:05:21.144 - 00:05:54.280, Speaker A: Having a fun week here selling art. What a rush, as I keep saying, yesterday's episode, just some comments. It was great to hear from Dan Control, who we started with. Thank you so much, as always, for your appreciation and of course, a clear display of the work. I'm very thankful and very satisfied with the repeat series. As always, you managed to capture everything, and only this is enough for me, dear. In my opinion, working, studying, meditating, and observing an artistic work should absolutely not require an explanation, which I never do.
00:05:54.280 - 00:06:28.872, Speaker A: It should be all there in front of your eyes. It is visual communication. You could argue art is many things to many people, but one of the things you could argue, art is at its core, is visual communication. And if it's not communicating, you could argue for some people that might be an issue continuing. It should be all there in front of your eyes. The artwork itself, I always say here, you don't create a beautiful image to post. There must be an evolution, a progress of a basic concept that can also be amazed and simple.
00:06:28.872 - 00:07:07.188, Speaker A: But there must be. Yeah. And that is one of the things we absolutely love about Dan Control's work is it's built on ideas, and then those ideas are set into action. So there's a real conceptual element in Dan Control's work, but beautifully. He's not requiring some sort of artist statement here or some big explanation. As conceptual as it is, it's all there, communicated right in front of you. It's something to aspire to as an artist where no writing required to explain why this is, quote unquote, so important, as we often see out there.
00:07:07.188 - 00:07:26.178, Speaker A: So anyways, thank you for the comment. It's always thrilling to hear from the artists that you show here. And human boy, wonderful episode. So glad you okay, I did want to discuss this too. So happy you have decided to give us an extra 20 minutes instead of coming down to 20. Yeah. So hopefully this episode I'm gonna try and make shorter.
00:07:26.178 - 00:08:05.324, Speaker A: It is still something I'm aspiring to, maybe 35, 40 minutes, you know, like, it's a little much. And they've been dragging on the last couple of. Last few episodes at almost an hour. But anyways, I'm glad you're enjoying it, human boy. And anyways, I am trying to. What happens is I kind of go through everything that I feel like I have to cover, and it simply turns into an hour and go golitis. We're discussing the poem in Gogolitis work there in the car racing car work, actually, I use.
00:08:05.324 - 00:08:43.044, Speaker A: And he had a poem accompanying his work. And I was like, I wonder whenever I see poetry now, I think, was this made in chat GPT? Actually, I used chat GPT to help me with my poem. I provided the AI with instructions on what the poem should convey and the concept I wanted to describe. This is like a poet's dream come true, essentially, I shared what I had in mind with the AI and it helped to formalize it. That being said, I had to prompt multiple times to get this result, and also the poem was much longer. I just took the essence of what I wanted to say. And, you know, I was using chat GPT.
00:08:43.044 - 00:09:43.382, Speaker A: Get this, like, so rug radio was sort of saying, hey, can you do some block some blogs? Maybe we can get sponsorship for your spaces on Wednesdays. So produce blogs, because that's the sort of thing. And you could probably do it if you take the transcript of the YouTube and then you take certain areas and then you put it into chat GPT, and then you can go from there and you can start to like edit and then get your point across, but it's much more efficient. So I've been seeing the power of chat GPT just this weekend, and it is quite something because you get your point across. And I guess my point that I want to make here, which gogolitis is making somewhat obliquely, is we're all becoming editors. You could argue the editor, if you're a good editor, that's like a million dollar a year job now, because you can basically create your own newspaper, practically. This is where this is going with chat GPT, where you give the query, it gives you five paragraphs.
00:09:43.382 - 00:10:39.572, Speaker A: Why do you need a reporter anymore if there's sensors or whatever to get that story out there, right? Like in a sense, or if it's like taking it from something like this show, you can simply edit the content. You simply edit the content. So the editor, I'd argue, has become a very important role, increasingly important and arguably, and this, I'd say, is much more controversial, even for me. But the logic of this is that the role of the writer or the artist who's drawing, arguably with AI, is diminishing, and I have a lot of reservations about that as well. But you could argue the person who's editing the images in AI, it's a similar thing. Like, we don't need someone who knows how to draw anymore, right? Or a photographer even. Right? So anyways, that's what I was thinking when I thought of go go Litis.
00:10:39.572 - 00:10:54.324, Speaker A: Here is the editor. It kind of reinforced what I was thinking this weekend when I was experimenting with chat GPT as well. Thank you for the comments. Also, Ivan, Hugo and Skomra. Very nice. And finally, Deacon. Aigoi.
00:10:54.324 - 00:11:25.624, Speaker A: Unnecessary machine led me to wonder, is AI really necessary when it comes to art? I think not. Are we humans getting lazy? We are abdicating art to the algorithm. So here, kind of coming from completely different perspective, next will be, quote, AI will not replace us. Street protests, AI strikes is just another unnecessary tech money making enterprise solving nothing. Makes me wonder who's in control, as usual. So interesting skepticism, which is always welcome over here from Deacon. Aigoi.
00:11:25.624 - 00:12:16.204, Speaker A: So interesting. I mean, it's, if the AI works, and it seems to, then I don't have, I don't deny that it might be some big money making machine, without question, but it does seem to be working, and it does seem to be, put it this way. When I was experimenting with, say, articles, I was like, oh, I could literally create Time magazine almost on my own as long as I have ideas for articles. And then I start getting three or four or five paragraphs here, and all you have to do is edit 30 articles, which is kind of one person's role, rather than hiring 30 writers or 15 writers, whatever the case is. So interesting thought. I'm not quite as skeptical, but interesting thought. And we should always be keeping in mind the other point of view.
00:12:16.204 - 00:12:29.304, Speaker A: Exmortals. Check out exmortals studio. We'll expand back in a second. This is where I create everything. No, I'm not rich. I'm just being obsessed for a very long time. My video equipment is to the right.
00:12:29.304 - 00:12:46.152, Speaker A: I just can't fit it all in the picture. This room is constantly evolving. Things shift around. So this is what I would call pretty hardcore. I mean, the power bill alone must be insane. And I guess there's some synths here too. So this is.
00:12:46.152 - 00:13:09.866, Speaker A: I guess I'd categorize this as pretty rad when you look at this. So anyway, kind of like the black and white too. So that is x mortal studio. We're going to look at X Mortal this episode. Popple showing process here and sketch versus finish. So this is pretty cool. And this is the stadt.
00:13:09.866 - 00:13:36.396, Speaker A: We'll look at the name of the series in a second here. Saddleetenstadt, I believe, satellite city. And anyways, you just see Popple, how he goes about making his pixel art here. And this very interesting, again, kind of Sci-Fi pixel art. Again, this idea of pixel art as high art is just a really fun idea because of the. Because pixel art feels like Minecraft. It feels, and anybody can understand it.
00:13:36.396 - 00:14:12.988, Speaker A: You can show this to a seven year old, and the seven year old is basically going to get it right. It's fun. And they're going to like it probably too. So there's something about pixel art that you find in Minecraft that appeals this universal appeal. Added Sadalieitenstadt series to my boutique art page boutique art popple. So we'll take a quick look at Popple's page here because this actually looks super cool. I'm not sure if it's only Tazos works that can be shown, so I'm going to have to figure this out myself, but I think it's a pretty nice artist site here.
00:14:12.988 - 00:14:47.772, Speaker A: Popple about Popple, formerly a biologist, now a data analyst, also a freelance writer who focuses on pop culture and art. So yeah, art focuses on geek culture and art. He aims to integrate aesthetics in multiple fields to create genre crossing and intriguing artworks. So anyways, here it is. And it's just a nice way of presenting your work, isn't it? The Pixel Langton series, which also looks very beautiful altogether. Still waiting for those posters or prints. Actually, screen prints would be fantastic here.
00:14:47.772 - 00:15:42.024, Speaker A: Or just printed. And here's the sanitarium series, which looks spectacular altogether here. And it looks like you can link right to them here and even the prices are on them, so very cool. And the generative art and pixel art, gen cell art. And anyway, so there it all is, Popple's page and also some generative art that he's also worked on. List of exhibitions, so and a secret tumblr, which I'll let you go to to click on. So I don't blow the secret here, but isn't that great, you know? So boutique art, butiq dot art and just a kind of culture tweet here, cybermystic, who we know from those incredibly beautiful psychedelic works that are on super rare and also on object.
00:15:42.024 - 00:16:13.976, Speaker A: Approximately two years ago, I was an unemployed art teacher with a newborn daughter in the midst of a pandemic. And I heard about crypto art. After a few days, I found the word. I found the word that would change my life. Hick et nunc, the old website that used to be object, or that's not exactly. It's actually tea is the new version of that, but it's all on tezos and it all gets shown on object. Object aggregates, what some people call hen hic et nunc.
00:16:13.976 - 00:16:45.594, Speaker A: So anyways, just kind of lives being changed here. And cyber mystic has a lot of fans, so probably sells pretty well. And here's kind of another similar comment, this time from Cleo FAic, editor. In three wild months, we've seen a web3 fashion art explosion. It's beautifully insane. And whilst we're not always available for every venture, when you guys reach out and ask us to be a part, that's the stuff fairy tales and dreams are made of. Thank you so much, C and J.
00:16:45.594 - 00:17:07.152, Speaker A: And here we have a Cinderella slipper. So again, just kind of calling attention to this kind of magical technology which is so exciting and changing lives. And here we see it with art and fashion and. Yeah. Which seems inevitable. You could argue that's been happening for six months. But I'm.
00:17:07.152 - 00:17:31.324, Speaker A: But they're way more on the fashion tip than I am. I don't. Yeah. So anyways, a very cool comment from Cleo. Shout out to Cleo Rosatio with just some good advice that I thought was worth repeating here. Sometimes when you feel like doing nothing, the best way to do it is just to start. And this is some of the best advice you're ever going to get as an artist.
00:17:31.324 - 00:17:52.520, Speaker A: Don't worry about the outcome. This is wise, this wise words. This is deep wisdom. Open that sketchbook, start a new document on Photoshop, whatever. The key is to take that first step and start. And that is often the hardest part. And some of my favorite works of art that I've made are ones where I just felt like not worried about the outcome.
00:17:52.520 - 00:18:22.094, Speaker A: And it's just like I just have to do something and before you know it, you've stumbled. What's interesting about that frame of mind is sometimes you take more risks because you're not worried about the outcome and then you come up with stuff that you're much happier with. You know, I've had some of my biggest breakthroughs where I'm just sort of like, screwing around. Okay. So it happened to me today. I felt a lack of motive, of motivation and decided to go for it. And I got some thumbnails for the next artwork.
00:18:22.094 - 00:18:39.130, Speaker A: LFG. So wise, wise words. And this kind of goes for everything creative, but especially for art and rustic. And Mikey Wilson. Rustic digital art and Mikey Wilson are going to collaborate. So this is in on Thursday. There is.
00:18:39.130 - 00:18:58.816, Speaker A: We're going to press start here and we're going to find out what they're up to. So Mikey Wilson, following up Camp Creme. And wait until you see Sabato's work. I don't think it's a camp creme work, but it looks like it would have won the trophy. But I'm saving that for the end. So you have to watch to the end to see that incredible work by Sabato. Gloomtube.
00:18:58.816 - 00:19:27.474, Speaker A: Little peek at something I'm working on. So another preview here. And again, playing with these textured, playing with the texture in the digital art. And so the new style probably on foundation. So gloom tube up to things and Ed Marolla also experimenting. GM. How about this? And this just seems to be, you know what it is, it's Ed Marolla without pixels, like without pixelation, shall we say.
00:19:27.474 - 00:19:50.324, Speaker A: So that is interesting just to see Ed drawing. Right. It still looks like it was made digitally, but maybe just some, you know, texture in the background here. Anyways, very interesting. Very, very interesting. And here is Axin's last Gif on Earth. So the poetry of this scene.
00:19:50.324 - 00:20:27.284, Speaker A: Last gif on Earth. So a beautiful gif here and here we'll, you know, we will see if we can get the green version here. It's actually, I can't actually get the green version. So oxygen secrets will remain here. But it is fun to pause these gifs because it sort of gives you a clue into what is going on and how they are made. And of course, this beautiful kind of noise that oxine leaves in here again, which I find very painterly. Ultimately, that's what I've decided to call that.
00:20:27.284 - 00:21:09.594, Speaker A: Drank frazetta purple drank. Big shout out who showed up on last week's spaces, has a new collection. Heavy meta, which is based on heavy metal, is a collection of card and covers that blend science fiction, fantasy stories, fantasy stories with the absurdity of web3 and pepe memes. Each card, or zine cover feature familiar characters and many new ones from some of your favorite artists. So here is the preview. And then here you can see on Manifold XYZ. You can get the cards, and I think they're all going to go together, just like in the eighties there when the Star wars cards on the back would often make a big image if you put them all together.
00:21:09.594 - 00:21:43.274, Speaker A: When the window for card one closes, number two will be announced. Keep an eye for some surprises along the way. Issue number one will come soon as well, with some artists dropping super cool stories. So one of the reasons I love purple drink is because he's all about the culture. And so here it is on open sea, heavy meta. And here you can see a couple of the cards and the COVID And here you can get on Manifold XYz into the heart of darkness. And here you see the little drank, purple drank here number one.
00:21:43.274 - 00:22:13.706, Speaker A: And there is the pepe and a dragon coming up. This is, I'm guessing, based on a Frank Frazetta image. I'm guessing. So anyways, card one of six. And here it is, high boring age of Mimeria, number one. And finally here, as we get into some works here, Robnis recognizing art is art is recognition again. Paris is one big trash art exhibit.
00:22:13.706 - 00:22:47.626, Speaker A: So a lot of chaos going on in Paris right now with all the protests over the, I think the raising of the retirement age and just climb back Social Security in Paris. So, as usually what happens is the garbage does not get picked up. A familiar site for many who have visited Italy and a part of their famous strikes. And anyways, okay, so Robnis V two put out this experimental series here on super rare. There are 75 works, and they're selling. You can still get one for 0.1. And so just.
00:22:47.626 - 00:23:14.062, Speaker A: We are noise and just different colors here. Not exactly sure what the idea is, but here is what they look like. Kind of wide screen. When you go this minimal, these things like ratio really matter, because all of a sudden it becomes with minimalism. Every single decision starts to matter here. So let's just actually very quickly see if we can bring this up. Yeah, so here's the noise.
00:23:14.062 - 00:23:44.572, Speaker A: And it looks like, kind of like the noise filter, which is a nice way of creating texture, as we've seen with other artists that we're just recently looking at here. So, anyways, you can buy these. Buy now for point one. So they're still available from Robnis V two. Some experimentation here and also some more experimentation. Christian Roos, who uses a lot of retro tools or vintage software, as he would put it. Interweave one.
00:23:44.572 - 00:24:06.718, Speaker A: Weaving drafts interwoven with color cycling. And so this is quite a small 320 by 256 times four. And this is an open edition. And it is ten tezos. Sold 140. And they sold for five tezos each. And here it is.
00:24:06.718 - 00:24:24.506, Speaker A: So interesting work. And it's paired with another one. It's interesting to see the structure here. And it's paired with this one here, which almost looks like that structure zoomed in a little bit. Interweave two. And this is for 40 edition of 25. And seven have sold.
00:24:24.506 - 00:24:43.570, Speaker A: That's a pretty. Yeah, that's a lot of money for a print. But Kristen Roos generally does command a lot of money. So, anyways, we'll make a lot of money on this if I'm. When they all sell, and I'm sure they will. So 25. Yeah, 1000 tezos, and I'm sure they will.
00:24:43.570 - 00:25:08.994, Speaker A: This will be gone in a week or so, if not less so. Interweave two. Cool works, as always. Ego slice by pixel dealer. This came out about a week ago, and I'm pretty sure I missed this one. So, more just very interesting kind of animated abstract experimentation, this time from pixel dealer, whose work also sells for quite a bit of money here. It's actually pretty reasonable for an edition of seven levantezos.
00:25:08.994 - 00:25:39.504, Speaker A: How many are left? None have sold. This is, like, one of those people. How have none of these have sold? Maybe is Twitter, or maybe these are. I'm not sure what's going on, because this artist, when I first came to object. Yeah. Like, this is the kind of price you normally see is 158 tezos, you know, addition of 15, and it's still 256. So these are quite cheap relative to earlier prices.
00:25:39.504 - 00:26:10.654, Speaker A: Here you see this, 89. So, anyways, there could be a deal there with pixel dealer, because you see, like, yeah, it was never really that cheap to get pixel dealers work. And maybe. I think there's a bit of a lesson here, though, is when you take breaks in this scene, it actually does. It can impact your market a little bit. And I think pixel dealer, if I'm not mistaken, took a bit of a break, and all of a sudden, it's just like, you're off the radar. Anyways, hopefully this helps get pixel dealer back on the radar.
00:26:10.654 - 00:26:36.664, Speaker A: I'm still, like, kind of double checking. When did this come out? Yeah. So, anyways, I'm kind of surprised to see that ego slice go go lightest with a super cool work edition of 15. I don't think we looked at this. Apologies if we have. And anyways, I like how the new colors here, I like the experimentation with color. And again, those kind of newer works, like, even this one.
00:26:36.664 - 00:27:18.288, Speaker A: Again, as I was saying, to go go Litis in the Twitter spaces that he was in, I'll just show you the works that I'm talking about here. To me, these works here, these Morpho X core and scrollflow, like, to me, they're starting to break new ground in color, little bit. Like, I just can't think of anything that is quite like this in terms of color. So I'm really enjoying the experimentation that gogolitis is doing here. Like, keep pushing it. And these beautiful pixel artworks that don't even look like pixel art, they're so smooth. The jellyfish was another beautiful one, only for tazos, $0.85.
00:27:18.288 - 00:27:48.322, Speaker A: So, anyway, great work from go go Litis. And here, let's see if we can get this here mech TXT. Lunch break practice. My mind is teleporting away to somewhere nicer. I just thought this was actually quite a poetic work here with a door that opens up and kind of beautiful, serene nature work out there in through the door. So just kind of a simple, poetic work here. I quite liked it.
00:27:48.322 - 00:28:07.434, Speaker A: So, nice. Lunch break practice from Mech TXT. And here's another one. It's only Tuesday. You gotta love the positivity of this scene and that people are putting out like rosaceo putting out like everybody pooling their resources. It's only Tuesday. Don't falter, don't break.
00:28:07.434 - 00:28:27.154, Speaker A: Take a quick shelter and stay awake. Have a good one, fellow strugglers. And here is just a very interesting work by mech TXT. So interesting pixel art. Yeah. And I think a lot of people can feel that way. Like by Tuesday, sometimes we feel fried, as this person says, 94 l one.
00:28:27.154 - 00:28:57.544, Speaker A: And so sometimes you just got to hang in there and show up. As Woody Allen says, 80% of life is showing up. So Tom Bombadil with a really cool. Another cool work. You know what it reminds me of? And I don't think this is what it's from. It actually kind of reminds me of Star wars when they're in the Millennium FalCoN there and they have their little, you know, where they're in. It's in the first movie in Star Wars 1977 where they're attacking the tie fighters.
00:28:57.544 - 00:29:23.714, Speaker A: Reminds me of that kind of setting, but this is different. And so we see the laser here and this person looks like they're almost, you know, doing a VR type thing. Almost. Yeah. I'm not exactly sure, but they are going through space as we can see the cloud, the clouds and the stars in the background anyway, into space. So maybe this person is lifting off here in a rocket ship tomba battle. Ten tezos.
00:29:23.714 - 00:29:52.182, Speaker A: And none left on primary. You can get them on secondary for pretty reasonable ten tezos though. And they sold for five on primary kappan. So back to Kappan here. Another cool work, night lord, which, you know, almost reminds me of popple in subject matter. They could definitely hang some orcs in the same room. And here is just another awesome, you know, pixel artwork by Kappen, who's got this really cool style.
00:29:52.182 - 00:30:31.674, Speaker A: As far as just the animation side of things, you know, as well as many other side of things. But the animation is really, I find, original to Kappan here. Dark prophet in the description here with that really cool vertical text. And here's another gorgeous one, Tulipa Zes Niriana by plants, who's also known as kappan. So this is a kappan alter ego and just a beautiful pixel artwork of some flowers, I guess some tulips. And what's kind of fun about it is the colors change. So you can have all these different colored tulips all in one piece.
00:30:31.674 - 00:30:56.808, Speaker A: And again, the great contrast here of the movement underneath and the color. Then you have these beautiful white pixels. Let's see if we can make it bigger. These beautiful white pixels that are more static on top. And then you also have under here, the pot, which is also static with this beautiful design here. It's a beautifully designed pot. So I even like the frame, you know? So a lot of good things going on with Kapn here.
00:30:56.808 - 00:31:19.122, Speaker A: Open edition. Open for another six days. Only two minted, so that is pretty low edition so far. Let's see what happens. Other pixelated plants. And this is by someone on Twitter, Ev Sayley. And I'm not sure, this could be just one of those artists that are on Twitter, but not in crypto, and not selling their work on the blockchain.
00:31:19.122 - 00:31:41.662, Speaker A: And this did, look at this, like 121,000 views. Just beautiful flowers here. So Ev Sayley, someone to follow a pixel artist. So someone to check out here. And continuing on, more pixel art. This is. Who is this 94 l one who I believe was just commenting on mech TXT work there.
00:31:41.662 - 00:32:02.690, Speaker A: So you see again the. How small this community is. And here's just a beautiful pixel artwork. And that nice star that's moving here. This is on Solana. And they kind of look like cabins, don't they? Or yurts, maybe. And you see the entrance to them is kind of blowing in the wind here, if that's what's going on.
00:32:02.690 - 00:32:36.678, Speaker A: But maybe it's a fire inside, actually, is what it is. Let's see what it says. Snowy dusk and no description available for 0.5 sol edition of 15. And a couple of works by notorious Man XDZ, a recent discovery here. So just more, I think gogolitis actually called, tweeted something out about a week ago of notorious man XTZ's work. Anyways, here is a nice sunset, and someone looking on edition of 20 Tezo 75.
00:32:36.678 - 00:33:02.282, Speaker A: And here is at night Dreamcatcher edition of 25, available for two. And a little bit of rain there. So just more interesting pixel art here. Again, nature always seems to work with pixel art, doesn't it? A very interesting piece by Ed Morolla. And I'm kind of back to this painterly word. This is for 10,000. So not looking to sell it is my impression here.
00:33:02.282 - 00:33:28.358, Speaker A: Dolphin is what this is called. And again, back to these textures here that you see in this piece. And then you see the dithering contrasted with this kind of blurriness. I mean, dithering by nature is kind of hard edged. So when Ed kind of combines it with these kinda, you know, artifacty, kind of blurred out areas. It creates a. Just a cool contrast and a very interesting, nice frame.
00:33:28.358 - 00:33:52.760, Speaker A: I assume that's the dolphin in question. And the hair kind of goes off into this big dark sea with a few almost stars there. And then this beautiful frame. So a lot of good things happening here. 10,000. So very cool work by Ed Marolla and Eli Pritz, who I'm not sure if we've ever shown before. Just some glitch work.
00:33:52.760 - 00:34:12.900, Speaker A: See if this loads up. See if there's any volume. No volume. So just some nice, kinda what I'd almost call glitch impressionism here. So nice work here. Beautiful colors. And just let this wash over you like waves.
00:34:12.900 - 00:34:31.008, Speaker A: And that is on Tazos and Glitchtown arcade with a kind of a different kind of work. Open edition for free. If you want free art. Probably just have to pay the mint price. Let's see if we can get this working. Let me reload this. Boom, boom, boom.
00:34:31.008 - 00:34:46.472, Speaker A: So this is called Red Room. We will see if it reloads. Here we go. And there we go. So interesting work, I think, from Glitchtown Arcade. An interesting new series here, from what I can tell. And it's for free.
00:34:46.472 - 00:35:07.302, Speaker A: So it's looking pretty good. So again, kind of fits with that whole glitch video collector's airdrop. So this is for collectors maybe. Thank you so much. So anyway, interesting work. And here's. So we saw X Mortal's insane studio at the start of this episode that we are running through here.
00:35:07.302 - 00:35:34.154, Speaker A: And so this is what Xmortal is doing with these beautiful, beautiful textures here in the studio. So just beautiful abstraction here, isn't it? So that's what happens. That's what you can do. Look at how beautiful that is. So that's what you can do with a studio like that. Video synths and glitchgear video captured in real time and flipped into a gif ten tezos edition of 15. And all sold out on primary.
00:35:34.154 - 00:35:51.614, Speaker A: Sold for only two tezos on primary. So people bought a couple there. Yeah. When it's that cheap, why not trapers first? Dark Lord? I think someone tweeted this out. I can't remember who. Someone retweeted this. And I thought it was actually a pretty cool work from an artist I'd never seen before.
00:35:51.614 - 00:36:13.068, Speaker A: Illustration, but with a bit of gif and animation here in the eyes and interesting colors and everything. So here is someone I haven't seen before. First dark Lord. Pretty reasonable at a Tezos ten. And here's some of the other work. So could be a bit of a breakthrough work for this artist. Actually, there's a ton of work here.
00:36:13.068 - 00:36:22.544, Speaker A: Berlin interior wall trapers. Might be local. I feel like maybe I've seen some of traper's work before. Pretty experimental. Pretty interesting. I could see this. Yeah.
00:36:22.544 - 00:36:35.752, Speaker A: Being pretty popular. Give him a follow or her. Daniel W. An idol of perfect balance. So this also came out and I believe I got one. This is a piece. I think he sent it out to collectors.
00:36:35.752 - 00:36:55.326, Speaker A: This is my way of. This is a way of thanking everyone who has helped me and supported my work throughout my journey in this space. Just more positive vibes, which you gotta love. If you have received this, know that I appreciate you and that my dream of living off of my creations would not be complete without your support. I hope this idol brings what you need. An idol of perfect balance. Here it is.
00:36:55.326 - 00:37:15.288, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get it moving. And there it is. An idol of perfect balance. You almost wonder if there's a bit of alchemy in here. A lot of symbolism as usual. And this looks like. What do you call it? A decahedron, some kind or shape or something.
00:37:15.288 - 00:37:27.336, Speaker A: A key on top. And then almost like. You see this. This head with the bird. Almost like an ancient egyptian kind of vibe here. Very interesting work. Thank you, Daniel W.
00:37:27.336 - 00:37:46.460, Speaker A: For the gift. And Flora Marquez with a new one. And always keeping it interesting and original. So this person is wearing a skeleton suit. So very interesting. And this sold. And to mentalist 420 for 17 tezos after 15 minutes.
00:37:46.460 - 00:38:10.954, Speaker A: And now you'll have to pay 4200 tezos to buy it. So a healthy profit should that sell. This was actually. This artist was retweeted out by Flora Marquez as well. And I'd never seen them before. Many tapes and just an interesting illustrator with some animation in it and a lot of texture. This is on Solana form function.
00:38:10.954 - 00:38:25.086, Speaker A: So just kind of interesting work here. Buzz vibes. And here's another one. This is on exchange art. And I thought maybe it was this one that she tweeted out. I don't think there's any volume for. .3.
00:38:25.086 - 00:38:54.174, Speaker A: These are editions as well. Additions remain a very popular way to sell art across blockchains. Like, that's one of the big takeaways, I'd say, of the last six months. And it started with those open editions. It kind of started before that with tezos. I'd argue where it was just an edition, culture editions of 20 or whatever the case is. But it's remained a very popular way to buy and sell summer vibes.
00:38:54.174 - 00:39:56.010, Speaker A: So cool work for many tapes. And you know what was interesting? I don't know if I brought it up, I didn't see the form function work, because remember we had this open question is, because form function is shutting down, will the work, does the work show up on exchange? Like say, a manifold work will show up on Opensea, on Ethereum? And my impression is, and I'm not an expert here, but my impression is no, because I don't see that form function work here when I look at many tapes page. Right? So I don't know why they haven't sorted that out, but they should. It would be great. I think it would be very helpful because where are you gonna all those works that are on form function? I mean, where will they be seen? You know, will you have to use the form function contract? So anyways, I don't know how that all works, but I did a little check there and it didn't show up on exchange art. So if anybody knows otherwise, feel free to write me. Stuck in the loop, Louis Osborne.
00:39:56.010 - 00:40:29.974, Speaker A: So this is a work from a week or two ago, I think. Kind of a darker work. Someone almost falling down like the equivalent of an infinite elevator shaft here, and they don't seem too happy and bouncing across, almost like dan control. This could almost hang in the same room as those dan controls, couldn't it? Stuck in the loop. And this was out almost a month ago, February 27, but we missed it. That's an edition of 160 selling for $12.30. And here, a very cool remix of a tribe called Quests.
00:40:29.974 - 00:41:08.994, Speaker A: I left my wallet in El Segundo by edgeq with the super cool trading card. So pretty nice. So anyway, you can check that out, but pretty cool remix there. Buy for two edition of ten. How many are left here? Nine left. So go support edge Q and his cool remix here. Continuing on, just some of these more 3d works that are showing up here.
00:41:08.994 - 00:41:28.394, Speaker A: What is it? GLB. Sometimes you got to kick back with a few G's. Sometimes it's multiple personalities that help. So G's chilling. That almost looks like Mikey Wilson. Is that the myth? I'm not sure. Maybe PMcc 25 voice ETH and nftterrorist tez.
00:41:28.394 - 00:41:48.998, Speaker A: Me, myself and I as crush added. Okay, so uxine maybe is in here. Maybe that's xcene. Maybe. So anyways, added some glitchy furniture by party xYz. And anyways, pretty interesting to see these works here. Edition of nine.
00:41:48.998 - 00:42:16.834, Speaker A: And they are selling for four tazos and. Yeah, so there you have it. So a little bit of culture there, seemingly. I'm not exactly sure what's going on there. Continuing on, another 3d work, and I think Kapn retweeted this. I saw it when I was looking at that time work that we opened with here. Moranical Exe is the artist's desktop GLB 3d sculpture, digital installation.
00:42:16.834 - 00:42:44.442, Speaker A: So just more of this kind of crazy, you know, what I'd call 3d sculpture. But in a digital sphere, it makes you wonder without the animation, you could probably 3d print this stuff, I'm guessing. I'm not sure, though. Edition of six for 335. Left so many on the market for that. Pretty cool piece. And into AI boy with white cat dreaming digitally.
00:42:44.442 - 00:43:04.402, Speaker A: And I've never seen this artist before. I thought it was a pretty nice piece. So this is AI, as far as I understand, kind of has a bit of a. I almost want to say Art nouveau, if that's right. Let's just see what it sold for. 75 tezos after 3 hours. So that's like $85.
00:43:04.402 - 00:43:30.254, Speaker A: Pretty good, I think. Great for both the artist and the collector. It's a nice amount of money, and it's a beautiful work. The color is amazing. AI portrait boy with white cat. Here's some of dreaming digitally's other work because I had never seen them before and kind of has again like this. I don't know if Art Nouveau is the right word for this, but almost like that Gustav Klimt sort of vibe.
00:43:30.254 - 00:43:56.634, Speaker A: And you see different kinds of series here. So anyways, interesting artist to put on the radar. And Richard Nadler with some more AI art here. Neural networks. And so I almost was tempted to start with this because it almost speaks to the time. It's like a portrait of our situation, a portrait of the present here. And so anyways, a cool work by Richard Nadler.
00:43:56.634 - 00:44:26.804, Speaker A: Neural networks, AI. Here's another artificial memory from images of the weak. And this one had a nice, again, kind of painterly feeling to it. What are the name of those Robert Rauschenberg drawings? Maybe I can find them quickly because I always think of them when I see this Robert Rauschenberg drawings. Let's transfer drawings. Here they are. Yeah.
00:44:26.804 - 00:44:55.310, Speaker A: So they kind of remind me of these, like this one. Just like in terms of the composition. Okay. Because you see the composition here and you see like just how it uses, like, these big empty spaces here. This is like. Yeah, Robert Rauschenberg's transfer drawings, or whatever they're called. I mean, even here, you kind of see it.
00:44:55.310 - 00:45:18.762, Speaker A: And so, yeah, like, and here's another guy who's kind of using the mistakes, you know, just leaving any of the smudges in it just adds, you know, keeping it very rough. These gorgeous, gorgeous drawings by Rauschenberg here. It's backwards. Who cares? You know, not trying, working with the errors. Oh, spilled some water. Okay, good. You know, it's even better.
00:45:18.762 - 00:45:42.608, Speaker A: Kind of reminds me of that. These AI works interestingly. So that is images of the week. And finally, plum God. Anatomy of an echo is the series embrace. And this is by now for two tazos, five left. And I thought it was just kind of a nice AI work here and kind of interestingly fuzzy kind of depth of field feel to it.
00:45:42.608 - 00:45:57.328, Speaker A: Analog photography in AI 2023. Huge file 6600 by 8000. There. And here's Anastasia. Shout out to Anastasia for the total tweets and the support. And here, just look. I think Anastasia makes AI work.
00:45:57.328 - 00:46:22.392, Speaker A: And so kind of AI photography type work. And I thought this was a pretty nice piece here. So we are chained on Twitter. We are chained one. Mikey Wilson breaks into the AI I think for the first time manipulated image from mid journey. Remember when AI broke midjourney's ankles? It's like that Wilson times AI. So interesting.
00:46:22.392 - 00:46:59.116, Speaker A: Kind of using the photographic elements of AI and kind of painting on top of it. So interesting, interesting, interesting. Open edition 51 minted 333. So that's pretty awesome. So a cool series from Mikey Wilson or cool work. Let's just see if Mikey Wilson has done some other AI as we run finish this episode. I think when I come back from vacation I'm gonna make a conscious attempt to limit the tabs here, guys, just so I can shorten the episodes just to, like 35 minutes or something.
00:46:59.116 - 00:47:17.608, Speaker A: Anyway, maybe this is the first work by Mikey Wilson with AI or one of the first. Anyway, it seems like a new kind of work there. So always cool to see. That shoe is great. This too shall pass. That was a great work. Strange thing with an unreleased work, one that never made the Instagram reel.
00:47:17.608 - 00:47:48.794, Speaker A: And you just see the power, the photographic power of mid journey and this great background here. So very cool. And just, again, AI fashion, as we were discussing before. And if you've made it to the end, you get rewarded with Sabato's outrageous fancy ride. Your driver has arrived. And this looks like, you know, camp has gone crazy. But it's not even for Camp creme, I don't think.
00:47:48.794 - 00:48:07.644, Speaker A: It's not in the tags here, but Sabato seems to be. I assume this is mid journey five. And Sabato seems to be taking it to the next level here with your driver has arrived, who is coming through the windshield. So hilarious. Is there any. Welcome to Autotopia. Your driver is here to take you on a journey.
00:48:07.644 - 00:48:45.532, Speaker A: Generative AI photography documenting humans and their cars. Created with midjourney V five and edited in Photoshop. Text elements were made in graphics two and deluxe paint four. So again, huge fan of exporting here. And now we're seeing retro tools like deluxe paint from the late eighties early nineties being juxtaposed and used within with the very latest AI technology with mid journey five. Interesting contrast. And here's a beautiful work by wok of the meta logo with a little bit of spray underneath here.
00:48:45.532 - 00:49:11.096, Speaker A: So anyway, I thought this was, you know, this turned my head. I was almost tempted to start with this. This is like, I thought this was another just really interesting work from walk and there is a zooming in there. So anyways, keeping it interesting and that is your show everyone. So we're going to be on Twitter spaces tomorrow. Share your favorite art tools, maybe pick up some tips, should be a good one. Thanks for joining me.
00:49:11.096 - 00:49:11.944, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
