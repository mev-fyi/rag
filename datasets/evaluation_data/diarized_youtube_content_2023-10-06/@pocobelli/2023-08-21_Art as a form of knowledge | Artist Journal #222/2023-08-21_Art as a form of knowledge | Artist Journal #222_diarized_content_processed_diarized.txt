00:00:03.520 - 00:00:36.704, Speaker A: It has been a year, my friends, since we embarked on our journey across this ocean of visions. An aximander called it the unlimited. The Apeiron, I believe. Heraclitus, no matter how deep you go, you can always go further this journey through the mind. Welcome back, everyone. Artist journal, August 21, 2023. Broadcasting from the library of the mind in Berlin, Germany.
00:00:36.704 - 00:01:01.742, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and I welcome you back and thanks for coming back. It's always a risk taking a couple of weeks off, but you got to do what you got to do. Rhodes was fantastic. It really was kind of everything you'd hope for. Go visit Greece. Go support the greek people. They are masters of relaxation, good food and good times.
00:01:01.742 - 00:01:29.946, Speaker A: Really beautiful sunsets, beautiful sunrises, warm seas, everything. It was fantastic. So, welcome back. There is a ton to get through, as you can imagine. So I am going to keep it snappy. So with that, let's start here with RJ. You know, as I was thinking to myself, you know, what works popped in my head as I thought about the last two weeks.
00:01:29.946 - 00:01:46.634, Speaker A: And I have to say, it was rjs, and these aren't even sold out. I mean, so it's quite fascinating. And let me just very quickly explain why. So, first of all, RJ, there is. There are a series of these. And let me actually bring it up here. There are a series.
00:01:46.634 - 00:02:36.862, Speaker A: So, as you can see here, these are minted on hen. And there are four here in this series. Actually, there are five. There are five in this series so far. So this is probably the one that stood out the most. It is a combination of playing with the old Mac UI, or ux, whatever you want to call it, user interface, user experience, let's call it the UI, repurposing, you know, so an appropriation of sorts, repurposing the title of the window here, calling, you know, with machines, right? And then having inside this kind of framing device, this window, basically a really cool pixel artwork with a little bit of writings, sleeping fitfully. You dream of a room filled with strange machines.
00:02:36.862 - 00:03:11.586, Speaker A: And I also found this, maybe it was my favorite poetry of the works. And of course, RJ is a very poetic artist. And here you almost find what look like old radios. It doesn't even matter. Just old machines with what looks like an rgb cycle, color cycle of sorts here. And I just thought it was a really smart, imaginative series. And I loved the use of these kind of old, you know, brush patterns or brushes that make these patterns here.
00:03:11.586 - 00:03:30.350, Speaker A: And I thought it was just kind of brilliantly done, a nice use of retro tools here with retro machines. And a beautiful title. This one really just hit it off. Just hit it. For me, as I like to say, some works just hit. And this one hit. So beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work.
00:03:30.350 - 00:03:46.286, Speaker A: Still available. I haven't bought mine yet. I might have to do it soon. There are still six left, shockingly. I mean, it's a great time to buy art, if you have the liquidity. There are fantastic deals on tezos. So let's continue.
00:03:46.286 - 00:04:08.834, Speaker A: So of course, this is part of this bigger series here by RJ. Here's another one. Futility. And this looks like it's using maybe like an old Mac paint program or something. Another beautifully poetic title here. It is impossible to capture the sky. RJ was playing around with AI.
00:04:08.834 - 00:04:39.262, Speaker A: So you do start to wonder if that was incorporated here in this title file. Edit goodies was. I wonder if that's the original here too. So, very interesting work. And a beautiful attempt at capturing the sky, which looks like maybe using these tools, I'm not sure, maybe the spray paint tool, not sure. But again, just another kind of beautifully poetic work here. Ten tazos, still four left.
00:04:39.262 - 00:05:01.074, Speaker A: So they are selling, but they're not like flying off the shelves. But I think these are just beautiful classic works, instant classics in my mind. They don't need to be in everybody else's. Another day, command, repeat. And again, very poetic title here. Another day you awake and return to the computer. It has been waiting.
00:05:01.074 - 00:05:34.628, Speaker A: And here, kind of a retro computer, this beautiful patterning here, celebrating these old kinda, you know, what I want to call old brushes, or just old pixel patterns, that you find in old paint programs. One imagines. And here's another one. Mirror images, as we go through them all here, this is sold out, interestingly. And so this is available for 1485 on secondary. The room is dark. There's a laptop, laptop on the desk.
00:05:34.628 - 00:05:55.988, Speaker A: You see yourself reflected in the screen. And here we see a skull. And again, looks like that kind of red, green, blue cycle. And study here. And again, this kind of old patterning that is all too familiar for us, that grew up when some of these programs came out. Mirror images. Very, very, very poetic work from RJ.
00:05:55.988 - 00:06:17.568, Speaker A: And here's one more beautiful composition on this too. Resignation. Another beautiful title. Your laptop sits at the end of your bed. It cries out for your attention, like a cat that needs feeding. Tiredly, you supply it. So you are supplying your computer, your narcissist computer, with the supply it needs.
00:06:17.568 - 00:06:58.040, Speaker A: And again, cycling through these elementary colors here, resignation. You succumb to the call. Of your technology here. And one kind of final thing I just want to point out on this is these decisions here, it's kind of made to look easy, but you see how the keyboard, it's not like RJ is doing every little key here. There's a certain amount of interpretation and abstraction that's taking place in this keyboard. And I think that's quite beautiful and well done. Some good judgments and even, you know, just, you know, just all sorts of stuff here.
00:06:58.040 - 00:07:34.554, Speaker A: And even just the empty screen, you could have filled the screen. It's kind of more beautiful empty here as the pigeon looks on our show here on the branch on the tree outside. So continuing on. So that is RJ. I wanted to highlight this because it has been a year, and I put out. I started this show as a Spotify, and it was something I kind of returned to over, you know, a couple of years with fits and starts. And I tried again here, and I suggested on the Spotify episode that I posted here that maybe this should be video.
00:07:34.554 - 00:07:56.210, Speaker A: And Chimasuku Jackson weighed in here again. It was August 19 that I did the first show. Today is August 21, so that was Saturday. Cool episode. Definitely make it. Video would be awesome to see referenced artists work. And that's probably why the reason I actually did do video is because someone actually listened and someone actually said, cool, do it.
00:07:56.210 - 00:08:16.524, Speaker A: And sometimes that's all the push you need. So kind of a morality play of sorts there. Continuing on, Michael Macasso. Big thank you. So that was a week and a half ago on the Twitter spaces. 564 tuned in. Great show.
00:08:16.524 - 00:08:37.064, Speaker A: It's gonna be on the YouTube and the Spotify pretty soon here. So that is exciting and big thank you to Dina Chang on curation and digital art. That was a ton of fun. It was hilarious to do it on. Near the. At the beach bar there. Big shout out to that beach bar that is list that is named at the beginning of that episode.
00:08:37.064 - 00:09:00.514, Speaker A: That was a ton of fun. And big thank you to Dina Chang for showing up and doing a great, super interesting conversation. A ton of people like that. We will do it again. So here it is. So you probably saw this already, but if you haven't, there is a airdrop for those people that were on hen or Teia. As it has now become, the time has finally come.
00:09:00.514 - 00:09:27.160, Speaker A: The distribution period for the tea Dao tokens among Teia's community members has started today and will last until November 20. So this is for real. So I think, again, always do your own due diligence. But I claimed my 1500 tokens there. I was pleased to see who knows what they will be worth. I think there was about 8 million tokens that were given out, so they're probably not worth very much. I would imagine a valuation of $2 million.
00:09:27.160 - 00:09:42.166, Speaker A: So maybe they're worth $0.25 each. I don't know if they've been. That would be my kind of rough valuation there. But who knows? Maybe it's worth a lot more than that. Welcome to the Teotokens claim page. So this is the claim page, how to claim your tokens again.
00:09:42.166 - 00:10:06.054, Speaker A: Always do your own due diligence. Make sure these addresses are right. Don't trust what I'm saying. Do your due diligence. Because I don't want anybody to lose anything because they watch this. What I kind of like about what they did, though, finally on this, they showed where they have this link tea dao token distribution. They show where, you know, who got what.
00:10:06.054 - 00:10:22.288, Speaker A: So I thought that was really cool. So you see the, you know, 27,000 was the most. It's actually pretty evenly distributed. So I thought that was actually pretty cool, too. Look how evenly distributed this is. So just kind of a. I thought it was really nicely done again.
00:10:22.288 - 00:10:47.420, Speaker A: And it shows how small this is. I mean, how many are there in total? I guess there are 100,000. But a lot of people, you know, maybe they created accounts, you know, if we go up here finally on this, you know, maybe 30, 25,000. Right? And a lot of people barely got anything because maybe they didn't do too much, but it was just, you know, based on different things. I don't know how you get the dow blah, blah, blah. So anyway, just kind of cool. Michael Macasso here.
00:10:47.420 - 00:11:18.812, Speaker A: I thought this was super cool. This was posted shortly before the spaces a week and a half ago. Look at the texture here in this, because this is clearly, to me, this. Well, I don't know if it's clear. It looks like a screen print to me, with very thick paint here. And you see the power of screen printing traveling through the mediums here. And you see the power of screen printing, pixel art, because you get, again, that super sharp edge.
00:11:18.812 - 00:11:42.590, Speaker A: So. And here it looks like very thick, which kind of adds to the, you know, magistry, for lack of better term. So really cool work from. Interesting to see the physical work from Michael Macasso, who's on vacation, who I hope is enjoying his vacation. I saw a couple of shots there. They look great. Here's another pen plotter work.
00:11:42.590 - 00:12:09.114, Speaker A: And this one I found notable. We can even turn on the volume. That just sounds great. And you can see how precise these are. I mean, this looks like, you know, a dollar, like a currency bill or something. It's generative art, but you just see how incredibly precise these can be. So I just thought that was quite notable.
00:12:09.114 - 00:12:39.846, Speaker A: And continuing on, a cool physical work from popple. Walrus oil, pastel on paper and digital editing. So interesting. So popple making a physical work here and just kind of interesting. It's great to see popple keep expanding, keep experimenting with physical stuff and interesting as well. So this is a physical work that is edited digitally, Walrus. And you see kind of popple style.
00:12:39.846 - 00:13:05.250, Speaker A: And you see almost this haunted figure here within this larger figure here. Interesting work. And more physical world artwork, this time from Flora Marquez. Kind of a classic ceramics. And so just really cool, kind of her hallmark style here. Beautifully, beautifully done, I might add. Looks better.
00:13:05.250 - 00:13:31.242, Speaker A: You know, the thought in my head is, looks better than a Picasso ceramic. Those things, I mean, they're all right. Maybe if I went back to the Picasso ceramics, I'd love them. But anyway, beautiful work from Flora Marquez. Just more physical renditions here. Charles AI first printed piece getting ready. So it's interesting to see how AI is going to be physically rendered.
00:13:31.242 - 00:14:04.284, Speaker A: We're looking at art matter and the big oil painting machine. But there's also, you know, just a straight up, what looks like an inkjet print here of one of Charles AI's work works. And of course, paper looks quite high quality and beaut. You know, if you ever ship this stuff, it's always great to have that tissue paper too. It really gives a nice feeling. You can tell it's pretty thick paper. Hannah Muller is a famous, you know, 380 grams paper, if you don't know where to start, is a good paper to look for.
00:14:04.284 - 00:14:49.098, Speaker A: First printed piece getting ready. That's kind of what this looks like, but who knows? So Charles AI doing some physicals just on the conceptual front, the visionary front here. William Gibson at Great Dismal. So the author of Neuromancer, which actually, I haven't read a year or so, more of this and Ballard will easily appear to have been more prophetic than Heinlein. Heinlein, referring to Robert Heinlein, the science fiction writer. At first I thought, oh, cool, William Gibson is recognizing Ballard. And then I thought, well, you know, to me, like Ballard, this happened 20 years ago, arguably longer.
00:14:49.098 - 00:15:12.042, Speaker A: Like, in a sense, in my universe, Ballard has never been outclassed by Heinlein. But I'm not a Heinlein expert. I tried reading some of it. I always thought, and feel free to disagree. I'm sure there are people watching this who might know much more about Robert Heinlein than I do. But I always thought it was Sci-Fi for teenagers, actually. But I was looking on Wikipedia just to do a bit of background.
00:15:12.042 - 00:16:12.666, Speaker A: I guess he was pretty intent on the hard science part of it and trying to make it realistic. So maybe he made a lot of predictions in that respect. What made Ballard special is he was able to psychoanalyze almost like anthropologists of sorts. He was able to psychoanalyze the human being in a very radical, accurate, arguably, in a very accurate way. And that is why many of these kind of things we're seeing today, you can sort of see an early kind of shockwave in reverse, backwards through time in Ballard's work, because he was able to do one of the great missions of art is human nature. Okay? And I mentioned this before. If we go to Tom Jones by Henry Fielding.
00:16:12.666 - 00:17:33.314, Speaker A: If we go to Tom Jones by Henry Fielding, I could actually bring up that introduction right now, and we should. But what we see in there, as I've mentioned before, is that that novel, which is considered one of the first, right up there with Samuel, I think, Johnson's Clarissa. What we see in Tom Jones in the introduction that Henry Fielding writes is human nature is our subject matter here. That is our banquet that we're going to feast on throughout this entire novel, you know, again, one of the first novels in the english language. And so there is a whole tradition in the arts, writing and visual arts, where human nature is the main kind of subject matter. Again, I bring up this term qualitative science, this investigation, in a sense, art, not just for art's sake, but art as a form of knowledge. Okay? And here we're seeing evidence, you know, as William Gibson has pointed out, that there is actually a knowledge, a real knowledge that, you know, not a, you know, quantitative, but a qualitative knowledge that is out there that can be identified.
00:17:33.314 - 00:18:01.982, Speaker A: So I just thought this was a really interesting tweet that came out a couple of days ago. This was quite interesting. So doctor, version after, I think it was last with the Dina Chang Twitter spaces. During the Twitter spaces, I was mentioning these fake Basque. And I thought this was kind of hilarious, actually. So Doctor Virgin posted this afterwards. The Orlando Museum of Art had an entire show of basque forgeries back in 2022.
00:18:01.982 - 00:18:39.544, Speaker A: Really quite an astonishing story. And it ultimately led to an FBI raid. I spoke about this a few times on Pokebelly space. Thought I'd share. What I found kind of hilarious about this is would you ever imagine in a million years that that's a Basque? Like the fact that anybody at the thedias Mumford Junior Venice collection thought that, like, the fact that it actually got on display here. To me, this is quite clearly obvious. You know what this is? This is a painting without the poetry.
00:18:39.544 - 00:19:00.016, Speaker A: This is a Basque without the poetry. Because, of course, anybody that's looked at Basque knows every little mark is full of poetry. That's what makes them so beautiful. They're incredibly beautiful. Whereas these marks, there's nothing kind of special about them. And it actually shows how good of an artist basque is. When you see, in contrast, when.
00:19:00.016 - 00:19:29.348, Speaker A: And the fact that anybody thought that they could get away with this is quite hilarious. And that it got that far, it raises a lot of questions. Let's just put it that way. So thank you for posting that. And again here in the art newspaper, auctioneer who had admitted he helped make fake Basque had seized by the FBI, avoids jail time. And it's obvious here, too. It's not as obvious as that last image, but as you can see here, this is like you or me quickly putting some stuff together and.
00:19:29.348 - 00:20:12.124, Speaker A: But none of the poetry of a Basque here. It's quite amazing this got that far and only paying a fine, usually for forgeries, especially in the millions of dollars. Maybe it got kind of stopped before people spent money on it. Not sure. So, speaking of authorship, Leonardo da Vinci's, and this is a questionable attribution, by the way. I mean, here's art news calling it Leonardo da Vinci's $450 million Salvatore Mundi painting gets the NFT treatment. So first of all, just on the authorship here, I am highly skeptical on this.
00:20:12.124 - 00:20:48.968, Speaker A: And it's almost like the same argument here. The only part that I think may have had Leonardo in here is here. This looks like student work, which is what I said way at the very beginning of this controversy when this was first released and discovered. This has none of the poetry of a Leonardo. You look at the hair even. It's just the poetry is kind of what's missing. So even here, even here, like, if you look at a Leonardo or Raphael, when you look at the belts, when you look at the.
00:20:48.968 - 00:21:17.518, Speaker A: This stuff, when you look at the neck, you will see poetry everywhere. Okay. And the only place I see poetry is right here. So enough of the tangent. But I did kind of want to keep it with our forgery subject matter here. So I just wanted to also highlight the NFT side of it. The digital asset platform Elmonx will mint the NFT in collaboration with the image licensing company Bridgman images.
00:21:17.518 - 00:22:03.610, Speaker A: Terms of the sale. So I'm not exactly, you know, I find this highly questionable, this whole idea that we're going to take old paintings and then we're going to make, they're actually making an addition. According to the Elmonx website, there were 330 editions of. I guess they did this with the Mona Lisa. NFT sold at $191. Additionally, ten editions of a bundled NFT and print version of the Mona Lisa was like, to me, this is highly questionable. One of them was resolved, like, who's, you know, is, even if the Louvre is doing it, who is it for the Louvre to be minting a Mona Lisa? And I'm not even sure the Louvre is doing it.
00:22:03.610 - 00:23:14.654, Speaker A: So the whole thing, you know, and they've been doing this with Van Gogh and why are there 330? Is that because Leonardo said we should have 330 editions of this? So the whole thing is just highly questionable here. And, yeah, so just kind of interesting, we've been mentioning finally, we've been pointing out for a couple of months here since may that there are tremors in the art market as far as just a, there was the auction that didn't go well. And this is quite interesting just from a valuation and just to kind of look at the contemporary art world and what is happening there. So we have a new story August 11 from Katya Kazakhina, one of our favorite reporters here, the art detective. And from Artnet News, the exuberance that gripped the art trade for the past two years has dissolved. Here's how to get an edge in the buyer's market. So just more evidence that the kind of fissures we were seeing at the beginning continue.
00:23:14.654 - 00:24:07.524, Speaker A: And it just kind of goes to show that, I think, you know, how like, sometimes we make light of the flippers and everything. I think it just goes to show how much of a, you know, speculative aspect there is to the contemporary, the traditional art scene. And I just like, I just find it notable that, you know, and here's, here's a real Basquiat. See, you can tell even from way over here that this is like a real basque. So all to say, the, the traditional art world continues to kind of slow down. It's kind of being confirmed, let's put it that way. Continuing on, this became a big debate.
00:24:07.524 - 00:24:33.894, Speaker A: I don't want to dwell on it too long. Opensea is going back. I thought they already got rid of royalties. We launched our operator filter. So they're just kind of chasing their tail on the royalties subject here. We launched our operator filter so creators could restrict secondary sales to web3 marketplaces that enforce creator fees. So we tried to save the day, but we relied on opt in by the entire ecosystem.
00:24:33.894 - 00:25:15.364, Speaker A: You know, kind of an unrealistic proposition. Did they really believe they were going to get the entire ecosystem? Seems kind of wishful thinking, doesn't it? But we relied on an. So you're relying on something that was totally implausible but continuing on, which didn't happen, shockingly. So we're making a few changes to our approach. So they're basically going to get rid of pain, you know, creator fees, as they call them, you know, artist royalties is another word. Move to optional creator fees and all. Second, so basically they're going to give people the option to not pay the royalty.
00:25:15.364 - 00:25:58.792, Speaker A: And you can read all the details here. I'm kind of over the whole thing. And the fact that they're still kind of trying to work this out in their brain continues to disappoint and continues to just, you know, a perpetual letdown. I mean, I don't know what else to call it. What do you call it? You know, feel free to leave a comment. Am I wrong? You know, so Mark Cuban, who is a, you know, pretty successful entrepreneur and an investor in Opensea, not collecting and paying royalties on NFT sales is a huge mistake by OpenSea. It diminishes trust in the platform and hurts the industry.
00:25:58.792 - 00:26:51.728, Speaker A: And I say this as an OpenSea investor, Devon Pinzer. So kind of naming names and shaming very small account there, interestingly so, absolutely. People underestimate the power of soft power, you know, which is what values, people really underestimate the power of values. You know, if you are in a relationship for a long time, you know, what spans decades, at the end of the day, it's probably values, shared values that is keeping you together here. So Opensea lets go of their value. So of course, yeah, so of course we don't need to dwell on this. And sure, there are many arguments that could be made in favor of Opensea.
00:26:51.728 - 00:27:31.706, Speaker A: They're doing it to survive, Blur, etcetera. Robnis, 1983. Truth be told, even from the beginning, Opensea never put a lot of the original gangsters, ogs, projects on the front page. So I really could care less what happens to them. They always pumped whatever they chose and let the rest of our contracts sit on the sidelines. I've never forgotten that. And one tweet, I didn't bring up, I guess, yuga labs, you know, the bored apes collection, I guess they're gonna take, I don't know if they're, I think all new collections, I don't know if they can take their old collections off, but anything new they're not gonna put on OpenSea, which the importance of that is.
00:27:31.706 - 00:27:57.550, Speaker A: It's probably the biggest source of revenue, if I had to guess, to Opensea was probably Yuga labs. So just kind of interesting there. And finally, object.com dot. We will always respect royalties and tweeting, retweeting a tweet from November 7. So again, this debate, it's kind of sad that it's had, that it keeps going and then it keeps like they keep going back and then there's pushback. So it's just kind of sad.
00:27:57.550 - 00:28:25.494, Speaker A: So credit to object, you know, you have to give credit to object. Here's why. Object will not switch to 0% royalties and committed to putting creators first. So, you know, if I was object, and I don't know if they're working on this, it would be great. But if I was object, I don't know why they're not making going multi chain and getting their. Because they have a better uI, I would argue, than opensea. And then why can't you do ethereum based tokens? I don't know.
00:28:25.494 - 00:29:11.906, Speaker A: There's probably a good reason for it, but I just think it's interesting. Strange thing, kind of an enigmatic statement here. Henry Ward Beecher once said, every artist dips his brush in his own soul and paints his own nature into his pictures. Back to our earlier discussion on human nature and paints their own inner world in their pictures nowadays. And this is what I was highlighting. AI powered brushes are diving into the depths of imagination that even the masters couldn't have even dreamed of. Now, I'm just kind of curious, are there AI powered brushes or is strange thing talking a bit metaphorically? I don't know, but interesting and cool work here.
00:29:11.906 - 00:29:48.026, Speaker A: Interesting work. I assume this is an AI work and kind of strange things signature here. Just kind of. So artist in the studio from strange thing, and here's popple showing a little bit of behind the scenes. So of course we remember this work from, I think it was called sanitarium, that series, and this great reflection there. So this is loosely based on this, actually quite closely based on this tuftar by the great John work versus inspiration. So that is pretty cool and a beautiful interpretation here by popple and beautifully done.
00:29:48.026 - 00:30:10.596, Speaker A: So just, you know, more credit to popple. Here, as he connects himself with the tradition. And here was an interesting work, or post Galena nicitina, who makes really beautiful work. I think Ed Marolla was just singing the praises of Galena nicotina with kind of a sad post. I'm tired, friends. I'm tired. I'm working every day, like, 30 years.
00:30:10.596 - 00:30:18.604, Speaker A: I'm still not salesman for my paintings. I'm still poor. I don't know what to do next. I can only do this. I can do only this. I'm only an artist. Yeah.
00:30:18.604 - 00:30:42.136, Speaker A: And this is the reality, really, for most artists. And look at how great this artist is. So hope springs eternal, and that is just the, you know, unfortunately, that is the artist's life. Otherwise, everybody would be an artist who doesn't want to make pictures for a living. So it's a tough world. But I don't know. I could see Galena and nicotina breaking through at some point here.
00:30:42.136 - 00:31:04.694, Speaker A: Aksine, kind of along the similar lines here. An artist that has broken through artist checklists. Live in a small, windowless apartment with constant noises. Consume instant noodles as a daily dietary staple. Endure a three hour commute for a ten hour workday. That sounds like very likely based on oxen's life. Avoid any time off or breaks.
00:31:04.694 - 00:31:32.510, Speaker A: Distance oneself from conventional societal norms. So, just echoing the point here on the realities of being an artist, it's not an easy domain. So into our works here, finally. How are we doing here? Half an hour? Okay, we're going to run through this beautiful work here by uxine. Let me just make sure we have this. Let's do this. Okay.
00:31:32.510 - 00:32:11.006, Speaker A: So beautiful work here by euxine. Actually, one of my favorite. A favorite subject matter, doing these old kind of retro action figure packages. I did this, actually, in my nostalgia studies series. But Xing does his own version, cyborg Reaper, because they're so cool. But I mean, totally makes it his own, gifies it, you know, crypto art, death transcending traditional boundaries, becoming a force that exists beyond the realms of both biology and machinery. So that kind of iron, ironic sense of humor and even the things, the halo around the person.
00:32:11.006 - 00:32:51.816, Speaker A: Almost like the monk figure as an action figure. So almost like the axine character as an action figure. And this is great, too. The eyes making it look easy here again. And this is beautiful, too. Taking this kind of script and pixelizing it, pixelating it, you know, turning into squares, really, you know, again, making it look easy and showing dexterity, you know, even here, keeping that original, like, because that makes it even more worth more if you ever collect Star wars action figures, which I never did, but I paid attention. If you have this part inside, well, that's worth even more.
00:32:51.816 - 00:33:12.496, Speaker A: So mint condition over here. Beautiful. And look at all this. Just making it look easy. Just a master here. Speaking of, you know, again, dam control continues to dazzle here. Again, I think 21 years old, with a stunning, stunning mythological work here.
00:33:12.496 - 00:33:34.778, Speaker A: This is Minotaurus immersed in the labyrinth. He wanders edition of 20. There are still seven left, I guess, selling for 18 tezos, so at a higher price here. But of course, tezos is at $0.70, so it's not crazy. And this is quite an ambitious work here by Dan control. Beautifully done here.
00:33:34.778 - 00:34:07.622, Speaker A: And so I'm not sure if this is Jason and the Argonauts or Hercules. Here is the Minotaur. And I want to say it's like Jason, but I'm not actually positive on that. Cool little thing here and nice little gradients in the background there. You've seen, like, the evolution of Dan's style here. Like, you're really seeing, like, these little kind of chunks here, really interesting details here. Like, it's changing.
00:34:07.622 - 00:34:27.414, Speaker A: The nature of these works is changing, even showing the muscle, but not going too far. Right. We're discussing that with RJ. Kind of the interpretation. How far do you go? Right. I mean, that is part of the art. It's kind of one of those things that is a more indirect thing that is not as obvious.
00:34:27.414 - 00:34:59.764, Speaker A: Right. But that's one of, like, a very important thing. It's how you interpret what you decide to keep, what you decide to get rid of when you're using a reference, for example, or when you're trying to portray an object. Now, another just really cool thing is you see the labyrinth here. The interpretation of the labyrinth is also brilliant here because it's almost like this maze. And there is a slight difference between a labyrinth and a maze. I looked it up about six months ago.
00:34:59.764 - 00:35:32.154, Speaker A: My girlfriend was asking what the difference is. There is a slight difference here, but what I love about it is actually these kind of gradients that are in here, which just add a kind of complexity that was probably required from a design point of view. When Dan control was composing it, he probably had simple green blocks to begin with. And it was probably a little simple. Then adds this beautiful interpretation of the wall here, this labyrinth wall. And beautiful. And look at the hair.
00:35:32.154 - 00:35:59.046, Speaker A: I mean, it's tempting to make this big, but we simply have too much work to go through. But beautiful, beautiful work. Look at Padrino. Padrino I came so close to starting with this. This is a super cool work here, a beautiful surrealist work. Now, this is the still version. And I'm just thrilled because Padrino started maybe, I guess it's probably been four months ago, if that started making works.
00:35:59.046 - 00:36:19.646, Speaker A: And then you. Within four months, few months, we start seeing really beautiful work here. Like, just in terms of the composition, I think the others might have. Not exactly. We can open it very quickly here. Yeah. The others were like portraits, remember? Like, to me, like, look at these.
00:36:19.646 - 00:36:46.076, Speaker A: This is like another order of magnitude of ambition, you might say, in the composition. Right. And let me show you the moving version. And there's something else. Remember, I talk about the tension of copies, the tension of digital copies. So this is the dynamic version, right? And you see kind of in the zeitgeist here, aliens kind of with this guy, you know, looking over the sea. I can kind of relate to that a little bit.
00:36:46.076 - 00:37:01.488, Speaker A: It kind of feels like Rhodes there. Rhodes grease. I love the cactus. Really cool. But if we look communion and communique. So this one is moving edition of 15. And then this one is static.
00:37:01.488 - 00:37:28.114, Speaker A: And I think it's an open question, actually, which is the preferable one. And everybody can make their own mind. And there's another interesting issue, is you look at the ratio. This one is, you might say, uncropped. This one is more cropped. I actually think I prefer the static, just personally, even though they both have their charms. And it's a tough decision, but it's kind of an interesting thing here.
00:37:28.114 - 00:37:49.864, Speaker A: So, cool conceptual game here. I mean, we saw that in Ratcloak a little bit, this tension of making a digital copy and playing with that. I find this incredibly interesting and how that works in the market. Right? So. And again, this one's slightly different. So there's a tension there, though. Right.
00:37:49.864 - 00:38:13.764, Speaker A: You know, again, oh, should that person be copying but. But playing and just going to the edge and then having. Being able to kind of have a. Being able to provide people with a justification, which I think we do, it is different enough. One is dynamic, one is static. The composition ratio is different. You know, some people might prefer the dynamic version.
00:38:13.764 - 00:38:41.426, Speaker A: Right. So there's enough kind of dialogue between these works that we go, okay, right, that's fine. Right? But there is a tension continuing on. Cool collaboration here between rosatio and rinifish. Let me just get it going here. It's kind of amazing this hasn't happened earlier. So of course we see rosatio, you know, the eyeball iconography and almost like they're playing with each other.
00:38:41.426 - 00:39:11.184, Speaker A: It's almost like this is Rosatio and this is rinnefish, and they are having fun and all their characters together and everything, so just a really cool collaboration. Shellshock. Very cool title playing off of Seashell, and so very cool here. And now 57 on secondary. Only one available, and they sold for eleven on primary. So congrats to the sale. 20 editions.
00:39:11.184 - 00:39:29.024, Speaker A: PP universal continues to impress. I saw this on Instagram. A beautiful black and white work here. Beautiful portrait. Really original work, as usual. Nice use of the black and white. Kind of desaturating everything, I imagine.
00:39:29.024 - 00:40:03.134, Speaker A: Just a very nice piece here from PP. So just really enjoying watching that artist develop your ratcloak with some super original works here. This is massive, 8000 by 3500 pixels. Now on secondary for 95 tezos, and selling on primary at and all sorts of at 35 tezos each. So let me just bring this up here. Very interesting composition. Kind of has a bit of a boardroom sort of feeling at the.
00:40:03.134 - 00:40:52.074, Speaker A: At first, because I see all these, you know, almost like a board of directors thing, but then maybe you think, oh, maybe this is like an artist sitting in a chair, and then you're just not sure it's the same artist, you realize, and then it's kind of turning. I've never seen a work like this before. And fascinating color again, it's sort of like, I talk about graphic design as the thankless profession, because when you do it right, people go, of course. And that's kind of how this color is. Here you go. Oh, of course, this olive green and this deep purple can work together nicely, but it's actually quite creative. You know, all the philosophy, the visual philosophy, all of the thinking, all of the experience that goes into being to having the courage to put these colors together and go, yeah, in fact, this is beautiful.
00:40:52.074 - 00:41:27.624, Speaker A: Again, it's kind of like, remember ratcloak was saying on the last works we looked at, it's about color. There's is very much, I would argue, in that line of color experimentations and explorations. We have another one, this one a bit more. A bit more narrative, we might say. And kind of a dark work here. Again, kind of like that bacon feeling over here, and, you know, kind of a target practice with real people underneath. And of course, Ratcloak is in Ukraine, so you do wonder if there is a subtext here.
00:41:27.624 - 00:41:50.664, Speaker A: So a dark work here from Ratcloak, full of possible interpretations. The head being blown open here by an axe and blood everywhere. A dark work. And infinity. 1234 infinity. So off you go. Interesting color again.
00:41:50.664 - 00:42:13.824, Speaker A: So red and green opposites on the color wheel. So complementary colors. So interesting there. And nice use of color in the numbers. Continuing on, Bzzaya, the last pink dance. So the final of this, what was it called? Sky paradise. The sky is the limit.
00:42:13.824 - 00:42:49.202, Speaker A: The last pink dance. So I believe Buzzaya was saying online, on Twitter, on x, that this is the final work. So kind of a grand finale here. And this looks like almost Kim out of North Korea slam dunking things, and then the bull and everything. So all the mayhem of a buzzaya work here, even like the crazy dinosaur, the great color and everything, the texture. Let's just see. Lots of offers on it and accepted offers of 27 tezos.
00:42:49.202 - 00:43:11.880, Speaker A: So a nice 270 tezos for bizaya in a tough market. This was interesting. I don't know if I've ever seen Quetzalgelo. Sad boy's anthem is the series. Flora's lava is the name of the work. Kind of an interesting piece here. Looks like a digital work, but quite painterly.
00:43:11.880 - 00:43:39.916, Speaker A: Has kind of, again, this kind of Internet iconography with the cursor, the messaging, and the floor on fire. You have some kind of retro tech here. This figure maybe in the tech, and then this kind of mysterious, you know, figure with almost made of, you know, outer space and galaxies and then this upside down animal. So just a mysterious work now. Nice texture. Balloon. Did anything happen? Sold for 0.3
00:43:39.916 - 00:43:56.220, Speaker A: to Medici emerging 23. So 0.3 tezos. Interesting work. Continuing on. I thought Santiago did a brilliant job with this tez down. So probably asked by the Tesnown people to make it work.
00:43:56.220 - 00:44:25.388, Speaker A: I thought this was quite a brilliant solution. Looks again, it's easy to look at these solutions in retrospect and go, of course, of course. That's what should have happened. But quite brilliant, if you ask me. It's making it look easy, basically taking a work and putting the Tesna on glasses on it. I'm sure a little more than that. And then maybe a couple of layers on top, but I thought quite brilliant.
00:44:25.388 - 00:44:48.760, Speaker A: Edmarrolla put out quite a few works. I decided to take plant portrait almost randomly. I kind of like swamp. It's almost like a swamp thing type figure. And this person made of plants. And again, playing with this kind of profile picture structure and interesting framing here and everything, and just kind of an interesting work. Interesting outline here with this brush.
00:44:48.760 - 00:45:09.034, Speaker A: So very cool. Ed's going to be on a spaces in a week and a half, so I'm thrilled about that. I think he's on vacation this week. So this is a one of one for only $38.44. And there are a few that are available. Here is an edition of 16 for three tazos, abstract, two. Interesting title.
00:45:09.034 - 00:46:00.364, Speaker A: And here is just a person maybe smoking a cigarette, a very long cigarette here and with some interesting patterning, classic ed marolla colors, but adding a brown in here in the skin color. So kind of interesting there. Eight left for three tezos. And this was quite interesting as well on the Edmarola front, algarveen dream with love from a 2018 dream. So this is a one of one for 70 tazos, less than $50, by the way, kind of a slightly different style here. And we do see, I don't know if you can see it, but there is a slight dithering that goes in this gradient, but all so slight and kind of a, you might say the dithering, there's not too much dithering, though. The pixelation has been minimized.
00:46:00.364 - 00:46:38.914, Speaker A: Kind of going closer to an RJ type feeling or some of the Microsoft paintworks by ratcloak. Interesting composition, isn't it? And so maybe a woman by a pool, perhaps, but just from, you know, the outside here. Interesting, interesting composition. Now, also interesting is the account it came from, Eduardo Pulitzer, which is Ed Marolla's, you know, quote unquote, real name. Ed Morolla other self, the first work here. So you can get Eduardo Pulitzer's genesis here for only 70 tezos here. So it'll be interesting to see how this develops.
00:46:38.914 - 00:47:26.612, Speaker A: Burka Bayram with a beautiful last Supper homage here. And so almost looks like a pepe figure here. And I thought, quite brilliantly done. Again, it's kind of another kind of technique we've long discussed here, which is this idea of, first you make your outlines, let's say, and then you use the outlines as an opportunity to put different kinds of patterning, whether it's different kinds of brushes, as we saw, see, with human kernel, or here in Burka Byram's case, different kinds of just patterning. Right. So different kinds of shapes and styles of shapes and everything so instantly recognizable as the last Supper. Here's the doorway, by the way, in Milan.
00:47:26.612 - 00:47:48.176, Speaker A: I don't think I've, I haven't been to this because you have to buy a ticket, like a couple of days ahead of time. If you ever go to Milan, buy the ticket ahead of time. It is in Milan Sabato, with some cool works here. So this is on Zora where Sabatto is having a lot of fun. Le mystere Mario paint. A really beautiful. Let me open this in a new tab.
00:47:48.176 - 00:48:14.784, Speaker A: They really, maybe I just can't find the maximize, but they really do need a maximize button there. So I thought this was quite brilliant and beautiful from Sabato. So another glitch work. Let me see. So playing with Mario paint, right? So that's kind of one meta, but then glitching it. Doing the ROM glitch on the Mario paint game. So kind of a double meta for lack of better term here.
00:48:14.784 - 00:48:50.084, Speaker A: And playing with the user interface as we're going to see. So as we saw with RJ at the start, you know, user interface as subject. Very long work here too. I mean, a few 15 seconds maybe. So here's the UI, and we're going to see that in other works here, too. So first, let's look at this one, this one of, one from the Barbie world, Nintendo glitch rom. And this is, I found this kind of humorous, this kind of car going through that's completely, you know, just blown, you know, for lack of better term, deconstructed.
00:48:50.084 - 00:49:14.174, Speaker A: Not really the right use of the term there, but we will use it went to clownvamp for 150 tezos. So clownvamp, that's a pretty cool because clownvamp buys a lot of AI, but. So that's cool. So clownvamp is on board with this one of one. And again, 150 tezos. Nice sale in a tough market from Sabato. Again, playing with a kind of user interface subject matter.
00:49:14.174 - 00:49:42.474, Speaker A: So a new drawing exercise from Sabato. And Sabato is one of these guys or one of these people that can play with these different series and has done enough of them that there's a credibility. So when Sabato jumps from series to series, there's a continuity. And so you don't think twice. You go, oh, it's a Sabbato drawing exercise. So beautiful work here and kind of hilarious. So Sabato's rabbit, I think Rosalind, select your snack.
00:49:42.474 - 00:50:13.652, Speaker A: So just kind of a homage to Sabato's pet here. Really nicely done here, too. And again, making it look easy. See this flat blue, you know, because if you put a gradient back here, it probably gets too busy and it probably wrecks it. So it creates a contrast by just making it a flat blue here. And then you add these gradients here and everything, you start getting different contrasts. This is moving, this is flat static, you know, so different contrasts at work here which help make that succeed.
00:50:13.652 - 00:50:35.378, Speaker A: Still only 21 tezos on secondary. How much did it sell for on primary? Nine? Tezos only on primary. Really beautiful work. Great color, as usual, from Sabato. Another work here. Another different series, Ross skies. I got some data bins in this series, but I'm reticent to mint them on Solana because that series is so neglected and undervalued there.
00:50:35.378 - 00:50:56.184, Speaker A: I wish Tezos wasn't $0.70. Yeah, I think I picked one up of these because they were really, really cheap. And so here's another. Just beautiful. What do they call it? Raw skies from Sabato that he's just sitting on. Kind of cool, you know, almost double sunset here, or sunrise. Here's another one.
00:50:56.184 - 00:51:33.690, Speaker A: And so just beautiful work here. Beautiful glitch art from Sabato. This was super interesting. So figments, also known as kappen, collaborated with Chris Warr, who made the audio for this. And it was very fitting. There we go. I mean, it's perfect.
00:51:33.690 - 00:52:01.604, Speaker A: It's kind of a perfect match, isn't it? So I thought the music matched perfectly. And I love the title. The theory of human consciousness. The theory of human consciousness. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. And here you see this kind of soul obliterated and this kind of almost like quantum physics and galaxies. Incredibly interesting work here from figments, also known as kappen.
00:52:01.604 - 00:52:27.964, Speaker A: And here's another one from figments. Very cool title here, too, mixing the pixel work in with the figments series. So interesting combination. And so this is edition of 20, and it's going for 555. So there may be utility here. I'm not sure, but I know figments was talking about using, making the pixels have utility. So maybe there's something going on there.
00:52:27.964 - 00:53:22.306, Speaker A: I thought this was incredibly interesting, too, and I'm trying to go fast here, but Michael Macasso, who was in the space that we were discussing earlier, you know what I loved about this, and you've probably noticed it here, too, this horizontal lines, it's almost breaking away. It seems to be a development here, and playing with these different kinds of. Kind of reminiscent of these retro screens, but it's kind of like a different play on the pixel art because it's playing with, again, these kind of horizontal screen lines. And to me, this felt like kind of breaking away a little bit from these, you know, for lack of a better term, dithered gradients, you know, or from dithering. And you see it's the light, right? The light comes in, and then it creates this kind of. Then you put in the horizontal lines to create that light. So just very, very, very interesting.
00:53:22.306 - 00:53:36.968, Speaker A: And another thing that evokes the old screens. Can you guess the green? It looks like an old Apple II e computer screen. You know, that old Apple II green. Hear me. Walk with me. Adam. Good morning.
00:53:36.968 - 00:53:55.912, Speaker A: So just very, very cool work. Here's another work. Black and white building until five years ago, is all monochromatic. That is translated from, I think, Japanese. And this is komiya ma with some just really interesting pixel artwork. Let me remove that translate. So you see kind of a UFO here.
00:53:55.912 - 00:54:18.244, Speaker A: And just super interesting black and white work. I mean, these are probably tiny files, by the way, you know, the sort of stuff that can be minted in a lot of different, like, you know, places with limited capacity. So just again, we see these horizontal lines here. Interesting. Mixed with kind of a. More of a. I guess I call this more of a four on the floor, but not exactly dithered.
00:54:18.244 - 00:54:43.980, Speaker A: Different kind of style here, though, isn't it? Like, look at that cloud. And this person skateboarding. I mean, totally mysterious works. And here's like, almost, you know, what looks like a 19th century japanese woodcut figure on a boat. Right? Fascinating. Mysterious, beautiful experimental pixel art here from element ly. We have a few double dragon here.
00:54:43.980 - 00:55:01.234, Speaker A: Nice. Just like two color work. Again, probably tiny files. And I guess these are the dragons here, but they look like steps. Totally mysterious and cool. I love this, too. It kind of looks like a book and some abstractions in it, you know? And here's, like, house.
00:55:01.234 - 00:55:15.454, Speaker A: Here is some writing, almost like a manuscript. All sorts of interesting stuff here. See if there's a clue. Space and property rights, you know, like, almost like documentation. Fascinating. Here's another one. Village.
00:55:15.454 - 00:55:40.218, Speaker A: And so almost looks like a, you know, a ski village where these almost look like those things you can take to the top to ski back down. Not sure. Some nice dithering here. Just beautiful work as usual. And this one's moving dragon. So another dragon from element li. And so just kind of randomly look, you know, seemingly random iconography.
00:55:40.218 - 00:55:53.490, Speaker A: Here we have a rain cloud. Dragon. Sun, black sun. A column, you know, almost like charging the bluetooth. Right. Fascinating. One more here.
00:55:53.490 - 00:56:09.814, Speaker A: And this kind of has a bit of a. Says a bit more color and kind of has a feel of a video game here. Retro is the digestion of the past. So golf is the title here. 256 by 256 pixels. Super interesting. And here seems to be the figure who's going to golf and is aiming maybe for here.
00:56:09.814 - 00:56:28.660, Speaker A: So very cool green ginger. I am winning. So playing off of that solitaire, you know, when you win in solitaire when you finish the game. But interestingly, they're all the king's cards here. And then the queen comes through and the jack. So just kind of an interesting piece. And the jack comes at the end.
00:56:28.660 - 00:56:49.828, Speaker A: This piece is inspired by a winning animation of a classic solitaire game. Exactly. So very cool work from green Ginger and another beautiful one from Chaz doing this kind of retro tech. And here is a Game Boy. Yeah, this is a certain kind of game Boy. One of the later ones. And this is selling for 949 on secondary.
00:56:49.828 - 00:57:08.104, Speaker A: Let's just check out. Sold only for two tezos on primary here. Just another beautiful pixel artwork with a game inside of it. And even you see the button moving. So just cool work as usual. This was interesting. So Vanarman on super rare.
00:57:08.104 - 00:57:31.966, Speaker A: You know what's interesting? Like, there is pixel art on super rare, but you really don't see a ton of it. Now, what's interesting about these works, byte gangs are one of ones 100% on chain unique. So these are 100% on chain on ethereum. So that is interesting. So there's no image to connect to. It is the token, is the work. And there is something to be said for that.
00:57:31.966 - 00:57:54.464, Speaker A: And I tell you, like, the market has an appreciation for that. Eleven ETH. So $18,000 for this work. So if you can make work on chain, that is appreciated by the market here. So let's just see what happened here. Quite a few bids. And this went all the way up from 0.9
00:57:54.464 - 00:58:14.194, Speaker A: to eleven. So that is quite something. Xeno Skullgang, almost kind of blurry, surprisingly here. Not sure what that's about. I mean, not exactly blurry, but not super crisp. Like, say this is. Here is some beautiful work by great colors.
00:58:14.194 - 00:58:33.182, Speaker A: And love this kind of pixelation in the sky to create just a slight color change here. Lanvix, I assume, from 2009, probably older work. Three tezos. Brilliant. Here's another one, five tezos. And is that on secondary? So Lanvix, two. So a nice little series here.
00:58:33.182 - 00:58:55.164, Speaker A: These look like branches looking up at this beautiful sun that is changing shape here. And just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. So this is Loac me, kind of an ad that was put out by verseworks. I thought this was a beautiful ad for art. And let me show you the works themselves. 15,000 views. That's pretty good.
00:58:55.164 - 00:59:19.664, Speaker A: So then if you go to versus website, you see actually quite a beautiful page here. They did a really nice job. And if you click on these, I believe you get the works. Here's number 72. So beautifully dithered, kind of black and white pixel artwork. I wonder how big this is. Like, that's kind of one of the questions I would start to have here, just in terms of what is the size.
00:59:19.664 - 00:59:35.834, Speaker A: I don't see here in terms of the kilobytes or byte size. But anyway, interesting, beautiful series here out on verse. And here's just one more number. Twelve. So quite a few. I assume it's generative art. Just kind of a cool series here.
00:59:35.834 - 00:59:57.914, Speaker A: Running along here. Datura edition of 639 tezos on secondary. So that is impressive. Nice price there. And selling out for two tezos on primary. So actually this came all the way from December. I might have had this bookmarked, perhaps, because this is actually from way back, December 21, 2022.
00:59:57.914 - 01:00:11.480, Speaker A: So interesting. Automatic memory, panorama, moon, height, rise, Aurora. Now I got a notification on that. So interesting. So, Murakat. Nft. Just kind of another interesting pixel artwork here.
01:00:11.480 - 01:00:28.484, Speaker A: Just experimental. Kind of leaving stuff out in this butterfly here. Just interesting. Not sure if it's been minted anywhere. Notan Mariana. Stillness. So this looks like it's using kidpix, I believe, based on this rose here.
01:00:28.484 - 01:00:48.876, Speaker A: General feel of the work. And so just another interesting experimental work. Digital collage from Notan Mariana. And there are three left at five tezos. A lot of people will be familiar with this artist. Elna Frederick, social media. And so social media plaque is the description.
01:00:48.876 - 01:01:22.364, Speaker A: And here you see the evolution of humanity as they are crouched over their computer here with this beautiful kind of rainbow here. Very cool. And spiegelsmaskinen, jump in. So kind of a trippy work here from Spiegels, as we can see. Almost a portal into another dimension from the laptop here. So just kind of a cool kind of optical illusion of sorts here. This tablet turned into a laptop with what looks like an ancient mouse.
01:01:22.364 - 01:01:41.438, Speaker A: 90 tezos on secondary. And let's just see what happened here. 25 tezos on primary. And it looks like it sold pretty quickly, in a few hours. So a nice haul there for Spiegels Maskinen, pixel dealer, digital block, actually. This is from June. I'm not sure we saw this, though.
01:01:41.438 - 01:01:57.496, Speaker A: So this is three tezos on. I'm not sure if that's primary or secondary. Just an interesting animated abstract work. There are 20 left on sec on primary from pixel dealer. And this was awesome. I'm sure a lot of you saw this. This kind of stood out.
01:01:57.496 - 01:02:26.804, Speaker A: This is from eight, so. And doing a work with Dos Punk's Dao on Nifty Gateway. So I assume this is all sold at this point. July 2023 featured artists future turntable so this was released shortly after I left for Rhodes, but I thought just a really cool turntable work. Old turntable, great subject matter as usual. Doctor version with a couple of cool landscapes here. Again, taking these, making these outlines and using them to.
01:02:26.804 - 01:02:51.790, Speaker A: As opportunities to put different patterning in. Excuse me. And again, playing with orange and green also now green, what are the. Maybe orange and green are the complementary colors. So red is it blue, that's the complementary. I should really know that. And then purple and yellow, that is.
01:02:51.790 - 01:03:26.934, Speaker A: So we'll go back to our complementaries here soon. So, landscape number 14. Another beautifully textured work here from Doctor Virgin. So a couple of new ones here from the Roberto Mata inspired artist here in these beautiful kind of textures here in these interesting kind of kiriko esque landscapes. I thought this was super interesting as we wrap up here with Santiago old mid journey. And look at how kind of beautifully textured this old mid journey work is. I found that quite interesting.
01:03:26.934 - 01:03:53.900, Speaker A: And you can tell its AI from the writing here. Kind of beautiful painterly work here. So I found that interesting. Even the edges here, I find that just super interesting. Another mid journey work. This is a new one by Mikey de la creme or Mikey Wilson, bank robber blues. And so just another beautifully kind of painterly guitar work here from Mikey de la creme.
01:03:53.900 - 01:04:09.814, Speaker A: And this looks like it's sold out on primary at ten tezos each. And a couple from Tuks here. A couple experiments from tukes. The dreamer is still asleep. An AI artwork here. Very interesting work as usual. Look at this.
01:04:09.814 - 01:04:40.798, Speaker A: And here is another one by Tuks going to sleep numb with odd thoughts. So just interesting work here. This one a bit more cybernetic. And another one from Tim Lahan, whose work we have been enjoying over here. This is physical, okay? You can see the blue paper here. Kind of painted seemingly right to the edge, but then this kind of pixelation here. And again, the contrast of the hard edge with kind of like the soft pigeons here, or birds together.
01:04:40.798 - 01:05:03.816, Speaker A: Strange composition, isn't it? And a couple by die with the most likes feed all influencers become one too. So just a really cool painting here. Getting really good at the paintings. Here's another one that I thought was quite brilliant. These look like selfie sticks. And some creative writing here. Great work from die with the most likes.
01:05:03.816 - 01:05:29.650, Speaker A: And finally, Matej Macha Tsek, who is showing, I'm not sure exactly where, but this is ink, acrylic and paper on canvas. So interesting work here. I found on Instagram. And of course, I've shown nuggetbrain many times. Huge fan, the Hollywood sign. Just an awesome, awesome painter here. Easy to love.
01:05:29.650 - 01:05:54.474, Speaker A: And they're with bricks gallery here. Here's another one by nuggetbrain, who's also known as Luca Bjornston. Works on canvas and paper. At their opening here, there's a close up. Just beautifully, kind of very simple, isn't it? But just brilliantly, beautifully done. Here's another artist lens. Geirk, born 1988, based in Dusseldorf, Germany.
01:05:54.474 - 01:06:32.790, Speaker A: Born in Switzerland, you know, eating pasta. Just another really interesting kind of almost somewhat looking like they're somewhat influenced by german expressionism a little bit. Just interesting artist here. Very kind of modernist looking, isn't it? And finally, maybe you can guess the artist's walk with a warplane jet. Almost looks like a, you know, a stealth fighter or something. So very cool drawing here from walk. I love the war theme because it's so topical and relevant.
01:06:32.790 - 01:06:53.608, Speaker A: It's interesting subject matter. And I thought this was kind of fun and cool. Very good, very bad. Acrylic flash fabric and printed media on canvas. This is from Michael Pebus. If I'm pronouncing that right, I thought just a cool work, making it look easy and just very cool. And that is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me.
01:06:53.608 - 01:07:00.384, Speaker A: And I'm going to try and make these a lot shorter, but the first one back had to be a little longer to catch us up. Until next time, take care.
