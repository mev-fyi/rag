00:00:07.080 - 00:00:34.340, Speaker A: Okay, we got to be fast because the computer is overheating and we haven't even started yet. Here I was starting. I was joking with myself. Is it the art that is making this computer? I just go nuts as far as the heat is concerned. Welcome back, everyone. Artist Journal Friday, October 27, 2023. Broadcasting from inner space, which looks like real life right now in Taormina, Sicily.
00:00:34.340 - 00:01:32.856, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back and thank you once again for the overwhelming reaction. I mean, people are like, you know, sometimes my friends ask me, is the, is the show taking away from your time to make art? And I go, well, not really. It's more actually dealing with the social media after. And it's a blessing. It is an absolute blessing, having spent 98% of my life, you know, in obscurity, to actually have people care and write to you and comment and retweet and everything. As Yoain said yesterday, it can make, it means the world to a lot of us out here. It's a thank, you know, it can be a thankless profession being an artist, you know, especially when you're obscure, right? So all to say this computer is literally.
00:01:32.856 - 00:01:59.696, Speaker A: Let me just check here. Not too bad. It is not too bad. So we've been dancing around with Mech's work here for a while. It seemed like just a matter of time before it got the front page treatment on the newspaper of the imagination here. So here it is at last, the teasing is over. And what's interesting, we actually saw, I think, this structure, but in another work, and we'll see it in actually a few tabs here.
00:01:59.696 - 00:02:27.274, Speaker A: But now there's a figure, the princess. And at first I was like, you know, there's a princess up here, too. I assume that's a princess. And at the top, and it kind of looks like someone that needs to be rescued, but hard to say, but almost giving this game a mission, perhaps. And these wonderful kind of columns here I was in. You know, I went to the ancient greek theater here and roman. It's kind of hilarious, actually.
00:02:27.274 - 00:03:04.438, Speaker A: The Greeks built the theater here in Taormina, and I highly recommend you visit. Go in October. It's crowded now. In August and July, apparently it's insane and the weather is too hot, so go in like April or October. So it is a good time to be here. But it's kind of hilarious. Just in passing here at the theater, the Greeks had it for drama, and then the Romans started with drama when they took it over, but then they turned it into an arena with the gladiators so just, you know, we're kind of back to that war.
00:03:04.438 - 00:03:49.428, Speaker A: It just kind of reminded me of that war theme. And again, it is just, you just want to say, as Freud was saying, in civilization and its discontents, it is almost biological, you know, organic matter coming apart and coming together and coming apart. Eros and thanatos. Anyways, we are off topic here, but not entirely, as I see these columns here is reminding me of the corinthian columns at, in. Look at the sky here in the theater there. So interesting horizontal lines here. I mean, I've said a lot about these already, and it kind of looks like c here, but not entirely clear, you know, and then here it's ambiguous.
00:03:49.428 - 00:04:25.254, Speaker A: I would argue this is c if I had to, you know, if we're at St. Peter's gate here and you had to say, how do you see this? I would argue this is c up until here and then up here. This looks like sky, although it's a similar pattern, maybe inverted, actually, the dot kind of pattern at the very top here. This is the fun of the limitations, really, of this kind of stamp making process here. That is another way you could actually make this work. I've discussed screen printing, and we're going to see a really cool screen print today of a digital work. It is happening.
00:04:25.254 - 00:04:57.132, Speaker A: I was just looking at all the soldiers here, too. Screen printing would work, but in theory, if you were to make your own stamps, which actually would be quite a laborious and probably expensive process, theoretically, you could do it that way, too. In a sense. That's what we have here, are kind of stamps of sorts. Look at the soldiers. And I brought up, actually some Vittori carpaccio, if I'm pronouncing the first name right. I brought up some carpaccio today because that's actually, for those of you that know your carpaccio and for those that don't, we're going to take a look in a second.
00:04:57.132 - 00:05:45.044, Speaker A: There is something about this. I think it's the small figures, the large landscape, and kind of this almost classical architecture that reminded me of those massive works that I saw way back in 2004 at the Accademia in Venice, which I highly recommend. The images online don't do it justice, but it kind of reminded me of a carpaccio in its own way, this massive drama with, like, you know, 200 figures in it. And here you almost see what looks like two different armies facing off against each other. And here you see, you know, hard to say, but we'll just call it the princess figure. Interesting kind of blood, blood red. And this negative space here.
00:05:45.044 - 00:05:57.434, Speaker A: Just gorgeous. So beautiful work by mech TxT. There's a quote here. Thus the country is abandoned to itself. May my father know it. The enemy inflicted much damage upon us. Now, I think there is a.
00:05:57.434 - 00:06:28.270, Speaker A: We have the title here. This isn't the title. Amurapi's letters were covered. Amurapi's letter was covered in blood. And interesting videos here kind of reminds me, actually, like, this is just like a work in progress video, but just from an aesthetic perspective, it kind of reminded me a little bit. That's a cool kind of troll like figuring you almost see a shield on these guys. Kind of reminded me of Ed Morolla's the artist is dreaming this kind of like I find this, this isn't, you know, the work itself.
00:06:28.270 - 00:07:05.678, Speaker A: This is just kind of showcasing the work as far as I understand Mech's doing here. But it does make you think as you see it kind of scroll from left to right here. You could theoretically pull an Ed Marolla on this work as well, which I just find kind of interesting in itself. And here's just another work in progress shot. And you do pick up little details that you might not notice when you see these shots here. As you see, you got to love the stone. There's something about this kind of MS DOS style rpg style that really goes well with classicism.
00:07:05.678 - 00:07:24.862, Speaker A: Look at that big, blood red negative space. The work's in progress. Fascinating. And this is the work we saw. I think we saw this yesterday, if I'm not mistaken. You'll notice there's no princess here. So maybe reusing elements, maybe extending the canvas, maybe just a completely different composition, but maybe reusing the building.
00:07:24.862 - 00:07:59.378, Speaker A: Remember, we were talking about dragging layers across compositions. Like, I think this is, you know, it's accepting the logic of digital art is where I'm going with that. And did we see this one? I don't think so. So again, and this floor, this almost tiling. So the work in progress shots are interesting too, because you also see different kind of variations on the piece, right? Different outcomes that were possible. And even the like, light red and the dark red. All to say, it's all extremely beautiful.
00:07:59.378 - 00:08:13.986, Speaker A: Here's Vettori carpaccio. I think I got the first name right. We'll just call it carpaccio. This awesome artist. This is a crop. But you kind of see where I'm going with this. You see the big landscape, and then there's a whole bunch of tiny people here, and we're going to see different crops.
00:08:13.986 - 00:08:36.894, Speaker A: This is a crop of a painting. But you see the landscape, the little trees, and then kind of like this big. I guess this would be like a medieval castle, but almost kind of has this, you know, pseudo classical look, shall we say. Here's a bigger version. This is actually the same work. And actually, you see the sea here. And again, the Internet does not do carpaccio justice at all.
00:08:36.894 - 00:09:02.087, Speaker A: You know, I was looking for just, I put in massive carpaccio, and I didn't really get what I was looking for. But you see how there's, like, what look like hundreds of figures. And again, you see landscape, trees, classical. Well, medieval architect, we'll just call it architectural. You know, kind of castle structures. And there are some carpaccios. This is a close up as well.
00:09:02.087 - 00:09:32.660, Speaker A: Again, if you just kind of, like, zoom out and look, it's kind of got a mech TXT composition to it, which is kind of what I wanted to just compare it to in a very kind of. Why not? In a very gratuitous way here. Here's another carpet show as well. And again, you kind of see a similar thing going on, don't you? And I just thought that was kind of fun and interesting. And this was also kind of fun and interesting, maybe a little gratuitous. But I thought, let's. Because this was the next thought in my head, is Carpaccio.
00:09:32.660 - 00:10:14.218, Speaker A: Well, of course, Max Ernst loved Carpaccio. And this is a beautiful two page spread from Max Ernst beyond painting, which you can get on archive.org dot. You can just set up an account, log in with Google, and you can take this out for, like, an hour at a time, interestingly. And on the right, you see Max Ernst's favorite painters and Max Ernst's favorite writers. And I brought this up maybe 200 episodes ago. This is a very important document, I would argue, in terms of understanding surrealism and how surrealism understood the tradition and what it was kind of gathering from the tradition.
00:10:14.218 - 00:10:33.618, Speaker A: And I thought. And so here's carpaccio. Okay. And it's quite interesting. The other people that you see here that were Max. Max Ernst made this work here, by the way. And you see Bruegel, Bellini, Hieronymus Bosch, Grunewald, a german painter.
00:10:33.618 - 00:10:43.450, Speaker A: I don't know. Altdorfer. I'll have to look that up. Piero della Francesca. Right? Lucas Cranac. I can't read that here. Toura, I'm not sure.
00:10:43.450 - 00:10:55.184, Speaker A: Crivelli, I think, was a Renaissance painter, of course, Leonardo da Vinci de Chirico Henri Rousseau. Cosa, not sure. Cosimo. Interesting. And M. Deutsch and van Gogh. Right.
00:10:55.184 - 00:12:18.564, Speaker A: And here we see Jaqi in the writers Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, Whitman, Crabbe, Lotre, amend, of course, and Rimbaud and Goethe, Shakespeare. Carol, you know, just on this whole topic, as I make several associations here, as we pursue, you know, destinations unknown here. Goethe was actually in Taormina here doing the grand tour, and actually was at that ancient greek theatre. So it's actually worth a visit, by the way, was part of the grand tour that a lot of 18th century, you know, artists and writers would do. Intellectuals as part of their education, you know, their classics education, Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, Samuel Taylor, Coleridge, you know, Novalis, who, I know the name, but I've never read Hayne and Solomon, never read William Blake and Browning, I think is a poet polynare. So I'll just say, just an interesting document that, you know, is worth kind of, you know, and I just wanted to, you know, isn't it interesting how carpaccio is there in Ernst's influences? And as I kind of pursue this irrational, this. This logic of this, this thread here, this was also kind of a quality just to do a little detour into surrealist, you know, surrealism.
00:12:18.564 - 00:13:03.792, Speaker A: Alfred Jari was a proto surrealist. And one of the things he liked to do, or that it's kind of like a surrealist thing a little bit, was making these lists of your favorites. So we saw that with Ernst there. And here, this is Doctor Fostrel, which I think is from 1904, if I had to hazard a guess. And here we see the main character, Doctor Fostrel, pataphysician by Alfred Jarry. This book here and what you see here, you see that Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe translations, you're starting to connect the dots here. It's kind of little sojourn into surrealism, courtesy of mech TxT and Carpaccio today, Bergerac, the gospel according to St.
00:13:03.792 - 00:13:37.268, Speaker A: Luke in Greek, Coleridge. Start to see kind of, you know, repetitions here of, you know, grabbe, I think was listed. The lays are the songs of Milduror, Malarme, the Odyssey by Homer, Rabelais, Rimbaud, ubuhua. So he puts himself in there. I've never noticed that before. Jules Verne and, you know, so verlaine, of course. So just very interesting and kind of a difficult book to read, but a classic.
00:13:37.268 - 00:14:08.642, Speaker A: Exploits and opinions of Doctor Fostrell, pataphysician. So there's our interesting intro here today. Mikey Wilson, a big shout out. You know, it got me thinking as far as portraiture, it kind of achieved what you're going for with portraiture. Make them a little better looking, a little better dressed, a little nicer sunglasses, and the hair is just a little bit tighter. This is kind of what you want out of a portrait, I was thinking. And so let me make that large here.
00:14:08.642 - 00:14:27.634, Speaker A: So a gorgeous. Thank you. A gorgeous painting here by Mikey Wilson. Thank you. You know, I was like, maybe I should actually shave like that. Maybe I should actually dress like that. I wrote in a comment, you know, I want to go shopping with Mikey because he seems to know what to do.
00:14:27.634 - 00:14:53.330, Speaker A: He seems to know what to do. Captain Pokebelly, this is a heartfelt tribute to the captain of the pirate ship of the high seas, the imagination, Adrian Pokebelly. So, you know, if this was the last day I was alive, this is what I'd be doing right now, Mikey. So thank you, and it means a lot. And thank you for sending me one. And much appreciated. Yeah, it's beautiful, by the way.
00:14:53.330 - 00:15:19.488, Speaker A: And thank you also to Chepkes, who picked up a couple of works here, TB 303, part of the pixel art sketchbook, and Sybil, one of the AI artworks. And I need to post a few more. I might do them as one of ones and just make them cheap. We shall see editions of 15. Yeah, so thank you, Chepkes, for picking this up. This is Sybil. A few more in that series.
00:15:19.488 - 00:15:35.300, Speaker A: We'll see what I do with it. Comments from yesterday, and again, thank you for all the comments here. I love the new format. The image looks interesting. Hug. So from leprochant. So the format here, if you mean like the background here, as you can see, the, you know.
00:15:35.300 - 00:16:01.112, Speaker A: You know what's kind of crazy? If I can get the. I guess you can't really see it, but on the right of the, like over the shoulder here, you can actually see Calabria, which is the toe of the boot. So all of a sudden, everything, I look at the map and I go, that's Italy. I'm in Sicily now. Of course, that's part of Italy. But you can actually see right there, I think actually that's. No, that's Sicily.
00:16:01.112 - 00:16:25.164, Speaker A: But if you keep going to the right or the other direction there, you see Calabria and it kind of puts things in perspective. Anyways, very temporary. The new format here and next show will be a new place. But I think there's a good view there, too. It's kind of the first thing I look for on Airbnb. Santiago is a codal who will be on next Wednesday's spaces. There's been a lot of confusion about what curation is and what is the role of a curator.
00:16:25.164 - 00:17:18.936, Speaker A: Many think it has to do with promotion and art discovery market wise, but it's actually a job that conveys deeper work and study. You know, this is actually a really interesting point. And this came up, this came up. This came up, actually in an earlier episode here, which is curation, the word, I think it means like the people who take care of, you know, so, you know, sometimes it's nice. Yeah, I think that's kind of what Santiago is getting at, is this is a whole kind of art and science, and a lot of people call themselves curators, and I understand it. I even say, hey, this is part of a curator, kind of a curation of sorts. And that's probably true, but I have a feeling the specialists of curating, they might listen to that and go, well, kind of, right? So, yeah, I agree.
00:17:18.936 - 00:18:07.734, Speaker A: It's a very interesting topic to address. And yes, you know, what we'll do when we have a little less heated computer and a little more time is we'll go to chat GPT and we'll start querying chatgpt here on what curatorship actually is and see if we get some clues, at least from chatGpt. Also, the void traders composition is a clear reference to the Star Fox game. So referring to figments there, also known as Kappn and Godot, is an open. The software that mech TXT was using is an open source game engine. Recently it got a lot of new users as a result of Unity's terrible decisions. All these companies are all trying to make more and more and more and more money, and they oftentimes in the process make terrible decisions.
00:18:07.734 - 00:18:34.216, Speaker A: I assume that's what happened here. Kind of almost like what blender is for 3d design, Godot tries to be for game development, so they're making it open source. Open source may really have its day. Like for compressing videos here, I use handbrake. It's open source and it looks like it's the best software and it's free. And, you know, it makes you wonder in the future, I could see open source having its day. I'm starting to watch.
00:18:34.216 - 00:18:58.238, Speaker A: But I'll leave my congratulations so as not to forget. Thank you, Celeri and Rada, always a delight to hear from you. So thank you everybody. And also just on Twitter here, I mean, this is actually at 15,000 now, I think. Thank you for the incredible support here. Kind of mind blowing, actually. Martin Joe G, I'm an amazing show as always.
00:18:58.238 - 00:19:24.158, Speaker A: Thank you. And authentic waffles, also known as Hasdrubal waffle, discussing the Nintendo 64. Thanks. Pokebelly. It is indeed N 64. In Japan. There was a suite of Nishimen Mario artist games, including paint and Polygon studio, which I have never heard of, 3d, but they were never released domestically, so it's all in japanese and I have to make many notes.
00:19:24.158 - 00:19:48.434, Speaker A: Also, happy to see Mo get featured. Mo is rad. Absolutely. And yeah, I was saying, you know, maybe Mo should have a little more time on the show, considering Mo has just been pumping out work for months here consistently. And that in itself is a kind of credibility, we might say, in at least in my universe. And so look at this. I was almost joking with Hasdrubal here.
00:19:48.434 - 00:20:14.856, Speaker A: It's almost like a prepared piano when you don't know what the things do, you know, referring to John Cage with the rubber bands and the erasers that create. And when you press the button or the key on the piano, you don't know what it's going to do. It's almost like that doing it in Japanese. Also. Stalomere this is great. I'm amazed how you interpret it as language of light. It really is referring to negotiation yesterday.
00:20:14.856 - 00:20:25.184, Speaker A: And the light itself will be even more important in my alien works in the future, so. Absolutely. That is so cool. Glad you liked the interpretation. Glyphpunks. Great show. Thank you.
00:20:25.184 - 00:20:38.166, Speaker A: Joaoine. You're awesome, my friend. Always thankful to you to take your time to do these videos and to feature my work's. Absolute pleasure. Joa off the charts interesting. Beautiful AI art. Pixellort thank you for the comment.
00:20:38.166 - 00:20:51.198, Speaker A: I was trying to catch the first one of Sabato for 777 Tez, but no luck. So we're going to look at that in a second here. Anyways, found all those amazing drops on object one. Thanks for spreading the word. And thank you. Negar. Thank you.
00:20:51.198 - 00:21:04.684, Speaker A: Clownvamp. Look. And actually, this is the. Look at that background too. Yes. So, and so I posted this. This is actually the theater I was discussing here.
00:21:04.684 - 00:21:33.594, Speaker A: And that's actually Mount Etna in the background, I think. Europe's biggest active volcano. I took the tour, which actually, I highly recommend if you go, I mean, pretty stunning, you know, and then there's, you can kind of stand right there and you can look through and you'll see the volcano. It's also. And this just kind of randomly got destroyed by an earthquake here. So just very interesting. And thank you everybody be I enjoy watching this show a lot.
00:21:33.594 - 00:22:22.854, Speaker A: The subject of curation and decentralization needs to be more broadly discussed. So noted. As we progress in the use of newly developed tools and away from just using them to solve old problems with old strategies. You know, this also came up, didn't it, that maybe, I mean, it was Skomra. And actually, I thought on Skomra actually also put out a comment there on YouTube. Maybe I need to reload this because I just saw it this morning. But to your point, B, this curation discussion needs to, let's just also just, this kind of adds also to the curation.
00:22:22.854 - 00:22:42.008, Speaker A: Okay, so we need to tackle the curation idea. Absolutely. And we were discussing that earlier with Santiago. Is it codal? I believe, you know, bring up chat GPT. Let's actually revisit that and discuss it. Also, Skomra had an interesting comment here this morning. Thanks for showing two of my works.
00:22:42.008 - 00:23:04.780, Speaker A: I think you mentioned it here. Having just a little bit of feedback can be really motivating. Did you see Cosmo's emerging artist thread, which included Eizo, which is awesome. I think this is great. Melaya, I'm not sure I remember me, Laia and other great artists. I have really given it much thought, but I'm curious if you have any thoughts on some of the bigger names starting to collect emerging artists. There are other things, there are others doing this too.
00:23:04.780 - 00:24:06.784, Speaker A: I think maybe it's just a sign of maturation of the space, but I think it points to different collecting dynamic than the one we saw during the bull. And I also think it's just a matter of time is setting in the ultimate judge. And I mean, what else is there to say on it? I think, and just good work. Put it this way, I think David Hickey, a renowned art historian out of Texas who has passed on in the last three or four years, I mentioned this like 150 episodes ago, I think had this great quote when I saw him at the LA Art fair in like 2012, and he gave a talk. Talking about Rauschenberg, undeniable is undenied. And this is why I think we can Eizo, who I know right away, there's something just about a great work will eventually be recognized. And in a sense, it doesn't matter how much is spent on a work.
00:24:06.784 - 00:24:40.514, Speaker A: You can spend a lot of money on work that doesn't stand the test of time, and you can spend two tazos on a work that will. So ultimately, this just kind of brings back this whole notion that time is the judge. And I think that's what's going on here. That's my interpretation is these names of, you know, at least eight, so has been around now for six months at least. And people, you know, it's not. What's beautiful about this scene is it's not too big. So you can actually, you know, all of a sudden be collected by Cosimo, you know, probably the most renowned collector in the space.
00:24:40.514 - 00:25:24.976, Speaker A: And that's still possible if you were to even start today. So if you're putting out, undeniable is undenied, as David Hickey says. Okay. And this was also, I would be remiss, not to mention Ripcash, thank you, pokebelly, for highlighting my power source, bitcoin ordinal inscriptions on yesterday's artist journal. I'm not going to say what time they're featured because I really think it's worth watching these journals from start to finish. So big shout out and thank you ripcash. As I said in the reply after the show, the word that came to me about these kind of very small works that are kind of, you know, just designed for minting, like we see also with Spiegels Maskinen, it's elegant.
00:25:24.976 - 00:25:53.996, Speaker A: It's just really elegant. That aesthetic quality from a low file size for minting, you know, directly on chain, say with ordinals or ETH, it's elegant. Like there's an elegance there to make something beautiful, but a small file size. So thank you Ripgash, for the shout out. Appreciate it. Rosatio thank you Pokebuilder, for highlighting my work. Yes, the beauty of digital art is I just simply hit command J on Photoshop in order to duplicate the layers.
00:25:53.996 - 00:26:22.516, Speaker A: Again, accepting the logic of digital art. Also in my work, I use the public domain images that I steal, quote unquote, combined with digital drawing and or digital elements that I create. So combining these copied layers with original drawing, the eyes that you pointed, I created them myself. I used to use eye pictures from old encyclopedias and such. That's cool. But I wasn't satisfied with how they turned out, so I created one myself. I hope this helps indeed.
00:26:22.516 - 00:27:04.364, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment, Rosaceo. It's always, again, awesome to hear from the artists. So this is a work that was sent to me and we can't read the whole thing. But interesting comment here from Louie on monetize your imagination today. So basically I don't you can find it in my collection or if you go to Louis feed here, Louie sent me one and I didn't want to put it this way. I could have just glossed over this, but I didn't want to feel like I was avoiding the topic either when I went to art school. Basically, you did it because you were compelled to, is what Louis is saying here.
00:27:04.364 - 00:27:30.518, Speaker A: You know, that ultimately, it was an endeavor of the soul, worth way more than money or anything material. Times have changed, though debatable. The world is driven by need and greed. Truth and integrity are drowned out by social, political, and corporate propaganda. Well, maybe that is somewhat true, but it's always been a mess out there. Self is no longer something to investigate. I'd say a little pessimistic here, though.
00:27:30.518 - 00:27:55.774, Speaker A: Art practice and exploration with some generous hedonism mixed in. Of course, self is something that gets misdirected and manipulated by the powers that be. Conformity is not just expected. It is required. Well, you know, I would argue at least this show, but there's no actually. I mean, other than the minting on zora, there is actually no financial outcome, at least not yet. Conformity is not.
00:27:55.774 - 00:28:18.446, Speaker A: But, yeah, okay, continuing on. Being an artist in these times especially, is harder than ever. Monetize your imagination, they tell us. Make your art for business. Follow trends, create to succeed. I mean, for me, this is actually. I mean, it sounds crass when it's said, monetize your imagination, but this is the dream that you can.
00:28:18.446 - 00:28:50.338, Speaker A: I mean, back to Terrence McKenna. He called it capitalism made of light. You know, and this is the dream. I mean, if we do need to have jobs, if we do need to, if we are in an economic world where we do have to make some money, I can't think of a more beautiful way to make money. I mean, I guess we could work at the cafe, but I'd much rather, you know, make money from my imagination. So I guess I'm not quite so pessimistic on that. In fact, I'm probably the opposite.
00:28:50.338 - 00:29:21.794, Speaker A: But I think it's interesting and all sides, I think, should be shared here. If you wish to take that route, that is fine. No judgment, but you'll be missing out on the most essential and rewarding part of being an artist. Artistic integrity. And so here, just finally, I think you can have both, in my opinion, like this whole idea that the artist needs to be poor. The starving artist is the only authentic kind of art. It's a romantic kind of capital r romantic kind of view, I would argue.
00:29:21.794 - 00:29:49.814, Speaker A: And it's. And, you know, the problem from just a general perspective, almost from a style perspective, is it's a little over sentimental, I dare say. You know, this idea that, you know, you have, you're not authentic if you're making money. But I agree with. But, you know, I'm kind of out of the Warhol school of business art. You know, like good art is business art. It's a great.
00:29:49.814 - 00:30:23.932, Speaker A: This being true of how desperate of a situation and that you're expected basically to be poor. It's all the more glorious to actually be able to like make a living like the person across the street from you, from your imagination. I mean, that's glorious in a sense. So all to say, but I appreciate the thought and thank you for the work. And, yeah, I mean, I don't think you're alone in thinking this either, which is why I share it. And back to the subject here as we run through. I can't believe 30 minutes here.
00:30:23.932 - 00:30:46.546, Speaker A: I'm going to go a little faster here. The great onion of capitalism looks on at the art week bustle. So that is what, that is hilariously, the great onion of capitalism. So just to riff off of the last tab there, speaking of which, Sabato's work is now at 930 tezos. Let me just. Hopefully I don't. Okay, here we go.
00:30:46.546 - 00:31:16.638, Speaker A: We'll get the latest 930 tezos. Mental noise at 100 tezos negotiations, that is at 333. Lex doom at 250. So these are all selling a narrator, 230, blue retina 150. This stuff's doing really well. I mean, 200 tezos only, though one could argue for a one of one popple hacking the trading booth and merchant of the soul 123. And also muji at 300 tezos.
00:31:16.638 - 00:31:37.636, Speaker A: And the others waiting for a bid. So kind of funny how the art week one and almost the capitalist critique is at the top of the charts there, financially speaking. Zooming through here. Let me just check the computer. It's hot. Runetune with some great reporting. And I follow runetoon.
00:31:37.636 - 00:32:03.694, Speaker A: That is a x bug, by the way, went to the opening. How cool is this? So these are the physical works of Lily Illo, whose work we recognize here. And look at this. Excellent documentation here. Getting really almost the scoop here from rune tune. And you know, again, just very interesting to see these works up close. Right.
00:32:03.694 - 00:32:28.714, Speaker A: So just fascinating, you know, originally painted by a robot. And we have some more, I think. Let me just actually back up one. Okay, let's go here and here. I guess this was at the opening. You can see the. Right.
00:32:28.714 - 00:32:53.534, Speaker A: So we were actually discussing this yesterday, how it's almost like the texture is done first and then afterwards it's almost colored. And I can understand that it's probably just the, that's the, I suspect this is the 1.0 of the technology. Very interesting. Also, Danielle King. And you see like a big robot that looks like the thing in the sabato painting. Maybe that was the reference.
00:32:53.534 - 00:33:15.598, Speaker A: And here we see more of these works here from the show. And you see the opening. So all very interesting and cool. And here's strange thing. I was incredibly curious to see how these would turn out. And here are some other ones, different kinds of texture. And I would love to see these up close.
00:33:15.598 - 00:34:22.828, Speaker A: This was the closest I could get here to the strange things. But, you know, even it's interesting how well done the square is. And again, it makes me wonder, like, is this almost like you do the texture first with a brush and then almost inkjet over top, you know, or some equivalent of a spray over top, because this is quite precise for a brush, isn't it? So in the spirit of healthy conversations here, Lorna Mill is showing skepticism to the robots. Robots are not so great painters. Interesting. So I think this is really interesting and I think it just should be a part of the conversation as I go on and on celebrating this kind of what I feel is kind of a new kind of mark making is what I'm calling it. But I think this is actually, you know, a sober, you know, it's, I think it's a good reminder that maybe as we see this new technology and the, the sparkle and the shine to remain skeptical and go, well, is this, how beautiful is this? And just to keep that in the back of our heads.
00:34:22.828 - 00:35:07.363, Speaker A: So always appreciated from the often provocative Lorna mills rip cash rust silkscreens. So going toward in a silkscreen making a physical here from rip cache. And I actually brought this up large and you see the gorgeous dithering here. So let me just see if I can. And there it is. It almost looks like it's maybe on aluminum or something, but you see how beautiful that is. And I was just thinking to myself here, you know, the digital art world or the scene that we're kind of a part of, I think it could actually, like, think of how many of these ripcache could make and then you could change the color and everything.
00:35:07.363 - 00:36:13.614, Speaker A: Like digital art, because you can do so many remixes and everything. And then once you translate that into physical art, like the volume of art that could be produced by the digital art world could overwhelm, not to make an unnecessary distinction between digital art and the contemporary art world, but you could actually probably, you know, the digital art scene could probably out volume, put out more work than the contemporary art world at a certain point physically, just by nature of, you know, so just kind of an interesting thought because quantity in, you know, as they say, quantity in like big enough sizes has a quality of its own. Finally, on the news front, before we get into the art, Zora embed earn ETH embed a Zora mint page onto your website or platform. Earn mint referral rewards. So look at this. So Zora with another innovation. First it was meant for the fee and then split the fee with the creator, and then it was meant for free.
00:36:13.614 - 00:37:12.080, Speaker A: And now they're doing embedded on your website, and then when you click the link that you embed, you get a cut. So they're really, I think what makes Zora so powerful, I think, is this idea they're sharing the most, it seems to me. And that's just, it's sort of, you know, it's kind of a Walmart model, shall we say, I dare say in the sense of it's kind of a logic of why pay more? The more you give the customer or the user, the more likely you are to actually succeed. So I just find very provocative and interesting from a business perspective into the art. A fantastic work by Martin Bruch. I could have started the show with this, we just did last week. So I was like, okay, we just started with Martin, but Agua, italian luxury sports car manufacturer, 900 by 701 of 1350 tezos.
00:37:12.080 - 00:37:52.174, Speaker A: I just think this is gorgeous. I'm so happy to have discovered Martin's work here. And again, a fusion of what looks like collage, maybe photography and video unifying the whole thing, almost the noise of video. Video noise unifying the image or the collage or whatever this gorgeous thing is with the super subtle colors by Martin Bruck. Beautiful work, 350 tezos. Another very interesting experimental artist here, Kazuhiro ihara. And let's see if there's, I don't think there's any volume here, but just another very interesting, I'd argue, provocative digital painting here.
00:37:52.174 - 00:38:26.158, Speaker A: And I believe Kazuhiro ihara is out of Tokyo, if I'm not mistaken. Oh, and here it's moving. There we go. So again, you could argue kind of similar to Martin Brook in the sense of maybe mixing video a little bit with painting, perhaps, you know, kind of an amalgam of the two, kind of a moving painting perhaps. Plus was gamma. If interested, I will mint it. And this looks super cool here with what almost looks like Apple iie kind of programming.
00:38:26.158 - 00:38:48.354, Speaker A: I remember this syntax error list and then 1020. This looks like basic. That's probably the only programming language I ever really kind of looked at. And I got lost by line 20 here when I was trying to learn at age six. But I love this and I love the old programming. Ready? And then you hit run. Very cool work here.
00:38:48.354 - 00:39:36.814, Speaker A: And here's another one by Amstrad patterns code tomorrow. Mint. So combining programming and code with image. So a fusion of text and image. And also, I mean it brings you to this kind of reality as information, as I think a lot of quantum physics people would say it kind of, you could argue there is almost a kind of a quantum physics side to this whole idea of programming matter, which I think people think you can do in 100 years or 200 years if they can't do it already, but at enormous energy. But this idea that this is the direction we seem to be going, which is programming matter. And I feel like this is like an.
00:39:36.814 - 00:40:08.584, Speaker A: Almost like the artists intimating or anticipating, almost like the prophetic, you know, where it's like it's not possible scientifically, let's say, yet, but artistically we can start to visualize what that means. So very cool work here. And that'll be minted by Francois Gammer tomorrow. New work by Renki I thought was pretty cool. Nice. Just combination. Just cool abstract here a nice piece from Renki.
00:40:08.584 - 00:40:23.608, Speaker A: Edition of ten. And are any listed yet? No. So that is on object Sean Luke with a cool kind of UFO aquatic assembly. I think they're UFO's. Let's see. Let's take a closer look. And I think this is on object here.
00:40:23.608 - 00:40:53.014, Speaker A: You can see almost, maybe it's the water in the background in the blue and pink, kind of almost neon that is the water as well as kind of like the reflection looking frame there. Cool work from Sean Luke. And here you probably recognize the artist go Golitis with a super cool work. Let me just get the title. What makes my heart beat. And this had a really nice write up. In a figurative sense, my heart beats for many things, both personal and universal.
00:40:53.014 - 00:41:23.034, Speaker A: But in a literal sense it is powered by something simple and essential, electricity. So very cool. And of course go go Litis is quite philosophical. If you check out the Twitter space I did, me and Runtun did with gogolitis, I think it was in February. He was mentioning how reality simulator device is really his kind of response to Plato's cave in a digital world. And that is well worth the listen. That is up on the Spotify.
00:41:23.034 - 00:41:51.918, Speaker A: It's also on the YouTube. Cool work. Hey, I mean, before we move on, the hearts here and almost a little bit of animation here going across. Interesting contrast here with this kind of animated hearts with the super geometric linear perpendicular circuitry. And then you have this kind of free flowing animated hearts here. Almost looks like a currency. The currency of love, courtesy of Gogolitis.
00:41:51.918 - 00:42:21.164, Speaker A: And. And here we have Tom Bombadil meteor shower. And that looks like the big statue in Brazil and Rio de Janeiro, if I'm not mistaken. You know, one of my favorite parts of this work is the gray clouds in the background. Not white, but gray, maybe even beige. And then also the composition here of this kind of looking outside from a cave. And this doesn't look like it looks like a reference.
00:42:21.164 - 00:42:41.064, Speaker A: Or maybe it's even a medieval figure. Not the Jesus that's in Rio. I think that's a Jesus in Rio. So it looks like a. But maybe a distant relative there, iconographically speaking. Gordon Zuckold, another pan with some nice volume here, too. I hesitate to move this mic, but I will.
00:42:41.064 - 00:43:13.064, Speaker A: There we go. So beautiful pixel art here. I think it's. Yeah, pixel art. Nice monochromatic for the most part, minimal color palette, let's put it that way. Cool music, almost classical. And the cat's sleeping.
00:43:13.064 - 00:43:41.062, Speaker A: Hilarious. Fun. Beautiful now, right? I mean, this is art that a lot of, you know, people under 15 would probably relate to, which is quite interesting. Continuing on, da Nyris. Remember Da Nyriss did that incredible work of. It kind of looked like doom. Well, here is a new work Da Nyriss has been posting, I think, a few works on Azora here.
00:43:41.062 - 00:43:53.510, Speaker A: Sharp tongues. And I actually brought it up bigger. This is going for 0.02 ETH, and let me just make sure. And let's see if we can get that. There we go. And so there it is.
00:43:53.510 - 00:44:15.764, Speaker A: And some skulls that are kind of stretched out, kind of orange and a blue flame, and then some interesting kind of blue, almost video. One bit pixelation of sorts there. So interesting piece. Kind of has a video game feel to it, doesn't it? Speaking of which, McRender's with some really nice, what looks like Donkey Kong. Don't pull the cartridge. Zero eight. I believe McGrender sent this to me.
00:44:15.764 - 00:44:30.424, Speaker A: I saw that actually, after I had already chosen this for the show, by the way. But either way, full transparency. Let's just see if yes, indeed was sent to. Oh, no, I bought it. I bought it. Okay, so there we go. I bought it after seeing it.
00:44:30.424 - 00:45:03.096, Speaker A: So there it is. So just, you know, it's quite a nice glitch is, I guess, where I'm going with this. It's quite a nice glitch, this part here. It's like a nice little mini film. And the numbers donkey kong, junior math. So almost kind of reminiscent, interestingly, accidentally perhaps, that Francois Gamma with the programming, you know, combining letters. I'm a big fan of that, actually.
00:45:03.096 - 00:45:32.474, Speaker A: Like in the peloponnesian war series that I did. I purposefully was trying to. You know, it was the war of all iconography against all iconography. And one of the things I was trying to do was to go from shapes to letters to shapes, where almost. Where it became about reading. Right, read. And are you reading this as an image or are you reading this as language and then trying to kind of mix them up? And so I'm always a big fan of this juxtaposition of language and image.
00:45:32.474 - 00:45:55.180, Speaker A: And that was a nice example. And here, Ukxine, with what seems like a kind of satirical work of the Euxine character playing super Mario here. And, you know, Euxine's humor. Again, I thought this was great and hilarious and just ever creative here, just put on Twitter. Just kind of hilarious. And here's another glitch. Rom Silva san twos.
00:45:55.180 - 00:46:11.420, Speaker A: This is a really cool one. Horse racing, too. So nice selection here. Selection is paramount. Just checking the heat on the computer here. This is gorgeous, isn't it? Very nice. Again, the racing games often work out particularly well.
00:46:11.420 - 00:46:27.564, Speaker A: Edition of 22 for two tezos 20. There are five left. Nice glitch. Of course. Pamelo Cerrone, an explainer gallery with a really nice piece here. One of the most prolific artists on the blockchain right now. And outside the blockchain.
00:46:27.564 - 00:46:56.552, Speaker A: Remember that gorgeous show we saw with almost those duchamp. Duchamp like bicycle wheels that had the cards on them, that played the gif. Brilliant. Pamela Cerrone and the music, I mean, and all of this and making music totally on fire, I believe, out of Argentina. Just an awesome artist. So, another cool work to add to the collection. This is pretty cool.
00:46:56.552 - 00:47:31.754, Speaker A: This was Rob from foundation. I saw post this in. You know, speaking of curators, this often puts out some of the highlights from foundation racing towards a new day. This is by Hachimi, who I feel like we may have seen before, but not for a long time. Again, the panning like, this panning idea, I think is really interesting. Simple idea, but pretty effective. That cool DVD.
00:47:31.754 - 00:47:52.330, Speaker A: Almost like the retro tech of the DVD. Gm. See that gm? Cool piece. Cool piece of. And has that sold just minted today. So fresh. Santiago with another beautiful work here.
00:47:52.330 - 00:48:21.870, Speaker A: This one a little bit more painterly. Trying to figure out which artist this kind of reminded me of. It's almost like a, I want to say, like early Paul clay or something in here. Kind of nice and painterly. Again, a work like this is crying out to be painted by art matter, isn't it? So just a really cool painting here by Santiago. Massive, 10,000 pixels. And this is an edition of 20 for five tazos.
00:48:21.870 - 00:48:48.482, Speaker A: Very cool. This Danielle King is doing the FX hash, I think just like temporarily here. Just kind of special guest. These works here I had never seen before, at least not for, for a while. Eyeshadow roses. I think these are beautiful, interesting kind of digital take on roses I thought were really worth highlighting here. And it looks like kind of a generative art, I just think quite brilliant.
00:48:48.482 - 00:49:01.054, Speaker A: And so nice selection from Danielle King there. A tez noun by rinnefish. Let me just see if there's volume. No volume here. Let me just see. There we go. Oh, yeah, there is.
00:49:01.054 - 00:49:27.686, Speaker A: My computer might be in slo mo. I may have to. So check that out at auction for only 30 tezos right now. My computer may be overheating here, so we may have to just run through the rest of this. I'm starting to sweat in this oven of a place here. Okay. Tmi bazaya.
00:49:27.686 - 00:49:45.106, Speaker A: Greetings from Nepal. Nepal. So another maybe anon figure. Look at these great tattoos. Makes you think that bzaya could be almost like a tattoo consultant. What kind of tattoo should I get? And you could talk to Bezaya here. Almost a nice portfolio for that.
00:49:45.106 - 00:50:12.058, Speaker A: Interesting background here. And again, greetings from Nepal. So interesting piece. And rustic. Don't forget to brush them. So playing again with this kind of. We're back to this programming code as image, right? I mean, it's interesting to see how this is recurring here and perhaps a reference here, clearly to Dali's may west, but turning the eyes into mouse, which I think Daly would appreciate.
00:50:12.058 - 00:50:34.296, Speaker A: So very cool here. And some interesting kind of a landscape here. Flora Marquez with a beautiful work here. Love. Kind of remember all those one of ones Flora did for like 30 tazos. There's probably some still available on the graph paper. Erasing all of that practice and then puts out what I'd call a sketchbook work here.
00:50:34.296 - 00:50:50.582, Speaker A: It's gorgeous, this gorgeous, gorgeous piece. Not sure if it was burned. Db zero zero one. There may be a newer version. Check her feed. Anaerobic second childhood. So Turkarak with the brutal satires of society here.
00:50:50.582 - 00:51:08.134, Speaker A: And here you have, you know, some elderly people going back to their youth and being in the band, you know, holding on to youth. So I think, you know, just brilliant. Turk rack work here. Anaerobics. I'm not sure what anaerobic is. I'm sure someone out there does. And there's the old guy.
00:51:08.134 - 00:51:41.410, Speaker A: So yeah, it's always kind of raw and brutal with turkrack, but that's what makes it great. Just like brutal satire. Tornado Rodriguez with a cool pastiche of I think maybe the tornado Rodriguez figure here playing Scrooge McDuck. So a cool kind of pastiche here from tornado Rodriguez just posted on x. Timothy Julien Oasis. Interesting reflection here. And is that a pool? One wonders? So continuing with this kind of architectural experimentation.
00:51:41.410 - 00:52:07.158, Speaker A: Cool title. Only 70 $0.49 if you can spare if you can spare a dime here's atelier 407 happy days. So I think atelier we were kind of showcasing or mentioning that there was a series atelier was putting out. I think she was saying how the bots got it and got them all. And now. So feeling better today.
00:52:07.158 - 00:52:33.354, Speaker A: So just show some atelier work. Here's a beautiful one by atelier 407 density number ten dex posted here. So just a really cool artist I think I discovered in Lewis Osborne's collection. Continuing on Badala. Let's just make that big. So I was never sure if these were AI. I don't think they are, even though they kind of look like AI, but I don't think they are just cool illustrations here.
00:52:33.354 - 00:52:53.034, Speaker A: So quite interesting edition of ten. I think this is sold out at ten tezos each. So nice sale here from Badala. And here's photographic and illustrator Badala. NFT. So we looked at Badala's work I think six months ago or so. So interesting to see the work back.
00:52:53.034 - 00:53:09.626, Speaker A: Look at the Kurt Hussle collective. Maybe this is why my computer's overheating. Cheeks ar leave your life for a better one. Augmented reality cheeks. So kind of cryptic here from the great Kurt hussle collective edition of 25 for three tazos each. Lorna mills with a happy face. Erstwhile.
00:53:09.626 - 00:53:35.430, Speaker A: The happy will be happiest. So having fun here too, with a nice big happy face on a flag. And so cool work. And again, Lorna Mills should be on the spaces in a couple of weeks. I think the November 15 I think it is. And if everything goes according to plan. And so we can discuss also the robot painting then doctor version with a new work here.
00:53:35.430 - 00:54:06.668, Speaker A: And I like how they're getting more complex here this kind of simple idea here of the rectangle structure here. And you can kind of see this almost going through a tunnel of sorts. But then inside, they're getting more complex is what I'm trying to say. So fuchsia oscillate by Doctor version. Let me just see. I was just losing my cursor there. One left at ten tezos, just minted Sky Goodman and Eizo.
00:54:06.668 - 00:54:29.134, Speaker A: So remember I was showing you the Eizo here. Hopefully this plays. My computer may be frying, so it's too bad, because this is a beautiful video. Here it is. So, remember the Polaroid I was showing yesterday by Eizo? I think it's based from a screenshot from this traveling through the mediums. Very cool collab here. A very, very cool portrait here.
00:54:29.134 - 00:54:52.334, Speaker A: Speaking of portraits, this was kind of funny. So there seemed to be a portrait contest here for Santiago, also known as Neemarkez. I don't know what the Neemark is, friend contest is, but here's my entry. So there is Santiago, courtesy of Skomra. Very cool. And here is another one, courtesy of Shilly Preston, who I do follow, by the way. That is a Twitter bug.
00:54:52.334 - 00:55:17.186, Speaker A: This is my entry to make a picture of Neymar on a boat with lots of money and at least one cat competition. I hope I win so bad. And here is one more, so all hilarious crimson flatline, who I assume I follow here, too. Not sure. Anyways, all hilarious AI artworks there of Santiago. We'll see who wins the contest. Look at these by Sky Goodman.
00:55:17.186 - 00:55:41.598, Speaker A: This series on improps, this is actually, I have to say, one of, I would say one of the most, what I'd consider exciting and successful. Look at how well this is doing from just a compositional. Kind of has this painterly feel. These sky Goodman works made with m props. So pretty interesting, I would argue. Interesting. Interesting again.
00:55:41.598 - 00:56:05.314, Speaker A: And you could. It's kind of back. You could use all this improv stuff, and then you could use this as a source for a painting. But at the end of the day, though, I mean, we were discussing this yesterday. The first thing you thought of when I first discovered AI is like, oh, I can use that as a source for a painting, but efficiency matters. And really, maybe it's better as a digital work over a painting, but hard to say. There's a lot of this.
00:56:05.314 - 00:56:27.670, Speaker A: There's a lot of subtleties and different arguments you can make for different reasons. Look at toques, the great tuques here. And frankly, this looks like, exactly like what's behind me here. This looks like almost a spitting image. And then Calabria would be right here. So isn't that interesting? The apartment is slightly different here. Look at how beautiful this is.
00:56:27.670 - 00:56:53.804, Speaker A: So another fantastic digital painting here. AI digital painting by Tuks. Amazing. And here again is Danielle King, an open edition. And this is referring, I believe, to, to the art matter robot technology. So maybe this was painted and this is part of artists as muse series. And here we have a lily illo.
00:56:53.804 - 00:57:12.314, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this one was painted or not. Pretty interesting. Kind of looks like it uses improps, doesn't it? Not sure, though. Tender art. So again, I think this may be related to the art matter robot. So hive mind. Cool title.
00:57:12.314 - 00:57:36.316, Speaker A: I was joking to myself. Maybe Lorna Mills would like this one. I thought this was an interesting just concept here. Right? So taking a digital thing and then rendering it. I believe this is probably an oil using the impasto paint. This looks like an oil painting. But if we can zoom out here, hopefully this video isn't too long.
00:57:36.316 - 00:57:58.752, Speaker A: You'll see that the canvas itself has been stretched out. There you go. So I thought, just kind of interesting. I'd never seen anything like that. Let's share it here. Again, I'm going to ask Lorna Mills if she saw that. She probably won't see it, but if she does, maybe I'll send it to her beforehand on the space and ask her what she thinks of that Mia Bergeron painting from less than a year ago that found a great home.
00:57:58.752 - 00:58:17.610, Speaker A: I think this is beautiful, this pool at night and gorgeously painted, brilliant color, great subject, very original. And even the palms over here. Beautiful. And look at this. Donnie O'Donnell making a scarf. And so again, I love business art. And to me, this screams, like, this is great.
00:58:17.610 - 00:58:32.352, Speaker A: You know, I want to see the imagination. I don't want to see another necessary Louis Vuitton as I walk down the streets here. I want to see, like, Donny O'Donnell scarves. That is exciting. And that is your show. My friends, thank you again for all the support. Thank you for joining me.
00:58:32.352 - 00:58:37.684, Speaker A: Hope you have a great weekend. Until next time. Monday in a new location. Take care.
