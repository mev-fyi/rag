00:00:04.200 - 00:00:21.590, Speaker A: We are back. We're all back. Welcome back to another new week of interesting art. And this one in particular caught my eye, as usual. And there is much to discuss here. So welcome back. Artist journal, April 17, 2023.
00:00:21.590 - 00:00:46.654, Speaker A: Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Continues here. So welcome back. And, yes, so you can recognize the artist. Anybody that's been watching this show for the last couple of weeks, at least, you'd know this is axine. But this is a collaboration with indio robot.
00:00:46.654 - 00:01:09.140, Speaker A: So let me just quickly show you here. So indiorobot and indior robot. Did I bring it up? Yes. Indiorobot has put out a whole bunch of collaborations, this renaissance robots. So I'm not exactly sure, I assume, and I don't know. But, you know, there seems to be some AI here. This is strictly by indiorobot.
00:01:09.140 - 00:02:20.546, Speaker A: That kind of looks like an AI piece. I assume that indiorobot is giving AI works to the artists, and then the artists kind of make it their own, right? So this is kind of one of the kind of promised lands, really, of where I of AI, and we've been discussing this for months, really, this idea that it can provide a reference to artists. So what I assume happened here, and this is pure speculation on my part, is this work here underneath, without the sort of axing treatment and painting and computer, like this church, I suspect, is AI. And as you can see in the top corner here, let's just open that big, I think. Did I? Yeah, there we go. As you can see in the top corner here, to me, that looks like AI, right? Like, it's not super clear, but I suspect it's kind of got an AI feel to it. And so it looks like a collaboration where Axeen has been given that church, let's say, and then is told to run with it, basically.
00:02:20.546 - 00:02:46.026, Speaker A: And then adds the euxine treatment, the tubes, the flashing things, the hilarious kind of dripping window. The dripping window of light or whatever it is. Maybe it's a cord, who knows? And the cords coming out of people's heads. The Yuxine treatment, interestingly, the dice here is also interesting. And then a little. I think you'd call that a homunculi. A little small guy there, and then facing almost like Det.
00:02:46.026 - 00:03:19.544, Speaker A: Remember that guy from the painting? Det. Facing the huge guy. And again, we see this. You know what this is called? I've been waiting to drop this for a long time. Significance, perspective. So when you have, I mean, it goes all the way back to. It's like, you know, the most basic of basic art historical ideas, and you can go back all the way to ancient Egypt, where the pharaoh is huge, the Narmer palette, we discussed the Narmer palette, where the pharaoh is huge, and then the regular guy on the street is tiny.
00:03:19.544 - 00:04:10.394, Speaker A: So therefore, significance perspective, the bigger you are, the more important you are. And here we see basically what could be interpreted as significance perspective here. So anyways, cool work, really just kind of nice treatment here. And I'll tell you what I also really liked about this before we move on. So first of all, it was the overall just idea, because this is a kind of grail in my mind of sorts. This idea that ultimately it's actually going to be a massive compositional tool and help in a similar way to chat. GPT if you just put in, like, if I put in a transcript of this show and say, make an article of the part where I'm talking about axin and whatever, you'll get something like a rough draft, but you cannot just publish that.
00:04:10.394 - 00:05:20.232, Speaker A: Unless maybe I really, you know, worked it over, you know, like the raw AI people do. But in a similar way. It's almost like that's what could be used for a lot of digital painters, is all of a sudden you just it's sort of like a rough draft of a composition, and then you can kind of run away with it, you know, similar idea. So anyways, that was just really interesting because I'm not sure I've seen axine work in an obvious way with AI. I'm sure there's probably been experimentation, but not in an obvious way, seemingly obvious here. And correct me if I'm wrong, anybody out there, if you know otherwise, I'll tell you what else I liked about this, though, was how it became a really a digital work in a sense, like not just a representational work with this kind of screen imagery of the arrow going down outside of the screen here, outside of this, like retro Mac. And you see it also with the happy face that is getting glitched out a very nice, because imagine if that wasn't there, it would be.
00:05:20.232 - 00:05:55.308, Speaker A: It would be really removing a layer of kind of excitement of a certain kind. So by breaking that border, that frame of the screen, and putting this kind of digital imagery outside the screen kind of adds a levity to it. It adds like a again, it just really adds to the piece. So anyways, cool work by axin and indiorobot. Now, I brought this up. I brought this up. So Patrick Jambo actually is a famous person in the Berlin art scene, basically, yeah.
00:05:55.308 - 00:06:34.372, Speaker A: And you can see why he's instantly recognizable here. He's a performance artist who I believe, I'm not sure if he studied under Namjoon Pak, if I'm pronouncing that right, or one of the people who was with Nam June Pak. So anyways, and that's going to come up, that's going to be important later in the show. But I did want to show this because he often has like these computers that hang from his torso. And here it is. And this just reminded me of Patrick Turbo, also known as Turbo Jambo. So anyways, hilarious performance artist.
00:06:34.372 - 00:07:05.470, Speaker A: And you will see him, this is him, just a heads up on the Berlin art scene. Like this is, you know, one night, these are like one night of what's going on in Berlin in the art scene. And so he is the guy to go. He's the go to as far as knowing what's going on. And if you go out in Berlin, you'll see him probably very soon because he goes pretty much out every night. So more axin. So this, I wasn't exactly sure what this meant, to be honest.
00:07:05.470 - 00:07:50.084, Speaker A: This was hand drawn, then Photoshop treated Gif. Okay. And this Gif here I used in might delete later, pokebelly made screens printed, then turned into GiF again. So I think that means, I'm not exactly sure what that means to be poke because obviously I didn't make them. But maybe he was thinking the ideas that we're discussing here, or maybe he was just giving me a shout out. This is welcome to my life where I'm very over literal on everything, much to my girlfriend's disdain, I guess. So anyways, Pokebelly made screens printed, then turned into Gif again.
00:07:50.084 - 00:08:43.736, Speaker A: So the moral of the story here is though is UK scene started with hand drawn, then Photoshop treated. So maybe that's how the skull got turned into the pixelation here and made screens then printed, I assume screen printed, then turned into Gif again. So anyways, it all looks great and everybody wants a copy. And so interestingly, what I think happened here is oxy made the drawing, then made these beautiful screen prints. I think this is what he's saying. He made these beautiful screen prints and then from these screen prints maybe took it back and turned it into a Gif. And maybe this Gif here was then brought into Photoshop and then digitalized and then we end up with that, perhaps.
00:08:43.736 - 00:09:12.816, Speaker A: So anyways, big shout out to oxine. Thank you for the shout out. And it always looks awesome. It always, it always, it continues to look awesome and it always does. So thank you for all the retweets over here and the likes. Really nice response here. And thank you to artspace 55 out of Korea and Jung hyun, who invited me to this NFT energy exhibition.
00:09:12.816 - 00:09:36.554, Speaker A: So anyways, an excuse to mint a work and to finish a work. And so I did. And this is Milky Way, based off of Tintoretto's origin of the Milky Way. Great title. Hey, by Tintoretto. I mean, what's so strange about that? Not to go on another tangent here, but if you look at. And people were asking me about art history lectures, and if you go to.
00:09:36.554 - 00:10:11.474, Speaker A: Let me, if you want to find good art history lectures, I highly recommend wondrium, which used to be the teaching company and then got turned into the great courses. You can even do a free trial here. They have excellent art history lectures. And what was I going to say about this? Losing my train of thought here. Yeah, so we had Milky Way. Anyways, go to Wondrium if you're looking for art history lectures. We are late in the day here, so we're just going to continue.
00:10:11.474 - 00:10:37.034, Speaker A: So big shout out to everybody who commented. Again, thank you for the nice comments, Libro and DJ Curo. Hilarious comment from Libro. Roontoon just commented, interestingly, on this idea of multiple accounts and what that might mean. I'm curious to know more about having multiple accounts, profiles, wallets. It's a phenomenon that only happens here. Traditional artists don't have the benefit of anonymity to do something like that.
00:10:37.034 - 00:11:10.026, Speaker A: And I have to say, um, this whole anonymity thing, to me personally, I never un, like, related to it, and I'm totally cool if everybody else, but I always thought, like, as an artist, you're trying to, uh, make your name famous in a sense. Like, that's not your main driving goal. But, I mean, ultimately, you don't want to be as an artist. You don't want to be forgotten. Okay. Like, to, you know? Right. So I always thought it was weird that people would use pseudonyms, but, I mean, there could be a billion reasons.
00:11:10.026 - 00:11:42.746, Speaker A: I mean, I grew up in Canada and I live in Germany. Maybe if you live in other countries, maybe it's politically more sensitive. Maybe people can have all sorts of reasons, could even have to do with just not, you know, maybe you don't want your neighbor to know that you have crypto, right? So there could be all sorts of very good reasons for doing it, but it's funny to be. Yeah. So anyways, so that brings up that, and we've discussed that before. But in this ecosystem, it's not a difficult thing to pull off to have multiple wallets. I multi chain and have two profiles on object.
00:11:42.746 - 00:12:18.266, Speaker A: Two profiles on object. And that gives me some room to play with different bodies of work. But all roads lead back to my twitter, where you can find it all. Okay, so basically there is a relationship and a way of tracing it. On the other hand, this kind of practice, especially when done covertly, can lead to some unsavory behavior. When I find out about the old accounts of other artists, both emerging and well established, it gives me some scammy hesitation thoughts. I think it really depends on a case by case, like say, like kappan, I don't think of at all.
00:12:18.266 - 00:13:03.576, Speaker A: I think it's kind of hilarious with the plants, right? He has plants and he's not too secretive about it. Like, he does leave breadcrumbs right, where it's like lysergic treated plants by Kappin Hayes. So a little bit of a clue there that, oh, is this kappan? Oh, it's the same style. I would find it more troubling or unsavory if someone, if all of a sudden I start making a secret account and then I start making axion style works and then, you know, that sort of thing, then it would be a little bit more troubling. So I think it's a case by case basis. It depends on the situation. Sometimes people can do it for fun, right out of kind of playing with the whole web3 kind of culture.
00:13:03.576 - 00:13:25.656, Speaker A: And this is part of the culture. So maybe it's also part of the art in a performative way. So I think the jury's out. It's case by case would be my current thoughts. But we can just keep thinking about that over time and keep returning to that as we come across those cases. This is pretty cool. I'm not exactly sure what it is.
00:13:25.656 - 00:13:43.192, Speaker A: Ed Marolla. This is surreal. So this kind of came out late last week. Metallica room of mirrors. And then you have an Eduard Eduardo Pulitzer or Edmarola created video. And there's a YouTube, actually. And I would show it, but copyright police might not love it on YouTube.
00:13:43.192 - 00:14:03.768, Speaker A: So anyways, you can find that and look at how great that looks. All of it. And even this with Ed on the computer. And then really charming here. So anyways, in a purple Metallica. So anyways, I don't know how official this is. Or like, I assume it's pretty official because it looks like a pretty big deal.
00:14:03.768 - 00:14:23.330, Speaker A: Metallica family. Metallica. So look at that. 6.2 million followers. So I think Dina Chang curated it. So anyways, just kind of interesting and cool people are getting out there and we're discussing this whole idea of educating your collectors and just anybody who's paying attention to you as an artist.
00:14:23.330 - 00:14:48.718, Speaker A: It's worth our while. Again, I say this to myself more than anybody else, it's worth our while to educate people on what you're doing. And here SAbaTo has done it on the echo the Dolphin cataclysm series. I guess this is on verse works, which I'm not super familiar with. An exhibition. I think we looked at this earlier. And so anyways, and this is just a cool Nintendo glitch rom series.
00:14:48.718 - 00:15:08.426, Speaker A: And so he talks about how he saw discovered the game when he was eleven. And this is the one part I'm going to highlight. It's a little long to go through the whole thing here. This is what I wanted to highlight. In 2015, I started experimenting. So this would be called data bending 16 bit video game roms using vinesauce. Yeah.
00:15:08.426 - 00:15:36.280, Speaker A: Which is if you go down this route, this is one of the more well known, I think, corruptors. I think I downloaded that which replaces bytes in the game file at designated intervals. Right. So it'll give you the code and then it'll say you can just start to put different letters in the code. And this sort of thing I was inspired by let's glitch it. Donia. Donia, aka let's glitch it and Jordan Bortner's work on the glitch artist collective, as well as Paul B.
00:15:36.280 - 00:16:12.382, Speaker A: Davis and Corey Archangel's pioneering works, hacking NES cartridges in the two thousands. And. Yeah, I remember seeing that when I went to the, the Whitney in its old location. I don't know if that was 2004 or 2007, but it was Cory Archangel's big show, big solo show at the Whitney. All I. Yeah, and there was Super Mario clouds, and there's just clouds going across with some really loud kind of video game, eight bit kind of music. So anyways, you can see the whole thread on Sabato's feed there, but just kind of cool.
00:16:12.382 - 00:16:37.046, Speaker A: I'm a big fan of doing this sort of thing because people want to read about, you know, maybe you want to read about Sabato and what he's working on. So it's totally. And then all of a sudden you have a. Oh, all of a sudden he looks like an expert and he looks competent and he's not if he didn't do that, then you, you know, so it just helps fill in the story a little bit. Nam June paek. Okay, Pac. Nam June Pac, I think, is how we pronounce it.
00:16:37.046 - 00:17:27.173, Speaker A: So, Max capacity, while we're on glitch here, some glitch art academics still don't consider analog video glitch to be glitch art, even after all these years, even though Namjoon Pac's work predates all digital glitch art. So that's an interesting analog video glitch because it does feel like a. Maybe a border case or something like that, because it, you know, I guess the idea is that makes it glitch is if you have an old vhs cassette player and then it's plain, and then you get the streaks across, that kind of which we've all. Like. I remember that when I was a kid, that could be considered glitch. And I guess for some people, this is not necessarily so. Anyways, just kind of an interesting comment.
00:17:27.173 - 00:17:53.316, Speaker A: We're back to Namjoon Pac. Okay, and maybe this is why my friend Turbo or Patrick has the computer on the front. Because I looked up Nam June Pak's work. I think I'm pronouncing that right. And you see, you have all these retro tvs, this person made of tvs. And if you've been to museums in the last ten years, you've definitely. If you've been to MoMA, you'll find the Namjoon pack kind of like a.
00:17:53.316 - 00:18:09.164, Speaker A: I guess you'd call him a media artist. I actually don't know that much about Namjoon Pack, but I'm familiar with. He's not alive anymore. He died in 2006. I thought this was brilliant, though. This USA made of tvs. I think that, like, yeah, like, that's great.
00:18:09.164 - 00:18:49.000, Speaker A: So anyways, that is Namjoon Pak. So to Max Capacity's point, max capacity is saying, well, look at Namjoon Pak. And he's like, maybe he's seen as one of the original glitch people, perhaps. So anyways, FX hash. So I've been kind of seeing this on the periphery, how it seems like effects hash has created kind of a new kind of version. FX params, right? Like a new kind of way of creating generative art. Charcoal seeds by Zancan seems to be, oh, like the kind of it's coming out party.
00:18:49.000 - 00:19:08.940, Speaker A: Charcoal seeds by zancane. 500 pieces via fx params. And not cheap. 1000 to 400 tezos never co created generative art with FX params before. No worries. Here's everything you should know. So another kind of interesting feed here, including introducing what you see is what you get minting.
00:19:08.940 - 00:19:52.344, Speaker A: So it sounds like maybe you need less and less code in order to make a generative art series, is sort of my impression here. And you see here. So I'm not exactly sure. I've never made generative art, but it looks pretty interesting and they have all these parameters here that you can work with and here it comes out. So anyways, just a heads up and yeah, look at all that. And there seems to be something with like tickets and, you know, there seems to be stuff with the market making mechanics or for lack of better words, the selling and the buying mechanics. And here's just an example of one of these works, charcoal seeds.
00:19:52.344 - 00:20:25.944, Speaker A: So here is Zancan. And interestingly, you see this yellow kind of divert, but join here, it's on top of the black, but then you see it divert. So anyway, interesting series here. What is this called? Charcoal seeds number 277. And I assume these are all minted out. Zancane has a huge following in the generative art. And you'll see often if tezos shows up at like art Basel or here when they were at the Berlin art fair, they had Zancan, I believe.
00:20:25.944 - 00:20:52.238, Speaker A: I think. So anyways, demon ego with another work from the studio. Again, back to this idea of educating your audience on what you're up to here. And it's really kind of fun. And it looks great with this kind of great drawing table or cutting table is actually what this looks like. And anyway, almost removed from the notebooks here interestingly as well. So anyways, interesting work from demon ego.
00:20:52.238 - 00:21:05.834, Speaker A: Good night. With scissors. And I thought this was hilarious. So gloom two makes a painting. I saw this on Instagram. And what does he paint? He paints a garbage bag. A trash bag I painted.
00:21:05.834 - 00:21:24.774, Speaker A: So I think that's hilarious. So anyway, I hope to see more from Gloomtube. I'm sure you do too. That's pretty cool. So anyways, Gloomtube is on Instagram. So a beautiful work also came out since our last show, signaled by hastrubal waffle. It's an edition of eight.
00:21:24.774 - 00:22:05.634, Speaker A: And again, just all the stuff we kind of love about hastrubal waffle is here. And we see the flashing in the background and we see ultimately the subject here is someone who's giving signals, almost like at an airport or something like that. And it looks like the face is repeated here and maybe the body and then just the arms are different. Anyways, it looks beautiful as usual. Again, a super highly textured digital artwork 2600 Ad. And maybe that's an inside joke, as he likes to say. As he said on the Twitter spaces last week, I like to leave Easter eggs there for people.
00:22:05.634 - 00:22:26.164, Speaker A: So maybe that's what the 2600 ad is. So anyways, cool work. And I think Bridget New York City picked that up and it was hilarious. And this is also another important thing that has drubble mentioned on the last Twitter spaces. He likes to play with the mechanics. So here he transfers seven of the eight to Ilay. Okay.
00:22:26.164 - 00:22:43.012, Speaker A: And then puts one up for auction. So kind of confounding his collectors, I'm sure. So then Bridget picks up for 26. Bridget New York City picks one up. And so. And then seeing what happens. So Uri J puts in an offer for 15 Ilay list ones for 9000.
00:22:43.012 - 00:22:55.230, Speaker A: I think she gave away. Yeah, because she only has two. Two left. So they're little cake, said Marolla. So probably gave them away to all her friends. So beautiful. Here's another piece by Hezbollah Bolson.
00:22:55.230 - 00:23:15.670, Speaker A: One of these. Almost like the schizo analysis pieces. This is called psychogeography. And that reminds me of who is the author that JG Ballard like? Will self. I think he talked about psychogeography. Anyway, I never read any will self. I think I tried a little bit.
00:23:15.670 - 00:23:44.894, Speaker A: Anyways, I'm not sure if there's any relationship there, but it looks like. Again, I feel like I can talk about this stuff a little bit more because it's just doodling, as hysteruble waffle said earlier. Maalox and everything. So anyway, just an interesting work here with a beautiful rainbow border here. Psychogeography, hastrubal waffle. And do we have any sales? Just an auction and sold for 16 to human boy. Shout out to human boy.
00:23:44.894 - 00:24:03.478, Speaker A: Detour. With beautiful work here. Panorama, sierra, shifting sands and mountainous drains. Really on the edge of abstraction here, aren't we? And you got to love the sky and everything. So just a really nice piece. I assume we could call this glitch. Sure looks like glitch to me.
00:24:03.478 - 00:24:18.682, Speaker A: Let's see. There is no glitch in the hashtags here, but yeah. So anyways. Turturro. One of one. It's a pretty good looking one of one. So anyway, interesting.
00:24:18.682 - 00:24:43.330, Speaker A: Sean Luke with a new work. I don't think Sean Luke has been putting out a ton on object at least. Prismatic mishap, 115 frames. So this looks like a classic Sean Luke work. And so playing with triangles and figures in a frame with kind of an abstract background and the figures seem to be almost falling. So interesting. And the shapes falling from all directions here.
00:24:43.330 - 00:25:10.102, Speaker A: So as an edition of eleven, let's just see what happened here. Transferred perhaps to friends or previous collectors. There's feels, Haiti, rockette and more I brought up. So here is Sean Luke and outsider artist, self called. Yeah. So February was the last time Sean Luke put something out. New York born based outsider artist, 30 plus years of toiling.
00:25:10.102 - 00:25:33.154, Speaker A: So there you have it. So there's Sean Luke back on the scene and santiago. So I thought maybe these were the same person, I think last episode. So it doesn't seem like they are, one would think. And they probably aren't. And some really nice, almost like Brian eno esque music here. Art for interiors.
00:25:33.154 - 00:25:59.374, Speaker A: Almost a Brian eno type. Subtitle palos the music is awesome. So I guess that's nzfs. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. That's really nice music. Santiago. So they're selling for 20 each and there are 21 left.
00:25:59.374 - 00:26:19.532, Speaker A: Continuing on uri j with a one of one abstract piece, one would think with a lot of experimentation in it. So here it is. So pushing a lot of boundaries as usual. So just kind of interesting. Kind of one of a kind digital artist here. Second life. A one of one.
00:26:19.532 - 00:26:38.940, Speaker A: And let's see. And it was sent to illusion. So maybe a commission perhaps, or a friend. And here's Luciana Guerra. Guerra, okay. Luciana Guerra, who we've seen the, we just looked, I think last show at the works on super rare. Kind of like these big abstract works with a lot of color.
00:26:38.940 - 00:26:58.696, Speaker A: Kind of like this, with a lot of color. So here is kind of almost like an inverted one with just. And then turn blue. And I think this is her only work on objects. So Luciana Guerra, open edition for five tezos each. 40 minted and 14 days to go. So I think this just.
00:26:58.696 - 00:27:15.724, Speaker A: When did this launch? April 2. Interesting. So 40 listed or sold so far. Here's someone I don't think we've looked at before. Kazoohiro Ihara Psi edition remix one. And just kind of an interesting abstract here. Gotta love that.
00:27:15.724 - 00:27:32.184, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get volume. No volume. So just. And like this kind of loose, very kind of. We're back to this painterliness that we've been kind of discussing. Interesting ratio here. It's almost like a smartphone.
00:27:32.184 - 00:27:48.082, Speaker A: So kind of interesting here. Kazuhiro ihara they are on object. Let's look really quickly and. Yeah. Okay, so maybe that's an older work. Yeah. We've looked at some of this work here.
00:27:48.082 - 00:28:06.150, Speaker A: And we looked at that. Okay, so maybe that's an older work or a newer work that is unmented. Anyway, continuing on coda Nakazono with a couple of continuums. So these continue to dazzle here. And here is another one. This one in particular I liked. It's just the pixelation.
00:28:06.150 - 00:28:31.248, Speaker A: The pixelation just makes it incredibly beautiful and fun. I don't even know what it is about it. It's kind of an interesting take on pixelation with little noise on top of the pixels, this kind of like little small pixels on the big pixels. Anyways, it's looking great. And I think this is sold out. There are offers, and, yeah, people are just holding onto it. What this sell for? Or did this not sell to anybody? Oh, he's.
00:28:31.248 - 00:29:00.620, Speaker A: Kodenakazono is just holding on for right now on this beautiful work. So maybe you can still get it if you put in an offer. Lorna mills with a one of one state of grace. So, which looks like a tornado. And this is 600 tezos. And just using the blue again, interestingly, and playing with nature again, interestingly. And almost like the tornado is almost throwing around, like, digital noise here.
00:29:00.620 - 00:29:23.324, Speaker A: It's kind of an interesting kind of take on what she's doing because all these little fragments here that the tornado throws out then get masked. Anyway, interesting title, too. State of grace. Kind of mysterious title there. And minted today. Ospreyn with an atomic bomb. This time we've seen the game boy, we've seen the.
00:29:23.324 - 00:29:51.468, Speaker A: The Polaroid camera, and now we have an atomic bomb, disturbingly, somewhat with a sticker on. It looks like a little boy. So, anyways, cool work there. This is another interesting work off of Twitter that I found it was hard to actually make. Hard to figure out what to make of this. I mean, because it's moving so fast, it's almost like blurry pixels there. So, anyway, it's just kind of an interesting piece.
00:29:51.468 - 00:30:09.906, Speaker A: This is Kim Asendorf. And so digital expressionism. So interesting. Give Kim a follow here. There we go. Max Drecker with an interesting piece. So kind of a divergence from previous Max Drecker work.
00:30:09.906 - 00:30:37.114, Speaker A: Kind of almost feels like a slightly deluxe paint background there, doesn't it? Glitch program, Gif. Because if. And I didn't even recognize this because Max Drecker has such a, you know, you recognize it here, such a distinct style, this work. I mean, it's some of the first work you also see on tezos. You notice when you're starting to go through everybody's collections. So kind of a bit of a divergence here. I like it though, a lot.
00:30:37.114 - 00:31:05.248, Speaker A: So cool work here. A different take on this, you know, animated abstract idea. And here's another nice one. Lucas Ox, who I don't think I've ever seen making money to live, making art to survive. Let's look at the work as that loads up. So kind of a nice, soothing, kind of has a feels feel to it. Just a nice, soothing, easy, animated abstract work through a spectrum.
00:31:05.248 - 00:31:19.388, Speaker A: Generative art. That's interesting. Video synthesis, glitch art. Every new beginning comes from some other beginnings. And so this is an open edition for 333. And have any sold? None sold yet. So that is interesting.
00:31:19.388 - 00:31:35.036, Speaker A: Two max of three. Probably a new artist. Newer. No, actually has tons of work. Okay, so I haven't seen Lucas ox for a while though the work. So anyways, cool work. Very nice piece.
00:31:35.036 - 00:31:56.468, Speaker A: Looks like part of a new series. And here is feels, the one and only feels. Feels times art. So again, you look at the amount of views that feels gets 173,000. You almost wonder if feels has been on Twitter for years. Probably because feels has like an amazing amount of followers. Oh, I thought it was 100,000.
00:31:56.468 - 00:32:22.768, Speaker A: It's only 11,000, which is still a lot. But I mean, feels we saw the other day, got half a million on views on that work that we're showing augers. So this is video and processing, video editing, encoding, whatnot. So a cool piece here. Let me just. Max. It's like a sea.
00:32:22.768 - 00:32:47.250, Speaker A: It's like a glitched out sea, seemingly. So, yeah. Bird goes across. So interesting. That is for 36 tezos edition of 20. And so that is on secondary at 36. Let's just see what happens.
00:32:47.250 - 00:33:09.162, Speaker A: Sold out for three. And that was just yesterday. So very cool and more glitch work. This is a still by LB and I think LB has a few stills. Kind of has a bit of a cyborg sort of feel to it, doesn't it? So anyways, nice work from LB. And here are other stills that LB has been putting out. Cool idea.
00:33:09.162 - 00:33:39.100, Speaker A: Just put them out for 15 tezos each and then they slowly start to sell, you know, look at all these other ones gone. Remember spuegels maskinen picked up, I think, one of these. So interesting. And here's some glitch video by Max capacity, transdimensional, she wrote. And that I just wanted to show because my mum is probably watching here. So show Angela Lansbury, who seems to have a memetic life in the Internet here. So anyways, I guess yeah.
00:33:39.100 - 00:34:00.640, Speaker A: So that is considered glitch. This is considered glitch as far as I know. This is rom corruption. So remember Sabato had the thread on corrupt rom corruption and echo. This is the same thing with Haiti Rockette. I mean, similar genre, let's put it that way. Zombie boys playing with Nintendo games rather than Sega.
00:34:00.640 - 00:34:23.544, Speaker A: And there it is. So a new glitch. Rom from nes there from Haiti Rocket by now for one, tezos 23. So pretty reasonable price there. Muji with a one of one for 40. So again, Muji uses d paint, also known as deluxe paint here. Pretty nice one of one again.
00:34:23.544 - 00:34:38.373, Speaker A: So I think Muji put out another one of one. It's called a rainbow x. And yeah, there's a one of one, just the other. Remember cyber holder. So interesting. Muji's getting into the one of ones. So you see deluxe paint.
00:34:38.373 - 00:35:00.973, Speaker A: It looks great. This also, speaking of looking great, look at the tower by manital. So this was stunning, I thought. And it seems like manital is getting more and more kind of elaborate as the series continues. The fire looks awesome in the tower. And of course the lightning is striking it. This is a tarot card, part of the Cat tarot series.
00:35:00.973 - 00:35:28.104, Speaker A: And then I just really like how this. The. The sky lights up a little bit and then interchanges with stars and the stars disappear when the lightning shows up. It's just really, really nicely treated here. The 16th tarot card is a picture of ambition built on shaky foundations. And it symbolizes turmoil and devastation. It is a card that represents up change and upheaval, usually frightening, life altering, and frequently unavoidable.
00:35:28.104 - 00:35:45.324, Speaker A: Change is unavoidable. Change is never easy. Look at how small that file is to make. 121 by 170. So every pixel matters when you're working that small. And then upscaled by ten. So this I don't think is for sale yet.
00:35:45.324 - 00:36:03.936, Speaker A: So very cool work. And a couple of cats there from Manadal. And here's one from Argyle. And who sent this to me? I think it was Varya, I think, sent this to me thinking this looks like it would go on your show. And it sure does. Yeah. So just another interesting pixel artwork.
00:36:03.936 - 00:36:18.944, Speaker A: Life one through five. So kind of an arcade at the top. Interesting frame edition of 25. So it looks like this sold out and. Yeah. What else? Yeah. So anyways, and selling for like.
00:36:18.944 - 00:36:37.010, Speaker A: Sold for 25.55. This is an addition of 25. So selling for a pretty nice price. So people are all over the simulation. Interesting. It's an interesting work. I mean, you have a church, you have a skull with eyeballs coming out and kind of a haunted gothic setting here.
00:36:37.010 - 00:37:08.762, Speaker A: Vanitas. So anyways all interesting here's actually Argyle's page. So I mean I feel like I've seen this style before. And then I wonder to myself is this the same artist? I see nothing wrong with this though. Say in this case tomba battle with just kind of a fun work. Bus station again, always has this kind of 20th century feel. It feels like the source is like maybe pulps or something from the forties and fifties.
00:37:08.762 - 00:37:29.878, Speaker A: There's some even the big suitcase waiting for a bus. So anyways, interesting work from tomb of battle. Eight tazos edition of 20. We saw five this on Twitter kappn. This beautiful work. It's an open edition for 330, 312 have been minted. This awesome, awesome work by Kappin.
00:37:29.878 - 00:37:49.152, Speaker A: So yeah, we were looking at this on Twitter but we couldn't maximize it. So here it is. Big and it looks wonderful. So you know, memories of Zambala and I'm seeing a lot of this vertical text these days. Hidden land. So anyways cool. Available for another day and a half.
00:37:49.152 - 00:38:14.376, Speaker A: Only twelve minted. You know I think Kapman sells less with the open edition sometimes than the closed editions. So anyways, here's another work. Pinky blue. So with a new work on exchange art which is Solana with some cars floating through a pixel scape through a pixelated sky. So just an interesting little loop here. Price of 0.1
00:38:14.376 - 00:38:30.044, Speaker A: sol, open supply 36 have sold. So for 3.6 sol so far, open supply. I wonder if that ever closes. Probably not. Interestingly, elie low with a new work. And let's just check the time here.
00:38:30.044 - 00:39:07.324, Speaker A: So just like a fragment of some sort of Sci-Fi sort of situation. Mysterious as ever from la low buy for 35 tezos and edition of eleven. So let's just see what that sold for. So the prices are going up. Remember Ellie Lowe started at like $0.23 or something. Now it's 450.
00:39:07.324 - 00:39:32.896, Speaker A: So congrats to elie lo for doing it, for making working your way up. Plus was gamma with music this time. Interestingly, I don't know if I've ever seen music with Plaswood's Gamma's work. So a really short loop, like three or 4 seconds. Sound design by taiya Wave. So not exactly sure. Maybe that's just an audio sample.
00:39:32.896 - 00:40:08.876, Speaker A: Walk in motion 2009. So this was just minted, but maybe minting old work as we've seen with some of the work that was on foundation from Chassois Gamma. This is a cool work chick studios can't delete. I think we've all been there. Just a really interesting kind of gif here. So illustrated with kind of like a spray paint type background or airbrush type background and trying to throw out a Jpeg in just kind of negative space. And the cursor is instead of is kind of turns into a hand and almost looks like an AI hand there.
00:40:08.876 - 00:40:40.542, Speaker A: So anyways, wild work from Jake Studios Fortezos continuing on, Lewis Osborne. I quite like this too. You could just kind of watch it over and over. Flat as a pancake and the happy face turned sad after getting flattened by the pancake maker. Looks like a crepe maker, perhaps really smoothly done and kind of just captures everything that I think people like Lewis Osborne for. Just this really smooth, kind of fun animated illustration. Flat as a pancake.
00:40:40.542 - 00:41:06.814, Speaker A: So you can buy it for relatively cheap 17.90. But it's an edition of 50, so let's just look here. So these sold for ten on primary and they all sold within like, look at that, within ten minutes, all 50 sold. So Lewis Osborne continues to make big sales here. And this is Buboy. Just a work in progress. My next for top ten collectors on space.
00:41:06.814 - 00:41:45.224, Speaker A: Woa. So I thought this was pretty interesting. Just a work in progress seeing Buboy in action here. So just kind of interesting and kind of soothing actually, and kind of hangs well with Lewis Osborne style there. And continuing on, another illustration, Bendel Gasm head strike Digital Illustration 2023 I thought this was kind of funny. I saw this on Twitter and just kind of a simple head knocking down some pins, bowling with that. So just kind of a quote unquote, I guess I say the word reservation.
00:41:45.224 - 00:42:17.394, Speaker A: A fun illustration available for a Tezos 50 and it took a few days to sell, but it is gone, I think, once it got on Twitter. See this? So it just shows you can have a work and then if nobody knows about it, you might not make the sales. And as soon as the word gets out, you get a few retweets and it's gone within a few hours. So interesting. Flora Marquez with some more beautiful work, these colors. What is your comfort zone and why? An important question. You always got to be pushing yourself outside the comfort zone, as we all know.
00:42:17.394 - 00:42:49.474, Speaker A: So anyways, you know, my favorite parts of a lot of these are actually the noisiest, kind of the messiest parts here, as we see here in the hair, the mistakes and the color is also awesome. And the subject matter is also really cool, as usual. So what is your comfort zone and why? Time to socialize. And this ladybug, I think comes out. This looks like classic Flora Marquez, available for 20 a one of one is the other available. This is also available. So let's see.
00:42:49.474 - 00:43:06.866, Speaker A: And this one is gone. It's from April 15. Learning to lead without dominating. So if you're looking for your Flora Marquez to round out your collection, you have some work available. So this is kind of cool too. Kind of mysterious too. Almost learning to lead without dominating.
00:43:06.866 - 00:43:27.704, Speaker A: So interesting piece, Dan W. With another work that I can't wrap my head around. Visitor. So a trademark interesting composition. You see how the door is kind of half cut off and the lamp? I mean, this is actually classic. Daniel W. Interestingly.
00:43:27.704 - 00:43:52.786, Speaker A: And the weird kind. It's a weird composition, you know, with the slightly off center light switch and even this little thing, it's pretty trademark, actually. So, visitor, it almost looks like someone coming down an elevator, but maybe it's someone really tall coming in the darkness. Reminds you of the haunted works. Anyway, edition of 16. There are seven left at six. Tezos and Morlakos.
00:43:52.786 - 00:44:14.004, Speaker A: Put this out. Gm. I wonder if it was new because I. But I've never seen it before. I mean, it could be older, but there is a classic, beautiful work by Morlakos, probably made in procreate. And you see, even like the styling of the helicopter, interestingly not colored. The person inside is not colored.
00:44:14.004 - 00:44:36.216, Speaker A: Interesting. So kind of a surreal work. I mean, here we have a castle. Here you have an army helicopter, a face in the sun, these kind of teddy bear outfits. So who knows what's going on. A wizard just kind of in the ground that's covering the car used nfTs. So anyways, interesting.
00:44:36.216 - 00:45:06.524, Speaker A: Gm from Morlacos, the myth with a new work cloak and Danielito. So this is quite beautiful. This also looks like procreate. But I'm not positive about that because those clouds are a little sharper than usual. Shall we take a quick look up close here? Hard to say. Hard to say. I still think it's probably procreate, but maybe it's Microsoft paint.
00:45:06.524 - 00:45:26.196, Speaker A: Anyways, nice work here. Kind of edgy with the gun and the cigarette and everything. And the classic color is the pink hoodie here with the myth on it and everything. So anyways. And the puffer. Puffers seem to be coming in style, I think. Cause I'm seeing a lot of them.
00:45:26.196 - 00:45:45.638, Speaker A: Cloak and Danulito 1992 Fortezo. Still available edition of 5011 left. Cool. Continuing on, Dan Control with continuing the animal series. Now we have a sparrow. So I think the background is some of my favorite stuff. You see the development here in the background.
00:45:45.638 - 00:46:10.918, Speaker A: So cool work by Dan. How many are left here? Nine left at six. Tazos sparrow Jack. I thought this was a poetic work by wasteman Goldman. Family feast. And you kind of see this, you know, critique of what seems to be, looks like chickens that are in the form of like chicken nuggets or something. Pieces of chicken here and it looks like chicken head.
00:46:10.918 - 00:46:44.930, Speaker A: So anyways, maybe a critique of eating meat or chicken from Wasteman Goldminevich. Continuing on Moda Mt. Learn from your mistakes. So another kind of what I just call kind of a honest, again, that's, you know, JG Ballard, the mark of the modern. One of the marks of the modern is honesty. And I think that's what I, there's just something very raw about Moda Mt's work. And you see it across and here you just see it again.
00:46:44.930 - 00:47:17.050, Speaker A: Learn from your mistakes. So simple, you know. So an interesting portrait, there's something about it. Beautiful digital painting. Is that digital painting? Is that photography? Is this AI? Is this a combination? Hard to say. So anyways, moda Mt with a new work and ten have been minted and they are available for three tezos and Louis with an interesting work waiting. And just kind of an interesting portrait with a guy that looks like kind of a bird for a head and a lot of texture there.
00:47:17.050 - 00:47:33.546, Speaker A: Edition of five. And that looks like it sold out for $3.30. So congrats on that. Hasdrubal waffle picked one up. So yeah, nice piece. And moving into AI. And this is Ilya Bliznetz, if I'm pronouncing that right.
00:47:33.546 - 00:48:00.224, Speaker A: And so again, combining AI and painting. And actually I think this is called the Galarus in the Galleris office. So current bid. So someone has bid on it for 0.15. And so met the reserve here on foundation. And so anyway, cool work as usual. So in the gallerist's office, nice kind of big grand piece, interesting face over there and everything as on foundation.
00:48:00.224 - 00:48:31.534, Speaker A: This was super interesting too. So this is Sky Goodman and kind of looks like it's almost like the artist at work, but this seems to be an AI image in itself. The hand, as you can see, 12345. It almost looks like there are too many fingers here and kind of doing something weird and the paintbrush disappears. But it's almost like the AI artist in the studio making the AI sneakers. So anyways, cool work from Sky Goodman. I've been using mid journey actually all weekend.
00:48:31.534 - 00:49:10.430, Speaker A: It's pretty interesting. So I actually have a lot to say on that, but we'll save it for another episode. So mid journey, version five, is it over centering your compositions? So this is funny from clownvamp. Describe your environments first before subjects and styles set to zero, stylize. And yeah, I'm a huge go to the guide. If you're using mid journey, go to the guide. I mean, one of the big things I'll say though is if you're using just the imagine prompt for me, like, you're like, how are people getting such beautiful painterly works? You know, as I reveal at least what I think I may have discovered.
00:49:10.430 - 00:49:43.008, Speaker A: I mean, blend where you take, take this painting, take this painting, take this image, take this image, blend them together and you start to get stuff. So that is an important. So don't just use imagine, go to the guide and look at all the different ways there's remix. Use the different. That's, I think a lot of the secrets to AI art is getting beyond just in, at least in mid journey. Some of the secrets I'm just discovering is get beyond imagine, to state the obvious. So anyways, cool comment.
00:49:43.008 - 00:50:20.290, Speaker A: Interesting comment from clownvamp. Look at this beautiful work by Mister Shapeless. You know, so no centering over centering going on here. And here is a wanderer del Vandereur type figure looking at this almost, almost what I want to call a hieroglyphic sky. Sky of hieroglyphs. And, yeah, so anyway, it's just a whole bunch of objects, it seems like, almost weirdly like a portrait of the mind in its own way. What is his node runner? There's a game called Load Runner, actually, I'm going to release a couple of works this week from that, but node runner.
00:50:20.290 - 00:50:46.174, Speaker A: Yeah, so maybe a reference to crypto somehow. A pretty nice piece, though. And finally, Marina Amadova with a new one, fluorescence. And just an interesting portrait here. Also AI and a couple. And I just like this one. AI based serenity collection developed with Photoshop this by Etken for three tazos.
00:50:46.174 - 00:51:07.730, Speaker A: And I just like the feeling of this one. Kind of feels like spring and barbecues. And finally, what is Ayanna back on the scene. AI and digital painting cover. So taking a bit of a different approach here with the paintbrush strokes on the AI work. And always just a nice contrast there. So that is out from what is Ayana edition of 20.
00:51:07.730 - 00:51:27.834, Speaker A: There are ten left. So they are selling. And I just thought this was interesting to see. I thought Stedman had stopped minting, but really I just didn't see Ralph Stedman. But really I just hadn't seen everything that had been coming out. So lots had been coming out. But the hype that was there when Stedman started seems to have quieted down a little bit.
00:51:27.834 - 00:51:51.502, Speaker A: So, yeah, I mean, you see there's still a lot of works left. I mean, these are pretty large editions, but 200 for a tezos. Yeah. What else do we see here? This one, I mean, of course is going to be more popular with the Mickey Mouse. So anyways, kind of a mixed thing. But it's interesting to see how Stedman, after, I mean, when did he launch? Like four months ago and now. So it's interesting to return here.
00:51:51.502 - 00:52:23.798, Speaker A: I was looking 64 left. Okay. And again, basically minting older physical works. So it's interesting, I think if Stedman, you know, just to reemphasize the point on physical versus digital nfts, I think if Stedman had been making new digital works the whole way, I'm not sure it would be as quiet. So just kind of interesting to check back in. And Cape Mary art, we've looked at a lot of Cape Mary arts, I thought work on Instagram. And I thought this was.
00:52:23.798 - 00:52:41.438, Speaker A: Look at this. So you just see working with the oil pastels, I believe. And there's your headphones. Anyways, I thought this was just a really nice, simple composition. So I thought, let's show this one and other work here. Look at all that blue. So anyways, a really cool artist there.
00:52:41.438 - 00:52:58.378, Speaker A: Kate Mary and Jesse Mackeson. I feel like maybe we've seen this one before. This person, I think is this is it says Dallas, Texas. But I think this person, that's because that's where the art fair is. I think this person's out at LA. Jesse Mackinson, just another really cool artist. And look at this.
00:52:58.378 - 00:53:15.350, Speaker A: Here's the black and white, kind of similar version. Really interesting artist. I think this is oil and. But not too many details on that. So you see others here. So anyways, cool artists there. And that is your show, everyone.
00:53:15.350 - 00:53:18.174, Speaker A: Thank you for watching. And until next time, take care.
