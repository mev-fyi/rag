00:00:05.320 - 00:00:30.654, Speaker A: It's not often I start an episode with a non digital piece, but nugget brain here just does it again. There are more. Getting hungry looking at the doctor Otkar Ristorante. Anyways, let's take a closer look. Artist journal, August 25, 2023. Broadcasting from the pizza parlor in inner space. My name is Adrian Pokebelly.
00:00:30.654 - 00:01:07.926, Speaker A: Welcome back. Welcome back. So it is Friday and I am incredibly excited about that. I've only been back since Monday, but it does feel like two or three weeks already. So thrilled about the weekend. You know, it's kind of weird that when you're on vacation it's like you're surprised at how little you have to do, even though I have certain things I need to do. But then you get back and your schedule just fills up and you thought, how did I go to the beach for like 8 hours a day for two weeks? I don't understand how that works, but maybe it's just back to real life.
00:01:07.926 - 00:01:41.694, Speaker A: Anyway, welcome back. Here we are. So many of you will recognize this artist, this wonderful, wonderful, brilliant artist who is making it look cruelly easy over here. You know, it's the sort of thing that this is one of those art pieces. And I'll show you the other two in the series. It's a beautiful triptych. Actually, they're separate works, so maybe not technically a triptych, but these are one of those works that you just look at and you go, oh, I could do that.
00:01:41.694 - 00:02:12.106, Speaker A: And then you just. It's one of those works you wish you had made is what, you know is how I feel about it. Like it's just, it's brilliant. But, you know, nuggetbrain is making it look easy. And we'll look up nuggetbrains real name here in a second, but making it look easy here. But really prolific artist, consistent artist, puts out a ton of work and then this is what happens. And maybe made these three paintings here.
00:02:12.106 - 00:02:29.424, Speaker A: I'll show you the other two. Here's the other one. So the other one was, I think, pizza scampi. This is pizza. Pizza vegetable. But then all of a sudden, you know, probably put these out in a week, maybe less. These three beautiful, beautiful oil paintings in the shape of pizza boxes.
00:02:29.424 - 00:03:38.950, Speaker A: Brilliant. It does kind of raise questions for me on a technical front. Remember we saw how mech TXT was not tracing. Remember he was putting the aspirate on one side, I believe it was aspirate, and on the other he put the image beside, which is a very important thing to observe because of course, the projector can also be used as a source of painting. And it makes me wonder, this work here, I suspect actually this is a projector. You know why? Because this is the giveaway for me, and I may be wrong, but the giveaway for me is how this lettering is kind of basically perfectly ratioed in the sense that it may not be perfectly done, each one, but it basically occupies perfectly the amount of space that you would need. Because if you were to sort of wing this to get these proportions correct, might be it's not as easy as it looks, let's just put it that way.
00:03:38.950 - 00:04:16.940, Speaker A: Unless, you know. But who's to say? Maybe nugget brain is doing the, you know, which you can do. People know how, you know, traditional painters, that's how they can paint so realistically, just with the eye, you know, with this whole technique here, which you will learn if you go to a realist art school. I recommend, actually, with some reservations, doing those workshops, you know, like paint in the school of the old masters. These two week workshops, I don't know if you're in Toronto Academy of realist art there. I did them, you know, two of them. And it completely demystified it.
00:04:16.940 - 00:05:18.776, Speaker A: Like it's, it's very valuable in terms of. Because it demystified the old masters. Because now I can look at an old master painting and understand how it was built and see really the tricks of the trade and you realize, okay, these aren't some, like, otherworldly geniuses that I'll never, you know, because until you kind of understand how the sausage is made, it's kind of difficult to understand how, like, were people just brilliant, you know, much better draftsmen back then? No, they just, they probably had more practice because they had less screen time, but they had techniques, and that is the key. And as they, you know, just finally, not to go on too many tangents here, but art, the word art, the Greek is art. Techne. It is techne. Sorry, I'm blanking here.
00:05:18.776 - 00:05:57.430, Speaker A: There's a great, actually, you know how I had to remember that there is a great neoplatonic saying, final tangent here, which is kind of, in some ways, neoplatonism. The summits of neoplatonism. Put in one line. Sophia is the arete of techne. Wisdom is the excellence of art. So there, who knows how we got here from Doctor Otker. But techne is the, and this is what I was trying to say, learning the techniques, the rules of art making is to learn the art, the craft.
00:05:57.430 - 00:06:22.044, Speaker A: Okay? In the greek sense, art was basically ways of doing things, rules of doing things. Okay? And that also is an important thing, because sometimes when people don't have that understanding, they come to art and they go, oh, I could never be an artist. Or I, you know, I just don't know. It's. It's like making a basket. It's like basket weaving. Okay? Like, it's.
00:06:22.044 - 00:06:49.480, Speaker A: No, like, yes, there is a poetic element which you bring to it, but without the poetic element, there's a whole lot of basket weaving involved in art making. Now, speaking of which, let's look here. Pizza speciale. So just beautiful work here from. From nugget brain, and I believe I had all three here. Yeah. So pizza scampi, pizza vegetale, maybe.
00:06:49.480 - 00:07:16.094, Speaker A: This is the italian new. So just brilliant. And again, making it look so easy. And, you know. You know what? You know, I say to myself, you know, you love a work when it's. You feel like you wish you had made it. And that's really what these works here, they really make me wish I had made it, kind of, you know, again, kind of projector work, I would argue.
00:07:16.094 - 00:07:54.390, Speaker A: And the interpretation of the image in the process. Part of the also interesting thing of working with projectors is it kind of blinds you a little bit because you have the image projected, and generally you need darkness. And in that darkness, and you have the light that's going on the canvas, so you can't see exactly what you're doing. And that is actually an advantage, because then you make a lot less self conscious marks that you're trying to make poetic. You're just putting stuff out there. So you get the poetry of randomness enters the scene, and that looks much more brilliant most times than whatever you're trying to do. Oftentimes, not always.
00:07:54.390 - 00:08:25.864, Speaker A: So here's Luca Bjornston out of, I believe, denmark nugget brain here on Instagram. It wasn't easy to bring those images up, by the way. And here, cleaners. So, you know, in the great tradition of Warhol, really a really, really, really nice work here. Luca Bjornston, and doing really well. We've been looking at a ton of Luca's work, and so just thrilled to come across. Oh, and let me show you one last thing here.
00:08:25.864 - 00:08:49.564, Speaker A: There's something I missed, which was the display. So I think this is with bricks gallery and the enter art fair, which is kind of a. There. If you're kind of starting out or you're kind of, you know, you're just kind of breaking through in the arts, they're kind of. They're a good place to start. If you're trying to show your work and you're kind of a newer artist, say in Berlin, then these are good guys. They have.
00:08:49.564 - 00:09:17.146, Speaker A: It's not too hard to get your work in there. And yeah, so there's Luca Bjornston, nugget Brain and I mean, 5000 followers relatively emerging, but brilliant. I mean, if I was like a hardcore speculator, like how much are these, right? 42. Like, I would love to just buy that series. That's gonna be worth a fortune. Continuing on, thank you for the comments on yesterday's show. This was hilarious.
00:09:17.146 - 00:09:38.534, Speaker A: Mick renders fist pumping on the car ride to work because you opened with Kuhei. He's been one of my favorites under the radar for a while now. So that is really cool. So of course, Mick Renders was one of the early collectors of that work. And it's great. You know, for me it's, you know, nobody's buying this work. It's kind of a risk of sorts, so to speak.
00:09:38.534 - 00:09:57.664, Speaker A: So it's awesome to hear that people were excited about that. I saw a few different things, but I loved it too. And you just got to go with what you love at the end of the day. Atlas Pop, fabulous show. Once again, I wanted to comment on runetoons. On Runetoon's comment, who I found out lives mere blocks from me in the same neighborhood in Brooklyn. Great community.
00:09:57.664 - 00:10:36.232, Speaker A: On Rune Tune's thoughts on Raw AI, I think of what a poet can do with a few hundred words or less. No one argues that their specific arrangement of words creates something new based on their experience, or that a poet isn't an artist. Using AI to full effect means wrestling with at least the same number of words, if not far more. A one tool piece of art is simply art. And this was my takeaway here, that it kind art is art and however it's made, it's just art. So let's not overthink. It was sort of my takeaway on this comment.
00:10:36.232 - 00:11:02.120, Speaker A: So thank you, Atlas Pop. And if I didn't get that right, feel free to write a message or another comment. But yeah, I thought, again, just interesting comments on the raw AI and there's, I believe this PP universal. Thanks for the comment. Elliot Smith this was kind of, yeah, I almost didn't want to read this just because I generally try and keep things positive here. So this is positive. Cheap art is the coolest on object.
00:11:02.120 - 00:11:36.154, Speaker A: Definitely the wave of selfless creativity will save the site and the NFT market as a whole from the dominance of people like Sabato who sell Barbie glitches for 150 tesos. I love Sabato's Barbie glitches, so I don't know, I wouldn't be. Yeah, I almost don't even want to highlight. I mean, I just thought that was gratuitous and unnecessary. You don't have to love everything. And I think those Barbie glitches are, you know, we've seen a few Barbie works and I would argue those are some of the most. Just capturing the zeitgeist.
00:11:36.154 - 00:12:14.990, Speaker A: I mean, they're brilliant and they're beautiful. I don't know what the problem is. And if Sabato wants to sell them for 150 tezos and someone wants to buy him for 150 tezos, I don't know, what's the problem, you know? So anyway, continuing on, but thank you for the comment. I do appreciate it. And yeah, sometimes things in writing don't really turn out the way they are planned. Strange thing, just catching up. I would argue AI inpainting refines art by filling gaps or more of the artist's vision, enhance coherence, retain emotion and reinforcing human AI collaboration.
00:12:14.990 - 00:12:37.332, Speaker A: Countering soul AI creator copyright concerns. Let's read that again. Just catching up. I would argue AI in painting, which is the part where you select a little bit in the image to replace it refines art by filling gaps or more of the artist's vision. Exactly. It gives you more abilities. I totally agree with that.
00:12:37.332 - 00:13:19.492, Speaker A: Enhancing coherence in a sense, fulfilling the vision closer as well. Retaining emotion and reinforcing human, in a sense, reinforcing the collaboration between the human and the technology. Countering sole AI creator copyright concerns. Right. Because this is also an issue that some people feel that the, you know, because a lot of these image, these AI images are created using copyright images. Well, the more that we're kind of repurposing, remixing, rematching, changing the further these copyright concerns become is how I understand that. So just very interesting.
00:13:19.492 - 00:13:57.254, Speaker A: Great to hear from. Strange thing, just a quick correction here on Zora. I think I said it was on base. It's actually on optimism, which is a L2 on Ethereum. So that is interesting. And I haven't been paying too close attention to apps on optimism, but I'm kind of keep singing this refrain here that I still think digital artists still arguably one of, if not the main use case of these blockchains right now because I'm not using any other app. And okay, granted I'm an artist, I pay attention to art.
00:13:57.254 - 00:14:28.970, Speaker A: So of course I'm going to be gravitating towards the art apps. I'm just saying, like, maybe there's some sort of lending platform, some sort of financial platform, but otherwise I don't, you know, this is the only app that I've had a reason to get concerned with optimism about. So it's just kind of interesting. It just kind of reinforces that. So optimism, not base. And zero one, which I think is on avalanche. And again, you know, I had an avalanche on my wallet, you know, I could plug in and it was all just speculation a couple of years ago.
00:14:28.970 - 00:14:46.494, Speaker A: The only reason to come back is, oh, there's a digital art platform. Zero one. Danielle King time again by Yuri J. Showing her new collects here. So just really cool, what's going on here? So people are excited about it. And here's the homepage again. It's very.
00:14:46.494 - 00:16:15.442, Speaker A: It looks like they took the skin from versum, doesn't it? And it brought up an interesting thought about the homepage and this idea. You know I love open platforms, right? But then I was looking at the homepage and you start going, hmm, maybe curation has a role to play. And then I came to the conclusion as I was looking at the homepage, open but curated in the sense that I think that's my favorite combination, is an open platform where anybody can do anything, but doesn't mean you have to give away the homepage, because you see here, this is just probably whatever is minted on zero one just goes to the top and it has its charms, but then you get everything and it kind of waters down that homepage in terms of. Because you're going to get all sorts of stuff and there is a role for curation, clearly. And so to me, that was kind of the lesson here. And perhaps, I mean, versum, I think is still there, but it never really took off, as far as I understand, at least not yet. And it kind of, and it made me think was, is that because they didn't curate their homepage? Should they have? And as far as I understand, should they have curated their homepage more rather than just doing the straight up feed? The feed is cool, but it does make you wonder.
00:16:15.442 - 00:16:51.764, Speaker A: So open but curated is kind of where I am on these things. Retro Manny, up for some old school fun. So I thought this was a great way to consume the ten comic books that Retro Manny has released here for Retro man. And here in this virtual bedroom, these posters and. And he even got Atmo, who made those incredibly cool cyberpunk works that we looked at maybe six months ago. We should return to those at some point. So just kind of a quick little teaser here and there you see battle, you see paper Buddha and Atmo and more.
00:16:51.764 - 00:17:34.454, Speaker A: So go check that out on retro Manny's page if you want to see more in that cool arcade game arcade game player mbattle in Indonesia Bally Indonesia thanks to SSS gallery showcase for superlative secret society and many other artists. So I'd never heard of SSS gallery and terminates funglitch art superworld. So I think they have a super world in foundation. And here is Tom Bombadil's work projected and then you see artworks on the side. Looks like a pretty nice space, actually. So just kind of cool if you ask me. So that's bimbattle in Bali.
00:17:34.454 - 00:18:26.064, Speaker A: Bezaya de la creme Ricardus is more than just an NFT and I thought this was hilarious. So Mikey de la creme, the work has become a part of my life. So here's Ricardus by Beziah on Mikey de la Creme's bed is almost a comforter. And I thought to myself, you know, Mikey de la creme loves nfts so much that he wraps himself in nfts before he goes to bed. So that is awesome and it's great to just see work in the physical world. Spiegelsmaskinen interestingly, inventory refill tomorrow is working on what looks like a GLB. And what I thought was particularly interesting about this is it's a GLB, but you get, you kind of keep the dithering and I think we have seen that before, but it's just really nicely done here and it just looks really cool, this kind of old fashioned laptop.
00:18:26.064 - 00:18:51.742, Speaker A: Just really cool. So also from Spuegel's maskinen as we dive into the art here. So a collaboration with Sky Goodman and Spguls Maskinen. And this was a series minted or a work daily minutiae minted on foundation. And a few have been minted so far. At 0.03 ETH, I think you still can.
00:18:51.742 - 00:19:21.004, Speaker A: So here is the work. And so you kind of see the Spiegel's tv and chair, one suspects. And then it looks kind of like Sky Goodman's work is flying out of the screen. And you see almost those colors that are reminiscent of Sky Goodman in what comes out of the screen. So a pretty cool collaboration over here and just nicely done. So those are available for 0.03 ETH on foundation.
00:19:21.004 - 00:19:42.092, Speaker A: Mika Eladev I don't know if this is an older work or not, but I thought it was pretty cool. Good night. And so here, this is a good practice. I keep on meaning to do this. Just an easy way to post your work if you're trying to. Finally, a little sunshine in here. If you're trying to post your work, you know, kind of a common.
00:19:42.092 - 00:20:04.134, Speaker A: What you'll see a lot of people do is GM. And then you just post an old work, and then gn, good morning and good night. And you post your work twice a day, and it's just a way to get your work out here. And then you just. Here I come across, oh, I've never seen this work by Mika Oladev before. So just cool. Somfe also with what looks like kind of video glitch work.
00:20:04.134 - 00:20:36.546, Speaker A: Kind of reminiscent, a little bit of that. I want to call it like infinite ballerina by LB, but different. I love these, you know, feedback esque delay dancers. I think they look beautiful and are just kind of just naturally cool. Somfei with some nice work here on Twitter. Exmortal with a few kind of abstract glitchworks, modular Eurorack. So using a lot Roland mixer capture device.
00:20:36.546 - 00:20:54.826, Speaker A: So there are a few of them here. So I thought I'd show them. They came out the last few days. So here you see kind of a triangle shape. And here, almost like an obelisk void window. It's like a little series here. Cool feedback and cool snow feedback here.
00:20:54.826 - 00:21:26.896, Speaker A: And here's another one with two triangles kind of overlapping gravity. Well, also, I think it's three that kind of seemed to be in this series here. Oh, now it's really coming in strong. Continuing on Slava three, I believe is, how you say, slava's work here. Slava three NGL. And this is a work on foundation. And this was a bid has come through.
00:21:26.896 - 00:21:58.530, Speaker A: So it was minted at 0.142 and a bid was placed. Endless fall with unpredictable consequences. So let's just take a closer look here. And we see almost like a 3d rendered skeleton here in a cockpit of sorts with some cool machinery and almost flying through the city here with a little Christmas tree for to make everything smell good. So interesting there. And interesting contrast between the black and white and the color through the window.
00:21:58.530 - 00:22:18.530, Speaker A: And just cool kind of flashing images in the background there. Interesting work. This is on zero one. I found this just kind of enigmatic. This is by an artist called Nikita, called one. And just kind of an enigmatic kind of flashing. It looks like kind of a skull here.
00:22:18.530 - 00:22:43.116, Speaker A: Not quite sure what's going on, but I just found it kind of enigmatic. So again, so two of 13 editions are maybe available. And here you see, or maybe two have been bought here. You see little cakes here on zero one. So again, I believe this is on avalanche. Dina Chang retweeted this work here, and I thought it was pretty cool. Lucy Benson is the artist.
00:22:43.116 - 00:23:29.670, Speaker A: Let me see if I can play it here. Lilex swarm interference aura artwork collection. Exploring the overlap of generative visual phenomena resulting from signal interference common to both neurobiology, as experienced in migraine, stroke, seizures, et cetera, and audiovisual computer based imaging systems. Each piece created individually from a self programmed generative AV feedback system by mimicking my own visual aura, then colored, layered and finished by hand. So pretty elaborate process here. And so we're starting with a bit of video kind of glitch work. This one, though, has been taken to a further level and kind of almost looks like an illustrative animation of sorts.
00:23:29.670 - 00:23:57.754, Speaker A: But as you see, kind of started with generative av feedback. So just kind of cool work here for sale for twelve tezos. There's Dina Chang and Danielle King and Annika Meyer. All sorts of collectors for Lucy Benson. I'm not sure if I've looked at Lucy Benson's work before, and maybe this one is. So this one really is different, seemingly, but quite a bit of work here. So anyways, another artist to explore.
00:23:57.754 - 00:24:29.066, Speaker A: Disarray, hallucinations. This one was really cool by blood 281. And I thought this was pixel glitch. Just an interesting series here. So edition of ten. And I just thought kind of, you know, kind of look like pixelate pixel art, almost kind of blueprints of sorts, or I want to call them not wireframes, but almost just like the outlines of structures here. Warping, twisting, I feel distorted.
00:24:29.066 - 00:24:59.552, Speaker A: Interesting color scheme, I might add this kind of pastel green and the neon pink with the white. Just a pretty cool kind of mysterious series here. I'm not sure what software was used made in gimp. Now, a lot of people like Gimp, by the way, and I believe Gimp is free. So still available for three tezos, by the way. Still seven available and others are available expandor. So you can still get this series here.
00:24:59.552 - 00:25:29.460, Speaker A: So just a cool kind of, you know, I'm a big fan of little series where as a collector, I probably have some bleh 281, but let's say I didn't. Or maybe I want to get some just to round out the collection. And I go, oh, I like this series. There's four works, three tezos each. I can get everything for basically $9. And then in the museum, in my mind, I got a wall, right? So there's something to be said for these kind of small, limited series of sorts. And here's the other one.
00:25:29.460 - 00:25:45.700, Speaker A: Hallucinator. That was actually my very first dj name. It never. I never really went public with it. Hallucinator locked inside. So here, just another work here. Another experimental pixel artwork using gimp.
00:25:45.700 - 00:26:00.508, Speaker A: Gonna have to try out gimp at some point. You can probably recognize who this is. Element Li. The title is interesting. You almost need the title cave. 200 pixels by 200 pixels. So just another really interesting experimental pixel artwork.
00:26:00.508 - 00:26:33.416, Speaker A: So I guess this is a caveat. An interesting, just, you know, great subject matter. And you gotta love how it's, like, not perfectly square or at least like, perfectly rigid straight line. Like you kind of have this, you know, that's part of the charm of element Li's work. You know, this doesn't meet up here in this corner. There's kind of a bit of a roughness to it that is just really cool. So continue to just love what I see here from elemently bravepixel on super rare.
00:26:33.416 - 00:26:58.554, Speaker A: So an interesting work. Kind of looks like a sorcerer's room here, or an alchemist's room. You see, almost looks like somewhere like Andre Breton in a roleplaying games office or something here you see the masks and almost, maybe there's the light, maybe a birdcage. Not sure. Some dragon. So all sorts of interesting things may. Some potions here, a cat.
00:26:58.554 - 00:27:32.552, Speaker A: So a cool work here, some sort of orb of the world and more so just kind of a cool work here. Daydreaming by bravepixel. A collector of memories lives in this house, each part of which represents a little of what he is believing it to be. Possible is the beginning, but who knows what the end will be? So very enigmatic from bravepixel. Cool work on super rare. So this is cool too. In the pixel art section here, Michael Macasso showing works in progress using, I believe, aseprite here.
00:27:32.552 - 00:28:15.260, Speaker A: Interesting. You see how he's doing a bit of an underdrawing here, kind of a rough underdrawing, and then goes on top to kind of fill it in. Almost an old master style again. Old masters, they'll often put the sepia underneath, like orangish yellow or orangish red, sometimes a gray, but they'll use that as an underpainting. And then you start applying your. You know, and then I think you do it then, like another kind of old master technique is let's say you have this as a start. Then you can either put it in black and white, your image over top, or on top of that layer.
00:28:15.260 - 00:28:57.558, Speaker A: Or you can use sepias as well, and have like a dark, a burnt or a raw umber underneath for the dark browns, and then all the way up to your, you know, burnt siennas as these lighter reds and add white. And so you create this work that is just kind of all sepias. And then basically what that does is if you have skin colors, then it gets much easier to get to where you're going as you paint this work. And the under layers of the oil painting will show through. I just think it's interesting. There's almost like an analogous, simpler technique here, but an analogous technique at work nonetheless. A warm background, nice little out, rough outline here.
00:28:57.558 - 00:29:19.914, Speaker A: And then you slowly start to kind of conceal or to realize your image closer and closer. So that is also part of the kind of old masters techniques. It's rougher at the start. And then as you add more layers, you kind of zero in on your work here. Anyway, it looks great. Work in progress takes time. Time.
00:29:19.914 - 00:29:42.348, Speaker A: And here is more as you see this develop here. So, again, so the water is coming in, and you see how, what it looks pretty manual how Michael Macasso goes about these things. So just really nice to see this work in progress here. Chasing shadows of old. Work in progress. Continuing on more pixel art. Notorious man.
00:29:42.348 - 00:30:15.112, Speaker A: This is on exchange art. So now we're on Solana. Look at how many different platforms there are for art these days. Like, it's getting interesting. Will there be a winner take all? Who knows? Probably not is kind of my thoughts. If there's going to be a winner take all, it's going to be more like if object went multi chain, where all of a sudden they could show Solana Ethereum, Zora. That would be because maybe object has concerns, right? I would have concerns if I was object.
00:30:15.112 - 00:30:32.258, Speaker A: Right now I'm seeing, okay, this Zora thing just kind of came out of nowhere. Artists are getting pulled over to it. I also see this ten art. And so again, I'm kind of back to if I was object. No problem. Have at it. We'll incorporate all of you.
00:30:32.258 - 00:30:43.562, Speaker A: That's what I think they should do. Just go multi chain. And we just choose avalanche. And then we have all our stuff there. One place to collect everything from. So brave. Sorry.
00:30:43.562 - 00:31:14.018, Speaker A: It is notorious man XTZ amethyst ascent for 0.25 sol. There are twelve of 15 remaining. And this is on exchange art. Just a really charming, cool colors, you know, small canvas here, as you can see. Nice dithering and kind of nice simple animation here, too. And of course, Mandal, who looks like is working like this, looks like DJ software, Scratchmaster, VDO.
00:31:14.018 - 00:31:30.310, Speaker A: So it kind of looks like there's music here. And maybe the cats are djing over top. And it looks like it goes for like an hour. So I'm not exactly sure. Yay. Mixing with music by P with the one. See you very soon, Solana.
00:31:30.310 - 00:32:11.680, Speaker A: So here's Solana. We've looked at, I think, four blockchains here, right? I mean, you have tezos, solana, avalanche, if I'm not mistaken, and also optimism, which is on Ethereum, I mean, four or five blockchains here, and just a cool kind of sketch here for those that make pixel art. It all looks easier once it's done. It looks easy, but this is easier said than done. Some mountain art by Macbeth, minimal Macbeth on Twitter. So just a cool kind of interesting canvas size, too. And I love these works here by Francoise Gammer.
00:32:11.680 - 00:32:49.564, Speaker A: I think they're older works. Lanvix, three, big fan of this and just a cool landscape here and bringing it to life with some animation. If there's no animation on this work, it wouldn't be quite as alive and quite as just fun and attractive, but just that little bit of life that, like here. I'd argue the animation is required and is very important to the work. Continuing on Kappn's gift shop, I was trying to figure out what this is. I wonder, is this a vaporizer? I don't know. It looks like something maybe someone can tell me.
00:32:49.564 - 00:33:11.582, Speaker A: But anyway. But you see the magistracy of Kappn or Kappn's gift shop at work here. And again, I don't know what this is. Kind of interesting, but cool work. Steezy. I think this was sent to Mcrenders because I think I saw a tweet on that. So not sure exactly what's going on there, but it's cool work, as usual.
00:33:11.582 - 00:33:46.184, Speaker A: Great to see Kapn's gift shop Soba Santuz with another nice glitch here. Nintendo glitch rom. Kind of a noisier one, isn't it? So what I really love about Silva Sand Iis, and I really like this kind of just the experimentation of Silva sand. Two s I really like, really pushes in different directions and interesting kind of fills here. Interesting, interesting work. Glitchboarding. Almost a metaphor for the artistic process itself.
00:33:46.184 - 00:34:14.668, Speaker A: Haiti rockette flux fracture. So another interesting experiment here another to go with Hades abstract art collection that he is making. And interesting background. Probably playing Amiga 1200. I wonder if this is that. What was the name of that software? I want to call it like balance, but it was some other rad magics. I don't know if that's the name of the software.
00:34:14.668 - 00:34:31.993, Speaker A: Anyway, more interesting work using some, finding some pretty obscure tools though and playing. I think I recognize that tool though. Most wrong king. This could hang in the same room. Kind of a cool. Another just kind of gif work I found on Twitter. I didn't see it minted anywhere.
00:34:31.993 - 00:34:50.677, Speaker A: Every day. It's kind of cool. I thought this one was quite epic. The Santiago work here, this abstract find is trying to get to the site and give us this key and it will melt and a feeling of warmth will join us. Nice writing there. This is at auction I think for 100 tezos. Pretty cool.
00:34:50.677 - 00:35:25.278, Speaker A: This one kind of has quite an epic feel to it, doesn't it? So worth noting here, aseprite P five J's, cameradraw gimp inkscape. So several different softwares involved and that is available on tazos also human kernel at auction for 20. Look inside time and there's something kind of. I really like the simplicity, the rawness of this work of just this guy with glasses kind of looking over. Really like the background here too. Beautiful, beautiful background. You kind of get an up close and personal look at the.
00:35:25.278 - 00:35:50.102, Speaker A: I love the scale. Like how big a lot of these pixels are. And you see it here. It creates a nice effect for these portraits here. One of, one from human kernel, sometimes believed to be Santiago Renki with another work, Uzuki. So again, putting out the one work a day, I think. And again playing with that feedback beautifully, mixing it with some pixels here.
00:35:50.102 - 00:36:15.346, Speaker A: Really nice work. Eleven tezos, one available. And Koda Nakazono with an interesting work here. Continuum number 140. A one of one. Let's just maximize that with some nice big chunky pixels here, some sort of organic form in front, and interesting backgrounds here. And that went for 150 tezos to Bijou, who likes to buy one of ones.
00:36:15.346 - 00:36:41.874, Speaker A: So still a market out there. And this actually goes Rannick steer. This actually goes quite well with that kotenakazono. And here you almost see a face of sort in the metallic sort of abstraction here. And just an interesting kind of surreal, abstract, kind of sculptural work from Rannaxteer edition of ten. There are ten left. And that is three tezos for only $2.06.
00:36:41.874 - 00:37:07.764, Speaker A: Cool title. Mindforge and Mika Oladev another work here, artifact number 26. And this is a one of one. And just more interesting glitch work here. Unusual glitching. 45 tezos also went to Bijou. So another thing that collectors will do is when they see tezos at $0.68
00:37:07.764 - 00:37:34.156, Speaker A: or whatever it was, they will buy a bunch so that they can buy a bunch of cheap art. Because maybe 45 tezos, you think, oh, that's a pretty good price. But really it's probably like $30. So, you know, collectors will come out of the woodwork when Tezos gets cheap enough. So it's worth continuing to mint. Like, look at how cheap this is. Because don't forget, I mean, this is, say this, Lewis Osborne here at 19 tezos.
00:37:34.156 - 00:38:05.606, Speaker A: If Tezos was $1.25, this would be like $24. Now it's 13, right? So you almost have a 50% off, like an already low Tezos price. So artists being sold very cheap here in pursuit of happiness. And I thought this was actually a really brilliant work here with this kind of happy face that everybody is chasing over here as they bounce away on the rat race of sorts here and bouncing forward. And it looks like. I wonder if they.
00:38:05.606 - 00:38:30.944, Speaker A: And as they bounce backward, they become unhappy. Quite brilliant, I have to say. Quite brilliant by Lewis Osborne here. And there is just the perma happy guy at the front. Hilarious. And this came out when this came out, the 20 August. This recently came out, 18 August and sold out at twelve Tezos edition of 50.
00:38:30.944 - 00:38:57.788, Speaker A: Continuing on, Timothy Julien. I don't think we looked at this one. This one is brand new edition of ten by the bay. So just another cool kind of work here. Yeah, because the other one looked like a bit of a different style. So this one, again, playing with these kind of architectural, simple works. We know Timothy Julien from months ago with these super cool, kind of Liechtenstein esque interiors.
00:38:57.788 - 00:39:20.364, Speaker A: Now working on exteriors and playing with the pool and kind of similar ideas. So interesting to watch it develop. Edition of ten. And they're sold out at $0.50, which is awesome. There's bodacious pirate shoutout and Louie caving wild with another abstract here. And just this is semi abstract.
00:39:20.364 - 00:39:44.552, Speaker A: And again, the title, I think, is moonstone. And they're kind of tempting to think that's the moon. This looks kind of architectural and almost like buildings of sort, but so semi abstract here. Edition of twelve for 250. Interesting minimal color scheme. And these pluses here are pretty cool, actually. I think it actually adds a lot to the work here.
00:39:44.552 - 00:40:10.788, Speaker A: It's an interesting. What I'd be tempted to call an interesting complicator. Caving wild is the artist. We've looked at them, and, of course, you know, not wasting any time here, you probably recognize the artist cider with a very quick processing of this image, which came out a few hours ago. Let's just look. Donald Trump mugshots by cider. You know, almost in the tradition of Warhol here in those early mugshots.
00:40:10.788 - 00:40:27.904, Speaker A: And look, already has a bid. There is a power in doing kind of this real time news art and .1 Ethan to Steven Vasement. But it is still available for another 19 hours. So how long did. Just 20 minutes after mint. This person wanted this.
00:40:27.904 - 00:40:47.078, Speaker A: And just interesting processing here, as usual. Continuing on, Mikey Wilson with. So instead of a guitar, we have a gun. I'm not sure what kind. I want to say an Uzi or something, but I have no idea what kind of gun. This ain't a scene. It's an arms race.
00:40:47.078 - 00:41:31.116, Speaker A: And so I saw a tweet from Mikey saying he was switching in this piece from the guitar blues player to his favorite character in Gi Joe, who's called snake eyes, where my love for the balaclava, or as I like to call it, the baklava, first began. So there's the balaclava, and there is snake eyes in an AI painting. Another beautiful painting by Mikey Wilson. Look at this great painting on the back here. And it's going to be interesting again within painting. Let's say you didn't like this painting in the back. As an artist, you could go, oh, I'm just going to select this, you know, whatever your, you know, prompts are.
00:41:31.116 - 00:41:49.616, Speaker A: I'm still trying to figure out some of those painterly prompts, you know, but make it more painterly. Make it more like oil paint. Make it more, you know, and you'll be able to do that. So in painting, you know, is a big deal, it seems. And there's strange thing weighing in on it. So probably a big deal to him, too. Pp universal.
00:41:49.616 - 00:42:09.808, Speaker A: As we go into the physical work, old might digitize. What do you think? What's her name? What she have in her plate? So just a old drawing from pipiuniversal. Pretty cool drawing, too, I might add. And I want to show it. So here, because now we saw it was digitized, so to speak. And here it is. And cool window here.
00:42:09.808 - 00:42:37.400, Speaker A: And just cool interpretation as you travel across the mediums here. Right? So una estregi strategia brillante. As I try and speak Spanish here, look at how beautiful this is. Could have started with this, too. Never heard of this person. Ferrari shepherd massive roses 2023 Artsy's feed was posted as I thought. Pretty nice work, isn't it? You know, pretty original.
00:42:37.400 - 00:43:11.256, Speaker A: Here's Ferrari shepherd, born 1983 blurring the lines between abstraction and figuration, Ferrari shepherd creates mid to large scale paintings, delving deeply into the collective consciousness of humanity. La based painter born in Chicago. So here are some of the other works. I have to say, these other works are pretty cool, but that vase of flowers kind of feels like a breakthrough work, doesn't it? And you see, these are from, like, 2021, 2020. Here's 2023. But this vase of flowers, as I like to say, someworks just hit. And this one.
00:43:11.256 - 00:43:33.366, Speaker A: Yeah, hit it out of the park. Beautiful, beautiful. And, of course, walk. And I don't know, actually, the reference, clearly, it's some sort of album with a PG 13 or parental guidance is advised sort of thing. Migos. So I don't know it, but it's really cool and classic. Just beautiful, abstract, I'd say by walk, I think.
00:43:33.366 - 00:43:39.894, Speaker A: And that is your show. My friends, thank you for joining me. Have a wonderful weekend, and until next time, take care.
