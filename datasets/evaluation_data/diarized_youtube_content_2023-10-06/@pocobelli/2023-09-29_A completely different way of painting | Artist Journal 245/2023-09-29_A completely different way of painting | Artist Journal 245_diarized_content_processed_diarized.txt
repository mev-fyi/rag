00:00:05.680 - 00:00:29.446, Speaker A: The journal is back, my friends. It is Friday, and what a week it has been for all of us. I'm sure we're deep into September, deep into the seas here, the high seas, the imagination, as we continue to navigate further in what probably seems to be a massive digital art revolution. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. The debate continues. Artist Journal, September 29, 2023.
00:00:29.446 - 00:01:09.008, Speaker A: Broadcasting from the Cartographers workshop, deep in inner space on the pirate ship of the mind. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. As we continue our marathon here, it feels like sometimes Friday just feels like you're in a marathon and you're just running and running and. But then you know what my favorite part of exercising is? One of my favorite kind of experiences with exercises. I go to the classes because I'll never do work by myself. As far as exercising, it's a little dry, it's a little boring for me. So I like to have people around me, and they really push you about ten times harder than they will.
00:01:09.008 - 00:01:54.382, Speaker A: The hair's on full blast here this morning here. They will push you harder than. At least for me, harder than I ever will be on my own. And you kind of get tired. Let's say you're getting really tired, but then sometimes about like two thirds the way through a 45 minutes class, almost like 35 minutes in, you get that what I call escape velocity, the second wind, where all of a sudden you just have full energy, and then that kind of reinspires you, and all of a sudden you're stronger, arguably, than when you started. You're just getting warmed up, and then you get that kind of full on. We're kind of back to the inspiration topic, the power of the mind to inspire us to move and to do things.
00:01:54.382 - 00:02:39.254, Speaker A: So that is part, we talk about everything here, and so let's get into it. I think it's going to be a nice kind of tighter, shorter show here, thankfully for all of us, as we approach the end of our exercise class for the week here. And so here is cider with. I feel like this kind of looks like a meme that I don't recognize. I feel like this is an owl and this is a crow done with Cider's beautiful, beautiful style. And if you've never heard of cider before or seen his work, he's a 21 year old in Brazil, studies industrial engineering, who makes these gorgeous works. Not even, like, a huge background in art history, just, he's a natural.
00:02:39.254 - 00:03:20.080, Speaker A: He's basically a natural in the digital art space and just makes these incredibly beautifully textured works. Part of the magic of these textured works is CidR uses, I believe, sometimes physical, physical objects. So let me just see if I can zoom in here. Because when you see work, like, kind of, I don't even know what I'd call this. Maybe we're back to the detritus word or just particle matter kind of shooting around like this. And you're thinking, if you're wondering, is this 100% digital? I'm assuming it's probably not. I mean, this looks like there is a physical influence.
00:03:20.080 - 00:04:11.304, Speaker A: And look at how great this is. These textures here, these digital textures. Got a nice sharp beak here on what looks like the owl, but then just, like, the feathers and everything, just, you know, it's really brilliant. It's painting in a completely different way, isn't it? This is not, you know, using the, buying the special brush at the store, learning mediums, so that you make these gorgeous brush marks, you know, using the liquid acrylics, you know, with the heavy duty gel, and then you get your brilliant brush marks, for example. This is a completely different way of working, of mark making. This is digital painting. Right? And, like, the only brush that's perhaps used is maybe an apple pencil or a wacom at some point or a mouse.
00:04:11.304 - 00:04:37.064, Speaker A: So this is a completely different beast. Nevertheless, we still maintain gorgeous, gorgeous textures here. Painterly textures. Novel painterly textures. So, and I mean, look at the eye. I mean, again, cider, a natural. And look at all this interesting, you know, depth and everything.
00:04:37.064 - 00:05:01.042, Speaker A: The color, beautiful contrast here, the red with the yellow. This great mark making, I want to say. Although, again, this is not like, you know, the mark make. This is like mark making as a form of editing. And this is the crow, by the way. But this is like decision making, mark making over. You know, I'm going to do my arm like this.
00:05:01.042 - 00:05:38.912, Speaker A: I'm assuming it's more like, I'm going to take the transform tool, or I'm going to apply this filter. I'm going to scan this in. Maybe I'll rescan and process and export as a bitmap. Who knows? Right? And that is one of the joys, actually, of a good artwork, oftentimes, is you don't know how it's made when you don't know how it's made. When you kind of have it all figured out, it can still be brilliant and beautiful and amazing. But sometimes one of the joys of an artwork is actually not really knowing exactly how it was made. The mystery remains.
00:05:38.912 - 00:06:10.420, Speaker A: It kind of plays with the viewer a little bit, these red eyes and this crow looking off, so and even just like these 3d textures in here. Just completely original if you ask me. Just beautiful and beautiful. And you know, a homage to the digital in these square shapes here too, but again, as broken off pixels. I mean, it just brings out this digital poetry here. This is digital poetry. So just awesome work from Cider.
00:06:10.420 - 00:06:40.130, Speaker A: And this was just released on the 25th. So one of the works that I missed earlier this week and sold to Blues Oner. Bluesoner who? And it was a transfer, so private sale, very likely. There they meet at night, a play of distortion with digital illustration and collage. So a little a clue here from Cidr. And if you want to know more about cider, we did a space with CiDR just a few weeks ago, three weeks ago maybe. And it was awesome.
00:06:40.130 - 00:07:02.450, Speaker A: Super interesting guy. So let's move on to the comments here and some great comments as usual. Score. Thank you so much for reviewing palenopsis. This work is made with touch design, touch designer and Adobe. Also, I used a 3d scanner called Scaniverse. I've been interesting a 3d scanner called Scaniverse.
00:07:02.450 - 00:07:17.058, Speaker A: I've been enjoying to make the series of scanning works. So kind of back to this idea of physical to digital and back. I would love to come to your space. Sounds really fun. So I was mentioning this thinking out loud. So yeah, that's awesome. Score.
00:07:17.058 - 00:07:32.482, Speaker A: I'd be very happy to have you on one of these Wednesdays. Maybe in like three weeks or so would be pretty beautiful. Maybe sooner. Let me get back to you on that. I will message you this weekend. So that is exciting. So Yeri, totally appreciate the comment.
00:07:32.482 - 00:07:49.098, Speaker A: Very good. As always, I value your work and I think it is a great contribution to the ecosystem. Thank you very much. I totally appreciate that. And Rada, I really appreciate these encouragement tweets. I don't know how you do it. So, you know, it's sort of like complimenting people.
00:07:49.098 - 00:08:03.312, Speaker A: It's really nice. It's like a bottomless. You can always feed more. It's like a bottomless well. So anyways, I totally appreciate this, guys. It's nice to know that people are enjoying it. Retro Manny, funny regarding the never criticize.
00:08:03.312 - 00:08:24.484, Speaker A: So we're discussing how to win friends and influence people. Chapter one, never criticized within the context of art criticism. I was an art lecturer for ten years. Quit in 2021. Wow. And we describe that feedback as a shit sandwich behind closed doors. Positive bread to soften the negative feedback.
00:08:24.484 - 00:09:11.704, Speaker A: So start positive to soften the negative feedback in the middle and then maybe you end positively. Definitely works to encourage younger artists on their journey. Yeah, so if you're going to criticize, definitely start positive. But harsh criticisms comes with the territory of exposing your art and soul in the real world. And absolutely, I'm not encouraging people to be, you know, for lack of better term, snowflakes here or just kind of easily, you know, being an artist at any time, but also today it requires a very thick skin and yeah, so that comes with the territory. I totally agree. Outside of the safety of art school, being ignored is much more demotivating in the long run.
00:09:11.704 - 00:09:45.538, Speaker A: And I actually agree. Like, I mean, I can't remember the name of that artist that Jerry Saltz commented on, but in the end, again, it worked out great for that artist. And yeah, I totally agree because as someone who didn't necessarily have a lot of attention for several years as an artist, so even though. But you still do it, you know, if you're driven, you just have to do it. It's just one of those things. Anyway, another great show. Love when you go in depth on topics of the moment and look at things from different perspectives.
00:09:45.538 - 00:10:05.974, Speaker A: Not to say I don't love discovering all the great art. Also, Spiegelsmaskinen work was incredible. A few people mentioned that. Spiegelsmeskinen, that was a pretty grand piece. I think I was watching the full piece for the first time live there. Pretty amazing. So thank you for the comments and a few more here just from the Twitter feed.
00:10:05.974 - 00:10:29.878, Speaker A: Dragic, thanks for reflecting on my comment. Funny thing crossed my mind. Wonder how you'll do your shows when bull market starts and everybody comes back flocks back into nfts. It's kind of hard to imagine at this point. I'm just used to it being like this, but it is kind of an insane thought, rustic and I wanted to mention this as well. Thanks for the comment, dragic. Just watch the show.
00:10:29.878 - 00:10:51.480, Speaker A: Great. The only thing is my piece, look at the sky with all the little marios in it is from long months ago. I guess it must have appeared on your timeline. Sorry about that. Although you sounded happy enough that it was on the show. So all good here. But yeah, sometimes on object now they have notifications if something gets repriced, so that if I'm not careful I'll think that that's a new work.
00:10:51.480 - 00:11:11.344, Speaker A: So anyway, I think we have another rustic in today's show. Actually, it's great to see rustic back and thank you for the comment. Macbeth. Love watching the show. You show so many great artists, some I haven't heard of, so I end up pausing it to research more, bookmark, and collect. Thanks for educating the space well, I'm totally glad you're enjoying it. And gwock, thank you for the comment.
00:11:11.344 - 00:11:24.156, Speaker A: Xizzy, you had me at the Alistair Crowley reference. Okay? And great art, too. Hilarious. Always interesting. So thank you everybody for the comments. So on to the world at large here. I kind of had to show this.
00:11:24.156 - 00:11:55.944, Speaker A: I guess I didn't have to, but I wanted to. So here's the Van Gogh Museum. They're doing a Pokemon crossover of sorts. And so this is in the if you've ever been to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, it's actually one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had, by the way. So you just see total mayhem here. And here's another one. Really looking forward to a day at the Van Gogh Museum to watch Pokemon scalpers at Van Gogh Museum.
00:11:55.944 - 00:12:27.696, Speaker A: So I guess this stuff is going on eBay for like, a lot of money. So people are buying Pokemon van Gogh paraphernalia to sell on eBay at like, much like ten x the price. So total madness here. Just kind of interesting. Here is the. I went to the Van Gogh Museum website, and again, this is a must see. Maybe not during the Pokemon show, but this is a must see to see all the van, a lot of van Goghs together.
00:12:27.696 - 00:13:25.790, Speaker A: And then you just go, and, I mean, what was the texture, color, composition? I mean, that was, to me, like, and maybe that's totally obvious, but van Gogh, if I had to sum it up in three statements, texture, color, composition, and maybe that's every painting, but that's all I saw with every painting. It's just like those three things were nailed and. Yeah, so here it is. I mean, I don't even know what this is. Van Gogh Museum 7 January 20 until 7 January. So this mayhem is going to go on for a few months here, join the Pokemon adventure and get a special promo card to add your collection. I mean, this kind of came up, which is partly why I brought it up with Brian Arthemore in the space on Wednesday, which is this idea that in France, under 25 years old, people get into all museums for free, or the major museums for free, and how still only one or 2% are going.
00:13:25.790 - 00:14:03.944, Speaker A: So maybe this is their way of, you know, the Van Gogh Museum's way of trying to attract younger people. And then here you have Pikachu. It's quite a statement, isn't it? I mean, it's interesting. Like, I'm not sure if it's a good or a bad thing, a neutral thing. I curious if anybody else has any thoughts on this. Like, maybe it's a sort of, I mean, look, if you're, if it look as knowing people that have kids. I don't have kids, but knowing people that have kids and they're into maybe getting into trouble playing video games all day.
00:14:03.944 - 00:14:30.402, Speaker A: If this gets them into the Van Gogh museum, so be it. So in a sense, you know, from a pragmatic, practical perspective, maybe it's a great idea if it gets kids who would never go to a Van Gogh museum into the Van Gogh museum. So maybe it's a great idea. Mark Kelly so interesting. I mean, this was on my endless list of things to do. Oh, start a nifty gateway curator thing. Kind of dropped that like, two months ago.
00:14:30.402 - 00:15:04.074, Speaker A: Or it's like far, far down on the to do list. I guess I was too late. A sad day for small publishers on Nifty Gateway. Many worked long and hard to be accepted and had further projects lined up. Yeah, about six months, maybe seven months ago, they were inviting people to start their own kind of curated spaces. From what I understood, they were sunsetted as publishers and not on the basis of dropping too often or at too low prices, nor yet on any subjective quality grounds, but on the single criterion of average sales per drop. Interesting.
00:15:04.074 - 00:15:44.714, Speaker A: So it sounds like you could have a sale for $1, but as long as you had a sale that mattered, a lot of good friends are affected, and I feel your pain. I brought many of you onto the platform as artists and was delighted that you moved on to start your own curator storefront. I voluntarily ended, voluntarily ended my weekly saucebook Sundays commitment a week ago and don't have any immediate plans to go back, though I'm still on the publisher roster. It's not very much comfort. It's scant comfort. But until the market in general and nifty gateway in particular experiences a major bounce back, I'd say you aren't missing out on anything essential, and you do better to refocus on another platform, as indeed I have. Raising a glass to better time.
00:15:44.714 - 00:16:20.934, Speaker A: So interesting. Yeah, it's an interesting thing. I mean, to me, it's kind of like, you know, the crypto, it's another example of how the crypto NFT space moves extremely fast and things can be like, we've had platforms come and go, like where you see the big launch on day one and you literally never hear from them again. I think there's at least one or maybe two, you know, examples of that which is funny, at least from what I see, which is not everything. Nick St. Pierre so I thought this was super interesting. Just from a tech front.
00:16:20.934 - 00:17:14.986, Speaker A: All you need to make a terminator spin off is some cardboard, a green screen, and a little AI. Experiments like this are mind blowing, are blowing my mind daily. So isn't this interesting? Right? Like, so you can just kind of create a green screen, create the shape, basically, and then use AI to basically put the skin on the image here. Like, it's like skinning a website, you know, like changing the skin. It's kind of like that, which is so it's kind of like, you know, how we're discussing with cider, this is a completely different way of painting. I almost want to put painting in quotes. It's kind of like here, like digital media is completely transforming our creative process in ways that are weirdly, I mean, there's nothing new about digital, but we're still kind of, at least me personally, I'm still like kind of figuring out the implications of what that means.
00:17:14.986 - 00:17:37.719, Speaker A: And I think this is like another example of that. The process is completely different. You know, there's no light design, you know, sound designer, costume designer, makeup artist, special effects person. It's like AI and cardboard box with a green screen, you know, so interesting. This is quite interesting, too. Safe Dave. Digital print of memories of the seaside on german etching paper.
00:17:37.719 - 00:18:28.534, Speaker A: Now this, just to give you a bit of background, this was made on procreate. So here you have this image, you know, digital image made on a tablet. And here, I mean, look at, I thought this looked pretty persuasive and convincing, at least from the, you know, standpoint of this video. And I think, you know, as you look at it, it seems to me this german etching paper, this very textured paper may be part of the secret because I brought it up here before, and I'm sure a lot of you, you know, recognize inkjet and maybe this isn't inkjet. I mean, what is this digital print? It's probably inkjet. Inkjet is kind of like a bit boring, generally speaking. But maybe this is a solution, you know, alpha for artists over here.
00:18:28.534 - 00:18:52.904, Speaker A: Maybe this is a solution. You have a textured piece of paper, get some really nice, say, german etching paper. All of a sudden your inkjet looks way more interesting. So I am taking note over here, this is a journal. And here, yeah, this is, I mean, look at this. So maybe it just like, maybe it's that simple, so safe. Dave, very interesting.
00:18:52.904 - 00:19:22.944, Speaker A: Looks like a german filhndelt. Ne 409 machine. Check out machine GM kittens. So we're looking at some of machines work on object. And so here is some of machines kind of airbrushed work. And you see machine kind of working here live and you see how talented and actually how talented machine is here. Like pretty good.
00:19:22.944 - 00:19:46.196, Speaker A: And just doing this live. You can't make a mistake with that on this bag. So impressive. And again, super fun. I think someone else was commenting on this in a comment, just like how fun these works by Machinar. Again, reminds me of that other artist who Zuoso x u o x o. Just kind of really fun, kind of innocent, seemingly.
00:19:46.196 - 00:20:11.734, Speaker A: Ed Marolla. So Ed Marolla found was saying how he had found a plugin called AI assisted pixel art for aseprite. Like a plugin AI plugin for aseprite. After a few hours testing the pixel lab, AI assisted pixel art for aseprite. These are my findings. Very useful if you plan to make a game. If you want stuff that looks like classic pixel art rather than, I assume, AI pixel art.
00:20:11.734 - 00:20:25.194, Speaker A: Not too into experimental stuff. Not for me. Already canceled the subscription. So there's Ed's review. Made a few cool assets, though. This was my favorite output. If you feel like I'm not 100% sane, I'll agree with you.
00:20:25.194 - 00:20:46.754, Speaker A: And so very interesting. You know, there's a video, there's a video that could get like a lot of attention. Ed Marolla trying out, you know, a plugin AI plugin pixel network. Yeah, just gold. So anyways, very interesting. Thanks for sharing the results, Ed. I will be in touch shortly.
00:20:46.754 - 00:21:09.540, Speaker A: This is awesome. I already have like a kind of a web draft website kind of on its way. Francois Gamma. I thought this was. So I really like what Francois Gamma is doing right now, showing seemingly influences from the eighties. And I assume this is accurate. Microsoft Windows clock version 1.0
00:21:09.540 - 00:21:38.884, Speaker A: 119 85. And here, I mean, it looks like a Francoise Gamma work, doesn't it? So how cool is that? And I assume that's like actually what this is. And you see these like, it's quite beautiful. So I thought that was just really cool. Into the paintings. We go into these beautiful digital art paintings already €100 here for RJ's new work, desert. Another AI trained on David Hockney.
00:21:38.884 - 00:22:08.424, Speaker A: After AI trained on David Hockney. Beautifully small at 950 x 710 pixels. This is pixel art. But as Radda has pointed out many times, infinitely scalable. And so here, another, you know what I put in short form, another spectral Hockney here, signature RJ. You know, there's something about RJ's work that it really does capture. And that's part of what's so interesting.
00:22:08.424 - 00:22:56.834, Speaker A: It really does capture the aesthetic. That kind of the aesthetic, the meaning, the signification of these kind of quiet settings with these people and their objects and their modern settings, the postures, the plants and even just like, what is this? This looks like some sort of stage set here or I don't know, just like some sort of portable area here in the middle of a desert or something. And this figure here in the suit. Kind of surreal actually. I mean, it's almost got a Paul Delvaux feel to it as well. Also in the kind of the just significance kind of shimmering off of the quietness of the work. So, you know, again, I'd call this like narrative painting.
00:22:56.834 - 00:23:29.656, Speaker A: There is an auction on it is for 100 tezos right now and there are 8 hours to go. So last one went for 650 rj on a roll. I tell you, I've been putting out tezos one of ones. I'm seeing a few one of ones, they're doing well. There's a real, like, if you're having trouble with sales, you know, put out some one of ones is what I would say. I just think there's an appetite for it right now for tezos one of ones, they're cheap ways of getting original one of one art. I'm just feeling the one of ones, I mean, rustic.
00:23:29.656 - 00:23:46.160, Speaker A: Just put out a one of one the other day. They're selling fast preseason. So here, Photoshop and a mouse. I love how rustic puts the hardware, not just the software. Zona Playa redondo. So not sure what this is. Let's take a closer look here.
00:23:46.160 - 00:24:17.984, Speaker A: Edition of ten for twelve tezos. And so just again, kind of has that rolling fields sort of feel to it that we saw in that other work that looked like a van Gogh field. Speaking of Van Gogh, the last rustic work we saw that looked like just these rolling fields of. Has that similar kind of almost stratification between the landscape here. The road divides it, though. A brilliant, beautiful work of art here. Again, probably from memory as rustic was pointing out here.
00:24:17.984 - 00:24:51.770, Speaker A: If you want to just see the beautiful, fun evolution of a digital artist, digital painter, go to rustic digital arts feed and you'll see a really interesting evolution. I think rustics kind of continues. Like this is an evolution here. Like I'm loving everything I'm seeing from rustic right now. Like it's really cool conceptually, aesthetically, you know, just very cool work. Zoom with an unusual work here. Guardian angel.
00:24:51.770 - 00:25:13.828, Speaker A: So doing something a little different here. I almost wonder if perhaps this has an AI. If this is AI, let's just check the two tags. Here it is. I didn't realize I was like, this looks different. For sum, this is an AI artwork with a big knife in front of a kind of a victory statue here. And then some columns made of leaves here.
00:25:13.828 - 00:25:44.376, Speaker A: Almost like corinthium, I think you'd call the top of a classical column is called a capital, I believe, where. And then sometimes later greek columns were corinthian with the leaves on it. This is almost like those leaves have been extended down, but that is a bridge too far. Look at the nice, kind of daly extended shadow here, psychological shadow, and how it's levitating. Nice detail. Edition of eight for fortezos from an AI artwork. Sneaks into the painting.
00:25:44.376 - 00:26:03.150, Speaker A: Amy Lilly enchanted color scapes number two. And this is going to happen more and more. There's actually, there may be another AI artwork. They're starting to spread into the other categories here. Enchanted colorscape from Amy Lilly. Interesting colors here. Hasn't put out anything since July, I don't think so.
00:26:03.150 - 00:26:23.124, Speaker A: A cool digital landscape here from Amy Lilly. And again, kind of these rolling fields, kind of pink sky, fun colors, kind of summerish. Made by Amy Lilly. Edition of 25. There are 24 left at eight tazos each. Enchanted color scapes number two. You can also get number one, and it pairs really nicely there.
00:26:23.124 - 00:26:42.044, Speaker A: Exmortal and mental noise. So a cool collab here. So, of course, mental noise does often these rabbit figures here. And maybe this is mental noise here, or somebody, a character. And I'd have to guess that inside these screens is exmortal. And so a pretty cool collab here. Looks.
00:26:42.044 - 00:27:05.852, Speaker A: Looks great, actually. So masked out and interesting, these hands coming out of the wall. The crazy, almost Cheshire cat grin sort of cat here with two faces and a phone. So all sorts of mayhem here in this beautiful artwork from mental noise and exmortal. Looks like it's sold out. It is sold out on primary. Let's quickly look at what happened here.
00:27:05.852 - 00:27:25.452, Speaker A: Look at this. Sold out at 15 tezos each for 20. So nice, 300 tezos. Louie, I thought this was hilarious. In the days before tinder, friends and family used to recommend single members to appropriate colleagues. I love the formal discussion. Now, also, another thing before we look at this.
00:27:25.452 - 00:28:06.078, Speaker A: Made with three varieties of delightful PSJ five tools devised by Santiago. So these are using some of Santiago's customized tools, three of them, in fact. And here are the two people, again, remember that using outlines as an opportunity to use different kind of, you know, to basically to mask different kind of digital textures. And here are the two people meeting and showing, hey, look at the person in the photo in the Polaroid there. I love it in these big, chunky pixels. So just kind of a hilarious subject there. Bosque Grazias, edition of five for only three tazos.
00:28:06.078 - 00:28:21.978, Speaker A: I adore this series. And what I also love about it, you see the film negative here. I mean, Bosque makes it different every time. Sometimes the film negative is dark. Sometimes it's light. Sometimes it's dark on one side, light on the other. Here it's light on both.
00:28:21.978 - 00:28:41.866, Speaker A: And then here, of course, you have the creation of Adam. Looks like the old version before they did the big restoration. I think that was in the nineties at the Vatican, in the Sistine chapel there. And other kind of pictures from the Sistine Chapel. Almost looks like a slide or something's been cut out here. Nice kind of roughness there, too. So just really cool work.
00:28:41.866 - 00:29:00.602, Speaker A: I just adore this series by bosque. Gracias, I believe, out of Argentina. Look at this. Zisia blitzkas using MS paint. And this is brand new floaters. Experimental. So back to our, you know, indie or alternative digital art.
00:29:00.602 - 00:29:22.080, Speaker A: I kind of want to classify this in that. Put that in that loose genre here and just really cool experimental work. Look at the gradient of the. Of the sky here, going sideways rather than vertical. And just all sorts of stuff. I actually brought it up big kind of a landscape here. I want to show you, like, up close, what's going on.
00:29:22.080 - 00:29:51.254, Speaker A: Like how experimental this is. And all these great textures here, combining different kinds of, you know, mark making. Maybe this is processing, like, through a kind of, you know, know, ASCII filter, let's say. But then painting over top. So playing with different kinds of mark making here. And look at this, you know, so layering, right? So just interesting experimental art here. And here you see, like, you see how actually complex this work here is.
00:29:51.254 - 00:30:10.778, Speaker A: And look at this, you know, again, very interesting trees here. I mean, this is bold, edgy, as I like to say. You know, like, it's not easy making these kinds of things, decisions. So just. Oops. So very. An interesting pink stripe at the bottom there, which changes at the end.
00:30:10.778 - 00:30:36.036, Speaker A: And look at the stars too. So fascinating orc here from. Let's just get the name again from zz bliet cas. So awesome edition of 20 for ten tezos. There are eight left, so they're selling, which is awesome. NUV 1914. LinneaL so kind of a bit more representation here.
00:30:36.036 - 00:30:58.134, Speaker A: I love the plants. I assume that's what this is. Almost like a tree here with these little red, you know, almost like little berries or something. They almost look like olives too. And then you see how blurry this is down here. And all of these great, just textures. Again, super bold stuff and just very, very interesting work, these great gradients here.
00:30:58.134 - 00:31:09.446, Speaker A: Super experimental edition of three. And let's just see. Yeah, usually going for seven tazos. DJ Kiro Vitteo. Winter wallet selling out all the time. All the work is selling out here. 1914.
00:31:09.446 - 00:31:32.304, Speaker A: Another one, romanticas. So playing with these two gradient figures here and then often there's like a tree or here there's like a sun or a moon with these massive gradient frame. Pale blue gradient frame. Just awesome. And we have one more, also sold out. Cozy Kando. And this looks like someone with a basket picking up maybe some fruit or something.
00:31:32.304 - 00:31:58.414, Speaker A: Just classic and beautiful and very cool. Also sold out at three tezos. Who are the lucky winners? Winter wallet. One of one and illusion. So that is great. This is, I think, Lulan Wiu Lulu. And we have a illustration here, digital illustration is what I'm trying to say here.
00:31:58.414 - 00:32:23.294, Speaker A: And here you see a snake and a rabbit and maybe a butterfly. So basically a surreal illustration here. Cool colors and kind of has a bit of. There's another artist who has. Who would fit really well in the same show, whose name escapes me right now, but it's kind of a cool work from Lu Lan Wu. And this is on manifold. And here it's a mint price of 0.08
00:32:23.294 - 00:32:43.412, Speaker A: ETH, and seven of 20 have been minted, so doing quite well already at 0.15 ETH, I think, or more. Seven times eight, no, half an ETH. Very good limited edition, so that's cool. Keeping wild. So also an abstract illustration here. This is called tail flip.
00:32:43.412 - 00:33:02.132, Speaker A: I think it's an abstract. And here it almost looks like paper. And you get these great pluses. And I think there's texture in here and really cool colors here and just really cool, like geometric abstraction from caving wild. And that is an addition of twelve. There are ten left at 250. And look at this sponsor.
00:33:02.132 - 00:33:22.560, Speaker A: I'm telling you, the one of ones like it just gets. I'm. I'll be surprised if this is still here. If I reloaded the page. Let me just. Shall I dare? Sometimes my mic breaks when I do this, so I'm taking the risk of it is still available. 30 tezos for a one of one smaunter work, this shoe.
00:33:22.560 - 00:33:39.544, Speaker A: And again, always an interesting perspective. Beautifully done here. Isn't it beautiful? Just beautiful. You wonder if it's a speculative shoe or based on a model. I argue this is probably a speculative imaginary shoe. And you got to love the floor too. Beautiful work.
00:33:39.544 - 00:34:07.064, Speaker A: I kind of want to pick this up. 30 tazos, one of one. Katarina create sitting in the dark too. So a brand new one from Katarina create, adding some giphysation or animation to the color here and here. Her great, almost Picasso like illustrative figures. It reminds me of Picasso's classical period. Just really fun and beautiful work here with what looks like sky in the background with some flowers.
00:34:07.064 - 00:34:31.470, Speaker A: Most juggling flowers sitting in the dark. Edition of ten for only two tezos each. And here is Jake Studios. Jake Studios is back with another, just unusual illustration here, as we see almost a photoshop canvas in the background here. This one eyed crown of thorns with a gun. And then this figure here with the balaclava. Worthless money, car on fire, mayhem.
00:34:31.470 - 00:34:51.862, Speaker A: Gotta love these kind of pixelated clouds that are illustrated here. And car. Interesting illustration. I believe this is a one of one as well, for only ten tezos. So lots of great opportunities here on tazos. Michael Macasso for one of ones like that. Sponsor $20.
00:34:51.862 - 00:35:20.460, Speaker A: Maybe I should run and get that before I upload here. Look at this. So experimenting with these gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous big pixels here, that contrast. This is Michael Macasso mech TXT. So a classical figure has been playing with text recently and just mixing it all together. And I have to say, the blue big chunky pixels bring the house down here. An awesome.
00:35:20.460 - 00:35:44.704, Speaker A: And even some dithering inside again. It's going somewhere, isn't it? This is going somewhere. Like, you gotta love when artists keep expanding, keep pushing the frontiers, you know? And the color, I mean, a beautiful combination. It's almost that violet with the neon red or neon pink. Neon pink, red. This is Sabato with a new series. Let me just go to the right up here.
00:35:44.704 - 00:36:18.726, Speaker A: First drop. That's part of marginalia. Interesting title. A series of depression drawings named after the doodles in the margins of manuscripts, named after Helio Oitisica's, say, marginal and Brazil's cinema, marginal movements. So interesting because often, what do they call that? Not gloss. Often in medieval manuscripts, they'll have the page and then on the side will, I think they call them glosses, or I think you could call it a marginalia, maybe. So interesting and bit of a depression theme here.
00:36:18.726 - 00:36:46.006, Speaker A: So maybe that's why there is the darkness in the clouds here, seeming clouds. So it looks like a deluxe paint four work, I think I remember seeing. And here's a skull with these electric flowers cycling into the eyes of this skull here. It's kind of a darker work here. I was almost thinking to myself, the, you know, Sabato is equivalent to the death and disaster series here. Maybe that's an overstatement. Yeah.
00:36:46.006 - 00:37:04.774, Speaker A: And this almost looks like mountains too. It's ambiguous and it's cool. Really interesting work here. I like the minimal color and these beautiful kind of flowers here. Sold out, I believe, at edition of 22. And, yeah, sold out for seven tezos each. So pretty awesome.
00:37:04.774 - 00:37:21.340, Speaker A: Continuing on, this was retweeted by Sabato. I thought this was super interesting. Lee Mullikin. And this is from spare game 1987. I guess it's on opensea here. Pretty interesting. Hey, kind of reminds you of Sabato a little bit.
00:37:21.340 - 00:38:03.254, Speaker A: Like. So it's, you know, because we have this discussion, like, does Keith, did Keith Haring and Warhol understand the joy that we get from, like, pixel art and this pixelation and the squares? Because it used to be a bug, not a feature, now it's a feature, you know, pixelation in art, right. At least the works that we look at here. But here you almost start to approach that kind of mentality. But this is from 1987, so it makes you wonder, like, did Lee Mulliken, like, how, you know, and what kind of screen was this seen on? Remember Xerox's comment? Like, they. It was probably smoothed out on some of these old screens. So just interesting work here.
00:38:03.254 - 00:38:34.012, Speaker A: This is Roccano, and this is on Zora. Roll the dice. And so another, like, narrative. Let me bring it up big here for you. And so, taking a few different scenes here, kind of a quick, quick shot here. Quick scene and using palm trees and office and like, what looks like a retro computer that is dithered, that is on Zora, and that is a free mint. Continuing on, mcrenders.
00:38:34.012 - 00:38:50.368, Speaker A: Also on Zora. M one times zorb mo. So in some numbers and letters there. And I think this was just listed as an open mint here. So it looks like it is a free mint here on Zora. Let me see if I can. There we go.
00:38:50.368 - 00:39:08.712, Speaker A: So just a cool work here with some beautiful textures and different kinds of pixels and everything. Beautiful. A little happy face cycling through and continuing on. Look at this rpresty. I think this is new. This almost looks like a work that could have been like, 2021, September 28, 2023. Cool work.
00:39:08.712 - 00:39:26.204, Speaker A: Beautiful abstract here. Kind of reminds you of Kandinsky a little bit, but just total pixel art. How much is this for tazos? Addition of three. Three left. Well, I better buy it before someone buys them all and burns them. I'm gonna. I need to sell a work, so I have some tezos, though.
00:39:26.204 - 00:39:47.388, Speaker A: Very cool. It's always a good idea if you're going to sell your work cheap. It's always a good idea to keep one. Very cool work here from Rpresteet, made up of abstract works made with use of a mouse and a variety of digital painting programs. Digital painting and new media. Very nice piece, stalomere, with a couple of works here. Mesolithic.
00:39:47.388 - 00:40:17.270, Speaker A: I love, you know, reminds me, this could hang in the same show as an ed Marolla when we do the anthropology sort of vibe. And here you see some paleolithic, or I should say mesolithic, warriors attacking a woolly mammoth, maybe. Perhaps a pixelated woolly mammoth. And here we see some clouds in the sky and even, like, a totemic, shamanic figure here with reindeer horns. Very cool. And a staff and everything. Pretty cool.
00:40:17.270 - 00:40:29.064, Speaker A: Pixel art. Reserve of 0.11 ETH. A one of one on foundation. And there was another one, and I believe this is being bid on. It has met its reserve here. Stalomer.
00:40:29.064 - 00:40:48.214, Speaker A: This is called Paleolithic. So of course, Paleo is the oldest, meso is the middle. And there's probably, I think there's a third one in this series, but I didn't see it yet. Probably neolithic is probably next. So paleolithic. And here you see a reference to what's often at the beginning of every art history book. This Venus.
00:40:48.214 - 00:41:40.624, Speaker A: I can't remember how you call the Venus, but these statues of these, like Venus figures, are among the oldest, among the oldest objects in art history. I mean, it's right there with cave painting, if I had to guess, maybe 40,000 years old, but maybe this is older. Cave paintings go quite far back, as much as 80,000 years old and sometimes more. And here you see the bulls. Classic iconography, a beautiful juxtaposition here, taking super modern pixel art and smashing them together with the most ancient iconography there is. And you see the people worshipping. And here is the figure, the homo erectus or homo habilis, or, you know, homo sapien.
00:41:40.624 - 00:42:05.504, Speaker A: I guess this is paleolithic. Do we have. Yeah, here with the flint, you'd call this dripping blood. And here maybe has consumed some hallucinogens or something with the eyes there and really cool skin. Anyways, very cool work. I could go on and on. Mandal speaking of cool pixel art, this came out on Twitter, I guess, yesterday.
00:42:05.504 - 00:42:43.010, Speaker A: How cool is this? So you have the cat and then you have all these masks. So, you know, I just love this because it takes such a simple, kind of cute subject matter, but then all of a sudden you're reading like, are these the masks that we wear in our daily lives? And also it has this kind of deep, sort of like that stalomere work, you know, are there deeper things in this kind of what seems like just fun pixel art? Very cool. And this is a manital work in progress. So that looks pretty fun too, with the rainbow here. And I think it's the nine of cups or the ten of cups. Let's see, four, six, eight. Looks like the ten of cups working in aseprite there.
00:42:43.010 - 00:43:04.440, Speaker A: Super cool. Coming out next Tuesday. So very impressive how Manadil is sticking with it. And it's going to finish that classic series. Green ginger cityscape elegance. Just a really cool, fun, simple pixel art work. I think we saw Green Ginger did some of those cities that we saw in the bumper cars with the music.
00:43:04.440 - 00:43:22.552, Speaker A: So here's like a more simple work. Really beautiful, though, of just a cityscape elegance. Perfect title for tezos. There are 13 left. Edition of 15 just came out. Nicholas Sassoon, crystallography in progress. So maybe a work in progress from Nicholas Sassoon.
00:43:22.552 - 00:43:42.638, Speaker A: So just very cool here. And almost like that. Remember we saw in Kareem safa that kind of cycling where it's almost like a glitch moving through the pixels. Yeah, just very interesting. Kind of looks like an Ethereum symbol here or icon. So maybe this will be released on Ethereum. And then you get this, I don't know, projection display.
00:43:42.638 - 00:44:03.794, Speaker A: Not sure what that is. So very cool, though. Beautiful. And a couple of interesting works by Haiti rocket kind of playing with the video games, almost making these scenes from video games. So here is one only an addition of four byte and it webcity 3000. So here is one. And then pairing it with this other work from behind.
00:44:03.794 - 00:44:21.304, Speaker A: So just interesting. This is an addition of six. So almost making like, you know, simulated video game scenes here. So pretty interesting to see what Haiti is up to there. And let's just see what happened there. And sold for 23 tezos each. And very small addition.
00:44:21.304 - 00:44:41.892, Speaker A: And here's Retro Manny. Speaking of video games, retro man, three dimensional helmet memorabilia. So working on a GLB. So pretty awesome. Of course, Retro Manny had to do the helmet of Retro man, so I love it. It's beautiful. This is the edition of one and is for 3333 tezos, one of one GLB model.
00:44:41.892 - 00:45:08.032, Speaker A: First available 3d model of Retroman's third dimension 3d dimensional helmet. Pretty awesome. Silva Santus need more glitch. Can't read the writing here. Bishin denetsu Zoku. So here is just more experimentation here with some glitch roms from Silva Santus, who is putting out just solidly, consistently these Nintendo glitch roms. And here's someone else who's being very prolific.
00:45:08.032 - 00:45:28.628, Speaker A: Mika Oladev, artifact number 46. And these are looking great too. So nice textures, nice light and nice everything. Just interesting, very interesting. And this is Estrell. Let me look at the name here. Estelle Flores is who this is.
00:45:28.628 - 00:46:01.384, Speaker A: And let me get some volume here. That is what I choose not to be and still am. It was pixelation too. Beautiful distortion here. What I'm stretching until it falls apart. Now this work is on Zora. I think it's a free mint.
00:46:01.384 - 00:46:14.550, Speaker A: Recorded on the sims four and processed on hydro synth. Astella flores. So cool. So Estelle is on Zora. Unreal engines. Cool title. And continuing on, Strano, the gardener.
00:46:14.550 - 00:46:32.494, Speaker A: It's never enough edition of 25. So Strano makes all sorts of kind of black and white psychedelic works is how I describe Strano. And here's just kind of a wild one here. It looks like a city that's kind of coming from the sky. The gardener. Kind of a cryptic title here. Edition of 25.
00:46:32.494 - 00:46:50.980, Speaker A: Look at the offers. Look at Stranos market. There's Xerox at 146, stateless for 500. Wow. So what a market that is impressive. Edition of 25. And looks like we'll take in 2000, maybe more amazing.
00:46:50.980 - 00:47:16.086, Speaker A: Probably more skomra tree three. I mean, a healthy market when you see that tree three. So another beautiful skomra tree here using stable diffusion. Beautiful stripes in the background. Just these original portrayals using AI. How cool is that? And kind of still get this almost like sports like user interface at the bottom, like you're watching a sports program or something. This great noise here.
00:47:16.086 - 00:47:40.954, Speaker A: But you can tell it's AI processed in AI by the shapes, actually by the texture of the shapes and the shapes themselves created with stable diffusion and diffusion diffusers. Textual inversion to Tezos edition of 20. And here's another one that Skomra just posted on Twitter here. So maybe a work in progress. So just very cool series here. You probably know the artist. This is Mister Shapeless.
00:47:40.954 - 00:48:02.636, Speaker A: Good morning, prairies. Shout out to mom in the prairies of Canada. This looks like it could be the prairies of the United States, perhaps. Are there prairies in the United States? I'm not even sure, but this almost looks like Colorado or Nevada or something. And all the kind of classic. A beautiful landscape here. Again, playing with the wanderer type theme here with the two figures at the bottom.
00:48:02.636 - 00:48:26.620, Speaker A: Kind of has a Salvador Dali feel to it as well, though. I think of that work where it looks. I think it's Dali as a kid with his dad and these long Dali shadows looking off into this massive landscape here. Very cool. Kind of a surreal work here, AI from Mister Shapeless. And here's another one from paper doll. And this is on zero one.
00:48:26.620 - 00:48:48.682, Speaker A: So Minty. I think it's the first work that paper one has minted on zero one. So a really nice painterly AI artwork here. Beautiful. Beautifully painted, as I keep saying. Look at this brushwork in here, you know, so interesting how actually zero one enables you to zoom in like this. So really nice painting here from paper doll.
00:48:48.682 - 00:49:03.586, Speaker A: I love the brushwork. I want to get better at the brushwork, AI brushwork, you know, I want to become a better AI painter, like paper doll here. And of course, you might recognize who this is. This is tuks with a super cool, surreal work. Just a GM. And I follow Tuks. That is a Twitter bug.
00:49:03.586 - 00:49:25.782, Speaker A: And look at how awesome this is. Just cool. Again, without AI, would you see this? And it's beautiful. So AI needs to be dealt with when I see works like these. And this I saw on Instagram, Christina Banban, a painter we haven't looked at before. A new discovery here. So thrilled for my first solo show happening in London since I moved out in 2018.
00:49:25.782 - 00:49:55.996, Speaker A: La Matrona, October 9 at Scarstead Gallery. I can't wait to celebrate. So a pretty interesting painter here, Christina Banban. Right? So new painter, probably a recent graduate, from what I understand. So just interesting to see what people are up to and see, you know, new talent as they come out in the art scene here in the contemporary art scene. And we've looked at Nugget brain. This is Luca Bjornston.
00:49:55.996 - 00:50:31.712, Speaker A: And there is a poster out in big booth in Barcelona at the Barcelona Art Fair. Look at how great this poster looks. This is beautiful. And there is a contrast between the brushwork here in Luca Bjornston's work. Brilliant, brilliant. I mean, grocery store making it like, I mean, this could be so easily just being seen as a pop art derivative, but it feels very fresh, doesn't it, in the way that it's done. And the contrast here between this really you know what looks like arial or helvetica text here with a nice, like, you know, really blocky and geometric and solid with the brushwork.
00:50:31.712 - 00:50:43.320, Speaker A: It looks beautiful together. Very beautiful. I think that's a Helvetica. And look at this wedge, bro. This is beautiful. This cat here. And my favorite part is maybe the color.
00:50:43.320 - 00:50:56.080, Speaker A: It almost looks like a black and white work, but can you see the color here? This piece of work? And these marks are beautiful. All the marks are beautiful. All of them. This cat on a couch. I love the subject. There's something very precious about this work. This one.
00:50:56.080 - 00:51:07.782, Speaker A: Really cat on a mid century couch. Brilliant work. And you see, like, this one just, like, nailed it. Nailed. And here's my friend Patrick Turbojan. Bon. Super frog.
00:51:07.782 - 00:51:35.778, Speaker A: And I was thinking, you know, if Patrick had Pepe on here, he would be like. I'm sure he would go, like, viral there, you know? So here he is in Korea at a performance. Super frog performance by Patrick Chambon in South Korea. So I think he's there right now, hilariously so. Yeah. So there is the frog. So I don't think it's a reference to Pepe, but there may be an opportunity I may have to talk to him about that.
00:51:35.778 - 00:51:42.314, Speaker A: Thank you for all the support and everything. I hope you guys have a great weekend. Thank you for everything. Until next time. Take care.
