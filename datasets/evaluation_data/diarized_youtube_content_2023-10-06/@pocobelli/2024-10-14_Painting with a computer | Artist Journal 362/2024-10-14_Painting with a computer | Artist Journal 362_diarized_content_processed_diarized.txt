00:00:05.360 - 00:00:29.253, Speaker A: Moving as fast as we can. Sailing at a good clip. But we're moving so fast, I'm actually running on the ship is what I see on a treadmill. I'm not sure what the image means, but. Welcome back. It is a new week, a new dawn, new images, new art, new artists. A one of a kind show broadcast around the world.
00:00:29.253 - 00:00:47.213, Speaker A: Welcome back and thank you for all the support. My co creators. You are my co creators, my collaborators. Thank you everybody. Welcome back. Artist Journal October 14, 2024. Soon it's going to be 2025.
00:00:47.213 - 00:01:14.283, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Poke Belly. You know, I was at the grocery store and I saw Christmas. I saw Christmas cookies, Christmas decorations, and I thought, wow, we're not even halfway through October. Germany loves Christmas. Of course, I am in Berlin, Germany here, if I haven't mentioned that. And they love Christmas, let me tell you. Grocery store, it was like a week ago, actually, I already was seeing Christmas.
00:01:14.283 - 00:01:42.584, Speaker A: So all to say, 2025 is approaching fast. So I thought we could start out here kind of on a humorous note a little bit. But I have to say, I love this work. Like it actually was the work. I mean, many works jump out at me, but this one, I saw it and I just kind of wanted it to be the opener. Moto Hero Hayakawa. We've seen a ton of Moto hero Hayakawa or Moto583, I believe it is.
00:01:42.584 - 00:02:05.595, Speaker A: Yeah, Moto583. We've seen works like this before. A spectacular illustrator. It's tempting to call surreal, but it's, you know, there's. They sometimes call it classic surrealism and neo surrealism, I think is what you'd call. There's kind of a, you know, we talked about a new wave of pixel art. There's, I guess, a lot of new waves of things.
00:02:05.595 - 00:03:01.375, Speaker A: You know, one of the new waves we've seen or a return to is surrealism. Now, I don't know if I would consider Moto Hero. You know, he's not a classic surrealist in the sense of being influenced by Sigmund Freud necessarily, and trying to kind of put together these, you know, inner landscapes, shall we say Here it seems to be, and I'm just thinking out loud, speculating another artist I don't know too much about. But we've been looked at a ton of Motohiro's work and this is more of just a direct juxtaposition. Like if you see here, you know, okay, let's put a head. Put a head on some legs and apologies, I'M a little under the weather here, so if my voice is. However, it is just so, you know, you know, here another.
00:03:01.375 - 00:03:45.521, Speaker A: Like, it's almost. It's a blunt juxtaposition. Here's another one, right? So it's got a different feel than surrealism, than a kind of Dali, like, shall we say a Salvador Dali, like double image, Right? The paranoiac image where you think you're seeing one thing, but your brain, you know, where one thing is being portrayed, you know, it's just a cigar, but maybe you're starting to see something else, you know, where A doesn't equal A, A equals B. Manifest content, latent contents, the surface, the underlying, getting to the reality, appearance in reality. All these things. This doesn't seem to be that. This is, weirdly, I'd say, just a bit more playful.
00:03:45.521 - 00:04:19.175, Speaker A: You could argue it has a bit of a surrealist aspect to it, but it, again, it's a bit of a different beast. And again, it doesn't seem to be trying to. There doesn't seem to be something kind of. You could argue surrealism. I would argue to a certain degree, as a philosophy or a philosophy can be distilled from surrealism. And I'd always point to Ballard. If you want to hear that philosophy in about three pages, go to the introduction to Crash.
00:04:19.175 - 00:04:40.971, Speaker A: The French introduction to Crash. There's a couple. One's longer, one's shorter. Sometimes they don't put the introduction at all, which I find kind of interesting. Why would you not put the introduction, if you're a major publisher, to that kind of weird? Hey. Anyway, so again, this. This seems to be of a different order.
00:04:40.971 - 00:05:06.325, Speaker A: This is kind of, I want to say, a little bit more playful and. Yeah, so just as a kind of, you know, here we have, like, monsters going in. Again, we have these bizarre. We could say a very kind of irrational type image. You know, for example, you know, these squirrels kind of moving in and out of a skull. Delightfully playful. Delightfully imaginative.
00:05:06.325 - 00:05:36.625, Speaker A: I mean, you get the sense that if Moto Hero didn't make these images, no one would have made these images. Moto583, Moto Hero on Instagram. So let's just take a quick look at this opening image. I guess it was the fact that there is YouTube I kind of found interesting. I mean, what. What spoke to me, why did I want to start with this, for example? And I think it does jump out. I think it's the fact that YouTube was used in a very interesting way.
00:05:36.625 - 00:06:06.665, Speaker A: But I'm still back to this idea. Of the newspaper, the imagination, this thing that's on the side of the street. I think this would turn people's heads. I think they'd be like, what is this? Right? In a sense there is a recontextualization, is another way of framing this of say YouTube and the YouTube logo. This isn't on a website, this is on a kind of billboard or perhaps like a drive in movie theater screen. And you have this huge logo. Interesting.
00:06:06.665 - 00:06:55.877, Speaker A: And there it seems to be on a beach, this graphite on paper drawing, a remote control. And actually I think the title is Holiday posted to Instagram, by the way, A bowl of fruit. And here is the person again, almost like a beach lounge chair. Not even perfectly, you know, the perspective even kind of a little off kilter, perhaps the line going a little over and interestingly. And then you get this, what seems like a baby perhaps with like diapers that are too big and oh wait, that's not a head, that looks like a ball or something, a balloon, I don't know. And there is the person looking off into the logo. So there's something very delightful in these works.
00:06:55.877 - 00:07:18.887, Speaker A: And a final thing, just on the technical side of things, there aren't too many clues, but you see how this. So they're an Motohimo. Let me just make sure I'm getting the name right. Motohimo Hayakawa. Moto Hero. Sorry, Moto Hero. Hayakawa is an illustrator, as we're going to see.
00:07:18.887 - 00:07:58.527, Speaker A: We're going to look at the bio in a second here. But just final little parts here I want to sort of highlight which are these little lines here. And actually specifically over here, do you see it where the baby is? You see there's almost these light lines or the foot, it's like it's been blocked in a bit or there's been a little bit of. Even the tail here that there's just a light sort of illustration you see here and then kind of, you know, I think in traditional drawing and painting, like 19th century academic style, you would block things in. And of course that's how most you do a light sketch first. That's generally how most people do it. You do a light sketch first and then you put in darker lines.
00:07:58.527 - 00:08:36.421, Speaker A: Makes perfect sense. So that seems to be going on here. And I actually love this kind of ambiguous table here or blanket, whatever it is at the end with this overly large remote, but it doesn't matter, right? And the dog, so all just kind of cool and not even bothering with the background here. But seems to be on a beach, but could be concrete for all we know. Assuming a beach because of the swimsuit, right? And then the legs even crossed over here like so. Just a really interesting artist. Let's read a bit out of Japan.
00:08:36.421 - 00:09:07.671, Speaker A: So kind of, kind of in our Japan phase here. Last couple of days, last couple of shows. Yamaguchi, Japan Moto Hero. Moto Hero Hayakawa and I'll just read a little bit here since we've looked at a ton of Moto Hero's work, but we haven't seen. But we haven't really known anything about them. Lurid monsters, clanking robots and 70s inspired sci fi heroes sporting kitsch outfits and laser guns. Motohiro Hayakawa's comic style battle scenes are places where the action never stops.
00:09:07.671 - 00:09:42.435, Speaker A: Thrilling invitations to step inside and join the fun. And indeed there is kind of a comic art style to the execution. Born in Japan, Hayakawa studied at the region's technical institute at Yamaguchi Prefecture before going on to work in illustration and comics. So another, you know, I think of Limbo there. Another comic illustrator. Major influences include the science fiction adventures and cartoons of his childhood. In particular Space Sheriff, a cult Japanese TV show aired in the early 80s.
00:09:42.435 - 00:10:25.749, Speaker A: Isn't this interesting, right? Because sometimes I talk about, you know, what I kind of loosely, but not so loosely called the second generation of digital art and how important, among other things, video games were to that aesthetic that I think we could consider that is very prominent now, at least what we see on the blockchain. You know, there is a certain kind of this isn't net art, so to speak. I think do actually someone sent me a like hopefully I remember Next show. There's some really cool net art thing I want to show you. There were too many things to show as usual here. Let's continue. The US cartoonist and illustrator Gary Panter, who I have heard of, but I do not remember.
00:10:25.749 - 00:10:53.695, Speaker A: Shall we do a quick look on Gary Panter? Okay, Jimbo. I worked in a comic store, so I'm quite. I feel like I've definitely seen this before, but this is pretty underground. Gary Panter. And you can see, you know, a loose, you know, connection here between the artists. I mean, very loose here. There's a little bit more kind of ink I want to say, and a little bit more, I want to say, cross hatching.
00:10:53.695 - 00:11:42.375, Speaker A: The US cartoonist and illustrator Gary Panter is also cited by Hayakawa together with a range of musical inspirations from pop to punk. So a very modern influence. Buffet of influence for lack of Better term. Using a mixture of different textures and techniques, fine lines, jelly like forms and fluorescent color, Hayakawa creates imagined scenes charged with energy and narrative flair. Since 2009, he was exhibited in galleries across Tokyo, including at the Morishita Cultural center and is a member of Tokyo's Illustrator Society. He held a show in Madrid in 2013 and his comic book Laser Beam was released by the French publishing house Le Dernier Cri, the Last Cry in the same year. So interesting kind of background.
00:11:42.375 - 00:12:21.695, Speaker A: I don't usually go that far into the background, but I just know so little and we've looked at so much that I think it is worth our while here. So just a few examples as well on this website Collection Solo and maybe that is some the Madrid from the Madrid show. Not sure. And there we see just other examples of Hayakawa's work here. As you see this kind of sci fi. So very, very interesting and original artist as you can see here. And even these little wars and everything, there's something just again super delightful.
00:12:21.695 - 00:12:41.603, Speaker A: And when I see the work, I would not be sad at all to put this on my wall. Like I'd be quite excited. So just a great. Another great talent here. Let's see what else I brought up here. As this loads up here. A little bit of a late start here.
00:12:41.603 - 00:13:00.615, Speaker A: So getting. Here we go. Here are some. So we've seen again we've seen this in the past, Turkey on the semi truck and these huge works here. Let me see. Yeah, sort of having a little bit of an issue. Uh, let's bring up just a couple of these paintings here.
00:13:00.615 - 00:13:22.107, Speaker A: Uh here as you see here. And unfortunately. So this. And let me do this. This is probably the full painting. And then you see up close here all the little details of this very interesting artist. So again that you saw that collection Solo was there.
00:13:22.107 - 00:13:54.355, Speaker A: So. So just an interesting artist and yeah unfortunately having issues loading things up properly here. But another. You see here the surrealism and the fun of this artist. I guess the final point I'd want to make here is a hard artist to place. You know, again you try and say surrealism kind of, but not really. At least not what I'd call classic surrealism.
00:13:54.355 - 00:14:17.423, Speaker A: Maybe you could call it neocerrealist. But again it doesn't seem to have that kind of psychological Freudian angle in the juxtapositions. This seems to be juxtaposition more. I mean it does. It's. There is something psychological about putting hard juxtapositions like that. And you know, the effect as we see here.
00:14:17.423 - 00:14:52.177, Speaker A: So to a certain degree, we do have to call this, you know, surreal. But, you know, this isn't Magritte either, if you know what I'm saying. This is like with a lot more humor. And although there is humor in Magritte, of course, and just like it's. It's hard to place. It feels very now, to a certain degree. And what I love about it, you know, finally here is, remember Ballard bringing it back to Ballard, who we're just mentioning in the Context of Crash.
00:14:52.177 - 00:15:19.931, Speaker A: J.G. ballard, the author, the Naive. This idea of the naive. And he was celebrating, you know, William Burroughs, Andy Warhol as being kind of naives of sorts. You know, these. You know, what he'd call innocent or also honest. And again, we were thinking in terms of sad Marquis de Sade as being just kind of ruthlessly honest with whatever.
00:15:19.931 - 00:15:44.885, Speaker A: Putting whatever he could put on, probably trying to be outrageous at the same time. But again, this kind of being. This idea of honesty and naivete, quote unquote, as a naivete being a positive quality, not. It's often used as kind of a negative. Right? Oh, it's naive. It doesn't know what it's doing. This seems to have kind of a certain degree of the naive in a good way.
00:15:44.885 - 00:16:13.277, Speaker A: In the sense that you don't get the sense that Moto Hero. And let me just make sure, again, forgive the. You don't get the sense that the artist is. Just want to get their name right. That Moto Hero is. You get the sense that Moto Hero is really, as Ballard would put it, pursuing his own obsessions. Right.
00:16:13.277 - 00:16:33.567, Speaker A: Just being true to the things that make him happy. It's now what I feel like I was. It was in the Reuben or the guy, the Rick Rubin, he's got the famous book. And I never. I still haven't listened to it. People say I need to listen to it. But there's a book on creativity.
00:16:33.567 - 00:17:04.995, Speaker A: I believe the name of the producer is Rick Rubin, if I'm not mistaken. And I remember seeing a video, I think it was on Instagram, maybe a clip where it was this idea that, you know, make art for yourself. Don't make art for the audience. Make it where you love it. And then the audience will. Basically, the things that resonate with you will likely resonate with the audience. And that also can be factored into this idea of the naive, so to speak.
00:17:04.995 - 00:17:59.353, Speaker A: Again, just kind of following without overly worrying about the external world, what works for you, and pursuing it and pursuing that logic is because in a sense what we see here, finally with Moto Hero is a kind of logic, right? I mean, there is a logic to these images. There is a consistency where if I looked at this for the first time, I'd say, I think I know who the artist is. Right. There is a visual logic, so to speak. There is a consistency in the sense of a way of thinking. So I don't want to go too far here. But you see how radical some of these works are and just kind of weird and delightful as you see with these kind of detail shots of the little soldiers and all of the.
00:17:59.353 - 00:18:11.875, Speaker A: And remember the burgers. I think that's where I started actually was with. But not sure. Yeah. And then these spectacular work here. You see a great sense of color here as well. Just so.
00:18:11.875 - 00:18:36.435, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, just a really interesting. What is this called? Blank Gallery Tokyo. And the translation? I guess this is it. Okay, so it's underneath. So not sure what the title is on it. Very cool. So just to get us started in another unusual direction out of Japan, thank you everybody for purchasing this edition of 15 here.
00:18:36.435 - 00:18:54.419, Speaker A: Ancient Greece's Legacy put out a couple of works on the weekend. Looking forward, the plan is to be a lot more prolific here. So thanks everybody. This was gone in 15 minutes and even got a couple of secondary sales there. So thank you everybody for the support and you know who you are. You are here. And big thank you.
00:18:54.419 - 00:19:15.551, Speaker A: And also on this one, part of the Promoted Stories series. And yeah, thank you so much. And again, that probably went in an hour, hour and a half. So huge thank you to everybody for that. Thanks for supporting my art collecting, my ability to art collect. Let's continue. Son of Steg.
00:19:15.551 - 00:19:53.049, Speaker A: So a longtime viewer actually of this program and someone I've known on the scene here, artist and on Tezos at least since I think I first. I was looking into my messages way back in January of 20. Was it maybe December 2022 or January 2023? Son of Stag. So we're going to hear what Son of Stag has to say. Has been closely following this scene makes art as well. Just hear really from someone in the community here, Son of Stag, of what is going on, how Son of Stag sees things. So that's on this Wednesday with Runtune continuing on.
00:19:53.049 - 00:20:11.199, Speaker A: Thank you all for the support here. Just awesome on YouTube. Got some comments this time. Frank Steim years. Hey, Poco. Just thought I'd mention, if you didn't know already on the post with the torch and the heron. So that was Hermipe that we Were discussing and heron.
00:20:11.199 - 00:20:31.875, Speaker A: Sorry with the torch and heron. It was a heron. That's the name of the bird sticker physicals. The characters next to them are monsters and characters from Elden Ring, which I've never heard of. Maybe vaguely. Well worth checking out the artwork from the game. So it's a game or any fromsoftware game or any from software, I guess is the name of the company.
00:20:31.875 - 00:20:42.087, Speaker A: Thank you for that and very interesting and I had no idea. So I appreciate that. Pippi Universal. Thanks Poco for the feature. Keep on with the show. Abrazzo. Thank you.
00:20:42.087 - 00:21:01.185, Speaker A: Pp Great to hear from you and wonderful work. Hashboy. Really interesting trend. Thank you. Neopixels indeed. Yeah, just as there's neocerrealism, perhaps there are neopixels as I was mentioning. And it almost, you know, dovetails back to what we were discussing with Moto Hero.
00:21:01.185 - 00:21:19.647, Speaker A: This idea of new traditions. Right. Like, and it's interesting. Like again, like Moto Hero, you think of the energy, you think of Hermipe. Someone wrote a great comment. I think it's in the X comments. Well give.
00:21:19.647 - 00:21:48.575, Speaker A: We'll come back to this idea of how the Internet and artists coming up through the Internet will likely overwhelm the traditional power structures that exist in the art scene. Probably. Mama. This is funny. Tol show Malvidar. So awesome show once again. Time continuing, continuing again.
00:21:48.575 - 00:22:01.155, Speaker A: Something like that. That is German for you, my friends. Tola show Malvida. Thank you mamadus. Ow. 2201. Awesome to hear from you and thank you for the comments also on X.
00:22:01.155 - 00:22:11.735, Speaker A: So again, thank you. Beautiful. Huge response. Seventeen bookmarks there. Yeah. So really nice response there. Thank you.
00:22:11.735 - 00:22:28.459, Speaker A: Ilay. Oh no, I wasn't wanting the video to be scary in any way. Maybe I'll delete. And I said please don't delete or leave it. I thought about how to work on the screenshot of the filtered screenshots and wrote a song. If I don't place a song to a video, it's often not seen on the timeline. And thought some of the glitch effects were really cool.
00:22:28.459 - 00:22:45.839, Speaker A: No, it was hilarious. And when I said it was terrifying, I was kind of saying it in half half in jest. But I think you could. You probably relate if you start seeing this. I mean it's. Imagine putting yourself in AI and you're starting to see the result of like an AI version of this show. It's kind of terrifying.
00:22:45.839 - 00:23:07.799, Speaker A: Right? But hilarious and interesting are the parts that I never perhaps should have mentioned there. So thank you for that. I mean, I love all kind of celebrations in whatever form of this show and it's totally appreciated, you know, put in the time and everything. So thank you, Jan Lucas Migone. Yes, sir. Okay, awesome. Maybe referring to a new wave of pixel art.
00:23:07.799 - 00:23:23.957, Speaker A: Indeed. We got a few comments on that. People liking it. Bugged. Thank you for maintaining this positive underground art community. It feels like a virtual home. And indeed, yeah, you can put underground in quotes because how underground is it? You know, it's kind of an interesting question.
00:23:23.957 - 00:23:45.065, Speaker A: I guess it is. I, you know, I call it the Visual Arts Underground. I, you know, when you look at the amount of people on Tezos collecting, you see so many familiar names. It's not like there are 10,000 collectors there who you. There's always someone different. Like it feels like it is. I think we can still call it underground.
00:23:45.065 - 00:23:59.081, Speaker A: For how much longer is an interesting question. Perhaps forever, perhaps not. Thank you for the good vibes. It feels like a virtual home. Very nice of you to say that. Bugged. Welcome to the hearth.
00:23:59.081 - 00:24:23.353, Speaker A: Elven. Yo. Great talking about King's Quest. I made this piece two and a half years ago and that appears to be the figure from King's Quest, I believe so. How hilarious is that? So someone else hearing of King's Quest, if you can read this, you are still early hilarious. Lena Gordiva. Finally, I'm on trend referring to pixel art and a new wave of pixel art.
00:24:23.353 - 00:24:39.923, Speaker A: Thanks a lot. Your speech is gorgeous. Thank you, Lena. Very nice to hear from you. And thank you for posting because. And again, in community is another place to post like this was a discovery and we'll see another work by Lena in the pixel art section. Super interesting.
00:24:39.923 - 00:25:11.939, Speaker A: Super interesting art. So thank you for posting and bringing that to my attention. Oros Macris. This was the comment I was just thinking about a couple of minutes ago. The quality and originality able to be provided by isolated, hardened guerrilla artists all over the world will be so huge. No physical art place, Paris, Berlin, London or else or otherwise will be able to compete with the diversity and quality provided. Indeed.
00:25:11.939 - 00:25:47.453, Speaker A: You know, I was thinking to myself after that last show, and of course they were trying. The art newspaper was suggesting or speculating and saying, is London the new home of digital art, the digital art capital? And I thought to myself, you know, if anywhere is the capital, like the Internet is the digital art capital, if there is an art capital, you know, it's. Don't you think? Like, I mean, so, yeah, like, I mean, it's kind of. Yeah. So I totally agree. Thank you for the comment. Couldn't agree more.
00:25:47.453 - 00:26:01.501, Speaker A: As I wrote here, Braindead. It makes me feel grand to see more pixel artists on web3 every day. So adding to the sentiment here. Pedro Jose, Coffee Artist journal. Awesome. Cheers my friends. Big coffee.
00:26:01.501 - 00:26:09.967, Speaker A: Cheers. Yudho, great insight. Thank you very. What a wonderful crowd here. Wonderful community. Thank you everybody. Mind I.
00:26:09.967 - 00:26:27.375, Speaker A: Oh no, I'm never going to catch up. You will get time around November 14th, 15th. I actually get on a plane so it'll be sporadic. So you'll have time to catch up, my friend. Thank you. Our milk make pixes dope again together. Let's go.
00:26:27.375 - 00:26:43.391, Speaker A: So awesome. Our milk again. Prominent pixel artists. Andre. These are badass. And great to see Andre's Summer Blues as many of you who have been around for a couple of years will recognize that name. Where has Andre been? It looks like Andre's back, so that is exciting.
00:26:43.391 - 00:27:08.647, Speaker A: Looking forward to seeing new works. It's Orena. RJ's art is incredible. So how great is that? Great to hear Itzel and glad it resonates. And yeah, I've been showing RJ's art. Been a huge fan from very early on. Some of my favorite works are those early hand pastiches of what is the name of that artist who does.
00:27:08.647 - 00:27:21.055, Speaker A: Who does that famous coffee shop. The name escapes me right now. It's on the tip of my brain. I can feel it. The neuron just needs to connect here. But yeah, so anyways, RJ's awesome. Absolutely.
00:27:21.055 - 00:27:34.075, Speaker A: Oros Makris. Great show. Very informative and on point. Enjoyed your comments about the London Scene article. Wanting to be central in a decentralized system. Indeed. So thank you, Oris for that and great to hear.
00:27:34.075 - 00:27:57.237, Speaker A: Yeah, I think I was feeling a little edgy that day, so a little bit more combative than maybe normal. But I'm glad that resonated and it just. Yeah, I mean it did kind of. Here we go again, you know. Yeah, it felt very. Yeah, let's get the. You know, this show is not political, but I do.
00:27:57.237 - 00:28:17.165, Speaker A: But I tell people like I. Because it's just not the purview of this show to get into left, right politics and all that sort of thing. It's. It's not. It's not the purview of the show, it's not the editorial, but I do. But I tell people who I ask, who I talk to, friends, whatever, where this comes up. I do tell them.
00:28:17.165 - 00:28:59.855, Speaker A: I do look at the power structure of the art scene, so to speak, and the establishment, and it's almost kind of like, you know, I'm not like a big Marxist critique guy, but there is like. I mean, I was almost thinking it's kind of like power, you know, looking at the power structure, it's almost like a kind of Marxist critique. And I am definitely not. I am, as I've said here, I mean, the closest I ever get to politics is yay, free market. Right? And so anyways, so that is how I like to tackle it here. You know, let's look at the. What seems to be kind of going on, so to speak, from a power and establishment point of view.
00:28:59.855 - 00:29:17.469, Speaker A: And not even that much like just, you know, but it is kind of a fun way to look at. Anyways, let's continue here. Mooncat. Cyber dudes are the new phenomena in on chain encryption. Well, I'm glad to hear. Thank you Mooncat, for sharing and beautiful artwork. R Milk.
00:29:17.469 - 00:29:29.029, Speaker A: Pixels are absolutely ruling right now. It's a new wave. Check out this gentleman's show. My works have been featured in the last three episodes. Awesome. So again, thank you R Milk for posting. And check this out.
00:29:29.029 - 00:29:58.365, Speaker A: So our Milk posted and not contacted. But words are failing here, my friends. And tagged is the word I'm trying to say. Hermipe. And Hermipe wrote this beautiful thing talking to Armilk. The trust we have in those who have supported us over a long period of time has led to stable production efforts. Apart from the theme or motive of the work, I feel a sense of solidarity as if we are creating a piece together.
00:29:58.365 - 00:30:17.825, Speaker A: So a little bit from Hermipe. And also retweeted the show after Armilk tagged him in a post with the show. So thank you, Armilk. That is hilarious. And the world got a little bit smaller there with Hermipe. And look at this finally on Hermipe. Look at this.
00:30:17.825 - 00:30:34.415, Speaker A: The skateboard we're seeing being developed. Just super duper cool. And everything we're seeing there. So super interesting. Let's go through the community quickly here. Chris War, thank you for posting. What do we have the.
00:30:34.415 - 00:30:58.763, Speaker A: Look at this. Very psychedelic, very psychedelic visuals. So probably made by Chris War the music and probably Lajo X the visuals, if I had to guess. Thank you for posting. Super interesting. And it disappeared on me. Thank you, Rosecho.
00:30:58.763 - 00:31:11.801, Speaker A: I guess these were just posted here since I loaded up the tab. Very cool. Work in progress. Look at that. Eight Bedoux, right? Okay. So yeah, that is exciting. And it turned out pretty good, didn't it? Continuing.
00:31:11.801 - 00:31:25.129, Speaker A: Ernesto Ash, thank you for posting. Brand new digital painting and I believe that's on Tezos. Awesome. And there's Andre Summer Blues. Awesome to hear from you. Awesome illustrator. Kind of psychedelic illustrator.
00:31:25.129 - 00:31:42.081, Speaker A: Looking forward to seeing what happens here. Retro Manny finally completed the Akira Drift tribute. Sold out on Primary. That is. I don't know if I've ever seen the Akira movie. I think I have, but it's literally been 20, 25 years, so. Very cool.
00:31:42.081 - 00:32:00.835, Speaker A: But yeah, that does look very homage to Katsuhiro Otomo. So all sorts of celebrations of Japanese culture on this show in the last couple of shows, which is pretty exciting. Skull takes buying digital art in the before times. Fascinating. Thank you for posting this. It's super interesting. I brought up a couple of.
00:32:00.835 - 00:32:13.959, Speaker A: I brought up a couple of tabs or at least one on this. So we're going to take a closer look in a future tab here. Thank you. Very interesting. Ugodichi Le Dance. And actually I brought this up in the show too. Thank you for posting.
00:32:13.959 - 00:32:32.721, Speaker A: Doing quite well there on Twitter. 369. Thank you for posting. Creating is an innovation to express, connect, reflect and to explore both ourselves in the world. But to me it is one kind of a therapy. It is healing me and I wish my creations healed you too. And there is something very soothing about this work.
00:32:32.721 - 00:32:47.677, Speaker A: When you say it's healing, I. I can kind of feel it. It is very soothing. Psycho Futurists now doing all the signs of the zodiac. Totally awesome. Amazing productivity out of Psycho. Futuristic Primitive Drip.
00:32:47.677 - 00:33:02.869, Speaker A: Thank you for posting. Very cool. Kind of has a. Looks like the David statue with some drawing on it. Texadelic. Thank you for posting. And very cool kind of print and kind of drawing ink and print kind of look to it.
00:33:02.869 - 00:33:17.551, Speaker A: Very cool. Vincent Law. Cool abstract. Thank you for posting. Look at all the work that is posted. Greg, Nick Shumika posting a work. And so yeah, so I brought up actually a couple of works already by Greg later in the show.
00:33:17.551 - 00:33:33.095, Speaker A: So we will see that. And there's Mamadou Sow. I'm excited to announce my collaboration with Times, who I believe is Santiago, a secret artist now. And there is Santiago Times Sau. So. And it looks like a Santiago work. So that is coming on October 14th, which is today.
00:33:33.095 - 00:33:45.459, Speaker A: Gavin Shapiro night check. And so all sorts of action here in the community. 305. Thank you for posting. 2002. And I believe this is the last one. This on Zora.
00:33:45.459 - 00:34:12.597, Speaker A: Very cool and cool abstract. And here's Teganhoff and turning it into what looks like here, kind of a digital artwork, kind of a digital pastiche. Taking the two figures interestingly. And here Is our link from yesterday here also. So big shout out to Neon Monk for sending this to me. Guess who's on the blockchain. But not for a while.
00:34:12.597 - 00:34:46.094, Speaker A: Hermipe. So super interesting, isn't it? And you can still buy. It's not cheap for one eth. You can still buy some Hermipe works, but you can get them. And so as Neon Monk was telling me, maybe if, maybe Hermipe could be, you know, persuaded to come back on if they start making sales again. Because yeah, some great, great works here and actually did quite well. I mean sold looks like 6 or 7 ETH here, maybe more 8 ETH.
00:34:46.094 - 00:35:16.465, Speaker A: So that adds up. So very cool. And this was interesting too. Just on that front I showed you, I guess Mackenzie, if I'm not mistaken, solo show. This was also posted by Hermipe. So just kind of interesting. And it looks like on October 4th to October 14th, if I'm not mistaken, solo exhibition Pulse into Flow at the Meteor Club, which looks like it's in Japan.
00:35:16.465 - 00:35:42.207, Speaker A: So very interesting. Kind of different feel again, kind of looks like manual pixel art. Really cool in its own style. And here's a physical. And this one, McKenji's solo exhibition. A calm picture and a humid story. It's comfortable, so just interesting and fascinating to see.
00:35:42.207 - 00:36:05.655, Speaker A: This must be done by laser, but I do not know, I still need to try laser engraving or laser cutting. I assume it's laser cutting. And here is perhaps part of that show there too. So super interesting. Enigmatic on super rare. How cool is that? So then the. The ASCII is coming to Super Rare next week.
00:36:05.655 - 00:36:32.545, Speaker A: Now I think an Enigmatress already had a super rare. But I could be wrong. But I thought they were already on super rare. But I guess the ASCII is going to come to super rare because that seemed to me like it was a recent kind of development or innovation that ending mattress a breakthrough. And so now we're gonna bring those works to Super Rare even love. This almost looks like an old printer, inkjet printer or something. Put these letters together.
00:36:32.545 - 00:36:41.365, Speaker A: Super cool. Let us continue. Check this out. So I don't know what to make of this. You tell me. Look at this. So strange thing.
00:36:41.365 - 00:37:01.827, Speaker A: Lamborghini and Urus. So that is on the stories there. So straight. There's a strange thing work. I don't know if Lamb. It kind of looks like Lamborghini is working with Strange Thing. Coming soon by Strange Thing.
00:37:01.827 - 00:37:22.665, Speaker A: So who knows if that is actual Lamborghini or Strange things playing with Lamborghini. Not sure. But Pretty cool. And Ranixsteer. Okay, so we're looking at art coins, right? Looks like Ranixsteer's art coin did pretty well. Look mom, my art has a chart. So there is Ranix Deer's art coin.
00:37:22.665 - 00:37:41.215, Speaker A: Kind of interesting. You never know. Maybe these crypto ideas actually turn into something I'll continue to. If anything else interesting comes my way or feel free to post in the community if you see something. I'm open minded on this. Let's continue. James Bloom, also known as Crash Blossom.
00:37:41.215 - 00:38:21.155, Speaker A: People saying Freeze was boring. But we went to Thomas Dane, Josh Lilly, Gisela, Captain Fritz Street Societe and they have a gallery in if it's the same Societe in Berlin which is really great and saw some great art. My daughter got free stuff and was even offered to hang her drawing in one of the booths. And what I actually think was interesting is so interest just to feed into our picture of the contemporary art scene. People saying frieze was boring and just the market in general. So I actually find that pretty interesting. So just kind of more, you know, circumstantial evidence as we try and figure out what's actually going on.
00:38:21.155 - 00:38:50.955, Speaker A: This is interesting. So Katya Kazakhina, the Art Detective the Met Sienna blockbuster has priceless loans. How did it come together? So there is a major. It's almost worth, you know, traveling to New York for is what I thought in my head. Like I don't know, I can't afford it. It's really. I've done so much traveling but this to like in my mind this is a show that is almost worth like you travel for.
00:38:50.955 - 00:39:17.017, Speaker A: There's a major show at the Met till January 25. And so at on Sienna, on Siena Art. Right. And I'll just read you a couple of paragraphs here because I found it quite significant. Catchy. Casukina, October 11. While the contemporary art tribe was in London for freeze week, I found myself magnetically drawn to a much earlier chapter of art history here in New York.
00:39:17.017 - 00:39:55.245, Speaker A: And again, it's kind of like a subtle dig at like I'm like translation. I'm way more interested in what's going on here at this medieval art show than I am at Frieze Week. And I would so just again, just. I'm not trying like just circumstantial evidence that I think we should note as we continue here. The magnet was a seductively titled new exhibition, the rise of painting 1300-1350 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. So that's at the Met. So that looks like a major show this week had a similar feeling.
00:39:55.245 - 00:40:28.781, Speaker A: There are 95 treasure there. Inside darkened rooms, 95 treasures glow. Ranging from a jaw dropping altarpiece brought to New York from a church in Arezo, Italy to a 7 inch carved ivory Virgin Mary. The undisputed star of the exhibition is Ducho de Bos Bon Insigna, a Sienese master of the start of the 14th century. I imagine that's El Duccio is who they're referring to. Better known as Ducho. He was a rebel, tax evader and a big deal painter.
00:40:28.781 - 00:41:08.945, Speaker A: Put simply, he was the bridge between the flatness of Byzantine icon painting and the perspective of the early renaissance. Finally, in 2004, the Met shelled out $45 million for an 11 by 8 inch gold ground panel Madonna and Child. The most that the nation's biggest museum had ever paid for an artwork. Finally, the first slide in an Art History 101 course is a Ducho. He was one of the founders of Western art. Philippe de Montebello, the Mets director, told the New York Times back then so and has 13 paintings by the artists. So this looks like unbelievable show, doesn't it? And you see the color.
00:41:08.945 - 00:41:40.863, Speaker A: This looks like just great another one. And of course we've seen Ben Davis before. I could spend a million hours in the Met's weird and wonderful Sienese art show. Siena, the rise of painting 1300-1350 is more than just a prehistory of the Italian Renaissance. Indeed. And just again, more just praise for this show. If I had to come up with a hook to justify writing about the rise of painting, well, it doesn't really need a hook.
00:41:40.863 - 00:42:16.689, Speaker A: Sini's art is the hook. And the show is the largest and best collection of painting and sculpture from this time and place that you will ever see in one museum. But if I needed to give the Met's new exhibition a present day hook, here's the one I would give it in one word, tactility. And I think this is actually an interesting point within. So here you have Katya Kazakina, the art detective, saying if I was to overstate it, forget freeze. I'm Sienna in at the Met. And here you see.
00:42:16.689 - 00:43:00.893, Speaker A: Listen to this. I feel a lot of people are talking about the tactile, about the need for culture that feels rooted in space and context due to a felt loss of place and permanency in these digital times. And one of the things that's so arresting here is the evidence of a time when images were felt as much as seen. Now I have a different interpretation than I think that Ben Davis meant here. But I think, to me, when people say they want the tactile, when they want a feeling, rather than just over the abstraction. And this is part of the problem, I would argue, of what's happened with art since the 80s. It has.
00:43:00.893 - 00:43:49.055, Speaker A: And we're painting with broad brushes. And as we've noted before, it doesn't mean that there aren't huge exceptions and there's not genius everywhere, or maybe not everywhere, but there are without question. There are. You know, you look at, again, late Richard Prince, you look at late John Baldassarre, even late Warhol, for me, is spectacular. And they're all having the same conversation, partly, again, traveling through the mediums, all three of those artists, and probably Warhol, interestingly, the pioneer, the first one to really, I would argue, in a convincing way, where you can kind of see he's playing with really going through the mediums. Of course, there are other examples, but in a very persuasive aesthetic way. Warhol was very significant, I'd argue, in that conversation.
00:43:49.055 - 00:44:57.859, Speaker A: And so there are exceptions here. But generally speaking, part of the issue with installation art, with a lot of art that people see, a lot of the common complaints you'll hear when you're with your friends, going to the galleries, as one does, it's not resonating, right? And so here it's back to feeling over. I would say abstraction is kind of how I'm reading Ben Davis's idea here. And I think that's one of the great things that we have here in what I'm loosely calling the second generation of digital art, is people who grew up with, again, video games and then have the tools, this painting with a computer. And now they're just doing things that they find poetic and beautiful and colorful. It's not just some abstraction, which I think, again, aesthetically separates it from this first generation as well. And there is definitely aesthetic in the first generation, but again, it's a bit more cool and abstract and cool in the sense of it's not as emotional.
00:44:57.859 - 00:45:18.745, Speaker A: It's not. It's a bit more, you know, again, you're coding rather than to make your image, rather than what I'd call painting with a computer. Right. So again, here we are, and people are just rave reviews. And you can see why. You can see why. I mean, the delight.
00:45:18.745 - 00:45:48.087, Speaker A: And these are works I've never seen. Like, I kind of want to travel there. It's only until the 25th. I don't know, you know, how you do it. But this Looks spectacular. And you see each one of these little images, you know, and you look at that. I mean, and the white dress of the Virgin Mary, I mean, it's spectacular, you know? So I have an idea.
00:45:48.087 - 00:46:21.925, Speaker A: You know, I came up with it with a friend on Friday, you know, as far as if I were to do. Finally, if I were to do. And I'm going to speed up a bit. If I was to do. If I were to do a Patreon, where you do kind of adventures in culture, and then you really go in deep. Maybe you talk about Devo one day, you know, Devo, Duran Duran, whatever the thing is. Or maybe you're talking about, okay, let's go into El Ducho, right? You put out a video just once every week or two, because I can't really do too many more than that.
00:46:21.925 - 00:46:47.575, Speaker A: And then you just make it a thing. And then maybe, maybe after a year, then you release it to the public. But if you want to watch it, support, maybe you don't, maybe you just keep it tight. But I think eventually, maybe not in a year, maybe, who knows? But just thoughts out loud. The Met. So here it is, you know, the rise of painting. So as you can see here, this looks like a blockbuster.
00:46:47.575 - 00:47:14.611, Speaker A: This looks like a blockbuster. So, yeah, just opened in New York. If you're nearby or if you're in the us, make your way over there. Let's continue. Magnus Resch. While traveling through Europe, I spoke with several gallerists. So Magnus Resch is a prominent art market expert, serial entrepreneur, has a book on, like, you know, was around when NFTs were booming, kind of.
00:47:14.611 - 00:47:35.227, Speaker A: So let's continue. It appears that European galleries are struggling. Okay. While traveling through Europe, I spoke with several gallerists. It appears that European galleries are struggling severely. Based on my conversations, Alpha galleries revenue down 20%. So the top galleries, beta galleries by 50% and the rest by 70%.
00:47:35.227 - 00:47:58.255, Speaker A: That almost sounds optimistic. This aligns with auction houses, which are down 30%. So more evidence. And again, those two kind of just all three, actually, of these things we saw here. Okay. I guess some people are saying freeze is boring. I skipped freeze to go to the Met.
00:47:58.255 - 00:48:33.591, Speaker A: Feeling over abstraction. Now I'm painting with a very broad brush here, but all kind of interesting. Let's continue. Omz the last few years are a blip in the timeline of art and just the start of art on the blockchain. If you think the story has already been written and the stars are already established, you've learned nothing from history and totally and time will work it out. Time usually seems to get things right, don't they? And sometimes it takes a long time, but it does tend to get it, you know, to a certain degree. Right.
00:48:33.591 - 00:49:26.149, Speaker A: And again, sometimes you get, you look at Hilda Clint, it took a long time, but now, okay, Hilda Clint is celebrated and recognized. It took 100 years, maybe longer, but you know, it happens. So I think an interesting point, this was posted in or at least part of what Skull takes was posting in the, in the community. And I don't want to go too long here, but you can see this is what I want to highlight here. So then are they going to talking about selling digital art before the blockchain? This is back in 1991 interview with Rhizomes then executive director Lauren Cornell. So then are they going to be receiving a file on a usb? Are they going to be receiving an email from you? I think that we might give them a little object. So just not sure.
00:49:26.149 - 00:50:03.873, Speaker A: I think we might do this. So give them the file on a usb. And I've discussed this before, like this is basically how it used to work. Ask Lorna Mills, who's been doing digital and GIFs for quite a while. You know, how did you do you know, how are you selling art? Before the blockchain was USB and a certificate of authenticity. So give them the file on a USB and then also a certificate because media works often require certificates because they're more complicated to manage than the painting. So, you know, so yeah, so interesting there.
00:50:03.873 - 00:50:48.067, Speaker A: This was also interesting part of the same thread, I think for $6,000, Nessim, who I think is this artist here, will sell you a set of 10 prints, hand colored with pastel and watercolor in a handmade portfolio and a set of 20 slides, 10 left, 10 right. And the stereo viewer in a fancy leather pouch. Nassim hand colors her work because the inks from color printers fade over time. Again, this is again the dilemma of the digital artist pre blockchain where you have to make it physical. Otherwise like there wasn't. You had these at best it was a USB and a certificate of authenticity. And you know, trust me, right? Robert Handel has two of her works.
00:50:48.067 - 00:51:13.597, Speaker A: One of her pieces is in the permanent art collection at the National Gallery in Budapest, Hungary. So very cool. And you know, I think there's still something to be said for this. Interestingly, let's get to the work here. Almost an hour in Jack on Fire. So Cedar plank, also known as hastuba waffle, dropping a ton of artwork here in the last few days. Really since the last show.
00:51:13.597 - 00:51:32.521, Speaker A: So here is this wild monster kind of or skeleton in its underwear. And some kind of amazing painting here. Digital painting. Jack on fire edition of five. One went for 77 tezos. Impressively. This one was quite interesting too.
00:51:32.521 - 00:51:56.287, Speaker A: Afterlife edition of five. And as you see here, again, just kind of having fun. And the lasers coming from the face, who knows? Again, kind of like a modern day Basquiat. We almost see it in the crown here. A homage of sorts. And again, love the color for describing the afterlife. A little bit of animation and everything.
00:51:56.287 - 00:52:25.235, Speaker A: Just super interesting work as you can see everywhere. It's very painterly, isn't it? Another work, this is done on Fantavision one imagines. And here we see this kind of wild, it's, you know, Hastrubal waffle can or cedar plank, also known as cedar plank. Can kind of do just kind of whatever they want right now. And it's all just kind of looking kind of cool. Great background here too. So this is I guess a dog.
00:52:25.235 - 00:52:47.293, Speaker A: I'm not even sure it did very well. Now it's 375 tezos. And again, addition of five and one selling for 65 tezos at auction. So long bonus. So here's kind of a weird one where the person is being breathed out. So not even sure what the reference is there. And that's at auction for 75 tezos.
00:52:47.293 - 00:53:07.131, Speaker A: And stimming this. Sold for 75 tezos. So again, doing very well here. Cedar plank looks like Fantavision again based on the animation and the illustration. Here's another one. Cedar plank Mano a mano. Maybe two guys maybe kissing here in this.
00:53:07.131 - 00:53:43.905, Speaker A: And again, kind of bending artwork here or at least kind of morphine. Interesting effect. Let's say lots going on here. That's 375 tezos on secondary now sold at the auction for 54 to a hack and do an endo. This is an edition of five. So as you see here, maybe using the same kind of bendy software that we were noticing in the last one. So maybe a new effect for waffles, a new animation effect and stonewashed, maybe referring to jeans here and here.
00:53:43.905 - 00:54:21.435, Speaker A: Very cool Fantavision work here. So all sorts of fun and creativity being had here with the pants going on the person. And so that is cedar plank, also known as Hysteruba waffle with a whole bunch of works all at once. Something to talk about. So this is Zuozho. Let's see what Zuozho is up to. Very unusual piece.
00:54:21.435 - 00:54:41.091, Speaker A: I mean if there's one word you could use with suo. I think it would be unusual. And here it almost looks like a school room or something. What an odd subject matter. Hey, Beautifully executed as ever. And this is an edition of 11. Sold out at 15 tazos each.
00:54:41.091 - 00:55:02.571, Speaker A: Nice work. So Zozo continuing to create wonder for us over here. NUV 1914. Banista en la Playa. So something on the beach by Fernando Botero. So very cool here as well. And I guess those are palm trees.
00:55:02.571 - 00:55:17.175, Speaker A: Done with NUV1914's gradient style. And just awesome. Totally awesome. And you gotta love the swimsuit there. Like this is awesome. The spheres here are brilliant. And look at the hair.
00:55:17.175 - 00:55:33.215, Speaker A: There's kind of humor there. I mean, this is awesome. And the knees. Great division into shapes. And look at these great gradients. So more mastery by Nev 1914. And this sold out like immediately at 15 tezos.
00:55:33.215 - 00:55:54.987, Speaker A: Here's another one, Odalisque in red jacket after Henri Matisse. So I don't think we saw this one, but another spectacular work here. So you're. I guess we're seeing of1914's influences in these works. Here's Martin Bruce with a new one of one. This is only 50 tazos. And this is going to be done so Skomra.
00:55:54.987 - 00:56:22.589, Speaker A: The only bidder so far. $34 for a one of one. Martin Bruce here. Porto Worm. So I think Martin Bruce is in Portugal, if I remember right. And so here is a work so kind of looks like a photo, but also some drawing or painting on top. And then just there's no one quite like Martin Bruce in terms of originality and creativity and just visually interesting.
00:56:22.589 - 00:56:33.365, Speaker A: I mean, so visually interesting. Rj, three doors. I think this was burned. Point and click. Microfiction. So not sure. You have become death.
00:56:33.365 - 00:56:49.905, Speaker A: As death must choose. Let me do this. A form of imminence. And again, we have some textures here. Why is that going to the top? So here it is. And I guess those are the three doors. So not sure if this will come back or not.
00:56:49.905 - 00:57:03.755, Speaker A: So. Yeah, so burned. And it was an addition of one before. Interesting textures as ever. Here's Yuri J. Just posting on X. Interesting abstract.
00:57:03.755 - 00:57:27.617, Speaker A: So it'll be interesting to see if we get different versions of this abstract again. Kind of a bit of a. What's the word? Maybe a melting tool or something. I'll call it Control Z on Photoshop. Not to undo on Photoshop, but maybe there's another one. I want to call it the Liquify. It almost seems like we saw that in Hasdrubal waffles as well.
00:57:27.617 - 00:57:38.445, Speaker A: Or cedar plank. It looks like there's a liquefied thing going on perhaps here too. Not sure. Not sure at all. So cool work by Yuri J. And not sure if this is new. This is called New Order.
00:57:38.445 - 00:57:51.443, Speaker A: And there we see the octopus sitting at a restaurant. Wonderfully. And here. So. Yeah, so fabulous. So perhaps a preview. Perhaps an old work.
00:57:51.443 - 00:58:07.891, Speaker A: Not sure. And there is the piano underneath the table that is being played by the octopus who was looking at the menu. And there is the street outside. Awesome piece. Here's kudu kola. And this was picked up by absurd deity. For how much? 31 tazos food and beverages.
00:58:07.891 - 00:58:39.149, Speaker A: And kind of in the similar spirit to cedar plank there in this kind of doodling, so to speak, this digital doodling that we see here. So all very interesting. And here we see a sampled brush which we see Ed Morola used sometimes here. Kind of like a different kind of technique where you just kind of get a stamp and then it repeats. Creating your own brush, as we see sometimes with PP Universal. Very interesting. Some interesting works by Nick Shum.
00:58:39.149 - 00:58:57.885, Speaker A: Greg. Nick Shamika Float. Pretty nice for Excel to make this pool here. And I love how Greg's keeping these numbers in here. Nice pool. Fabulous. Totally cool, I think.
00:58:57.885 - 00:59:12.879, Speaker A: Did this sell out? There is. There are three left at 299. I might have to pick up one of those. This was spectacular too. Fireworks at Tappan Z Bridge. And this is 5 Tezos edition of 25. And so I think still quite a few left.
00:59:12.879 - 00:59:39.745, Speaker A: And kind of has. You see this. It almost looks like a Japanese woodblock, which is probably what it's based on. So kind of a different kind of pastiche, I guess, than we see with nuv, but kind of in the same. Probably could show it in the same show, let's say, you know, homages to influences, so to speak. Very, very, very interesting here. So again, using I think Excel, as you can see in the border.
00:59:39.745 - 00:59:57.925, Speaker A: Super interesting. Mariana Ju. I think this is new. This is on base. And as we see here, I believe it's Kid Pix that makes these flowers. If they show up here, I give it another second. Otherwise I think we'll just have to leave it here.
00:59:57.925 - 01:00:14.155, Speaker A: So none minted so far. 0.015 eth Greens is the name of the work. So cool. Kind of gif. I assume that is from Mariana Ju. Let's continue.
01:00:14.155 - 01:00:36.971, Speaker A: Here's Mumble Boy. This was picked up by Yuri JJ. Edition of one. So nice piece. Love the color and a nice Kind of just chaotic collage by Mumble Boy, as you can see. And again, just going back and forth between physical and digital. And a true medley of physical and digital works here.
01:00:36.971 - 01:00:59.857, Speaker A: Just tons to look at and then zooming out. So it's been doing this since the 90s. A variation on this technique that has evolved. A nice big file, 5200 by 5700. Here's that work by Ugo Digi, a tribute to Henri Matisse. And then making it of screens with La Dance written on the screen. I thought this was a very cool work.
01:00:59.857 - 01:01:26.347, Speaker A: So nice piece by Ugo Digi. I don't know if it's been minted anywhere. And here, one of the artists who best contributed to defining the revolutionary development in the visual arts during the decades of the first decades of the 20th century and significant developments in painting and sculpture. Thank you, Ego. Super interesting. Here's Spiegel's Maskin with a work on foundation. This is on Ethereum at an auction.
01:01:26.347 - 01:01:40.339, Speaker A: Starting bid of 0.404. This is fine. So I guess an addition of 1. And here it is. We are lucky that it loads. And I think we saw maybe an early version, at least I did online. And so here's the animated version.
01:01:40.339 - 01:01:59.180, Speaker A: And playing off of the meme with the room on fire and the person inside. I think it's like a bear or something with a bowler hat saying, this is fine. Instead the computer is saying, this is fine, as we see this beautifully dithered fire. Great piece. I Wonder how big. 90 frames, 4 color. That's what I was wondering.
01:01:59.180 - 01:02:18.083, Speaker A: GIF 320 by 240. Is this on chain? Is kind of my next question. How big is this? Probably not on chain. Otherwise it would say interesting, but it's not. Doesn't look like a huge file though, either. This is Suisoichi. The Devil's Cross and Evil's Heart by Suizoichi.
01:02:18.083 - 01:02:35.789, Speaker A: This is on Sealed Art. And we'll see if we can get a bigger picture here. So kind of a wild again. This kind of looks like effects on effects. And always I'm waiting for Mirror Kit also to come back again. Could always sort of hang with Mirror Kit on the wall. Very interesting, edgy drawing.
01:02:35.789 - 01:02:52.963, Speaker A: And we have another one, this one with a little more kind of noise, texture. Perhaps night. No destinations yet. So I love these distorted drawings and then really processed a lot online. And here is. I think you'd call it the Beginning. What is it called? The Beginning of the World.
01:02:52.963 - 01:03:13.709, Speaker A: What is the name of Gustave Courbet? If I Had to venture a guess. I think that's Courbet. And so of course, given the Walk treatment. GM so hilarious and beautiful rendition here. Another great pastiche. And here's another work by Walk. This was collected by James Bloom, who gave the commentary there earlier on the shows.
01:03:13.709 - 01:03:40.897, Speaker A: The good shows in Jane Freeze. And I think that's worth noting. There were some people are also saying there's good shows and that's worth noting. And there is a lot of great art out there in the contemporary art scene. For all of the criticism you could level at it. There is a lot of great art out there. And that is an important thing to mention and to note.
01:03:40.897 - 01:03:54.041, Speaker A: So I'm not even sure what this is. It looks like my snowboarding skills. So maybe based on a picture. Kind of looks like a new series by Walk, who also was doing that crazy, that wild screenshot series. Here's Lorna Mills. Ardent. Regina.
01:03:54.041 - 01:04:07.411, Speaker A: Regina. Regina. That is again, it's the name of a horse. Of course, I come from Saskatchewan where we pronounce it Regina. So anyways, here are a couple of eagles. Kind of a cool nature work by. By Lorna Mills.
01:04:07.411 - 01:04:21.235, Speaker A: Now a thousand tezos on secondary, I guess. Sold out. Nice work. Sold out at 20 tazos each. Nice work. Here's White Horse, this by Sum, a digital painting. And as you can see here.
01:04:21.235 - 01:04:40.795, Speaker A: So new painting by Sum, which I don't think we've seen too many new paintings recently, like here and there. So it's great to see. And some cool works in the background. I noticed some of her secondary was selling well as well. Kind of a different. Almost like an airbrush type work. I assume it's a digital work.
01:04:40.795 - 01:04:55.419, Speaker A: It looks like a Digital edition of 10 for 3 Tezos. 2 gone already. Just listed Gregorio Zanardi. My genesis and exchange is coming. Is very close. So this isn't finished. This is a work in progress but very cool painting here.
01:04:55.419 - 01:05:11.973, Speaker A: Digital painting by Gregorio gonna put be put up on Solana. It is not minted yet. I even like this. You know where you see. Just like we were seeing with Moto Hero. A little bit of the under drawing being left in. You see that blue over there and over there.
01:05:11.973 - 01:05:28.455, Speaker A: Nice. It actually adds some nice details, doesn't it? Quila Nina. This is on Tazos Resistancia Indigenous. Indigenous. And this is digital painting and Procreate assisted with Dall E3. Interesting. So awesome painter.
01:05:28.455 - 01:05:45.839, Speaker A: Quila Nina. So a combination of painting and Dall E3. Very cool. And this great shirt there. Beautiful. And I think you'd Call that translation Indigenous Resistance I think is the translation. Jake Studios.
01:05:45.839 - 01:06:06.385, Speaker A: Where am I? So also putting out some a few works here. I think at least a couple so so interesting piece here. As you see the cursor and maybe the Jake Studios figure with these great shoes. Just awesome. And how much is this going for? So 50 tazos to Salwaki. Awesome. Here's another one.
01:06:06.385 - 01:06:22.005, Speaker A: Bullboy edition of 20. And I think this was just minted. Actually that's June 2, 2023. So here's an old Jake Studios. So I think it was probably posted somewhere. So interesting there. Art Presti.
01:06:22.005 - 01:06:50.455, Speaker A: I think this is a new work. And again you get this almost like Kandinsky esque digital pixel art abstract psychedelic hypnotical abstraction edition of four. And this was just posted and two gone at five tezos each. And I think this is a Preview by Sabato RGB SNEK Deluxe Paint 4. So interesting work here. Not exactly sure. Kind of looks like a snake and maybe some barriers.
01:06:50.455 - 01:07:16.651, Speaker A: Not exactly sure what the references are. Interesting. Here's Hermipe with a new pixel artwork and posted on Twitter. And of course I follow actually this is Avenir who I don't know if I follow them. And here it kind of looks like surveillance cameras, doesn't it? So I'm sure this would just go over fabulously on the blockchain. So maybe Hermit Pay will come back. So this is part of an ad, I think.
01:07:16.651 - 01:07:43.665, Speaker A: And there you see a bullhorn, a surveillance camera. Here's Element Li. This is interesting. Playing again with inverted light basically and the absence of light in the darkness as Element Li has commented on in the past. And here this is called involving. So kind of a mysterious work here. Looks like a figure in a room with some sort of tunnel.
01:07:43.665 - 01:08:02.425, Speaker A: Wild one. Here's Gamma and interesting. Almost looks like a digital sculpture, but pixelated. So that is interesting. Here's Mazin the third or Endless Mason commissioned work. Maya Grove. So kind of half pixel art, half glitch.
01:08:02.425 - 01:08:29.037, Speaker A: And this is I think on Zora exclusive drop on Zora celebrating their expansion to the base and Zksync networks. So it continues. So Zora going multi chain. I wonder how that works because I thought ZORA was its own blockchain, but maybe I guess they are multi chain though too. So they have their own. But they also do Ethereum based and ZK sync. Okay, I think we figured that out.
01:08:29.037 - 01:08:48.818, Speaker A: This is interesting. This is that pinball guy, ASCII portrait of Detroit's most famous organ donor. So Robocop. But you see here Looks like the photo. It's like a photo of the screen, which is a nice touch, isn't it? That famous image reminds you of Peepee Cop. Here's that pinball guy again. 25 cent dilemma.
01:08:48.818 - 01:09:25.959, Speaker A: So playing with ASCII. And again, looks like a photo of a screen or video of a screen, which is super interesting and looks like a PEPC and Coke. Kind of adds a whole other dimension to the piece, doesn't it? I like it. Like, I think it really adds a layer of, you know, it just makes it that much more interesting than, you know, just a pure ASCII on its own. I mean, you see the same thing with Enigmatis, where you see kind of this texture in the work here. It's not just pure text with no other processing. It's not just purely graphical.
01:09:25.959 - 01:09:50.588, Speaker A: Like, there's a texture element to it. And here. So again, always experimenting here we see a little bit of magic wand here in the selection. We also see kind of a mono palette, you know, mono color palette, so to speak. A lot of sepias and grays, and it looks like a skull. Very interesting here. Just going with an outline and removing that outline really nicely.
01:09:50.588 - 01:10:12.443, Speaker A: And of course, the Vermeer painting there, also by Enigmatris. And here is Plants, also known as Kap and also known as Figments. Also playing with ASCII. 960 by 840. Plants are multipixular. Okay, so let's just. And here you see, and not a huge work.
01:10:12.443 - 01:10:33.447, Speaker A: Maybe 1,000 by 800, if I had to guess, 960 by 840. And you see, just putting the pixie, the ASCII on top and animating it a little bit. And just really interesting. I love the frame, by the way. If you notice the frame and these wild corners. Love it. Even there, these drawn frame.
01:10:33.447 - 01:10:55.465, Speaker A: I mean, wild how it gets narrower to wider. Here's Sachu, the arty industrial horizons. Interesting. Almost looks like kind of a little bit magic wandy here. Not sure. Some sort of selection with. You see, basically, it looks like factory in the background.
01:10:55.465 - 01:11:12.757, Speaker A: You have nature in the front. And then underneath is circuitry kind of being masked over here by circuitry. It's almost like a matrix industrial horizon. Interesting piece. And it looks like it sold out at 10 tezos each. Yeah, sold out. So nice work there.
01:11:12.757 - 01:11:32.535, Speaker A: Here is stip and pixel on Zora. I guess they put this QR code on everything. At least it's not here when you zoom in or you maximize. And so here's some cats, some cool pixel art. Cats from Stip and Pixel. Again, this is on Zora 43 minted. And here's another really nice one.
01:11:32.535 - 01:11:42.407, Speaker A: Love the color here with these two minimal cats. I love it on also on Zora. Fabulous color. Only nine minted so far. Thud. Jump. Meow.
01:11:42.407 - 01:12:05.221, Speaker A: And here's one more. Fifteen minted. And I thought just this is like Stippen's really cool in the minimalism and the style really of pixel art that they do. I believe out of Argentina. I believe out of Buenos Aires, but not positive I think out of Argentina. Lena Gordiva, who we saw in the comments, look at this piece. Tezos Tuesday Trek.
01:12:05.221 - 01:12:22.197, Speaker A: So I don't think this. Where can I collect this? I will mint on objects soon. So pretty cool, isn't it? Kind of looks like someone in the security area with all the screens. Who knows. Very cool pixel artwork. So again, great to discover Lena's work. Greenger.
01:12:22.197 - 01:12:52.043, Speaker A: Happy Sunday everyone. Let's chill for today. And a cool little architectural interior, shall we say, with that 45 degree angle, I think or at least that perspective, that video game perspective, shall we say with a moving background. Very interesting. Here's Braindead with a kind of looks like a turntable or maybe a. Maybe it's a 8 projector. What is it called? It's escaping me right now.
01:12:52.043 - 01:13:23.959, Speaker A: It kind of looks like an old movie projector is actually what it looks like or camera. So very cool. So brain dead keeps putting out a work a day in October, Green Ginger with a work Telep Nuat inspired from iconic pallet town from Canto region. So this is an addition of one and it's at 75 tezos as a starting bid. So very cool. One of one from Green Ginger. Love the again, it kind of has that video game perspective.
01:13:23.959 - 01:13:38.675, Speaker A: Right. That we were noting before. And interesting 100% on chain as retro Manny was saying. Very cool. Let's continue. Burger. This is by Chaz who's back on the scene.
01:13:38.675 - 01:13:58.025, Speaker A: So an arcade game and a retro burger inspired arcade game where it looks like you make burgers hilariously. And there's burgers in the background. So cool. Work here by chaz edition of 10 for now. 650 looks like it sold out. Nice work there. Here's bite by bit Motel pool.
01:13:58.025 - 01:14:29.791, Speaker A: Some chunky audio, almost like Pong. It's kind of a wild one. Animation and sound made by 1988 Fantavision. So using the same software as we saw with Waffles or Cedar plank at the beginning of the show. Here we have Kappen who's also did the figments work or the plants work that we just saw. Let's just. There we go.
01:14:29.791 - 01:14:55.939, Speaker A: So a few more on Rodeo from Kappen. So continuing just putting out these jams which it looks like just elements from Kappan's palette. Really digital, you know, bag of tricks. Very cool work here. Here's Nicholas Sassoon SGRB2. Very nice sphere here. Just with I guess three or four colors.
01:14:55.939 - 01:15:21.517, Speaker A: Maybe four colors. Not sure what the S stands for. But of course RGB being colors. Maybe super rgb, not sure. Here is Kiro times Ranix Deer and so cool collab. Of course we see Ranksteer's kind of gradients here and then a bit of a Kiro analog video glitch overlay so to speak. Or mix.
01:15:21.517 - 01:15:42.321, Speaker A: And that's at 0.08 ETH. Here's another work by Kiro. This is on Zora and playing with the anime. Beautiful juxtaposition here or mix of anime and this textured analog video. You know, just textures. Video textures.
01:15:42.321 - 01:16:03.779, Speaker A: Very cool. Speaking of video textures, here's X Mortal Skybound. So more waves, more beaches, more nature scenery. So nice piece here from Ex Mortals. An edition of 13 and selling out at 1169. Here's Cal Flemmer Smile and is this on chain minted for midnight mass October 2024. 192 by 192.
01:16:03.779 - 01:16:23.171, Speaker A: Canvas thousand by thousand final. So great textures here as well. And beautiful. Look at that. So edition of 10 and that looks like it sold out at 666. So Cal Flemmer Twelves continues to develop their market there impressively. Compos composition 355.
01:16:23.171 - 01:16:41.443, Speaker A: This is by Klaus and cool. Animated abstract. I mean amazing. We're at 355 so still putting out one a day. This is still available at 21tezos. Here's Renki Ikuji. And so another animated abstract here.
01:16:41.443 - 01:16:58.795, Speaker A: Almost looking impossible but not quite. Just a very interesting animation by Renki here. Not listed. Here's perfect loop. The infinite balance. Just kind of a rad looking piece here. Playing with operating system iconography.
01:16:58.795 - 01:17:11.625, Speaker A: Maybe some kind of feedback and zooming in at the same time. And some colors flashing. Pretty trippy pigs from plums. This is Etienne Jacob I think just kind of a. Cool. This is. I think.
01:17:11.625 - 01:17:40.667, Speaker A: I don't know if this is a GIF or a video or what it is, but it's looking pretty cool for I don't know if this is generative. It's pretty impressive. Would hang well with our friend, the master of psychedelic abstraction who Is escaping. I am half sick here, so. But I'm sure we will see. What is his name? It's not Pixel Boy. It's.
01:17:40.667 - 01:17:55.027, Speaker A: It's not human. Yeah. Anyways, we will find out. We will definitely see their work again. Zilliong Our dreams. It's kind of an interesting piece here by Zang. Definitely creates an atmosphere, doesn't it, of light of these screens.
01:17:55.027 - 01:18:16.635, Speaker A: And what does Zoo say? Our dreams. So very cool piece here. Very dreamlike. Here's Koda nakazono. Continuum number 210. And so again, we have kind of the metallic structure that is animated. And then, interestingly, we're starting to see this bit of movement in the background here of a different kind.
01:18:16.635 - 01:18:33.845, Speaker A: And a wire, interestingly there, a little bit of a Photoshop canvas. Interesting orange. Very internety, isn't it? Continuum number 210, edition of 5. And that is sold out at 10 Tezos. Try not to sneeze here. No Hygiene. Champion Kimbo.
01:18:33.845 - 01:18:54.165, Speaker A: So here, more totally experimental AI work by no Hygiene. Continuing to tread. Break new ground here. Here's another one. I kind of love this piece. A whole bunch of bees together. I guess that's Britney Spears.
01:18:54.165 - 01:19:06.475, Speaker A: And so interesting. I don't know if it's AI collage. There's that angel figure that we often see. Edition of One for 45 Tezos. Here's another interesting piece. GG. So Wildwork, this one sold.
01:19:06.475 - 01:19:33.295, Speaker A: And great kind of selection there. Really rough, but cool selection of the legs there on the legs, as you see Skomra around the pool and remembering you. And here see kind of a textured. Again, very textured. AI artwork kind of looks a little bit more pixelated. Beautiful piece from Skarmra. Nice color and everything stable.
01:19:33.295 - 01:19:52.023, Speaker A: Diffusion and diffusers. Textual inversion. Edition of one selling for 40 tezos at auction. Nice work. Here's Cha. And I've been discussing a little bit the weird phenomenon of AI pixel art. And here you see it in action with, you know, some squares perfect, other squares a little off.
01:19:52.023 - 01:20:12.249, Speaker A: It's a pretty interesting experience. Visual experience. Kind of looks like a landscape here. Using DALL E from 2022 to. And sunrise over an alien ocean filled with strange clouds. And here, Toques, as we see here. Really interesting piece, especially this part right here.
01:20:12.249 - 01:20:30.255, Speaker A: And you see the chair. Very smooth, kind of serene work by Tuques. Here is Mikey de la Creme Bank Robber Blues. I don't know if we've seen this one. I don't think so. And cool gray guitar with the bank robber seemingly in the front door just inside. The hall.
01:20:30.255 - 01:20:51.491, Speaker A: And here is Human Boy with a couple of cool works. Kind of sci fi AI with a texture, that kind of screen texture. Here's another one. Kind of insect machines, so to speak, put out by Human Boy. So very cool there. As we go into the physicals, here's Filippo Francocci. Interesting abstract on black paper.
01:20:51.491 - 01:21:11.015, Speaker A: Once again, ton of details here. Incredible actually. Shall we see if we can open it very quickly. As you see here, all the details, pretty amazing. We saw the process the other day. Here's another great one by Filippo Francocci. The Return, an oil painting done on a piece of recycled wood.
01:21:11.015 - 01:21:48.809, Speaker A: Very cool. The image was inspired by various iterations created by an AI and reinterpreted by me using oil paint. Yeah, you know, this again, as AI is an inspiration for actual painting compositions, it's bound to happen. I feel like I've seen it even in what I'd consider more contemporary trad art. And you just go, that kind of looks like maybe AI helped out in the composition. I mean, theoretically you could simply put the work on your projector projected onto the canvas and then you just start know, tracing it out. Right.
01:21:48.809 - 01:22:12.425, Speaker A: It seems like I'm sure that's already happened, is happening and will continue to happen. David Hales needs a title. Just a rad artist, as you can see here. Look at this. Just continues to do, you know, beautiful work, acrylic on canvas. And here is. We'll be spending Thursday and Friday with girls like us now, I'm not sure.
01:22:12.425 - 01:22:32.491, Speaker A: So that's not in Berlin. This is part of the Kristin Hillardy Gallery. And the artist I think is Rufai Zakari. So very cool. Kind of as you see here, almost using like elements from the grocery store. Some collage, some painting, some textures, some paper. This is an interesting piece.
01:22:32.491 - 01:22:47.225, Speaker A: Hugo Cappy. It's not gallery. Just again taking almost like these diagrams, but adding humor here. A little edgier on that one. And here's Sui Soichi with a drawing. Weeks go by on this one. Happy to be learning to draw and excited to finish.
01:22:47.225 - 01:23:06.409, Speaker A: I saw Dan Control also say excited to draw. So pretty interesting piece by Sui Soichi. And finally, Tim Lahan. Some sort of song for the times. And just kind of cool watching these musical notes melt. And that is your show, my friends. Thank you for joining me and I hope you have a wonderful start to the week.
01:23:06.409 - 01:23:11.175, Speaker A: Come join us and hang out on Wednesday with Son of Steg. Until next time. Take care.
