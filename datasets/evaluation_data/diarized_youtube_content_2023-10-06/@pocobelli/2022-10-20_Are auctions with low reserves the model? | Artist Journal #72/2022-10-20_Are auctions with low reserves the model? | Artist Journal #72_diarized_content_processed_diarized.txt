00:00:02.640 - 00:00:33.222, Speaker A: I was thinking I need to get the audio from this phone onto my computer and figure that out on open broadcast software obs, if you're looking to do your own show. Hello and welcome. October 20, 2022 Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, your artist reporter. I have good news. I think it's going to be a shorter show. So good news all round, isn't it? Thank you for the shoutouts.
00:00:33.222 - 00:01:02.304, Speaker A: Just saw a tweet out there from measureless. If you have nothing to do today on Twitter, or if you get outside Twitter, go to YouTube where pokebelly is. So that was really nice. Let's get into it. Let's see how short we can make this for everybody's benefit. The shows have been creeping longer, haven't they? So turning over to our friend Rat cloak, see who has a very ambitious work here. This was released on foundation.
00:01:02.304 - 00:01:33.844, Speaker A: Okay. And he already has a bid. His reserve has been met for five ETH. I have to say, this is my favorite way of selling work. Like, I'm probably going to start putting Ethereum work up at kind of a lower reserve, I mean, relative to maybe previous sales. And then they just go for what they go for. And I think actually foundation, I think superwear might have actually potentially have adopted foundations kind of model, but I'm not positive on that, so don't quote me on that.
00:01:33.844 - 00:02:00.292, Speaker A: But anyways, I love this because then it's 24 hours. Everybody has their chance. If you want it, you got a bid now, otherwise it goes for your reserve. So it's all good. So congratulations to him for meeting his reserve. And of course, this is part of pareidiolips. Now I want to take a closer look at this work before we get into our show notes because this is done in his very trademark style here that we see on the St.
00:02:00.292 - 00:02:25.592, Speaker A: Christopher work that I was lucky enough to purchase. And this beautiful Microsoft paintwork, his style is just awesome. And you see it on the jacket here. And the work itself, I mean, it is kind of a mysterious work. Private keep out. Kind of a haunted house. Kind of reminds me of, actually Edgar Allan Poe.
00:02:25.592 - 00:03:03.148, Speaker A: The fall of the house of Usher. That's a story that, where the house becomes a metaphor for the mind and for the person and the haunted brain. Edgar Allan Poe, huge influence on Baudelaire, who is a huge influence on, of course, the surrealists and everybody else. And yeah, Baudelaire. I mean, we're getting literary quickly here, but which is great, which is part of what makes this show interesting, at least for me. Baudelaire translated Edgar Allan Poe's works, like all of them, as far as I understand. Or most of them, let's put it that way.
00:03:03.148 - 00:03:22.360, Speaker A: So, anyways, this is actually called Lord of the Flies. I haven't read any. William Golding, I believe that's the name of the author, lord of the Flies. Most of you probably have, though. It's kind of a work that you'll often read in secondary school. So most people know it. So I might not know all the references here, but I do know the references here.
00:03:22.360 - 00:03:52.418, Speaker A: I mean, there's like a couple of drones, very modern imagery that maybe doesn't get used enough. And beautifully rendered. He reminds me in the sense, not in a similar way, but analogously of Morlakos, who just can apply his. Basically his tracing style, but it's totally his own style. And it just looks beautiful. Look at these plants here, these leaves, and then the ones far away, done with the airbrush. So really, again, Microsoft paint.
00:03:52.418 - 00:04:15.554, Speaker A: Look at the grass. Just awesome in its. You know, he does almost each blade, but then there's a roughness to it, too. So there's a lot of subtlety in Ratcloksey's work. Again, if you go to his profile, you'll see some of his old paintings. So he comes out of traditional painting. Again, I'm not only multi chain, but multimedia here.
00:04:15.554 - 00:04:35.634, Speaker A: I'm a big believer in also painting. Look at Dan Control's awesome painting that we saw yesterday. He can totally paint, as we can see. And just interesting details here. One of these figures that seem to come out of some of the phone works almost like. Looks like. You know what this looks like? Wow.
00:04:35.634 - 00:04:55.714, Speaker A: Let's see if I can just. William Burroughs, the job. That cover. Let's see if we can find the penguin edition. See, first of all, yeah, it kind of reminds me of this guy here. The job. William Burroughs.
00:04:55.714 - 00:05:19.554, Speaker A: Let's just take another look. So, not exactly the same, but we do have some similarities there, don't we? A guy with a shotgun. So it's kind of like this. Almost. Almost. Why is that almost american gothic sort of thing, or however you want to call it, the classic kind of guy with a shotgun. American with a shotgun on the porch.
00:05:19.554 - 00:05:31.422, Speaker A: Similar kind of idea. I actually had a goa mix. I called the job. Unreleased. I lost, actually, that mix. I'm gonna recreate it at some point. But it's 20 years old, still in my brain.
00:05:31.422 - 00:05:49.298, Speaker A: Anyways, very interesting work here. Got a stove. Got this eye. And finally, let's not forget Morpheus here. At least that's what he was calling it in a previous tweet. This woman with the kind of trademark sparkles ratclok. See? Sparkles.
00:05:49.298 - 00:06:02.564, Speaker A: So a beautiful work. Let's see how much that goes for. It is still available for another 12 hours. Again, I just love this. This method here, I think is awesome. Kind of a lower reserve. Not too low, but a lower reserve.
00:06:02.564 - 00:06:27.324, Speaker A: And then just it goes for what it goes for. And that's fun. Kind of creates fomo on the part of collectors, right? And you see how this series is starting to look quite nice. And another kind of series that just kind of looks great has its own feel from rat cloak. See? So very quick, thank you to Poly Jojo for picking up Berlin dinner. So another one of those have sold. So thank you, guys.
00:06:27.324 - 00:06:47.284, Speaker A: I appreciate that. And Poly Jojo also forwards me a lot of artists. So we've a few that we've profiled on the show. So thank you for doing that. That's always appreciated. A couple of quick comments here. So Aksine commenting on yesterday, because I was mentioning the pricing, he had an interesting comment here.
00:06:47.284 - 00:07:18.832, Speaker A: As Warhol said, being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Well, as far as I'm done with a piece, I don't really know what to do with it. Yeah, join the club, man. We're all kind of figuring it out, you know. You see Ratcloaksee is experimenting where to list edition or one of one. And yet, in a sense, that's kind of why I dropped the comment, because in a sense, this really is an artist kind of for artists, spy artists kind of program. This is my feedback.
00:07:18.832 - 00:07:51.622, Speaker A: It's like, yeah, I think that thing could have went as a 101. And you see rat cloaksy has moved towards the one of ones as well. And even, like, I've started on my object, works have started to defer to these low editions. And I almost want to go to one of ones, although I like editions because more people can collect. But I almost have a bias, you might say, towards the one of one, especially as a collector, you know, and then you put out your editions for certain kinds of works is kind of like, you know, the exception to the rule. And it's nice on object. It's part of that culture.
00:07:51.622 - 00:08:08.022, Speaker A: Let's see what else Oxyen says, though, because there's some good stuff. Most of the time, I improvise. The good thing with improvisation, you learn a lot. When I was listening this, I was really thinking, I hope all editions are sold. Exactly. That's how most of us feel. We're just, oh, it's sold.
00:08:08.022 - 00:08:26.384, Speaker A: Oh my God. Someone out there on the Internet likes what I'm doing. So, yeah, that's why I give you the feedback. That was at least a two ETH work in my universe. I could be wrong. That's just an opinion. Rune tune also had a very nice comment.
00:08:26.384 - 00:08:55.730, Speaker A: I always appreciate your careful feedback on my comments, questions and connections. And Runetun has actually helped provide some of our best episodes here because he provides these intellectual provocations, and I use the word in a positive sense and responses. And this is a salon of sorts here. That is kind of what I'm going for here. As Roerich says, this is a news channel full of financial advice. This is not a news channel. But thank you for the comment.
00:08:55.730 - 00:09:24.506, Speaker A: Anyway, all comments are appreciated and we love to hear from Roerich, who's a great guy. Now, this was interesting here. Thank you for the feedback. And I totally agree with you when you say many of those thinkers were being too creative and not necessarily trying to get to the truth. So that's interesting to hear that someone might agree with me on that. And that was one of those things that I didn't plan either. But it's like, yeah, it kind of resonated with me, too, as I thought about it afterwards.
00:09:24.506 - 00:10:11.304, Speaker A: That being said, despite his sometimes referring to Marshall McLuhan, sometimes disappointing categorizations, I think McLuhan did have some very topical realizations at the core of his ideas. Mainly that our tools are an extension of ourselves, and this shapes the way we behave and think. And absolutely, as I put there in response, it's kind of a mixed bag with a lot of these guys. Like, you can't just write people off. And I'm talking with sweeping generalizations, a painting with a broad brush, as my old professor Peter Stoichev used to say at the University of Saskatchewan, he's now the president. I'll have to rekindle the flame there, rekindle the cinema email at some point, but this is the point here. I totally agree.
00:10:11.304 - 00:10:54.098, Speaker A: And like concepts like Global Village is a Marshall McLuhan term, and that's a great concept in a sense. We're kind of in the global village right now, you know, our 200 person program on the Internet, and we're all kind of. It's a global village here. So McLuhan has a lot to contribute, you know, like, there is a lot to take out. My concern is actually that the egos get involved a little too much, but I'm tempted and we'll move on here. I'm tempted sometimes, and maybe I think I'm going to do this at some point here. We're building this program like a plane in midair here, okay? It's like we're building a plane as we're flying through the sky, as they say.
00:10:54.098 - 00:11:22.852, Speaker A: But I'm tempted to even put on a little McLuhan. Give us 30 seconds here and 30 seconds there, so that we can start to get a feel for it, and then we can discuss that. Because right now we're talking in broad generalizations. What are we talking about? We haven't really looked at any McLuhan here. We're just talking about, oh, my sense of it and your sense of it. So maybe we should actually have some video on. I'm not sure if that's gonna, you know, flag the copyright police, but I'm.
00:11:22.852 - 00:11:38.246, Speaker A: I'm willing to try. And I don't see little snippets of 30 seconds here and there in the middle of a video. That shouldn't cause any cause for concern. I thought I'd bring this up, too. Gertrude Stein's salon. So, here is Gertrude Stein. You see her Picasso work here.
00:11:38.246 - 00:11:52.574, Speaker A: And I thought this was just kind of interesting. I've never actually done this. Search the wonders of the Internet. So this looks like. And maybe this is like a recreation here, or the original. Not sure. But you kind of get a sense for it here.
00:11:52.574 - 00:12:08.364, Speaker A: There's Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. I'm not sure if that's. She has the autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, and I think that's actually her. Her alias. So another kind of use of alias early on.
00:12:08.364 - 00:12:46.132, Speaker A: So, anyways, just a feel for the salon here, which I think, since we're discussing that, why not checking in on art Basel? Some almost live reporting here. State of the art art basel from Paul, safe to say, people like FX, hash, and generative art. So let's just play this nice live view. So, this is at Paris plus, I assume, last night. Look at that. Kind of a fun crowd. Hey.
00:12:46.132 - 00:13:36.344, Speaker A: So interesting, interesting. So just so you know, what's going on out there, I was thinking to myself, like, wouldn't it be great to have, like, I don't see, like, people like Louis Osborne or just, like, people, you know, from the community. Like, there are some, but I just don't recognize any of the art they put on, which is kind of interesting in itself. And finally, just an interesting news story here, particularly in the context of Haiti Rockette's issue with object. Look at the shopify. Users get their hands on Tezos nfts with new partnership. So we saw this with Shopify maybe six months ago where they made a brilliant move of I think you can have metamask and gated pages when you have Shopify.
00:13:36.344 - 00:14:17.708, Speaker A: In other words, it's crypto friendly. So if I had 5000 poco tokens, I could say, you know, people, with 5000 tokens, you only get to access this part of my shop, let's say, and get exclusive pokebelly drops, for example. So we've been talking about this. We looked at Ed Marolla and his solution and also purple drank had his solution, which is basically, you have an NFT, very simple, and you gotta love it. And if you have that NFT, you get the drops or you have access, whatever. So this is interesting though. Tezos NFTs are going to be available on websites when you integrate with Shopify.
00:14:17.708 - 00:14:49.634, Speaker A: Here's the line. The taco app allows brands to integrate web3 solutions such as nfts to increase engagement with customers. And e commerce platforms such as Shopify use taco app plugins to offer the service to their merchants. Kind of need an editor there on Cointelegraph, but thank you for the story. So continuing on, so just very interesting, limbo also has gotten some bids here. I don't know if we looked at his work. The sound was awesome on this.
00:14:49.634 - 00:15:15.642, Speaker A: Let's see if we can bring it up. He made the sound himself. Limbo's an acquired taste, in my opinion. But again, and he's one of these artists, the more you look at, the more like, I'm gonna. I'm about to go on a limbo tear on some of his object works here because I'm really, really, really starting to love his work. So anyways, congratulations to him. I'm not sure if this.
00:15:15.642 - 00:15:29.066, Speaker A: Let's see if this is done. Really cool. Music. Current bid 0.42. And if you look at his other work, he's done really well on foundation. So it's gonna be really interesting to see how he does on super rare. Look at that.
00:15:29.066 - 00:16:03.454, Speaker A: 0.730.79, you know, 0.690.49. So Limbo is a really impressive artist and very friendly guy. And so continuing on, super rare, acid boy is giving away this work. And I just thought this was a head turning work here. He's really good at this whole kind of acid vibe and again, just exploring that one theme to the core. So if you retweet his work, you can enter the contest to.
00:16:03.454 - 00:16:26.758, Speaker A: He'll send this to you if you win. So there is that. So this is a work by Dan control, who is also becoming a daily staple here. Surveillance camera again, having that airbrush look, but it's actually gradients. Really interesting decision with the wall here, I think. A really nice move with this vertical line that goes through it. This sold out right away.
00:16:26.758 - 00:16:50.994, Speaker A: Kind of an all star cast of collectors here. Lorna Mills, McMec, TXT, Greco, Martin, Jojo. Not sure who control Peters is, but yeah, this sold out pretty quickly. So is that everybody? Yeah. Label on Humans hologram gallery. Sean Luke, Mikey Wilson. So the community loved this one, so it sold out right away.
00:16:50.994 - 00:17:12.074, Speaker A: I spy with my little eyes a great work. A new Kappa for this not Godzilla event, I think put on by Xerox NFT. So again, this was probably sent to the commission. So interesting colors here. Unusual work for Kappa integrating. So. And remember, Popple had a Godzilla theme, so I didn't put two and two together.
00:17:12.074 - 00:17:38.516, Speaker A: But you see this is probably sent to the commission and the commission sent one to purple drank maybe. So. Yeah, still don't. I mean, you can look that up. There's actually one of the comments from the last week. I think it's someone called parasite. Or if you own the parasite token, there's info on how to participate and who knows how much that costs you.
00:17:38.516 - 00:17:58.546, Speaker A: But anyways, it's in the comments. If you look two or three episodes ago, I thought this was interesting. I didn't realize this was Dexter at first. I saw this. This is for auction. So Dexter is the guy who does the kind of gifts that are kind of really simple beach works or like landscapes. This one was awesome.
00:17:58.546 - 00:18:22.874, Speaker A: I missed this one, right? Sunset on the hill and. Yeah. So he has a work for auction. It's only at ten xtz right now and only 5 hours left. These are jpegs though. So he has removed that contrast. And they're a slightly different style and they tend to feature, I think, this woman in the last two.
00:18:22.874 - 00:18:43.510, Speaker A: So just kind of interesting. Yeah. You see another woman, although different colored hair, so maybe that's someone different. Anyways, a one of one right now only ten XTZ, ten tezos and a surprise drop from Lewis Osborne. And a new series. So he just dropped this by surprise. The first of a new collection on object.
00:18:43.510 - 00:18:53.262, Speaker A: Playing with the emotions. 20 of 2025 tezos each. Swapping now. So just go for it. And here it is. Now it's now 50. Just quickly look at the work.
00:18:53.262 - 00:19:11.874, Speaker A: Target acquired. So kind of looks like a. Some kind of machine here. You know what this references is? It Raul. I'm sure some of you guys know who I'm talking about. Raul. I want to call it Dasman.
00:19:11.874 - 00:19:27.594, Speaker A: God, that's a name I haven't looked up for a while. Not sure if that's the right name. It might not be Raoul Houseman. That's who I'm talking about. And his surreal machines. Let's do a quick search. Interesting.
00:19:27.594 - 00:19:39.574, Speaker A: Data ist. And he would. Ernst also. Back to Ernst. Ernst also did surrealist machines. Let's just put data machines. Yeah.
00:19:39.574 - 00:19:51.806, Speaker A: So, I mean, here we go. This is the super famous one. This is like attempting to call this a Dada masterpiece here. This one here. And. Yeah. So that was kind of an obsession of the surrealists.
00:19:51.806 - 00:20:05.662, Speaker A: And the Dada is these machines. Kind of just. That's a very vague reference. But why not? In passing. Target acquired. So new work by Lewis Osborn. This is a newer artist that I hadn't discovered who's also kind of in that illustrative camp.
00:20:05.662 - 00:20:21.224, Speaker A: A little different. Go go. Porens deed. There's birth, there's death, and in between there's maintenance. Talks about how humans can be repaired or even reprogrammed to become a better self. So I thought we could just kind of. Again, it's always nice to get new blood here.
00:20:21.224 - 00:20:32.468, Speaker A: These two kind of. With kind of more complex compositions really stand out. Addition of a thousand. So interesting. These compositions are really nice. Custom. Go, go.
00:20:32.468 - 00:20:53.434, Speaker A: Not sure what's going on there. So anyways, go, go. Perenn in passing, a new monster. And I'm not getting, interestingly, Daniel W's notifications. So there is probably a notification issue on objects. So this is another monster, Umibozo. And this is from Japan.
00:20:53.434 - 00:21:20.448, Speaker A: Perhaps the most mysterious of the aquatic yokai, the Umibzu's true form is unknown. Okay, so I'll let you read that. But just another nice new work from our guy, Daniel W. A new work from popple. So this is called the observatory. You can still get this, I think, using generative art and pixel art. Very interesting.
00:21:20.448 - 00:21:55.672, Speaker A: Kind of. Again with his sci-Fi theme. I love this series. And you can see kind of like this guy down here almost has an alien, like the movie alien feel to it in terms of just its vibe. This kind of like goop mixed with kind of retro old technology from the future, that kind of vibe. And the generative art that comes out of the eye. Here at the observatory, one can see the darkest secrets at the corner of the cosmos at a mere cost of one's soul.
00:21:55.672 - 00:22:12.312, Speaker A: So, still available, I think. Let me just reload here. Yes, still available. How many copies? Nine copies left. So get it while you can. They tend to go up. But as Roerich says, definitely it is not financial advice, unlike what Roerich says.
00:22:12.312 - 00:22:35.746, Speaker A: Tradscape. A little dose of reality from tradscape. Burning the rest of Nicholas in a few days. Gotta be honest, I'm not supposed to be showing my hand, but f that honesty is less boring. And I totally agree. And it doesn't lower your esteem in my eyes, actually, it kind of raises it. That's old art world, where it's like you have to put on some big show of who you're trying to pretend to be.
00:22:35.746 - 00:23:05.728, Speaker A: And so I like it when people are just honest. I can't afford to keep making these bad boys if they don't sell because they're a ton of work. It is what it is. This some high effort shit. Sound on. So, yeah, so if you like the series, you might want to give tradscape some support and just shows you here, like, tradscape's a pretty well known name, but so is popple there. But yeah, I mean, it's very real, the marketplace on object here, which is part of why I love it.
00:23:05.728 - 00:23:18.804, Speaker A: And. Yeah. And sometimes people just don't have the tazos. Like I'd normally pick up the popple. I just don't have the tazos on me right now, so I need to make some work. Sell that and see if it's still available. Just an interesting pixel artist here.
00:23:18.804 - 00:23:38.934, Speaker A: Hako control. Clear fnd. And I thought this just like this subway work looked really cool. This rooftop. I just saw an interesting pixel artist that I found on Twitter. I'm not even sure if you can buy their work. Kind of mixing the manga and the pixel art.
00:23:38.934 - 00:23:54.484, Speaker A: This really turned my head. Studio time by ymmsh. Available for only a tezos, but it's an addition of like 2000 or something. I think a couple of hundred have sold already. Very nice work. I may pick this one up. Yeah.
00:23:54.484 - 00:24:14.554, Speaker A: Edition of 2500. And how many are left? 22. 47. So 250 have gone. Very nice work. Kind of in the same style here, but a new style for slave angel, as far as I know. Artificial consciousness kind of reminds me of spagelsmaskinen.
00:24:14.554 - 00:24:33.262, Speaker A: Those tvs going into the grocery cart. Hello world. So just an interesting. Might not be a new direction for him, but I don't recognize. Let's just take a look at the profile here. Okay, so has some others maybe that are slightly so. He experiments a little bit.
00:24:33.262 - 00:25:06.934, Speaker A: Anyways, that one stood out to me. Artificial consciousness with a little underscore there. New one from Pastelet, also known as Josephine Johnson. Let's see if we can turn on the music here. Very simple work here, but simple but powerful. There seems to be a kind of feminine theme, like a woman theme on a lot of Pastelay's work. Like, let's just take another.
00:25:06.934 - 00:25:30.242, Speaker A: Let's just take a quick look at her work. So you can get that edition of ten for ten tazos. So her trademark price. And you remember her again, the woman in the teacup. Female stuff. This one here with the awesome audio and office woman. So you see playing with the woman theme as subject matter.
00:25:30.242 - 00:25:51.502, Speaker A: Woman as subject of her work. The power of a thousand supercomputers integrated into a synchronous think tank. Has a bit of a contemporary art sort of gallery feeling to her work. Interesting work by Ed Morolla. Trying to make these faster. Let's see if we can speed up the pace a bit here. Interesting one of one from Ed Morolla.
00:25:51.502 - 00:26:09.160, Speaker A: A mountain. And this is part of a new series called dead nature. Or maybe not a new series, sorry. There is also other works in this series that's kind of nice. Sunset in purple. Very nice. Temtezos.
00:26:09.160 - 00:26:27.954, Speaker A: Another work by Ed Morolla. Kind of tackling nature with pixelation. I love this theme. I do it in my eight bit pixel, eight bit nature series. Again, that contrast of natural, organic forms with pixels. And Ed is also exploring that theme here. It's a natural contrast.
00:26:27.954 - 00:26:46.218, Speaker A: We see it here in bite by bit. Some very nice new nebulas. This is an edition of five for five. Tezos, edition of two for plant, Pixel, Retina Nebula. This is a very nice one. Edition of two for seven. And this one sold for nine.
00:26:46.218 - 00:27:02.504, Speaker A: Very nice. I love the colored stars. So anyways, I adore this series. Here's a new one for nine. Tempted to pick this up, but can't buy everything. A bean nebula. A couple of pixel portraits, also from our unnamed creator here.
00:27:02.504 - 00:27:25.284, Speaker A: Let's see if there's any volume on here. Rick Ross, a famous hip hop mogul, from my understanding. This is a very nice one. And we have another one. We'll put this on full. This is 50 cm gold edition. So again, we saw these, the game boy portraits, which were brilliant, of Coolio and maybe tupac.
00:27:25.284 - 00:27:52.342, Speaker A: And so we continue the theme here, but with color. Another artist that crossed my desk here. This is Armelk, a new artist, and I saw his clown vamp. Eight bit pixel work here. He actually sent me a message saying that he found the show and he loved it. So I looked at his work and yeah, I'd never seen his work before. I love that clown vamp.
00:27:52.342 - 00:28:18.962, Speaker A: And there's a whole bunch of pixel art here. So really cool artists that I'd never found before. So it is Ar milk 88 and a huge sale for strange thing. Again, this is went to Skuny for 1000 tezos. So let's just see the title here. Apocalypse. And here it looks like a horseman of the apocalypse.
00:28:18.962 - 00:28:44.564, Speaker A: And there are three others, and a stussy logo on some modern. So modern clothing and old painting in old painting styles seems to be the contrast here from strange thing. So congratulations to him. Huge sale. Must have been one of the biggest of the day on object sweetling a one of one auction. So this is quite nice too. Another AI work by Venta.
00:28:44.564 - 00:29:06.348, Speaker A: Let's see how it's doing here. No bids yet, so if you like AI one of ones, there may be an opportunity here if you're sneaky about it. And another one from indie do. Nifty. I wonder if she. I don't know if it's a guy or girl. I wonder if indie doe changed their name because I thought it was indie Dodo, but maybe that was on Twitter.
00:29:06.348 - 00:29:35.674, Speaker A: It was a nice work edition of ten five tazos. I believe we saw indie doe do the Twitter one yesterday, so a lot of these are coming out. I thought I saw the Twitter one anyway. Maybe I'm confusing them with another artist, but we recognize this artist for sure. Definitely that piece there. We've looked at several of their works. And finally, just a couple of physical works from Santiago, which I thought were quite impressive.
00:29:35.674 - 00:30:00.276, Speaker A: And I love, again, not only multi chain, but multimedia. I love this. He's doing a lot of his style that he does on digitally, and we're seeing the physical version. I love that. And here's another great physical work from w o C, which went to fake whale. Interestingly, minted and permanently stored in the fake whale vault. Nine months.
00:30:00.276 - 00:30:19.514, Speaker A: Spray on paper, 50 by 62 and a half centimeters. So another kind of interesting crossover work from physical to nfts. Pretty awesome work, I gotta say. I love Woc's work. So there you go, another episode. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
