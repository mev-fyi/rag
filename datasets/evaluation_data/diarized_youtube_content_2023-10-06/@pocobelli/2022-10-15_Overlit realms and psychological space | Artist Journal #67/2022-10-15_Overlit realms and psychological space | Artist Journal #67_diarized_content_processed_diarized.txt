00:00:04.960 - 00:00:37.834, Speaker A: A huge and massive thank you for all the shoutouts yesterday. That was pretty amazing. The tweet was quiet at first. The first 3 hours, I think I had one like artist journal, October 15, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, artist reporter, which has special significance, which I will continue to revisit. It's a wonderful concept. Robert Rauschenberg, this idea of almost a news art.
00:00:37.834 - 00:01:04.206, Speaker A: So I'll just leave it at that for now. A little teaser. So anyways, look at this beautiful work by Jasmine. I don't know if you know the work of Jasmine, but she just appeared on foundation after having several works on object. We're going to look at her work. There's something just intensely beautiful and psychological about her work that I don't know what it is. It's not my typical, like, go to work, but I love it.
00:01:04.206 - 00:01:21.554, Speaker A: So we're going to return to that. Actually, let's just look at this and then we'll look at her other work in a couple of minutes here. Created by. With Jasmine. One from the collection, childhood memories only .2 ETH and so there it is. It looks like the inside of a bus.
00:01:21.554 - 00:01:53.902, Speaker A: Very psychological art and art of the present. Beautifully done. Looks japanese. The writing here, I would guess, and some little floaty things to just give it that extra special magic. You got the, like JG Ballard, he was huge on the novelist who I consistently reference pretty often here. He was huge on like the psychology and the almost the anthropology of like the ATM machine. And we see it here with the bus ticket machine.
00:01:53.902 - 00:02:27.098, Speaker A: So we're gonna, I'm gonna show you like this over lit realm, which is kind of. That's what. How Ballard would refer to Dali's work, Salvador Dali. And if you're looking for the best essay on Salvador Dali out there, I would say by a, by a country mile. It is JG Ballard's essay sometimes found at the beginning of Diary of a genius by Salvador Dali. They'll put Ballard's the Art of Salvador Dali a one of the great essays, I'd argue over the last 5000 years. Anyway, enough of that.
00:02:27.098 - 00:02:47.986, Speaker A: So let's quickly go through this again, a ton to get through and some huge thank yous. And I could say thank you to a million people here, but that would take too long. But limbo, I think, probably had the best or like the most excited. Let's put it a tweet. And I totally appreciate it. So never miss a pokebelly episode. Never in capital letters.
00:02:47.986 - 00:03:05.454, Speaker A: So thank you, Limbo. Thank you to popple. I mean, half the artists chimed in measureless. I'm going to miss people here. But Hercules, that awesome computer artists and more. I mean, so anyways, it means a lot here. It's just a.
00:03:05.454 - 00:03:23.602, Speaker A: It's very encouraging. So thank you. What a great community. You know, that's what Damien Hirst was kind of alluding to, you know, like a big thumbs up to the community is what he was giving when he went all in in NFTs. And we could question that and everything. But anyway, we've already discussed that. Go to previous episodes.
00:03:23.602 - 00:03:54.634, Speaker A: Another big thank you to digital bobbles for picking up a remix of Rafael Madonna here from the related images series. So, yeah, so thank you. One of, one very proud of this series and just wanted to give you a big shout out. So there's no twitter. So I thought I'd do it here. So just some little news items before we look at some art. So this art basel thing is happening in Paris.
00:03:54.634 - 00:04:28.294, Speaker A: This is like a new Paris plus art Basel. And FX hash and Tezos continue to partner with Art Basel. So it's just kind of interesting. This is this week coming up here, October 20 to 23rd for join us for state of the art, a generative art exhibition presented by Tezos. So all to say, I mean, you have Tezos out there promoting its art. So even if you're on ETH, I think it's always, I'm kind of a multi chain kind of guy. I try not to be tribal with all these things.
00:04:28.294 - 00:05:04.114, Speaker A: And so you might as well just have a foot in the Tazo store if people are out there promoting it at Art Basel. That's sort of my take. So I love both. I love being on ETH and a lot of people do. I mean, we've already had that discussion featuring our live minting experience and richly printed works by William Apan Zankan and curation by tender art. So I actually brought up their twitters just so we'd have a clue. So this is William Mappano just to see what they're featuring and highlighting color study, painting frame by frame, a processing sketch made a while ago.
00:05:04.114 - 00:05:26.264, Speaker A: And this is what I wanted to got to see and sign the prints before they come to Paris. So I'm not sure. I think this is, you see William Mappan. So pretty awesome. So I wonder if this is generative art that's printed or what. But look at these prints. They look pretty spectacular.
00:05:26.264 - 00:05:58.330, Speaker A: If you're wanting to purchase a print, please dm me or we are unit London. They've been around for a bit. 500 pounds. So there it is, excluding that. And here's another of the artists that are going to be featured there in that generative art show. So we've also seen this artist with the plotter, right? This is a single line drawing using only this link. So this was probably created digitally and then rendered physically with a pen plotter.
00:05:58.330 - 00:06:42.908, Speaker A: So I'm very big on this transition. That work I showed you before, the Raphael Madonna. My solution for this is, like I have, because a lot of digital artists were trying to figure out how to make things physical for a long time, because there was no money in digital till two or three years ago. Okay. And a lot of us have been around a little longer. So my solution here is I actually do a digital print of this underlying work, and then I'll screen print in order to get that sharp contrast, because I've tried painting it, and it's just tedious and it's self defeating. But if you screen print this, and I have versions over there, I didn't plan on talking about this, and they screen print the color over top.
00:06:42.908 - 00:07:25.196, Speaker A: So I have my little physical solution. So it's always fun to think about as a digital artist is what is your physical solution? Because it actually becomes a different iteration of the art. So it's just a very fun thing, and it makes it a different piece, because, as you all know, I'm not a huge fan of, say, having a physical work, taking a photo or a scan and then selling that as an NFT. But if you make a digital work, render it as a. And then, you know, mint it, and then you have your solution, your physical solution, like here, like we see here, then I'm kind of all for it. I am all for it. And because it's a different.
00:07:25.196 - 00:07:52.184, Speaker A: Because in both cases, the digital artwork is the work, right, that original one. And then when you do a physical rendition, which is going to be slightly different because it's a physical rendition, those screen prints I make will not be perfect. And so they become their own thing. That is the art. So that's kind of my take on it. And then here is the curator, tender art. And so I'm not exactly sure.
00:07:52.184 - 00:08:20.482, Speaker A: So they curated some stuff on art blocks, and I brought up one of them. So just kind of some cool work here. So anyways, just to keep you in the loop of what's happening at Paris art Basel Tezos, a beautiful work here. Our friend Rat Cloaksee, now Metamorphius, continues to shock and awe with beautiful work. And look at these colors and then his trademark. I didn't realize this is rat cloak. See, at first, because I saw metamorpheus, I'm like, hey, that's the rat cloak.
00:08:20.482 - 00:08:37.754, Speaker A: See? Style. So anyways, really cool. Nice work in progress there. That is coming another work in progress from zero x three y three. I just thought it was kind of a cool pixel gif here. Never heard. I just saw a retweet and I thought, hey, that's cool.
00:08:37.754 - 00:08:57.553, Speaker A: So that is. See you all here tomorrow. So maybe that is going to be minted today. And also, this was just kind of interesting. So just a little bit of works in progress before we get back to jasmine. This is pure casa de bag. Current art experiment is about designing a system to use all outputs from an algo.
00:08:57.553 - 00:09:26.728, Speaker A: The starting point was a not so well tuned algo giving 40% of bland outputs. But some manual assembly between bland and great outputs gave even greater results. And I agree, these results are pretty nice. So I'm assuming this is some kind of generative art. And I think it's pretty good looking stuff. Like, I don't know the exact situation here. And you see the writing is vertical here or going sideways, and here it's underneath.
00:09:26.728 - 00:09:48.934, Speaker A: So I just thought, you know, creative coding. And we're back to plotter. So this looks like it was made on a plotter. So I've never used a plotter, but I tell you, the more I see this plotter stuff, I don't know if you know Arno Beck. He is a great. Maybe we bring up instagram quickly if I can find him. Arnobach.
00:09:48.934 - 00:10:04.034, Speaker A: Let's see if. Yeah, so he is a great pen plotter. And here we go. He also uses the typewriter. Look at this typewriter drawing. If you don't know Arno Beck, here's another artist for you guys, a great contemporary artist. I was actually.
00:10:04.034 - 00:10:35.202, Speaker A: I met him about a year and a couple of months ago at the Berlin Art Fair. He was with Wolf laser from the digital art museum. And they just had a booth and they had some Arno Beck's art. And I was like, telling them, like, guys, what about nfts? What's going on? And there wasn't much going on. Like, Wolf was actually quite skeptical of the whole nft thing. So, I mean, that was a year and two months ago, so I'm kind of curious to talk to him, but. Okay, so we're going to look at some plotter work very quickly.
00:10:35.202 - 00:10:55.356, Speaker A: I don't want this show to go on forever here. Okay, so here is some. So pen plotter work. Okay. You see the super Mario thing. So if you're trying to get that sharp pixelation, it's like plotter or screen print. Plotter might be easier because screen print, you have all the registration stuff, and so.
00:10:55.356 - 00:11:15.302, Speaker A: And then I think plotter might be a little funner. It depends on the case. Like, those works I was showing you earlier, the Raphael Madonna, I think that's better. Screen print stuff like this is definitely better with plotter. So just some interesting kind of, you know, technique, tools business. So here's Jasmine's work. Okay.
00:11:15.302 - 00:12:02.150, Speaker A: And this work jumped out at me, like, a few months ago. And again, it's not my typical work classroom, but I just found it very psychologically powerful. And it's probably the light, but it's maybe the empty rooms. And I'm kind of back to Ballard, this kind of anthropological sort of vibe, where I put it this way, I'm kind of tempted to go in like a detective and try and find out, try and assemble the psychology of the people who lived and existed in this space from the objects in this space. That's what Jasmine's work does for me. So, again, it kind of becomes about humanity, you know, like these kind of. Like, there's just something about her work.
00:12:02.150 - 00:12:35.606, Speaker A: And we have more of it, this boardroom that I, you know, with these laptops. And it just makes you wonder, what are these people all about? You know, it just brings out my inner detective, and you see they're beautiful as well. Again, these over lit works, we're back to back. I use that as a reference to Ballard describing Dali. And we're going to look at a dali in a second here, the most famous. Again, this overlit realm creating these psychological shadows. Dali was big on very long shadows.
00:12:35.606 - 00:13:11.336, Speaker A: Right? Which creates this, again, a psychological work. And that's what I feel here. I just feel like it's anthropological or even archaeological. If you were to look 700 years from now, and then this came, you took this out of the ground, and you're an alien species, and you're trying to figure out what these people were about. You could start to put together a psychology based on these objects and this architecture. So, yeah, so just one or two more here, and a lot of light here. Again, this light in the shadow just makes it very powerful.
00:13:11.336 - 00:13:31.320, Speaker A: Food. Food. So, big fan of her work. Here's a train station. So I'm always kind of amazed at how train stations look. I mean, this could be in Europe, but it's also in maybe Tokyo or something. And I've also seen train stations rendered from art here in America.
00:13:31.320 - 00:14:10.326, Speaker A: They all kind of look the same. So again, this over lit realm in the back here, and then this strong dark shadow in the persistence of memory. Of course, at the Moma, for those that don't know, like, most of you will have seen this, I assume, or obviously know about it, but this is a very small painting. That was what was the most interesting thing before I had ever seen it. This is a 30 centimeter wide painting, which kind of puts a whole new spin on the whole thing. And you see just the detail in here, you know, time melting. Some people want to put, like an einsteinian, like, spacetime, quantum physics sort of thing, which probably is part of this.
00:14:10.326 - 00:14:46.014, Speaker A: There's a lot of Freud, this embryo, and then time being eaten by these insects. And Ballard, finally on this, the intrusion of three dimensional space with this mysterious rectangle here. So psychological space is kind of the theme here. And then this kind of almost hallucinatory cliff over here reminds me of Greece a lot. And again, this overlit realm background where almost the horizon line disappears, this egg. And on and on we could go, look at this. Fantastic work, guys.
00:14:46.014 - 00:15:01.202, Speaker A: The punisher I magically turned on. I saw this posted on Twitter. Everybody's like, oh, I missed it. Haiti Rockette, one of our favorites here. Glitchrom. Nintendo glitchrom. Just love this work.
00:15:01.202 - 00:15:15.968, Speaker A: And I lucked out. There are only four of them. Haiti owns three. And there was a flipper who was just happy to get twelve tezos. And I thought, wow. So, yeah, so I picked it up. 1269 there.
00:15:15.968 - 00:15:28.064, Speaker A: There was an offer for 20. Oh, and Haiti sold it to him. So awesome. He actually messaged me, NFTs worlds, NSF World. So I'm actually really glad that he got it. That's awesome. So edition of four.
00:15:28.064 - 00:15:52.814, Speaker A: So Haiti is putting out some very low editions. I'm not sure if it's because his notifications aren't working or is he? I was saying, hey, your notifications still aren't working. He said lullifications, as he brilliantly put. So anyways, he's putting out really low editions for these glitch roms. So I kind of snapped up a few of them because the flippers are selling them for, like, twelve tezos. Eight tezos. And you, if I want.
00:15:52.814 - 00:16:15.542, Speaker A: I'm not a flipper. But, I mean, again, he rarely makes this low of edition, so. Yeah, so here are a few of them. Mega dfo. I mean, this one, kind of mysterious. I don't know the game that it's referring to. But these reminds me of these assyrian mythological creatures that you often saw.
00:16:15.542 - 00:16:36.556, Speaker A: You'll see them at the pergamon here in Berlin. Assyrian Pergamon wings. We'll just call it that. You know, these kind of creatures. So, yeah, just kind of reminds me of that. Of course, this is a profile version. Here's just another one.
00:16:36.556 - 00:16:58.596, Speaker A: I picked up this one, too, again, edition of four. I thought if I ever had, like, a love romance show that I was putting on, you know, sometimes I think about that more than like. And the work's super interesting. It's super original. It's easy to get deceived and think, oh, I don't know about this one, but I'm actually. Yeah, his work is really good. I'm just a big fan.
00:16:58.596 - 00:17:19.644, Speaker A: Here's another one. I don't own this. There's an edition of three. So you see, he took the offer for 20, so I think he owns all three of these. But you might luck out if you make offers to Haiti for, like, reasonable prices. Here's a pixel work that just came out. This is a genesis on super rare, I think I brought up.
00:17:19.644 - 00:17:48.806, Speaker A: And this sold to punk 8745. Let's see just how much. It's got some cool music, too, for 0.7 ETH, so pretty reasonable price. And let's just see if we can hear this. So we are global here. This is an international art scene, proudly so.
00:17:48.806 - 00:18:14.150, Speaker A: This is awesome. I love that music, everything. So congratulations to Neyma Pacniat and also punk 8745 for picking that up. Yeah, so there are still deals to be had out there. Just a really cool pixel artwork. This was another one by a new artist that I hadn't heard of that I discovered on Twitter. Jean Bon.
00:18:14.150 - 00:18:31.734, Speaker A: This is Hestia. This is from Machina Sapiens collection, now available on foundation. So just more cool pixel art reserved 0.2. So pretty cheap for ETH work. And you see the work in progress. I was trying to figure out this program. I don't recognize it.
00:18:31.734 - 00:18:43.820, Speaker A: It is not. I don't think it's. Is it Pixma or. There's one on iPad. That's nice. And there's. Anyways, it's just one I don't recognize, but all good.
00:18:43.820 - 00:18:58.864, Speaker A: So here is the work. Very nice. Kind of nude, almost vaporwave colors. These colors keep coming back, which I find super interesting almost again, from that anthropological point of view. Has it sold? No. So it's only 0.2 ETH.
00:18:58.864 - 00:19:34.158, Speaker A: So awesome. Just beautiful work by Jean Bon. So, yeah, I just don't want to leave that work. We have a couple of more from Elie Lou, so let's just. This is a weird work. Elly low is always weird and actually pretty cheap, like some sort of cat ufo thing. So just weird in a good way.
00:19:34.158 - 00:20:04.502, Speaker A: I mean, again, the kind of thing you'd expect to find in a contemporary art museum, frankly, it's just got that vibe to it. Let's stop that. And there's another one, this subway, kind of another subway work, which I also, again, art that we can relate to, at least me. I'm still taking the subway out here in Berlin. It's almost better than a car in Berlin. I know, I knew some guy that owned some PR agency and he's like, proudly didn't own a car. So here you go.
00:20:04.502 - 00:20:40.704, Speaker A: So Elie lo, a couple of new works with that figure. A strange character in there. So let's keep going here. This was kind of interesting, kind of back to that, what we were seeing with hestia, that style, that anime manga style, those kind of vaporwave colors. So I just wanted to touch on seer light here. They were putting out some of their works for portfolio day, and I just think they're nice works, sort of like AI. I'm just kind of trying to consume a lot, and I'm just kind of learn and see what people are up to because I find the works quite beautiful.
00:20:40.704 - 00:20:55.772, Speaker A: So just kind of an interesting genre there. Here's another one. Another super rare work. Now, I thought this was just a still life, and I love it as a still life. Look at this. But it does move. And I'll show you.
00:20:55.772 - 00:21:15.034, Speaker A: And it's pretty cool, too. So this sold for quite a bit of money. $5,000. I'll show you here. I'll start it from the start here. Walk with me by Bastian JPeg so again, one of these computer still lifes we saw with, like, Hercules yesterday. Let me make sure there's no sound here.
00:21:15.034 - 00:21:26.754, Speaker A: Yeah, no sound. Game Boy advance. Feels good, man. Just all of it. Art of the present. Little Jack Daniels. So then it's almost like, turns into a bit of a movie here.
00:21:26.754 - 00:21:42.664, Speaker A: A mini video, which is interesting. Rug radio. I'm a big holder of rug radio, by the way. I have a lot of rugs, like 47, I think. A lot of my. Anyway, TMI. A lot of my worth is in rug radio.
00:21:42.664 - 00:22:17.876, Speaker A: So, anyway, yeah, I'm a big media fan, as you can probably tell by now. So anyways, very interesting work by walk with me. You know, I actually proposed this show to rug radio when they were taking applications. I never heard back, but I was doing as proposing audio. It's radio, but it all worked out for the best. And yeah, I'm a huge fan of what they're doing over there. Anyway, another computer kind of not still life, but someone at the computer, right? So Edga Tez, recharge, defocus and rest the eyes a bit before.
00:22:17.876 - 00:22:35.168, Speaker A: Continue. Remember we saw this with Adelia, digital exhaustion. So rest the eyes a bit. Take a break. So this is art that we can all relate to. You know, anybody that's worked in an office or worked at home. Big screen, just very cool.
00:22:35.168 - 00:22:52.504, Speaker A: Buy for five. How many left? 18 left. So, new artist I've never seen before. And yeah, different versions. Here's a one. Interesting. So ones with the sunset again, that's the great thing about digital too, is you can do different iterations.
00:22:52.504 - 00:23:07.914, Speaker A: This kind of reminds me of mecha txt here. So very interesting. A lot of pixel work. Okay, continuing on. A very nice work by. I think it's Uksin. He actually messaged me, he's Turkish, and he said, uc is Turkish for three.
00:23:07.914 - 00:23:23.658, Speaker A: So maybe you can ask around in Berlin. We have a huge turkish community, and I have some friends who are turkish. So I will ask them how to pronounce UK. I assume it's Uksin. So just a really cool. Almost goes with our previous one. Digital exhaustion.
00:23:23.658 - 00:23:48.714, Speaker A: Turn off the simulation. Nothing to win, nothing to lose. This flashing light, he does the flashing kind of in a really nice way, because often it can be too much like. I have that one of Bez, which is like black and white almost. And it's very intense. Euxine makes it very consumable, almost vaporwave colors again. I'm tempted to call them nothing to win, nothing to lose.
00:23:48.714 - 00:24:04.186, Speaker A: So very cool work. And this work on foundation. The other one was on Tazos object, CEO of nothing. He could have called this GM too. And just a really cool work. Going for 0.4 ETH by Uksin.
00:24:04.186 - 00:24:28.446, Speaker A: So a couple of new ones from him. This was a new artist I hadn't seen before. And I just kind of liked this take on the Spider man meme. Mister Satan meets Mister Satan, the world martial arts champion. They meet in a familiar place. It said that this is also our Spider man from various universes meet. You see, Peter was here, so just kind of an interesting work edition of ten, five tezos, seven left.
00:24:28.446 - 00:24:52.334, Speaker A: So kind of largely undiscovered here. But I thought it had a really nice feel to it. You see, the Spider man costume here and the web. Pretty hilarious. Here's some of his other work. Again, this is pension, the part of world culture. Just interesting part of this retired Satan series.
00:24:52.334 - 00:25:04.866, Speaker A: And you can see just. Yeah, so he's done it a few times. Nice work. Bye. For 19. Watching the rumble in the jumble in the jungle. Rematch or match? So just cool.
00:25:04.866 - 00:25:29.992, Speaker A: Reminds me of our friend Daniel W, who continues his weird and terrifying creature series, which I'm just loving. And this is a. What is this? Vodja noi. He from the water. This is from Russia. It's a water spirit from russian, czech and slovak folklore. How is this doing? Buy for 230 and you still got about half of them left, so.
00:25:29.992 - 00:25:49.184, Speaker A: Yeah, look at Daniel W go. So another cool series again. He did the mushrooms series, the fungus among us, which I loved. I bought every one of those. I'm tempted to pick these up. Just another work from evil machine, which I thought was kind of interesting. Kind of intense, but just kind of interesting.
00:25:49.184 - 00:26:09.880, Speaker A: What is this called? Metaphysical manifestation of relaxation. Sometimes it's better not to think about it too much, friend. And we might remember them from the watch, the apple watch, which was really interesting. That's going for 25 now. I'm not sure if I picked that up. I hope I did. Just an interesting surrealist.
00:26:09.880 - 00:26:30.004, Speaker A: I'm trying to think of who this reminds me of. Maybe if, you know, there's a. But this kind of reminds me of someone. So this is by recatio. It's called unconscious mind. So this has surrealism written all over it. It's on foundation, which is ethereum.
00:26:30.004 - 00:26:41.834, Speaker A: Look at this. 0.10.20. .20.23 so selling beautifully. Really nice work. I just liked it a lot. So, selling well.
00:26:41.834 - 00:26:53.994, Speaker A: This is kind of a win win. It's cheap for the collector, it's cheap for the artist. Let me just. I think we had this. Yeah. So you get a closer look here. So just interesting, you know, I just.
00:26:53.994 - 00:27:15.094, Speaker A: Very attractive psychological work. Quila Nina. I'm not sure if this is a digital work or not, but I love it. Again, back to this surrealism. She's very good at doing this kind of. I almost want to call it like, mystical painting. It's kind of halfway between surrealism and like, what I'd call, like Alex Gray, you know, visionary art.
00:27:15.094 - 00:27:39.020, Speaker A: This person coming out sideways. She's just got something and I don't know what it is. She's been working on procreate. I'm not sure if this is procreate or an acrylic painting, which is what she normally does in these. Awesome. I guess that's a poncho. Is that what you'd call it? And this burning, just a really, really, really nice work.
00:27:39.020 - 00:28:04.384, Speaker A: So I hope this is on procreate. Just exciting. Again, Minta with this theme. I love the screenshot as portrait. This screenshot as portrait. I have a series, secret history of world War three, which is screenshots. That's kind of my portrait of the mass of mass psychology of the mass psyche, sometimes called the popular psyche.
00:28:04.384 - 00:28:16.748, Speaker A: That is where I'm going with that series. And I just see a similar. That's why I keep coming back to Minta's thing. I love conceptually what's going on. And they're pretty too. So really nice style. Her portrait of Napoleon tez.
00:28:16.748 - 00:28:38.020, Speaker A: Again, the screenshot es portrait. So just very cool work. Nice. And this was interesting too, from someone called Dehy science art. And this just reminded me of. It's Arkham Boldo, the guy who put together the fruits that make the face. This is different, though, but you can almost see an influence here.
00:28:38.020 - 00:28:56.904, Speaker A: I brought some up and I'm not sure when he lived. Arkim Boldo. I feel like we should know this. We'll just quickly look at and say, like, look at how old he is. Born 1527 Milan. Italian painter. Interesting.
00:28:56.904 - 00:29:18.084, Speaker A: No, I don't want to subscribe. So anyways, Arkham Boldo. So it kind of gives you, you know, you can see a clear, I would assume, influence, but still his own. Very much so. Looks like AI. We have some more AI work here. Another work by Lily Elo, who's doing really well.
00:29:18.084 - 00:30:02.272, Speaker A: She was in the top ten of object, I think, just yesterday. So her work is selling really well. And I continues to be really interesting. Cuba Stream created by Lily Illo with AI 2022 australian artists stable diffusion Dali so you also see this a lot with AI artists where they're using multiple tools. Remember strange thing from 20 episodes ago now, probably where he would say he would make it in mid journey, and then he would do edits, like removing a hand or changing a hand in Delhi. I assume he uses stable diffusion too. So another work by Lily Illo.
00:30:02.272 - 00:30:18.232, Speaker A: I think we might have looked at this one, but it was just such a nice work. There's nothing wrong with looking at works again. And here is some of her other work. I think we looked at that one too. This golden hour one, one of one. Let's just see what. It sold for 51 at auction.
00:30:18.232 - 00:30:37.864, Speaker A: So it was a minimum of 50 and it sold for 51. But that is money in the bank. And as you see, a lot of these AI artists are pretty prolific. But look at this. So very cool. Geometric, surreal, multicolored, you know? So you see what AI art is producing here. Very interesting.
00:30:37.864 - 00:31:01.816, Speaker A: One more time. Has another work. Again, kind of has this japanese woodcut theme a little bit for kind of vibe AI art. Ha. Hermit apart six. And I think I. Yeah, so you see, it's kind of got that japanese vibe, you know, or japanese print or something.
00:31:01.816 - 00:31:21.468, Speaker A: I'm sure you recognize the style peaks and. Yeah, so I'll let you look at that. But, yeah, one more time. Here we go. Cool artist again, these landscapes kind of blending into each other. Kind of reminds me of Javier Tomeo and the Tempest by Nero. I'm not sure.
00:31:21.468 - 00:31:46.004, Speaker A: I think this is an AI artist. I think Clownvamp might have highlighted Nero Scarface's work, but it might not be. So I'm not positive on it. I thought it was just kind of interesting to look at brazilian artist here, and they are on foundation. And that, my friends, is your episode finally. Thank you for watching. Until next time, take care.
