00:00:07.840 - 00:00:29.554, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 5, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokobelli, and I welcome you back. I am back. As Minta says, he's always back. I totally appreciate that. Love those tweets. Embarrassed for my own tweets of the weekend, but we can just delete that and forget that ever happened.
00:00:29.554 - 00:00:51.366, Speaker A: Yeah, be careful. I'm terrible with that, by the way, with drinking and tweeting. Terrible. So that's why I don't drink too much. But I was at a wedding, and the champagne was flowing, and the wine was flowing, and of course, you know, you just are. 7 hours later, the bacchanal called a wedding, and. Yeah.
00:00:51.366 - 00:01:13.312, Speaker A: So, anyways, it was fabulous. Bad and bad. And we went to the baths yesterday, me and my friend Florian on the way out, and I highly recommend it. It was €32 and kind of a. I don't want to call it once in a lifetime, but I mean, fascinating. I mean, it's meticulously run. I thought I must have used more than €32 of energy with the saunas.
00:01:13.312 - 00:01:40.700, Speaker A: I mean, the pools. And they take you from. They start you at light sauna, and then you go to, like, four other saunas that progressively get hotter, and then you go into water. That's about that temperature of the last sauna. And then it progressively gets colder till you're in the ice pool at the very end, where you're lucky if you can dunk your head three times and get out of there. And that's how it works. So, anyways, highly recommend that a lot's happened.
00:01:40.700 - 00:02:03.660, Speaker A: I picked up a couple of rat cloaksies on the way out. Let's actually quickly talk about that first, and then we'll get back to AI art, which I think is this piece I've seen in a couple of collections already this morning. It was minted yesterday. We'll get to it, because I think there's some interesting stuff. I picked this up on the way out for 180, and I think I'm overpaying. Not because of the quality of the art. I think I'm getting steals here.
00:02:03.660 - 00:02:27.604, Speaker A: But I paid 180 for this because I was starting to see rat cloak sees go. Let's look. I think I brought up the activity. I mean, he's had such a couple of days here, and I don't mean to always talk about the same artists, either. I just want to let everybody know, because I've actually got a tweet or two. Not many, but a couple. Hey, why don't you profile this person? Yeah, I mean, I don't know how I feel about it, actually.
00:02:27.604 - 00:02:53.600, Speaker A: But if I like the work, and especially if I already own the work, then of course and everything. But anyways, I'm just glad we're all back here and that we're talking about art and that's all that matters. So just eye on the prize, which is just making something interesting. It's an artist's journal. Welcome to my public diary. Okay, so, interestingly, he's selling some of these effects hashes. Um, so this is.
00:02:53.600 - 00:03:14.648, Speaker A: Okay, that's because that was a few days ago. Um, yeah, I. Yeah, I saw that this one of one here went for 160, and I was like, ooh, this is getting more expensive. I think we talked about it last episode or the one before. So I was like, I should pick.
00:03:14.696 - 00:03:15.284, Speaker B: Up.
00:03:17.764 - 00:04:09.476, Speaker A: These rat cloak seeds before they're gone. So I spent 180. I might be overpaying, guys, because we'll talk about web links a little bit, who might be watching this program he's getting, or she, who knows? Web links is getting some pretty good deals here by making offers, and I generally don't like to make offers just as an artist, you know, if I'm selling something for as little as $50, and then someone makes it for 30, it's kind of, you know, nobody's living off this, really, but I think that's going to change really soon for a lot of these artists, hopefully all of us. Once in a while, I'll do an offer if it's outrageously high the price. But anyways, it's not a judgment on offers, either. Just as an artist, I generally don't do it. But, I mean, there are deals to be had.
00:04:09.476 - 00:04:42.160, Speaker A: And you know what? I may have overpaid, like, 400 tezos in the last week. Okay, do I mind? Well, whatever is how I'd put it. Like, of course everybody wants to get a better deal. Who doesn't? But at the same time, it could have stimulated a lot of buying because I picked up these two. This beautiful work here, victory craft. Just another spectacular work which many of you have seen, Microsoft paint work. You know, we don't want to go through all the rat cloak sees too quickly.
00:04:42.160 - 00:05:06.014, Speaker A: Like, we'll always come back to these works, you know, don't worry, guys. This is a daily thing. In theory. In theory, with me taking days off whenever I can't, can't make it here. And I also wanted to pick up this, which I picked up for 85. And because I thought it paired really well with this other Magritte. Again, I always have this gallery in my mind to see this kind of Magritte inspired work.
00:05:06.014 - 00:05:35.688, Speaker A: And so I thought, you know what? I kind of want to get this other one. And I'll just show you the original Magritte, if we can find it. I don't know if we can find it. Let's just go here. Magreet, I maybe was it in meet. So we see the original of the bird there. Here it is.
00:05:35.688 - 00:06:01.580, Speaker A: Okay, so, well, actually, no, that's someone parroting a Magritte. Here we go. This is the famous. So another classic sort of Magritte move with our tiny Wikipedia image here. This is outrageous, by the way, that all this is happening. Google, Wikipedia, whoever's doing these tiny. This is outrageous from a purely art education point of view.
00:06:01.580 - 00:06:23.506, Speaker A: Here we have the Internet. I mean, just to point it out. Here we have the Internet. We finally can share the world's information. And then we're sharing 300 pixel images because we can't get along, basically, because someone wants their take. Okay, it's outrageous. Okay, so here we see kind of this eye in the meat.
00:06:23.506 - 00:06:44.906, Speaker A: Now, it would be great if we had the title of this, because Magritte, again, cozy Wareek. So the portrait. And again with Magritte. The title is a part of the work. I don't know what that means. We could look it up, but then this show is going to go long. But we will always come back to Magritte over time, because he's kind of in my universe, he's kind of seminal and very important.
00:06:44.906 - 00:07:13.244, Speaker A: Former graphic designer, by the way, but a spectacular painter. Remember, we were talking. We were talking, excuse me. We were talking about the umbrella in the sewing machine. The marriage of an umbrella and a sewing machine on an operating table. Well, that's Magritte in a nutshell. And again, Magritte, he called Lotre amens, Les Chandelier Maldor.
00:07:13.244 - 00:07:29.864, Speaker A: The black Bible. It was, like, considered the black Bible, quote, unquote, of surrealism. So a very important. Okay, so just kind of going through our show ahead of time here. So this is what I want to get to. So just the market action. Just some interesting market action.
00:07:29.864 - 00:07:50.756, Speaker A: So I picked up these two, and then we saw. Yeah, so web links. Picked one up after. And then over here, too. So I picked this up for 180. Then it got listed for 150. And again, I'm probably overpaying for everything here because someone would have been.
00:07:50.756 - 00:08:13.520, Speaker A: Was probably like, I would have given you. Given it to you for 100. Is probably what someone thought. I didn't realize someone would pay that much, which I still think the valuation is off the charts, and it fell off the charts. At the bottom is our valuation on a lot of this art. And anyways, then we saw again, web links came in at 150, picked it up. There were two sales actually.
00:08:13.520 - 00:08:34.514, Speaker A: So this show may be having a little more impact than, frankly, I might be comfortable with. Again, I'm not really selling, other than my own work. So, you know, don't. Yeah, like, it's all transparent. It's all there on the blockchain. But yeah, I'm not really selling. But what I want to point out is, at some point I may.
00:08:34.514 - 00:09:06.304, Speaker A: But again, my incentive is for a year from now when my taxes are done, and I still have a beautiful museum in my mind, which is why I bought that other one. Okay, so it paired the two magrittes pairing up together. But I just wanted to show, like, now it's 850 for this thing that I paid 180 for. At first I felt kind of dumb. I was like, oh, maybe I paid too much. Oh, well, what are you going to do? But before you know it, now, good luck getting it. I'm sure you could get it for less than 850, but who knows? You have to get someone to accept it.
00:09:06.304 - 00:09:59.676, Speaker A: So just some interesting market action on the way out. I want to take a quick look at this, at this work here, which is by a strange thing, who calls himself an AI surrealist, which sounds pretty smart too, because they seem to go very well together, almost hand in hand. And this was a particularly strong work, I thought. It really grabs out, and that's why I think I saw it in a couple of collections already today. And again, so it brings up this whole issue of how do we value AI art? Right? Because there's almost two ways. There's the collector's perspective, and there's the artist's perspective on what to do with AI. And probably somewhere in between we meet.
00:09:59.676 - 00:11:01.686, Speaker A: But if I have my collector hat on, I'm not as excited to buy an AI art right now if it's just pressing a button, because then I go, well, if I know the right word formula. And this is another thing, these are preliminary thoughts on AI here, because I haven't used the tools yet. I'm hoping maybe this week, or, let's see, we'll get to when we can get to it soon, because a lot's happening with it. I was thinking, this is like AI summer here. It's not JPEG summer, it's AI summer. Because we're seeing, it's again, like, to me, that is what's going on in the visual arts right now is this AI thing and what to make of it, which is basically why I'm talking about it here. Because from a collector's point of view, if I think that someone just presses a button with a clever word formula, I have a tough time, say, spending what I spent on that rat cloak, see there, 180 tazos.
00:11:01.686 - 00:11:21.910, Speaker A: Because I just go, well, if anybody can do it. And I'm not against that idea. I mean, this is another thing. And again, I always seem to be coming back to Max Ernst, which is significant, because I love Max Ernst. But I think there's a. But I don't necessarily think of him as necessarily my favorite artist. I think he's an incredibly important artist.
00:11:21.910 - 00:11:49.524, Speaker A: And I think it's coming out in this show of how important he is. He has a work called beyond painting. I had to study Ernst a little bit for my little master's thesis thing. He has a work kind of like a manifesto called beyond painting, which I don't even know if you can get it on the Internet. Like it's kind of that obscure. And he. I seem to remember him saying something to the effect that talent is not necessary.
00:11:49.524 - 00:12:33.914, Speaker A: Okay, so we're kind of back to this idea. Whether he said it there or someone else or somewhere else, or just the idea itself, this idea that, in a sense, art can be just a decision, a choice. It almost reduces art to a curatorial decision, which is kind of sad. Like, so where's the poetry in that? Is the poetry in the choice, right? Because artworks, as we've been talking about, are a whole bunch of decisions, okay? With some. And now there's also. Inspiration comes into the mix, but there's a lot of decisions. So, anyways, the reason I'm bringing all this up, again, AI is kind of central, and this work really popped out.
00:12:33.914 - 00:12:50.046, Speaker A: So this is a. Again, you can get it for $0.50. It's an edition of a thousand. Strange or. Yeah, strange thing. Calls it an open edition, but I guess, for all intents and purposes, it is. But look, there's only 787 left.
00:12:50.046 - 00:13:11.978, Speaker A: So this has been selling really well. And I'm not surprised. I mean, it's. It looks like a flemish oil painting, like a Van Eyck or something, right? It's got that super brilliant oil color that you see in, like, 1500 16th century flemish oil painting. Let's just quickly look at Van Eyck. Eight bidoos. Back up, guys.
00:13:11.978 - 00:13:33.026, Speaker A: You can see my eight bit nature work here. I'm really proud of this, actually. This little series. And again, I was saying it worked as prints, and I have other ones, too, that I'll probably add because it's working again, just a quick thing. Van Eyck. Jan van Eyck. I think the portrait of the couple is what this reminds me of.
00:13:33.026 - 00:13:39.264, Speaker A: Yeah, I mean, it's super famous. We'll see what kind of image we get here. Yeah, 400.
00:13:41.124 - 00:13:41.984, Speaker B: Okay.
00:13:44.164 - 00:14:14.704, Speaker A: I think this is in the Louvre. So how do we find that out? Just getting everything together here, guys. Yeah. So 1434, actually. So he's a little earlier than I realized. I mean, I believe the pioneers of oil painting were in the Netherlands. And I guess you'd call it Flemish, like Belgium, that whole area.
00:14:14.704 - 00:14:54.248, Speaker A: And I believe it went down to Italy from there. Okay, 1434 is pretty early, but we'll have to do a little more research on that. But again, that's kind of what this reminds me of. The lighting is beautiful now. Okay, so my take on this, if I had made this piece, first of all, I'd be really thrilled, because look at how great this looks. Okay, first things first. But my temptation would be, okay, this is kind of cool as an AI work, but what if I use this as a basis for an oil painting? And by the way, oil painting looks like magic.
00:14:54.248 - 00:15:01.692, Speaker A: And you could just go, you think you have to be a magician to know how to oil paint. It's actually pretty simple. You can learn in about two weeks.
00:15:01.788 - 00:15:02.156, Speaker B: Okay.
00:15:02.180 - 00:15:31.516, Speaker A: And probably half the audience here probably could make a pretty respectable version of this if you know how to oil paint. And again, if we're going daily here, guys, I don't mind actually getting into just the basics. I'll tell you what I know, because I basically took a two week class, and you'd be surprised, and this might sound shocking, and probably a lot of you don't even believe me, okay? But you'd be surprised how easy it is when you know how to build a painting.
00:15:31.700 - 00:15:32.252, Speaker B: Okay?
00:15:32.308 - 00:15:37.756, Speaker A: And that's what oil painting, traditional oil painting, old master painting is all about.
00:15:37.900 - 00:15:38.484, Speaker B: Okay?
00:15:38.564 - 00:16:06.984, Speaker A: I could even dig up some image where I show the kind of the copy and my version, the reproduction, like the image of the painting. And then I do my version and you go, oh, that's actually not terrible. So anyways, so it brings up. So I just want to have some preliminary thoughts here, just to open the discussion, because it's becoming important. And it always kind of was AI. But we're starting to. You see some other works by.
00:16:06.984 - 00:16:19.204, Speaker A: Strange thing. So this is an edition of ten. Now you buy it for 35, so people are buying it, which is also significant. People are valuing it. But I think.
00:16:19.574 - 00:16:20.038, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:20.086 - 00:16:28.114, Speaker A: And you see the Nike symbol here, kind of a more minimal approach on that one. Here you have it again.
00:16:30.094 - 00:16:30.494, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:16:30.534 - 00:16:59.904, Speaker A: So another mysterious work, a one of 1200, 200 tezos. So now, and we had other sales here, Sumi Reiuci, also known as Sumire. Look, web links is on a tear. And that's good because I'm basically out of money. So, like, we have to remember these markets are made by individuals.
00:17:00.024 - 00:17:00.512, Speaker B: Okay.
00:17:00.568 - 00:17:06.216, Speaker A: And so web links is on a tear right now. I think web links picked up a couple of these.
00:17:06.360 - 00:17:06.720, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:17:06.752 - 00:17:46.184, Speaker A: See, 100 tezos. So these are respectable numbers for, you know, AI. Now, I haven't used the tools yet, so I'm just putting my preliminary thoughts, not knowing, really. Like, I have an idea of how these tools work, but I want to just get out the initial thoughts and then use the tools and then. Okay, what kind of insights? How has the thinking changed or developed or evolved after using the tools now, interesting. Interestingly, with Sumi, she uses dally, then she uses procreate or end lightroom. We don't know the order.
00:17:46.184 - 00:18:20.112, Speaker A: It's probably dally. Lightroom and procreate is probably the order. But again, 100. And again, the results are pretty awesome. The temptation again, for me is now, this isn't like an oil painting. So if you were to try and reproduce this, it would actually be pretty annoying to do, and it probably works better digitally. That other one, I would start going, geez, should I just make a huge oil painting? Because it would be shocking and beautiful and it would turn heads and you'd probably get some attention.
00:18:20.112 - 00:18:53.056, Speaker A: Like, you'd probably get a gallery immediately. So that's. So it brings up this idea of AI as a tool. Right? Where do you stop? Is it good enough to just press a button? You can see Sumi has a process here. How much development has come into this? And doesn't matter. What if you can just put in a certain word formula, upload certain paintings? Again, I haven't done any of this, so these are just initial questions. But, yeah, I believe web links picked up two of these.
00:18:53.056 - 00:19:24.426, Speaker A: And Sumi's sales are pretty respectable. I mean, she's been doing really well. This whole series is pretty much sold out, as far as I understand. So, yeah, I mean, just again, just these are the things that I'm seeing. So this AI art thing, basically what I want to do here is open the topic up for discussion. So I'm still recovering, I think. Okay, so rat cloak.
00:19:24.426 - 00:19:58.700, Speaker A: See, we talked about and so, congratulations to him. He's had a spectacular weekend on the secondary market. Did we look at that closely? Like, we looked at when I was in there? But, I mean, look, fall of Pepylon went for 250. Again, web links. So web links is on a complete tear. I assume this is web links, too. And so I have mixed feelings about it because in some respects, as a collector, on the collector side, I'm like, ooh, there's more competition out there, especially if you make videos like this.
00:19:58.700 - 00:20:06.196, Speaker A: Like, let's face it, guys, like, whoever we talk about, like, I'm seeing my own sales go up, and this is just the nature of being out there.
00:20:06.380 - 00:20:06.972, Speaker B: Okay?
00:20:07.028 - 00:20:32.150, Speaker A: So. But ultimately, I'm happy, okay? As an artist, I'm thrilled. And let's face it, like, rat cloak, see, deserves more than what he's been getting so far. And these are still cheap, okay? Not as cheap. And it is all relative, because, and again, don't take too much of my advice, if any. You know, these are just my opinions because I'm overpaying. Okay.
00:20:32.150 - 00:20:34.062, Speaker A: You know, you might want to.
00:20:34.198 - 00:20:34.534, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:20:34.574 - 00:21:08.894, Speaker A: As far as what you're paying for stuff, look around at what other people. Because I might be overpaying, but I just go again, I feel weird about, you know, unless something's, like, ridiculously expensive, I feel weird about putting offers in that are slightly lower. But if it works for people, and if you're buying a mass, which weblink seems to be building his own museum, then, okay. Like, then, okay, these saving five and ten and 20 here probably makes a lot of sense. You're gonna end up with more art. And as Walmart says, why pay more?
00:21:09.014 - 00:21:09.454, Speaker B: Okay.
00:21:09.494 - 00:21:30.066, Speaker A: Like, it is a market here. It's a free market. And at the end of the day, you know, some early rat cloak sees. So I picked this up. So I didn't pick this up, actually. So this is web links, and then the collector listed it. So, yeah, this is so, yeah.
00:21:30.066 - 00:22:06.364, Speaker A: And I picked up a couple of these, too, on the weekend because I started to see the movement web links, picked up a bunch of stuff, and then I was like, oh, I'm going to miss these two. So I picked up these two again, paying probably too much, but I don't feel bad about it, you know, like. And again, I'm not gonna like. And look, they're selling for more now, so who cares? But I thought, you know what? Get them while you can. Which is what I tweeted in the reply when I got the thank you from rat cloak. See? And thanking all the other collectors who are helping build this scene, okay. Among, as well as the artists.
00:22:06.364 - 00:22:31.726, Speaker A: But, I mean, it's a collective effort on everybody's part here. I mean, I'm an artist first, believe it or not, and collector, like, I didn't think I could afford art, okay, until I came here. So, as I always say, like, just buy while you can, guys. Buy while you can. Quick thing. Okay? Audie Woody put out some more strange art from Audie Woody. But I just think he's a guy to pay attention to.
00:22:31.726 - 00:22:59.144, Speaker A: You can still get this edition of twelve, you know, I never really know what to make again, these 18th century collars, but he's just got such. His style, and it's kind of like a surrealism of sorts, these, you know, just, like, odd. Audie is odd. And that's his thing. Hot curry. Audie is enjoying a game by Stephen Curry. And, like, there are deals here.
00:22:59.144 - 00:23:03.652, Speaker A: He listed this for 15. This one of one.
00:23:03.788 - 00:23:04.624, Speaker B: Okay?
00:23:05.484 - 00:23:21.392, Speaker A: So. And this goes back to his earlier style that he started with, because I think he. He wasn't making that many sales. And I actually really like his recent stuff here. I find it. It's, like, really interesting, you know, with the peppers. Like, again, this is outrageous.
00:23:21.568 - 00:23:22.344, Speaker B: Okay?
00:23:22.464 - 00:23:44.222, Speaker A: This is, like, outrageous. And, like, what is going on? You know, the McDonald's, that's kind of flattened. And, like. I mean, the crazy iconography. Like, I just go like, this is so odd that I have to buy it. You know, the celebrities, it's kind of like this weird mashup of contemporary visual culture.
00:23:44.398 - 00:23:45.062, Speaker B: Okay?
00:23:45.158 - 00:24:10.848, Speaker A: I mean, you have, again, the celebrities, you have consumer society. Like, it's a mashup. You almost have, like, this Olympics with this crazy iconography in the background. So just want to say, okay, Audi's doing a few more things. This was a work that I found. I was looking at Lewis Osborne, and he picked this up, and I was like, I just thought this was worth looking at the concept. I'm not.
00:24:10.936 - 00:24:11.200, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:24:11.232 - 00:24:29.652, Speaker A: Like, I didn't buy. It's a $100. So Stephen Ong is not a cheap artist. And it's not even necessarily, like, my thing is in terms of just, I'm not huge on cartoons or whatever. All respect to everybody else that does it and to him. But. But I was.
00:24:29.652 - 00:24:57.334, Speaker A: I'll tell you what fascinated me here is I'm gonna hit play is just the take. I mean, I've just kind of never seen anything like this before. This take on the comic book, it's like a combination of comic book and animation. So I just thought, you know, this is something to notice. This came back, came out like a year ago. More June 22, 2021 has some music. So just an interesting work.
00:24:57.334 - 00:25:13.626, Speaker A: And yeah, I think we can start to wrap it up. I do want to thank. I've made a few kind of moves here. I just want to. Yeah, this sold this, this TR 909 sketch sold for 22. So I was pretty thrilled about that. So thank you again.
00:25:13.626 - 00:25:33.206, Speaker A: I've been in wedding land watching, hanging out, so I haven't. So thank you to this. I guess we call it an anonymous collector for buying that. It's a healthy price there. So much appreciated. And we sold a load runner, too. Last one of these.
00:25:33.206 - 00:26:21.294, Speaker A: And this is part of a series that I do called nostalgia Studies. I've been doing this series in various guises for like, since 2014. And yeah, I'll go into it more deeper, but it's basically about all the kind of iconography and design that I grew up with in the eighties. Load Runner is one of the first games I ever played. And so here I'm playing with the non finito in these screenshots of load runner level one and playing in procreate, which has these beautiful pencil tools. You see, I wish I could get a real pencil that made marks this beautiful. So anyways, thank you to Padrino for picking up that work.
00:26:21.294 - 00:26:48.794, Speaker A: So. And then we got an offer. I got an offer on. What was it? On the Jeff Mills piece? So. Yes, and actually there was a YouTube comment on that, too. Let's just see. There was a YouTube comment, and the channel continues to grow quickly.
00:26:48.794 - 00:27:22.188, Speaker A: Guys, we're at 92 subscribers, so we're almost on a thousand. Me looking at the rent crisis and hoping that, you know, property prices come down here. We got. I got a comment on, I think the. Sorry, I'm going off the rails here at the end, guys, but we basically got a comment on, I think, here where someone had put an offer in. Damn, I missed the Jeff mills. I've just put an offer on this for eight tez.
00:27:22.188 - 00:27:47.744, Speaker A: Thank you, Brent mantic. So totally awesome. I kind of want to keep it in my collection. There's two other people that own it, so you can always go to owners. Drew Jones and aztec nine have a copy. I sold them for really cheap, so maybe you just need to offer a bit more. I'm sort of not eager to sell, but thank you for the offer.
00:27:47.744 - 00:28:05.632, Speaker A: And maybe these guys will jump at it and maybe I will too. But. But probably. But for eight tezos, I'd probably be like, I totally appreciate it, but I'd probably just. I'd probably just want to buy it back if I sold it for eight. It's sort of like that. So, anyway, yeah.
00:28:05.632 - 00:28:22.304, Speaker A: And I was actually pretty proud of this piece. So just out of the sketchbook there with Jeff Mills, with Mars in the background on the observation deck. One man spaceship. Anyways, let's leave it there. Thank you again for tuning in. Until next time, take care.
