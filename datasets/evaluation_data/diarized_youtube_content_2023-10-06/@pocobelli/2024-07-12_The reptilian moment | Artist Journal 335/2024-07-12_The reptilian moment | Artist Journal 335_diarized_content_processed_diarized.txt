00:00:05.120 - 00:00:30.280, Speaker A: It all started so innocently last night as I went out to an art exhibition. Societe, really cool art exhibition, actually, with Wade Guyton, Corey Archangel, et cetera, et cetera. I was telling my mom on the phone, shout out to mom, I'm just gonna have a couple of waters. It's gonna be great. No, that is not what happened. Gotta be careful in the Berlin art scene. Too many fun people.
00:00:30.280 - 00:00:51.212, Speaker A: Just like in this scene over here. Hello and welcome back. Artist journal, July 12, 2024. Broadcasting from Berlin, Germany. My name's Adrian Pokebelli. Doing what I can, as we say, in the time that is allotted to me. And I don't have much time, which is maybe good, you know, as I was putting this show together.
00:00:51.212 - 00:01:14.160, Speaker A: It's easier said than done, trying to reduce the time of this show. But I think I have a pretty hard cutoff in 40 minutes. Because I have to actually pick up a new passport at the canadian embassy. So as such, I need to. I just have to finish in 40 minutes or 45 if we are. If we want to be living dangerously. So walk.
00:01:14.160 - 00:01:32.128, Speaker A: Walk with this really head turning work. For me, it was just. It was the guy always talk about the reptilian moment, almost. Or maybe it's the first time I called it reptilian moment, but there's almost like. It's almost reptilian. It's almost before I even know what I'm seeing. I liked it.
00:01:32.128 - 00:01:53.616, Speaker A: You knew what it was, right? I knew what it was. It was a Rothko. And it's almost like, you know, the brilliance. You know, one of the. One of the many brilliant aspects, I would argue, of Waq's communication is the visual communication. He's a brilliant visual communicator, in a sense, in that. Let's call it the reptilian moment.
00:01:53.616 - 00:02:26.000, Speaker A: In a reptilian moment, you know, before my, you know, cerebellum here figured out what was going on. It was still back there when we were still reptiles, that part of the brain. I already knew what it was. I already knew who it was, and I already liked it, you know, and I think of, like, that's pretty good visual communication, if you ask me. And so there's a lot to love about this. I don't want to dwell on it too long. But, of course, walk using spray paint.
00:02:26.000 - 00:02:59.140, Speaker A: And let me see if I can zoom in a little bit here. So walk using spray paint. Looks like a physical in the studio here, as we see from the background, this beautiful background could almost be like an avant garde passepartout. What you see there. And so, yeah, I mean, so doing the spray paint, kind of punning to a certain degree off a Rothko, you know, doing the color field, but in walk's own way. Right. I would say immediately identifiable for some reason.
00:02:59.140 - 00:03:29.184, Speaker A: I don't know what the special technique is. I suspect there is one that walk uses to get these effects. But I feel like I recognize even the little. I don't know if you can see that little orange splatter here, an orange splatter there. You know, there's something just very identifiable about the. About the spray, so to speak, of the spray paint and everything. So, again, not much to say here.
00:03:29.184 - 00:03:57.248, Speaker A: It speaks for itself, but looking, you know, kind of punning off of Orothko. And as we're going to see here, walk is no stranger to appropriation. In fact, walk is all over appropriation. I'm trying to think of works that are not appropriated. I guess the words. Remember the one we saw yesterday, that axeen. Let me make sure we're recording here that Axin had bought God.
00:03:57.248 - 00:04:16.440, Speaker A: Right. And, you know, doing so spray painting the words. So I guess we would say that's. We could say it's loosely appropriating that artist who actually did. I always forget the name of the artist, where they did letters. Very famous contemporary artist. I'm sure a lot of, you know, if, you know, maybe leave a comment.
00:04:16.440 - 00:04:39.152, Speaker A: I'm sure someone out there knows exactly who I'm talking about. Maybe the words were appropriated from that. In a sense, you could argue. Maybe walk is doing appropriation all over the place. Even here we see the Boston dynamics dog dog robot. And we think of rare. Right.
00:04:39.152 - 00:04:57.016, Speaker A: But we also think of the robot, of course. So a beautiful drawing, I might add. This is also by Wok. So showing a lot of range here, as you see. I mean, it looks like a pencil drawing. I assume it is. I'm not positive, though.
00:04:57.016 - 00:05:47.992, Speaker A: Like, it's actually got a very beautiful texture. And I'm kind of back to, you know, I wonder to myself, like, how much did this sell for? How much is this selling for? Like, walk is a spectacular talent. I would argue, like, contemporary art talent or whatever you want to call it, like a, you know, a major artist, in my humble opinion, in this world in 2024. And here's another almost, almost instantly identifiable, you know, walkwork. You can see when you look up close again, this kind of noise taking an image and just kind of giving it that noise, kind of fuzzy treatment. This is part of a pronta consegna ep by Michael Ceriso. Cover artwork by me.
00:05:47.992 - 00:06:40.686, Speaker A: So maybe there's an image and then walk, just interestingly, does the noise effect, but then puts actually a bit of a monochrome, kind of like a monocolor, I guess, orange over top, mostly orange, a little bit of red. These are more complicated than they look, I think, because you see the color here in the shadow, a little bit of red, and in the noise, there's all sorts of color as well. So just a lot of range in this artist. And here we see the. What would we call these? These are the japanese trading card game that is escaping me right now. Pokemon. We're seeing the Pokemon cards, right? So again, we see this noisy kind of filter.
00:06:40.686 - 00:07:01.132, Speaker A: It's more than a filter, though. Like, this is more complicated than it looks. I believe these are purely digital. I brought up walk's page, and actually, maybe it says here, digital artwork. Okay, so these are purely digital. And just finely so it looks like he's doing hilariously. I mean, this is brilliant.
00:07:01.132 - 00:08:12.600, Speaker A: Again, as someone, I've, you know, a lot of my work has been in appropriation. I really appreciate it when people can take an appropriated image. You know, the common vocabulary, common visual vocabulary that we all have, let's say they're trading cards or 911, as is down here, or maybe pictures of different kinds of weed. Here's, I think this is 911, augmented reality, right? There's Michael Jordan. When people are able to take an image that we're all familiar with, again, from our common visual vocabulary and then kind of transform it, that is one of the, I mean, it's kind of very pop. I mean, what was Warhol doing? Right? What was Jasper Johns doing with the flags? What was Rauschenberg doing with the moon landing? And all of these things from our common visual vocabulary, they were basically taking them, and I would argue as I come to life here on the spot, you know, alchemically transforming them, like, what are they doing? You know, it's. It's kind of funny.
00:08:12.600 - 00:09:17.010, Speaker A: The longer this show goes on and I'm going to have to speed up a bit here, the more philosophical it's kind of becoming about, what are, what are we doing? I mean, what are we doing? You know, what is Rauschenberg doing? What is Warhol doing? They are taking images from the, you know, mass media that we all are familiar with and are transforming them, again, kind of an alchemical transformation so that we see them with new eyes. You could say we're poeticizing them to a certain degree, where all of a sudden we're recontextualizing them. And I would argue what Wach's doing here? You know, there's dog whiff hat. So again, taking these very, you know, for in the crypto space was a big meme, like maybe the biggest meme of the year, right? A meme coin and everything. And look at that. I mean, 52 copies now on secondary for 69 tazos. And an artist here who, let's not never forget that manifesto that was put out, that brilliant manifesto by Wok and the cool website.
00:09:17.010 - 00:09:52.526, Speaker A: Well, let's go to the website super quickly, right? I mean, so this is Wok. There are no artworks for sale in my studio, but this is my website. Read my biography. So just basic HTML. This is hilarious, actually. I've never seen that, like, it looks like at first I thought these were broken image icons, but these are like, these are like different little icons from like the nineties. So a true, I would say a true Internet artist here, this, you know, like, it's sort of like I always found the term post Internet.
00:09:52.526 - 00:10:42.048, Speaker A: You saw it in Sabato's work yesterday or the day before, you know, where it's like the art critic, you know, post, post Internet. I always had a trouble with post Internet as a term because for me, it's about being Internet artists. And post Internet almost makes it sound like it's after Internet art or after Internet. But I think what they mean is after the Internet started, that's why I don't think it's a very good term, because I think it's actually the Internet is continuing Internet artists where a lot of the inspiration, the iconographic inspiration comes from the, you know, imagery or iconography of the Internet. Right? So for me, like in my own kind of mind, look at this. Spider man pointing at Spider Mandev. Okay.
00:10:42.048 - 00:10:59.480, Speaker A: Yeah. And does drawings, too. So for me, he's an Internet artist. And again, what is this? This is a meme, right? So just awesome. And so what, actually a really cool website and hilarious. Even just the way these are showing, this looks like it's all like HTML. I want to call it like 1.0
00:10:59.480 - 00:11:20.378, Speaker A: or something. 2.0. Anyway, so the brilliant, brilliant walk isn't started enough on the front page of the newspaper. The imagination so thrilled to do it here, usually in the physical stuff at the back. And sometimes it's been kind of, I've been sprinkling them in anyway. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant artist. Like one of the best.
00:11:20.378 - 00:11:37.792, Speaker A: And here's another. As we were discussing last show, this was the ultimate honor. It was one of the ultimate honors. You could hope for in this scene, which is. I love it. Actually silent. I shared this on Instagram without the audio because of course, I'm the.
00:11:37.792 - 00:12:06.294, Speaker A: It'll be the hardest for me to listen to the audio because I am. It is me. And who wants to hear? Nobody wants to hear themselves. But this was the ultimate honor here from the Kurt Hussle collective. Big shout out to Terry visual and JNk getting the Kurt hussle collective treatment. I'm just thrilled, like, putting through all the filters, whatever they do, their whole process, the arrows. This is what I'm just like, I love this.
00:12:06.294 - 00:12:18.134, Speaker A: Look at even all nice response here, too. Just brilliant, brilliant. Brilliant indeed. So cool and everything. Yeah. So on hold. This is dope.
00:12:18.134 - 00:12:36.682, Speaker A: Yeah. So just totally rad. Totally rad. So big shout out and thank you to JNK and Terry visual, aka the Kurt Hussle collective. You can buy their works on Zora and object. Another, we're bursting with talent, like in this scene. And here's Victor Acevedo.
00:12:36.682 - 00:12:58.328, Speaker A: Acevedo. As he. Acevedo. Victor Acevedo, a spanish background, but born and also actually and also mexican descent and american, lives in California, La. I couldn't recommend the space. We did enough. We kept it going until an hour and 26 in.
00:12:58.328 - 00:13:41.790, Speaker A: And it still felt like we were ending it early. It was a really, really good space. If you just want kind of a take from someone who's been in the digital art space in kind of a serious way, not just making works on their computer and nobody cared, but actually kind of involved in the scene back in the eighties when it was becoming a thing. And that's one of the things we learned, is that there was a sense in the eighties that digital art was kind of like the next big thing. Interestingly, I would argue it didn't quite catch on. I would argue, I would argue till, like, really till there was a proper market mechanic with crypto, of course, it was a thing. And as we were discussing, you can print it out on physical and all that stuff.
00:13:41.790 - 00:13:56.552, Speaker A: But anyway, fascinating discussion. We got to speed up here. Do check it out. Victor Acevedo, thank you for joining us on that amazing show. Let's quickly look at the comments here. Kelly Burns. Love this one so much.
00:13:56.552 - 00:14:22.210, Speaker A: Adrian, inspirational stuff. Great to see you back. Thank you, Kelly. Really appreciate that. Kelly, of course, is putting out some YouTube, and I'm going to kind of, kind of reviving the Pixel network where Ed had put out some videos. I had put out some videos just like on a sub stack. And I was telling Kelly, you should put your videos on there and we will grow the network, so to speak.
00:14:22.210 - 00:14:53.990, Speaker A: So anyways, great to hear from you, Kelly. Cider, if I am not mistaken, the work was previously sold for 100 ETH at the time. So I think that work that we're looking at last time that sold for like 60,000, $58,000. Remember that kind of illustration? Cool illustration. Crazy how big of a difference the hype on artists are, especially in the space, isn't it? Collector was willing to lose 80 ETH to just because. So interesting. Cause I think it sold for 20, right? So.
00:14:53.990 - 00:15:18.108, Speaker A: So they bought it. So that person accepted 20 ETH from 2021, which was $58,000 but had paid 100. That's ridiculous. It was a nice artwork, but it's, you know, it would've been like half a million dollars or something. Ridiculous, maybe. It was hard to say. I mean, it depends what ETH was trading for at the time.
00:15:18.108 - 00:15:27.260, Speaker A: But the hype in this space is insane. To cider's point here. Also, thanks for including me in this episode. You're welcome. Cider. Big shout out. Cider in Brazil.
00:15:27.260 - 00:16:05.978, Speaker A: Super cool Brazil. And we have more work by cider this episode. 44. Amber is one of the artists I most admire in this space. So Amber Vittoria, this artist here that we were beginning with, she is constantly experimenting with different platform, platforms, genres, paint, digital, physical, even Teddy's, while also using her trademark while always using her trademark colors and spectrums. Yeah, I have to say, like, I've seen a little bit of Amber Vittoria's work, I think. I guess there's a couple of amber Vittorias on Twitter, so it's a little confusing, but, yeah, I mean, these are beautiful, and they do actually seem familiar.
00:16:05.978 - 00:16:20.618, Speaker A: And to her other, I think she does abstract. Like, I don't know everybody, you know, in this space, so it's just kind of interesting. So very cool series there. Thank you for the comment, nor 44. Agreed. Rosatio, thank you for the shout out. Love it.
00:16:20.618 - 00:16:42.766, Speaker A: As always. Can't wait to watch your next experiment with the show. Yeah, so today I was just trying to cobble stuff together and it's a little shorter, and so we're starting our. It's very hard, actually, because you have all these beautiful works, and it's like, how do I leave this out? I think we're making progress, though. I think it would be great to know the artists we like more deeply. Indeed. And again, I think I'm going to just force this thing.
00:16:42.766 - 00:17:16.530, Speaker A: Ahec. Thanks for the shout out, pokebelly. I think it's important for artists to be prolific, experimental, and innovative. So again, we're referring to last episode. If something isn't working, don't keep doing the same thing, expecting different results. So, referring to the market, remember, AHEC had that comment on the market saying, you know, be aware of the market, I think was the takeaway of what AHEC was saying in Joshua Sobble Sobel in the last episode. So, yeah, I mean, ultimately, like, I was saying, hey, like, he was basically saying, you know, don't fly.
00:17:16.530 - 00:17:34.694, Speaker A: Pay attention to your market. Listen to your market. And I was saying, well, it's also good to be prolific, but here, you know, kind of clarifying. It's important to be prolific, experimental, and innovative. Just don't, like, dump everything on the market at once and expect good results. Fair enough. So I think we're basically, I think it was semantics.
00:17:34.694 - 00:17:49.130, Speaker A: I think we're basically agreed there. Thank you for the comment, Dagmar. Claudia Bressel, great job, Adrian. I am coming back. Awesome. Glad that we can help with that and inspire that. That makes me very happy.
00:17:49.130 - 00:18:03.830, Speaker A: Also on the twitter, on axe Curo. Thank you. Some beautiful works by Curo this episode. Myra Yita, I didn't know you. This is a very nice comment. I didn't know you, but this tweet popped up and I love what you do. Your YouTube videos are awesome.
00:18:03.830 - 00:18:21.998, Speaker A: It's a pleasure to meet you. Well, thank you. What a wonderful digital introduction. Myra Yita, awesome to hear from you. And followed bijou, too. Nice to hear from you. And the awesome walk with the box there, the mysterious, enigmatic box.
00:18:21.998 - 00:18:42.392, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from walk. Continuing on, just in the community, a couple of works here. Taro, my first work on Eth. Kind of looks like a physical, doesn't it? Interestingly, actually a pretty nice piece. And then you see a br. Interesting. So it's almost like the person here, and this is almost the mind of the artist.
00:18:42.392 - 00:19:07.434, Speaker A: And then all of these different, you know, again, we're kind of back to irrationality. These juxtapositions of almost someone stretching their arms. I recognize that stretch. And then some paint tools. And then just juxtaposing, you know, alchemy and, you know, intellectual, mental alchemy in action, let's call it that. And I think we have this in later in the show. This beautiful work, as Skulltakes says.
00:19:07.434 - 00:19:32.040, Speaker A: Thank you for posting that. And Martin Joe with another beautiful, kind of epic piece here. This is on Zora. These ambitious kind of narrative AI artworks by Martin Joe are just spectacular yacht poco, I'd love to see your thoughts on this work. And I would say a cool, kind of love the margin. I'm so, you know, I almost want to say superficial at times. First I look at the margin and I'm just like, wow, that's awesome.
00:19:32.040 - 00:19:46.216, Speaker A: We saw it with Dan control yesterday. Interesting piece. Interesting juxtaposition of imagery. We see kind of a, almost like a future humanoid, maybe a woman. Kind of looks like a woman. And some faces. Just an interesting digital artwork.
00:19:46.216 - 00:19:59.000, Speaker A: Like the kind of monochromatic orange with a little bit of red there. Interesting juxtaposition. And then you get the contrast with the blue and also the black and the white. Also go nice with the colors. Nice piece. Yacht. Very cool.
00:19:59.000 - 00:20:27.232, Speaker A: Thank you for posting and Louie, breakthrough in my art creation blender journey. So using blender, it was too unruly to convert to a GLB file like 3d spinner. So instead I decided to light it, frame it, and render as a 2d image, then imported to Photoshop and collaged with a fragment of an ed hopper painting and textured. Let's just see. So this looks like blender here. And working in blender and then adding texture. I have never worked in blender.
00:20:27.232 - 00:20:50.570, Speaker A: And then you end up with this very interesting result. Look at these interesting textures here. So huge fan of exporting over here. I think it's one of the keys to novel digital imagery and novel digital textures is exporting. And again, awesome. Big shout out and thank you to Kurt Hussle collective. That made my day human boy.
00:20:50.570 - 00:21:09.104, Speaker A: Also putting out one of these, another beautiful work with this little flash, the white flashing square. Beautiful contrast going on here. Part of share for Tez. So now starting to sell these works on tazos. And here is JNK. I think this is from yesterday. So we saw these works here.
00:21:09.104 - 00:21:49.640, Speaker A: And so awesome. Thank you, everybody for posting in the community. It's super fun. Kyle Flemmer KF who I think we have a work by is getting just like I love my favorite thing about this scene is how it just continues to evolve, and everybody just continues to evolve in this scene. That may be the most valuable thing of all here, is that people are just sticking with it, because then you just inevitably are going to get better and better and better and more interesting and more interesting. Kyle Flemmer people like to talk badly about web3 as ghoulish, self interested Ponzi scheme, but my experience has been the opposite. Well, perhaps you haven't.
00:21:49.640 - 00:22:24.602, Speaker A: Like, I actually, I totally understand, but let's continue the comment here. Then we, then I will chime in here. Yes, there is widespread greed and scam behavior, but these systems are actually propped up by generous, hardworking, honest people. And it is low key, inspiring, I would say, are actually propped up at times because not exclusively, like, unfortunately, you know why I'm back to bitcoin. I was thinking about this. I was thinking, I think this is a very interesting comment that Kyle Flemmer is saying, because I actually relate a lot to what he was saying. I used to say it more than I would.
00:22:24.602 - 00:22:56.026, Speaker A: Now. Now I'm kind of like, I'm back to this bitcoin. Why am I kind of loving bitcoin right now? What's so cool, in my opinion, about bitcoin is you don't rely on anybody. The human frailty aspect is basically almost completely removed. There are still, you can still get. There is still, like a developer kind of class on bitcoin. So it's not 100% removed, but I'd say it's, for all intents and purposes, it is removed.
00:22:56.026 - 00:23:29.300, Speaker A: And this whole idea, like, I see it in, you know, crypto newsletters, you know, oh, you know, we're making a new financial system because the old financial system is blah, blah, blah, is terrible, blah, blah. And I no longer find that at all persuasive because we're all humans. We're all humans. And as long as human nature is involved in the equation, you're going to have problems. So you can do it with a digital asset or you can do it in a bank. It makes, as far as I'm concerned, that argument is over. It's done.
00:23:29.300 - 00:24:06.378, Speaker A: It's. It doesn't exist like human nature is human nature. So the reality is, as Kyle Flemmer is basically pointing out here, it is a mix. It is a mix, just like the real banking system. Not everybody's corrupt, you know, so it's sort of like it's a, it's a mix. And I'd actually argue the falsehood that is promoted, though, in this oftentimes in the crypto space, is we're going to do it new and it's going to be better. And the only way I see that actually being true is if you kind of build it on bitcoin, because then nobody controls it.
00:24:06.378 - 00:24:31.530, Speaker A: The us government can't get rid of it. The most powerful military in the world cannot get rid of this thing, as far as I can tell. Otherwise, they probably would have, as people have pointed out. And I find that persuasive. So it's the only truly resilient thing that doesn't rely on humans, on human nature. And that is the beauty of it. So all of these other things, even I love Polkadot.
00:24:31.530 - 00:24:54.412, Speaker A: I still full transparency. I still invest in Polkadot. They look like they're building like a crazy machine there a new Internet, but it's a dao. I'm totally unconvinced by daos, these digital autonomous organizations. It is the same. It's maybe a different way of going about it. Human nature is human nature, and that is it.
00:24:54.412 - 00:25:16.940, Speaker A: And I have a certain view of human nature, which is, you know, we have dark side and a light side, and we have to be aware of that. And this whole rousseauist idea that, you know, we're born good and civilization corrupts us, I think is totally wrong. We are animals. But anyways, I need to, you know, we are. Yeah. Let's continue here because otherwise I'm not going to be able to. I have 15 minutes.
00:25:16.940 - 00:25:30.256, Speaker A: Let's call it 20, maybe 25. Let's go. Okay, so very interesting comment, Kyle. I'll try and keep my commentary brief here. Demon ego, you can see here the work's in big size. I will send the works. Delivery time is one to three weeks.
00:25:30.256 - 00:26:15.290, Speaker A: Other details on the page. So one of the things I love about this space is there's always something new going on. Crowdmuse XYz selling physicals the great demon ego here. So these look like they're for sale. And I tell you, I have to say from a, you know, art consultation point of view, walk, like these physicals from a lot of these, like, very prolific artists, like demon ego, credible, you know, like walk, these things are like, they're probably selling for a song compared to the traditional, you know, contemporary art world. So I think I find a huge amount of opportunities here. And look, delivery time is one to three weeks.
00:26:15.290 - 00:26:47.634, Speaker A: I will send the works so you can buy some physicals here. I think axin was brilliant for buying that God work from walk and. Yeah, and you saw how good, like the. I think it's MF the character, that one that was framed by walk for those that saw that show. I mean, it's beautiful in a frame with the past, part two and everything element lights in the darkness series. This is very cool. The series is inspired by the fact that the screen is black when it is not powered, but electricity makes it emit light and color and has a distinct, natively digital aesthetic.
00:26:47.634 - 00:27:36.464, Speaker A: So I think referring to this fact that black here is no light, I believe. Right. I'm pretty sure that's how it works. It's just there's no light where it's black, I believe. And in the rest, you know, pointing out the unique nature of digital color and light distinctly, which is distinctly natively digital, completely agree with this. And you see it here as well. So using this kind of nighttime motif to really highlight that, because again, you see it on your screen a certain way, are you going to see you don't experience this kind of light, generally speaking, in traditional painting.
00:27:36.464 - 00:28:01.510, Speaker A: I actually think you can get pretty close to get getting this, but only an approximation ultimately. Like this green here, you can get pretty close with color, with like actual paint. But I'm not sure you get it quite like. I agree with element Lee here. I think it's inherently a distinct natively digital aesthetic. Beautifully put. Object.com
00:28:01.510 - 00:28:20.838, Speaker A: dot. So we have a few works here we really have to run share for Tez official launch party hosted by retro Manny and Limbo. So it continues. It's live until July 14, so you still have time to participate. And here are some important steps to earn a referral fee. So there's a little kind of, you see there. So check that out.
00:28:20.838 - 00:28:46.354, Speaker A: We're going to see a few works now. Let's get into it and let's run. This is awesome. So Chris, Chris war, the, you know, I want to say the renowned electronic music artist again made records played by Ritchie Houghton, Carl Cox, whatnot, collaborating with Braindead. Let's. And you're going to see how pro. So braindead putting this awesome image together.
00:28:46.354 - 00:29:15.352, Speaker A: But wait till you hear it when it starts to. Really nice, kind of almost Detroit sort of really cool beat. Just awesome. Just awesome. So this is at auction. Harant and Dezos. How much time do we have left here? So started 20 hours ago.
00:29:15.352 - 00:29:37.214, Speaker A: Maybe there's 4 hours to go, if I had to venture a guess. English auction. Not sure what that is. Figments, also known as Kappn simulation. So keeping it real edition of 21 for 777. Love this artist. And here we see like the yogis all connecting with the kind of this manifestation of the soul here with these beautiful retro pixels.
00:29:37.214 - 00:30:05.606, Speaker A: Look at that sun, painterly. Again with these little, you know, you see here there's something just beautiful and even just like this kind of square video game like kind of platform they're all on and in this mountains in the background. Really brilliant work by figments. Still available for $5.74. Here's Dana Ulama ramen nights. Very cool title. And of course, I think this is on super rare that Dana posted this and here.
00:30:05.606 - 00:30:27.620, Speaker A: Look at this awesome, kind of glitched out screen here. Kind of vaporwave meets glitch to a certain degree. And kind of cyberpunk, you know, what was I going to call it? Vapor punk cyberwave. You know, I'm sure it was probably our terms. Look at this. Beautiful rain, too. And of course, almost her trademark kind of fishbowl perspective.
00:30:27.620 - 00:30:44.088, Speaker A: Very cool. So this is on foundation, but I think it was released on super rare. Continuing on Dan control with some more meat. Playing with the repetition. I love this. Makes one piece and then, okay, I'll make another piece and just repeat it. Makes it in five minutes.
00:30:44.088 - 00:30:58.580, Speaker A: It's not about how long the piece takes. It's the idea and all the time that came up to that point. It's brilliant. It's really brilliant. So that's Dan control. Let me just show you here. That's on X.
00:30:58.580 - 00:31:17.772, Speaker A: Here is NuV, 1914. El Mago d'oz. Looks like the wizard of Oz, doesn't it? So continuing to keep things interesting and just awesome. Just awesome from NUV, 1914. And there is. What do they call. Is it.
00:31:17.772 - 00:31:32.388, Speaker A: It's not Alice. I'm thinking of Alice in Wonderland. There's the main character from the wizard of Oz. There's the robot, the scarecrow, maybe the lion. Beautiful, beautiful work from NUV, 1914. As usual. Picked up for 25.
00:31:32.388 - 00:31:47.780, Speaker A: Now on sale for 255. That'll sell one day, is my prediction. There. Opening act has drubble waffle. Look at the talent in this scene. So more audio. So this is about kinda again.
00:31:47.780 - 00:32:18.140, Speaker A: We're back to this kind of residency vibe and interesting. Let's see if we can. Always has this very cool kinda new wave. I think you'd call it new wave, kind of early eighties vibe. The music in this scene is also another reason to be excited. It's a very good sign when the music's good. So here's the band.
00:32:18.140 - 00:32:36.852, Speaker A: So I'm excited. I actually. Yeah, I'm tempted to start even doing music myself, I have to say. But one thing at a time. Okay, let's. Okay, so rad work from. Rad work from the great hasdrubal waffle.
00:32:36.852 - 00:33:09.410, Speaker A: That's on object, by the way. And probably you'd have to put an offer in and hope that someone will take it. Offers here. We'll see if any are accepted. The very, what do we call it? Eccentric, almost in the way of the esoteric, in the way he sells his work with waffles. So, Zozo, don't think we saw this one. Like it's like a museum every day here, even in the smaller shows.
00:33:09.410 - 00:33:30.180, Speaker A: I really gotta run. And how are we gonna do this? Maybe 15 minutes here. We're gonna continue. It's like a museum every day. I'm not sure if we saw this one. Super duper cool. So we got a few.
00:33:30.180 - 00:33:56.512, Speaker A: Catching up on. Catching up on Zozo. Just so cool. July 8 edition of one, available for 45 tezos. So bought for 30. So just a flipper. So you can still get that for a pretty reasonable price.
00:33:56.512 - 00:34:40.620, Speaker A: Let's see this one. This museum of the future here that we are recording before all the institutions get to it. It'll be here on the Internet, you know, and if. You know what I was thinking, if I make shorter shows for resiliency, you know, let's say, like, x, I did get the sense there's a little bit of, uh, what do you call it? Uh, just kind of reduction of, uh, this maybe because I hadn't posted enough. I don't know. But it felt like the feed was being strangled and just made me think, if I make shorter shows, I can also upload to Zora. There's more resiliency there.
00:34:40.620 - 00:34:54.284, Speaker A: The more platforms, the better. You know where else? TikTok. TikTok now has video up to an hour. That's exciting. So that's what I'm thinking. Also, another benefit of shorter shows here. How are we doing? 34 minutes.
00:34:54.284 - 00:35:05.360, Speaker A: Pretty good. Macro matry. Very nice piece here. Love the colors, love the texture, love the. Just kind of original abstract here. Nice work from macrometry on Instagram. Here's rosatio.
00:35:05.360 - 00:35:31.930, Speaker A: I think this is new. It's possible it's not, but it's just another kind of classic kind of sketchbook composition from rosatio. A lot of the common elements, the horns, the rock or moon, you know, the animals, the color, you know, you could totally. You'd have no problem recognizing rosettio if you're familiar with their work. Very cool. Here's a very interesting post from Yuri J. Adore.
00:35:31.930 - 00:35:55.376, Speaker A: Just awesome. Again, like, I feel like we're getting the story here on these artists. You know, who knows how much at a time will it be 20 years? Will it be never? I don't think these things are going to be forgotten. That is my take here. Third party cookie will be blocked in future chrome versions. A beautiful piece by Santiago. And I believe this sold.
00:35:55.376 - 00:36:10.784, Speaker A: Actually transferred, but yeah. So I think I saw a post online that it sold. This might be too much to load here in the browser. Let's see. Just give it a second, there we go. Beautiful. Look at this.
00:36:10.784 - 00:36:22.580, Speaker A: Look at this abstract. And again, probably AI and collage. Collage of AI outputs is probably what this is. Collage of AI outputs. Exactly. Here's another interesting piece. This is vital, Herrera.
00:36:22.580 - 00:36:42.292, Speaker A: So more just kind of interesting. Illustrative. Abstract is almost what I want to call it, kind of very digital feeling as well, almost. You get the sense of a fill like we were seeing with die with the most likes the other day. Here's Gozo. Cool work this on foundation auction starting at 0.0 eth, now at 0.2.
00:36:42.292 - 00:37:01.160, Speaker A: Very impressive to make these kind of like $600. I think Santiago's went for $600 that we just looked at. These are really good sales in a very tough market right now, where liquidity is not seen as too good. The art collecting continues. I'm very impressed. Look at these great scissors, great textures. AI collage.
00:37:01.160 - 00:37:15.984, Speaker A: Just an awesome artiste. Should see digital collage. Should see about getting Gozo on a space sometime. This is also, like, another super interesting work by cider. This is on foundation. Hello, there needs some help. And there's the Mona Lisa.
00:37:15.984 - 00:37:37.066, Speaker A: Let's see if this loads up. So just super interesting and unusual. Let me see if we can make this larger. And here it is. So this is probably full size. And you see all the trademark cider, I think transform, distortions, textures and everything. And we have another one, guidance.
00:37:37.066 - 00:37:49.546, Speaker A: So releasing these two at the same time. Aliens. God, the path. That's bright. Digital illustration and collage. Interestingly. How are we doing? We're doing okay, but we got to speed up here.
00:37:49.546 - 00:38:15.430, Speaker A: So anyways, beautiful, beautiful work. From sider, here's Ed Marolla. Super interesting kind of work. Look at how big this file is. So working from very big to very small, I might add, with Ed Marolla keeping it interesting, as usual. Look at, like, anybody that's made digital art will see how all of these works are. Not like, there's a real process here.
00:38:15.430 - 00:38:35.488, Speaker A: These aren't things that you just hit a. But press a button or you got the right software, and boom, boom, boom. This is like, there are processes at work which for me, is like, you know, modern art making. You're making processes, in a sense, by Sue Eva. So really nice piece here. Really nice black and white piece. Would love to see that.
00:38:35.488 - 00:39:12.050, Speaker A: Almost turned into, like, a lithograph or something. Here's Saba sistero GM. Kind of another surreal illustration here. Walking through the forest. Kind of a beautiful kind of sunset sky. And here is retro Manny. Part of the part, part of that festival with limbo, Cher for Tez and kind of video games meets art.
00:39:12.050 - 00:39:40.410, Speaker A: Love the audio that you can't. You can't really hear. Just the distorted audio, not the words. It's so. It's so genuine. I mean, there's something very pure I find in retro Manny's vision. I'm, you know, the more I see it, the more I'm just kind of, like, jumping on board and, like, cheering this whole situation on.
00:39:40.410 - 00:40:23.546, Speaker A: Like, poetic. So much care put into this. Where do you see the end? And then we gotta keep running. Beautiful directing. Wow. And there it is. I mean, wow.
00:40:23.546 - 00:40:34.030, Speaker A: Wow. Again, like, I. A lot of people incorporate video games imagery into art. This is like incorporating almost the other way. Making a video game. That's kind of art. That is art.
00:40:34.030 - 00:41:01.102, Speaker A: Very cool on object. We saw this work the other day, but here's it is with audio. This is r milk 88. More audio. And again, this kind of video game, eight bit audio seems to work really well with, like, pixel art esque things. Got a lot to say about pixel art too. Here I was talking to a friend yesterday, an artist friend at this opening, and he was more out of the traditional contemporary art world.
00:41:01.102 - 00:41:25.328, Speaker A: And he's like, I was looking at your instagram, like, what's this pixel art stuff? Because it brought me back to before I. When I was starting the show, and I was like, should I show pixel art? Is this art? And here, you know, it's amazing. And it brought me back to that mindset because it's like he still hadn't necessarily made that jump. He seemed very open minded about it, though. Interestingly, tomb and battle the dark messenger. So a new one from Tom Bombadil. This is on foundation.
00:41:25.328 - 00:41:43.514, Speaker A: So here, the classic skull character, the video game palette, video game color palette. Nostalgic colors reminiscent of eight bit games. So beautiful work there on foundation. Here's Annas Abdin. Kind of a small. Let me see if we can get that bigger. So here it is.
00:41:43.514 - 00:42:06.896, Speaker A: A sunset at night, and of course, nature always working really well with pixel art. Great pixel artists. Here's Haiti Rockette posting a work. I'm not sure if it's an older one, a new one, or an unreleased one, but just super stylish artist. It's just nice to see Haiti rocket post some glitch roms. Just such a rade artist. Here's slave, I think slava, three a day off.
00:42:06.896 - 00:42:23.776, Speaker A: So new work here. I believe it's an open edition, going back to almost the one bit black and white roots here. The skeleton, the retro tv, the diskettes, everything. Really cool there. Only three minted and three days to go. You might get a low edition if you mint one. Kyle Flemmer, who we're hearing from before.
00:42:23.776 - 00:42:43.550, Speaker A: Positive thinking indeed, Kyle. Kyle was thinking very positively at the beginning here. So making some really interesting work here. More just kind of very glitchy and beautiful. I think we saw the one yesterday of the anime figure. And here is Francois's gamma. See if we can make that any bigger.
00:42:43.550 - 00:43:02.840, Speaker A: Kind of. And here we have the walking figure. But this series with. I struggle with the magnification here. So just cool distortions. Just another addition of Francois Gamma's super rich output here. And let's continue.
00:43:02.840 - 00:43:21.676, Speaker A: I do have to run very quickly. Look at this. This is Kiro with some very rich, rich glitch roms. And I think they're just what you'd call maybe a raw glitch rom, right? I saw the Corey Archangel. I should show those photos maybe on Monday. Dialogue. As you see, I still struggle to put less.
00:43:21.676 - 00:43:43.740, Speaker A: There's far fewer works here and we're gonna have to run. Actually beautiful, but there's a quarry. Archangel video game work. I'd like to show that. So I'm actually gonna try and get less work in the show next time. It's very hard, though, with these gorgeous, gorgeous works. And you wonder, like, is this like a glitch rom? It looks like just a beautiful abstract here.
00:43:43.740 - 00:44:02.096, Speaker A: Changing the colors. Video paintings, as we like to say here. Look at this. You know, just very super interesting work from Kiro freement on Zora. Here's Elbie with a work. And this is open edition. Great to see Elbie on the scene here.
00:44:02.096 - 00:44:23.410, Speaker A: Again, analog video glitch art. Great title. Open edition for five tazos. Here is Sean Luke Dawnbreakers. So again, just incredible textures here around in the frame. Interesting kind of pattern, like almost has a bit of an MC escher feel to it. Edition of seven, super low edition.
00:44:23.410 - 00:44:36.678, Speaker A: Taking offers of 55 tazos. So Sean Luke continues to do beautifully in the market. Nebular. New artist. Can't remember who posted this. I want to say skull. Skull takes look at this.
00:44:36.678 - 00:44:54.920, Speaker A: So now following this artist here, very beautiful landscape. Kind of, you know, Aizo also doing some landscapes. South breakwater of Mar del Plata circa 1983. Rad. And then here's exmortal. Also doing some landscapes here in the waves. Just beautifully.
00:44:54.920 - 00:45:15.032, Speaker A: So awesome work there. Edition of 20. And here is simulacro. And with a nice short video, this mysterious figure in the background feels very contemporary. Artye. Like, I wouldn't think twice if I saw this in a Kindle, you know, contemporary art institution here in Berlin. I wouldn't think twice.
00:45:15.032 - 00:45:31.512, Speaker A: It'd be like, yeah, that belongs here. Renki Kamikoma. And just more experimentation with this. Just animated, abstract, super cool. Here's psycho futurist, born to play. Forced to ask. Another super interesting work.
00:45:31.512 - 00:45:45.310, Speaker A: Playing with the cursors here and basketball and the spinning wheels there. Loading. And here's toques. Luminous shadows. So a new drop here. 42. I think this is if I.
00:45:45.310 - 00:46:01.150, Speaker A: I think what's going on is this is a blind mint. I think what's going on? But I could be wrong or it's. I think it's a blind mint. It's a drop. Because right now I've only seen. You see, it's all the same. So I think they get unveiled, I think is what happens.
00:46:01.150 - 00:46:18.734, Speaker A: So cool work by. And here's one I don't remember seeing combining the series where here. It's like the landscape ones here. Even a photo. And then with very interesting piece that I missed. This is from a few months ago, maybe march or something. Very cool work from toques.
00:46:18.734 - 00:46:28.690, Speaker A: Here's Keckstock. Artist I'd never seen before. Saw an x. Interesting. I assume this is AI. Sure looks like AI. Interesting piece.
00:46:28.690 - 00:46:42.270, Speaker A: Very interesting piece. And look at Pablo radice. New artwork. True face, also known as Pablo radice. And I think I brought this up. Large look at that. Makes their own algorithms.
00:46:42.270 - 00:46:59.650, Speaker A: Nice triptych here. Very epic. I mean, kind of reminiscent of the last judgment by Michelangelo, isn't it? But in its way, more figures. I think maybe Michelangelo would be impressed with that. Here is Gregor. Gregorio Zanardi. Part of fake whale on the art market.
00:46:59.650 - 00:47:12.230, Speaker A: And let's just on tezos. So a physical painting. Nice piece here. Wow, look at the resolution on that thing. So really nice painting. Physical work by Gregor. Gregorio.
00:47:12.230 - 00:47:27.636, Speaker A: Zanardi. Zanardi. And here's Babachi Mattia. We're gonna do well. We're gonna finish this, guys. Everyone here taking this car thing. Just very interesting piece here.
00:47:27.636 - 00:47:35.268, Speaker A: Not sure what's going on. Cool perspective. Beautiful painting. This from 2023. Great artist. Here's machine spraying my followers. Six of ten.
00:47:35.268 - 00:47:55.550, Speaker A: So just more. I thought this was hilarious and really cool to see machine at work. You see how she puts these? What would you call it? Just, like, the hard edge. She puts words escaping me right now. But anyways, just an awesome, awesome artist. Awesome work. And there is the airbrush painting.
00:47:55.550 - 00:48:13.530, Speaker A: Here's another one. Simo. Chief tomb. Raider. I think it's the tomb Raider character. So interesting, right? Kind of similar in the sense of this hard edge. Not a decal, but the words escaping me right now.
00:48:13.530 - 00:48:33.710, Speaker A: This I might be going to later on tonight, opening tomorrow, which is tonight, Satera Berlin cordially invites you to this show. Brian Kenny and slava Mogadin. I might go to this tonight. If I do, I'll post pictures. Ooh, this interesting artist, right? The beauty of living in Berlin. You do see a lot of interesting art. Donny O'Donnell.
00:48:33.710 - 00:48:47.994, Speaker A: So here we see a physical. Right. This, I believe, is a screen print. It was a pleasure. I believe this was a screen print, but not positive. But look at how great that looks. Great rendering of that work.
00:48:47.994 - 00:49:08.768, Speaker A: And you see here, it looks pixelated, but you see on the side, this is like torn paper. A very nice Tim Lahan here's Cucco collection. Interesting rendering of these cherries here within a Toshiba ad. I mean, quite brilliant. I don't even know. This could just be a magazine ad for Toshiba. Or it's.
00:49:08.768 - 00:49:16.760, Speaker A: It probably is. Anyway, I gotta run, everyone. Hope you have an awesome weekend. Thanks again for the support and everything. Until next time. Take care.
