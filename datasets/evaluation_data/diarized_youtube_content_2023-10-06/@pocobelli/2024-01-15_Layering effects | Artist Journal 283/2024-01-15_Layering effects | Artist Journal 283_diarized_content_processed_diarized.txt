00:00:04.360 - 00:00:35.050, Speaker A: We continue to set sail forward here at a good clip, navigating our way through the high seas of the imagination in search of new territories in undiscovered countries. Welcome back. Artist Journal, January 15, 2024. Broadcasting from the pirate ship of the mind. Hanging out on the editor's desk, talking to Stan Lee. Hanging out, having a good time. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and welcome back.
00:00:35.050 - 00:00:58.330, Speaker A: A ton to get through today. It was almost like when I took the week off, going to Portugal, where I had too many tabs. That just happened over the weekend, if you can believe that. So tomorrow's show is half done, I'm actually pleased to say. And Tuesdays are very busy for me, so that's even better. All to say, let's begin. A lot of you will recognize this artist now.
00:00:58.330 - 00:01:40.040, Speaker A: Katerina, create, who put out what I feel is just a nice kind of summer. It's a word that I've been using a couple of times. I used it in a space with Robnis V two, a summary work, referring to his McDonald's resume. It was like a summary of everything he had done and kind of all the work he had done, but for him, also as a summary, because there's his. His work history on there, which is actually quite hilarious. Anyways, this kind of felt like a summary work here as well for Katarina, create, where just everything kind of clicks. And, of course, let me just show you.
00:01:40.040 - 00:02:21.382, Speaker A: Katarina creates work, you may recall, I think I've shown this one here, and I actually brought that up. Let me just bring it up here. The horses going in the different directions here. There's something very subtle about what Katarina crate is doing here. And again, you see, like, the nude figure skating. Again, you know, I was calling it similar to Picasso's big, blocky nudes from, like, the 1920s and thirties, I think on those beach scenes, if I remember correctly, there's something kind of classical, I guess, about using the nude and also in the portrayal of the body here. And there's just some.
00:02:21.382 - 00:03:06.674, Speaker A: Again. And you, you know, doing these kind of everyday things, but these nudes, you know, building a snowman, figure skating in a snow globe, having a coffee. And here we see it on the horse, riding the horse. But there's something extra special about this one, I feel, in the sense of, you know, we're discussing, embracing the irrational. And, of course, this, what seems like a woman, not sure is riding this horse backwards. What seems to be a horse, right? And then there's these spots on what looks like a horse. And I think it's called looking backward rider.
00:03:06.674 - 00:03:43.884, Speaker A: So it's with interesting hourglass there as a clue with what could have come out of Dante's inferno, which I am reading right now. These flaming flowers here, I'm in the 7th or 8th circle. There are nine circles in the inferno. And in the 7th or 8th circle, there it is raining fire. And so when I see these flowers that look like fire, I say, quite interesting and quite beautiful. And here above is the sun. And this beautifully textured work here with an interesting hat.
00:03:43.884 - 00:04:28.034, Speaker A: Again, there's just a lot of irrational things that are going on here. And there are beautiful textures going on. Even, you know, you could say, like, the sun is up here, seemingly a sun. Is that a sun? Because we seem to have, like, a sunset or a sunrise going on here. So a lot of very subtle things going on here in this work. And so I thought, what would Stan Lee start with today? And I felt this also kind of had that Marvel comics cover this beautiful composition. Again, kind of contrapposto that balance in imbalance, you know, not just symmetrical, but balanced.
00:04:28.034 - 00:05:15.494, Speaker A: A beautiful work here. And even this, you see the rain here, or the seeming raindrops, you know, contrasting with the fire flowers. So, you know, I'd almost go, it looks like an illustration, but it's kind of, there is a visionary component, I would argue, to this illustration here. And finally here, just in the experimentation here, as we see these white brushstrokes here, but which could also be an eraser. I mean, the same color as the background here, same with the hair. So all sorts of just interesting. In a weird way, unanswerable questions are being posed here by this artist.
00:05:15.494 - 00:05:48.126, Speaker A: And so here we begin. And this great texture on the horse here, I assume, a procreate drawing. And even here with the sky, again, it would have been so easy to just leave this sky all the same color, blue, wouldn't it? But, no, there is a deeper purple here. So interesting, interesting work. And again, not clear if this is a horse, where are the feet? Right? So looking backward rider. And this is in the Riders series. This is a one of one for 20 tazos.
00:05:48.126 - 00:06:08.532, Speaker A: So get it while it's hot here. And so here are other works, of course, by Katarina create that we were just looking at. You know, these works here. I think I picked up this one. Do I own this one? No. It's strange thing owns this one, by the way. These are co created.
00:06:08.532 - 00:07:03.354, Speaker A: These other works here with Katerina create's daughter, as far as I understand, there was another one here that I picked up and she had said, I think these ones here, maybe it's this one sweet memories collaboration with my daughter from the past. So maybe what that means, I can't remember, actually. I think Katarina actually explained it at one point, but maybe these are scanned in drawings that are really just put over top or. I can't remember. I picked up one of these, though. I thought it was just an incredibly original drawing. And it's either scanned in and, you know, multiply, layer, multiply so that all the white disappears and then you just get a new layer or it's given to the daughter, if it is in fact giving it to her daughter, and then the daughter is just kind of scribbling over top.
00:07:03.354 - 00:07:40.988, Speaker A: I can't remember. But all to say, have you ever seen anything like that? So, as we see this one of one just sort of dangle here for 20 tezos, it's just kind of interesting. I just wanted to highlight all of the interesting things that are going on in what perhaps is an overlooked work. So I thought a fun work to start with here. And, of course, we looked at this the other day, another smoking rider. And again, we see what looks like a black horse and a white horse. And this very interesting composition here.
00:07:40.988 - 00:08:04.194, Speaker A: And is this the tail? Right. You see the tails here? There's all sorts of irrational components here. Look at the. Look at the flowers. Right. So again, a work of subtlety here that is easy to miss. And even you see the red on these flowers suggest there's almost like a menacing quality bleeding.
00:08:04.194 - 00:08:23.684, Speaker A: Right. I don't think we noticed that the first time. I didn't notice that the first time I looked at this work. So kind of an edge there. Same with even just the fact that the rider is smoking a little bit. A little bit of an edge there, as we see with the fire flowers in the other work. So pretty interesting.
00:08:23.684 - 00:09:01.260, Speaker A: And also this spaghetti head, just another kind of series of sorts here from Catarina. Create just super original. Even where you see the lines, these black outlines are not put on the final contour here at the top, making a really nice, kind of jarring contrast here between the flashing colors of the background and the hair as well. Here you have the black outline, but here you don't. And it's actually quite a cool effect and you see the different colors cycling through. Interesting portrayal of the nose, I would argue. Original.
00:09:01.260 - 00:09:15.214, Speaker A: So, again, bon appetit, you know, spaghetti head. So it looks like head of spaghetti. So just interesting. Maybe just having fun, but interesting. Create for error. Exe show by hologram gallery. This one we also looked at.
00:09:15.214 - 00:09:48.926, Speaker A: So, again, kind of a classical feeling in the illustrations here in the illustrative style that we have here. And again, kind of a surreal work. Like, where is this coming from? Kind of dreamlike, right? The white hair. So interesting work here. Two tezos edition of 30. And so, yeah, caterina create starts us off here, starts our week as we have a massive episode to go through here. So, first off, just a quick thank you.
00:09:48.926 - 00:10:23.784, Speaker A: First of all, to everybody who, you know, retweeted this and supported this work here on exchange art, this work from. So, just a series I'm making on Solana Kanadi surface, part of this beach series I've been working on here and sold for Tu Sol, which I was really happy about. Thank you to all the bidders. Nightman, who bid a couple of times and got the bidding started. Thank you especially. And also, thank you to the anonymous collector who picked up this one as well as the other one. I want to touch on this retro.
00:10:23.784 - 00:10:40.960, Speaker A: Manny said, congratulations. This was a phenomenal work. Would love to hear you talk a bit in depth about it on the show if you get a chance to. I really feel everything about it. You know what was kind of funny about this? I didn't think anybody would like this work, but I was like, I'll probably get one, like. But I like it. So I'm gonna put it.
00:10:40.960 - 00:11:11.986, Speaker A: And to me, that's just an illustration of how bad of a judge we can be of our own work as far as what the reception will be, you know? Cause it was actually fairly well received. Right. So I didn't expect that, but I just really liked it. And so, as far as the work itself, Manny, this is. You remember Yuri J talking about layering effects. You know, that's one of Yuri J's techniques. That's something I do as well sometimes.
00:11:11.986 - 00:11:41.960, Speaker A: So that is where a lot of this is coming from. It's taking different effects. And then you take the affected work, and then you put another effect on it, and then you start to get weird sort of things that you would never get. And another example of this is this work here, as you see here, ascent three. You also see here, because if you look up close. Let me see if I can get closer to that. Unfortunately, let me.
00:11:41.960 - 00:12:09.360, Speaker A: Because if you can see it, these little pixels here are pretty weird. Right? And so that is coming from a similar technique of starting to cycle through effects. And then you put it in again. You could put it in again. Right? So it's a very cool technique there. And you see, even just what happens to the edges here, let me just go back a bit. So I'll just say.
00:12:09.360 - 00:12:25.728, Speaker A: And the colors and everything. So. And these great edges here, I dare say so anyways, that's what's going on there. Manny, thank you for asking, as well as here. And thank you also to the anonymous collector for picking this up. Gennady Beach. I love this piece.
00:12:25.728 - 00:13:04.152, Speaker A: Again, these are just weird effects that you'd never get on your own. But you start just layering things together and you start to get all sorts of weird things happening, such as this. And then it becomes more of almost like with AI, where it's almost more of an editor's eye. It's like, oh, what's working? What looks good? Right? Where it becomes art as a decision over art, as I'm going to go to drawing school for 20 years and then I'm going to have the perfect illustrative style, right? So, you know, just interesting effects you would never get otherwise. Otherwise. Or results. And I love the color of this piece.
00:13:04.152 - 00:13:47.524, Speaker A: So I also wanted to thank Quincy Saul for getting this started and just kind of an interesting matter just on the market, you know, this stood on the market for 18 days. Nothing happened. And then I was like, well, I still like this series, so I'm going to put out more work, even if nobody is buying it anymore. I thought to myself, and so I put this out and of course, then it ended up on exchange art's homepage. And then people are off, oh, what else is there? And before you know it, you have a bit on the work that you thought nobody was into, even though you were into it. So kind of a lesson in conviction that I share here, because this is a common thing that will happen to artists where things sit. Things sit, and then all of a sudden they're recognized.
00:13:47.524 - 00:14:18.458, Speaker A: And then all of a sudden or appreciated, shall we say, and then all of a sudden, everything's gone. We were discussing this a couple of weeks ago, so don't despair is, I guess the moral of the story, if you don't get that sale is sort of the moral of the story. Let's continue on. Just a couple of comments here on that last show with that insane rad from the myth here. Happy birthday, Adrian. Making fun of the spam, the YouTube spam. Thank you.
00:14:18.458 - 00:14:41.984, Speaker A: Happy early birthday, indeed. February is indeed my birthday. February 8 there MF Doom, the late great rapper, now just doom. So referring to the guy with what I call the Doctor doom mask in the myth's work, there also a few more comments here. Thank you human boy. Great episode. Daylight Buckshort myth is great AI collection.
00:14:41.984 - 00:15:02.594, Speaker A: This was another fantastic show. So much diversity and great context. Thank you Tez tees. So remember the gloom tube work where there is a dollar general bag in there that I couldn't read. Dollar general bag in the gloom tube piece. Great selection of pieces and commentary as usual. So great to hear from tez tees.
00:15:02.594 - 00:15:22.444, Speaker A: And yeah, they have a whole account there. Tezos og working to expand awareness of the Tezos ecosystem by sharing genuine information and real insight. So it sounds like they make t shirts too. And there's a dollar general bag. So thanks for that context. Pop Lazarus another great show. Loves seeing the misbehasque at the top and all his red glory.
00:15:22.444 - 00:15:44.694, Speaker A: Indeed. And Nick, and we're actually going to go to this next. Nick from Gamma the bitcoin. Remember Acidboy had minted well, had done a lazy mint, so to speak. And there was a platform and I was wondering about it. Well, we heard from, I think Nick runs this platform, co founder Trigamma. I think that's it.
00:15:44.694 - 00:16:19.160, Speaker A: Nick here, co founder of Gamma. Love to see your shout out of Acidboy's work and would love to chat about Gamma and share what we've been building. So Nick sent me some links and I also looked closer at the platform here you can indeed lazy mint, but this is just a small piece of what we do here. So all to say, very interesting. And I'm going to bring up the website again because kind of an opportunity for a lot of people who want to mint on bitcoin but don't have a lot of money to mint it themselves. You can do the lazy mint. Finally, little cakes.
00:16:19.160 - 00:16:45.654, Speaker A: In the discussion of value in art, I'd like to add that I believe there's an ebb and flow over the course of time depending on what society ends up valuing in the moment, which inevitably changes both in micro time and macro. Indeed, it does change over time, doesn't it? Yeah, so I would agree with that. Little cakes. Thank you for the comment, Jada. Really great abstract glitch art on this one. Thank you. And yeah, thanks to the artists really, who were showing here.
00:16:45.654 - 00:17:08.564, Speaker A: We have some more from Klaus here and a whole bunch of others actually in some really great glitch stuff this episode. Buddhist studio salute from Argentina. And awesome. So thank you for all the comments here. So here is gamma. This is the platform that Nick was just discussing that I think Nick co founded. Now, here is what I so you see, ordinals, prints create.
00:17:08.564 - 00:18:03.454, Speaker A: So there is a whole thing with prints, which is quite interesting. But as far as just the basics, like, I think this is kind of the alpha, so to speak, for artists that want to put their work on bitcoin, but really can't afford it, right, because it's very expensive. And so here, what's kind of amazing about this is this is a solution, create on bitcoin, as far as I understand, and I haven't tried it out myself yet, but I kind of want to. What are you looking to do? Create collection mints. Sell digital prints of one artwork, which is a whole other thing where I think if you put a work on an ordinal, then they make prints on other ordinals, and then that points back to not exactly sure how that works. I have a vague idea, or create a single inscription, which is to mint it yourself. So create collection mint and how it works.
00:18:03.454 - 00:18:32.190, Speaker A: You do your collection, people pay to mint and inscribe your work, right? Get 0% marketplace fees for 30 days. Our team is available to support you. And then here it is. And it's that simple. Like, it looks like no gatekeepers, as far as I understand, unless something hits you at the end here. But you put your collection name so you can have work on bitcoin as long as someone's willing to mint it. But it kind of removes a certain barrier, I think a lot of people have to putting work on bitcoin.
00:18:32.190 - 00:18:49.678, Speaker A: So. Very interesting. Thanks for the info, Nick and I very likely will be trying that out. So Acidboy minted out 100 of a hundred of his work here. Undefined patterns. So that is cool, too. And so, yeah, so heads up on that one.
00:18:49.678 - 00:19:34.974, Speaker A: And also Morlakos tweeted this out, which is. And this came up with the Robnes show. We did the space we did a week and a half ago, which is the rare pepes and this whole counterparty blockchain. And I had a tough time kind of figuring out how it relates to bitcoin, so I asked chat GPT, actually. So here is an example of some of these works here that Murlakos was tweeting because Murlatkos disappeared at a certain point about, I don't know, maybe a year ago. And because all of a sudden, Morlacos was making all of these rare pepe works, and they're quite brilliant. There you see Albert Hoffman there, almost Ala Alex Grey.
00:19:34.974 - 00:19:52.282, Speaker A: Here you see Icarus and all sorts of great stuff here. I mean, so. And different edition sizes. Looks pretty fun, doesn't it? You know? And so just beautiful. Work here. Those ladders in the sky, a trademark. Morlacos.
00:19:52.282 - 00:20:30.534, Speaker A: Beautiful, beautiful work here. So just very quickly then, on the difference between ordinals and rare pepes. What is the difference between ordinals and rare pepes? Just a simple question that many of you might have, as I kind of was trying to. You know, I kind of knew they were different, but I didn't exactly understand how it lies in their respective platforms, technologies, and cultural significance within the cryptocurrency and digital collectibles space. Ordinals are inscriptions made directly onto individual satoshis, which are the smallest unit of bitcoin. This is achieved without the need for smart contracts or additional layers. It utilizes the bitcoin blockchain itself.
00:20:30.534 - 00:20:56.470, Speaker A: Content, different artifacts such as images, texts. Some people have uploaded a video game, as far as I understand, unique in transferability. Each inscription is unique and is tied to a specific satoshi. So again, fungible and non fungible. So you can accidentally spend the satoshi that has an inscription on it. So you have to be careful with that. Again, it's kind of this idea of inscribing on digital gold, but it's.
00:20:56.470 - 00:21:34.838, Speaker A: Or inscribing on the penny, you know, putting a work on a penny so that if you spend that penny, you're going to lose that work as that person was describing in a previous episode, and it is recent. Rare pepes are a form of digital collectible that were created on the blick bitcoin blockchain using the counterparty protocol. So I assume it's like a L2. A layer built on top of bitcoin that allows for creation of tokens and smart contracts. Smart contracts, too. These collectibles are digital cards featuring variations of the peppy the Frog character it has, which has gained significant cultural and Internet meme status. So they were just having issues.
00:21:34.838 - 00:22:16.358, Speaker A: I'm not an expert on this, but I was just seeing the counterparty blockchain was having issues of centralization that one of the founders, I don't know if they were wanting to shut it down or something, but there was kind of issues with centralization just in the last week or two. They're very collectible. However, considered some of the earliest examples of nfts, even before the term became mainstream with the rise of ethereum based nfts. These go back, I think, to 2014, 2015. So they do have cultural significance, special history, special place in the history of digital collectibles, and are viewed with a blend of humor, art, and crypto culture. Yeah, and kind of, I think you could call it classic crypto art. So that is your.
00:22:16.358 - 00:22:51.428, Speaker A: If you're wondering what's going on there, that is the difference. So Leonidas, who is kind of the been leading the charge, I would argue, of ordinals, at least over time, has ended up in this position. One of the big bulls on ordinals here, existing forever on bitcoin, is the alpha. And I agree. I completely agree with this. Like the, why would you want to mint on bitcoin? Because it may be. It's probably going to be the first, you know, it's like the first and probably the last crypto one would think.
00:22:51.428 - 00:23:24.354, Speaker A: So that is just an interesting statement. In a decade, everything will live on bitcoin, layer one or L2. So you might as well save yourself a lot of time and energy and join the ordinals ecosystem. Now, again, a provocative statement here from Leonidas, and it doesn't sound crazy to me, is how I would describe that statement. And here's another one on a roll here. Leonidas. People don't seem to be aware that ordinals can do everything art blocks can do.
00:23:24.354 - 00:23:46.396, Speaker A: But more natively, the future of generative art is on bitcoin. It's so obvious, it hurts. So I've never heard that. So I share it here. Again, a provocation, perhaps, from Leonidas, but I think quite interesting. So just wanted to share that. And finally, the most prestigious auction house in the world, Sotheby's, is auctioning three rare sats.
00:23:46.396 - 00:24:12.732, Speaker A: So I think the rare sats are early satoshis or early sats that were minted out, that have taken on collectible status, amazingly. So that is pretty wild. Again, produced early in the history of the bitcoin blockchain. So therefore having more value, as far as I understand, or maybe associated with, like the pizza transaction, that sort of stuff. And then all of a sudden, it's a precious. The famous pizza. Anyways, let's continue.
00:24:12.732 - 00:24:57.498, Speaker A: Here we go. To go through 17 miles, the chain is insignificant. What really matters is the artwork. So again, a provocative statement. And I actually, I would say I 80% agree with this, but I think the chain actually does matter. As we were just seeing in bitcoin, they do have their own different feelings, like vibes, as I like to say, and they also do have their own kind of artistic use case, one could argue, and kind of their own histories. So it does create a kind of context, whether something is minted on tezos Ethereum, solana or bitcoin or avalanche or you name it, you know.
00:24:57.498 - 00:25:36.858, Speaker A: So I thought an interesting another provocation here, which gets us thinking. I would say I'm 80% in line with it, I think. Put it this way, the art comes first. But if you do mint on a dead blockchain, that is a bit of a problem. Let's say just in terms of the collectability, even potentially the provenance, like if you did it on Eos or some dead blockchain, then it probably matters a little more. So, interesting there, august ground. The problem with investing in tezos, the currency is if I have any in my wallet, then I will buy art and then have none.
00:25:36.858 - 00:26:04.702, Speaker A: If you know, you know. And who can't relate? Who can't relate to that? I sure can. I mean, when I'm smart, I get it out of my wallet as soon as possible, right? Because I will spend it as I did this weekend. So I totally relate to that. Atlas Pop. Your boy is flashing his ankles and wading into Solana for the first time. Fun inaugural acquisitions from these three artists here who we recognize.
00:26:04.702 - 00:26:41.580, Speaker A: Marina Amadova, Geordi Gandul maybe, and Geordi Gandul and bad artist. And the reason I highlight this is for this part right here. It is quite fun, right? And I think with all of the kind of debates and you know, for lack of better term, a little bit of tribalism coming out between the different blockchains, to me, this is kind of the best part about it. It is just fun. At the end of the day, it's fun introducing your work to other collectors. It's fun. Atlas Pop is collecting and it's actually a pretty fun blockchain.
00:26:41.580 - 00:27:00.894, Speaker A: It's instant, it's boom, boom, boom. It's fun to use. Right? So continuing on, DJ Curo genitree on exchange art. Thanks for the bid. So DJ Kuro, doing well here with 0.7 sol bid on this glitch animated abstract work here. So that is very cool.
00:27:00.894 - 00:27:21.926, Speaker A: And again, very enthusiastic. Fun, cool. Nice collectors over there. So very cool type dart. So remember last episode, this awesome platform was announcing, basically it was shutting down and then there was a bit of a response there after. I think it was Hans posted it. Sorry for the late response.
00:27:21.926 - 00:27:46.590, Speaker A: The server wasn't renewed due to cost issues. We're looking for alternative solutions such as keeping the site as an archive and making it open source. We'll update you when we find a solution. In the meantime, you can browse typed nfts at object. So sounds like it may not be over quite yet here. And Hans, take your time to find out what the possibilities are for the future. All is good or better than complete silence.
00:27:46.590 - 00:28:17.706, Speaker A: Typed art is a unique platform. It might deserve a second start. And I have to say, like, if I was to. If it came back, I would happily, there's works I want to mint there I want to make and mint. So I think a lot of people would be using it. And with all that in mind of, like, how platforms, again, it's easy to forget that these are run by humans that have to pay bills, server bills and whatnot. And, you know, eight bidoo is used here and there right now, but not a ton as when it opened.
00:28:17.706 - 00:28:52.864, Speaker A: And to me, this is just a reminder to not take these platforms for granted at the end of the day. So if you have an idea for eight bidoo work, put it out. If typed art comes back, put out a typed artwork. I would argue if you like those platforms and you feel that they're worthwhile, in a sense, these platforms need support, too, as much as the artists, right? So just something to note. Although the NFT marketplace has recently been reduced, eight Bidoo will continue at least until 2027. Making light. I think of Patrick Amadon's tweet there, that tezos could disappear by 2027.
00:28:52.864 - 00:29:25.124, Speaker A: And I think we looked at that tweet, too. So all to say this all, like, it's kind of. It's a joke, but at the same time, it's a reminder to not take this platform for granted, I would say Pamela Cerrone on the radio, and it looks like pretty FM 99.5, I assume, maybe somewhere in Argentina. Before I left the city of Cordoba, I received an invitation for an interview at Radio Agalina. This happened a while ago. I felt very comfortable, and everybody was really kind.
00:29:25.124 - 00:30:00.778, Speaker A: So again, Pamela Cerrone. I guess this happened a while ago. I thought this was just this weekend, but it's impressive. The art is getting out there, and Pamela Cerrone, really just getting the art out there. And again, the prolificness, not just in the work, but in doing interviews, just doing different kinds of projects and everything. It's really great just to see people go 100% all out, which you see with Pamela Trone, psycho ihera here. We have a very interesting.
00:30:00.778 - 00:30:45.698, Speaker A: I want to highlight this third piece here, visiting dig Shibuya and proof of x yesterday. The exhibition is focused on PFPS profile picture projects. It was nice to see PFP collections such as cryptopunks, crypto citizens by BRT moments with the physical representation or presentation. So let me just show you here. So I thought this was pretty, actually an interesting way of displaying things we look at displays here, it almost looks like the 16 by 16 pixels, like it hasn't been enlarged at all. And so an interesting display here of the cryptopunks. So I just wanted to share that in our continued examination of different displays here.
00:30:45.698 - 00:31:00.558, Speaker A: Buboy, toxic story collection. Raffle of a physical painting a day. Thanks. Thanks for total 95 minted. So it looks like there are four of these paintings here. So cool physicals here by Buboy. And you can see just hanging.
00:31:00.558 - 00:31:19.670, Speaker A: Looks like on canvas here. Maybe acrylic on canvas, if I had to guess. So, nice physicals there. And this is through nifty gateway from Buboy. And here is Helio Santos work in progress. Something more abstract. So, of course, who does the paint plotting? We've been following it for a while.
00:31:19.670 - 00:31:49.402, Speaker A: It's getting a little more abstract. Is that what, something more abstract and so interesting to see, because there were, I think, mostly landscapes before, but we are seeing helio start to experiment in slightly different areas. Almost has a bit of a Monet sort of quality to it. It's a little bit more impressionistic, this one. So just kind of interesting. And I thought this was kind of funny, perhaps, in relation to our raw discussion here. So Yuri goes raw.
00:31:49.402 - 00:32:15.154, Speaker A: And so, interestingly, it's like all the effects are gone on this. So just interesting from Yuri here. Interesting window here, too. So, continuing on, I thought just on the Howdy doody front, I thought this was pretty interesting. I think why Sigma toad is associated with is CM, I don't know if that's chief marketer of object.com dot. Not sure what CM stands for.
00:32:15.154 - 00:32:38.744, Speaker A: Howdy. Circus of imagination never disappoints. In case anyone asks, this post from start to finish is sheer fabrication. And, of course, howdy do. Put out this long tweet here, which I don't want to read the whole thing, but, of course, was kind of temporarily banned, and then the ban was reversed. And so I think, just good to go. But it was kind of just.
00:32:38.744 - 00:33:03.510, Speaker A: It's funny to see. I thought it was just a funny story, because basically Sigma Toad was saying, you know, this is basically all fiction, what Howdy do is doing. And I put that as kind of prelude to this post here. Paul, who is a ghost. I don't know how you feel about Howdy. In my opinion, Howdy is the best villain tezos could have asked for. All these complaints over the negative vibes you feel.
00:33:03.510 - 00:33:28.610, Speaker A: You feel seeing a low ball offer on your work, that's not howdy. That's Howdy. Forcing you to confront your own feelings about the market conditions. And I have to say, this kind of resonated with me, this idea that he was a great. He was kind of a great villain. I kind of agree. When a holder accepts, one of the do family offers, again, Howdy puts very low offers, at least he did.
00:33:28.610 - 00:33:59.584, Speaker A: On artworks. They aren't doing it. And when someone accepts it, they're not doing it because your art sucks. The collector, the previous collector, is doing it because they didn't value your art to begin with, or they need any money they can recover from their collecting to survive. Howdy placed low ball offers, doesn't participate in our fun and games, and employs tactics most won't to get a financial edge in a sleepy market. But he does not devalue art. He is capitalism personified.
00:33:59.584 - 00:34:44.655, Speaker A: So a defense, an apology, we would say in the traditional use of the word apology, a defense of howdy do. The devaluing of the art occurred when demand of people willing to pay fair prices fell below supply of sellers willing to accept low offers. You can make howdy the poster boy of your saltiness toward reality of market conditions, but banning him from object won't improve anything. So maybe Paul, who is a ghost, didn't get the information that he is no longer banned. As far as I understand, it removes even more liquidity from the market in order to soothe tensions and nerves. If you don't want your art to be devalued, set a higher bar for buyers to meet. It's a cheap bet to toss five tezos on a piece that might flip for 50.
00:34:44.655 - 00:35:13.044, Speaker A: If you think your piece is worth 50, stop selling it for five and complain it's not flipping the right amount. Everyone has been rushing to chase sales for so long, they stopped caring who was buying. They didn't build a connection. So, you know, so I don't think I can go through this entire thing here, but this is. I think we got the gist of it, though. Hate him if you want, but as far as villains, we could have, we hit the DA, we hit the jackpot. And I think he's pretty funny, too.
00:35:13.044 - 00:35:36.450, Speaker A: And he is like a villain. The right way to handle it is through the art and conversations, not squeezing people out of the discussion. How do you do? I never thought I would find myself defending you because generally I disagree with how you behave as part of the community, and I resonate. That resonates with me as well. But at the same time, you don't try to be a part of the community. You've set a clear role in our world that I have learned to navigate and even leverage in my own collecting. When in doubt.
00:35:36.450 - 00:36:35.964, Speaker A: What's Howdy trying to lowball. I pray that you'll be allowed to continue doing what do's do. And one of the points that was made in here is that howdy doesn't generally sell, or he lists for more than other holders are. He's actively sending the message that he sees value in your work when others don't. So I thought that was an interesting defense, really, of how to do just a tweet here from uxing, which, again, these gifts are great because they're illustrative of what auxine is doing, where you see different kind of treatments here, different processes treatments of this, you know, figure here, this outline figure, and you see basically the different frames that go to make up this work. So just a simple technique here of taking different, you know, affected results, and then you turn them into a Gif. And there's your piece.
00:36:35.964 - 00:37:01.120, Speaker A: There is your crypto art. So just very cool from uxine, as usual. And a beautiful piece here from neurocolor. I hadn't seen this one before, I thought just kind of. I'm not sure if this is new or what, but I thought some really cool shapes here. And it almost looks like a processor, but with a few more diagonals in it, with, again, some dinosaur skulls on top. Very interesting piece here.
00:37:01.120 - 00:37:20.454, Speaker A: And interesting flashing colors here. Not sure if that is new or not. How many? 22,000 views. So actually pretty low for neural color, but beautiful piece there. Popple with a work here, 27,000 views. Of course, popple has a huge following here. What is popple at? 64,000.
00:37:20.454 - 00:37:55.064, Speaker A: And so another monster here, which I don't think has been minted anywhere. And of course, as you see here, you can just start to break down the process here. It's like you take all these different renderings and then you cycle them through, maybe change the lighting a bit. And there is your work. And it almost seems like the light is going from right to left, but not clear on that. So just cool kind of inner mechanics from these gifs on what is going in some of the work here. So, really interesting piece from Ed.
00:37:55.064 - 00:38:13.700, Speaker A: New dreams. Cool title. Only 0.11, so went at auction, I guess I hadn't seen this one before. This was listed December 14 and just sold for eleven ETH. So the buy now was 0.5, the reserve was 0.1.
00:38:13.700 - 00:38:47.674, Speaker A: And then a bid was placed and won, I thought a very nice piece here by Ed Marollo, which has a bit of an Internet feeling. It's almost like magicians in the Internet. Almost reminiscent, like vaguely of Kapman's work. A little bit of all these computers and servers all wired up together here. And here you see what looks like a cell tower and a vase at the bottom with a kind of, you know, burning bush coming out of it and an audience at the bottom here. So really nice piece here that I missed from Ed Morolla. A lot of great dithering in there.
00:38:47.674 - 00:39:38.494, Speaker A: So now, nice sail there. Continuing on, Fornix void, Tezos 28 2028, the resurrection. So again, referring to this, what's kind of become a meme right now that Tezos is going to die in 2027. So let's actually take a look at this super interesting artist here with always beautiful music and the Phoenix rising from the ashes. There's a Tezo sign, 2027, a very cool artist for an axe void, playing with that video game. Kind of aesthetic. And interesting how there's movement here in the Phoenix, the sound of a phoenix and the static in the background for contrast.
00:39:38.494 - 00:39:55.194, Speaker A: Just a really cool artist. 14 tezos. The king is dead. Long live the king. Resurrection Fornax void. And so for collectors, there may be more at this point. This tab may have been loaded up last night.
00:39:55.194 - 00:40:56.254, Speaker A: A really cool work here by Francoise Gamma from, I don't know if the 2009 series mean this is from like if this is just off the hard drive or if these are in fact new. But you see Francoise Gammer's, you know, traditional figure here, walking figure, but interesting floor that is kind of moving here, almost like this pentagon of sorts with a moving area, and this really cool, almost like a QR code of sorts here in the top right. But in the dimensions of a old tv. So just nice piece here. Nice combination of elements. Again, kind of an irrational juxtaposition here. That is part of what that is part of what art can do, I would argue, is what we're seeing right here, because where else can you do this other than words? You can juxtapose words, but it's not as immediate.
00:40:56.254 - 00:41:35.164, Speaker A: Right. Like, and you see that with Paul Elouard as we were seeing in that work the other day, referencing Paul Elouard, you know, surrealist poetry or just poetry in general, making hard juxtapositions. Right. But in image, I don't think there's anything other medium where you can just take two ideas, two visual ideas, put them together, and all of a sudden the mind will just start to make associations and start to relate the two, again, we're back to the reality principle. We start to rationalize it. Our brain starts to want to connect it and find reasoning of why these two things are related. That's why grouping in this respect as a design principle is so powerful.
00:41:35.164 - 00:41:54.764, Speaker A: So again, just very interesting juxtaposition here from Francois Gamma. Look at how beautiful this is. This is Luciana Guerra, minted 24 days ago. This fantastic work here. And this looks. I don't know if this is. Let's see what the information is here.
00:41:54.764 - 00:42:40.854, Speaker A: Not sure if this is physical or digital, but either way it's beautiful. Maybe it's a combination of the two. It kind of looks like a physical, but I'm not sure on that one. I thought just a beautiful portrait here in black and white of this couple here and this one, the woman nude, the guy looking clothed. And just an interesting piece, this, again, it's kind of random, you know, brushwork in the bottom, or working with randomness, I should say. And even just these nice black shapes here, just kind of grounding the whole composition. The guy looking over, the woman looking away.
00:42:40.854 - 00:42:55.168, Speaker A: Symbiosis three. Nice piece. And here's another one by Luciana Guerra. GM friends have a magnificent Friday in quoting borges. Well, we are asleep in this world. We are awake in another one. And here.
00:42:55.168 - 00:43:21.044, Speaker A: So just another cool piece here. Let's just open it in, see it up close again. Looks like a physical, doesn't it? And of course, Luciana makes a lot of physical work here. So beautiful black and white work from Luciana Guerra. And we see these big kind of white brushstrokes here, making shapes over top. Another layer, just very cool rat cloak with a new one, I believe. I picked one up here, one owned, I think I got the last one, railroad in rural areas.
00:43:21.044 - 00:43:54.134, Speaker A: So a pretty nice piece here from Ratcloak, as you can see. And I wish I had the. There was a work in progress that was posted online by Ratcloak here. And you see how the railroad was done first and then the figure was kind of penciled in and the figure was done after. And these awesome, you know, drips came in after. So just a beautiful work here, as usual. A very painterly work by ratcloak out in Ukraine there.
00:43:54.134 - 00:44:33.384, Speaker A: And interesting, kind of playing with these stretched out figures a little bit. Hey, you see the head is kind of compressed a little bit, as if the transform tool has been applied to it. And this kind of moribund, moribund, you know, pale young person here with the guitar at the back, a beer in the hand again, looks kind of semi transformed. Edgy. Edgy work here, maybe girlfriend on the guitar and, you know, travel gear, modern travel gear. And the dog coming along. Look at those boots.
00:44:33.384 - 00:44:51.258, Speaker A: You know, you could look at so many different details in this work. So just another powerful work here now. One secondary for 47. Sold out on primary edition of ten. Only for 15 or, sorry, 25. Find your wonder. This is Amelia Fantasia, whose work we looked at, I think, at Christmas.
00:44:51.258 - 00:45:22.984, Speaker A: So a new work here, a new painting. And I assume this is done on procreate, but I am not actually positive on that. And, of course, using the same sort of process and technique we were noticing on the other work where you can be very. When you have a great process, you can be pretty rough in the details here, or loose. And it all works out anyway because your process is solid. It's always a sign of, in my view, a good artist is when you have a great process here. And that is what we see here.
00:45:22.984 - 00:45:40.132, Speaker A: So, interesting subject here. Looks like food. Almost kind of surreal, though, isn't it? Like they look like vases. This almost looks like an espresso maker. Like half of one with some fruit inside. Let's see. Find your wonder in the bent night of melancholy.
00:45:40.132 - 00:45:57.384, Speaker A: Find a wonder to fight for. So nice and enigmatic there from Emilia fantasia. And this is an edition of eight only tezos 50. So nice piece there, I believe. A procreate work, I believe. La siesta. This is by Quila Nina.
00:45:57.384 - 00:46:21.764, Speaker A: Kids playing outdoors during nap time. And, of course, kind of a. It's always tempting to put quila Nina in the visionary artist category again out of, I believe, Chile. Or is it Peru and Argentina? And always these. This looks like a procreate work. And also makes a lot of acrylic and oil paintings, I believe. And there's always a lot of, you know, symbolism and just interesting painting.
00:46:21.764 - 00:46:47.784, Speaker A: You see the super fuzzy smoke coming out of the chimney here, the bedroom inside, and then the. The kids playing here. And again, this awesome magnification tool. Interesting contrast, too, of kind of fuzzy arms with the background here and the plants. Just really interesting treatment. The rosy cheeks, the sun on the shirt. The cloud.
00:46:47.784 - 00:47:01.548, Speaker A: Right. There's always. It almost feels like a tarot card. Here's probably the moon at night. So seemingly symbolic, right, of maybe the sun, the clouds, maybe the moon. Right. So.
00:47:01.548 - 00:47:13.180, Speaker A: And again, almost like the three graces type thing. Like there's threes. Pretty powerful. An interesting title. The siesta. And there is the bed there. Almost kind of dream.
00:47:13.180 - 00:47:30.200, Speaker A: Like the green sun. Right. So interesting piece. Even the leaves coming off the side there. So this has been burned, so there may be a new one. Let me just see here very quickly. There is edition of twelve.
00:47:30.200 - 00:47:51.000, Speaker A: And you see here wild colors here in a lot of Quila Nina's work. I remember starting with this one episode. This is oil and acrylic and sequins on canvas here from Quila Nina. See if it loads here. It is just a spectacular painting here. Yeah. So we started this maybe, I'm guessing.
00:47:51.000 - 00:48:11.460, Speaker A: How long ago was this? October. So, yeah, about four or five months ago. Now. Continuing on, the War of the Tezos. And this is a work by wasteman gold minevic, which really just captured me. It was a simple work in the terms of just the straight up blue sky, straight up grass and shadow, but really beautifully done. I think it was two tezos.
00:48:11.460 - 00:48:47.214, Speaker A: And here you see what looks like a Tezos soldier with maybe a tattoo on the arm, the tazo strum, the balaclava, and a cigarette and something burning over here. And there you almost see like a skeletor, a pepe, and another guy in a balaclava and a house on fire. So interesting piece here. This sold out pretty quickly, I think now it's twelve on secondary district 468. So, yeah, let's just see here. Yeah, all selling out the first day. It's one of those pieces you see and you just kind of want to own.
00:48:47.214 - 00:48:59.398, Speaker A: I picked one up too. This is dancontrol. It. It almost looks exactly like the ad. Good morning. So interesting piece here from dancontrol. Another gradient work course by Dan.
00:48:59.398 - 00:49:33.034, Speaker A: And I thought a really just cool work. I mean, it almost looks like the actual ad, as I was saying here, but done with gradients in probably Photoshop here. So cool work of an iPhone there. New work from Santiago on superwear. Found this just in the foundation feed, which I've started to use here. So hopefully I'll catch a few more works that are posted on super rare and on foundation. A beautiful piece here from Santiago again, a new one again posted on super rare.
00:49:33.034 - 00:50:05.342, Speaker A: And I'm not sure we'd have to go to super rare to check if there's a reserve on that. Almost 20,000 pixels. 19,000 by 11,000 pixels here. So pretty amazing work there. Jake Studios, what's happening here? We see upside down clouds, an upside down McDonald's sign, and some figures here. Again, kind of a surreal illustrator here, in the sense that it never always makes sense. And we see here, this looks like it says maybe meme.
00:50:05.342 - 00:50:33.164, Speaker A: It's on fire. I don't know if this is this war of the Tazos thing because it looks quite similar, doesn't it, to the wasteman Goldman work that we just saw. What's happening kind of feels like related to that work. So I'm not sure if that was a thing that was happening on Tezos. And these really interesting figures here, kind of glitched out illustration with even some pixelation put in the screens here. Just interesting piece. Nice texture too.
00:50:33.164 - 00:50:54.730, Speaker A: On the grass and sky. Digitally drawn animation. This is a one of one for 250 tezos. Listed for a tezos for just a few minutes there. Interestingly, this is a gorgeous piece here by Greco. Greco Rando. This is edition of ten now on secondary for twelve tezos.
00:50:54.730 - 00:51:23.952, Speaker A: Selling out on primary for three tezos, I thought. An awesome still life here with modern McDonald's Big Mac packaging. The drink and some cokes and a banana and a Sony PlayStation. Beautifully done. I love the negative space of the background here, the white. And you see there's a bit of color in the McDonald's packaging here. Just enough where you can barely tell there's a difference there.
00:51:23.952 - 00:51:45.734, Speaker A: Just really, really nice piece here. English breakfast. Hilarious. Here's another piece, piece by Greco northern cocktail 4500 by 4500. This is 50 Tezos edition of one and still available here. And let's just take a look here because I thought I saw a bug. So this magnify tool and look at how rough it is.
00:51:45.734 - 00:52:27.764, Speaker A: Again, when you have your process, you can kind of be almost as loose as you want and things will work and leaving almost the looks like the under. You know, an under drawing there. And just creates the kind of busyness and the just kind of randomness just adds interest to the whole work, doesn't it? And here it looks like the under, the gray is removed. But here you see. So there's something to be said. You know, one trick that you can do if you're trying to make your work more interesting as an artist. And again, you have that same thing that he did with the McDonald's packaging, which is just a slightly different color than the background in the martini here.
00:52:27.764 - 00:53:14.694, Speaker A: So you see just an off. Nice touch is what I say. So an interesting game you can play if you're trying to make your work more interesting is delete the erase tool or remove. Just don't use the erase tool and force yourself. Where if you make a mistake, you either leave it in or you have to use another color to maybe it's white or whatever to get rid of it. And then you just start to get the work. You know, it's, again, back to this idea, this modern idea that some modern art, like in a Picasso, often you'll see the trail is left behind as to how the work was constructed, which is part of the appreciation that comes in, say, like, you know, some works, you'll see it often in Picasso.
00:53:14.694 - 00:53:37.634, Speaker A: You'll get the sense of this. You can kind of see how the work was made. And leaving that trail, that path, again, creates a kind of aesthetic experience and adds to the aesthetic. And I'd argue, you see that there in the pencil work that's left behind there. I think that was called northern cocktail. Northern cocktail. Interesting piece there with a little fly on the olive sear.
00:53:37.634 - 00:53:59.528, Speaker A: On the olive sear. Okay. Running along here. Always watching. So this is Lewis Osborne and figure, who is surrounded by surveillance cameras. And here is another one I need your help with which color scheme to use. So, this is a classic issue that digital artists have because they can do this.
00:53:59.528 - 00:54:28.756, Speaker A: It's not like a physical artwork where you kind of get one shot where you have to redraw everything. You know, I would say all of the above is basically if you made four that you like, and I think they all have their thing. I wonder if someone said that. So option two and option four were the winners. So here's option two, the red one, and here's option four. So interesting, isn't it? It looks like option one was the one that Lewis posted before. I wonder if anybody.
00:54:28.756 - 00:55:01.750, Speaker A: And here's a variation. Right? So just an interesting. I wonder if anybody said all of the above, but I guess that's not the answer that Lewis Osborne was looking for. He wanted a choice. So all to say, just an interesting question. Louis Osborne, of course, has done this before, where you mint like three or four different versions of the same piece with different colors and has successfully sold and done well with them. So it's an interesting question and discussion.
00:55:01.750 - 00:55:30.544, Speaker A: Best friends forever. So we're watching the work in progress here. We. There is some music on it. It's also a work by Louis Osborne here. This sad, sad, melancholy work, seemingly the people on the swings now in the ground, happy. So powerful work there.
00:55:30.544 - 00:55:51.124, Speaker A: That was only the first half. Like, who knows where that goes? Music by John Hugo. And so not sure what the. Zero additions this 1 may have been burned. We can look very quickly to see if there's another. So zero additions. So not sure what's going on with that one.
00:55:51.124 - 00:56:17.328, Speaker A: Interestingly. So maybe that one was burned or removed. Not sure why it says zero. Ilio gible, red floor summer. So seemingly a reference to David Hockney. Splash a little bit here, but with completely different colors. And you see a swimming board here and diving board, I should say, and then the splash here and really kind of louder colors, we might say, with a nice gradient.
00:56:17.328 - 00:56:39.264, Speaker A: Really original illustration here, as you can see in the tree, perhaps illustrating wind, and then you see the sea in the background there. Interesting piece. Red floor summer, reserve of 0.15 on super rare, so just minted January 8. And here is Berku or Bayram. Best wishes. So this came out on New Year's.
00:56:39.264 - 00:57:08.266, Speaker A: This is an edition of 65. Now 28 tazos on secondary. And I thought a pretty fun work here, as you see, almost what looks like a string of pearls moving through this piece here. And all the celebration of the new year here. Coming through on this piece with a beautiful shapes and abstract in the background with some basic primary colors here. Red, yellow, green, blue, white and a bit of beige there. Best wishes for 2024 from Berku or Bayram.
00:57:08.266 - 00:57:28.626, Speaker A: Nice piece. This was a super cool piece here too. Rustic digital art with a play on what looks like old video games here. Not exactly sure which one. I mean, we see Mario here, but I don't think the motorbike person is from Mario. This looks like it's from Mario. Then you see cigarette, lucky strike.
00:57:28.626 - 00:57:57.184, Speaker A: You see the interesting selection with the inner, you know, the magic wand type selection with the inside not selected, but the three here, you know, kind of bleeding into the numbers here, keeping all that. And then press start at the bottom, but press start here. And you know what this looks like? I just realized it now with the lucky strike. And this what looks like a warning here. Smoking causes cancer. So it looks like a cigarette pack, interestingly. So this is an edition of one.
00:57:57.184 - 00:58:24.344, Speaker A: And this sold to art gnome for 22 tezos. So nice sale there from rustic digital art. Very cool piece. Here's another one, magic desktop. This is an edition of seven for three tezos each. And here we see that same kind of motorcycle figure being combined and the same selection right where you select, you know, just do the magic wand and then it doesn't select the inside because it's cut off. And then working with that.
00:58:24.344 - 00:59:13.704, Speaker A: So interesting work there. And again, some Mario, some older space invader vibes, and what looks like a windows desktop, and then a big heart. So, of course, rustic, as we've mentioned before, if you've never heard, often works with just purely irrational elements here. And just, you know, it's, again, we're kind of back to that embracing irrationality idea. That's something that rustic digital art has been doing for like, at least more than a year, like, ever since I've seen his work. Here's mech TXt posting another one of these dos works with what looks like a new tile here, this part here with what looks like a tree. And you see some fires also looking like a new tile here.
00:59:13.704 - 00:59:44.646, Speaker A: So it looks like this town or these structures are on fire. So just beautifully done as ever with this, you know, straight up blue sky, flat blue sky. And this nice framing device here. And then even more around a really nice piece here. Continuing on, the Venus project, intelligent waters. So this is Loubatel Blizny and the gift gallery, referencing Jacques Fresco, founder of the Venus project. And it says here, who lived for more than 100 years but never invented anything sensible.
00:59:44.646 - 01:00:25.564, Speaker A: So I think it was the movie zeitgeist, if I remember right, where it was kind of like this big thing. It was kind of like an. I don't know, how would you describe that movie? It was kind of like, I want to say, let's call it an independent film on the financial system and where at the end, the solution to everything was the Venus project. So here, a bit of a criticism, it seems, of the Venus project, just kind of celebrating it. Dedicated to the founder of the Venus project, but who didn't create anything sensible. So maybe not the most practical person, according to Loubotal Blissney. So interesting commentary there and interesting subject matter.
01:00:25.564 - 01:00:46.764, Speaker A: This was burned, so maybe there's another additional out there. But interesting piece here, of course, is Hasdrubal waffle. And there is an offer that has been made here by Ahek. And this is a single. And this. When was this listed here? January 13. So new work from Hasdrubal waffle here.
01:00:46.764 - 01:01:02.116, Speaker A: And this is on foundation. So releasing a one of one on foundation here. Interesting static pixels. Really big pixels here, static pixels and moving ones. And dynamic at the same time here. Kind of a risque work here. These three figures.
01:01:02.116 - 01:01:16.684, Speaker A: Food co op. Another single here. And this offer made by AHEC for 0.1 ETH. So nice sale there. That is 22 or $40. So nice sale there for his drubel waffle here.
01:01:16.684 - 01:01:46.274, Speaker A: Food co op. Another single minted two days ago on foundation. So nice piece there. Sabato sapo frage. So Sabato, I think, has been releasing some deluxe paint for works that are not, that haven't been minted yet. So here is a frog that is on what looks like a lily pad here. And a little pond almost going back to the very earliest drawing exercises in some respects, drying the pond and some grass and a bit of noise in the background there.
01:01:46.274 - 01:02:04.372, Speaker A: So interesting piece, captain. I managed to get the last of these. Departure. Cool work here by Kappn. Just super minimal. I found this on Saturday morning in Berlin time, and I thought, what a perfect Saturday morning piece here with this little figure. Let me see.
01:02:04.372 - 01:02:28.418, Speaker A: Unfortunately, I guess you can't zoom in on the gifts, but really cool writing here. January captain's log or 23 54. Captain Hayes, stardate 23 54. And then it has this great text here. Departure summary, briefing, final checks. Really adds to this really interesting pixel artwork by Kappen. For yourself.
01:02:28.418 - 01:02:51.560, Speaker A: From yourself. You know what was interesting about this one? This was posted on X. Again, talking about Stan Lee. Who does this remind you of as a comic artist? I'll tell you who it just screams of to me is Jack Kirby. This is a classic Jack Kirby panel here. You know, just like big heads and kind of like, you know, both together. This is like a classic kirby panel.
01:02:51.560 - 01:03:07.064, Speaker A: So anyways, could be random, or maybe there is an influence. A nice piece by Kappin here. As you see, you know, black and white here. It's moving. Just a really great artist there. Free yourself from yourself. Here is.
01:03:07.064 - 01:03:26.590, Speaker A: Who do we have here? Nicholas Dietrich, of course. Every decision you make creates a new universe. And another interesting, very dithered work. A little looser here in the treatment of these flowers on this tree. And just a really nice piece here. And we'll see what it says. There's a car.
01:03:26.590 - 01:03:42.728, Speaker A: And again, just lots of dithering. Every decision you make creates a universe, a clearing in the woods. So kind of enigmatic here. And this was minted when? Maybe a day ago. Two days ago, January 13. So I don't think we saw this one yet. Pretty sure that's new.
01:03:42.728 - 01:03:54.088, Speaker A: This was a super interesting work. A smaller work here. And this, you can see that object maybe has. It's a little tricky. Or maybe this is interactive. Not sure. Sophia.
01:03:54.088 - 01:04:11.136, Speaker A: Sophie Ogura. Sophie Ogura. This is an edition of 13. Kind of an edgier. I wish I could make it bigger. I can. An edgier work where you can see the pixelation and everything, and you see kind of like a figure is going.
01:04:11.136 - 01:04:28.456, Speaker A: Being transformed from large to small with this figure here. Just kind of an edgy work here. Edgy pixel art, as I like to call it. Inwoods, HTML 380 on primary. There's curio fringe picked one up. That's always a good sign. And guru guru hyena can accept.
01:04:28.456 - 01:04:59.564, Speaker A: And more so edition of 13, still available on primary. There are three left, so selling well there too. This is pretty rad by Spiegels Maskinen. Feeling arty. So you see almost a photoshop type of toolbox by Spiegels. I mean, nice, nice production. And there's the spray paint three d.
01:04:59.564 - 01:05:18.042, Speaker A: I would have no idea of how to go about making something like this. This is pretty cool. And look, there's Spiegel's maskinen. So into the garbage. Into the garbage he goes. So brilliant work, as usual. Here's guru, guru hyena.
01:05:18.042 - 01:05:34.804, Speaker A: And I'm not sure what that says. Three winds grind shop. Not sure. Just kind of an interesting piece here. Experimental piece from guru, guru hyena. Kind of looking like dragging brushes or sampled brushes. Created with my DDD app, still in development.
01:05:34.804 - 01:06:08.582, Speaker A: So this is an edition of one and not listed yet. Here is someone called Braun, embroidery number zero two. And an interesting gif here. Kind of like a pixelated, kind of reminiscent a little bit, just a little bit of Santiago, but not entirely. Could hang in the same show, let's say that. And here you see just a little bit of analog kind of video glitchery, seemingly, or at least movement here, in contrast with the still pixels. Always make it a nice contrast.
01:06:08.582 - 01:06:31.934, Speaker A: Here's Datura with a nice, kind of edgy work here. And always just barely representational here. Maybe a landscape with a boat in it, perhaps. Interesting piece there. And here is Sean Luke. This is from January 12, astral argo. So interesting piece here with kind of a diamond shape that is moving around.
01:06:31.934 - 01:06:57.198, Speaker A: And here, just kind of an interesting abstract here by Sean Luke. So interesting piece. Dimension Bridger, and not listed, as far as I know. Continuing on Glitchtown arcade. Really nice pieces coming out here. No bananas, no party. And so maybe looking like a king Kong work or something along those lines here.
01:06:57.198 - 01:07:09.710, Speaker A: Glitched out Nintendo glitch Rom. Very nice piece there. That is $0.99 edition of 30. And there are 30 left of this. Really nice piece. Here's another one, edition of 30.
01:07:09.710 - 01:07:29.222, Speaker A: Nothing more nonsense than war. Another interesting glitchwork piece by Glitchtown arcade. 99 Tazosense. Nice work, Juana Pedro. And here, let's just do that. Really nice piece here. This is pretty interesting.
01:07:29.222 - 01:07:57.264, Speaker A: Found on Instagram. Never seen this artist before. Interesting take on what looks like some Nintendo glitch rom or a video game as a backdrop. Here is Kyle Flemmer with an interesting glitch here too, with what looks like Dorothy from the wizard of Oz, of course, Dorothy unbothered. So I guess there's a video game. So interesting glitch here. And what I also loved about this edition of 15 for 350.
01:07:57.264 - 01:08:28.798, Speaker A: I love these other works here. These stills. Made one of ones, I think, quite brilliantly. Again, we're looking at that with Lewis Osborne. This has been an ongoing kind of discussion, which is you have the gif, right? With a whole bunch of frames in it. But in a sense, each frame is a different work. So interestingly here, Kyle Flemmer takes his three favorite frames, I assume turns them into one of ones, and you get fantastic work like this with this great green background.
01:08:28.798 - 01:08:42.034, Speaker A: What happened here? Sold to Kappan or transferred to Kappan. So beautiful piece there. Here's another one. Ilay. Transferred to Ilay. So maybe just giving them out for free. But really nice pieces here.
01:08:42.034 - 01:09:13.152, Speaker A: And here's another one where Dorothy is doubled. And this was sent to Hakuna Matata. But I tell you, when I was seeing these come out being minted, I was waiting for them to be listed. I was like, refreshing. I was like, is this one of one going to be available? Interestingly, just from my own perspective. And the reason I say interestingly is because I wasn't fazed by the fact that there was a gif, you know, that was already minted before I knew that. But I still kind of wanted that one of one.
01:09:13.152 - 01:09:30.924, Speaker A: Still. Isn't that like. And I find that interesting. Like, I wasn't fazed by that. I want that green one, for example. Interesting, right? Xpqzl, an artist I'd never seen before. This is on tea with this kind of lo fi or not so lo fi.
01:09:30.924 - 01:10:09.014, Speaker A: Look at this. That almost looks like tezos pole, but maybe just something Sci-Fi so pretty interesting work over there. There's always. There's so many artists. Look at this, too. All this noise. Click for 25 tezos editions, I think 19 left.
01:10:09.014 - 01:10:26.646, Speaker A: So maybe selling. Let's just stop that history. Selling for 25 tezos. So pretty good. That's a, you know, fair amount of money, especially with tezos at like $1.17 or something, last I checked. Really cool work here by Violet Tripp.
01:10:26.646 - 01:10:51.044, Speaker A: If I'm pronouncing that right. Blood moon glitch rider. Cool piece here. Let me see if there's volume. There is cool music hanging out in this window in the sky. Almost like a theater. Really interesting piece here.
01:10:51.044 - 01:11:13.600, Speaker A: And the glitch, you know, going diagonal there. Blood moon glitch rider by Violet Tripp. Very cool. Sold for two ethnic. And that is. That is on sealed art. Interestingly, Lydia moons Gmailiens.
01:11:13.600 - 01:11:42.422, Speaker A: So another cool work here, I don't think any volume here. So Lydia moons with another. Just interesting kind of. You almost have like this elf figure here with this weird sort of like, you know, kind of shininess in the. Or reflection or kind of chrome effect in the surrounding area and all kind of glitched out. As you can see, it just kind of shift a little bit here and there. GM aliens.
01:11:42.422 - 01:12:09.556, Speaker A: Cool work. Continuing on, Nicholas Sassoon, new RGB study. Gif compression has been rough. So this is a GiF compression of what Nicholas Sassoon is working on. But interesting piece here. Kind of looks like the moon a little bit, or I guess just an abstract sphere. Continuing on here is Santiago Ruao freement on Zora welfare.
01:12:09.556 - 01:12:33.560, Speaker A: So interesting abstract work here from Santiago. Keeping it interesting over there. Rannick Steer, endless number five. So there's a new series here by rannixteer. He's very cool. Kind of minimal abstract gradient works. And this is a new series on foundation called Endless and minted for 0.028.
01:12:33.560 - 01:12:54.520, Speaker A: So making another series here after the success of the MCH X series. So you can see these mints here that are coming out. So it looks like about eight mints so far. So that's pretty good. So cool work there. And let's continue on acid boy with another interesting piece. Look at this.
01:12:54.520 - 01:13:13.324, Speaker A: Just kind of minted. Could be an old work, could be new. Just really nice. Animated abstract from acid boy. And here is another one, GM Fam. And this looks like another experiment where you see. So looks like experimenting with the programming here.
01:13:13.324 - 01:13:30.254, Speaker A: Maybe this will be minted on bitcoin, too. Just amazing. Acid boy, always kind of mind blowing there. Just really amazing. Beautiful indeed. Here is Lucas Lejeune encrypted stack as we zoom to the end here. Let's see if this works.
01:13:30.254 - 01:13:53.462, Speaker A: Here we go. So, Lucas Lejeune, and you really do get the sense of encryption here in these different shapes. So really nice piece here from Lucas Lejeune. A gif encrypted stack. Great title, too. Da Nyriss with a cool, kind of glitched out analog video glitch. With some interesting background here.
01:13:53.462 - 01:14:12.934, Speaker A: Inside our digital realm, imagination won't perish. Just a mysterious work here. It looks great. Trial, experimentation, visual. So very cool. 39 tezos on secondary, sold out on primary. Here's another one by Daenerys, also called trial, I think.
01:14:12.934 - 01:14:33.754, Speaker A: And here, just more kind of analog video glitchery. Looks like a face going through some lily pads here in the water. Interesting piece. And shin imamiya. This is by Renki. Kind of a different piece here from Renki, isn't it? So pretty cool. So keeping it interesting over here.
01:14:33.754 - 01:14:50.700, Speaker A: Very prolific. Renki, adey Tazos. I assume that's a one of one. This is inavare on exchange art on solana. Sold for five, Saul. Nice work. Sold for five, Saul.
01:14:50.700 - 01:15:10.640, Speaker A: Purchased by tolo, $496. Great work. So again, you can see why artists are excited about Saul and exchange art. Very nice artists getting rewarded there. Composition 68. So some more work by klaus. Very nice piece here.
01:15:10.640 - 01:15:24.040, Speaker A: More, just beautiful. One of ones with gorgeous, gorgeous colors here. This sold for 21 tezos to Emilia Versace. Nice pickup there. Here's another one. Just gorgeous. Composition 65.
01:15:24.040 - 01:15:43.208, Speaker A: This also by klaus and sold to Conehead squid for 21 tezos. And let's just make that bigger. So more beautiful work here from Klaus. I think we have another one. Composition 69. Also selling to Saul crypto forager for 21 tezos. So more interesting experimentation.
01:15:43.208 - 01:16:08.148, Speaker A: And here is Mika Oladev. Got something extra special next week with Chris WvR. Chris war. So more interesting glitch work from Mika Oladef and friends. Chris War. This was put out by Elie Lo, which I thought was kind of funny. Fight for the Tezos.
01:16:08.148 - 01:16:46.050, Speaker A: So again, we saw wasteman gold Minevich with a work in fight for tezos. So I'm not sure if there was something going on, like some sort of theme that everybody was doing. So here you see the knuckle, what do you call it? The brass knuckles here, fighting for tezos from La Lowe GLB. Cool work there. And here, of course, is Skomra with some new computer work, keeping it edgily, kind of fuzzy here with this interesting kind of almost pixelated background, but not quite, because the pixels don't all line up. Just a beautiful work here. Simple and kind of interesting texture and just kind of softness there.
01:16:46.050 - 01:17:09.374, Speaker A: And here's another one. Look at this outline on the woman at the keyboard here or at the laptop. And this awesome background, this beautiful AI gradient background, I assume. And great texture in the sweater there, too. Here, of course, is no hygiene. Free mint on Zora with another edgy work. Kind of looks like someone climbing up an electrical pool.
01:17:09.374 - 01:17:21.174, Speaker A: So interesting. Or a power pole. So interesting work here from no hygiene. And I think we have another one. Look at this. This is on new eye freement on Zora. So putting out a ton of work.
01:17:21.174 - 01:17:52.644, Speaker A: Interesting, interesting AI kind of pixel art style work, I assume. AI with different textures in here, almost looking like, you know, layered effects. But not. But probably just all AI, I would assume. And here of course is Martin Jo with a beautiful piece, minted or put on Twitter, some bagels there. And this person eating here, having tea. This dog with all the bears around, enjoying the tea and some bears in the background.
01:17:52.644 - 01:18:20.334, Speaker A: So beautiful AI work here from Martin Joe. Here is little cakes with a japanese title here. Let's see if it plays. And no volume on this one. So another kind of edgy, unsettling work from little cakes here. Very photo realistic, I might add. But as you can see here, AI video experiments with previously unused throwaway doll images.
01:18:20.334 - 01:18:48.700, Speaker A: So very cool there. And here's a, I believe a collaboration. Karasu no komo ryuta. This is little cakes and someone with a vase for a profile. Kind of dreamlike. So that goes for a minute. 38.
01:18:48.700 - 01:19:45.704, Speaker A: Nice piece here too. So sound by dead FKA retired using field recordings taken in Kanazawa, Japan in 2022 by little cakes. And continuing on here is of course strange thing with some pretty edgy works here, some square sunglasses and interesting almost, what would you call that? I can't remember what this would be called, but where you might wear it in the desert to keep you cool. Strange thing written on the sunglasses, hilariously. And of course all of the, you know, an interesting way of making christian art and imagery kind of cool by pixelating out the eyes on Jesus. Interesting piece where you could almost see this kind of work actually being kind of cool, like gangsta gangster sort of clothing. One could argue, like you could actually see this happening, especially when you pixelate the eyes like that.
01:19:45.704 - 01:20:06.976, Speaker A: Couldn't you just see that? So really interesting work here. Fashion concepts. And nice execution too with these probably AI models from strange thing. Total master of AI here. Look at that umbrella, that outrageous umbrella. White solitude. Blood drops as we near the end here.
01:20:06.976 - 01:20:35.824, Speaker A: So just some really nice brushstrokes and mark making. Almost looking like japanese samurai type work here. Blood drops, lightness of being. This is a edition of seven for seven tazos. Are there any left here? There are two left on primary. Continuing on, of course, tuks with a really interesting piece put on x. Very nice AI work of flowers here.
01:20:35.824 - 01:20:53.784, Speaker A: Nice piece. And here is another one minted on Solana. Sold for one sol. So another work here on exchange art. So artists continuing to sell here on Solana. Let's see if that loads up here. And there it is.
01:20:53.784 - 01:21:10.044, Speaker A: It shows. So beautiful piece here for one sol from tuks on Solana. AI artwork and into the physical work we go. Zsys bliatkas everyday, one and a half by 1.7 meters. Acrylic on canvas. Interesting piece here.
01:21:10.044 - 01:21:39.474, Speaker A: I continue to be amazed, actually at all the good, exciting digital or, sorry, physical art that is coming out. It felt like there was about 15 years where it was kind of hard to see something that at least that I was like, super excited about. Now I feel like I'm seeing it all the time. This is pretty interesting too. Let me see who this is. Aman Yahangir, the breakup, I think I died that night. And so taking, you know, a phone screenshot and then paint, maybe printing it out and painting over top of it.
01:21:39.474 - 01:22:02.768, Speaker A: And here it looks like a cupid arrow in a child. I mean, just kind of a sad work there. Medjart. Interesting piece here. Interesting way of painting pixelation here. Close ups from my first week in studio at mint art house. Very interesting way of, you know, the technical side of doing pixelation.
01:22:02.768 - 01:22:25.828, Speaker A: Just get a square brush and get it the right size, maybe make the squares. The size of the brush is what you do, right? Because here it's just perfect. You just do one stroke and you're good. Because kind of not as easy as it sounds to do pixelation. Like, once you have your solution, it works, but it can be tricky. Demon ego with a nice, what looks like a physical here. So added it here with the physicals.
01:22:25.828 - 01:22:40.284, Speaker A: Glitch, more glitch. Interesting piece here. Totally recognizable as demon egos. Maybe printed at the bottom and drawn over top. Perhaps a little bit of collage, maybe. Jordan Ferguson. Interesting depiction of flowers.
01:22:40.284 - 01:23:08.932, Speaker A: A bouquet of flowers here. So nice piece here. A study from summer, 16 by 20 acrylic on canvas. I think we've seen one of their works before, and we've seen this work artist before. Adam Lister studio in Bangkok, Thailand. And as you can see here, Han Solo and Princess Leia kissing there in this really cool kind of rectangular, square style, modular style. And of course, bondozo bandido with more super interesting, kind of enigmatic work here.
01:23:08.932 - 01:23:39.284, Speaker A: Again, playing with the airbrush, seemingly, and acrylic paint in the background. Not a huge work here, but making a ton of work. And then interesting coloring too. Just going with the nose and kind of finishing it like it kind of finishes the piece. So great instincts here. Here's machine with another face on a car. And here you see again what looks like, kind of like airbrush being used here in the teeth and everything in the tires.
01:23:39.284 - 01:24:08.906, Speaker A: So interesting piece there. And walk with a piece, spray paint piece, probably spray can again, just total master as you look at the eyes here. And just really nice piece, I think. And here is the other one, just letters put on the other side and almost like the. Hmm. Is you wonder if the two works are related. You could actually have like a diptych of sorts with these two works.
01:24:08.906 - 01:24:25.420, Speaker A: Interesting. And here's another one on Zora from expanded mind free bent. So really cool piece here as well. Nice composition. Super original. Just across the board here. It looks like a human head repeated on our zora.
01:24:25.420 - 01:24:31.924, Speaker A: And that is your show, my friends. Thank you for joining me again as we open up the week here. Until next time, take care.
