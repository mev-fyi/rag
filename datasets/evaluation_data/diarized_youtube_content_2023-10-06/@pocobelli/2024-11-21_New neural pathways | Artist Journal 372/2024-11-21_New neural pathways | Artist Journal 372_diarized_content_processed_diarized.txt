00:00:04.640 - 00:00:27.835, Speaker A: Okay. We're gonna do the best we can under the circumstances, as you will find yourself. When you are making art, you just gotta make it. Sometimes it makes your best work. So let's see what happens. Artist Journal, November 21, 2024. Broadcasting from Rome, Italy, from an anonymous Airbnb.
00:00:27.835 - 00:00:58.083, Speaker A: My name's Adrian Pocobelli. Fighting the odds, fighting the clock, fighting the technology, but here I am. Thank you for your patience. Huge, massive thank you for your patience. I think it's been about two and a half weeks, which makes it super interesting, actually. I was thinking to myself, it's a different perspective because oftentimes when I'm kind of in the middle of the regular schedule, it's about every two or three days. And forgive the computer, it will be choppy.
00:00:58.083 - 00:01:27.951, Speaker A: Maybe I'll close window windows along the way here. But it's interesting when you take a two and a half week break and then you look at the works. I mean, it's Masterpiece Theater. And unfortunately I couldn't even get everything in. The computer was starting to crack and I have about hour and 40 minutes before I actually have to leave this apartment as far as checkout. So, yeah, so thank you. I got back from Bangkok.
00:01:27.951 - 00:01:46.387, Speaker A: It was incredible. Working on some sort of accelerator project there. More details at some point, but not yet. I want to keep it under wraps for right now. And so right now, let's look at the art. So guess who's back? Guess who's back. Gogolitis is back.
00:01:46.387 - 00:02:03.795, Speaker A: And with a few works and coming back in form, someone else who took a break. I mean, a bit of a longer break. And here we have. What is this work called? The Legend of Zelda. Perfect. Only 85 editions because there were 200. I actually thought it would sell out right away.
00:02:03.795 - 00:02:28.183, Speaker A: Two tezos each. But yeah, I mean, this work, to me, there are so many works I could have started with here. As you're going to see, probably about, I would guess like 20, maybe more. It really is dazzling. I mean, probably even more. You can start with almost anything. But in terms of just head turning, wow.
00:02:28.183 - 00:02:51.761, Speaker A: Kind of cool works. I went with this one. And as far as starting this show. And the reason is because I feel like it encapsulates so much of what we discuss on this program. In a sense, this second generation of digital art, as I like to call it here. And again, forgive if there's an echo. I'm kind of in this kind of four walled kind of a cube here.
00:02:51.761 - 00:04:05.611, Speaker A: So I feel like this kind of encapsulates a Lot of the spirit of what we're doing here because what do we have? We have a video game start screen to start the episode as well. A nice added bonus as far as starting this episode. But it is based, as you'll see here, let me make this larger. It is based on the 1986 Nintendo Start screen. And here Gogolitis has basically done a pastiche homage of the original here and with, you know, Gogolaidis touch here on the waterfall, of course. Gorgeously done, by the way. And so it brings up this whole idea of how video games, more importantly, I'd say almost than anything, are, have created an aesthetic vision, for lack of better term, as I wander off into the unknown here, trying to formulate what it is that makes this so special.
00:04:05.611 - 00:05:20.235, Speaker A: And I'd argue the very what makes it the second generation of digital art. One of the defining characteristics, and I need to start taking notes on these things so I don't forget them, is the growing up with video games. And why does that matter? Is because video games have a certain visual quality, visual characteristics that are actually quite beautiful, you know, and, you know, just to add. And also the market itself, in a sense, the video game Market in here, 1986, the graphics had to be good for people to want to buy the video game. They had to be compelling. So you had a generation, I would argue maybe two, but let's call it a generation of artists who grew up with, or collectors as well, who grew up with these beautiful computer images, basically these beautiful computer art. But that was not necessarily made for the intention of being shown in a museum.
00:05:20.235 - 00:06:11.423, Speaker A: They were made really for you to buy them and to play them and to enjoy them, to. But let's say the visual designers, the graphic designers, the game designers, you know, let's say in Japan, I assume, interestingly, you know, based on all the pixel art we've seen. And Hermipe has a pixel art show, by the way, coming up, a Visual one lithograph. So we're going to look at that in a second. But based on this, you know, this market need for compelling graphics, they were forced to make good graphics. It was kind of like one of the biggest things. It's like, oh, there's a new system, we have a new graphics processor, and now it's going to be even more interestingly closer to real life.
00:06:11.423 - 00:07:34.991, Speaker A: Was basically the trajectory. Right. And interestingly though, the aesthetic that we kind of love is actually quite early. I mean, and it does change over time and there are different things that we love about it. But what you see with a lot of pixel art, for example, is a real appreciation, you might say, for the 1980s, what you might call Pong, you know, let's call it late 70s, to, you know, Super Mario Brothers, you know, what would be, I don't know, Super Mario Brothers 3, let's call it, for lack of better word, lack of better term, let's call it 1978-1992 to paint with a very broad, loose outline here as we try and figure out what it is that happened here. And so back to Gogolitis. The reason why I think it's important and why it's kind of significant and why I start with this image here on this show with so many brilliant images is because not only is it beautiful what Gogolaitis has done, this homage, but it's also symbolic of this generation that grew up where their aesthetics were partially, if not significantly defined by video games.
00:07:34.991 - 00:08:51.679, Speaker A: And I'm not even a big video game player, but I sure, sure as heck can appreciate video game aesthetics as I did when I was 4 or 5 years old playing the Apple IIe, you know, Ultima 3 and then Ultima 4 and you know, as well as sneakers for those that know that game on Apple ii. And of course, I did go to friends houses and enjoy, you know, Mario Brothers and whatnot on Nintendos. We never had a Nintendo, hilariously, probably for the best, who knows? So it's quite significant. And I think, although Gogolitis just finally here, although Gogolitis has done something very simple, I would weirdly say that is the brilliance of it, because you could say, oh, anybody could do this, you know, in a sense, like, oh, let's take a video game start screen and start making homages to it. But who is doing that? I mean, we have seen fake video game homages, we've seen ROM corruption. But have you actually ever seen a homage, let's call it, to a video game start screen? I'm sure it exists. It must.
00:08:51.679 - 00:09:20.285, Speaker A: But does it? Like, I can't think of anything. So the fact that Gogolitis to me is actually being quite original with a very simple idea is not very common. That's. To me, it's not easy to be simple to do simple ideas that perhaps haven't been done. And I could be wrong about that. Maybe there's a whole artist whose work I'm stepping over who has done this sort of thing. But all to say, quite brilliant.
00:09:20.285 - 00:09:55.735, Speaker A: And let's just finally, and you see, like what I roughly call the Hexadecimal you see this tiling is maybe a better way of putting it, that comprises the original. And so Gogolitis has substituted the tiling with more the trademark pixel art that Gogolitis makes. And putting some beautiful animation in there. So perfect to begin here. The newspaper of the imagination. Push start button. Handcrafted pixel art by Gogolaitis.
00:09:55.735 - 00:10:33.043, Speaker A: Now there is another person who did a Start screen, but it was more in a ROM Corruption, not necessarily a homage. And of course that's Heidi Rockette who finished the 99 and one series with so poetically. And I did a show on that way back when, maybe show 80 if I had to guess. And that also used the Start screen. So there are others, but not necessarily a kind of a remix of sorts. We saw ROM Corruption, but not necessarily a kind of updated pixel art version. This is kind of like a remix like you'd see in music is what I would call this.
00:10:33.043 - 00:10:54.891, Speaker A: So quite, quite interesting here. A few other works by Gogolaidis. By the way, interesting Pixel artist almost looking generative here, but I think this is all pixel art here. Holographic pixel art. GIF Gogolitis. This is an edition of 10 just released. So back on the scene here and actually sending this out to I think previous collectors.
00:10:54.891 - 00:11:27.021, Speaker A: Gogolitis sending me one, thank you here. Also working with castles and putting a different spin on it and kind of medieval themed work. Interestingly Radio Realm. So making the castle like a radio. Cool pun here. And also another recent work, Holosphere. So again playing with kind of abstraction, let's call it, or a loose abstraction with a sphere and pixel art and just really looks like experimentation using I assume aspirite here.
00:11:27.021 - 00:11:54.001, Speaker A: Aspirite. So this is Gogolitis back on the scene for those that don't know. So on object here is Gogolitis work and I think starting back up here just in the last four. And there's probably a break from here, which I think was a few months ago, let's call it four or five months ago. If I had to hazard a guess, I would look. But time beckons here. Just by the way, for those that might not know Gogolitis, here are some kind of classic works.
00:11:54.001 - 00:12:40.985, Speaker A: I very quickly just scanned through some of my favorites here. So of course using the interface almost like the, you know, you know, somewhat influenced by Cream Safa here in the Pixel Art Factory sort of style with almost the circuit board maze works here almost again, very video gamey propaganda factory. And there is the message from the Airbnb person. I still have an hour and a half. Mystery Box Factory. So again, what do you see here? You almost see Super Mario question mark boxes, but again, putting his own spin on it. So the importance of video games and perhaps even more specifically the video game aesthetics and how they have, I would argue.
00:12:40.985 - 00:13:27.173, Speaker A: And we even see it with what Corey Archangel in Super Mario Clouds. I think one of the first, if not the first, you know, ROM corruption works that really, you know, there was ROM corruption before Corey Archangel, but maybe the first that kind of put it in a real kind of spotlight in terms of, you know, the Whitney for, you know, I think 30 years old, having a solo show at the Whitney. And that was one of the huge works. I happened to stumble across that show when I'd never heard of Cory Archangel. And some of the gradient works, interestingly, working with the gradient. So Corey Archangel aging quite well, I would say here. That was back In, I think 2007, on my, I think second trip to New York, if memory serves.
00:13:27.173 - 00:13:59.611, Speaker A: So here's just more. You see the influence of video games. Mystery Box Factory here. Cat Cult classic works on Tezos and yeah, great, you know, purple, this purple and blue was a thing there on Tezos, it seemed in 2021, 2022. Here's more with the cats. And again, kind of like a little video game type structure here. And again, forgive the computer.
00:13:59.611 - 00:14:23.349, Speaker A: So that is edition 21. And here again, what do you see? Video games. Right. So something is happening here. I've long commented on the importance of video games and you see it and it's kind like. And in a weird way, it's kind of perfect for blockchain collecting because it's a different kind of art. I would argue.
00:14:23.349 - 00:14:58.277, Speaker A: Again, you look at the history of art and then you come to works like this. I think it's confusing for people. It was confusing for me when I first got to Object or Tezos. And I was kind of looking around and it took me like I had to make a little leap, some neurons had to make new connections for me to say this is something like art I should spend money on. This is like it's a different kind of aesthetic. And I'm screen here. So let me move from the screen because perhaps that's part of the problem.
00:14:58.277 - 00:15:19.817, Speaker A: Pong training system. Right. So look at this super detailed work here. Early work by gogolitis edition of 123. Only 12 tezos, I would say pretty rad. So Gogolitis back on the scene. Wonderful.
00:15:19.817 - 00:16:00.745, Speaker A: Speaking of wonderful, Ranix Deer's Mirror series on Bitcoin. This was extremely interesting. Basically to summarize or to whet your appetite. First of all, I highly recommend you listen to I basically, you see how Ranix Steer's process was impacted by transforming what her gradient works that are made on Photoshop, converting those into a code and using a tool that was invented for this purpose for her by the people at. I think it's Function Gallery. Function Gallery. There it is.
00:16:00.745 - 00:16:45.157, Speaker A: So she. So they made a custom tool for her. A major theme that I think is happening here in digital art, which is artists making their own tools or people making artists tools. And here a tool was made specifically to help Ranix Deer create her gradient works in a way that works for her. They weren't exactly the same as we're going to see in a second, but using code where it would only be half a kilobyte rather than two megabytes, as you know, if you were to export a png, for example, of one of her gradient works made in Photoshop, maybe more, maybe 10 megabytes. Right. I mean a gradient has a lot of colors.
00:16:45.157 - 00:17:12.621, Speaker A: So this is for example, the work made in Bitcoin. And look at how stunning they are. And there's something like very geometric and just stunningly gorgeous. It gives Ranix Steer's work a different feel because I'll show you. I believe this is not using the code. This is using just pure Photoshop, if I'm not mistaken. And the line that's there, it's actually not a line.
00:17:12.621 - 00:18:01.727, Speaker A: It's made through the gradient, but it's not her tracing a line. So that's all in the episode. And how this relationship, in a sense, it's traveling through the mediums in a purely digital sense. We're going from Photoshop to code. And then I ask Ranix Deer does that impact when you see the results in the code and her learning to embrace that again, the neurons moving forward, making new connections and then her realizing I can live with this and actually I kind of like the effect of the code, which was a process for her. Then I ask her, does that impact the Photoshop, the pure Photoshop work? When you go back to just the Photoshop work, will that influence you? Because sometimes it does when you travel through the medium. So traveling through the mediums, but in a digital spheres from.
00:18:01.727 - 00:18:22.177, Speaker A: From different softwares, from. From visual software like Photoshop to code. Fascinatingly. Thank you bugged Matrix for bidding on this work. 303 Tezos. And Tezos is going up. So part of the only aesthetics, only aesthetic show on Accomparts 303 Tezos.
00:18:22.177 - 00:18:39.045, Speaker A: Thank you very much. I love this work and I'm very happy for you to have it. Big supporter and collector there on the Tezos. Blockchain. Maybe other blockchains too. So looking at the comments here from our last episode before the election. Feels like a world away.
00:18:39.045 - 00:18:49.645, Speaker A: Let's take a quick look. Eco Textile Studio thanks for the great show, Adrian. Well balanced, beautiful works and fun to watch. Thank you. Awesome to hear. Genresis. No, it's going to be great.
00:18:49.645 - 00:19:03.493, Speaker A: I hope this episode turns out to be great. It's been two and a half weeks here. Centero. Thanks, Adrian. Makes me very happy to know you liked it. I fell in love with those original illustrations. It took several months just to scan and cut every element in Atlas.
00:19:03.493 - 00:19:28.949, Speaker A: 1700 in total. Currently I'm using this material animating collages for an upcoming AV collection I've been making the last few years. And yes, it is not only a landscape. I'm trying to remember the work and so I'll have to bring this up. So it's been two and a half weeks, but thank you for sharing on this. Feel free to send me a link to the work there. Suntero to jog my memory.
00:19:28.949 - 00:19:45.665, Speaker A: Maybe a lot of you do remember Duran Land. Very interesting journal. Again, from my experience, ambiguity. This was important. So we were talking about this work here and how it is ambiguous. It is not taking aside, it is not didactic. Right.
00:19:45.665 - 00:20:06.837, Speaker A: The Sabbato's work that started the show. Let's go back. Very interesting journal. Again, from my experience, ambiguity is really a central element to the vitality of an artwork. Completely agree. Ambiguity is really playing with the will of solving oriented minds to nail down. To nail things down to something controllable.
00:20:06.837 - 00:20:32.439, Speaker A: But instead, when you swing the hammer, there is no nail anymore. It gives the artwork the chance to create a life of its own instead of being dominated and controlled by ideological concepts. Right. In a sense, it's Shakespeare. Right. What's one of the big delights of Shakespeare is it means two things or three things or four things at the same time. And there's no sense that it has to be read a certain way.
00:20:32.439 - 00:21:07.859, Speaker A: It's actually done on purpose, right? And all of a sudden it's just like so. And you know, that in itself starts to be like, you know, the structure of story. And then you start to, you know, how is this, you know, relating to the structure of reality? Like in a sense, but so really nice piece by Marginalia, also known as Sabato. It totally catches the Moment, indeed. Perfectly put. And creates a glimpse of artistic overcoming of the totally polarized political world we live in. Beautifully put.
00:21:07.859 - 00:21:17.771, Speaker A: I only can say art is the future. Thanks again, Pokobeli. My absolute pleasure. Pleasure. Duran Land. And yeah, it was a brilliant work. And as you say, it captured the moment.
00:21:17.771 - 00:21:49.791, Speaker A: And I want to return to ambiguity and the importance in future, we will return to this concept because I think it translates. It goes beyond mediums, it goes beyond even art style. Like it goes beyond sculpture and art and writing. Like it's. Actually, you could start to argue it's poetic in a global sense. It's a poetic element. It's a crucial poetic element, you might say.
00:21:49.791 - 00:22:04.709, Speaker A: I'm not even sure if that's the right word, but feature, shall we call it poetic? A feature of poetry. Right. And so we need to return to this concept. Thank you for highlighting it. Santiago Ruao, awesome to hear from you. Amazing video, my friend. Thank you.
00:22:04.709 - 00:22:22.155, Speaker A: And awesome to hear from you. Sabato weighs in. Poco. Hope you had a great trip to Bangkok and around the world. Yes, it's. I feel like James Bond here. I've been seeing, you know, I'm going and today, like I Woke up at 4 in order to do this show, waking up the neighbors here in Rome.
00:22:22.155 - 00:22:40.263, Speaker A: And I have a presentation later today at 10:00pm so that's kind of my day. And it's full in between. So again, thank you for the. Thank you. Bangkok was amazing. We'll talk more on that in the future. Thanks for featuring Election Anxiety on the COVID of your last journal.
00:22:40.263 - 00:23:18.141, Speaker A: I'm usually nervous to share works about current politics, but your thoughtful response really encourages me to keep doing so. Web3 may have its blind spots, but it is certainly a more ideological diverse space than the Web2 echo chamber we grew accustomed to. And I think there's a limit to the agitprop sloganeering that works well on Instagram, Tumblr or in real life protest spaces. Artists aren't necessarily preaching to the choir. So it means a lot of these drawings resonate with people across the political spectrum. Right. And even like Warhol made a Nixon work, but he didn't want to make it.
00:23:18.141 - 00:23:37.545, Speaker A: It was his friends in New York that were like, please make anti Nixon work. And so he put a green. We could look at that in a future show. We put like a green background with Nixon's image over top. I also, I think actually this is coming up here. I also love that you brought up Warhol and the wonderful dollar sign piece. Yeah, right.
00:23:37.545 - 00:24:27.797, Speaker A: In reference to ambiguity I got to go to the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh last month. I'd love to go there. And it was great to see his lesser known masterpieces and be reminded of his genius. It's true. Especially like I'll never forget seeing a work in Rome maybe a year or two ago, and it was a Warhol, 1980s work of a semi truck. And he didn't have enough room on his piece of paper, so he put another piece of paper and just kept drawing on it. And you just see, when you make a lot of work like Warhol did, and he's one of the most prolific artists probably in history, you do like the lesser known works like that semi truck that I saw, it reminds you, as you beautifully put here, Sabato, of his genius.
00:24:27.797 - 00:25:07.535, Speaker A: He truly is like his prolificness, his consistency, his inventiveness, always trying new things. You see a real engagement with image making and what image, what makes something beautiful and playing with that and not getting stuck, you know, playing within his style, but always kind of pushing it. You know, the bad painting period where he purposely paints bad. Right. I didn't see the dollar sign in real life, but I did see a giant room full of giant hammer and sickle screen prints. Yeah, Another great example. Warhol really understood the economy of images in contemporary capitalism and how these images can escape the pull of ideology.
00:25:07.535 - 00:25:38.509, Speaker A: A very surreal, right? Like, in a sense, what does surrealism do? It kind of decontextualizes images to a certain degree. It drains them of their kind of traditional context. And then you sort of see, you know, when you put the sewing machine and an umbrella on an operating table, all of a sudden you see the umbrella in a new light. You see, what is this sewing machine. Right. So. And in a sense, you see a similar thing with Warhol.
00:25:38.509 - 00:26:06.693, Speaker A: It's a kind of poetic device, I would say, which is again, not being deducted. Let's continue with Sabato here at the museum. I learned that during the 1972 elections, Warhol made a poster of President Nixon's face with the text Vote McGovern underneath it. Apparently Nixon tried to enlist Warhol a few years earlier, only to be ignored. So the poster didn't go over well and Warhol was audited by the IRS every year until his death. Funny to see that even Warhol took one for the team. Anyway, safe travels.
00:26:06.693 - 00:26:26.597, Speaker A: Thank you so. Indeed, Yeah. I didn't know the part about the irs. I remember the story. He didn't want to do it, but felt compelled to, I think from friends again in New York Ian Carlson this is very bad art. Thoughtless and irritating in its apathy. Or he probably does have some good thoughts.
00:26:26.597 - 00:27:19.433, Speaker A: But I have no idea what this is. So I'm not sure what work is being referred to, if it's Sabato's that started the work or somewhere else. But I think I'm very empathetic to people who don't have any idea what we're talking about here in terms of the art. Again, like I would say, like literally, physiologically, what's required to a certain degree here is for new neural connections to be made. And if those connections aren't made, I'm not like they have to be made first, otherwise the understanding will simply not be there. It's like Ranexter beautifully describes in the space, she had to expand her sense of what her work was in order to embrace the code based works that she was making. She literally had to expand her consciousness.
00:27:19.433 - 00:28:01.785, Speaker A: Neurons had to start connecting where they hadn't connected before. So perhaps that is what's happening here. Because I wonder to myself, if I saw my show and it was someone else presenting it and I saw it for the first time, would I like it? Would I like the art? And so, you know, in a sense I have a lot of empathy for people that are skeptical. Lena Gordiva Hey Adrian, Meta Metapolitics is really wittily or really witty. I dreamed to be in one of your shows someday. Well, actually you're in this show and I think I'm reshowing a work, this show that you showed on Twitter maybe three weeks ago or maybe a month ago that I also showed. So you have been on the show, Lena, just so you know.
00:28:01.785 - 00:28:29.305, Speaker A: But you are on again this episode. Mork Ningen GM Adrian not an intervention cartridge does not exist. Okay, so we're discussing this work here which we're looking at Shape based on a Famicom one case board label logos and price tag were made from scratch. Only real thing is the pic I took from a trash bag, but it was green. The final image is pretty big. Zoom it on objects. So thank you for the added details on the work.
00:28:29.305 - 00:28:44.919, Speaker A: And that is again Mork Ningen W74 Wojak under an hour. Yeah, exactly. A distant dream. Wojak thank you for the comment. Daniel Todd Hey Pokebelly, you're totally right. This piece was inspired by CMYK screen angles. Thanks so much for recognizing my work.
00:28:44.919 - 00:29:05.107, Speaker A: HD version available below. So of course, thank you for the comment. Daniel Glad to have you watching Neural Divine. Really enjoyed the show. Amazing Pixel art. Those works of Ken Xapita are stunning. They sure are, aren't they? So really enjoying Canx APA deserves a lot of credit and I'm going to reach out to them maybe for next week.
00:29:05.107 - 00:29:17.003, Speaker A: Next week's space. They really deserve a lot of credit for always pushing forward. Minty Fresh vibes. Hilarious opening piece. Thank you. Great to hear from you. Minty also a was a.
00:29:17.003 - 00:29:36.505, Speaker A: I is a host. Minty is a host on Rug radio there so someone I've known for a couple of years. Zizo, great to hear from you. And Gogolitis, awesome. Thanks for your show. After several months away, I've been browsing Twitter and Object for the past two days to get a sense of what's going on. I'm glad to hear that Object receives support from the Tezos Foundation.
00:29:36.505 - 00:29:51.301, Speaker A: That's great. So I guess that is happening. Object is truly a gem within the entire Web3 ecosystem. And the vibrancy among artists is real. Few blockchains can claim to be in the same position. And most of all, I'm glad you're still here. Still there.
00:29:51.301 - 00:30:08.797, Speaker A: Well, awesome to hear from you. Gogolitis and the feeling is mutual. It's always like it's just another. It just makes this show even better when I can go to Gogolitis work and put it on this show. So it's exciting to have you back. Awesome to hear from you. Yann Lucas Migone Fire is on Indeed.
00:30:08.797 - 00:30:18.645, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. Ernesto Ash. Thanks for the mention. I thought there were two pieces. It is one actually. A mix of AI Procreate, photomosh and automatic writing. Awesome.
00:30:18.645 - 00:30:34.145, Speaker A: Almost like that. What do we call that? Asymmetric writing I believe is what it's called where it's word they look. It looks like writing but it's just. But it has no meaning. I think that's what's going on there. Brain dead. Thanks for the highlight Adrian.
00:30:34.145 - 00:30:39.961, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you. Swerks. Thank you. Clown Vamp. The Sabato piece. Incredible. Yes.
00:30:39.961 - 00:30:51.055, Speaker A: Capturing the moment there. And Octetle. Thank you for the comment. I'm just going to scroll through the community. Thank you everybody for posting. We just broke 700 members. There's Dr.
00:30:51.055 - 00:31:08.079, Speaker A: Version with a beautiful new piece here and there is lfilter with some works. These are on Solana. There's the work on the left. There's Venta. New art for a new day and so very cool. And you see the painted and the AI Bogenta. Hi everyone.
00:31:08.079 - 00:31:29.633, Speaker A: So thank you for posting Rosetio putting out a work with art commissions. Fete to me. Thank you for posting a work on nice work in progress video there work procreate Kylo DZ balloons. So thank you everybody for posting here. Mr. Riro and everybody, Ilya Blizznet new work. Thank you for posting.
00:31:29.633 - 00:31:48.291, Speaker A: Beautiful work here, I believe digital painting and AI. Here is Fatima. And here is Katarina with a beautiful new work. I believe this is in the show, actually. So nice work. Katharina, Kurt Hustle Collective with a new work based on the previous work. So cool kind of Halloween mask.
00:31:48.291 - 00:32:05.099, Speaker A: Martin Jo with an edgy work here with a bear on a green candle. And here is Micarah. Thank you for posting. Plague with some cool what look like AI work. Spell and ask. Thank you for posting. Katarina, thank you for posting.
00:32:05.099 - 00:32:18.543, Speaker A: And Zizo, thank you for posting. Luke 500. Thank you for posting the link. Fata Mae and more. So thank you everybody. Retro Manny with a new work on object, Zizo Nifty Traps. So thank you everybody for posting.
00:32:18.543 - 00:32:41.527, Speaker A: We can't go through everything. We're only at November 14th. Thank you everybody for posting. Now, I think Tezos has taken a breather here, but it's significant. I think part of the reason, part of the reason, and this is interesting, I think part of the reason there's so much work being posted to Object right now that's fabulous is there's more incentive. It's $1.34 now.
00:32:41.527 - 00:33:12.155, Speaker A: I think it's like a $15 or something, last I checked. But it went as high as $1.34. You saw a huge climb, almost doubling, interestingly. And so of course, Tezos being the crypto that is used on Object, where a lot of the art, as you see all the white tabs here are from. So you'd buy it with Tezos for those that don't know. So interesting move in the market, traditional art market. Super interesting situation.
00:33:12.155 - 00:33:34.775, Speaker A: We just had a massive auction, a Magritte. And I don't know if we have it here. Here it is. A Magritte got $121 million at this auction. I think that blows the heck out of any previous record for surrealist work. I'm pretty sure, I'm not positive, but that sounds really high. It definitely blows Magritte's previous sales.
00:33:34.775 - 00:34:25.256, Speaker A: It is a record, as Katya Kazakhina says here. And so to me, it says a couple of things about what's going on in the contemporary art market. Because, of course, the contemporary art market has been suffering. There's no shortage of money for art though, which to me remember that Bloomberg article we were looking at where it said, you know, art, contemporary art market is suffering, but it has nothing to do with the art. Well, is it, is that the case if we're getting these massive. Like, I don't think there's a shortage of money, but I guess, let's put it this way, I think if we want to be fair and kind of dispassionate about it, it seems to me that the market is going towards here. The Ed Russia was another work that was bought and sold or sold for huge amounts.
00:34:25.256 - 00:35:06.279, Speaker A: The market is going to what's safe. And in a sense, I think what we see that is a similar thing to the stock market where you're seeing like, you know, the seven top stocks or whatever the case is, you know, in the nasdaq, really dominating and that almost being seen as a safety play. The market, there's a lot of money out there, but it wants to put itself somewhere safe. And the safety is seen in what are considered kind of a Magritte, you know, a Magritte masterpiece. Ed Russia, well known names, you know, Warhols seem to be doing fine. Right. So it's more the stuff that's on the edge of the risk curve.
00:35:06.279 - 00:35:34.023, Speaker A: The more experimental, the more, to a certain degree, you could say, daring for collectors to buy, but the more uncertain works that the market is not rewarding right now. Paul F. Austin so here we've been talking about this for a while, actually a couple of. I think we've been discussing this for a couple of years. But Paul F. Austin, this is what I'm talking about, bringing it all back home here. And I'm not even.
00:35:34.023 - 00:35:58.871, Speaker A: I'm not advocating psychedelics or anything, but in terms of how it works, your brain makes new neural connections on psychedelics. This is what's going on, I suspect, and this is what Paul F. Austin has been. I've been mentioning this on the program for a while. Your mind makes new conceptual connections and your life makes new meaningful connections. So first the neurons. You know, it's like you have to encourage the neurons to start, you know, connecting with each other.
00:35:58.871 - 00:36:26.931, Speaker A: It's probably really healthy for the brain, I suspect. So anyways, just interesting for Paul Austin to put that all out on in one very simple kind of line of reasoning. Let me see if I can get back to Hermipe. Hermipe, Hermipe. What has happened to Hermipe? Here, let me. Here we go. Let's see if we can find.
00:36:26.931 - 00:36:44.275, Speaker A: Because Hermipe has quite an interesting thing going on here. Translate. I will have a solo exhibition. I will be exhibiting woodblock prints, of course. Hermipe being the pixel artist here. Lithographs and storybooks I made this year. This I believe is going to be in Japan.
00:36:44.275 - 00:37:04.231, Speaker A: So very interesting. Here's the poster. One of the most innovative pixel artists in the world, I believe makes their work originally on their phone. Interestingly. So super interesting here. There. Dan Control, of course, prominent gradient artists that we've been following forever here.
00:37:04.231 - 00:37:14.263, Speaker A: I met him once in Rome. Had more time. I'd reach out. Look at these paintings. Fabulous paintings here by Dan Control. Look. I think they're oil on canvas.
00:37:14.263 - 00:37:35.005, Speaker A: Quite well done. So super impressive there as we run into the works here. And let me just. We'll do. Thanks, Mateo, to the Airbnb. Excellent. Stay.
00:37:35.005 - 00:37:51.181, Speaker A: Sorry, I have to write this. Okay, we're good. Dragon Pet. So look at this. So, Martin Bruce, this was a stunner. As I was saying, like many works could have. You could have made justifications for starting this show.
00:37:51.181 - 00:38:13.287, Speaker A: This was an absolute stunner here from Martin Bruce REC series GIF edition. Interestingly, Yuri J got it for very good price here. 69 tazos. This was part of the accompart show. Just a stunning work. Dragon here. The colors are oh so subtle.
00:38:13.287 - 00:38:35.711, Speaker A: The, you know, portrayal of the dragon here and just everything, the originality. Martin Bruce. Just a super original artist. Dragon Pet is the name of the work, 900 by 700 pixels. We have others. Roseworm. So putting out quite a few works here and you see some of the symmetry that Martin Bruce works with.
00:38:35.711 - 00:38:56.043, Speaker A: And then disrupting the symmetry here with what looks like kind of a sampled brush and then some kind of gift snow to give it. Dynamism. 900 by 700. Some more interesting work. Stretch two. So playing with the stretch feature, but then over not doing it across the entire image. Looks like it was done across the entire image.
00:38:56.043 - 00:39:19.443, Speaker A: But then there maybe this is put on top. You see the stretch going all over here and then disrupting the stretch. It's actually a pretty good technique in order to not make things look too. What's the word? Mundane. And so brilliantly done here. Gorgeous color as usual. And just wild work here from Martin Bruce edition of one.
00:39:19.443 - 00:39:42.709, Speaker A: And what did this sell for? 150 tazos. Here's another work. Good fuselage. And this came out November 11th. So putting out quite a few works here and again, the trademark kind of snowy GIF look. And here, just kind of a wild, unexpected, unpredictable work. Fabulous title and selling one at auction for 15 tezos.
00:39:42.709 - 00:40:08.435, Speaker A: It's an edition of two. And here's another one reusing the snake that we saw. The other, the other show snake inside, rocks outside. So interesting use of the snake here in a completely different context and I think using some physical elements here with the rocks that look painted. Edition of 10 for 15 tazos. Here's Gozo the fact. Great title.
00:40:08.435 - 00:40:35.551, Speaker A: So very cool work here by the mysterious Gozo. And and again animated digital collage by Gozo and I believe also use AI as you see here, SD materials, stable diffusion. So mixing AI with digital collage and animation. So very cool work. Edition of 20. Here's another one. The illusion.
00:40:35.551 - 00:41:03.555, Speaker A: This sold for 378 tazos. So 400 bucks on a one of one as part of the accompart's only aesthetic exhibition here. So almost looking again like old kind of architecture here. Ancient Roman architecture, even a mountain. Beautifully textured and everything brilliant. More use of AI and textures. Here's RJ Mechanical Dreams.
00:41:03.555 - 00:41:27.423, Speaker A: This is beautiful. Edition of 1. Going to Neon Monk for 333 tezos and Neon Monk on a collecting tear. And look at how beautiful this is. These three figures here. And again I think composed by AI and then using different exports of pixelation to create different textures here. And even I think a little bit of dragging.
00:41:27.423 - 00:41:58.785, Speaker A: And we have a few works by rj. The colors in this one are stunning. And you see here almost looking like the pixels, these kind of wide angle wide, you know, three by one almost pixels or two by one pixels being stretched out and almost transformed seemingly on the couch. Brilliant color here in this series through the red litten windows. Here's another one. And really beautiful works here. And so again different kind of outputs.
00:41:58.785 - 00:42:17.881, Speaker A: This went for 250 tezos. And here's another one that went for 250 tezos. So nice sales going on here from RJ. Beautiful work again. AI and pixel painting as it says here, 5,000 by 5,000. Here's another one by RJ. Touching grass AI in pixel painting.
00:42:17.881 - 00:42:41.285, Speaker A: And you see here getting pretty edgy with different kinds of textures here. Almost looking like some stretching is going on. And here just really interesting color as well. So very interesting work from rj. Here's another one. This is how your email finds you. So again, all sorts of innovation going on here.
00:42:41.285 - 00:43:05.355, Speaker A: Here's another one. The Acrobats. Kind of a more traditional almost 19th century kind of theme or early 20th century. Making it new here with some nice. And again not worrying if the pixels are a bit fuzzy, maybe a little Magic wand in here and everything. One more Internet Explorer and another figure here and a lot of filling. So very cool work.
00:43:05.355 - 00:43:26.183, Speaker A: Here's Skomra woman with rare in game item. Is that what it says? With another rare in game item. Interesting title. Fantastic color here. Also using AI and incorporating it into the painting. And look at these textures here along the edges and just throughout the entire work. Super interesting piece.
00:43:26.183 - 00:44:19.169, Speaker A: Here's another one, Summer as myself, also by skomra, edition of 20. And so again, super interesting edges here with Skomra and colors. Here's Internet artists. And I'm not sure if I've called a show Internet artists yet or not, but here is, you know, so it's kind of a good name for what we're doing over here in a lot of respects is these are, you know, rather than post Internet artists, it's Internet artists, as I like to say. Beautiful, interesting, ambiguous as to what is going on here right in the screens. Are they facing us or is this one facing towards this artist over here? And then this wonderful top area of the image. The lines there, stable diffusion.
00:44:19.169 - 00:44:40.285, Speaker A: Diffusion once again creating these awesome textures. Aura One more from Skamra edition of one. And beautifully done here. So continuing to evolve and make progress. This went for only 15 tezos for this edition of one. So deals to be had on Skomra's work. Here's nub 1914, Muchas Mariposas.
00:44:40.285 - 00:45:11.181, Speaker A: So playing here with this different kind of brush work and. But then the contrasting this brush that's gone to make these butterflies with this beautiful, actually simple black and white kind of gradient work with almost signature kind of line across it. And up there as well in the corners. From Neuv, 1914 edition of 5 for 11 Tazos. Let's continue. I guess Mariposa is a butterfly, if I had to guess. Similar technique here.
00:45:11.181 - 00:45:30.661, Speaker A: And then we see some gradients on the left. Just very. Just again, beautiful color here. Again, this kind of asymmetry in the. And small. Interestingly small work here. And this asymmetry almost in this kind of framing device here.
00:45:30.661 - 00:45:45.671, Speaker A: It's thick there, it's just a line. And then on the right and bottom, we don't see any framing device. Bit of a bird there. Again, it's ambiguous. Is it a flower? Is it a bird? Look at how small it is. Super interesting. Here's some more Mariposa.
00:45:45.671 - 00:46:12.525, Speaker A: Entre Flores. So maybe butterfly in the flower perhaps, or on the flower. So beautiful work there. More traditional kind of just straight up gradient work from Nav. This is edition of five. Selling out at 10 tezos each here, an edition of five by. And is this listed? This is on secondary for 18 tezos, which is turning into real money here, $18.24.
00:46:12.525 - 00:46:43.047, Speaker A: It doesn't take much to leverage up the. The Tezos price to make these artworks all of a sudden super expensive. I mean, you go to two Taser, two bucks on Tezos, you're in a completely different world. And you know, and yeah, so it does make you wonder in a sense. Like when I look at the Tezos, the market, the capitalization of the. And we should look at that in a future show of the Tezos crypto. I think there's a billion of them.
00:46:43.047 - 00:47:35.167, Speaker A: So let's say it's at A$10 right now at 1.1 billion. Like to me I see the value, you know, and maybe it's totally unfair, but the value of Tezos is the art that's on it in my, you know, as I jokingly say, half jokingly object is the front end of Tezos, you know. And I mean, I'm sure there are other things and no shade on the other projects there, but just in my own experience. And there's also a subject which we haven't discussed here again just for a matter of time, but I think it should be on the next show because I have that bookmarked this wonderful user interface by Michael Macasso and also another developer there whose name escapes me at the moment. But we're going to look closer at that whole subject. SBJKT Software in a future show.
00:47:35.167 - 00:47:52.115, Speaker A: Sobre Roselle. So more butterflies and flowers from Nev 1914. This is 15 Tezos, edition of six. Here's another one. So just very, very cool work here, keeping it original and new. Just a beautiful series, isn't it? And here are also a couple other works. Postel de Lajos.
00:47:52.115 - 00:48:17.387, Speaker A: So this is the more kind of abstract works I'd be tempted to call them from NUV 1914. And here's another one, Karpa. There's a real consistency in the weirdness, you might say, across these works. Here's another one. This was part of the only aesthetic exhibition, so it's an edition of one. How much did this go for? Only for 40 tazos. What a steal.
00:48:17.387 - 00:48:46.945, Speaker A: Anov 1914. One of one for 40 tazos. Those auctions, especially a one week auction, you can really get deals because people really forget, you know, so super interesting. And here a bit of a landscape with more of a traditional frame on it from nuv. So beautiful work here. Here is Zuozhou. All the games we played, where did they go? This work I may need to buy on secondary because it is so brilliant.
00:48:46.945 - 00:49:19.225, Speaker A: Kind of a ping pong. A ping pong work. Let me quickly get. Okay, thanks, Mateo. So beautiful, right? I tell you, it is a miracle to do this show today at all. So forgive the lack of the difficulty or forgive the difficulties that are in progress here. Work in progress by Uri J.
00:49:19.225 - 00:49:51.185, Speaker A: Look at these beautiful works. I think this is on object one. These are starting to look like oil paintings, aren't they? These are starting to look fabulous in the computer chair. You know, as David Hickey said of Rauschenberg, undeniable is undenied. And when I start seeing this kind of work, this is what rings through my head here. Undeniable is undenied. I mean, there's something that is clearly.
00:49:51.185 - 00:50:15.585, Speaker A: There's a lot of intellect that has been put into these artworks. There's a lot of process, there's a lot of everything. There's a lot of thought you can see, there's a lot of experience. Look at this great road in the background. So almost kind of looking like a Rural America series. And again, each one having its own feel, kind of internal, kind of surreal. All Uri J.
00:50:15.585 - 00:51:11.841, Speaker A: And so again, effects on effects, and just brilliant compositions, I might add. It's important to note here, these are brilliant compositions. I mean, look at where we're looking at the perspective. Have you seen a normal oil painting that's like this? Then you include all of the innovation that's going on digitally on top of it and interesting. It makes you wonder, and I assume not. But put it this way, why not use AI as part of the compositional? Because, of course, Uri J just does the outlines as far as I understand Uri J's process, and then starts filling it with different patterning and then effects on the patterning and effects until you get something that really couldn't be predicted. When I see such inventive compositions, it does make me wonder, you know, so anyway, beautiful, brilliant.
00:51:11.841 - 00:51:32.489, Speaker A: It really feels like Yuri J's work here too. Bath House. Look at this roof. So again, looking. The gloves, beautiful. The ax, again, kind of a rural outdoor kind of look to it. And so this is an edition of 10 now 178tezos.
00:51:32.489 - 00:52:02.949, Speaker A: There's, I think I saw Howdy Do, Old Granny do on the scene, also posting this work, which I thought was quite witty on X with the paper airplane flying above the city. Kind of a bit of a joke work, but quite beautifully done. So anyways, brilliant works from Yuri J. We're going to look at some more. I think it's on verse, if I'm not mistaken. Next episode, All Time Low. So a new work here by Uxene in the last couple of weeks.
00:52:02.949 - 00:52:29.397, Speaker A: Playing with the financial side of the crypto scene. Classic kind of crypto art. Playing with trading cards and some of the financial bars and then some the monk figures, for lack of a better term. Beautiful collaboration here. Resurrection between myth and Axene also. So here is Xene's kind of grim reaper. There is myth being resurrected.
00:52:29.397 - 00:52:50.477, Speaker A: Kind of a perfect. A great collaboration here. And again, something that you really feels like you can collaborate. You know, there's also, you know, Warhol and Basquiat famously collaborated, but it really works well in digital. It's a lot easier. You don't need to be in the same city. This is like a global collaboration, you know.
00:52:50.477 - 00:53:09.927, Speaker A: Aksin out of Turkey, Myth out of Argentina. Right. An international collaboration here. Edition of 22. These are hilarious. So the consumer products continue to come from myth and this time doing like an Oreo ice cream sandwich. Demon Lemon.
00:53:09.927 - 00:53:20.845, Speaker A: The myth Oreo. Just brilliant. Beautifully done even. Look at that background color. Perfect on super rare here. A baseball card. A lot of humor coming from the myth.
00:53:20.845 - 00:53:37.005, Speaker A: I quite enjoy this field on one side and myth clouds on the other. I feel like I recognize the series here of this myth. League baseball. Like a 1970s style baseball card. Hilarious. Here is Reny Fish. Strange nature rituals.
00:53:37.005 - 00:54:10.785, Speaker A: So a ton of just brilliant art here. We're about halfway through the art and a more quieter work, so to speak here. And interesting hands that have been added here to this. Not typical. So Strange nature rituals. Interesting. Are those the artist's hands we see here? Mystical hands orchestrate a dance of strange creatures and living forests.
00:54:10.785 - 00:54:30.185, Speaker A: And this is an edition of 10 for 15 tazos still available. Hasdrubal Waffle and Cedar Plank. Also the same artist here. So this look at. Wait till you see how much this went for. This went for 13 for $1,400. $1,416 for hasdrubal waffle.
00:54:30.185 - 00:54:47.381, Speaker A: Amazing. And I think was Neon Monk and this anonymous account. There were at least two wallets that were bidding. Yuri J. An early bid at 130. Tezos hitting his stride. Cedar Plank, also known as Hastruba Waffles.
00:54:47.381 - 00:55:06.685, Speaker A: So here are some other works. Showgirls Part 2. This is on object playing with the pop culture references, I assume. Showgirls the movie. And this went so offers coming in at 150tezos. Neon Monk. Huge collector I think spent as we saw with die with the most likes.
00:55:06.685 - 00:55:28.945, Speaker A: Spent a huge amount of money on a one of one for with die with the most likes. Here's more. Cedar Plank. So totally original. Hilarious Works here often for those that don't know. Often using in browser tools and different softwares. I think cutting and pasting between them sometimes just sticks within one.
00:55:28.945 - 00:55:44.083, Speaker A: We did a great space with Cedar Plank about a year and a half ago. Maybe time to see if Cedar is up for another one. A cool million. Another beautiful work here. Interesting. Oh, there's the banana. So the banana coming in.
00:55:44.083 - 00:56:04.865, Speaker A: And here super rare. Taking a lot of criticism for their banana contest. And there's more bananas. So interesting. And a cool million edition of 5. So maybe referring to the banana work there and all sorts of references and sold for 100 tezos. Here's another one by Cedar Plank and I think this was just sent to Ilay.
00:56:04.865 - 00:56:36.697, Speaker A: Neon Monk putting an offer in at 350tazos. So pretty cool work here. So Neon Monk feeling the Hasdrubal waffle vibe here. And again you see kind of different here. It's kind of pixelated in the back and then within the door it kind of looks like different tools or at least the stamp tool on a certain software. See gradients in the background, different textures. I'm not even sure interestingly what I'm seeing anymore in Hasdrubal Waffles.
00:56:36.697 - 00:57:07.011, Speaker A: Work in terms of the. Where like it's very chaotic and fun and you know, it's interesting because when you look at the early Hasdrubal waffle, you see kind of a more call it simple approach. And here we're seeing a lot more chaotic elements. We're seeing like a lot of things going on here. So it's just super interesting and beautiful work here. Ed Marola stair. And so more work.
00:57:07.011 - 00:57:37.761, Speaker A: So a dragged brush here, a sampled brush. Interestingly how Ed is able to get almost a three dimensional feel to the brush. And here so creating a landscape out of nothing, really out of his head as you've seen. If you've ever watched Ed Morola's videos here. So stare there is Ed Morola. This is for people of Tezos. And a beautiful self portrait here with different kinds of techniques being applied here.
00:57:37.761 - 00:57:58.695, Speaker A: Classic kind of frame, the dithering in the background, an insistent sitting in the grass here with the classic vase and the computer. Just awesome. Another work here by Ed Morola. The sprites that guide the canoe said something but I couldn't understand. Interesting title only a dollar. Very nice. Small interesting piece here.
00:57:58.695 - 00:58:28.823, Speaker A: Edition of 250. And one more tegodego is here incorporating a little audio. Pretty fun six second loop. And that is 200 Tezos edition of one. As we continue here. Here's Enigmatris with the work posted to X and not sure if there is any text with that last time I had an issue here. So we're just going to leave.
00:58:28.823 - 00:58:58.161, Speaker A: Looks like a bowl of fruit. ASCII style. Kind of like that original first work that we came across and started the show with. And so returning to that theme, pretty powerful still life work by Enigmatris. Here is Mumble Boy. So again using collage, physical and digital elements here in combination and with these wild kind of collage like compositions, it keeps changing. Addition of 116 tazos.
00:58:58.161 - 00:59:17.499, Speaker A: Here's Dan Control putting out a whole bunch of works here. And so playing with repetition. So doing and repeating elements that I think he's already made before. Say this character here which is repeated this cartoon character. And then this beautiful green background. We see a similar version. Akena.
00:59:17.499 - 00:59:34.901, Speaker A: I'm not sure if that's the name of a character again making one and then repeating. Very digital. Beautiful gray background there. Here's Alice in Wonderland re emulating it in his gradient style. Right. And then repeating it again. Perfectly chosen background color there.
00:59:34.901 - 00:59:56.511, Speaker A: Alice edition of one. I think that sold for a 250 if I'm not mistaken. Here's Jake Studios Storm before the calm and cool use of pixelation in here. Draw pixelation. And here kind of the royal couple here. And I think that's Jake Studios on the right. And there are some pyramids upside down, pixelated clouds.
00:59:56.511 - 01:00:17.255, Speaker A: There is. It's almost like an ancient Egyptian type or monarchy. Portrait of a monarchy monarchical couple here with Jake Studio's stream of consciousness like artwork. And beautifully done flat sky by the way. An interesting animation there as well. And here's Dan Control. So slightly out of order here.
01:00:17.255 - 01:00:36.113, Speaker A: I'm working fast. Look at these Pikachu's again perfect background color. So as you. I hope you're noticing for you know, and for those that are new Masterpiece Theater here as you're seeing. I mean this is two and a half weeks. So a different perspective, you know. So it's kind of worth, you know.
01:00:36.113 - 01:01:16.295, Speaker A: And you see the volume of work that's coming out of note and of interesting of sophistication. Right. So here, Sonic the Hedgehog here Dan Control playing again with maybe a character from 3D software. Interesting color in the background again here is this is Quampa with some works here. As I look at that, 13,000 retweets, 1.6 million. I haven't seen views this high since Popple got 4 million views.
01:01:16.295 - 01:01:31.827, Speaker A: These are real numbers here. So congratulations to Quampa. Look at this. And so, whoa, that is shocking. 13,000 retweets, 1.6 million likes. So this is exciting.
01:01:31.827 - 01:01:55.515, Speaker A: Your work can go viral on X, in a sense. What this tells me is you can't ignore X as an artist anymore. That's what that tells me. 1.6 million views. How many followers does like when you get that kind of views? He probably picked up or I'm not sure, they probably picked up maybe 10,000 followers, I'm guessing out of that. That is impressive.
01:01:55.515 - 01:02:26.331, Speaker A: Amazing. Ezra Eslin berserk. And you know what? It does also, you know how we saw the comment where the skepticism where I was feeling empathy towards the skeptic, towards the art scene. But it does show that the art that we're showing here, there is a resonance of a lot of these artists with the public. Interestingly, that there is an audience for it, clearly, as we see with Quampa. I mean, that is like, you know, you get 1.6 million views.
01:02:26.331 - 01:02:46.027, Speaker A: Like, that's almost like a career making situation, one could argue. Let's continue. Ezra Eslin, berserk. So here maybe a warrior princess with a huge sword. Of course, the Berserkers, I think were famous Danish Vikings, if I'm not mistaken. So perhaps a reference to that here. Not sure.
01:02:46.027 - 01:03:08.877, Speaker A: In this beautiful sky. So Ezra Eslin, kind of often satirical violence. Here's another work. These. This is on Create Party app. So not exactly sure what's going on here, but you see Louis Osborne, the GMer with a cool trading card series. So no shortage of the Predictor.
01:03:08.877 - 01:03:26.345, Speaker A: Right? So these are great. The Scammer, brilliant trading card series here. The Whale by Lewis Osborne, the Achiever. Beautiful, beautiful series here. So mint a pack. They're trading cards. So pretty rad party app.
01:03:26.345 - 01:03:56.927, Speaker A: I don't know how long you can do this for, but this is 2004 minted Mintford's, you know, probably bringing in like at least a few hundred bucks, maybe quite a bit more. Nine hours to go. Katarina. Create Draw Attack as we pass the hour mark. Nice background color, by the way. And here we see one of these great distorted figures here. And with a taken notes, draw it or about to draw with a pencil and paper edition of edition of 15.
01:03:56.927 - 01:04:21.171, Speaker A: The myth in collaboration with Tornado Rodriguez here. So not exactly. Yeah, it is a collaboration here. It kind of looks like the myth character, doesn't it? Or Mike Tyson tattoo. So interesting collab here. Probably starting with a myth composition and then right, the mythsun and then tornado finishing it off in object 98. Super cool edition of one.
01:04:21.171 - 01:04:35.107, Speaker A: And that is 200 tezos at auctions. Sold. Amazing. Lucas Ox Pixel Beach. So cool landscape here from Lucas Ox. Very nice piece. Kind of glitched out a little bit.
01:04:35.107 - 01:04:52.051, Speaker A: And that's an addition of 11. And that is sold out at 650. And here's Kristen Roos, portal number two. And I'll show you portal number one in a second. Again using a lot of retro tools, vintage software you might call it. And so here it is zoomed in. I mean pretty radio actually.
01:04:52.051 - 01:05:13.947, Speaker A: So Kristen Roos, you know, really exploring different vintage softwares and here a different kind of portal using monochromatic or gray color. Desaturated color scheme here. Edition of 10. This is sold out at 15 tezos each. So these artists starting to bring in the cash. Someone Still Loves yous by Vera Molnar. Look at this.
01:05:13.947 - 01:05:34.489, Speaker A: This is an edition of one only 20 tazos by Greg Nishumika. Edition of one. It's pretty cool and it seems to be a homage to Vera Molnar. So 17 of 150. Pretty cool, isn't it? And it kind of looks like it is made using. It says Office Generative Art. Kind of looks like it's made using Excel.
01:05:34.489 - 01:05:54.651, Speaker A: Here's some cool work by Kareem Safa and Lokmi. And this is just one of the works here. As you see, it kind of looks generative and some of the Twitter works like it reminds me of these 1980s video games and they were moving up and down. I'll try and show more. More works. This is on Highlight xyz. I'll try to show more from this series.
01:05:54.651 - 01:06:11.215, Speaker A: Look, you can do keyboard and double click in the center. Yeah. So it's interactive. So interesting piece. Here's Lena Gordiva, who we heard from in the intro. I follow you. So I'm pretty sure I showed this originally when it was displayed on X.
01:06:11.215 - 01:06:32.565, Speaker A: Just an awesome piece here with the screens. Almost like a security worker looking at all the screens here and everything. I follow you. Edition of 10. 25 tezos each. Just listed here is Sophie ogore edition of 8. I picked up one, I'm not sure.
01:06:32.565 - 01:06:52.781, Speaker A: And more available here. And you double click. They're kind of like these interactive HTML works. I've become a huge fan of Sophia Agora. In the last just super original artist and in the last few weeks here. Here's Gio Mariani so posting this to X. I think this is new work.
01:06:52.781 - 01:07:18.983, Speaker A: I'm not positive but pretty cool. So awesome to see a real pixel art pioneer here on the Tezos blockchain. Posting more work here is Sachu the arty kind of a. Almost has the pixel art factory look. But we see video game references with the Pac man and but what also looks like circuit board kind of look. Gamers conciseness edition of 15 now on secondary selling out at 10 tezos each. Pretty good.
01:07:18.983 - 01:07:35.413, Speaker A: Here's another work here. And this mint ended. How many were minted? Can we see 224 minted at 0.00 basically 1. So not bad. I mean I think that brings in. I think if I'm not mistaken that's about 0.2
01:07:35.413 - 01:07:56.875, Speaker A: eth which is 600 bucks. Not bad at all. And here you see different, you know, trading cards seemingly and these really wonderful kind of wide angle works here. White background. I absolutely love it. Probably reusing elements. I mean totally awesome.
01:07:56.875 - 01:08:15.915, Speaker A: So loving where this is all going here. 224 minted. Just awesome. Here's another work posted again. Taking nine works that were put on rodeo and then turning them into a dream jam. And here I believe I brought it large. Let's loop this.
01:08:15.915 - 01:08:28.722, Speaker A: And there we go. Brought up large for you here. So you see how I mean amazing this all looks here. Putting nine of these works together. Dream Jam. I love it. Even the title just rad.
01:08:28.722 - 01:08:59.203, Speaker A: So totally rad. Artists there a couple of more by figments same artists also known as Kappen Server Revelation I think this is called. So cool combination of dynamic and static pixels which creates its own kind of poetry here. Beautiful and smaller pixels with larger pixels as well. Horizontal pixels, all kinds of different combinations. 0 the 1 edition of 16 and selling for now. 15 tazos I think on secondary maybe still primary mind debug.
01:08:59.203 - 01:09:23.394, Speaker A: So another work kind of playing with meditation and different styles here. What looks like abstracted computer code or processed computer code. Very cool work. $10 and one Tazo sent that is on primary and continuing on. Here's bite by bit with a cool landscape. Ow or uwu. A very interesting piece here.
01:09:23.394 - 01:09:52.788, Speaker A: This is using Graphics 2 from 2007. More brilliant works. Sabato El Clasico referring to El Super Classico I believe won my favorite titled tournament of all sports, El Super Classico. And look at this. This ballet called soccer celebrated here with these brilliant eyes of, you know, the Heads as eyes. Quite brilliant abstraction there by Sabato. And here's the ball with a strange triangle on it.
01:09:52.788 - 01:10:08.911, Speaker A: Maybe that's just a logo or something. So beautiful color by the way as well. Kind of the light green perhaps referencing the field. I managed to get one here. It's still available, surprisingly at 20 Tezos. Still available. Edition of 33.
01:10:08.911 - 01:10:23.559, Speaker A: I was very happy to pick one of these up. And great drama here. Wonderful. I love sports works. I think very rich visual content. Here's another one. Belle Epoque by Sabato who did the work that started last episode.
01:10:23.559 - 01:10:39.631, Speaker A: This was a part of the comparts exhibition. This was edition of one selling to Neon Monk who is on a tear for 500 tazos. I managed to pick up this work by Peterel. This is an edition of one. It was only five tezos. It was up for a week. And look at this.
01:10:39.631 - 01:11:11.331, Speaker A: Edited ROM corruption. So playing with Nintendo Glitch ROM and then editing it, using it as basically source material rather than just going straight up Glitch ROM and then saying what can I make with this? Quite interesting. Again, as I always say here, we're just scratching the surface of what is possible in digital art. And to me this is just another example. It's like oh, of course you can do that. And then all of a sudden it's like this is a whole world that opens up to you now here. Classic Nintendo Glitch Rom Haiti Rockette with some beautiful works.
01:11:11.331 - 01:11:28.163, Speaker A: This was on the Akump art exhibition. Let's see how much this sold for a Haiti rocket. One of one. And so still at auction here. Let's see how much time is. Is there only 7 minutes and 51 cents. Is that right? Should.
01:11:28.163 - 01:11:48.755, Speaker A: Should I bid on this? Haiti Rockette one of one. When did this bid? One hour ago. Wow, wow, wow. Okay, we have to continue the show. Ultrafly. Okay. Loving these works.
01:11:48.755 - 01:12:18.377, Speaker A: You know, with war in the air, I think Ultrafly. These are so, you know, just like Sabato's work was topical, this is super topical. And this beautiful and beautifully executed here with the static kind of hexes on top and the bottom. Here's the aircraft carrier. Really dope as the text says. Says they're called clearly edition of one. And that went to Mikey Wilson for only 23 tazos and actually he.
01:12:18.377 - 01:12:30.615, Speaker A: It turned into a one of one. Totally rad. This is also on only aesthetic part of a compart show. Elna Frederick. This is called Girl. Interesting piece. Kind of like music.
01:12:30.615 - 01:12:49.695, Speaker A: Almost like DJ mixer or vinyl or cd. Almost abstracted. Though, because it almost looks like a cd, but it's probably vinyl with the. With the tonearm there. And then it almost looks like a big mixing board. Interesting piece. Just playing with the interfaces of DJing.
01:12:49.695 - 01:13:10.447, Speaker A: Interestingly calling it Girl Plaque and calling it girl. This is 444 tazos and still available at auction. But you'd have to. That is a one of one. Here's Kyle Flemmer. Save yourself beautifully getting these super rich textures here from Kyle Flemmer. And so beautiful work here.
01:13:10.447 - 01:13:26.145, Speaker A: This was posted in the fake whale art market. 28 tezos. Here's ex mortal Arcadia. So just tons of beautiful artwork here in the last two and a half weeks. Here's Ex Mortal. You know, with this rad beautiful glitch. Here's another one, Badlands again.
01:13:26.145 - 01:13:40.961, Speaker A: Another work that could start this show so easily. Beautiful. I really love the negative space of the beach with this almost like the wind glitch, wind coming through it. Beautiful work there. Here's Rannoch Steer. I'm not sure if this is with Kiro or not. Cool.
01:13:40.961 - 01:14:02.035, Speaker A: Interesting work here. I think it's just Ranix Steer video painting of sorts. And of course I follow Ranix Steer. Here's Salawaki, the best. So also playing with the banana. I think the banana went for five or six million dollars to Justin sun, who I think started the Tron cryptocurrency. So here playing with duct tape and a goat.
01:14:02.035 - 01:14:18.675, Speaker A: Not sure exactly what the references are, but really well executed. And of course that is the Salawaki character. And continuing on as we move into AI, here's time. Also the artist formerly known as Santiago. Best weekend ever. Number four. Beautiful AI artwork here, I believe.
01:14:18.675 - 01:14:39.605, Speaker A: Yeah, I'd say that's AI artwork. Beautiful here. This is AI edition of 28 or open edition for three tazos for another three days. And here's another work by Time, AI and Gimp. So cool work here. Just zoom in a little bit. And yeah, massive work here.
01:14:39.605 - 01:15:00.985, Speaker A: So just more interesting AI art from Santiago. And here's no hygiene Keck999. And this was also on only aesthetic, a compart show. So a one of one. And how much did this go for? This went for 40 tazos. So good deal on a no hygiene work. They're one of one.
01:15:00.985 - 01:15:26.555, Speaker A: And here's strange thing with a pretty interesting. Almost looking like a police vest here with a strange thing AI artwork on it. So again playing with fashion and AI and modern and renaissance. Thank you for joining me and thank you for your patience and I hope to put out another show, hopefully on Monday. And until next time, take care.
