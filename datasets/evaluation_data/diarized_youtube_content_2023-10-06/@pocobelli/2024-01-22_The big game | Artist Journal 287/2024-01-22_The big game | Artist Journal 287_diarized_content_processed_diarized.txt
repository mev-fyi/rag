00:00:02.960 - 00:00:23.502, Speaker A: There is no more time to delay. I cannot put it off for another minute. I have a hard stop here in an hour, let's say in 25 minutes. So I'm gonna run through this episode. I had an extra coffee, and I am ready to go. Welcome back. Artist Journal, Monday, January 22, 2024.
00:00:23.502 - 00:00:57.420, Speaker A: Broadcasting from deep, deep in the inferno. Here I am on circle eight, bulge four, which is a ditch deep in hell. It is dramatic, it is incredible. But let's not get off topic. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. Welcome back and thank you for the massive, massive response the other day. Is this the long version? That's hilarious, because that, you know, it's good thing we don't have the long version of that track every day.
00:00:57.420 - 00:01:27.564, Speaker A: Otherwise I'd probably talk for a minute and a half, half as it wound down. Anyways, welcome back. Look at this fantastic work here. I'm sure a lot of you saw it. It definitely was a head turner. So this is element Li, if you've never heard before, this is element Li. And element Li is a pixel artist, experimental, you know, as far as I remember, the description on object, experimental pixel artist that uses a smartphone.
00:01:27.564 - 00:02:00.644, Speaker A: And so this is quite significant, I think, what we're seeing here, because we're seeing some of element Li's experimental pixel art, as you'll see here. But, of course, as you can see, it is physical. It is on a piece of cardboard, interestingly, which has a couple. A couple of things to say about that laser engraving, and it's quite powerful. I'll show you the tweet in a second, but I just want us to get the full effect. And actually, quite an interesting. In the sense that you can see how it works.
00:02:00.644 - 00:02:31.688, Speaker A: You can see how it works in the sense that the part of the cardboard that is burnt out, you know, engraved or, you know, laser. So you assume it's being burnt out, it turns dark for. Because of the light and also just because of the inside, the nature of cardboard. The inside of the cardboard. So, I mean, you see how powerful it is that it can get every little pixel here. Really brilliantly done. I'm also really kind of excited by how you can just burn a little bit.
00:02:31.688 - 00:02:51.248, Speaker A: You know, you can do, like, different. It's not an on off switch. It is. How much burning do you want? I assume you leave it on longer. Right. And they have this here in Berlin, I mean, just at the art supply store, the really big ones. It's modular for those that are watching from Berlin, modular at Moritz Platts.
00:02:51.248 - 00:03:25.838, Speaker A: They have, like, a whole kind of little area with windows and looks like a counter where you can do your laser engraving. I think that's what they call it. So, you know, makes you, you know, so seeing this, because one thing is to do it on just any piece of material. This is quite brilliant, and it evokes a lot of things, primarily Rauschenberg, which we're going to look at. Look at in a second here. But as you can see, just super interesting work. And, you know, just on the point of the cardboard, though, you see how, you know, just the first, it's a mass produced object.
00:03:25.838 - 00:04:11.344, Speaker A: So there's something kind of inherently, you know, both, you know, both universal and pop about it, right? Because it's something that we all deal with. If you've ever had a package shipped to your home, it is in cardboard. We're all deeply familiar with it. Plus you get all of the random things that happen with a piece of cardboard. Of course, this was folded up. You get all this detail, and that also becomes a kind of canvas of sorts. You know, it's kind of like a first layer, a ready made first layer that you're working from, which oftentimes, you know, a texture which will kind of give, you know, and that texture puns basically, or overlaps with the image itself that you're working on.
00:04:11.344 - 00:04:50.608, Speaker A: And isn't it interesting there? I mean, it's so dark, it almost looks like it's marker on top, but it's not. I think it's extra deep, you know, laser engraving, and you just see how powerful it is here and what's also beautiful about it. Just finally on this, as we run through this episode, once again, so you have, and again, this is back to the traveling through the mediums. You have the, on the digital screen, you have a perfect square. You give it to the laser engraver, or maybe you have your own. However it works. Let's say you hand it over the counter, you get it back.
00:04:50.608 - 00:05:25.640, Speaker A: You're not going to get a perfect square because now you're dealing with material reality. So you get this, you know, as I like to call it, an alchemical transformation, because all of a sudden, the pixel is no longer just a pixel. It is something different. It has transformed. It is something different. And again, you also get, even though it's this, you know, quote unquote cheap material of cardboard, all of a sudden, this work of art is invested with new preciousness. So just a really interesting work, interesting choice, I might add, of image.
00:05:25.640 - 00:06:06.094, Speaker A: You know, element Li has so many brilliant images which we've been looking at for, I think, over a year now, just such an interesting artist making it look easy by what's being left out and by stopping at certain points, you know, to a certain degree. We could call element Ly's images raw within our earlier discussion and look at how kind of wonderfully it's not too big. I mean, this is like a regular cardboard box, 66 by 84. It's not tiny at the door. Laser engraving on cardboard module and free edge. So not exactly sure what that means. We have a couple more pictures here, so just kind of up close and personal here, as you can see.
00:06:06.094 - 00:06:54.264, Speaker A: And again, the randomness of physical reality, which is something else we've commented on over the last few months. You see an action here underneath in the areas that have been removed by the laser engraving, that top layer of cardboard. So very, just super interesting here. I mean, again, for me, this could be at a museum, and if I didn't know anything about element Li, and then I walked into, you know, hamburger Banoff here, the contemporary art museum or the Neue National Galerie, which is probably like the 20th century, let's call it late 19th, if that. It's mostly 20th century there. If you had this in a special exhibition or just on the wall, I'd go, wow, this is pretty contemporary. This is really cool.
00:06:54.264 - 00:07:25.554, Speaker A: This is element Li. This is element Li, you know, our friend from this scene here. So just very exciting. Cardboard as a medium, as you saw there, especially using it in this way. Now, a lot of people have used it. Probably Rauschenberg, as far as I understand, is probably the first. I mean, or maybe there were others before, but we might say, most famously the earliest, as you see here, this was a whole series, 1971 72, the great Robert Rauschenberg here.
00:07:25.554 - 00:08:13.468, Speaker A: And you see, most of you who have been to you who go to museums will be familiar with one of these works here that you've seen, you know, quite, you know, similar here, but done in a completely different way with element ly. But that's also part of what's cool about what element ly is doing is it also references back, I'd argue, intentionally or not, to the tradition. And it goes, you know, if Robert Rauschenberg can do it, I can do it, but I'm going to do it in a different way, right? So I can also use cardboard and I'm going to use it my way. And in a sense, it becomes part of the conversation and it grounds it within the tradition again. So then if I show up at the Noya, at the Hamburger banoff here. And I see it and I go, okay, that makes sense to be here. This doesn't look foreign.
00:08:13.468 - 00:09:00.940, Speaker A: This looks like it belongs to the conversation. And probably 50% of the people going to hamburger Banoff are going to know the Rauschenberg reference, whether it's intentional or not, by element liquid. So. And they're going to see it within that lens and giving it more meaning. So the importance of being historical, here's some more brilliant experimentation playing with wood laser engraving on wood corners. So element Li drops a few real stunners here as far as just pushing the boundaries here. Again, it all looks obvious in retrospect, doesn't it? It's like, oh, of course, I should be doing that if I'm a pixel artist, right? But until someone does it, it's not so obvious.
00:09:00.940 - 00:09:27.976, Speaker A: And I don't know if I've ever seen anybody do this before. So super duper interesting from element ly. So watch that space. Thank you to Ed E d d, who doesn't have a Twitter hooked up, or they do, but it doesn't link, so I just put the name there on Twitter. Thank you for picking up Oceans apart, a new addition to the pixel art sketchbook. I love the colors in this. I was really enjoying it.
00:09:27.976 - 00:09:54.934, Speaker A: Just a screenshot of the drudge report with a beautiful ad there. So again, Ocean's apart, kind of, for me, was kind of punning a little bit on the ad and the news also. But of course, that's the name of the ad. Let's look at comments here. We have to go back one. So actually, this is from a couple of days ago that I missed. And let me just make this slightly smaller here.
00:09:54.934 - 00:10:24.614, Speaker A: There were a couple of comments just on Pixel Lords comment there, who's doing very well, unfortunately. It was actually on the front page of Magic Eden. Pixel Lords, were they bit nodes or nodes? They were called something. We'll come back to them, Pixel lord. But they were on the front page Pixelord series there of Magic Eden. So that was pretty awesome. It was like in the top eight collections I just saw this morning.
00:10:24.614 - 00:10:57.066, Speaker A: It disappeared, otherwise I would have showed it. San Diego is a cottle responding to pixelord of how bitcoin ordinals is giving 2021 ETH NFT vibes. Santiago is a codal. Art on bitcoin has existed for more than a decade, reducing its rich history and diversity under the ordinals term is a mistake. Ordinals have become ordinary. So a skeptic here, Santiago is a codal, and I think it's this Friday night, I'll actually be on Santiago as a codal show. And so that is interesting.
00:10:57.066 - 00:11:39.154, Speaker A: So skeptic here in 2021, vibes are also people thinking they've invented something new, while in reality, it's just ephemeral hype around something that has been built through for years now. I wouldn't mind to know, and maybe I'll ask Santiago on his show, I wouldn't mind knowing exactly what he's talking about. Like, is he talking about counterparty? Because that is, my impression is that's kind of a L2 on bitcoin, whereas ordinals are right on bitcoin. So I'm just kind of curious for more details on that. The hype is real. I mean, there's no question. The hype on ordinals and on bitcoin, I mean, you're starting to see it in the main crypto space.
00:11:39.154 - 00:12:13.978, Speaker A: You know, bitcoin L2s as a narrative. Bitcoin seems to be one of the main narratives that are developing here in the whole crypto space. And so again, it's one of those watch this space. It's kind of on the radar front and center here. False narratives are being pushed by speculators that know how the mass has behaved. It may be harmless if one just wants to experience the fashionable trends, but if one truly respects history, techniques, aesthetics, and the philosophy that have been developed, one cannot have the luxury to be so nearsighted. So just an interesting skeptical point of view.
00:12:13.978 - 00:12:36.324, Speaker A: And we welcome. I welcome all points of view here in the spirit, in a socratic spirit of getting to the reality. So thank you, Santiago izzikotl, for the heartfelt comments here. Let's continue. So last show, which kind of did spectacularly well on Twitter there. Big thank you again. I wasn't expecting that.
00:12:36.324 - 00:13:21.086, Speaker A: It felt like it kind of broke through to a certain degree. Kind of like this is, this show has been a thing for a little bit, let's say, in the Tezos ecosystem. Felt like it was starting to break through beyond this weekend, just based on the notifications I was getting and the response, which usually the Friday show is kind of a quieter show. So that was really great. So thank you, everybody, for supporting that, for retweeting it, and also unknown collector, I think putting out a tweet about an upcoming interview in February that we're going to do that I'm going to be on his space that he does there. So I think with click create, I believe, is the show. I'll fill you in with the details.
00:13:21.086 - 00:13:44.832, Speaker A: Let's continue here because we do have to run liquid mind art. Thank you so much Adrian, for highlighting my art amongst so many magnificent artists. Grateful forever. This looks like Luciana Guerra if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, awesome art. That yellow and kind of yellow background with the what look like black and white, kind of charcoal ish pencil drawings in the middle. Beautiful human boy.
00:13:44.832 - 00:14:00.214, Speaker A: Awesome episode. I saw a post from Ed Sayn Ratinho is the same person as pixel goals NFT and that they are friends for a long time. Well, I would have guessed it was Ed. So maybe it's another person. The mystery continues on that one. Thank you for the comment. Morte spiral.
00:14:00.214 - 00:14:12.206, Speaker A: Cool episode. Luciana. The best abstract painter in the scene. So let the battle begin. Let the battle begin. Great painter here. There's a lot of great, great, great abstract painters in this scene.
00:14:12.206 - 00:14:22.374, Speaker A: It's a very exciting scene. Increasingly so with every passing day. Just discovered via unknown collector. There we are. Well done. Thank you unknown collector. And thank you Wizpill.
00:14:22.374 - 00:14:31.422, Speaker A: Yeah, unknown collector sent a few, we got a few subs. Thanks to UC there. So that was awesome. Moda Mt. Thanks for the mention. Really honored. My pleasure.
00:14:31.422 - 00:14:55.234, Speaker A: That was very cool. Interesting, heartfelt painting. I could tell as many were in the past. Ah heck, you really ought to link up with Ken Consumer in Berlin to experiment with plotters. So thank you with for that. So not only do I need to go to the laser engraver, but I think I'll leave the laser engraver for a very long time. Here we'll let element Li bathe in the innovation.
00:14:55.234 - 00:15:14.442, Speaker A: Let's see what element Li does. This is great though because I do want to experiment with plotters a lot. So Ken Consumer, I'll look them up. Thank you for the comment. Tom Bombadil great to hear from you and retro Manny. First comment, you beat Ratta this episode, Manny. So anyways, great to hear from you.
00:15:14.442 - 00:15:37.074, Speaker A: And again, 17,000 big show 65 retweets. This one went far. So thank you once again to everybody here and David here. Kyle Flemmer epic episode. Thanks for gone Basin in the glitch column today. You're welcome chepertum. Thanks for the feedback on my take about ordinals because of course that was the whole bitcoin discussion.
00:15:37.074 - 00:15:58.068, Speaker A: Would be glad to discuss with you in in real life someday. Definitely. I love the work you put in these episodes. Keep making this journey singular and refreshing. Well, thank you for the wonderful comment and if you are ever in Berlin, do drop me a line. Maybe you already are. If you are, I'd happily go custom horror having to go and join your show right now for the first time.
00:15:58.068 - 00:16:11.064, Speaker A: Great energy. See a few new viewers here. So welcome to new viewers here. Thank you. Custom Horror Cider thank you for the feature. Once again, great to hear from you. Cider and beautiful work as ever been.
00:16:11.064 - 00:16:19.848, Speaker A: Battle. Thank you. And Strano, massive. Thanks. Uncertain gaze. Go check it out. And here's actually important information.
00:16:19.848 - 00:16:40.214, Speaker A: The piece itself is not the gift display though. This is a projection of the piece on a custom frame. So maybe this is the piece, if I'm understanding this correctly, from Strano. Interesting. And Martin Jo feeling the ordinals. Fomo, thanks for showing the GN bear. This series is not minted yet.
00:16:40.214 - 00:16:57.394, Speaker A: I was wondering but maybe soon. Yeah, I think you should definitely mint that, Martin. It's very cool. Thank you. Siberia Lily illo thanks for showing my work and my son's drawing from when he was four. He loved the Gruffalo so much. I would paint and he and his sister would draw next to me.
00:16:57.394 - 00:17:18.042, Speaker A: Simple, sweet times and simple sweet lines. Beautifully put. And yeah, I feel ya. Kel's great stuff. Tons of beautiful pieces. Love the thoughts on Shepperton's comment and agree, but had no idea about your but had no idea your show, as well as being full of value and positive energy, can be rather frightening. AI figures out how to decrypt it.
00:17:18.042 - 00:17:38.080, Speaker A: Yeah, normally AI figures. Yeah, I mean that is a who knows, right? Normally I sleep with a babe after listening to you. That's hilarious. Well, if you have a lot invested on bitcoin or in ordinals, it is high risk. I mean, let's face it. So thank you everybody. Michael Angelcox.
00:17:38.080 - 00:17:51.270, Speaker A: Thank you Ollie. Thank you for the nice comments. Dance Avatar, everybody. Thank you Sergey. And thank you Jake. Studios actually left a post just with the thank you there who we started with, so that was awesome too. Lone wicked.
00:17:51.270 - 00:18:26.606, Speaker A: Just a comment here on the scene. I'm incredibly grateful for the like minded and differently minded artists I've had the privilege to become friends with in this space. I feel a real sense of love in the GM's art and insight shared every day. This is something not to underestimate and I would say is, you know, fairly untypical of, you know, modern day art scenes. I mean, you can make great friends and everything, but just overall, as a scene for all of the, you know, sometimes the dark side of this sort of thing, I find it. I'm with Lone Wick. I find this scene remarkably positive actually.
00:18:26.606 - 00:18:46.650, Speaker A: You know, for all the reputation that X has as kind of a sewer of communication. I don't see it here at all, frankly. Like maybe here and there, but not really. It's overall, I totally agree with this comment here. It feels weird admitting that a piece of social media is actually worthwhile, but it is what it is. I agree with your observation. Lone wick Tuks.
00:18:46.650 - 00:19:22.242, Speaker A: I've minted my artwork on the blockchain. Of course, Tuks has been around. Tuks is an artist, like, frankly, many of us who's been making art before the blockchain, digital art before, you know, or at least being aware of the blockchain. And, you know, it's sort of like Haiti rocket there. I've mentioned my work on the blockchain, ensuring it lasts indefinitely. My hope is to preserve all links and metadata so my art lives on even after I'm gone. Like the blockchain was such is such a boon, a, you might say, or such a bounty for digital artists.
00:19:22.242 - 00:19:57.266, Speaker A: Like it was a real issue before the blockchain. And here tooks is saying, I can put all my work on there on the blockchain, manage it myself, basically put all the data I want, and it basically lives on after I'm gone. This is why it's such an exciting technology and why it's not going to fade. One thinks this is my main goal and why I'll continue minting without hesitation. And I kind of read between the lines here that says, like, you know, whether things sell or not, like, I'm minting. This is about, see, Tewks is playing the big game. He's playing for all the marbles.
00:19:57.266 - 00:20:32.442, Speaker A: He's, you know, as Burroughs would say, though, the whole this time we want the whole tamale. He's going for the whole tamale here. Okay, again, playing the big game. So, you know, this is more than about a sale here, a sale there. This is about putting the work and inscribing it and preserving it for as long as possible. I was going to say for all time, but for as long as we possibly can here. Omz, some would have you believe the consensus among a few thousand people, mostly crypto traders driven by influential social media accounts, will.
00:20:32.442 - 00:21:20.784, Speaker A: Social media accounts will determine the future value of art created in the space. It's up to you to decide whether you agree with them. So again, taking the big picture here, OMz, with another very interesting comment, which is time. It's a topic we've kind of come back to over and over, which many of you already know that time is the ultimate judge, not the market. So Omz saying what may be popular now may not be the thing that's popular in 50 years or in 20 years. So just an important and nicely worded comment there. Now, this was interesting, too, and this was just an interesting post from welcome JPEG.
00:21:20.784 - 00:21:53.058, Speaker A: It's a pretty huge account. And I thought this was just interesting within just in ideas of influence. And I just found it surprising. Normally I wouldn't even cover this, but we have another contemporary art thing coming up. And so in the next tab, I think so this is Damien Hurst in 2000. And then, so this account here, welcome JPEG, is comparing how Damien Hurst actually, let me go to the start of all the similarities. Thomas Downing Damien 1969 2004.
00:21:53.058 - 00:22:42.482, Speaker A: So just all of these, and some are more distant than others. I mean, I don't know how John Lekay, Eddie Saunders here, and they're all different artists. And here, I mean, in art there is going to be a certain amount of similarity. But when you look here, you know, again, hard to say. This one especially, and you've seen this artist in it earlier, it does make you wonder. And the reason I'm showing this is because I think it demonstrates that it's kind of back to that market thing that OMZ was mentioning. Just because Damien Hirst has done really well in the market doesn't necessarily mean that time will treat it the same way in 50 years, especially if this becomes, you know, more and more known or felt that there is an association.
00:22:42.482 - 00:23:40.372, Speaker A: And I think it's completely debatable because everything, there's so many artists now, you could argue it's all been done. So anybody doing anything might look like someone else, right? So, you know, having the charity of interpretation and giving people the benefit of the doubt, nevertheless, I mean, you look here, too, all interesting. And again, it goes back to our super early episode that we did here, looking at the social media accounts of like gagosian and pace, and that was a hilarious episode and looking at how the engagement wasn't matching up with, and all to say, it's a bit of a smoke and mirrors out there. So go with skepticism. Don't just, you know, accept everything you're told about, you know, who is supposed to be the most important thing, kind of echoing what OmZ is saying, you know, and Curio French has made that point. You know, you have to think for yourself. This is interesting.
00:23:40.372 - 00:24:29.254, Speaker A: Empress trash, AI Wei Wei follows Empress trash. Everything comes full circle and received ultimate validation in my journey today. And so this is interesting as well, because if you've been watching this show, you'll remember maybe six weeks ago, AI Weiwei, maybe it was at December 6 at the art Basel, Miami, Miami Beach. I think it was there where AI Wei Wei, it didn't get a ton of press, but he did some image. I think it was like, like a historical painting, but it was dithered. And then we saw also, I think actually, Ahek sent this to me. Then there was some pixelated stuff from like a magazine kind of zine thing that he had done or contributed to that showed these pixelated.
00:24:29.254 - 00:25:12.484, Speaker A: I have a sense or a suspicion that AI Weiwei is actually paying attention to the scene. And I think this is, I had already had that sort of thought. And empress trash being followed kind of echoes. It's more circumstantial evidence, we could say. And I'm not, in a weird way, I'm not at all surprised because I would argue, and it's just one opinion here, I would argue it is the main actually thing going on in the visual arts right now. Just from my perspective here. And for whatever biases or lack of judgment or judgment I may or may not have, it is the most important thing going on, the most significant.
00:25:12.484 - 00:26:04.624, Speaker A: It's the most, where all the innovation's happening. I mean, again, it's very impressive what we're seeing, what I'm seeing on Instagram, and I highlighted almost every show at the end, what we're seeing on Instagram with contemporary painters. But it's getting really hard to push the boundaries without adopting the technology. And so the technology is in the digital right now. And so I'm not surprised, like, this is just more circumstantial evidence. You know, it's sort of like, again, screen printing, when it became a thing, all of a sudden that became the thing to a certain degree, at least with Warhol and Rauschenberg and a few others. Right? So all to say, it shows that the technology is, it's inherent in the progress of art.
00:26:04.624 - 00:26:24.590, Speaker A: Like, it is a part of that journey is what I'm trying to say here on this wonderful Monday morning here. So Empress trash. So that is cool and interesting also from Empress trash. You know you're in deep when you're spending your Friday night inscribing your first ordinal yourself on gamma to celebrate. No censorship. No censorship. I got sexy with it.
00:26:24.590 - 00:26:53.342, Speaker A: Details next week of sale. And here is the work. So putting work on ordinals here from Emperor's trash. Sabato also, now this is an older Sabato, but Sabato tweeted this out on Friday. I thought this was a new one, but it turns out this is from way back in February, February 18. So a early ordinal here from Sabato. And I can't remember what the name.
00:26:53.342 - 00:27:15.818, Speaker A: It's like ordinal Gremlin. I should have brought up the tweet here, but just a spectacular work. Here it is, 60, 68,000 bytes. So about 68 kb here. Remember, Auxcenes was 100 kb. So I'm going to do some more experiments here. You see, this is on ordinal's wallet.
00:27:15.818 - 00:27:53.338, Speaker A: I minted on magic Eden. I wonder if it's cheaper and better here on ordinal's wallet. So I'm going to do some tests here pretty soon. Also, another great weekend here for Sabato with Vincent van do picking up a whole bunch of drawing exercises from Sabato for like 80, 80 tezos around that much and a whole bunch. So nice work for Sabato, bringing in 800 volume on the last 24 hours on the drawing exercises. So that is very cool. Patrick Amadon, multi chain ecosystem is a healthy ecosystem for artists.
00:27:53.338 - 00:28:46.244, Speaker A: An art career is volatile enough without doubling down on the volatility of a single currency. So something that really we've been saying here since the beginning of the show is multi chain, multimedia, multi platform. And indeed, and as made the point many times, there are different collectors, as people who are on Solana right now are discovering, different people are collecting your work. So there is an incentive to. And it's, again, it's almost back to that idea of being a decentralized artist, right? By not being on one chain, you're kind of creating resilience for your own work. So just another vote, you might say, in that direction from Patrick Amadon, Zora. Another interesting, I guess a L2 on ethereum things.
00:28:46.244 - 00:29:08.704, Speaker A: You can, you know, I was watching, you know, airdrops are all the thing right now. One of these accounts that are like trying to find the alpha, they think Zora could be a potential airdrop candidate. I thought that was interesting. I never thought of that because I don't think they have a token, as we mentioned before. So a little more alpha there, for what that's worth. I don't know. Things you can do in less than a minute on Zora.
00:29:08.704 - 00:29:27.734, Speaker A: Text your mom, retweet this or this. It used to be a week. So now, and I brought it up here. It used to be a week. I haven't tested this out, but now it looks like they've got it down to a minute on Zora. So they keep iterating and improving over there. So which just continues to impress.
00:29:27.734 - 00:29:56.658, Speaker A: So that is exciting and just cool. Donia, let's glitch it. So we've been looking at these cameras that Donia has been meeting at let's glitch it. And here is a kind of a info flyer of sorts here. Circuit bent photography, glitch, art on the go. And so this is what's going on here. What is circuit bending, which is a glitch technique, as we learned a few hundred episodes or more ago.
00:29:56.658 - 00:30:31.350, Speaker A: Circuit bending is the act of solder, soldering new connections in consumer electronics in ways unintended by the manufacturers typically producing glitchy effects. How cool is that? So literally opening up the camera, I guess, and soldering, you know, creating metallic connections between new areas of the camera. What's it good for? So special requ. Okay, so this goes into more details, but it basically creates that glitch. So dollar 125 each, plus shipping. Pretty good deal or crypto equivalent. Pretty cool here.
00:30:31.350 - 00:30:59.374, Speaker A: And here is an example of the glitch camera here. I like the style of cameras they are, too. It's almost like these kids cameras. We'll see if it plays is with any sort of photography. Circuit bent photography is aided by an understanding of light. Let me just quickly go to the phone for Internet here. At this point in the show, I have created backup plans.
00:30:59.374 - 00:31:22.434, Speaker A: It could be just the computer itself is starting to. I almost need a new computer. It's starting to slow down, as you can see here. Let's see if we can get this working. There we go. All right, so, as you see, going through the snow. So just very cool.
00:31:22.434 - 00:32:04.670, Speaker A: Here is another example. A few frame photos, different photo modes that you can. So all very impressive, isn't it? All very, very impressive. I wonder if the camera, I assume the camera function works where you can actually take the picture. So, even cooler, kit velo, a separate situation here, dissolving realities with professor oblivion tonight. So seemingly, this is also a very interesting technique. Again, kind of a traveling through the mediums type situation here, where it looks like the camera is taking a picture of the projector screen, right, or whatever is projected on the wall.
00:32:04.670 - 00:32:36.618, Speaker A: Then you take a picture and then you get another result. So very interesting from Kit Velo here, experimentation also on the visual front here. So the ultra, the pro Max ultra, the Apple vision pro coming out. And here we get a notification here from Oxene for this. Massively expensive. It's not, as someone pointed out, it's like the amount for a laptop. So, you know, a nice laptop, you know, $3,500.
00:32:36.618 - 00:33:05.834, Speaker A: A very nice apple Mac laptop. Nevertheless, it isn't insane. But, no, I won't be buying one anytime soon. But just something to note here as we discuss technology and where things might be going. Also, just an interesting. So Strano pen plotting meche for my amigo Sabato. So Strano doing what looks like pen plotting, doesn't it? And there is a work for Sabato, so.
00:33:05.834 - 00:33:28.632, Speaker A: And it's going to be sent to Sabato, gain a physical peace, and my heart is full. So just very interesting to see that at work. And a big congratulations and happy birthday. Happy tezos birthday to the Kurt Hussle collective. Two years on the hustle, J and K and Terry. Today we're celebrating not one, not three, but two. Two years of Kurt hustle.
00:33:28.632 - 00:33:59.344, Speaker A: Take this cake to celebrate and take the night off watching two years of work over at Curthustle TV. Huge thanks to all our collectors. Big love and all that from Jank and Terry at KHC. If you're wondering what the cake is saying, he's saying, oh, yeah, so just a super cool duo there. And, you know, for those that don't know Kurt hustle collective, like, these are some of my. And pray that they play. These are some of my favorite, you know, NFTs period.
00:33:59.344 - 00:34:26.304, Speaker A: This came out about two years. Music's really good. Typically. Typically good music. 19 1997, 919 1997. So just actually, we have more. I have another one.
00:34:26.304 - 00:35:00.806, Speaker A: So just wanted to wish the Kurt Hussle collective. Here's another classic. I think this is from two years ago, too. You know, just really, really cool work. Okay, let's. And finally, one more here to where. Just hilarious if you've never seen it.
00:35:00.806 - 00:35:33.130, Speaker A: That's why I show it, because many people haven't seen this work. So just brilliant. Not so cheap anymore on the market, but brilliant work. Actually, here's another video. So again, just some of my all time favorite artists there on the blockchain I discovered from Haiti. Rockette's collection, if memory serves. So here is also with a new work here.
00:35:33.130 - 00:35:58.044, Speaker A: This is January 20. I thought a brilliant, brilliant work. I mean, could have started the show with this one, easily. Palm trees. Like, I'm not like a huge video art guy, you know, like I never was. But you show me Kurt Hussle collective, you show me zuoso, and I go, oh, I really like video art. Like, this is awesome.
00:35:58.044 - 00:36:16.364, Speaker A: So, yeah, so very cool. Three tezos, and only four have sold that will sell out, though. Edition of 20 on object there. Carnival I think is what that's called. Kanavrel. Not sure what that means. Continuing on Rinnefish with a new work here.
00:36:16.364 - 00:36:47.676, Speaker A: So that's a kind of video esque work here. So very cool work here from the great Rinne fish. Interesting music. So this is an edition of 15 and just not listed yet. So cool work here from Rinnefish. Just minted today, I believe. And here is ratcloak.
00:36:47.676 - 00:37:15.824, Speaker A: And this sold for one ETH, so 0.105 ethan ETH black tyser rider, handmade with, with Photoshop brushes. So another very cool painting here. I'm not sure if we looked at this one, but it's pretty cool with the NASA there and everything. The surveillance camera. Like, I don't remember looking at this. Even over here, the picture in the picture here and this guy on the horse, kind of classic rat cloak composition.
00:37:15.824 - 00:37:32.660, Speaker A: These great drips and this beautiful landscape here. And even the color scheme kind of reminds me of that St. Christopher work I picked up way back when. Yeah. So just really beautiful work here. Nice sale. Beautifully painted here by Ratcloak.
00:37:32.660 - 00:37:51.044, Speaker A: Black Taisa river. So congrats on the sale that went to temper. And here, a couple more from the myth in this fabulous boxing series here, Mike Tyson. And I believe this is sold out. I'm not positive, though. And there's a che Guevara there. And here you can look up close.
00:37:51.044 - 00:38:09.768, Speaker A: And a muscular Mike Tyson here. And there, the big gloves. So just a very cool series here. And these are sold out. And then one on secondary from Roerich. Here's two pack. Also, this looks sold out as well.
00:38:09.768 - 00:38:32.424, Speaker A: One on secondary from Roerich and here. So the boxer series continues to do very well here. And some cool tattoos here. And almost reminiscent of that other artist from way back who would do the tattoos like this. I can't remember the name. It's escaping me right now. It'll come back, though, in a future episode.
00:38:32.424 - 00:38:52.476, Speaker A: Continuing on, this was also pretty cool. Luca Boni, I thought, just a nice. I assume this is a digital painting. Did pretty spectacularly, too. Look at that. 136,130, 6000 views there, 430 retweets. So this one really hit a nerve.
00:38:52.476 - 00:39:11.412, Speaker A: Pretty cool work as well. An interesting color scheme. I mean, it looks like kind of basic color scheme, kind of a CMYK Rgb color scheme, someone playing a guitar. Interesting composition. Beautifully done there, too, in the wire. Nice skyrider. This is katarina create here.
00:39:11.412 - 00:39:38.104, Speaker A: And another addition to this rider series. And kind of hard to say what kind of animal this is with the here. I'm not sure. This is a horse. And I don't see a big tail. And it seems to have two heads, so maybe a mythological creature and almost looking like it's walking through the clouds here. And these great kind of, again, visionary sunflowers here.
00:39:38.104 - 00:39:51.596, Speaker A: Beautiful. And a cloud ups. Oh, that is the hair that is up there. So nice piece here. Skywriter. This is 30 tazos and actually sold for 20 to doctor collector. And I don't think we looked at that one.
00:39:51.596 - 00:40:19.328, Speaker A: There's a lot coming out on that series. Flora Marquez, who I do follow on my other account there, so has a new series that's coming out, illustrator and comic artist from Argentina. So of course this is Flora Marquez. And these works are all coming out, I think, on Saul or. Here we go. It starts on January 27, maybe one a day. You see the series here starts on the 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th.
00:40:19.328 - 00:40:43.192, Speaker A: So one auction a day starting only at 0.07 sol. So really cool, beautiful series here on Solana from Flora Marquez. Continuing on. This was a work that Artie hands posted. Big shout out to Artie hands that I hadn't seen and I thought, pretty cool work here with these kind of retro lap laptops here. Who is the artist? Tacc superwear.
00:40:43.192 - 00:41:07.422, Speaker A: So nice find here. And cool art. Tacc. Interesting piece. Continuing on, Ilio Gible, who's also on super rare. And we've been looking at Ilio Gible's kind of surreal illustrations here. This was another super interesting one, which looks like brush marks, but with shadows underneath in this landscape.
00:41:07.422 - 00:41:39.400, Speaker A: Just an interesting original piece. 58,000 views. So again, you know, Instagram, you know, both Instagram and X are both great options as an artist. Like, you know, Instagram, there is a time on Instagram when it felt like they were. Weren't really giving, they weren't sharing the money, so to speak, or the glory. Like they really restricted and strangled people's feeds. These days on Instagram, you can grow, it seems to me, like they've taken a.
00:41:39.400 - 00:42:01.624, Speaker A: They've taken a note out of the playbook of TikTok, is my impression. So still worthwhile, Instagram. But x showing it's worthwhile. So just interesting. Probably worthwhile if you don't to have a foot in each one. As far as your social media, as an artist. Jake Studios, who we started last show with here, face id not recognized.
00:42:01.624 - 00:42:39.108, Speaker A: Trigon in five years or die now to reset. So another just super interesting, ambiguous work here from Jake Studios with the cloud, these digital pixelated clouds here in the front on this retro tv. And again, here is the face of this kind of person with a mane. And maybe this is the free person. Their head is trapped in the computer while the free person is outside here. Interestingly, no outlines here. So keeping it interesting here, digitally drawn animation from Jake Studios is at auction right now for 14 tezos so that you can still put a bid on.
00:42:39.108 - 00:42:55.544, Speaker A: This is RJ on exchange. So putting out a couple of works here on exchange, computer drawings. This sold for half a sol to Kobe. SEO. SEO. And interesting piece here. This kind of reminds me of a.
00:42:55.544 - 00:43:27.066, Speaker A: I can't remember the name of the artist, but there is an artist who I think on one square, like it's like a diptych. And on one square there's a painting of, let's say something like an object of some kind, let's say a table. And then on the other side will be a dictionary definition that is basically maybe screen printed or printed out and juxtaposed. So pointing out this. This different way we consume information. Right. So this is how we understand a computer via text.
00:43:27.066 - 00:43:46.616, Speaker A: This is how we understand a computer visually. And here is the actual computer. So you might see this to a certain degree as an echo of Magritte's. This is sicine pasin pip, right. Or as Magritte called it, Le traizon des images. The treachery of images. Right.
00:43:46.616 - 00:44:18.720, Speaker A: So an enigmatic, powerful title. And again, for people that haven't watched or who are new with Magritte, an important thing to understand is that the title is a part of the work with Magritte. And so, all to say, interesting concept work here. And nicely executed as well by RJ here. And here is another very interesting piece here. Courbourcier chair and computer. So more references here with this very nice kind of pixelated drawing here.
00:44:18.720 - 00:44:47.858, Speaker A: Kind of painterly. I'm suspecting this was made with a mouse. This feels like a mouse as I can even see it. Just as I'm kind of putting my mouse over top here. Now it looks like a computer in a chair, which is another RJ trope, we might say, with a carpet here. But remember that tweet? Or. And if you didn't see it, RJ put out a tweet, you know, a couple of weeks ago, saying, I'm going to try, you know, I've learned a lot this year and I'm going to try something a little different here this year.
00:44:47.858 - 00:45:08.670, Speaker A: So this looks like what we're seeing here. Very beautiful work that also sold for half a soul, I think that went to Yuri J. Yeah. So nice sale there. It's great to sell work, you know, so just nice selling the work. Beautiful work here by Dan Control. This is brilliant.
00:45:08.670 - 00:45:44.664, Speaker A: Good morning. This is brilliant. I assume this is at expanded art here in Berlin. This is brilliant. I mean, you know what this makes me think of is JG Ballard talking about kind of looking at ATM machines anthropologically. Right? Like kind of, again, taking this kind of logic, trying to understand the unconscious narrative behind an ATM machine, for example. And so when Dan, you know, portrays it visually using Dan control's style, it kind of starts making you think about what this all means.
00:45:44.664 - 00:46:08.280, Speaker A: Right? And so really interesting choice of subject matter. Super interesting choice. And even a nice crop here doing the 16 by nine that he was mentioning in a previous episode. And beautifully executed. So nice work from Dan Control. There's another one here, washer and dryer. And here you see again the 16 x nine.
00:46:08.280 - 00:46:39.146, Speaker A: Again, kind of a consumer, there's a bit of a pop feel to both these works, right? I mean, this is everyday objects that we all deal with. Here's another one, a washer and dryer on top of each other. I mean, I was at an Airbnb the other day, or a couple of months ago, I should say, where this was the exact situation, washer and dryer. And again, this is on expanded art where he has a show right now. Continuing on. This is Rannixteer GM. So this is from that new series I believe that Rannixteer has put out.
00:46:39.146 - 00:47:06.544, Speaker A: So a new mint here. So a cool, very minimalist gradient work there by Rannixdeer. Continuing that great series and also the great collaboration with MCHX recently as well. So doing a few series there on ETH. Gozo, morning. So this looks like a work in progress, I assume, but not positive. But you see all these great textures here that gozo works with.
00:47:06.544 - 00:48:03.668, Speaker A: I don't know if this has been minted, but you just see, again, like, it's quite interesting when you compare what we see with element Li working digitally and then kind of getting, and then putting in physically here with AI, sometimes, like, we see it with strange thing where we're getting physical qualities, you know, textures, but from the other side, from the digital side, so, you know, again, just quite interesting to see because it's beautiful, right? I mean, because you start getting, you know, what I call the randomness of the physical here, right? Again, like in digital world, you can almost be kind of platonic about it, where these are like perfect shapes. It's a perfect square, a perfect circle here in the real world like this looks a little bit more real worldish, a little bit more physical. So. Morning from Gozo. This is interesting, too. Yuri J. Wending machine.
00:48:03.668 - 00:48:26.052, Speaker A: So it kind of looks like maybe Yuri J is going to take over the tes vending machine, if I had to guess, but not positive on that. Anyway, pretty cool orc here, as usual. Nice composition and just. It's getting pretty awesome. All of these textures and everything from Uri J. It continues to develop there. Plastics from Jimmy.
00:48:26.052 - 00:48:56.304, Speaker A: I thought this was an interesting series, generative artworks. And as you can see here, kind of an interesting. I mean, there's a. I should have brought it up, but running short on time. There's a basque, there's basquiat drawings where you kind of get like a whole. It's like almost what I call the sketchbook style, where you put a whole bunch of things kind of juxtaposed maybe around the same size, like you're seeing here, and it just becomes a kind of exercise. Sketchbook exercise of sorts, or just an exercise in juxtaposition.
00:48:56.304 - 00:49:54.592, Speaker A: So here you just see how these different elements or pieces of reality taken out of their context and then juxtaposed again. And then you start to create relationships and just come to a different understanding of what they might mean. It's kind of back to this whole idea, as we were discussing with the ATM in Dan controls. This idea that there's a manifest content, as Ballard would put it, and a latent content to our visual experience and the way we understand things. You know, it's classic freudian, you know, is a cigar just a cigar? And in freudian thinking, generally speaking, a does not equal b. They have a different significance. That's why Dali, Salvador Dali, you'll see, as he says in the unspeakable confessions, which I highly recommend, one of his several books.
00:49:54.592 - 00:50:17.152, Speaker A: If you want to understand my work, it's hidden in there, you know, 200 pages in. If you want to understand my work, decode, decode, decode, decode. Capital letters. So there you go. So all to say, this is. There's a surrealist element to this series that I quite like from Jimmy. And here's another work campfire.
00:50:17.152 - 00:50:42.648, Speaker A: I'm wondering if this is an avalanche ecosystem platform. So not exactly sure. Single edition by Edgar, and not even sure what the price is here. 200 at floor. But I thought a pretty cool work and kind of a similar color scheme to those last works would kind of hang well in the same show. Just an interesting painting here by this artist. If I can.
00:50:42.648 - 00:50:57.724, Speaker A: I'm not sure I can. There we go by and I think the artist is veneno. No, that's the name of the. So here it is. Edgar Fabia free us. Edgar Fabian Frias. So interesting.
00:50:57.724 - 00:51:26.214, Speaker A: So avax you see. So an avalanche platform campfire exchange. Interesting here is don't buy and this is called Ram. And maybe playing off of the computer ram as well as ramming something into someone else or something into each other. I thought a nice piece. Nice work here. And you see the Windows XP almost looks like Windows XP in the background of this jousting scene.
00:51:26.214 - 00:51:41.962, Speaker A: Pretty nice. Interesting piece. There is a little bit of AI and digital painting. So a combination endgif of course. Continuing on grimoire with a work here. This is an edition of three. And this is 25 tazos and.
00:51:41.962 - 00:52:02.310, Speaker A: Sorry, this is three editions here. Nine are available. So not exactly sure how that works. Vincent van do picking up a work there. So going on a big shopping spree this weekend here. So not exactly sure how many are in the collection. Interesting piece here from Grimoire, though.
00:52:02.310 - 00:52:24.234, Speaker A: Again, kind of having that kind of AI looking technology, facial recognition technology or, you know, surveillance technology taking. And then having a nice, kind of surreal figure here with a flower for a head. Himawari. Interesting title. This is demon ego. And let's see if we have any info here. Just a good night.
00:52:24.234 - 00:52:46.094, Speaker A: That looks like the Power Rangers, doesn't it? So nice move there. And interesting. Maybe some Star wars figures but not sure about that at all. Could be real life people. Kind of looks like Star wars there though. Hard to say. Interesting juxtaposition unified through color, though, as well as through technique of this torn paper.
00:52:46.094 - 00:53:10.112, Speaker A: Just more beautiful work from demon ego. And this is ad. Ad. And interestingly so this is on super rare, a list price of 0.26 ETH. And if I can maximize it. Let's see if I click on it interestingly, you can see there's almost a bit of kind of like video noise, so to speak.
00:53:10.112 - 00:53:31.704, Speaker A: Kind of video snow, so to speak on this painting. Kind of adding an extra depth to what looks like a physical, or at least partly physical, you know, this looks like physical pencil. But then here, not so sure. So maybe a combination of physical and digital and even video. So interesting work. Enlightenment from ad. Ad.
00:53:31.704 - 00:53:51.564, Speaker A: And this is Turkarak, who does all sorts of interesting scenes of everyday life. And here is the estate. A real estate agent, I think. Or the estate agent. Maybe someone who's in charge after someone passes away. Not sure on that. Just very interesting artist.
00:53:51.564 - 00:54:31.628, Speaker A: And as usual, even nice portrayal of the corner of the walls of the room, there's interesting piece from Turkrack, edition of one for five tezos. Good deal there. Goro with a work. And this is just a GM, of course, playing off of that very famous work of who is it? It is. It is escaping me, not Titan. It is one of the early greek gods, Saturn devouring one of his sons, which, of course, was portrayed famously by that great spanish artist whose name is also escaping me on this Saturday morning. But you all know the painting.
00:54:31.628 - 00:54:49.064, Speaker A: Nice interpretation. Here we go again. Seba Sestero. A voice stuck in my head. So this is interesting. So kind of a more, slightly more collage feel to the seba sestero, who we know. I think, if I remember right from these great illustrations here.
00:54:49.064 - 00:55:04.574, Speaker A: Great illustrations. So here, kind of bit more of a digital collage feel to it. Interestingly, a voice stuck in the head. So beautiful work. Great colors, too. This is NUV 1914. How are we doing for time? We're doing good.
00:55:04.574 - 00:55:26.208, Speaker A: We're doing well. Mariposas. And they look like butterflies, don't they? Kind of a, again, an edgy portrayal here by NUV 1914 of the wings made of many of these gradients here. And then here is the bug, the. The body of the butterfly here. Beautifully done. And then these outrageous gradients.
00:55:26.208 - 00:55:43.264, Speaker A: And most outrageous of all, this white line right here on the edge, keeping it interesting. Super interesting. That is a one of one, by the way. And that is nine tazos. So very cool there. Let's continue on a mumble boy with more digital collage. This just came out.
00:55:43.264 - 00:56:04.396, Speaker A: This is twelve tazos edition of one. And here we can see a figure. And it's just a collage, basically, as you see here. Interesting cutouts here. Different ways of cutting out the shapes here. Maybe a little bit of digital paint perhaps. Looks like.
00:56:04.396 - 00:56:32.622, Speaker A: Maybe some physical or actually looks like jpegged out collage. That almost looks like an audio program back there. You see some edges are sharper than others, right? And it looks like there's also some increasing of the size. How big is this? Might be too much. We'll look another time at how big these are, but I think they're significant, like 4000 pixels about. Let's continue another one. Octo spider.
00:56:32.622 - 00:57:05.058, Speaker A: So these interesting kind of collage figures, edition of three for Fortezos. Let's see if it opens here. And again, kind of looking like using web imagery to make collage interestingly and with maybe a little bit of paint here and there. This one looks like mostly collage, though, doesn't it? So beautiful work from mumble boy with an interesting gradient in the background there. Continuing on, one don't know. Tap me if you can. So this was done for punk 6529, meme card.
00:57:05.058 - 00:57:30.928, Speaker A: So we don't see a ton of work, or at least I don't see a ton of work from one don't knows. I see it kind of maybe once a month we see a work here. And so doing one for the meme card series there. And just another awesome collage artist here. And you see the. We're all going to make it and all of these things GM, the Ethereum logo. And then, yeah, this looks like there is punk 6529.
00:57:30.928 - 00:58:00.194, Speaker A: So all sorts of awesome details in here, as usual, the tattoos and everything. Just an awesome artist here. And look at the big picture here with the cosmic top. A really talented artist here. I can't remember what country out of, I want to say, like, Indonesia, but not positive on that. Maybe we have information here before we continue to run through this episode. Surrealist collage.
00:58:00.194 - 00:58:14.874, Speaker A: So, yeah, doing really well. Went to sotheby's. I'm sure a lot of you are familiar with one don't knows. Let's continue here. Santiago ruao. A cool work here. I'm not sure if it's new, but what I kind of love about this, Santiago Rao does a lot of abstract.
00:58:14.874 - 00:58:51.324, Speaker A: This one almost looks like, kind of like an ancient head that you'd see on, like, almost like Easter island, but not quite, but made out of these components, these kind of abstract, you know, components that we're kind of used to from the abstracts, like these little circles with gradients in them. So I thought a pretty interesting piece. Really cool looking, archaic looking. This was a beautiful work that was tempting to start with. Three of pentacles. This is a beautiful work by manital, part of the cat tarot. Just gorgeous colors here.
00:58:51.324 - 00:59:24.974, Speaker A: And there are two cats looking off into this, uh, constellation here. Uh, beautifully, beautifully done here. Again, uh, just a, I think a great contribution to the whole, uh, tarot tradition of depicting these cards. Uh, still available for 650. So edition of ten. So nice one there. Stippin pixel just posting this bull market, and there is the bull and someone jumping over it and then beaming off here, almost like Star Trek.
00:59:24.974 - 01:00:10.242, Speaker A: So interesting work, of course, stippin pixel putting out work on Zora a lot in the last few months. That work, you know, there's something to be said for finding your people. And stippin pixel has kind of found, I think, a pretty, you know, going where stipin pixel is rewarded the most is my impression, which is putting these free mints on Zora. This is dither fully on chain, by the way, thinking sometimes the only thing holding you back is you and three colors. And I brought it up, so I want to show this tweet, because to show it's on chain and already sold for 0.1 to an anonymous wallet here. So interesting piece here from dither, who I believe does all those tvs.
01:00:10.242 - 01:00:38.992, Speaker A: Right? And great colors here too, again, fully on chain. And again, there's a pretty rich market for fully on chain work there too. Here's pinky blue on exchange art. And here, putting out a pixel artwork here again, typically pink and blue. And what's beautiful about this is it's like a night sky where you see the stars going across. Beautifully done, and the stars are beautifully portrayed. Everything about it is actually quite beautiful.
01:00:38.992 - 01:00:55.032, Speaker A: So that is five sol and. But after being purchased by Rokun, so that's on secondary. Actually, this is two years old. I saw it tweeted. Anyway, beautiful work. Two years old, deepa kikilo. And I thought this was an interesting work too.
01:00:55.032 - 01:01:15.612, Speaker A: I'm not sure if I follow kikilo, but this. What did it sell for? Ten tezos. I thought a cool experimental pixel art, drawing edgy colors. Quite like the colors a lot here. And here you see what looks like two eyes on a head. And let's just actually look at this. Pfps by Kikilo.
01:01:15.612 - 01:01:31.518, Speaker A: So here is the artist. So a new discovery here for me. Just put the follow on here. Oh, and this work here too. Actually, these works were going around a little bit. These were quite interesting. Quite interesting.
01:01:31.518 - 01:01:47.166, Speaker A: I almost had put this on. Yeah, very interesting pixelation here. Interesting artwork. Gekka rapa. And would this sell for only ten tezos? Nice deal. Continuing on Burr sector on zora. So very.
01:01:47.166 - 01:02:19.646, Speaker A: This is what so playing off the meme where everything is fine and the room is on fire. And burstector. Kind of classic, I think, putting out quite a bit of work on Zora as well. So a lot of things happening all across many chains here. Sui soichi. Interesting experimental pixel artwork here with what looks like electricity or lightning, just kind of crossing this thing, this circle here, looking like a science experiment. Punk's distorted the art dealer.
01:02:19.646 - 01:02:56.398, Speaker A: This was pretty cool too. And of course, you see x copies, right click and save as guy. And then here, this kind of hooded crypto art figure, really in the skull and the hood, but done in kind of a ascii like style, but not entirely. And nice kind of jagged edges here. And really nicely done, actually, with the artwork itself having all the movement contrasting with the stillness outside, creating a powerful effect. Here's Braun back with embroidery number zero, seven. So here you see a little bit of flashing here.
01:02:56.398 - 01:03:24.394, Speaker A: And again, almost like curved pixels here. Interestingly so. And look at what these pixels are made of. Almost looking like they're made of something of other, just interesting kind of patterning, really, is what's going on. So just another interesting abstract here from Braun as part of that series. And here's cello, what I thought was a pretty interesting abstract here, too. Some music.
01:03:24.394 - 01:03:50.154, Speaker A: So interesting work there. That goes for 40 seconds here. So that is cello, Millet Salin, I assume pixels and lines. Nice title. And here, Lucas Lejeune with another super interesting work. Love the title of this one. Newsfeed.
01:03:50.154 - 01:04:06.010, Speaker A: So the scroll. Love the movement going, you know, the scroll that we're all too familiar with. The modularity abstracted into a few lines here on black and white. Brilliant work here. 299 edition of 40. Howdy doody. Howdy do.
01:04:06.010 - 01:04:22.390, Speaker A: Picking one up. Eli trader, prosperous gallery. So selling actually, flux research. So 24 owners already. How many are left selling? Well, here, eleven left, edition of 40. Pretty good. And here's another work just listed on X.
01:04:22.390 - 01:04:50.372, Speaker A: So putting out all sorts of dazzling animated abstracts here from Lucas Lejeune. Kind of semi abstract. Here is another one from Clint Fulkerson. We've been looking at some of these works, and this was posted on X. So another interesting kind. Abstract is what I'd call that. And this was great by Elna Frederick Chandek and playing off the Spider man meme and making us dizzy here.
01:04:50.372 - 01:05:27.434, Speaker A: But I thought a nice. This is hilarious, too, the chan up here, leaving this kind of words in here. Just interesting work. Renky putting out a super interesting piece here with this kind of, you almost see, like this jpegged out red, contrasting with the sphere in the middle. It's very interesting when you see people working with those JPEG distortions, what I call JPEG distortions, sometimes called artifacts, you know, and making that work for you. I'll never forget seeing a Jeff Koons painted here at a place called contemporary fine art in Berlin. Before they moved, they had a massive Jeff Koons painting.
01:05:27.434 - 01:06:02.226, Speaker A: And what was so interesting about that painting, it was an oil painting, probably made by his team. But what was interesting is they had, there's this flower kind of in the focal point at the top and two thirds the way up. And that flower was kind of jpegged out. And then they painted with oil. That JPEG ization or those JPEG artifacts again, traveling through the mediums, commenting on our, you know, digital world or, you know, our digital visual experience. Right. So, yeah, so this is interesting when you see that sort of stuff.
01:06:02.226 - 01:06:20.370, Speaker A: And nicely done. I mean, just visually effective on a very basic level. Klaus, with another beautiful work here, composition number 86. As we start to run through the rest of this episode. Just gorgeous color. Another beautiful analog kind of video glitchery here. Composition 86.
01:06:20.370 - 01:06:35.964, Speaker A: And already sold for 24 tazos. So continuing to make the sales. This is ex mortal, I believe. Let me see. Listing by xmortal. This is five Sol on exchange. Interesting piece here.
01:06:35.964 - 01:06:54.049, Speaker A: So more video art on Solana here. And a lot of collectors there. And just a nice kind of big pixels here. A lot. Aesthetically pretty awesome there on that piece by xmortal. And here is Kiro 0.25 ethan.
01:06:54.049 - 01:07:18.102, Speaker A: And this is. Looks like another maybe working off of anime or manga and then giving it the analog video glitch treatment. Just a nice minimal glitch there. And that is a quarter of an ETH, part of the glitched vision series. And this was a collaboration with score and Curo. Let's see if we can make this move. There we go.
01:07:18.102 - 01:07:41.138, Speaker A: So interesting combination here. He might be going slower because of my computer, so apologies for that. Yeah, that's my computer, but you kind of get a feel for it. There you go. There we go. So interesting collab here. Always great color too, by again, score in Kiro digital calligraphy.
01:07:41.138 - 01:07:58.678, Speaker A: Cool title. Minted one day ago. Continuing on, this is Mika Oladef on x. And here we see again some big chunky pixels contrasting with some smaller ones. Some moving, some not. Just more cool glitchery. Interesting colors there too.
01:07:58.678 - 01:08:20.658, Speaker A: Here's inavare. And this kind of looks like David Bowie to a certain degree, but I'm not positive on that. Really rich textures in here, though, if you can see that. Unfortunately, I can't make the Gif bigger. Just beautiful, beautiful textures here from inivare. Maybe you can see that. So just very interesting.
01:08:20.658 - 01:08:49.083, Speaker A: And of course we like to keep it a family show here, but couldn't pass up these really interesting kind of pfps of sorts. These punks here from Martin Joe that I thought were quite well done. So these are GLB's here, $0.50. So pretty hilarious there with the mohawk. Here is another one with a tazos sign. So keeping it edgy here from Martin Joe. Pretty well done, actually.
01:08:49.083 - 01:09:17.375, Speaker A: So interesting work there with a big tezos sign at the top. And this, I believe is Santiago, formerly known as Napster. I believe this was an AI artwork, but I'm not positive. But look at how great that looks. This really looks like a beautiful painting, actually. So just interesting work here. And this is tewks here with one on XGM.
01:09:17.375 - 01:09:43.378, Speaker A: So never seen this. I don't think we've seen this one before. Kind of looks like the ultimate or a fabulous Airbnb here on looking over on a beautiful sky on the sea here. And this beautiful kind of mediterranean scene. So as we go into the AI art, Mister Shapeless, who haven't seen forever, maybe has been putting stuff out the whole time and just has been missing my feed here. But just an awesome AI artist. Look at this.
01:09:43.378 - 01:09:55.482, Speaker A: So beautiful landscape here. Kind of surreal at the back there. Nice snowy scene. And Lily illo with more chairs. Kind of going more three dimensional on these ones. Let's see if we have any information. Monument.
01:09:55.482 - 01:10:21.416, Speaker A: Cool title. And interesting kind of square texture at the back here. So beautiful work from Lily. Illogical sky Goodman collaborating with, I thought, was this a collaboration? Maybe not. This is Sky Goodman with what looks like an AI computer, but super processed, as Sky Goodman likes to do. Sky's going to be on a Twitter space in March. Excited to say so.
01:10:21.416 - 01:10:39.002, Speaker A: Yeah, we'll ask sky about these works here. Kind of looks like an AI computer, though. So again, likes to export through several softwares here. Here's another one. So interesting. See if we have a clue here labeling this as simulacra, Ms Dos glitch, expressionism. So there is a clue here.
01:10:39.002 - 01:11:00.988, Speaker A: Look at these great backgrounds here, too. This mark making, this very rich mark making. Continuing on Ilay. So piece of cake, melt, confetti, cherry on top. Just a very cool, beautifully textured work here from Ilay. So a new AI work, which we haven't seen for a while, of a cake. And this is three tezos.
01:11:00.988 - 01:11:26.814, Speaker A: And this is list. There are nine left. And how are we doing? We're gonna have to speed up here. Little cakes, gathering of the chicken prophets before Jesus attempted a coup. Kind of feels like AI title there. And here is a surreal dinner, tea party of sorts here, with almost these max Ernst looking birds here, hanging out with a wizard and whatnot. So interesting AI artwork from little cakes.
01:11:26.814 - 01:11:58.820, Speaker A: Having some cake. This is 23 tezos on what? On edition of five. And so now that was minted September 10. So this is an older one, interestingly, I don't think we've seen that one before. And here's no hygiene. This is a newer one made with mid journey, the super edgy AI art. And it would be hard to kind of pull this off, but because no hygiene is so consistently edgy, it kind of creates a credibility, you know, to pull off an image like this.
01:11:58.820 - 01:12:22.572, Speaker A: So no arm, as you see here, made with mid journey. This is an edition of one for 19 tazos and selling a ton here. And here is no hygiene's page. So again, pretty edgy AI art, but making a lot of sales here. So as you see here, a lot of it selling. So just very cool to see. And putting out tons of work from no hygiene.
01:12:22.572 - 01:12:54.946, Speaker A: This was super interesting walk posted this recently collected via Zora Pringles, caviar and champagne by Noah Verrier. And I actually brought up Noah's account here. Nice painting. I think it's a physical, nice, modern still life, isn't it? Beautiful? So here's Noah Verrier, who I do follow my oil painting of a grilled cheese. I love the modern depiction with a traditional medium. Kind of makes its own contrast here. So beautiful work there.
01:12:54.946 - 01:13:29.574, Speaker A: Yoao Salazar with a new, very textured work here. Selfie series still in progress. And I think Yoao makes the texture first, if I'm not mistaken, but I can't remember, I think uses a lot of paste and I think acrylic paint, if I'm not mistaken. So a lot of medium in there. Bobby cheek matia, Lord of the Rings. I thought this was pretty interesting. We've seen a lot of works from this artist who kind of does these, you know, transformer, gobot type, almost like action robot, action figure style compositions.
01:13:29.574 - 01:13:46.942, Speaker A: This one's called Lord of the Rings. Acrylic and marker on canvas. So a nice combination. This was interesting. Michael Pybus. So I eat healthily, but I love fast food. I have the McDonald's app, so pretty hilarious here.
01:13:46.942 - 01:14:10.370, Speaker A: Interesting work. You know, playing off of McDonald's and sonic the Hedgehog. And here, like, I assume these are works made by Michael Pybus, but not positive on that. So just some more, some McDonald's painting from outside the crypto scene. It's kind of a different take on McDonald's. It's not gallery. So Nalani and I think the account is heart rot.
01:14:10.370 - 01:14:26.084, Speaker A: So interesting. More spray paint and airbrush work. It's a bit of a trend, isn't it? Albion works. I thought this was beautiful. We've looked at works by Albion works before. So here's in the kitchen again, very modern looking. Physical, I believe.
01:14:26.084 - 01:15:08.500, Speaker A: Just a really nice physical artwork here. And here, finally, is Eloy Chaperone. Let's see if it shows up, this brilliant work of art here, showing a person that's kind of nestled here in this, if you can see it in this car, inside car interior, here's a steering wheel kind of lodged almost under the seat or on the floor of the car, surrealistically. And a little bit of an edgy image there. And there is the car. So again, kind of reminiscent of JG Ballard's crash a little bit here in the imagery. So interesting work by Eloy Chaperone.
01:15:08.500 - 01:15:17.414, Speaker A: Thank you, everybody, for watching through this whirlwind tour here. We're an hour and 15 in. So it all worked out. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, take care.
