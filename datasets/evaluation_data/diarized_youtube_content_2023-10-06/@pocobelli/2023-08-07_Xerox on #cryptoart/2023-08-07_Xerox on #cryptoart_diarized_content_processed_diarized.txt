00:00:15.720 - 00:00:54.724, Speaker A: Our next guest is an unusual figure who uses the oddities of the NFT subculture as the subject matter of his art. Today we're talking to Xerox to discuss his visual exploration into royalties, CCO contracts, scams and more. Artist Journal, August 2, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show rune tune. How is your week going?
00:00:56.184 - 00:01:05.856, Speaker B: Good morning. And good afternoon to you. I guess my week's been great. Been doing a lot of art, and now we are here. This is kind of like a highlight of my week.
00:01:05.920 - 00:01:25.892, Speaker A: So it's always a magical moment when I actually hear back from you and there you are and it's real. And it's not just some, you know, me talking into a plastic object in my hand and actually nothing is happening. Welcome, everybody. So everybody is here. And so how's the weather, just out of curiosity, in New York?
00:01:25.908 - 00:01:35.624, Speaker B: Oh, it's starting to cool down. It was pretty, pretty dang hot the last couple weeks, but this week's been gorgeous weather.
00:01:36.404 - 00:02:04.990, Speaker A: It's funny, hey, it cooled down here as well. Almost too much. I mean, in centigrade, I don't know if you know centigrade, but it's 21, 22. It's almost a little cool. But after the big heat wave, people aren't so bitter about it as they might normally be at this time of year. So, yeah, interesting. I go to Greece and it's actually perfect for going to Rhodes because now the high is going to be like 31 30 rather than 37 38.
00:02:04.990 - 00:02:07.554, Speaker A: So I'm excited about that.
00:02:07.894 - 00:02:09.434, Speaker B: When do you leave for Rhodes?
00:02:09.854 - 00:02:25.634, Speaker A: I leave on Saturday. So it's a very compressed schedule here. Yeah, I'm really excited. Two weeks they had these huge forest fires, I guess, and those were on the south side of the island. We're staying on the south side on the second week. So we talked to the Airbnb people. Sounds like it's fine.
00:02:25.634 - 00:02:39.114, Speaker A: And they put out all the fires at this point, from the sounds of it, so I don't even care anymore. I'm just going to be happy to be on some island. Fly me into the forest fire, go for it, you know? So, yeah, well, that's the way to do it.
00:02:39.154 - 00:02:43.838, Speaker B: You move to a new apartment and then moments later you go on vacation.
00:02:44.006 - 00:03:12.780, Speaker A: Well, you know, you almost have to. It's so much work. You almost have to, like, I feel like my summer, hopefully I'll feel like summer has started for me at that point because it has been a grind, let me tell you. I'm still settling here, but now I'm kind of, you know, normalcy is coming back. I'm starting to have a little bit more time in the day, you know what I mean? So I'm excited about that. And I'm very excited, actually, to have Xerox here, who I think is out of. I don't actually want to blow your cover here.
00:03:12.780 - 00:03:18.024, Speaker A: Xerox. Welcome to the show, Xerox. Can you tell us where you're calling from and. No problem, if you can.
00:03:18.764 - 00:03:39.878, Speaker C: No. Good morning. Good morning to you guys and everyone who's joined us. Yeah, I'm from Toronto, born in Iran and immigrated here quite a few years ago, to be honest with you now. And weather is all right. A lot of those, the smoke that people got in New York and whatnot was from. From Canada.
00:03:39.878 - 00:03:48.718, Speaker C: So we got. We got quite a bit of it as well. Not really an orange city like New York, but it looks like a clear day today.
00:03:48.846 - 00:04:08.204, Speaker A: Well, I'm glad to hear that. And, yeah, I mean, Toronto, I lived there for four years before I moved to Berlin. Yeah. I mean, it's such a huge city, it's hard to get around in. So you've been there for a while. Sounds like you put some roots down in Toronto. And how are you enjoying Toronto, just out of curiosity?
00:04:09.824 - 00:04:38.586, Speaker C: Toronto used to be a really nice city. I mean, before, like, maybe like 20 years ago or like, you know, 15 to 20 years ago was a nice city. But at one point they're like, you know, we should just get as many human beings in as possible and tax the fuck out of them until they die. So they just kept building whatever they could, like glass curtain wall buildings and just, like, cellular architecture to, like, just pack them in. Right. So that's when I sort of got started going south. And it's, like, unaffordable.
00:04:38.586 - 00:04:59.902, Speaker C: So you can't really have, like, any kind of grassroots, like, artistic presence here. All the artists basically live in Montreal. So, like, if anyone knows, you know, any canadian artists, like, I don't know, Nicholas Sassoon, Louis Ponce. Who else? Toronto. They're all. They're all in Montreal. Like, none of them are Toronto.
00:05:00.038 - 00:05:28.598, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I mean, I lived that myself. I mean, I was in Montreal for eight years before and it was pretty expensive, Toronto, when I moved there after Montreal, but it's nothing like I see now. I mean, a friend just sent me an email with a apartment viewing. It was a condo for $600,000. And there was a lineup of, like 100 people. You know, almost like, you hear about these, like Berlin or probably Toronto too these days. Apartment for rent.
00:05:28.598 - 00:05:44.282, Speaker A: But this is to buy a condo. I mean, it's so desperate. And as you say, they bring in, they invite the world, and then they don't do anything to expand the infrastructure or the public transportation or anything. So it's just chaos.
00:05:44.418 - 00:05:48.106, Speaker C: Not good. Yeah, that's wild.
00:05:48.290 - 00:05:52.854, Speaker A: Yeah. So we could probably spend an hour discussing Toronto politics, but.
00:05:53.154 - 00:05:54.514, Speaker C: Yeah, but let's not.
00:05:54.594 - 00:06:06.492, Speaker A: Exactly. And we have a awesome crowd here. Hey, there's lb. I haven't seen lb for a while. And Evelyn and Skomra Martin, Joe, Sean, Luke. All star crowd here. Mikey Delacrem, rainy fish, cat Ryan and more.
00:06:06.492 - 00:06:34.188, Speaker A: So thank you, everybody, for showing up here. Should be a super interesting show. So, you know, Xerox, like, I. You know, it's a bit of a riddle for me. Like, I was getting asking runetune to kind of help explain, you know, what your art is about, because maybe I'm just newer to the scene to a certain degree. So can you just, you know, I guess maybe give us some background? Have you always been an artist? Like, how did you get into the arts yourself?
00:06:34.356 - 00:07:08.128, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, my background is sound, audio. And a few years ago, it was actually during COVID I have like, a four year old daughter, and she was just sort of, you know, she was like, I think one or two at the time. So, you know, she's sleeping in the room next door. My home studio is in the room right next to her. It's like, I can't really choose where to put it, you know, whatever space you have available. So I got my headphones on because, you know, she's sleeping. And so it just happened to be a really stressful day.
00:07:08.128 - 00:07:34.012, Speaker C: I was just cranking it way too loud and monitoring, you know, way too loud. And I developed this problem called tinnitus, which is like a ringing in your ears. Like, if anyone's ever gone to a nightclub and then come out and hear, like, you know, ringing in your ears the next day, and it usually goes away. Just. It's the exact same thing, except it just never goes away. It's like forever. So I developed this problem, and it was.
00:07:34.012 - 00:08:05.498, Speaker C: Oh, my God. The first. The first year, I would say, was just horrendous. Like, it was really hard to come to terms with, and it was really shitty. But what it did was it pushed me away from audio and I would say back into the visual world because I always had. I always, like, it was for me, I'm a curious person, so I'll explore something out of curiosity only, really. And this is no different with my art here in this space.
00:08:05.498 - 00:08:43.905, Speaker C: It's like, I'll get curious about something. I'll explore it, you know, and I'll just keep exploring it and do whatever I could possibly do. I mean, some people seem to think of it as some type of subversion or whatever, but really what it is is having a way. It's hard to describe, but finding a way to explore my curiosities in the most efficient way possible, like, in the way that that is faster. Right. So I guess early on, I was really interested in a lot of things. Like, I mean, you know, nfts are just, the possibilities for me were just seemed to be, like, enormous.
00:08:43.905 - 00:09:03.954, Speaker C: So before I even started minting, Santiago is here. He's in the audience, so he knows, and Strano is here. There's a few people here that kind of know me from. From way back, but I had a. I had a artist collective before I even started minting, and so I started sort of finding artists around.
00:09:03.994 - 00:09:05.614, Speaker B: What time was this Xerox?
00:09:06.474 - 00:09:08.938, Speaker C: This is, like, early 2021.
00:09:08.986 - 00:09:09.734, Speaker B: Got you.
00:09:10.914 - 00:09:23.890, Speaker C: Yeah. So, like, I mean, my. I was interested. I was curious, you know? And when I say curious, I mean, like, I just. I like everything, right? So I'm like, oh, this is like, pixel art is great. Like, photogrammetry is great. Like, creative coding.
00:09:23.890 - 00:10:20.916, Speaker C: Like, this is, like, before, really, this is way before FX, hash, or any of this stuff. And I just started finding artists, connecting with them, talking to them. And this is under a totally different name, by the way, and I started packing them into a discord and asking him a lot of questions and having conversations with them and learning about, you know, whole variety of different methods and techniques and whatnot, just because I was curious. Like I said, because I'm curious. And eventually, you know, what happened was a lot of people were making a lot of money on these x copy, copycat bullshit things, right? So they're making a lot of money on fake x copies, and it was making everybody really fucking furious and pissed off because there's a lot of people that are career artists that have been doing this forever, and they have their own style, and it's well defined. And, you know, and, you know, if you. If they would just stop what they're doing and just make a flashing skull monster, right, and just fucking.
00:10:20.916 - 00:10:58.684, Speaker C: Just make a gif, like, they would be more successful, like, instantly than if then if they spent the amount of time that they did. So as a joke, you know, I. I kind of got into Xerox. Xerox was meant to be like a complete, like, you know, mockery is what it was, right? So there was this artist and he was a prick and he was an ex copy copycat. And he basically, one of my friends, Gary Edward Bloom, which you may know of, he does these sort of like paperwork. He works with paper, a lot of. He had this free mint.
00:10:58.684 - 00:11:16.268, Speaker C: He had created this project that was supposed to support artists. And it was like a coffee cup project that was all about, hey, good morning to you kind of thing. And he had this Christmas piece. It was a free mint. He minted a thousand. He's like, anyone that wants one, come get one. I love you all.
00:11:16.268 - 00:12:12.434, Speaker C: And this piece of shit artist goes, and there's a thousand of them. He mints 950 of them. Like, he batch mints 950 of the thousand. And he starts airdropping them to his own collectors and flipping them on secondary. He just starts fucking selling these fucking things, right? And I was really pissed. And like, again, like, at this point, I'm like, super familiar with the space, like, I know from the devs and like, like Seifert from FX hash, for example. Like the day he released like the beta of FX hash and he started minting stuff, he was in my server and we were having conversations as a group on what the hell is this thing that you've created? Kind of thing, right? Or like the devs behind, like some of the devs behind the original hand, you know, like marching square and all these guys, these, like, we're talking about the whole infrastructure of Tezos NFTs.
00:12:12.434 - 00:12:50.770, Speaker C: Like we, there were all these people we're discussing things with, right? So I'm like, oh, yeah, what do I do? I'm like, I'm going to make a piece called loser because this guy's a fucking loser and I'm going to make it in his style. And of course it's going to be like a flashing skull monster and then I'm going to put a bunch of dicks in it. Like just as many penises as I could possibly put into this image. And I'm going to make those flash and I'm going to make some of them ejaculate. So this is like the perfect piece. But like, making the piece is not obviously insulting enough. I'm going to pull his list of collectors.
00:12:50.770 - 00:13:23.504, Speaker C: And back then, you couldn't just download collector list through, like object or anything. You couldn't go to like a token and download anything. So, like, there's this whole process for how you, like, download the database of this guy's collectors and then another process for how do you airdrop them? Something. So I just airdropped at the time it was like 1200 flashing dicks to all of his collectors, right? And, and then I went to bed, like it was a good day. Like we, we, we did what we set out to do. You know what I mean? And we're gonna go to bed now.
00:13:23.584 - 00:13:27.416, Speaker A: And I was gonna say with a smile on your face, continue.
00:13:27.560 - 00:13:59.298, Speaker C: Yeah. And it was, it was done. You know what I mean? And by the way, like, I'm not that much of a piece of shit. Like, we went into this guy's server and we told them, we're like, listen, man, like, we'll give back the pieces. Like, you know, like, just don't fuck around, apologize. And he didn't, and he actually did the opposite and he's like, ah, fuck you, whatever it is. So, so I did that and then I went to bed and then, like, I woke up and this thing just kept selling on secondary, like, to a point where it was like, stupid.
00:13:59.298 - 00:14:42.660, Speaker C: Like, it was like within. And there's like a thousand some odd of them. And I guess people thought that I'm some kind of, like, I don't know, like, I don't know what they thought. Like, I guess some of these pieces also went to, like, big collectors because, like, you know, I didn't know who his collectors were, but there's a couple of them that were bigger, I guess. And people at that time were like, were like, so, like, you know, they're, they're speculating to a point where they're just like, monitoring everyone's fucking wallets and like thinking like, oh my God, this guy just got this, like, flashing dick, like thing. Like he must be on to something. So, like, so the people started buying them and like, within, like, within like two days, like, it was like 1020 30 and then 50 of them had sold.
00:14:42.660 - 00:15:30.494, Speaker C: And the price of this thing was like at $4. Tezos was like, I don't know, $200 a piece or whatever the hell it was, right? And I felt really shitty. I actually didn't like this. I was like, this is fucking terrible. Like, what is this? Like, why are they buying this? Do they not, do they not see the dicks? Like, what's wrong with these people? You know what I mean? And then I felt really bad and I'm like, man, like, did I just like, you know, fuck these people over that are buying this thing? So, so I made another piece, like, basically it was called parasite, which was like, x copies grifter. There's like, a mosquito sucking the life out of x copies grifter. And it's called parasite, which again, is supposed to just be a mockery of both myself and these x copy copycats.
00:15:30.494 - 00:16:17.448, Speaker C: I'm like, look, like we're like, we're just feeding off of this other person, this x copy, right? And as a joke, in the description I wrote, well, this piece gives you endless utility and, like, you had all sorts of trinkets and, like, whatever the fuck it is for having this. And I minted 50 of them, and I gave them to the people that bought the first piece on secondary, right? And some people had bought, like, two, so they got two. And some people bought three. Three. So they got three. So it just, whatever the fuck happened happened, right? And again, like, people started buying this thing on secondary, and then within, like, a week, it was at 300 tezos, and then within, like, you know, a few weeks after that, it was at, like, you know, 800 901,000. And then now.
00:16:17.448 - 00:16:34.418, Speaker C: And there's like, 50 editions of this thing, or 51, I should say. And now there's been, like, I don't know, 20 or more sales at a thousand teslas. Right. For that same piece, right? Let me. I kept my promise. I kept. I made, like, maybe eleven free airdrops for that myself.
00:16:34.418 - 00:17:07.174, Speaker C: And then I commissioned probably 50 pieces from other artists and airdropped those pieces to. To the people that collected that thing. So I just. I personally, you know, I'm not super into money in terms of trying to make as much money as possible. And so I just tried to. At that point especially, I was, like, more or less just interested in, like, you know, making funny stuff and giving it away for the most part. So a lot of, a lot of my earlier work was just all free.
00:17:07.174 - 00:17:39.128, Speaker C: Like I said, like, eleven free airdrops or something like that. And then, like, 50 pieces that I paid for and I commissioned other artists to create that I then gave away. So I think people don't understand free very much. And I think a lot of artists don't understand how to approach free because they think they're devaluing their work. But free is what made my work expensive because. And then we can get into that for sure. But, I mean, it's like, I don't know how to explain it.
00:17:39.128 - 00:18:16.328, Speaker C: It's like, it's artificial. Scarcity is a part of it, because if you can't get something, if you can't buy something on primary, it's not available. It automatically becomes more scarce. So the issue is, like, how do you create a connection to your work that's strong enough that someone who gets a piece, quote unquote, for free, won't sell it or will value it and price it? Like, when they get it, they'll turn around and they'll make it even more unobtainable. That's sort of a really interesting idea. I mean, there's a lot. Again, I'm a curious person.
00:18:16.328 - 00:18:41.982, Speaker C: So. So there's a lot of things that I found interesting. Right, so royalty we talked about was like, one of the first sort of royalty free. It was zero royalties on contract. So it was an actual. On the contract, it was 0% royalties, and it was CCO on the contract level. So this is like, right after, like, object released the feature.
00:18:41.982 - 00:19:04.090, Speaker C: And so a lot of people didn't really know. A lot. A lot of people didn't understand what CCO even was. So x copy, famously, he's got, at that time, especially right click and save, was CCO. But people didn't really understand what that really meant, like. Cause he's not one to write a thread. Right.
00:19:04.090 - 00:19:42.114, Speaker C: So it was sort of misunderstood royalty, especially on tezos. Like, there was no understanding of CCO whatsoever. And so that really helped create sort of a foundation for CCO work. So there was like. I think there's 70 some odd derivatives of royalty right now. But then it kind of sparked an interest among other artists friends of mine, to create their own CCO works and to kind of, you know, feed into this. And so there was quite a few other CCO works that came out afterwards, and all of them were really unique and interesting.
00:19:42.114 - 00:19:53.006, Speaker C: But, um. Yeah, it was like, you know, there's a bunch. There's trust, which was. Was one of the largest. No, it was the largest trust experiment ever done in nfts, really, where I created a piece.
00:19:53.070 - 00:20:00.086, Speaker A: Is this. Is this on object trust? Yeah, there it is. I see it. I see it with the cheese.
00:20:00.190 - 00:20:23.778, Speaker C: Trust was a. Yeah, trust was a cheese. It was basically, like, the long story short of it was with 10,000 editions I minted. And originally, and I said, give me your highest offers and the top 25 highest offers. I won't accept them, but I'll give you the piece for free. You're gonna have to trust me. So at any point, I could have accepted any of the.
00:20:23.778 - 00:21:04.924, Speaker C: All the offers that came in, and it amounted to $250,000 before I gave away the pieces. But basically there was. There was 1111 exactly. Offers that came in and at the time it was like 250 some odd thousand dollars us. And so I could have accepted all of those offers with one button, right, as like a batch accept offer. But what I did was I basically burned 9975 editions, and then the remainder I gifted to the people that, that had the highest offers, right. So then I think the highest offer at the time was 22,000.
00:21:05.004 - 00:21:34.510, Speaker A: Insane. So, so you stumbled, like, it seems to me like you stumbled into, I want to say, like the heavy, speculative, like hardcore, you know, the NfT scene, you might say, on, you know, which. But they were on tazos too. But it sounds like a lot of, there's something very kind of ethereum sounding about the whole thing. Like a lot of these probably collectors ported over from ethereum. Does that sound right? Is that a fair characterization?
00:21:34.582 - 00:22:35.310, Speaker C: Not, you know what, you know what it is? This is really, it's really weird. I mean, right now the space is extremely small, right? I mean, in comparison to where we were at some point. But, um, even when it was big, there, there were very few crypto artists, like there. There's like, and there's, there's very few now, and there were very few then. And so, like, if I think for anyone who really starts understanding what that even means, and we're like, we again, we can get into this is like a whole, we could have like two hour conversation just about this right now. But there's this huge misunderstanding that exists in this space about, well, is it digital art? Natively digital art? Is it, like crypto art? And like, people just think of it all as one thing and it's not one thing. Like, you can be a digital artist and not be a crypto artist, you know what I mean? And you can be a crypto artist, and technically you could be very weak on the digital art front.
00:22:35.310 - 00:23:26.790, Speaker C: So, like, crypto art is something that really speaks to the technology and the culture of what crypto art is. It's its own thing, you know what I mean? And it's separate and it pays homage to and it respects, you know, that culture. And if you don't see it and if you don't think of it and you can't, you know, it's hard for you to see, then it's really hard for you to start coming up with ideas as to, you know, trying to create pieces or be, you know, doing things that are interesting for crypto art. It was easy for me because I was, I'm just so curious. And again, I had a lot of friends made a lot of friends with Debs and whatnot that, you know, being a crypto artist, it seemed very easy to accomplish, and it was something I was interested in anyway. So there's like another piece. For example, fair trade, like, burn mechanism is something that I also did a lot of.
00:23:26.790 - 00:24:09.994, Speaker C: And again, this is before manifold, before burning was like automated in any way. So I had maybe like three pieces before, you know, burn was introduced really, that were just burn mechanism. So fair trade is one of them, and fair trade two is a piece that I had. In order to get fair trade two, you had to burn that loser airdrop piece, the first piece, in order to get it. So you'd have to burn, I think, three losers to get fair trade two. I don't know, you know, who NFT biker is?
00:24:10.454 - 00:24:17.966, Speaker A: I've heard of him, and I kind of vaguely, you know, I see him in paintings, basically, and I guess he has some sort of software. But I'm sure other people know.
00:24:18.070 - 00:24:53.884, Speaker C: Biker is like an early, early developer that created a set of tools where, again, this is tools that are considerably more powerful than, you know, what object offers and whatnot. But even before object had a bunch of the tools, I did. Like, if you want to send more than one addition to different people, like, you'd use biker tools. If you want to follow a series of wallets and what they collect, you use biker tools. If you want to know who your collectors even are and who your top collectors are, you use biker tools. So this guy was, you know, is. And was like one of the bigger developers on Tezos.
00:24:53.884 - 00:25:46.254, Speaker C: And I happened to know him very well. And so, like, he created a custom tool for me that was a batch offer tool so that I can put 300 offers automatically on my own work, right, or anyone else's work. So I could just press one button and I could put like 50 offers of 0.05 tezos on one single work, right? There's no functional reason why anyone should have something like this. But, like, it was funny because I was just going around, like, one of my friends would have a drop, and I put 200 offers on his piece, right? So, like, the guy would, you know, like, if someone's going on to his piece and automatically they're seeing 200 offers, like, oh, my God, like, this is blowing up, right? Because it's just stupid how people behave in NFTs in terms of what. How they perceive success. Like, it can.
00:25:46.254 - 00:26:28.380, Speaker C: It's so easy to game. And again, I'm a little bit bored right now. I don't mint quite as often as I used to, but yeah, we can get into that as well. But like, it's so easy to game. So he created this batch offer tool, and I put 200 offers on my own work on loser. And so what happened was I basically bought a whole bunch of my own work and then I flipped it to the people that had to buy it in order to burn it to get that new piece. So like, basically I was selling my own work at 70 tezos, right? And I was buying it back at two tezos or one tezos, right? And I was making the difference.
00:26:28.380 - 00:26:41.504, Speaker C: I was making the spread. So I made, I made 2500 tez right, off of flipping my own piece. So I was buying and flipping my own piece.
00:26:42.364 - 00:26:48.804, Speaker A: How did you make money off of that? So by, like, surely like other money had to come in from someone else, right? Or not.
00:26:48.844 - 00:26:49.474, Speaker B: Or not.
00:26:49.604 - 00:27:07.974, Speaker C: Yeah. So, like, they couldn't. So, okay, so first one was burn mechanism, fair trade. One was burn mechanism. And the second, fair trade, they had to sell it to me in order to get. So they had to sell me, which is something very similar to burn. But no one, for some reason, no one's ever bothered to do this.
00:27:07.974 - 00:27:36.890, Speaker C: It's a hilarious idea for if you think about it. But in order to get that other piece, they have to sell me the piece at one tezos. I'm the only buyer. I set the price of what I want to buy it for, right? And they basically have to buy it. And if they don't have it and then sell it to me. Because bottom line is the goal is that they have to sell me my own piece, right, for one tez, right, right. And then if I'm the only seller at 70, they're buying it from me as well.
00:27:37.042 - 00:27:41.734, Speaker A: Got it. Got it. And that's like the burn. It's kind of like a burn, but where you buy it back.
00:27:42.084 - 00:27:58.796, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And they can't sell it to anyone else. And if I'm the only seller at 70, right? So it's funny because I was competing with other sellers. So I was undercutting other sellers. The other like guys like, oh, I'll sell to you for 50. I'm like, fuck you. I got like 40 of them also.
00:27:58.796 - 00:28:33.946, Speaker C: Like, so I was competing with others, undercutting my own floor. And so, like, I dragged the floor of that thing from like 85 or 90 tezos to like, like 25 teslas. I like brought down the floor of my own work on purpose. And then like, immediately after I pumped it up again, which is like just, it's just a comedic idea of, like, basically manipulating the hell out of something. Right? It's that easy where you can. You can easily bring it. Like, I guess another thing is, like, people trying to manipulate their prices up, but everyone's just trying to, like, scratching their heads.
00:28:33.946 - 00:28:57.582, Speaker C: Like, why is this guy dragging down the price of his own work? Right? It's like, well, because I can. It's like, it's just as. It's just as much of a power trip and a control thing to bring down the value of your work if it's intentional. Right. Why not? Right? I mean, it's just. It's like, why do you have to bring it up? You can bring it down if you feel like it, right? I'm the artist. I can decide what I want.
00:28:57.582 - 00:29:02.350, Speaker C: I have. I can have complete control if I want to have complete control. Right. This.
00:29:02.422 - 00:29:43.192, Speaker A: This whole thing is totally fascinating, and I have to say, this whole crypto art idea that you're bringing, it really is kind of. It's illuminating for me. It explains a lot, actually, because it's almost like I would see visually what certain aspects of what you could characterize as crypto art. But the way you're describing it, it's almost like a conceptual art style, almost, which has certain traits. Maybe it's flashing. It does have certain visuals, style, but it really does. Like, it seems like the collectors like it because it really like the hardcore kind of NFT ETH or whomever.
00:29:43.192 - 00:29:48.964, Speaker A: Crypto collectors, they love it because it speaks to the crypto culture. Is that accurate?
00:29:50.704 - 00:30:02.822, Speaker C: I mean, you know, again, I just. I'm. I call it duck a duck. And this style of. They call it glitch. People call it glitch is like. That's the way I would describe it.
00:30:02.822 - 00:30:17.254, Speaker C: It is called glitch. Like, other people refer to it as glitch, but it's. It's not glitch. Right. So, um, it's really x copy style. Right. If I want to describe what it is, this illustrated glitch.
00:30:17.254 - 00:30:26.686, Speaker C: Right. It's. It's. It's an emulation. It's like. It's like a. It's a illustrated emulation of a lot of what encompasses the glitches.
00:30:26.686 - 00:30:35.640, Speaker C: Using the. In terms of versus, actually. Yeah, using. Exactly. Right. And so we can get into that. But, like, it's.
00:30:35.640 - 00:31:22.254, Speaker C: There's such a. It's become so blurry now with AI and a whole bunch of different techniques and a lot of the actual analog and digital glitch artists are now illustrating. Right. And some of the illustrated glitch artists are now incorporating actual, like, digital glitch, especially ideas like pixel sorting and data moshing and whatnot into their work. So, like, the lines are really blurry, but they used to be dead, dead clear, because analog glitch artists weren't, again, minty flashing like skull monsters, right? So, like, if things are becoming more and more blurry now, but, you know, x copy is one, like, the most well known crypto artists, really, everyone. It's like a household name. So it is.
00:31:22.254 - 00:32:05.680, Speaker C: It's like a style that is born of this world. And there's a few others, like, you know, rob Ness and trash art that are really, they're just genuinely very crypto art ideas. And now with another subset, and Adrian, I share this with you, with spam art. For example, Geno's work, you know, it's a smaller group, but that's a crypto art movement that's born of crypto art. So there are, like, a bunch of, like, on chain nfts that you see, like, rip cash or whatever. Like, that's crypto art, like, you can't do on chain nfts in the physical real world. So, like, there's.
00:32:05.680 - 00:32:36.464, Speaker C: There's quite a few examples that you can come up with and say, like, these are. These are the crypto art, you know, ideas that are out there. But, yeah, this style, my style and my style, like, evolved quite a bit from, if you look at, like, my first mints to my last mints, and you look at my ETH mints, like, you'll see, like, there's like, a very sort of gradual aesthetic progression that is very different than where I started because I got to like what I create aesthetically now. Whereas before I didn't care.
00:32:37.044 - 00:33:30.476, Speaker B: I. There's so much to respond to in everything that you've said, and I really appreciate all this. But, you know, as Poco belly pointed out, like, it's very much kind of like just conceptual art that's on the blockchain. And I think that that's what I respond to the most when I look at all of this. And it kind of, like, speaks to, you know, you used this word earlier on, and I can't remember how you used it, but, like, the mockery that happens with just, I don't know, you go on the Internet and you're going to see terrible human behavior. And that's definitely true in nfts, right? And it was definitely seeing some of the themes and some of these concepts played out that attracted me to, well, first of all, to, like, object and. And to actually pursuing, like, digital art whatsoever.
00:33:30.476 - 00:34:12.384, Speaker B: Like, I was, I was probably a couple weeks away from just being like, this is just horrible. I was on Opensea and just like, just seeing a bunch of apes and pfps and just, like, horrible speculation. It had nothing to do with art. It had everything to do with people just trying to chase coin. And that's when I think it was around that time where I was pretty close to being like, I think I'm done with this, until I saw some of the stuff that you were doing. And it was just like, you know what it reminded me of? And I wonder how you'll respond to this. It reminded me of the way I felt many, many years ago when I was, like, finding out about certain street artists in, like, the early two thousands and nineties and before.
00:34:12.384 - 00:34:50.044, Speaker B: And I think your art operates within the scene much in the same way that those artists were operating, where they were using the phenomenon of street art itself as a grounds to play with concepts and ideas born of that movement. Like Banksy, for example, he's a great example of that, where he's doing these things that are, like, basically publicity stunts, but, you know, everything that he's doing, he's doing for free. It's like, right out there in the streets. But it was using that as kind of the launch pad for a successful career in the arts. Does that make sense?
00:34:51.064 - 00:35:29.370, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I think every, I think it's hard to really get into it, but I think, like, I think that, like, Banksky, like, you know, in terms of, like, the work that he's created and sort of the, how much of a high profile artist that, you know, he is and has become, like, there's, there are quite a few other artists that have done incredible, like, things in street art, but I think to some extent, it becomes an issue of being able to maintain the public's attention. Right, right. So, like, when it's a totally different.
00:35:29.442 - 00:35:56.318, Speaker B: Playground, too, it's just, I think of, I think of street art in a lot of the same ways. I think of, like, crypto art where it's like zero gates, you know, compared to a trout art world. And in a lot of ways, the street artists, as well as the crypto artists, they're fighting against this trad art world that's highly gated. And just like, you know, anyone can go out there and put their, their work on the Internet, just like anyone can go out there and put their work on the streets. And so that's really the kind of the through line that I think, I.
00:35:56.326 - 00:36:08.170, Speaker C: Don'T I disagree with that second one. I mean, like, going back to Toronto. Like, they ripped down all the. All the brown brick buildings and they put up curtain wall glass. So it's really hard to get, like, a stencil on a fucking building now.
00:36:08.242 - 00:36:09.722, Speaker B: Yeah, that's all glass. True.
00:36:09.818 - 00:36:12.834, Speaker C: So unless you want to do, like, a vinyl decal your shit out of.
00:36:12.914 - 00:36:15.654, Speaker A: There'S, like, not a lot of back to Toronto politics.
00:36:16.074 - 00:36:46.076, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, but, like. But, you know, going back to, like, this idea of, like, there's this collector on Ethan. A wonderful collector, a great guy. Comfy devil is his name. And his pinned tweet, if you look at it right now, is he's got this statement that says the key to success for an artist is sustained relevance. So he's chosen his words very carefully there. It's like, you gotta maintain relevance and being relevant.
00:36:46.076 - 00:36:52.708, Speaker C: Right. And that is a fucking stupid idea. And it's a joke, but it's very true.
00:36:52.756 - 00:36:54.544, Speaker A: I was gonna say it's pretty profound.
00:36:54.894 - 00:37:23.992, Speaker C: It's like, yeah, it's like, the most true statement you could possibly have. And so what you end up seeing with a lot of, like, the bigger artists is they keep fucking photobombing other big artists, right? So, like, this, somebody will come up with, like, a collection. Or, like, ack will come up with a collection. Alpha century kid. And then, like, everyone's like, ah, fuck. Like, pianos are, like, you know, trending, and then they'll start banging out pianos. Or, like, you know, somebody will, like, you know, like, tjo, right? Tjo, right.
00:37:23.992 - 00:37:47.904, Speaker C: He's. He's got the watercolor blue aesthetic, and then everyone comes out with blue. Or, like, checkerboard floors become a big thing. Everyone does checkerboard floors or, like, CCTV cameras. Oh, my God. Like, we're frothing at fucking cameras. And can we get a camera to look at another camera that looks at his skull on a fucking checkerboard floor with, you know, like, you.
00:37:47.904 - 00:37:49.080, Speaker C: This is almost like.
00:37:49.152 - 00:37:52.168, Speaker A: This is almost the iconography of crypto art that you're describing.
00:37:52.216 - 00:38:24.456, Speaker C: Yeah. It's like. It's like it becomes a Venn diagram of every single fucking thing that's trending. And then, like I said, if there's, like, a trending topic, you jump on the trending topic. And the reason why this is fucking happening is because a, the space is really small, and so people want tether and connect themselves to any form of success. And the second reason is because there's an algo aspect to this. There's quite literally, like, the likes that you get will impact the future.
00:38:24.456 - 00:39:06.618, Speaker C: Likes that you get. So if you get like two to 300 or 400 likes in consecutive order, the algo will be like, oh, this guy's making great content. We're just gonna open up his shit to a wider audience. And if your posts don't get generate likes, the algo throttles you back and you won't even be able to reach a quarter of your own audience, let alone an extended audience. Right? So, so there's this whole fucking stupid thing that's going on, and I don't know if you want to call that crypto art. It's just like, it's like the arts in general getting, getting basically bum fucked by the algo that, that, you know, now it's called x. Like, it's just, it's just ridiculous.
00:39:06.618 - 00:39:52.494, Speaker C: But it is what it is. That's sort of, you know, what we're dealing with as a, as a, as a race is where, you know, the algo decides everything. The algo decides how you get to the location you're going to through your gps tracking. It'll, if you want to go to a restaurant, it's giving you the reviews of which restaurants you should be picking, you know, on social media, even on social media, like Instagram. Like, it'll expose you to your own friends differently and how you see and interpret them and how successful they appear. Every aspect of our lives are dictated by algorithms. You can get into an elevator downtown here, and it's a bin packing algorithm.
00:39:52.494 - 00:40:03.086, Speaker C: You can't even really pick your floor. Like, each elevator is separated based on specific floors that they go to. Everything is algorithmic and there's a feedback loop going on as well, I was.
00:40:03.110 - 00:40:08.368, Speaker A: Going to say, I mean, because the algorithms are feeding off of what people want, right?
00:40:08.496 - 00:40:52.672, Speaker C: No, the output. The output is, they feeding off the data that's produced by the output. So, for example, like a discussion that I was having, again, I still talk to all, all my artist friends, like, a lot. And the thing that I was, sometimes I'm talking to myself, but they all have to listen to me. You know, like we're talking about square aspect ratios, right? Where like, IG is square and Twitter, really, like, if you're, if you're minting a gif, like, it better be square because if it's portrait, it's cropped a square anyway, and if it's landscape, then it's, it's. There's less square footage that you're getting on your post. So, like, you know, less people see it, it's smaller and it's less flashy.
00:40:52.672 - 00:41:44.074, Speaker C: So you basically, if you're doing, if you're a GIF artist, you should be working in square because that's what you, that's, that's. Those are the options you have. It's like square or square. It's fucking, you know, Model T Ford. It's like you can have any color you want as long as it's black, right? So, you know, you end up with this square, square, square, Instagram, you know, square. And you have a lot of images that are being produced and they're all square, right? And if something like mid journey and whatnot, they're, they're diving into databases where the majority of images are square, right? Then what ends up happening is that the composition options of how people frame images and what images are available. They're buying large square.
00:41:44.074 - 00:42:25.846, Speaker C: So you're relying, or, like, if you go into mid journeys, a great example. If you write anything about a man, you'll get guys that are of all shapes and sizes and ages. But if you prompt, like, females, women, it's like some, like, really attractive white woman, you know what I mean? Which is, like, hilarious. You have to, like, really force the algo to make a woman, you know, old or without makeup. And, you know, like, you have to, like, prompt that. But you don't need to do that for men at all, right? So a lot of it has to do with social behavior, feeding the algo, which then is producing, like, a male, you know, a false image of distortion.
00:42:25.990 - 00:42:29.354, Speaker A: And then that feeds into exact behavior.
00:42:30.054 - 00:43:04.056, Speaker C: Right, right. And so, so there's a feedback loop going on. And so, like, right now, like, if you're, there's work that's being created for Twitter. So, like, exactly. And that's the reality is that, like, if you're sub eight megabytes, right, as a gif, right, then you're doing well on in terms of uploading an image that you know is not going to be completely ruined by the algo for Twitter. So, like, if you're trying to, first of all, it's not going to accept a file that's really large anyway as a gif. So you're making work.
00:43:04.056 - 00:44:00.648, Speaker C: And so if you're minting, it works. A problem that I had is like, a lot of my newer works are like, like above 2030 megabytes, right? And so no one can really right click, save it and immediately post it on Twitter. So, like, if, if I was making work, that's like four or five megabytes, like fans and other artists that if they want to share my work, they can just right click, save and share it. Whereas I've had collectors collect pieces that are very expensive, like twelve to $14,000, and they're like, they can't post my work because the algo won't accept the work. So it's just too big. So they're like, can you send me a different version of this? Can you crop this to square? Like, it's portrait and it's a gif. Like, why are you making portrait gifts? Right? You should be making square gifts.
00:44:00.648 - 00:44:22.794, Speaker C: Right? And so, like, it's like a ridiculous idea if you think about it. It's, again, it's product that's being manufactured for the algo by trying to photobomb hot trends. And then the format is also dictated by constraints that are imposed by social media. And so it's ridiculous is what it is.
00:44:24.334 - 00:45:03.524, Speaker A: It's super interesting, though, because in a sense, everything you're describing, to me, it feels like when you're making art with these themes in mind, it's a kind of commentary you're making on it, becomes a very relevant artist, you know? And maybe that's why people are so happy to pay so much money for it, because all of a sudden, it's a kind of commentary, a really kind of sophisticated commentary, I'd say, like one that kind of was missed by me for the most part, on kind of the. The nature of, you know, our situation and the technology. And again, from this very deep technological context.
00:45:04.584 - 00:45:29.492, Speaker C: Yeah, it's like, it's. Again, it's like, it's crazy because it's like a. It's a rabbit hole that just keeps going. So, you know, it just doesn't end. It's like an endless one, you know? And so, yeah, there's other issues that you end up being faced with. So, like, if you're interested in GIF art, and almost every single piece I've ever created was specifically a gift. So I've done no mp4 s.
00:45:29.492 - 00:45:50.028, Speaker C: I've done one jpeg that was a donation to museum of crypto art. So, like, it doesn't count because it's not actually minted anywhere. So every single piece that I've ever made is. Is a gif. And so to some extent, I'm a gif artist, more so than I am any other genre that you can define. Right. And again, if you're.
00:45:50.028 - 00:46:20.210, Speaker C: You have those constraints, like Strano was. He's in the audience here. Hey, buddy. He was. He's, he's, he's really, really deep into sort of the technical aspects of a lot of this stuff. And he's, he's a wizard, but, you know, it's no accident that he and other artists, like Al Crego, for example, like you're dealing with like, very, a lot of frames. You're dealing with, like, in some cases, like north of like 100, 5200 frames.
00:46:20.210 - 00:46:50.616, Speaker C: And so if you're making a gif that's 200 frames, it has to be basically black and white because if not, that file size is going to jump like tenfold if you, as you introduce color. Right. So it's like, people don't realize that, like, the aesthetic, it has to be a certain way. And it, as a result of those constraints, and if you want to break those constraints, you end up with a different file format. You'd end up with mp4. Right. So it's really, again, it's really interesting.
00:46:50.616 - 00:47:14.414, Speaker C: And my work is the same. My work is exactly like, I have to work within. All my work is typically like, you know, maybe three to four main base colors, tops, and usually two. And there's, there's, you know, there's very, I'm very careful about how much of the area of the Gif I'm actually animating because the more of it you animate, the bigger the file size.
00:47:14.534 - 00:47:17.046, Speaker A: Yeah. Fascinating. Absolutely fascinating.
00:47:17.110 - 00:47:17.590, Speaker C: Weird.
00:47:17.702 - 00:47:35.296, Speaker A: Can we drill down on the GIF part just briefly? And I think I understand what you're saying, but are you basically saying, you know, the GiF, in a weird way is like the ideal or like, let's call it the best file format that's available to kind of have this discussion of sorts that you're having?
00:47:35.320 - 00:48:00.734, Speaker C: No, no. I mean, I think everyone has a different reason why they, like, the people that are obsessed with gifs are usually obsessed with it for a very reason. But it's a very, it's a very Internet file format, right. Because you have quite a few memes that are, you know, uh, produced in, in that format. Um, it loops indefinitely. Right. Um, it, there's, it's bulky, it's inefficient.
00:48:00.734 - 00:48:06.130, Speaker C: Right. And it's one of the first, like, again, like you're around when geocities was around.
00:48:06.202 - 00:48:08.490, Speaker A: And, and I was, I do recall.
00:48:08.562 - 00:48:50.932, Speaker C: Yeah, like gifs were like, were the, like, there was no, there were really no videos, especially none that were like, you know, you could really access through the Internet. They were really just gifs. Right? I mean, there was horribly encoded videos that came a little bit later, but early Internet was really like, like very few pixels. And there were gifs, right? When you, your exposure to animation. I'm just saying, like an animation was like, like the wow idea, right? And so it was, it was a really, it was a really, like, it's a nostalgic file format, I should say. And it's outlived quite a few. Like, there's been hundreds of file formats and this thing is stuck around for better or for worse.
00:48:50.932 - 00:50:06.258, Speaker C: And then there's other aspects to it that are, I think again, like, it's like, there's, there's, once you get into it, like Tumblr, right? Tumblr was, was, you know, a site that basically really tapped into the ethos of the Internet, especially before the porn bots took over. And, and so, like, there, it was like a really, like a rabbit hole kind of thing where, you know, you press the wrong button and you go through enough holes and you end up with like watching the most kinky, weird, like, sex shit you've ever seen. Like there's like inanimate objects, like screwing each other and is that sort of like that, that, that side of the Internet, that sort of like, like that dark tunnel four chan underworld that has given birth to, like a lot of the memes that people don't understand right now. Like Pepe and all these things are like, are, they're all inseparable from, again, that file format, the GIF, right? And so, yeah, it's like, it's, it's a, it's, it's a very. I think it's a very nostalgic and very true to the Internet age sort of format that. Yeah, it's. And those constraints that I was talking about, they produce a lot of creativity.
00:50:06.258 - 00:50:48.914, Speaker C: Like, there are a lot of people, a lot of artists that force constraints on themselves specifically to see what that those constraints produce in terms of creativity, right? Because you have to come up with solutions for them and you have to work within them. So, like, there are people that are pixel artists, for example, like, they're, they're not. They could easily switch over to using brushes and, and large, you know, aspect ratios and size, the, you know, DPI and whatnot. No, they choose to work with like eight by eight cells. They choose to work with like 16 by 16. Like it's an intentional choice, right, to see like, how creative can they be within those constraints.
00:50:49.074 - 00:51:33.508, Speaker A: And like you say, there's oftentimes a, there's, you know, like, for example, if you were to mint on ordinals, if you do some like fancy pants, you know, jpeg with like gradients and, you know, your fancy oil painting, you're going to spend like $5,000 to mint that thing. Whereas if you have to your point, you know, a black and white, you know, maybe gift that's like 10 kb. Well, then you maybe spend $5, right? And so I've been thinking about this. I was like, oh, I want to put something on ordinals. And that's exactly the thought process. It's like, okay. It becomes a way of like, okay, how am I going to create something now? It should be ideally black and white or very few colors and all that.
00:51:33.508 - 00:51:57.824, Speaker A: So this is fascinating to hear, everything. And it rings true, what you're saying. This idea that, in a sense, like, the gif is, it's a file format. It's a medium that you might say exists only through the Internet. I guess it existed before, but it really is kind of like, it encapsulates so much of Internet culture.
00:51:58.504 - 00:52:31.834, Speaker B: It's also, I mean, I would say it's like the looping nature of it is the quintessential part of it, right. Where you have something that's both moving and static at the same time. And this is something I've talked about before, but I think that that's a huge part of it. And the fact that you don't really see it outside of memes and Internet art is kind of indicative of, you know, why it's. Why it's so embraced. And I do like the constraint. I like the 256 colors.
00:52:31.834 - 00:53:01.224, Speaker B: I like how inefficient the file is, as Xerox pointed out. And I've, you know, I've come to embrace that. Like, I've definitely been, you know, at it on the GIF and, you know, having. Making decisions based on, like, you know, how large the end result will be in, like, cutting frames and cutting colors. And those restrictions, actually, they do fuel a lot of creativity.
00:53:04.964 - 00:53:35.654, Speaker A: Beautifully put. Well, we are zooming through this show, so if anybody wants to come on stage and join Xerox and rune tune and myself, you are more than welcome. Kind of a unique opportunity here, an unusual opportunity with an unusual guest here. Just put in a request, and I will happily bring you on stage to join the conversation here. So, Xerox, I mean, this is fascinating. Again, we're already like, you know, 55 minutes into this, so you're mentioning. I mean, there's so many things I want to ask you about.
00:53:35.654 - 00:53:54.752, Speaker A: I almost want to ask if your tinnitus is okay. I mean, ear problems are torture, and part of the torture of ear problems is nobody can relate because. Unless they've had ear problems, because before, and I have a friend with tinnitus and I had briefly ear problems, and it really is torture.
00:53:54.928 - 00:53:57.284, Speaker B: But that aside.
00:53:57.664 - 00:54:14.424, Speaker A: So you're mentioning how you weren't minting as much and maybe that you're even slightly bored a little bit. I don't know if that's the right word or if you use that word, but that maybe you're kind of looking for the next thing. So where are you right now in your kind of art, NfT, whatever journey.
00:54:14.464 - 00:54:15.644, Speaker B: You want to call it?
00:54:16.504 - 00:55:05.766, Speaker C: Yeah. I mean, when I say I'm bored, I think I'm not bored of creating work. I love, I love, I'm still making work all the time and not sharing it, really. And I think that what I'm bored of is the, I mean, everyone's tired of it, man. It's not, it's not me. Right. It's like this idea that, you know, there's quite a few ideas if we're gonna get into it, but the first one is that the relative worth of an artist is supposed to be measured by dollar sales as a joke, because you have artists that are career artists that are, you know, they have to basically mint in order to have the money they need to be able to pay the bills, to support their children, to be able to live their lives.
00:55:05.766 - 00:55:29.074, Speaker C: Right. And they're at a disadvantage to the person that does not need to rely on NFTs as a source of income, because the person that doesn't need to rely on entities as a source of income can mint wherever the fuck they want. They can mint once a month. So there's, there's a natural scarcity that can be created by the people that have the luxury of not fucking minting every fucking day. Right.
00:55:29.154 - 00:55:59.184, Speaker B: You know, I'm glad you, you bring this up, because that's something I was like before we had this faces, like, yesterday and throughout the week, I was thinking about this issue, and I was thinking specifically about one thing that I like that you do is you don't mint constantly all the time. And I was thinking about that and just thinking, like, well, you know what? Some of the people who do mint, like, on a daily basis and their, you know, their average sales, like one tezos or something, and they do like five or whatever. Like, a lot of these people, they really do actually rely on that.
00:55:59.504 - 00:56:05.448, Speaker C: Yeah. It's unfair. So I have the total of not minting. Right.
00:56:05.576 - 00:56:20.832, Speaker B: But the way the market, the way people respond to this sort of dynamic is like. I mean, there's. There's something. There's. There's a problem to point out in that. Right? Like you were saying, like, the, you know, the price of someone's work, you know, it's.
00:56:21.008 - 00:56:21.496, Speaker C: It's.
00:56:21.560 - 00:56:30.714, Speaker B: It's almost ridiculous to put a price on certain people's work, but, like, you know, the price of an artwork will be whatever someone's willing to pay for it. Right?
00:56:31.014 - 00:56:54.788, Speaker C: Right. I mean, I think what I'm trying to get at here is that, like, you end up with a scenario where the. Some of the best artists, and I would say a larger portion of the best artists, right, they. Their work is devalued. Right. In comparison to some of the worst artists who have the luxury of fucking doing whatever the fuck they want. Right.
00:56:54.788 - 00:57:18.940, Speaker C: So that is an issue. Right. That's. That's like, that's like a big, big issue because you end up with, like, a lot of the, like, turds floating to the top of the pool as opposed to, like, you know, which is natural because they don't have this much density. Like, so, like, that's a problem. And it's a problem that I can't fucking fix. You know what I mean? So that's.
00:57:18.940 - 00:57:41.166, Speaker C: That's one issue. And because, I mean, another thing is, you got to remember that, like, a lot of the people that are, again, career artists, it's what they do. It's what they've been doing before. NFTs introduced digital monetization. And this is what they will be doing if all this goes to shit. You get what I'm saying? Like, it'll still be doing it. Right.
00:57:41.166 - 00:58:17.158, Speaker C: They're also the people that are most likely to. And this. I don't know if you want to call this ironic or not. They're the most likely to turn around and support other artists and buy from other artists because they actually understand what it means to be one. Right. And they're the most likely to invest in their craft in terms of picking up tools or moving into things based on their own interests and through their own integrity, as opposed to specifically for a desire to try and make a few bucks. Right.
00:58:17.158 - 00:58:37.692, Speaker C: So there's that problem. That's one of many problems. 24 hours price transparency. That's fucking a disaster. Like, people are pressing refresh on things after buying something to see where the floor is at or what have you. There's a lot of issues, basically. And then there's also copying.
00:58:37.692 - 00:59:10.352, Speaker C: I mean, my name is Xerox. I love copy culture. And Sabato was in the audience and I was talking to him about this, sorry to them about this, but it's like this idea of copying and what copy culture CCO is has been sort of morphed into some bullshit, right? And so what I mean by that is that, like, CCO was never meant to be this, like, first of all, what it predates, like, NFTs by, like, I don't know, 20 years or something, right?
00:59:10.368 - 00:59:12.272, Speaker B: It's for like, the sciences and stuff.
00:59:12.448 - 01:00:05.612, Speaker C: It's for, it's for everything. It's really for, it's really just a designation, a license designation for how to approach free use of a digital asset of any kind. It could be writing, it could be music, it could be visual. But like, the whole point was you're creating work for the commons, you're creating work for the public to then use, and it could be intellectual work, it could be, again, a visual asset. But it was really like a contribution on the part of the creator to allow others to be able to access something at little or no possible cost so that they don't have to waste time doing that, and so that they can continue building and creating amazing things and that. And then, you know, there's a close relative in terms of freeware and free software. It's not CCO, but it's really close to that same ethos.
01:00:05.612 - 01:00:45.448, Speaker C: And here it's been, like, morphed into something completely different. Been morphed into like, this is how, you know, a fucking artist is super successful by them having like, a bunch of derivatives. Or like, there was one particular artist who I don't like who's like a cosplay, like, hacker, like, in this space. He went around and he's like, yeah, CCO is like the way that you basically create something and inevitably, like, at least to you, becoming bigger and end up getting more royalties. I'm like, no, like, that's not, that's not what that is. That's supposed to be for. So, like, I think there's a lot of that kind of stuff of like, things being misinterpreted.
01:00:45.448 - 01:01:35.080, Speaker C: Like, artists should be, shouldn't be just copying the most successful, financially successful artists. They should be creating derivatives of artists work that they like, not just the most expensive work, right? And they should be learning from it. Like, you know, in music culture, you'd remix something and you try and even make it better than the original. Or while you're paying homage to the original, you never not credit it. You always have the name come first of the actual song and the actual artist, and then you say, like, you know, so and so remix, right? So you give credit to your sources and that doesn't happen in this space nearly as much as it should. People just copy, so they don't. People are, for some reason, they think that it's like an insult to their artistic integrity to give props and respect.
01:01:35.080 - 01:01:54.352, Speaker C: And this is not everyone. This is, this is just, again, a specific group that does this. But it's annoying as fuck. So it's like aspects of the culture that I don't like. And, like, you can learn a lot from other artists. You know what I mean? So, like, Ed Morales in the audience, like, he's wonderful. Artists.
01:01:54.352 - 01:02:37.660, Speaker C: Like pixel art. Like, you know, I was looking at his work, like, recently and I was like, wow. The movement of these fears through space. And again, we're dealing with, you know, gif animations and, like, there's a lot of constraints and, like, that's really amazing and that's fucking fascinating. And I don't think anyone can do it. Like, and, like, dai chi is here and, you know, does like, the polar opposite in terms of, like, hugely, like, you know, like complex animations that are layered with, like, you know, brushes and, like, sound and, like, all over the map. Like, like, everyone should be trying to learn something from these people, right?
01:02:37.732 - 01:02:43.532, Speaker A: I kind of want to see a xerox ed marolla piece personally, but if.
01:02:43.548 - 01:02:51.714, Speaker C: I could, I would copy it. It's really difficult to, like, there's like, again, it's like some people just. You can't really. You can't really touch.
01:02:52.014 - 01:02:57.354, Speaker A: Yeah, fair enough. You're a little muffled, just so you know, in case you moved your phone a little bit. Xerox.
01:02:57.934 - 01:02:58.910, Speaker B: Awesome.
01:02:59.102 - 01:03:15.074, Speaker A: All good. And so again, everybody, welcome on stage in our, you know, last few minutes here with Xerox, which is totally fascinating. But I'm still back to this question. It's. So what's next? Xerox or where you. Where are you sailing to next?
01:03:15.854 - 01:03:34.670, Speaker C: Yeah, I mean, I'm. Right now I'm working a lot with. With a few different things. Steel. So, like, I'm doing like, CNC steel. And I do. This is a very specific type of electro etching that involves salt to basically put an imprint on stainless steel and then patina ing it.
01:03:34.670 - 01:04:26.044, Speaker C: So I really enjoy, like, creating, like, physicals and I working with machine plotters. So, like, there's, you know, an axi draw that I've been using quite a bit. And again, trying to break through the physicals on the digital side again, like, just through me wandering around, looking at other artists, like, I guess, Sabato. The work that they've created really has inspired me to get into Amiga emulation and deluxe paint specifically and color cycles and whatnot. I've worked with color cycles before, but there were like fake cycles. They're like, in Photoshop, there's a way of creating gradients and then moving them, which is like a fake color cycle. But like, again, like deluxe playing amiga, it's like its own.
01:04:26.044 - 01:05:22.146, Speaker C: Talk about constraints is a fucking nightmare. You don't, you only want one undo. Like, you know, you can't go back. So like, it's, it's a whole, but then there's this whole interesting thing that happens between like a after effects and, and, and, you know, something like deluxe paint and then, you know, a sprite and like, all these different programs, like, if you want to bridge them and sort of bring it all back to like, Photoshop as a hub, it's like you have to solve, again, problems. Like, and the one thing I haven't seen a lot of in this space and the one thing I've been trying to conquer myself is like using multiple programs to create a work in a way that each program really, really is doing something unique that you can't really do. So, like, every one thing I've noticed, it's really weird. There's like always one thing, like color cycles again in deluxe is like a great example.
01:05:22.146 - 01:05:57.698, Speaker C: It's basically, you can't do that elsewhere. Like, you can, you can try, but, you know, that effect and that look is really hard to do. Or like Mobius, which is like an assi, like, text mode program. You know, it's got a grid, it's got a whole, like, I'm doing a lot of like classic text work in there and blending all this stuff together in a way that, like, makes sense. It's within the constraints of a gif. Like, I. It's annoying as hell and like, it takes a lot of time and it's, it's hard to mint a lot of work.
01:05:57.698 - 01:06:04.244, Speaker C: But like, that's what I'm using the time for, is like experimenting with these things. Been really interesting.
01:06:04.584 - 01:06:07.728, Speaker A: That sounds absolutely fascinating. Sorry, go ahead. Runtin.
01:06:07.816 - 01:06:12.444, Speaker B: I'd love to see whatever it is that you're working on with etching into metals.
01:06:13.384 - 01:06:40.494, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. I haven't ever shared it publicly. No, I kind of eager to definitely share it, but like, it's like, it's really, it's really cool. It's like, I don't know, metal. The problem with physical is like shipping them. They're a lot harder to make, you know what I mean? Because you have to deal with, like, then finding a way. Like, I'm, like, some of the things that I've made are, like, they weigh fucking a ton and you can't bend them and you can't pack them.
01:06:40.494 - 01:06:52.154, Speaker C: So they got to be flat pack. So it's like, it's gonna cost, like, like three, $400 just to ship these things. Right. To, like, if someone wants. Right. So there's, there's a little bit of. It's more like a labor of love.
01:06:53.454 - 01:07:05.624, Speaker A: Well, it sounds pretty interesting. And also the plotter work sounds super interesting. Santiago has reached us on the stage. Santiago, welcome back to the show. Do you have, first of all, how are you doing?
01:07:06.684 - 01:07:14.588, Speaker D: How are you guys? I'm great. It's a nice day. Hi, siroks. Hi, roon. Hi, poco.
01:07:14.756 - 01:07:18.464, Speaker A: Yeah, loving the conversation here.
01:07:19.004 - 01:07:41.674, Speaker D: It's really great. Yeah. I'm knitting a scarf for my kid now. It's like two months making this. She's the same age as Sirok's girl. We sometimes talk about our daughters. That's one of our points of contact since some years.
01:07:42.134 - 01:07:42.622, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:07:42.678 - 01:07:47.834, Speaker D: More than a year and a half we have been friends.
01:07:48.134 - 01:07:56.024, Speaker A: It probably feels like forever. So. Yeah. So fasting. So you both have friends. So that's great. So you guys have known each other for a while then?
01:07:57.284 - 01:08:02.228, Speaker C: Yeah, a long time before, before I started missing under Xerox. I've known Santi.
01:08:02.356 - 01:08:06.824, Speaker D: Yeah. So I have a question for you.
01:08:07.404 - 01:08:15.300, Speaker A: Santi's got a lot of deep roots in this scene. Do you have any comments or questions for Xerox?
01:08:15.492 - 01:09:05.464, Speaker D: Yeah, I have a question, or maybe what are your thoughts? I kind of of, I think you were saying. I was thinking of it, this thing of, like, artists that whatever is the way to put it, but put love in their work or really love their work or are artists as a kind of. I think they will do after nfts if, if this doesn't. Yeah. Etcetera. All that thought. I was maybe thinking that the direction nfts were heading when hen appeared and I wasn't here.
01:09:05.464 - 01:09:40.474, Speaker D: I came after and started meeting on hand. But maybe how it was and the direction it was taken, I guess, like, hen was kind of an anomaly. And those expectations of fairness and nicer competition for audiences or the eyes of viewers are expectations that come from that frame.
01:09:40.814 - 01:09:41.554, Speaker B: Right.
01:09:42.394 - 01:10:10.054, Speaker D: That kind of art scene that grew from hen and echoes of that sort of like, there's this retirement problem in almost every country in the world, and it comes from life being longer and we are not used as a system to host so long lives.
01:10:11.064 - 01:10:23.084, Speaker C: Are you saying that you're wondering if artists should be actually minting for as long as they are and that at some point they've overstayed their fucking welcome and they should just fuck off anyway? Is that what you're saying?
01:10:23.584 - 01:10:39.044, Speaker D: No, what I am saying is that expecting this environment to be healthy, it's a product of hike and nung having existed.
01:10:40.514 - 01:10:48.054, Speaker C: All right, so sorry. Are you, so my question is, are you pessimistic or optimistic then?
01:10:48.674 - 01:10:50.654, Speaker B: I liked your take on it, Jack.
01:10:52.034 - 01:11:37.584, Speaker D: Oh, I am optimistic. I think it can grow to a healthy thing. And what you were saying that is you couldn't wrap your head around how to fix the scarcity versus over minting from people that need this as a shop. I think it can grow to something healthier. I guess it's just artists minds exposed to a harder free market thing than we have fighting with the gatekeepers at the trade art world.
01:11:39.944 - 01:12:27.402, Speaker C: Right. I mean, I personally, I mean, I have my own opinions on this. Not necessarily saying that they're, they're, you know, the God's truth or whatever, but I think that like in order for an artist to, to basically stay an artist, they essentially either need a day job or they need to have income through art outside of nfts if they're gonna, if there's gonna be any sustainable growth is, or, or than being there as an artist. Because it comes down to, again, that whole idea of quantity. If your value is dictated by how low the price is of your cheapest work or whatever on secondary, right. You being constrained by that is, I think is a ridiculous idea. So like, that's another thing that's like people argue about a lot.
01:12:27.402 - 01:12:50.916, Speaker C: Like, especially the artists that really care about their work. They're like, I want people to value this work differently than they did that other work because this one took me like, I don't know, a month and the other one took me a day and that one should be valued higher and that is sort of the market doesn't really care about any of that. Right. So I think, are you trying to say something? Sorry, I think you're trying to jump.
01:12:50.980 - 01:12:52.460, Speaker A: No, no. Oh, sorry.
01:12:52.492 - 01:13:07.492, Speaker B: That was me. I was about to just say, you know, it's, it becomes a tricky thing when you as an artist are trying to dictate the value of your work based on the labor that you put into it. Because sometimes, you know, great idea comes to you and it doesn't take much to, to execute you.
01:13:07.508 - 01:14:05.680, Speaker C: Know? Right. I mean, I think values can easily be manipulated and artists can, can manipulate their own values relatively easily. But I think, like, when it comes to working for years and years and years, if we go to, like, flash forward to 20, you know, 25, 26, and everything's still around, you really don't want, like, work you've minted over the course of, like, three years, four years or whatever to somehow constrain your future work. And so, like, one thing that a lot of artists do is they'll just create, like, a whole new, you know, profile, a new account. It'll be still be backlinked to their, to their Twitter, but they're creating, like, a separate profile almost as, like, a separate brand. And, like, you've seen a few artists, I've seen the quite a few artists have done this. Like, max capacity has, like, several different, you know, basically wallets that he, like, switched over rob ness version two.
01:14:05.680 - 01:14:34.120, Speaker C: There's, like, quite a few artists that, especially artists that have to mint a lot or mint a lot. Like, there's, there's, like, an update that goes on in terms of them separating. That's beyond just like a collection on object or whatever. It's like a separate wallet, right. So that when someone's on that profile and they're looking at the prices, they're comparing it within that profile as opposed to outside of that profile. Right. But I just think, like, overall, like, this space still has to find itself.
01:14:34.120 - 01:15:32.598, Speaker C: People still need to decide what the fuck this thing is. And my, like, comment about this trend seeking thing of, like, jumping on the newest, highest selling artists and, like, trying to, like, capture that and photobomb those artists. My comment there and criticism there wasn't that. That's like, a horrible thing that shouldn't ever happen. My comment was like, but there's also this other artist that's amazing that might not have as many, much of a high sale, but, like, the work is incredible. Like, why only copy one artist? Why only pay tribute to, like, one or two or three or four, whatever it is, ten of the, the most trending artists, and why keep switching that? Like, it's like, again, like, you'll see it over and over again. It's like, well, one artist, like, you know, blows up, you know, the, the adoration pours in and then as they fade away and another artist blows up the adoration.
01:15:32.598 - 01:16:24.120, Speaker C: And it's like the same kind of, usually the same usual suspects that are always, like, jumping on that. And my issue is, like, is more or less like, why bother? It's not like a criticism of them or their character. It's like there could be some, a lot more interesting things that came if like people like, widen their, their adoration and their copy, the copy culture, right. Because like, again, going back to the music example, like, you get a lot of remixes of pretty shitty originals that end up being like, beautiful songs. Like, the remixes can sound way better than the original and it's totally. Yeah. And there's, there's very little in terms of like, like people trying to, I don't filter out based on everyone's not dying or chopping at the bit to make a Taylor Swift remix.
01:16:24.120 - 01:17:43.568, Speaker C: You know what I mean? Like they'll just pick what they like and what speaks to them because, you know, you, you want to be nice on the friendly on the ears and people to like the fucking music and for some reason on the aesthetic world or the artistic world that does not fucking translate. So, like, something could be aesthetically like friggin crap and people will remix it and make it even more crap or adore it to, like, make it, which is, I'm just trying to understand why that is necessary because it's obvious to me that for the most part it's about trying to jump on that engagement trend is one part of it, right? And the other one is trying to associate your own work and the value of your own work with the artists that you're jumping on. Right. Which is probably like the bigger part of it. Right. But none of that to me is, at least for me, it hasn't really panned out that way because what, and again, this, I'm not trying to be like, preachy, but like some of, like the derivatives and the homages that I paid, like, they're, they've been really great for me because they were so far out of my sandbox. So like Kibiband or I think is, I don't know how to pronounce it, this japanese artist that creates these, like, they're called like, the worms, the generative worms.
01:17:43.568 - 01:18:16.870, Speaker C: I created like a pepe of that person's work and it was like, it was a challenge for me to try and emulate his style. But that's like generative art. That's like, and it's not like a squiggle. It's not like it wasn't like this, like, you know, kind of really well known thing outside of the people I think, that knew it, but like, very well respected, but like, it opened me up to a whole other world of generative artists and generative art fans. Right. And it was a genuine tribute. Like, I actually love his work, but I don't know why that doesn't happen more.
01:18:16.870 - 01:18:41.188, Speaker C: Because you kind of can cross pollinate and gain an audience that you previously didn't have with an infiltrated group that you couldn't infiltrate. Right. And with. With commissions the same. I mentioned that I've done like 50 some odd commissions. Like, it's not entirely selfless. Like, for me to, like, you know, commission another artist and then gift it to my own collectors.
01:18:41.188 - 01:19:24.880, Speaker C: Like, it's. It's definitely a positive thing, but to some extent, like, you know, if I'm commissioning that other artists, and again, I'm involved with that other artist, however big or small, I'm also now known to that other artist's fan base. Right. And that reinvestment, I just don't understand why it doesn't happen more, why we're not seeing more of it. Because it really does advantage the fucking artists. Like, it's not entirely selfless. It can be really, like, more effective as a means of actually growing community and bonds and relationships than just, like, dying to, like, you know, like, again, like the Taylor Swift thing.
01:19:24.880 - 01:19:26.764, Speaker C: Right? It's like, it's not necessary.
01:19:27.744 - 01:20:04.384, Speaker B: Well, it's. This has me thinking about that Nicholas Assun comment that. That we talked about a few days ago. I think Poco Belly showed it on, shared it on his. On his journal, which is that, you know, the advice that he thinks about all the time is the sustainable thing for an artist in their art is to build a community of people that they can rely on. And you do that not through just this trend hopping and just kind of like, you know, collectors collecting your work, but like, you know, connecting with people through your actual art and your ideas and the things that you do that are original.
01:20:08.564 - 01:20:41.420, Speaker A: Amen. Amen. So while this has been great, we are running short on time here. So in the final minutes, just any final thoughts for us? I mean, actually, I have one tiny question before. Some final thoughts from Xerox here. Have you ever, you know, I asked this to kappn last week and shout out to captain, captain out in the crowd there, out in the audience listening. Have you ever been approached by any galleries or have you, I mean, you're speaking about, you know, how you should have, if you're an artist, you should probably have something outside of nfts.
01:20:41.420 - 01:20:47.744, Speaker A: Have you ever had any shows or anything? I mean, you're working with all this physical work. It seems like that would make sense.
01:20:49.134 - 01:21:10.878, Speaker C: No, I mean, like, I've had my work shown in a whole bunch of, let's call it like, web, three galleries and, you know, the digital work. Right. And exhibitions and whatnot. And which is, which have been fantastic. Like, I could never dream of being able to, you know, have work geographically because it's so easy. Right. It's so transportable.
01:21:10.878 - 01:21:49.940, Speaker C: It's just them displaying a file. So it's been amazing having that access. But in terms of, like, physical works. No, like, I mean, you know, one other issue with, with not releasing work is you don't want to be defined by something. And so, like, I'm pretty early on in my, my sort of against CNC patina, like, you know, electro etching journey with steel, and to, like, release, like, work prematurely now and try and sell it especially immediately. To me, it's like, it's. It's not something I'd like to be able to do because, like, I don't want that work to sort of define my style.
01:21:49.940 - 01:22:00.644, Speaker C: Like, I may end up, you know, changing and evolving and, and if, if for any reason, God forbid, like, the work is successful, then I'm fucked. Right. Right.
01:22:00.684 - 01:22:02.904, Speaker A: It's a little mature is what you're saying.
01:22:04.524 - 01:22:05.944, Speaker C: It's super immature.
01:22:06.924 - 01:22:08.416, Speaker A: Premature. Premature.
01:22:08.580 - 01:22:34.936, Speaker C: Premature. Yeah. And, you know, there's a consistency curse or like, you know, cohesiveness curse is what they say is like, you know, you want something that is easily recognizable. It's like a xerox. And, like, it has to, like, you know, it has to fit with your other work or whatever the fuck it is. And, like, I mean, I don't have, I don't have the patience for, for doing that. Like, if, if I'm not super happy with what it is that I'm creating.
01:22:34.936 - 01:23:21.888, Speaker C: So I'm still exploring. And, like, especially on the physical front, on the digital front, I think I've to some extent, really found what I like to do aesthetically. And, like, again, like, maybe ETH is probably a better place to see some of the works that I've created with, like, Aaron's law, which was a tribute to Aaron Schwartz. I don't know if Ohms is still here. Yeah, he's in the audience. He's, he's got that one. There's like a few pieces that I've done that I really care about and I really feel a connection to really, like, sort of turn of the century, early 19 hundreds sort of transitional aesthetic where, like, it's like, juggenstiel, there's like, german expressionism, influences with a lot of, like, the newer stuff where it's like, very, like, outlying figures and.
01:23:21.888 - 01:23:48.514, Speaker C: And rough edges. There was another piece that I did. The Sotheby's piece that I did was deathless. Like, there's a lot of textures involved, which is, like, again, a lot of my work is textural, but, like, I'm slowly gravitating towards, like, I think a very, very. If, again, compared to my early work, a very different aesthetic, but it's one that I still think is very digital. If I had a final thought. Yeah.
01:23:48.514 - 01:23:56.320, Speaker C: There's one thing I would say that I haven't talked about, because I talked a lot of here today. Right. And, like, people are just like, man, this guy is like, you can talk.
01:23:56.392 - 01:23:57.680, Speaker A: You can talk. No, but excellent.
01:23:57.712 - 01:23:57.880, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:23:57.912 - 01:24:19.768, Speaker A: Some final thoughts for us. I mean, this has been super educational for me personally on the crypto art front. I mean, you've really illuminated again, I used to think, like, what is this? Like, dungeons and dragons? But it's far more than this. Like, this is pretty serious and pretty cool, you know? And so I think it's awesome. So, yeah. Any final thoughts for us?
01:24:19.936 - 01:24:38.472, Speaker C: Yeah, there's one thing I would say. I mean, like, you know, a few friends and I have been talking a lot about verse, which is like a. What I call a gallery platform, etcetera. You know, they're great, and their curation is great. They're more. More geared towards fine art. But there's been several statements.
01:24:38.472 - 01:25:03.850, Speaker C: They deleted one, and I'm confident it was because of my comment. But it was. There was one. One tweet that they had sent out, basically saying that, you know, when people think of nfts, they think of these fucking memes and these, like, scams. I remember all these things and they're like, you know, but now, like, we're gonna onboard, like, tens of thousands of people, we're gonna do it, right? When they think of it. No, no. They use a very specific word.
01:25:03.850 - 01:25:07.994, Speaker C: They like, now, when we onboard people on Tennessee, they'll think of credible art.
01:25:08.114 - 01:25:08.666, Speaker B: Yeah.
01:25:08.770 - 01:25:27.514, Speaker C: Right. And then more recently, they did another post and. And it was like, I don't know. I don't know, some other artists. And they're like, you know, we're going to be working with this artist. And look like, here's a picture of the gallery in London. And look, here's like, an article someone wrote about him.
01:25:27.514 - 01:26:02.910, Speaker C: And look, like, here's like he's got some fellowship and something. And he's like. And then I sort of got, like, down that thread is like this. Like, this person has a lot of credibility, right? So I think, like, when it comes to credibility and what is credible art there? There's like, one thing that we haven't talked about, but basically, like, there are some people that are trying to be the purveyors of credibility, and they. They want to sort of tell the space, this is credible. This is not credible. This is credible because we say it's credible.
01:26:02.910 - 01:26:08.242, Speaker C: And that's an idea that is really deep rooted into the traditional art world.
01:26:08.298 - 01:26:10.274, Speaker A: I was just gonna say, yeah, yeah.
01:26:10.314 - 01:26:41.900, Speaker C: Art gnome Jason Bailey came out with a tweet shortly after the original verse tweet and said, listen, like, the meme culture and all this shit, that is basically in the crosshairs, like, that is what created basically the basis of NFT culture. That's like, that's the crypto art. And he specifically used the term crypto art. Right. Is what gave birth to this culture. Culture has morphed since then, let's say. But that's what, you can't just destroy it, or you can't really write it off as being irrelevant.
01:26:41.900 - 01:27:54.374, Speaker C: Like it's its own thing. Like, yeah, you can build around it, but don't try and erase this part of history because it's worth something. And, like, within that, there's this idea of kitsch, which is like, you know, this low brow, sort of pop art isn't art. Like, if it's a cartoon, it isn't art. You know what I mean? But one thing I would say as someone who, like, adores satire is that dark humor is actually one of the most beautiful and profound expressions of grief, remorse, of pain, of hurt that you could really find. It's like, if you're in a lot of pain, one of the very few things that could potentially get you out of that pain is humor, is looking at something that is unsolvable and laughing at it as a way of gaining control over it or an understanding over it. And so the only thing I would say is that when it comes to figural, pictorial work, that is really people are laughing at and, you know, trying to dismiss as being nothing.
01:27:54.374 - 01:28:25.060, Speaker C: Like if, first of all, if you're creating it, like, just remember that you actually could be very profound, and it could be. It could be more. There could be more depth to it than any fine art could potentially possess. Right. And it could potentially have a larger impact culturally than what other types of work can possess. But I think, like, there's some dismay missing that's been going on. I'm pretty convinced that it's going to continue going on when it comes to lowbrow or no brow work.
01:28:25.060 - 01:29:15.154, Speaker C: And there needs to be, I think, to some extent, people making an active effort and trying to have better ways of communicating what the fuck crypto art is and what that work really is. And you've done a pretty fucking fantastic job of that, Adrian Poco belly. So could you, you know, with your. With your videos and, you know, you. I've seen the types of artists that you featured, and I absolutely love what you guys are doing, but, you know, being able to help sort of articulate and create a voice for artists that aren't necessarily really great at just, like, you know, selling themselves or communicating what it is that they're actually creating but helping translate their work to some extent. And, you know, not just making it up, like interacting with them and getting their opinion. I think it's pretty fucking important.
01:29:16.614 - 01:29:43.888, Speaker A: Well, those are beautiful words to wrap up on. And thank you, Xerox. And I. Yeah, I mean, and I just want to echo everything you're saying. I saw that tweet by verse, and I saw your response, too, and it was hilarious. And it was. It was just great because, yeah, I mean, as you're saying, it's very much the trad art mindset to come in and tell us dumb people who don't know what's going on, dumb crypto people what's actually the real thing.
01:29:43.888 - 01:30:13.518, Speaker A: And, yeah, that just sort of puts my red alert on immediately. And thank you also for the extremely. Thank you for sharing your. I mean, it's almost precious knowledge that you were giving us on crypto art and that kind of history and what it all means. Like, again, like, I have a. All of a sudden, I have a completely different understanding after this talk. So I'm just absolutely thrilled.
01:30:13.518 - 01:30:15.474, Speaker A: Rune tune, do you have any final thoughts?
01:30:15.774 - 01:30:24.114, Speaker B: Thanks so much for sharing all these. Everything this was. You did not disappoint. I appreciate it.
01:30:24.894 - 01:30:29.742, Speaker C: Hey, thanks for letting me ramble on and, yeah, I appreciate you guys having me on, too.
01:30:29.918 - 01:30:44.134, Speaker A: Xerox, come back to the show at some point, and everybody out there, thank you for listening. Thank you for the. Thank you to all the guests. Thank you, Santiago, for coming on stage. Thank you, Xerox. Thank you, roon tune. Until next time, take care.
