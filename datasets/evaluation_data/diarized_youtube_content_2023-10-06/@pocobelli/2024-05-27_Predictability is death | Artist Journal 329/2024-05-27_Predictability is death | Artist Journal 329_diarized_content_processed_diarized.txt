00:00:05.960 - 00:00:25.810, Speaker A: We're heading back to port. The water is getting to be too much now. It's a matter of survival for this show. We are going on hold until we get the Internet. I realized, I realized I can't fix my Internet and do this show at the same time. So we got to take a show or two off and just get this fixed. It is.
00:00:25.810 - 00:00:50.762, Speaker A: It has been a journey and a marathon and more. Welcome back. Artist Journal, May 27, 2024. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. And check this out while you can. Check it out in case the Internet disappears. You know what I realized? My Internet disappears as soon as I load up these tabs.
00:00:50.762 - 00:01:40.940, Speaker A: Like I'll even load them up in the coffee shop. But I don't know if it's these sites, to be perfectly honest. I wonder if they burned out my Internet. I'm starting to think because like you saw last time I had 5gb on my phone and it disappeared within like 15 minutes, right? I wonder if that's what happened. I wonder if the phone companies are looking at my Internet and going what's this? Like 30gb in an hour? Right? So I wonder if it's these sites, you know, you know, maybe. And as I almost hit the close button, that would have been great, wouldn't it? Because these stream like, you know, I loaded up this entire video and now it doesn't play this beautiful video here. And let's not actually get distracted from the art.
00:01:40.940 - 00:02:03.242, Speaker A: All to say not everything on hold. We're still going to do the space on Wednesday. We got Martin Bruce. How exciting is that? You know, where's the applause button and cheering Martin Bruce is coming on, coming on on Wednesday. So that is going to be super exciting. We'll look at that in a second. This is, I believe Elly Pritz with most wrong king.
00:02:03.242 - 00:02:33.220, Speaker A: There is a Ellie Pritt's last chance to mint, draw and erase kind of goes with our last show with the art the artist at the front on foundation at. .003 I think this is done my glitch collab with most wrong king. So most wrong kingdom and Elly Pritz. And you see here the power. And this is probably a little jpegged out because it's Twitter, but at least it loads. Here's like the high res version which you could see was quite beautiful.
00:02:33.220 - 00:03:12.388, Speaker A: At least this still here, it won't play anymore because I think it was just streaming. I think it just streams. You see that? So I wonder if it's these sites back to that. But anyways, let's go look at the actually, and there's a, we'll get to the corrections in a second. Actually, in the comments, we can get to the corrections. So what do I think we see here? So Eli Pritz, as far as I understand, a glitch artist, right? And I haven't heard of most wrong king but I assume a glitch artist as well. And what I see here is effects on effects.
00:03:12.388 - 00:03:46.332, Speaker A: You know, we're back to effects on effects and how powerful that is because you get all this novel, you know, what I loosely call digitalia? You get all this novel digital imagery. Shall we call it that? Perfect for glitch. And you know what I love about this too, is how simple it is. Draw an erase and it wouldn't have mattered where they were drawing and erasing. The fun. The fun is in the actual watching the work move across. It works perfectly as a gifden as well.
00:03:46.332 - 00:04:04.796, Speaker A: I assume it's a gif. Hard to say here. Video mp4 yeah. So all to say, it's unfortunate these couldn't load up, but it was loading up. But I think this thing just streams until your data is gone. So I don't know which sites. Maybe it's all of them.
00:04:04.796 - 00:04:28.190, Speaker A: None of them. Let's continue. But what a beautiful, beautiful work here, isn't it? You know, this is what I love in glitch. Just beautiful colors and everything. When everything is back to normal, hopefully. I'm worried I'm going to get my Internet fixed and it won't be back to normal because of the amount of data this is using. Anyways, let's continue here.
00:04:28.190 - 00:04:50.696, Speaker A: Martin Bruce. Martin Bruce on digital and physical art. Coming up on the spaces. Come join rune tune. So Martin Bruce is coming, as I mentioned, this is this Wednesday. So I'm stopping the videos till I get my Internet fixed or to like talk to the phone company and ask them to please reconnect me after using Martin Bruce on digital and physical art. Of course, Martin Bruce goes back and forth.
00:04:50.696 - 00:05:15.034, Speaker A: That'll be a good one. That is only on x, so that'll be easy to stream and it won't use too much data. So I should have something working by then, if not in the cafe, if need be. And of course, if you don't know. Martin Bruce, two friends here is a work and I'm not sure it was mentioned on object. I'd bring it up, but we can't. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work.
00:05:15.034 - 00:05:31.410, Speaker A: Two friends by Martin Bruce. So you can see this artist, this incredibly original artist. You can listen on Wednesday. Here's some more work by Martin Bruce. Just the picture. And one of these, what I'd call a sampled brush. It's going to be super interesting to ask questions.
00:05:31.410 - 00:05:55.012, Speaker A: You can ask questions, too. Big shout out and hilarious. Thank you to the wonderful hasdrubal waffle. I mean, you know, how can you do this for free, Adrian? Well, pretty easily. When you get homages to the hair by amazing artists from across the world, you just have to love it. That's how you know. So this is awesome.
00:05:55.012 - 00:06:19.610, Speaker A: This is hilarious. I'm not sure what to make of this kind of skin color here, but very, just awesome. Provocative and fun. Glad to see the pompadour, as we're calling it, has been put to good use here. You know what I was thinking when I originally saw it? They may be giving me Internet. I just got a message from the phone company, from my cell phone. That could be good for us.
00:06:19.610 - 00:06:40.426, Speaker A: So, Berlin, what was I going to say? You know what? I thought this was at first, and maybe it still is, because we saw this on Twitter. At least I saw it. I couldn't load it up. Last time it was just on a PNG, right? I was like, oh, you could just put it on any character, right? So anyways, hilarious and thank you. Cool title. Berlin. Hastruba waffle.
00:06:40.426 - 00:07:02.192, Speaker A: Awesome. Thank you for sending that to me, too. I think waffle sent me another one too, so just huge. Happy. Thank you to Kujib, aka Hasdrubal waffle, aka many, many more. And here are the comments from last show. And we got some good ones.
00:07:02.192 - 00:07:25.360, Speaker A: Who would have thought? So this is Louis JPD. Who would have thought? Despite my innate and enduring interest in philosophy, it is unlikely that I would take the time to look up Phaedrus or other Socrates, Plato. Rants in a book. Rants. I love that, actually. And yet here I am, enthralled, absorbing it on a YouTube NFT artist channel. Now, this is what we do over here.
00:07:25.360 - 00:07:39.980, Speaker A: Predictability is death. There is. I think that's the name of our show here. Predictability is death. Stone the Luddites. Life is full of surprising sources of enlightenment. Thanks, Professor Belly, for the inadvertent education.
00:07:39.980 - 00:08:10.026, Speaker A: And you know what, it's quite prophetic how you spell education here, because I was actually. So I go back. So we were talking about the ion. I thought this was the first work that the old neoplatonic academy started with. And so I decided to read it. And I was like, yeah, this is everything I remember. But then I was like, where is kind of the weeping at the end, where ion is supposed to be, you know, weeping to Socrates, like, thank you for showing me the way in the ion.
00:08:10.026 - 00:08:42.718, Speaker A: It's just a guy rhapsode, I think you'd call it. Someone who recites poetry. And what Socrates basically shows or argues, let's say, is that there's no art, interestingly, in what ion is doing. It's simply just inspiration divine, quote unquote, divine inspiration. How interesting. So anyway, so then I'm like, well, this isn't what I remember at the end. And then, so I did a search on chat sheep et.
00:08:42.718 - 00:08:59.690, Speaker A: It took a few, and I had to use the new one, interestingly. But I did find. And you can find it, and I would bring it up right now. I. We're taking on water. We're just trying to get back to port. But I will bring it up once things are settled, because I want to get back to this, which is.
00:08:59.690 - 00:09:39.104, Speaker A: Which is what? So ion. So then I looked it up and I saw the old. It's actually alcibiades one another very short dialogue, similar narrative structure. It's just Socrates and young alcibiades. Interestingly, and at that one at the end, that's kind of what I remembered, and that's the one they start with. So, interestingly, it was just about not knowing in the Alcibiades, and you think, you know, when you don't. Alcibiades thinking he can be a general in a war, and Socrates showing that he didn't know anything but what they both share.
00:09:39.104 - 00:10:10.962, Speaker A: Interestingly, there is kind of a learning lesson here. The ion Socrates is asking, well, if, you know, I don't actually want to get too deep into it, but at the end it's like, well, because it's about war, the odyssey. Do you think then you could be a general? And Ion's like, yes. And then that's when Socrates does the big takedown. Interestingly, both are. Are saying that they could run the war. And of course, this is all happening, at least dramatically speaking, during the peloponnesian war, and that actually comes up in the Alcibiades one.
00:10:10.962 - 00:10:30.400, Speaker A: So, anyways, I've gone too far. I don't want to lose people here, but there is massive correction. Another massive correction. I think I said Humphrey Osmond discovered LSD. That is not Humphrey Osmond, or how would you say it? He kind of synthesized, I think, is how you'd put it. It is, of course, Albert Hoffmande. Humphrey Osmond is the guy who was in.
00:10:30.400 - 00:11:17.030, Speaker A: Had letters in correspondence with Aldous Huxley and came up with the term psychedelic psyche soul delic. Is it expansion, soul expansion or something? Anyway, let's continue here. Thank you. And I'm glad you enjoyed it because the important thing here is, despite my stumbling somewhat here in the academics of it, you know, this is how all things start, right? If you're an artist, you know, it's not like you're going to start painting a masterpiece. So I'm just happy we opened the conversation and that people are enjoying it. And so I appreciate the comment immensely. And we're going to come back just here and there just to kind of help us build an even stronger foundation if we can, just because we can.
00:11:17.030 - 00:11:34.542, Speaker A: And to keep it unpredictable. DJ Kira, watching your show now. Loving your new ordinal works. Thank you. I really need to get into that world and as I told Kiro, maybe I'd do a short video of me inscribing so people can see how to do it. So that would be amazing. So I think I will do that.
00:11:34.542 - 00:11:52.390, Speaker A: But first things first. But that is, you know, I may do that instead of a show that could be cool too. Let's see. Let's see. Okay, let's continue. Golo, comments from last show also, I collected misgatos and I'm so happy about it. That's the work by this.
00:11:52.390 - 00:12:06.586, Speaker A: This isn't the last. It is the last work or video. Golo is collected miscattos, which is the one with the cats for like twelve tezos. And I'm so happy about it. Totally. Kiro. Thank you.
00:12:06.586 - 00:12:15.938, Speaker A: Oxdk, hurry to watch. Thank you, Adrian. Appreciate it. Your enthusiasm goes a long way. Thank you. Denise Sanchez, great to hear from you. Ilay.
00:12:15.938 - 00:12:30.040, Speaker A: Valiant effort and admirable persistence in the face of Internet glitch waves. Great episode. Love your discussion of divine inspiration and all the art. Yeah, this is, as I was saying last time. And it's good. I think. I think it's good I screwed up with the ion because.
00:12:30.040 - 00:13:11.674, Speaker A: And we'll kind of go back into how we start, how they start things now versus how they used to and what it means from a worldview perspective because I think there's still things we can take away. But it's quite an interesting little subject matter that is, you know, you're not going to find again, you basically don't find it in bare like you'd have to be in a graduate class, I imagine. And even then again, it's generally ignored is really because that's the weird stuff that nobody knows how to explain. So let's just put that to the side is my interpretation. Trippie collector. Love, Nuv. Kicking off the show.
00:13:11.674 - 00:13:32.584, Speaker A: Gonna be a great vibes kind of show. Many thanks to you, Trippie, as I said. And those great vibes. Human boy, thank you so much for your encouragement and support. Wonderful episode as always. You know, I just have to say, human boy has so much grace and has always had grace. And when human boy was just kind of stumbling through and struggling, getting things going, had grace.
00:13:32.584 - 00:13:50.926, Speaker A: And now still building. And we're going to see some tweets here. The latest from human boy still has grace. That is classy. Class act with human boy. So awesome to hear and great to hear from you. We're going to look at some tabs in a second of human boy retro.
00:13:50.926 - 00:14:00.614, Speaker A: Manny, really enjoyed the philosophical deep dive. Awesome. Glad to hear a learned crowd here. Rural idol. This was fun. Bless you. Getting a data re up mid journal.
00:14:00.614 - 00:14:21.656, Speaker A: That's tenacity. Sent you a Heidi airdrop for the memories. Little mushroom there. Hilarious. I was, you know, I was very, you know, this was one of those shows, the last show where I just kind of loaded it and I just went like this and was like waiting for it all to come falling down and everything. So thanks for the positive response. Our kells.
00:14:21.656 - 00:14:31.920, Speaker A: Love this one. Adrian. I want to hear more about your experiences. Would be so good to have an in real life chat about this someday. Indeed, kells. Yes. Or spaces or whatnot.
00:14:31.920 - 00:14:47.844, Speaker A: I'm over here in Berlin. Going to Canada in a week though, so it could be. It's going to be a sporadic schedule for the next two or three weeks. Canada could be better. I may be actually showing more shows because the Internet will probably be better. Mirror kit, look at this. Thank you so much for including me, Poco.
00:14:47.844 - 00:15:00.996, Speaker A: I'm a multi disciplinary artist girl from CDMX. Lol. Also, sweet interface price was set up by the gallery. It's crazy, but imagine it sells. Would be amazing. Thank you so much for the mentions and the words. Well, just thrilled to have you watching.
00:15:00.996 - 00:15:11.470, Speaker A: Mira kit. Awesome work. I think we have another one. And here's waffles. Thank you, Poco. We'll send you a pompadour in a minute so you don't have to search again. Really fun show.
00:15:11.470 - 00:15:18.846, Speaker A: Thank you. I'm thrilled that it was minted. Really fun show. Nuv. Right into Phaedrus. Wow. Quote about madness and muse rings true.
00:15:18.846 - 00:15:45.820, Speaker A: And you know what's good? Despite my kind of stumblings here on getting the facts right, and we're gonna correct everything with Internet. We're gonna go back with actually, we'll look at the syllabus, so to speak. I quote about madness and muse rings true. I find raw and naive art more alive than proficient art. Accuracy isn't required for sublimation, in my opinion. So a deep thought here. Accuracy isn't required for sublimation.
00:15:45.820 - 00:16:20.722, Speaker A: Interesting thoughts from hastrubal waffle and just showing, just showing how learned and fun and what good sports you all are. I'm glad you're enjoying that. So thank you for the comments. And one more thing we have to do here is bring up the community, which I think will load as the data has loaded while we started the show. And thank you. Ok nart hi with the beautiful paint. Is this a photo? I think this is like a digital painting if I'm not mistaken.
00:16:20.722 - 00:16:39.860, Speaker A: Kind of photo based. So cool color, nice contrast there with the blue and the orange and oxdk. Have a lovely weekend, friends. This is not a banana, not mint. I've seen a few bananas. I don't know what's up, but maybe Oxdk knows what's up. Late gm thank you oxdk.
00:16:39.860 - 00:16:54.892, Speaker A: And so another one here. And mork ningen. I just noticed I could share my works here. Indeed you can. Yeah. Generally I go for what I need to put it in the rules, but it's a loose rule. But generally try and do like one post as far as your work a week.
00:16:54.892 - 00:17:16.444, Speaker A: If you have links to other stuff or other people's work, post away. As far as your own work for everybody. I think that's just like then you put out your best for the week and awesome. So anyways. Or you put out a post like this with a few all at once here. So all to say thank you for the posts here. Thank you for sharing, everyone.
00:17:16.444 - 00:17:32.564, Speaker A: Yeah, because it loses its impact, right? The more that are done, it loses its impact. And look at this skull takes. We actually have this in here, this awesome work by Dan Control. Iris Deleuze. Thank you for posting. Beautiful work here. Kind of floral.
00:17:32.564 - 00:17:47.810, Speaker A: We've looked at Iris Toulouse before, I'm sure, but. And here antimony. So we looked at this and here of course was the skull takes. So we looked at this last show. Pretty sure it loaded up if it didn't. And there's even actually volume. Here we go.
00:17:47.810 - 00:18:02.806, Speaker A: That was the one we one of the ones I think that got halted. Cool. Abstract. Thank you for posting. Azerd Betamax. We had a betamax shout out to mom. I will see mom shortly in a week and a half.
00:18:02.806 - 00:18:25.830, Speaker A: So excited for that a couple of PSA, psas here, public service announcements, Ilay Scamalert two. There's a phishing site impersonating our Zora called Zonrade. If you search for Zora through a link, it's now the top hit. As you see here. People get the ad, buy the ad there, and then people get scammed. So fake Zora, here it is. Zonra.
00:18:25.830 - 00:18:48.460, Speaker A: That sounds like an art piece waiting to happen. Zonra claim your this is also a scam. Scam alert. Andrea Oliveira cibola so be very careful out there. I received this notice in my email. So did I, actually, this morning I was like, oh, the exchange art. Airdrop happened for the airdrop claim, for the exchange art, I didn't click it, but look at the who it's from and you'll see it's kind of, it is a scam.
00:18:48.460 - 00:19:11.186, Speaker A: And on the official exchange art, there's no mention of the claim. So be careful exactly when airdrops soon. So it hasn't happened. So don't click on that email. And continuing on, Tornado Rodriguez NFT community has given me the opportunity to meet insanely good artists. So true. People who truly love art and some crazy minds that are always projecting new things.
00:19:11.186 - 00:19:46.852, Speaker A: So, you know, it's funny, I was on the weekend, I was at a friend's going away party. And the reason why I was like, happy to share this is like, you know, I live in this bubble that it's like, oh, why wouldn't you like nfts and crypto? But all sorts of, there's a terrible perception out there. I'm sure I'm the last person to really, you know, realize this. And I kind of knew. I kind of knew, but I didn't really realize just how powerful the campaign has been, you know. So this is the reality for a lot of people within it. From Tornado Rodriguez out of Argentina, just on the spaces a couple of weeks ago.
00:19:46.852 - 00:20:04.124, Speaker A: That was awesome. And here's Kiro showing a rannic steer on this beautiful digital frame. Interesting ratio, maybe a four x five there. A very nice ratio for a digital art frame. Pretty unusual. I wonder if Kiro made that himself. Anyways, it looks great.
00:20:04.124 - 00:20:22.166, Speaker A: Let's continue here. Amelia versace painting like it's 1998 on object.com. pretty nice for the object 98, you know, Microsoft paint emulator. Very nice work from Emilia. And here's another one. Let's see if it loads. It does.
00:20:22.166 - 00:20:40.322, Speaker A: You know what will be an interesting question is if I run out of 5gb of data during the show that'll be the ultimate, like, test whether there's. It probably won't, but it'll be interesting to see if it does. Anyways. Object paint. Here it is. Very cool. Looking good.
00:20:40.322 - 00:21:04.260, Speaker A: Looking very good. Here's Kristen Roos. Look at this new weaving this week. Of course, we know Kristen Roose's beautiful digital works. Works a lot with the vintage software, right? Retro tools, as I like to call them, and then making this beautiful tapestry. And, you know, I've been talking about, remember, and we're gonna see here in a second walk. You know, these works for $100.
00:21:04.260 - 00:21:22.272, Speaker A: You know, here you go again. New pieces this week. Try not to test for two smaller pieces. So I guess it's something. Who knows where this will be cut. Interestingly, I will be selling smaller frame pieces in the coming months. Once I've cut everything off the loom, they will be more affordable than some of my larger pieces.
00:21:22.272 - 00:21:40.870, Speaker A: Around two or $300 plus shipping. Canadian, that's like $200 USDA. For a $300 Canadian. It's like, add 50%. That's how bad the exchange is for us Canadians. So very cool. And again, I'm kind of back to welcome to your free art consulting here.
00:21:40.870 - 00:22:08.676, Speaker A: And I see eBay works have gone up a little bit. We'll see that in a second. Here we are. And before we actually go into how much they're selling for, let me just really show how, first of all, amazing walk is as an artist, excellent photography as far as getting the hype going as a collector. You go, ooh, that's beautiful. Very nice photography here. And you have to love the professionalism, as you see here.
00:22:08.676 - 00:22:47.310, Speaker A: A piece of blue paper and then typed, Peter. The title spray on paper. The size walks website. The year, the walk stampede certificate of, you know, like, this is like, the authenticity, right? Sometimes you can use, like, an embosser. I think Warhol used that at times. And also here, then it's signed like, this is a masterclass in how to do this properly. And that's part of the reason walk selling his work, because all of a sudden, then there's nothing distinguishing your production from what comes out of a gallery when you're implementing all of the things that a gallery expects.
00:22:47.310 - 00:23:05.450, Speaker A: Super professional. Then you're like, who cares where I bought this? I don't care if I bought it off eBay. It has everything I've bought and stuff in galleries, you could say to yourself, which doesn't have everything it's supposed to have. So super professional. Look at this. €121.22 bids walk.
00:23:05.450 - 00:23:19.628, Speaker A: Current bid, 48 hours left. How interesting. I mean, it's a steal. And you saw how good the other one looked in the past part too. I think it was that MF character. So exciting times. And of course I follow walk.
00:23:19.628 - 00:23:42.172, Speaker A: That is an x glitch when you. I can't load up all the pages again. Trust me. Human boy, I'm getting asked this a fair amount. So anyone who is interested mid journey and gimp, how is human boy making this? Egotistical is asking how do you make these mid journey and gimp. So more grace from human boy sharing. Sometimes the image comes out ready for my finishing touches.
00:23:42.172 - 00:24:02.604, Speaker A: And gimp, sometimes I want to fill in some space with new elements. For that I usually use outputs from mid journey. I'm not going to end up end up editing and here even a screenshot. And look at this. So human boy showing the process, which is very cool. And look at that. So how cool is that? So props to human boy.
00:24:02.604 - 00:24:19.824, Speaker A: Here's the latest. 64,000 views only human boy, I mean, incredible. Human boy, 64,000 views, 220 retweets. This is just a still, this isn't even moving. So that is awesome. And here's another one. And of course I follow human boy as well.
00:24:19.824 - 00:24:41.946, Speaker A: 28,000 views. And this just came out, what, a day and a half ago. So nice work. Again, just distill human boy now at 8542 followers. So picked up a few hundred over the weekend at 1.4 million there on that work there. Kiro artists can't add any more on the new galleries on foundation.
00:24:41.946 - 00:25:09.180, Speaker A: I mean, so Curo has been working on this gallery for what feels like a year. A new exhibition has to be created each time and only curators can add the art. Long live the open free worlds. Thanks for listing new art on friendly integration. Elly Pritz, cloud noise mch x 17 so. So I guess some changes there. I'm not sure if they're probably for the.
00:25:09.180 - 00:25:52.672, Speaker A: Yeah, who knows why they decided this was quite sad. Kelowna Contemporary an artist at Kelowna Contemporary today is a very sad day for Kelowna contemporary art fam as we mourn the sudden loss of artist and dear friend Matthew Dougherty. Matt was the salt of the earth, a champion of the local art community and a tireless steward of the scene. So I didn't know Matthew Doherty, I didn't know the art, but I thought, seems like a great guy and Michele is a great guy. So I thought, let's put in Matthew Doherty. And there's some of the artwork there, show it there. And so you can learn more if you go to Kelowna contemporaries Twitter page.
00:25:52.672 - 00:26:25.750, Speaker A: And so shout out and thoughts to Mikilenae and to the family and everybody involved who knew Matthew Doherty. Jan Lucas Migone. This was an old one, but I thought, wow, this looks pretty pro painting made in 2020. And Jan Lucas Migone, just pretty awesome. Looking really nice, just in black and white there. How cool is that? You can almost, I feel, can you see pencil there? There must be pencil. But who knows? I'm not sure if that's freehand or not.
00:26:25.750 - 00:26:40.670, Speaker A: Murakit. So we just heard from Murakit. Thrillingly. My collection Aqua Pixel will be temporarily projected on night parties at Sauna Disco Club in Guadalajara, Jalisco. I think that's mexico. Indeed. Go see.
00:26:40.670 - 00:27:20.960, Speaker A: So again, this incredibly interesting artist here, another challenging, interesting pixel artist. I think we have more work by them on this by mirror kit in this show. Element Li, where do you see this using? You know, I've actually done similar things as far as, if you ever look at the sidewalk, the secret history of world War three. Like, I would take pictures of the sidewalks. Sometimes I would do brush marks, take photos, put them in, you know, play with them. What you can also do is take pictures of the sidewalk, and you'll notice it starts looking like an abstract painting. You don't need to look far, just look.
00:27:20.960 - 00:28:19.570, Speaker A: So what I love to, so I absolutely love this then, because what, look at what elemently is doing here. Basically using this structure here, as far as I understand, just kind of tracing it, and then almost like Leonardo da Vinci, Max Ernst style, seeing things within what you're tracing, then seeing, oh, I see a hill here, I'm gonna make something out of this. And then you have this beautiful, super original, artistic looking artwork. The color palette of a weathered wall in an ancient structure might serve as the backdrop for a piece like green mountain. The creation of spotlight was influenced by the eerie sensations of entering an unfamiliar location at night, where objects only partially reveal themselves, while the majority remains concealed in darkness, shrouding what lies ahead. So very cool from element Li. And actually, I think I brought that up, that next image.
00:28:19.570 - 00:29:01.394, Speaker A: So here, just some more beautiful work from element Li. But again, kind of working with. Maybe that's here it is kind of working with physical and digital. Like, it's a very interesting way of working to get the inspiration. When I mentioned Leonardo and Max Ernst, they were both like, put it this way, Ernst quoted Leonardo. I don't know if it's apocryphally or for real, I assume for real from the notebooks in beyond painting of this idea of when you look into a cloud, as an imaginative exercise, see how many things you can see. Right? Because, of course, you're kind of, you know, the paranoia imagination to kind of quote Dali.
00:29:01.394 - 00:29:31.050, Speaker A: As you are looking at the clouds, you're seeing things, and it's really, are you seeing yourself to a certain degree? Are you seeing human nature? What are you seeing? It seems to be something from within, interestingly. And just another beautiful work. Looks like a letter, perhaps a wild juxtaposition, almost like photographic here. And then maybe a bird that looks like a medieval knight. History. Beautiful work from element Lee. Just super interesting.
00:29:31.050 - 00:29:55.020, Speaker A: Now, this, I believe, is physical turned into a gif. I've been looking for a way to make a full blade print that looks good on its own and still works as an animation. So this is something savage. And as you and look, it's even made with a plotter. So kind of a physical gif here. We've seen kind of stuff like this before. I don't remember seeing this one, though.
00:29:55.020 - 00:30:27.614, Speaker A: Quite beautiful, too. You know, this physical gifs are very interesting as far as the different ways you can display them because of the multitude of frames. Of course, a gif is made of, you know, anywhere from two to 200 frames. Right? And each one of those representing a still work of art. So, all of a sudden, you have here, on one hand, you have the gif, which is juxtaposed on top of each other here. Oops. And then on the other hand, they're side by side.
00:30:27.614 - 00:30:50.090, Speaker A: Let's just kill this here. And also, Ruslan Vialtov here is a nice physical rendition here of one of Ruslan's works. And I thought, just how interesting is this? Another variation here. Kind of looks like it's printed, doesn't it, on some sort of board. Very cool. Let's see. Let's pray.
00:30:50.090 - 00:31:08.466, Speaker A: Let's see if the data is still here. This may use all the data. Let's see if this loads. Oh, this could be a sad day, my friends. Okay, we have stuff here. Okay, we are good. As you see.
00:31:08.466 - 00:31:26.824, Speaker A: You know what the problem is? Why my Internet still isn't fixed? Because I'm doing this show, and so I keep going. I need to do the show, and so I'm not fixing my Internet. And so it goes. That's why we need to go to Portland, and I need to repair. Here it is. Okay. K hole by hasdrubal waffle.
00:31:26.824 - 00:31:50.772, Speaker A: So we got a few new works here, different textures. And look at this fuzzy cigarette there. And just cool, interesting experiments and everything. Kind of a countercultural title, just interesting experiments. Kind of got some painterly textures there. K hole by strublewaffle. And it looks like it's still five editions available.
00:31:50.772 - 00:32:16.476, Speaker A: Getting some really nice collectors there. Rapture. This one was brilliant, edition of five. So putting out some additions here on object, the original hastrubal waffle account. How cool is that? And all sorts of wonderful things going on here. And again, it really, you see the freedom and the fun of working just. And look at the nice repetition here.
00:32:16.476 - 00:32:47.852, Speaker A: Reminds me of working on this pixel art inferno thing, because all of a sudden it's really liberating to not be constrained by anything but your imagination. And then you're constant, you know, we're almost back to the cloud because you put. It's almost like inspiration. We're almost coming. Like, as I like to say, as I once said to myself, I follow the music that my pen makes on this paper. And what, what I mean by that. And as I was reading, I reread both the ion and the Alcibiades one this weekend.
00:32:47.852 - 00:33:34.096, Speaker A: Ion is only half an hour. I actually kind of recommend it for that reason. It's one city. And one of the interesting things in the ion is that music stimulated the divine inspiration, so to speak, which was interesting, and I didn't remember that part, but it rang true. When you're working visually, completely different, but not entirely in the sense that just as, say, the noise of the pen on the paper, if you're writing poetry, not that I wrote poetry, but if I was, you know, stimulates. And almost the sound of the writing almost stimulates more. The same thing when you're drawing.
00:33:34.096 - 00:34:15.906, Speaker A: Putting down a stroke stimulates your imagination, and then you have almost that Ernst Leonardo thing going on, you start to see things, you start to make associations, you make another stroke. Boom, boom, boom. And it's like this kind of interface somewhat between randomness, you know, the music coming in, the pen being scratched on the paper for the writer or the artist making a mark on the canvas, and your imagination, which I put in quotes, whatever that is. Right? So another beautiful, all to say, another beautiful work by hasdrubal waffle here. Rapture, indeed. Wfh. I don't know what that stands for.
00:34:15.906 - 00:34:32.707, Speaker A: That could be a good thing. I want to believe so, yeah, I just love this. Just more beautiful, beautiful, original, fond work. Looks like someone at an office. Kind of your classic, you know, UFO poster here. Some beautiful glitchery in the background. Pixelated glitchery.
00:34:32.707 - 00:34:47.355, Speaker A: Look at this. Look at the chair. Incredible texture here. And just shapes, digital pixelated shapes. And a beautiful rainbow frame. And here is one more. It looks like so different.
00:34:47.355 - 00:35:14.522, Speaker A: I think softwares are being used here. And here's another one. I think waffles uses gimp, if I'm not mistaken, as well, a lot of people use gimp for the animation, as human boy was saying. But all to say, just another cool improvisation is what I would call this beautiful jazz improvisation. Meatball subs. Almost like subway. And maybe there's the line at subway.
00:35:14.522 - 00:35:28.440, Speaker A: Who knows? Beautiful, beautiful work. It's feels like can't go wrong over there. Sabato, new work. I feel like I haven't seen a drawing exercise for a while. I might have missed a couple on vacation. Look at these. Look at how minimal this is.
00:35:28.440 - 00:35:57.380, Speaker A: It's almost like. It looks like experiments. And then you just add a little bit of flash, right? A little bit of flashing here, a little bit of animations. And before you know it, you have kind of an interesting abstract composition. Blocko Novae 14, Tezos edition of 25. And I'm sure more than two have sold, so 18 to go. Beautiful work from Sabato.
00:35:57.380 - 00:36:21.194, Speaker A: Great to see another drawing exercise. Nicholas Sassoon out my windows four eight bit version. So how cool is this? So, of course, we've seen Nicholas Sassoon do these. Basically what I'd be tempted to call landscapes, as many of you will remember with those super, highly textured. Here's kind of a lo fi flatter, eight bit version, as Nicholas Sassoon calls it. A maybe three colors here. Black, red and white.
00:36:21.194 - 00:36:47.224, Speaker A: Retro Manny making progress with not a number. This is pretty interesting, isn't it? I mean, are they actually making a video game? This is pretty interesting. We talk about art inspired by video games. This is almost like a video game that's kind of art inspired. So super interesting to see what they're going to do over there. We shall reload. Sean Luke.
00:36:47.224 - 00:37:19.944, Speaker A: And so here, just another interesting work by Sean Luke of a animated abstract here, using a framing device and some sort of spiraling going on in the middle. Beautiful textures and beautiful piece. A lot of retweets there, as usual. Huge collector base for Sean Luc, Jean Provencher. I feel like we've seen John work with Mona Lisa before, but I don't remember exactly like this. First of all, I love the composition as a whole. I find it kind of interesting and just kind of fun and refreshing.
00:37:19.944 - 00:38:14.822, Speaker A: There is a bit of a Google image vibe to it, too, in terms of the structure. I love, though, also how it almost goes, you see, from more complex over here to less complex to just like, you know, reducing the Mona Lisa to a rectangle, you know, and interesting color here. This is quite beautiful here, too, you know, so I feel like, you know, when I see stuff like this, to me, this just reminds me of. We're just scratching the surface here, as anybody who's made digital art in a dedicated way has, I would argue, has probably thought to themselves at some point, like, there is so many things that can be done here. And I feel like this is just another example showing of how. How open, how green this territory is. You know, there's so much to explore, which is one of the reasons you can be really excited about this scene.
00:38:14.822 - 00:38:35.394, Speaker A: F hash is the harmonic of the earth. Another beautiful work by Nicholas Dietrich. Five tazos. Look at this. And loving the color and the fragments here, as you see, even a little bit of a gradient here. Look at how big it is and keeping it unpredictable. Unpredictable.
00:38:35.394 - 00:38:51.310, Speaker A: And look, almost a fire in the building. So super interesting work here. A head turning work. F hash is the harmonic of the earth. Just love it. Just so many great artists in this scene. Here's Kappen.
00:38:51.310 - 00:39:08.076, Speaker A: This is number three of. What is this called here? Admin core is the series. See if we can find the title. There it is. Well, Kapn was nice enough to put it in the work. Mainframe zero three. Exactly.
00:39:08.076 - 00:39:33.296, Speaker A: So we have the third mainframe here. I kind of wonder to myself, this is like a phone structure. I wonder if Kappn is using actual phone insides, like maybe from online as a loose reference. There's something kind of persuasive looking about them. Very, very, very cool. Nice. Just kind of commentary on technology and just so fun and beautiful, really.
00:39:33.296 - 00:39:46.464, Speaker A: So free mint on Zora. Here is Silva sand twos on Zora. So this has loaded up. It is going good. Lunch. You'll need it. Interesting.
00:39:46.464 - 00:40:06.306, Speaker A: Almost like virgin, the record store here logo. And as you see, kind of a longer glitch here. So pretty, pretty cool work here. I think it's even still going. I think this is still one overlord nes three minted so far. I think that is it. Very cool.
00:40:06.306 - 00:40:36.658, Speaker A: Now, this is super interesting here. This is stippin pixel, you know, not a noted pixel artist, right? Super original. We've been following on object forever. Look at these interesting pixel patterns. It's like as if you're making your own dithered brushes. Here is what this looks like. And nice fill for contrast here, the yellow fill, but you have these different kind of pixel kind of dithering patterns.
00:40:36.658 - 00:41:01.670, Speaker A: Some look like almost customized, like we see in the, in the face here. Even the hands with the elongated cross here, dither. Very interesting work here from stippin pixel that was posted on x. Green ginger. Welcome, traveler. So a campfire, and we're starting to get into the summer season here. Interesting color from green ginger.
00:41:01.670 - 00:41:26.466, Speaker A: Kind of almost looks like night, but it has a white background. There's the fire, of course, and just very interesting. Welcome, traveler. Only a Tezos 50 edition of 20. And they are starting to move. Here is John Carroll, of course, a lot of, you know, the skeletons on object lighting a hot dog, almost roasting a hot dog. The skeleton here, this time on Zora.
00:41:26.466 - 00:41:44.924, Speaker A: Pretty interesting to see such a noted Tezos artist on Zora. And I'm all for it, I think. Why wouldn't you? I mean, look, 176 minted. This is bringing home the bacon. That's why artists, you know, I would argue, are still using Zora because it really is a. And same with tazos. It's a legit.
00:41:44.924 - 00:42:15.090, Speaker A: It's like those are the platforms that are going to survive, the ones that are really delivering for artists. That's really, I think, what it comes down to here, to state the obvious, I suppose. Armilk tired. Look at this. So armilk with a beautiful work on Zora and almost like a winamp kind of look beautiful. Almost 808 like colors there. There you see a bit of music, but it also looks like a financial candlestick chart.
00:42:15.090 - 00:42:31.530, Speaker A: Very cool. A lot going on here. A lot going on here, I think different kinds of exports, too. Very beautiful. Beautifully colored too, with that blue. What is this called? Returns of pinball wizard, maybe. Free mint on Zora.
00:42:31.530 - 00:42:40.690, Speaker A: Very cool. Check out Zuozo. Follow the. Follow. Follow the flowers path. Free mint on Zora. There's music.
00:42:40.690 - 00:43:16.820, Speaker A: Kind of wild. It almost looks like video of a computer screen. Like, how else, how else would you get that angle? This looks like Zuozo actually filmed the computer screen and then started processing it. Interestingly, the courage, as we were seeing with Nov. 1914, Martin Bruce, of some of these experimental artists, when they're like, again, it's. It's awesome. It's awesome.
00:43:16.820 - 00:43:31.808, Speaker A: Here is a new one. Pincendo en loque digist. Not exactly thinking about. I don't know what that means. Here's some flowers. There's a gato. And I'm learning Spanish through neuve 19.
00:43:31.808 - 00:43:48.096, Speaker A: Fourteen's work here and just having a coffee in a big armchair. Look at how beautiful that is. Again, that kind of almost metallic color line extension gets that one. The price is rising now. 13 tezos. Here's another one. Ahec gets it for 13 tezos.
00:43:48.096 - 00:44:05.374, Speaker A: These, again, these kind of narrative works, I'd be tempted to call them. Yeah, uber collectible here. As you can see, two friends having a red wine outside. Just beautiful. Brindis. Interesting title. Perdita en la nieve.
00:44:05.374 - 00:44:17.490, Speaker A: Not sure. Pokeball a. It's like, is this recording? Oh, is trippy collector. Awesome. Thank you, trippie collector. Thank you, Trippie collector. What a beautiful.
00:44:17.490 - 00:44:31.150, Speaker A: What a, what a great scene. Big shout out to trippie collector. Thank you for the gift. And how beautiful is that we got. Look at that. Thank you, everybody there. Awesome, awesome scene.
00:44:31.150 - 00:45:01.028, Speaker A: Okay, continuing on, Dan control Nakia connecting people. I don't know if Dan's posted this before, but it's pretty rad and I don't remember. And it's just pretty rad. Again, this could be on a billboard. And what's so cool is you probably would think it's real if you didn't realize it was an artiste. Imagine you put this and then underneath your, like, you know, exhibition from April 30 to June 12, you know, 2024 at the Neue National Galerie here. That would be rad.
00:45:01.028 - 00:45:53.530, Speaker A: And you see how that'll happen one day, I would imagine, especially with brilliant works like this humor, you almost get a weird sense of bacon. I would argue it almost. To me, this almost becomes, maybe accidentally, because I think Dan control is just really having fun and playing with repetition, you know, as we say, reusing elements, as we like to say over here. But there does seem to almost be a. It almost looks like a mask, too, but there almost seems to be a commentary, maybe just because it's on my own mind as I kind of edge towards flexitarianism of the industrial farming of animals here, which is completely disturbing for me personally, as a long, lifelong meat eater. It's interesting, you know, very quick story. Maybe I already told this story.
00:45:53.530 - 00:46:28.248, Speaker A: I was at Alexander Platz here, and they have the people with, what is it? The guy Fawkes masks, and they have a tv and just hanging from their neck, Guy Fawkes mask. And then Alexander Platz is like the main square, let's say, in Berlin, where all the trains meet and everything, and they just had industrial, you know, a cow being decapitated. And I thought to myself, I don't need to eat meat. I don't need to eat or at least reduce it that much. Like it actually worked is what I'm saying. Anyway, TMI, as they say. Gloom tube on Zora.
00:46:28.248 - 00:46:40.270, Speaker A: Awesomely. So here is gloom tube. Kind of looks like hockey equipment and a knife and a key and everything. USB. What is this called? What is this? Still life? Gloom tube. Gloom. Two by two.
00:46:40.270 - 00:46:53.530, Speaker A: One edition, surely. Mint. First mint starts May 26. I wonder maybe the mint is higher. Yeah, so at 0.01 would probably be $40. So maybe it's a.
00:46:53.530 - 00:47:05.600, Speaker A: I'm not sure how much this is. I think that would be $40. But I could be totally wrong. I've been wrong before. Maybe it's a free mint. Not sure. Cool work, though.
00:47:05.600 - 00:47:21.016, Speaker A: I think we have another one by. It might be slightly out of order here as I was just trying to get everything going. We have another one by gloomtube coming up. Awesome. Great to see gloom on Zora Braun. Shibuya incident. Another one of these awesome square abstracts.
00:47:21.016 - 00:47:35.106, Speaker A: And again, some parts moving, some parts not. Just. Very, very interesting and cool work here. This is an edition of 15 for eight tazos. And look at it go. Awesome. So bronn is really making progress.
00:47:35.106 - 00:47:51.306, Speaker A: This was picked up by Kuro. Kuro posted this. I don't know if it's new or not. Maybe it's years old. January 2024, I think, if I'm not mistaken. What an interesting artwork. Just kind of cool.
00:47:51.306 - 00:48:09.156, Speaker A: So the artist. Who is the artist? Raphael Rosendahl. Twist number 18, part of art blocks. So I think that's usually generative art, if I'm not mistaken. Pretty nice piece. Hermeep. Pixel art.
00:48:09.156 - 00:48:26.038, Speaker A: This is on Instagram. So just another very original and interesting pixel artist. And again, maybe out of Japan, not sure. Korea, if I had to guess. Yeah, just another cool work here. 18 likes. Pretty good.
00:48:26.038 - 00:48:41.910, Speaker A: Anis Abdin. Also on Instagram. And really beautiful work here. Charcoal, one bit, two colors. I love the minimalism in this piece. Makes me wonder on the file size. So just beautiful work from Anas Abdin there.
00:48:41.910 - 00:49:06.006, Speaker A: I think we might have another. These might be slightly. Still working on everything here, but we had to start Juanitos. I think this is part of neutro frame drops. So here is just a very cool illustration of a car, one of those 1980s sports cars with the kind of back to the future doors. And here, I don't know if what language. Maybe that's Korean or Japanese.
00:49:06.006 - 00:49:19.690, Speaker A: Not sure. Anyways, just beautiful, fun artwork here. A cool artwork. This is Juanitos for neutral frame drops. Here's another car by PP Universal. This is on Instagram. And you see PP's signature texture there.
00:49:19.690 - 00:49:36.974, Speaker A: So cool work there. My first Tesla model at Universal in Mars. Interesting. And here's another one by PP. This was kind of hilarious when you text something super controversial in a group chat and immediately go to. Go to bed. Beautiful artwork, PP.
00:49:36.974 - 00:49:53.886, Speaker A: If this painting is yours, this is awesome. Love the contrast. Very interesting contrast. Here's Yuri J with a gorgeous canvas. I want to say just a gorgeous canvas and foundation. Let's see. There we go.
00:49:53.886 - 00:50:09.864, Speaker A: Oh, and we'll see if it loads up. Here we go. So a beautiful winter scene by Yuri J. It's just gorgeous. The house is in the snow. Make an offer. And maybe just posted, but not listed yet.
00:50:09.864 - 00:50:37.770, Speaker A: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work. Here's the other work by Gloomtube. Testify. So kind of more, kind of like more recent gloom tube work with the textures. And there is the angel gloom tube with the little halo on the hat. And here is the devil on the other shoulder. And so here is gloom tube's cosmic, uh, dilemma, shall we say, edition of five.
00:50:37.770 - 00:51:01.978, Speaker A: And I believe these were sent to winners of the raffle for the other work. I believe that was listed because gloom tube. Here's another one by gloom. Usually does a raffle when something's listed on tazos, so I think gloom was doing the same thing. Doesn't this look like the Salvador Dali still life? It feels like a direct influence here and there. And. And so there's the glass and everything.
00:51:01.978 - 00:51:14.314, Speaker A: Cool pixelation. And what is this? That almost looks like old computer paper. No, maybe that's a tablecloth on a cider block. Or on. Not even sure. There's some garbage. Orange cone.
00:51:14.314 - 00:51:32.340, Speaker A: Kind of looks like a YouTube with the icons on the front. Or some sort of unavoidable situations. Interesting work. Interesting composition. Two days to go to mint it, so maybe a short mint. Interestingly, maybe three days. Here's mumble boy with a ton of rad work.
00:51:32.340 - 00:51:51.880, Speaker A: Unfortunately, he was having problems loading. But here's one transportal irrigation engineer. And maybe that's the irrigation here. Love the color. Another highly prolific experimental artist here, mumble boy keeps delivering. This is in the art market, the fake whale art market. So that's seven tazos edition of ten.
00:51:51.880 - 00:52:09.922, Speaker A: Here is l'inquisiteurhenheze. And this is called stop. Stop. And some stop signs. And a figure in the background painted on and kind of feels like a bit of a procreate work. Interesting piece. Pink sky and everything.
00:52:09.922 - 00:52:32.440, Speaker A: Here's RJ. I'm not sure this is probably from an older series, but RJ had posted this and I thought it just might maybe kind of look kind of nice in this area. Playing with kind of a looser style on the walls here and on the floor. And a more filled out style in the what might be a mirror. Nice and ambiguous there. Ambiguous spaces with RJ. One body problem.
00:52:32.440 - 00:53:09.320, Speaker A: And here, hopefully this place is Mandel with this wonderful work here, we're going to see if we can get that high resolution here. Pool chillin. Just awesome. Look at the great colors of this page too. We're going to try one more time here. And this is p one and Mandel, I believe, 50%. 50%.
00:53:09.320 - 00:53:18.140, Speaker A: And we'll see. And there's Sabato. Loving it. Degen, art critic. Hilarious. Here we go. So that is the full res version.
00:53:18.140 - 00:53:34.144, Speaker A: And here's the music. And then it goes out. Okay, we're not gonna push it, but you got the picture. You get the idea. Cat once a week for Mannadol. And I believe p one indeed, doing the chip tune. Totally awesome.
00:53:34.144 - 00:53:51.670, Speaker A: Here is Murakit. This is on artsy. So we got some clues from murakit in the comments here. What a rad artist. I'm so happy when, like, super rad artists like this are commenting on the show. This stuff is. I just find it exciting.
00:53:51.670 - 00:54:10.266, Speaker A: Very exciting. This one's not moving. $2,000. Like, let's see what happens. Again, I'm kind of back to what if this was made physical? Right, so, sorry, this might be slightly out of order. I thought everything was ready. So of course you'll get a window into my process here.
00:54:10.266 - 00:54:32.394, Speaker A: Anis Abdin Day 147 seaboard so we're back to anis Abdin. Interesting. Still pixels on top kind of reminds me of brawn in its own way. And this idea that you have moving layer underneath, and then you put a static layer on top, and then you get a nice automatic contrast kind of animation contrast. Quite beautiful. Nice title. Also natureworks there.
00:54:32.394 - 00:54:56.204, Speaker A: These are on gemena buenavida. My inaugural bitcoin works. So this is with p five js. It renders live from HTML and JavaScript code stored entirely on chain. I'm kind of curious. Maybe with chat GPT, we can all do this. Like, I always figure, like, there's something you need to know how to do, and you probably do, but this is pretty cool.
00:54:56.204 - 00:55:17.958, Speaker A: I wonder if you can even like, upload a photo to chat GPT and then say, render as p five js. That would be pretty rad. I'll have to try that out. I wonder if you could do that. Maybe you can't do that. Anyway, deep gratitude to proper and trigamma and Gamma IO for their kindness and support in making this happen. Yeah, really interesting.
00:55:17.958 - 00:55:33.786, Speaker A: Cool work here. I wonder how big it is. I bet it's super small. Seba Sestero with a couple of really interesting works here. Here's a bike with a plane in the background. Super interesting, ambiguous works. Plane in the bottom here.
00:55:33.786 - 00:55:49.378, Speaker A: And then we have another one. Pray that it loads. Let's do this. Do this. An airplane in the desert. And another, just really interesting piece here with a handbag in the background. And look at these colors.
00:55:49.378 - 00:56:26.480, Speaker A: And then the shadow. You know what this looks like to me? If I had to guess, as the pigeon interrupts the show here. You know what this looks like? The pigeon is watching the show. Actually, the pigeon's about like a meter from my head through the window. Anyway, you know what this looks like to me, kind of excitingly, something that's kind of, I've done this with an 808 once on object. You'll see this looks like it's taking layers from works and just going boom. What is that? Like? I'm going to take this layer from here, kind of Dan control kind of does this to a certain variation and take a layer from a different work and put them in a work.
00:56:26.480 - 00:56:48.784, Speaker A: And I'm just going to see what it looks like. I was doing that with different layers of 808 rendition. And then all of a sudden you kind of get like an impression of an 808. And here in Dan Control, you get interesting juxtapositions here. You also get interesting juxtapositions. So it's kind of tempting when you see the shadow here with the plane. Very interesting.
00:56:48.784 - 00:57:05.682, Speaker A: An airplane in the desert. Very interesting. Pardon me. So edgy work here from Lorna Mills. Hard to watch, actually. Beautiful color edition of 20 and quite a few selling here already, eight gone. So nice for Lorna Mills there.
00:57:05.682 - 00:57:38.656, Speaker A: Here's LB Kidpix and analog video hardware. So kind of like we were seen with the first work by Eli Pritz. And I want to say most wrong. Maybe I can actually get there most wrong king as we were seeing with Elly Pritz and most wrong king using multiple effects on effects, incredibly powerful to get very rich textures. So Kidpix and analog video hardware. Very cool. Here is inavare.
00:57:38.656 - 00:57:52.626, Speaker A: Interesting piece. Cycle of Ina number three. Kisses a cycle. So maybe a portrait of the artist. Interesting. Really rich glitch here from Inavari edition of 38 tezos. Eleven left.
00:57:52.626 - 00:58:05.570, Speaker A: Here's another one. Glitchy Sunday, a super rich textured work. Kind of looks like a woman on a beach with an axe. Maybe this is from a movie. Not sure. Pretty nice piece, though. Here's Klaus, composition 210.
00:58:05.570 - 00:58:26.266, Speaker A: Nice minimal work with some beautiful kind of wiring at the top. Right? Interesting colors. I think we might have some other ones too. Here's Kiro with a gorgeous digital painting might need. Or video painting. Let's see if we can get a better version of this. We can look at that and look at the paint on the front.
00:58:26.266 - 00:58:50.094, Speaker A: Even referencing an abstract work. Pretty cool. Love the composition as well. As far as ratio auction, starting at 0.01. Here's acid boy with some pretty interesting, really high res looking psychedelic abstraction. Although here at not so high res because of my Internet. Here's another one.
00:58:50.094 - 00:59:09.710, Speaker A: There we go. Coming in sharper now from acid boy. So, continuing to experiment, here's composition 209. So again, forgive this being out of order again, we're heading to port here, just so you know. So, Klaus. Beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful. Beautiful color.
00:59:09.710 - 00:59:27.990, Speaker A: And look at this kind of edge. Just breaking the frame. Very interesting. And here is Mo, I believe. Is this Mo? I'm pretty sure this is Mo. If I'm wrong, though, apologies, but I'm pretty sure this is Mo. Just very cool AI art here.
00:59:27.990 - 00:59:39.550, Speaker A: Kind of japanese theme. Here's another one. Yeah, this is Mo. This is also on Zora. Look at this. Beautiful. Again, kind of has a textile feel to it.
00:59:39.550 - 01:00:11.810, Speaker A: And here's another one. Kind of a medieval feeling with this wiring and igloos, incredible juxtapositions and cool compositions. You could make, like, again, you could make pretty wild paintings. If you like, oil painted this, it would just. People would be wondering where on earth that came from. Here's Elo cote. So continuing with the kind of shaman, techno shaman theme and kind of like with these Allah, 17th century, 18th century woodcut.
01:00:11.810 - 01:00:25.294, Speaker A: These are really. Look at that. 1121 likes. Like another artist here who is doing spectacular. 22,000 followers. So it can happen pretty quickly when it happens. Here's Martin Jo.
01:00:25.294 - 01:00:57.334, Speaker A: Happy Sunday. Little bears got coffee. Like, I think it's so exciting. We see so much what I'd call success because, you know, with what human boy's doing, with what El Okote's doing, you're building a real audience there. Like, these are people you can sell your art to, in theory. You can sell merchandise to of your, you know, art and whatever prints, like, businesses are being formed here. But right before our eyes on, like, you know, what feels like a couple of times a week, you know, seemingly, anyway.
01:00:57.334 - 01:01:12.770, Speaker A: Martin Joe with some very cool. More. Is this a good night, bear? Happy Sunday. Little bear's got coffee. So a couple of guitar bears here in the studio with Martin Joe. So how cool is that? Love that one. Great color.
01:01:12.770 - 01:01:31.048, Speaker A: And so, of course, we're in the AI art area. Lily illo with some pretty interesting chairs here. Nice and abstract on top, and nice textures, kind of painterly textures at the back. And here, no hygiene. I don't even need to look at who. No hygiene. Wild on Zora.
01:01:31.048 - 01:01:52.672, Speaker A: More incredibly experimental, edgy artwork here, this time from no hygiene. Here's another one. I think this is no hygiene as well, because who else would dare. Who else would dare do something like this? This is pretty wild stuff here. So you three minted. So getting mints. Two, which is awesome.
01:01:52.672 - 01:02:07.874, Speaker A: Yeah. Nohygiene ethnicity. And here is Santiago with an a. I believe this is an AI. This is for highlight XYZ doing a series here. I think I brought it up. Here's number 83.
01:02:07.874 - 01:02:23.980, Speaker A: Kind of reminds you remember the art book we were looking at that kind of looked like new american paintings. The magazine. This would fit in, like, beautifully there. And look how beautiful this is. I mean, I would say, like, bad art. I'd say pretty good looking. Pretty interesting.
01:02:23.980 - 01:02:38.040, Speaker A: And here you can see more. So I think you can. Here it is. You can free, I guess. Not entirely free, but almost a free mint. I'd say there's a little fee here. Highlight XYz and I think doing a lot of.
01:02:38.040 - 01:02:53.450, Speaker A: I'm going to save my data, because I know Santiago's files are enormous. Mutter so highlight Xyz, Santiago's AI series. Look at this. By the master. By the master. Walk again. Buy them while you can.
01:02:53.450 - 01:03:09.230, Speaker A: That is your free art consultation, courtesy of your host. Buy them while you can. 100, you know, €120. Get them while you can. Albert Tanet Dansa macabre, 1.6 by 1.4 meters.
01:03:09.230 - 01:03:32.220, Speaker A: So this is just on Instagram. Interesting painting. Kind of found some new artists here by Nick Ophelia and their sponge. You know, classic theme with SpongeBob squarepants and maybe another characters, other characters from the show. And then, of course, Ophelia from Hamlet. Classic theme. And a pre raphaelite, pre raphaelite subject, especially Darren's hooler.
01:03:32.220 - 01:03:49.224, Speaker A: Never seen this artist before. Interesting use of the notebook. Kind of echoes demon ego a little bit, uh, in the structure. Although who knows if they. I'm not saying on purpose. And also interesting. Just kind of watercolors and everything.
01:03:49.224 - 01:04:15.830, Speaker A: I mean, this could be probably from a completely different scene here. Uh, pretty cool, though, isn't it? Interesting artist. Very fun. I, again, I'm kind of back to the new humor. Like, this isn't. This is like, the exact opposite of, like, super, like, cold abstract art or, sorry, conceptual art that you still see, by the way, they still. They're still doing it in the contemporary art gallery that you're supposed to, you know, ponder.
01:04:15.830 - 01:04:36.046, Speaker A: To me, this is like, you know, you got. I think we could call that the new humor, maybe. That's my other digital art book, the new humor. Mark Belden Fence, 2012. I love it. This is from way back in 2012. So really refining the style.
01:04:36.046 - 01:04:55.422, Speaker A: I mean, because we see new ones from Mark Belden. We've looked at a ton of Mark Belden's work. Very subtle painter. It's not gallery. Vincent Langard, this skeleton. Again, I'm kind of back to the new humor. Like, where is this coming from? How is this, you know, the first reaction if you're a traditional art history person, you just put down your art history book.
01:04:55.422 - 01:05:13.460, Speaker A: You're like, what the heck is this? Right? Must be a new generation. Look at the sun. So I'm excited. Like, to me, like, this humor is actually revitalizing painting. We see it in machine. Let's see if we can get our outro song going here. We may not be able to.
01:05:13.460 - 01:05:25.980, Speaker A: And that is it. I wonder. I wonder if the data's run out. It is possible. Anyway, thank you for joining me. We're gonna go until I get the Internet fixed. There's gonna be no videos but Wednesday.
01:05:25.980 - 01:05:39.960, Speaker A: Hot, hot interview. Hang out. Come hang out with Martin, Bruce Roentoon and myself. Should be awesome. Thank you for joining me. Until next time, when everything is sorted out, take care.
