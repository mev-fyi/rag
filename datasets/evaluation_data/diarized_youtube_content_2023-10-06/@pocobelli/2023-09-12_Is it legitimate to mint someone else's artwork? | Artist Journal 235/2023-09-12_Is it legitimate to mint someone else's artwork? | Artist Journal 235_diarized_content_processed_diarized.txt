00:00:02.760 - 00:00:23.834, Speaker A: Another day, another masterpiece, Gozo, with another stunner. Here, a headline for our tabloid. Here, our tabloid of the mind. Our tabloid of the imagination. Welcome back. Artist Journal, September 12, 2023. Broadcasting from the editor's desk on the pirate ship of the mind.
00:00:23.834 - 00:01:14.930, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and I welcome you back in full hd. By the way, I was doing a whole bunch of experimentation this weekend because I have to take this show on the road because I am going away October for about three or four weeks. October, say 10th to November 5, going to London, and then I'm going to Rome, and then I'm going to Sicily, where hopefully I can do see a little archaeology as I wander around the world and do my work. And so here it is. So all to say, I need to take this show portable, and I actually figured out how to do it, but yesterday's show did not end up in hd, so this one should be. We are back in business here. I'm glad nobody commented on that.
00:01:14.930 - 00:01:34.872, Speaker A: I was a little concerned because there's no way I could re record it due to time constraints. So, speaking of which, let's go and look at this. You know, another day, another masterpiece, right? I mean, look at this thing. This is. Let me just show you who it is. First, it's Gozo. But let me just show you on the page.
00:01:34.872 - 00:02:18.760, Speaker A: This is on object, a real tribute to the Tezos blockchain. I mean, I don't want to overstate things. It's a beautiful work, but it really is. I mean, there's a few things first, you know, my first thought when I saw this, and this is Gozo with an awesome title here called projection. And again, Gozo is the artist who did this awesome work that I almost started with the other day. And so really kind of hitting their stride here. Remember, in Gozos, the artists that did these kind of, like, surrealistic, you know, still life still lives, as my mom wisely corrected.
00:02:18.760 - 00:02:40.604, Speaker A: It's not still lives, it's still lives. Shout out to mom. So who did these surrealistic still lives here? And just kind of was experimenting. And boom. We have three stunningly original, gorgeous works here. And again, my first thought when I saw this is. It just looks like art.
00:02:40.604 - 00:02:59.304, Speaker A: It just looks like art. Like, there's nothing to say. You can't quite rationalize it. You can't quite like. You don't. It just looks beautiful and you don't even know why. Like, it really hits at some very deep levels here, almost seemingly effortlessly.
00:02:59.304 - 00:03:28.610, Speaker A: So a brilliant process is enveloping here. I want to say or is being revealed in these last three works. There is just a lot of, there's a lot to love. And also, and by the way, it's 500 tezos on secondary now edition of 20. And it actually took a while to sell out. I'm sad I missed it. There's spoogles, there's MCH X, there's Kazuhiro Ihara.
00:03:28.610 - 00:03:54.144, Speaker A: So all star crowd here. Tempert super bright burka byram. So all star crowd buying this piece. But still, I'd argue a little off the radar. This took 6 hours to sell out. So that is, you know, there's still opportunity out there. And yeah, like, I mean, to me it tells me this person is still somewhat, a little bit undiscovered.
00:03:54.144 - 00:04:16.548, Speaker A: I mean they do have a big following with these works here and I think they have quite a few followers. You can't see how many they have here. But anyway, Gozo, we'll just open up the twitter really quickly here. 2000 followers and everything. Just a stunner. And of course we know them from these pieces. So pretty cool, pretty cool new series.
00:04:16.548 - 00:05:01.370, Speaker A: And just finally on this, I brought it up big so that we could actually see what's going on here. And you see how large the file is. And it's actually quite interesting, it looks like, and I guess we can double check this. There's almost kind, I don't know if you can see it, but it almost looks like it's saved as a gif or something. Like you can see little separate pixels here, like really tiny little pixels. And I don't know if you can see that, but it actually adds the way it's been exported actually really goes well with the piece. You see, it's almost like that there's kind of a dithering, I want to call it a pixelation of sorts within of these much larger, you know, anti aliased pixels here.
00:05:01.370 - 00:05:38.174, Speaker A: But you see these tiny pixels, maybe I can bring those up bigger. Here we go. This is what I'm talking about here. See each one of these little pixels? And here you see like dithering of dithering of a certain kind. And so, and you see it in the yellow here. It's a nice touch, isn't it? Like to me it kind of, because there is a sense that, oh, there's texture here, maybe there's kind of physical elements, but it feels inherently digital when you really go up close here. So just a kind of mysterious, beautiful work, semi abstract.
00:05:38.174 - 00:06:08.262, Speaker A: I mean, this kind of looks like a sun or moon, this kind of looks like a person. This also looks like a person within this kind of abstraction here. It's really beautiful. And. And it looks, as I was saying with RJ yesterday, and we're going to see it again today, it kind of looks familiar, but it looks completely different and original at the same time. I don't see any AI. I mean, it's tempting to think that maybe there was AI in this piece, right? But it's digital collage.
00:06:08.262 - 00:06:29.874, Speaker A: Pixels still sd materials. Digital collage by Gozo 2023. So a collage, interestingly, edition of 2500 tezos sold for ten on primaries. So I'd say, like these three in a row. I mean, look at this room in the museum. In your mind, look at how fantastic this room looks. Amazing.
00:06:29.874 - 00:06:56.304, Speaker A: Totally amazing. So that is uncertain. Gaze on Twitter. So big thank you to everybody who came out for that super interesting talk we had yesterday with Sabato and Xerox on how to make a real fake Keith haring. It was super interesting. Again, this will eventually go up on YouTube, but you can listen to it on Twitter. Just go to any of our feeds or my feed, you can find it and you can just hit play.
00:06:56.304 - 00:07:16.606, Speaker A: Recording. We did record it, and it was super interesting. Great crowd. And popple actually posted a really cool 30 minutes tutorial on about recreating old lost computer art. So it was great. JNK was there, little cakes and everyone. So just really cool.
00:07:16.606 - 00:08:03.578, Speaker A: And just some very interesting issues came up, which is just, you know, if you didn't listen and, you know, long, the summary is, I would. My takeaway is it really highlights this issue of minting and who is minting a work and what makes, you know, a work be NfT able, so to speak. You know, I was. It's sort of like the Leonardo that we saw. You know, there was the, what do they call the new Leonardo Mondo or the Mona Lisa. Also that they were Salvatore mundi, which they were turning into an NFT, the Mona Lisa. And there's something inherently, I would argue, kind of inauthentic feeling.
00:08:03.578 - 00:08:45.174, Speaker A: Like, to me, in my private way world, those are totally worthless, worthless things. They're not worth anything. Arguably, everything's worth what someone's willing to pay for it. But speaking of those, to me, it's a picture of a painting. Speaking of the Leonardoso, the Keith Haring one, because it's not minted by Keith Haring. Of course, he's passed away. It brings up this whole issue of, can the person that didn't create the work legitimately mint a work? You know, and because it's almost like the wallet address is your authentication.
00:08:45.174 - 00:09:34.268, Speaker A: Right. Like, if I look at which wallet minted a work is my way of going, okay, this is for real. And then once you start deviating from the artist, then it just feels like, you know, you give a little, and then it's like a waterfall comes out. It's like everything comes with it, and then everybody can say anything. And then I'm random company and I'm minting the Mona Lisa and I'm selling it. So all to say, I think Xerox brought up a really important point as well, that it's incumbent on, in a sense, this digital art kind of NFT community, to actually say something about it, put something on the record, because otherwise you may have Christie's come in, and then every estate is now going to try and mint work, potentially. And we even saw it with the Magritte.
00:09:34.268 - 00:10:25.594, Speaker A: They do this with prints where we saw a 2010 magritte. And it looks like it's signed and everything, but it's probably just the estate. So these estates have a lot of, you could argue, conflict of interest or motivation, financial motivation, to do this. And so I guess it's incumbent on collectors, finally, to buyer beware, you know, because as a collector myself, I don't really put the same value on a work that is not minted by the artist. And I think maybe you can do it, but I think it's pointless. I think what they're doing with the Keith Haring ultimately is pointless, in my view. You can show it, extract it from these old computers, put it in a gallery, I'd love to see it in a museum, but to mint it and try and sell it, there's something kind of.
00:10:25.594 - 00:11:00.734, Speaker A: There's something off about it. And I think that's probably what Sabato and Xerox was kind of underlying, kind of this whole issue. So Sabbato had his own visual commentary, a conceptual work, which he made, which we looked at yesterday at the beginning of the show. And he also had a comment. Since this work deals with questions of provenance and authenticity, I must vouch for my forgery. So sort of tongue in cheek here. It was a freehand illustration drawn with a mouse using d paint, four on my emulated amiga.
00:11:00.734 - 00:11:35.600, Speaker A: You'll notice Pokebelly's hair in one of the images, which can be used to date the work. So a little bit of humor here. That looks like a Renki or something. And there is the hair. So, yes, you can date the work with the hair. And there I guess is Sabato working on a Windows computer as he works in deluxe paint? So a little clue there and there you see the original that he was working from, the quote unquote original. And so anyways, it was a great discussion yesterday and let me just bring up the other photo and we can move on here.
00:11:35.600 - 00:12:11.922, Speaker A: So all is well, as Sabato did a pretty fabulous job, I might add, recreating it, forging it, so to speak. Shilly Preston was listening in. I heard pokebally, Xerox and Sabato talking about the Keith haring NFT. So I figured I would check my hard drive and see if I didn't have, if I didn't had any and see if I had any I didn't know about. You wouldn't believe it. But I never found, but I found a never seen Keith Haring Times x copy piece. Dm me Christie's so making light of this idea that it came off of Timothy Leary's computer.
00:12:11.922 - 00:12:54.354, Speaker A: So, and this was after the fact in 1994, so you can listen to all the details. So it's just kind of funny. Shilly Preston puts out a piece with x copy work, I believe, in the background here behind the Keith Haring and saying, oh look, I found this on my hard drive, making light of this whole issue of what ultimately, and nobody else said this, but what I kind of feels like a cash grab, doesn't it? And here is another commentary. Salowacki Santiago was at the Shawn Lennon at nine years old party. Here's the proof. And so again, you'll hear it in the. And here's the photo of, I don't know if this is Steve Jobs, that almost looks too young, maybe that's Sean Lennon.
00:12:54.354 - 00:13:20.170, Speaker A: And there is a Santiago photoshopped into this Mac. And there's Keith Haring. So all to say, it's a pretty interesting issue. And I think it was really great of Sabato and Xerox to bring it up. And so all to say, and for those that didn't see, like here are just some of these works that are going on auction here. They're quite beautiful. And just one final point, I would add.
00:13:20.170 - 00:13:54.520, Speaker A: You know, we appreciate pixel art now, but as Xerox was pointing out on those old crt screens that they were likely made on, as you would have seen in this picture here, according to Xerox, this stuff gets pretty blended down. Like, we think of this pixelation as a feature. But back then, and I remember this like having grown up in the eighties, it was a bug like pixelation wasn't. It was seen as, like, you know, this. You know, this like a bug, not a feature. Like, it wasn't. It was sort of seen as kind of cheap and not good.
00:13:54.520 - 00:14:24.494, Speaker A: So it would have been pretty amazing for them to appreciate pixel art. And I suspect they didn't. I suspect they didn't. That's just a theory. I suspect, as Xerox was pointing out, this was probably made on a CRT monitor where these colors were all blended together. Not this pixelation that we appreciate. And it's almost in this whole process of extracting it and getting it ready for sale, this has been, as Sabato put the right word there, revised.
00:14:24.494 - 00:15:03.434, Speaker A: And now it's kind of, like, perfect for us. We love pixel art now, now that we've kind of figured it out, this generation that grew up with video games. And as I look at everybody's pixel art, now that I start to figure it out, I go, oh, this stuff's gorgeous. Right? You know, all these beautiful pixels. But it seems to me unlikely as much of geniuses as, you know, Keith Haring and Warhol were, it seems unlikely that they were celebrating the pixels so early. It just. But who knows? I mean, those are just opinions and thoughts over here.
00:15:03.434 - 00:15:28.014, Speaker A: I brought up the Warhols two, which came up this one. And I actually thought it was quite interesting as far as the whole provenance and ownership and authentic. Who is the author of this work and everything? I love how it's signed here, too, which I think actually complicates the matter a little bit. A little bit. And this is someone here. The Warhol foundation is auctioning off the artist's computer based works. This is from May 2021.
00:15:28.014 - 00:15:45.322, Speaker A: An archivist who uncovered them is outraged. So the archivist wasn't buying it either. And here are some of those works. So, again, looks way ahead of its time. And I'll show you. Look at this banana. And we do have to give Warhol credit.
00:15:45.322 - 00:16:23.076, Speaker A: He was using the magic wand, one of my favorite tools here, the fill tool, to great effect there, we have to say, okay, there's, I would argue, part of the genius, because the randomness you're getting, that randomness that you get when you're just working with paint, and he identified it almost immediately. So we have to give, you know, that really is genius, in my opinion. But look at how brilliant this looks, this work, banana, and just how it's written. He makes it look so easy. Okay, so. And even just this stuff at the bottom, I mean, it screams Warhol. It's gorgeous.
00:16:23.076 - 00:16:51.254, Speaker A: So beautiful work. And even this flower graphic craft is the program. So again, I don't really doubt that they. I see Warhol's genius in these works. It's clear that Warhol made them. Even if the pixelation was maybe smoother, you still see the genius of the works by leaving these kind of areas here and even just going all the way to the edge a little bit here, filling the thing, doing the flower. I think the bigger issue is this NFT.
00:16:51.254 - 00:17:14.807, Speaker A: You know, we're going to sell it as nfts. I don't see. Yeah, to me, that's where we start to run into controversy, so to speak. And don't forget, we were just looking at this the other day, the Jackson Pollock first NFT collection. So this was photos of the floor. And again, we looked at the, you know, by the Jackson Pollock studio. So this is just like the drips from Pollock's floor.
00:17:14.807 - 00:18:28.076, Speaker A: And then we're going to take photos of that, and then we're going to turn them into nfts, and then we're going to raise $450,000. So I would argue the problem with is the more that this authorship business is extended beyond the actual artist or creator, I think it starts to call into question the entire NFT collecting model, I would argue, because then all of a sudden, anybody can start to mint anything who has a pretext or a rationale, just like the Mona Lisa Minters or the Salvatore Mundi people. And it starts to get kind of the whole, I'd argue, model starts to come into question. So as Xerox was pointing out, it's no small matter this idea of authorship. And Xerox, of course, who plays with these ideas of authorship is kind of the perfect person to be bringing this up, as well as Sabato. I mean, it was like the perfect panel there to discuss these things. So speaking, it's endless over here, broadcasting 24/7 clownvamp is going to be on this week's spaces on Wednesday with Runartune, with Runetune and myself, and it's gonna be great.
00:18:28.076 - 00:18:52.982, Speaker A: He's actually gonna be previewing his detective Jack series that he's gonna do with brain drops art. So, of course, clown vamp is, you know, what I call a thought leader in the space. Great AI artist, huge AI collector. We've had him on before. It's actually gonna be the first repeat guest, and I'm thrilled. And it's gonna be a ton of fun. I believe he's out of New York City and he's doing a drop with brain drops, so it's just gonna be a fun hangout talk.
00:18:52.982 - 00:19:24.926, Speaker A: AI hear what clownvamp's up to in his, I believe, his next visual novel. So that is something to check out and look forward to. Comments on yesterday's show and again, thank you for not commenting on it not being hd. We got to 720 here, so it sounds like it was good enough, but today should be hd from now on. Just again, having to prepare things for the traveling. Things got a little out of whack so quick look at the comments. Ed Marolla no ads here.
00:19:24.926 - 00:19:41.206, Speaker A: So glad to hear that. Very glad to hear that. Regarding the monetization. Eizo, that piece by Geno is amazing. A few people mentioned this. It was minted as part of the analog video union drop a bunch of us participated in. Participated in.
00:19:41.206 - 00:20:17.074, Speaker A: I suspect you'll probably love a few pieces in the collection and you'll probably be seeing them in time for tomorrow. Thanks for talking about my physicals. I often forget to post about them, so if you're trying to remember who Geno is, he did this two minute beautifully, this two minute video that we're looking at with the awesome music. Again, this could be like some trance party in the nineties. And I mean that in the best possible way to be very careful with my mic here. It's like super cool. This could be the children.
00:20:17.074 - 00:20:40.836, Speaker A: Very, very nice music here and just a cool combo. So people were digging. Gozo there was another comment in here down below, or, sorry, Geno. I mean, Gino's work is fantastic. Santiago Izakoto so yeah, Gino making some waves, continuing on. Crash stop. I have to say, this was super interesting, though.
00:20:40.836 - 00:21:10.840, Speaker A: I'm not involved in the NFT scene. I know a few of the artists involved in the glitch art part of that. And I have to say both NFT and non NFT scenes are, in art world terms, both way healthier. Interesting choice of term in content and ideas than most of what I see being put out in the old world. Gallery art scene streets ahead. Interesting comment and I don't disagree. I mean, we look at the traditional art world.
00:21:10.840 - 00:22:18.260, Speaker A: Like when I go out, you still see it, and it's always like, it's surprisingly, you're back to this pecking order sort of mentality where people have to kind of, you literally see people trying to kind of push people down psychologically to raise them up. It's very depressing. And, yeah, so, you know, this brings up a very interesting kind of subject. I've been talking with my friends when we go for walks or coffee, which is this idea that is the contemporary art world becoming less cool than it used to be? And I almost wonder, and maybe a lot of people would disagree with this as well. I also look at, you know, when I see these clubs, these clubbing videos on Instagram, I'm not as, like, I'm way more into what. Into what Gino is doing here than what I'm seeing on Instagram. Because also, I'm going, well, is this that cool? You know what I'm seeing on Instagram and the clubs? And I'm going, I'm not sure I'd like to be at that thing.
00:22:18.260 - 00:22:38.432, Speaker A: And the music is, you know, so I. You know what? Like, thank you for the comment, because maybe a lot of people feel this way. I think I feel this way. And it's just interesting, you know, you're more in the glitch side of things. Very interesting. Very interesting. Thank you for the comment.
00:22:38.432 - 00:22:51.534, Speaker A: Crash. Stop, human boy. I respect that it take. And so back to the monetization. I'm glad you guys are. Thank you for the suggestions. I'm glad you guys are interested, because I'm actually interested in, you know, doesn't hurt to crowdsource these things.
00:22:51.534 - 00:23:10.110, Speaker A: Maybe you guys have ideas. I respect the take on monetization. I assumed it was automatic when you hit 1000. Yeah. So I was kind of always striving for a thousand to turn on the monetization. But then I realized, you know, after talking to my mom, I was like, there's no ads. And it's like, again, for a dollar a video, if that.
00:23:10.110 - 00:23:31.816, Speaker A: I'm not. I don't want to put ads on this thing. I've never seen an ad on your videos, which is awesome. But if you decide to monetize, I would not blame you at all. Patreon idea could also be great. And, you know, you could always do bonus kind of content. And you know what I was almost thinking, but it might take too much of a commitment.
00:23:31.816 - 00:24:24.720, Speaker A: But it's almost like, in a sense, what we're doing here could be interpreted in some ways as a free art consultation. In a sense, this is going, hey, here's a bunch of cool artists. If you buy into whatever narrative I'm trying to say here, then you go, oh, okay, this gives me value. This is kind of getting together stuff that maybe I never saw before. I have toyed with the idea in my head for months that you could start some sort of consultancy, which is just sort of like, here are some kind of works. It does on the surface create a conflict of interest? Because then all of a sudden, and would I be able to show it here? So I haven't because I'm not even sure how that would work. But maybe just some sort of bonus content you could even talk about, maybe other things that maybe don't even have to do with digital art, NfT stuff specifically.
00:24:24.720 - 00:24:44.000, Speaker A: Not sure, but interesting idea. And thank you for the idea and the interest. And thanks for sharing on today's episode again, now that it is properly minted. And and also so the work that human boy released also watched after the space you hosted today was Xerox and Sabato. Very interesting. Now I want to forge some artworks myself. Hilarious.
00:24:44.000 - 00:25:17.342, Speaker A: Muji, who did those beautiful pixel artworks. Thanks for showcasing these pieces and for many others I decided to burn and remint ancient trapdoor as a 20 edition instead of a unique. You know, I think if you left it there, it would sell as a unique. By the way, I think it was because I mean, it was kind of a tempting looking work. And again, collectors tend to go a bit crazy if they have the money when they see those one of ones, and that one was gorgeous. So thanks for the update, and thanks for the comment, Santiago. Gino's work is fantastic.
00:25:17.342 - 00:25:42.252, Speaker A: Whose work we're just looking at here, and not a number. Great show, as always. So back to the monetization. I think I dislike ads more than most people. Me as well. But the one argument for monetizing the channel is that it gives YouTube an incentive to promote the videos. This is something I have also thought about, and it's a very important thought.
00:25:42.252 - 00:26:30.658, Speaker A: So when I looked at the monetization, there are two kinds of monetization. There's the kind where it just puts ads, and then I think there's YouTube premium monetization. So in other words, if someone watches who subscribes to YouTube and doesn't, so they don't get ads. In other words, I think maybe you get money when a YouTube premium watcher watches it, because I have thought of that. Am I hurting the distribution of the videos on YouTube by not monetizing? Because all of a sudden YouTube has no incentive to spread the videos and that kind of hurts all of us as far as the artists in here, not just me. In a sense, it's good for the artists for this to go kind of very widespread, important thought. And yeah, I've considered that as well.
00:26:30.658 - 00:26:47.050, Speaker A: So thank you for that. Not a number clean the Wookiee. Instead of YouTube monetization, you could consider offering a Patreon, perhaps. So another Patreon idea that could give us more detailed insights into your thoughts on certain works where you foresee digital art going. Just a thought. I would join 150%. Well, thank you.
00:26:47.050 - 00:27:15.368, Speaker A: So let me put my mind to that. Maybe there's something, because again, I kind of like to. You know, I am a student of Socrates and I do love how it's just sort of like it's there. It truly is democratic, even though he was a skeptic of democracy, but it is great to just not hold anything back. So. Yeah, but if there's something just kind of other but kind of related. Yeah.
00:27:15.368 - 00:27:41.984, Speaker A: So I'll put my mind to it. I'm glad to hear that there's interest out there and thank you, Jonathan. Demon, ego and edmarola, we should run through this, but thank you for the comments. So, yeah, this one's a little long to get into, and we're already 27 minutes into the show we have to run. So thank you, Jonathan, for the comment and everyone. So let's go, Dan control. Thanks as always, pokebelly.
00:27:41.984 - 00:28:19.154, Speaker A: So we're discussing this work and it's got a buddy celli kind of plant kind of feel to it. Bodicelli among many. He is a precious source of inspiration, like all from that period, Giotto, Bruegel, Jak, van Eyck and other miners. So awesome. Great to hear Gogolitis is back and taking a break from Twitter, hanging out with the kids on vacation and also talking about AI and gaming and then dropped this super cool work here. Almost has a daft punk feel to it, doesn't it? But virtual is real with a new kind of feeling. Pixel art piece.
00:28:19.154 - 00:28:40.902, Speaker A: Whenever go, go lightest comes back, it's always with this fresh sort of look. So it is worth taking breaks. And just another gorgeous work here by Gogo. So by gogolitis. So great to see gogolitis back on the scene. Just hypnotizing. So here we have more clues from RJ, a pixelated hockney work that never existed.
00:28:40.902 - 00:29:27.858, Speaker A: So I brought up a bigger splash here. So this is the David Hockney that we all know with the splash, you know, beautiful painting, very famous. And, you know, the splash, I think it's called the splash. The splash, I think it's called. Now, what's interesting about this, this is that what we're, you know, loosely calling spectral AI here or spectral pastiche. You know what's interesting? You look at the board here and then you go back and you see it's a different, you know, composition, but then you almost see the board here in the color. So you can almost see how the AI, if it's AI, and I imagine it is the AI took that piece and then made it, like, horizontal here, and you see the splash.
00:29:27.858 - 00:30:31.324, Speaker A: So again, it feels like the words that came to my mind are like, is this the uncanny valley? Where it kind of feels familiar and different. I was like, what is the uncanny valley? Let's look very quickly here. It's a concept in robotics and human robot interaction refers to the feeling of unease or discomfort that people often experience when confronted with a robot or animated character that looks and acts almost, but not exactly like a human. So it does seem to be not a bad term to use here. The term originates from the observation that as the appearance of a robot becomes more human like, our emotional response to it becomes increasingly positive and empathy until a point is reached where the resemblance is very close but not perfect. So I think we can at least loosely use. It's almost like an uncanny valley of sorts, where it's kind of familiar but different, and it feels strange, right? Just like you'd be talking to a robot, and where it starts to feel like it looks real but something's off.
00:30:31.324 - 00:31:08.520, Speaker A: At this point, the emotional response suddenly becomes strongly negative, evoking feelings of eeriness or unease. After this dip the valley, the theory suggests that if the appearance becomes completely indistinguishable from a human, the emotional response becomes positive again. So it's while you still can kind of tell that you have that. So I almost feel that it works here with imagery. And look at this. The uncanny Valley concept is not limited to robots. It can also apply to computer generated imagery, animatronics and other mediums where human like entities are depicted.
00:31:08.520 - 00:31:31.092, Speaker A: So an uncanny valley of sorts going on here feels familiar. I feel like, is this the work? But it's different. Very, very interesting work from RJ, as usual, and beautiful as always. Couple of Tez quake aid works for Morocco. So Birka Bayram with a beautiful work here. And this is the moroccan flag. It's quite beautiful.
00:31:31.092 - 00:31:50.076, Speaker A: The moroccan flag. It's red with a green star. How cool is that? So Birka Bayram putting their spin on it here and here. Kika Nikolayla highlighting beautiful work by Shili Preston. And also. And I met Kika, actually. When was it? Maybe a week and a half ago.
00:31:50.076 - 00:32:13.844, Speaker A: Or last, I don't even know. It was Tuesday, maybe on Friday or a week ago Friday, I met Kika Nikolayla. Very nice person, really. Just fun to hang out with. Had a talk over in Berlin here and, you know, tweeting out Tez quake aid. So if you want to help out, here's the address here. So go to Tezquake Aid, and this is the address you put in when you're listing the work.
00:32:13.844 - 00:32:40.868, Speaker A: And here's that work by Shilly Preston. Feeling out of place in a world where you're alone. Also for Tez quake Aid for the people of Morocco. Nice piece from Shilly Preston. Looks like AI with some mask of this person here flashing and just, you know, filling out a place in a world where you're alone. So just a beautiful work there from Shirley Preston for Tez Quake Aid, Morocco. Look at this cuompa.
00:32:40.868 - 00:33:14.120, Speaker A: Simple thoughts. Another gorgeous work here. Again, keeping the Microsoft paint UI. Interestingly, like, I didn't realize people used newer versions of Microsoft paint, because I thought, and it makes me wonder, when you think of Ratcloak and the myth, are they using newer versions of Microsoft paint or older versions? I'm not sure. So just kind of interesting, because this doesn't look like a retro tool. This just looks like a default tool that is in windows. If they still have paint, and I think they do, it looks new.
00:33:14.120 - 00:33:41.320, Speaker A: So here is just another beautiful work. And I believe there was a mythological, felt like experimenting with a different color scheme. This time was inspired by mythological stories of gods and their hunts from my culture. Feel free to share and use it as your banner. So here it is without the Ui and just a really another cool orc here. Let me just open it big so you can actually see it here. So, cwampa, look at these w's here.
00:33:41.320 - 00:34:07.682, Speaker A: And versus formulas. This is a formula. It looks like super cool when you look up close here, just like we were seeing with that work at the beginning. Gonzo. It's very important, I think, for a work to be able to look up close and it still be able to stand to hold right. It definitely gives it that sense of value. This artwork is a meme.
00:34:07.682 - 00:34:59.874, Speaker A: Uh, so another just really cool, ambitious work here by Kwampa, continuing on. And this is Naima Pacniat with a new work, and they just sold a work to Cosmo, to Medici. And so I was looking at their page, and this just came out, and we've looked at their work before, and there's volume. So again, you know, quanta, doing what we could call loosely pixel art, kind of culturally based, you know, and here it feels kind of the same way. Persian miniature, pixelated and animated using Adobe Photoshop in 200 and 220 by 220 pixels. Pixelated and animated using Photoshop. So just a really nice piece here by Naime Pacniat.
00:34:59.874 - 00:35:18.770, Speaker A: And this is buy now for 0.55 ETH. Beautiful clouds here, too. So very cool. Again, reminds me of the British Museum, which I'll have to go to in London. And here's the work, actually, that sold to Cosimo emerging collection. So here it is.
00:35:18.770 - 00:35:48.794, Speaker A: And I think we have volume on here, too. It's almost like these, I don't know, pictures of daily life here. Wherever this is from. I'm not sure what the title is here. Mountain ranch and southern tides. The series reflects five main areas in north, south, east, west and center. There's a whole series here.
00:35:48.794 - 00:36:16.126, Speaker A: Very cool. And then naomi goes in depth. And look at this. You even see the process here of it being made. And it looks like an iPad. And look at this. So that just looks fun, doesn't it, when you work that big? I mean, one of the secrets of digital art, maybe not secrets, but one of the important aspects of digital art is this ability to zoom.
00:36:16.126 - 00:36:39.784, Speaker A: One of the kind of qualities or characteristics of digital art is the ability to zoom. You can't do this, you can't zoom in with a physical canvas. And that's kind of important to note, I would argue. And look at this, you see it all in process here. So all very cool. Let's keep moving here. Stippin pixel with a couple more on Zora.
00:36:39.784 - 00:36:53.702, Speaker A: This is a mint for 0.02 ETH. Four out of five have been minted. So nice. You know, everybody's been doing the free mint, but here, now that stippin pixel has collected a whole bunch of collectors. Look at this. All of a sudden, 0.1
00:36:53.702 - 00:37:23.174, Speaker A: ETH for a work, and all of a sudden, that's like, what, $150, maybe more. $160. And it's interesting, just from the blockchain perspective, would stippin got dollar 160 on tazos? It's an interesting question. So here is the work. And I managed to make this one bigger. And here's another one twirl another cat, and this is an open edition, and 36 have been minted. And here it is up close.
00:37:23.174 - 00:37:40.842, Speaker A: So another. Just awesome work. Nice patterning, too, and kind of like the shadow space here. And quite a beautiful pattern in there, too. Just great color and everything. So Mickrenders just finally is on the front here. So big congrats to Mickrenders being at the top of Zora.
00:37:40.842 - 00:38:02.554, Speaker A: So that is awesome. And here is Ugo. So we're looking at Ugo's work with the car and the meme. I actually made it on here too, which I was thrilled to see this morning. And there is wok, so very cool here. And this horse was up at the top here all of yesterday. So more than a thousand got minted here by Ugo.
00:38:02.554 - 00:38:15.268, Speaker A: And of course, we've been looking at Ugo's work the last few days here. And Ugo put out another one. We saw the cars. And here's Ronald McDonald. Ten tezos edition of ten. There are nine left. So it's looking good over here.
00:38:15.268 - 00:38:31.108, Speaker A: So Ugo is doing well. But look at this. I mean, a thousand. This is why a lot of artists are really enjoying Zora. Get 1000 mints here and here, you know, waiting, you know, for a sale. Basically one has sold. Now, this may have just been listed here too, but nevertheless.
00:38:31.108 - 00:38:57.964, Speaker A: So. But a cool work here by Ugo, continuing on popple with a new work here. And shout out to popple, thanks for the link on yesterday's spaces to that video. And here, just another kind of poetic work here. I think we saw the preview yesterday. It has now been minted and we see it has been finished. And this kind of bird like figure here, or this woman with the bird like dressing, so to speak, her feathers.
00:38:57.964 - 00:39:19.686, Speaker A: And, you know, for lack of better it's not a costume because it's actually coming out of the arm here. Uh, it's kind of crying blood into this figure here, who looks like they are dead. And it's unclear if she had anything to do with it. Huntress of hunger wraith. So maybe she did have something to do with it. Uh, edition of 25 for 18 tezos. There are five left.
00:39:19.686 - 00:39:47.038, Speaker A: Beautiful kind of color in this as well. A shimmering pixels. Mech txt with a new one on Tezos. Edition of 20 offers are coming in at as high as 40 tezos here. And here is the work. Really nice, kind of dithered, almost like a masked flame here, or torch, let's say. And kind of a classical looking figure with a kind of a very different kind of pixelation here in the background.
00:39:47.038 - 00:40:11.222, Speaker A: Kind of a wider pixelation. We were discussing aspect ratios yesterday as well. Interestingly, these horizontal pixels are contrasting nicely with these square pixels in the center area and this little window here that you can even x out right there. Very, very, very interesting. Passionate pursuit of purpose. People keep evolving here. And here's just some beautiful color studies here.
00:40:11.222 - 00:40:39.260, Speaker A: Just a work that mech TXT. Really beautiful classical looking work here that mech TXT put together from last study for today. So barely releases any of his work here, but luckily he shows it. And here's almost the opposite color study. See here it's mostly gray with a little bit of that orange. And here it's mostly orange with like or more 50 50, shall we say so. But playing with these two colors here and with this palette.
00:40:39.260 - 00:41:07.448, Speaker A: And again, looking just really cool here from Mech TXT, who's getting a lot of followers here, it's already at 17,000. And look at this experiment also mech TXT. So really pushing things. No compass, no maps, pure wilderness. So interesting experimentation over here with mech TXT. Pushing the limit here, another work on chain with Spiegels Maskinen. So here we saw the.
00:41:07.448 - 00:41:43.498, Speaker A: And the work from the other day sold to Pablo Punkasso. So we were talking about how there really is like a collector out there on ETH that really likes these on chain works. They're kind of seen, as I'd say in certain circles, as more valuable because they're purely on the crypto. There's no external ipfs or ifbs that is required. So interesting work from Spiegels and looking great. And probably by doing all this dithering, you can keep file sizes fairly small. Look at this money here.
00:41:43.498 - 00:42:01.322, Speaker A: Just looks great. Let's keep moving. Cruise to dusk. A beautiful work by green Ginger available for fortezos here. Again, reminds me of a beach in Greece. I don't think we looked at this, but maybe this cruise ship is bringing me back here. Not sure if I've seen this in real life or if we looked at this the other day.
00:42:01.322 - 00:42:22.734, Speaker A: Anyway, beautiful work here with this dithered lighthouse light coming out. Beautiful beach and just nice looking work. Classic ratio here. Very wide angle ratio from green ginger. And there are, are there any on primary? There is one on secondary for fortezos. Nice piece. Cruise to dusk.
00:42:22.734 - 00:42:44.910, Speaker A: And another one by Annas Abdin that was posted. And this is, as you can see, the twin towers here. That of course. So this was probably released, you see, on September 11 here, as part of the anniversary. Pixel art is therapeutic for me. I feel calm as I patiently draw the pixels one by one. However, this one hits different each pixel.
00:42:44.910 - 00:43:17.358, Speaker A: I drew each window. I felt connected to the human behind every window. There are many things we need to reconsider in life, never forget. So, yeah, so a beautiful commemoration here of the World Trade center towers on September 11. I mean, if you were alive during that time, I'll never forget it, actually coming to the tv with my mum, basically looking at the tv, crying, and then me going, we just got to get to school, mom. And then in the. On the radio, in the car, on the radio to school.
00:43:17.358 - 00:43:35.478, Speaker A: The tower came down. Yeah. The demon inside us tomb and battle collaborating with dither. So another one of these great retro tvs here and there. Yeah. The skulls and UFO's. Love the stickers.
00:43:35.478 - 00:43:49.694, Speaker A: And a classic sort of bombadil figure inside the tv. Bombadil instead of Sony or Panasonic here, available for 40 tezos. That is on secondary. So this sold out. So this series doing great. Sold out at ten tezos. Looks like pretty quickly.
00:43:49.694 - 00:44:30.824, Speaker A: Within an hour, hour and 15 minutes. Nice work. Edition of 20. So cool piece there, Mayu, with a new pixel art piece. Arcade dreams in action. So kind of full circle here, as we were discussing yesterday and throughout these episodes on our show, as I like to call it, the second generation of digital art, which is artists who grew up influenced by video games. And remember at the start of this episode how I was saying, I was a little bit skeptical that I was talking about how that they appreciated pixel art, that at that time, in the eighties and even in the nineties, it was sort of seen as more of a bug than a feature.
00:44:30.824 - 00:45:05.980, Speaker A: So. And I would argue the second generation of digital artists are people who grew up with video games. This is the hypothesis. I'm not saying everybody has to agree with me, but people who grew up with video games and who. That became like an aesthetic canon, so to speak, and somewhat something to appreciate aesthetic quality that people liked. And that is now we see celebrated, you know, as pixel art here. And so, yeah, I'm a little skeptical that back in the eighties, especially with what Xerox was saying, with the CRT monitors, you know, smoothing out a lot of these things, you know, again there.
00:45:05.980 - 00:45:46.524, Speaker A: And why did they smooth them out? Because these were seen more as bugs. It wasn't a feature, it was a bug. You know, this pixelation, now we celebrate it almost in kind of a retro nostalgia. So here we're going full circle with the depiction of Mayu's skull character, skeleton character, playing video games done in a pixel art style, you know, loosely celebrating video games, both in the content and in the process. Beautiful work. 750 on secondary arcade dreams in action. Beautiful work here by Ed Morolla, who, again, the tez vending machine comes out tomorrow.
00:45:46.524 - 00:46:25.534, Speaker A: And a hilarious piece, actually kind of this demon figure here playing a flute with someone looking, you know, with their crown. It's almost like, is this Lucifer, you know, this with the crown here or something, and someone looking inside the head here. And then we see, hilariously, these beautiful stars that are kind of blinking. And then you see very lightly, a constellation here, but it's more just a dog that you would see, like sitting at home rather than, you know, a classic constellation. Beautiful clouds here, too. Just a stunning work, actually, by Ed Marolla. Nice textures.
00:46:25.534 - 00:46:53.528, Speaker A: It's crazy to think where Ed's gonna be in a year or two, you know, like, you know, that's the thing with being prolific. If you're making. The more you make stuff, and the more stuff you make, the faster you're learning, right? That's kind of the other side. That's another aspect of being prolific that should be kept in mind. The faster you're going to evolve, the more work you make, and that's important. Demon ego. Speaking of being prolific, tyrants are coming soon.
00:46:53.528 - 00:47:18.148, Speaker A: So it almost looks like a series is being put together here. We saw axin put together a kind of PFP like series. And you wonder, is demon ego up to the same thing here? So a clue, tyro. And here, this seems to be more evidence. So, looking great. Interesting piece from rustic digital art. Who comes back on the scene with some doodling here and different kinds of.
00:47:18.148 - 00:47:39.782, Speaker A: This looks almost like a sticker. Here we see some almost sampling of video game press start and just everything. Some digital painting. Viva Perrone. So interesting title, the pop artist edition of ten for five tazos. Keeping it interesting and experimental as ever. There's our cropped Mario guy, so very cool.
00:47:39.782 - 00:48:06.610, Speaker A: Igor Capustin, only eleven tazos. I mean, this on secondary here, usually this artist, like, if you go to their page here, usually their page is pretty expensive, as you'll see here. You see, actually it's getting cheaper. So actually there are opportunities here. Some people are selling off their eager capustan, so there's collectors opportunities there. Anyway, interesting new work. Reykjavik.
00:48:06.610 - 00:48:32.794, Speaker A: So I think that's a nice land. So almost looks like a winter fall type drawing here. Interesting composition, kind of like a landscape, but it's not clear. And here, a figure in the middle walking through it, also dressed in white. Interesting work here. I discovered Igor Kapustin through this guy here, Louis Osborne, through his collection. And so Louis Osborne, with a really cool new work here, defaced.
00:48:32.794 - 00:48:58.254, Speaker A: And so almost a commentary, kind of on vandalism, one could argue. That's one interpretation. I mean, that might not be Louis Osborne's take here, but you take these smiling faces and you put sad faces on it with spray paint here. So interesting. Perhaps a commentary on graffiti, one never knows. And you gotta love the brick wall. I mean, it is on posters as well here.
00:48:58.254 - 00:49:13.282, Speaker A: Interesting piece. And of course, Louis Osborne likes to go from this kind of smiling face to the sad face and everything. Cool work. Only 24 tazos still available. One on secondary. Only an edition of 30. It's actually a pretty good price.
00:49:13.282 - 00:49:33.574, Speaker A: Kappa Sage and a taste with a collaboration. Different plans. We put it on the hood before we put it on. God. So here, definitely Kappa has a huge influence on this work. And maybe detaste did some of this rougher area here. And maybe the work in the windows with the rougher brush.
00:49:33.574 - 00:49:55.446, Speaker A: And then Kappa usually with that very kind of sharp, clean digital brush. And of course, the Lacoste and everything, the Kappa figure and all hanging out here at the house. Looks like some sort of YouTube channel where they all party at the house. Edition of 15 for eight tazos. There are seven left on primary. And this was kind of hilarious. Kel won art the last pizza party.
00:49:55.446 - 00:50:22.690, Speaker A: We miss you, Gary. Gary loved pizza, accounting practices and funny ties. So a going away party for Gary. And here, just kind of making fun of the office a little bit. Pizza party. Interestingly dark yellow here. It's almost like the light making fun of the light almost in one of these meeting rooms and almost the inhumanity, these, you know, meeting rooms and offices with this artificial light, with this one flickering.
00:50:22.690 - 00:50:41.970, Speaker A: Brilliant work from Kelwon art. Three tezos edition of ten. There are ten left, so that is still available for $1.93. Get it while you can. PP universal poser in a thrasher shirt. Me do a backflip. So almost like a confrontation here on the street.
00:50:41.970 - 00:51:01.732, Speaker A: And again done in what feels like almost a collage style here by PP Universal. Just another interesting work here. Edition of five for seven tazos. And continuing on new work by Kurt Hussle Collective edition of five for 50 tezos. Green foreigner. Green foreigner. DBO Sports present.
00:51:01.732 - 00:51:20.488, Speaker A: Sumo arcade. So almost like a video game here. And we see the sumo wrestler and almost like a mortal kombat type game. Beautifully done here. Very low edition for 50 tezos each. Only $32 each at addition of five. Some cool.
00:51:20.488 - 00:51:36.408, Speaker A: This was on the front page of foundation. And it was Amber Vittoria. And I thought this was a pretty nice abstract we have here. I wonder if it's physical. This looks quite physical. So maybe this is. Wow, that would be pretty impressive if you can get all these different colors here.
00:51:36.408 - 00:51:58.244, Speaker A: I guess it depends. Is this inkjet interesting? And nice paper and nice signature there. So it looks like a physical NFT. This is for 0.9 ETH this is a 101 where the primary collector has 60 days to claim the physical nine by twelve painting on paper. So it's a painting on paper. Quite beautifully done there.
00:51:58.244 - 00:52:29.676, Speaker A: So authentic, created by and copyright Amber Vittoria. The purchase of the NFT is a purchase of the asset, not of the copyright. So again, I think we're going. I'm to actually surprised we don't see more of this, which is selling physical work on the blockchain and using basically the token. To me, this is the way to sell physical work on the blockchain. I'm not huge, and just my personal opinion, I'm not huge on, say, taking pictures of works and then saying, okay, here's my NFT. It happens all the time and there's nothing wrong with it.
00:52:29.676 - 00:53:05.424, Speaker A: If people want to do that, sell it and people want to buy it, I have zero problem with that. But the way that I would do it and that I think is an exciting way to do it is you do the picture, but you get the physical work. Like there's some sort of deal just like this. You can put the physical work on the blockchain, you buy the token and it's almost like your certificate of authenticity of a certain kind. And then you get the work in the mail or whatever happens. Another work that could hang really in the same room by caving wild maestrenza. Continuing with this very simple theme of just a few colors here.
00:53:05.424 - 00:53:34.350, Speaker A: This white, this dark gray and this dark red and the lighter gray, you know, the different grays, the white and the red. Very painterly feeling. Couple of. Often you'll see like these plus signs in there and in these abstracts that have kind of a spatial feel to them. Really interesting series available for 250 tezos. Two tezos 50 edition of 1211 left. Interesting experimental abstract here.
00:53:34.350 - 00:53:53.640, Speaker A: My canvas by guru, guru Hyena. This is available for six tezos, $0.66 tazo cents. Edition of five. And there's one left. And Datura with a new animated abstract work, dark room. And this is an edition of ten and is available for five tezos.
00:53:53.640 - 00:54:20.144, Speaker A: As we run through the rest of these here, Kotonakazono with a new work here, continuum number 150. So again, playing with this, another low res spectacular here. And playing with this pixelation, which I think is very popular here. Edition of five. It's already 27 tezos. Tuna has a couple of them on secondary, and Silva, sand twos and dragon. So another Nintendo glitch rom here.
00:54:20.144 - 00:54:43.384, Speaker A: And you see the dragon in the background and taking us almost reminiscent of that, 14 hundreds quattro cento painter with the. You know, they call it simultaneous narrative. We've discussed this before that St. Peter. We'll dig up that work for a future time. Almost has a simultaneous narrative feel to it, this work. Anyway, just.
00:54:43.384 - 00:55:09.148, Speaker A: I'll continue on here. Renki with Kudamatsu. So another animated abstract here. Keeping it interesting. Almost like a mirror device of sorts, or a dream machine of sorts. Kudamatsu station is a station on the Sanyo main line of West Japan Railway Company and Japan Freight railway located in Nishitoyo, Kuramatsu city. So maybe based on architectural work.
00:55:09.148 - 00:55:33.404, Speaker A: Not sure interesting. Is ever ten available for ten tezos each. Recano, I quite like this piece because again, Recano, kind of nailing the choice of iconography. I mean, who hasn't had their laptop with their breakfast on their kitchen table? I love it. I love it. Just very, very relatable. Shall we say, morning routine.
00:55:33.404 - 00:55:51.214, Speaker A: Beautifully put edition of five. Nice low edition. 999 tezos 90. Mika Oladef with a GlB or with a GLB file. And so interesting. Just sort of head with some tvs or screens on it. Cathode cranium edition of 25.

And playing with these kind of plasticine like skeletons here.

00:56:55.318 - 00:57:12.284, Speaker A: And it's probably edited AI based on the digital painting don't cry over spilt monster. Not sure I've seen that one. Little cakes with an AI artwork. Enduring the horror in neon. An outlier from a larger collection, but a favorite. So this is raw AI. Open edition for only one tazos.
00:57:12.284 - 00:57:29.314, Speaker A: So you can get a little cakes. AI art piece here. And continuing on, this was made with stable diffusion, actually. Interestingly. And of course, you recognize the artist here. Lily illo. So just posting AI artwork with these creepy two mouths here.

Interestingly, kind of painterly AI artwork here from Lily Illo. As we wrap up here, Sky Goodman with a one of one.
00:57:47.414 - 00:58:10.610, Speaker A: What heavenly things have found us here. Still from animated world, new Iceland. So here is a still from an animation that likely uses AI. Yeah, AI blender, of course. Sky Goodman uses several different softwares and exports. This is really cool. And here, Shilly the kid also abstracts along the same line.
00:58:10.610 - 00:58:29.784, Speaker A: This is using Runway, I think. So part of something else we're going to be seeing here, a lot of AI video. So here was just some nice work by Shirley. The kid released a few of these. Here's turmoil four, a one of one for only five tezos. And I believe they have a few of them available. This is number four.

00:58:50.064 - 00:59:02.668, Speaker A: Yeah, and there. I guess maybe that's the Christ like figure at the start there. Interesting work. Very. It's almost like the office, you know, blended with the crucifixion. 1990s video art performance. Interesting.
