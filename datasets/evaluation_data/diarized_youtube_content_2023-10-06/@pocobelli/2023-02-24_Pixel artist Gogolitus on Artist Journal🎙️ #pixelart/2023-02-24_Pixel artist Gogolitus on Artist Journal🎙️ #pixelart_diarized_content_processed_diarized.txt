00:00:00.240 - 00:00:38.002, Speaker A: On the reality simulator device. You got a brain at the center and a bunch of machines generating the reality the brain is actually experiencing. So you have different modules to handle different aspects of the simulation, generating the reality and emulating the senses. You have a screen with some code running. There is a function on the screen where the subject is wondering about the reality is in. Also, thanks to chat GPT for generating me this little piece of code. Very, very convenient, but essentially it's like the matrix or existence the movie, but without the body.
00:00:38.002 - 00:00:54.394, Speaker A: In other words, the brain is experiencing the reality in the reality simulator device and has no physical body. It only exists within the simulation and is left to wonder about the true nature of its reality. Pretty much like in the movie the Truman show.
