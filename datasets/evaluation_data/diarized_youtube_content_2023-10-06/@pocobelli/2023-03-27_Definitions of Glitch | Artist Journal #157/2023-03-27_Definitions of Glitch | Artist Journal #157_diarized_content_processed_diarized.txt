00:00:03.560 - 00:00:35.774, Speaker A: We have to go as fast as possible today just to keep it under an hour. So I'm unfurling the sails here. We're letting the wind take us as fast as possible across this sea, this sunny sea here. Artist journal, March 27, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from the ship in my mind in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back. Look at this incredible work by.
00:00:35.774 - 00:00:52.566, Speaker A: Strange thing. We have no time to waste here, ladies and gentlemen. Look at this awesome work here. This patchwork of luxury. This beautiful patchwork of luxury. This beautiful chair. I mean, this work here kind of has a little bit of a Magritte feel to it, I have to say.
00:00:52.566 - 00:01:10.842, Speaker A: Particularly. Magritte in time. Transfixed. Maybe I'll bring that up super quickly. But he loved the curtains and he loved this sort of stuff. There's a word for it that escapes me right now, but, yeah, this kind of stuff on the wall has an unconscious written all over it. Subliminal.
00:01:10.842 - 00:01:51.948, Speaker A: But let's not miss the main show here, which is this beautiful contrast of luxury and patchwork, almost because patchwork is taking, you know, things that have been thrown away, rags that have been sort of stitched together, but then combining that, you know, an old chair, but combining that with high fashion, with luxury. Louis Vuitton. So super cool. This also has a bit of a Magritte feel to it when he had those characters that you almost. When you're making a snowflake out of paper and you cut out, you fold it up, you cut it out and then you have the lattice, maybe you'd call it. That reminds me of Magritte, too, oddly enough. I'll bring up time.
00:01:51.948 - 00:02:10.544, Speaker A: Transfixed. Super quickly. I'll just show you this. Exploring luxury items and furniture concepts using artificial intelligence. So taking things in a furniture direction. Magrit, time transfixed. I just want to show you this work here.
00:02:10.544 - 00:02:30.494, Speaker A: Let's see if we can get a decent version of it. Yeah, so you see here and there, it just kind of. And maybe that's more just my imagination there, but kind of had a bit of a time. Even in the color. This isn't a great rendering of it. But anyways, an awesome work by Magritte there. So strange thing.
00:02:30.494 - 00:03:03.204, Speaker A: Has a very important message for all of us. AI won't replace jobs. Those who learn artificial intelligence will have enhanced intelligence, making them more valuable to businesses. Very true. Yeah. Continuing on, as we continue to develop AI, it will complement and augment human abilities, not replace them. And that is definitely what I see when I use chat GPT it is stunning how quickly you can put, say, like a blog post together.
00:03:03.204 - 00:04:10.128, Speaker A: Stay ahead of the curve and learn AI. And the important thing, yeah, I think the role of the editor is becoming increasingly important in the sense that exercising judgment, human judgment, and knowing when an article needs personality. Because the problem is if, say, you use chat GPT, for example, to write a blog post, it'll come out as very generic and bland. But it's not a terrible starting point where you can start to talk about, you know, put your own person into that article. And then finally, the role of the copy editor, the person that reviews a news article, for example, or something for a magazine, the person, the writer sends you their content. You don't really need copy editors anymore because you can basically put that article into chat GPT and say, fix grammar and punctuation and you get the article back and it's kind of very smooth or just improve clarity or whatever, and then you get everything back. So if you know how to use that strange thing is saying you're going to be fine, but if you don't learn it, it's like not learning how to use email in the nineties, you're going to fall behind.
00:04:10.128 - 00:04:52.836, Speaker A: So, you know, you have to learn this as strange things says, stay ahead of the curve and learn AI. A very public service announcement courtesy of strange thing. And here's just some of the other works. The patchwork, this wonderful fashion concept of taking, you know, these kind of scraps of material and then, you know, putting them together, kind of a, you might say a low, you know, quote unquote low fashion or something that's not very expensive. And then putting a designer fashion brand on top of it. A wonderful fashion concept, you know, worthy to me of like an actual fashion house. And look at how great this looks.
00:04:52.836 - 00:05:28.074, Speaker A: Again, AI created model, so another industry that is bound to be disrupted, actors and acting, one would imagine. One would imagine, but not necessarily. Maybe it's that unique human individual is what people want. And as we were saying, with chat GPT, the problem with writing that comes out of chat GPT is it's very generic and kind of lacks personality. And maybe that'll be the same thing with actors and actresses, is we actually want real people cause they have more personality. But we are just scratching the surface here. Anyways, look at this.
00:05:28.074 - 00:05:55.524, Speaker A: Gorgeous, gorgeous. The color, the color is absolutely stunning. I mean, these, this brown and this blue are, are very nice together. Again, you see this kind of low and high fashion, kind of married here. Beautiful, beautifully, you know, like just a wonderful concept. I mean, this person walking down the street, this jacket, this person, in a sense, looks so good. I would argue that it almost would get them too much attention.
00:05:55.524 - 00:06:18.730, Speaker A: That would be the biggest problem. Look at these stunningly gorgeous shoes, which I just feel like, when can we 3d print these things? And you see here, there is a tiny amount of AI distortion. Maybe you can or can't see, but it is so tiny. All the wrinkles are being rubbed out of the distortion. The AI distortion. Thank you, everybody, for making my Saturday. It was a wonderful day.
00:06:18.730 - 00:06:42.522, Speaker A: Sotheby's ad number two sold out thrillingly. And that is the second in this series. And Sotheby's is actually the topic of the day, as we're going to see here shortly. Just want to give a big shout out and thank you to all the collectors here. Made my day. And again. Yeah, and you know what I kind of like about this is this date here, 24th to the 30 march.
00:06:42.522 - 00:07:04.390, Speaker A: Like, we're still in this date, and it's kind of fun to do things in real time like that. So part of the pixel art sketchbook, and again, magnified twice. I should put that. Actually put maybe the original 375 and then put times two. Still working that stuff out here. And we have a few comments here. Just going to touch on a couple of them.
00:07:04.390 - 00:07:19.910, Speaker A: I always love the attention you give to pixel art. This is from Retro Manny. Great show again. Thank you. Pixel art, exactly. It's almost easy to forget. I keep saying this thing, like, you know, pixel art is high art because it's almost like we think of Minecraft, and it's so appealing.
00:07:19.910 - 00:07:56.474, Speaker A: It almost feels like it should be for kids. And we see it in video games, but, you know, like, there's something to be said for pixel art. And I was even thinking this sort of straightforward, kind of simple comment made me think, like, I don't really see pixel art in galleries. I don't think I've ever seen it or in a museum. And it's not to say it doesn't exist, but it's not, like, commonplace. So anyways, I appreciate that comment, because it really did make me think of how that might not be that usual. Also, from human boy, Yaoa's works are physical, I believe, made of plasticine.
00:07:56.474 - 00:08:27.078, Speaker A: So that is interesting. We're going to see another work by Yaowa today at the end of the show. So for those that were wondering, we weren't sure if it was AI or plasticine. So according to human boy, it is plasticine. So that is super cool. And I can't go through everything here, but there's another one that I had to hit because that was the title of the last episode. Arturo Chomchin AI reverse engineering it's called textual inversion.
00:08:27.078 - 00:08:59.414, Speaker A: We're discussing if you could get the prompt from the image. You show the AI the image and then can you get the prompt from the image? According to Arturo, it's called textual inversion. And yes, there are a lot of different scripts that do that. It's an inherent part of AI that cannot be separated from prompting. The machine needs to learn in both ways, which actually makes a lot of sense. So it sounds like the machine needs to do that in order to probably evolve. Example, if you want to create a new data set, you absolutely need to write a prompt for each image.
00:08:59.414 - 00:09:20.264, Speaker A: Generally, you will use a textual inversion script and eventually review the text. So thank you for that. And finally, Edmarola. Yes, music was my main job before nfts. I was working doing sound design and audio branding. So I am not surprised at all because that music is awesome. So thank you, everybody, for the comments.
00:09:20.264 - 00:10:08.178, Speaker A: Unknown collector so the market, apparently, I mean, I always feel like I'm the last person to figure these things out. Apparently the market is dipping a little bit. I mean, we did see it, as we're going to see in our next post. We did see that with doodles and moonbirds, PFP projects, profile picture projects, which have taken a pretty significant drop down. It seems like a lot of those kind of what I almost tempted to call like, mainstream NFT projects are taking a hit right now and that, you know, remember Grant Rivigne's like triangle and putting pfps at the top, generative works in the middle, and then one of one art at the bottom of this triangle where the money kind of flows to. If I understood that graph properly, unknown collector good morning, GM. We heard this phrase for months.
00:10:08.178 - 00:10:38.594, Speaker A: Who is here for the art? I feel now we are about to find it out. As sales are the slowest ever, morale is low, and more and more artists are very unsatisfied. I haven't seen any of this, but I'm sure it's probably true. I wish everyone a lot of patience and hopefully you will get through this. I will stay here if you need moral support. I mean, I almost have to laugh, you know, because I've been in the Berlin arts scene and nobody makes sales. There are people, you know, you can go years without making sales.
00:10:38.594 - 00:11:07.988, Speaker A: So, yeah, I guess we're gonna find out who's here for the ark because, yeah, if. Yeah, better times will come, and I won't abandon the space at its lowest. Like, yeah, like, if this is as bad as it gets, like, again, we're in the promised land over here. Like, again, like, I know people who maybe in a three years, maybe they make one $1,000 sale. I've been there, you know, like. And, yeah, like, but they. They're still there.
00:11:07.988 - 00:11:37.784, Speaker A: They still show up because that's what they have to do. So all to say, yeah, we'll survive. And people are still selling, as we're going to see here. So, interesting comment, because I think it does help illuminate what's going on in the market there. And this also helps from purple drank, also known as drank for zeta public service announcement, PSA, yuga, punk studles. All these big cat projects don't really. Don't matter, really, and in my opinion, will be irrelevant soon.
00:11:37.784 - 00:12:17.116, Speaker A: So a provocative statement from purple drank. What matters is you buy the art you enjoy because it's aesthetically pleasing to you, so you might enjoy looking at it. It's also great moves to support artists you believe in. Too many hype driven copies and shit, art projects sucking the money out of the space. So interesting. So again, kind of a bearishness here, shall we say, on the kind of top of the triangle there of these PFP projects. I mean, I think Yuga Labs, who does the bored ape yacht club and cryptopunks, I think they're still hanging in there pretty well.
00:12:17.116 - 00:12:42.856, Speaker A: But doodles has gone. It's at three. I mean, we could check really quickly. Opensea, let's take a look at doodles quickly. I mean, how are they doing here? They're still at 3.3. So there's kind of, you know, we looked at this last time, but as you can see, it's going down. So let's see if it holds, because this may affect the art ecosystem.
00:12:42.856 - 00:13:12.996, Speaker A: Okay, human boy again, sometimes I really feel like I goofed minting so much work before anyone was really collecting my art. Now I am sitting on a lot of unsold, untouched works, wondering where to go from here, but I am still creating as well and have much more to share. It's a conundrum. Yeah. So I've been there. I think a lot of people have been there, and most people who, when you're new to the space and nobody knows who you are, that's basically what happens. Because most people, like, 90% of the time, what's going to happen is nobody's going to collect your art because nobody knows who you are on and on.
00:13:12.996 - 00:13:36.914, Speaker A: So then you can end up sitting on a lot of art. So what a lot of people do, what I did is I actually burnt a lot of it. So if you have additions of 25, maybe you reduce them to additions of five. And then you don't need to list everything. You can just list one on the market. You don't even need to, you know, there is one thing that I had ten copies of. I burnt down to one of one, and then I just decided, oh, I think I want to keep that.
00:13:36.914 - 00:14:09.580, Speaker A: I don't want to sell that for ten tezos or whatever it was. To me, it's worth way more than that. So I'd rather just keep that. So, yeah, there's all sorts of things you can do. You can lower the prices, but, you know, if there are already two tezos, I haven't looked human, boy, but there's all sorts of things you can do. And I wouldn't burn everything, like, unless you want to get rid of a work. But I mean, you know, again, if you have too much supply, there's easy solutions for that, you know, again, if you have 25 that are unsold or one sold, maybe burn 20, that's one thing you can do.
00:14:09.580 - 00:14:34.454, Speaker A: I mean, now I kind of wish I hadn't done that because a lot of those works probably would have, I'm sure would have sold for the five tezos and would have made a lot, lot a of. Of money. But at the same time, I'm not money. So sad about it either, because now I have kind of these nice, you know, you know, low editions. And that's kind of funner in some respects from a collectability point of view. So anyways, there's lots of ways to adjust for that. Francois Gamma was scammed.
00:14:34.454 - 00:14:55.310, Speaker A: Scam alert. I have been hacked by meta w 1935 world. So another scam. We had Dan control, we had another one. A Twitter user with a deleted account made me download an app. So never, ever, ever do this. To see their project on this web with the result of losing all my ETH and Tez funds from my wallet.
00:14:55.310 - 00:15:09.634, Speaker A: I think I'm not the only one who has fallen into this trap. Yeah. So be very paranoid on any link that's sent to you. Like, I basically. I think I only click on links from people I know. And even then, I'm. I'm pretty.
00:15:09.634 - 00:15:34.714, Speaker A: Yeah, I'm pretty reserved on that sort of stuff. You have to really just be incredibly paranoid. So Francois Gamma, you know, these are people who have been in the space for a couple of years at least, right? So it can happen to anybody. Rosatio still exhibited at the theater of digital art, Dubai. It's like a secret room. It's in a secret room exhibition. How cool is that? I guess it's not so secret if the room is huge like that.
00:15:34.714 - 00:16:04.966, Speaker A: Thank you. Project 22 Art and two dad XP, a comedy of an expensive error, will be listed on foundation. Cool title, rosettio. And look at how incredible that looks. More evidence in my mind that the way to display digital art is on a projector. And sometimes you can't, like, there are technical reasons why we can't always do this, but to me, it's very clear that this is the ideal way of showing digital artwork. I mean, you see it here and it looks spectacular.
00:16:04.966 - 00:16:35.514, Speaker A: Again, the alchemy of scale. Like, when you make these things big and digital can go big, they look stunning. I mean, look at this. You're enveloped in the work, you know, like, I mean, what else is like that? It's like Michelangelo's last judgment. It covers a massive wall, you know, and it looks incredible. Right? So anyways, so this was the talk of the weekend on Twitter. I didn't catch all of it, but I'll tell as much as I figured out here natively.
00:16:35.514 - 00:17:30.634, Speaker A: Digital glitchism. So I did see this because Oxene had a work in here and early on was posting it. Where is Oxene's work here? Here it is. And I was like, oh, cool, euxine work. And let's see what's going on at Sotheby's. And so, yeah, so, I mean, what I thought when I first saw this was how much of this is, you know, there's different definitions of glitch, as I learned in our Twitter spaces where Sabato was sharing this super interesting talking about glitch theory and how the glitch is generally traditionally defined as a work that uses technology that's been disrupted, say, like a JPEG file, where maybe you change the code of the JPEG, and then it turns out, and it's kind of screwed up, that would be a glitch. So kind of disrupting a disruption of a certain kind of technology.
00:17:30.634 - 00:18:10.444, Speaker A: But as Sabato was pointing out, this definition has been expanded to include anything, at least in his opinion. He had a much more inclusive definition with anything that basically has a glitch like characteristic. It's all kind of been, you know, he has a much kind of wider definition, from what I understand, because, see this work by OSF here, maybe we can click on that. So that's the first thing. And then we'll get to the really the main issue here. We'll see if this loads, because this is just a flashing light. And so one might say, yeah, maybe it's not going to load.
00:18:10.444 - 00:18:28.998, Speaker A: So is this glitch, is that a disruption of technology? No. So not in the traditional kind of narrower definition, but in the more inclusive. You could say, look, this has glitch characteristics. It's flashing. It's kind of glitching around a little bit. So anyways, so that was the first thing I thought. And then also this is.
00:18:28.998 - 00:19:01.040, Speaker A: It's basically all dudes. It's all men, from what I understand. I mean, it's not totally clear to me, though. Like, I mean, one thing in this space I actually kind of like about this space is the anonymity, because I don't really think about it, frankly, because I just look at the art. Maybe that's what this person was doing, but the mistake. Yeah, but they. They're on Sotheby's here, and they have to take a step back and go, are these all men? There's no female representation, in other words.
00:19:01.040 - 00:19:37.524, Speaker A: So that become. Became also an issue. So they kind of, you know, and they're put it this way, this work here by Patrick Amadon, and he's the person that actually led the charge by saying, as we'll see in his tweet here, that he didn't want the work to be shown. So, first of all, this is what we might call a traditional glitch work. Amadon's first glitch, physical painting from 2013, which also stood out to me. The digital glitch effect was achieved solely through the manipulation of code in the Microsoft default application wordpad exe. So this is what you might call traditional glitch.
00:19:37.524 - 00:19:58.472, Speaker A: A technology is disrupting a file. Okay, now, so that's the first thing. So here we have a traditional glitch work, we might say. And this is another thing that stood out to me, though. Minted. This was made in 2013 and minted in 2023. So, minted in 2023.
00:19:58.472 - 00:21:05.762, Speaker A: And we had this whole discussion about minting older works, right? And how are they less collectible? It seems to be fine over here. And that kind of opens up a whole world in my world. So anyways, here's a static glitch. So they're all kind of combined. But there was a sense that maybe there wasn't enough of a hat tip or an inclusion also of what you might call traditional or glitch artists that have been around for a while, and then it's going out because it's Sotheby's. It gets a lot of attention. And then, yeah, so it felt like to me, what happened here was basically, you probably had an unexperienced or under, you know, curator who put this all together and who kind of maybe didn't know enough about glitch in its more traditional area or didn't think of putting more representation in that area and then also screwing up the representation by making it all men, which these days, I mean, it's like if you were to put a public company together like a.
00:21:05.762 - 00:21:46.400, Speaker A: And the board of directors is all, you know, men that just. Yeah, that doesn't fly today. And so anyways, so that happened, and there was a huge amount of pushback, deservedly, and I. Yeah, so Patrick Amadon led the charge. Here I am pulling my work from the Sotheby's sale. While I believe it was a genuine oversight and the team means well, and you know what? I really applaud this kind of understanding tone, shall we say, because in writing things, you know, things can really devolve, as we all know, in writing. So I think it's really great to say, look, I think these people have good intentions.
00:21:46.400 - 00:22:27.486, Speaker A: Genuine oversight and the team means, well, that is my impression as well. It's just, you know, because it's not in their interest, really to do this. The lack of representation, while I believe it was a genuine oversight and the team means, well, the lack of representation is a serious issue, and we need to address it in our space. Female identifying artists have played a major role in the glitch movement. So, yeah, so anyways, so, pulled the work from the sale, and again, a lot of you might know this whole saga much better than I do. I'm just trying to cover it for people like my mom who might be watching, might not know any of this was happening. Sotheby's metaverse here.
00:22:27.486 - 00:22:59.934, Speaker A: So Sotheby's then came out this morning and said formally, we are pausing it. Sotheby's is pausing natively. Digital glitchism to redress the imbalance in representation within the sale and will relaunch with a more equitable and diverse group of artists at a later date. So they backpedaled to their credit. Right. And let's just see what else they say. We remain committed to working closely with the community to ensure sales are artist driven and represent the breadth of digital artists.
00:22:59.934 - 00:23:40.510, Speaker A: We appreciate the community for raising this concern and to the artists in the sale. Sounds like they, yeah, like they're more than, they sound like they're more than happy to backpedal on this. And thank you for supporting this decision. In tandem with the Sail relaunching, we will also host an exhibition in a panel event at Sotheby's New York during NFT New York City dedicated to the new curation and providing a platform for underrepresented communities of glitch artists who are active in the NFT space. More information on new sales dates and artist lineups to come. This decision will be reflected on Sotheby's dot soon, and we'll be in touch with current bidders shortly. Regarding next steps, our DM's are open.
00:23:40.510 - 00:24:21.934, Speaker A: I mean, in terms of response, I don't know if you can ask for much more than this. I mean, they're completely backpedaling. They're going to fix all the wrongs and then they're going to have a panel at Sotheby's New York or, sorry, during NFT New York City dedicated to the new curation. I mean, so to Sotheby's metaverse credit, they seem to be wanting to fix it, eager to fix it, which is why, again, I think it's just probably an inexperienced curator who is, I think I was reading it was maybe some 26 year old guy was the cur. I'm not positive on that. That was my impression. And so again, just inexperienced.
00:24:21.934 - 00:25:05.012, Speaker A: Sotheby's pauses so this was out and out in the media. Sotheby's pauses NFT auction after glitch artists withdraws over lack of female artists. So, Patrick Amadon? Patrick Amadon yeah. So this actually made a lot of waves and, yeah, and just so there you have it. And here's some reaction. So, Sky Goodman, maybe today was the reckoning we finally needed for people to finally understand that glitch art has been in existence way before the crypto space and has trans roots and has existed long before x copy gained popularity here. I've been trying to tell you all this is a common refrain that we often hear about digital art in general, say, with generative art as well.
00:25:05.012 - 00:25:47.704, Speaker A: There is a sense sometimes from people who have been doing digital art for a while that the crypto space does not recognize what's happened before. Crypto, basically art that's digital, that hasn't been minted. So Sky Goodman is calling attention to that here. And there was just a sense of the way they titled that show. There was a sense that it was maybe a little cryptocentric for the term calling it like a glitch exhibition. The auction at Sotheby's is pausing until another notice will relaunch with equitable form. I would like to state that we as artists are in contact with each other to make sure that everything is progressing as it should.
00:25:47.704 - 00:26:29.534, Speaker A: And it was nice to see that no one had second thoughts about how things should work, at least exactly. I'm actually impressed at how the whole community actually, generally speaking, has been dealing with this. With Patrick Amadon's tweet, with Sotheby, Metaverse's tweet, with Uksin's tweet also pointing out, like, hey, these people are working to fix the situation. We couldn't finish this without Sabato. Of course, the whole purpose of art curation is to place works in conversation with each other. And anyone with an ear for dialogue can tell you the difference points of views makes for better conversations. Curation is a celebration of difference.
00:26:29.534 - 00:27:07.114, Speaker A: Glitch art has been around for almost 50 years, undergoing waves of contribution from artists from around the world. There is no such thing as a singular glitch art movement with protagonists. That is really interesting, isn't it? There's no such thing as a singular glitch art movement with protagonists. That is very interesting, as always from Sabato. It's an ongoing conversation that changes with technology and time. There's obviously a great glitch art scene that's native to web3 that carries on the glitch ethos. And here he's giving a nod to, basically, I'd say X copy, maybe Axeen.
00:27:07.114 - 00:27:36.814, Speaker A: There's a great glitch art scene that's native to web3 that carries on a glitch ethos with creative, copyright free works and punk aesthetics. And there are also great glitch artists here that come from other scenes. All of our works deserve to be in conversation with each other. So I think, fairly diplomatic. Again, I'm kind of impressed with the tone of a lot of what I'm seeing out there. Some of it's kind of brutal, but overall, I think. I think it's just.
00:27:36.814 - 00:28:04.372, Speaker A: Yeah, I think it's really nice. And I think he's right. And there could be. I mean, I'll tell you what I thought. I was like, where's Sabato? When I was looking at that? Even Sky Goodman, you know, when I was looking at the Sotheby's page, I mean, you're gonna have a glitch thing with crypto artists even. And then, like, where's Sabato? So anyways, finally, Sean Capone. Just a reminder.
00:28:04.372 - 00:28:19.442, Speaker A: Auction houses aren't galleries or museums, so this is a bit more of a harsher take. They aren't places where artists have ever gone for critical validation. Not positive on that. To establish primary markets. I'm not positive on that. To build careers and convene with collectors. I don't know.
00:28:19.442 - 00:28:39.050, Speaker A: I know a guy who almost his claim to fame as he sells at Christie's and Sotheby's as a painter or rely on the scholarship for scholarship and preservation they have. They're. I don't know. I've watched videos on YouTube where they seem to be pretty. They seem to have scholars in there. But I'm not positive on that. They don't do this work.
00:28:39.050 - 00:29:07.874, Speaker A: I'm not positive. But let's continue because I think there's another point that's being made, which is why I'm highlighting this. Auction houses like Sotheby's do not work with artists. They are not sensitive to artists concerns. The fact that they keep making these boneheaded moves is basic proof of that. They're in one business only to hype and broker the sale of things that people will pay lots of money for. And I wouldn't be as kind of black or white about it, but at the end of the day, I think this point does hold, which is they're in the business of making money.
00:29:07.874 - 00:29:25.744, Speaker A: And if there was no money in, say, crypto art, I'm not sure that they would be excited to show, put on shows like this. Like, I think that point is true. There's money to be made here. Okay. And. But, yeah, so, anyways, I. Yeah, there's a.
00:29:25.744 - 00:29:48.334, Speaker A: I think, again, my theory is inexperienced curator. And finally, Haiti rocket, yo. Glitchart. Right. So I'd say calling attention to this whole tension between what we might call the narrow traditional definition and the more inclusive definition of glitch art. So beautifully highlighted by Haiti Rocket edition of 13. Let's just see.
00:29:48.334 - 00:30:27.464, Speaker A: Sold for 13 each on primary. And there's John Cates, who is. I think he's. I'm not sure if he's a glitch theorist, but he's an artist who's been around the glitch scene for at least ten years because we saw that video that I think Sabato retweeted with him talking about glitch art in 2011. So, anyways, so you see everything here, back to AI Carlos Marcial. But it kind of leads to this idea of unrepresented groups. NFTs allowed artists from Latin America, like myself, to tap into a global art market without moving to New York or London.
00:30:27.464 - 00:31:07.970, Speaker A: Amen. And absolutely, AI will allow builders, developers and entrepreneurs from all over the global south to build amazing new technology without moving to the Bay Area. So, calling attention to how AI, I mean, really, it's kind of like back to that pandemic idea where you move out of the city. I mean, it's totally possible these days with technology. Yeah. And if you're as productive as strange thing with your AI, you could probably work for all sorts of people. So anyways, very interesting, and I totally agree, Clio.
00:31:07.970 - 00:31:52.682, Speaker A: So again, playing with AI here and almost in the physical world, coloring AI works. Being an artist means you never grow too old to dust off the crayolas and create something amazing. Being an AI artist means I can skip the pens and get straight in. And get straight in. So I guess the next natural question is, who fancies shading in between the lines with me today? So here are some works from Cleo. And so it's almost hard to tell, like, I assume this was printed out, but it's almost hard to tell what's going on here, what's real. You can tell the shoes have been made with AI, but I'm not quite clear, and I assume that the colors have been colored.
00:31:52.682 - 00:32:20.942, Speaker A: I'm not sure, though, with actually this whole thing looks like AI, because look at the pencil. So I thought this was an example of physical work, but these are probably all AI works. So the plot thickens here, because I was getting into, because look at this awesome stencil. Beautiful stencil by Matthias la plata. End of experiment number one, no mint. What do you think? Pretty cool, Matthias. A nice stencil here.
00:32:20.942 - 00:32:46.746, Speaker A: So beautifully done, you know, and I think, just look, you see the cutter here? So cutting out the paper here. Beautifully detailed. Really nice work from Matthias La Plata in the physical world. And also, he's back. He's working on his next work here, which I think is going to drop today. Sweet home la plata. And here is more details from Matias la plata.
00:32:46.746 - 00:33:13.908, Speaker A: Tomorrow, new drop, matthias la plata, eterno pixel soup. Ten editions. Stay active. It's one of those grails you cannot have. So anyways, I'm sure more physical work here this time from Rinnefish, who is back. And here you see this work here, which is moving, probably a gif, someone on a tomato on their phone, rendered in static form in the physical world. So very cool here.
00:33:13.908 - 00:33:33.694, Speaker A: Guess selfine tomato is having fun in the nature. Enjoy your weekends, friends. So very cool. Now some digital art at last, donkey boy. Some folks inherent star spangled eyes. So hasdrubal w, also known as hasdrubal waffle. And this looks like some sort of perhaps crack pipe here.
00:33:33.694 - 00:34:05.682, Speaker A: Smoke, crack, rock the vote. So more mayhem. Beautifully done. More gorgeous mayhem here. This beautiful, you know, up here where these kind of wide pixels come through, gorgeous textures here. You see the light behind the smoke here, the eyes, the different application of text, the looseness, the messiness. Again, a very painterly application here of digital art TLDR.
00:34:05.682 - 00:34:26.957, Speaker A: And then just these great textures, probably all made within, like Mario paint or whatever the program is. So very, very cool work. Let's just see what happened to that very quickly. Auction sold for $12.34 to Ahec. Shout out to ahec. Another one sent to Ahec.
00:34:26.957 - 00:34:40.341, Speaker A: And then one to Santiago. And there it is. So beautiful work here. Hasdrubal waffle yarbals. So another one with some music notation in it. Same gorgeous textures, differently done. Maybe even a different software.
00:34:40.341 - 00:35:10.550, Speaker A: Again, Hasdrubal waffle likes to use kids programs and to massive effect here. So just gorgeous, gorgeous work here. Yarbles and kind of more humorous work here. Wyeth, study number one. Study of the study for barracoon by Andrew Wyeth, featuring sigmoidoscope GM. So kind of a more humorous work here. But again, you get these incredible textures here along this frame.
00:35:10.550 - 00:35:33.794, Speaker A: The treatment of the body and everything. I mean, just amazing. Just amazing, you know? And here is what looks like a different program. Why study number two? So, featuring Arlen Maltby as the bartender. So anyways, all sorts of humor going on here. Kind of funny. So anyways, just gorgeous work.
00:35:33.794 - 00:35:51.470, Speaker A: Zoom in. Raw steak oats. So this is rustic digital arts with what looks like a play on a cereal box. And we're going to have to run through the this episode here. But someone eating some characters here from what looks like Super Mario Oat based cereal. So anyways, just very cool work. This is a 101.
00:35:51.470 - 00:36:22.164, Speaker A: It went for 70 tesos. Ego, demon Ego has a new work, some windows you don't want to open. So again, playing with this new series here, and it's really cool and just all sorts of mayhem here. So there it is. I mean, just playing with this new series, basically with, you know, as you can see here, like windows from an operating system and all sorts of textures. Very cool series. Undefined disorders.
00:36:22.164 - 00:36:48.234, Speaker A: And a work from Santiago. And this is only two frames, but it looks like more. But it's two frames. And basically this is a really interesting concept of taking an abstract or any kind of work and then processing it differently, which we can do with digital. I mean, there's a thousand different ways you can process an image. And here it's being processed one way where we see more pixelation. Then you just show one, show the other.
00:36:48.234 - 00:37:08.822, Speaker A: And there is your work. Very cool. Seed for the end of the world edition of 23 are left eight tezos kapn with another work. Roadless travel. Kind of a mystical feeling work, as Kapn likes to do here. And a star on top. 2468 pointed star, interestingly.
00:37:08.822 - 00:37:25.142, Speaker A: And just some very nice textures here. Beautiful work from Kappen. An open edition. Open for another 11 hours only. Twelve minted 333 price. A beautiful work by Ed Morolla on foundation Dagger 0.2 e.
00:37:25.142 - 00:37:43.806, Speaker A: Let's make it bigger. So this movement and everything is kind of coming together here. The evolution continues. I've been seeing a lot of skeletons. I'm not sure why in Ed and other people's work. I'm not sure if there's a thing going around to do skeletons. But anyways, there's a sword in any way.
00:37:43.806 - 00:37:57.394, Speaker A: It's just. I mean, totally unique artwork here. And what looks like a chalice in the foreground here. Reserve of 0.2. Minted yesterday. And here's more work. Horned demon crying.
00:37:57.394 - 00:38:21.774, Speaker A: And this also kind of playing with the trails and the ancient themes. This almost looks like a skeleton that you'd find in Tanzania, in Olduvai Gorge, where they found Lucy, I believe. And almost like rock painting or, you know, cave painting type stuff on top. Interesting textures. Just really beautiful. Interesting work. From edition of 30.
00:38:21.774 - 00:38:34.274, Speaker A: Price of ten tezos. 28 left. Picnic. So we have some music here. Picnic two. It was supposed to be a picnic camping trip, but the forest was on fire. So let's play the music here.
00:38:34.274 - 00:39:08.286, Speaker A: There we go. Some experimentation here, dramatizing our scene in this ko e kan camp 2023. And this goes for a minute 23. And these beautiful textures here. So again, we're just seeing the depth here of this whole scene. I mean, hasdrubal waffle, Ed Marola Santiago. Sunday at the skull park.
00:39:08.286 - 00:39:24.354, Speaker A: Here's another work. So these look like more skeletons. So skeletons are in the air. We see some of these sampled brushes with a gradient. Very interesting perspective. Almost like video game perspective here at that 45 degree angle. One of one for 200 tazos.
00:39:24.354 - 00:39:39.534, Speaker A: So that is available. I thought this was interesting, too. So he just posted a work in progress. You see the color is slightly different. This is lighter. And this is darker. What I also kind of, like, just on a, like, reptilian level was this palette on the side.
00:39:39.534 - 00:40:01.472, Speaker A: I almost want to take the palette and put it in. Take this palette here, and I almost want to put it in the work beside it or something. It just looked really good. So I was like, oh, let's show that too. And finally, Ed, doing, as we learned last episode, you know, make this kind of abstraction and then just add eyes and it's no longer abstract. And there he is doing it. Stare.
00:40:01.472 - 00:40:21.022, Speaker A: Really nice piece here, too. Edition of five for 30 tezos. Someone was commenting, I love how you make it full screen, you know, so that is cool. Speaking of which, compusafi. No self. So kind of another mystical type of work. Pixel artwork.
00:40:21.022 - 00:40:52.718, Speaker A: I think it's pixel art. Maybe it's generative art. You probably need code. And it almost looks like a cylinder that's turning here. So a little bit of AWP art, you might even say, look at this stunning piece of pixel art. Annas Abdin, wishing you a pleasant day, pixel art. And this is a really beautiful contrast here, because we see the yellow sun rays here coming in onto the water, and then the super sharp, like pixels here in these yellow dithered pixels that show up.
00:40:52.718 - 00:41:05.874, Speaker A: This is a stunning piece. And look at how well it did. 146,000 views. So, yeah, pixel art. Yeah. And even signed here. Just very, very, very cool.
00:41:05.874 - 00:41:23.974, Speaker A: Let's see if this loads up. Otherwise we will move on. This is super cool. Glad it did. Black cat adventure. So check this out. This is almost a play on Mario Brothers, I assume, but it's a cat.
00:41:23.974 - 00:41:55.776, Speaker A: So how weird and cool is that? I just think that's super cool form function. So keeping it going to the end, because they're going to shut down, as far as I understand, in four days. So this is. I'm not sure when it was minted. Okay, it was minted way back when, so I must have just saw this on Twitter, but super cool. Miyagi. So here's another cool pixel artwork, Sylvie.
00:41:55.776 - 00:42:21.628, Speaker A: Pixel with almost a 20,000 leagues under the sea type submarine here, made out of tide boxes or a tide cont. This is like a tide container on its side. Laundry container, and then turned into a submarine. I mean, this is hilarious. Then a little light, super cool. Silvipixel tomorrow on Nifty gateway, which is probably today already. That was yesterday, so you can get that on Nifty gateway.
00:42:21.628 - 00:42:53.182, Speaker A: Atomic motor, Tom Bombadil. So, interesting piece as ever. Keeping a new composition and new ideas driving down the road with rain and windshield wipers and that's what looks like a stick shift gear. Anyways, always super interesting and even a dispatch sort of walkie talkie type thing. This sold out on primary at how much? Five tezos so pretty reasonable. Quick 110 tezos for tamba battle. Very cool.
00:42:53.182 - 00:43:17.342, Speaker A: Gulchikutr, an artist I'd never seen before. The red and the flames. So just stuff on fire here with a red filter, or not filter, but just a red hue. Burning my personal stuff. So interesting. And I think I brought up Guilchier Couture's page here. I love pixel art, but there's something I love even more burning everything.
00:43:17.342 - 00:43:45.574, Speaker A: So that is the theme here. You see the basketball net on fire, the chair, the tv, and even coffee making and go Golitis. This was interesting. I'd never seen or heard of Dan Kelly before. Thank you, Dan Anthony Kelly I have one of my sons who would like to do like his dad. He wants to create things and so he started to play with aseprite. But to open his imagination about the process, I showed him your work as an example.
00:43:45.574 - 00:44:18.392, Speaker A: And then so here's the work. Just sent this ten year anniversary gift for draw a dog Tuesday. To all the fans of the series, thank you to everyone who enjoys and supports this project. So maybe it's been around for a while. And thank you NFT biker for the tools to make this airdrop so simple. I've actually never used NFT biker's tools, but this really makes me want to use it because probably what you can do is just select all people who have collected your work, hit go, and it probably sends your work as a gift, an airdrop to collectors, I'm assuming. So I'm going to have to load that up because that just sounds like too much fun.
00:44:18.392 - 00:45:11.918, Speaker A: I'm way overdue for doing that. So edition 230 and available for ten tezos. So just kind of interesting and fun from Dan Anthony Kelly Flora Marquez with a cool drawing as usual. And I think, yeah, this is called remember so interesting, kind of enigmatic title here with the bird and almost as if the person used to be a bird and has been reincarnated or something. That's what makes me think of maybe you think of something else. Remember March 24, 2023 notable Pepe's so this is by I believe, although it's not clear, I believe alien queen made this because this is totally in her style. And so Pepe, WTF? I went to the page and I didn't see the work actually.
00:45:11.918 - 00:45:29.990, Speaker A: But I think you can find it. Anyway, I thought just a nice painting to share from the notable Pepe series. And here's another one. Quilanina with another. Calling the rain with another mystical work. This is done in procreate. So this is digital because we know Quilanina does a lot of physical work, which we've also looked at.
00:45:29.990 - 00:46:02.624, Speaker A: And anyway, it's kind of an interesting use of this looks like lightning here, perhaps, but where is it? A mountain here. So not clear, but interesting work, isn't it? And maybe this is just a big mountain. So anyways, praying, was it? Calling the rain. 5000 by 5000 pixels for nine tazos on secondary Mikey Wilson. If you're going through hell, keep going. I really like the direction Mikey Wilson's going with his artwork. It's feeling more painterly.
00:46:02.624 - 00:46:19.020, Speaker A: It's kind of. It's more mysterious. You have these great figures. A lot of good things are happening here. Very interesting work from Mikey Wilson. So bad vibes in the air, but we keep moving. So very interesting work.
00:46:19.020 - 00:46:37.092, Speaker A: Rare with. I think this is a commission. So a very cool work here with the dog on the chair off. I think it's called. I think this is a commission for a collector. So it makes you wonder if this is the work that that collector had bought already. So, yeah, anyways, that is the humor.
00:46:37.092 - 00:46:56.172, Speaker A: I like the humor in rare's work. Unusual work from GM. Balance. Sorry, from Bezaya called balance. And we see GM in the background here. Order chaos for de culture. And so anyway, it's kind of a mysterious work from Bezaya, but just kind of interesting.
00:46:56.172 - 00:47:25.480, Speaker A: And this is a work from an artist who was sent to me, rogue sincerity, as the artist, kind of has a bit of an airbrush feeling to it, or even spray paint or something. Maybe airbrush in the work here. And all these ancient references say, to like, almost greek vase here and. But with modern and ancient iconography, like a UFO or a dinosaur here. So anyways. And a skateboard on top. Interesting series this is.
00:47:25.480 - 00:47:47.450, Speaker A: Already. There's a bid for it for point one. So things are moving still, as we've seen throughout this episode. But you wonder maybe the big priced works. We'll have to look at the super rare bot and also maybe Aegor shout out to agor if he wants to put together the numbers. I'd be happy to highlight that here. See, there's almost a ancient kinda.
00:47:47.450 - 00:48:14.942, Speaker A: I think you'd say that's Persian, the winged gods sort of thing. So anyways, interesting work. The benevolence of a cruel deity from rogue sincerity. Recano with almost a spagels Basquinen sort of thing. New company PCs. So anyways, cool kind of playing with the retro monitors here. And there is another one buy for 50.
00:48:14.942 - 00:48:29.614, Speaker A: So this sold out on primary. I think it was pretty cheap. Two tezos. And here are some more with yachts driving through computers. Almost plays with that tide submarine that we're looking at here. Plays with that theme. Computer navigation.
00:48:29.614 - 00:48:45.474, Speaker A: So there you go. This is gorgeous. Koda Nakazono does it again. Look at how beautiful this is. Yeah. First of all, this gradient in the background. Stunning colors with this pink that goes to orange.
00:48:45.474 - 00:49:19.786, Speaker A: Then putting one of the most beautiful kind of things is semi opaque white over top. Beautiful big chunky pixels. Then this pearl like organic biomorphic form here and even in the background here. And then just straight black over here with this green, you know, paperclip type form. Stunning work from Koda Nakazono for 1240 available on secondary. What this sell for? For five only. So this sold out right away here.
00:49:19.786 - 00:49:39.770, Speaker A: So anyways, super nice work. And here's a couple more. Continuum number 85. So very nice. And continuum number 86 almost has dribble waffle type colors. And that really interesting kind of soft spray here. Anyways, very interesting work from Koda.
00:49:39.770 - 00:49:59.424, Speaker A: And eitso is back with more lawn furniture. Could have used a chair like this yesterday at the barbecue. And just a nice outdoor furniture piece of furniture. And future patio chair number two. Buy for five tazos available. And a one of one at auction for 50. Future patio chair number three.
00:49:59.424 - 00:50:24.926, Speaker A: So more outdoor furniture in celebration of spring from Eizo. Continue on doctor version with a cool pyramid scene number eleven. So again, playing with a lot of hardware, I believe, and just playing with the pyramid as a way of. To experiment. So anyways, cool work available for five. Sold out. And LB with a super cool work.
00:50:24.926 - 00:50:49.412, Speaker A: Raw VHS distortion CRT rescanned in 24 frames per second. In a sense, like, if I was doing the Sothebys, you know, wouldn't you love to just put some lb up there? I would put ballet dancer, I think it's called. I'd put one of those up there. But I mean, that's tezos. I don't know if these are on. I don't know if the sotheby show was ethereum or tezos. It actually wasn't clear, at least not to me.
00:50:49.412 - 00:51:24.396, Speaker A: Here's a work by Elie Lowe and let's see if we can get that going. Kind of humorous work here. Original recipe. So there you have it. So another interesting work trash bag. FGE number 56 by Elie Lowe. Skye Goodman spring fashion line for the crying poet number one.
00:51:24.396 - 00:51:53.584, Speaker A: Seems like they're working on a slightly different aesthetic here, which is super interesting, isn't it? Edgy. Very edgy. So anyways, cool colors and everything. Shot in rural Finland. Aikix collab with post processes and analog glitch textures made from vintage video hardware. Super interesting images of the week spring over artificial memory. So here's a dynamic version of what we've been looking at these last few weeks here.
00:51:53.584 - 00:52:15.014, Speaker A: So that is an interesting experiment here with these gorgeous, you know, again, kind of Rauschenberg esque compositions in the background. Available for ten tezos edition of four. Three left. So, still available. Santiago with an AI work, I believe. Yes, the art party. Calm my rage and I can say, and can to say hi and hug your pets.
00:52:15.014 - 00:52:38.958, Speaker A: So, interesting work from Santiago. AI work with some repetitions in there. And I like camellia's burn. So flowers burning here. Number one, available for only one tezos here. So flowers burning. Interesting subject matter from ilay AI flowers and continuing.
00:52:38.958 - 00:52:54.154, Speaker A: Look at these works by tuques. Just really stunning works. I found a few of them. Just super interesting. Just had to highlight these. Tuks is continuing. Tuques is really growing too.
00:52:54.154 - 00:53:09.890, Speaker A: Like 22,000 followers. Like doing really well. You see 35 retweets, like Tuks is really doing well. 8000 views. That is impressive. Marina Amadova with a new work. Everlasting feminine composition number nine.
00:53:09.890 - 00:53:28.156, Speaker A: So a beautiful raw AI work with that interesting almost matte palette here. Color palette and almost flowers. They look like flowers. Everlasting feminine composition number nine. Kind of half abstract. And this is interesting too. Henri, new week, new opportunities.
00:53:28.156 - 00:53:56.376, Speaker A: Unmented biogen. So looks like super high res. This looks like mid journey five. I think this is AI. So again, more impressive kind of biological imagery, kind of along the lines that we're seeing with Santiago, but completely different. Here we go with Sabato continuing his Autopia, I think, is how we say it. We'll look in a second.
00:53:56.376 - 00:54:17.156, Speaker A: So again, more experiments with AI. Mid journey five, I do believe. And here we have the figures with the wings and everything. It's almost like Camp Creme. It's almost like Sabato just kept going. Autotopia is the name of the series. You carry the weight of the sublime.
00:54:17.156 - 00:54:40.544, Speaker A: Generative AI photography documenting humans and their cars. Created with mid journey v five and edited with gigapixel and Photoshop. So keeping things very interesting. Let's just see. Just minted, not for sale la Melange social. Another autotopia work where every showroom is a party room. So Sabato continues to have fun over here.
00:54:40.544 - 00:55:06.194, Speaker A: And anyway, cool work. Let's see how it did. Minted, not for sale yet. This is by, I believe, Anna Dart. The world is yours. So again, it looks like more just really stunning AI work. Probably mid journey and just, you know, novel imagery, novel color combinations and super kind of high definition.
00:55:06.194 - 00:55:39.090, Speaker A: Interesting. You look at the hands though, the distortions are still there, the AI distortions in the hands there. So they do remain. And also Ana Dart, this is another super high res work. Most favorite. Why settle for a boring AI assistant when you can look at one with a bold blue hair and striking red lips? So again, what looks like super high res mid journey work, I'm guessing also Evelyn Zero two and this sold. And this came out.
