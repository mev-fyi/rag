00:00:03.280 - 00:00:53.920, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody, and thank you for all of the comments on yesterday's show. I feel like it hit a nerve, touched a nerve for many of us, I think, out here over in NFT land. Artist Journal, September 5, 2023, broadcasting from the courtroom of the imagination in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and I welcome you back. Before we get into our trial of sorts, let's look at this beautiful new work from San Diego. There were two works, and I didn't know which to choose. But, you know, it's kind of a superficial reason that I went with this one, and it was because it really fit the screen nicely here.
00:00:53.920 - 00:01:22.084, Speaker A: So I thought, well, for starting, this would probably be a better choice. But they're both beautiful. This is very recognizable as Santiago's style, but it does feel qualitatively different. It feels quite different. And I wonder if it's because everything has been reduced in size in terms of the size of the brush marks, let's say, in relation to the. To canvas. It is.
00:01:22.084 - 00:02:20.924, Speaker A: Interestingly enough, ive made the comparison many times with Pollock, a kind of digital pollocry going on here with Santiagos work. And as these kind of digital drips, I want to say detritus drips, as they get smaller, they kind of approximate more and more the scale of a pollock. So this digital polokry that is going on here, let's just take a look at the market here. So the edition of 15, a ginormous file, 13,000 pixels by 10,000 pixels, standing in a tower made of thin air that shows holograms of alt timelines where we found a fruit sticker that saved the night, and may I say, not in a shy way, PNG art made with inkscape. So only one software on this one. Uh, there's something about it. I'm not sure if it's the ability, if it's because it's breathing.
00:02:20.924 - 00:03:00.094, Speaker A: Uh, so, you know, and it kind of brings me back to this earlier topic we were having that, you know, we're discussing prolificness. And the more art you make, the more kind of interesting work is going to start dripping out just as a result. The more things you try, the more successes you're going to have. It's statistical. Right. And to me, this is another example, as Santiago just keeps releasing the work regularly. And I think the market loved it because only at three tezos, so very cheap, and it was gone within, basically looks like 6 hours here.
00:03:00.094 - 00:03:15.574, Speaker A: And there is Sabato right at the start. Eyelay, scomra, and more so very cool. Just beautiful work. Let me show you the other one. And this is a one of one. I love that other work. I may like this one even more.
00:03:15.574 - 00:03:53.734, Speaker A: Again, it's just so interesting how things drip out or how the productivity cycle, shall we call it, for lack of better term of an artist, how you work, you work, you work, and all of a sudden a couple of masterpieces drip out. We saw that with pamela CerOne, if I'm pronouncing that right. We saw that with pamelo's work where all of a sudden, nice, nice, nice. Boom. Very special works all of a sudden came out two in a row yesterday. So we kind of see a similar thing at work. So it just, you know, fits and starts, right? Wrong shape of time.
00:03:53.734 - 00:04:19.014, Speaker A: A beautiful title, the wrong shape of time. So I believe AI may be involved with these incredibly poetic titles. And look at this beautiful, beautiful work. And you got to love the shape of the canvas. Only 27 tezos now at auction. There are maybe like 6 hours left on this one bid, so 5 hours to go. So kind of a unique opportunity.
00:04:19.014 - 00:04:46.442, Speaker A: I mean, 27 tezos must be like $20 right now. So very beautiful work from Santiago coming up tomorrow. I am thrilled to welcome Sider. A lot of people know cider's work in this scene and who watch this show. I'm thrilled. Just such an interesting artist and I believe started recently a world on foundation. So there's going to be a ton to talk about tomorrow.
00:04:46.442 - 00:05:19.858, Speaker A: That is at 09:30 a.m. New York time, eastern time and 330 in Berlin here. So sider will join runetun and myself and it should be a great discussion. So check that out. It is in the tweet thread. Also, very quickly, a big thank you to the collects here from magician, magician, stars, flowers and forest. And I think actually this was someone and shinshin art vault actually picked up the last two here.
00:05:19.858 - 00:05:32.322, Speaker A: Picked up these two. Yeah. So thank you. As we run low, I think we've sold out of actually the eight bit nature series. At least Forest has sold out officially here. Shin Shin art got the last one. Put it in the vault.
00:05:32.322 - 00:06:02.634, Speaker A: Many thanks. It's great to sell those. So, on to the topic of the moment, lest we delay any further here. So let's get into it. Of course, for those that didn't see last show, you almost should watch if you're to follow this show a little bit. But if you haven't a quick summary, there is this issue that is happening primarily on Tezos. Interestingly, as my screen, let me just we don't have a ton of time today, and we have a lot to do.
00:06:02.634 - 00:06:44.012, Speaker A: So there is an issue on Tezos where the people are, say, taking an addition of ten collectors, and they're taking nine, buying all of them, and then sending them off to a burn wallet. Burning them. And then to make them an addition of one for this, you know, and I don't use the term in any way, in a negative way, for this fetishism of the one of one. And I share it as a collector myself. So in order to create a one of one destroy, although that'll become an issue of contention. Burn. We'll use the correct terminology here, burn them.
00:06:44.012 - 00:07:23.466, Speaker A: And then they are sent to a special wallet that basically no one has access to. And so they can't be kind of used, so to speak, they are taken off the market. And again, if anybody disagrees with this summary, feel free to leave a comment. There are many comments here, so let's get through the reaction I was pointing out. And just finally, I was pointing out the legal issues that may be concerned or that may arise or may relate to doing that. You know, taking an artwork and then kind of make. Taking it off the market like that without talking to the artist, could potentially create legal problems for you, is what I'm saying.
00:07:23.466 - 00:07:53.134, Speaker A: Maybe not now, maybe in the future, who knows? But I'm just saying there could be liabilities, is what I was bringing up. And there's a lot of pushback on that, as we'll see. And so let's get into it here. PP universal. I also think that the move of buying all the NFTs of a ten edition and burning them, then nine for transforming it into a one of one, is totally valid. So PP Universal says this is a okay with me, so no problem. Totally valid.
00:07:53.134 - 00:08:02.314, Speaker A: Bernardo Peske. Oh, Pomelo. Hi, Adrian. Pomelo over here. That's literally my first musical creation ever. Thanks for the kind words. I watch the journal every day.
00:08:02.314 - 00:08:26.892, Speaker A: Well, thank you, Pomelo. And you're putting out spectacular work. The music was also excellent. I am thrilled with, like, I'm very excited, put it that way, by the work you're putting out, people universal again, I'm okay with people that buy my artwork and burn. And thanks for the watch, by the way. I'm okay with people buying my artwork and burning it. I think they can do whatever they want once it's purchased.
00:08:26.892 - 00:09:10.086, Speaker A: Once they purchase it legally, I prefer they burn it than list it for lower price than they bought it. Okay, so PP is definitely okay with the burn and putting it out publicly. So in terms of the liability one, if a collector is buying Peepi's work, could say, well, look, this person has publicly put out here that they're okay with the burns. So, you know, that may protect a collector of, say, Peepi's work that decides to do that. Mick renders historicalive so the account who didn't actually do anything on that Kuhei piece, but historicalive is totally guilty of doing that burn without. So there was no burn on that piece. But there may have been others.
00:09:10.086 - 00:09:34.810, Speaker A: I don't know if it was the first time it looked like that was the intent. And actually intent is something we should come back to. I think it's really bad behavior. These fake one of one should be called out by the community. And it does bring up an interesting question. And I don't want to put the cart before the horse here, but it did bring up an interesting question for me. Well, let's continue here.
00:09:34.810 - 00:10:04.714, Speaker A: Let's continue because there's a lot to get through here. I called them out on that recently. It's more of a cash grab move people do than genuinely wanting to have just a singular work in existence. Otherwise they won't immediately list the remaining one after burning all of them. So this is something I haven't noticed. And it does show an intent. And intent is important in the court of the imagination here as well as in the real one.
00:10:04.714 - 00:10:27.370, Speaker A: Just as if you accidentally kill someone. Manslaughter is quite a different charge from premeditative murder. Right? So intent is actually very important. So perhaps there is intent being shown here. I think. Remember we were talking about commercial gain or private financial gain yesterday. So it would.
00:10:27.370 - 00:10:57.082, Speaker A: If this is true, it would show a motive of private financial gain. That is quite clear. That being said, technically, it's your work to do with as you please after buying it, but it seems to disobey the spirit of it, if not the letter of the law. And I totally agree. And there is going to be ambiguity regarding Vara. Many people are pushing back and say the visual arts, is it rights act? We'll look at the details in a second here. That this Vara federal law legislation doesn't apply to digital.
00:10:57.082 - 00:11:17.044, Speaker A: And we even have a lawyer. But let's not put the cart before the horse. Let's keep going here. And we got a response. And yeah, so clean. The Wookiee actually replied to McRenders here, who was basically a green. And then McRender said, yeah, and they're trying to equate me buying two of a friend's work to flip one and collect the other to what they're doing.
00:11:17.044 - 00:11:47.910, Speaker A: And yeah, we'll see this. I believe in a later comment. And it is quite different. Speculating on a work and buying two works is quite different than sending it. You'd argue to the burn wallet, where you could argue it's irretrievable, and where the edition count actually goes down on the website. It's two different things completely. And I completely agree with MC renders on this point, and a majority of my artist friends are happy to see the secondary movement and that their friends are making money.
00:11:47.910 - 00:12:26.164, Speaker A: Kuei, in this instance, has his royalties set high for a reason, and he's okay with collectors flipping his work, as am I. But if someone wanted a one of one, well, it's kind of an interesting point too, because I think, let's say it sold for four tezos and McRenders buys it for one, and then there's a 25% royalty. Well, Kuhei gets another tezos, but if someone wanted a one of one, they could reach out for a commission. There are better ways to do it than ruin an artist's plan. And yeah, I think it's, at minimum, it's a courtesy that you should ask. At maximum, it's more than a courtesy, and there could be a liability. There's going to be a lot of disagreement with that.
00:12:26.164 - 00:12:56.064, Speaker A: And finally, clean the Wookiee. There are times I think I see a work and think, damn, this is so good. I really wish it could have been a singular piece, and I think a lot of people have thought that way. And again, I was telling you how, like months ago I was looking at this Turkarak edition of three. Nobody wanted to touch it with a ten foot pole, and I had that temptation. But, you know, but one thing's to think about it and then you, you know, and other things to cross that line, but that's completely for the artist to decide and. Exactly.
00:12:56.064 - 00:13:27.602, Speaker A: And were it to be done, you have to contact the artist, I would think, from just on a purely moral ground. I wonder if artists and collectors rights agreements would be valuable to consider for many of these platforms, akin to what feralphile has done with the artists and their works featured there. So very interesting. And Sekisa, I did not imagine my randomly put together gallery would bring that much attention and praise. Thanks for featuring. So that is hilarious. That on Cyber gallery, which I thought was actually probably the most exciting on cyber, I think I've seen Savato Visconti.
00:13:27.602 - 00:13:53.256, Speaker A: So also weighing in on Vara Hey, Poco. Great show as usual. Thank you. I love the discussion about sweeping and burning editions. I didn't know about Vara, but personally, I'm skeptical that it would be legally covering burning NFT editions, if only because the NFT would be considered a security of the artwork and not the artwork in and of itself. A powerful point. A powerful point.
00:13:53.256 - 00:14:16.872, Speaker A: A kind of wrapper of sorts. For me, as long as it's a good faith collector, I wouldn't be against the sweeping and burning down to a one of one. It's like someone buying a row of seats to a concert just so they don't have to sit next to anyone. It's certainly a debatable maneuver, but that's why artists should keep at least one edition for themselves. And I think this is the takeaway here. This is a huge takeaway. Always keep one for yourself.
00:14:16.872 - 00:14:46.060, Speaker A: If you're making an addition, it immediately forces collectors who want a one of one to negotiate directly with you. Never underestimate the artist proofs. So, and again, referring to that, keeping one for yourself as an artist proof, this is an important term which we should come back to in another. It's basically, you know, keeping one for yourself, your proof. It's generally, if you're making, say, an addition of screen prints, it's the one where you say, okay, this is good to go. Here is my artist's proof. This is the official what it should look like.
00:14:46.060 - 00:15:19.936, Speaker A: And then I do my edition of 25. Sometimes artists put, like, five artist proofs. So all to say, whatever we might think of the burning, some positive, some negative, I do agree profoundly with this idea that always keep one for yourself, and that will actually inoculate you against this great episode, or at least from all of them being kind of taken over and someone getting that one of one, keep one for yourself. Great episode. Very interesting discussion, human boy. Thank you. Interesting.
00:15:19.936 - 00:15:39.290, Speaker A: Elliott Smith. Interesting reasoning about burning. And if I burn my own work, am I right? It's hard to imagine a punishment for this now. Yeah. So there's two things I would say about this. If you burn your work, it's your work, you know, and whether it's the. The artwork, if we're going to say it's the artwork, Sabato disagrees with that.
00:15:39.290 - 00:16:08.476, Speaker A: Well, it's your work. You have the right. And if it's the security, I would argue that's kind of like, well, that's part of your business enterprise. I would argue. Again, feel free to disagree. But if I'm creating these little securities out there on every art piece as being a security, then if they're my securities that I've created, then I think I have the right to burn them. But I think it brings up an issue.
00:16:08.476 - 00:16:47.604, Speaker A: It's quite complicated business here. If someone else takes one of my securities and then they start to damage it, and you could say, oh, well, maybe it's not burnt, maybe it's not destroyed. But I would argue as permanently taking it off the market inherently damages the business. If we're going to call it a security, if we're going to take Sabato's line of thinking. So there is that. And then there's also, you know, we're going to see this idea later on here that, oh, well, burning is just, we're not destroying anything. We're just sending it to another wallet where nobody has access to.
00:16:47.604 - 00:17:28.271, Speaker A: And then I go, okay. And then there's even talk. And I'm not sure if we have these tweets, but there's even talk like, oh, there should be a museum of works that have been sent to burn wallets. And then it calls into question the entire edition model, because when an artist burns, like, if they have an edition of 15 and they're not selling, and they, I've done this, you know, when I start on an object and then I go, okay, I'm going to reduce the supply, make an addition of three or of two or of one. Make it a one of one. I send it, I burn it, and then I send it to a wallet. Burn wallet.
00:17:28.271 - 00:18:22.824, Speaker A: And to me, those are, from a business perspective, those are destroyed. And even from the website perspective on object, it'll reduce the edition size to one. So if someone buys that as a one of one, are we going to start saying, well, actually, it's not a one of one because there are these other ones in the wallet because these securities also exist. And so, so it gets very murky because almost everybody at one time or another burns some work. And so if those are all of a sudden going to be, like, given to museums and be considered legitimate works or, like, given to museums, and it's like, okay, we have a burn museum, then it starts to get quite, quite confusing. And I would argue, actually calls into question the whole collector model that exists. I would argue.
00:18:22.824 - 00:19:07.444, Speaker A: So let's just continue on here. We have a ton to get through. Thanks again from Peepee, Phoebe's fashion. I'm not going to buy an artwork that has such a burning event in their history. And so this is another thing. Because of the history and because of the sketchiness, one could argue, I would argue, of doing this without asking the artist, of, say, burning nine editions without asking the artist. Again, is this creating a kind of damage to the business of the artist? And you could argue, okay, so the artworks aren't being destroyed, but are you actually damaging the artist's business is a whole other liability, I would argue.
00:19:07.444 - 00:19:32.054, Speaker A: And finally, online walk is a Rogerin's work. So I don't remember exactly which one that was. Thank you, Toravoa. But if you remember, that is by Rogerin. So continuing on, and let me just see. So here we have an example. So for those that don't know, I want to bring this up as an example.
00:19:32.054 - 00:20:29.500, Speaker A: This is basically the process. So Elna Frederick has an addition of ten at 50 tezos. Each lists them, and then a collector, Eli trader buys all of them, 2468, or buys ten, ends up buying ten and burning nine, and then sends the one to their other account, Bijou. So Elna Frederick, and this is all done within basically, you know, four minutes, and then it's listed at 423, and then at 434, all of them are bought and giving the collector, sorry, the artist actually a significant amount of money, which is a whole other issue. But they're all bought up, and then nine are burnt, and then the last one is transferred to their one of one special wallet. So this is the nature of the issue for those that don't know. So let's get in a little bit deeper.
00:20:29.500 - 00:21:07.834, Speaker A: And there's a ton of brilliant art that was released in the last 24 hours, but we do have to kind of tie the bow on this as much as possible. There was a ton of commentary and interest. Pokebally raises some interesting questions in his latest artist journal. I'm curious if the Visual Arts Rights act could ever be used to protect digital artworks. That is coming from collectors burning NFT editions. Tagging my fav legal scholar on these matters, Brian Fry. And so Brian Fry is skeptical of this idea that Vara would be applied to digital artworks.
00:21:07.834 - 00:21:50.164, Speaker A: I'm a little skeptical Vara ever really does should provide an enforceable integrity. Right? Because Vara rights are explicitly subject to section 107, fair use. So long as the destruction is expressive, it ought to be protected under fair use speech. So interesting. I mean, remember we saw this during the 2021 bull market where I think it was eliotrades, the youtuber. YouTube account. I think they bought a Banksy and then they nft it, and then they destroyed the physical as a way of saying, now the NFT is the art.
00:21:50.164 - 00:22:21.870, Speaker A: Perhaps in that case, I think you could say maybe it's, you know, an expressive use, kind of a free speech. But I'm not sure I agree with just this idea of what we just saw. The example I just provided with Ellie Trader, Eli Trader, where it's sort of like, clearly they're buying everything unless they contacted the artist. But if they didn't contact the artist, they're buying everything, destroying it. That's not free speech. That's not what's going on here. And we're back to intent now.
00:22:21.870 - 00:22:45.604, Speaker A: Brian Fry is a big lawyer. Let's keep listening to what they have to say. And I'm not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice. Of course, on a textureless reading of Vera, I'm skeptical it actually does anything at all. I'm also skeptical that burning nfts destroy them, at least with respect to legal ownership. So. And of course, historic alive, who was the account from yesterday, had a ton of tweets.
00:22:45.604 - 00:23:03.284, Speaker A: Well, that's just the information I was looking for. Thank you very much for sharing it. I will read it carefully tomorrow. I think Pokebelly should read it so he doesn't speak so quickly in his videos. Good exercise for everyone in this space. Yeah, well, I'm gonna do whatever I want in my videos. So, you know, I don't.
00:23:03.284 - 00:23:27.700, Speaker A: I'm more than. I have a living, breathing conversation here. Pretty much live, improvised. And I will happily keep doing that. And I don't claim to have a, you know, monopoly on the truth here. Okay, so just so you know. And so anything else here, it's very interesting and defines just the idea I thought about creating digital museums in burning.
00:23:27.700 - 00:23:51.974, Speaker A: Yeah. And so here we are. It's very interesting. So this whole idea of what we just saw in that image that I showed you of the burning, buying everything and burning it, it's very interesting and defines just the idea. I thought about creating digital museums and burning directions. However, it doesn't define the implications of the misname burning process. I would like to go deeper into that aspect.
00:23:51.974 - 00:24:49.970, Speaker A: So again, and we're kind of back to intent, when an artist burns their work, they are assuming that they're in effect, destroying the work that. So technically speaking, I do agree that it goes into a wallet that in a sense, you know, as we're going to see in another comment, the artwork is not technically destroyed, but something is. It was being taken off the market unilaterally without the permission of the artist. And I think that's where the liability continues to be. So the lawyer is saying, you know, my favorite legal scholar, Brian Fry, is saying Vara doesn't apply. I did ask chat GPT four, and I was actually, you know, I was like, oh, well, maybe, you know, he's a lawyer. Does Vara federal law apply to digital art? As of my last update in September 2021, the Visual Arts Rights Act.
00:24:49.970 - 00:26:07.146, Speaker A: Vara is a us federal law that provides certain protections to the moral rights of visual artists. Specifically, Vara grants visual artists the rights to claim authorship of their work, to prevent the use of their name and association with any distorted, mutilated, or modified work that would harm their honor or reputation, and to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, intentional, you know, intent or modification of their work. Additionally, in some cases, artists have the right to prevent any intentional or grossly negligent destruction of a work of recognized stature. Vara's protections are specifically applicable to works of visual art, which are defined in the law to paintings, drawings, prints, sculptures, still photographic images produced for exhibition purposes. These definitions might seem to focus on traditional forms of visual art, but they don't explicitly exclude digital art. So you see, there is room for interpretation here. The extent to which Vara applies to digital art depends largely on how courts interpret and apply the laws definitions.
00:26:07.146 - 00:27:06.626, Speaker A: So it's actually, and I kind of agree with chat GBT, I think, when just because a painting is made on an iPad or a drawing is made on an iPad, or prints are made, you know, digitally, the spirit of this law includes, I would argue, digital art. The spirit of this is exactly. It's almost like this kind of law, I could imagine, was created from collectors in the physical art market that were maybe buying additions up and burning them or doing things with art that they really didn't have the right to do. So they felt the need to make a federal law, and we can talk about jurisdiction in a second here, to prevent this kind of unilateral behavior against, you know, with. With people's creations, their unique creations, or their low edition creations. That is the spirit of the law. So it's quite interesting.
00:27:06.626 - 00:27:39.748, Speaker A: According to Chatshapet, it actually disagrees. They don't explicitly exclude digital art. So here are the key issues. Finally, the key issues with applying Vara to digital art are whether digital art can be considered a work of visual art as defined by Vara. This is the key issue, isn't it, how the rights against distortion or modification apply in the context of digital art, which is inherently modifiable. How the right against destruction applies to digital art. Given that digital files can be duplicated, backed up, or modified without destroying the original.
00:27:39.748 - 00:28:54.444, Speaker A: So I think chat GPT four has actually nailed the issues that are at work here, because there's this ambiguity with, well, are they destroyed if they can be duplicated and copied infinitely? So let me so finally here, let's actually finish this. There have been debates and discussion about expanding or revising Vara to better address the complexities of digital art and emerging art forms. You know, what this tells me is we're not the first people to be having this conversation here. As with many legal issues, the applicability of Vara to digital art would likely be determined on a case by case basis until there's a clear legal precedent or legislative amendment to Vara that directly addresses the issue. I mean, you could almost imagine a kind of Supreme Court situation here. If you're dealing with a situation involving digital art in Vara, or if you have questions about how Vara might apply to a specific work of digital art, you should consult with an attorney who has expertise in art law. So I just agree, just from a spirit of the law and just general principle perspective, I wouldn't assume that you have zero liabilities here.
00:28:54.444 - 00:29:18.706, Speaker A: That is my take. Strange thing. Great show. Again, I recently came to understand this more so it could help provide some more context. Burning an NFT on the blockchain doesn't truly destroy the underlying data. When an NFT is burned, it typically means the ownership rights associated with it are relinquished or transferred to a specific burn address. This action is recorded on the blockchain, but the data data itself isn't erased.
00:29:18.706 - 00:29:52.294, Speaker A: So bringing up that very issue in, .3 the blockchain's immutability ensures that the record of the burn remains even if the NFT contents are no longer accessible through traditional means. This is a crucial distinction between physical art and digital nfts, and this is why I want to bring this up. Strange thing is pointing out the difference between physical art and digital nfts. And this is where arguably a lot of the confusion lies and ambiguity. NFT burning affects ownership. The underlying data still exists on the blockchain, so.
00:29:52.294 - 00:30:44.934, Speaker A: Exactly. And back to Sabato's point, it's like the artwork itself still exists out there. It's not like we'll never be able to access that artwork again. But I'd argue from a commercial point of view, I think it's unambiguous that there is damage that is being done to the artist, and that, frankly, just out of principle, permission should be asked, and that if you're not, I would argue you're still, you know, entering into liable territory. NFT burning affects ownership. The underlying data still exists on the blockchain, making it difficult to prove that the work has been truly destroyed. Compared to the physical world where the Vera law applies to tangible assets, I think object and other marketplaces hosting additions should implement the option for artists to choose mints per wallet or linked addresses to ensure it's fair on both artists and collectors.
00:30:44.934 - 00:31:55.106, Speaker A: And this is also why I want to mention this point here, because to me this is largely an object problem, a Tezos problem, because the art is so cheap. We don't see a ton of this going on on the other blockchains if ever. Probably happens here and there. I'm sure there are one of ones on ethics. I was seeing other comments, and this is just a fragment of all the commentary yesterday, so I couldn't show everything already we're 30 minutes into this program, but I did want to give it a fair shake here because I did open a kind of can of worms here. So I totally agree that this is exactly what object and other marketplaces, but specifically, I think the urgency is on object to actually implement this as soon as possible because I think because of the cheapness of the works, the cheapness to buy the works, this is something that needs to be addressed. Diane Drubate, who actually I met this weekend, I went to Kika Nicolayla.
00:31:55.106 - 00:32:30.754, Speaker A: I mentioned on Twitter on a comment that I made that she's going to be speaking at expanded art in Berlin. So I actually went and actually met Diane Drube, who actually put out a whole thread. And a lot of the territory that we've gone through was already discussed on Diane Drube's feed here. After 75 tweets shared in a week past. Here's a summary of the main insights and ideas on burning NFT editions in the NFT art community. And again, right, so this is, we saw that post here. And let's very quickly go through this.
00:32:30.754 - 00:32:58.684, Speaker A: Arguments arguing against collectors burning NFTs respect artist intent and consent. Arguments against arguing against collectors. So respect the artist intent and consent. Consider financial impact and royalties. And again, this is where a liability, I would argue, exists. Preserve art as some view NFTs establish community norms, communication is key. Arguments in favor of collectors burning NFTs support collectors freedom.
00:32:58.684 - 00:33:32.104, Speaker A: Right? I guess the idea that if you buy something, you should be able to do what you want with it. But art is different. Like, I can't just buy a Picasso and burn it, as far as I understand, and not have any legal consequences. It's, you know, like see it as a form of collaboration. So now burning the NFTs is a form of collaboration? I saw that argument as well on Twitter yesterday, which is kind of rich if you ask me, but that's just my opinion. Nobody else has to agree with me. Believe it can boost secondary market.
00:33:32.104 - 00:34:02.482, Speaker A: Yeah. So ultimately by buying everything, this is better for the secondary. That's debatable too. Embrace decentralization, adopt to open so right and open markets do. Let's have maximum freedom, right? Solutions proposed empowering artists set addition limits to prevent bulk buying. So as strange thing was pointing out restrict wallets to curb excessive purchases. As strange thing was pointing out artists define collection intentions.
00:34:02.482 - 00:34:33.380, Speaker A: And I would add to this, what I love is Sabato's idea, which is just keep one for yourself and you're never going to have this problem. Solutions proposed building a resilient art market smart contracts for scarcity control introduce an allow list for art market resilience. Various list types for community needs solutions communication is key. Collector agreements for artist rights. So this is interesting. So kind of locking down the legal side of things. Host open forums for artist collector dialogue.
00:34:33.380 - 00:35:10.096, Speaker A: That's actually a really good idea. Like if you're going to buy on this platform, for instance, you have kind of terms. Host open forums for artist collector dialogue, privacy concerns with know your customer disgust. And it's true, we do have a lot of anonymous wallets, which probably doesn't help the issue. And I don't think that means that anonymous anonymity should be gotten rid of. It's very strong arguments for it, particularly for people that are in countries where, you know, it's not as open and maybe more authoritarian. So there are reasons, valid reasons, for not adopting KYC.
00:35:10.096 - 00:35:44.626, Speaker A: However, the other side of that is with anonymous wallets, you are going to have more, you could argue more bad behavior, quote unquote know your collector verifications and KYC considerations collector reputation system proposed here are some solutions. Allow maximum numbers of object collected limit yeah, so here are the ultimate solutions. Allow max number of objects collected I thought versum used to have it. I actually checked their mint page and I don't know if they got rid of it. Maybe it's on the list, I can't remember. Limit numbers of copies sold to a single user and towards an allow list. So thank you, Diane Drube.
00:35:44.626 - 00:36:18.948, Speaker A: This is incredibly helpful. And also in here is the, this was also from Diane Drubay addressing burning NFT editions in the NFT art community. And so this also, you know, I think we've gone through pretty much everything here. This is a more. If you're interested in a more fleshed out version or more elaborate version of what we just saw. So finally, historic alive, the collector in question from yesterday, Pokeballay. I'd like to know what your conception of burning an NFT is.
00:36:18.948 - 00:36:56.900, Speaker A: I think it would be to wrap, to prevent access to thieves, or to protect the artwork. It seems that the language is deteriorating too fast. Where do you see the damage in the flame icon? On. Yeah, so just finally on this, and then we can hopefully get to the art. My conception, and I don't claim to be an expert, but my understanding is that it's basically sent to a wallet where the work is irretrievable. Right? So that is, to burn a work is you send it off and then nobody else can do anything with it, in effect taking it off the market. Now, if that's not true, feel free to inform me and I'll happily share it with everybody.
00:36:56.900 - 00:38:19.690, Speaker A: And does the flame icon. In a sense, I do have an issue because basically, and I mean historical live did point this out that maybe this is mistitled burning, but the overall understanding, I'd argue, in the community is that ultimately to burn something means to basically, quote unquote, destroy it, or at least take it off the market unilaterally, permanently. That is, in effect, where it can't be retrieved. And it brings up this other issue. So if there's nothing wrong with burning an NFT, quote unquote, and it's just sending it to another wallet, well, doesn't this like, I mean, the whole idea, let's say if you're going to buy all the editions of ten and to get written to burn nine, take them off, is this idea that they aren't accessible and that they aren't the same as your original one, so in effect, you are disabling them financially from a collectibility nobody can access them, in effect destroyed. But maybe not in practice destroyed, although maybe not in theory. So if you're a collector doing this, but then you also think that, well, it's actually not destroying it.
00:38:19.690 - 00:39:07.244, Speaker A: To me, it's kind of like it's having it both ways. Like if you're obviously doing it to take it off the market and to basically get rid of it, to quote unquote, burn it so that you have a one of one. But then you're saying, if I understand you right, it's actually not destroying anything. So why are you doing it to begin with if you're not destroying anything? I don't understand, like, if you're, then okay, so nothing's being destroyed. Well, what's the point of quote unquote burning it then? So I just don't, you know, none of this makes sense. And again, like, this is all turning into sophistry and semantics. And honestly, what's going on in the back of my head as I see these kinds of arguments is Socrates talking about the sophists and, you know, trying to make the weaker argument the stronger.
00:39:07.244 - 00:39:33.890, Speaker A: That is what I see one of the criticisms, Socrates out of this office. And I just see this is just trying to make the weaker argument the stronger. That's all I see here. Finally, regular Jake, I don't ever know about the legality of the issue, but I do know that I won't ever burn work to introduce artificial scarcity. My reputation as a collector and friend to the community matters more than a few extra tez in my pocket. So thank you for the comment, regular Jake. And here's another one.
00:39:33.890 - 00:40:23.956, Speaker A: Finally. I think this is it. So this is, yeah, so Flynn is agreeing with a lot of what historical live was saying and criticizing Mick Render, who basically bought two works of the Kuhei Yamashita series and then basically said it's the same thing as burning them. Some say that this is ethical and then criticize other forms of collecting. So to me, this is all getting a little rich, that, you know, it's not the same thing. And I think we started our program or this discussion with bind two works as a speculation, and to sell one or even both is not the same as sending them and taking them off the market unilaterally. To never be, you know, against without talking to the artist, that's a completely different issue, in my opinion.
00:40:23.956 - 00:40:38.468, Speaker A: And it's not a double standard. I don't criticize anything, but it is annoying to see the double standards of such characters. What I do is good. Like, to me, this is sophistry. Okay? But again, feel free to disagree. And I say it. You know, I appreciate all the comments, by the way.
00:40:38.468 - 00:41:16.346, Speaker A: Historic alive, and it's, you know, it's all good. And, well, it kind of is, and it isn't, you know, but, you know, we can all disagree here. Let's put it that way. Flynn is agreeing with historical live also, I feel, and this is what I wanted to highlight in this whole page here, I feel there's a little too much discussion on ethics around collecting right now. It's kind of a darn shame to see that happen because sales are down. And I thought to myself, like part of the issue that, you know, NFTs and blockchain and crypto has is the rest of the world do see a lot of crypto is basically kind of degenerate. Okay.
00:41:16.346 - 00:41:54.612, Speaker A: So part of the reason for me it's like, well, maybe we should connect the ethics with the lack of collectors. That's what I think. Who knows? Maybe it has nothing to do with it. But if you want mass adoption, which I think a lot of people would like to see, and there's kind of an inevitability to it. I mean, Kuhei Yamashita was a fairly newer artist, and so you're going to be invite new artists to come on. And then these kind of what I'd call vandal collectors are coming in and burning all their work. Is that going to promote mass adoption? I don't think so.
00:41:54.612 - 00:42:15.306, Speaker A: I think if you want to build something strong, you have to build it on values. And, you know, it reminds me of the whole, you know, royalties discussion. Just the fact that this is a big discussion and debate is a little, you know, it's a little concerning from over here. Just my opinion. Finally, I think this is the last one. And it was hilarious. Salawaki.
00:42:15.306 - 00:42:30.984, Speaker A: Thank you so much for the nice legal advice. Attorney Adrian Pokavelli. Oh, and this is also jurisdiction only if you are in the US, but it's not moral. That's right. For me, it's best if collectors ask for the artist. This is the basic common sense of it. To be honest, I made a mistake twice.
00:42:30.984 - 00:42:58.636, Speaker A: I burned a small edition and then talked to artists. Thank God he or she wasn't angry with me. Never again. And exactly like I think, I don't think anybody should. I think it's just sort of because it hasn't been discussed overly, although Diane Drube did. But it hasn't been, you know, maybe just the discussion needs to take place so that people have kind of a clear idea that maybe this isn't a. The artist may not be thrilled with it and that this can happen to anyone.
00:42:58.636 - 00:43:27.414, Speaker A: And look, this is someone. I burned a couple, and now I kind of don't want to do it again. Finally on jurisdiction. And then we have to run through this episode. I have tons of date to do today. I remember talking to a copyright lawyer here in Germany because I have works, you can see them on super rare, that use appropriated images, old paintings of the Renaissance and whatever. But then I alter and I completely transformed the piece.
00:43:27.414 - 00:43:52.374, Speaker A: And I was asking the copyright lawyer, am I good to go? Can I post these, and the answer was fascinating. He said, where is the marketplace? And it was super rare. And the marketplace actually is based in the US. He's like, if it's based in the US, then you're under us jurisdiction, therefore you have us copyright laws. If the marketplace is based in the US. This is what he told me. And again, not financial advice.
00:43:52.374 - 00:44:28.004, Speaker A: And maybe he's wrong. He could possibly be wrong, but very interesting and probably true. If it's based in the US, then you're under us jurisdiction. If you were to sell it in a german marketplace, it's a much different story. They have much more stricter copyright laws where if you just have a square centimeter of someone else's work in your painting, that is an infraction. So jurisdiction matters. And so as far as, let's say, Vara, which actually chat GPT does think applies, or potentially thinks could include digital art, you may be liable.
00:44:28.004 - 00:45:09.102, Speaker A: And I'm actually much more sympathetic to that because you just see the spirit and it's probably going to come down to judges and so, you know, you can roll the dice. Continuing on, shortcut following some complaints, and I thought this was kind of funny and by respected members of the crypto art community. Regarding zero one, I thought it's important to share some info about how to trade and collect nfts on a secondary market. So zero one was this marketplace, and it is this marketplace where it sounds like there's no money involved and you just trade the art. And then people were wanting to take it off the marketplace so that they could sell it. So this was becoming an issue which I thought was kind of interesting. Continuing on.
00:45:09.102 - 00:45:37.454, Speaker A: Okay, retro Manny, I love this. A quick guide to finding all ten retro man comic books. So let's take a quick look here. And we got some volume. So the comic books are strewn across the bedroom here. And I thought just a very cool video here, it looks like using on cyber or some sort of 3d software and just pretty cool and awesome. So nice bonus, the annual.
00:45:37.454 - 00:46:09.684, Speaker A: And don't forget Atmo. I think Atmo did one of these works actually. Maybe he's involved in the annual and with one of the other works at one awesome artist. I mean, many awesome artists. Mech, TXT and more LB. Just as we like to see here, different renderings and processes here is the Game Boy advance with a. And so I wonder if this is using the camera and then it's being played on the Game Boy advance, or if this is actually, maybe this is the camera.
00:46:09.684 - 00:46:40.134, Speaker A: All to say it's beautiful dithering here and can't wait to see what happens there. DK, welcome to my first solo exhibition in Seoul, Korea. And it was an impressive. I'm gonna kill the music for copyright reasons, in case it is copyright. Look at this show here and kind of scroll through it. So we've got the kids room, but look at what an incredible display this is. I mean, using tvs, but quite nicely here.
00:46:40.134 - 00:47:01.162, Speaker A: And, yeah, look at this. And you wonder if that's a screen or if it's. Or if it's a projector. But pretty impressive. Just looks great there. From DK in Seoul, Korea, Ed Marolla, the free mint on Zora. So just similar to what Sabato was saying about Zora.
00:47:01.162 - 00:47:21.282, Speaker A: The free mint on Zora ended up generating more income than most of my object mints. And that was a free mint. Isn't that interesting? So let's get to the art finally. And then Ed Marolla releases another spectacular work. Kind of reminds me of who this is. Almost like an early Yves tanguy of sorts. Beautiful, beautiful work here.
00:47:21.282 - 00:47:47.510, Speaker A: And of course, dreams are ed Marolla's kind of main kind of subject matter or approach to content, shall we say. And here we just see a beautiful improvisation. Again with clouds in the background. Let's see if we see a cloudy dream of nonsense made in procreate open edition on our Zora. So here it is. And nine have been minted so far available for a week. Beautiful work.
00:47:47.510 - 00:48:31.946, Speaker A: Again, the reason I brought this up on twitter was because I couldn't maximize it on Zora so they could still use and maximize their dan control defend with another beautiful medieval work with this great dragon and this old Renaissance city. And even like these kind of renaissance plant references, it's beautiful. So just more incredibly beautiful work for. From dancontrol edition of 20 for 20 tezos each. And kind of, I think, perhaps related to our burning discussion. Don't get burned, GM. So dancontrol weighs in with a visual commentary there, potentially board me.
00:48:31.946 - 00:49:00.542, Speaker A: Social club hunger. So an interesting kind of surreal work here with teenage mutant Ninja turtles, raccoon blood written on the shirt here of this individual with a mask on and eating their interesting food here. And again, kind of the off kilter perspective on the tablecloth here, an alien in the background. So very cool work here. Another surreal work. Hunger for tezos. And there are 13 left on primary.
00:49:00.542 - 00:49:28.502, Speaker A: And here's an open edition and maybe you can place the people. At first I thought this was Elon Musk, but it is John Carlos and Timothy. So this I believe is Timothy Leary. We see 1968 here. I'm not quite sure who the other people are, but anyway, pretty nice painterly work here from board me social club. This is an open edition and it is only $1.27 each.
00:49:28.502 - 00:49:38.374, Speaker A: Cool work. This is also a cool work. I think it was burned. It was. It was burned. It was listed at 123 tezos before the message. Digital painting.
00:49:38.374 - 00:49:56.214, Speaker A: There may be another one out there. And just love is all you need. And just a really interesting kind of beautiful painting here from wasteman gold Minevich. Just interesting subject. Let's just see quickly. Yes, so not so taken off the market. Burned.
00:49:56.214 - 00:50:25.598, Speaker A: Continuing on sumi Reyusi. A new digital painting here. I need more kisses. And here we see a frog and maybe a princess of sorts that is going to kiss the frog. We see the magic wand and a sorcerer's cap and everything. Cool texture in the background here. So nice to see a digital painting from Sumireusi at auction for 100 tezos edition of one Florida Marquez with a beautiful new stamp.
00:50:25.598 - 00:50:49.250, Speaker A: Morandango Republic. Pepo of patience with cool, kind of monochromatic sea creature here, or swamp creature. And just another beautiful work here. Another beautiful stamp from Flora Marquez. And almost you see the moon reflected in the background there. Brilliant color. Nice, kind of painterly, almost like watercolor here.
00:50:49.250 - 00:51:01.734, Speaker A: Beautiful, beautiful work. And even the blacks are different, you see, it's like almost a matte black here. Maybe you can't see that. And it's like a darker black up here. Just beautiful, beautiful details. Only three tazos edition of 20. There are four left.
00:51:01.734 - 00:51:29.558, Speaker A: Let it rip by Lewis Osborne. So interesting. Continuing with kind of the happy and the sad face, these spinning tops here, circling each other, kind of, you know, the cycles perhaps of life, of being happy and sad and sadness going into happiness. Let it rip. Addition of 60. Let's just see what happened. Sold for 750 on primary.
00:51:29.558 - 00:51:53.864, Speaker A: So pretty reasonably priced there. $5 each from Lewis Osborne, who continues to put out work. Spontr with another interesting angle illustration here. And I think this is called fiat panda heading towards a better future. Almost like a car commercial copy there as the figure here with the shirt, potentially. Maybe that's not. Maybe that's a tattoo.
00:51:53.864 - 00:52:12.190, Speaker A: I'm not sure what that is. But anyway, interesting perspective here on the figure walking into the car. Cool line here. Also demarcating, you know, going through the car, adding, you know, kind of finishing off the composition of sorts here. And beautiful car, I might add. It looks like it was done freehand. Really nice work here.
00:52:12.190 - 00:52:24.418, Speaker A: Edition of one. Let's just see what happened. Sold for 25 tezos to shin. Shin art. Very cool. Timothy Jullien with another new work, cloudy. Another experimental architectural work here.
00:52:24.418 - 00:52:52.678, Speaker A: And so a lot of the similar colors here. Even this can't tell. This looks, I guess, is a reflection here on this kind of arc of sorts here. And just kind of roman arches here, style arches here. And just cool, kind of arty architecture. And, you know, the stairway into the wall, and then just interesting kind of architectural abstraction. These are the words I'm looking for.
00:52:52.678 - 00:53:06.262, Speaker A: Cloudy. Interesting title available for five tezos. So it looks like it's sold out on primary at $0.50. Selling them for basically $0.30 each pp universal. With another really interesting piece here. Let's actually see the title.
00:53:06.262 - 00:53:31.440, Speaker A: Automaticamente memente. And, I mean, it looks like a huge bug on the back of this person's shoulder. And then we see this kind of picture. And a picture again, 18 dead. So kind of mysterious work here. And this is an edition of five for seven tezos each. And there are only two listed.
00:53:31.440 - 00:53:47.824, Speaker A: So I was going to say you could potentially buy all of these. So continuing on, don't say you are ordinary. This is a collaboration between a narrator and rinnefish. Courtesy of explainer gallery. I believe there is. There we go. So nice collaboration.
00:53:47.824 - 00:54:14.764, Speaker A: A pretty cool solution to melding these two artists together. Then there's a narrator showing up within a rinnefish piece here. Very nicely done. And the colors actually perfectly kind of match. Continuing on, popple nymph of crinoid Garden. And this is an edition of 25. And now on secondary for 29 tezos.
00:54:14.764 - 00:54:35.364, Speaker A: Cool pixelation here. And nice little reflection here. So another kind of these, I think this is from the sanitarium series. We'll check in a second. And here we see the, uh, this kind of red reflection lighting up the plants here. Nice contrast between the blue, bluish purple and the red. And just more beautiful.
00:54:35.364 - 00:54:53.070, Speaker A: Interesting work. Sanitarium is a series from popple. It was probably, you know, so it was 17 tezos on primary. So a little bit more on secondary here. Cool work by Spiegels Maskinen. So this is done on chain. CGA on Chainedm, if interested.
00:54:53.070 - 00:55:18.606, Speaker A: And here is a little alpha here. Very nice indeed. How is it stored on chain? Is this a new feature in foundation with a great tool of advancing art found on. But beware of file sizes and gas prices and so on. So very cool. There are a lot of. Or a few ETH collectors that are quite bullish.
00:55:18.606 - 00:55:46.298, Speaker A: On, on chain art and who see it as extra valuable. So pretty smart and cool of spiegels to mint that. So that was minted, what, yesterday? 128 by 256. Very cool on chain. So something else to try out. There's a ton of beautiful work that was put out yesterday. This is cortex number one by Suizoichi, created on Microsoft paint, animated on gimp.
00:55:46.298 - 00:56:18.192, Speaker A: And here is just a really cool pixel art piece. Cool colors and just everything. Just kinda, you can kind of recognize a lot of the imagery, kind of representational, but kind of abstract at the same time. Very nice piece. And here is another interesting piece. This is Marcel Munteanu, who I believe we've seen comments from Marcel on the show deluxe paint and a screenshot of the deluxe paint at work. And just a really cool kind of abstract gradient here.
00:56:18.192 - 00:56:34.508, Speaker A: Having fun with gradients on deluxe paint. Green ginger. I don't know if that's been put on the blockchain. Cruise to dusk. So here is a new work here. Kind of a lighthouse with a cruise ship in the background. One of my favorite images these days.
00:56:34.508 - 00:57:04.612, Speaker A: And a beautiful kind of sunrise or sunset here with the lighthouse looking on. And this beautiful shore here, beautifully done with kind of trademark ratio here. Canvas size by green Ginger 250 on primary. There are five left. Mech txt Good morning, hopeless romantics. So just more beautiful work. This may have been minted on foundation, I'm not sure, but pretty cool work here by mech Txt that was posted.
00:57:04.612 - 00:57:29.054, Speaker A: And these are doing really well. Look at that. 8300 views here. And just posted like at September 4 at 12:43 a.m. So about a day and a half ago. So pretty nice reach there for mech Haiti Rockette with a new work. And again, uh, you know, using the burn mechanism here, mints, you know, 10,000 pretty much, and then burns 9990.
00:57:29.054 - 00:57:43.934, Speaker A: So yeah, it is interesting. So this is a. As we all know, this is a something that artists use. And assuming that this is kind of done, you're. You've burnt them. I mean, so it is interesting. Maybe the language needs to change.
00:57:43.934 - 00:58:02.414, Speaker A: Beautiful work. All to say super spacer. Awesome title. And kind of, it looks like maybe japanese text here on this super cool glitchrom from Haiti rocket. A master of the glitch. Rom continuing on, Sean Luke passing pawns. This is a new one on object.
00:58:02.414 - 00:58:32.928, Speaker A: And here we see some chess pawns that are kind of surrounded and moving through, surrounded by a kind of repeating patterning here. So just kind of a cool kind of semi abstract work with the pawns here. And this interesting framing device put on top by Sean Luke. Let's just see if it's sold. Transferred to Bijou. So maybe a commission. Continuing on, Datura edition of six.
00:58:32.928 - 00:58:51.736, Speaker A: And quite similar to the one yesterday, but different. Babylon 230, shifting digital landscape edition of six. Yesterday's was a one of one, but you see closely related here. So similar piece using similar process, one imagines. Cool colors, as usual. Great work from detour, as always. DJ Kira and Ranexteer.
00:58:51.736 - 00:59:23.124, Speaker A: A couple of more from their series. Momentary lapse. So nice work here. Cool combination edition of seven for three tezos and Slava three screen exodus. So here is another work by Slava. So experimenting with, you know, going beyond the one bit work that we often see in the earlier work. And playing again with this windows 95.
00:59:23.124 - 00:59:47.272, Speaker A: Some beautiful. Look at this. The dithering that goes from the simple dithering to the most to the fullest dithering. That's a pretty cool, simple, cool idea. Here we see some kind of windows, uh, imagery. And in the middle, it looks like a skull that is kind of being, uh, taken apart somewhat. And there it's like a windows desktop kind of glitched out a little bit.
00:59:47.272 - 01:00:00.920, Speaker A: Cool work from Slava. Let's see. And this also went to Bijou. So bijou is on a tear. Maybe taking advantage of the low tez prices, potentially. Renki. I mean, I.
01:00:00.920 - 01:00:21.016, Speaker A: I feel like, I understand, like, art collecting can become a massive, like, you just want to get more and more and more. It can be very addicting. Renki. Edition of ten. Here's hofu. And a beautiful work here. Cool colors and kind of a different take on some of the animated abstracts that we've been seeing.
01:00:21.016 - 01:00:46.734, Speaker A: From Renkke. Edition of ten, only one available. Lorna Mills. With a kind of a cool end of summer work here. Villavilla. And here we see a big bubble and some forest in the background with a cool kind of lime green mask here. And of course, it kind of follows along and again, uses the marquee tool in Photoshop, the selection tool, as far as I understand, villavilla.
01:00:46.734 - 01:01:02.394, Speaker A: And available edition of 32 for 50. And there's one left. Did these all sell? So look at this. Very popular here at 15 tezos each. Got it. So continuing on. And look at this stunner from Somfei.
01:01:02.394 - 01:01:31.708, Speaker A: You gotta love this one with the disc that kind of flips in. So just beautiful. Super original. Not sure where this original imagery came from or if Somfei made it, but it is awesome. Just really hits this one. It's fun and it's cool from over here, Mika Oladev with a couple of cool works here too. And kind of a, you know, a person, kind of a face profile picture kind of structure here.
01:01:31.708 - 01:01:49.572, Speaker A: Kind of just coming apart with turning into a massive eyeball. See the iris there, blinking thousand by 1000. Artifact number 33. And this sold to Bijou, transferred over. So Bijou is commissioning, it would seem, quite a few works here. Also artifact number 31. This is a one of one.
01:01:49.572 - 01:02:16.338, Speaker A: And this went to NFT spritz for tazos. And here is an interesting glitch work from score one of one. And let's just see Bijou. So you see Bijou is tearing up the scene with these commissions. And a pretty nice work here from score, as we see. Kind of almost has a. Looks like a Renaissance painting of sorts, but kind of glitched out.
01:02:16.338 - 01:02:34.754, Speaker A: Let's just see Buddy Celli's mystical nativity, 1500 to 1501. So if we had more time, I would actually take a look at that painting. I don't recognize it. Interestingly, draws inspiration from Buddy celli. So uses. Exactly, uses some AI here. So maybe.
01:02:34.754 - 01:02:51.494, Speaker A: Exactly. Very interesting. Porta malmar as we cross the hour mark. So I'm going to speed through this here, porta malmar with some more collage. Looks like AI is included in there. Interesting piece here. Post collage AI art.
01:02:51.494 - 01:03:08.322, Speaker A: And here's another one, post collage AI art. Floreros. Very cheap. One of ones, by the way, five tezos. Five tezos, one of ones. So nice work here. Elly low with a gl b gltf file, if I'm saying that right.
01:03:08.322 - 01:03:22.784, Speaker A: Grindmagotchi. So we have a Tamagotchi here at last. And here, you can zoom in on it. So interesting. Just format here. Cool. Nicely done here, by the way, from Elly Lowe at auction for five tezos edition of three.
01:03:22.784 - 01:03:59.250, Speaker A: As we go into AI white solitude putting out a new work. This is an edition of ten at seven tazos. And of course, white solitude has this incredible brushwork technique that they've developed, which is very impressive. So just nice AI artwork. The last dance from white solitude just released. And here we have dance vitar with some interesting AI work. My new project is based on my AI collaborative process and looks like they're going to have a live performance to present the third to the 5 November, which I got a grant from the Ministry of Culture.
01:03:59.250 - 01:04:41.588, Speaker A: Where's dance vitar from? Not sure. But anyway, here is some of their work, which may be on display here. And we've seen their work in the past. So just kind of cool distorted bodies here courtesy of AI. Just interesting work continuing on Ilay with a new Ferris wheel and here's wonder wheel, I believe wonder wheel one. Number two, New York City life AI. So another really nice kind of fair work and it almost looks like a beach mixed with a fair which is kind of cool edition of 20 and actually sent me one.
01:04:41.588 - 01:05:12.416, Speaker A: Thank you Ile and sent them out all to friends and collectors likely so that is very cool. And Tuques finally with some really interesting experiments here, AI experiments. So Tuks keeps up the experimentation impressively. Here's another one of course by Tuks and just interesting work, kind of always balancing between representation and abstraction. And that my friends is your show. Come hang out with us insider tomorrow. Thank you for the patience on the long show.
01:05:12.416 - 01:05:15.984, Speaker A: Thank you for the discussion and until next time, take care.
