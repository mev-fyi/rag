00:00:04.200 - 00:00:24.274, Speaker A: I am back. We are back. Thank you for once again joining me. It was a wonderful week in Munich, outside of Munich, too, actually, is where I stayed. Geisenfeld, 45 minutes outside. Anyway, we will discuss artist journal, May 29, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany.
00:00:24.274 - 00:00:48.294, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Determined as ever, for whatever reason. I know not, I know not why. What is it? Ballard's line. Unconscious assignments run throughout our lives. Yes, indeed they do. And this feels like an unconscious assignment if I've ever had one.
00:00:48.294 - 00:01:12.560, Speaker A: Anyways, welcome back, everybody. This was sent to me over the week because there was, I'm tempted. I don't want to diminish it. I mean, I would call it a tempest in a teacup. But there was controversy over this work here by one don't knows. And it's funny, I wasn't even planning on starting with it. I was just going to mention it with just some copyright stories that we have here.
00:01:12.560 - 00:01:32.394, Speaker A: But then it was so beautiful. Like, look at how great it looks on the screen here. And it even perfectly kind of fits the screen. So I was like, I think I'm going to start with this. And the colors are great. So of course, this is one don't knows, as many of you know. And so let me show you the controversy and then we'll go back to the work.
00:01:32.394 - 00:02:16.514, Speaker A: Okay, so here is the tweet. Let me do this. So id artist. This space is unbelievable. I found a new respect for people who meant, okay, so their first AI generation as it is, after seeing this, does this mean you can use anyone's work with a little to no change? So this is the tweet. And when you first see the tweet, you think, oh, that's pretty close and whatever, but we're going to look closer and what you're going to see, like, at first glance you might think, oh, that's actually pretty close. But then if you really look in, this is the original.
00:02:16.514 - 00:02:34.504, Speaker A: This is the original work. And actually we have a nice big version here. Here we go. So here's our perfect. That is probably the work that was used because you see the color is almost exactly the same. So, but it's actually not. Look at the pool.
00:02:34.504 - 00:03:11.494, Speaker A: The pool is much beautiful, almost a more emerald. You see the people in the pool? No people in the pool. And I'd argue, most significantly, most impactfully, the crop that is the great, like, look at. I would actually argue if I was on a desert island and you said, which is the tighter composition? I would say one don't nose work here, except the pain with pleasure, as it's called here. So. And then there's just talking about pain here. And it did sell May 19.
00:03:11.494 - 00:03:43.100, Speaker A: So, yeah. So all to say, this is filled with all sorts of stuff. Like, you see the background here, the crop. Most importantly, the cows are different. There is a bridge in the background, and they're just the eye trademark. One don't knows, and I've seen another artist who I can't remember use this oval thing, and I think this was one don't knows creation. Or at least in, you know, one don't knows was the first person I saw to use this.
00:03:43.100 - 00:04:10.872, Speaker A: So there's a lot of borrowing, and I don't think that's a bad thing, to be perfectly frank. And so you see there's the bridge over here, and there's the mirror. So there's a lot of change here. So all to say, it's quite a different work when you look up close, right? I mean, we can even do a little bit more looking up close here. Like, it's quite a different work. The color feels different. The whole thing feels kind of different.
00:04:10.872 - 00:05:01.230, Speaker A: Even these kind of mysterious circles, the cows with just, like, the bones that stretch them out. So all to say, I'm not too worried about it. And just a final thing on this. I mean, one don't knows it'd be different maybe if this was one don't know's first work, because then there's no kind of track record, there's no kind of credibility that would be. Would have been built. But one don't knows has been working. You know, really is an incredible story that started on object or on hen and really as a collage artist and built himself from nothing and then went over to super rare, did really well and is really one of the, you know, leading lights of this scene.
00:05:01.230 - 00:05:27.444, Speaker A: And so it was really. And earned. It was earned. So all to say, you know, and again, I'm kind of back to this idea that if I was on a desert island, which work would I prefer? And I suspect I would take the one don't knows. Again, I'm kind of back to the. This is a tighter composition. It's a little bit more filled with mystery and these interesting eyes that are going across.
00:05:27.444 - 00:05:51.272, Speaker A: I mean, the charge is, this isn't creative. Right. But I see all sorts of creativity here that is at work here. I do from a, you know, technical perspective, like, legally speaking, is the work transformed? Well, clearly. Clearly. And again, I think my favorite thing actually is the crop. This is a much busier composition.
00:05:51.272 - 00:06:11.794, Speaker A: This person has gotten rid of. All the background has changed here. This has been gotten rid of. In a sense, you could say there's too much going on in this painting. And it, you know, it reminds me of being in Munich in the alta. It's not the Alta Gameilde gallery, it's the Alta Pinacotec. And I believe that's an italian word.
00:06:11.794 - 00:06:45.178, Speaker A: If you go to the Vatican, you go up the escalator. I think there's an escalator. You go up and there's kind of a big counter, circular counter, if I remember right. And on the right is the pinacoteca. And that is a word for the painting gallery. That's where all the paintings are. So in all to say, in Munich at the Alta, the old painting gallery, I mean, these old, you know, what I consider fairly academic works, and what I mean by academic works is the way that they're built.
00:06:45.178 - 00:07:20.290, Speaker A: In other words, that they are oil paintings that are built from a sepia, you know, browns and reddish Browns foundation, you know, put in your underpainting of the browns. Then you start adding darker browns, you know, in, in these darker areas and lighter browns in the lighter areas, and then you start applying color. These paintings all start to look the same after a while. And it was, once again, I had that experience there. And I have to say it was the quietest museum I've ever seen. I have not. There's Leonardo's in there, just sort of, they're a Leonardo.
00:07:20.290 - 00:07:46.708, Speaker A: There are raphaels. There's a fantastic perugino. So these were exceptions for me. These were highlights. But overall, I'm kind of back to these 17th and 18th century paintings. You know what I consider what I would be tempted to call academic paintings? They get dry and you just start walking through the rooms because they're, you know, and stopping here and there. And I'm not against that.
00:07:46.708 - 00:08:32.964, Speaker A: Like, you know, so anyways, I could go on and on here. But what was so interesting, though, is then when we went to the modern, actually they had another, the modern building was closed, and then in the basement, they had a show with some modern works. And you really, and you know what the difference was between, like, what I, this is like an academic painting. It was works that were no longer built in that kind of, I don't know if you'd call it bark way, but with, like, the browns, without that brown underpainting, without that academic style, without that. And it's a really powerful way to learn. It's how you oil paint it's how you do realistic oil painting. And there's a lot to be learned from knowing that technique.
00:08:32.964 - 00:09:27.284, Speaker A: But ultimately it gets dry. And so the real break, I'd argue in the 19th century, say, with impressionism and why it was such a revolutionary break is all of a sudden that brown underpainting disappears or starts to disappear with Manet. It's tempting to think that it's a gray underpainting. And I mean, that was also classical or academic doing gray. But the colors change and it's all of a sudden these works come to life and you see the revolution that occurred in the last half of the 19th century in painting. So all to say, I put a very high value on what Terence McKenna would call the felt presence of immediate experience, of that instant aesthetic experience. And I'm kind of back to this thing.
00:09:27.284 - 00:09:58.342, Speaker A: I'm having a greater, more fulfilling, more fascinated experience here with one don't knows. So if anything, I mean, I understand where that original tweet was coming from, but if anything, it's a testament that I think one don't know is, you know, you could be tempted. Sometimes the remix is better than the original, let's put it that way. That does happen. And sure, and it's not just a remix. There are other factors at work. But you could say it's a remix of a certain kind.
00:09:58.342 - 00:10:34.638, Speaker A: Just like you might bring in different snare drums than were in the original. Okay, we're gonna bring in a bridge and we're gonna have an eye. So I think, you know, I wouldn't be against calling this a remix of a certain kind, but again, one don't knows has built up a lot of credibility, and that has to be taken into account as well. So, of course, one don't knows is not the only problem, is not the only person facing this problem. This was quite significant here. This is May 18 Supreme Court rules against Andy Warhol in copyright case. So I don't know if you've been following this.
00:10:34.638 - 00:11:16.654, Speaker A: There is a, this, I believe it's this work here. And here's the photograph. This painting or screen print of prints. And I mean, was considered an infraction. And I'll just read you a paragraph here. The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that Andy Warhol was not entitled to draw on a, to draw on a prominent photographer's portrait of Prince for an image of the musician, that is estate license to a magazine, limiting the scope of fair use defense to copyright infringement. In the realm of visual art, this is really going to open at what you might a can of worms, a whole bunch of problems.
00:11:16.654 - 00:12:02.642, Speaker A: The vote was seven to two, and here is basically the main thrust. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the majority, said the photographers original works, like those of other photographers, are entitled to copyright protection. And I thought this actually spoke a lot, even against famous artists. I mean, I don't know why that's even added there. Either it's entitled to copyright protection or not, but it seems like Justice Sonia Sotomayor, mayor, has a bit of a beef against the fact that it was done by a famous artist. I don't know why. And here is just a little more from her, from Justice Sotomayor.
00:12:02.642 - 00:12:47.054, Speaker A: To hold otherwise would potentially authorize a range of commercial copying of photographs to be used for purposes that are substantially the same as those of the original. As long as the user somehow portrays the subject of the photograph differently, he could make modest alterations to the original, sell it to an outlet to accompany a story about the subject, and claim transformative use. Well, sure, and I think we should all be for that, I would say. And then the is interesting. I believe Elena Kagan is so a liberal and a conservative, wrote that the decision will stifle creativity of every sort. It will impede new art and music and literature. This is what Elena Kagan wrote.
00:12:47.054 - 00:13:37.812, Speaker A: It will thwart the expression of new ideas, the attainment of new knowledge. It will make our world poorer. So the dueling opinions from two liberal justices, who are often allies, had an unusually sharp tone. So, quite interesting here, because the implications for the art, you know, for making art are quite enormous, actually. So, you know, as an artist, frankly, like, it's, you know, and I may regret these words, but it's a bit of a come and get me. Okay? Because when I look at these works by prints, over, sorry, by Warhol of prints here, all I see is total imagination and mastery. I see a total great artist here.
00:13:37.812 - 00:14:09.666, Speaker A: Look at all these different ways he is using this photograph and arguably making better works out of it. I mean, so it kind of harkens back to one don't knows there, interestingly. So, yeah, so that is that. And we have a ton to get through here. So I don't want to go too far on this, but this also came up, and probably a lot of you saw this, too. And there's this issue. A super rare artist who has his own course on domestica sells art that is just traced from a photo.
00:14:09.666 - 00:14:36.630, Speaker A: Now back to Warhol. I consider Warhol one of the great tracers. I'm a tracer. So, again, Warhol is a fantastic tracer. You know, so people use the word tracing as if it's, like, pejorative or a negative, you know, I mean, this is like, you know, where do you draw the line? So a projector, you know, I, you know, I did. I went to the Academy of realist Art. That's where I learned how to do academic painting.
00:14:36.630 - 00:15:04.878, Speaker A: I went there for two sessions of two weeks, and I brought up the projector issue. I was like, you know, do you guys think it's cheating to use a projector? And they kind of laughed. Professor is like, no, you use every tool you can. So there's nothing wrong with tracing. It goes all the way back. You could even argue that Vermeer, you know, they have that whole movie where it's like, Vermeer just had some sort of projector, basically, where he was tracing. Okay, and that's Vermeer.
00:15:04.878 - 00:15:27.054, Speaker A: So it's a slippery slope. And I ultimately don't think that that ruling there is going to stand over the long term. I suspect at this point, like, the genie has left the bottle. I don't know if they can put that back in. So here we go. So it's illegal to sell such arts if you don't have a license for commercial use of photos. So you could argue the same argument.
00:15:27.054 - 00:16:22.166, Speaker A: Now, if we look at the piece, it feels a little closer, though, doesn't it? Like, this is starting to look very close. Like if you. Because here you could start to say, well, how transformative is this? Because it almost looks like a adobe illustrator, you know, trace, where you just hit the trace and then it does the work for you. It doesn't even look like that person has physically traced this. So here it's a bit more of a murky issue, I would argue. So this is where I think, really, the courts can weigh in on gray zones, but I think in Warhol's case, it's a clear example of transformative, of transforming the work. So, yes, I mean, for how long will we confuse the words inspiration, reference, and stealing? So it's a long discussion.
00:16:22.166 - 00:17:10.508, Speaker A: I mean, it goes back to t's Eliot and earlier, I'm sure, the anxiety of influence and where your influence stops and your creativity begins here, I'd say, you know, unless it's a concept work, then, you know, then you could say it works. Like, and what about found objects? Are also the designer of the urinal that Duchamp used. Are they going to claim copyright, too? So it's a slippery slope. Anyways, I don't want to spend too much time on this, and we've already spent 16 minutes here. Interestingly, though, so I clicked on the link and, or I did a search and let me just make sure, like, I'm pretty sure. Let's see if it shows up. Yeah, it's a 404, so they got rid of it.
00:17:10.508 - 00:18:09.294, Speaker A: And maybe in that case, I mean, so this is where interpretation, like, maybe in this case, maybe it makes sense, right? So unless it's some sort of concept that the artist is working with, then you could argue there is transformation. Anyway, I thought it was the whole transformative argument for fair use is to me, one of the great legal legislative innovations. It's brilliant legal work. It makes total sense, and it allows people to be creative. And I would just say to the photographer of prints, you know, I think that probably increased the value of that photograph that was taken of Prince with Warhol. That's the photo that Warhol used. And it's like, I like the approach that Campbell's soup and coke took, which is not to sue Warhol, but I think they used, you know, Warhol's work in the recent ad campaign.
00:18:09.294 - 00:18:33.710, Speaker A: And like, what is the Warhol foundation gonna do, sue them for it? That would be ironic, right? So. And maybe they paid them for it. I don't know. Anyways, let's keep going here. So just opening up that topic, because a lot was done on that in the last week. Just there's a little bit of controversy on the pricing business. There's some sort of five test challenge.
00:18:33.710 - 00:19:19.594, Speaker A: Is that too low? I mean, that's what I love about tezos, is how I can get masterpieces for a tezos sometimes. We're going to see a few today, or at least two tezos looking through thousands of pages of sub one tezos, one of ones for the five Tez challenge, and have some questions. Does Tes need to advertise its accessibility and low pricing? Or is this known already? Is it in fact a barrier to adoption for a large chunk of the market? Does that matter? Does Tezos want to be an everything chain, both accessible and exclusive via object one? I think it needs to resolve this a little bit. I think they'd be. Put it this way. I mean, just one person's opinion, and nobody needs to agree with me. I'm not trying to lord my opinion on anybody.
00:19:19.594 - 00:20:09.906, Speaker A: It's just one. I think they'd be so much better served to really to turn this into a one of one platform for the artists and then just put curation tools. And then if you want to have you know, specialized curation on top of it. And then there can have those pages where you invite curators and like, to me, that would make a lot more sense because then you're just going to get much more just regular traffic. Otherwise you always have to convince people to come to your site every three months or every three weeks when you have a new curation. And so I think just from a practical business, and I think the community, just from, again, one person's perspective here would probably appreciate it more. I'd love to have all the one of ones, and maybe it encouraged me to make one of ones and it might just help the whole market evolved potentially.
00:20:09.906 - 00:21:13.284, Speaker A: Is that a reasonable goal? Is it achievable? Does one aim cancel out the other? Will this push Tez artists to actually lower their prices? So a lot of questions here from RJ. Does it create further challenges to creating any form of meaningful income through web3 art? Well, I will just mention this, and I've mentioned it many times before, we are utterly spoiled here in web3. Even in the bear market, the fact that many of us, like many, many, many of us can, I'd almost say most of us, can put out an artwork and get something for it and sell it on a thing that you made on your iPad or your computer that cost you basically $0 in materials and get money the same day or whenever it's finished, is something to be incredibly grateful for. No ideas on these things. Just struck by the role of pricing and the marketing on web3 art and the different paths through it. Yeah, it's a very interesting subject. So, just interesting from RJ.
00:21:13.284 - 00:21:47.612, Speaker A: And so a lot of you probably saw this too, but I would be remiss to not mention it. This generative fill. So this is the new Photoshop here, a new superpower integrated through Photoshop, launching in beta today. Powered by Firefly, our generative AI family of models, Photoshop now lets you summon new objects and augment creations layer by layer, save time, increases possibilities, and. Pretty mind blowing. So I think we had a. There was an episode that I did on a window on the future, and this is basically it.
00:21:47.612 - 00:22:19.534, Speaker A: The future has happened basically like four weeks later here. So as you can see, you can fill in parts of the picture that don't even exist, and then you can choose from a wide variety if you want to change the sky. You don't like the sky? Well, you want some northern lights there. Pick your kind of northern lights that you want to use and boom. So this is a really huge deal here, as you can see here, they select it and then generative fill and it puts some. And then it. Describe what you want to put.
00:22:19.534 - 00:22:43.368, Speaker A: Yellow road lines. So. And then you can widen the photo. I mean, it's unbelievable, right? So a lot of you have seen that. But worth mentioning for those that haven't, look at this, the deer you select and then the reverse. So what's going to be very interesting is how this gets. This is how you're supposed to use it, right? This is how you're supposed to use this tool.
00:22:43.368 - 00:23:26.262, Speaker A: What happens when the artists get involved and start doing things that you're not supposed to be doing? Could be very interesting. Here is another example. Add anything in the image, simply select your location, then prompt a click and generate. So as you can see here, the bottom of the photo can be extended. So all sorts of it makes you wonder about stock photography too, if it's going to get completely disrupted, if you can just make things with AI. So all very incredible and interesting. And before we get into more works here, Remy Forte.
00:23:26.262 - 00:23:50.614, Speaker A: Bonjour. New day, new pen plotter drawing. And I just wanted to show this because I never get tired of the pen plotter just to see it in action. So just some dots here, but looks great. So I continue to be incredibly excited about the pen plotters. So continuing on. Mangran, look at this.
00:23:50.614 - 00:24:10.966, Speaker A: A bit of a discovery here. Someone must have posted this on Twitter. I don't think it's physical. I don't think it has a lot of texture to it, though. So it's tempting, as you can see, like almost three dimensional here. I don't think it's physical, though. So anyway, beautiful composition here.
00:24:10.966 - 00:24:48.874, Speaker A: There's something almost classical about this composition, or even kind of like Picasso's kind of classical work. Special creature 45 edition of seven for Fortezos. Human boy picked one up there. Crush soapbox. So, interesting work. And here's more. And I think these were selling these one of ones for a Tezos 85, to our point, like so that's what makes me incredibly excited, because this is kind of where your inner speculator can meet your inner art collector and go, I think that's why it works here so well, is people go, this is really cheap.
00:24:48.874 - 00:25:13.770, Speaker A: And no, I may not have thought of art. It's not the most liquid investment, but if I can get a work, you know, a one of one work for a dollar 50, well, maybe I'm willing to actually spend that $1.50. So, as you can see here. Yeah. And you can still get some of these. I think these are on secondary for twelve for 1013. So pretty interesting artists.
00:25:13.770 - 00:25:39.802, Speaker A: There's one for a Tezos 85 right here. Maybe I'll pick that up before I upload this. So all to say, all to say pretty impressive. Mangren, a new discovery. And here's rinny fish with a new awesome work. I'm tempted to think this is like people are mentioning touch designer. I I don't know but it kind of gives that feeling of touch designer.
00:25:39.802 - 00:25:57.334, Speaker A: So I don't know, I've never used that software. But anyways really cool work by rinifish. Only 995 left. I would have thought this would have sold out. So really nice. You know moon child, not a number. Explainer gallery Danielle King.
00:25:57.334 - 00:26:27.204, Speaker A: So very cool work from rinnefish. Very fun work. Dreaming with crocodile. And here was Jan Lucas Migone. Look at how they show some of their process which is super interesting this because here it's very painterly around this kind of rainbow esque figure. And then they put you see how it's working. It's almost like not sure what the tool is in Photoshop but it's, it's the smudge tool.
00:26:27.204 - 00:26:50.758, Speaker A: It looks like the smudge tool. So just cure. Just cool to see this in action here. Very cool. So you can check that out on their twitter and check out this gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous work by runetune tanderzones. Very cheap. It's still available actually.
00:26:50.758 - 00:27:13.302, Speaker A: I think it's still available. Let me just check here. I think it's available for another, I think it's available for another 10 hours. I think I saw and it's incredibly cheap. I should pick this up actually. So look at how beautiful that is. So a really nice, great work by rune tune.
00:27:13.302 - 00:27:31.972, Speaker A: Let's just check. I just love it. The colors are tander zones, mixed media 15 frame gif 1500 by 1922.8 megapixels. So very cool. And how many have been minted here? I think I thought a few had been minted. Okay.
00:27:31.972 - 00:27:47.794, Speaker A: Let me go here. Yeah, three have been minted so far. So a nice low edition here. Here we go. And it is available for another 9 hours and three minutes. So tander zonas by roentoon on foundation. I think a genesis work on ethereum.
00:27:47.794 - 00:28:12.830, Speaker A: Nice beginning. Beautiful. And here continuing with the abstract, Rick Oostenbrook who colors since zero, four clients Porsche apple has some pretty interesting abstract work. Just put out a cool sketch and I thought it kind of went well with rune tune's work there. So that is cool. GM doodle. And here was another one, sort of along the same lines.
00:28:12.830 - 00:28:39.410, Speaker A: This is surrealist Shay and this is going for. .2 and here it is. So just another more kind of, you know, these could all hang in the same room of a show, I think so anyways, just cool doodling. Surrealist doodling for .2 by surreal shea the 27th doodle created by Shea the surrealist. And continuing on and some more just kind of illustrative work here.
00:28:39.410 - 00:29:09.396, Speaker A: This is by dutyoodle attack. I feel like I've come across their work maybe once before. I love the game board layout. I'm a big fan of what I loosely call Uis as far as being structures for artworks. And here it's kind of like using the game board Ui, I would argue. So anyways, really cool work. This is on nifty Gateway Moon and stars, published by Art Shore.
00:29:09.396 - 00:29:28.664, Speaker A: So I think there are a couple. And here's the other one. So here's the star. And do we have a moon here? Oh, here's the moon. So anyway, really cool. And yeah, it kind of fits in with the underground comics look like Uyoh 66 and that sort of crowd. Very cool.
00:29:28.664 - 00:30:08.910, Speaker A: Continuing on. So gloomtube with an illustrative work here and referencing the Pepe coin and everything. So anyways, this went for almost free, I think, to axin here and cool American Thai and everything. So it seems to be a bit of a criticism here on the whole pepe situation. Sold for zero nine Yatta. So almost went for nothing. So these auctions, I mean, if you want to find the steals in this, like, to me, the auctions are like dan control.
00:30:08.910 - 00:30:46.032, Speaker A: His four chairs went for like, some went for like twelve, one went for like 30. Those four, one of ones which you could just imagine in a gallery. And again, I'm back to visiting those galleries. I was literally thinking about like, Sabato's like chrome. I think there's a rabbit that he did, or even like the Milky Way. But I was just like imagining like one of those big chrome Sabato works on the wall and how much fun the people that are in that gallery would have had and probably how much more they would have enjoyed it. It made me very bullish going back to kind of like the museums and seeing what was going on.
00:30:46.032 - 00:31:17.564, Speaker A: Brand new museums in a brand new city for me. So anyway, so here is a computer generated inner peace. So a few trading cards is what I'm tempted to call these metaverse cards. And here is VR. And again, playing with this kind of really nice big pixels here, a little bit of glitch. Kind of cool in the way that he's doing the glitch. Like, he's doing what you might consider, like a classic glitch, just a simple glitch, you know, just to make his point.
00:31:17.564 - 00:31:41.720, Speaker A: This is for 58 tazos, so dollar 54 edition of 33. Let's just see what happened here. Sold for 23 on primary, so very cool. There are a couple of others. This is only an edition of three. Enlightenment. Again, playing with these kind of video game big pixels, what I want to call, like 16 bit pixels enlightenment, HP.
00:31:41.720 - 00:32:06.464, Speaker A: So again, playing with this kind of very simple glitch, what I want to call an iconic glitch. This is like your classic glitch. Just a little bit of a, you know, distortion, we might say. And so I like how he's using that. And again with that video game texture is just awesome. And this looks like AI over here. Enlightenment can be seen as the process of gaining clarity.
00:32:06.464 - 00:32:26.694, Speaker A: So just using. Using AI, probably not in the image, but I think in the text. Heightened consciousness. Who knows, though? And here's one more huddle. So, yeah, Hodl is a slang in the cryptocurrency community, which stands for hold on for dear life. So another really cool one. Again, simple glitch.
00:32:26.694 - 00:32:47.782, Speaker A: Really nice. Gotta love the pixels on the bones and the dollar bill here. Very nice. Very, very, very nice. It's sort of when you get the contrast, I've used this in. What is the name of that series? Portraits and landscapes. This where you get shadow and you get these dots.
00:32:47.782 - 00:33:04.734, Speaker A: And then when you get. When the. Because the contrast is high, then you get no. Or there's basically a cutoff in the light filter, and then you get no dots. It makes a beautiful, beautiful effect. If you hope that wasn't too vague. Okay, continuing on the text in the shell, the way of alting.
00:33:04.734 - 00:33:22.910, Speaker A: So this is RJ and going to speed up a bit here. So I feel like we're just starting the art here. There's a lot to cover. This was a really cool piece, though. I love the old Apple computer. It brought me back to my youth here. And that old Apple, you know, two e kind of logo here.
00:33:22.910 - 00:33:41.696, Speaker A: Very cool. The way of all things, you will write. So probably referring to the apple here. Very cool. Some interesting experiments by Lorna Mills. I didn't see these minted anywhere but posted on Twitter. So here is one and no title given to it.
00:33:41.696 - 00:34:09.068, Speaker A: And here is another, which looks like battleships of some kind. Loose lips sink ships. Kind of like the I'm big on the war theme. And it seems to have a bit of a war reference, which is interesting. And continuing on, Renki, what's a really cool work here? Love the distortions. Look at that. So really nice embracing of the distortion here.
00:34:09.068 - 00:34:51.759, Speaker A: Just animated abstract edition of ten believes, just minted, so not sold out yet. Interestingly, here is another one by Renki, again playing with those big pixels here that we saw in UK scene, what I want to call 16 bit pixels available for ten tezos, one left. So that is pretty cool. So very nice. Again, another very nice animated abstract work. Continuing on, figments, I believe, also known as Kappan, who's been putting out some super interesting work here. And again, you know, you see the sim like it's in a completely different context, but black and white and colored pixels.
00:34:51.759 - 00:35:12.884, Speaker A: Some are dynamic, some are static. And again, it's just a natural, it's just a beautiful contrast is what it is. I thought this one was quite different from the others. I'll just open up figments here quickly. You see all these shapes here. So interesting experimentations. These others kind of look like a Pac man game gone rogue.
00:35:12.884 - 00:35:48.492, Speaker A: Almost like lasers. There's a bit of a video game feel to a lot of these. This one seems almost a little different, like it's trying to be an abstract work. So continuing on, micrenders with an interesting kind of pixelated shape here. Spatial spinner, late night abstract, faux pixel art. Cool little. It reminds me of kind of like a bit of a feedback or if you were to drag out, I mean, I think musically here with that kind of delay, it's almost got a little delay feedback sort of thing going on on this work.
00:35:48.492 - 00:36:15.810, Speaker A: Explorations in motion, compositing blender, adobe after effects and Photoshop. So very cool. One of one for 1750. Pretty reasonable. And check this out. So Kristen Rus new music video by Spagelsmaskinen Spiegelsmaskinen for the second single on my two volume album. So how cool is that? So Kristen Rus is making music and Spugels Maskinen is making the music video.
00:36:15.810 - 00:36:41.404, Speaker A: So it's a feature in the Wire magazine and I think that's a pretty prominent magazine. So pretty funny music video here, very simple, cool. It almost looks like aspirite is used for that gradient underneath, but it could be all sorts of software. Anyways, a lot of pixel goodness here. I'm not sure it's for sale. So very cool. And speaking of very cool, authentic waffles, look at this.
00:36:41.404 - 00:37:07.860, Speaker A: More experimentation here and a nice roughness to it. Like I really, again, just back to the looseness in authentic waffles work, not to mention the awesome composition here. But stuff I look at and notice it's like this frame is how rough it is. See, it's bigger here, but it's not as big here on top. It's big, but it's kind of on the sides, it's looser. Just feels very kind of loose. And we love that.
00:37:07.860 - 00:37:39.120, Speaker A: I love that. Again, it's sort of like with Warhol, things don't need to match up perfectly, right? It's actually better. If your Warhol screen print all matched up perfectly, it wouldn't be as good, it wouldn't be as poetic. And so when I see these lines, these little error, quote unquote errors, these little things that are off kilter a little bit, that makes it even better. And I think Warhol, so very, very, very cool here. Interesting hands, too. And just what's this called? Showstopper.
00:37:39.120 - 00:38:04.714, Speaker A: Edema the clown fumbles the performance. This looks like Robocop here. Handshake firmware update. Friendship end with Kujeb. Now PP cop is the best friend. So kind of, what is the word? Kind of cryptic, of course, from authentic waffles and also known as Hasdrubal waffle. And that appears to be the Hasdrubal waffle character.
00:38:04.714 - 00:38:23.778, Speaker A: And. Yeah, so all sorts of cool stuff going on. Awesome texture too. Did we bring up another one? There is another one too, which just had amazing texture. Here's another one. Pneumital homunculi recall system. So I actually finally looked this word up and homunculi is our little people.
00:38:23.778 - 00:38:49.046, Speaker A: It's like at the start of Gulliver's travels when the little people pin down the giant. So here's one more from authentic waffles, who is always super interesting here. So, yeah, so edition of six. Let's just see. I mean, the way these things get sold is always so tricky. It makes it even harder to get. Took an offer of seven for most of them and then auctioned the last one, maybe.
00:38:49.046 - 00:39:27.130, Speaker A: Or maybe just sold them all on offers, interestingly. And here, this came up in the Twitter spaces on Wednesday, which I think is still pinned up, although it probably won't be by the time you watch this, my Twitter feed video, but you can find it in the YouTube channel. Anyway, someone brought up moshit here and here. So very prolific artist here and kind of reminded me a little bit of authentic waffles and playing with this texture here. So very interesting. So just kind of paying attention and enjoying this. No real title here.
00:39:27.130 - 00:39:42.958, Speaker A: That I can read. Edition of two and sold for six tezos each. This was great. There's only one left. I kind of want to pick it up. I've been wanting this for a couple of days here, and nobody has bought this yet. As far as I can tell.
00:39:42.958 - 00:40:09.634, Speaker A: This is an awesome work. I love this work. Two tazos. So this is why I love tazos from a collecting point of view. And as an artist, frankly, as Sky Goodman once mentioned, and I think runetune was echoing that recently, if you're bringing in paying for your groceries by making a work of art and selling it online, I mean, it's not. It's not a bad situation. So what's great? So again, the cheapness is what I think.
00:40:09.634 - 00:40:39.904, Speaker A: If all the works were on ethereum, I don't think many of us would be spending as much money on art, right? At least I wouldn't be if every work was like three or $400 even, which isn't even that much on ETH, so. But if it's a dollar, if this is a dollar 50, I'm sort of like, okay, I think I can get $1.50 together. I love this work. It's an addition, I think, of ten by an artist called Wzyw. Wzyw gink. So really nice work.
00:40:39.904 - 00:40:53.104, Speaker A: They have a few others here. This one was a real standout on the left. But look at, these are like eighty cents. Ninety cents. Ninety cents. So I'm a huge fan of that. Give Wzyw a follow.
00:40:53.104 - 00:41:19.994, Speaker A: Really cool work by cybermystic xtasis for a click. Create drop curated by Koldi and with the theme transcendence. And so this was an addition. 64 are left. So a lot were minted for 0.069. So actually quite a few were minted for 0.07. Anyways, here's the work, before we forget.
00:41:19.994 - 00:41:37.846, Speaker A: So, of course, this recalls that very famous work. I think it's alchemical work. Look at this. I mean, where that person. There's the rainbow. We'll look for the original in a second here. But where the person is passing through into another dimension, the.
00:41:37.846 - 00:42:07.054, Speaker A: The composition has been flipped. And look at all these great stars here. And even the kind of psychedelic reality here in the top right, how it turns into these spirals. And then look at that. I mean, stunning. I mean, stunning work. I mean, again, I'm kind of back to Munich in these museums here, we went to the old pina Kothek and the new one, and then the contemporary one, and then there's one that was kind of under construction.
00:42:07.054 - 00:42:57.124, Speaker A: But all to say, I think this stuff would like, it holds up all very, very, very well in terms of just a visual experience. Okay. That is poetic, right? So here's the black and white kind of outline version, kind of a window onto Marcelo Pinel's process here, which is super fascinating. I mean, so really designed in black and white first, and then the gradients and everything come after the colors and the gradients come after stunning. Let's just see if we can find this alchemical image dimensions that's very surely this is going to. I think here it is. Right.
00:42:57.124 - 00:43:30.848, Speaker A: So this seems to be the inspiration. So we're kind of back to our whole. It's not a very high resolution, but you get the picture. Right. We're kind of back to this idea of that we started this show with, with all the, the anxiety of influence. Like there's, you know, as long as someone's making it their own, you know, as long as someone's not really trying to sell someone else's work as their own. Like, we kind of saw that a little bit with that super rare piece of the portrait of the woman, where it almost starts to turn more into selling someone else's work.
00:43:30.848 - 00:44:08.664, Speaker A: But say with Warhol, I mean, to me, this is completely different, and we have to allow that. Otherwise, as those, you know, only two justices of the nine said, you know, this is going to stifle innovation. I don't think that should let anybody stop them. But everybody has to make their own decision on that. But I mean, again, you wonder, these museums must be freaking out. I mean, even if you own the Warhol, what if you own, what if you have a, you know, $50 million Warhol or $2 million Warhol, whatever the case may be. I mean, anyways, Mars and Venus, the return, we're going to speed up here.
00:44:08.664 - 00:44:40.824, Speaker A: So this is by Matthias Morano. So we've seen Matthias's work before. So a really kind of modern take on Mars and Venus with a whole bunch of tattoos and everything, these beautiful intricate illustrations and kind of a dragon's head there at the bottom. And this sold for half an ETH, so pretty respectable sale on foundation. Here's Greco model horse. And Greco put out a beautiful video of the whole process of building this work. And it was super fascinating.
00:44:40.824 - 00:45:05.176, Speaker A: I'll tell you, one of the things I quite like, myth has done this before, too. This white background, it's kind of like, it's really interesting. The white background, I find, like, it's something that's very counterintuitive. Because it almost feels unfinished. But it's the decision, and I actually think it goes quite well. And it's quite a beautiful work. So this is an edition of eight, I believe.
00:45:05.176 - 00:45:19.960, Speaker A: It's all sold out for ten tezos each. So very cool work by Greco. Very nice. Bezaya. Welcome to paradise. Today it's raining. Kind of looks like Dennis Rodman, but I'm not sure.
00:45:19.960 - 00:45:37.246, Speaker A: And there's the night symbol, angel wings. So kind of welcome to heaven. And there's maybe Dennis Rodman to greet you there. Although I'm not exactly sure who that is. I tend to always miss the references. So available for only 35 tezos, edition of ten. Usually Bezaya sells out right away.
00:45:37.246 - 00:46:03.344, Speaker A: Looks like some people who are looking for a quick kind of flip. Basically buying it for 15 tezos. Yeah. Pure jus around bought four. You know, I think on. I think on versum, they had a way that you could limit when your minting works, that you could limit the amount that people could mint. So you could limit it to one where that address can only mint one.
00:46:03.344 - 00:46:22.580, Speaker A: It is a solution for those people who are troubled by the flippers. I mean, as an artist, I don't mind the flippers at all. They can buy. They can buy all of them. I'm happy to make the sales, but anyways. Mikey Wilson, shipwrecked blues. So another kind of cool, what I'd consider ambitious painting by Mikey Wilson.
00:46:22.580 - 00:46:44.356, Speaker A: Playing with this kind of Robert Johnson type figure. You know, what looks like a blues figure under a full moon and then. But this time on a beach. Shipwrecked blues using AI in mid journey. I think there might be some painting in here as well, but I'm not sure. So this is a one of one. And it sold for $100 to Michele Colonna.
00:46:44.356 - 00:47:02.184, Speaker A: Big shout out. Morlakos. Chapulin's field. Created by Morlakos in 2023. Okay, so this is also available for only tentes. This is another super original composition, I might add here. Like, even, like, the stuff up here, the little plane.
00:47:02.184 - 00:47:29.274, Speaker A: And do you recognize who this is? The myth? The lemonhead here. And then so all sorts. And this looks like Morlacos figure here with the horns again. And I'm sure if we zoomed in, we'd see so much work here and what feel like truly digital oil paintings. And. And look at the flat. This looks like a flat blue on top, so contrasting with this kind of detailed grass.
00:47:29.274 - 00:47:51.674, Speaker A: And then this awesome power line here. So a really kind of ambitious painting, I'd say. There are seven left. When was this minted? Today at 440 Berlin time in the morning. So, yeah, in myth has one here, isolationist Mikey Wilson axing. Yeah, I mean, so get it while you can. It might be gone already.
00:47:51.674 - 00:48:17.856, Speaker A: Look at this. Speaking of myth, arrival of the myth, the myth 2023. Arrival of the myth to the density of matter after dissolving in duality thousands of years ago, decides to descend again. So here is a more painterly myth work. And it looks like experimenting. Experimenting with brushes a little bit, maybe in procreate, I'm guessing here. Interesting painterliness here.
00:48:17.856 - 00:48:43.438, Speaker A: So the myth does like to experiment. If you go through the whole. I was just looking at the whole kind of catalog there, and it's not the catalogue because that would be everything. If you ever see a catalogue, I believe that's what they call it. That's like everything. So it's like Max Ernst catalogue and be like everything that we have. Anyways, so we see the lemonheads here, kind of a more expressionist myth.
00:48:43.438 - 00:49:04.598, Speaker A: And let's just see what happened here. Sold for 350 to tempert. So I'm not sure if I've ever seen Tempert's count before, but sometimes people add in their names after a while. So, yeah, five, maybe a newer collector. Five pages of works here. Hasdrubal waffle. Interesting, interesting.
00:49:04.598 - 00:49:30.130, Speaker A: This was a great work too by Kappa Sage, the Ronald Sage. Let's look at that very quickly here. I couldn't cover everything here because it would take like 4 hours. This is already going overtime here, but it's been a week and a bit, so, yeah, this is a great work by Kappa Sage. Kind of a Ronald McDonald theme and the north face and everything. So very cool addition of 40. And let's just see what it sold for on primary 450.
00:49:30.130 - 00:50:03.308, Speaker A: So nice take home for Kappa sage Rosaceo with a new monster. Monster with meat here. And you can see again playing with that Francis Bacon sort of feeling here. And I think even with the meat. Yeah, so kind of a dark work here and playing with a lot of Rosatio's kind of iconography, the skulls, the eyeballs and the fire and everything. So digital collage and digital painting, and I believe that is sold out at ten tezos each. This was interesting too.
00:50:03.308 - 00:50:28.358, Speaker A: Exit point dancers in a big room. A very painterly work. You know what this looks like? You know that style, I think it's. Is it Varya and this kind of sampled paintbrush. So it's like a very painterly use of the sampled paintbrush where you take a sample and then you drag it. That's what that looks like to me, with maybe a little bit of more traditional brushes here in the background. So pretty interesting piece here.
00:50:28.358 - 00:50:41.194, Speaker A: Dancers in a big room. Almost like an impressionist kind of theme here. Available for 220. Again, another very cheap work. Only four have sold. Pretty interesting work, if you ask me. Look at this by Dan control.
00:50:41.194 - 00:50:57.894, Speaker A: Pretty cool work here of the David. So again, an ambitious work here. And look at the gradients in the background. I mean, those are like, those are amazing. And the ones on top too, but the ones in the background are stunning. So available for 0.7 ETH.
00:50:57.894 - 00:51:25.422, Speaker A: And so pretty cool art historical work. And here's another really cool one by Dan control. So again, I believe this is a one of one. We'll check in a second. Again, playing with the repetition of the everyday object and then playing with this idea of it bouncing off the edge of the composition here and bounces off all four edges here. So just, I think it makes a pretty interesting composition. It's an addition of ten, so that must be on secondary for 150.
00:51:25.422 - 00:51:36.222, Speaker A: Sold for only two tezos on primary. And I think ten were burned. So that is cool. And look at this. This is goyong arts. Good morning, my friends. Have a nice day.
00:51:36.222 - 00:51:56.164, Speaker A: So again, playing with that pixelation, that selected pixelation. So very cool. We see it here, we see it here and just gives. And also with just beautiful illustration. So all of that in combination, like it looks stunning. So that is cool. And another one by Francoise Gamma playing with the walker.
00:51:56.164 - 00:52:22.154, Speaker A: That just dissolves into digital chaos, which is just gorgeous here. So more variations on the theme. This looks like it sold out for twelve edition of twelve at three tezos. Awesome piece. Karim Safa, a one of one unboxing. I like that title a lot and really goes at the factory theme. So another cool, what I call pixel art factory here.
00:52:22.154 - 00:52:52.482, Speaker A: And just looks great. And let's just see what that sold for. Wow. Sold for a thousand. Bijou made an offer for a thousand. So awesome sale for Kareem Safa. Here is another work by Gogolitis who came out and put out a tweet, I think after Kareem Safa's last work, who is saying huge influence on me, so pain giving props.
00:52:52.482 - 00:53:33.158, Speaker A: So again, this influence and look, go go Litis is making completely different works and Kareem Safa would have never made these works, so there's a space to be influenced and inspired by. And so here it is. Anyways, a new kind of video game, Space War two. So go Litus has been returning to some of the Gogolitis earlier themes here with the pong and the space war, but kind of re attacking with more color and just different compositions. Very cool. Armilk 88. And I believe Armilk 88 is the guy whose parents or family made stained glass windows, I believe in Poland.
00:53:33.158 - 00:53:49.992, Speaker A: And big shout out to Armilk, who was at the last Twitter spaces we couldn't fit him on at the end. We were just sort of wrapping up. And here's the signature here. Nice pixel art signature. The a down at the bottom. Look at this frame, too, this rectangular frame. Anyways, interesting, interesting composition.
00:53:49.992 - 00:54:11.894, Speaker A: Tired pixels. Number 60 now on secondary for 1885. Let's just see what it sold on. Primary for eight. So pixel art continues to just fly out the door, really. Here's Haiti rocket with some really cool Rom works here. And we see their japanese writing is being put in and kind of a Sci-Fi space theme here.
00:54:11.894 - 00:54:31.288, Speaker A: Space video game. Interesting combination of text and spaceship here. So that is only 20 tezos for an addition of twelve on secondary. That's unusually cheap opportunity there. Here's another one. So, yeah, there's a few. A couple for 20 tezos.
00:54:31.288 - 00:54:47.316, Speaker A: And here's a surfer contestant practice. So, feeling the summer vibes over here with Haiti Rocket. And this was an interesting piece. Turbolinker. So this was an experimental one. Totally rad. Only rad.
00:54:47.316 - 00:55:11.952, Speaker A: And look at this great color here. So Haiti Rockette playing. It looks like there's some sort of filtering going on here. So starting to break out of just the RoM work, and maybe you did earlier, for all I know. Anyways, very interesting developments there. New York escaper is the hustle lugger. So Curt hustle collective is now putting out baseball cards, which is kind of exciting.
00:55:11.952 - 00:55:28.164, Speaker A: This is a pretty nice one. I like it. Kind of reminds me of Don Russ baseball cards a little bit. New York KHC escapers. And so anyways, that was super fun and cool edition of 13. Let's just see. Sold for 13 tezos on primary.
00:55:28.164 - 00:55:56.726, Speaker A: There's authentic waffles, there's Haiti Rockette and everything. And here is the baseball. And this is an edition of 13. I imagine sometimes those will be sent to people. That's what it looks like happened here. Who bought the baseball card? They get the baseball of this very slow motion kind of pirate baseball guy with the gold tooth. Major league hustle from Kurt Hustle collective.
00:55:56.726 - 00:56:26.774, Speaker A: And look who showed up. Limbo out of nowhere shows up with a new super cool card here. Dark elf of sorrows, melancholy dungeon. And this is still available for 20, again, which these days is pretty cheap for because again, this sold for seven tezos on primary. I mean, don't forget we're at below a dollar tazos, so a great time for collectors right now. Silver headphones. Gooey sobu.
00:56:26.774 - 00:56:48.814, Speaker A: I'm not sure if I saw this on Twitter or where, but I think I picked this up for like two tezos. I just love seeing again, I'm a huge fan of these Uis. So here's the save for web user interface. And here are just some, you know, hello kitty type headphones here. Weird, weird work. And great. I love how the colors are here.
00:56:48.814 - 00:57:08.750, Speaker A: The color table available for 111. One tezos. Eleven tezos cents and seven left. So you can get one for yourself. Here's John with the work, special effects. And you can basically see the skeleton putting the hand in the video camera and coming out the tv. So kind of reversing things a little bit here.
00:57:08.750 - 00:57:29.012, Speaker A: Interesting background. I love the distortion in the grid. The distortion in the grid is very interesting and nice. I mean, the temptation would just be to make that a straight up grid. John's probably been doing that for a long time. Here's Max capacity on foundation 85. New wave buy new for 0.25
00:57:29.012 - 00:57:48.696, Speaker A: ETH. Just kind of a cool work here from max capacity as we kind of go into more video glitch works. Continuing on. Look at this eight so future television edition of one. Let's just put the play on here. So I love this tv. I love the color.
00:57:48.696 - 00:58:09.528, Speaker A: So another just really cool futuristic furniture. Retro future furniture. Love the distortion in the grille here too. So looking great. And that was just transferred to XMortal. So that is cool. You wonder if that was a request by xmortal doctor version with a new work.
00:58:09.528 - 00:58:24.896, Speaker A: So cool textures here. Very nice. Kind of gradients and textures here. Playing again with a rectangular. Rectangular kind of composition here. It's got a bit more space with the lines coming out. And so this is an addition of one.
00:58:24.896 - 00:58:41.772, Speaker A: And sold for 15 tezos to snorko. So nice piece there going into AI. So touques was on the front of super rare. Totally deservedly, as you can see here. Absolutely honored to be featured on super rare homepage today. So that is awesome. And here is the work.
00:58:41.772 - 00:59:09.388, Speaker A: And it looks awesome. So another one of these just like incredible AI artworks by tuks, who I believe is out of turkey. Another artist out of turkey. Just stunning. This would never be made without AI. So really showing the value of AI as a tool for new compositions and new techniques that you might never be able to do. It's like pushing the digital techniques, because, again, these gradients here, you know, first of all, you probably.
00:59:09.388 - 00:59:39.666, Speaker A: You might be able to. If you spent, like, a year on this, you might be able to do this with physically, but this would be more of like a digital gradient. But then these gradients, even to do them digitally, would be so tricky, you know, in here that only AI could do this, one could argue. So this sold for half an ETH, so congrats. There, a yashiki lake, just a beautiful. I mean, again, the colors, stunning. A few works by sum here as we finish up.
00:59:39.666 - 00:59:53.762, Speaker A: And I'm glad it's only an hour of the show, finding peace and getting lost. So this is part of a new series called Serene Sanctuary. And a lot of plants here. Kind of evokes Rousseau in my mind. I love the tiles here, too. Just interesting. It almost doesn't look like AI.
00:59:53.762 - 01:00:16.926, Speaker A: When I first saw this, I thought this was actually a painting she had done. But here's another one in the series. Brown chair, again, has a bit of a Rousseau kind of feeling in all the foliage here, and even just the kinds of plants. So very cool there. And a work by Lily Illo carved out a space for her, a reserve of 0.9 ETH. Kind of a minimal work here.
01:00:16.926 - 01:00:43.014, Speaker A: AI, of course, so interesting expression, too. And look at the background, too. Let's see if anything is carved out of offcuts. She found form for herself. Artwork by australian artist Lily Illo in collaboration with AI. So big shout out to Lily Illo, who was listening to that interview Michele Colonna did with me last week and was saying nice things. I need to tweet that out.
01:00:43.014 - 01:00:59.898, Speaker A: And there's another one by Zach. Actually, I need to tweet out, too. This came up on the other day on PP Universal. PP was talking about other people's art, and I was like, PP, look at your art. This is pretty interesting. So I believe. And I was like, this one is awesome.
01:00:59.898 - 01:01:35.372, Speaker A: I believe this is physical, and maybe there's some digital intervention, but I think this is a physical work. Anyways, you know what this reminds me of is 1970s Jack Kirby. This looks like Jack Kirby is a famous comic artist. One of the most famous, you know, who created the Fantastic Four was Stan Lee and Avengers, Captain America, etcetera. This really has a 1970s Jack Kirby look to it, like, you know, the forever. What was the four worlds of Jack Kirby? DC Comics. This looks like 1970s DC Comics.
01:01:35.372 - 01:01:50.504, Speaker A: Jack Kirby, the only man who can be called Dracula. So art and prompt by me. Short novel by chat cheapy t. So very cool work by PP Universal. Let's just see what happened here. A couple of offers. Ilay with 40 tezos.
01:01:50.504 - 01:02:06.472, Speaker A: Pretty nice offer there. Look at this beautiful work on Instagram that I saw. Like, look at how stunning this is. Again, you see the power of the non finito here of the unfinished work. How good it looks. Studio day. Sanity partially restored.
01:02:06.472 - 01:02:21.274, Speaker A: Like, again, I'm always like, stop here. This looks beautiful. And look at how well this is painted. So this is someone called Karen Klassen. So I didn't remember too much. Anyways, has a nice little following here. Shall we look very quickly.
01:02:21.274 - 01:02:43.234, Speaker A: So a few updates here and yeah, just kind of interesting artist. Hey, don't remember too much about them. Nice textures and everything. So again, you see, this is the finished work. I say, you know, my two cent here, stop right here. This is art. Like, this is beautiful, beautiful art here.
01:02:43.234 - 01:03:10.390, Speaker A: So partially restored. It's like even, like, I love the title as well. It goes perfectly. This is an older work by Yoao Salazar, but I thought it was interesting. It was a self portrait made with plasticine, and I just love how rough it is. So, and just even the concept here behind the self portrait, I just thought that was cool. We've looked at a lot of yo ao's work, so why not check out the self portrait? And of course, you know who this is.
01:03:10.390 - 01:03:35.384, Speaker A: This is wok. And you can just see the complete, total mastery of spray paint here. Like, I see nothing but mastery of spray paint. Like, look at this. Look at all of the drips and everything. It is gorgeous. Like, I don't know anybody in the contemporary art world, famous or not famous, who can make strips like this.
01:03:35.384 - 01:03:53.484, Speaker A: I mean, interesting concept too. D a y day. Let's see if there's a comment day. I mean, this is stunning, this spray paint here. So very beautiful. And that is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me again. And until next time, take care.
