00:00:04.960 - 00:00:19.045, Speaker A: A deep breath as we begin a new week. Breathing, it's very important. It's easy to do the shallow breaths. It's very, very important. Healthy brain, everyone. Welcome back. Artist Journal, October 21, 2024.
00:00:19.045 - 00:00:58.425, Speaker A: Staring off into the green and black as we continue our journey across this pixelated sea. My name's Adrian Pocabelli. It continues. So many of you may have seen this, maybe some of you haven't. Kind of visually arresting, isn't it? Kind of visually awesome. Love the palette, by the way, of course, Spiegels Maskinen with this dithering digital wonder here as we see what I think is a PFP project. Algel version of a PFP project.
00:00:58.425 - 00:01:29.485, Speaker A: So here. So we'll just start with this work. This is like 100% okay, gorgeously. And again, this is something that I just think is so interesting that's happened in digital art, I would argue. It's not like it didn't exist before, of course, and there's always going to be precedent. But again, we're back to this idea of the preeminence of the screen where you make a work that's 320 pixels, like Spiegels does here. It's not a problem, right? It's not a problem.
00:01:29.485 - 00:02:01.967, Speaker A: Whereas, you know, how would you like, I guess you could put it on Tumblr 10 years ago and then that was it. I mean, and then maybe you put it on a screen at the gallery museum, who knows? But anyway, so beautiful work here. Love the almost, kind of almost muted out retro screen. And another thing I noticed, you'll notice it's kind of different from the other screen we saw. And let me just bring that up here. So just to show you the other works in the series. Just kind of picking the one that really jumped out.
00:02:01.967 - 00:02:28.065, Speaker A: This sold for only 044, which was one of the lower priced ones. This one sold for two, amazingly, I guess with the sunglasses. So you see it's kind of like a profile picture project, hilariously. And this one went to Kiro, beautiful pink one with what looks like a Thinkpad or some old school laptop there. And there's a clown and so interesting piece. Computer heads. Love the title.
00:02:28.065 - 00:03:09.385, Speaker A: And as Spiegel says, meanwhile on the Internet, these are also on Tezos. Here's the one I think that Kiro got head number 16. They're also on Tazo. So it's multi chain, as you see here, and just quite a pretty awesome impact. You just gotta love. I mean, again, using these retro monitors, right? And then taking these pixelated Heads which seem to contrast pretty well with, I guess, the stillness of these monitors. And just the busyness and the movement, the pixelated wonder and goodness of the pixelated joy.
00:03:09.385 - 00:03:35.419, Speaker A: It's delightful, isn't it? And so this is 100 Tezos. There are a few on Object as well. So as you see here, interesting colors and I think they continue to be released and they kind of just dissolves into. Into nothingness here. Here's a nice one with some different colors on here. So pretty amazing actually. And look at the.
00:03:35.419 - 00:04:07.315, Speaker A: You gotta love just the formal qualities of these lines. Like if you were to treat this as an abstract painting and forget that this is a monitor. Just awesome angles here and shadows just kind of on again, a formal level. Even the light coming here. Gorgeous, gorgeous work from Spiegel's Maskinen. And finally there is Pepe, which is coming out of the monitor and doing a little dance here before it disintegrates. Current bid 0.069.
00:04:07.315 - 00:04:16.997, Speaker A: So pretty cool project from SpiegelsMeskiren. Also another one. This. This is a. I'm not. I think it's an older piece. I feel like I've seen it before.
00:04:16.997 - 00:04:45.639, Speaker A: But Pixel fool picking this one up. Looks like an old Apple 2e. And we used to put the disk drives on the side, but this is another way you could do it where you put the five and a quarter inch disk drives beneath the monitor and so kind of looks like the Apple IIe or maybe the Apple 2. Shout out to mom and those great green and black colors. So rad work from Spiegels. That's both on Tezos and Foundation now. Thank you for the support last episode.
00:04:45.639 - 00:05:16.211, Speaker A: Let's look at the comments here. Rosaceo, speaking of surrealism, surrealism turns 100 this year. And it's interesting, I think in the auction market you've seen in the last five years surrealism get really hot. I finally saw an article today where it was kind of like surrealism, you know, kind of has been watered down and some sort of, you know, criticism of surrealism being popular. There's. I'm starting to see pushback for the first time after just today. Maybe I should have brought that up, but you can't cover everything here.
00:05:16.211 - 00:05:32.411, Speaker A: So anyways, thank you for the comment. Rosaccio. Indeed. 1924, the Surrealist Manifesto. We're actually going to talk about the second Surrealist Manifesto with one of one, I think in a couple of weeks, maybe two or three weeks. Skomra, great show. Thanks for spending so much time discussing my comment.
00:05:32.411 - 00:05:55.791, Speaker A: And surrealism, Your discussion of Dali in particular, and your discussion of the hard and soft. And your discussion of the hard and soft. Indeed. I really underlined the point. I'm used to decoding images and other artistic works, but never thought of flaccid clocks as flaccid cocks before. Indeed. So, indeed.
00:05:55.791 - 00:06:32.665, Speaker A: This is exactly right, to be blunt about it. Yes. There's a certain kind of decoding that is required, one could argue, for many works that you could call like classic surrealist works. There's often, again, a heavily kind of erotic aspect to it, which, again, you know, we always kind of travel back to Marquis de Sade, you know, where there's a heavy erotic component and again, where sad goes into craft ebbing. Right. Which. The case studies of psychopathic eroticism.
00:06:32.665 - 00:06:53.371, Speaker A: So. Yeah. So there's a very, you know, again, this kind of psychoanalytic reading that you can have. I guess my art education was lacking there. Yeah. Well, you can't know everything. And for all of us, you know, we all have gaps.
00:06:53.371 - 00:07:04.075, Speaker A: So thrilled for the question. Great question, and glad you enjoyed the answer. Tom Bombattle. Thanks, Adrian. Absolute pleasure. Great to see you putting work up. Tom, you have been missed.
00:07:04.075 - 00:07:47.183, Speaker A: Quase objeto. Just to add to the museum's intervention subject, I resonate with your thoughts on persuasion, as it reminds me of Hakim Bey's concept of poetic terrorism. I figure these violent interventions do not appeal to the general public as much as they intend to. It's an iconoclastic movement at its best. And I agree with you that they lack a more creative or even educational approach to shift people's perception on the matter, much like Guerilla Girls did. Yeah, this is. You know, it's interesting to call it iconoclastic because almost back to what Skomra was saying here, or this idea of surrealism and decontextualizing.
00:07:47.183 - 00:08:37.691, Speaker A: Like, I've been watching these lectures on the. I think it's called the Civilizations on the Steps or something to this effect. And I think in the Byzantine Empire, if I'm not mistaken, around 800 or 900 AD and you learn a lot of what happened in between 500 and 1100 by learning about the Vikings and the civilizations on the steps or the nomad people of the steppes is actually probably a better way to put it. And there's a war for 100, 150 years on iconoclasm, on whether we should have images or not, and people were killing each other over this. And so it's kind of interesting when you think you know, nicely worded here, quasi. And it is a kind of iconoclasm, one could argue. I mean, you're breaking images, right? Or at least you're kind of.
00:08:37.691 - 00:09:23.109, Speaker A: You know, you're almost. Again, if you decontextualize what they're doing and you forget, like, what is the. And what do I mean by that? Like, the manifest content is just, stop oil. We're protesting because the museum either supports the oil companies or gets support from oil companies or has people on the board from oil companies, right? Takes oil money and therefore is somehow accepting that oil should continue to be used when it's going to conflict with our environmental principles. So that's the manifest content, right? That's the rational explanation of what's actually going on. But then you could argue what's the unconscious content. You see people doing the same action from a body perspective, or like, hey, we're destroying images.
00:09:23.109 - 00:10:15.479, Speaker A: We're taking a hammer to a image and all this sort of thing, right? So then you start going, are there. You know, to take a psychoanalytic interpretation as far as the decoding, Is there an unconscious motivation here? What is the real motivation for these actions? Right? And then you start to go, is there something else kind of going on here? Is it almost religious? You know, you almost start to get. So it's interesting. Let's continue. I can even recall Augusto Boll's Invisible Theater as a kind of intervention that could contaminate the social imaginary more effectively than the force they're using. And this is kind of what it's all about, isn't it? The social imagination, the collective, like the discussion. It's sort of like another way of putting it is, what are we thinking about? Right? And so.
00:10:15.479 - 00:10:31.955, Speaker A: And that kind of impacts greatly what happens externally. So interesting. Great thoughts as usual. Thanks once again for this journal. Thank you. Quasi Objecto. A very nicely worded, thoughtful comment there.
00:10:31.955 - 00:10:41.535, Speaker A: Also on Twitter. Thank you for the massive response here. Yanlucas Migone Banger video. Thank you. Neural Divine. Amazing show. Thank you.
00:10:41.535 - 00:10:53.277, Speaker A: Filippo Francocci. Great show. Thank you again. Has Dribble waffle. Thank you. Poco Wise Blood is an interpretation of the novel by O'Connor with modern twists. So I believe that was the work with the flag.
00:10:53.277 - 00:11:49.415, Speaker A: And then there was American flag that Waffles did with all of the kind of scenes on top of it. Awesome segment on Shohei and who we started the show with there. You're making great maps. D rive of the visual zeitgeist. Well, thank you. It's kind of interesting, isn't it? It's kind of delightfully interesting to start to try and go okay now we've kind of made a few connections between some digital pieces and we've also brought the physical in like probably it's been two years probably. But where now it's like okay, and then what else can we start to kind of correlate here? What else can we start to say? You know, so it starts to get interesting because then all of a sudden you start to end up in generational territory in terms of oh, is this just kind of the spirit of a new generation is another way of kind of framing it right when you go beyond the digital.
00:11:49.415 - 00:12:01.211, Speaker A: So very interesting. Thank you for the comment. Waffles. Always wonderful to hear from you. Blue Alley. Thanks for the mention. Last week you'd asked how I'd progress from trying digital after trad art recall.
00:12:01.211 - 00:12:31.053, Speaker A: As soon as paint was available I was already playing with it and seen early CAD3D rotations helped with later sculpture obsession young access so now first tries at NFT mints simply simple oversaturated colors for from basic Photoshop phone procreate because who doesn't love glorious blast of black lip beauty. To be continued. Well, looking forward to seeing that Blue Alley. Thank you for the comment. Kels. Nice one. Really love the opening and all the works by O Sugoi.
00:12:31.053 - 00:12:41.919, Speaker A: I assume that is a greeting in Japanese. So and again there is that wonderful artist there. Continue. Yo Salazar. Thank you for the comment. Dagmar, thank you for the comment. Relax.
00:12:41.919 - 00:12:53.695, Speaker A: Make art that makes you happy. Indeed. Andre. Yo. Let's go. Great to hear from you Andre. Summer Blues, Ilya, Barabin yo and Helmort can you give a look at to my art? Thanks.
00:12:53.695 - 00:13:11.051, Speaker A: That is what the community is for where we're gonna go right away. So if you want to. If you want me to look at your art post in the community, I'd check it before every show. Check Mashka Mashka Love Shohei's work. What a surprise to see on the show. Well that's great. I'm glad it's surprising.
00:13:11.051 - 00:13:46.105, Speaker A: It shouldn't be a huge shocker because it's been I've shown quite a bit of their work but I mean I guess not everybody's watched all, you know, however many hours this, you know we've recorded here. But yeah like we've looked at probably over I'd say a year and a half ago was when we first started looking at Shohei's work. But it's more in the at the end When I do a bit more of the physical art. It's interesting that structure. I. I sometimes get tempted to break that structure that I have for this show where it kind of starts with kind of like more painterly generally and then it goes to. Towards pixel art and then it goes towards glitch.
00:13:46.105 - 00:14:01.305, Speaker A: It's hard to break actually. Like you can but it always kind of makes more sense to me. And then AI and then physicals. It's kind of interesting. Anyways, let's look at the community. Thank you everybody for the comments. Print sketch so we have a few works here.
00:14:01.305 - 00:14:16.013, Speaker A: So some drawings. Thank you for posting that. And make sure I think we have only post once per week. Print sketch if you can. Just to give everybody kind of space here. Thank you for posting. Azerdi Betamax thank you for posting.
00:14:16.013 - 00:14:38.369, Speaker A: This is on Manifold xyz. So interesting Kind of phasing of the moon minted fully on chain 100% code. Wow, that's impressive. So that is Azerty Betamax 369 entering web3. So here kind of animated abstract in black and white and print sketch once again. Zizo. Thank you for the post.
00:14:38.369 - 00:14:59.349, Speaker A: Looks like a procreate drawing. If I had to venture a guess that's on object Lego X with some cool. Kind of looks like pixel art. Interesting kind of primary or at least kind of like the basic digital colors. Almost looks like there's AI in here but hard to. Hard to if it's not AI. I have no idea how these were made.
00:14:59.349 - 00:15:19.915, Speaker A: Very interesting work to work in progress. Kind of looks like a manga here with diagrams. Interesting combination static drama. Thank you for posting the work. Looks like 3D and Glitch in black and white that's on rodeo and that is called the runner. Peteral I thought this was super interesting. This is actually later in the show.
00:15:19.915 - 00:15:45.115, Speaker A: And look at this. 60 edited kerned Rom corruption. And it's almost like taking one of those little hexadecimals, one of those little ROM squares and then kind of minimally going in and tinkering with it. Kind of very minimal approach. Like let's just take one of these things I think is what's going on here and then start to add and. And subtract pixels. Very interesting concept.
00:15:45.115 - 00:16:10.015, Speaker A: Nice colors too. Like nice. Very interesting work. Vincent Law thank you for posting a work in progress in abstract and Mamadou so unstoppable by Santiago and Sal and so here I think we may have seen and have a minimal day. So cool collaboration there. 369 with an animated abstract and time we saw this one. So thank you everybody for posting.
00:16:10.015 - 00:16:42.145, Speaker A: This is pretty interesting. We haven't seen too much on this topic for a while. Psilocybin, often magic mushrooms. Single dose of psilocybin found to physically change the human brain. It's something that's been speculated on that we talked about that other people were posting about, maybe similar accounts actually that we'll see in a second here. But it's a conversation that keeps coming back. This idea of the brain with psilocybin being able to create new neural connections, it kind of explain would explain a lot.
00:16:42.145 - 00:17:12.149, Speaker A: A pre print study has shown for the first time that a single 25 milligram dose of psilocybin causes physical changes in the human brain. I thought they already knew this. At least they had imaging that showed before and after. So I always get confused by stuff like for the first time is it the. You know, so physical changes. Results showed anatomical functional brain changes were detected from one hour to one month after the administration. Interesting.
00:17:12.149 - 00:17:53.333, Speaker A: It was the 25 milligram dose, not the 1 milligram dose. Of course, do your own research and these are just studies that I'm saying here. While numerous studies have shown that psilocybin can produce profound psychological changes in humans, this is the first study to show that the brain is physically altered after consumption. And Dr. Robin Cart Harris, a prominent account, explained that physical changes observed were in two prefrontal cortex to subcortex tracts which became more compact one month after the dose and that there was no change after placebo. We didn't know what it means, but it was a solid change. The brain contained cells that stretch across it like wires or cables.
00:17:53.333 - 00:18:15.281, Speaker A: A fat collection of cables from the front to the middle looked thinner or more tightly packed. One month after people took a big dose of magic mushroom powder. We don't know if it's a good or a bad thing. And I think here it is. We don't know if it's a good or a bad thing. Big dose of magic mushroom powder. We don't know if it's a good or a bad thing.
00:18:15.281 - 00:18:47.909, Speaker A: But on average people were happier one month after and could think better. So interesting anecdotal data there too. So kind of just feeds into that whole theory, doesn't it? Very briefly here, best booths at Art Basel Paris from ARTnews. And so of course here, just this beautiful space here, as you can see, what a space. And here, just a quick look at Frida Terenzo Jaeger at Takeaishi Gallery almost Looks like an altarpiece. Some painting. Not sure of the year on that.
00:18:47.909 - 00:19:03.007, Speaker A: And here was kind of a weird one. Rene Green at Portolami. And so I guess this is the art piece. A scene. And then there's a projector. So pretty conceptual on that front. Bianca Bondi at Mort Charpentier.
00:19:03.007 - 00:19:30.601, Speaker A: And here looks like a little kind of bathroom medicine cabinet or something with plants and objects. A purse, maybe exotic elixir. That's 2024 by Bianca Bondi. Ke mazu at roh Projects. Maybe a textile work. And these weird or unusual pieces ground this. Ulan Gallen at Luring Augustine and Kurimanzuto.
00:19:30.601 - 00:19:45.953, Speaker A: Pretty nice piece. I think this. Yeah. 1987. Los complices. And that is great. Love how they painted this beautiful carpet that you'll often see in maybe Latin American works or in Latin America and just the world.
00:19:45.953 - 00:19:59.051, Speaker A: Hunter Reynolds at PPOW. Rey Navarro's Bed of Morning Flowers. So 1990 and 2018. Interesting. Small works from a larger piece. Sorry, large piece from smaller works. It looks like Wanda Pimental.
00:19:59.051 - 00:20:30.653, Speaker A: Almost looks like an illustration you could see on Object, doesn't it? Interesting. And Cameron Rowland at Maxwell Graham. So definitely more on the conceptual side on this front and that is it. So just a little taste of what's going on there. Continuing on, Patrick Ammidon. L2s are designed to offload throughput and reduce costs, not for long term storage of tokenized art. And of course there's been a ton of usage of base for art and I think Shape.
00:20:30.653 - 00:20:56.797, Speaker A: Right? I mean as far as I understand, shape is an L2. I still don't know the main platform. I think it's Highlight xyz, but I'm not positive. While they serve as a short term fix for scaling issues, they aren't built for the permanent secure preservation that art demands. They are a temporary solution until more sustainable technologies emerge. And it does seem that way. Like if you're going to Mint, it's sort of as this account here says.
00:20:56.797 - 00:21:27.167, Speaker A: Rick Mint Manilius. This is also why I'm somewhat shocked to see so much of the EVM Ethereum virtual machine inscriptions. Moving to L2 for scaling, I get the cost is one to three orders of magnitude cheaper, but you just increase the risk from 10 to 1000x if the data needs to exist for more than 10 years. Use Bitcoin east layer 1 or Arweave. Interestingly, Arweave now, not IPFS. Interestingly. So all pretty interesting.
00:21:27.167 - 00:21:57.695, Speaker A: It's hard to disagree with that. Yeah, art, it doesn't feel as precious from My perspective to buy something on a L2. So interesting. Flexosaurus rex Art and artists who, of course I follow Art and artists on Tezos will be one of the leaders the next art super cycle. Forget about memes. So the next art super cycle, whenever that is. It's hard to imagine that there won't be some pretty big action on Tazos.
00:21:57.695 - 00:22:25.671, Speaker A: You know, again, by not screwing up super badly, Tezos has, you know, by keeping it accessible, I'd say object not screwing things up with. Every day that you don't screw up, it's like credibility grows. And that's kind of what's happened I think with object. Here we are three years later. I mean we're in 2024. When was object started like two and a half years ago. But on artists, you'll feel a whole lot better in the end.
00:22:25.671 - 00:22:55.729, Speaker A: And indeed it is a good feeling. Buying it still sells well as we see. I mean it kind of impresses me. It's never ever just gone silent on the blockchain as far as buying and selling work or buying work. Like the collectors have never just said enough of this. Interestingly bookmarked this tweet and I think it's the art and it's just quite a good experience, you know, buying art that you like. Right, Robin SV3 the blockchain has been compared to the printing press many times.
00:22:55.729 - 00:23:22.125, Speaker A: So when I hear someone doing some fancy contract trick with that art, I kind of laugh because it's like, look, my book has pop out pages never been done before advancing what's possible with books. So. And I think the point. I think there's something to be said for the blockchain as a medium for sure. But I think Robness is pointing out that it can. It very easily devolves into novelty. Right? If you're.
00:23:22.125 - 00:23:56.123, Speaker A: If it's just about new for the sake of new, but not because there's some sort of justification, so to speak, then it, you know, quickly goes into novelty. So interesting comment. Maybe a little unfair to some works that have used fancy contracts, but I get it, I get it. And I think there's something to be said also for what Robness is saying there. Little cakes. Super happy to have met Kazuhiro Ehara in real life. Today at the group show in Otamachi, his Germans project doing AI to handmade physical clothing is really great fashion.
00:23:56.123 - 00:24:36.435, Speaker A: Look at these screens. You know what it reminds me of? And it looks like there may even be four that are vertical being put together here. You know what this reminds me of is you know, and many artists do this, but David Hockney being the obvious example, you know, putting several small canvases together to make a huge canvas. In a sense, the same thing happening here with the TVs. You can, in a sense, we complain sometimes, right, about this. The ratio of TV monitors, 16 by 9. Pretty awkward, right? However, if you just get enough TVs together, you can almost make whatever shape you want.
00:24:36.435 - 00:24:56.325, Speaker A: You know, using that kind of principle, you're going to have these borders of the monitor frames. But it is a solvable problem, as you see here. Quite interesting. You are not stuck necessarily to the ratio of the screen to the 16 by 9. So very cool. And here was another photo from the show. Maybe showing is this.
00:24:56.325 - 00:25:13.925, Speaker A: It's like a work. Is this AI clothing? So who knows? Looks like a great show. Interesting post from little kicks Dr. Lee NFT. Seeing these work up. Seeing these works up close today was something special. Don't think many people fully appreciate what Alpha Centauri Kid is creating here.
00:25:13.925 - 00:25:40.315, Speaker A: Proudly donning my Ack Alpha Centauri Kid PFP and Respect Piano Blossoms is stunning body of work. I brought it up close. I'm trying to figure out what's going on here. It looks like some pretty interesting textures. Like I'd love to see this in person. You see here, it kind of looks like, if I had to venture a guess here, this looks like it's actually printed on aluminum and that it's actually kind of mounted. But I could be wrong.
00:25:40.315 - 00:25:57.569, Speaker A: Like it almost looks like it's mounted in this frame, this thing here. But I can't tell. Or maybe it's just one big print, it's hard to say. But I also feel like I see shadow there. Interesting piece. And I think there's another one. Just see if I can bring that up here.
00:25:57.569 - 00:26:13.291, Speaker A: As you see here, you see there we see the shadow again. So I would if I had to guess, it's printed on aluminum. Interesting works. I don't know anything about them, but interesting look. This was also interesting. Clown vamp AI Art taking over Sotheby. I didn't hear about that.
00:26:13.291 - 00:26:39.989, Speaker A: Botto Dow on the fourth floor held Cohen on the first. And what you'll see here is actually pretty interesting. So the. This is a posthumous minting. So here you have the physical and as you see here, I assume that is Harold Cohen who signed this. But it totally reminds me of the here the Harold Cohen Trust are the ones who minted the NFTs. And what does that remind you of? Keith Haring.
00:26:39.989 - 00:27:21.553, Speaker A: Anyone remember that the whole Keith Haring controversy with the foundation minting the works that were found and then selling it as an nft. So it's always. Yeah. So I think, as I put it, I think during the whole Keith Haring controversy, I think it's fine as long as it's attributed properly. And the attribution here should be minted by the Harold Cohen foundation, or Harold Cohen Trust, as it says here, rather than Harold Cohen. So I assume they do that. But if you were to sell an nft, though, as Harold Cohen that he didn't mint, well, then it's not exactly accurate.
00:27:21.553 - 00:27:46.387, Speaker A: Right. So I assume Harold Cohen Trust, just like it should be the Keith Haring foundation. That means. And that, I think would affect the value, one would think, because the problem with this whole thing of other people minting art, then all of a sudden the Magritte foundation can come out and, oh, we're going to sell all of Magritte. And is that really worth anything? Right. Then you have the. Is the Mona Lisa next? And who's going to.
00:27:46.387 - 00:28:18.415, Speaker A: Is it the government of Italy or is it the Louvre that's going to mint the. You know, so it becomes a slippery slope. So therefore I'm kind of. I have a more, I'd say, cautious sort of approach where it's like, if the artist didn't mint it, the art mint it kind of end of story is sort of how I see it anyway. Interesting. So this was at Sotheby's. Were there any other images here? Yeah, so this was also, I think, Harold Cohen here and here it looks like a talk.
00:28:18.415 - 00:28:44.521, Speaker A: So interesting. So, AI, art at Sotheby's here, just a nice video by Santiago, as you see. Beautiful. See the talent here by Santiago. He actually gave me three small works like this in when I was in Buenos Aires. Like, you see how. How just beautiful this is.
00:28:44.521 - 00:29:06.595, Speaker A: And you see the ink starting to run out of the paint and still working with it. And just how careful, the dexterity. So just beautiful video here by Santiago. The poetry. The poetry process. This is super interesting. So here's Axine and a very, very interesting piece.
00:29:06.595 - 00:29:35.697, Speaker A: Classic, traveling through the medium. So here, what do we have here? You have a gif, right? But this gif, interestingly, is made from this. And I think I brought it up large. Let me see. It's made from this physical, right? But how did you get to this physical? You got to this physical by making a gif, if you follow me. Right, so. Right.
00:29:35.697 - 00:30:01.711, Speaker A: Because how would you get this? Like, what is this? This is a physical rendition of a gif. Of a skull that's turning. And here you have 3 times 5, 15 skulls. So there's probably 15 frames to make that gif. Xine then turns that into a physical. Looks like one page screen print. As you can see, the paint is getting dragged across here, the purple and then the blue gets dragged across here.
00:30:01.711 - 00:30:43.245, Speaker A: And then you see a little bit of purple. Probably two colors, if I had to guess, maybe three. And so putting, you know, what it looks like, it looks like the dark color was done first, and then together the purple and the blue, cerulean blue were done on top is actually what that looks like. And so starting with a digital, going to physical and kind of almost, you know, for lack of better term, deconstructing it, even though that's not really the right way to use that. And then reassembling it to create this gif here. Right. So pretty awesome, actually.
00:30:43.245 - 00:30:59.725, Speaker A: I mean, quite an interesting. Again, traveling through the mediums here. It's like alchemical, as I like to say. On to the artwork. So this was a head turner for sure. Repeated Nature by Zuo. Fabulous work.
00:30:59.725 - 00:31:37.425, Speaker A: Just captures the imagination, doesn't it? I love the end here too. Right here. Just gorgeous. Kind of mysterious. Pretty amazing. Only 25 tezos on secondary sold out at 15 tezos. So you can actually get it for.
00:31:37.425 - 00:32:05.335, Speaker A: There's a bit of a listing war, so to speak, here, so you maybe you can make an offer and get it even cheaper. Gorgeous work from Zozo. Love the title there too. Here's Martin Bruce, Pot and Snake. So kind of classic to a certain degree in its unpredictability. You have a Martin Bruce work which looks like a photo and then this plot. Pot maybe photoshopped on top, maybe not.
00:32:05.335 - 00:32:37.362, Speaker A: And just like above the ground or above the rock here, so you see a little bit of shadow and then you see a snake that looks like it's drawn in with a big shadow. And then the tree, and again everything looks fuzzed out. And then this kind of gifization of it, kind of adding a kind of noise of a certain kind. Pot and Snake, just really cool. 900 by 1108. Just minted, but not listed. More fascinating work from such a cool artist n 1914.
00:32:37.362 - 00:33:08.419, Speaker A: I mean, look at this lineup. Zo, Martin Bruce, Nev, 1914, Pescador and Una Kamisa Roja Obra Denico P. So maybe that is so Nico P. I think, is the artist who I haven't heard of. And yeah, another just beautiful work here by now of 1914. Kind of looks like someone fishing Is that a saint? Is that a halo in the water? And then classic Nev 1914 kind of line there. I've come to really.
00:33:08.419 - 00:33:37.335, Speaker A: I think a lot of people do. I've come to really just love these little lines and look at how beautiful the legs are. And again, this kind of dark and light gradients here and this wild background. You see so many different techniques that NUV has, you know, practiced and worked with all coming together here. And this beautiful. You know, there's a lot of complexity, but then you just have this super simple dress or shirt. Brilliant.
00:33:37.335 - 00:33:52.511, Speaker A: Still available on primary from November 1914. Here's Michi Asu. Michi Asu. Yawn. Many came out works. I just kind of picked one. So here again, just kind of very challenging digital art here.
00:33:52.511 - 00:34:10.153, Speaker A: Playing with this little bit of kind of spectrum, gray and kind of rainbow esque spectrum here. Almost looks like a ufo. Not sure what's going on. Pretty interesting. Picked up by Olay for 11 tazos. Here's Greg Nikshumika. Seven seven deadly fins.
00:34:10.153 - 00:34:43.105, Speaker A: So rather than seven deadly sins. So again, more Excel work here. And you see the sun reflecting on the water here and then some sharks made of these little triangles here. I love this leaving the cursor in here somewhat. And as well as this stuff leaving the process, it really adds a whole lot to this work and seemingly even an ASCII side to things. I guess you could put ASCII within the Excel. What do they call those? Not margins or cells I think is what you call them.
00:34:43.105 - 00:35:05.106, Speaker A: Very interesting addition of 20 for 3 tazos each. Here is RJ aphorism number one. AI pixel painting collage gif. So seeming to do. We kind of saw a preview of this with adding some writing. The terror of the mind must be dispelled not by the shining darts of daylight, but by the study of light itself. So combining writing.
00:35:05.106 - 00:35:25.321, Speaker A: I think this is a newer project combining writing with image. Interestingly so looking like a forest there. Edition of 10 for 35 tazos. Foregone. And here is Yuri J with a house. I haven't seen this one before. Kind of looks like kind of just working in the studio here.
00:35:25.321 - 00:35:57.487, Speaker A: Kind of reminds you too of that winter work that's I think Yuri has pinned. Is it. Is it the same? Is this work here? No, it's no longer pinned there. There was a winter work that was pinned for a while anyway. Cool work by Uri J. We have another one from the other Urij account Oct.50. Interestingly so more experimentation, repeating layers, textures and kind of looking like the eyeballs, right? Like a cartoon.
00:35:57.487 - 00:36:11.871, Speaker A: And interesting here. So all sorts of experimentation and textures. Look at up here. It's just great. So starting to look a little bit virtuoso. Virtuos. Virtuos.
00:36:11.871 - 00:36:30.591, Speaker A: However, you say that even here you see the paint just kind of flying. Working fast. Very nice. And actually that is an addition of one for 300 tezos. Continuing on, mumble Boy. Youth are us. So incorporating some of these characters in this is a pretty fun one.
00:36:30.591 - 00:36:58.065, Speaker A: And just huge files here. So again, physical digital in combination here. And I think Mumble Boy was mentioning that him and Little Cakes used to watch a show that some of these characters reminded Mumble Boy of Interesting. Here are some. You see the physical collage and maybe Internet jpegization and everything. And interesting text. I can feel it in my bones.
00:36:58.065 - 00:37:25.535, Speaker A: Schizophrenia is taking me home. So interesting piece. Edition of 2 for 15 Tezos. And here is Renny Fish Love Letter. Kind of a fun one. Great audio. I love the birds here.
00:37:25.535 - 00:37:42.105, Speaker A: Cool Love letter Sending cosmic cuddles through a rainbow. Dreamscape edition of 10. And that looks sold out. Nice work at 15 tezos each. And here's human colonel, who I believe is Santiago. Maybe it's a collaboration. Not sure.
00:37:42.105 - 00:38:07.655, Speaker A: Fight the Moon. And this was picked up by Waffles. So interesting background here. And interesting. Kind of fuzzed out. This kind of like classic where it's like, again, the border, the outline is an opportunity for just filling it with different kinds of texture. A very digital technique, isn't it? I mean, I guess you could technically do that with physical.
00:38:07.655 - 00:38:31.131, Speaker A: But it's just there's so many possibilities with digital that maybe it just lends itself more to it. Addition of one. And that went to Waffles for 14 tezos. Speaking of Waffles, here's Cedar Plank, also known as Htruba Waffle. Oh, these are great. Basically taking. And I believe this is Fantavision, if I'm not mistaken, or maybe more than one.
00:38:31.131 - 00:39:03.705, Speaker A: Not sure how many softwares are being used here, but taking the palette here, the digital palette, and then. Or toolbox, I should say, and repeating it using the drawing tools as subject matter. And it looks gorgeous here, too, with the rainbow going up and then some sort of bear that was maybe being worked on. Very interesting piece by waffles, edition of five. And bids are coming in 40 tazos. So the market loves it too. And here we see what looks like the same source image here.
00:39:03.705 - 00:39:32.339, Speaker A: Just kind of a variation on it, right? Looks like just a different improvisation, interestingly. And that is at 35 days OS edition of 5. And here is one more and cedar plank edition of five. And you see a little bit of the kind of the toolbox user interface. And I assume that's Fantavision. Not positive though. And then you see, I almost feel like this might have been taken from another work, but I'm not sure.
00:39:32.339 - 00:40:01.865, Speaker A: Anyway, so you see the dog, rainbow dogs, everything, whatever's going on there. Beautiful work. Kudu kola. It's kudu time when Yuri sleeps. So seemingly a reference to Yuri J here whose work we just saw with the octopus and their interesting painting here by Kudukola is someone comes home and then you see someone playing the piano. Kind of has a Yuri J feel to it. A nice combination of elements here.
00:40:01.865 - 00:40:21.761, Speaker A: Yuri J wants 110 Tezos. The offers are coming in and one transferred already to Yuri J. So cool work by Kudukola and that is 18 Tezos on secondary. Here's PP Universal. Estoy Canado y. So I think a self portrait but I'm not positive on that. Kind of looks like.
00:40:21.761 - 00:40:46.563, Speaker A: Look at that. Look at all the detail there. Look at all the texture and then just the flatness. Interesting piece and interesting white background too. From PP Universal Edition of 5 and sold out at 8 tezos each. And here's Cesar, the dead and the murderer. And this is digital illustration and kind of cool, kind of got an urban feel to it.
00:40:46.563 - 00:41:15.961, Speaker A: Look at that. Rad camouflage, pink camouflage. How cool is that? This looks like a record cover or a CD cover, doesn't it? And you have these great kind of checkerboards or chessboards. Interesting piece of their Cesar the dead and the murderer. I think this is Jake Studios was saying was his brother if I'm not mistaken. Interestingly so you see how small this community is. Edition of one and that went for 25 tezos.
00:41:15.961 - 00:41:40.027, Speaker A: Nice work. Hilarious and gorgeous. And head turning work from the myth. Myth son number 41 and not sure so that went to Skomra for or it's currently being bid by Skomra for 100 Tezos. So definitely a Warhol feel to it. It's like Warhol meets the Mike Tyson tattoo meets the myth or something. A brilliant image.
00:41:40.027 - 00:42:06.615, Speaker A: Even the pink background. Just a gorgeous myth work here. And again kind of screams Warhol, doesn't it? With the wig and the turtleneck. Super interesting series. I love this work. Lemonade with the myth. This is hilarious and it's just kind of fun and it's like, you know what I love about it is like the myth doesn't Take themselves, like overly seriously.
00:42:06.615 - 00:42:29.885, Speaker A: Like, this is a pretty great. Like, it's fun. I like the vibe of this work. The lemonade with the myth head in it. It's just kind of fun and cool lemonade with the myth, but it kind of perfectly fits in with myth's whole kind of, you know, body of work. Super interesting. One of one went for 200 tazos.
00:42:29.885 - 00:43:09.485, Speaker A: So nice work. Untitled portrait of Donald Trump by Wasteman Goldmanovich, often critic of. And so there you see Trump with a hamburger, headphones and a hot dog on top. So you see all the wonder and amazement of a waistband Gold Minovich work. And you see also the beautiful texture in the person and then contrasting with the background that is flat and there in some crocs, which I hear are making a comeback and the flower being mowed over. Not sure what the Oscar Mayer Meyer reference is. Cool piece.
00:43:09.485 - 00:43:31.215, Speaker A: Instantly recognizable too as a Wasteman Gold Minovich edition of 12. And did that sell out? It's on its way. Eight gone. And here is natural tourism Vanitas, still life. Nice painting here. Nice digital painting of, I believe, digital. Pretty sure of a vanitas.
00:43:31.215 - 00:43:58.893, Speaker A: And nice flowers on top here. And love the gray on top of the painted over top of the outline, but you can still see through it. Beautiful. Actually open edition, only two tazos, 25 minted so far. Nice work. And here is Mikael Knowlson with an interesting kind of different kind of abstract here. Usually we see kind of three dimensional, but here we got splotches of paint put on top.
00:43:58.893 - 00:44:21.595, Speaker A: It's kind of got a more like textured kind of almost painterly feel to it. Interestingly abstract there. Here's Macro Metry Croco. This is on Rodeo. And one minted so far. And I think that's it actually. So here, interesting abstract kind of pixel art or digital abstract.
00:44:21.595 - 00:44:46.813, Speaker A: Interesting color here by Macro Metry. Here's Enigmatras. A very cool. I always love sports and I kind of love what's going on here. You see the runners, where you see the shadow of the runners or they're duplicated and then you see the color there. But then the ASCII text on top matching them. Pretty nice.
00:44:46.813 - 00:45:01.469, Speaker A: Again, always kind of being very inventive. Even this what looks like stretched out ASCII underneath. Very inventive work. Look at that. 12,000 views, 66 retweets. And here's Jake Studios. One up, one down.
00:45:01.469 - 00:45:17.125, Speaker A: So a. A cool digital drawing here. Drawing the pixels, so to speak. And there's the cursor. A supreme baseball bat and everything. Interesting digital Artwork I think putting out a lot of work, if I'm not mistaken. Jake Studios.
00:45:17.125 - 00:45:33.295, Speaker A: That's pretty fun too. Almost a Mario reference. And is this object 98? It is pretty nice for object 98. Subtle auction. 35 tezos. Yeah, like pretty nice piece. This is Tokyo Love.
00:45:33.295 - 00:45:54.795, Speaker A: And I guess this is on foundation. It minted a while ago. Okay, so this is an older work. This definitely caught my eye as you see here, just kind of a moody. I think it's a painting, a digital painting. Nice piece here that's on foundation from Tokyo Love. I guess an older work.
00:45:54.795 - 00:46:12.281, Speaker A: And continuing on here's walk. Sleep Like a Lumber. So a mysterious series here. And it looks like maybe someone is sleeping here. So I almost wonder if these are from photographs that Walk has taken this time. Not sure. Edition of one already seven tezos continues to do.
00:46:12.281 - 00:46:31.745, Speaker A: Well, here's someone called Generesis. I think we know Generosis. And quite an interesting piece here. Kind of a head turning work with the color and the bizarre color, the bizarre composition and even this interesting texture here. Very, very unusual piece. This is on Zora 4. Minted so far.
00:46:31.745 - 00:46:41.477, Speaker A: Careful on the Internet. So falling on the Internet. Here is our milk. Still life with web cameras. Very. Look at this. So you see the work in progress.
00:46:41.477 - 00:47:01.013, Speaker A: So here is the colored version. And here it works as both. Interestingly, you know, it gets me thinking, like should both be minted? It raises that. That question again. Should both versions be minted? Very interesting question. Very nice. Pixel art piece by Rmilk.
00:47:01.013 - 00:47:16.325, Speaker A: Still life with web cameras. Where are the web cameras? I see the still life. Maybe there, maybe here. Maybe that's a phone filming it. Low trippy money. So long. And here you see it just kind of interesting.
00:47:16.325 - 00:47:36.945, Speaker A: Almost looks like dinosaurs a la pixel art. And kind of a four to the floor type pixel art look. Almost photographic or video underneath. Edition of 10 for 10 tezos each. Here's Sabato with a compressionist edit. She walks alone in the meadows. 259 kilobytes.
00:47:36.945 - 00:48:20.047, Speaker A: So again, pretty interesting. As you see, it's pretty good to get that down to 259 kilobytes considering all of the frames that are probably in here, here. And then it looks pretty good too. I'm kind of back to what we were just discussing because with digital and again you can make a red and yellow version where the background's red and the pixels are yellow or whatever the case is, you know, should this not be done? This is kind of like what I ask myself, should there be, you know, 50 different versions of this. It would affect the collectibility, one would imagine. Right. You know, but nevertheless, it just kind of opens a question.
00:48:20.047 - 00:48:35.407, Speaker A: Like, I mean, is, what about the art? Like, should these be. Should we have 30 different ones? Or maybe do five? Maybe like our milk. You do two. Right. So maybe there's a balance there somewhere. This is pretty interesting. Green Ginger.
00:48:35.407 - 00:49:18.025, Speaker A: This is manually pixelated by hand, 100% on chain. Now, I'm not sure if this is on base, and I wonder if this is what Amadon is talking about. Like, was this done as on chain? On base? Now, I would say if you're going to put work on base, you almost might as well make it on chain. Right? Like, why? And then get IPFs, you might as well just put it on chain. So interesting piece here, all on chain. And here you see almost like what looks like a video game kind of, but three cubes put together, almost like text down here in these dialog boxes. And then in the middle of this kind of universe, very interesting piece.
00:49:18.025 - 00:49:34.770, Speaker A: 350 by 350 animated SVG. And apparently SVG is a way of getting things pretty small. I wonder what the five frames. I wonder. Finally here, this is the metadata. I wonder how big this is. 24.4
00:49:34.770 - 00:49:44.807, Speaker A: kilobytes. There we go. So only 24 kilobytes for five frames. That's pretty good. That's about right. 350 by 350. It's multicolor though.
00:49:44.807 - 00:50:03.031, Speaker A: So that's where the SVG maybe is saving some space. Game over. Supper's ready. That's Sachoo, the arty. So a pixel artist we've discovered recently. Always seems like the circuit boards are coming out from beneath whatever is being shown, whatever is being depicted. Here.
00:50:03.031 - 00:50:20.053, Speaker A: A basketball court that's empty. That's edition of 10 for 33 Tezos. Did that sell out? It did at 10 Tezos. Here's Anis Abdin. Fallout pixel art. 12 colors, kind of looking like a cave. Very kind of head turning, work with light.
00:50:20.053 - 00:50:35.445, Speaker A: This is almost like crate where you'd go down, except you wouldn't have as nice a step. Yeah. So yeah, this is just like going down into a cellar or something. Cool work by Anisabt. Look at this. Brilliant work by me. Pixel.
00:50:35.445 - 00:50:59.621, Speaker A: This is really going somewhere here. I mean, how many colors is this? Four colors. And you see, I love the depiction here. Let me see if I can get this 100%, because sometimes we get distorted here. Pretty interesting pixel art. It continues to develop here. And yeah, what I like is kind of what's being left out.
00:50:59.621 - 00:51:21.757, Speaker A: You know, like you don't have everything here. There are decisions that are being made here. To simplify this, I think the color is super interesting here. Like very interesting. Like, and it works like you have this mauve, you have this deep purple and then you have like the white and then almost like this red purple. Interesting work there. Here's Mech.
00:51:21.757 - 00:51:36.429, Speaker A: TXT with a two color 120 by 210 reignition. I'd love to see this. At 180 by 210. It must be tiny. One bit. 20 editions. And that is at 27 tezos.
00:51:36.429 - 00:51:59.231, Speaker A: And they are coming in and I think you can still get them. There is one left if you hurry. And it looks like a candle, doesn't it? So cool pixel art there from Mech. Txt Michael macasso Reignition. Maybe that means a whole bunch of works are coming. Mark Travail So another interesting pixel artist using yellow and black a lot. And I guess there's some gray here too.
00:51:59.231 - 00:52:22.775, Speaker A: Kind of a fun interesting piece that was posted on X. And Here's Manadil and P1. And this is hand pixelated and animated. 636 kilobytes. Original Dimension 171. Again, tempted to think like on chain. I need to find that object or the link for the experimental Tezos on chain.
00:52:22.775 - 00:52:45.101, Speaker A: Take admit one. So here we go. Kind of a comic book format. Kind of a comic book format with the cats and the tickets. So we see a narrative here and kind of fun, right? So just kind of pretty cool pixel art. Very minimal colors here. Interestingly, these kind of rich grays.
00:52:45.101 - 00:53:08.117, Speaker A: Hand Pixelated and animated 171 by 171. Interesting, but scaled up. That pinball guy. Brgr Time intro. I thought this was kind of interesting because as you see here, it kind of looks like a picture of a screen as you can see on the edge here. So it's a picture of a console. It's a picture of a depiction of a console.
00:53:08.117 - 00:53:37.809, Speaker A: Right? And then the console is depicting a burger. Right? So. And then it's with ascii. So kind of an interesting kind of meta going on here with the picture of the pit. The picture of the picture really. And the picture of the video game depicting the picture of the depiction of the video game that is portraying a burger. Like there's a lot going on here is what I am trying to say here.
00:53:37.809 - 00:54:02.993, Speaker A: Edition of One for 15 Tezos. That pinball guy here's Pet Errol. So we saw in the Intro here. Again, looking like minimal extraction from a glitch rom and then perhaps starting to paint in each one of these little pixels here. Interestingly, Kerned Rom Corruption 64x64, only 13 kilobytes. Very cool. Here is Louie.
00:54:02.993 - 00:54:19.459, Speaker A: Now, we saw this work by Gozo and it's very important. A playful homage, tribute, remix. Always put the artist here just to note in case, because someone could come to this the first time and think and just not know. Right. And then they have no idea where it comes from. Offspring. So pleasant landscape.
00:54:19.459 - 00:54:37.029, Speaker A: There is a history. Where was it derived? All art comes from other art. But nevertheless, if it's obvious it should be. You should definitely put Gozo. But anyways, it looks great. The piece looks pretty cool and you can tell how much that work resonated with people. That's the second homage we've seen and the work just came out last week.
00:54:37.029 - 00:55:09.671, Speaker A: I mean, amazing. So here Louis putting some works up. It's an important thing. It's interesting. The reason why I'm so kind of big on the credit, first of all, just out of principle, of course, but there's also like, the visual arts is weird in the sense that music, if this was music and you were covering a song, 80% of the royalties, I think, or something along those lines. Maybe 50 to 8, like goes to the original and then. Yeah.
00:55:09.671 - 00:55:21.215, Speaker A: And so. And I don't know if you need permission or not. I don't know how it works these days. There are so many covers of everything these days. But you don't get that in the visual arts. So. Yeah.
00:55:21.215 - 00:55:43.897, Speaker A: So I'd say, anyway, gorgeous work from Louis DJ Kiro Ecto. Interesting square canvas. Interesting negative space here. Another interesting video painting, I think, based off of AI outputs, I think is how it works. Quite original. I mean, quite a body of work that Kiro's put together here. Kyle Flemmer, Chosen Family.
00:55:43.897 - 00:56:04.105, Speaker A: And it looks like Pikachu. I'm not going to leave this on too long in case people have issues with Flashing images. Edition of 12. And that is at 666. And it looks like it's almost sold out. Here's Kiro again with Ranix Deer. So some new video paintings here using, I think some of Rannick Steer's gradients.
00:56:04.105 - 00:56:20.439, Speaker A: Very nice and minimal. Just love it. Cool colors here too. Edition of 10. And that is 550 and 2 gone. Here is a beautiful work by Exmortal Sundays. And look at that.
00:56:20.439 - 00:56:53.487, Speaker A: A different kind of glitch, isn't it? A different kind of glitch. We have the same kind of coast beautiful kind of source image but really nice kind of clean wavy glitch edition of seven that is sold out I think or just transferred maybe to other collectors. Here's another one by Exmortal and this is sold out. So X Mortal doing very well here at 1666. A lot of glitch collectors. Look at that great. Whatever is going on over here on the left almost looks like a car on fire or something.
00:56:53.487 - 00:57:06.023, Speaker A: Not sure. Look at the beautiful sky. This great textured landscape here. Kind of complementary colors. And here is Joda. I could be in this place forever. So a beautiful highly textured work here.
00:57:06.023 - 00:57:26.435, Speaker A: And not exactly sure what it is. Looks like an abstract but not sure. 1200 by 900. And that is 20 tazos edition of one. And here is Nebular organic links device. And with some audio. Some more nature.
00:57:26.435 - 00:57:51.851, Speaker A: I like the audio. Interesting. So that work is on object edition of 10. And I think that sold out if I'm not mistaken at six tazos. So the market hums along here. Glitch Town Arcade edition of one. And I'm not going to leave this on too long but we see kind of that hexadecimal there.
00:57:51.851 - 00:58:19.739, Speaker A: And this went at auction for only three tazos. But selling just like walk there Renki Omi and is the name of the work. So this was kind of a different Renki work because you almost see keeping like the selection so to speak. I wish I could pause this. There's almost like this little light selection that you see around these shapes. So Reinke almost keeping part of their process. They're not listing as usual.
00:58:19.739 - 00:58:32.363, Speaker A: I think August Ground. August Ground shared this work. St. Sebastian. So here now I think St. Sebastian was full of arrows. Weren't they on the pole? So you don't really see.
00:58:32.363 - 00:58:43.845, Speaker A: Maybe that's an arrow. Maybe that's an arrow. Not sure. Addition of one that's by Raz Alhaig and August Ground. Picking that up for 450 tazos. Wow. Big sale.
00:58:43.845 - 00:58:59.565, Speaker A: Big sale. This was cool. Skarmor. I think this is from the series called Internet Artists. I'm not positive about it though. Something we've commented a lot on Internet Artists so pretty cool piece. I think it's from that series.
00:58:59.565 - 00:59:16.145, Speaker A: This artist on the canvas. I think that's what Skomar was saying. Here's another work. Choose the Bears by Skomra. This is on Object. So again we're in AI here. So stable diffusion and some just kind of a weird one.
00:59:16.145 - 00:59:32.585, Speaker A: Weird. Interesting mark making in the sky and what looks like a bear. And even how the frame colors are beautiful. The frame weirdly cropped. Interesting piece. And here's Kennek Zapata with a couple of works. This also sold.
00:59:32.585 - 00:59:53.063, Speaker A: Huge work as you see here. Quite beautiful by the super interesting glitch artist. I think you could call them artists that does glitch. And that sold for 20 tazos. Here's another one edition of one and we'll see how that did. Look at all these beautiful colors. So interesting.
00:59:53.063 - 01:00:04.473, Speaker A: AI from Canxapita. That also sold for 20 tezos. This was brilliant. I missed this one. This was from 2022. First syndrome. Absolutely love this piece by Sol Gustick.
01:00:04.473 - 01:00:25.577, Speaker A: Prompt Engineers. I agree. This is one of those works that you almost want to. You could put on the COVID of the book on AI or like. Definitely deserves its own page. Brilliant. You see people making prompts with AI and computers made by AI I picked up one of these.
01:00:25.577 - 01:00:42.083, Speaker A: Is great find from First Syndrome. And the artist is again the artist. Let me just make sure to get. That is cell gruestic Generosis. Who of course. Wow. So nice work by Generosis.
01:00:42.083 - 01:00:58.841, Speaker A: That was from October 2022, I think. Or at least the end of 2022. Interesting piece here from Lily Illo. Almost looking like photographic. Like it's almost three dimensional. The detail is quite something. So as you see here.
01:00:58.841 - 01:01:19.605, Speaker A: And I think they're of twins. So really nice painting there by Lily Illo. And here is Martin. Martin Jo, who of course I follow with hanging out in the private chat with the kinky bears there and having coffee. Pretty cool AI artwork. And here is Toucan. I'm a voodoo child and I follow Toucan.
01:01:19.605 - 01:01:38.415, Speaker A: Very interesting experimental AI here. As you see with the textures. Here's Human Boy. Another Sunrise playing with AI and user interfaces interestingly. And that's an addition of 5 absurd deity. Picking up one. Here's no hygiene with more super experimental AI artwork.
01:01:38.415 - 01:01:53.417, Speaker A: And this is brand new and kind of like a burger for a head. Wild selection here. T shirt everything. Wildwork 3 tazos edition of 10. Into the physicals we go. Gao hang by. It's not gallery.
01:01:53.417 - 01:02:07.633, Speaker A: I don't think we've looked at this one. But a fascinating work. Love the bright pink background. And again looking like some sort of video game character being painted. Right. Super interesting faux Tableau. Alan Fears limited edition.
01:02:07.633 - 01:02:28.235, Speaker A: So there's some prints by this artist. So kind of really fits in with that other artist who does the transformer like robots. So here's Faux Tableau with A burning car. Kind of a common theme. And here's someone with a cast and someone drawing on the cast. Beautiful painting. I guess these are prints.
01:02:28.235 - 01:02:53.683, Speaker A: Gularama, D Acrylic and marker on canvas. Really nicely executed here. As you see. Combining some paint, classic sort of technique to make things interesting. If you're trying to make things interesting, add a color and then just start to mix and you, you know, and it becomes a lot more interesting. The paint kind of a classic. I'd argue contemporary painting technique among others.
01:02:53.683 - 01:03:11.717, Speaker A: So cool work there. Crawling back to you, Gularama. Also, I reworked this painting from 2021 as so interesting piece here too. Interesting kind of. I'm not sure if that's fire. Warm colors and they like it now. Acrylic enamel paint, marker on canvas.
01:03:11.717 - 01:03:31.101, Speaker A: Only a foot by a foot or 12 inches by 12 inches. So small painting here is dye with the most likes with a pretty nice piece here. Outback Steakhouse and someone eating probably ground beef or something. Very nice painting. You see the combination of color that we saw. Bundozo, Bandido, St. George and the Dragon.
01:03:31.101 - 01:03:40.345, Speaker A: I thought this was awesome. Loved. I don't know if they. This is the finished version of the work. I kind of hope it is. I don't think we've looked at this one. Awesome.
01:03:40.345 - 01:04:04.035, Speaker A: Totally awesome. Just so prolific, this artist. This was super interesting, too. Julia Wachtell, prominent contemporary artist from my ongoing series of Little Tornado paintings. So definitely has a interesting, kind of a grabbing narrative painting here. Just really interesting. The content itself is grabbing and painted quite beautifully.
01:04:04.035 - 01:04:20.847, Speaker A: Nice piece. And here's Halloween or Candyman by Tim Lahan. As we approach Halloween here, I'm not sure if that's on black paper. I think it's probably white paper. But coloring right to the edge there seemingly. And that is your show, my friends. Thank you for joining me.
01:04:20.847 - 01:04:26.255, Speaker A: I am getting it shorter here at only an hour and four minutes. Till next time. Take care.
