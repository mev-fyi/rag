00:00:04.560 - 00:00:29.234, Speaker A: Welcome back, everyone. The Antiques Roadshow meets Blade Runner, your one of a kind show, back on January 27, 2023. This is Artists Journal. This is Adrian Pokebelly's artist journal. This is not a news show. It is not a news show. It's literally my journal, my artist's journal.
00:00:29.234 - 00:01:02.204, Speaker A: Once in a while I talk about my art in my artist journal, but here and there, I mean, there's so much going on like we see here. I mean, you know, I leave my Tezos wallet empty too often and then I'm just scrambling because another, you know, masterpiece has showed up on my door, has crossed my desk over here. So anyways, Sabato with another stunner. A cathedral. And actually the write up was awesome here. Happy Friday, everybody. Welcome back.
00:01:02.204 - 00:01:13.224, Speaker A: I'm gonna. Again, I'm trying to shorten these episodes a little bit. So first cathedral. It is just a facade. I love that. It is just a facade. Created in deluxe paint.
00:01:13.224 - 00:01:45.804, Speaker A: Four and an amiga emulated on an emulated amiga, a 1200 computer, part of the chrome period drawing series. So anyways, just a gorgeous, gorgeous work. Again, I scrambled to get one. Luckily my offer was taken for 15, but I mean, addition of 40. So not a small addition, right? I mean, and sold out for nine. And there are a few left, of course, but not really, only on secondary. And yeah, I bought mine for 15, eight.
00:01:45.804 - 00:02:11.872, Speaker A: So in there, web links, you know, it's the whole scene over here, it's the gang doctor version. Aylay. So anyways, we're having a ton of fun over here, as per usual, with some wonderful, wonderful art. I mean, I don't know if much needs to be said here. It's just beautiful. It's just a facade. So enough said, as Stan Lee would say.
00:02:11.872 - 00:02:41.608, Speaker A: Continuing on. What is up? So Flora Marquez, she has put a really great comment here, which I wanted to share. Again, another comment, I like the phrase creating the habit from one of your older videos. So Flora is watching some of the older videos. So thank you for that. And thank you for the patience on the older videos and decided to put it in today's drawing. This is what I wanted to highlight and decided to put it into today's drawing.
00:02:41.608 - 00:03:08.474, Speaker A: Creating the habit. I think that you've created a great habit here. I'm really enjoying it. You know, Aristotle, I never planned on saying this. I think it was Aristotle or basically kind of a classics. Classical ethics to a certain degree is you are your habits. And I think that's been picked up over time by the, what I call the success philosophers in the 20th century.
00:03:08.474 - 00:03:53.306, Speaker A: I never expected to go in this direction, but we're talking about habits here. Would I consider actually a branch of american pragmatism and pragmatism, common sense philosophy. And Americans, at least in the early 20th century, were known for their pragmatic philosophy, William James and Moore, other philosophers that I don't really know that much about. But there's a whole branch of success philosophy and the whole coaching, Brian Tracy and all that. And if anybody's ever depressed and doesn't kind of feels like their life is going out of control, as we're going to see in one piece later here. Brian Tracy. I highly recommend anyways, habits.
00:03:53.306 - 00:04:11.950, Speaker A: The power of habit, as they say, creating the habit. So I brought up her piece. Habits are small actions sustained over time. At the beginning they may seem difficult or even forced, but when we realize that suddenly we are missing them or even not feeling the same. Or. Or even not feeling the same when we don't do them. So true.
00:04:11.950 - 00:04:45.308, Speaker A: Again, kind of back to this idea, you know, not feeling the same when we don't do them. You are your habits. So kind of interesting. I brought up the piece because why not creating the habit? And I think we looked at this yesterday, and it turns out this was kind of based on something we were saying in the show way back when. And it's kind of nice to have this stuff as a record because it's nice to keep a video journal because I don't remember like 90% of what I say. And, you know, this is news to me. If you told me, had I said that, I wouldn't have.
00:04:45.308 - 00:04:58.636, Speaker A: I probably would have said no. I didn't say that. So anyways, so super interesting. Thank you, Flora. That's super awesome. And a couple of more just things I wanted to note here. Vito is experimenting with digital painting and having a ton of fun.
00:04:58.636 - 00:05:15.644, Speaker A: That is interesting. Eight. So. So he had the CRT tvs from yesterday, which were looking great. Glad you dug the work in progress shot. I'm thinking of doing a studio tour video soon since people seem to be interested. And I would say absolutely.
00:05:15.644 - 00:05:34.500, Speaker A: And I'd be happy to show it here if it's not too long. And also, there was one. Oh, this was hilarious. Felix le Pentagon ways in. And great to hear from you, Felix. And I brought up a few works of his. Actually, for this episode, I use the mosaic filter every day too.
00:05:34.500 - 00:05:57.877, Speaker A: Okay, so someone else is using almost what I want to call the outrageous, also legendary, well known. What is the word for that? Not infamous. I guess we could use infamous mosaic filter. The infamous mosaic filter is also being used by Felix Lipandra. So the fun continues over here, continuing on. Okay, so thank you, Flora. That's super radical.
00:05:57.877 - 00:06:31.062, Speaker A: Just kind of a tweet from Farouk, who, of course, is rug, radio and prominent personality in the space. He was tweeting out all the manifold open editions and these memes by 6529 de Medici, the Meebs ox Babylon. A lot of stuff which I've kind of actually missed. But this is what I wanted to highlight. Art is at the left, right, front and center of the NFT space right now. And I'm here for it. And I totally agree with this right here.
00:06:31.062 - 00:07:21.316, Speaker A: Art is that, and I think it's been true for a lot of this bear market. Like, as I was sort of saying in a, you know, 15 or so episodes ago, and I've kind of said, you know, here and there, art seems to be digital. Art seems to be one of the main use cases for crypto. And I just think, you know, and Farouk, you know, is kind of on the scene looking at the big picture here. And so for him to be saying this, it's quite interesting because we're kind of neck deep in the art over here. And it's kind of like, you know, do the math. Like, what are the implications of that? And it's kind of fun to think about, you know, so just more all to say, this scene is still hot, shall we say, despite any kind of financial situation, good or bad.
00:07:21.316 - 00:07:41.468, Speaker A: You know, Tezos has come back somewhat. Not really. And, you know, the markets, people are cheering on a new bull market, which feels a little premature over here, but not financial advice and who knows? But, and let's just finish the tweet here. This space was built on the back of crypto art. Let's not forget that. Or where it all started. So interesting thought.
00:07:41.468 - 00:08:04.830, Speaker A: I didn't actually realize. I guess he's talking about the NFT space, not crypto. And I suppose that is true. And the whole, I guess, cryptokitties. I mean, you guys know the history better than I do of the. I'm just kind of wowed and amazed by the art that I see. And so I talk about it here and slowly cover the history through my own perceptions of what's going on here.
00:08:04.830 - 00:08:37.054, Speaker A: Anyways, continuing on, Charles AI just with kind of a provocative, in a fun way, kind of tweet AI. Art is a widely different new medium, so why should we sell it like trad art? And then, so most people don't know what he's talking about. But it seems like he's got an idea. The idea I have in mind is mostly applicable to AI art and photography. So anyways, Charles, AI is thinking of new ways of selling AI art. So that's just kind of fun, interesting to think about. So I thought I'd share it there.
00:08:37.054 - 00:09:24.732, Speaker A: And rare, I'm still, and we're going to look at some physical art here just a little bit, just for comparison here of what's going on out here. Here. So rare posts this sorayama edition of 25, which is selling for $5,000. And so just, you know, contrast is everything in a lot of ways. And, you know, whether it's in art or whatever the case is. And I think it's really great for us to contrast physical art and that market as well, which we love to talk about here with what's going on in the physical and digital market, comparing and contrasting a little bit. We don't need to do it a ton, but a little bit is a fun thing to do and I think very kind of useful.
00:09:24.732 - 00:09:47.762, Speaker A: Again, contrast. So Sorayama edition of 25 for 5000. Maybe I'll grab one for my boss mentor. So anyways, interesting, right? And I've barely heard of this artist. Actually. The image is familiar to me, although not the name, actually, but obviously a prominent artist if an edition of 25 is selling for 5000. But you just start to see the comparison.
00:09:47.762 - 00:10:22.224, Speaker A: You know, we deal with editions at 25 here all the time. So I went to artsy, which is a nice place to see what's going on, get the pulse of the physical art market because galleries can post their work here and sell their work in a credible way online. And it's probably, I think it's the main art, art marketplace online that's, you know, that's not Sotheby's or Christie's, you know, where you can just kind of shop look. I can. So I was showing, you know, I like Wade Guyton, for example, for physical art. So I could go and buy this at €700. Okay.
00:10:22.224 - 00:10:55.084, Speaker A: Epson Durabrite, inkjet on letterhead. And it looks like it's maybe. Are they a four s? Yeah, I think there are basically four a four s here. Get a set of Wade Guyton for €700. Now, these are just basically, it looks like he's using letterhead here. Right? The May looks like a, you know, a calendar type letterhead. So something that's pre printed that you buy and it says has the month of the year, and then he puts that into the printer and then prints the New York Times on top of that.
00:10:55.084 - 00:11:39.724, Speaker A: So pretty cool solution is what I would call that, a very cool solution here from Wade Guyton, too, because, you know, I'm sure many artists, including myself, have thought, well, how do you turn the New York Times into art? The screenshot of the New York Times into art, and everybody has their own solutions. What I like about this solution is how simple it is. Now, anyway, my point in covering this is I just want us to get a little taste of the physical art market here. So also here. So here's David Hockney. And what's interesting is, if you look, lithographs are basically the affordable way that you can get a David Hockney on your wall. So lithograph printed in colors on newsprint.
00:11:39.724 - 00:12:04.988, Speaker A: Right? So 1250, a bounce for Bradford from 1987. So, I mean, we're going on 35 years old here, surprisingly so, 1250 pounds. And you can just purchase it right here. I don't know if it's framed. It's a nice looking frame. I mean, a simple frame. And there you have a Hockney from 1987, and I don't know if it's an edition, if it's a, you know, edition of 200 or something.
00:12:04.988 - 00:12:54.852, Speaker A: Here it just says lithograph printed in colors on newsprint. But again, a nice solution. Okay, let's do a lithograph on newsprint. And you could probably still do that, right? And I just finally brought up here Magritte, you know, and it's really interesting to compare these prices, isn't it? So here you can get a Rene Magritte Le Traison des images, the treachery of images. And as we've, you know, as long time viewers will remember, with Magritte, the title is a part of the work. So if you ever kind of go to an art show and there's a Magritte with no title card or there's no way to know the title, you're not getting the full art piece. He was a very literary artist, as many of the surrealists were, and the surrealists were very much a literary as much as an artistic tradition.
00:12:54.852 - 00:13:26.532, Speaker A: So here he is working with text, you know, one of the classics of what you might call conceptual art. Sicine pasin pip. And, of course, here's a pipe, but it's not a pipe. Anyway, the moral of the story is you can get a lithograph, and this is now, this is from 2010. So what is that about? So I don't know what to make of that. €690 how does that work? 2010, but it looks like it's signed. I don't know what's going on there.
00:13:26.532 - 00:13:44.244, Speaker A: This is also from 2010, but it looks like it's signed. So I don't know what they're up to there includes a certificate of authenticity. So, you know, be careful. I'd also say, like, I don't know what that means. Here is a. This is interesting. This is an etching.
00:13:44.244 - 00:14:09.114, Speaker A: And then I'm going to run through 1952. Okay. €500 edition of 950. And actually a pretty original. Like, I've never seen that Magritte. And it's a, you know, actual Magritte etching. So anyways, I just want us to contrast that because I think it's very beneficial for us as we continue to expand our discussion here, our synoptic discussion.
00:14:09.114 - 00:14:39.390, Speaker A: Okay, so continuing into the art here, we have Luis Ponce and who we looked at, who, if you look at on object and look, he's sold on Christie's on super rare. His market is very strong. And so one of these artists I kind of recently discovered by doing this show. And anyways, he posted a work that I thought was pretty head turning here. And it's. Yeah, so it almost looks like collage here. That's, you know, but I don't know how he actually does that.
00:14:39.390 - 00:14:59.124, Speaker A: Or maybe it's video that's mixed. So he's mixing a lot of different styles here and all into one canvas. So anyways, he posted this, I thought, very cool. Fragmented existence number 20 is not. Is now displayed as part of the digital canvas show. So just interesting for us in passing here. And here's another.
00:14:59.124 - 00:15:32.554, Speaker A: We looked at CTZN just the other day, and he kind of has these like Sci-Fi almost blade Runner type offices here. And I don't know if I mentioned this before, it's like this show for me, is almost like antiques Roadshow meets Blade Runner. That's what I joke to myself. And anyways, there's kind of a blade runner vibe here and. Yeah, just kind of another interesting kind of artist as we go in passing here. So just. And we were looking at CD ZN's like an alternative work just the other day.
00:15:32.554 - 00:15:48.996, Speaker A: Another work. So it's just kind of interesting to give us a little more context. A new one from Lulanu. This was minted January 26. And we remember them from their awesome Christmas work that they had. And the style is instantly recognizable. So here's a new one on super rare.
00:15:48.996 - 00:16:12.700, Speaker A: What is this called? Exploration. Very interesting selling mechanism. So they put the auction like, I wonder if I put in a 0.1. There seems to be no reserve here. So, like, if I sneak in in an hour and 26 minutes with 0.01 ETH and nobody bids and nobody notices, do I get to keep that? I don't know. Maybe I should do that.
00:16:12.700 - 00:16:42.044, Speaker A: I would feel kind of bad, though. Anyways, interesting to start the auction, though, without the reserve to kick it off. Very interesting exploration. We were also looking at crazy Jeffrey recently as well, still exploring the future of AI. If you watch this loop five or six times, you might stay stuck for a while then. So here we go. And he's the guy who made that massive sale, like $10,000 for the earthquake.
00:16:42.044 - 00:17:15.324, Speaker A: Kind of interesting, you know, this experimentation, kind of like animation with, you know, the equivalent of a Boston dynamics dog not quite going into an elevator, kind of getting stuck. So just interesting. Continuing on, a new one from ax stone. And we know ax stone. We've looked at them before. We've looked at her work before. Let me just dig it up here.
00:17:15.324 - 00:17:32.264, Speaker A: Celine Senar. And remember these works. And we're looking. So she's put out some black and white ones here. This color in black and white is particularly striking over here. That sold, see, for two and a half ETH. Interesting.
00:17:32.264 - 00:18:07.614, Speaker A: So she's trying just a straight up black and white with a reserve of two and a half. Anyway, I thought it was an interesting looking work here, wait for you. And it almost, again, this stuff really lends itself back to the physical conversation. Like, this would be extremely easy to screen print, and you could probably also just, I don't know, you know, image transfer. Like, I sometimes with lithography, for example, you can do image transfer. Maybe this could just act as an etching. Yeah, I just toyed with lithography.
00:18:07.614 - 00:18:22.194, Speaker A: I don't know how to do image transfer. You can kind of do it. I need to talk to. I've asked lithography people, and I still can't really get a straight answer. If anybody knows, feel free to leave a comment. Anyways, nice work. Pretty high resolution here, too.
00:18:22.194 - 00:18:54.682, Speaker A: Continuing on. And this is now, this is just another kind of, you know, tip. So how did I come across Axtone's profile again? We looked like maybe six weeks ago. Why am I on Axstone's or her profile again? And the reason is because she put out this tweet with this really cool looking gun that's made of flowers and snakes and whatever else, you know, soldiers, toy soldiers. And I. So she put out this interesting tweet, and I was like, oh, that's pretty cool. And then I go and explore, and I'm like, oh, super rare.
00:18:54.682 - 00:19:22.288, Speaker A: And then I go, oh, I've seen her work before. So I think this is the, for lack of better term, you know, the funnel, the collector, you know. And so it really is worth our while. And I am speaking to myself maybe more than anybody on this. It's really worth our while to post our art, even when it's already owned. And it's not, not just when you mint it, which is generally what I do. And that's not enough.
00:19:22.288 - 00:19:51.424, Speaker A: Like, look at how well it's worked for Axstone as far as. Okay, I go check it out. And now some guy on YouTube is talking about her. Why? Because she did this. So word to the wise, continuing on, Antonio loves very prolific here with a new work, seraphim, angel, Saint prophets. And it's looking really good here. Now, these are digital drawings, right? I mean, they definitely have a physical texture feel to them, but they are, in fact digital.
00:19:51.424 - 00:20:08.864, Speaker A: And you can even see there's almost like a paper texture underneath. Anyways, they look great and they continue to do well. Png 4000 by 4000 addition of seven. I think he's taking offers. I might have loaded this yesterday, so. Or list today. Yeah.
00:20:08.864 - 00:20:29.128, Speaker A: So there may be more offers than are showed right here. Anyways, I think he takes offers at. Oh, yeah, here they are accepted at 2019 1777, I think 1777 are the authors. So are the offer prices that are accepted. So seven times 17. We love to do the math on. We love to do the financials here.
00:20:29.128 - 00:20:58.034, Speaker A: I mean, again, 120 and then times 1.1 is like tezos, a dollar ten. So you're looking at like maybe $140 for your art. And, you know, Antonio loves us pretty new. We saw him mint the first work on this platform, which did very well, by the way, like a month ago, maybe six weeks Max. The paper crane with a new work. Buy for 162, huge following here.
00:20:58.034 - 00:21:30.564, Speaker A: Sale for 115, 125, 135. You know what's kind of interesting about paper Crane? I always thought they were. I always thought that kind of Louis Osborne, they're kind of like Louis Osborne. I mean, they collaborated with Louis Osborne from a market perspective, not an artistic perspective. I mean, they've collaborated. And there is, I would both categorize them under what I'd call illustration, maybe Louis Osborne, an animated illustration, if you wanted to kind of parse it out. So they do hang well together.
00:21:30.564 - 00:22:22.010, Speaker A: Mental block number twelve. But, you know, paper crane is doing very, very well here. And again, maybe it's part of the reason could be that I'm sure there's many, but that FX hash that they did, they've done one or two, and that really does tend to open you up to a new audience for whatever reason. Maybe it's all the generative art people out there and there are a lot. And maybe as far as, like, you know, crossover between contemporary art and the NFT scene, a lot of it does seem to happen in the generative art area, like where contemporary art collectors are going. They really like the generative art, you know, so just kind of interesting dynamics there, potentially. Again, feel, I'm just speculating here, so feel free to disagree or leave a comment.
00:22:22.010 - 00:22:50.838, Speaker A: Anyway, cool work. Kind of like a snakes and ladders vibe to it. And. Yeah, so just beautiful colors, too, as usual. Interesting collaboration here from Santiago and actress. So another challenging work, I would say, and just original and challenging. Like, I like the boldness that I see in a lot of the artists to put out, like just kind of experimental work, that it's aesthetically challenging.
00:22:50.838 - 00:23:43.356, Speaker A: At first you're not sure, but then the more you look at it, you go, well, it kind of becomes like a scientific exploration of sorts, you know, qualitative science. We're kind of back to, you know, pataphysics here. I mean, this kind of exploration, this is not a quantitative exploration, okay? This is what I call qualitative science. It's science not based on number, but science in the kind of old sense of the term knowledge that's being developed, but qualitatively. Okay, what happens when we do this experiment and then can we make it aesthetically interesting? What is that? Does that stretch? Does it work? Is it beautiful? And then we start to learn from that, and that in itself has value and it is interesting. First, collab actress Santiago. So anyways, very interesting.
00:23:43.356 - 00:24:03.824, Speaker A: Here's more challenging work from Yuri jay. Now, he released this a few days ago, but it's going to auction and I didn't think, I don't think I showed this one. I showed another one. He has a few of these kind of noisy works here. And this is at auction for 30. And like, look at this, 6 hours to go, zero bids. So you could get a Yuri J.
00:24:03.824 - 00:24:44.084, Speaker A: A super rare artist who does a lot of really interesting experimentation for 30, you know, $33 or something, you know, on superwear, if nobody else bids. So one of one. That's pretty cool. Edmarola edition of three amazing colors. So more mystifying work from Ed Morolla, but it's all beautiful and it's always interesting, isn't it? So amazing colors, a mystifying title. Strange, you know, just kind of hand drawn perspective from the looks of it here. Again, remember what we were seeing in the profile pictures? The human kernel or human kernel? Just human kernel.
00:24:44.084 - 00:25:17.110, Speaker A: Where he would take an area. I think it's a he, but I'm not positive where human kernel takes an area and then just fills it with a pattern and an experiment. And we kind of see a little bit of that here. So anyways, very interesting. And a figure in a landscape and with fish in the sky, reminiscent of Max Ernst's elephant celebs. You want to see a famous fish in the sky artwork? We'll show you in a second here. And then this interesting experimentation that he's playing with this brush over here.
00:25:17.110 - 00:25:38.464, Speaker A: And of course, the dithering. Let's just look at elephants. C'est leb by Ernst. This is a classic, Ernst, which is why I bring it up and you might not see it at first. There you can see it. Let me see if I can make this bigger here. So you see up here, it's a little dark.
00:25:38.464 - 00:26:07.630, Speaker A: See these fish in the sky? This is a famous, famous example of that. What's motif, shall we say? And here you can see the influence of Dekiriko. Alright, this is early Max Ernst here. And of course, here's the big elephant machine. And this is just wonderful here. This kind of headless torso with a line going through it. And so all the genius of Max Ernst on display very early on.
00:26:07.630 - 00:26:28.682, Speaker A: I think this is like 1921. You can see it right here. 1921. So, yeah, this is a classic. So I'm happy to show this. Look at that celeb. And he puts the title in there kind of quietly again, you got this kind of de Chirico influence, right? Who I used to call de Chirico.
00:26:28.682 - 00:26:58.188, Speaker A: So I've been told. Continuing on, Francois Gamma. Interesting. Always, you know, back to this idea of qualitative science. The exploration continues with Francois Gamma, which I think ultimately gives this scene credibility. Right? I mean, these kinds of experiments, you know, Francois gamma exploring movement and the human body from about a billion different directions. And that's it.
00:26:58.188 - 00:27:12.804, Speaker A: Okay, super interesting. And here's just another, you know, variation. Okay. And quite beautiful. I like the color choice too, just on a purely aesthetic level. Edition of 20 for three. Kind of a mysterious title, Kib.
00:27:12.804 - 00:27:32.214, Speaker A: So a few left there. And I think Francois lists on versum still, which is pretty cool. I should list something on versum. I actually have a series I listed on versum maybe I'll go back to that. So, side boob here. So, naughty fox lab. I picked this up.
00:27:32.214 - 00:28:08.026, Speaker A: They're small addition, and, again, kind of playing with the human form. I'm kind of a big fan of this contrast. As you know, viewers will know of this, of nature and pixels. It just goes very well, again, to say, once again, this contrast between curvilinear organic form and this kind of rectilinear technological digital structures. Pixels, that natural contrast is so strong that you pick anything in nature and you turn it into pixel art. It tends to do fairly well. And these guys are doing really nice jobs, and I really like how.
00:28:08.026 - 00:28:33.332, Speaker A: I'm a big fan of stamps, too. That was, like, the first thing I collected when I was, like, six. And so, anyways, eleven colors, 30 by 40 by three, which is kind of interesting. And here is more from naughty Fox lab. So I just gave them a follow. I'm not sure. I can't remember whose feed I found their work in.
00:28:33.332 - 00:28:58.832, Speaker A: I actually just picked up the genesis work there, too. I just think it's interesting, a little edgy, more pixel art. So check this out. Cat tarot. Like, are you having fun yet? Now, this seems to be loosely based on the. I think we call it the rider tarot deck and animated the fool. And it's quite beautiful, the colors here and turning it into a cat.
00:28:58.832 - 00:29:23.406, Speaker A: I mean, there's a lot of work that's gone in here, and it's pretty cool. And we have a few of them, so I hope they do the whole thing. I mean, it's a Titanic job, but this is the kind of thing that, after you pass away, that people will remember you by. Okay. Like, it's like, that's the person that did the cat tarot. Like this. You know, this kind of feels instantly famous in my kind of private universe here.
00:29:23.406 - 00:29:33.674, Speaker A: This is already something I'll never forget. So it's really nicely done. It's very cool. It's fun. The magician. So we have a few more here. The high priestess.
00:29:33.674 - 00:29:57.450, Speaker A: I think they're all still available. I might pick. Oh, this isn't available, but most of these, like, you can still get, you know, there's, like, one, you know, again, the liquidity of the flippers sometimes are helpful. The empress, like, look at how beautiful this is. And you wonder, and we're looking. This is another kind of interesting thing. It's interesting.
00:29:57.450 - 00:30:30.052, Speaker A: This one, the third one, almost looks slightly more evolved than the first, and this is a natural thing, and I love the first. Don't get me wrong. That's where I started here. But the third is particularly gorgeous, I'd say. And you know what that reminds me of? And I don't want to take too long here, but Michelangelo in the Sistine chapel. Here's another kind of Sistine Chapel story for you here, which is very kind of back to the pragmatics of making art. And hopefully we can find a big enough view.
00:30:30.052 - 00:31:02.076, Speaker A: I'm not sure we're going to be able to do this. Let me just see. This is 1290. Let's just look, another kind of story for you here. So the creation, or, wait, this very first one, if I remember, maybe I'm not going to remember the story, right, but I. What I remember is the first ones that he did, I think it was this one that he made them that basic. The first ones were not.
00:31:02.076 - 00:31:30.084, Speaker A: Put it this way. I'll tell you the story. The first one that he did of these, of this fresco here, of the Sistine chapel, maybe, was this one, the creation of the universe here, separating the light from the dark. Basically, it's not as well viewed from the bottom. When you look from the floor and you look up at the ceiling, it's not as well. You can't see it that well. So Michelangelo was like, oh, I need to make these bigger.
00:31:30.084 - 00:32:11.230, Speaker A: Right? And so I'm going to look that up to get us the exact thing. But basically, over the course of him painting this, he makes it more bigger, so that in terms of the composition, so more kind of legible and viewable from the floor. So he goes all the way up, he paints it, he comes down and he goes, oh, I need to make an adjustment here. So that's, you know, to make a very stretched analogy here. But we see this throughout artist development. If they do a series, often, we'll see them evolve through that series, the pragmatics of making art. So, continuing on, slave angel, flipper ride.
00:32:11.230 - 00:32:42.206, Speaker A: So slave angel has been quite productive here with the manifolds and everything, and seems to be doing quite well on the periphery here. One bit gift by slave angel, 2023. And they sell out again. Let's look at the market here. You know, sale eleven. So these used to be like three or four not that long ago, selling out at eleven editions of 3330 tezos. Thank you.
00:32:42.206 - 00:33:18.356, Speaker A: So again, real money. This is another one that could probably hang in the same room. Karim Safa, 125 frames, two colors, kind of a one bit piece. And this is called dunes is a four piece series of 16 by nine. One bit animations that interprets the dynamic transformations of dune fields. So interesting, right? So again, nature and pixels, a wonderful combination. Continuing on, native Ed was kind of an edgy work that maybe speaks a little bit to the culture of our scene over here.
00:33:18.356 - 00:33:38.754, Speaker A: The digital art scene, the NFT digital art scene. Secret vault place, ledger. Nano isn't enough anymore. So these are, of course, the cold wallet storage. And so here are your gifts being stored. And maybe this 666 is the evil. And maybe these are your gifts being siphoned out of your wallet.
00:33:38.754 - 00:34:07.894, Speaker A: Interesting. So hopefully native Ed hasn't. Nothing bad has happened to native Ed. So anyways, be careful out there, though. Moral of the story, very interesting. And popple with a new, what I want to call monster from the sanitarium series. Lurcher of sludge, with eyes that gleam in the darkest night, the creature scours the sludge for treasures, bright lost gems and gold it will not miss, for in the muck, it finds its bliss.
00:34:07.894 - 00:34:38.034, Speaker A: You know, I'm not a big poetry guy, you know, as JG Ballard says, there's nothing more, you know, and nothing against poetry, but this is pretty good, is actually what I was gonna say, you know, like this. This is pretty good. So anyways, like. Yeah, so popple edition of 25, still available for nine. Interesting. I love this series. And again, pretty high quality writing from my perspective over here.
00:34:38.034 - 00:35:03.874, Speaker A: KHC, how are we doing for time here? 35. All right, we're gonna speed up a bit here. KHC. Kurt Hussle collective with a mysterious work. Love the music. Could be a hotel lobby, you know, really nice, like Ritz Carlton. You go on.
00:35:03.874 - 00:35:23.144, Speaker A: Really nice music. That's what it reminds me of. It's like the elevator music in the Ritz, which I haven't been in the elevator at the Ritz for ten years, but, yeah, that's the kind of music I remember. Very luxurious. I don't trust like that. So interesting piece. Mysterious from Kurt Hussle collective.
00:35:23.144 - 00:35:42.150, Speaker A: Kind of an older dude here, get off my lawn kind of dude. Corrupt rom from glitch David. So it's. This is very experimental. Check this out. Super experimental. Wild chaos.
00:35:42.150 - 00:36:01.182, Speaker A: It's absolute chaos from glitch David. Buy for one edition of five so you can get it for a song. Here, it's almost free. And here are all the games in it. So wild again, the glitch rom. It's fascinating to see the different experiments with it. So shout out to Reconno.
00:36:01.182 - 00:36:12.744, Speaker A: Hang in there. If you see him, call 911. Change life. Email me. Recano, 1991. To infinity. So this is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sales, zero.
00:36:12.744 - 00:36:50.980, Speaker A: Exhibition, zero. So anyways, hang in there, Recano. It's all part of the journey. We've all been there, so just hang in there. Change live email. One thing I'd like to say though, is I do love this theme, which we saw also with Trezor Rodanqs, the failed artist theme, because it speaks to a true kind of situation, and kind of all artists at one time or another are failed artists, okay? It's not like you start making art and the world loves you and buys your art right away. Most of us, you know, for a good portion of our so called careers are, you know, in that situation.
00:36:50.980 - 00:37:16.880, Speaker A: So hang in there. It's part of the journey and hilarious work, actually, in a good way, you know, future chair by Eizou. So these beautiful, beautiful, beautiful works by Eizo. This is a huge edition of 333, so you can get it for like two tazos. I'm all over. And of course, we were talking about Eizou in the intro here with the studio. Potential studio tour.
00:37:16.880 - 00:37:33.012, Speaker A: I'd love to see that. I think it would just be super cool too. And he's out of Montreal, I believe, somewhere I lived for a few years. This desk looks great too. So beautiful, beautiful glitch work. Future desk, great title, great color. Just all of it.
00:37:33.012 - 00:37:56.638, Speaker A: The dresser. I love the concept here. You see a little more texture here. Beautiful, beautiful color. So there's a lot to kind of latch onto here from both a conceptual and an aesthetic level. Right? Future dresser too. And you know what this title reminds me of is that famous pop artwork by his name is escaping me.
00:37:56.638 - 00:38:24.348, Speaker A: Richard, what is it? Tomorrow's famous pop art collage. It's like the guy who started pop art almost tomorrow's. And then we'll put tomorrow's those google here. Let's just. Quickly, quickly, Richard, let me just quickly. Otherwise we'll have to come back to it tomorrow. Here we go.
00:38:24.348 - 00:38:56.698, Speaker A: This is what I, Richard Hamilton, of course. Just see the title. Like, to me, there's an oblique, it feels the same. Just what is it that makes today's home so different, so appealing? And this collage is kind of seen as very much, you know, in all pop art anthologies. You'll find this at the start, pretty much 1956. Richard Hamilton, who is a fantastic artist with this great, you know, iconic collage here. Tomorrow's modern home furnishings, it just echoes that in my mind.
00:38:56.698 - 00:39:38.982, Speaker A: Anyways, we gotta move on. House of the model with a new track here. Little dreams in the Armani sky. Let's just play a little bit, you know? Again, continuing with the super uber cool kind of nineties vibe. Are we doing nice glitch work here? There we go. So, again, it just speaks to the culture out here in our digital art scene. I mean, it's pretty cool.
00:39:38.982 - 00:39:53.986, Speaker A: Here's some new music. I mean, again. And I. I think House of the model is also working on a player. It's like, when can we dj these things? It's coming. I think it's coming. So pretty cool.
00:39:53.986 - 00:40:08.912, Speaker A: Little dreams in the Armani sky. I think that's. Oh, this got burned. So hopefully he's okay with me sharing this. We're deep into the video, so there might be a new version of this available. This was just kind of a cool. I think it's generative art.
00:40:08.912 - 00:40:21.292, Speaker A: This is by Matt Dessel, and he's on. Yeah. Artist. And here it is. So I thought this was just kind of interesting. I think I went to his page. It's pretty busy.
00:40:21.292 - 00:40:38.966, Speaker A: He's got a lot going on. It looks like there's a book exhibited with. Looks like there's a lot going on with Matt Des Laurier here. Yeah, you see, this is what I was. So I'm not sure if we've looked at his work before, but I thought it looked pretty good. Maybe we have. So just kind of interesting.
00:40:38.966 - 00:41:07.806, Speaker A: And continuing on, zooming through this, Eduardo Crivolari, confused bookshelf. And I think he's a generative artist as well. Yes. Generative artist from Brazil has works on Ethan Saul. Pretty interesting. Good looking kind of work, isn't it? Again, it looks like physical, right? This looks like a Rizzo print or something. Rizo, for those that don't know, is basically a really cheap way to kind of do screen printing equivalent.
00:41:07.806 - 00:41:34.818, Speaker A: It uses photocopiers. It's actually trickier than it looks, but it's, you know, there's probably a Rizzo printer in your neighborhood, and it's fun to experiment with if you're delving into the physical. Check this out. So this is a collaboration between marubu. And where is the name of the other artist here? John Roos. Now, John Rus is a physical artist. Artist from my understanding.
00:41:34.818 - 00:42:06.094, Speaker A: And he was doing the physical nfts that kind of look like Francis Bacon esque a little bit. And so he's collaborating. I thought this was a really interesting collaboration here on foundation with Marubu. And I guess Marubu is putting in the digital stuff on top. Just kind of interesting and pretty good looking. Nice work. And this is one that just came out so again, they've put out a whole series here and just kind of interesting, isn't it? 0.45
00:42:06.094 - 00:42:23.178, Speaker A: reserve. And continuing on. So here's. I was going to show you some Felix Le Peindre. So I'll quickly show you this here are just some interesting. I think this is human times machine times AI. So almost like a ticket, right? And the Mickey mouse is, for lack of better term, just kind of.
00:42:23.178 - 00:42:43.828, Speaker A: Well, let's just call it eviscerated. I was going to call it deconstructed there, but let's call it eviscerated. That's more or just kind of blown apart. Human times machine times AI, available edition of one for ten. And there's several of them. And so he was pretty cool experimentation. So shout out to Felix there.
00:42:43.828 - 00:42:57.534, Speaker A: One of one for ten. These are all available. One of one for ten. So just kind of. I like how he uses the ticket, too, and I wonder if the UPC or not. The UPC. The QR code there works.
00:42:57.534 - 00:43:26.592, Speaker A: So anyways, interesting work. And here's another one by Felix La Pandra. Pretty nice from only a month ago. AI work, acid at the Gucci store. I thought, this is a pretty nice work, and so very interesting here. I'm not sure which AI he's using there, but very interesting. Continuing on the AI front, everything comes closer from JOA in.
00:43:26.592 - 00:43:39.040, Speaker A: So he's got a new work, and it's already bidded on. Bid on. And there's only six and a half hours left here. Left here. So 0.22 ETH. So it continues with JoA in, and it's looking really good.
00:43:39.040 - 00:44:14.060, Speaker A: Again, interesting development of more volume and more color from those earlier object, or the work we saw on object, and I think on foundation as well. Here's another artist that I'm not sure we've looked at. Power job. And this also, I believe, is AI. It's hard to find the details on if it was AI, but you look at these shapes and you go, this is definitely AI. So interesting work, right? You wonder if this is two AI layers put together, like if this black is put on top, or if they were able to get this from a prompt. Back to our prompt.
00:44:14.060 - 00:44:38.442, Speaker A: Engineers here, the catcher in the Rye, a classic of american literature, although a lot of english professors are skeptical. On the Quecher in the Rye, I haven't read it for 20 years, so I. Maybe 30 years, not quite. Maybe 25 years. You know, I was probably 20. I'm not for. I'm 43, by the way, Ilya Bliznetz and I believe Ilya is a he.
00:44:38.442 - 00:45:00.652, Speaker A: And so again, combining painting and AI. So interesting experimentation over here. What is the title of this work? In effect, state AI and digital painting, edition of 15. Buy for four. And there are six left. And another one from Kona Gtude, who's having a great start to the year. I saw the tweet out there, Kone, and, yeah, it's looking really good.
00:45:00.652 - 00:45:28.948, Speaker A: And so here you are again, two, four, and interesting, you know, so clearly AI here. And so Kone g two is doing great, I think, displaying with super chief now, McHX, who did those works with that look like Rothko, like kind of dynamic. Rothko's also has some digital art here. Ao one, they have a new series. And this is AI. Okay. AI experimental digital art, machine learning, digital color field.
00:45:28.948 - 00:45:51.080, Speaker A: So AI abstraction, interesting. Buy for 15, edition of one. Okay. And you see, you can get all four, at least at the time of this broadcast. So for 60, you could get this artificial intelligence abstract series. Pretty good. Here's another one.
00:45:51.080 - 00:46:10.992, Speaker A: So interesting AI abstraction. I'm sure we'll see more of that. Now, this is digital painting, I guess I'd categorize it as. It's a digital artwork on the Eminem show. And this is by walk, of course. And this is a digital artwork using his kind of noisified, blurred out m and M cover. And I think if we call a.
00:46:10.992 - 00:46:26.416, Speaker A: If we do a quick search here, you'll see the reference for those. I had to actually look this up. I've heard of this. And of course, when you see it, it's familiar. So anyways, it's based on that. So interesting. It's always a challenge with walk to find the source.
00:46:26.416 - 00:46:57.320, Speaker A: And Ian Curtis here is back. The future of the web looks different. So here's a web Ar experiment I want to show us, because we're into visual culture out here. I thought this was pretty interesting. You see, it's almost like this should be a sky goodman impossible shoe coming out of the AR here. So just kind of interesting video, isn't it? I guess this is theoretically through the glasses of Ar. So just to keep us on top of things here, I thought that looked pretty interesting.
00:46:57.320 - 00:47:19.228, Speaker A: And finally, some physical work here. Quilanina again, playing with the tarot theme. And here looks like a play on the hangman, also from the Ryder tarot deck. And here's number twelve. And this is a painting. So very cool contemplation. Acrylic oil and glitter on canvas, inspired on the tarot card, the hanged man.
00:47:19.228 - 00:47:41.314, Speaker A: And here is Quila Nina's again, kind of like, for those that are maybe newer to the channel, kind of like a visionary. I'd put her almost in the visionary category. There's kind of like visionary artists, kind of psychedelic artists. I think she's out of Peru, from Argentina. Peru. Kind of really reminiscent, you know, especially here, of like those ayahuasca paintings. You'll see.
00:47:41.314 - 00:47:58.850, Speaker A: We can look at those in another episode. But we're starting to run long here, so let's continue. So here's a guy who I really like. I've probably shown his work before, Steven Schwartzer. He's in the contemporary art scene. And I just think his work is beautiful. I think he's in Germany, actually.
00:47:58.850 - 00:48:16.354, Speaker A: I'm not positive on that, but just a really nice. These looks like colored pencils on paper. He calls it poly chromos auf Papill. So that looks pretty german to me. And here's some. Just more of his work, you see. Not a ton of followers, but he's with good, like.
00:48:16.354 - 00:48:38.178, Speaker A: But enough. And with galleries like him. So he's actually had a good couple of years, really deservedly. His work is beautiful and interesting. You know, here's one he just posted here. And he's doing a lot of experimentation, too, which I think is cool as well. He's not just sticking to, okay, I make nice, you know, textured kind of drawings.
00:48:38.178 - 00:48:52.710, Speaker A: There's a lot of experimentation. And it's the sense of color also that's kind of magic is the color. Sorry. Color is the magic in painting. Oftentimes it's kind of like the. The great. The great kind of.
00:48:52.710 - 00:48:59.554, Speaker A: We'll just call it that. The magic in painting. Thanks, everyone, for joining me. I hope you have a great weekend. Until next time. Take care.
