00:00:01.880 - 00:00:35.804, Speaker A: No time to waste, as we are in heavy pursuit of land's unknown, undiscovered countries as we sail forward here. Artists journal, November 21, 2023. Broadcasting from the editor's desk on the pirate ship of the mind. My name's Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back. Thank you for the massive response yesterday. The first 6 hours were pretty wild. It was sweeping my hair, it was wind sweeping my hair with a Twitter interaction.
00:00:35.804 - 00:00:58.276, Speaker A: Thank you for all of the support and the enthusiasm. It's a heck of a lot of fun, isn't it? We're having a good time over here as we continue our journey. So time is of the essence, as per usual. Here, check this out. So let's see if it works. And it does. Now, interactive art is not necessarily, put it this way.
00:00:58.276 - 00:01:29.500, Speaker A: I've always been kind of neutral, shall we say, on interactive art. Could take it or leave it. You know, it's cool. It's a category, it's legit, it's a thing. It definitely has its own qualities and characteristics, but it's never something I've been like, I have to make some of this or this sort of thing. But I have to say acid boy, who you might have already guessed that this is acid boy. Acid boy, the master of psychedelic abstraction, has really done a nice job here.
00:01:29.500 - 00:01:50.384, Speaker A: When I first put my cursor, this is on Acid Boy's website, by the way. When I first put my cursor on the work, I felt the delight of a child. I felt it was delightful. Like, it was just so much fun. And even still, as I do it now, it is, like, just really cool. It is fun, it is colorful. It's really well done.
00:01:50.384 - 00:02:19.496, Speaker A: It feels kind of light, so to speak, as well. And then it all disappears here. So very cool work, as usual from acidboy. And I'll show you something else that's interesting. So I discovered that link to acidboy's site here from this tweet, cooking for a new ordinals. And when I first saw this tweet, I thought, well, acid boy, this is going to be, like, at least a megabyte, maybe more. You're going to be paying $10,000 to mint this on ordinals.
00:02:19.496 - 00:03:00.694, Speaker A: But then I realized this is probably just code, obviously, right? And then you go, oh, well, maybe this is actually another elegant solution, so to speak, on how to mint an artwork on, you know, bitcoin without spending a fortune. Maybe this is only a few bytes. Like, maybe this isn't even a kilobyte. It's probably just a little bit of code, so that'll be super interesting to see. And it's interesting. Someone was just actually reaching out to me about the work I had minted on ordinals. And the person said, you know, I have never bought anything on ordinals because I'm a little worried about the provenance.
00:03:00.694 - 00:03:33.270, Speaker A: And I was like, yeah, that's actually, you know, if I understand what you're saying, that's like, as far as under connecting the work to the artist. And I was like, that's why I bought pokebelly BTC. Like, I want to own it, but it's also just to help establish the windswept hair here, just to establish the authorship. Right. So where it's just kind of all on chain. It obviously came from the same wallet, so to speak, and etcetera. Okay, we'll have to go with this.
00:03:33.270 - 00:04:03.158, Speaker A: I hope we can just imagine I'm on a ship right now. So, you know, so anyway, just kind of part of that conversation here. And also from acid boy, look at this. I mean, this came out October 6, so about a month ago. I'm not sure if we had seen it before. It's totally possible. But, like, that is another just kind of stunning work here by a really just impressive artist here.
00:04:03.158 - 00:04:47.268, Speaker A: Like, I don't see anybody who's actually, in a weird way, coming close and, you know, just purely subjective and I haven't seen everything. But acid boy is really, really is a master of this and very focused on this kind of, again, what I call psychedelic abstraction. Very focused, a true master, as we like to say here. And this is just black and white, but just really nicely put together. So shout out to acidboy, very nice person online, Pokebelly doing artist journal on rug radio. Michele Colonna on running a gallery now. Michele Kelowna is, of course, Kelowna contemporary, is the gallery.
00:04:47.268 - 00:05:32.044, Speaker A: And this is a gallery, I believe, on the kind of the outskirts of Philadelphia, and has shown, I think, ADHD. Right. Several of the physical works. Mikey Wilson helped doing the prints, so has been doing a lot of things with his physical gallery, with a lot of, you know, what you might call artists from the scene. And so it's been pretty impressive, this kind of bridging of digital and I guess what you call contemporary or traditional art world there in the physical world. So we're gonna get an update from Michaela Colonna on just how it's all going. Just what is the story? It's been almost a year, maybe ten months, if I had to hazard a guess.
00:05:32.044 - 00:06:08.564, Speaker A: So really curious just to hear about that. That is Wednesday at 09:30 a.m. Eastern time in New York, 330 central european time. And that should be fabulous. And comments on yesterday's show, rune tune. I have plenty of opinions on physical versus digital. So remember ugo 42, as we like to call him here, was saying, should I make physical works if I've already minted as a digital? And I basically was saying it's a different iteration.
00:06:08.564 - 00:07:17.380, Speaker A: And. Yeah, but put it this way, artistically, and I think this is what we're going to get into here with rune tune. Artistically, what I like to do is to whatever medium I'm using to a certain degree, I want to comment on it. Like, let's say it's originally a digital work. If I'm going to turn it into something else, I kind of want it to be special from using that medium. So, for example, as I was screen printing the digital mask on top of the work on top of the inkjet, to me, that new process basically kind of justified in my mind, to a certain degree, the creation of that work. That being said, I don't think there's anything wrong with, let's say you just made, for sake of argument, a static jpeg, and then you sold that as a one of one, or even an edition of ten, whatever the case may be, and then you printed out a different edition that was signed.
00:07:17.380 - 00:07:56.986, Speaker A: I don't see that as a bad thing because it's a different iteration. So it's not identical, it's something different. And even just from a purely legalistic, legal perspective to, you know, you own the intellectual property of that image. So I think even just if we were to take a purely legal perspective, this is a different artwork if you make it on inkjet than on. Than sdigital, is how I feel about it. Particularly if you start, you know, adding paint in now, see, like, again, the screen print example. And I want to get back to rune tune here in a second.
00:07:56.986 - 00:08:28.452, Speaker A: But let's say the screen print example, you know, one of the arguments you can also make is, hey, the paint's not. The acrylic paint of the screen print is not going to be exactly, you know, applied the same way on each work. They're actually all different works, even if it's an edition of ten. These say, physical works that I was doing, for example, each one has its own little quality. You know, it's. It might be slightly different. Maybe the paint didn't, you know, spread as well, and all this sort of thing.
00:08:28.452 - 00:09:02.460, Speaker A: So I'm kind of back to, you know, Warhol. He's not going to, you know, use the screen print this when, you know, do make one screen print. He would make 125 screen prints, for example. And every, and oftentimes they'll, each one kind of has, is a unique to a certain degree, even though it is an edition of 125. But as physical works, they are all, they're not totally identical, interestingly. And so, yeah, so it's interesting. I don't see anything wrong with it still.
00:09:02.460 - 00:09:45.132, Speaker A: But let's continue to what runtoon was saying in response to Hugo, who was wondering if it was okay. I would say that if you're comfortable with it, go ahead. Ultimately, the market is going to decide what it wants to do. I've grappled with skepticism in the ongoing discourse on physical versus digital, and leaning on my long standing beliefs in artistic freedom. I hold the view that it's ultimately the artist's prerogative to determine what they consider authentic in their work. While the issue hasn't been raised recently, there was a period where it seemed like there was a prevailing notion that selling nfts of physical artwork contradicted the digital art market. This is kind of one of the very early arguments I was making, actually, on this show, which is this idea.
00:09:45.132 - 00:11:07.570, Speaker A: I was just sharing my, you know, just thoughts, which was, you know, is there something kind of less collectible, I think, is how I framed it about physical artworks as nfts. And I think the prevailing kind of idea for me is if you take a picture of an artwork and then you make an NFT out of it, for me, it's almost like the picture is the NFT. In a sense, you've nft or minted a picture of an artwork, not the artwork itself. If it's purely a physical work, these things start to become gray areas. If all of a sudden you start adding something or changing the color a little bit in Photoshop, and then it starts to become kind of like what I'd be tempted to call a natively digital file. It's a subtle discussion, and I don't think there's any, like, final answers on it. It's something that I think a lot of people wonder about, especially people who are painters first coming to the digital art world and saying, oh, could I just turn all my works into nfts? Ultimately, like, in my heart of hearts, if I'm just to give a pure answer, say to friends who do that, I feel like there's something inherently, perhaps a little less collectible about it.
00:11:07.570 - 00:11:37.726, Speaker A: But I'm not against it, and it's a free country and people can do whatever they want. Interestingly, Rune Thun did that with the physical artwork and turn it into an NFT. But what was kind of extra interesting about it, like recently, was the work was destroyed, as far as he understood. So that kind of did actually kind of weirdly legitimize it. Kind of gave new life. So again, it's sort of like, it's very subtle discussion in a sense. And I don't think there's any kind of final answers on it.
00:11:37.726 - 00:12:23.392, Speaker A: I just think, you know, almost to the spirit of Rune Thun's point here, it's however the collector feels about it, however the artist feels about it, and if both are cool with the situation, whatever it is, then that's okay, right? I don't adhere to that restriction. If I choose to create a physical piece and aim to sell it as a tokenized digital art item, that's my decision. And I agree. Like, I think there's no one should be stopped or, you know, it shouldn't be. It's just what it is, you know, and for some people, they want to collect and others maybe, you know, so. And like, likewise, if you want to make prints of your digital one of one, you need to trust your instincts and rationale about why this is a genuine evolution of your artistic pursuits. So beautifully put here by rune tune.
00:12:23.392 - 00:12:37.934, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment. And we got another one coming up. Let's go to retro Manny verso. Another great show. Glad to see you're breaking the 1 hour mark recently. I'm kind of. Again, I'd prefer this to be like a 30 minutes show, the beginning of the show.
00:12:37.934 - 00:13:03.716, Speaker A: These kind of, you know, commentary tabs are kind of extending the show, but it is a nice addition to the show. The shows are becoming a little cumbersome just from a daily schedule point of view. They're eating up more and more of my time, so I am trying to actually reduce this. I tried today. It's very difficult to chop stuff out, though, I have to say. So I'm glad you're enjoying it, though. Great to hear from you.
00:13:03.716 - 00:14:10.844, Speaker A: A few things in response to some of the topics discussed were the on chain physical editions and the artist's social media timeline or brand first. I think it is really important, at least for me, that if the blockchain or all this tech dies tomorrow or worse, evolves into something that no longer resonates, my brand as an artist can continue in other ways if we build our whole practice. So that it lives and dies with the tech, then it's not very robust and will ultimately lack longevity. It relies on too many external factors. And you know what? I never really thought of it that way, Manny, but it's kind of a really interesting defense of making physical works, physical versions of your digital works, isn't it? Because if all of a sudden, you know, for whatever reason, the blockchain disappears and all our work with it, if you don't have any physical versions, those works are basically gone. So very interesting .1 of the reasons Tezos originally appealed in the beginning and still does, because it survived to death and the sheer will and resolve of the artists involved found ways to survive beyond it.
00:14:10.844 - 00:14:45.340, Speaker A: It also doesn't rely on centralized companies constantly tweeting out how great it is, so it feels like there's less propaganda. Social media timeline is an incredibly important journal document of the life, progress and process of an artist. So replying to rip cash, imagine seeing the social media timeline for da Vinci. You know, you could argue the notebooks are, but it would be a little different. But yeah, very interesting. And again, a very provocative idea, Manny, because what if we were to treat our social media timelines as da Vinci treated his. Nope.
00:14:45.340 - 00:15:24.920, Speaker A: Notebooks? It's like. And you could say we kind of vaguely do, but not quite in the same way. Like, what if you had a spectacular timeline of here's a sketch I did, like, where you really kept a visual journal, so to speak, on the timeline, but like, you know, pretty extensive. That would be pretty interesting. And like, people kind of do it, but not in the same way that Da Vinci did, I would argue. Just have to be careful we don't get overly influenced or derailed by the timelines of others, but balance the discourse and great conversations of art at the same time. It's also a real salon in that respect regarding physical editions and a one of one NFT.
00:15:24.920 - 00:16:16.480, Speaker A: This is kind of the point of it, right? If you own the NFT, as a collector, you have immutable proof of ownership. If you have prints, it's nice to own and carries personal value to a physical space, but it isn't proof of ownership. Yeah, interesting. I still don't particularly care about on chain as it stands, namely because it won't be able to support the art I make or the direction I'm going in, or it is at least a needless barrier I don't need at this moment. I guess the file size and cost will change over time, but I think artists should be perfectly okay with opting out of the idea that if the tech is going there, I need to follow and adapt my art to suit. And, yeah, this is an interesting idea. Like, remember that ordinals tweet from yesterday saying in 18 months, all ordinals will eat nfts provocative tweet? I don't think so.
00:16:16.480 - 00:17:25.548, Speaker A: Until they figure out the file size issue. Right? Like, as long as there's a file size issue, there's, you know, people aren't going to mint on their, you know, five megabyte JPEg or more 30 megabytes, as we saw with axing a few days ago. That's not going to be minted on bitcoin unless they have some sort of technical solution there, because that would cost you, like, probably $100,000, I'm guessing. So, yeah, so, you know, again, my take on it, like, if I were, you know, if I were to be, you know, brought in as an advisor on this, I would say, you know, maybe though the fun, at least the way, let's put it this way, if the way I approach it is, oh, there's a limitation there I'd really like to mint on bitcoin, so I'd have to make it a small size. And therefore, do I have really small works? And actually I do. That were 5, then I was like, oh, what happens if I do this and this to make it like 3 kb or 4 kb or 2? That's kind of where I come in from. And then can I do that? And then with that, then it's like, oh, cool, I minted on there.
00:17:25.548 - 00:18:00.254, Speaker A: So that is, it's not like changing my art. It's more just, can I make a series that works within these, you know, parameters or limits? Of course, not diminishing the pursuit of anyone's going on there, but I think more nuanced thought process per individual needs of the artist is important. Exactly. And people make art for different reasons at the end of the day. Otherwise, we can end up with a herd mentality, always looking to others to help decide our own direction. Anyway, you know me, I always ramble my initial quick fire thoughts. Thank you for the extended commentary rune tune.
00:18:00.254 - 00:18:36.054, Speaker A: Again, great job on gathering all the great conversation. The Ripcash conversation on social media being an extension of the crypto art scene and the art itself I find extremely fascinating. It is another extension of the idea of space and art and life. Who is the artist? It's another extension on the idea of the space between art and life. Who was the artist critic who coined the phrase? I am not sure the space between art and life. Not exactly sure, but I agree with you. I find the idea of the timeline as journal.
00:18:36.054 - 00:19:04.310, Speaker A: Maybe that's our takeaway from our discussion today. The timeline as journal again, Manny, with that comparison to Da Vinci's journal, the timeline as journal I find quite interesting. And this is also interesting. I'm getting information pointing to John Dewey's art is experience, which I've never read. And Dewey, a pragmatist, american pragmatist, philosopher. Art is experienced. That sounds like a good read, though.
00:19:04.310 - 00:19:26.840, Speaker A: And Alan Capro's life and work entertaining the idea of the gap between art and life. And that I do not know. So very interesting. Skomra, I never thought about Hugo's question. Thanks for bringing that up. I think it's a great idea and probably a good idea for the artist to be upfront about the dual life of the work to both buyers. Interesting thought by Ripcache just on that idea, though.
00:19:26.840 - 00:20:09.572, Speaker A: I. I don't know. Like, I. Does Warhol have to notify the buyer of one of the screen prints that, by the way, I'm going to be making ten more of these later? I think it's just, you know, if the work's going for $4 million fine, you know, then it's like, okay, just so you know, there's going to be other iterations. Otherwise, you know, there's, put it this way. I would say there's also responsibility on behalf of the collector to understand the artists that they're buying work from and that it's kind of a two way street. And so maybe the important thing is transparency.
00:20:09.572 - 00:20:55.512, Speaker A: And I like the spirit of what's being discussed here that, you know, because. But I guess the concern is maybe you make a work as a digital art piece, you mint it as an NFT, but then you don't. And at the time you're not thinking you're going to make physical works. But then later, you know, maybe you looked at Manny's comments saying, what if the blockchain disappears? And you go, hey, you know what? And you found out a new process. And just like Mec TXT with like, hey, I can make Rezo prints out of these Ms Dos works potentially. I don't see that as at all diminishing the value of the NFT, but feel free to disagree out there if anyone feels differently. It's an interesting topic, and clearly it's resonating with some people out there.
00:20:55.512 - 00:21:29.218, Speaker A: Interesting thought by Ripcache that the community around an artist's work is its own extended medium. And so here we're kind of back to this and the community again. We're almost, as I think I was mentioning last time, we're almost at Joseph Boy's social sculpture here. Fascinatingly, I never considered it in this strong terms. Beautifully put. But I think it's true that the artist is sculpting their community. I don't know if I'd say sculpting, but is in collaboration to a certain degree.
00:21:29.218 - 00:21:54.518, Speaker A: In a sense, maybe. If I'm saying social sculpture. Yeah, I'd say a light version of that. I would say that they're both kind of sculpting, making a sculpture of sorts, a social sculpture. They're both contributing to the sculpture. Anyone who has ever been in the X copy chat at raffle time can testify to the fact that the vibe is a part of the experience, and that experience becomes part of the work, especially after you don't win the raffle. Great show.
00:21:54.518 - 00:22:13.494, Speaker A: Thanks for showing my work. You're welcome. Skomra, a fabulous series with the people at the computers. There's something almost kind of. It feels like a Steve Jobs esque sort of thing, just these people at their computers. There's something really charming about that whole series. So beautiful work, Dan.
00:22:13.494 - 00:22:55.416, Speaker A: I find the digital physical discussion posed by Ugo interesting. I've offered exclusive lenticular prints on a handful of my dog gifts. Others were printed prior to being offered as phygital and used as currency for trades at art scene fairs. What might be maddening for phygital or physical digital collectors, I never indicate edition number on the physicals. Yeah, so that's interesting. This is because I may decide to reprint it in the future or print editions for friends and families. Like ultimately, when you don't put the edition number, I think the hardcore collectors, it probably just lowers the value is all it does, because then they're going to go, okay, well, no addition number is no addition number.
00:22:55.416 - 00:23:30.966, Speaker A: Therefore, one has to assume unlimited. Right? Or potentially unlimited, as this person is saying. I might want to print more in the future. So it is interesting, but I think it all kind of works out in the sense that if you don't put addition numbers. Yeah, it's probably going to be a lower value. Does this make the NFTs all that more valuable, knowing they're a verifiable number on the chain? Well, I think the addition size matters, and the fact that there's basically a limited edition and that basically, you know, you can always mint the same file twice, but your reputation will be destroyed in the process. On the blockchain.
00:23:30.966 - 00:23:53.810, Speaker A: Or one would argue, unless you're doing something that is particularly conceptual. But it starts to become a stretch pretty quickly, doesn't it? I have also. And let me just actually. Okay. I have also. I have also considered opening a shop with lenticulars. And again, I think this is great.
00:23:53.810 - 00:24:15.368, Speaker A: A lenticular is a completely different version, a different iteration, as I was saying yesterday, of the artwork. And again, the lenticular of a gif. The. Again, the process, I would argue, justifies its existence. Like there's something different. The experience is different. You have your intellectual property, so to speak, from a legal perspective.
00:24:15.368 - 00:24:57.226, Speaker A: And here's just a different manifestation of that intellectual property. One could argue, and this is nothing like if we look at it on a. On a, you know, a gradient scale like, this is nothing as bad as, say, what I would say, which is crossing a line, which is the Magritte foundation, making new prints of a Magritte that have not been signed off on by Magritte, but then just stamping the name on there as it looks like they did in 2010. Right. So to me, that's starting to cross a line. And then you have the whole issue of Keith Haring with those NFTs, which I simply just think they should minted as the Keith Haring foundation. And then it.
00:24:57.226 - 00:25:38.088, Speaker A: To me, it's a lot. Then it's just what it is, right? Owners of the NFTs would be given the option to purchase the print at a discounted price, not free, since there was no physical offer available at the time of the mint. So interesting, kind of combining the NFT, the digital art, and the print together as part of the sale. People often do that. You know, you buy the print or you buy the NFT, you get the print. I haven't figured this out yet, but I like the idea of offering discounts for physical pieces, be it prints or clothing, based on how many digital pieces a collector owns. Anyway, happy to see the overall consensus is that physical prints exceeding the NFT edition number are not a faux pas.
00:25:38.088 - 00:26:01.184, Speaker A: Yes. And I think those numbers should have nothing to do with each other. I see them just from a personal opinion. I see them as different things. I see them as different artworks. I would go so far as to say, again, bringing, say, like, my digital screen memory works. The digital has its own kind of raison d'etre or reason for being the physicals.
00:26:01.184 - 00:26:22.598, Speaker A: With the screen printing, there's a whole bunch of conceptual kind of foundation that goes into that. Right? Like, okay, screen printing, digital makes sense, you know, in terms of getting that, you know, crisp line, there's also. Okay, it's combining mediums. He did it on an inkjet. So then he's screen printing on top. He's combining mediums. He's putting paint.
00:26:22.598 - 00:26:55.078, Speaker A: He's applying, you know, acrylic paint for a digital, basically shape. So there's all sorts of stuff going on. It's its own artwork. It has its own kind of reason for being, interestingly, I would argue so I wouldn't even in my personal world, like. Yeah, like, say the work we saw yesterday that I was showing, I think I did a two edition of, edition of, like, six of those. Then I have a really big one, which is basically an addition of one, maybe two. And then I have a one of one digital NFT.
00:26:55.078 - 00:27:15.234, Speaker A: And they all kind of have their own thing. I basically take what I'd call a loosely warholian perspective on the whole thing. If they're different art, it's different art. Again, Warhol's not going to just make a small mao and then say, I can't make anymore, and then not make the big Mao. Right. Thanks for talking about gallery. Yeah, nice to discover it.
00:27:15.234 - 00:27:40.654, Speaker A: So, let me actually just quickly, sometimes these programs can take a lot of processing power. So here we are, and we got a comment from Google Itis. We're actually going to look at this in a second here. And oxine, captain, not an awkward export, but I love that, too. More like awkward transform. So remember that little area in the axin work that is transform, not awkward export. As I said, probably projecting a little bit.
00:27:40.654 - 00:27:55.230, Speaker A: And thank you to Tura, honest, this was a great comment. My timeline got so beautiful because I connected with many artists that you cover in your channel. Thank you, Anas. And thank you, glyph, killstrike. Achdel. I think I brought this in. Achdel.
00:27:55.230 - 00:28:17.062, Speaker A: It was cool pixel art. Orc, Cran, Thomas, and Bea, thank you for the comment and sense. Thank you all for the comments here. And I wish I could go through each individually, but that would take up probably another 45 minutes. 45 minutes. Yuri, different few hundred iterations of an artwork. Right, so just to our whole discussion.
00:28:17.062 - 00:28:42.836, Speaker A: And of course, Yuri, we'll take the same structure and then just apply different kind of basically coloring techniques, so to speak, on each work, as we saw with, I think it's called the transition series on object. So funny response from Yuri J. There. Go, go light us on the cave. Thanks a lot, Adrian. That's exactly the idea. The work that we started with yesterday, the Plato's cave.
00:28:42.836 - 00:29:10.056, Speaker A: In Plato's time, he didn't have much technology at his disposal to explain how the world could technically be an illusion. Today, it's easier to see how that could happen. We can witness technology unfolding, giving us new words, new concepts to update what Plato wanted to illustrate. Yes, the classical. You know, and it comes up through all of the history of thought. One could argue it's a major distinction between appearance and reality. A major shakespearean theme.
00:29:10.056 - 00:29:36.662, Speaker A: A major theme in Plato, appearance and reality. There are several modern updates to Plato's allegory of the cave. Modern examples include the brain in a jar concept you mentioned, as well as Mark Zuckerberg's oculus quest, offering fresh ways to perceive how such an illusion could be fabricated. I could write for hours about this subject. I'm like an addict. I'll stop there. Thanks for this, Adrian, and thank you, Gogolitis.
00:29:36.662 - 00:29:49.546, Speaker A: Really great to hear from you. And look at this great image of this. Like, it's like Plato's cave now, interestingly. Yeah. So there would. In Plato's cave. So these are the people who are chained up.
00:29:49.546 - 00:30:10.070, Speaker A: And then there is actually. This is the fire, actually. There should be a project. Or, wait, there would be people here, and then there's light, and then at the top, there's actually the entrance to the cave. So it's not a perfect analogy here, this image, but it's pretty close. So pretty cool. This was interesting.
00:30:10.070 - 00:30:35.034, Speaker A: This was in a really interesting thread on just how people, you know, got into or the challenges of being an artist and making it work. It is a superhuman task. So anybody that does it, it's really amazing. I thought this comment by Euxine was super interesting. A lot of people, of course, know oxy. I guess I started to beat depression. Physical art making, not an option with eight to six jobs.
00:30:35.034 - 00:31:17.258, Speaker A: In other words, you know, working 10 hours a day in very small living spaces. Was already doing many of the stuff, but took a loan and got an iPad. I never did digital drawing before or many moving images. I love stepping on untouched grass. Isn't that interesting? I mean, we know Axin had, like, axin is kind of a reference to the zine scene, as far as I understand, akmeans three and made some beautiful zines, if I understood his website properly. But isn't that cool? And, you know, like, very. Yeah, I mean, so it's inspiration to everybody, but, yeah, be ready to work some long hours and do kind of superhuman things in order to make it happen.
00:31:17.258 - 00:31:45.966, Speaker A: And just on uxing, I thought this was hilarious. Children by Robert Miles. That is hilarious. That is, of course a classic kind of, what would you call that? Like an anthem from the late nineties. I kind of had mixed feelings on that track because it was sort of like, I'd call it a guilty pleasure. It was a guilty pleasure, that track, kind of like a trance anthem, but it was just a little sappy. Right? But it was really well done.
00:31:45.966 - 00:32:06.800, Speaker A: So that's hilarious. MC renders I got laid off today and it's been a whirlwind of emotions. I'm not going to let that keep me down. Doing my best to probably process and heal and focus on me. In the meantime, I'll be job hunting, but also taking on some commissions and releasing more art to help me get through this really turbulent time. The dream remains even though we get keep getting knocked down. I only know how to keep getting back up.
00:32:06.800 - 00:32:30.264, Speaker A: So these, you know, just more challenges of, you know, the life of trying to make it as an artist. And at least, you know, you can bring in a few bucks. Even a few bucks when your pay gets cut off is worth something. So, FYI, and good luck to McRenders, keep us updated. I thought this was just an interesting article. 32 minutes. My God.
00:32:30.264 - 00:33:03.332, Speaker A: I probably have to cut the comments a little bit, unfortunately, but please keep leaving them. But maybe I'll just take a few more try and be more highlights. About the comments here, I thought this was just interesting. Masters curating course at Whitechapel Gallery to be wound down and I thought this was interesting. And look at this. Joint initiative with London South Bank University shelved but collaborative PhD project is in the pipeline. So you know what the takeaway for me here was, is sometimes web3 says it needs more curators.
00:33:03.332 - 00:33:41.546, Speaker A: I'm not sure we need more curators. Like what this is telling me is we don't need more curators. If we needed more curators, this course, I mean, this is more trad art, contemporary art or whatever it is. Master's program in curating art and public programs. This tells me we probably don't need. Actually, there's probably too many curators out there, is what I suspect, I don't know why more what I'd call traditional contemporary art curators aren't in this scene. I don't know why that is, because this is, I'd argue, where all the opportunity is, but pretty interesting.
00:33:41.546 - 00:34:21.454, Speaker A: Whilst this marks the end of the collaborative MA in the format, we are actively looking for other ways to develop new initiatives that combine our respective expertise to deliver educational and professional opportunities. We're looking for new ways to build opportunities here. And so it just tells me there's not a ton of opportunity here. The fees for the course were 10,000 pounds for home students, or if you come internationally, 17,500 pounds. The MA is fairly priced. And finally on here, they're gonna new collaborative. So what's the new program? They're gonna do PhD project on digital programming.
00:34:21.454 - 00:34:49.223, Speaker A: So they're going digital. And so the writing is on the wall here, very kind of indirectly, but it tells me we're in the right area. Continuing on stippin pixel halftones. Look at how brilliant this tweet is by stippin Pixel. And I thought just a cool poster and everything. So on Zora, a new show, so to speak, with a lot of familiar artists. And also on foundation, they are going to be introducing generative art.
00:34:49.223 - 00:35:17.112, Speaker A: We're partnering with highlight XYZ to bring generative art to worlds. So generative art coming to foundation worlds, which is pretty cool. Arnaud Pfeffer playing with procreate brushes. So this is hilarious, isn't it? So using the iPad with the pen plotter, that is interesting. And you have to kind of like the impact here. Pretty cool mark making. That is new.
00:35:17.112 - 00:35:36.188, Speaker A: So pretty interesting there. And never get tired of seeing the updates from Helio Santos here back home. And again, look at how great that looks. You know, you see the brown. I mean, it's pretty impressive. And we actually get a. Let me just.
00:35:36.188 - 00:35:54.024, Speaker A: And then we actually get a view. I'm not sure if it's that work. I think it might be. Look at the sky. You know, it looks like paint's being mixed together there. Maybe didn't clean the brush on purpose. Pretty impressive work from Helios Santos with the pen plot, the paint plotter.
00:35:54.024 - 00:36:07.354, Speaker A: Go, go. Lightest. So we looked at this. Okay, excellent, excellent, excellent. And here we have some more chepertum. First test arrived today. Tell me if you're interested in getting a physical piece.
00:36:07.354 - 00:36:28.454, Speaker A: So this looks pretty impressive as well. It looks like it's done on paper. And just a nice, actually, no, that's the wall behind it. And although it does look like it's done on paper, right to the edge here, interestingly, of a digital artwork. So that is interesting. And here we were looking at avant arte yesterday. So Louise Ponce.
00:36:28.454 - 00:37:00.528, Speaker A: Nice. You actually can see over here, these are pretty thick prints. We saw some that were done on aluminum, I think yesterday, a different artist. Was it Alpha Centauri kid? And here we see Luis Ponce working with the same organization here. And pretty nice looking prints, aren't they? I mean, that almost looks like a screen, but it's probably a physical. Like they're very bright. So pretty impressive there.
00:37:00.528 - 00:37:32.596, Speaker A: Continuing on, Jimmy, look at this work in progress. So for those that don't know, Jimmy is the guy. This is what I'd consider a pretty famous work on Tazos rooftop jamming session by Jimmy. Kind of a really classic tezos work. And so Jimmy is going to post a one of one on exchange art, which is Solana. And so this is pretty cool because shares some of the. Jimmy shares some of the breakdown here, all the work that really goes into it.
00:37:32.596 - 00:37:57.508, Speaker A: Jimmy, cool music, actually. Don't know if you can hear that. So just cool to see Jimmy on the scene. A really interesting artist here. And Boo boy looks like new four pieces og painting. See you in at corner House in Bangkok. And it looks like these works, maybe you're going to be physical og painting.
00:37:57.508 - 00:38:18.228, Speaker A: And we saw Buboy working in the studio, I think at one point. So that is interesting. Continuing to the works here. Missed this work here by popple. Reserve of 0.66. So another just kind of cool Sci-Fi pixel artwork by popple. And again, probably using some generative art in here as well.
00:38:18.228 - 00:38:43.784, Speaker A: Combining the pixel art and the generative art. Maybe in the screens here too. Really interesting use of not black, but this kind of almost colored matte here, almost like a reddish black. And just another cool work on foundation. They're kind of ambitious piece here. Edenfall five node of data flow, 700 by 800 gif. And that is 0.66
00:38:43.784 - 00:39:06.664, Speaker A: ETH on foundation. And continuing on, RJ goldfish palette and screens. So Matisse as a screensaver. So maybe referring to our, to the screensaver discussion that went across X. And I thought this was a really nice piece, actually. Nice composition. I'm not sure if this is a Matisse reference on the right, but I just liked it.
00:39:06.664 - 00:39:41.668, Speaker A: What is a screensaver? What is a work of art? Edition of ten. So again, RJ putting out a ton of work, selling it all, making a ton of money. Great work from RJ Zero X. Abigail sculpted serenity and another kind of monochromatic work with a bit of red or color inside of it. And almost these two Ikea like tables here. Not tables, but maybe side tables or whatever you'd call it, on top of each other. So almost giving them kind of human feel or almost an emotional feeling to it.
00:39:41.668 - 00:40:12.264, Speaker A: And I love the shadow here, this kind of simple little architectural area here. And even this line across the floor here kind of makes the work, doesn't it? It grounds it and it just adds this. It gives it a psychological feeling again. I almost think, like, very vaguely like de Curico, you know, it kind of starts giving this life to these inanimate objects. There's something kind of surreal, I'd say, about these works here. Sculpted serenity. The chair becomes a work of art.
00:40:12.264 - 00:40:32.710, Speaker A: So only a tezos $0.84. This was kind of funny. This was Dan control. I missed this one on foundation. And here, kind of a phallic looking fries package from McDonald's here. And you even see. Let me just make it larger here.
00:40:32.710 - 00:40:58.320, Speaker A: You even see Dancontrol's trademark gradients in here as well. So pretty cool piece, actually. Kind of pretty witty work from Dan Control. This was minted on foundation and seven days ago, so I missed that one. Here's grim with a new edition of Tan. And I love the minimalism of this work. None minted so far, so I only have this small version to look at, but I love the minimalism.
00:40:58.320 - 00:41:21.160, Speaker A: This is quite a beautiful version. Tuesday, nice title, too, from Grimm. So Grimm continuing to make really interesting work here. Rosatio, the monster figure in stationery. Interesting variation on Rosatio's work here. With this kind of close ups, so to speak, in this kind of GiF narrative. So interesting piece here.
00:41:21.160 - 00:41:55.444, Speaker A: Interesting kind of narrative, so to speak, for lack of a better term or animation from rosatio. Edition of ten. There are ten left, just minted. And continuing on. I thought this was a really interesting work by human kernel at auction for 25 tezos edition of one, I think human kernel is. Santiago. Look at how great this simple dithered gradient in the background contrasting with this kind of liquidy, Photoshop liquid, you know, let's say filter or effect.
00:41:55.444 - 00:42:22.514, Speaker A: Great contrast here. Like, it's kind of jarring. It's so strong, the contrast, it's kind of jarring. And then just for, you know, good measure, it's almost like the sweater here is a combination of both. It's almost like taking the dithering and then applying whatever kind of liquid smudge tool and applying it to the dithered sweater. So quite brilliant. Looks like a sweater, too, doesn't it? So really interesting work.
00:42:22.514 - 00:42:54.210, Speaker A: One of one at auction for 25 tezos, and people are bidding on it. There's 14 hours to go, you know. Cano, Augustin Cansino. There's something about this collection I really, really like, and I think it's the spirit. I think it's well executed. Soccer street, but I think it's for whatever reason, it's also the spirit of the work that I find really cool, actually. There's something about it.
00:42:54.210 - 00:43:25.566, Speaker A: And not many have been minted, only one minted of soccer game. There's not a lot minted, actually, some of them more than others. But as you see a lot being minted here, I just think it's brilliant. On Zora, like, I brought up one and, like, speakers on the side, there's something about it that I really like, and I don't know what it is. It's very cool. It's just fun. I like the spirit of this work, and it is well executed.
00:43:25.566 - 00:43:45.002, Speaker A: Love the four to the floor pixelation here. But then it deviates from that as well. So it's just. And then these clouds in the background. Just very interesting work here. It's part of a new series, Soccer street, and you can see them all here. Again, it's the spirit of this work that I really love.
00:43:45.002 - 00:44:01.138, Speaker A: And just so. Yeah. Cano and Ugo, the source of our extended discussion this morning. Experimentation. So here, you know, Ugo has put out some pretty cool works. Remember clippy? So cool experimentation there. So here's some more.
00:44:01.138 - 00:44:28.314, Speaker A: Really interesting. Almost like bringing in some kind of airbrushed graphics, gradients into these kind of very large pixelated kind of pixels, for lack of better term, almost taking the previous style and adding gradients on top of it, perhaps. Or, you know, so experimentation there. And here is some more with black background. And here maybe even a clue. No? 1996 software. User friendly software.
00:44:28.314 - 00:44:53.044, Speaker A: So maybe this is old software, too. It sure looks like it. So interesting work from Ugo and DB Cooper. Metropolitan. So just an interesting kind of pixel artwork of basically storefronts here, maybe in Japan or something. And cool little animation here. And a vending machine, interestingly, Tokyo.
00:44:53.044 - 00:45:16.658, Speaker A: And here is actually achdel. So cool work from Actel, which I hadn't seen earlier. So cool pixel artwork here of a kind of castle on a island, or at least a mansion in the middle of an island. Pretty nicely colored here and rendered. So cool work here. 46 edition of 17. And there are 17 left.
00:45:16.658 - 00:45:35.926, Speaker A: So interesting. Nice color here, too, on the side. And continuing on, silva santus with a cool nintendo glitch. Rom here. Kind of playing with the cityscape here. And a demon on top. And cool kind of evening colors here.
00:45:35.926 - 00:45:57.458, Speaker A: So cool work from Silva Santus using contra three anti. So it continues. Francois Gamma walks squared. You know, more creativity from the incredibly prolific francoise gamma, probably from the archive based on the series name, 2009. Look at this, though. Pretty cool. Love how the keeping.
00:45:57.458 - 00:46:19.642, Speaker A: It's like screen record was used in this or something, probably so Santiago with a really. I thought this was a great one. Another nice abstract, kind of a bit more kind of pixelated feeling here. Really nice piece. I love the spacing between everything. This is a pretty nice. But keeping the vector here though, interestingly.
00:46:19.642 - 00:46:32.896, Speaker A: And there. So. And maybe the vector is all across here. So just interesting. Nice piece. I mean, it really kind of jumped out at me on the screen here. And then there's these waffle Zito's from.
00:46:32.896 - 00:46:49.788, Speaker A: You don't know who we are, who is not sure if that is Santiago or someone else. And giving and using Santiago as tools here. And I brought up a couple. So just one of ones. So interesting work. Let's see if they've been listed. Sold.
00:46:49.788 - 00:47:02.796, Speaker A: Art gnome. You know, it's a healthy market out here. There's a lot of collectors like it. Continues. This one is still available. Angry bill. But I'm really impressed at the resilience, the continued resilience.
00:47:02.796 - 00:47:28.770, Speaker A: It's never stopped of this digital art market. It is a global market. It's pretty amazing what's happening here. Again, when you zoom out, confusion, also available for 20 tezos. So I really like also looks like, you know, taking the sampled brush. This is the sample here. If you can see that little square and then dragging it across and then making that into a brush here, you maybe see what was used over here.
00:47:28.770 - 00:47:51.604, Speaker A: There's another one, almost like earrings or something. I really like the light, kind of orange ish beige. Basically. The beige background on these works. Here's another one again, kind of looks like Santiago's vectors here. Vectorized pixels is what they look like. And here's one more zika.
00:47:51.604 - 00:48:09.132, Speaker A: So cool work here from Santiago and Tembal, Ms. Miz, also known as mo s h I t. Karate time. And so just another interesting experimental work here from temple mismis. And cool. Almost looks like video game samples here. Painting with video game samples.
00:48:09.132 - 00:48:29.464, Speaker A: Perhaps we've seen that before. Nicely done here. Interesting. I love the, actually the straight, simple blue fill. It kind of helps the whole work. Maybe that's what you know, weirdly, that's one of the things I really like about this series is the blue background, the simple blue background. It kind of helps.
00:48:29.464 - 00:48:55.884, Speaker A: Zokzo plant book. A pop up book on plants by Zokzo. So let's just load this up. Interesting piece here on Zora. Cool music, as usual. Very fun. Plant book.
00:48:55.884 - 00:49:08.072, Speaker A: Super cool. This is on Zora five. Minted. So far. This is probably a higher res version right here. Nuz oxo plant book. I love it.
00:49:08.072 - 00:49:28.484, Speaker A: This might be older, but it was retweeted, I think, by Ed Morolla. And I'd never seen it before. This is a work from Tezos called the producer. And I thought this was awesome. As someone who kind of likes synths and drum machines and everything, as many of us do. Speakers. This is an awesome work, the producer.
00:49:28.484 - 00:49:45.478, Speaker A: So this is omg I drawed it. And here's some other work. A recent one from OMG I draw it. Edition of 60 from October 27. Open edition and selling at ten tezos each. So a lot of collectors. Nice market.
00:49:45.478 - 00:49:59.374, Speaker A: There's Ahec and Walu right at the beginning. Lewis Osborne. So again, just somehow that escaped me. Very cool. And a couple of skeletons in nature here. Under a night sky. Really cool work.
00:49:59.374 - 00:50:14.378, Speaker A: And here's some of their other work. So great. Really interesting artists here on tazos. More talent on tazos. Sponsor always had an interesting perspective here. The beginning of the week. The first day of the week seems endless.
00:50:14.378 - 00:50:31.306, Speaker A: Or maybe it is. Are we trapped? And always a bit of a Sci-Fi feeling with smonter. And always at these kind of wild angles. And you got to love the diagonal floor here. Another just brilliant composition. Beautiful composition by smonter. Edition of ten for five tezos each.
00:50:31.306 - 00:50:47.954, Speaker A: And all available just minted Yagi's Yilmaz Persona number eleven. And there are a few. I thought this was kind of cool. Kind of a Lego fan. And I thought it looks like a skull actually, underneath. Kind of nicely animated, too. Cool work here.
00:50:47.954 - 00:51:01.058, Speaker A: And this is part of a larger series. This is a one of one for. Let's see if it sold for. Sold for 15. Tezos mentalist 420 has raised the price 100 x. And here are others. So they're all selling out here.
00:51:01.058 - 00:51:32.050, Speaker A: Again, a very resilient market here from Yagi's Yomiz. And continuing on, Timothy Julien with some more interesting works here of these kind of architectural works. Again, removing the outlines and it's creating a different effect. You know, speaking of Rizzo, this kind of looks like it would work as Rezo. Particularly when I see this kind of gradient sky. I mean, it almost looks like Rezo. This would work really well as a Rizzo print.
00:51:32.050 - 00:51:56.104, Speaker A: Of course, Rezo is a. It's kind of seen as the cheap per. You know, the cheap version of screen printing. And it uses photocopiers, colored photocopiers. There's often a Rizo R I s o. There's often a Rizo printer in, like, if you live in a major city, even the smaller city, there's probably a Rizoprinter. You can, you know, probably cost two or $3 maybe each, I'm guessing maybe less.
00:51:56.104 - 00:52:23.140, Speaker A: So it's a cheap way of making an edition. Back to our earlier conversation, like if, let's say this was a one of one or a ten, you know, or let's just say it's an addition of ten as it is. And then Timothy Julien made an addition of 25 in physical. I think that's totally legit, you know, and from my perspective, and I think it might be beautiful. Again, it probably. It's a different work of art. It'll have a different aesthetic impact as a physical.
00:52:23.140 - 00:52:52.066, Speaker A: And that matters to me. That matters in the discussion, I guess. Continuing on, caving wild. Monarchy. Continuing with the abstracts here. Really interesting abstracts, very subtle with these colors here, and nice little treatments here. Almost looking like there's some physical texture being implemented or some kind of noise, which is really interesting when you go minimal, every detail counts.
00:52:52.066 - 00:53:16.738, Speaker A: And that seems to be what caving wild is doing. Addition of five for 250 each. And continuing on, Santiago Ruao. New work available, free, mint on Zora. So as we continue our journey through abstracts here and continuing on, Dylan, with a pretty cool work here. Almost looks like it could work really nice as a woodcut. Kafka digital drawing edition of one.
00:53:16.738 - 00:53:42.658, Speaker A: I think that was ten tazos. And a really nice kind of woodcut feeling to this one, except I don't know how you'd get this part as a woodcut. Like what? Because it almost looks like a brush. Of course, these are made digitally, but when I look at the background here, this stuff looks very woodcut esque. Interesting work. Again, easily screen printed, though, I think. I think so.
00:53:42.658 - 00:54:12.566, Speaker A: Interesting title there, too, from Dylan. Julian Hespenheide converted my very naive density calculations to p five js. So more programming here. And again, if these are small files, I've never made a p five js file, but if they are small files, it does make you think about ordinals or just minting on chain. Kareem safa. Password incorrect. Just a cool, you know, kind of lock sort of theme here in this Kareem safa work.
00:54:12.566 - 00:54:29.032, Speaker A: Very cool. Continuing on, Guan Denarian. There it is. Guandanarian on mint fun, which, from my understanding of the tweet the other day is on Zora. Okay. And we're seeing more and more people. Mint on mint fun.
00:54:29.032 - 00:54:41.804, Speaker A: And here are one of these great pieces. Look at that thing. That's wild. Beautiful. I mean, it's wild. From Guandanarian. Here's another one using arrows just posted to Twitter.
00:54:41.804 - 00:54:59.072, Speaker A: So, having fun over there. And pixelful. Let's actually. I wonder if we can see, like, Gundanarian got that huge. Yeah, 17,500 followers. I wonder if the followers went up a lot after those half a million views. I very much imagine they did.
00:54:59.072 - 00:55:22.736, Speaker A: Pixel fool happy to share that output zero is going to be displayed in Miami on December 6 at Tazo South beach. So cool work here from Pixel fool posted to x. And here's another one. Yugamaku. Another cool animated abstract work here. And just kind of fun to look at here. Eye candy, almost candy colors here too.
00:55:22.736 - 00:55:34.184, Speaker A: So cool work there. And here's one more from Octavia von vFx. VfX graph master guide. Onijiri is ready. Next. Beamfx. Let's go.
00:55:34.184 - 00:56:06.854, Speaker A: So maybe this is just like some sort of video game thing, but I thought it was pretty interesting visually. Visually interesting work here. Maybe it will be minted somewhere, but it doesn't appear so. PP Universal and Maison for another collaboration here. PpCop's soul. So a reference to robocop and some pretty cool digital artistry basically going on in these textures here. Interesting noise, interesting decisions with these kind of stretched out brush marks here.
00:56:06.854 - 00:56:20.554, Speaker A: Great texture. Cool collab here again. And here's another one. And this one is an edition of ten. And the other one is an addition of one for 200 tezos. And here it's an edition of ten. Let's see this one.
00:56:20.554 - 00:56:53.454, Speaker A: Cool vocoder. Cool vocoder effects there. Maison's really good with the music. It wouldn't shock me if Maison made the audio on that one, but I don't know. Maizen has made one of my favorite nfts of all time. It's just a glitch rom of a spaceship going forward with beautiful music. I'll have to bring that up sometime.
00:56:53.454 - 00:57:11.664, Speaker A: Jada and Kota nakazono. A collaboration here. Edition of 20. So interesting take. Almost like a kind of natural setting. And then putting Koda nakazono. Super synthetic artificial works, but that do have a biological feeling to them.
00:57:11.664 - 00:57:28.636, Speaker A: Over top. Interesting work here. 1080 by 1350. Continuum number 173. So interestingly, continuing the continuum series with the collaboration, which is cool. Spiegel's mask monocracy. I'm not sure if this was new or not.
00:57:28.636 - 00:57:46.934, Speaker A: Someone just posted this and I'd never seen it before, but I thought it was an interesting work. Monocracy. Interesting title. Seeming to, you know, have a somewhat. It's almost like democracy, but monocracy and then showing the world. Interesting piece. Never seen that one before.
00:57:46.934 - 00:58:35.972, Speaker A: And Kurt Hussle collective 1997 of the future. And here the work is called clockwatcher and bringing it up on x channel one. So pretty cool. Great music as ever. So just a really cool kind of japanese theme, the retro tv theme, kind of combining everything in this one that is on tea and or on object. And let's just quickly look at the price here. It is only five Tezos edition of 25.
00:58:35.972 - 00:59:04.458, Speaker A: So really cool piece there. You got to be fast with Kurt Hussle collective doctor version, new work, pyramid scene number 14. Sorry, edition of 14. And for Fortezos, really nice piece here by doctor version, kind of the pyramid theme that we've seen a few times. The colors are great, the textures are awesome. Just really nice piece. And here, Ryapp, I think this is a scan.
00:59:04.458 - 01:00:08.886, Speaker A: Scanned and digitally manipulated photo paper. So, you know, again, this whole discussion of physical and digital does start to disintegrate a little bit, let's say, of the physical. And can you have a digital nft of a physical work where you just take the picture? Once you start going back and forth, it really does blur the lines and you just kind of have to go, well, you know, it wouldn't exist without the digital, you know, and does this even exist as a physical? Right, even though it's scanned and paper and everything? So clearly, to me, clearly, this is a digital work, interestingly. But you start to see, you know, but scanned and digitally manipulated photo paper, you start to see how the argument starts to break down a little bit when you really just combine the mediums. So maybe to rune tune's point, you just like whatever the artist feels like doing, and that's that. There shouldn't be any hard rules on not being able to do like a digital NfT of a physical work. Continuing on, can accept a, you know, maybe it's a case by case basis, really, or just depends on the collector.
01:00:08.886 - 01:00:37.492, Speaker A: So some new works on Zora and can accept as one of the more like just very far out original artists here. Takes a lot of risks. Spectral anomaly, like just consistently wild. Love those little pixels at the bottom for contrast there. And, you know, bright rainbow under, you know, this monochromatic kind of mountainous landscape. Again, a nice contrast. And here's another one with these wild AI looking pixels, I believe they are.
01:00:37.492 - 01:01:05.138, Speaker A: Yeah. And here's a little bit of AI here. So a dali two image, you know, a really interesting artist, AI artist here with Kinexapta, so on Zora. And here's Sabato is stable diffusion Excel 1.0. So another reference to this version of stable diffusion to generate photographs whose compositions begin from the river and extend to the sea. And some of the outputs were quite beautiful. So that is.
01:01:05.138 - 01:01:29.134, Speaker A: It is quite beautiful and great results here. So look at this. Look at what these machines are making here with a little bit of prompting. I mean, pretty interesting imagery here from Sabato. White solitude, the ocean artwork by white solitude in collaboration with AI. And so this is a painting. And of course, white solitude is quite good at the painting textures here.
01:01:29.134 - 01:01:47.774, Speaker A: And so interesting piece here with this kind of pink sky reflecting on the swimmer here, one of one for 40 tezos. And here is graphica with a cool work. Ghost love. Nice title. And very kind of mark making. A lot of mark making on this work. I'm not sure if it's new or not.
01:01:47.774 - 01:02:04.440, Speaker A: I assume it's new and interesting. Very painterly. I think there's some AI and maybe some collage in the mix. Nice little mark there, too. Great work. Just great work. And here, of course, is Lily Illo.
01:02:04.440 - 01:02:22.464, Speaker A: Architects may come and architects may go. So architects and chairs continues. And I think it's a really cool association, architects and chairs. It has its own logic and I see it. I think it's great. A great concept here, subtle concept. And I love this, actually, blue stripe here.
01:02:22.464 - 01:02:49.984, Speaker A: We're back to these stripes along the side. And even the nice little shadow that kind of curves a little bit, a little bit of variation in it. And of course, these AI distortions here and here, the chair turns into a hand. Cool work there. And of course, strange thing with another Renaissance masterpiece here. Palm angels. So with a Costa coffee cup here and smoking a cigar, the guy in the balaclava.
01:02:49.984 - 01:03:16.224, Speaker A: So again, remarkably strong work, I would say. Just there's something. It's like the same things that are appealing to you in a Renaissance painting. Many of those same things are here. And this wonderful color. Like, I feel like the colors are being sampled, but maybe treated from original oil paintings. And even the reflection here, the physicality of this work, it's just remarkable.
01:03:16.224 - 01:03:47.082, Speaker A: Danielle King with the artificial memory, artificial childhood memory series cross country meet, just listed on foundation. So I thought this one was particularly powerful here. It looks like an artificial. Put it this way, it has the sense of both the sentiment of an old memory and the nostalgia. But also you feel the artificiality at the same time. Like, I quite like this. You can tell it feels real, but you can tell it's fake is almost where I'm going with that.
01:03:47.082 - 01:04:06.558, Speaker A: So that is on foundation. And here it is at 15. And Gogolite has posted this. This is Mordunkus revisiting a workflow from last week. And this is kind of wild. It's like, it's totally disturbing actually, this AI here. And as you see here.
01:04:06.558 - 01:04:25.134, Speaker A: And we'll just kind of scan through it here. I mean, pretty wild, almost repulsive. In a good way. Mordunkas in a good way. So just interesting work. And just a final comment. Chris Keshtanova Microsoft has removed all mentions of Dali three from their Bing website.
01:04:25.134 - 01:04:46.888, Speaker A: So following all that OpenAI drama. So that is kind of interesting. Into the physicals, just a couple here as we wrap up early at an hour and four minutes. Green hand by Alex Gray. So we don't really get a great view. Here it is. So a new work by Alex Gray.
01:04:46.888 - 01:05:21.848, Speaker A: And you see it's like a hand. And of course Alex Gray, the visionary artist, probably the most renowned psychedelic artist in the world and for a long time now, maybe for 20 years, has held that mantle, I would argue. So interesting piece here, as you see. Interesting. It almost looks like art matter, but that is just underpainting texture. So just interesting piece here from Alex Gray. And you know what else is interesting about this is how Alex Gray is on X discussing it.
01:05:21.848 - 01:05:53.344, Speaker A: So very interesting, isn't it? And he's talking about the work. And I just think that's interesting because you don't see a ton of trad art world painters coming on X to discuss their work. Like, I don't see Richard Prince coming on X, for example, or whoever the people are, they're usually more mysterious and just sit in the background. But I would say to Alex Gray's credit, discussing his work on X. So pretty cool there. This is a very interesting peace. Ok.
01:05:53.344 - 01:06:12.372, Speaker A: Automobile and motorcycle. I thought this was a great, what looks like a physical to me. Great drawing. Super original. Great piece over there. And that is your show, my friends. So we'll see you on the Twitter space tomorrow with Michaela Colonna and Rune tune and myself.
01:06:12.372 - 01:06:15.284, Speaker A: Thank you for joining me. And until next time, take care.
