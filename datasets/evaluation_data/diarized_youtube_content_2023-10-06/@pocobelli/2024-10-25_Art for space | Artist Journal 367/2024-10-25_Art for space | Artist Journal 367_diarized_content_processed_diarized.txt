00:00:04.480 - 00:00:37.949, Speaker A: If NFTs are dead, I think we need a new name for them because it took me three hours, over three hours to put together everything of significance that I could find for this show. So apologies in advance. We're going to run through it. Artist Journal, October 25, 2024. Broadcasting from the pirate ship of the mind, Scotch tape, scissors and all. Or to quote our good friend in the sky, Lee Scratch Perry, straitjacket and all. My name's Adrian Pocabelli.
00:00:37.949 - 00:01:15.297, Speaker A: On a mission. On a mission that's there's no other kind of mindset that it just has to be done. And so again, I'm gonna try and move fast here, otherwise we're gonna have a three hour show, which I simply do not have time for. So let's go. Many of you will know the artist. It is Marcelo Pinel, putting out a work after a bit of a hiatus, I don't want to say too long, but hasn't put out a work recently that I've seen that I've noticed. Look at the magic carpet or whatever.
00:01:15.297 - 00:01:37.521, Speaker A: Maybe the. Maybe magic carpet's not the right word. The, you know, Arab design. A carpet here with, I think it's a Sufi. As I step all over these cultural references here, let me get this right. Based on the Sufi poem, excellent. The conference of the birds and Persian mythology and miniatures.
00:01:37.521 - 00:02:54.285, Speaker A: The legend of Simurgh, which I have never heard before, but doesn't it just. I have a feeling like there's so many things to say about Marcelo Pinel, but the first thing I was going to say is I have a feeling the people that, you know, the culture that this came from, and I imagine this myth is probably hundreds of years old, those original people, where this myth was kind of, I'm assuming, quite a. Wasn't just a kind of a folk tale, but more of something, you know, representing maybe their religion. I mean, I'm sure it still is, but maybe had a more immediate impact, shall we say? I'm sure those people, perhaps a thousand years ago, maybe 14, 1500 years ago, I bet they would have liked this. I bet they would have loved this. And that is one of the things I want to talk about, which is remember how Alex Gray followed Marcelo Pinell on Twitter or on X. And of course, Alex Gray being kind of, you could argue, I'd say almost undisputably, of course, you can always debate these things, you know, the kind of, you know, for lack of better term, you know, king of visionary art.
00:02:54.285 - 00:03:31.567, Speaker A: And how when, when Alex Gray followed Marcelo Pindel to Me, even though it may have not have been thought of this way, to me was almost kind of in my own universe, so to speak. It was kind of a passing of the baton to a certain degree. And what do both of these artists share? And of course, we have no time to go into Alex Gray. But for those that have no idea what I'm talking about, let's look at Alex Gray. You've seen it probably at the Hard Rock Cafe. There is Alex Gray. There's Net of being.
00:03:31.567 - 00:03:53.547, Speaker A: I remember seeing that in New York when he had a studio in. What is the name of that neighborhood, with all the galleries. That was maybe 2007. Yeah, there you are. Sanctuary of Visionary Art. Now, I guess some of these have moved to this place in somewhere in northern New York State. Cosm, I think is called.
00:03:53.547 - 00:04:15.819, Speaker A: But let me theologue. I also saw this in person. There is nothing quite like seeing this in person. By the way, I saw this. I love this work on the Internet early on. And I'll get back to my point about what they share with our friend Marcelo Pinell. This is unbelievable in person.
00:04:15.819 - 00:04:37.995, Speaker A: It's like oil on cotton or something like this. Let's see if we can get it slightly bigger here. Theolog. This really does not do justice to this work. But what do you see here? Do I need any sort of learning? And forgive the computer. That's how much is loaded up here. So as far as tabs.
00:04:37.995 - 00:05:05.125, Speaker A: So it's just. That is the situation that we're in. I the. So what do we have here? You don't need any learning, you don't need any culture, so to speak. Not much. You can just be a human in the world and you can appreciate this work is where I'm going with this. This has kind of what I would call a universal appeal, right? I mean, it's dealing with universal subject matter.
00:05:05.125 - 00:05:50.359, Speaker A: A body, a nervous system, the chakras in a landscape. Existence, Theologue, you know, a human form, you know, with this kind of Buddhist pose, right. And the halo or, you know, meditating, so to speak, with existence kind of firing up almost like a kind of Buddha, right? But beyond that, more universal. It is just a nervous system. Is it Buddha, Jesus, you know, all of the religious, you know, figures in one. Is it none of them? Is it us? It is us, I would argue. So we return here and I would say it's kind of a similar thing.
00:05:50.359 - 00:06:31.149, Speaker A: Maybe you need to know the myth here to get the full impact. But what I would say is there's something universal about this work and about this whole style is where I'm going with this. I don't need to know this myth to love this artwork, right? There is a universality. And there is again, for me, like, yeah, to me, this is the digital kind of. This is the next generation, so to speak, of kind of visionary art. It's digital. And of course it is, I would argue, provocative thesis to get us started.
00:06:31.149 - 00:07:04.479, Speaker A: Maybe more of a hypothesis than anything. But looking here, and unfortunately, because it's video, I mean, what would this be as a gif? Could you get it as high res? I don't know. It's an interesting question. Svg, is that even possible? Bitcoin? So you see the. The, like the beautiful wings here. Unfortunately, again, this is max size here. And these kind of, you know, so what you're, you know, so you see the colors moving through this kind of still image.
00:07:04.479 - 00:07:43.965, Speaker A: In a sense, we see what I'd call dynamism, but not necessarily animation. It's not like the wings are moving back and forth, even though there is an illusion of that to a certain degree. Look at the clouds and the frame, I might add. And I brought up just for the sake, so we can see. And I showed this briefly last show. These are the outlines, right? So this is how Marcelo Pinel makes the work. Starts with this incredibly gorgeous illustration, frankly, an art piece unto itself, which I think is sellable, by the way.
00:07:43.965 - 00:08:34.801, Speaker A: You could even do different colors on that one. And then we see here what looks like a couple of stills by Marcelo Pinedis on Instagram. This is pretty spectacular too, where it's turned almost into a relief, a gold relief. And again, if this was like 500 years ago, I think you could make, you know, you have a design for a Donatello. Like, you know, in terms of, okay, we'll make it 2 or 3 centimeters deep, max. You know, I guess you'd call that a light relief sculpture, right? I mean, here you have the designs, right? I mean, and these days you could probably just manufacture that. Hilariously, I don't know if you can put, like, gold into a printer.
00:08:34.801 - 00:09:13.699, Speaker A: That would be quite the experiment, wouldn't it? So very beautiful work here. Interestingly, avoiding all the debates here that unfortunately. Well, or fortunately, look at all this debate we're going to have here on the platforms. But avoiding the whole platform debate. Interesting question. Where does Marcelo Pinnell mint? Like, if you're Marcelo Pinnell and you're going, where do I put this thing? Where am I going to get the most bang for your buck? And I think that's A good way to think. By the way, as an artist you should be thinking about this if you're not.
00:09:13.699 - 00:10:18.761, Speaker A: You know, like I might be able to say personally, maybe the works I put on bitcoin put on bitcoin or I'm going to put on bitcoin or whatever, maybe I can make as much money or more even or as much let's say by putting it on object where I know there's going to be collectors and everything in on. But I do think of the time aspect and hey, this is going on bitcoin this perhaps if the devs don't get rid of ordinals, which I'm not convinced they won't by the way, when I see the mempool having followed the mem pool and the busyness, I do wonder if the devs will get rid if there's another update on bitcoin, if they will actually get rid of it. So I do wonder that to myself, stamps, as Santiago Izzakotl has said, are not. You can't get rid of them. Whereas ordinals I think in theory you can in theory with updates to the blockchain. So deciding to put it on Solana, which not a bad idea. I mean 5 SOLs, so not cheap.
00:10:18.761 - 00:10:48.205, Speaker A: 867 it's not super popular. I'd say Solana right now, interestingly, but people are still minting there. So just an interesting choice. 2048 by 2048. Because are you going to put on foundation now? Is Marcelo Pinell on super rare? I'm pretty sure he is. So. But again, you know what, I guess this would be a reserve of like 0.3
00:10:48.205 - 00:11:07.505, Speaker A: or something on super. That must be the debate in I would say in Marcelo Pinell's head. But again, we're going to see this. We're kind of anticipating the debate. Why? You know why. Which blockchain? So all to say, sometimes it just feels right. The beach series I did on Solana, I actually made a series.
00:11:07.505 - 00:11:34.461, Speaker A: I was like I want to make a series that feels like Solana. And of course there were suns and sunsets. Almost too didactic as my friend would say. But I love those works and I actually have more in the pipeline. So all to say, Marcelo Pinella getting us started. The Sufi mystic here again, my favorite part probably is the carpet here, this two dimensional carpet. Again we saw this.
00:11:34.461 - 00:12:09.795, Speaker A: Sometimes we see it with Picasso clothing where it just ignores like the actual folding of the clothes and you just put the pattern, I think Matisse. Another thing, you almost see it here where it's almost just like a straight up wallpaper, but it's at an angle, but you just kind of fill it. There's something really charming about that. We see it in what the Sufi is wearing here. So a grand. A beautiful work. And capturing the mysticism, I would argue, of whatever the story is.
00:12:09.795 - 00:13:31.225, Speaker A: And, you know, finally, when we think of medieval stained glass, right, and the lack of literacy in medieval times, one of the functions of art was to communicate these stories, right? And I think we see a very similar thing here, because if I went to the church over and over, or I went to the place where this was shown over and over with my congregation, sooner or later, probably someone would tell me the story, if not the, you know, whatever the equivalent of a priest is. And then eventually, and I would know the story and I could look at that and I'd know, you know, people, someone would tell me the story. So kind of also, weirdly, again, there's something very universal in appeal, but almost over time and again, just using rainbow colors and outlines, there's. For all of the complexity of this work, I would argue it's actually a fairly simple work. You could argue in the sense that we're using outlines and cycling kind of gradients and, you know, with very complex effect, but kind of simple concept. One could argue a brilliant drawing, which I think should be noted. Final thing I want to say on this before we continue to run.
00:13:31.225 - 00:14:23.885, Speaker A: I love this interesting breaking of the frame here in the bird, here the clouds. Very interesting way of bringing the piece to life, interestingly. And it is reminiscent again of almost where you start to see Michelangelo painting architecture, to take an inverted way of looking at it. You know, on the Sistine Chapel, painting the architecture, or sometimes in Italian painting, you'll see them almost painting what looks like sculpture, but it's not. Or you look at the ceiling and it looks like, you know, there's all this illusionistic things to me that also kind of fits in here. So all sorts of super interesting decisions. A universal image, I would argue, despite not knowing the story.
00:14:23.885 - 00:15:02.185, Speaker A: The conference of Birds and Persian Mythology and miniatures Animation by Marcelo Pinell. So pretty rad. To quote our friend Hasdrubal Waffle. This was super interesting. If you haven't heard HP Lovebucks on Post Americana, a very interesting discussion on really what America means today. And we went into some pretty interesting territory on the role of the artist within a landscape of cultural engineers and all this sort of thing. Fascinating discussion.
00:15:02.185 - 00:15:26.083, Speaker A: Thank you. You know, it's funny, Blue Alley. Thank you for the Comments here. I actually have works that I've made of this specific image of the Challenger disaster in 1986. I remember it very, very well. When I was seven years old I actually made phone works in kind of commemorating that image. So it's interesting that you send this.
00:15:26.083 - 00:15:37.027, Speaker A: Those were done on the iPhone. I'll have to bring those out. Maybe I meant those. So comments on last show. Thank you for the support. Still here. Andre Summer Blues.
00:15:37.027 - 00:15:46.373, Speaker A: Awesome to hear from you. Thank you for the comment. Runetoon. Thanks for the feature. My absolute pleasure. Of course. Runetoon as well as on that show that I just showed you.
00:15:46.373 - 00:16:17.211, Speaker A: The intrepid co host of the Twitter spaces we've been doing for almost two years now on Wednesdays. This was a great comment here as well from Jim. GFM Art for space. I love it. What a great set of self imposed criteria to play with. Keeping the file size down and seeing what's possible. It's what the old game devs used to do and there's a lot of overlap, isn't there? Those tech limitations forces them to be creative.
00:16:17.211 - 00:16:40.517, Speaker A: Indeed. Elite springs to mind a space sim that had eight galaxies of 254 systems each, all in the grand storage space of 22 kilobytes of memory. That's an art form in itself. Indeed. This is huge. And I'm so glad Jim that you mentioned this because I say a lot of things on this program. I don't necessarily remember everything I say.
00:16:40.517 - 00:18:12.555, Speaker A: I think I would have probably remembered this. But this is important. Like it's a whole way of thinking about making art, you know, for okay, 100 years from now, may not even be that long, could be in our lifetimes that we may start to be flying around here. It's not that far. So as digital artists, I mean, and you know, let's say there are starting to be colonies, you know, on Mars, on, across the solar system or even we just start flying around a little more, you know, then how cool is digital art going to seem again? And where you know you're going, especially in the early days of this, every gram of what you're packing onto that spaceship is going to count. So if you want art, I would hazard to say it's going to be digital, right? And further, as we were discussing here, is it going to be some massive file? Maybe the Internet will not be an issue, but probably it's going to be. Even the communications between places because of the huge distances involved, the epic like incomprehensible distances involved, it's probably going to be the smaller the better if you want some art on your wall in terms of the bite size to your point, shall we anticipate making art for space? Provocative.
00:18:12.555 - 00:18:24.303, Speaker A: Wonderful idea. I'm so glad that resonated with you. Thank you for the comment. Also on X. Thank you for the massive support here. What a wonderful community this is. Golo.
00:18:24.303 - 00:18:38.775, Speaker A: Haven't had time lately to catch up on all your videos, but they continue to inspire. I need to get a second monitor so I can work on art and watch at the same time. Been working hard. Can't wait to share soon. Love the consistency of your content. It keeps the flame lit. Thank you.
00:18:38.775 - 00:19:25.631, Speaker A: I could not recommend more getting a second monitor not just to watch this show. You know what else it's good for? I mean among it's it's a real visual luxury. First, first of all, it's just great to have the space. But you know what it's really good for if you're making digital art and I imagine some people would echo this, some artists would echo the sentiment. You kind of want to see your work on different screens because one screen isn't necessarily. You kind of want to see because it'll, you'll see it looks different and so you want to make sure you're seeing on a few different screens. So another reason, at least a couple is always there's another benefit, shall we say, to having multiple screens.
00:19:25.631 - 00:19:35.807, Speaker A: Thank you for the comment. Golo. Great to hear from you. Yann Lucas Magone. Good journal day. Thank you Yan. We have a beautiful work by Yan Magone in our epic episode in front of us here.
00:19:35.807 - 00:19:46.095, Speaker A: Great to hear from you. Daniel W. Thanks for the COVID Who of course we started the show with here. Daniel W. Love the deep dive into the piece. Glad you enjoyed it. And yep, those are mushrooms all right.

And look at who else we heard from Giomariani who is back on the scene. Thanks for the mentioning kind words Pokebally. That means a lot.
00:21:17.829 - 00:21:41.593, Speaker A: I'm happy to be back. So it is official and we actually have I think four or five works by Geo this episode. Just releasing a whole bunch here on Tezos. Let us continue and quick look at the community here. 640 members growing nicely. Here's yacht Death is the Last Hope and that is on Ethereum. So cool.
00:21:41.593 - 00:21:52.245, Speaker A: Kind of skeleton illustration. Almost looks like a physical, doesn't it? Maybe a combination. Texadelic. Great to hear from you. Acid Reindeer. Howdy from Texas. Awesome.
00:21:52.245 - 00:22:09.113, Speaker A: Thank you for posting. Arya, thank you for posting. Reflections on Place and Space. Something so kind of a digital work. Kind of interesting effect. Digital effects on that one. Or maybe dragging the work across.
00:22:09.113 - 00:22:27.405, Speaker A: There's Chamaland with her mate gm new mint on object. Glitchy dreams. Cool. And that almost looks like Chama. Great to hear from Chama of course out of Buenos Aires. Super cool people out of Buenos Aires there. Thank you for posting.

00:23:10.507 - 00:23:34.029, Speaker A: All good, all good. Thank you for posting that. And you never know, maybe we get a little support of some kind. ROKO 9:00am Russian Roulette okay. Edgy, very edgy. I mean beautifully rendered I might add for this very Edgy work. So the the community just on fire here.
00:23:34.029 - 00:23:52.045, Speaker A: Just wanted to say we came a digital illustration I made in 2008 part of the album art from Fauna. Nice piece here. Maybe should mint Sentaro and Federmare. Good mornings. I think we already saw one from Fatemare. Just once a week if you can. Ilya Beribin but cool looking work by the way.
00:23:52.045 - 00:24:14.725, Speaker A: Nice illustrations. Ilya Beribin with some work here. As we see the happy face get ground through last animations. Listen to the voice acting. So unfortunately we have to run but people can listen to it here in the community. Nahid with work as well. Very cool looking painting that's on object and my two cents.
00:24:14.725 - 00:24:37.037, Speaker A: Okay so we are through. We are through the community. Thank you everybody for posting. Pretty amazing all that work Artnet so the art detective. We don't have a ton of time to go through this but I did want to keep a keep on top of what's happening. So of course there's the art fair in Paris. Art Basel Paris.
00:24:37.037 - 00:24:53.785, Speaker A: The buyers are back in Paris the mood was buoyant even if not everyone was selling. Museums open blockbusters. Sotheby's christened its new home with a white glove sale. And the rich embraced optimism. So interesting. So a little bit of the dark cloud passing. I wanted to go through the pictures.
00:24:53.785 - 00:25:07.623, Speaker A: That's all we have time for. So just enjoying a nice wine in Paris here. That's by Katya Kazkino, the art director. Sorry the art detective. And here a clean Paris. Scrubbed clean and fresh faced. You know that is.
00:25:07.623 - 00:25:33.351, Speaker A: You know that matters when you're visiting a city it makes a huge difference. So here is inside Hauser and Wirth's booth. And I think we actually saw this in another interesting painting here. Maybe a better photo of this painting. Nice texture there. There are a few. Here's a Picasso visitor Poses by Picasso's La Finet Ouvert the open window Namad Galleries booth.
00:25:33.351 - 00:25:58.797, Speaker A: So as part of the VIP opening. Interesting Picasso by the way nice Picasso. Never seen that one before. And so here this was at this Art Povera show at Bours de Commerce. So maybe the stock exchange had I think that's what bullseye stocks. I don't know what so I assume Booster come else is a stock exchange. Here's a Pollock show.
00:25:58.797 - 00:26:14.693, Speaker A: So lots going on. Musee Picasso. Right so but kind of you know so early Pollock. Same same old in a sense. And I think there was Dana Schutz's new exhibition at David Zwerner. Interesting. So David Soerner in Paris.
00:26:14.693 - 00:26:28.197, Speaker A: So a little screenshot there. And here's the Tom Wesselman show. This was at Fondation Louis Vuitton. So big show there. And here's a Magritte. I think this is Sothby's at Pompidou. Surrealism.
00:26:28.197 - 00:26:45.923, Speaker A: This was at Georges Pompidou, which is going to close for five years. Interestingly, this is at the surrealism show. I should try and go to that. Too many things to do, but I would love to go to that. This looks like Wesselman. Tom Wesselman smoking, banting at Gagosian's booth. Interesting.
00:26:45.923 - 00:26:56.611, Speaker A: Maybe deciding to put a Wesselman because of the show that was up. Perhaps. Look at the. No wonder people felt optimistic, though. The light. The light. Especially for visual people.
00:26:56.611 - 00:27:21.977, Speaker A: Right? And here, this Daly work, I think did quite well, interestingly. Kind of had a low. Had a low reserve, but I think it went for quite a bit more like three or four times the reserve. Here's also the surrealism exhibition. Beautiful Max Ernst here. Not sure if these are Leonora Carrington. Maybe if I had to guess on each side.
00:27:21.977 - 00:27:43.837, Speaker A: And this also looks like the. Nope, this is Nera Rosler booth. Wooden sculptures, Afro, Brazilian sculpture. And there's Katya Casakina, senior reporter at artnet, the art detective. Also, how Picasso's friend Heinz Bergrun amassed one of the world's biggest private art collections. This Financial Times. So another Picasso show.
00:27:43.837 - 00:28:20.395, Speaker A: You know, like, I've been joking about this for like a decade of like, oh, it's another Picasso show. A joyous show at Paris's Musee de l'orangerie, a beautiful museum just outside the Louvre, if I Remember correctly. Includes 50 works by the Spaniard alongside others by Matisse and Clay. So again, these painterly works, the modernism keep getting returned to. Interestingly, this is beautiful. What I love about Picasso and I'm, you know, again, I feel like I've seen it all to death. But I love how I can keep seeing new works.
00:28:20.395 - 00:28:38.231, Speaker A: You do. It does feel kind of endless. Even this Matisse I've never seen before. There's really something to be said for making a ton of work, you know, and just kind of releasing everything. I make actually quite a bit of work. You might be surprised to know I don't release most of it, though. And I'm in.
00:28:38.231 - 00:29:07.983, Speaker A: As I was in the shower this morning, I was like, I need to break through and just start releasing a lot of stuff. I, you know. So anyways, Paul Clay. Interesting. Paul Clay. And I think that's. That is the collector so interesting so another Picasso show so Marco so referring to the whole so debate foundation not quite closing down but kind of taking a backseat to rodeo.
00:29:07.983 - 00:30:24.591, Speaker A: So foundation is a very prominent for those that don't know digital art NFT platform right on Ethereum mostly but also expanded to base and so Marco I'm happy about the latest developments because they confront the space with a proverbial elephant in the room. So thanks to unknown collector and also Marco quoting from the show I think the key at the end of the day is if you have an art business you have to make it about the art. Another comment I might have just completely forgot about hilariously so anyways I'm glad people are watching first of all I appreciate that and I'm glad people are finding it interesting and that they're actually there's takeaways here. Let's see what Marco says. It's quite some months I write about it. Those who follow me know it. We've been marketed to like air conditioners and the culture threw this under the carpet because web3 yet yada yada sooner or later an art market although small will fully develop and exactly like when you see all the art in this show it's going to be maybe NFTs are dead but whatever's going on in like with all of these artworks like it's I wish you know I was almost joking to myself I wish it was dead so the show could be shorter because whatever is going on here is definitely not getting smaller.
00:30:24.591 - 00:31:05.993, Speaker A: It's getting to be too much for me to do here in terms of just cover everything. I again need to take a radical decision here and just go okay there's only going to be 20 works in the next show. All right and maybe 10 tabs and then let's see anyways the social minting monetizing will hopefully develop as well. There are different approaches the good different niches will force to abandon the Web3 rhetoric and focus on content or hype anyway a clear goal. You know the one and only insufferable thing in this space is hype sold as art. It will be much more difficult to mix things up from now on. Thanks X for not allowing me okay so so anyway thank you unknown collector that got a lot of traction that post by unknown collector.
00:31:05.993 - 00:31:57.375, Speaker A: So thanks for that I within the cool context of this whole thing I think super rare you know which often gets criticized I think does deserve credit here's super rare John. You know building a new building new markets is hard. We're six and a half Years in and still building. And they do deserve credit for that. Like, you know, because we've seen Zora kind of came and went, you know, within the span of a year. Foundation came and then, you know, it's not disappeared as we're actually hilariously going to see. You know, I'm seeing more mints of artists at least that I track over here, which is hilarious anyways, all to say, I think superware deserves some credit at the end of the day, they are still here, like and everybody can say what they want about it being a closed platform, including myself.
00:31:57.375 - 00:32:22.157, Speaker A: Okay, is that better? Is that worse? At least they are committed, right? You know, we can say that WG meets Do you know who need. Don't know who needs to hear this. But foundation still works. I thought this was hilarious actually. So it still does function as far as I understand. Pixelosopher. I delisted all my unsold from foundation for 5 reasons.
00:32:22.157 - 00:32:47.675, Speaker A: I don't trust the platform anymore. It doesn't seem like they're committed. You know, to use the committed word, there is a sense that foundation, they like. You know, some people are saying, oh well, you know, this is all over hyped. Foundation isn't closing down. But I didn't see any tweets unless I just missed them saying, hey, you know, this is all wrong and we're completely committed. It was sort of like my impression.
00:32:47.675 - 00:33:40.107, Speaker A: It's actually the. It's so similar to what happened on zora, if not the same, which is they at least on Zora. My impression, and I think this is what kind of rubbed a lot of artists the wrong way was they didn't need to shut down the original platform, which people really liked and did well with. They shut it down because they want everybody to go to their new platform with the free mint art coin sort of paradigm. And I think that's ultimately what, you know, rubbed people the wrong way with Zora for some people. Some people love it still and that's totally cool. Right? But I just to understand like the mentality here and I, I wonder to myself, is this the same thing with Foundation? It's like almost like, hey, if we don't kill foundation, then are the artists.
00:33:40.107 - 00:34:12.204, Speaker A: The artists just aren't going to move. So it's kind of trying to push artists rather than attract artists with something that works with this experimental thing that frankly I don't see working. We're going to see an example of that. Maybe it is working and maybe I'm wrong. Right? But I just from even as someone the passionate people in the space aren't really like, oh, I'm enjoying this so much. If anything, it's like, you know, it's the opposite from collectors and artists, interestingly so again. So who is this working for? Let's continue.
00:34:12.204 - 00:34:33.684, Speaker A: I don't create content as if it were pennies worth. That's disrespectful to my collectors and my work. So no rodeo for me. The works I sold were my own doing. So no hard feelings on curators like Super Chief, Historic crypto, Nuclear samurai. I only appreciate you, and hopefully we can work together elsewhere. I will too, pivot individually, minting elsewhere on my own contracts and making more physical stuff.
00:34:33.684 - 00:34:47.061, Speaker A: I feel foundation extracted value from my work and others and my collectors, and that's disappointing. It's time to go punk again. I. I don't know. I don't know if I would go so far. It's time to go punk again. The spaces feels devoid of meaning right now.
00:34:47.061 - 00:34:59.565, Speaker A: It's art. It's art. It's not just images, it's people's lives. Which is a good point. I don't know if they just. To me, I guess that's one way of looking at it. I wouldn't see it.
00:34:59.565 - 00:35:58.447, Speaker A: I think they did it while it seemed to work for them and while it made sense for them, and then they moved on. My sense, like, my kind of take on that isn't that they had such bad intentions while they were doing it. I think they probably had great intentions. My sense is, though, like, the error that perhaps is being made, if I were to speculate the same one that Zora made, is this kind of lack of understanding, I would argue, of what was occurring on their chains, the cultural significance of what was occurring. Because I feel like if they did understand that, there's no way that they would ever sacrifice these platforms and risk, you know, alienating the artists that are on it. But that's just my take, and I could be completely wrong. And maybe nobody cares about this scene 50 years or 10 years or two years from now, right? So who knows? But that's my sense of the error that was made here.
00:35:58.447 - 00:36:36.125, Speaker A: So I don't see super bad intentions, but I do see maybe priorities being different, like, okay, money over art. Bringing us back to that comment I was making last show, right? About, if you're going to have an art business, make it about the art, Pablo. So this is quite long, so I'm going to run through it here. As I've said many times, the Web3 Marketplace model has been Broken for a while now, and it was flawed from the start. Should we discard the whole thing? Absolutely not. There are excellent tools being built that can expand the reach and impact of the cultural revolution we're witnessing. However, this current model is unsustainable, both for the companies behind it, even in a bull market, and for the artists relying on it.
00:36:36.125 - 00:37:29.735, Speaker A: How much does it cost? Like, I mean, again, I'm kind of back to like, is this costing. How much does it cost to run a website? Like, I understand you need some devs, right? To do updates you need. But I mean, are these huge? Are they not getting enough in fees? Like, clearly not, right? So it's kind of interesting. And if foundation can run with nobody basically running it, so to speak, do we need all these people behind it? It's kind of interesting. I mean, I wonder to myself, like, is this an admin problem where there's too many hires, right? Too many people, too many employees, unfortunately. Like, you know, who knows? It's the sun enters the conversation here. For those shouting Web3 and F the establishment, I get the idealism, but it's important to realize that without.
00:37:29.735 - 00:38:09.821, Speaker A: Is anybody actually saying that? But it's important to realize that without right. Incentives for companies, this new promise will fail before it even begins. Without a sustainable model, these platforms won't exist for artists to use in the first place. What's missing? While decentralization and its promise are exciting, the reality is that art itself has little to do with the blockchain. This I agree with, unless you're talking about the small subset of artists using the blockchain as their medium. Indeed, it is a means to an end for 98% of the artists here. It's a way to sell your work in a credible way, digital work in a credible way, kind of end of story to a certain degree.
00:38:09.821 - 00:39:02.439, Speaker A: For most, blockchain is just a tool, useful for provenance, broader reach, and indeed financial transactions, but not integral to the artistic process. What's more, it's, as I always say here, blockchain's, you know, one of the, you know, you could call it like a primitive use cases of blockchain is buying and selling digital objects, in this case, digital art. And that was like, as I've pointed out many times here before, we didn't really have a. We didn't, we didn't have a solution. I would argue before blockchain, that was what I would call credible. Giving a certificate of authenticity in a USB with a copy of your JPEG on it is, in my opinion, pretty Lame, right? Now, people did it because they had no choice. And so not judging, but just from my personal perspective, would I ever buy anything like that? Hell no.
00:39:02.439 - 00:39:23.275, Speaker A: Right? Even though museums have done it because they had to, you know, video, you name it. Let's continue. What's more important for many artists, in my view, is the gallery model. Now this I completely disagree with. Now let's see what it says. Long term commitment and representation. So the middle person needs to be brought back in here to settle things.
00:39:23.275 - 00:40:15.845, Speaker A: And maybe that's the case. To me though, with everybody kind of becoming their own social media, especially as an artist, do you really need some gallery getting in between you and your business? And I guess with the idea that they are going to promote you? Let's see what it says. These relationships go far beyond the temporary hype of Web3 marketplaces. Galleries work directly with artists to shape their careers. What kind of artist, to be perfectly, you know, blunt about it, wants their career to be shaped by some. By someone else. Why do you become an artist so you can have some gallery? This is, again, this is part of the problem where artists want to develop, and then their gallery in the physical world will say, well, actually, the reason we hired you or brought you on board is because you're making these great works over here, this series, and this series sells.
00:40:15.845 - 00:41:04.775, Speaker A: So what's this new stuff you're doing? Can you just bring us more of that old stuff? Because that stuff sells, right? So I don't think. I don't see this as necessarily a positive gallery. Shaping, like, provide infrastructure. Okay, fair enough. But again, in the digital world, is that necessary? Exhibitions, connections to collectors, and importantly offer stability, I guess, but do they? I mean, you're only as good as your work at the end of the day as far as being an artist. So there's only so much a gallery can do for you if your work starts to fall off, if your work starts to not be as good. It's not like the gallery can keep pushing it endlessly, like they're going to run out of collectors at a certain point.
00:41:04.775 - 00:41:45.841, Speaker A: For the majority, it's not like some paradise here, like some magical thing. For the majority of artists, this kind of sustained commitment is far more valuable than relying solely on platforms that come and go with the market's volatility. Now, I will say this to Pablo's point here. There is something to be said for a gallery that invests in you and kind of grows with you and then brings you distribution and sales and whatnot. So I don't want to completely rain on the parade here. But in a physical world, sure. But in the digital world, you know, you really like, I'm not saying it can't happen.
00:41:45.841 - 00:42:50.055, Speaker A: In fact, I'm kind of involved in something that I can't talk about, which may actually be, you know, kind of related to this whole thing, but this whole idea. But as far as, you know, like put it this way, let's say, you know, I don't think a gallery. If let's say a gallery shows work by an artist in the digital world, is that gallery now having to, you know, first of all, are they now going to be committed to selling that person's work in perpetuity in a digital world? Like does that make sense in a global market? I just don't. And should the artist only be able to release with the gallery? Like let's remember is how I would put this. Let's remember why galleries came about because there is nowhere else to buy art. I mean there's the museum and then where do you buy art in 1915 to look at our, to consider our Financial Times article. You go to the art gallery where someone has brought in some artists.
00:42:50.055 - 00:43:53.741, Speaker A: So the digital art model completely changes the assumptions underlying the whole thing. So to bring in again this kind of was it sticks and mortar, right? Bricks and mortar kind of mentality into a digital world to me makes zero sense because really it's a hard enough business, I would argue. And how if your work is liked, I would argue it can be recognized and do you really need someone taking 30 to 50% off the top of your art, you know, and maybe it's less and in some cases you could argue there is a case, but you know, for a certain percentage if they are bringing you attention and this sort of thing. So I don't want to completely dismiss it, I think there is a case. But to say like what we need is a whole bunch of galleries, perhaps, I mean, who knows? Let's continue the unsustainable reality. The reason the Web3 Marketplace model is crumbling is simple. It's built on short term gains and lacks the deeper long term strategy needed for survival.
00:43:53.741 - 00:44:24.253, Speaker A: Artists needs galleries or agents. I don't know if they need them and I don't know, I'm not sure they need them. Who are committed to representing them over the course of years, not just in the hype cycle of a bull market. Platforms should take note, there is a middle ground. Web3 offers incredible tools, but those tools need to be supported by structures that prioritize sustainability. Art has to do more with the relationship between artists, their work and those who engage with it. Blockchain should be a tool to enhance that, not not replace it.
00:44:24.253 - 00:45:00.551, Speaker A: And the marketplaces, you can't cater to everyone. I mean I've had you know, gallery, gallery come out to me like three years ago when I was making nice sales on Super Rare there and all of a sudden wanted to represent me, got on artsy and it was what did they, you know, did they really bring me that much like, I mean it's a hard business, you know, being a gallery. Anyways, let's continue and for the marketplaces, you can't cater to everyone. Focus on building a sustainable model that benefits both the companies and the artists they serve. Not just quick flipping, hype driven sales. It's a balance. The future lies in a balance.
00:45:00.551 - 00:45:41.917, Speaker A: A fusion of Web3 innovation and the long term support that more traditional systems provide. It's an interesting question. I think at the end of the day in a digital world it really is up to, and I'd even argue to a certain degree in the physical world it's not an easy business. I want to say galleries aren't a panacea, so to speak. Like you as a artist even in the traditional world, you're an entrepreneur, you're the boss, you're the CEO. And so my understanding of how it works is in every city there's a gallery and you can have different galleries in different cities. You can't have the two galleries in the same city unless you have a special contract.
00:45:41.917 - 00:46:00.807, Speaker A: Right. And it depends on your contract. But generally speaking, you can have a gallery in this city, you can have a gallery in that city ultimately. And are you going to rely on just the one gallery? Okay, if you're the top.01%, you can rely on Larry Gagosian to deliver you. Right. But at that point you don't really need probably Gagossian even.
00:46:00.807 - 00:46:36.725, Speaker A: It's just a matter of it's an honor and you take advantage. Anyway, let's continue here. Is crypto art Dead Amadon Patrick Amidon Crypto art was always a small niche within digital art. This is a really. I actually totally agree with this feels like a conflation is more the issue from the outside world conflating crypto art and digital art. Much of what they associate with crypto art isn't in fact crypto art will take several years to recover from association with profile picture projects or PFPs. More likely on temporary life support with a decent outlook.
00:46:36.725 - 00:47:01.069, Speaker A: It's a very interesting question. I really Relate to this. I have a different conclusion. I actually think crypto art is kind of going to be known, and I've actually mentioned this maybe 200 episodes ago, maybe more. I suspect it will be seen in the future as a thing in the 2020, 2021, and even previously. But really, which, you know, became a little thing in the digital art world. A thing.
00:47:01.069 - 00:47:27.579, Speaker A: Not even little, but a thing. Huge sales. And I suspect, I mean, the crypto world changes pretty radically pretty quickly. I. I'm not convinced that that whole aesthetic modality, the whole mindset, I'm not convinced that it's just going to keep on keeping on. I, again, I see it as kind of a 2020-2022, and we don't even see that much. And.
00:47:27.579 - 00:47:50.653, Speaker A: And when we do see new crypto art, are we seeing huge innovations in it? Like, I feel like we've already seen what the. You know, and maybe I'm wrong again. Just more opinions from your friend on a Friday with a coffee. With too much coffee. So I thought. An interesting take from Patrick Ammidon and also from Amadon. Artists don't need platforms, they need tools.
00:47:50.653 - 00:48:16.141, Speaker A: We need to break away from gatekeepers and centralized controls. Empower artists, not the middlemen. Exactly. And I think bringing galleries is the solution. I completely agree with this. Like, I think in a land of social media, in a land of digital art, where you get paid instantly, I mean, that's one of the great things that, you know, is kind of understated here about selling your art on the blockchain. I don't need to ask anybody to get the money.
00:48:16.141 - 00:48:36.279, Speaker A: You know, I don't need to ask the gallery, like, can you please pay me? Oh, you know, like. And all this sort of thing that regular artists have to deal with oftentimes not getting paid. It's just the reality, Right? You think you finally made it, you got a gallery. I made it. I made it. And then you don't get paid. Right, that happens.
00:48:36.279 - 00:49:03.195, Speaker A: It's not uncommon. Okay, so I also agree with this. I think it's just all about empowering artists. There's no need, in a sense, unless you want to have physical distribution, then someone's paying rent somewhere, and then you don't have that space, and then. Okay, then the gallery makes sense. Right, but that's for physical work. I'm not saying it's impossible digitally, but I think it takes on a new form is what I'm saying.
00:49:03.195 - 00:49:31.679, Speaker A: Oria, I'm having trouble figuring why I'd post a small thing on Rodeo instead of just minting it on object. Well, exactly. I mean, I look at waffles work and waffles is clearly, it's not about getting every last dollar I can get out of it. Right. But as I was mentioning, I think last show. Wow, Waffles would get. You know, weirdly, even seeing the same works on object or on Ethereum, I'd be like, oh, here's, you know, I hope $20 will be enough to get this work.
00:49:31.679 - 00:49:47.823, Speaker A: It probably won't. And then when it's free, it's sort of like, okay, I gotta do this, I gotta mint. And isn't this great? But you know, it's like. So it's just a. Weirdly, it's a different mentality. I don't know why. And, well, I shouldn't even be here, let alone on yet another social network.
00:49:47.823 - 00:50:08.273, Speaker A: And this is the thing, there's zero demand, I would argue for another social network. So again, kind of raising questions about what Zora and, you know, Rodeo is doing are doing. So interesting. So fair enough. Aria saying I need to go to cave on space. Someone was mentioning I should try and get cave on on a space. I don't.
00:50:08.273 - 00:50:28.457, Speaker A: I think that's actually a pretty good idea. I may reach out sometime soon because maybe it helps and just to learn and who knows? Let's go. Time. The artist formerly known as Santiago. This is pretty funny. 24 hours to see who will win the final battle of NFTs. Will it be artists? Will it be platforms? So two works here we're going to see this show.
00:50:28.457 - 00:50:54.989, Speaker A: One's on Rodeo, one's on Object. We will see. Now, in Rodeo's defense, look at this. And I don't know if this was minted on Rodeo. It's on OpenSea now, but I think art sales after my token launch. Thanks for collecting on secondary. So Pixel Lord, there's this Crypto NIA series, which I think was an AI series and it's doing really well.
00:50:54.989 - 00:51:07.945, Speaker A: Look at that. Half an eth. These are recent sales on secondary. You really got to applaud Pixel Lords. Basically, entrepreneurialism in the Web3 space. And here it is. Floor price of 0.14.
00:51:07.945 - 00:51:35.965, Speaker A: Token makes art go up, probably. So who knows what's going on here, but it's pretty interesting. Some kind of, you know, token mechanics, perhaps. Maybe, you know, maybe you get a token based on the art piece. If you have an art piece. Or depending on the art piece, who knows? Fungible. The one art community that has consistently not cared about supply, pricing or paying royalties is Tezos or the paying royalties debate.
00:51:35.965 - 00:51:58.825, Speaker A: When Tezos, social minting Mobile app object fx hash, TriLatech. Well, again, the social network is Object. There is no. So what is the point? I mean, this is what I've argued a long time. Object is a social network. It's got notifications. It's a very rudimentary social network, like a very rudimentary.
00:51:58.825 - 00:52:25.419, Speaker A: But ultimately you get notifications and you can follow. Right. And so it is a social minting app. I would argue it's just not being recognized as such by the market. And the market, or at least, you know, Rodeo and Zora, not to be overly critical, it's like, oh, let's copy Instagram's interface, and then we have social. I don't think Mark Zuckerberg would call those social networks. Which part? I guess there's likes.
00:52:25.419 - 00:53:06.567, Speaker A: Is there messaging? Right? I mean, Zuckerberg calls imessage his biggest competition is what I remember. That's a messaging app, you know, that's social, you know, so in a sense, you could argue that Object is already a bit more of a social network than Rodeo or Zora. I would argue. I mean, where do you feel more community in your life as a collector and artist? You know, like what? Like, at least I see familiar names. I go to the, you know, on Object, I go to the collections. I look, you know, so I'm just saying, you know, Max Osiris. Tezos is terrible.
00:53:06.567 - 00:53:33.115, Speaker A: Object is terrible. Went to an Art Basel party hosted by Tezos two years ago. No art displayed. They don't care about you. For some reason, artists still hang on to the platform because a lot of great ones, dope ones, started there, but it's a mega loss at this point. Yeah, so kind of strong feeling here. I mean, I guess the reason I bring this up is where do artists go if they want to sell their work? And it's not that artists.
00:53:33.115 - 00:54:07.583, Speaker A: Because you're wondering, why would they go to Tezos? This makes no sense. The token's going down. The reason why artists go to Tezos is because artists are business people, and where are they going to get the most consistent, reliable, you know, paycheck for their art? And right now, that's Tezos. Okay, That's Object, actually, to be more specific about it. And if Tezos is the currency. Tezos is the currency. And yeah, we sure wish it was going up, but let's not forget it can be a feature and not a bug.
00:54:07.583 - 00:54:40.353, Speaker A: The fact that the crypto is so cheap, why do we see many of the artists selling out across the board. I mean, is it because the token's so expensive or because the token's so cheap and collectors go, I can't believe I can get this, you know, myth work for six bucks. This is awesome. Right? And there the myth sells out in like two minutes, right? Or you know, Zozo. And here people are still making real money. Again, you look at like Nev 1914, you look at Zuozhou. If you're bringing in a hundred dollars US a day, that's a job.
00:54:40.353 - 00:55:18.675, Speaker A: It may not be a super high paying job these days, but that's, that's a job. Okay, so it's probably better than McDonald's, which isn't bad for making your art. So let's continue. I love the ethos of Tezos. Art and Object is a great platform, but seems terrible that a bunch of artists who are already selling for nothing congregate on a chain where the native token is basically down only. And again, as we saw with Zora, if artists feel they can make money elsewhere, they will also mint there. And they understand, I would argue most of them understand that you're going to get a different set of collectors.
00:55:18.675 - 00:55:51.765, Speaker A: So if they go on Zora, so it's just all the better for them. If they had the old Zora platform, they would still be using it as long as the sales keep coming in. So artists are business people and they just go where the money is. And it's that simple. So as far as people trying to understand why they use Tezos, it's because Tezos or Object more specifically, has a great, the best collector base in terms of bringing in money as an artist. And that could all be debated. Is ether better? Well, more money.
00:55:51.765 - 00:56:32.265, Speaker A: If, if artists thought they could make more money by minting on Eth, wherever you do it now, I guess manifold. Like, I mean, where do you even go if you're not on super rare? Where do you mint? Is it highlight xyz? Like, you know, I'm, I don't even know where you go, interestingly. So the reason again is they go where the money is. They're like devs follow the money, you know, is what they do. And that's okay. It's business, right? So if people are trying to figure it out, this is why it's about money and actually selling your work. Oh heck, I'm sick of OGs attacking the longevity of Tezos.
00:56:32.265 - 00:57:14.339, Speaker A: It is a common thing, you see. And so it is an interesting thing. I don't know enough about the tech around Tezos, so My kind of strategy personally is I've always been multi chain and I like Tezos a lot because it's fantastic. I will sell my work out often within an hour or within a day and there I have 100 bucks in my pocket for my edition of like 10 or 15. A hundred US dollars, go out, take my friends out for supper is what I did last week. You know, that was awesome, right? I mean, so. And then for longevity I'll go to bitcoin too.
00:57:14.339 - 00:57:50.793, Speaker A: And then also. Yeah, so it is an interesting. I do agree that it's. I don't know enough about the tech, but again, I think the reason the artists are there is not because the Tezos foundation has been so great. It's because they get paid and it's that simple. And so. But I do sometimes wonder about it and I wonder if there is tribalism to Ahek's point, Joshua's point, you know, I suspect it is tribalism in some respects at certain points, you know, so let's continue.
00:57:50.793 - 00:58:36.269, Speaker A: Violet Bond at this point I think that all Tez has to do is stay the course and it'll end up being the art chain for the world. There's a lot to be said for this there. You know, as I have been saying here every day that goes by where object doesn't screw up, credibility grows. And you know, foundation had a nice three or four year run, they could still turn it around in theory, Zora could still turn around. But the longer you go of, and you know, it's debatable, they might not think it's a screw up at all. But from an art perspective, I'm not finding as many tabs as I used to, let's put it that way. For the show of work that I'm going, oh, I have to put this on and I don't cover everything, I don't see everything.
00:58:36.269 - 00:59:01.967, Speaker A: So who knows? But all to say, I think it's an interesting point. So interesting comment there. Jedi Wolf. Never in human history have artists had such global and direct access to millions of potential collectors. Never before could they sell their works within seconds to someone across continents. The shift is still unfolding, but one thing is certain, there is no going back. And Jedi Wolf hitting the nail on the head.
00:59:01.967 - 00:59:46.823, Speaker A: Direct access. Do you want your gallery? You know, if a gallery can bring other collectors, then value is being brought and then you have a reason for a partnership in the digital world. Right? But it's a different sort of situation than the current, you know, artist bagger, which is really what it is. In the contemporary art scene, who is a nobody until they're picked up by a gallery. And then all of a sudden it's like, okay, now I have some sort of business going on, right? So, you know, that's not the case in digital. You can build your own following, as many people do. So all to say, this kinda is the point, right? And let's hope there's no going back.
00:59:46.823 - 01:00:16.673, Speaker A: I agree. I hope, I hope and agree Evo, with this whole foundation debacle. Debacle could inspire me to write a paper on why it's essential to mint on your own contracts, which I'll be doing moving forward alongside minting on the super rare general contract. That said, Tezos will emerge stronger for this. I'm bullish on art and on us. Yeah, Tezos is going to be the winner out of this again by not screwing up super rare as well. Like, what's left? I mean, where do you mean your art? It's kind of interesting.
01:00:16.673 - 01:00:50.515, Speaker A: I mean, it felt like there was too many places, but now, I mean, as far as. And then especially if you want to not have these issues with like, at least you get the sense superware is going to pay the IPFS fees. Like, what about foundation? That hasn't even come up, right? So I'm bullish on art and us indeed. So it doesn't, you know, disturb me at all in a sense that if, if these things disappear because we can always mint. Ultimately you can always mint on. On chain. In theory.
01:00:50.515 - 01:01:13.035, Speaker A: You know, as long as we have on chain, you don't rely on anybody. Right? Maybe with ordinals they could get rid of that at some point, but then maybe do bitcoin stamps, which I'm not against and actually I'm kind of curious about. Maybe you need to have Santiago Izzy Codal to discuss that. Anyway, let's continue. Me Pixel. My plan is to have art that persists. Hence why I mint on chain.
01:01:13.035 - 01:01:43.073, Speaker A: And people go, oh, on chain. What's this fad? The latest trend. Another thing you guys want me to hop onto this is I completely agree with this. I hope someone sees my pixels in 100 years. This is the. Because what do you see with foundation? So who's to say IPFS doesn't pull a foundation at some point and just goes, you know what? This business isn't working. All the NFT platforms are dying and all of a sudden we're not getting paid.
01:01:43.073 - 01:02:16.437, Speaker A: So therefore, you know, even Art Gnome has brought this up. Back up your collection. There's going to be a crisis at Some point in the next five years back up your collection as he says I need to do that. So this is the attraction to me. All of this drama with foundation is more reason to be mint on chain and to just find that interesting. Dr. Le Nft and just finally so a couple So I think Wise Ape Sigma Toad is.
01:02:16.437 - 01:02:36.075, Speaker A: I'm sure I follow Wise Ape end object. Let me just. I'm sure I've Let me make sure because yes, I am Okay. I had to make sure. Okay. Would it be possible to add a filter for primary primary sales only on the object Filters would be great to filter tokens by those on primary or secondary. I guess.
01:02:36.075 - 01:03:05.395, Speaker A: Yeah. Notifications need to be filtered. I was told like months ago that they're going to do something about this. Like I want new NFTs because right now I'm going through. I see like 50 listings of people that are listing their work at new prices and then missing all the new NFTs and then the. And it's not working great for me still as I scroll through it reloads and reloads. It's still glitchy for me, the actual notification feature.
01:03:05.395 - 01:03:29.617, Speaker A: So notifications need to be fixed, I would argue. And they need filters where I can just go new NFTs get the. You know, rather than every last little thing that someone's doing with their NFT. So Dr. Lee on the right track there, shout out to Sigma Toad Skull takes who do you all hate providing links to your. Why do you all hate providing links to your art? Well, it's about reach, but I'm completely in agreement with you. Like, yeah, I don't.
01:03:29.617 - 01:03:41.921, Speaker A: I just don't want to. I want to give you money for something I can already see for free. Don't make it hard. The mental leap is already hard enough that you want it. Exactly. You've won the collector over. And then you don't put a link and then you go, oh, but I wanted more reach.
01:03:41.921 - 01:04:21.225, Speaker A: Well, yeah, now you're make. Now you're annoying the collector that wants to give you money for the art. So yeah, maybe, you know, maybe the thing to do is you first you put it with the link and then maybe, you know, some people recycle their art in their social media feeds. So then maybe three months later or two months later you put the artwork out again or weeks later and then just as a way of just getting your art known by more people and then there's no link. It already sold. Who cares? All right, Oxy, I beg you people, read a single one Critical art history or media cultural studies book before tweeting. Now I have a completely different view on this.
01:04:21.225 - 01:05:03.975, Speaker A: Yeah, it might depend which book. Media or cultural studies. This is what I suggest. Like, I appreciate the impulse here, but I think the best thing you can do to actually speak about art is to go to study art in a sense, and not what people say about art, but just immerse yourself in art. Go to the Vatican multiple times, go to the Louvre multiple times, make a thing of it. Every time you go to a new city, go to those museums, you know, get, you know, that is how you educate yourself in art is to be immerse yourself in it. And at first it's going to be boring, like anything.
01:05:03.975 - 01:05:53.791, Speaker A: And then the more you gravitate, the more you kind of observe, the more you understand, the more interesting it gets. And so that would be my recommendation. Critical. There's a. And I understand the impulse here that Oxay is mentioning, but the problem is, if you're a newbie, what often happens to the noob is you're the noob and then you read a critical theory text on art and then you start thinking, oh, if I just repeat all of these abstractions that I hardly know what they mean, then I'm going to sound smart. And it's kind of part of the problem, I would argue in contemporary art is there's too many people who are relying on reading critical theory or cultural studies over understanding and just spending time with the art and with the history. This is what I would say.
01:05:53.791 - 01:06:21.157, Speaker A: Rather than the criticism, go to the history and form your own understanding and criticism and then you can read the criticism and go, okay, does this make any sense to me? Anyway, interesting comment. Thank you for the comment, Oxeye. We're glad to feature it here. Jake Studios, 3 o'clock hobby. So as we go into works in progress, look at how Jake Studios works with object 98. And I have to say, I totally love the subject here. Look at that.
01:06:21.157 - 01:06:38.885, Speaker A: Has that been minted? That's rad. So very nice work. And you see how each one, with each one, it's like Jake's getting better, evolving, shall we say? This is hilarious. Bad news for P. Diddy. I woke up. So here's machine.
01:06:38.885 - 01:06:57.361, Speaker A: I just, you know, I just want to say just a star here, a machine, like a natural born star here. There is P. Diddy. So yeah, just a natural. Evelyn. Yo, gm. Next week I will release seven.
01:06:57.361 - 01:07:22.725, Speaker A: Let me make sure that that is quiet. Evelyn Yeo. Next week I'll release seven new abstract paintings on Superrare. It will be a fixed price and with the jpeg the collector will also receive a physical archival pigment print on Canson edition etching rag 310 gram paper with an oak wood frame and museum glass. Very nice. Sometimes it's nice to just have a physical hanging on your wall. The physical comes with a Transient Lace Labs traces chip for authenticity.
01:07:22.725 - 01:07:53.609, Speaker A: My only thing is with the crypto ecosystem being so like nothing lasting forever again, two years is a long time in crypto as everybody knows who's in the in it. Is this going to work? These trace chips in two or three years? Like that's my question. What's the backup? And maybe there is. I've never tried it. I don't. But when I see this being used a lot and I think it's great. But you know what happens if Transient Labs goes out of business? Does that continue to work? That's my question.
01:07:53.609 - 01:08:11.409, Speaker A: Have a great Thursday indeed and happy weekend to all. Pamela Cirone T shirt, hand drawn paint for my friend's birthday. So pretty rad looking pretty cool. And there we see rad in the T shirt there. Skateboard. Beautiful piece. And here's Kitskalowski.
01:08:11.409 - 01:08:30.195, Speaker A: I'm getting there. I plan to open my little online store somewhere in November. I'm going to drop stickers first and I'll be gradually adding all other objects to the assortment when ready. So that's pretty cool. Working on stickers here, Kalowski. And into the works we go an hour and eight minutes. This.
01:08:30.195 - 01:09:07.135, Speaker A: Yeah, this is probably going to be, I'm hoping the last show that is this kind of extended and whatnot. I'm aiming for below an hour. I will force it. So I've said many times here, but it's. I can't spend like six hours a day doing this show. Here is the great Martin Bruce with another delightful image for us to feast on here with beautiful colors and mystery. Some static pixels kind of pixelated here and some dynamic and kind of shimmering in that kind of almost TV snow kind of way.
01:09:07.135 - 01:09:35.788, Speaker A: All unpredictable. Digital version of Teatrino painting from the exhibition. I love how Martin Bruce takes his physicals and makes them digitals and redoes them in a way that is persuasive. I would argue as a collector that goes, yeah, that works. This physical turned digital and that's its own piece. Like he transforms it enough where it really becomes its own thing and it's not just a photo of a painting. So beautiful work here.
01:09:35.788 - 01:09:55.753, Speaker A: I think this might have been burned, but there's probably another one out there that has been minted. Look at this gorgeous work by Gozo. La Corriente. Stunning sunrise, sunset here. Look at that sun. Look at that, the edge of the sun even. Look at the textures.
01:09:55.753 - 01:10:16.037, Speaker A: And the water is just kind of flowing along there. Beautiful landscape. And it is already 100 tezos and selling at 65. Taking offers at 30 if you're lucky. You put in an offer at 30 and got accepted. Edition of 20. Beautiful work by Gozo.
01:10:16.037 - 01:10:37.665, Speaker A: Another stunner with Lullaby. Now take your leave. So listed on foundation, kind of hilariously here is Yuri J. With a beautiful work of kind of a bedroom scene here. See if we can make this slightly bigger at the risk of crashing the browser. And there's foundation on the wall. I can't help but read that as a kind of comment here.
01:10:37.665 - 01:11:11.445, Speaker A: So again, filters on filters, my friends bringing about beautiful textures. Look at that wonderful hat, this pioneer here. And of course it would not be complete without the mosaic filter from Yuri J. And light here as also subject matter. Gorgeous, gorgeous work from Uri J. Here's a nice one by Pippi Universal Mujeres Desperando. Not exactly sure what that means, but very interesting piece here as we see.
01:11:11.445 - 01:11:42.645, Speaker A: Almost like an old machine gun here, the outlines being used, but then filled with insects. Interestingly referring, you know, at least for me, you know, kind of called death or a reference to death, maybe a soldier here with this, with the army helmet, this interesting red. It almost looks like a flag. And here we seem to have some camouflage. What looks like a big helmet, but kind of squished and then interesting aspect. Nice negative space in this piece. Very cool piece by P.P.
01:11:42.645 - 01:12:07.947, Speaker A: universal, Nev 1914. A little boy riding a donkey. And as you see here, so this is after Nico Pirosmani, Eco Por Me. And actually NUV should be. If everything goes according to plan, NUV should be on the spaces next Wednesday. So another work here, kind of a lower res work. Interestingly from NUV 1914.
01:12:07.947 - 01:12:26.389, Speaker A: Nice piece. Interesting, always unpredictable. And these wonderful lines that go across even right there. Very, very interesting piece that is by NUV 1914 and three gone so far. Edition of 13 RJ with a couple of stunners. Morning Sun. Look at this.
01:12:26.389 - 01:12:49.119, Speaker A: This looks like bigger. And so using a few different techniques here. AI and also some stable diffusion, I suspect. Right. And also some pixelation, kind of different kind of outputs, I suspect. Nice fills some magic wand here, I suspect. Nice work.
01:12:49.119 - 01:13:16.799, Speaker A: And then of course the gif, maybe a four frame GIF here. Interesting kind of. And here, you know, so playing with the different kinds of outputs you can get here. And even, okay, you see here, it's like the red is just kind of pink, but then in certain areas, then you maybe just change it down to, okay, we'll make it less colors on our GIF export or whatever the case might be. And then you get the full red. Very interesting work from RJ. This is a beautiful one, too.
01:13:16.799 - 01:13:49.225, Speaker A: Morning Sun, 1, 300 Tezos, I think still available. So a lot going on in these very interesting, beautifully textured works by rj AI and pixel painting. Here is Cedar Planck. So look at all this wonderful art in the last 48 hours. Here is Cedar Plank with another amazing Fantavision work playing again with the. With a FanTavision UI, I believe. And you gotta love this too, with the countdown, but count up and then this person.
01:13:49.225 - 01:14:09.685, Speaker A: So just kind of having fun. And also offers coming in at 90 tezos, 100 tezos. Incredible. Here's Sabato Floricultura. This is a Chrome period drawing. This was just listed edition of 33. And a very cool piece here using deluxe paint and part of the Chrome period.
01:14:09.685 - 01:14:29.201, Speaker A: So therefore kind of a desaturated version, we might say. And kind of looking, if I had to guess, like a plant store. And that looks like almost like a Venus fly trap here, if I had to guess. And pretty fun. And so kind of a storefront. Interesting piece. Donna Flor and her impeccable little shop.
01:14:29.201 - 01:14:41.947, Speaker A: S H O P P E. So that was edition of 33 and they are moving. Look at that. Already 12 gone. Nice work. 22 tezos each. Another stunner, this time from Cap.
01:14:41.947 - 01:14:57.215, Speaker A: And this on foundation. Just listed on foundation. Look at this. So remember how Kappen was listing works on foundation. The jams. Well, here's JAMS one to nine. And as you'll see here, I brought it up large.
01:14:57.215 - 01:15:18.855, Speaker A: Let me hit loop. And you're going to see the first nine as one piece, but this time on foundation. Pretty hilarious, I think. Quite a brilliant use of a brilliant use reusing. A brilliant reusing of orcs. Look at how stunning that looks when you go full screen here. Stunning.
01:15:18.855 - 01:15:53.705, Speaker A: And so super interesting work by Kappen, as usual. And that is for 0.123. And again, just listed on foundation. Interestingly, the myth myth mentality. So another just poignant portrait by the myth and looking like maybe this is some sort of wrestling mask, but I'm not sure. The myth 2069amyth mentality. And again, I believe this sold out right away at nine tazos within an hour, two hours max.
01:15:53.705 - 01:16:12.345, Speaker A: So nice work from Myth. Beautiful piece. Here's another one, El Nazarino edition of 15. And this sold at nine tezos within probably a couple hours max. So doing Myth Jesus here. Pretty fun. And even a little bit of a halo there.
01:16:12.345 - 01:16:43.781, Speaker A: An unusual halo. This is brilliant by Dan Control. I love the wit and I also love the color. Very witty work of an electronic cigarette. Again, reusing elements from previous works. Doing this kind of unusual canvas size here, kind of landscape, and then just having fun, graphical fun as these two kind of trails of electronic cigarettes meet each other right here. Very witty work here by Dan Control.
01:16:43.781 - 01:17:01.639, Speaker A: Here's Michi Asu, Wandering life, I thought a very edgy work here, as you see. Not even sure what's going on. Maybe someone's sleeping, maybe a plant. Beautiful colors in here. Very interesting piece. Edition of 1 for 17. Tazos on primary.
01:17:01.639 - 01:17:29.985, Speaker A: Here's Jan Lucas Migone. Feel the flames. Shadows of the Soul collection. So playing with these figures again and I think, let's see. I suspect this is digital indeed. And here you see a figure on fire as everyone kind of is kind of, I think, moving away or hard to see, hard to tell. But the bodies are either moving towards or away in a kind of dance, let's call it, around this figure in flames.
01:17:29.985 - 01:17:38.609, Speaker A: Powerful work. Feel the flames. Edition of 40. And this is for 420. And there are 10 left. Nice work there. Here's Mary Migraine.
01:17:38.609 - 01:18:04.199, Speaker A: I haven't seen Mary Migraine for a while. Just wanted to let you know I'm back and I still don't know what I'm doing after all these years. This is great. We see Gio Mariani, we see Mary Migraine and you're going to see like feels, I mean, who never really disappeared, but nevertheless pixel fool. Pretty exciting. So cool work here by Mary Migraine. Edition of 20.
01:18:04.199 - 01:18:21.305, Speaker A: Nice portrait here. And this is. We have transferred to a lot of probably previous collectors, maybe friends, and three sold and now all gone. So great to see Mary Migraine. Back. Here's Cesar jp. Cesar, I thought this was great.
01:18:21.305 - 01:18:59.575, Speaker A: Kind of almost like a 1930s feeling work here. Almost like gangsters or something from the 1930s or something. Beautifully colored, like. Pretty fun work here by Cesar that's on Instagram. Here is Wasteman Gold Minovich, the failed artist. Self portrait is Hamburger, of course, Trump at McDonald's just the other day. And so here we have the failed artist who has been quite critical and where Trump is putting the fries on top of the failed artist here who has also worked at McDonald's in the past.
01:18:59.575 - 01:19:29.437, Speaker A: And so a pretty fun drawing here. And almost like the word balloon. Is that a word balloon? Is that background? I'm not sure. And then of course, the title probably referring to JFK coming to Berlin and saying Ich biene Berliner. And the joke for that has always been for Germans that a Berliner is a kind of doughnut. Right? So when JFK says Ischpie9 Berliner, he's basically saying he's a donut. So Ischpedein Hamburger.
01:19:29.437 - 01:19:50.745, Speaker A: Now, it's quite brilliant because a hamburger is actually a citizen in Germany. So isn't that interesting? So interesting. All sorts of things going on over there. This was too Rosatio. So an interactive artwork. As you see, I drag my. As I drag my cursor along the screen here.
01:19:50.745 - 01:20:11.425, Speaker A: Another tribute to Rene Magritte on the Treachery of Images. And what does it say inside? Ceci ne pasin Odin Apple. So this is not an Apple computer, referring to the Treachery of Images, the great title. And of course I follow Ed Murillo. We Are not in Control. The great title of the Cecine Pasiman Peep work. The Treachery of Images.
01:20:11.425 - 01:20:27.733, Speaker A: I love it. Here is Ed Merola with a work. He was working physically. This looks digital, though, and kind of an interesting piece with all this crowd. Again, kind of almost. Ed studied anthropology, if I remember correctly. Kind of looked anthropological.
01:20:27.733 - 01:21:04.127, Speaker A: Here's Quilanina with AI and digital painting working together here. So another beautiful work again out of Peru and Argentina. And just a very cool, colorful digital painting by Quila Nina, who again, always kind of makes these. Again, kind of feels slightly in a visionary art sort of context, but hard to say. Look at these great lightning bolts from whatever these this is here. Is that a sun red sun trained with. Look at this digital painting made with AI model, trained with 30 Quilina paintings.
01:21:04.127 - 01:21:22.197, Speaker A: Brilliant. Here is Linodevas. And this came out a couple of months ago. People getting on the subway. I love the subject matter and the composition. This was picked up by canik zapata for 8 tezos just the other day. So another interesting artist to discover.
01:21:22.197 - 01:21:43.757, Speaker A: Rural Idol Oldfather Mean Time. So really nice textures. Of course, Rural Idol often doing kind of hills or little mountains here. These megaliths. Edition of Seven and Foregone. And also Kel 1 Art Public Cartoons Volume 3. So Kel 1 I haven't seen for a long time.
01:21:43.757 - 01:22:07.885, Speaker A: It's interesting. I wonder. It's interesting to see what. And maybe Kelwyn was minting the whole time. But Someone at the office and there's a wastebasket and all of the different categories for putting in your submission or your suggestion, I should say. And this one sold for one Tezos. Here is Kutu Kola Waterpark.
01:22:07.885 - 01:22:26.475, Speaker A: Kind of a fun work here by Kudu Cola. A lot of heads here. Cool composition. An interesting. Like this is probably like the water slide to a certain degree, and then you see the water and it's almost like an impression of the memory of the water park. A nice piece. Ahek picking that up for five Tezos.
01:22:26.475 - 01:23:11.715, Speaker A: And continuing on, here's Dylan, who I haven't seen for a while, but may have been around a sea. So this is an edition of one, and I believe this is a digital drawing, but almost looking like combining different styles here, which creates a beautiful contrast. As we continue. Louis Osborne, Check this out. I'm not sure if this is new or not. It's all coordinated. I mean, pretty amazing.
01:23:11.715 - 01:23:37.599, Speaker A: Okay, perfect. You know, more than once I've hit stop on the video after a video, which is funny. Here is Katrina Create. This is on foundation, interestingly, so we're seeing a few foundation mints in the last couple of days. So here's Katarina Create. Look at how great this looks and nice colors here and everything. So another cool drawing from Katarina create.
01:23:37.599 - 01:23:50.767, Speaker A: Price 0.04. And this was minted October 16th. This is part of. Yeah, an exhibition which I think just launched up like a week ago. Floriculture. Put it on. Here's Blue Retina.
01:23:50.767 - 01:24:15.061, Speaker A: This was just posted on the timeline there. So interesting. Often using blue and kind of a very. Kind of almost photographic, but then having this kind of snow, like GIF dynamism, shall we say. And then here it's more illustrative. So interesting combination from Blue Retina. Here's an egg mattress with a very interesting crocodile here.
01:24:15.061 - 01:24:31.745, Speaker A: So as you see, it's almost too small. The ASCII to see. Here we go. Right. So it looks like almost all visual ASCII on this one. Very interesting way of tackling this issue. And even I love these.
01:24:31.745 - 01:25:06.341, Speaker A: So super interesting work here from Enigmatras. We have a couple more. Here is a map of the world with almost a bit of a Time magazine feel to it. And of course, you see both text and visual, what I call visual ASCII here. This is pretty interesting, too. So a few what looked like maybe sign language, A, E, I, O, U, and taking these old diagrams and then putting ASCII on top and even the fact that they're kind of fuzzed. Out a little bit, kind of contrasting nicely, I would argue with the ASCII text.
01:25:06.341 - 01:25:18.109, Speaker A: But then the blue is put on top. You see that? Like it covers the ascii. So that's interesting too. A, I, O, U, B, C, D. Here's more. I thought this was gorgeous. These different colored.
01:25:18.109 - 01:25:37.493, Speaker A: Maybe foxes chasing the moose or something like that. And very. Another interesting look at the sky with the ASCII text. And then the black and white for the stones, maybe in the front contrasting beautifully with the grass. Very cool work there from Egg Mattress. Here's Mumble Boy. This was picked up.
01:25:37.493 - 01:25:57.891, Speaker A: What have I internalized edition of one beautiful piece from Mumble Boy here. A nice. I love the composition. Just kind of nice, for lack of better term. The color, the balance, the beautiful gradient in the background. It all just kind of clicked on this one that sold for 15 tezos. Here is time, also known as Santiago, the Final Battle nft.
01:25:57.891 - 01:26:15.773, Speaker A: So here is one of the pieces. Let's see if it loads. And here we go. So it kind of looks like an AI abstract, but probably using. There's a rodeo post related to this one and I believe I brought it up. So let's see how it's doing here. Not doing bad at all.
01:26:15.773 - 01:26:29.365, Speaker A: 50 cents. So we have the battle of NFTs. And then here we have 22 minted. And so it's the final. Yeah, it's the final countdown. And here, let's see if we can load this up. This could be a.
01:26:29.365 - 01:26:39.645, Speaker A: So I'm going to speed through here. And of course, another abstract here by Santiago. So we'll see how that turns out. Beautiful piece. Here's another abstract by Santiago. There's no time. I love you.
01:26:39.645 - 01:27:03.065, Speaker A: And I can definitely again relate to that piece. So another AI artwork, I think. Or yeah, AI art edition of 15 and 5 gone. Nice work. And as we continue, Mikael Knowlson, a couple of interesting abstracts. Starting to add these paint splotches on top or the paint drops, which is an interesting move. We see it here too, by Mikael Knowlson.
01:27:03.065 - 01:27:34.615, Speaker A: An interesting addition to the very digital shapes that we saw before. Pretty cool looking. Continuing on, here's cider with a wild kind of work, Modified Lullaby. And so who knows, it almost looks like something figurative in the middle there. And here we see a little bit it's made for Click Create. And here you see all the details, all of the texture that goes into a cider work. Looks fabulous.
01:27:34.615 - 01:27:54.243, Speaker A: So cool work there. Nice documentation, by the way. And continuing on, here's Louie. Remember when we were young and I almost hear Joy Division. I hear Ian Curtis there. And there's a little Pepe, I think. And so another interesting abstract here, this time from Louie.
01:27:54.243 - 01:28:09.353, Speaker A: Interesting texture there. Cool kind of negative space as well. Edition of 10 for 223. Gone time picking one up. And also Greg Nichumika. Der Himmel uber Berlin. The sky over Berlin.
01:28:09.353 - 01:28:31.265, Speaker A: And so let's see what the sky over Berlin looks like. Look at how cool that looks. So really nice textures in here. Great colors. And then this famous unicorn, I think collaged in interestingly amid all the pixelated noise. Interesting piece. This is an edition of 20 for 3 Tezos by Greg Nikshumika.
01:28:31.265 - 01:28:51.133, Speaker A: This was posted by Blank, who I'm pretty sure I follow there. I think artist unknown. I thought this is pretty good though. Kind of simple the concept, but kind of weirdly effective on that piece. I think unknown source, as it says here. This is. This is Stippen Pixel.
01:28:51.133 - 01:29:05.399, Speaker A: This is on Zora, I think Mas. Maybe it's Masque. I thought it was Stiffen Pixel. I kind of looks like. So I'm not sure who this is. I think Masque is the account on Zora. Kind of looks more like vector.
01:29:05.399 - 01:29:24.409, Speaker A: And interestingly interesting move between the vector and kind of fuzzing it out because. Yeah, because stipend. Pixel is more. What's the word? Pixelated pixel art. So maybe this is someone different. And so interesting. Byte by bit.
01:29:24.409 - 01:29:38.745, Speaker A: Here is something. A work called 19. Just a cool landscape here. I'm using Graphics 2, so always nice documentation from Byte by Bit. Nice piece. Can we make it larger? There we go. Interesting GIF landscape.
01:29:38.745 - 01:29:52.053, Speaker A: Here's another one. Love. So making a heart also by byte by bit. So cool work there. Kind of a simple piece. Edition of one for 15 Tezos. And here's Gio Mariani.
01:29:52.053 - 01:30:11.145, Speaker A: We got a few works. This one was pretty cool. Looks like looking like the Virgin here, the Virgin Mary and then some colors moving around her. And a new work by Gio Mariani. So that is super cool. Minted on tezos, I believe. 25 Tezos edition of 20 and 3 gone so far.
01:30:11.145 - 01:30:31.571, Speaker A: And here is another one, Profundo. The still ones are 15 tezos. And so again, kind of a religious iconography and almost a reference to old, you know, kind of Christian themed paintings. A cat and maybe a plant. So interesting juxtapositions there. Almost a colored photo. Photoshop canvas.
01:30:31.571 - 01:30:53.411, Speaker A: And here's another one, this one moving 25 tazos pentura. So interesting addition of five piece series here. These are all related. This kind of Fuchsia series. Fuchsia Dreamscapes, it's called and Pisa Gym. And this is an edition of 20 for 15 Tezos, probably because it's not moving. So a ton of work being put in here.
01:30:53.411 - 01:31:13.163, Speaker A: Again, just kind of exciting. This was the artist, I believe, Ed Morola said inspired. A few artists have mentioned Gio Mariani over the spaces over the last couple of years. So it's great to see Gio Mariani back. And there you see a cool color change with some masking there. So another piece by Gio Mariani. Very interesting pixel artist.
01:31:13.163 - 01:31:34.939, Speaker A: 300 by 300 pixels. Awesome. Here's Mirror kit as we sprint after the one and a half hour mark. And there's probably another 30 works here, so I'm going to go pretty fast. Look at this gorgeousness by Murakit. Again, I think filters on filters. And the reason I say that is we have a lot of tiny little pixelation within the larger pixelation and that's often what happens.
01:31:34.939 - 01:31:51.435, Speaker A: So a cool church Gothic church edition of three ten tazos. A horse ride. And let me make sure these are so a horse ride here. So cool. Again, nice GIF work here. Almost looking like a video game. And here a dragon.
01:31:51.435 - 01:32:04.465, Speaker A: Part of a short here. And there you have it. So great work here from Meerkat. Love seeing their work back. 8 bit short film composed of 24 gifs. So maybe more to come. This was cool.
01:32:04.465 - 01:32:22.285, Speaker A: 409. Kind of an interesting piece here. Not exactly sure what's going on, but I thought kind of a cool rendering. Very interesting. This was two generosis. And here, as you see, kind of interesting pixelation, but it looks like a photo of a screen. Almost looks like ASCII here.
01:32:22.285 - 01:32:42.383, Speaker A: Visual ascii. Interesting and mysterious. Here is Spiegels. And there's a live auction right now for 003 ETH. And so more works here from the Spiegel's PFP project. Really rad series. Great color on this one.
01:32:42.383 - 01:32:53.055, Speaker A: Here's another one. A banana. Hilarious. You got to love the humor here. Old TV set. And that is sold for 15. So the banana was popular.
01:32:53.055 - 01:33:07.973, Speaker A: I think there's a bidding ward. And. And here is what looks like the devil. This went for 11. And as you see here, the devil comes out of the computer. So these are special. If you know anything about PFPs, there's often like the special parts of the PFP project.
01:33:07.973 - 01:33:36.061, Speaker A: So pretty rad. It's kind of. Once PFPs kind of die a little bit, then the artists come in and want to start Making their series. Here's plus was Gamma with some more just interesting. It almost looks like Fantavision just based on the way that the animation is going, doesn't it? Hard to say. Here we got some on chain work by Tornado Rodriguez edition of one. So these are on chain, interestingly.
01:33:36.061 - 01:33:49.125, Speaker A: And so again, music for space as we're commenting on. Over an hour and a half. Well, about an hour and 15 minutes ago. Eyesore. So super cool. How big is this? Four kilobytes. Nice work.
01:33:49.125 - 01:34:10.405, Speaker A: 281 by 280 PNG stored on chain. And that's the thing. If you do PNG8 export is PNG8, which is probably what's going on here. It'll get a lot smaller than a PNG24 done using Microsoft Paint 98. A little tip for those who are still watching. A little reward for those who are still watching. And I'm just all over this on chain thing.
01:34:10.405 - 01:34:36.965, Speaker A: The more I don't want to rely on anybody as far as my art or oh no, the thing went down and I wasn't paying attention because I had other things that I was doing five years later. And then the, you know, and then IPFs and sorry, all your artwork's gone. Right. So have a plan is what I say. And I saying that to myself as much as to anybody out there. Drawing is my only constraint. So these jars really love the constraints here.
01:34:36.965 - 01:34:49.081, Speaker A: Four and a half kilobytes. This one's 4.2 kilobytes. I wonder how much these are to mint. Maybe I'll ask Tornado. She's going to translate if everything goes according to plan with NUV 1914. And this is a great one.
01:34:49.081 - 01:35:01.841, Speaker A: Sweet smelling. This is five kilobytes. So great work here. Again, the delight in these tiny works. Here's another one. Prey. So too much fun on these tiny canvases.
01:35:01.841 - 01:35:23.259, Speaker A: Interestingly, 280 by 280. You can actually draw pretty well in a sense. Right? Like it's not overly pixelated here. And that's, you know, that's how the pixel art inferno was for me. I picked 256 and then I added the border after which made it 260. It's not a bad size. For those that are wondering, here's Mitro Mitrai.
01:35:23.259 - 01:35:46.869, Speaker A: Macro mitrai lou lloo worker on chain. 320 by 240. So more on chain art. It's getting exciting. Art for space, as I like to say. Speaking of space, first contact pixel art. So Anis Abdon with a cool almost looking like a sci Fi work with this pool on another planet.
01:35:46.869 - 01:35:58.309, Speaker A: And what looks like an astronaut meeting another astronaut. Great piece. First contact. Love it. Seven colors. Here's Emmy Naturalis, number 12. So also looking like an ancient city.
01:35:58.309 - 01:36:15.541, Speaker A: This also looks like ancient Rome. From another perspective, there is maybe St. Peter's so maybe it's not ancient Rome, just a part of ancient Rome. But this, of course St. Peter's built in the 15th, 1500s, I believe. Michelangelo. There was a few people involved in that.
01:36:15.541 - 01:36:39.755, Speaker A: Minting soon and I believe that'll be on. I feel like I saw something like foundation or ethereum if I'm not mistaken. Pinky blue. Can I borrow a feeling? So more cool pixel art here. And I better finish this show quickly before my computer collapses on itself with my hour and 36 minute show here. No more hour and 30 minute shows is the rule I'm making to myself. It's like getting late in the day here.
01:36:39.755 - 01:37:00.255, Speaker A: Cream sapphire pattern cycling number eight. So more cool. I'd call that an animated abstract pixel artwork. Black and white, kind of small size or. Sorry, small pixel size. Color bars number nine. Here is Kristen Roos with a new piece October 23rd.
01:37:00.255 - 01:37:20.741, Speaker A: So a beautiful piece here. Animated abstract investigations in the colors into the color spectrum there. Chroma dots. This is by feels. So new work by feels. Look at this piece. A stunner, an absolute stunner here by feels.
01:37:20.741 - 01:37:39.005, Speaker A: Pretty rad artwork. That is 77 tezos each and sold out. Edition of 11. Here's Pixel fool with almost kind of like. I believe this is part of a whole series here. Edition of 10. And this is sold out at 77 tazos too.
01:37:39.005 - 01:37:59.321, Speaker A: So pretty awesome. Again, these are like abstract, animated abstract artists who have been around for. Since 2021 for sure. I'm pretty sure on hen and whatnot. I just remember from early collecting coming across their works. So great to see them putting out work. Silva Santus.
01:37:59.321 - 01:38:31.843, Speaker A: This is the thing like in a sense when the art is coming out and people are buying and selling the art, it's really hard to say that this scene is dead because like, what's dead about this? I'm. There's too much work here for me to go through. Like I'm, you know, so of. Of significance. Silva Santu's City Burning. Pretty interesting take on the glitch, Rom, isn't it? Quite an unusual take. Whether it's the canvas, the ratio, or even just the animation and everything, it almost looks like something else has been added to it.
01:38:31.843 - 01:38:51.877, Speaker A: Edition of three. Sorry. Open edition for 420. Kyle Flemmer you lose. So a beautiful work here. Several just always these super rich textures. With Kyle Flammer it made an asepirite composed and animated in asepirite and then brought in.
01:38:51.877 - 01:39:15.565, Speaker A: So using pixel art and then bringing in kind of analog video glitch techniques. Super interesting. Here's Ex Mortal and this is an edition of one and it's at 180 tezos. So very cool. And another very rich kind of landscape looking work here by Xmortal. Amazing. Tachyons is back.
01:39:15.565 - 01:39:33.485, Speaker A: I don't know what's going on. I don't know if words getting out or people are just checking in or maybe there's some discord I don't know about here. There are many, trust me. I don't even really go to discord. So yeah, so Tachyon's another classic kind of glitch artist. Great to see them on the scene. They may have never disappeared.
01:39:33.485 - 01:39:45.210, Speaker A: It's totally possible. Joda. I don't think we saw this one. Safe place. So a super textured beach scene here by joda. Very cool. 1200 by 900.
01:39:45.210 - 01:39:55.927, Speaker A: Going to Lucas Ox for 20 tazos. Nice sale. Here's Klaus composition number 370. 370. That's more shows than we have here. I think. I'm at 367.
01:39:55.927 - 01:40:15.085, Speaker A: So Klaus doing very well. Here's 371. So super textured here. So shaking things up a little bit. And here's number 369. So nice work from Klaus here and continuing to sell his 21 tazos. Brilliantly.
01:40:15.085 - 01:40:29.965, Speaker A: Let's see what shows up here. Geno. So this is called Dune I think. And so it almost looks like sand dunes here. But it's virtue, it's. It's bordering on abstraction. And then a lot of analog video glitchery here, as you see here.
01:40:29.965 - 01:40:54.905, Speaker A: Location Argentina edition of 10. And here's our absurd deity and Gorka Glitch. I think Goria glitch hit play and kind of almost looks like AI here. You'll see it almost looks like Spock, but then it almost turns into the Doctor. So not sure. Chaffax spills a tea to his ornithological friend. A bird friend.
01:40:54.905 - 01:41:14.227, Speaker A: Secret lives of Vulcans 106. So this is foregone so far. Edition of 15 at 5 Tezos 55. Here's Salawaki, murder on the dance floor. So another cool, cool GLB. Cool scene here by Salawaki. Made in blender, original GLB.
01:41:14.227 - 01:41:25.419, Speaker A: And that is an edition of 100. And I think that sold out at three tazos. Sabrina. 300 tazos. Nice work. Great color and nice composition. Very cool.
01:41:25.419 - 01:41:55.415, Speaker A: Good for Salowaki. Let's continue here before this computer crashes. Sky Goodman, complete and total synthesis. So think of this as like the, you know, again, I don't think we're going to go with another hour and a half show here. So we're doing a big tour here as we look at Sky Goodman's recent work showing some exports, different exports using blender, stable diffusion, then brought back into blender to add lighting, texture. I love it. Edition of one.
01:41:55.415 - 01:42:21.523, Speaker A: Now 65 tazos. It's booming. Maybe that's why people are coming back, because it's actually kind of booming on Tezos, actually. Here's Canxapita. Sold for how much? 20 Tezos edition of one. And here, very nice combination of pixelation, maybe dragging the canvas, but maybe it's all raw AI for all we know. Interesting, novel visual textures as you see here.
01:42:21.523 - 01:42:35.955, Speaker A: Very kind of. It's got an AI. Looks like it might be raw AI. PNG collection of generated landscapes. Here's Skomra as we continue the AI with a stunning work. Stunning, stunning work here by Skomra. Pushing, pushing.
01:42:35.955 - 01:43:00.619, Speaker A: As more people use the stable diffusion, texturizing. Skomra pushes it. That's what you got to do. Beautiful, beautiful work from Skamra. Here's no Hygiene, who of course I follow more, you know, unpredictable work here. New visual experiences courtesy of no Hygiene. Look at that wild AI artist.
01:43:00.619 - 01:43:18.291, Speaker A: Here's another one. A lot pretty fun. Adding some pixelation into the mix. Just awesome. That is five tazos edition of 20. As we're almost done here, here's Neural Divine, I believe, making AI art here with a little bit more texture. Super interesting piece.
01:43:18.291 - 01:43:34.193, Speaker A: Here's Human Boy with kind of a different feel on this one. Almost like a landscape. And it is jittering and doing quite well here. 40 retweets so far. 161 likes. Nice work from Human Boy. And as we go into the final physicals here, look who it is.
01:43:34.193 - 01:43:50.465, Speaker A: It's o Shohei with 90s video games. Again, almost like Cap in there. Taking all previous works and I think putting them into one image. Very interesting concept. Simple but brilliant. Here's Machine. I miss him.
01:43:50.465 - 01:44:12.279, Speaker A: I'm not sure who this is, but it's always funny, it's always great. And look at how well interestingly painted this is. Actually, Machine continues to do quite well. Steve Turnella. Look at this gorgeous artwork. This is in Bucharest. Re Muscrecu's brilliant debut solo exhibition.
01:44:12.279 - 01:44:28.825, Speaker A: So new artist here. Super interesting piece there. Here's Babaji Matia, number one. So another car on fire. Great painting here, as you see, just excellently executed. Super charming. Tim Lahan, leaving from Shook 2019.
01:44:28.825 - 01:44:46.693, Speaker A: Very nice piece by Tim Lahan. Here's Charlie Stein, friend of mine in New York right now. Stack Tenderness, oil on canvas. Love this. She's doing really great work. Just worked and worked and worked and got really good. The Work Matters by Yuka Kurita.
01:44:46.693 - 01:45:03.813, Speaker A: So interesting piece. Just found on Instagram. Nice combination of hard edges and then almost spray. So huge or airbrush so you get these great contrasts there. Super original. So many great artists. My friend Ben out of Berlin who I may see tonight.
01:45:03.813 - 01:45:33.549, Speaker A: Hopefully some interesting Black Sabbath gta Vice City does a lot of memes too. Kind of look like pen drawings, don't they? Very interesting piece. So kind of new series from Ben Cecine, PA Ben on Instagram. And here's Element Li inkjet prints. I don't know if we looked at these, but pretty wild stuff here from Element Li. Really pushing the aesthetic boundaries. To their credit, it's not gallery.
01:45:33.549 - 01:45:46.479, Speaker A: Andrew Park. Look at this. This looks like it's inkjet. This is posted by. It's not gallery. Just another. Or is it jpegged out? Is it printed and jpegged? I don't know, but I like the message.
01:45:46.479 - 01:45:58.135, Speaker A: So have a nice weekend, everyone. Thank you for joining me on what's maybe the longest show we've ever done. Hopefully it is going to be recorded. Thank you for joining me. Have a great weekend. Until next time. Take care.
