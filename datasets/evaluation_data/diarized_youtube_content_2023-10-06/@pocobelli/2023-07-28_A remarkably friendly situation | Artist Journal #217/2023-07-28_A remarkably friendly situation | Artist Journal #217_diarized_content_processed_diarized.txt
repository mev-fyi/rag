00:00:03.800 - 00:00:26.914, Speaker A: What a week. Welcome back, everybody. It feels like the end of a long marathon this week. All I'm thinking about is finding a fancy italian restaurant, take my girlfriend out, spend a bunch of money, and hang out. Welcome back. Artist Journal, July 28, 2023. Broadcasting from a new location.
00:00:26.914 - 00:00:52.694, Speaker A: Still need to fix. Need to raise this camera a little bit. Welcome back, everybody. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. It's gonna be a shorter show today. Very late getting out of the gates today, haircut day, as you can see, and just a ton to do, but things are moving forward, things are getting better, and things are smoothening out. So that is thrilling.
00:00:52.694 - 00:01:19.166, Speaker A: And again, just so happy the weekend is finally here. So welcome back. Most of you are gonna know who this is. This, of course, is Eizou and Sky Goodman with this really fantastic collaboration. It's a match made in heaven. And, I mean, there's a lot of kind of cool things, of course, eight. So does a lot of, like, retro furniture, retro objects it's doing.
00:01:19.166 - 00:02:14.262, Speaker A: You know, there's the modern furniture series. There were the cell phones. And what's kind of interesting about this collaboration, Sky Goodman often does what I would call speculative sneakers, sneakers that don't exist, you know, created by AI, as far as I understand, sky's work. So it's kind of a cool mix of what I'm tempted to call, like, retro chic with objects that don't exist. It's sort of like retro Sci-Fi futuristic objects, you know? So pretty cool. And again, this beautiful treatment here, this very warm treatment from Eizo on these sneakers. And we're kind of back to this idea, too, of outlines, of taking specific areas, masking them out.
00:02:14.262 - 00:02:45.754, Speaker A: I mean, interestingly, though, I mean, it's not a super clean outline here, which, again, gives it kind of a Warhol feel to it. You see how the green kind of goes out a little bit and then stretches out here so it's not perfectly within the outline, and that kind of actually makes it even better. So just beautiful here. And again, that just warm tv snow. Just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful here from eight. So in Sky Goodman, here's another one. So I think it's a four part series, although they may be tempted to make more video feedback, slip on highs.
00:02:45.754 - 00:03:11.952, Speaker A: Excuse me. Considering how well they turned out, they may be tempted to make more. And just a really, really, really cool series, again, kind of plays with your mind because you're kind of feeling, oh, this should feel retro with all of the kind of analog gear, but it's actually a sneaker that probably doesn't exist. An AI sneaker. So just really cool. And here is some work by just eight. So solo.
00:03:11.952 - 00:03:23.088, Speaker A: I love this one. I almost started the show with this one too. Just a really. I love this one. Beautiful. It's beautiful. And even the little antenna here and everything.
00:03:23.088 - 00:03:35.904, Speaker A: The red. The red writing user interface, the massive phone. It's just awesome. Roamer. And this is a one of one. Let's just see. I mean, selling for 25 tazos.
00:03:35.904 - 00:03:55.492, Speaker A: Sticking with the really cheap prices. Here's the Nikia 1110. I kind of wonder if this is the one I had, but I think I had the other one that we were looking at yesterday. The Nikia was my first cell phone. Like a lot of you out there, only 25 tezos. Is it still available? Still available. So that is pretty rad, too.
00:03:55.492 - 00:04:18.264, Speaker A: And let's just look at that. And again, it feels like there's almost like, you know, when Apple filters, if you have an iPhone, there's like the warm filter and the cool filter. These all feel like the warm filter or something. Very warm colors. And I love that actually, about it. It makes me just happy to be there. Some interesting comments, actually.
00:04:18.264 - 00:04:36.180, Speaker A: Someone actually, at the very end. And I'll come back to the top comments here. Crash. Stop. Made a very, I thought, astute observation, I think, miro esque for the first tuques. Yeah, I thought so too. And we're gonna look at some Miro, actually, let's do that quickly.
00:04:36.180 - 00:05:02.812, Speaker A: Now, I thought, a very astute observation here. Yeah. I think even more so than Kandinsky because Kandinsky kind of has those straight angles, right? Has these straight lines. Whereas with Miro, it's kind of a bit more free form, curvy sort of thing. You know, this looks surprisingly digital. This almost feels like a treated file. It's so clean, this.
00:05:02.812 - 00:05:17.358, Speaker A: This image of a miro. Excuse me. Look at that. Great music notes here. This is more of what I think of with a miro as far as texture. But in terms of composition, they both look like classic miro here. And you see it.
00:05:17.358 - 00:05:46.290, Speaker A: So just that kind of free form, you know, style. Now, this is a slightly different style of miro's, but I thought I'd bring it up anyway. And look at this great contrast of this kind of texture. Yeah. You know, almost like charcoal here. And then with this straight kind of almost like marker or pen. And it's easy to forget how early Miro was like.
00:05:46.290 - 00:07:02.714, Speaker A: I mean, was making a lot of, I think, this kind of work. I mean, I would guess the 1920s and thirties and I mean, you're really seeing more roots of abstraction. Of course, there are the murrahs works that are data. So abstraction, you know, the history of abstraction is really interesting. But I think Miro, definitely not the first, of course, Kandinsky before, but definitely one of those kind of really important, I would think, you know, seminal figures in the history of abstraction, particularly, you know, I think it was Clement Greenberg, the famous, you know, art historical critic, the art historian, you know, the very famous kind of, you could maybe argue, maybe the first kind of critic, rock star Clement Greenberg, who was the main guy who was discussing the abstract expressionists and really what the pop artists arguably revolted against. But Clement Greenberg, if I'm not mistaken, kind of emphasized this idea of the flattening of the canvas. And even it's one of the interpretations of modern art in general, is a flattening of the canvas where it flattens to the surface.
00:07:02.714 - 00:07:44.602, Speaker A: You know, you think of a renaissance work, it's volumetric, it's this illusionistic. And as you get more modern with impressionism and as you get towards just abstract expressionism, it's literally about the paint on the canvas that is the subject matter. And here, if you can see that, and I mean, look, it's a trope. It looks like, I guess these are similar paintings here, but it looks like it's something that Miro used quite a bit, though, in different works. This idea of putting this charcoal underneath, you know, this layering of sorts. And so all to say, great observation there. Crash.
00:07:44.602 - 00:08:04.594, Speaker A: Stop. Great observation. A couple more comments here. Natively AI plus one going to my dictionary. That's great. I'm glad we are breaking new ground linguistically here on this program. And I appreciate that feedback because sometimes I'll just throw out stuff like that, not really knowing if there's a.
00:08:04.594 - 00:08:41.638, Speaker A: But it's great to hear that people also like that term because it's different from raw AI. Raw AI is making a work that is only using AI, where something that is natively AI is something is making a work that only could have been made with AI. Perhaps as I adjust my hair. Here it is late in the week. It is latest I've ever recorded this show in the day, but I am here. Rune tune, I really glad you brought up that Nicholas Sassoon comment. Build a community of people you can rely on.
00:08:41.638 - 00:09:14.290, Speaker A: We often see the conversation pushing and pulling on this theme of either putting the art front and center or the market. Either focus on the art as a means of pursuing your passion versus doing more work to promote yourself to be more successful. We rarely put the social aspect front and center. I think that this is a wonderful lens to view from. I'm grateful for sales. I appreciate any incentive to create, be it as a passion or a market based motivation. But I forget there's more to this than being creatively productive and potentially, hopefully, a full time artist.
00:09:14.290 - 00:09:43.384, Speaker A: But it's the relationships with people like you that make this more than just selfish individualism. Well, the feeling is mutual. Rune Toon, who has shown up to almost to every single. Since joining the Twitter spaces, Rune Toon has showed up to every single show only late once when he had a plumbing problem. So that's a. There's a plumber there, so pretty good reason. So I think this is worth highlighting, too.
00:09:43.384 - 00:10:38.964, Speaker A: You know, Kapn was mentioned on this week's spaces, all the great friends that Kappen has made in this scene. Like, I think it's actually weirdly friendly for an art scene. You know, like, most art scenes are kind of friendly, but when you start digging deep, I mean, they're intensely competitive. This scene is remarkably friendly. And I'm sure there's competition on a certain level. We're all competing, but it's not like the knives have been coming out or anything, you know? And I mean, it's not perfect, but it's like a remarkably friendly situation and something that, you know, it really is. I mean, who is mentioning their deathbed over and over? Maybe that was a different conversation I was having, but it's something where on your deathbed, you can feel good about it, right? I mean, something you can feel good about on your deathbed.
00:10:38.964 - 00:11:04.390, Speaker A: Eizo, thanks again for your kind words. I was overjoyed to do this four part shoe collab with sky. So we're just starting the show with the last two works from this four part shoe collab. The other two came out today. In fact, Skye is an amazing artist and will very likely find another project to collaborate on soon enough. I'm glad to hear. As for the cell phone series, I very much am doing things by the seat of my pants on this one.
00:11:04.390 - 00:11:29.324, Speaker A: You're right, it's a cheap way to get a one of one. When I decided I wanted to do this series, I wanted them to be accessible to all. And I hope that folks can relive part of their technological past with these. So for the joy of art, Eizo is at your service. So really great comments here, eizo. And I hope to pick up one of those. One of ones when I have a few more tez in my wallet.
00:11:29.324 - 00:11:55.748, Speaker A: Great work and yeah, I'd love to see more collabs with sky begging to happen. KF Kyle Flemmer always finding new exceptional artists from this journal. Cheers and Zach Lloyd. Great episode. Missed that last Zokzo. There's another one coming up today from a couple of days ago, so had to scoop a star x block today. I haven't really considered all the logistics of an open edition, but these Zoxo works are getting me inspired to make one myself.
00:11:55.748 - 00:12:18.704, Speaker A: Yeah, really awesome artist. I agree. And boss, gracias. That awesome artist that uses the digital or the film negatives. Adrian, it's always a pleasure to come across this journal and apart from your curator's perspective, I truly appreciate the enthusiasm in every collection talking. We can see passion in each of these entries. Love and thanks for that.
00:12:18.704 - 00:12:46.704, Speaker A: Thank you very much for including us in this new episode. We love this series too. Do you want to know who the artist of Senecio? I know that mystery is fine too, but I can reveal it. Some friends that go to Europe bring them to me from a museum and when they leave, I told them to bring something just for me and they know I'm a collector. I'm. Did we mention Selet Senecchyo? I'm trying to remember. It's been a long week, Busca, but feel free to message me.
00:12:46.704 - 00:12:59.440, Speaker A: I do want to know the artist of Senecio. Edmorola. Always great to hear from you. Awesome, awesome artist. Check out his YouTube and look who we heard from as well. Cider. Hi vocabelly, this is cider.
00:12:59.440 - 00:13:17.544, Speaker A: Thank you for featuring me once again. Love having being fun with these love been having fun with these fruit series. So just totally awesome. H human boy. Great episode. Thank you. Primitive intel and crash stop of course, with that excellent observation on the Miro esque quality of Tewks work.
00:13:17.544 - 00:13:45.792, Speaker A: This is just kind of a funny thing for those long time viewers here. There was once a work that Ukscene had made and I thought it might have been a tamagotchi. And then it was kind of like a mini meme, let's call it that within our community here. Goodnight. Gave the xcene. So now. So first we had first indio robot made a version of this and it was hilarious.
00:13:45.792 - 00:14:11.844, Speaker A: But then now it's being put into Runway. Now for those that might not know, Runway is a the new AI. It's kind of mid journey for video, as far as I understand. I've never used it myself. The way these things go, I'll probably use it in six months after everybody has tried it out, and then I will end up using it. But look at this. So it turns into a commercial now, as if it's like a diamond ring for your wedding anniversary or something.
00:14:11.844 - 00:14:27.356, Speaker A: So hilarious. The fun continues. There was the original there. Look at how beautifully this was done. India robot. Nice work. So taking it to the next level, I never get tired of art matter, the pen work.
00:14:27.356 - 00:15:02.874, Speaker A: So this is Zancann. So there's actually maybe a little too much in here to read, but I just kind of want to. Let's look at this. This is kind of what I want to highlight here, which is just these pen plotters at work. I mean, look at how I can watch this all day. It's three minutes and 18 seconds, so we won't watch the whole thing. It never runs out of ink.
00:15:02.874 - 00:15:52.804, Speaker A: Like, just awesome. Like, it makes art for you. I love it. Like, I. So, I mean. I mean, it's just insane, you know? Again, you get that natural contrast. Why this works, you know, just before we move on, why does this work? And I think the reason it works is because we have this digital lines, you know, these super mathematically precise lines, but we're also getting the randomness that comes with physical, you know, ink on paper with physicality, the randomness of physicality.
00:15:52.804 - 00:16:29.356, Speaker A: And so we're getting a natural contrast between that hard edge and then all the chaos that goes into the lines here, because, of course, this physical reality is not perfect. Perfect. It is not the forms, Plato's forms. Here we are dealing with matter. So we're gonna get different amounts of ink, and so it's gonna create these little chaotic lines. I mean, again, it's, like, hypnotic here. Should we just skip a little bit further and just see what happens here? So, like, who doesn't want one of these? Like, that looks awesome.
00:16:29.356 - 00:16:50.450, Speaker A: So I just had to share that with you. This is kind of hilarious. Pp cop offline edition. Really cool title. Now, this is a short film inspired in PpCop by PP Universal. This is by leprochant at auction for 50 tazos. And let's just see.
00:16:50.450 - 00:17:06.384, Speaker A: Created auction. So no takers yet. I have a cameo in here with the voice. So, anyway, new work by Leprechaun. Let's see what's going on. Kind of an ambition. I have no idea what's going on in this work.
00:17:06.384 - 00:17:47.644, Speaker A: Almost looks like a hastrubal waffle piece here. I wonder what program that was. I mean, pretty cool video. And then we recognize this from a previous episode. This mask, I believe. I mean, pretty ambitious. Like art video here.
00:17:47.644 - 00:18:26.580, Speaker A: No, it's PP. No, it's universal. Universal. I think that's me. Okay, we're almost done everywhere now. Very kind of museum esque. I mean, nice production.
00:18:26.580 - 00:18:46.472, Speaker A: Lepro chat. Very nice production. This could be in some biennale somewhere. Very nicely done. And then a little music at the end. I mean, it feels like one of those things. You'd see it like the Berlin biennial.
00:18:46.472 - 00:18:54.712, Speaker A: So hilarious. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry. Thank you. Leprechaun. Pretty wild stuff.
00:18:54.712 - 00:19:15.828, Speaker A: So you never know what you're gonna find on the blockchain here on a daily basis. Figments. Speaking of which, a one of one by figments. You know what I love about this piece, first of all? I love that it's a one of one. I got incredibly excited right away that there's a one of one of this figment series. Of course. Kappn.
00:19:15.828 - 00:19:47.364, Speaker A: If you haven't heard the Twitter spaces, that is worth listening to, it's in my feed. You know what I love about this is the minimalism of the animation. It is so minimal, yet it activates all of these static areas. And what is it? It looks like a little cursor. I mean, what's the name of this work here? Collectively staring into the void of the screen. But it looks like a prompt, right? Like an old prompt. Dos.
00:19:47.364 - 00:20:26.876, Speaker A: This looks like Dos or something. And look at that. I mean, so just repetition, you know, copy and paste here. And so again, we see the. It's kind of Warholian in the copying, but we see the difference here, because we don't have the randomness of physicality in this digital version, whereas in a Warhol, we have variation with each screen print, like we were seeing in the zancan. Okay, so just kind of interesting in passing, and let's just see what happened. 111 tezos to NFT spritz within 15 minutes.
00:20:26.876 - 00:20:44.048, Speaker A: So nice work, figments. Great work. Love to see a one of one of that series. That got me incredibly excited. Patio, Ed Marolla. So another interesting work here with some great dithering on this kind of wolf dog figure, this anubis of sorts here. And again, kind of.
00:20:44.048 - 00:21:06.598, Speaker A: It looks like some old columns here with some dithering. It's a nice contrast, these kind of old looking almost temples and structures and kind of classical columns with this digital dithering. And just beautifully done. Some nice textures here. And a screen. And a screen here. And again, some nice kind of cloud work here.
00:21:06.598 - 00:21:27.522, Speaker A: And here you almost see a big statue of sorts with a cool frame. We know the artist. Here it is. Ed Morolla. This looks like it was burned, so there may be a newer version of this or no, it was not sure what happened here. I guess we'll have to see procreate and aseprite. So let's not forget, probably started in procreate and move to aseprite.
00:21:27.522 - 00:22:11.322, Speaker A: So, exporting, combining softwares, you know, and again, each software for me increasingly is it's like a brush, for example, or it's like a medium, you know, it's like a tool set, whether like just like oil paints, or it's like adding, you know, acrylic heavy gel medium to your acrylics to give them that kind of painterly look. If you ever want acrylic paint to look like oil paint, use the liquitex super heavy gel medium. Golden makes it too. Richard Prince, I'm almost positive, uses it. I actually prefer it to oil paint because it looks more modern. A little Friday kind of tip and observation over here. Haiti Rockette.
00:22:11.322 - 00:22:29.854, Speaker A: See you. Check mark. Kind of quite an abstract glitch. Rom here from Haiti Rockette. Love it, as usual. And kind of bit of a war kind of look to it, doesn't it? Interesting, interesting, interesting. Only an edition of three.
00:22:29.854 - 00:22:55.362, Speaker A: It's kind of funny, this idea. Like the lower the edition number, there is a more of an excitement, I have to confess. I'm sure a lot of you feel that way too. And 986 burned, so none really sold. Minted at 112. Interestingly, it was listed at nine, and so it looks like Haiti. Okay, m four resi got one when they offered 20.
00:22:55.362 - 00:23:18.864, Speaker A: Nice work. Cool work. MC renders only a Tezos 1191 cents edition of 30. And here is what looks like a glitch. Rom process through, I'm guessing, analog video, Nintendo. And just a cool. You know what that ui reminds me of? Or this layout of this racing game, you know what that reminds me of? Was that.
00:23:18.864 - 00:23:59.844, Speaker A: Remember that hasdrubal waffle piece or Kujib one, where we're looking at the path across and again, we're seeing the influence of video games. Enter these digital compositions in works, say, by Kujib or else, aka hasdrubal waffle. That is worth noting. That is worth noting. Like, from a layout, from a compositional perspective, there is something that is distinguishing, say, some of the works that we're seeing. A lot of the works that we're seeing from, say, a renaissance work, an impressionist work, or, you name it, pre RaphaelIte work, whatever the case may be, and that's worth noting. And so interesting.
00:23:59.844 - 00:24:26.810, Speaker A: Nice work. MC renders SilVa SanTOS someone who really experiments heavily with the glitch roms here. And this looks like kind of a racing game of sorts, but not even clear. Very wide angle composition here, reminiscent of notorious man XTz Metamarka metamarcha needs more glitch. $0.50 edition of 50. And here Zoxo is back.
00:24:26.810 - 00:25:16.406, Speaker A: Star times block so a cool. So back to video games here, a cool combination of Twitter, sorry, a what is the name I am blanking Tetris. A cool combination of the Tetris UI going sideways with what looks like a Mario star with a little bit of drag, you know, feedback, we might say, or delay, to use a musical metaphor on this. So just interesting, right? I mean, using video game elements in order to compose new works of art. Fascinating. Open Edition ElevEn minted $1.61 if you have it to spare.
00:25:16.406 - 00:25:41.150, Speaker A: Francoise Gammer with a pretty cool new work here. So playing still with the figure, instead of walking, it's running and just big blocks here. So you have to admire Francoise Gammer's versatility. Now, I thought this was a new one. Sometimes I get confused by the notifications here on object. This is actually from a year ago, 2022. So I guess it was listed.
00:25:41.150 - 00:26:10.344, Speaker A: I thought it was kind of strange because I hadn't seen Francois's list on versum for a while. I don't think so. Anyway, cool work and always good to go in the past. Mika Oladev, Artifact number 19, and this is an edition of 135 Tazo is still available. So interesting glitch artist being quite prolific here and continuing with what looks like a portrait of a person's head. Almost like a portrait style. Interestingly square.
00:26:10.344 - 00:26:32.664, Speaker A: Worth observing, 5000 by 5000 pixels. Nice, cool kind of ascii or character text here. Interesting work as usual. Mika Oladev Guandanarian Open edition only formented here. Three tazos $2.46 for this really cool animated abstract pixel artwork. Great color too.
00:26:32.664 - 00:26:55.692, Speaker A: Really cool work here. Interesting writing. Guandanarian cool artist. And of course, many of you will recognize this as mech TXT, aka Michael Macasso, the golden field. And there is something just kind of regal about this work, something queenly about this work. In great colors here. Blue and yellow.
00:26:55.692 - 00:27:25.722, Speaker A: Almost like a new palette, somewhat by Michael Macasso. So interesting work here. Kind of, you know, here's the day, what looks like the night, and but almost, maybe the four seasons. Not sure. Interesting, ambitious work. John July 27, 2023 so this came out yesterday edition of 25. So I'm not sure if John's been putting out work every day, but this stuff just goes like hotcakes.
00:27:25.722 - 00:27:41.534, Speaker A: Like, 50 tezos each edition of 25, we're talking 1250 tezos. That is impressive. And look, it's not like John is holding on. He's holding on to one. It's not like he's holding on to half of them. And then they're selling out. Very impressive.
00:27:41.534 - 00:28:08.966, Speaker A: So there is John, July 27, enjoying the summer in the pool with a lot of the objects. Keeping it interesting here and the grid and everything, and even what looks like a Mario brick wall or something. Very cool. And, I mean, it looks probably selling out in, like, selling out in, like, an hour. That is really impressive. And that great hose with the pixels coming out of it. Giomarianni, don't cling to me.
00:28:08.966 - 00:28:41.786, Speaker A: I can't fix you. Cool title. Almost looks like a Madonna, uh, like a virgin Mary figure here, doesn't it? And just really interesting, uh, pixel art from Gio Mariani, someone who, if you're, you know, who's been around the Tezos blockchain for quite a while, really interesting, uh, move here. And the more you look at it, the more mysterious this work becomes. And you see all the creativity that goes into the work. Interesting palette, too. Just a lot of interesting stuff going on.
00:28:41.786 - 00:28:59.242, Speaker A: And, of course, rat cloak. See, I mean, we're just discussing this on how, on Tazos, if rat cloak, see, put something out, it'll sell out in two minutes, and then it triples in price. And I think that's exactly what happened here. I don't. I wonder this. It almost feels like it's from the fake bacon series. Something on the chair.
00:28:59.242 - 00:29:12.296, Speaker A: Untitled one, 1 minute, 23 seconds. Number 123. Not sure. Interesting title. 5400. So, pretty large work here. Edition of ten.
00:29:12.296 - 00:29:34.592, Speaker A: And as you're going to see here, selling out at 20 tezos, each within, basically ten minutes. Less two minutes. Selling out in two minutes. A quick 200 tezos for a rat cloak on objects. So very impressive here. Now selling for 70 tesos. So there you go.
00:29:34.592 - 00:29:58.808, Speaker A: There's your three and a half x there for those buyers. Really nice painterly work here. Interesting colors. Kind of a mysterious composition. Again, kind of feeling like it's got the fake bacon vibe going on here. Not that circular kind of Francis Bacon backdrop, more of an office backdrop. And then these figures that are kind of metamorphosizing here.
00:29:58.808 - 00:30:20.498, Speaker A: And the shadow almost continuing that metamorphosis sorts here from the computer screen. And interestingly, we were commenting on the plug last time. This time it's not so much just straight down. Now it's across. So interesting move. And also interesting move on the shadow here. So ratcloak, doing a lot of experimentation here.
00:30:20.498 - 00:30:38.430, Speaker A: Pretty interesting. And then even here, so ambitious and experimental, as we love from Ratcloak. Here's a new one from Greco. A new sports work. I was kind of trying to figure this out. So it is a golf work. I think we saw tennis work last time.
00:30:38.430 - 00:30:58.208, Speaker A: The guy's smoking. This guy's smoking while he's playing golf. The last guy was smoking while playing tennis. And these great shadows. Almost dally, like de Chirico type shadows. And then there's the golf ball here. Is ambiguous for me because here it seems like there's a boat with someone in the background.
00:30:58.208 - 00:31:11.144, Speaker A: This seems to be water here. I'm not exactly sure what's going on, but. So interesting work, though. And ambiguity is a great thing. Lost. Interesting title. Luxury without money.
00:31:11.144 - 00:31:21.584, Speaker A: Love the title of that series. Looks like it sold. Just transferred. Just transferred. I think I actually got one of these. I did. So big shout out and thank you to Greco.
00:31:21.584 - 00:32:00.236, Speaker A: Lewis Osborne with a new work here. Feeling pumped. And just an interesting as ever work from Lewis Osborne continuing to release on Tezos. And here we see a kind of machine with a head bouncing ball pumping the emotions or the happiness pumping up this person in the chair here. So pretty interesting device here. And just interesting work with that graphic design look from Lewis Osborne edition of 25. And now it is not even for sale on secondary.
00:32:00.236 - 00:32:24.708, Speaker A: Sold out on primary at 20 tezos each. So I think it's great. I mean, again, maybe harder to sell, although Ratcloak sold his work on Ethereum. But, you know, these bigger sales are harder to do. But the low sales, again, you see like Ratcloak sells out in three minutes. I'm sure is probably these were transferred, but I think, or no, just offers coming in. Look at the offers coming in.
00:32:24.708 - 00:33:00.056, Speaker A: So, you know, Tazos native Ed lost in the room of thoughts. I thought pretty interesting work here from native Ed. You know, continuing to experiment here in this almost like VR backdrop. It's almost like the holodeck of Star Trek here. And this, you know, person walking intently across this, you know, matrix of sorts. Again, you know, an interesting kind of. We saw who does this, you know, white humanoid remind you of? You know, who it reminds me of.
00:33:00.056 - 00:33:28.294, Speaker A: You want a distant association. Is Kappn the analogy for consciousness and the soul in Kappn. Here's like another kind of almost another take with this kind of humanoid made of light. And look at this euxine ever experimenting. Finally makes a GLTF. I guess we shouldn't be surprised at this point, an energy drink. And the last person I remember to make an energy drink was dye with the most likes, actually.
00:33:28.294 - 00:33:52.224, Speaker A: And so here we see just cool kind of a stickers and axeen kind of brushwork on top of a bottle with a big portrait sticker on top. Making it look easy, by the way. Making it look easy. So cursed brew, is that the title? Cursed brew. One word, very nicely done. Only $17.95 on secondary.
00:33:52.224 - 00:34:13.688, Speaker A: Let's just see what it sold for on primary. 15 tezos, I believe. Looks like maybe offers accepted. So interesting. That's still a heck of a lot of money. Almost probably 1000 tezos for axin there. Continuing on Coda Nakazono continuum number 131.
00:34:13.688 - 00:34:38.374, Speaker A: So they continue with a banana and a record, vinyl record in the background. And this kind of metallic biomorphic shape, a prism. Interestingly and interesting brushstrokes. So just interesting work as usual from Coda Nakazono. I still remember that super happy profile picture on Twitter, which I hope is still there. Renki USA. This is USA.
00:34:38.374 - 00:35:10.540, Speaker A: And they almost look like pills. I was trying to actually put this beside UK scenes work because I thought of UK scenes work with the pills. All to say cool work here, kind of, you know, continuing the experimentation. And something worth pointing out here, which is something I point out often, you see how it's static on top and then underneath everything is moving. But this again, this contrast of the static is always super interesting. It really just adds another element of interest and drama. Another one by Renki Yanagigora.
00:35:10.540 - 00:35:40.324, Speaker A: So I assume that's japanese. And just interesting kind of feedback, distortion and everything here, a little bit of delay. I'm using musical, you know, techno metaphors here. Like this just reminds me of digital feedback. Analog, digital or audio feedback is what that looks like to me, the visual equivalent. Kudukola, who has been experimenting my hair is quite poofy today. We will fix that on Monday.
00:35:40.324 - 00:36:09.556, Speaker A: Mountain passage edition of one. I'm really enjoying cuda Cola, of course, was making a lot of illustration, really kind of experimental illustration now is playing with this kind of pixel digital sample brushes, it seems. Interesting work. Mountain passage edition of one and sold for a tezos. Only a tezos. So you got a one of one for $0.80. Can't go wrong with that.
00:36:09.556 - 00:36:28.756, Speaker A: LB numb. Cool abstract here from LB. I think a pretty nice piece here to convey numbness. Nice work from LB here. Edition of 20 for two tazos. There are 19 left. The market is still figuring out how it feels about Elbie's new work here.
00:36:28.756 - 00:36:39.680, Speaker A: This may have just been listed though. So cool work. And I love this one. Ex mortal. I was tempted to start the show with this one. Reverie. Trash nostalgia special drop for the trash.
00:36:39.680 - 00:36:53.764, Speaker A: For trash. So there are more trash works coming this one by now for ten tezos. And I thought this was great. Look at how perfect this is. And the colors. The colors are beautiful. Nice work from exmortal.
00:36:53.764 - 00:37:15.704, Speaker A: And look at Bosco. Gracias. Bosco, gracias. I assume look at these awesome one of ones that are coming out. I think it's La Playa. There's something very contemporary art museum of the feeling about these works and you gotta love how it shows. Like them coming like the before and after.
00:37:15.704 - 00:37:30.018, Speaker A: Really nicely done work here. This is a one of one. This went to ahack. Big shout out to ahack. Awesome collector laplaya. Alive memories. This one I think went to Sabato.
00:37:30.018 - 00:37:54.374, Speaker A: There was a second one. It went to Sabato. Only ten tezos for these one of ones. I just think really nice work here. Like, if I saw this in a contemporary art museum photo or art museum, I'd be like, yeah, this is exciting work. It's fun to look at, isn't it? It feels like modern contemporary art. Like very nice work here.
00:37:54.374 - 00:38:13.494, Speaker A: One of one for ten tazos. Can't go wrong for your kind of museum in your mind. Cabin Island Lake. Alive memories. Here is just one more. There's a few more. I encourage you to check them out and how they leave, how he leaves the shadows, like what looks like a hand over here.
00:38:13.494 - 00:38:33.494, Speaker A: Kind of blocking a little bit. I love it. I love it. There's something just kind of magical about these really nicely done tenteso still available. And this is DJ Curo. Big shout out. Sends me a bunch of artists slumber and this looks like it's using Runway, which is mid journey for video.
00:38:33.494 - 00:38:56.496, Speaker A: For those that it's just people are starting to use it. Kind of a bit of a creepy video here of what looks like almost a robot or some sort of AI figure. Slumber 690 edition of three. There are three left. So the market is waiting and deciding. Danielle King with some interesting works. And again I heard Danielle and Santiago in a super air space.
00:38:56.496 - 00:39:19.288, Speaker A: Very interesting. And we've looked at Danielle King's work before edition of one. So we have a few of them. This is Bemidji, Minnesota, an imagine moment from a lonesome road trip across the US. Generated with improps, open studio and upscaled. Kind of feels like Jean Baudrillard's America. You know, this would be, this would be like the pictures that would go alongside it.
00:39:19.288 - 00:39:36.000, Speaker A: Look at this. Great. So this is, I believe, raw AI or AI art, but it almost looks like, you know, tape is here. Really nice work here from Danielle King generated with M Props open Studio. I've never used this one, actually. I've never even heard of it. Maybe that's another AI tool.
00:39:36.000 - 00:40:06.942, Speaker A: And upscaled. There are some great upscalers out there, by the way. Danielle King, Gimon. So here's Oklahoma. So again, more photography, interestingly, I mean, this is almost like AI photography, but more photography coming into this show, I find interestingly Chillette, Wyoming. And again, I'm looking at these edges, these wonderful edges and these wonderful colors and just like this empty landscape with this almost like dally, like kind of object in there on the left. So that's Wyoming.
00:40:06.942 - 00:40:17.718, Speaker A: Wyoming. And here is Kansas. Colby, Kansas. And this is a one of one. And these are selling for 50 tezos. Good job, Danielle. And so just cool.
00:40:17.718 - 00:40:36.204, Speaker A: This almost looks like a cinema out in the middle of the desert here. Just interesting work. You see the brushstrokes over here? Not sure you can see that. Almost like textured brushstrokes. Interesting work. And I love the sky here. It's like monochromatic, but in the screen of sorts, a cinema screen of sorts.
00:40:36.204 - 00:40:51.722, Speaker A: There's a blue sky. Very nice work. And is there another one more cactus, Texas. Almost like a postcard here. Nice colors here, too. So a tour through some of Danielle King's work. All one of ones and all 50 tazos.
00:40:51.722 - 00:41:03.370, Speaker A: Selling well with WJ. Picking up a couple of them, at least. Edge Q. With some cool experimentations, worked with trading cards in the past. Now is painting them. Rally art two. And this is a.
00:41:03.370 - 00:41:25.854, Speaker A: This is a one of one comes with a physical painting, which is a small size, which is a painting the size of a trading card. So if you want a one of one edge q physical work. Buy this for 30 tezos. You probably get it in the mail. How cool is that? Very cool. And nice painting, too. And look, speaking of nice paintings, this is at hologram gallery, which is Chimasuku Jackson, portrait of my heart.
00:41:25.854 - 00:41:45.824, Speaker A: They have a really nice show going on from Brandon Vosika. I have a feeling this hologram gallery is making waves in Seattle. It is right in downtown. And, I mean, they put on quite a few nice shows here. I mean, here's just more nice work. Who doesn't love cats? Cat pictures. Almost like a Christmas cat picture.
00:41:45.824 - 00:42:01.372, Speaker A: Beautiful. 42 inches by 32 inches. Acrylic and pastel on canvas. And here's more. It's not easy to do these text works and make them look interesting and cool. The same thing happens every time, you know. Still, somehow, it remains a mysterious sadness, I think.
00:42:01.372 - 00:42:14.408, Speaker A: Really nice work here. This is acrylic and pastel on canvas. I love you, buster. Kind of moving. Untitled number one. Just very cool work. And that, my friends, is your show.
00:42:14.408 - 00:42:19.424, Speaker A: That is our week. Thank you for joining me once again. And until next time, take care.
