00:00:02.920 - 00:00:31.954, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody. A big congratulations. You have made it. It is the first day of spring today, and that, my friends, is a glorious reason for us to congregate here and discuss some art. Artist journal, March 20, 2023. Broadcasting the world from the sunny vistas in my mind on the pirate ship, looking off at the nice, calm, smooth seas with the sun reflecting there. My name is Adrian Pokebelly.
00:00:31.954 - 00:01:03.752, Speaker A: Welcome back. You know what the high seas are. I remember I didn't even know what it meant when I said it, one episode broadcasting from the high seas of my imagination. So I looked it up and you know what it is? It's actually all the parts of the sea that are not part of countries territory. It's like the international sea area is actually the high seas. So that kind of adds another layer here. Speaking of layers, let's look at dan Control and keep these snappy.
00:01:03.752 - 00:01:36.374, Speaker A: I thought this was a brilliant work. Of course, we've been following Dan Control for months here and why I liked it. So, first of all, this work here called boing. One of the things I like about it is how it requires no explanation. There is the title boing, which basically confirms for us in our minds that this is a ball bouncing. What I like about it is how self consciously it is a digital work of art. It is.
00:01:36.374 - 00:02:13.362, Speaker A: You know, this repetition here, first of all, the gradient is kind of. I don't want to call it unmistakably digital, because people can paint pretty convincing gradients, but it is nevertheless a digital tool. There is the repetition, which is digital, and there is also. So there is that. So there's this kind of very digital aspect to it. And there are also all these themes that Dan has been playing with the gradient, the repetition, say, with the ducks or the chairs or everything, the lighters. Right.
00:02:13.362 - 00:02:47.428, Speaker A: And also this idea of the edge of the canvas making it, you could argue, a self conscious, like, it points attention to the fact that it is a work of art. This isn't simply like a impressionist painting where we're portraying the beach and, you know, clouds in the sky. This feels kind of weirdly, maybe not weirdly modern. It feels modern because it's bouncing off the edge of the canvas here. Right. It's calling attention to the fact that it's a work of art. And this is also a theme that Dan control has played with.
00:02:47.428 - 00:03:23.854, Speaker A: Remember the Nakia phone? And he had about five of these things where they're stretched all the way. And it was very awkward and what I'd almost call outrageous in a good way. You know, these outrageous works. Maybe we can find him quickly. So he's played with this idea with the edge of the canvas. Okay, so what I like about this is it basically distills a lot of the ideas that Dan has been working with in a very elegant way, because the thing with the ball is, it kind of makes sense. The movement of the ball is bouncing off the side of the canvas.
00:03:23.854 - 00:03:46.254, Speaker A: This is what balls do. They bounce around boing, as the work is called. So anyways, very interesting. 150 tezos, an addition of one. And this is part of a series called repeat. And here you can see other versions. And it appears to me that Dan has taken, as you can see, the yellow ball here, that layer on top.
00:03:46.254 - 00:04:20.854, Speaker A: It looks like he's taken that layer and each of these four layers and put them all together in this one work here, this one of one. Whereas these other versions, with beautiful colors here, we'll look at them individually. They are a tezos, each in additions of 100. It's kind of an interesting contrast in and of itself, the way the addition numbers and the pricing. Let me just show you quickly. For those that might not know, just very quickly, these stretched out works. I mean, yeah, here they are, see, like the phone and the can playing with the edge of the canvas here.
00:04:20.854 - 00:04:55.906, Speaker A: Okay, so this is, to me, this is kind of outrageous. Like, what are you doing? Right, but this is the idea. So that is also at work here. Right. Bouncing off the plane with the edges, calling attention to the work of art as a work of art. The work of art is calling attention to itself as a work of art by virtue of its, you know, calling attention to its limits, its frame, and then bouncing off of it. So I think just a kind of very elegant series here with just, again, conceptually very elegant.
00:04:55.906 - 00:05:24.828, Speaker A: And I think what's so striking for me about it, and which just made me keep coming back to it, was, again, how it requires no explanation. It's all there, communicated visually in a very simple way that even you could argue maybe a 15 year old, twelve year old would maybe have the exact same thoughts. I might. Right. And that's, you know, that's not an easy task. Big thank you to Sotheby. Not to Sotheby's.
00:05:24.828 - 00:05:46.416, Speaker A: To all the collectors who picked up Sotheby's ad. So very cool part of the pixel art series. Thank you, everybody. And a couple even on secondary there. So, anyway, really appreciate it. I posted it yesterday morning, went out for lunch at my girlfriend's sister's place. We all came back and was sold out.
00:05:46.416 - 00:06:22.124, Speaker A: And that made me very thrilled. It is, you know, what I said to myself is what a rush. It's a real rush, you know, selling art. So gonna have to do that more often. So anyways, there it is, Sotheby's ad again, using the square brushes and some dithering there and playing with really the contrast between the square and the organic movement that you get from using a pencil. So there it is. And of course, there's Warhol's Mick Jagger print and in the form of a Google Ad for Sotheby's continuing on.
00:06:22.124 - 00:07:13.644, Speaker A: Interesting comments. So we're discussing how prolificness in reality, contrary to what some people might think, actually builds credibility. And this is pretty much, I would argue it's not even a debate, but, I mean, people can debate it and people can disagree with me, and that's okay. But just in terms of the credibility of an artist, you're just in the best company that you could hope to be. If you're a prolific artist, it's something to aspire to as an artist. Leonardo with his 6000 drawings, Picasso with his tens of thousands of work, Warhol Basquiat, died young, made something like 600, 900 paintings, whatever it was. Van Gogh, you know, so is making a painting every day or two in the last three years, I think, you know, along those lines.
00:07:13.644 - 00:08:14.934, Speaker A: So in a sense, like, it's kind of, it's one of those areas of life where, like quantity, it's almost like size matters. Like quantity actually does matter because it sort of like, gets things spread out in a very kind of real way. Like, the more you have, the more that's out there. On a very basic level, I don't know if I'd say the more famous you are as an artist, but in a sense, on a certain level, because just because you make a lot of art doesn't mean that people are going to like it or collect it. So quantity isn't everything, but if it is something that people like and collect, then the more you have, the more that's just out there. And the more there is, it does kind of the more famous, in a sense, you are as an artist, in a sense, I would argue the more famous you become. So it's something to kind of, you know, aspire to as far as your art because you want your art to be known and celebrated.
00:08:14.934 - 00:08:43.032, Speaker A: And ideally, you enter the pantheon there of great artists. I mean, you know, let's be real here. That is, are you going to be an artist and you don't want to, you know, like, that's really the part of the point here. Okay, so anyways, all to say, oxygen had a comment about this whole idea of prolificness. Can't agree more with Exnardo's point. Who is making the point that, you know, to be prolific? You're in good company. Picasso, Basque, Leonardo.
00:08:43.032 - 00:09:14.628, Speaker A: If rarity is in someone's success recipe, I can't imagine anything more easy to replicate. Have a great weekend. So exactly. There's nothing more easy to replicate than scarcity. So this, to me, this idea, because it does, I think it's a result of actually the crypto NFT scene. Although I could see the contemporary art scene latching onto this to a certain degree if you start putting out too many works, but I don't. Yeah.
00:09:14.628 - 00:09:56.344, Speaker A: Overall, yeah. Like, I think the reason why a lot of, say NFT crypto is because they want scarcity, because then it's. The idea is it'll be more valuable because the more quantity there is, then the less value. And I think this is mistaken. Maybe in the short term, but in the very long term, you want an artist that is prolific, who is a force of nature, and a force of nature is not keeping everything bottled in or not bothering to do the work. You kind of want someone who's doing the work, spreading everything out as far as possible and selling it. And, you know, again, look at Picasso ceramics, sculpture.
00:09:56.344 - 00:10:34.752, Speaker A: And I'm not even a huge, like, Picasso guy, but you have to respect the experimentation and the prolificness. I wonder to myself if that's a word, but I'm not worrying about it. Kareem safa. So this is really interesting. So we know Kareem from the tezos and object. He puts together what I call these pixel art factories and you can see them in action. And what's so cool about this is it looks like it's on like a see through screen because it looks like we can see the subway kind of through this screen here, as far as I can tell.
00:10:34.752 - 00:11:03.504, Speaker A: I mean, so very cool work. And these kind of move around, you know, go go Litus and Kareem Safa are both, you know, my two kind of pixel art factory guys that do awesome work. So let's see what it says. I guess I've shared this version, except for the pictures. The piece was displayed on 5000 public screens in the Netherlands as part of the demo festival last year. It was also part of the Ancient Futures exhibition at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. So I assume that's there.
00:11:03.504 - 00:11:29.828, Speaker A: So that's super cool. So it looks like here's Karim Safa being exhibited in Istanbul along probably like 3000 5000 year old work. I mean, this is, you know, we were talking about the Louvre. This is pretty good. You know, when you're starting, when they're putting ancient work, the Istanbul Archaeology Museum. That's pretty fine. Karim Safa.
00:11:29.828 - 00:12:14.298, Speaker A: And here's the work for those that might not be familiar with it. So this is what happens on those screens. So, I mean, pretty rad, pretty cool. And again, kind of like we were saying with Dan Control's work, no explanation required, right? I mean, it is what it is and you gotta love it. I mean, I've been to so many exhibitions in the contemporary art world where you don't understand it and it's some, you know, picture from the seventies and it's supposed to be deep and everything, but you have to read like three pages of an artist statement or a page of an artist statement just to understand what it is. So I'm a big fan. The unnecessary machines, I mean, great title from 2022, so optimized for nine x 16.
00:12:14.298 - 00:13:00.034, Speaker A: So I'm a big fan of stuff where it doesn't require too much explanation because I think it communicates more successfully is where I'm going with that. Simone Pompey sent a message and it was very interesting. And he brought up this idea which I asked him if I could bring up here. He brought up this idea that discoverability is one of the trickiest parts of being an artist, say on object and just in the NFT art scene. NFT art scene. And I think there's a certain amount of truth to that. But I think it's also, I was thinking about that because, you know, I remember when I started, it's like you're basically, when you start, nobody knows who you are and, but I find it's actually a remarkably small scene, at least at this point.
00:13:00.034 - 00:13:51.660, Speaker A: So I was thinking to myself, like, if you're putting out work, you're tweeting it, even if nobody sees it, it still will get seen a little bit. You reply, you buy the odd work from other people. If you do that enough comment and say, great peace, whatever the case is. I think the more you do that, I don't think it's actually, I think discoverability is solvable, is where I'm going with that. I think it's solvable. And Simone also brought up this idea of how working on different series and how can that, you know, does that impact your perception, people's perception of you as an artist negatively if you have too many different kinds of series? And my answer to that is, first of all, there is precedent. I mean, you can go to Gerhard Richter.
00:13:51.660 - 00:14:40.942, Speaker A: If you ever go to a big Gerhard Richter show, you're going to see all sorts of different series. You can see that they're conceptual. They're process machines, as I call them. I call them process machines. So it's an idea that's explored and then variations, and then it's just continually explored. We see it with Richard Prince, you know, who does photographs of, like, the cowboys, kind of the Marlboro Cowboys, but then does the nurse, you know, the painted Nurses series, which are beautiful inkjet on canvas with beautiful acrylic with heavy gel medium. There's a tip for you on top, you know, so all to say, as far, as long as you're consistently exploring a series, I don't think it's a problem.
00:14:40.942 - 00:15:29.294, Speaker A: I think the problem is if you jump from thing to thing to thing without really properly exploring a series, and then I think you start to run into issues. I mean, I've thought about this a long time because I have about seven or eight different series. But the reality is, say, like, the nostalgia study series goes back to, like, 2012, and I'm still working on it. You know, I'm working on one today. Okay. So, you know, the screen memories related images series that I work on that's since 2017, and I'm still just kind of iterating and exploring. So I think for me, that makes it okay because I'm completely just, you know, evolving with it, moving with it, and, you know, exploring really what that series can do in a certain sort of way.
00:15:29.294 - 00:16:17.526, Speaker A: So to me, it's about being consistent in your inconsistency, you might say, or being consistent across these different series. Where people start to have reservations is when you jump from, I'm going to do one work this way, one work that way, one work that way, and then it's just hard for a collector to know what's going on, and it doesn't build credibility. But if you explore a series, do five of these, five of that, and then you don't go too crazy with too many different series. And often you can see, you know, consistency across those series, I'd argue, even if as different as they might be. So, anyways, thank you, Simone. And we're going to look at some of Simone's work in the AI section here. Quick update from strange thing.
00:16:17.526 - 00:16:38.542, Speaker A: Good morning. I'm excited to share a thread of midjourney v. Five raw AI photos that showcase stunning realism from complex details to fine art. This is a journey you don't want to miss. And here, almost strange thing gets professorial. It's like Professor Strange thing. You can see the lecture series that are coming, first of all.
00:16:38.542 - 00:17:00.398, Speaker A: So this is, you know, just another example of, you know, mid journey V five. So we see how almost hyper realistic this is. And the depth of field. Here's another one. And I just love the commentary here. An elderly man in a cafe. Take note of the dirt on the window here and the light reflection in his glasses, which all add to the realism.
00:17:00.398 - 00:17:28.072, Speaker A: So anyways, there is a ton here. I don't know if we strange thing put out a great thread, but just showing, look at the dust as he points out AI dust. I mean, it's so convincing. It's pretty amazing. And then so all sorts, he's pointing out the wing. Note the detail and sharpness in the wing. So kind of a master class here from a master of the AI art medium.
00:17:28.072 - 00:17:38.640, Speaker A: Strange thing here. So look at this. I mean, so it's pretty impressive. And as he says, great wallpaper. So nice commentary. I mean, quite useful. And it goes on.
00:17:38.640 - 00:17:58.504, Speaker A: So I also one more from strange thing on mid journey, V five. Been building prompts on v five for oil texture. So oil painting. Happy with the results. Now try to mix into my already complex wrong era prompts. Zoom in. So anyway, all to say, maybe we should zoom in here.
00:17:58.504 - 00:18:17.100, Speaker A: Here is the oil painting treatment. So even this reflection here, that is great. So let's just zoom in. Yeah, so anyways, so you can see there. So just interesting, interesting. From strange thing on midjourney v five. And one more on AI unknown collector.
00:18:17.100 - 00:19:03.658, Speaker A: In times of raising, in times of rising, AI perfection, I'm valuing the imperfect and weird more and more. Probably never will see me collecting, quote unquote, post photography if it's not bringing something new to the table besides looking good. Lol. So this is pretty interesting because this is something that a lot of artists anticipated. AI artists anticipated a few months ago that when you have these, what I call AI distortions, or you have six fingers or the hand turns into a doorknob or whatever the thing is, whatever the distortion is, that this will be seen as a moment in time. It's not a. Put it this way, it's a feature and not a bug.
00:19:03.658 - 00:19:53.924, Speaker A: And when I first looked at this stuff, I said, yeah, this is great and everything, but this is a bug. But what the artists said, the AI artist is actually, that's a feature. And I came to very warm up to that point of view. And now unknown collector is saying, you know, I'm not really into this AI perfection as much as I am into the distortions, as far as I understand this. So pretty interesting. And now it's gotten so good with mid journey v five, it sounds like people are calling it post photography, which kind of is a term that seems to have been lifted from, you know, the photography sphere to talk about people who, you know, take a picture and then maybe glitch it out or whatever the case is. So, I mean, we saw Sabato, I think, last show referencing post photography in the context of AI.
00:19:53.924 - 00:20:28.744, Speaker A: And I think he was actually referencing how that definition was sort of getting lifted out and getting changed by the new mid journey. Another just interesting comment, this time from Skye Goodman. The narrative that forms from the collective seems random, but it's all a conversation we've been having. And so here you see, you know, Skye Goodman's work here, the basketball sneakers. And then you see a Sabato work of the basketball. And there is more Sabato and more Sky Goodman. And this almost looks like Koda Nakazono, but I'm not sure about that.
00:20:28.744 - 00:20:52.460, Speaker A: So anyways, I couldn't agree more about this. And that is what makes a healthy, interesting, strong scene is artists responding to each other. Right. So just a worth mentioning that comment here and retro Manny, new drop for tez tone. So this is like a Tazos music thing. I don't know too much about it. See the full version of my collab with JPZ at 01:00 p.m.
00:20:52.460 - 00:21:17.792, Speaker A: So here it is. And I think there's some. Is there any. Yeah, so anyways, kind of cool eighties music. So and there is the event and I think I brought up. Yeah, let me try bringing it up again. They have this area in spatial IO, so not on cyber, but it's kind of similar.
00:21:17.792 - 00:21:41.624, Speaker A: Let's see if this loads up. And I think last time I saw a space background. Let me just try loading this one more time. And anyway, here is their. Maybe it's daytime now. And so anyways, interesting how the person is reading the artist statement here. And then you turn around.
00:21:41.624 - 00:21:58.020, Speaker A: Yeah, I think that's my. There's the space background. And now the works are loading up. So these. Yeah, and then you can walk through and there is a piece there. So here it is and everything. So anyways, that is happening.
00:21:58.020 - 00:22:24.738, Speaker A: Tez tones genesis collection. Check it out. So this came out on Friday, the myth added to camp Creme. So the final kind of works here on Camp Creme with the hilarious pearl necklace. You start to see the. The themes that are that reoccur with the leopard print and the pearls here. He put a nice kind of rose and some beautiful texture here in the background.
00:22:24.738 - 00:22:44.714, Speaker A: And you also see it in the color here. These are not typical myth colors. So the myth, what's the title of this? The last romantic of Neptune. Even the title seems kind of campy. The myth, camp creme event 2023 by now for 30 tezos. And there is one left. There is one left.
00:22:44.714 - 00:23:13.250, Speaker A: So get it while you can. Very cool work. And this also came out from the myth, I think, last night, my Sunday trip. So it looks like myth may be doing some exploration in inner space here and coming back to report to us over the digital airwaves here. And there is myth in different colors. So interesting, interesting work. And a new work from someone who we haven't seen from in a while.
00:23:13.250 - 00:23:44.722, Speaker A: Matias la Plata is back in action. And this, although it looks physical, this works was, this work was my first work done on an iPad. So here it is. And it looks like an ode to Argentina here. And just kind of a really cool, you know, work with a lot of different stuff and some nice brush work here playing. It looks like he's exploring the iPad and procreate is what it looks like to me. Adios Muchachos is a work inspired by the country where I was born, Argentina.
00:23:44.722 - 00:24:05.998, Speaker A: So there it is. Price of twelve tezos, edition of 15. And that is now on secondary. It sold out for five tezos. So very cool, very cool work. And great to see Matthias La Plateau. I think it's Matthias La Plata back in action here.
00:24:05.998 - 00:24:32.998, Speaker A: So board me, social club, last camper standing. Interesting title, happy camper. And lust is in the braces here, over here. And a big nose ring. So anyways, interesting, strange kind of work. Interesting contrast once again between the shirt, the treatment of the shirt, the background, and the face. Almost looks like a wrestling mask.
00:24:32.998 - 00:25:00.364, Speaker A: And this guy is crying, the happy camper with this strange, you know. So again, another surrealist work here. An interesting layering here. You almost see kind of brushwork underneath this, you know, textured brushes with physical brush marks on top. So anyways, very interesting digital drawing from board me social club. And this is what is going on here. An edition of three and transferred one to Mikey Wilson.
00:25:00.364 - 00:25:29.810, Speaker A: So maybe part of Camp Creme, the last camper standing. Maybe that's a reference to that, perhaps gloom two. How are we doing here? Got to run. Total mental control, real world application. So here's gloom tube, paranoia, delusion anxiety. Anyways, a new work on foundation with this newer kind of style that he's been experimenting with that has a lot more texture in it. So continuing to experiment here.
00:25:29.810 - 00:25:47.974, Speaker A: This almost looks like a poster of some kind. Paranoia, delusion, anxiety. And sold for 23. And so gloom tube continues to sell. This went to greatest tanuki on foundation. A new one from Sumiresi. My hands.
00:25:47.974 - 00:26:21.082, Speaker A: It's another kind of dark work here. And we see what appears to be a woman looking at her hands and light coming. It's unclear if the light is coming where the light is coming from. So interesting, mysterious work, nice texture and a nice contrast of the color with the black and white available for ten tazos. There are three left on primary edition of eleven. My hands and good old hasdrubal waffle has entered back on the scene. Thinking of you with a dagger in my heart.
00:26:21.082 - 00:26:57.888, Speaker A: Playing again with, you know, the kids painting tools and almost seeming to. It's hard to tell if it's almost tempting to think this person is working on a tablet, but probably not. This person is probably just looking at a picture of a clown, which. And then with the dagger in my heart. Thinking of you with a dagger in my heart. And there's some blood with a lot of texture on the ground here. So anyways, kind of another interesting work with that beautiful frame that we love from hasdrubal waffle.
00:26:57.888 - 00:27:08.616, Speaker A: And a little bit of gradient there. And there's another one. S a o m h. Sneak attack on Merle Haggard. Never forget. So I think that's a country singer. I'm not sure.
00:27:08.616 - 00:27:38.218, Speaker A: And here's some naked guy jumping on Merle Haggard in a sneak attack. This, I'm not sure if it's the same software, but another probably kids software painting software tool that has dribble waffle likes to used. These are both at auction for 15 in addition of five and three. And here's one by Rini Fish, who we've looked at once before. Another mysterious artist who actually hangs really well with hasdrubal. Let's see if there's volume. I don't think so.
00:27:38.218 - 00:28:04.566, Speaker A: So just a, you know, kind of a wild work here. I think Renee Fish has like a nice audience on Twitter. From what I could tell last time I posted something on her, it was, yeah, there's a lot of, a lot of people seem to really like her work and there's a lot of excitement. Let's call it that. So here, let's see if we can get this one working. So I think that other one just came out. And here's a new one.
00:28:04.566 - 00:28:20.374, Speaker A: I can see why. I mean it's just really just kind of mysterious. It's different, it's very original. And so anyways, edition of 15. This is for 29. So this came out March 7. This other one just came out over the, on Friday.
00:28:20.374 - 00:29:05.602, Speaker A: And so let's just look. Let's see what it sold for on primary quickly, nine tazos. So. Okay, awesome. Another failed artist from Wasteman Goldman 21 self portrait my struggle and kind of interesting, an artist in a studio apartment with real life tattooed on the back, fries in his little cube and with his computer on his little night table and a bed and some pizza in McDonald's pizza and yeah. So anyways, and with this big light over top. So a, another kind of sad portrait of the failed artist, my struggle.
00:29:05.602 - 00:29:32.630, Speaker A: Buy for three tezos edition of twelve. Let's see how many are left here. Still eleven to go. So go support the wasteman Goldman there. Andrei Gora. This came out I think last month, but I didn't see it. Apes planet and Gora of course has collaborated with gogolitis and put out a work on super rare that we saw at least two or three months ago.
00:29:32.630 - 00:30:22.548, Speaker A: So anyway, put out a new one and I just thought it was a cool, I don't know, portrait of our scene here with there's your keyboard, there's Twitter, super rare, Google Kukai object manifold. All kind of interesting bonk price, you know, for those people that got the airdrop of Bonk. So anyways, a skull of an ape, though almost reminiscent of bored ape yacht club, a little bit there and sun and anyways, just a pretty nice illustration here. It's a reserve of one ETH from Andre Gora lost on web3 apes planet Flora Marquez. So just an update on her drawing series. After two months and a half of drawing and minting every single day, today my collection nulla Diza Sina Linnea finally reached 1000 tezos of volume. That's pretty good.
00:30:22.548 - 00:30:45.222, Speaker A: I want to thank every single person that supports what I do by collecting, sharing and liking. I love you all. Let's continue doing so. That's pretty good. I mean it just goes to show, putting out work every day as Flora has done, you know, being prolific has really been really beneficial for Flora. So a thousand tezos volume, that's great. And here's another 117 tezos.
00:30:45.222 - 00:31:10.610, Speaker A: I want a self sustainable life. And just again, these kind of surreal illustrations here. And it'll be interesting to see if the color scheme changes with each month here. And one of one and this I think was just listed or listed a couple of days ago. So this is still available. Interestingly, risetio edition of 20. Fragmented reality.
00:31:10.610 - 00:31:44.514, Speaker A: Taking inspiration from automatism within the surrealist movement, the series was created with little to no conscious thought. And again, this was Andre Breton's first definition of surrealism. I believe he called it pure psychic automatism. And this is the name of the series, automatism. Rosatio is playing with that first definition. The artwork was created by cutting and rearranging images that fall under CCO license, along with incorporating digital drawings. The background of the artwork is composed of a frame by frame animation.
00:31:44.514 - 00:32:02.064, Speaker A: So interesting. So there is actually some collagen here as Rosatio does. Some of that nice torn paper. A referenced torn paper. So very cool. From rosatio edition of 20. And there are twelve left for ten tezos.
00:32:02.064 - 00:32:34.600, Speaker A: A cool work by Uyo 66. And you know what was interesting about this? It was posted. I saw it on Instagram and I looked everywhere for it and I couldn't find it. And then. So I went to Uyo 60, six's foundation, or sorry, to their Twitter and then clicked on the link and it was foundation and it was in a collection. So I had gone to the foundation earlier and I couldn't see it, but it was in a collection. So all to say, when you put stuff in a collection on super rare foundation, it does tend to make it harder to find.
00:32:34.600 - 00:32:57.102, Speaker A: Anyways, this is called, I believe, is it hangover after party. So this would go well on in Berlin here. So there is a devil with alcohol and all sorts of fun being had here. Really nice work. I like the. The dimensions here, the ratio and just the vertical. It's very nice piece.
00:32:57.102 - 00:33:25.972, Speaker A: And just a nice composition. And even this kind of circular gradients in the background and these great, great stars here. So anyways, just a cool homage to the after party courtesy of Uyo 66. This always happens when the party has ended 0.3 ETH on foundation. A couple from Kota Nekazono and continuum number 80. And just interesting animations here.
00:33:25.972 - 00:33:43.972, Speaker A: And here's another one with some water flowing around it. So just fun work. From Koda Nakazono, continuum number 79. This is an addition of one. Let's just see what it sold for here. Accepted offer of 50. And let's just see here what happened.
00:33:43.972 - 00:34:08.544, Speaker A: And accepted offer of 50. Interesting. So did they go to the same person? They did. So now that person has a nice pair of images from Koda Nakazono. That pair really well together. Here's another one edition of eleven number 77, with some nice pixelation in here. So you just gotta love how this is kind of just avenue for experimentation here, this whole series, and trying different things.
00:34:08.544 - 00:34:43.236, Speaker A: And these sold for five on primary and then sold on secondary for ten. And here we are. So edition of eleven, continuum number 77, a new work from ego, demon ego. So let's just maximize, see if there's any sound. So kind of a video game vibe, as we can see here. Face the demons of a flower scented land. So interesting.
00:34:43.236 - 00:35:01.460, Speaker A: And let's see what happened here. Ten weeks with the most special nightmares. And buy for 150 tezos. Well, maybe that's on secondary. That's tuna. So it sold out on primary for 15, and that, again, was an addition of ten. So nice.
00:35:01.460 - 00:35:28.928, Speaker A: 150 tezos for demon ego. Interesting series. Very interesting series. And so different from those other kind of Sigmar polk, what seemingly inspired works. So, as we saw here, just very quickly, you know, been exploring. So this is okay, you know, because we saw all of these works over here, which are awesome. And, you know, back to the earlier point we were discussing here of doing different series.
00:35:28.928 - 00:35:53.708, Speaker A: So here's a different series, but you can see it's being tackled by demon ego consistently. Remember, Simone was bringing it up. So I think that's. I don't think it hurts you to do that. If anything, it shows range, because if demon ego only did one thing for the rest of his life. Some artists feel trapped by that because they get a gallery, and then the gallery goes, okay, well, you made your name on these works here. That's what we want.
00:35:53.708 - 00:36:25.832, Speaker A: We don't want any experimentation. So, in a sense, what you want to do, I would argue, as an artist, if you don't have a gallery, is you want to set the precedent that you do different series before you get a gallery. So that when you finally make a deal with your gallery or a gallery or several, they know what the score is, and there's no big surprise. It's like, listen, I do several different series I could try. And so there's kind of a benefit to setting that precedent. Before you actually sign with anyone, should you sign with anyone. Haiti Rockette.
00:36:25.832 - 00:37:03.580, Speaker A: A new Nintendo glitch rom. So interesting colors, kind of a blue green, kind of a darker look to it, and kind of a more minimal. You know, just, you know, it reminds me some of Haiti Rocket's Nintendo glitch roms are sometimes playing just with how little can you do? And it's kind of like, you know, I think one of them had a jet that just kind of flashed a little bit. Sometimes they can be quite minimal and almost impressionistic. And here you can see it's almost abstracted. So an interesting, what I'd call more minimal work from Haiti. Rocket edition of 21.
00:37:03.580 - 00:37:27.454, Speaker A: Sold for primary, I think, for 690 classic. A few more of these walkers from Francoise Gamma. So we saw the first two. Now we are seeing more experiments in this walk error series. So again, kind of glitch, suggest there's some glitching going on. So here is number three. Here is number four.
00:37:27.454 - 00:38:06.084, Speaker A: And those errors sure make, like, look at how great this is. Kind of reminiscent of the glitch roms, aren't they? So, you know, back to that, you know, idea from Warhol, which I keep repeating here. Embrace the errors, right? Embrace the mistakes, you know? So, yeah, and you see how great it is. Like, it's arguably way more interesting to have all these mistakes here than just the walking person. Right. Here's another one, walking error number five. And we just see more.
00:38:06.084 - 00:38:45.404, Speaker A: It looks like these have been glitched somehow, doesn't it? And I think it works out beautifully. So, interesting work from Francois Gamma, a new one from Gogolitis. Just a cool, fun work outrun by the virtual worlds. And there is a poem. Whenever I see a poem now, I'm wondering, did AI help create it? But in Gogolitis case, I assume not. But you never know. Anyway, it's just a cool pixel artwork turning these pixel art factories, which we can kind of see referenced in the background here, incorporating them into more of a representational kind of 3d work here.
00:38:45.404 - 00:39:13.524, Speaker A: So just kind of an interesting series. I think he's taking offers like the top offers very soon. So here they all are so far. And one for 28, there another for 21. So, anyways, nice frame, too. This framing thing is a pretty interesting, you know, thing that I'm seeing here, I think, because I think it actually adds a lot to these works. We see it with Tom bombadil, we see it with hasdrubal waffle.
00:39:13.524 - 00:39:56.044, Speaker A: It's an interesting kind of, for lack of better word trope or just thing to pay attention to. This is kind of a different kind of framing. So mech txt put a new workout. And what's interesting about what mech TXT does is he'll kind of put an image in the image. This is almost like the passepartout, you know, the paper that goes over top, but he'll incorporate the image, it bleeds over into it, and then he'll create this kind of frame, or this space, this limited space where he'll add other elements. So anyways, interesting colors. A living water by mech TxT and we see the clouds and the water kind of bleed into each other.
00:39:56.044 - 00:40:24.078, Speaker A: And we've got a run here. The hanged man by manital. So another gorgeous, gorgeous work. Probably made an aspirite because we saw manidal working in aspirite, the hanged man. And the colors are off the chart beautiful for this whole series, and that is not for sale yet, but it will be soon. So pretty cool. The hanged man, the 12th tarot card accepting a different viewpoint is symbolized by the hanged man accepting a differing viewpoint.
00:40:24.078 - 00:40:51.560, Speaker A: Generally speaking, the hanged man is about waiting for the appropriate moment, new perspectives and sacrifice. So we are learning the tarot here. Tombham battle. So here a black frame, but with a blue frame actually around that contrabandist. And so just another cool pixel artwork with these beautiful clouds here. And the kind of this, the basic dithering. I think this is number seven as far as the dithering is concerned.
00:40:51.560 - 00:41:06.802, Speaker A: Just kind of four x four. And here's another one which Tom bombadil loves. And carpet shop. So another kind of subject. It seems like an endless reservoir of subjects here. This time with the carpet shop. So very cool.
00:41:06.802 - 00:41:40.016, Speaker A: And continuing on by now, for eleven edition of 23, here's a 3d pixel artwork, a glitch tree furniture decoration for the metaverse. So how cool is that? Voxel art and pixel art and glitch GLB sculpted in VR AR VR interactive NFT GLB format. So a ton of tech going into this by Ivan Hugo, if I'm pronouncing that right, to buy for $2.55 edition of ten. Seven left. So you can add to your furniture in the Metaverse. And there's a little bug on it too.
00:41:40.016 - 00:42:02.070, Speaker A: So anyway, it's just interesting work. And Francois Gamma again, Toy X. And this almost looks like teletext or something, but I don't think it is. But it looks like a toy castle or something. So anyways, interesting. And also a super simple work, byte by bit, but interesting jazz. So this is part of a series.
00:42:02.070 - 00:42:42.982, Speaker A: And again, back to this idea of series, as long as they're done consistently. And we'll see here very quickly that Byte by bit has been experimenting with this series, and Byte by Bit has quite a few different series, the banner mania as long. And because Byte by bit has explored them consistently and doesn't really abandon the series, then it creates its own credibility. And it shows, if anything, he's not just the guy that does the pixel art, galaxies or nebulas. He does all sorts of stuff and it shows. Here's some existential who am I? Because now it's jazz. And so playing with different colors, making it more musical, one could argue.
00:42:42.982 - 00:43:14.740, Speaker A: So a one of one for ten tezos. And rustic digital art, speaking of experimentation, puts out a eight bidoo work. Ultra speed of the cropped Mario, it looks like with maybe some clouds, perhaps around it. Nice piece. Edition of 15 for two tezos and stippin pixel, these very interesting portraits of buildings at kind of three quarters, 45 degree angle, looking down. And so here is one edition of five for five tezos. And here is another one.
00:43:14.740 - 00:43:49.676, Speaker A: Prism for nostalgia. Same thing. Edition of five for five tezos. So just interesting experimentation there. And Elie Lo, kind of glitch trash. So another strange work by notable trash artist La Lowe. So.
00:43:49.676 - 00:44:14.700, Speaker A: And that is available. Let's just really quickly look here. So that is on secondary for 20, sold for 450. So the prices are going up for La low, I think deservedly, I mean, La Lowe started at like twenty cents, I think. So exmortal, a new one, PlayStation one. So it looks like a PlayStation that has been glitched out. So rotating in 3d.
00:44:14.700 - 00:44:32.426, Speaker A: Very cool edition of eight. And I think this sold out for five tezos each. And continuing on, acid soup with a couple of more, I guess. I guess you'd call it junk food. And here is a hot dog. And so anyways, very nice glitched out hot dog. I picked this up.
00:44:32.426 - 00:44:52.264, Speaker A: Glitch, hot dog. And also a glitch birthday cake. And thank you, acid soup. Who sent me one of these? So that is pretty cool. So I kind of like the junk food theme here, as we see. Let's see if it loads up. You know, you get the waffles, the pizza, the donut, the hamburger and all that stuff.
00:44:52.264 - 00:45:17.602, Speaker A: Again, a different series, you know, but it's done with consistency. So all good now, Louie, I wasn't sure what this was. I thought this was a gorgeous work. And, you know, you see this kind of circular. I don't know if it's AI. I don't know if it's like, you know, a filter put on top. I thought it was quite effective and kind of a moving still life.
00:45:17.602 - 00:45:45.154, Speaker A: And then I was confused by this over here. Is this Louis signature or is it someone else's? You know? So again, I wasn't sure what was going on here, but cool work. So I assume it's Louise, but I just don't remember seeing. I don't remember seeing Louis signature. So I'm not sure what's going on on that one. And, of course, we remember susan's technicolor dream here from the camp creme series. So that is the same artist.
00:45:45.154 - 00:46:09.774, Speaker A: Santiago, possible cell number one. So this is really interesting. Santiago seems to be using AI to make kind of, like, speculative scientific diagrams. Right? So possible cell number one, text to image tool, and gimp. I think these are fascinating. Okay, he had another one here. Fake science is my passion now.
00:46:09.774 - 00:46:27.430, Speaker A: I think this is really, really, really cool series. He also had some proteins that I don't think we've looked at. Really, really interesting from over here. So more AI, marina amadova. Games children play. This is with wizardcon. She did the art.
00:46:27.430 - 00:46:54.258, Speaker A: And anyway, so the twins are back, seemingly, and they're a cool kind of chess, you know, background and chess in the background. Chess set. And again, almost looking scientific there too. So anyways, interesting colors, too. Available for three tezos, edition of 50. Everlasting feminine composition number six. A couple of nice flower works from Marina Amidova, too.
00:46:54.258 - 00:47:22.830, Speaker A: So I wonder which this is. I'm not sure which mid journey this is using, but it makes you wonder. So here's another one. You almost wonder if it's four because it's more painterly, but I guess you can put in your prompt that you want it to be painterly. So composition number four, one of one, available for 50. And here is composition number five, edition of ten, available for five tazos. So very interesting here.
00:47:22.830 - 00:47:56.044, Speaker A: Cool work. And not a number. Dreamscapes number five. And I believe he tweeted out or not a number tweeted out that this work was made from, I think, a chat GPT, prompting chat GPT to make a prompt for, you know, either stable diffusion or mid journey, whatever the text to image tool was. A couple of works by Sky Goodman as we run through the rest of this here. Glow in the dark galaxy highs. So a couple of new sneakers.
00:47:56.044 - 00:48:19.220, Speaker A: So very cool combination of AI and other tools here. Part of the Lost Sneakers series. Sneakers created with AI. So very interesting. Here's another one. Just a nice sort of sneaker, again with just all sorts of crazy design elements here. Details.
00:48:19.220 - 00:48:31.100, Speaker A: So very interesting. Martian sunrise. Hi. Yeah, very interesting. Novel imagery from Sky Goodman over there. Here's Simone. So Simone Stumer on object.
00:48:31.100 - 00:48:46.864, Speaker A: So we're helping with discovery here. Just a cool series. Parking lots, parking in the middle of nowhere. Kind of almost a ballard vibe there. So parking lot number five. And I believe this is made with AI. Yes, AI.
00:48:46.864 - 00:49:04.782, Speaker A: A series of AI assisted artworks. So maybe some editing there. Parking lot number 13. This one's slightly more photographic. And I think we have another one here. Parking lot number seven. And so here you are.
00:49:04.782 - 00:49:30.380, Speaker A: So some different parking lots, courtesy of Simone Stumer. Edition of five tentezos. I thought this was quite a successful work by Bolin 132. This is not AI. This is collage and digital painting, but kind of fit really well with the AI. You see how the AI works are starting to bleed into the other works as I. At least for me, these things are starting to bleed into each other.
00:49:30.380 - 00:49:42.220, Speaker A: Collage, AI, all these things. I thought this was a beautiful work. One of one for seven. Pretty reasonable. Here's another one aging gracefully. A portrait of lived life. This is also by Bolin 132.
00:49:42.220 - 00:50:14.958, Speaker A: And this one is gone. So just interesting digital painting and collagen from Bolin 131. And a new headquarters from Zoom for two tazos here. And I love the last one. And I love this one. And I just love the subject matter of this series because we can all relate to it, or many of us. Not all of us, but put it this way, it's become the new office after the pandemic for so many people, and they're trying to get us back in the office out there, but I don't know if it's gonna work.
00:50:14.958 - 00:50:29.118, Speaker A: I don't think it will. Headquarters number two. So this is. Put it this way, this is a reality that a lot of people have. So an art of everyday life, Josh giddies. So this is physical. The last one was AI.
00:50:29.118 - 00:50:47.674, Speaker A: This is physical. And GM basketball heads. You can't beat us by working class. Zero nine. So Josh Geddes is posting a physical work, I think, or not. I'm not sure what's going on here. This looks like it's by working class, but then Josh giddies portrays this.
00:50:47.674 - 00:51:13.954, Speaker A: So I'm not exactly sure what's going on here. Like, who is the artist here? But it is too late in the day to find out here, guys. But I thought it was an interesting work. Whoever made it, we'll find out. And if someone leaves a message, if anybody knows, feel free to leave a comment, and I will make sure to announce that so we get the right person. Threesomes also put out a work which I thought was quite beautiful. Another trading card.
00:51:13.954 - 00:51:49.972, Speaker A: There is no filter on this, from what I understand. And just beautiful kind of sepias here and beautiful textures and nice combination of painting on a trading card. It really does seem to be going somewhere here with threesomes. Let's just look I mean, I think we've done. Yeah. And that great one with the threes. So kind of playing with this kind of monochromatic, kind of sepia textures here, but just very, very nice, you know, playing again with one kind of theme and just exploring it to the hilt.
00:51:49.972 - 00:52:08.752, Speaker A: So with all sorts of crazy work there. Daucente draws flamenco. So a physical work, and she is back. Flamenco, kind of mysterious work with what looks like someone with the balaclava, perhaps. I'm not sure what's going on here. Flamenco. Some robber.
00:52:08.752 - 00:52:34.252, Speaker A: Yeah, I was going to say it looks like a robber. Some robberies turn into dances. That is funny. So this is like a slow motion of a robbery, I would say, but you could argue it looks like two people dancing. Flamenco seems to be robbery dances is the name of the series. Are there any others? This one here. That's quite a brilliant series, isn't it? Cha cha cha.
00:52:34.252 - 00:52:51.324, Speaker A: So this person robbing this person in slow motion, but it's a dance. Brilliant. And Oli Azikovsky, inspired by Santiago is this account here. And I am following Santiago. That is just a Twitter glitch. And. Yeah.
00:52:51.324 - 00:53:15.964, Speaker A: So anyways, so people responding, as sky goodman was saying, we're having a conversation here. So now Ozzy Izakovsky is responding to Santiago, which is cool. A couple more physical works. Cape Mary art. I think this is stunning. This is off Instagram, oil, pastel on bar, available on my website. So just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
00:53:15.964 - 00:53:41.160, Speaker A: So much going on here and just the simplicity down here and the complexity up here, the two dimensionalness and, yeah, just this work is stunning. I'm a big fan of this artist. I guess that's her. Kate Mary. Great, you know, Instagram artist. How's she doing? Just in terms of like 50,000 followers? She's doing pretty well. So look at that.
00:53:41.160 - 00:54:07.740, Speaker A: And they just look stunning, don't they? Look at how great that looks. Painting and picks of 2022. So, yeah, that looks like the good life over there. So anyways, having fun out of Glasgow and interesting artist Steven Schwarzer, who we've also looked at. So just with a new work here. So it's interesting to, again, kind of contrast what we're seeing on Instagram here. There's so much talent out there now.
00:54:07.740 - 00:54:26.220, Speaker A: Steven Schwarzer, only 2500 followers. And like a pretty great artist. I'm pretty sure he has a gallery, though, interestingly. And here's another one by Bruno Miguel in 5000 followers here, just for interest's sake. And this series is totally awesome. I've been showing a ton of these. I just think they're beautiful.
00:54:26.220 - 00:54:37.564, Speaker A: Look at that. I think we saw this one. I mean, they're stunning. So maybe that's the artist there with pink hair. So, anyways, all good. All right. Thanks, everybody, for joining me.
00:54:37.564 - 00:54:38.404, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
