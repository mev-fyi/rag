00:00:04.280 - 00:00:37.754, Speaker A: I want the level of my volume on my phone to get louder. You know, it's funny, this is a tradscape track, and it's kind of lo fi when you hear it properly, but it almost sounds, like, perfect when you have it playing out of a phone into a microphone. So I've always done it that way. Another accidental, another happy accident, as Brian Eno and many other people have called them. Anyway, welcome back, everybody. Artist journal, May 11, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from a sunny, beautiful, almost summer like day here in Berlin, Germany.
00:00:37.754 - 00:01:00.254, Speaker A: Quick show note. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. That is your first quick show note. And quick show note. I'm going away, and I think in about a week, I think it's, I think, May 19. So in a week and a day, I will be going away. It is my brother's 50th birthday, so he's coming to Munich, and I'm gonna go to Munich and take a train there.
00:01:00.254 - 00:01:37.308, Speaker A: It's gonna be for a week, so I will likely, very likely be gone for about a week. So quick FYI, and big thank you to everybody that showed up to the Twitter space yesterday with Santiago. He is a loved person. Like, he is a loved person sometimes controversial, out there on Twitter. He has his detractors, but, man, there are a lot of people that love that guy. And anyways, it was an awesome, awesome spaces, big turnout, everything. So I uploaded that to Spotify and to YouTube.
00:01:37.308 - 00:01:55.124, Speaker A: So that is in the record now. And anyway, I look forward. As I was telling Santiago, we can do it again. If I'm still going in six months, which I imagine I will be, do it again. We'll do it again, if not sooner. So anyways, here, let's get to it. The editing is getting again.
00:01:55.124 - 00:02:14.932, Speaker A: I'm using big. I'm chopping stuff left, right, and center. So. And it's been going well so far. So anyways, check this out. This is what I want to show you. Do you realize what this is? Do you realize what this is? This is art matter up close, doing Zancan's work.
00:02:14.932 - 00:02:35.364, Speaker A: I mean, look at. We talk about texture here. And I'm terrible at managing these GLB files. I think that's what this is. But at least we can do well here. You can see the back, and there's even the certificate of authenticity. I don't know how to navigate and to, you know, see that properly, but we can still see this.
00:02:35.364 - 00:02:59.494, Speaker A: And you know what else I love? I mean, there's so much to comment on. There's so much to be excited about. But look at what looks like a dry marker. Maybe that's the charcoal. And we'll look at the description because this looks like a multimedia work. Okay, so this is, if you haven't figured it out yet, I'm sure everybody has. It's a physical artwork of a Zancan work.
00:02:59.494 - 00:04:26.274, Speaker A: And again, like, let's just get the, so they are selling this as a token, but it's basically to get the physical. So again, like, if I'm the contemporary art scene and I'm seeing this, I, you know, if I'm a gallery and I'm seeing this, I go, hmm, I just go, you know, that kind of puts a big question mark on the whole model. And I'm sure people are still going to want to go into galleries. But this, you know, what is their cost? What is the cost for art matter to have their physical gallery, they produce the work, you know, but that's a separate thing just to display it. I think it's zero. Maybe it costs like twenty cents to mint the token and then it's free to display on object where other people will see it who follow a social media network already set up for NFT and digital art and physical art delivery. So I mean, finally here is this a window, another window on the future that we're looking at here, because it seems to me in many ways not just the actual physicality of this digital work, which is, has all the beauty of a Rauschenberg, right, in terms of the mark making or, you know, pick your great artist.
00:04:26.274 - 00:04:58.464, Speaker A: You know, you know, I was going to say like Basilicz, I don't know if Basilicz is my favorite artist, but you know what I'm saying? Like, you just pick your favorite artists. That makes gorgeous textures. Look at these textures on the white. So anyways, here, I've been five minutes on this. Let's just see deeper. So again, this is organic matter, a series put together by art matter. There's art matter there and so is Ankan, a journey through art, technology and nature.
00:04:58.464 - 00:05:46.030, Speaker A: Nice combination. The NFT token represents the ownership of the physical artwork and can be confirmed via the NFC chip located within the physical work. This GLB file is a scanned image of the unique physical artwork, including the digital certificate of authenticity incorporated in the token. So that also solves the authenticity issue. And it sounds like it's kind of always there. It's kind of digitally confirmed, we could say. In collaboration with art matter and NFT collective, Zancane uses natural elements such as brushes and charcoal to create essential motifs.
00:05:46.030 - 00:06:48.780, Speaker A: So I wonder if this is the brush right here, this very beautiful work here. Is this the brush? And you wonder what the original was. Was the original just like a white? But then you put the right brush on and you get this gorgeous texture, right? So a real collaboration between art and technology. And we have to be real here when we look at the history of art again, like, what is the renaissance without the innovation of oil painting? What is impressionism without the innovation of, you know, portable tubed paints? Right? So, you know, technology and art, you know, I think it's undeniable. But shall we speculate and throw out a theory here are deeply intertwined. Look at screen printing, you know, the use of acrylic paint in the sixties and pop artists, right? I mean, it's. We see it over and over and over again.
00:06:48.780 - 00:07:37.936, Speaker A: Look at digital art now. So here, I mean, what's so interesting is we're coming from, you know, we started with physical back in say, the sixties, seventies, and before, and all the way before then we're making, then we've shifted over somewhat to where you have digital artists, but now it's coming back into the physical. And what's so interesting for me is this mark making that's made by this technology and by these mediums. There's a real, just kind of purity about it, you know? So I'm kind of back to art matter here. I mean, it's just, here's another one. Let's just zoom in here again. You see the same beautiful thing.
00:07:37.936 - 00:08:27.234, Speaker A: So maybe that's just like a white charcoal. It's totally possible here. But, you know, again, it's just something to marvel at here. And I can't help but think, you know, how many works that we're going to look at today for static works, I mean, dynamic, it's a little different if things are moving. But for static works, how many of those works could we just feed into the machine and, you know, come out with extraordinary poetic material results? I mean, again, I'm kind of on this pen plotter business here. It's, again, I'm just kind of like. And even look at this, the color.
00:08:27.234 - 00:09:04.004, Speaker A: I wish I could control this better. This is what I want to highlight here. See how the green background, like, you wonder, was that also painted by a machine? And even if it wasn't, you know, this is classic. Like, okay, we'll just put some green on top. Maybe it pooled a little bit over here so it's slightly darker, and that just creates its own poetry. Again, these kind of little, the randomness of the physical, shall we say, like that is ultimately, I think I've kind of distilled it here with a point that I'm trying to make here. Nine minutes in here.
00:09:04.004 - 00:09:52.182, Speaker A: The randomness of the physical has been infused into the digital here. And that, to me, takes the poetry that we are making digitally here, and then you can just kind of hyper charge it, supercharge it with the randomness of physical material, materiality, the accidental things that happen when you're working in the physical world. A natural contrast, we could argue, between the digital and the physical, the digitally perfect and the physical accidental. We are back in philosophy, my friends. So anyways, here is. And they're going for high prices. Look at this.
00:09:52.182 - 00:10:28.414, Speaker A: Recently sold. I would. I've already spent a long time on this so far, but look at. I mean, I want to look at that one, too. So I would encourage you, actually, dear viewer, take a look at this, because this art matter business, I hope, is coming for all of us. And I think we should be the first in line to be trying to get in line and, you know, use this and get on this, you know, even if it's just using basic pen plotters. Anyways, thank you very much to the collectors who picked up neuralink.
00:10:28.414 - 00:10:59.614, Speaker A: So that is based on a Elon Musk article who's trying to link brains directly to machines. This was for Chimasuku Jackson's show. He runs hologram gallery here. And just a big thank you to the collectors who picked up this work means a lot. And, yeah, I mean, you know, what's interesting as far as this is, you know, in the. Even though this is in the collaboration series, this is basically. I call this series stories.
00:10:59.614 - 00:11:42.304, Speaker A: And then within stories, I have the secret history of World War three. But when it doesn't have to do with geopolitics and whatever else, finance, if it's just. But, you know, maybe it fits into the secret history of World War three. Anyways, all to say I was using photographs of physical brushwork up until, you know, and then I stopped doing that because I felt like I hit a certain wall, like, of experimentation. And I was like, okay, how do I push this further? I was doing brush, like, physical paint, taking a picture, putting it into work. Those are the first, like, six. But what was interesting is now that I'm using mid journey now, and I'm starting to get these kind of painterly things, and I'm loving that.
00:11:42.304 - 00:11:53.328, Speaker A: So, anyway, so the experimentation continues. I continue to push with this series. I made another one today. I'm really excited. Or started another one, I should say. So. Anyways, thank you, everybody, for picking that up.
00:11:53.328 - 00:12:15.750, Speaker A: And thanks to Chimasuku Jackson for the invite of this group show here. And here you can see Koda Nakazono crush purple drank. That work was also part of it. Another crush. And so anyways, so this show is starting to come up here. That is hologram gallery on object. So check that out again.
00:12:15.750 - 00:12:36.516, Speaker A: Big thank you to everybody involved. Just a couple of comments here. Some really nice comments. I agree with you and rosatio from human boy vibes. The musings and ponderings and deep dive learning sessions are a wonderful addition to knowing the why of what is going on. I have ended up learning a lot, and the artist toolbox is never full. Great episode.
00:12:36.516 - 00:13:06.286, Speaker A: Thank you, human boy. And, yeah, like, it's kind of like, that's how this kind of show started a lot. And, you know, this show is always kind of a work in progress. Again, it's the pirate ship that's being built in the sky. You know, I was gonna say quite literally, but not quite literally, but all to say, it's kind of an ongoing work in progress. So, yeah, I mean, that's always kind of been. The idea is there's always kind of, you know, if we need to, you know, as I did way back when with, say, rat cloak.
00:13:06.286 - 00:13:49.722, Speaker A: See, we start off with some rimbode, you know, just to. It's always good to just kind of always feed ourselves with the tradition and everything. Again, I just think it gives, you know, beyond feeding our brains and giving us inspiring ideas. Most importantly, I think it just builds credibility, too, in what we're doing and reminds us of, you know, the bigger picture out there, the bigger tradition that we're a part of, whether we realize it or not. And it's always better to realize what we're a part of. And also, thank you to retro Manny. The two pack piece, Boziah's crucifixion was referencing the now infamous artwork from the Don Kiluminati, the seven day theory, his final album before he died.
00:13:49.722 - 00:14:07.982, Speaker A: I feel like I should know that, but I just don't have a ton of knowledge. So thank you for the context there. Great show. Thank you and awesome. I'm glad to hear you're expanding your horizons, Stulka. And shout out to DJ Kiro and Hercules. Awesome to hear from you, that great artist who does the computers.
00:14:07.982 - 00:14:46.122, Speaker A: Anyways, a lot of great comments there, and also from RJ online. Love the direction this show is going at the moment. Great to see some cultural theory and philosophy being given substantial space, especially at this moment when so many artists here are so heavily embedded in so many new frontiers. I'm glad to hear that. So, yeah, whenever it comes up, like, you know, you don't want to be pretentious about it where I'm, like, doing it and. But I think, like, when the opportunity comes up, it's like then we go in that direction and we explore it a bit. And I do plan to come back to, you know, Baudrillard and simulation as it in all these things.
00:14:46.122 - 00:15:20.694, Speaker A: Like, I'm sort of right now, I don't think we'll have anything on it today unless I surprise myself while I'm doing this. But now we can let it sink in a little bit, right? And then maybe in two weeks, we come back, and then we come back with a little bit more of a foundation, and then we start to build again. Who knows where we are in six months? Should we all still be here? And I don't see why. At least I shouldn't. So, anyways, thank you for the encouraging comments from RJ, a great artist, Lorna Mills. I can confirm that you got my process pretty much right. Thank you.
00:15:20.694 - 00:15:56.316, Speaker A: So we were talking about Lorna Mills, and we have a couple of Lorna Mills actually, in this show, again, using the marquee tool and the selection tool. So that is confirmed from another great artist in this scene. And here's another one. Great conversation. And this was actually referring to a work that I was saying that maybe axin a couple of shows ago, maybe he used AI, he didn't use AI. And here it is, by the way, that GiF has no AI treatment. I use AI in irl job only.
00:15:56.316 - 00:16:18.584, Speaker A: Cheers. So that is cool. So the GiF that we're looking at, no AI. So kind of big correction on that one because I thought maybe there was some AI involved there. Speaking of AI, I thought this was kind of topical for us. Let me see if I can make this bigger. Google will label fake images created with its AI.
00:16:18.584 - 00:16:47.118, Speaker A: So Google is coming out very strong with AI. So I think they're partnering with Adobe with, I believe it's called Firefly, the AI that's coming out of Adobe. So Google will. I'm just going to read a couple of points here. Google will embed information called a markup inside images created by its AI models. So basically, there's going to be some markup in the code that will warn people it was originally created by a computer. And here's the quote.
00:16:47.118 - 00:17:24.214, Speaker A: Image self labeled as AI generated, reads one example warning provided by Google. You'd think they just put AI generated, but image self labeled as AI generated. That almost sounds like it was made by AI. The move is the most significant effort by a big technology company to label and classify output from so called generative AI. So it's just kind of interesting to see this kind of. Kind of how this is getting rolled out, you know, in terms of the society at large. Speaking also of AI, guess who was in vogue Italia? So strange thing.
00:17:24.214 - 00:18:04.578, Speaker A: I mean, strange thing. I mean, again, a testament to this space and to the power of harnessing new technology and running with it. Like, strange thing has done. We have witnessed. I mean, we've seen with axin, too, going from, you know, selling well on object to going, like, making tens and tens and tens of thousands of dollars, right? And just like, having. Really, having a professional, you know, making more money than a lot of professional, quote, unquote, professional artists in the contemporary art world who are actually, like, not doing bad. Like, you know, so.
00:18:04.578 - 00:18:32.230, Speaker A: And not that money is the only measure here, but it is a measure of success. It is a measure. And here, vogue Italia, like, I mean, strange thing, was in vogue business, which was impressive before, but this is a whole other order of magnitude. This isn't vogue business. This is vogue Italia. And they did a whole profile when artificial intelligence imagined sportswear in the Renaissance. The interview with strange thing.
00:18:32.230 - 00:19:08.834, Speaker A: So that is pretty rad, to quote hasdrubal waffle, and they even collaborated here on a birth of Venus variation. So how cool is that? The artwork of strange thing made exclusively for Vogue Italia. So check out strange things. Massive Instagram. Like, I think I saw that go from, like, 2000, maybe less, to 66,000 followers. So, I mean, strange thing is just really doing well here. So you gotta love it.
00:19:08.834 - 00:19:30.736, Speaker A: Kwon do. I should practice my italian and read this in Italian. So, anyways, excited to share that I've been interviewed by Vogue Italia and collaborated with them to offer my unique interpretation of Botticelli's masterpiece, the birth of Venus. Grateful for the opportunity. Thank you, Julia at Vogue. So this is awesome. I mean, and I don't see this stopping.
00:19:30.736 - 00:19:49.520, Speaker A: And here's the piece. Look at that. We could have started with this, too, you know. This is awesome. So, anyways, it's just really great to see and just, like, super duper cool, you know, you just gotta love it. And look at that. Vogue times strange thing.
00:19:49.520 - 00:20:04.562, Speaker A: So an awesome collaboration here. Let's just give this a retweet here. So that is just rad. And I had to add this in. I don't know if I've ever met Mark Ferniho. I don't think so. But he's a friend, a very close friend of a couple of friends of mine.
00:20:04.562 - 00:20:25.154, Speaker A: Like, I think we. Like, I think we are friends on Instagram. Like, a very close friend of a few. Like, I may have even met him, but I don't think I have. But I've heard a lot about him over. Anyways, guess who's in Vogue Italia is Mark Berniot. And so he has some project that he was doing, my Berlin contemporary dancer project featured on Vogue, and I just had to share this.
00:20:25.154 - 00:21:05.152, Speaker A: That's hilarious. So I don't know if it's the same issue, but it's great when your friends are ending up in vogue Italia or very close friends of friends, etcetera. So, anyways, big congrats to Mark Fernio. That is awesome. So just on the AI front, Mister shapeless with a little bit of R and D research and development. Recently, I started to think about new ways to prompt and discovered this tool. It's reverse prompting tool that allows you to quote, unquote, unprompt any image and translate it to native stable diffusion mid journey language model.
00:21:05.152 - 00:21:21.194, Speaker A: I will share some examples below. Let me know what you think. And here's the link. And I actually brought it up here. So here it is. So you drop the image here, and here's the prompt. And so, anyways, this looks like it's well worth experimenting with.
00:21:21.194 - 00:21:56.062, Speaker A: I mean, we were talking about the reverse prompting before. I've used it just on, what do they call it? Describe. Describe on mid journey, and I didn't find it very helpful. You know, I'd put in, say, a Rauschenberg, or I'd put in a Picasso, and then I'd say describe and then get the prompt, and then put that back into mid journey, the text, and it didn't really look like the text that was coming out. So I wonder if this is just a better version of that artwork. Magnum, choose day motivation. And on.
00:21:56.062 - 00:22:16.930, Speaker A: And here. Okay, so source image number one, and then outputs number two to four. So maybe it uses this to get the text, I'm guessing. And then this is what you end up with. Interesting. Look at that. I mean, that almost reminds me of Google deep dream from 2015.
00:22:16.930 - 00:22:47.490, Speaker A: I mean, this is quite, quite an image here. I mean, this looks like a very advanced movie poster or even like Star wars. Right, the Star wars movie poster, where it's kind of got a whole. The whole movie is almost kind of in one image to a certain degree. Another interesting with some great textures there. So barely poetic here down here with this pink kind of small, you know, guy at a stampede, you know, riding a bull or a horse or something. Pretty interesting.
00:22:47.490 - 00:23:14.134, Speaker A: So here's another one. So anyways, I've been doing well at keeping the show short, so I'm going to. So there you go. So that is just something huggingface code. And so anyways, you can see, I'm going to retweet that. So if you want to find it, just go to my feed or mrshapeless's feed. I have just retweeted that Dan control with just an interesting comment.
00:23:14.134 - 00:24:40.100, Speaker A: The difference between my works on ETH and those on Tez is that taken individually, the ETH pieces have their own value and power, while those in tezos, I see them more as a journey, like a diary, precisely as a collection and therefore altogether an example. Still life and all animals. So this is interesting, right? Because I think, you know, it's something I've mentioned here many times that usually, you know, as an artist, when you see a different blockchain, it almost inspires a different kind of work. Like if I was to work on Solana, I'd kind of want something fairly polished or, I don't know, but it would give it, it has its own feel. And then Tazos, you know, that's where I, like, I feel, say, working with a pixel art sketchbook, as I call it, on Tazos, it makes perfect sense for me. But I don't know if that would make a ton of sense on Ethereum, weird as that might sound, right, because it's their sketches, they're, you know, it's having fun, it's experimenting, it's testing things. So anyways, that's, you know, it's another way of putting it is, you know, we used to say, or I used to say here, you know, you know, you put your big oil painting masterpiece on ETH and then maybe you put your more experimental stuff or just trying things out, other kinds of series, you know, on, you know, on objects.
00:24:40.100 - 00:25:20.224, Speaker A: So both, you know, working multi chain has tons of advantages here. And so, dancontrol, just interesting comment. I want to share. And this is regarding the ETH and gas fees, Jrny Crypto, who's kind of a big NFT guy and kind of youtuber from, especially from 2021. We need a solution to ETH gas fees before the next bull run. Gas fees alone price out most of the world on crypto and nfts, we can't have true mass adoption when a single digital transaction costs more than a full tank of real gas. And I just wanted to highlight this because I think, you know, Junior is absolutely right.
00:25:20.224 - 00:26:08.236, Speaker A: That's again, like, I don't hear anybody else saying this, but again, I'll never forget that interview with Gavin, who actually, I believe, put the programming language together for Ethereum, who's now behind Dot. At the end of an interview he was saying like, we want it where you don't even, can't even tell you're using crypto. Like it's just kind of like web application type stuff and where you can have it where there are no fees. So that's why I'm still continue to kind of have my eye on dot. Any NFT platform over there because I don't know any other blockchain. And I'm sure maybe, I'm sure people out there are way more knowledgeable than I am on this. But I don't know any other blockchain that has that in the roadmap.
00:26:08.236 - 00:26:31.168, Speaker A: Just zero fees. Maybe it was Internet computer, but I don't know enough about it. I think I heard that they also might not have fees, but this seems like a bit of an issue. And I love Ethereum and all these things. And I have all my, most of my, you know, big grand oil paintings are on, quote unquote are on ETH. So, you know, I love this stuff. I love ETH and all this stuff.
00:26:31.168 - 00:27:11.296, Speaker A: But all to say though, I think Junior, and I think Junior does as well, but I think he brings up a really just kind of a crucial point. I thought we just got an upgrade like eight months ago and now we're kind of back to these high gas fees. So how do you scale, I guess they say L2. And so we'll see how that all plays out. But I think no gas fees is probably where this all ends up because whoever cracks that code is going to win, I would argue, or is going to have, like, that's just a different kind of product. Anyway, this is more of an art journal than a blockchain journal, but I thought it was worth mentioning. You can probably guess who this is.
00:27:11.296 - 00:28:06.510, Speaker A: Demon ego. And I just wanted to show you how demon ego was working physically here. You know, this is kind of a really cool technique. I mean, it reminds me of those Warhol silk screens from the, I think the late seventies Mick Jagger where he would cut out colored paper and then just put it, you know, just glue it almost randomly and then screen print over top. Again, that whole technique of doing random underneath and then putting something structured over top and creating that natural contrast, that's why it looks so beautiful, because it's such a hard contrast. Well, I see a variation or an echo, shall we say, of that, where it looks like demon ego is just kind of cutting out some, you know, some similar shaped things, and let's say, okay, we'll call them an ear, but we'll just cut out a few, and then we'll just start putting them on and then draw on top. I think this is just really cool and beautiful and interesting.
00:28:06.510 - 00:28:59.330, Speaker A: So I just wanted to show that GM from demon ego just really cool. I mean, kind of a window into demon ego's process, too, which is quite sophisticated. Speaking of sophisticated, Kristen Roost, new weaving in progress. So I never get tired of seeing new shots of these beautiful again, back to traveling through the mediums, back to, you know, taking, as we started this show here, taking a digital work and putting it into the physical world. And here we have the accidental of physical reality, you know, and so it just becomes. And you almost have, you know, like, you know, how these things kind of color cycle. I think if we were to see this work on a computer, it'd probably be moving almost this weaving here in the way that there's kind of like this black thread that goes across it almost creates that echo of kind of movement and whatnot.
00:28:59.330 - 00:29:49.988, Speaker A: So anyway, it's just beautiful to see new weaving in progress. And this was interesting, too. I thought it was interesting in its simplicity, as far as I understand this, some new dot matrix prints on the way. So I thought this was quite brilliant, because you see what this is, this is an old printer. So I think that's just, like, super, really interesting, not only using, like, old software, but using old printers. And there's something kind of brilliant about this because, of course, an old printer, as you can see, the ink is starting to run out, the accidental, you know, aspects of physical working in physical materials. So we would used to think of this as super low fi.
00:29:49.988 - 00:30:16.722, Speaker A: So a brilliant innovation. I don't know if Kristen Roos is the first to do this. I assume other people have done this before, but I've never even thought of that or seen it, but I kind of love it. And, I mean, it must be hard to manage these old printer, this old printer technology. Anyways, I gotta run faster here, so. Remy Fork. Glad I finally tried white ink on black paper with the pen plotter.
00:30:16.722 - 00:30:28.534, Speaker A: So interesting. White ink on black paper. Axi draw is really addictive. I can't stop drawing well. I can imagine. So, here we go. Let's just open this in a new tab.
00:30:28.534 - 00:31:05.002, Speaker A: So again, I mean, I'm kind of back to this pen plotter business. Looks fantastic, doesn't it? So I have to get one of these things. And look, she has it on Etsy for sale, 200 ionosphere. You know, 200. So just very cool, right? Like, I mean, very cool. And here is some more work by Remy Fort, pointillism. And just to give you some background on what she's doing here, this artwork was generated by a python script I designed and made in my studio in Lyon, France.
00:31:05.002 - 00:31:30.720, Speaker A: In France in 2023. And what I love about it is this kind of randomness here. So it kind of has the feeling of a human accident or just this accidental stuff going on here. So pretty interesting. Made with code and then pen plotted. I mean, this is all. To me, this is incredibly exciting and super sophisticated.
00:31:30.720 - 00:31:49.764, Speaker A: So I am incredibly excited by this whole situation. And here is Remy Fort's object. So all sorts of stuff going on here. So I assume it's other. That's really cool. So I assume this is other code. And it sounds like she just started using the pen plotter.
00:31:49.764 - 00:32:04.694, Speaker A: So anyway, pretty awesome. So onto images here. So this is. You could probably guess who this is. Tokyo love. Sold for an ETH 50. So about $3,000 to GZ just a few days ago, May 8.
00:32:04.694 - 00:32:29.230, Speaker A: And this was listed on May 4. I don't think we saw it. Great vibe. You can see x copy here. There you go. See the xcopy collab. So really, really cool.
00:32:29.230 - 00:32:50.540, Speaker A: The music is awesome too. You gotta love the vibe. I mean, it's kind of back to the. Kind of the. There's generally a bit of the NFT space for me, feels a little bit more kind of more youthful and optimistic relative to the contemporary art world to a certain degree. There's just kind of a fun playfulness. Anyways, really beautiful colors.
00:32:50.540 - 00:33:11.684, Speaker A: Great work. Akihabara, Tokyo 2023 music by Memoryx Memories so really cool. Ozpren royal flush. Look at this. 100 of 100 prices, 74 tezos. So of course we remember the video camera and other retro technology. The Silk road work.
00:33:11.684 - 00:33:28.404, Speaker A: And so anyways, some cards. Really cool animation here and their totally unique style. And let's just see what happened here if it's. Yeah. Sold for only 15, actually. And it looks like broke zero x. Must have bought like half of them.
00:33:28.404 - 00:33:53.084, Speaker A: Anyway, very cool. Royal flush from Osborne. And you can probably guess who this is as well. This is Guion arts. So I'm not sure I've seen this work before. So them doing coffee and so anyway, just cool, we have a map and of course you see the pixelation in the background and a static work here. And just a really nice treatment of the cat there.
00:33:53.084 - 00:34:08.626, Speaker A: Everything. There's some turtles. Beautiful style here. So really cool work from Goyeong Arts. And here's guru, guru Hyena, an edition of one. Let's just see what this sold for. For only 888.
00:34:08.626 - 00:34:39.574, Speaker A: I mean, this looks like really cool web art, doesn't it? And here's like a Firefox reference. Etherscan gas fees tazos, you know, just a portrait of the culture. Really gas too high, right? 420 lafg. So anyways, just a tribute to the culture here. Very cool works. Sold for a song so immalaise high. Owe too much gas fees on ETH.
00:34:39.574 - 00:35:00.484, Speaker A: Here is tazos clean nfts. So a bit of a homage to tezos. So here is Lorna Mills. And again, another nature work. I just saw this on her twitter. Gotta love the color and everything. Nice, kind of happy go lucky concept, you know, so it's almost like, feels like someone spinning around in a forest or, you know.
00:35:00.484 - 00:35:19.988, Speaker A: Yeah. So anyways, just a beautiful work. And here's another one. Not so happy go lucky unlicensed suit. So interesting title of what looks like a volcano. So again, this kind of nature series, very cool. It's just a beautiful, super interesting take on nature.
00:35:19.988 - 00:35:41.184, Speaker A: And you gotta love the matte black. It's not like you can see the difference in the blacks here. This is a very light black or matte black is what I'd be tempted to call it. Like an euxine type of black here. Right? Interesting to use that with this, you know, cloud suit that kind of covers things. So anyways, edition of 32 for 15. There are 24 left.
00:35:41.184 - 00:36:19.812, Speaker A: Really cool work by Kappin with explainer gallery. Promised land beyond the peaks of price swing. So here we can see a chart of probably financial markets, probably crypto chart here and then mirrored by the mountain landscape here. So just really nice work by Kappn, who has been doing a ton of really nice work and kind of working with this gradients that kind of flow through the work here. Color gradients. A hilarious work by hasdrubal waffle. 1900 get wolf dirty talk live with Wolf blitzer $1.79
00:36:19.812 - 00:36:29.940, Speaker A: a minute. Xxx adults only. Hot, hot, hot. Anything goes. Wolf waiting call now. 1900 get wolf the real situation room. So an addition of three.
00:36:29.940 - 00:36:49.370, Speaker A: Pretty hilarious by hasdrubal waffle. Really nice treatment. I like the old phone here. That is really great and everything. So anyways, I love it. What did this sell for except offers of 818? Yeah. So anyway, really cool work.
00:36:49.370 - 00:37:02.472, Speaker A: Haiti Rockette. Don't panic. Interesting work here. Kind of a meme kind of style or whatever Haiti does here. Don't panic. Just kind of a cool work. I think Haiti is working.
00:37:02.472 - 00:37:29.664, Speaker A: This is another one, I think, with deluxe paint. Because you see Amiga 1200, I almost wonder if it's dpaint.org dot. I still. I need to figure out how to use the gradients here, these kind of cycling gradients here. I'd be very late to the party. I really like actually, this kind of tension, though, say the red squares kind of checkerboard at the top, which is static with all this moving, you know, gradients here, cycling gradients.
00:37:29.664 - 00:37:49.704, Speaker A: There's something kind of really interesting about that. So anyways, cool experimentation, cool abstract from Haiti, Rockette. And here's another one. How much was that? Only 37. I mean, not bad, actually. This one, I guess the Kurt hussle collective priced that one. Let me just look.
00:37:49.704 - 00:38:12.284, Speaker A: Yes, Kurt hussle at 1997. Anyways, here's another one, black and white. So again, you recognize this software from, I think Kristen Roose uses it. Definitely. Sabato, who's awesome. Milk and cookies, we're going to look at in a second here. And so we saw it also just the other day, I think it was human kernel, I think Santiago de paint.
00:38:12.284 - 00:38:35.200, Speaker A: So anyways, very. Just interesting experimentation there. And here is milk and cookies, chrome period drawings. And maybe we are. We already looked at this, didn't we? I sometimes get confused on this. So this is deluxe paint four on an emulated amiga 1200 computer. I think we already looked at this.
00:38:35.200 - 00:39:00.664, Speaker A: Sometimes I get confused when we have a couple of days off. Anyways, we can look at it again if we haven't looked at it. I think we did because I was wondering what kind of cookies those were. And they are biscuit sandwich cookies over here. So anyways, continuing on the side hustle. This is pixel nachos made with also retro software. And so this is GraphX two.
00:39:00.664 - 00:39:27.848, Speaker A: And so just more experimentation from kind of mixing abstract with a little bit of representational here. Just some stairs going into a portal or into a castle of sorts. So interesting experiment here. Addition of six, four left at five tezos side hustle. And this came out on object one. So they have come out after a pretty. After a pretty significant hiatus, a couple of months at least.
00:39:27.848 - 00:39:38.264, Speaker A: Or a month at least. They have put out some new work. A beautiful work here by. I believe this is pixelfool. Let's just double check. But anyways, just kind of a fun. Again.
00:39:38.264 - 00:39:56.984, Speaker A: We're kind of back to that fun of the NFT space. Almost that optimism. Output zero and or output oh, pixel full. Yes. So 180 frames, 256 colors, fairly large. And do we have any bits on it? Let me see if we can figure that out. Info.
00:39:56.984 - 00:40:15.284, Speaker A: Okay, let's just go to their homepage here. So this is on the homepage somewhere. Explore artworks. So this is. Here we go then. There's another one here. I think that's by Koldy, but yeah.
00:40:15.284 - 00:40:36.332, Speaker A: Anyway, so I don't see a history here. So I don't think any bids yet. So they are continuing to do stuff on object one. Spagelsmaskine. In the closet is the series and the work is called case. And here you see kind of a. It's another one of these red and black works.
00:40:36.332 - 00:40:55.560, Speaker A: And here, watch the flashing here. I'll keep it brief. With the skeleton in a briefcase, which is kind of interesting subject sold for 1.1 ETH. So spoogles maskinen is doing excellent. And here's a work by horomox. Kind of a cool kind of in that it's kind of.
00:40:55.560 - 00:41:29.344, Speaker A: I like the roughness, let's put it this way. And I think there's. The Eiffel Tower is being combined with a building. Just kind of interesting work from horror mocks horo Mox Eiffel Tower and the Tower of hope edition of one for 50 tezos here. Interesting kind of question marks in the background and everything. And continuing on we have manital quiet moment for half a soul. And there are 17 left.
00:41:29.344 - 00:41:53.182, Speaker A: So still lots of these left with the cat figure looking at a mermaid and help in a wanted poster on the wall. Just cool pixel art from manadal with beautiful colors as usual. Interesting concept. I wonder if this. This must be a submarine. You can see like the Ui over there running through this ex mortal. I actually last dance here.
00:41:53.182 - 00:42:10.484, Speaker A: Sounds like someone was listening to men without hats. We can dance if we want to. We can leave this world behind if you know men without hats. I call them Canada's craftwork. That is my take on. I love men without hats. I think they were actually, you know, Canada did not celebrate men without hats as they should.
00:42:10.484 - 00:42:29.004, Speaker A: Even still one of the great bands to come out of Canada. Ivan there for men without hats. So anyways, a work that's celebrating men without hats. I had to celebrate here. Cool work. Exmortal edition of 15. And it looks like sold out.
00:42:29.004 - 00:42:57.988, Speaker A: So someone out there likes men without hats at five tezos each and sold out pretty quickly too. So that's awesome work by Eli Lowe. Scary work by Eli Lowe. So another tarot card. So very cool. Kind of a glitchy tarot kind of trash art sort of thing. Available for 451 left from La Lowe boardme social club.
00:42:57.988 - 00:43:29.410, Speaker A: Three wise men and so kind of a. I like this work. I think my favorite part of the work was the Aldi logo here, three wise men. So, you know, vaguely I'd say a reference to, you know, the birth of the nativity, the birth of Jesus. But maybe this is also like, I almost feel like this is some hip hop album that I might not know of. Another reference I might not know because it kind of feels that way. Look at that leg sticking out.
00:43:29.410 - 00:44:18.094, Speaker A: Kind of a horror sort of feeling to this one. It looks like a hand maybe missing there. Board me, social club rosacea with a really cool kind of different kind of work, light background and kind of like a wild bug here with the eyes. And I like this over here too, with the sun setting seemingly, or a moon setting or sun setting couple of eyes and then this nice kind of border here. Very nice to look at metamorphosis. So maybe a kafka reference because it looks like a bug and maybe this person is a bug and things are getting darker, right? So maybe that's waking up from an unsettling dream by now. For 20 tezos, that's on secondary, sold out on primary for ten, continuing on Kappa Sage, the new age.
00:44:18.094 - 00:44:43.038, Speaker A: Cool work. I really like this work. I like the title. I like every like, I like the strange composition. This is really interesting work here. Like, again, if I saw this as an oil painting in a contemporary art gallery or acrylic, pick your medium. I go, this is pretty modern, you know, this is like, I've never seen a composition like this before.
00:44:43.038 - 00:45:04.906, Speaker A: And here we have some cool shoes and everything. Even the hat and everything. The background, textured background. I like this a lot. You know, the youth of the new era, the new artists, the poor, the new rich. Like, there's just a lot going on in this work. There's a lot going for this work.
00:45:04.906 - 00:45:31.584, Speaker A: Still available on primary for 340. So pretty reasonable price there. And here's supepe by the myth, 2023 edition of 20. And so it looks like the Mike Tyson figure mixed with Pepe. And so anyways, interesting take on the clouds. Interesting take on the clouds there. So let's just see what happened here.
00:45:31.584 - 00:45:48.712, Speaker A: Sold out for ten tezos on primary. And so there you go. Yeah. Rat cloak. See? Isolationist murlacos. I mean, myth brings everybody out. Roerich Wailu, you know, flexosaurus, bezaya, bursektor, Hasdrubal Waffle, Mikey Wilson.
00:45:48.712 - 00:46:02.952, Speaker A: I completely missed this one. I saw it on Twitter after the fact. So anyways, now you have to pay 45 tezos if you want that one. And here's an artist I don't think we've seen before. De taste. An artist must die. The final piece, the sacrifice, the crucifixion.
00:46:02.952 - 00:46:31.964, Speaker A: I thought, just an interesting composition here again, kind of a horror work. I looked at their page and I'll show it to you in a second. And here's a phone with some blood and kind of a murakami flower there and some kind of really nice camouflage, like a very interesting visual work here. Again, interesting concept and title. Edition of ten for three tazos. Seven left, so lots left. I was wondering to myself, this kind of has a board me social club feel to it.
00:46:31.964 - 00:46:58.330, Speaker A: I'm wondering, is this the same artist my inner sleuth is asking, if not just their own thing? And that's great. Give them a follow. Cool work. And of course, Gabriel Tesoarev with another kind of cool digital painting here, Chiffon Sando. And this came out on May 1, so I missed this one. So anyway, I'm a huge fan of this artist and all these works here. And let's see if you can still get it on.
00:46:58.330 - 00:47:11.828, Speaker A: Primaries. Three tezos, 15. None have sold. Is that right? None have sold. I might have to pick one of these up. A great artist here. Look at how great that bowl is and everything.
00:47:11.828 - 00:47:32.012, Speaker A: I'm gonna pick one of these up. You know, sometimes it's worth picking up those works that nobody buys, because once in a while the artists will just like burn the rest of them to thank that person. So that's happened to me before. A few times, actually. Quilanina. Yeah. So don't let no sales throw you off as a collector.
00:47:32.012 - 00:47:58.064, Speaker A: Social proof is an illusion, my friends. Quila Nina with procreate here, a work in procreate so often works physically with acrylic does these great. What I'd consider kind of visionary or mystical paintings out of Argentina and Peru, if I remember right. And so here's. She's been doing some full on digital works in procreate. Here's another one. Interesting use of procreate.
00:47:58.064 - 00:48:25.604, Speaker A: Hey, look at these great clouds. Look at this. You know, northern light sky almost. Anyway, just really, really interesting artist here. Procreate 2023 Midnight dream. Kind of feels like an Henri Rousseau reference, doesn't it? Here is Axtone, and I'm a big fan of these kind of works too. Gloomtube has a work where it's just kind of like, it's almost like a sticker collection.
00:48:25.604 - 00:48:58.426, Speaker A: There are other artists who have done this too. I like this whole trope of kind of just putting a bunch of illustrations because, I mean, you can find Basquiat has used this as well, you know, just drawings across and little kind of doodles all across to create a composition. So it's a cool way of making a work. So cool work from Axstone on Twitter there and here, Daniel W. Who's going to be on our next Twitter spaces that is scheduled. Everything goes according to plan. So here are some cool works by Daniel W.
00:48:58.426 - 00:49:18.106, Speaker A: That have just come out. Very excited about that really cool artist. So this is called rot. And this is an edition of 15 for five tezos. And here you see rebirth with what looks like mushrooms coming out here. And let's just hit play. So pretty nice animation here.
00:49:18.106 - 00:49:45.816, Speaker A: It's pretty interesting. Like you could just use different stages of the drawing being finished, you know, where you haven't filled in all the blacks to when it is all filled in, and then you turn that into a gif. It's a nice animation. Continuing on, Mister Shapeless, face of the future. Another really cool face from Mister Shapeless here. It feels like it's going somewhere. Mister shapeless, very interesting.
00:49:45.816 - 00:49:58.842, Speaker A: Cool, nice composition. So I like the star here. So just really cool use of AI here. Went for 50 tezos. Pretty reasonable for a one of one from Mrshapeless. Sold in 25 minutes. Very cool.
00:49:58.842 - 00:50:16.014, Speaker A: Here's Venta with another one. Social contagion. And this is going for eight tezos, edition of ten. And kind of a surrealist looking work here. Kind of feels very 3d modeled and everything kind of plasticine esque. Really cool clouds in the background there. I love it.
00:50:16.014 - 00:50:33.032, Speaker A: I just love it. Just all these kind of body parts flying, flowing into each other. Social contagion. Menta times AI. Seven left at eight tezos each. And back to strange thing. Check out this collection in the arctic circle AI.
00:50:33.032 - 00:50:58.602, Speaker A: Faux fur fashion concepts for those still in colder climates. So this is pretty rad. I mean, I mean, very powerful images from strange thing. And you know what I also like, like, strange thing didn't just stick. He could have stuck with just the oil painting textures. But here he's going on like full on photography. So again, not getting too comfortable always, but.
00:50:58.602 - 00:51:20.166, Speaker A: But still almost recognizably strange thing at the same time. And I mean, just great concepts here. So very cool use of AI here by strange thing. Very cool. Beautiful background color there too. The orange. The color is outstanding.
00:51:20.166 - 00:51:36.238, Speaker A: You wonder where. How, like, look at how harmonized the color is in these. This is very cool. Very nice work. That looks like a GI Joe, like Cobra commander or something with like a fur coat. This is CGI, I think. See, that says CGI.
00:51:36.238 - 00:51:57.156, Speaker A: Computer landscape zero two, enter the portal. So this is by Kramer. So just kind of interesting work that I had never seen this artist before. I'd heard of Cramer, but I don't remember work like this. Anyway, so here's one work. Computer landscape two. Here's computer landscape three, I think also CGI.
00:51:57.156 - 00:52:31.586, Speaker A: Kind of a surrealist kind of landscape, for lack of a better term. And computer landscape zero three. And here. So this is random girl four k. And so I think it's the same account because you can see, here's the screen print and there is your screen, right? So you put your base on and then you put your print over top, the black and white clear print. And then you put in the machine with the light and then you spray it and all that. And then you end up with your screen print.
00:52:31.586 - 00:52:54.458, Speaker A: So anyways, love to see that. Computer landscapes meet screen printing. So that is random girl 4K is also Kramer, as far as I understand. Ollie is Akoski with also some cool physical works here, some nice textures here. This is quite nice. Beautiful. I love, like, all the stuff going on here, Ollie, beautiful yellow stripe here.
00:52:54.458 - 00:53:11.388, Speaker A: This is also going somewhere. So very cool work from Ollie Isikowski. And look at Rada GM. We're here to stay. I think Rata made this watercolor. And this is quite beautiful, too. So anyways, I mean, just the range.
00:53:11.388 - 00:53:34.244, Speaker A: There's a lot to be excited about here, isn't there? And here's Stephen Schwarzer, a big fan of his. You've seen his work here on this show before. Just another kind of nice, beautiful physical work here to share that is Mittelsona versus. I wonder what version is. Shall we look quickly, I should know this. Disappear with the sun. So disappear.
00:53:34.244 - 00:53:45.104, Speaker A: Felschwinden. Mittelsonne. Felschwinden. Okay, so anyways, that is your show, everyone. Thank you for joining me again. Until next time, take care.
