00:00:05.120 - 00:00:23.994, Speaker A: It is a special mayday edition of this show. We continue here. Our ship does not stop. Well, it does stop on the weekends for Pina coladas and art openings. But other than that, we continue to sail forward here. Welcome back, everyone. Artist journal, May 1, 2023.
00:00:23.994 - 00:00:55.194, Speaker A: Broadcasting to the world from a soon to be protester filled streets in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. And a big happy mayday to everybody out there in Canada. We don't celebrate it. So it's kind of. Yeah, I have one half of my mind is in a work week here and the other half of my mind is on vacation here, enjoying the long weekend. Anyway, check out this pretty rad work by Morlakos here, called Morlak.
00:00:55.194 - 00:01:27.142, Speaker A: Maybe a. Maybe a self portrait of sorts. Kind of looks that way, doesn't it? And his figure seems to be kind of like this horned devil figure a little bit. It's a really awesome work. I mean, I don't know about you, but when I saw this, my. I had instant fomo, actually. And I haven't had that, actually, for a while where I just was like, how much? Where do I gotta go? How does this work? And it might be because it's like a tribute to a famous trading card that.
00:01:27.142 - 00:01:47.934, Speaker A: I think it's Honus Wagner. I brought that up here. I think it's to that one. Although he's facing an opposite direction. Again, I'll show you. But there's something also incredibly stunning and subtle about the color. And this is something I remember learning from one designer when I was studying graphic design in Montreal or when I was working.
00:01:47.934 - 00:02:13.348, Speaker A: Graphic design is blue and red are very powerful together. And here, this is very, very. It reminds me of that website that Alain was working on all those years ago. So anyway, very cool work. Morlak, Pepe Landos. And let's actually just see very quickly here, three tezos still available. Still five left edition of 33 cards collection.
00:02:13.348 - 00:02:27.564, Speaker A: T one, c one. So hopefully a new series here. I mean, what a start. And I brought it up large. I brought it up large. Like, it's pretty stunning, actually. All the work he put into this.
00:02:27.564 - 00:02:54.322, Speaker A: I mean, this is quite stunning. So there may be, like, here. It looks like there's a bit of texture, interestingly. And here as well. And so anyway, just a stunning, stunning work. This is interesting too, here, actually, this kind of patterning almost reminds me of Yuri J on a certain level down here. But this is just gorgeous.
00:02:54.322 - 00:03:15.134, Speaker A: Like, look at all this work. Reminiscent of Ratcloaksee. A little bit in the labor that is undergone to create the artwork. You even gotta love this. In the black, right? And in the face, instantly recognizable as Morlakos. I love this, too. It is square.
00:03:15.134 - 00:03:56.470, Speaker A: You know what's interesting? Finally, on this, before we move on, you see how it's done with a square brush. And then we think of what Rado was saying about how one of the benefits of pixel art is that you can magnify it infinitely. And so in the future, when there are incredibly high resolution screens, you're still going to be able to display it just like you see it. And you wonder about the same thing here. I mean, maybe not the texture, but everything else. It has the square brush. And so in theory, this should be infinitely, you know, can be infinitely magnified.
00:03:56.470 - 00:04:25.834, Speaker A: So maybe not like, maybe not the letters so much, but anything with this square brush here, anything in here, should be magnifiable to whatever size you desire. Beautiful yellow and red eyes. I mean, have you ever seen that before? I guess maybe in figures of the devil, but it's just not the kind of thing you see every day. So just a stunningly beautiful work by Morlakos there. And here is the baseball card. Onus Wagner baseball card sells privately for 1.2 million.
00:04:25.834 - 00:04:47.334, Speaker A: This is 2019. So anyways, there is, you know, one of the. There's probably the Mickey Mantle rookie card and this card that are, like, among the most famous baseball cards. Like, the most famous. So, anyways, this sold. I mean, this was in 2019. Hard to say if that's a high or a low price at this point.
00:04:47.334 - 00:05:23.034, Speaker A: And so, yeah, and anyways, so that is beautiful work. And speaking of trading cards, here is a picture of a work from the peloponnesian war. And big shout out to Michele Colonna, where this podcast came out on Michele's scrapbook podcast. In this episode, I sit down with Pokebellion discusses Montreal days, the making of the highly acclaimed the making of artist journal, tazos artistic movement, and much more. Check it out and subscribe. So anyways, that is available. So that is super cool and big shout out, and thanks to Michele for the interview.
00:05:23.034 - 00:05:46.308, Speaker A: It was a ton of fun. And thank you, everybody who picked up this work. Here I am resurrecting the secret history of World War three series. Here it is time. The hour is late. There are many things going on in this world, so my response is starting here. And so anyways, screenshots and ads and everything, there are some.
00:05:46.308 - 00:06:18.504, Speaker A: A little bit of AI, paintbrushes, but there's also sampled brushwork in here, too, a little bit of everything. So there's even some pixelated dithering samples there, too. So, anyways, thank you, everybody, for picking this up. Means a lot. And, yeah, what a great community this is. And this is something that Michele actually wrote in response to this, which actually, I thought is a very interesting question. We didn't have time to discuss the recurring theme of advertisement in your work.
00:06:18.504 - 00:07:39.428, Speaker A: So the reason why I'm a huge fan of advertising in the work is, first, a lot of these ads look beautiful, these Google Ads. But it's actually kind of deeper than that as well. I mean, it's probably the Ballard, the JG Ballard influence. I mean, he made a very big deal of this idea that when we're watching, say, tv, say the news, and you're seeing all this war footage and all this, like, you know, devastating, you know, violence right on tv, and then the next thing you know, you're watching a soft drink commercial and everybody's happy. And so you have this juxtaposition, and I'd argue you have a similar thing going on here where you're reading about all this, you know, war and whatever, and then there's like, oh, and buy now and here are your shoes. So on a, according to Ballard, who's a surrealist on an unconscious level, and I completely agree with him, the unconscious is not distinguishing between the real, the nonfiction news content, and what you could argue is kind of semi fictional content, a soft drink commercial or, say, an ad of whatever kind. Right? What this does, and this is why, again, this juxtaposition is inherently surrealist.
00:07:39.428 - 00:08:31.364, Speaker A: And what this does is it creates a kind of deadening of the emotions, is, according to Ballard, what he beautifully called the death of effect, which I believe he called the most terrifying casualty of the 20th century. Because what, what he argues is that that ultimately deadens our emotional response to things because we're seeing these terrible things and then we're being kind of whiplash. So our unconscious is not kind of, again, distinguishing this content. It's one narrative. So that is part of what's going on. When I put ads in, I think they're beautiful. But there's also something, there's an irony there, and there's kind of like, it's kind of highlighting this irony of tragedy being juxtaposed with this, like, like, buy now.
00:08:31.364 - 00:09:23.064, Speaker A: Or you could have someone having fun and drinking at a bar in this little ad here. And finally, on this point, this is why Ballard believed that surrealism, surrealism was the most adequate kind of toolbox for dealing with what in his world was the 20th century, because this is ultimately a surrealist juxtaposition. So is that toolkit that you could start to implement in order to start to decipher what is going on. So anyway, thank you for the question, Michaela. It speaks to some very, you know, very interesting themes continuing on, more comments here, and there's one in particular I wanted to highlight, although I will highlight a couple others very quickly here. Santiago. It's a codal.
00:09:23.064 - 00:09:46.124, Speaker A: I feel the episodes are getting more cohesive, and I really appreciate that. And, yeah, I realized, you know, a couple of weeks ago, like, I just have to force myself to get the editor. I have. I'm cutting a lot. Okay. And I have mixed feelings about that because I want everybody to, as many people as possible to get their due, but I have to cut today. I cut a ton, and there's still a ton to get through today.
00:09:46.124 - 00:10:10.872, Speaker A: So thank you. Thank you for the comment and thank you for noticing. Also, shout out to score. Thank you so much for talking about my work. Again, it was nice to hear your reaction to my tweet. It is very fun, this little dialogue that goes back and forth between the show and the artists and everything. I was so happy to see the work of Rinnefish in the beginning of number 172, and this is what I wanted to highlight here.
00:10:10.872 - 00:10:51.530, Speaker A: We are friends, but also, I'm a big fan of her. So more friends within this scene, and I just think that's really cool. And more people who you didn't know were friends are friends. And then also Flora Marquez and Runetune capturing or go in depth on this idea of different ways of creating. Remember we were talking about how, say, Rauschenberg didn't plan anything and he liked it that way and the kind of fun that's involved. And we sort of see that a little bit with hysterical waffle where it's just kind of doodling and not planning too much and how that can be a really fun way to work. Ed Marolla also.
00:10:51.530 - 00:11:05.060, Speaker A: Right. So this can be a, like, a very good way to be prolific because. Because once you start planning things, you do start to. It becomes more of a labor. Now it can. It has its place. Right.
00:11:05.060 - 00:11:55.964, Speaker A: Um, so just very quickly, let's see if runetune says there's two problem solving processes of convergent and virgin modes, which has been beneficial to me when making a plan or not. In creative work, in the convergent mode of creativity, there's a singular idea or solution that you're focused on achieving, and all efforts are directed towards reaching the end point. So he calls that a convergent mode. In contrast, the divergent allows for free generation of multiple ideas or exploring different directions without being limited to a single solution. Both modes are valuable and there's no one size fits all solution for creative work. It is essential to understand the difference between the two modes and how they can serve you. I found that starting with the divergent mode is excellent for generating a wide range of ideas, but it's crucial to identify the best idea and then shift into the convergent mode to work towards a single solution.
00:11:55.964 - 00:12:37.598, Speaker A: So very interesting. And Flora also chimed in on that same point, basically saying, if I remember right, she works both ways, say with the daily drawing she is not worrying and not planning. And then in other cases she does plan. So regarding what we talked about the other time, about planning or not, I think they are different instances. It's good to do this activity of letting the brain flow in a more creative instance where ideas are dropped and we see what we grab, like fisherman. Then we can choose one of those concepts which came out rather randomly and deepen it, work on it more carefully, give it some time and rest in case. Since it's a series of daily drawings, I do not explore too much the second instance.
00:12:37.598 - 00:13:06.938, Speaker A: So again, almost, you know, going into convergent mode after the divergent beginning according to rune tunes. So all to say there are different ways of working and flora works both ways and so does rune tune. And I think just interesting to highlight that. Thank you everybody for the comments. By the way, that show seemed to go over well. And thank you ilay watching along right now. So this was the person I was talking about, Miret Oppenheim.
00:13:06.938 - 00:13:41.954, Speaker A: This fur cup, very famous surrealist object. And the fur covered cup, saucer and spoon. You'll often see it in art history textbooks. So speaking of which, enjoy your picks from the gallery art scene. So here I here's part two. So this was the rest of the weekend. So here's my friend Bob, a cool photographer, italian guy and here was at Capitan Petzl is the name of the gallery.
00:13:41.954 - 00:13:59.172, Speaker A: A pretty prominent. I just thought these. Here are some highlights here for you. These were oil paintings all by the same artist by the way. Let me see if I can get rid of the info here. Pretty cool kind of BMX or I guess dirt bike sort of. Look at this.
00:13:59.172 - 00:14:18.694, Speaker A: Doesn't this remind you of like those revel models? And then the GM even was kind of mysterious. You wonder if that was some sort of crypto thing. It could have been accidental. And then here's how beautiful the gallery was. Almost pretty quiet for. It's a pretty prestigious gallery. And their opening was pretty quiet.
00:14:18.694 - 00:14:41.762, Speaker A: Here is another one, BQ, which is close to Rosa Luxembourg Platz, if you know Berlin. And I thought this was funny. This one was very well attended. Kind of a, you know, pretty cool for pretty cool contemporary art show. Like, obviously this is. Seems to be a reference to Duchamp, right? And where he had like a bicycle wheel here instead. It's like a tire.
00:14:41.762 - 00:15:03.772, Speaker A: It's a different take on Duchamp. And this was also in that show. And this was an interesting juxtaposition as well. Where you can see the little tanks, you can see machine guns here, maybe bombs, but kind of woven into knitting. Right? And a little sad face there. So interesting juxtaposition. And this was kind of edgy and cool too.
00:15:03.772 - 00:15:27.728, Speaker A: I mean, kind of reminded me of the Berlin Biennale in 2016, actually. I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of those artists. So people in a plane, she's on her phone, these two like mannequins, and he's cutting her hair. So just kind of a. I found these actually pretty cool and provocative in a fun way. So just some highlights here. Here was another one of those knitted works, war works.
00:15:27.728 - 00:15:46.236, Speaker A: Maybe a happy face here, missing an eye. And this was the crowd there. So you can see the knitted work in the background. These were some sort of seats or something. I'm not exactly sure what those were. And here you see this kind of dog, wooden dog or horse that's going through the wall. So kind of a fun show.
00:15:46.236 - 00:16:05.310, Speaker A: This was at BQ, which is also a pretty renowned gallery here in Berlin. This was also in the same show. Looks like car wiring that's been turned into a sculpture. And this is outside. And this is actually. And this is Nagel Drexler, which is right beside. These few galleries are all together here.
00:16:05.310 - 00:16:24.746, Speaker A: And that's also a very prominent space in prestigious gallery in Berlin. So you can see inside here are some metal sculptures and whatnot. And this was a friend who I actually just met there, Nicholas Cashian. And he actually. And there's the Volkspune. For those that know Berlin. That's.
00:16:24.746 - 00:16:44.190, Speaker A: So this is Rosa Luxembourg Platz. And that is the people's theatre, folks's people. So here's the Volkspuna in the background. And very nice, cool guy. And he actually works in the workshop that created these. So it was a different artist, but he works in that workshop. So just more personalities from the Berlin art scene.
00:16:44.190 - 00:17:00.978, Speaker A: Very friendly. Cool dude. And here was just across the square, the piazza, the Platz, crypto kiosk, which is also Nagel, Drexler. This is their crypto thing. So that is kind of cool. And I think I have some. This was inside.
00:17:00.978 - 00:17:17.818, Speaker A: So kind of mysterious here. Kind of more like textiles. Right? We saw the knitting before there. And this was some kind of video game that the artist had made. And it's like a four player thing. So anyways, this is just kind of inside. These were on the wall.
00:17:17.818 - 00:17:34.110, Speaker A: So maybe these were designs for the character in the video game. Not sure. And then just around the corner is the famous Babylon theater. And they're having a David lynch festival. So just a taste of Berlin here. This is. I used to live really close to here when I first moved to Berlin.
00:17:34.110 - 00:18:01.320, Speaker A: And then this was the next day, this was at the Juden Museum, the Jewish Museum here in Berlin. Or gallery or museum, because there's another museum. Anyway. And so this was a show, and some people inside. This was at what used to be Blaine Southern, which is another really big gallery. But now actually, Max Hetzler, this is like their third location. I had no idea.
00:18:01.320 - 00:18:33.064, Speaker A: Cause this used to be, like nerve center, at least in my few years of being here, of gallery weekend, was kind of like the Blaine Southern show. It kind of has the big space. Esther Shipper and other blue Chip Gallery is right around, right beside it. And here they have a Catrina gross exhibition. And Katrina Gross, a lot of you will have heard of, is a very prominent, a very prominent artist. Gagosian, this sort of thing. There's my girlfriend actually looking back suspiciously at me.
00:18:33.064 - 00:18:53.504, Speaker A: And this is a Lineup. In order to get into Esther Shipper, you actually have to take an elevator. So this is just part of the crowd. This is Saturday afternoon at gallery weekend, kind of nerve center. They even had some tents this time where you can get a drink. And this was on top there, looking down. And so here's some of Catriona Gross's work.
00:18:53.504 - 00:19:13.270, Speaker A: So interesting, always kind of provocative, I'd argue in the colors and just everything, how it's made. Here's a really big one. And here is kind of the middle square. So here is that gallery that we just looked at here. And here is Esther Shipper. I think the. You can see the lineup.
00:19:13.270 - 00:19:33.838, Speaker A: And it's going to this elevator that goes up here. And this is inside. This is across the little square here. And just some interesting paintings here on aluminum. Here's some landscapes on aluminum. The world is real. So just some, you know, this is just a hint of what was going on this weekend.
00:19:33.838 - 00:19:54.022, Speaker A: Here's a lot of people. It was a beautiful kind of weekend, too. This is Jorind Voight and this was down the street if I'm pronouncing her name. All right, interesting artist. Here's some more of her work and prominent Berlin artist. I think she's in Berlin still. And that, my friends, is your gallery.
00:19:54.022 - 00:20:10.692, Speaker A: Weekend part two. So awesome. And big shout out to Heidi Rockette responding to our comments to the comments I made last show. Thanks so much. Your layering idea is awesome. I'm going to try it soon, so that's really cool to hear and really awesome. So looking forward to seeing that big shout out.
00:20:10.692 - 00:20:42.688, Speaker A: And also, Rosatio, like I said, I've been doing this for years. My background as a graphic designer gives a huge influence in making zines. So many people with graphic design backgrounds. I think it's great because I think art school, there's not necessarily a ton of discipline. And again, learning the formal qualities of what makes an image interesting and good and doing what you want it to do, graphic design is incredibly helpful. Very thankless profession, though. As I've mentioned before, as much as I love digital art, I love something tactile too, something that I can touch.
00:20:42.688 - 00:21:02.796, Speaker A: So back to the physical here and the appreciation for it. And look at this. Step one, printing. Nice printer. This brother printer is making nice prints. And then step two, folding. And even a nice little machine here that looks like for cutting and here's for folding and everything.
00:21:02.796 - 00:21:25.924, Speaker A: So anyways, shout out to rosatio. Very interesting. So this was kind of interesting. Again, this bitcoin thing, it's not going away. And I'm kind of getting more and more feeling more and more fomo, for lack of better term. Like, I feel more and more like I need to get on this. Trevor, BTC bitcoin is going to be the premium side of the luxury goods NFT.
00:21:25.924 - 00:21:44.682, Speaker A: It's the gold standard. So that is interesting. And there's these podcasts that are going out on ordinals, the ordinal show. So I'm probably going to start just listening to that. I wanted to set up a wallet. I never did this weekend because the weather was too nice. But I think I'm going to set up a wallet.
00:21:44.682 - 00:22:19.204, Speaker A: And just quickly on the NFT scene because this continues to be an issue here. Metasci, who's a fairly prominent account on blur, a big NFT collector, talking about the blur. Incredible how they killed nfts within a few months. Cancelled our USP in attracting and retaining artists, in other words, canceled royalties, commoditized art. Well, I don't know. I take her point. It's been more commoditized, canceled liquidity by rewarding farmers that drove down both prices and consequently willingness to buy and sell.
00:22:19.204 - 00:23:05.084, Speaker A: And this is kind of like the bigger issue. Yeah, like, and so as this person 4170 commented, incentivizing farmers and flippers while penalizing creators and holders sounds about right. With destroying value, the tool that absolutely no one wants or needs in this space. And we're back to this, and I mentioned this before, I mean, these are the backers who are often promoting, you know, nfts and the revolution of nfts, but then simultaneously. So I've made the point before, it would be interesting to hear from their supporters. So yeah, there just seems to be a bit of a cognitive dissonance, and I've already said my piece on that, so we don't need to go back there. But yeah, other people are commenting the same.
00:23:05.084 - 00:23:42.264, Speaker A: And so art gnome, with an interesting comment as well. We're back to the phase in nfts where we have to support each other or no one else will. No superstars or prima Donna's shilling, and no daily mainstream news stories. Just good everyday people expressing themselves creatively, sharing and learning from each other and making friends. Well, I think we do that pretty good here and on tazos. And even like, I mean, I'm not tazos specific, and a lot of the people that I show the work of here are not tazos specific. But anyways, we're having a good time over here and I think just echo what art Gnome's saying.
00:23:42.264 - 00:24:03.024, Speaker A: I totally agree. Check out Somfei's studio, another studio shot. I would keep the volume, but sometimes there are copyright issues there. So look at all this gear. Look at these racks and old tvs and even the vinyl. That is hilarious. So pretty impressive from Somfei.
00:24:03.024 - 00:24:46.054, Speaker A: So my stargate, and this I believe was spogels Maskinen, may have retweeted this. So another one of these kind of interfaces, almost one of these light bright interfaces here, testing our new custom led matrix controller based on an ESP 32 pico. It's extremely compact and powerful enough to drive a lot of leds. It will be the heart of some of our new physical digital editions. So here it is in action. So just kind of cool and kind of brings up this whole idea of display, especially for maybe, especially for maybe pixel art or something, or like monochromatic pixel art. Anyway, it's just kind of interesting to see what people are working on.
00:24:46.054 - 00:25:13.396, Speaker A: And here, ASCII two effect on the GPU for three JS is now open source here. So check this out. So a lot of you, in case you're wondering, this is, you know, how a lot of the ASCII art is made. It's you simply put in your object, and you get them things made of letters. So it looks like this. There are websites and everything available. Anyways, I just thought this was cool and would share it for those that wonder, because maybe a lot of people wonder.
00:25:13.396 - 00:25:37.192, Speaker A: And here's another look at a pen plotter. This is, again, Zancane in art matter. And again, just to see it in action here. Like, I think what I'm most amazed by is this. Like, look at this texture that's being made here. So it looks like they're experimenting. This isn't just a marker being kind of dragged across the surface here.
00:25:37.192 - 00:26:07.798, Speaker A: It looks like they're playing with maybe this is sand or something. Like, whatever they're doing, this is getting more. I'm seeing things I've never seen before with this. Like, see all that? And then they're kind of vacuuming it up or whatever they're doing over here. So, like, here it looks like they're vacuuming it up. So maybe that's graphite, who knows what? But this is more than, just, say, this marker crawling across here, as impressive and awesome as that is. And look at that.
00:26:07.798 - 00:26:30.460, Speaker A: So, anyways, I continue to be really just kind of fascinated and amazed by the pen plotters. And we're almost done. Our comments and news here, there was a ton. I mean, this. This scene is no shortage of interesting commentary. Charles? AI calling AI artists prompt designers, which I've never heard. I've heard prompt engineers, is like calling painters paint appliers.
00:26:30.460 - 00:26:56.596, Speaker A: It has that pejorative undertone to it, as that term has been used profusely by the anti AI art crowd to describe us prompt designers. I kind of agree. It's like bloggers. And that stuck, actually. But that was kind of often seen as kind of a. The mainstream media's way of downplaying what people were saying. These are just blogs, right? That was like a 20 year old, but kind of a similar idea going on here.
00:26:56.596 - 00:27:34.054, Speaker A: With prompt designers, we engage in a more intricate process than just designing prompts. We have to think about the conceptual, aesthetic, and technical aspects of the artwork and use our skills to guide and collaborate with AI systems to create meaningful and visually compelling pieces. And as has been pointed out many times before. Taste becomes incredibly important throughout this, and judgment is maybe a better way of putting it. Judgment is you're constantly making aesthetic judgments. Right? So, yeah, like AI is. I actually really agree with a lot of what Charles AI is saying here.
00:27:34.054 - 00:28:07.524, Speaker A: It doesn't capture the creative aspect of working with AI at all. It's sort of like saying, like techno that uses samples is not original or it's not that important because it's just using samples of other people's work. And it really doesn't capture everything that's going on from a great techno artist. Disappointing to still see some big artists totally miss the point, intentionally or not. So anyway, and finally, here's an use of AI in painting. So as we move into our paintings, this is rare. A good boy.
00:28:07.524 - 00:28:39.772, Speaker A: Time to go play. Here's an example of my earlier work involving spot, where I used BQgan, which I think is some sort of AI to manipulate the reference photo for the painting. That's why the bot seems so abstract and organic. So isn't that interesting? It's not like from some shot or some video that he screenshotted, he actually used VQgan, which I think can start to manipulate forms. That's why the bot seems so abstract and organic. It was a collaboration with AI as I still painted from start to finish. So that is the work.
00:28:39.772 - 00:29:00.390, Speaker A: So I think that was his first spot work, I think. And here just also one of rare's oil paintings from over a decade ago. I know the owner of this piece. It would be fun to tokenize it and see what the actual physical with NFT would go for. So there you go. I think that is the only pc. Yeah, exactly.
00:29:00.390 - 00:29:24.580, Speaker A: And here we go. Over ten years apart, digital versus oil painting. Something about painting people sitting on stools. So again, showing the lineage. And it's true, I still work on series that I started, like the nostalgia studies in like 2013. So I think that's great. And this is actually what I want to talk about on the next Twitter spaces.
00:29:24.580 - 00:30:02.834, Speaker A: How did nfts change your art? Which I think is a really interesting question, because I'm making things that I wouldn't have made without this NFT technology. So I thought just as an open, you know, open show, so anybody who wants can come join in, anybody should, you know, any artist out there making work, this is your chance. Come on stage, do some public speaking, get your name out there a little bit more. And I really like having some shows without, you know, the special guest. That's the opportunity for everybody that feels ignored out there to come out and just start talking. You can be the guest. Okay.
00:30:02.834 - 00:30:28.014, Speaker A: So anyways, so interesting contrast and comparison from rare. And here, this was interesting too. I just saw this posted here and we have some, a tweet actually. And so this is a digital, what would we call this? This is printed on Hanamula paper. So this is a. But I think let's go back to the superware. So I just want to show the physical here for a second.
00:30:28.014 - 00:30:52.086, Speaker A: So this is digital pirate. I almost wanted to start with this, but it was from February, so I thought that was maybe a little older. As the world becomes more digital, so did the pirates. They no longer needed ships or parrots to loot your digital goods. All they need is an Internet connection and some computer skills. So naturally I gravitated towards this piece here. In recent years, the prevalence of digital pirate has grown exponentially.
00:30:52.086 - 00:31:22.886, Speaker A: And this is due to Internet global connectivity. So digital cut. This is where I was going. This is a digi cut. So I'm not even sure what this is. It's been minted on super rare. So again, I'm kind of back to this idea that what is digital and what is physical are continuing to get fuzzier because what is this? I guess there was a digital file first, and maybe it's like laser cut.
00:31:22.886 - 00:31:45.964, Speaker A: Maybe that's what they mean by digital cut. So interesting. And this is a jpeg, but I don't think it's a scan, right. Of this work. Like this probably came first, but then this is the physical. And interestingly, the auction winner will receive a one of one physical work. So I think we have some other.
00:31:45.964 - 00:32:08.906, Speaker A: And you see, this couldn't have been made without digital. I don't think. I mean, theoretically someone could do some incredibly intricate wood. It's like a woodcut of sorts, but like a digital woodcut. That's probably why they call it a digit cut. So there's the one of one that you buy if you get heal monsters work. So a new artist I hadn't seen before, and they are called heal monster.
00:32:08.906 - 00:32:38.826, Speaker A: H e e l. So really interesting again to see this physics and where you get both are being sold kind of in the same kind of, you know, sale. Nice work by Rosaceo here on May 1. A do it yourself illusion we create at home. So kind of more of a. Almost like a portrait of sorts or a one person, more of a focus on a subject, a singular subject here. Like a person of sorts or a figure and some eyeballs on the side.
00:32:38.826 - 00:33:00.014, Speaker A: A little bit of animation here. And really nice color. Beautiful, kind of textured crayon or chalk or oil stick is almost what that looks like. Collage drawing. And there's also collage in here from Rosatio, so that just got minted. And it is for sale at nine tezos each. So it is moving.
00:33:00.014 - 00:33:14.898, Speaker A: And here's a work by Kappa, sage and fake whale. So a nice collaboration here. Ghetto angels and neighborhood angels. Young promises. Little dreamers who want to conquer the world no matter what. I'm pretty sure kappa is out of Argentina. I'm not positive on that.
00:33:14.898 - 00:33:30.926, Speaker A: So, anyways, a nice piece here from Kappa. And this almost looks like the History channel here in this h. But there's maybe a Gucci and everything. So cool trademark. You can tell instantly it's kappa. Also released today. Ghetto angels.
00:33:30.926 - 00:33:52.344, Speaker A: Nice title, too. And also bezaya with fake whale. Maybe this is like May 1 because this also came out today. And here's the queen with kind of a street wear figure here. And the queen with some gold teeth now passed on. And a big kind of sunset here. This could be Tempelhof in Berlin at the big park here.
00:33:52.344 - 00:34:11.984, Speaker A: And a knife and everything. So anyway, God save the nfts. Forgive us for our flippings, as we forgive those who flip us and lead us not into rug pulls, but deliver us from scammers. Ten x times ten. All right, so there you go. Your prayer for the day. A new one from Jan Lucas Migon.
00:34:11.984 - 00:34:38.188, Speaker A: Your hell is my heaven losing gravity. And so just another really interesting painting here. This almost looks like AI in here or some sort of. Maybe it's just digital painting, mixing a little bit of different kinds of textures here and different kinds of colors. So pretty kind of grand work here. Also feels like a bit of a hat tip to italian paintings. Somewhere along the lines in the composition.
00:34:38.188 - 00:34:59.996, Speaker A: I'm sort of almost like one of those works you see on the ceiling of a church sometimes in the dome area. And this has a bid of 0.3 ETH on April 29. So the next day, basically 12 hours later, it has a bid of 0.3. And it was one, actually. And it was finished off, actually. So that is cool.
00:34:59.996 - 00:35:17.724, Speaker A: Actually, the bid came actually less than an hour or. Sorry, it was. A bid was placed on April 29, and then it sold out yesterday morning. So, anyways, it took a day for it to sell. Really cool work by hasdrubal waffle. I think this was out on Friday. Sibling rivalry.
00:35:17.724 - 00:35:44.432, Speaker A: So, really, this looks like. I think he called this operation, this old video game or, sorry, board game. And then you have the wishbone here and everything. And anyways, what look like a couple of ninja doctors here and some beautiful texture at the back here. So his drupal waffle continues to deliver beautifully. Interesting. Kind of red and black really dominate with this nice yellow here.
00:35:44.432 - 00:36:21.322, Speaker A: Beautiful texture, as usual. Let's just see what happened here. There is an auction bid, and Kurt Hussle collective won it on April 29, so, yeah, very cool. And Yuri J. From the studio. So remember the teacup last time where he's playing with this very close up sort of stuff? It looks like he's continuing to play with this composition style this time almost from the perspective of the person who might be drinking the tea or who's making the artwork here. So this is kind of a fun kind of studio shot.
00:36:21.322 - 00:36:46.670, Speaker A: This almost looks like there's a bit of a Minecraft feel to the whole kind of floor and everything, and the wall kind of. You barely see a corner here. It's almost like the patterning continues. So these kind of awkward spaces, you know, in these almost like cubist spaces here and the computer and everything. Very cool from Yuri J. From the studio. And I almost want to call it axe joke book.
00:36:46.670 - 00:37:10.088, Speaker A: It's almost. He's been putting out a few tweets recently that are almost like. That there are, like, jokes. And this almost feels like a little bit of the joke thing, too, with the skeleton legs here and going on the treadmill to get their likes. And whatever you do that stays at zero here. And there's your likes. So nice commentary.
00:37:10.088 - 00:37:29.784, Speaker A: Can you pass this simple test? 2023. And so let's just quickly see what happened here. And sailed for 111 tezos, and it went within, like, two minutes. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. So that's pretty good take home. So that is like a hundred, a thousand, over a 1000, 1100 tezos.
00:37:29.784 - 00:37:55.832, Speaker A: And look at Ed selling. Continuing to sell 0.15 ETH on what is this bridge, and we'll look at it in a second here. So bid on within basically a day. And then. Yeah, another person buying up Ed's work here for 0.15 ETH, which is a nice take home, too, right? I mean, what is that? That is like three or $400, like $300.
00:37:55.832 - 00:38:10.810, Speaker A: That sounds good to me. And this beautiful, very textured work here kind of has a religious feeling to it. Interesting title, too, with bridge, almost a face in there. So, anyways, very nice work. Even a nice frame. How. It's kind of like.
00:38:10.810 - 00:38:27.094, Speaker A: It's not. I mean, the temptation would be to make just a regular rectangular frame, but it's kind of drawn in, and that is kind of interesting and nice, too. Nice composition. There's a lot going on there even then, the lighting and everything. Just very beautiful. Beautiful. A bridge from nowhere to firewear.
00:38:27.094 - 00:38:41.288, Speaker A: Got to speed up here. Argyle. Tez with a cool kind of gif like work. Psychic death circus. So interesting piece here. Just kind of, as we enter pixelation land. So argyle.
00:38:41.288 - 00:38:59.704, Speaker A: And let's just see, very quickly. Sold for eight tezos on primary, and that was gone within basically two minutes. So pixel art. And Argyle, I think, has a pretty big following. So anyways, pretty cool. Look at this beautiful work by Kappan cyr. Very nice.
00:38:59.704 - 00:39:22.976, Speaker A: So I assume this will be minted soon. I thought this was actually just stunning. This contrast here between this black and white static and the color dynamic here is more powerful than ever, I think, in this piece here. So beautiful work posted on twitter. And then Michael Macasso. It's not the land that we knew anymore, I thought. Stunning colors on this one, maybe.
00:39:22.976 - 00:39:42.248, Speaker A: How many colors here? Looks like four colors, maybe five. Stunning colors here on this beautiful kind of semi abstract landscape. Almost like a japanese screen or something. So cool work from Michael Macasso here, too. The access card to your old memories. Defragmented. So just a little windows 95 sort of thing.
00:39:42.248 - 00:40:05.022, Speaker A: I thought this was just kind of cute and funny. So cool work from Michael Macasso. And then loac me. Angry, dithered clouds. So, again, so you see just some nice abstraction here, or abstract looking dithering. It's almost like. It's almost like the dithering is on the right hand.
00:40:05.022 - 00:40:21.232, Speaker A: See this cloud where my cursor is? And then on this other cloud is a different treatment. Just kind of like the one bit treatment. Isn't that interesting? Here's an artist I don't know if I've ever seen before. Anna Sabden. Maybe I have. Pixel artist. So anyways, just kind of a nice pixel art work.
00:40:21.232 - 00:40:40.568, Speaker A: It looks like snow. When was this minted? March 5. So might have missed that a few weeks ago. And this was also kind of interesting, too. Nuggeteer. And this is on tazos 30 editions, one tezos only. Kind of reminiscent of the pixel art factories, but a completely different take on it.
00:40:40.568 - 00:41:19.366, Speaker A: So, finishing the spade here, I thought this is just, you know, again, could hang in the same show as, like, those gogolitis and pixel art factories from other artists that we were looking at. Kareem Sifa, stippin pixel with another kind of really interesting kind of pixel artwork and just putting this big thing in the background. It's just really cool again, and just playing with this house theme. And then just kind of some chairs and whatnot. Kind of mysterious edition of three for 15 tezos and sold out for five tezos on primary. So nice piece there. And here is gogolitis pong training system.
00:41:19.366 - 00:41:54.532, Speaker A: Two. If we had more time, I'd show you number one, which is an absolute classic of pixel art. And here is the upgrade, the new version. And it is just on fire here with the beautiful new colors. And one of my favorite parts here is this kind of maze, like a, you know, pixelation here. I love how it kind of fades, how it's, like, really intense around the triangle here, and then it fades to this outer area here. It's really, really nicely done, almost like the circuit board, the circuitry just sort of fades off.
00:41:54.532 - 00:42:09.858, Speaker A: Like, it's really nice piece here. I don't know if it's for sale yet, but the offers are high. Look at drip at 100 tazos. 40. 37. So this is very popular work here. And Sean Luke with also a very beautiful work.
00:42:09.858 - 00:42:27.298, Speaker A: Look up. I don't know if this is a newer work. I didn't see a link and I didn't see it, but interesting how the colors are actually somewhat reminiscent. These could hang very well together. And nice little UFO themed piece here. Really? Yeah. You wonder if similar software is being used.
00:42:27.298 - 00:42:48.970, Speaker A: And then here's breachmaker by Guan Denarian. So, also kind of has that pixel art factory look here. So, again, cream safa gogolitis. And here, guan Denarian. And this is on manifold XYZ for 0.1 ETH. 26, minted.
00:42:48.970 - 00:43:06.442, Speaker A: So 2.6 ETH. So this stuff. I mean, gogolitis may want to consider doing an open edition on ETH, is what I would suggest. John has another one, and this is just one of several he's been releasing recently. Very prolific recently. New zoom background.
00:43:06.442 - 00:43:30.646, Speaker A: So the skeleton is now taking a selfie in the studio after all the flowers have been shoveled to the back here. So, anyways, cool work by John. This is an edition of 25 now for 120. So all the works coming out has not slowed down his sales. So John continues to do really well. It's interesting. So all selling for 25 on primary.
00:43:30.646 - 00:43:59.210, Speaker A: And so there you go, 25 times 25. I mean, that's pretty good. What is that, like, 25 times 20? Is that like over 500? So, anyways, not gonna do math on the spot here. Floor. Check out the soundtrack on this, too. So we've seen this here, maximum volume for soundtrack. So here's jpegfam web3.
00:43:59.210 - 00:44:21.456, Speaker A: Ready? So we've seen a few portraits in this kind of. With this frame here by this artist, floor 99. So music and art by your servants. So by floor 99, open edition for zero one five ETH until May 9. And so that is cool. Lincoln biology, interesting. Kind of fuzzed out pixels here, edgy.
00:44:21.456 - 00:44:52.194, Speaker A: And Estelle Flores with Joshua Tree. And this is just some interesting photo glitched on a basic ide emulating commodore 64. Now this is. Yeah, so just interesting, kind of pretty commodore 64 glitchery, shall we say. And let me just. And you get different variations here. It's four minutes and 33 seconds, so maybe on purpose, right? Referencing John Cage, maybe 433.
00:44:52.194 - 00:45:31.146, Speaker A: So playing with randomness to a certain degree, I am guessing there, but it wouldn't shock me. So anyways, here's just some highlights here of the different kind of glitched out versions of this Joshua tree image. So very cool from Estelle Flores and Estelle, or, sorry, Empress trash, has put out some teznowns. So here are a couple of tez nouns, which I thought were quite cool that I completely missed here. And so just really nice piece here. And I think Empress trash is also a glitch artist, but not positive on that. And here's another one in black and white.
00:45:31.146 - 00:45:49.876, Speaker A: So anyways, just kind of a nice piece here. Interesting take on the nouns. And continue. Let's just look at what happened on the market here. So not sold. And let's just see the other one. If that was sold, this went for 195 tezos to theater of dreams.
00:45:49.876 - 00:46:16.776, Speaker A: So nice price. Continuing on, look at this stunner from Polygon 1993. And I mean, whatever Polygon 1993 is doing, the colors are stunning. And girl with pearl earring, a popular subject for works here. This is beautiful. So I don't know if they're being minted, because I never see a link here. But anyway, maybe they're on super rare here.
00:46:16.776 - 00:46:38.212, Speaker A: Shall we look very, very quickly. These would be brilliant to put on super rare. I bet they'd go for a fortune. But I'm not sure if they're being minted. Hopefully I don't crash my computer here. Yeah, I don't see anything off the top here. So who knows? Maybe the mints to come ex mortal, which could hang in the same room here.
00:46:38.212 - 00:47:01.888, Speaker A: Solace. And some beautiful kind of spring flowers here, blooming. So another one of the blooming flowers, April 29. And this sold for how much on primary five? Tezos and this was an edition of 15. Another one by Renki Kagoshima Chuo. And how are we doing here? Gotta speed up again. So just kind of interesting animated abstract work.
00:47:01.888 - 00:47:16.784, Speaker A: And Koda Nakazono was a gorgeous one. You gotta love the Microsoft logo reference in the background here. So really nice piece here. Back to the continuums. Let me just look at the title. Continuum number 103. So they continue here.
00:47:16.784 - 00:47:32.304, Speaker A: And have any sold? None. So they are all on offer. And so let's just see the offers here. Yeah, so twelve, 1211. So beautiful work here. And here's Haiti Rockette with a really cool kind of 3d work. Popcorn hype.
00:47:32.304 - 00:47:56.714, Speaker A: So playing with these mortal kombat figures and some Photoshop screenshots and everything. This looks awesome. So all the fun we have come to love from Haiti Rockette. Let's just see what happened very quickly on primary here. 2020. Yeah, they sold for 20. And how many editions of 30? So nice take home for Haiti Rockette.
00:47:56.714 - 00:48:21.484, Speaker A: Check this out. This is a collaboration between rinifish and neek and greeting from bugs. So this apparently is a reference to the Voyager one record. Now we'll take a quick look at the Voyager one record here. Bidding starts at 0.26. So maybe this is a one of one, I think. And there are two days left and I don't know if we have any bids left.
00:48:21.484 - 00:48:47.920, Speaker A: Bidding starts at 0.269. So anyways, cool idea here and here you see the rinne fish within the record here. And this here too is a reference to the Voyager one record. Now I'll show you the Voyager one record. So here, I looked it up on Wikipedia. I always thought there was actually a photo of a man and a woman. Like I always thought, because you also can find this as the Voyager one.
00:48:47.920 - 00:49:11.828, Speaker A: Like I always thought there was this. But when I looked on Wikipedia, surprisingly, this gold record here, it just has this stuff. Surprisingly, the sounds of Earth, United States of America, planet Earth. Almost making it sound like planet Earth is the USA. But they put it out there, so gotta give them credit for that. NASA put out this famous gold record here. So anyways, very interesting.
00:49:11.828 - 00:49:43.616, Speaker A: So that is what this stuff is based on. So cool subject matter from Nick and Rinnefish and also Mirai Mizui. This is actually a profound philosophical question. My body is made up of 37 trillion cells. All cells are replaced every seven years. What remains of me? I mean, this is a deep philosophical question here. How does your identity remain when everything is being replaced every seven years? Interesting question.
00:49:43.616 - 00:50:12.348, Speaker A: So anyways, here's a visualization of this philosophical problem. And we saw the brain, you know, descartes brain in the bathtub. Now we have this kind of famous philosophical issue from Mirai Mizueh. Flora is taking a couple of days off, but this beautiful work here, I took two days off from drawing of the day because I needed a break. Sometimes you got to recharge, but this looks great. I love this one. So I'm not sure if this was before or after the break, but it looks awesome.
00:50:12.348 - 00:50:30.344, Speaker A: And even the empty word balloons and everything. I've been using the smudge tool actually this weekend in procreate, and I have to. I highly recommend it. I think that's what's going on here. The smudge tool is gorgeous. I was almost wondering if that's how Ed Merola makes some of his textures. Summer blues.
00:50:30.344 - 00:50:53.532, Speaker A: So I haven't seen. We haven't shown summer blues work for a while. I think it's Andre. But here's a work that was minted in April that I missed April 8. So anyways, I think this is on foundation, if I'm not mistaken, kind of animated. A classic illustrator from the NFT scene. If you've never seen Andre Summer blues, Andre blues or summer blues art work.
00:50:53.532 - 00:51:10.838, Speaker A: Insidious awakening. And here it looks like a grim reaper. Here, almost a death. And interestingly, there's the mushroom. So this seems to be quite a psychedelic work where almost the mushroom and this confrontation with death is the subject matter. Insidious awakening. Interesting.
00:51:10.838 - 00:51:32.022, Speaker A: Aw, shucks. With a couple of cool new AI animation cells is what I want to call these, barking at the door. So this kind of looks like a mix of like 101 Dalmatians and maybe Pluto or something. So anyways, more interesting AI work from awshucks. And here's another one. Ele telephony. A telephant on an elephone.
00:51:32.022 - 00:51:53.002, Speaker A: So you gotta love that. So anyways, maybe a reference to dumbo here. So anyways, more Disney animations that are put through AI from the looks of it. And this is Evelyn o. And this also, let me make this slightly smaller. And this kind of echoes what Charles AI was saying. So here's a beautiful work by Evelyn.
00:51:53.002 - 00:52:29.138, Speaker A: Oh, that you could tell would just never be made without AI. To anyone who thinks AI art is just a random output, if I start with a sketch and feed it, I might do 30 outputs to find the right one to start working with. Then I go into AI suggestions or possibilities within that piece and correct it so it gets closer to my vision of that specific possibility. This might be another ten outputs back and forth, correcting and feeding, and this time 15 to get outputs to, again, output together. And this kind of is reminiscent to something I said, maybe in November, in a November show. It's almost like sculpture. Like you're kind of.
00:52:29.138 - 00:53:06.680, Speaker A: When you get an output, you're kind of trying to mold and sculpt the work with kind of your prompts or with whatever technique you're using. Sometimes it's just by uploading an image or putting style 100 rather than style zero. Right? So. And I think anybody that uses AI, for the most part, in a serious way over a prolonged period, you don't need to. I find I'd be surprised if you need to make the argument that it's like art in a form of art making. That's 180 outputs made of with painting, editing, and this is it. These are all decisions.
00:53:06.680 - 00:53:22.474, Speaker A: When you're painting, you're making decisions. When you're in AI, you're making decisions. And then it's not even a piece I'm satisfied with after all of this work. So it's in the bin. But this piece might have got me the new ideas for the next piece. It's not just a prompt and voila. It's a process.
00:53:22.474 - 00:53:55.652, Speaker A: And that's a very profound point there. So this piece took two weeks to finish and only had 33 outputs before finish, but it drives from five other works I mashed together that had each around 150 outputs. So you could be working harder here than making a drawing. Right? So I think point taken. And these are available on super rare from Evelyn O. Big shout out to Evelyn O, who again, showed me how to upscale our websites. And that was profoundly helpful.
00:53:55.652 - 00:54:23.474, Speaker A: Changed everything. I mean, sometimes these little technical things can be incredibly important to getting to the next step. So you recognize this artist. This is Benta, and we are going to speed up this show with a beautiful AI work here. So, new one from Venta looks like using a newer version of mid journey with these newer works. So this is listed at 0.1 ETH, and that is on foundation.
00:54:23.474 - 00:54:46.736, Speaker A: And here's another one by this artist. Skirbo, work in progress. So just these wild kind of bodyworks here, figures and just interesting novel shapes here, seemingly using AI. Not positive. Look at this. By strange thing, my boots have been going viral, way above the average, like count for this account. So look at that.
00:54:46.736 - 00:55:16.148, Speaker A: 235,000 likes on this design mid journey account. So people, you know. So a strange thing continues to push the envelope in AI with what looks like the amid journey account is showing his work and it going way, check it out, way above the average, like count for this account. It's not that the, it's also not the only account that's featured them. So strange thing. Continues to do very well here. And here's Mister shapeless.
00:55:16.148 - 00:55:40.970, Speaker A: And again, it looks like Mister Shapeless is also using, you know, maybe mid journey v five, which is maybe why his prompts look a little more realistic, I'm guessing. So just a work out there. Good night, fam. So interesting experimentation. And of course, this is Tuks, who is also experimenting. Sunday chill vibes. So nice kind of abstract piece here from took so tons of experimentation, just putting them out on Twitter.
00:55:40.970 - 00:56:06.854, Speaker A: This finally is Luciana Guerra and she has a show. A few hours left until Abstractus exhibition opens its doors. So here is her work in the gallery and it's looking great. So again, look at all that. I wonder, these look like the digital works, maybe printed out, so maybe a combination. Look how good that looks from a distance. So beautiful installation here.
00:56:06.854 - 00:56:31.780, Speaker A: This, you wonder if this is digital or painted. Anyways, this all looks great. So just very cool work. Kind of looks like it's printed, doesn't it? But it's hard to say. It's actually hard to say what's going on here. Anyway, interesting works here in a physical art show, that much we know. And also walk with a skateboarder.
00:56:31.780 - 00:57:05.200, Speaker A: That was pretty nice. No comment there. Just a nice tweet of an image and just a cool skateboarding work by walk. And look at this. I mean, really reminiscent of that artist whose name escapes me right now, who is a contemporary artist who does these kind of words across, but not with spray paint. But I guess the reason I'm showing this is, again, we see walks a masterful use of spray paint here. I mean, these sprays are gorgeous and so makes it look very, very easy pay.
00:57:05.200 - 00:57:31.998, Speaker A: And here's Rata out in the real world this time. We went to New York City to stay for a while, where many. So the rat legion is out and about, using the bricks as pixelation. So a very nice treatment or example of rata on the street there. So that would is pretty cool. And here is niche again. So we're going more into physical, almost sculptural work here.
00:57:31.998 - 00:57:55.530, Speaker A: Interesting piece. I mean, it almost looks like a certificate of authenticity with a bunch of, you know, sculptural paint over top. So just kind of interesting there. And yoa o Salazar, compressed narratives, plasticine in an acrylic box. So also pushing things and looking like people in a box here. So that doesn't look very. That looks pretty hard to make.
00:57:55.530 - 00:58:05.618, Speaker A: So cool work from. Uh oh. And you see the 404 in the background there. And here's some more physical work by Yoao. So. Showing some range. So beautiful watercolor work.
00:58:05.618 - 00:58:25.628, Speaker A: Organizing some watercolors. So. And I just like the composition, too, just like, you know, pieces of the modern world here. Computers, game boys, mobile phones. Really nice kind of watercolor versions of what looks like yo ao subject matter. And that is your show, everyone. Thank you for joining me again.
00:58:25.628 - 00:58:29.724, Speaker A: I hope you're having a wonderful May day. And until next time, take care.
