00:00:02.360 - 00:00:41.018, Speaker A: She is one of the most unusual artists in the digital art space with her animated cosmic bugs. Today we're talking to Rinne fish to unravel the mysteries behind her strange and wonderful art practice. Artist Journal, June 21, 2023. Broadcasting live from Berlin and New York City on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show Rune tune. How is your week going? Good morning.
00:00:41.066 - 00:01:00.554, Speaker B: And good afternoon. It's going great. The girlfriend is away again. She's visiting her sisters. So I took this opportunity of her absence to organize and clean up my art space, which, if she was here, she would be trying to micromanage. So.
00:01:03.014 - 00:01:04.294, Speaker A: That is hilarious.
00:01:04.454 - 00:01:20.914, Speaker B: I'm. I did a little spring cleaning in the process, I found a bunch of materials that rather than throw them out, I decided to use to paint my backyard. It's been a good week. Well, have you found an apartment yet?
00:01:22.354 - 00:01:53.496, Speaker A: Basically the ink is not on the paper yet, but there is an agreement in principle. What would you call it? A memorandum of understanding of sorts. Mou. So that is good. It's funny. It was the first option, and then I thought it was all right at first, but then I saw the other options, which in theory were even nicer. But then I realized I want to live in a new neighborhood, and I also wanted to live preferably by myself and all that sort of thing.
00:01:53.496 - 00:02:23.884, Speaker A: So at the end of the day, by going to the other places, I realized I really liked the first option. And it's a luxury, I tell you, out here, there's probably two options, and I'd even call them one and a half. I'm not even sure the second option was an option. So I was pretty lucky because I had to do it pretty quick. You know what they call it out here is Eigenbadarf. And that is when the landlord moves back in. I got an eigenbadarf, so, yeah, I had to move within three months.
00:02:23.884 - 00:02:38.964, Speaker A: And so, anyways, I'm actually pretty thrilled, to be honest, about how everything's going. And it's kind of, you know, it's not ideal that it's during the summer, but it's, you know, you just got to be happy. You find a place to live and you're not paying through the nose for it, you know?
00:02:40.144 - 00:02:41.080, Speaker C: You know, that's.
00:02:41.192 - 00:02:53.080, Speaker B: I'm glad that you are. You're feeling optimistic about that. Sometimes a change like that can be really, really just. It can kind of clear out all the cobwebs, mentally, spiritually emotionally.
00:02:53.232 - 00:03:13.444, Speaker A: Beautifully put. And even, like, I feel like the show itself will have a reboot of sorts. It's funny, I was messaging with cogolitis, actually, we talked on Discord, where I've never talked before, and he's also. He's mentioning something about an overlay, so we'll see. We'll see how that turns out. I think it could be really cool. He said something just really neutral, which sounds awesome.
00:03:13.444 - 00:03:16.814, Speaker A: He's also saying real quick, how long.
00:03:16.894 - 00:03:18.062, Speaker B: Have you been in your apartment?
00:03:18.118 - 00:03:20.942, Speaker A: I've been here for four years. It'll be exactly four years.
00:03:21.038 - 00:03:21.342, Speaker C: Wow.
00:03:21.398 - 00:03:22.034, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:03:22.814 - 00:03:26.494, Speaker B: Is that a long time for the people of Berlin who rent?
00:03:26.534 - 00:03:52.878, Speaker A: You know, it's really interesting you ask these days, increasingly so, like, back in the day, regular contracts where they're kind of unlimited were more common. And now almost everything you see is a temporary contract. Because, yeah, it's just the nature of the market here and the rules and everything, because you get, you know, like, I don't think the landlord's moving back in here, but he kicks me out, he can double the rent.
00:03:53.046 - 00:03:54.046, Speaker C: Like, literally.
00:03:54.190 - 00:04:00.558, Speaker B: Yeah, yeah, I. I figured that was the case. The way you said the landlord's moving.
00:04:00.606 - 00:04:02.742, Speaker C: Back in, like, yeah.
00:04:02.838 - 00:04:04.158, Speaker B: I would just naturally assume.
00:04:04.206 - 00:04:25.230, Speaker A: Yeah, it's just the nature of the situation. But other than that, I'm actually extremely, extremely excited and I can talk about this a little bit. Ordinals, I think I'm, you know, I just met with the team, one of the main guy of the team of these guys that are doing ordinals. I'm going to re release the peloponnesian war on bitcoin. So that is incredibly exciting.
00:04:25.302 - 00:04:27.822, Speaker C: Oh, wow.
00:04:27.958 - 00:04:29.262, Speaker A: Isn't that exciting?
00:04:29.438 - 00:04:32.054, Speaker B: I might need to ask you a few questions about ordinals.
00:04:32.094 - 00:04:32.470, Speaker A: You've got.
00:04:32.502 - 00:04:33.734, Speaker B: You've piqued my curiosity.
00:04:33.774 - 00:04:52.234, Speaker A: I will hopefully be the person to talk to in a couple of weeks here, and it may be released as soon as a couple of weeks, and then mine's going to be the test case, and after that, if everything goes according to plan, of course, you know, but mine will be the test case, and then after that it'll be okay because they want more art on bitcoin.
00:04:52.534 - 00:04:57.102, Speaker B: And have you talked to purple drank? Doesn't he have some experience with ordinal?
00:04:57.158 - 00:05:21.022, Speaker A: I'll have to. I'll have to, because what's interesting is, like, finally. And then we'll get to runny fish here, but what's so interesting about it is, you know, like, because gogolitis was. I was mentioning this to Golitis. He's saying, you know, I tried to mint on ordinals, but I had, like, a 15 kilobyte file, and it would have cost me $100. Sounds like the guys I'm talking to have a solution for that. So that is pretty interesting, because that was one of the big stumbling blocks.
00:05:21.022 - 00:05:30.566, Speaker A: But after the test case goes out, then. Yeah, like, they want art, so. And I'm happy to kind of funnel people over, so to speak. And so it could be a hell of a lot of fun.
00:05:30.670 - 00:05:30.958, Speaker B: Yeah.
00:05:31.006 - 00:05:41.014, Speaker A: So stay tuned on that. Riddy fish. I'm so excited and happy to have you on. Where are you calling from? How are you doing?
00:05:41.514 - 00:05:42.562, Speaker D: Can you hear me?
00:05:42.658 - 00:05:44.374, Speaker A: I can hear you loud and clear.
00:05:44.674 - 00:05:45.402, Speaker C: Oh, great.
00:05:45.498 - 00:05:46.254, Speaker A: Welcome.
00:05:46.874 - 00:05:54.374, Speaker D: Hi. Apocal Valley. Ruton, I want to say thanks for having me here. This is such a great honor.
00:05:55.234 - 00:06:02.578, Speaker A: Well, yeah, the honor is ours. I mean, you're such an awesome artist here. Yeah.
00:06:02.626 - 00:06:04.134, Speaker C: We're excited to have you.
00:06:04.474 - 00:06:15.054, Speaker D: Oh, thank you. I was actually listening to your channel time to time with some of my artist friend risatio. You always mention about his art in your channel.
00:06:16.234 - 00:06:17.802, Speaker C: Of course, yeah.
00:06:17.858 - 00:06:26.494, Speaker D: Yeah. Recently, I just went full time off my art, quit my job.
00:06:27.154 - 00:06:30.658, Speaker A: You're kidding. Congratulations. I mean, that is exciting.
00:06:30.706 - 00:06:31.988, Speaker B: Yeah, congratulations.
00:06:32.036 - 00:06:32.740, Speaker A: That's huge.
00:06:32.812 - 00:06:44.824, Speaker D: Yeah. This is not the great time. I think everybody's just too stressed out. Even some of my friends, they are kind of struggling.
00:06:45.604 - 00:07:15.454, Speaker A: Yeah, well, it's the nature of the market, you know? But that makes your move even more courageous. And you know the saying, fortune favors the bold? I think that's actually in the Aeneid. Fortune favors the bold. So, you know, and it's like, I think that's great that you're, you know, that you mentioned that, because it actually makes me go, oh, I should really pick up one of Rinny Fish's work because she's living off this stuff, and I want to make sure buy Rinne fish a little food here.
00:07:15.874 - 00:07:17.814, Speaker D: Oh, that would be amazing.
00:07:18.754 - 00:07:32.086, Speaker A: That is great. And I see Rosaceo out there. Big shout out to Rosaceo. Maybe we bring you on stage later, too, or sooner, but. So tell us about your art, rinny Fish. And again, congratulations. And what country are you calling from? And you don't need to tell us.
00:07:32.110 - 00:07:33.274, Speaker C: If you don't want to.
00:07:34.974 - 00:07:36.262, Speaker D: I'm based in China.
00:07:36.438 - 00:07:38.190, Speaker A: Oh, you're in China. Okay. Yeah.
00:07:38.262 - 00:07:38.958, Speaker E: Wow.
00:07:39.126 - 00:07:49.234, Speaker A: That's cool. So this is so exciting. So tell us about your story. Was there art school? And how did you get started in this whole art business?
00:07:51.994 - 00:08:42.464, Speaker D: Hello, guys. My name is Renee Fish I like to create bugs and some weird delicate looking creatures. Started my nft journey from 2020. After that I started my art exhibition journey around the world. Actually those bugs went to Berlin, Tokyo, New York and also lots of places I've never been before, especially during the COVID time I was at home and they went traveling a lot. And then I got some chance to work with some musicians, producers, also fashion brands and magazines. Yeah, quit my job last month.
00:08:42.464 - 00:09:10.274, Speaker D: I was a designer before. I want to say quitting is amazing. I can sleep better now, but meanwhile I don't really want to put myself in a low income situation. So I got to create more and find a balance because I also want more people to see it, to see those bugs. Thank you.
00:09:10.574 - 00:09:26.014, Speaker A: Well, yeah, I'm totally excited. And if this show can help more people see the bugs, that excites me and I can't wait to ask you more about them, but just a little bit more on the background. So you said you were a designer? Like a graphic designer, a fashion designer.
00:09:26.054 - 00:09:27.554, Speaker C: Another kind of designer?
00:09:27.934 - 00:09:34.154, Speaker D: No, I was doing graphic and also user interface for a while.
00:09:34.794 - 00:09:42.778, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah, I did that. I did graphic design, I guess from God, was it five years maybe?
00:09:42.866 - 00:09:43.346, Speaker C: I did it.
00:09:43.370 - 00:09:48.402, Speaker A: And a lot of I love actually user interface, graphic design.
00:09:48.458 - 00:09:50.614, Speaker C: Do you like it too or not?
00:09:50.914 - 00:09:53.734, Speaker D: I prefer user interface design.
00:09:54.234 - 00:09:55.294, Speaker A: I love it.
00:09:55.834 - 00:10:06.284, Speaker D: I think it's more clear than graphic, but both of them are struggling to me. So I just choose to be a full time artist.
00:10:06.904 - 00:10:07.304, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:10:07.344 - 00:10:23.804, Speaker A: I'm so thrilled for you. And again, you live once, so it's a very bold decision. So tell us about the bugs a little bit. Why bugs? And is it just something that kind of. Where did this come from? And what's the genesis of the bugs?
00:10:24.424 - 00:11:03.142, Speaker D: Sure. At the beginning I started out creating girls and the fish men. I made some comics for them and gradually they settled down in my art. I call it m seven planet. You still can find them in my art sometimes. What I like about them is they're all small. Before they are some kind of ordinary human character in life they are extremely small or normal.
00:11:03.142 - 00:11:50.696, Speaker D: So I'm just obsessed with some tiny and small and soft stories and creatures. The reason I think maybe because I was moving with my family a lot. When I chill high school, I feel like I never have a place to settle down. So those small objects and bugs makes me feel secure or to me it's easy to handle. Like even now it kind of influenced my life. I never bought a lot of things because I rented a very small apartment. Before there was.
00:11:50.696 - 00:12:08.404, Speaker D: I remember there was a swedish magazine interviewed me. Like, they asked me, what's my collection in the digital life and real life? I find out I only have some very functional canvas bags collection in my real life.
00:12:08.784 - 00:12:09.352, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:09.448 - 00:12:14.484, Speaker D: That's my simple story of creating those small creatures.
00:12:15.324 - 00:12:23.236, Speaker B: Well, I like this description of, you know, the bugs make you kind of feel secure. I think one thing that I get from your art when I look at.
00:12:23.260 - 00:12:26.788, Speaker C: It is, you know, you kind of.
00:12:26.836 - 00:12:33.064, Speaker B: You see these bugs and you automatically are transported to this world that's much smaller than your own.
00:12:33.444 - 00:12:34.224, Speaker C: Yes.
00:12:37.484 - 00:12:40.760, Speaker B: And it reminds me of a few. Have you seen the movie? Fantastic plot?
00:12:40.852 - 00:12:51.632, Speaker D: Yeah, I love it. I remember I was watching a french version. I don't really, I don't understand french, but I think the french version, I think it's better than.
00:12:51.688 - 00:12:53.244, Speaker B: I think it's a french film.
00:12:55.904 - 00:12:56.448, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:12:56.536 - 00:13:06.804, Speaker D: Okay, I'll make a search. I watched it like three times after the first french version I watched in english subtitles.
00:13:09.664 - 00:13:26.044, Speaker A: Well, very interesting, super interesting. And so I have a couple of questions just on how you got started with NFTs then, Renny Fish. I mean, did you start on Tasos or did you start on Ethereum? Because you have works here on foundation and on object.
00:13:28.544 - 00:13:40.254, Speaker D: I don't know. I think most of the artists from Ethereum. Right. Because Tezos hiking was born after that, as I remember.
00:13:41.034 - 00:13:41.386, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:13:41.410 - 00:13:43.186, Speaker A: So you started on Ethereum then?
00:13:43.290 - 00:13:44.414, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:13:45.514 - 00:14:07.064, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah, I guess I did too. I mean, it's interesting because a lot of artists do start on, you know, started on hen and which I can never pronounce. I still am like hick at nunc or. Yeah, everybody else seems to have no problem there. Okay, so you started on Ethereum and then. So what made you go over to Tezos then?
00:14:09.844 - 00:14:45.978, Speaker D: Yeah, some of my artist friends recommend that, like, at that time and every. I think lots of artists just want to give a try on different kind of chain or platforms at that time. Just a lot of platform just blow up and he cannot. I think I really enjoyed that, but unfortunately there was some problem for a while.
00:14:46.146 - 00:15:27.136, Speaker A: Sure, yeah, well, I mean, it's what I like about it. And, yeah, I kind of had a similar trajectory where I started on ETH and then, you know, as it kind of got kind of popular, I was a little later, like, I think I actually minted after hen kind of shut down because it was in December, I think, of 2021 and so. And I think it shut down in like November, if I'm not mistaken. And. Yeah, but I was similar to you? I kind of. There was enough of a buzz going on with, like, the few artist friends that I had on Twitter that I kind of felt like it was, you know, it's a new market, it's other collectors. So why wouldn't you.
00:15:27.280 - 00:15:29.084, Speaker C: Right? Mm hmm.
00:15:29.544 - 00:15:30.284, Speaker A: So.
00:15:30.784 - 00:15:34.644, Speaker D: And also make. Made a lot of friends there from this community.
00:15:35.264 - 00:15:56.702, Speaker A: Well, exactly. And then there was so much great art on there that you also just want to make sure you're a part of it. I mean, the purely practical reasons, it's like, this whole thing could blow up is what I was thinking. Like, this thing, like camp, you know, in a sense, it's amazing. It hasn't blown up more than it has. Although maybe it's bigger than we might realize at the same time. So very interesting.
00:15:56.702 - 00:16:02.714, Speaker A: And I guess. I guess. And then you started selling editions as well, I assume.
00:16:03.014 - 00:16:13.314, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. Multiple editions, basically. They are on tezos. I don't really sell multiple editions on Ethereum.
00:16:14.264 - 00:16:22.444, Speaker A: That's what I see. And I also see the art seems slightly different. Is that a fair comment?
00:16:24.264 - 00:16:25.880, Speaker D: You can say anything you want.
00:16:26.032 - 00:16:30.004, Speaker A: Well, just in terms of. Is that an accurate comment, in your opinion?
00:16:31.784 - 00:16:33.524, Speaker D: I don't really heard about it.
00:16:35.504 - 00:17:03.094, Speaker B: I think, you know, for the most part, it's like the backgrounds are a little bit different than the stuff that you put on foundation. It's more like central figure. You know, just like, compositionally, things are a little bit different. It's a little more versus the stuff on foundation, which is, you know, more all over compositions and less, you know, it just. It does seem a little bit different. I actually didn't really think about that until pokebelly pointed that out.
00:17:04.314 - 00:17:33.470, Speaker D: Yeah. I was thinking my art was always, like, not. Not that enough to me. So I didn't really figure out, like, what kind of style. Should I put it here? Or only there is, like, a different collection. Like, there is a buck marathon collection. I think it's good to be multiple editions and people can.
00:17:33.470 - 00:17:38.566, Speaker D: Can enjoy more about the stories there. I don't know.
00:17:38.710 - 00:18:03.406, Speaker A: Yeah. And even from a financial point of view, I kind of. That's one of the things I really love about Tezos. I mean, it's kind of been a discussion point as of late or recently that, I mean, part of the, like, it's easier to sell on Tezos because it's so much cheaper. Right. Like, let's say you sell works, you know, for $1,000 on Ethereum. Well, you're not necessarily going to sell a work every day.
00:18:03.406 - 00:18:16.310, Speaker A: Right. But if you're on Tazos if you. I'm sure if you loaded up a new work on Tazos, you'd probably sell out, you know, your 1525 copies within the day because they're maybe $10 or whatever the price is.
00:18:16.382 - 00:18:16.994, Speaker C: Right.
00:18:18.134 - 00:18:19.634, Speaker D: It is much easier.
00:18:20.214 - 00:18:32.130, Speaker A: So it's nice for that. Like, in a sense, Tezos is just from the purely economic point of view. It's really nice for that regular money that you might need to make rent or whatever the case may be.
00:18:32.242 - 00:18:32.894, Speaker C: Right?
00:18:33.394 - 00:18:35.574, Speaker D: Yep. That creates slope.
00:18:36.194 - 00:18:57.144, Speaker A: Exactly. You got cash flow there. So tell us a little bit more about the work here. So I see a lot of bugs, but I also see fish. I see what looks like some eastern imagery. And from what I understood, you also said you started in comics or, like, with a comic type thing. Is that correct? And where is this all going?
00:18:58.804 - 00:19:15.944, Speaker D: Comic is, like, some very early art than the artwork you can see here. They are not here. And do you want me to pick up one?
00:19:16.444 - 00:19:20.704, Speaker A: Yeah, actually, why don't you post a work? Can you post a work from where you are?
00:19:21.644 - 00:19:22.964, Speaker D: Let me search.
00:19:23.124 - 00:19:35.084, Speaker A: Otherwise, we can otherwise send it to Runetune, who knows how to post? I still don't know how to post a link, embarrassingly. And I deeply appreciate Runetune's help in that regard.
00:19:35.244 - 00:19:40.356, Speaker D: How about I introduce my pink art? Because I really like this one. It's my latest art.
00:19:40.460 - 00:19:45.052, Speaker A: Okay. Exciting. And this is on foundation or on object?
00:19:45.108 - 00:19:46.304, Speaker D: It's on foundation.
00:19:46.604 - 00:19:50.624, Speaker A: Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Let me just bring this up.
00:19:51.284 - 00:19:52.372, Speaker D: Can you see that?
00:19:52.508 - 00:20:00.724, Speaker A: Yeah, let me just. I'm gonna bring it up. So why don't you tell us about the work? What is going on in the work?
00:20:03.184 - 00:20:53.732, Speaker D: I created this one last month, and the theme is moon music and spring. And I want to put extra love in this piece because I think spring should be full of energy, life. Snails, like everything, wake up from the winter. And in chinese myth, if you talk about full moon, it's also a symbol of unity and happiness. So the rabbit is actually a very classic creature in the myth. It works hard for a lady who lives in the moon. But actually, it was a sad story because she can never meet the man she loves.
00:20:53.732 - 00:21:24.694, Speaker D: So I didn't really portray her story because I think the animal just much more simple than human being. So I want to highlight those creatures. The rabbit is holding a heart in the middle. It's a party under the full moon, and there are a lot of. There are some human beings. You can see. There are some girls, but just transfer to the flowers and being quiet.
00:21:24.694 - 00:21:30.034, Speaker D: Yeah, that's the story of this piece and I made this rinny fish.
00:21:30.074 - 00:21:32.762, Speaker B: Could you talk a little bit about how you make these?
00:21:32.898 - 00:21:33.574, Speaker D: How.
00:21:34.874 - 00:21:35.410, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:21:35.482 - 00:21:37.058, Speaker B: Like, what do you use to make.
00:21:37.226 - 00:21:38.178, Speaker C: The work that you make?
00:21:38.226 - 00:21:39.334, Speaker D: You may 2.
00:21:41.234 - 00:21:45.276, Speaker B: Yeah, sure. Any information you might want to share?
00:21:45.380 - 00:22:03.744, Speaker D: Sure. Basically, I use procreate. I use iPad mostly. And for visual effect, I use Adobe premiere and final cut. That's the most main tools I use.
00:22:05.724 - 00:22:08.800, Speaker B: Very nice. I was just curious, are you.
00:22:08.832 - 00:22:15.776, Speaker D: Are you thinking about touch designer or something? Because Poco Valley was mentioned about that for a couple of times.
00:22:15.920 - 00:22:24.724, Speaker A: You read my mind. You read my mind for any fish. I was like, that circular pixelation. I'm like, is that touch designer? Do you use touch designer?
00:22:25.504 - 00:22:53.584, Speaker D: No, that's my future goal. I want to learn it, but I can see that the circular effect is something. Yeah. I really want to reach the similar effect as touch designer and because I saw some amazing art from some of my artist friend, Saiko Ehara. I don't know if you know her.
00:22:53.704 - 00:22:55.248, Speaker A: Exactly. That's exactly.
00:22:55.336 - 00:23:05.584, Speaker D: She's very great. And, yeah, her art kind of, like, inspired me, and I really want to try some new tool to make my art, too.
00:23:05.964 - 00:23:32.444, Speaker A: You know, I've heard really good things. We had a show on art tools, and just like, what? It's the latest art tools that people are using, and touch designer came up. It sounds like it's almost like coding, but you don't need to know how to code, like this sort of thing, which sounds amazing. I don't even know what that means, and there's almost too many things to explore. But. But, yeah. So that's really interesting that you're not using it.
00:23:32.444 - 00:24:00.544, Speaker A: And when I look at your work, one of the things that also hits me, and I'm curious to just bounce this idea off you, it kind of feels like a placenta of sorts. You know, you have that rabbit in the moon, but it almost feels like it's like a, you know, almost like this young sort of fetus, I guess, in a placenta that's growing. Does that cross your mind? I assume it does.
00:24:02.724 - 00:24:04.964, Speaker D: Can I ask, what is placenta?
00:24:05.044 - 00:24:15.516, Speaker A: Oh, that is when you have a baby that's growing in the mother's womb, then it kind of. Do you know what I'm talking about? When an unborn baby.
00:24:15.700 - 00:24:33.404, Speaker D: I got it. I got it. I remember that word you mentioned. Yeah. I think everything just. I really want to build some image. Like, everything is growing and.
00:24:33.404 - 00:24:49.992, Speaker D: Yeah, maybe. But actually in the middle around this rabbit, and I think it's a full moon, but, yeah, you can you can say that like it's a placenda.
00:24:50.168 - 00:24:51.616, Speaker A: Yeah, exactly. Perfect.
00:24:51.680 - 00:24:53.604, Speaker D: Okay, thank you.
00:24:55.064 - 00:25:24.824, Speaker A: Yeah, very cool. Very cool. And also, another thing that I wanted to talk about is the color. What I like about your work, one of the many things I like about your work is you have this very interesting use of color. It almost feels like these kind of what I would call, like, psychedelic pastels. So could you talk about the colors and why you decide on those kind of colors?
00:25:25.684 - 00:26:19.684, Speaker D: Yeah. Remember I mentioned about the comic before I create, I don't really use colors because I was kind of afraid to use colors in China before we went. Went to some, like, professional art, art academy school. You got to have some, like, art training or something. It's like class, and you have to draw some exact, paint some paintings that teacher like and. Or school likes. And, like, in south China, lots of colors they like, I think the school like, I mean, they like more like low key, not like my colors, and.
00:26:19.684 - 00:26:54.136, Speaker D: But at that time, I was really obsessed with those kind of, like, loud colors. My teacher also said, like, why are you using such cheesy colors? So I was kind of, like, afraid to use. Use them to create for a long time. But, like, one day I started to use, like, bread and some couple colors. And then just gradually. Yeah, I find the. I find the.
00:26:54.136 - 00:27:03.594, Speaker D: How to say that I find out how to use them well, how to use them to become my card.
00:27:04.734 - 00:27:06.434, Speaker A: It is recognizable.
00:27:06.774 - 00:27:09.014, Speaker B: Like, very recognizable.
00:27:09.134 - 00:27:09.998, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:27:10.166 - 00:27:11.634, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah.
00:27:12.254 - 00:27:13.102, Speaker C: Stylistically.
00:27:13.158 - 00:27:13.326, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:27:13.350 - 00:27:31.550, Speaker B: It just seems so unique to you. You know, it reminds me of, there's something about the way you. The texture and the color. It reminds me of, like, airbrush t shirts that you'd find at carnivals and, like, outdoor venues in the United States.
00:27:31.742 - 00:27:35.434, Speaker D: Uh huh. Like, straight, straight art.
00:27:36.854 - 00:27:37.634, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:27:38.094 - 00:27:58.674, Speaker A: And have you traveled much, rinne fish, with your art? Like, you mentioned, you were showing work in, you know, New York as part of, I think you said as part of a fashion, you know, thing. Can you talk about the fashion side of things? And if you've traveled much, have you been able to travel much and tell us about the fashion thing, too?
00:27:59.374 - 00:28:40.036, Speaker D: Yeah, I think in the last couple years, I don't really travel, but I like social media, so I post a lot of my art there. And fashion brands like Instagram, one of them just dm me and I think two of them and find me to make some commission art for them and another italian brand, and they want me to create a bug, create some bugs for their new collection. So, yeah, my fashion work basically from.
00:28:40.100 - 00:28:44.384, Speaker A: Instagram, that is so cool. Sorry. Continue, continue.
00:28:46.924 - 00:28:47.724, Speaker D: That's all.
00:28:47.844 - 00:29:12.414, Speaker A: Okay, okay. Sorry, I thought I interrupted you. That is so interesting. I mean, you see it with strange thing. Of course, the AI artist and, you know, he was in vogue Italia and seems to kind of have a fashion thing going on, too, also on Instagram. That's really, like, I haven't heard though, too many people. I mean, it's pretty amazing that these brands, I guess they really resonate with the bugs.
00:29:12.414 - 00:29:22.524, Speaker A: Like, there's something about it and what are they doing with it? Are they putting it on a t shirt or more than that? Are they taking the patterns and making pants? Like, what are they doing with your art?
00:29:24.024 - 00:30:10.526, Speaker D: One of them, they put my art for their new collection. Put my art on their t shirt. Another one, I think they got different strategy. Like Paul and Bear. They just want artists to create some, how, say, like, pr material to build up their brand. You don't really design something for them, but you, they hire different artists and make some. Some art for their, for the, for their shoes or clothes, and they don't really produce that.
00:30:10.526 - 00:30:19.064, Speaker D: They just, they just want them to, they just want more people to think their brand is cool and because they can hire a lot of artists.
00:30:19.224 - 00:30:27.528, Speaker B: And so these fashion brands, are they, they're finding you and they're asking you for your work or is this something you kind of went to them?
00:30:27.696 - 00:30:36.712, Speaker D: No, I don't think if I find them, they will. They will notice me. They. Someone just find me from social media.
00:30:36.808 - 00:31:01.362, Speaker A: Very cool. Yeah, absolutely. And so welcome, everybody. And we have a very nice, beautiful crowd here of wonderful people. So if you want to join us on stage and ask Rinne Fish about her art, maybe you're a collector of Rinne fishes, or I might also send out some prank invites here to the stage. That would also be wonderful. I see waffle there with some news over there.
00:31:01.362 - 00:31:26.894, Speaker A: Retro Manny, Mikey, de la creme, Rosatio and Santiago and more. So welcome, everyone. Just put a request in and we will bring you up on stage. Stage. And so, Rooney fish, what's next? Where are you going with this? Is there a direction or is there, is it simply make more interesting images and is there a path in your mind?
00:31:28.634 - 00:32:14.434, Speaker D: Yeah, currently I think you got to prepare more art and being more productive and, yeah, get more chance to expand my art in different places. I hope I can travel around to meet more curators or my artist friend. And I don't really think so far, like two years or three years or five years. Now what I'm focusing is finding my balance to to get stable income and keep, keep my creating.
00:32:14.734 - 00:32:15.474, Speaker C: Like.
00:32:17.294 - 00:32:18.374, Speaker D: Keep creating.
00:32:18.494 - 00:32:18.774, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:32:18.814 - 00:32:20.814, Speaker D: Consistent. Yeah.
00:32:20.974 - 00:32:26.654, Speaker A: Consistently and just kind of, in a sense, really kind of. It sounds to me like develop your practice.
00:32:26.774 - 00:32:27.078, Speaker C: Right.
00:32:27.126 - 00:32:43.654, Speaker A: Like turn this into a grow this thing, kind of almost grow your business to a certain degree. So in that respect, I mean, I feel like I've seen you tweet out maybe a month or two ago, something physical. Weren't you making prints?
00:32:45.594 - 00:32:52.530, Speaker D: I do some prints. I put some prints on my website, reallyfish.com.
00:32:52.682 - 00:33:09.314, Speaker A: I was gonna say, yeah, feel free to post your website as well because maybe it's easy for people to just click on and. Yeah, so very cool. So tell us about the printmaking then, because those are still. So do you simply do inkjet print or do you do something more elaborate?
00:33:11.774 - 00:33:13.678, Speaker D: Sorry, I don't really understand that.
00:33:13.726 - 00:33:31.954, Speaker A: Oh, no problem at all. When you print out your works, do you simply, is it a fairly simple process where you just get some nice paper and put it in a printer or ask a printer to print it, or do you do something more complicated?
00:33:33.854 - 00:33:49.994, Speaker D: Yeah, if I think some of them, which I put them on my website, I made some others buy some factory like professional studio.
00:33:50.434 - 00:33:51.174, Speaker C: And.
00:33:53.274 - 00:34:14.494, Speaker D: Another part of them are in Italy because I had just had my solo exhibition in Milan and they helped me create some very. How is it that jelly and complicated frames and I think that part of Frank only sell in Italy.
00:34:15.514 - 00:34:22.184, Speaker A: Right. I think that's what I saw, actually. Now that. And you, you posted that on twitter, didn't you?
00:34:22.724 - 00:34:24.684, Speaker D: Yeah, I did.
00:34:24.844 - 00:34:25.548, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:34:25.596 - 00:34:25.780, Speaker C: So.
00:34:25.812 - 00:34:27.904, Speaker A: And those are for sale on your website?
00:34:28.604 - 00:34:40.344, Speaker D: Yeah, you can see some part of them are from, like, colab. Hold on. Collab products. Product collab.
00:34:40.684 - 00:34:41.476, Speaker C: And.
00:34:41.660 - 00:34:44.974, Speaker D: And some part of them are prints.
00:34:45.834 - 00:34:47.334, Speaker A: Okay, excellent. So.
00:34:49.114 - 00:35:02.294, Speaker B: Some of the titles for your prints are really funny. Actually, a lot of the titles for your work is sometimes really funny to me. There's one that you have called pure Halloween special. And then in parentheses, no pumpkin. Only tomato.
00:35:02.714 - 00:35:05.454, Speaker D: Yes, there's no pumpkin.
00:35:07.754 - 00:35:09.588, Speaker A: You have a very nice website.
00:35:09.746 - 00:35:10.520, Speaker C: Uh, Renny Fish.
00:35:10.552 - 00:35:11.000, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:35:11.072 - 00:35:12.080, Speaker A: Yeah. And look at this.
00:35:12.112 - 00:35:13.964, Speaker D: I've built all my best self.
00:35:14.264 - 00:35:20.604, Speaker A: Yeah, very nice. It's very kind of easy to navigate and everything. And you're on super rare too.
00:35:21.264 - 00:35:22.320, Speaker C: This is great.
00:35:22.432 - 00:35:32.056, Speaker A: I didn't realize that. So there you are. Okay, excellent. So, yeah, that should be on your.
00:35:32.200 - 00:35:34.644, Speaker C: Twitter because I missed that actually.
00:35:34.984 - 00:35:46.224, Speaker A: There you are. So this is wonderful. So tell us about Milan then. How did that show come about? And who is that a group show? Is that a solo show? What's happening in Milan with briny fish.
00:35:48.244 - 00:36:24.952, Speaker D: It was a solo exhibition, the Arctic exhibition. The name of that is we want to turn the body to the brain. And the curator is. I don't know, it's just someday a curator, I think the gallery owner of the gallery, and she just messaged me on. Also on Instagram. And she was like, I do want to join our upcoming solo exhibition. Like winter, I think she contacted me on summer.
00:36:24.952 - 00:36:41.508, Speaker D: So it's been like half a year. And I don't know if it's usual. You have to prepare a solo station for a long time. But at the beginning, I thought they are like a lot of scammers.
00:36:41.596 - 00:36:42.252, Speaker A: Yeah, totally.
00:36:42.308 - 00:37:04.074, Speaker D: And after half a year. Yeah, just happening from January to March. And it goes well in Milan. It was a very small gallery, and I think they are focusing on bringing more asian artists to Italy.
00:37:04.734 - 00:37:25.318, Speaker A: Yeah, well, I think that's great. You know, as the world gets more and more conflict, I think it's great in the arts here that people are building bridges. I think it's a wonderful thing. And look at your now on your Instagram. No wonder. I mean, you're doing very, very well on your Instagram. I mean, 14,000 followers.
00:37:25.318 - 00:37:51.564, Speaker A: And, you know, those top tweets there have 1200 likes, 900 likes. No wonder they're reaching out to you. So, yeah, I mean, and there you are in OMBD on a billboard. I mean, yeah, you have a wonderful, very focused Instagram there. So again, I guess one of the takeaways, one of the lessons here for us is the importance of Instagram still.
00:37:54.764 - 00:38:12.664, Speaker D: Yeah, I think Twitter and Instagram both works very well to me as a full time artist, I think, same as other artists, and we have to put out our extra time to our social media.
00:38:13.444 - 00:38:21.756, Speaker A: Exactly. I mean, it sounds like the great majority of your opportunities have been a result of your social media. I mean, I guess that's true for.
00:38:21.780 - 00:38:23.524, Speaker C: Many of us, isn't it?
00:38:24.784 - 00:38:28.804, Speaker D: Yeah, I think so. Social media is important.
00:38:29.384 - 00:38:36.684, Speaker A: Yes, indeed it is. Indeed it is. Okay, so tell us, do you have any shows coming up? What's next for you?
00:38:41.624 - 00:39:19.126, Speaker D: Currently, I have an exhibition in a group exhibition in Singapore, and there will be some new jobs coming soon by unknown collector. And I think lots of people know him or her. I don't really know that account that pronouns is her or him. Just currently just creating more upcoming jobs.
00:39:19.310 - 00:39:20.054, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:39:20.214 - 00:39:34.574, Speaker A: Okay, excellent. So a Singapore show, that's very exciting. And, yeah, I actually was. I just heard from unknown collector and I actually. I think I can. I'm gonna try unknown collector. Put out a really nice tweet about these spaces that we're doing.
00:39:34.574 - 00:40:05.430, Speaker A: So I'm gonna see. That reminds me, I'm gonna see if unknown collector wants to show up and maybe we'll find out. Or at least we can have a guess if it's a he or a she, if we hear the audio, if they're willing to come on, which would be pretty exciting. So. Okay, very good. So you have some, you have some show in Singapore. And what else? What have we not talked about with your work here? Like, what do you want people to know about your artwork? Granny Fish, you have a few people here listening to you.
00:40:05.430 - 00:40:07.394, Speaker A: What do you want people to know about your work?
00:40:09.534 - 00:40:10.514, Speaker D: Bugs.
00:40:11.014 - 00:40:11.994, Speaker A: Bugs.
00:40:13.654 - 00:40:30.274, Speaker D: I don't know. I don't know what kind of things other people want to know me more, basically. I post a lot. Any, like, working progress? I post a lot in finnish arts. I post a lot.
00:40:32.134 - 00:40:32.574, Speaker A: Okay.
00:40:32.614 - 00:40:33.006, Speaker D: I'm very.
00:40:33.070 - 00:40:36.328, Speaker B: Would you say. Would you say you're more active on Instagram?
00:40:36.486 - 00:40:46.824, Speaker D: I think I post some daily stuff on IG story. Twitter is more established stuff.
00:40:48.244 - 00:41:15.194, Speaker A: Interesting. And by the way, everyone, Rinny Fish's Instagram is awesome. I have discovered several new pieces there, new artists, and it does have its own flavor. And it doesn't seem like it's just, just the NFT scene. It's also kind of like the Instagram kind of, you know, scene a little bit. And so how about this, Rennie Fish, tell us about your influences. Like who are your major influences in your art?
00:41:17.454 - 00:41:18.194, Speaker C: Sure.
00:41:23.014 - 00:42:02.224, Speaker D: My mentor artist is Japanese. Our artist, Yoko Tadanori, I was inspired by him a lot, especially colors. And also most of those creatures, they are from my negative emotions. I had some emotion control issues. It's been really easy for me to rage or shut down. So I'm trying to. I'll find my peace and balance.
00:42:02.224 - 00:42:56.662, Speaker D: And so I think creating those bugs is one of the solutions. And also, I talked to my therapist about my art and my relationship with people. And she said, oh, she said, surprise, because it sounds like great listener. I never talk much or hard to say no in front of other people, but my art looks so loud to her. And I mentioned about that because lots of young people here recently, they are just obsessed with some MBTI tests, like some kind of personality typology test. And I don't know if you know it.
00:42:56.758 - 00:43:00.674, Speaker A: No, I've never heard of this. So this is kind of a bit of a thing in China.
00:43:01.374 - 00:43:05.958, Speaker D: Yeah, it's like a Meyer. The full name is like Myers Frazier.
00:43:06.086 - 00:43:12.654, Speaker A: Okay, vaguely, vaguely. But I. Yeah. So, okay. And it determines your personality type, is that right?
00:43:12.734 - 00:43:44.034, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. And it's trending here. And I definitely belong to I, but seems like e should be more. Yeah. Anyway, I'm still trying to figure out the connection with those creatures, and I guess they are my healing bug. They help me to say something I can't. And I think they are doing great.
00:43:44.574 - 00:43:59.594, Speaker A: Well, it's very interesting you mentioned personality, like, in a weird way. Do you consider these bugs as kind of, you know, projections or, you know, manifestations of your personality to a certain degree?
00:44:02.054 - 00:44:03.734, Speaker D: Sorry, I don't really understand that.
00:44:03.774 - 00:44:04.754, Speaker A: Sorry. That was.
00:44:06.414 - 00:44:07.982, Speaker D: Sorry for my poor English.
00:44:08.078 - 00:44:10.342, Speaker A: No, not at all. And you're doing wonderful.
00:44:10.478 - 00:44:10.798, Speaker C: Actually.
00:44:10.846 - 00:44:19.674, Speaker A: You're doing wonderful. Do you think the bugs, in a strange way or in an unusual way, are representations of yourself?
00:44:21.334 - 00:44:37.274, Speaker D: Sure. I think most of the artists there are just represent some part of themselves. So those dogs definitely are rich side of me. Of myself.
00:44:38.864 - 00:44:54.684, Speaker B: You know, you've told me how, you know, in your design classes, the professors or the teachers thought your colors were really loud. And then you, you know, you've mentioned your therapist saying that the art is very loud. Do you think of your art as being very loud?
00:44:55.944 - 00:45:00.256, Speaker D: Looks very loud, but it can make.
00:45:00.280 - 00:45:06.288, Speaker B: Me quiet, you know, because what's funny is when I look at your work, it's.
00:45:06.376 - 00:45:06.976, Speaker C: There's something.
00:45:07.040 - 00:45:07.416, Speaker B: There's like.
00:45:07.440 - 00:45:07.712, Speaker C: It's.
00:45:07.768 - 00:45:22.684, Speaker B: There's all this, like, soft texture and these kind of, like, glowing things. And to me, it seems actually very quiet, even though it's very colorful. It's very, like, serene, euphoric.
00:45:23.344 - 00:45:24.484, Speaker D: I like it.
00:45:25.504 - 00:45:26.284, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:45:29.524 - 00:45:52.428, Speaker A: And as far as displays, I noticed you have some projector of your work or projection of your work on Instagram here. Do you like the projection of your work the best? Because I like it myself. Just because it makes everything so big and almost just kind of delicious. Like, the art is just.
00:45:52.476 - 00:45:53.064, Speaker C: So.
00:45:53.964 - 00:46:01.654, Speaker A: Is that your favorite way of seeing your art as well? Or do you prefer it small? Do you have a favorite kind of way of displaying your work?
00:46:03.994 - 00:46:30.744, Speaker D: I think projector is not the best one, but I like huge screen. I put my art in Dubai twice, and they're super rich and their screen is like 16 meters, like 360 degree and looks huge. Immersive. I really like the way they showcase the art.
00:46:32.604 - 00:46:46.984, Speaker A: Me as well. Like, I think it looks incredible with this post I see here. I don't know if it was from Art Dubai. And so you were also at Art Dubai. And what happened there again was that just. Was that an NFT show? How did that come about.
00:46:49.884 - 00:46:53.190, Speaker D: Also, I want to say Instagram. Instagram.
00:46:53.262 - 00:46:55.754, Speaker A: Well, isn't that interesting, right?
00:46:56.454 - 00:47:08.074, Speaker D: Yeah. The curator likes to use Instagram to find artists, and they contact me and for their expression in Dubai.
00:47:09.614 - 00:47:50.994, Speaker A: Well, I think this is so important because sometimes in the, you know, Twitter, in the digital art, in the NFT space, we can be a little Twitter centric. And it's an important lesson here that there are other audiences on other platforms, and sometimes those audiences may be. Twitter is a little edgy for a lot of people. Most of the people I know are not on Twitter in my day to day life, but most of them are on Instagram. And that goes for a lot of the artists that I know out here that, you know, who make physical work, most of them are on Instagram. So it's a very important kind of lesson here.
00:47:51.614 - 00:47:53.334, Speaker B: Yeah, I've had the same experience.
00:47:53.494 - 00:47:55.414, Speaker C: Like, you know, I got an Instagram.
00:47:55.454 - 00:48:15.350, Speaker B: A long, long time ago, and I used it socially, you know, just posting whatever social stuff. And I didn't really focus on the art so much. And when I tried to make an account, just focused on art, it didn't seem to really move a whole lot. But what I like about Twitter is that it's all. It's strictly business, you know, just art stuff only.
00:48:15.462 - 00:48:51.716, Speaker A: That is so funny. And, you know, like, maybe a secret of Renny Fish's success is how incredibly focused the art is. And then once in a while, Rinny Fish puts her own picture and then another 20 pictures of art, and then her with the art and then another 20 pictures of art. It's a very easy to understand feed, so that is also important, I think, invaluable. And clearly, as well as the art itself, it's working for Renee Fish. Santiago, I'm so glad to have you here. Welcome to the stage calling from Uruguay.
00:48:51.900 - 00:48:52.660, Speaker C: Welcome to the show.
00:48:52.692 - 00:48:56.748, Speaker F: How are you? How are you guys doing? How's everyone doing?
00:48:56.916 - 00:48:59.796, Speaker A: Wonderful. I'd love to hear your voice.
00:48:59.860 - 00:49:00.836, Speaker B: Santiago.
00:49:01.020 - 00:49:02.304, Speaker D: Hi, Santiago.
00:49:03.424 - 00:49:04.896, Speaker F: Hi, Rennie Fish.
00:49:05.080 - 00:49:06.752, Speaker D: Nice to talk to you here.
00:49:06.888 - 00:49:08.044, Speaker C: I like your art.
00:49:09.544 - 00:49:42.254, Speaker F: I like your art very much, too. It's great to listen to you talking. So I had a question about the kind of material that is in your universe. Seems like watery or maybe like shelly. Shelly fish or shallow. I want to ask you, what do you have to say about that? It all looks like the glowing water to me.
00:49:47.674 - 00:49:48.898, Speaker A: You might be on mute.
00:49:48.946 - 00:49:49.894, Speaker C: Renny fish.
00:49:51.994 - 00:49:54.294, Speaker D: Oh, sorry, I didn't really hear.
00:49:56.634 - 00:50:00.988, Speaker A: Santiago was asking if about your work looking like.
00:50:01.076 - 00:50:06.424, Speaker C: Like water, this liquid quality to it. Yeah.
00:50:08.924 - 00:50:20.744, Speaker D: Um, I really like glowing things. So, um, yeah, just those glow. Gluey. How to say that?
00:50:22.084 - 00:50:23.644, Speaker A: Oh, glowing. Glowing.
00:50:23.724 - 00:50:56.904, Speaker D: Glowing. Yeah, yeah, glowing and liquid creatures. I feel those kind of texture makes me feel like what I mentioned, secure. And they are kind of coming from my childhood. And do you remember some cheap toy you had before the plastic void? Yeah, I think they're part of my childhood.
00:50:58.244 - 00:51:05.584, Speaker A: Yeah, I see what Santiago is saying. You even have fish in your work. It reminds me of jellyfish a little bit.
00:51:09.204 - 00:51:41.084, Speaker D: Yeah. At the beginning, I think girls and the fish, they show very. They show up more than bugs. And then gradually, I think bugs like coming, becoming the citizen in this planet, and you don't really see the human being there anymore. And now they're like more like different kind of creatures coming up.
00:51:42.024 - 00:51:49.864, Speaker A: It feels like the foundation for a, you know, animated series almost. Would you ever do anything like that?
00:51:53.804 - 00:51:54.772, Speaker D: Animation?
00:51:54.948 - 00:52:10.304, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, it seems like this could be almost like a cartoon in a sense, like. Or the foundation or the basic elements of a, you know, of an animated show of some kind. Would that ever interest you? Has that thought crossed your mind?
00:52:11.124 - 00:52:20.324, Speaker D: Yeah, thought about it before, but compared to animation, maybe I want to make games, like, more than animation.
00:52:20.864 - 00:52:21.216, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:52:21.240 - 00:52:47.574, Speaker D: Because I had a small experiment on Twitter before, and I let people to comment, like, choose a or b or c, and different story can go on and on, and lots of people join, and it's like some classic rpg game.
00:52:48.674 - 00:53:04.254, Speaker A: That is hilarious. Yeah, I would love to see that. I'd love to see that. We have hasdrubal Waffle has joined us on stage. A nice cameo appearance from Mister Waffle. Waffle. Welcome to the stage, and I assume calling from the United States.
00:53:04.254 - 00:53:08.554, Speaker A: How are you doing? And do you have a question for rinnefish?
00:53:11.494 - 00:53:12.486, Speaker E: Good morning.
00:53:12.670 - 00:53:14.366, Speaker A: Good morning. Good morning.
00:53:14.510 - 00:53:15.630, Speaker B: Good morning.
00:53:15.822 - 00:53:19.554, Speaker E: Sorry, I was eating. I was eating breakfast when you made the request earlier.
00:53:20.054 - 00:53:20.678, Speaker A: All good.
00:53:20.726 - 00:53:22.246, Speaker E: I didn't want to talk with my mouth full.
00:53:22.310 - 00:53:26.114, Speaker A: Yeah, all good. All good. So it's great to have you on the show.
00:53:26.414 - 00:53:53.864, Speaker E: Yeah, I had a comment and a question. Well, I guess the question was, ever seen any of the. Any of the work from the art collective paper rad from the United States? Because I get a real paper rad vibe from some of her work, especially some of the earliest stuff that she posted on pickup mink.
00:53:54.564 - 00:53:58.532, Speaker D: Oh, you mean print. Oh, you mean princess.
00:53:58.532 - 00:54:14.538, Speaker E: It's paper rad. P a p E r R a d. Paper rad. Or maybe there's only one paper rad pad. It's. They're an art collective out of Providence. Rhode island in the late nineties.
00:54:14.538 - 00:54:23.694, Speaker E: A lot of them were members of or attended RISD, the Rhode Island School of Design, and.
00:54:26.224 - 00:54:27.288, Speaker C: Sorry about that.
00:54:27.456 - 00:54:30.844, Speaker A: Good morning. Good morning.
00:54:33.824 - 00:55:05.466, Speaker E: But there, I guess like, yeah, it was kind of a quick thing, I think there was a tv show on Cartoon Network where one of the members, Ben Jones, had a, had a brief, a brief show called Problem Solvers. But it's a lot of neon colors and kind of, I guess, off the beaten path type characters that you wouldn't normally think of as characters in a show.
00:55:05.530 - 00:55:07.374, Speaker D: Who standards for me after?
00:55:08.714 - 00:55:11.202, Speaker E: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I think you'd really dig it.
00:55:11.258 - 00:55:12.054, Speaker D: Thank you.
00:55:13.274 - 00:55:32.384, Speaker E: And then my other comment was, I was curious if you were going to do any more pixel work on Apida, because I really love those. But those pieces almost never end up on secondary. They're really gorgeous.
00:55:32.504 - 00:55:45.484, Speaker D: Oh, thank you. I didn't really consider about a beetle, but if you. Yeah, if you mention, I don't know. Do you know anybody still creating there?
00:55:48.304 - 00:55:51.964, Speaker E: I'm not. I'm not sure. I see stuff pop up every now and again, but.
00:55:53.864 - 00:55:54.640, Speaker C: You know, I haven't.
00:55:54.672 - 00:55:55.844, Speaker E: Checked it out in a while.
00:55:57.024 - 00:55:58.364, Speaker D: I will check it out.
00:55:58.664 - 00:56:25.162, Speaker A: It is quite. It is quite beautiful. I'm looking at it now, and it does have a very interesting quality to it. It's interesting. Eight bedou, like everybody, you know, it brings their own thing to eight badoo. You know, it's such a limited palette, right? I mean, or a limited canvas, I should say eight pixels by eight pixels. It's incredible how different everything the, you know, you can see people's style.
00:56:25.162 - 00:57:02.130, Speaker A: Like, for instance, rinnefish. I can see the colors, and I find the colors in your work, rinne fish super interesting, actually, in terms of the backgrounds, say on object, you use a lot of just. I almost wonder if maybe it's because, you know, you grew up with, I don't know, in China with just different palettes because you have this very interesting. Like this, you know, almost neutral green. You love the almost a neutral purple. Not typical colors, I would imagine. In the background one, you have like a.
00:57:02.130 - 00:57:06.934, Speaker A: Almost like a yellow green with a bright orange.
00:57:08.074 - 00:57:08.538, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:08.586 - 00:57:17.054, Speaker A: So can you talk about that a bit or is it purely intuitive? I mean, you mentioned colors before, but is there anything more to say on that?
00:57:23.354 - 00:57:24.658, Speaker D: Is it background color?
00:57:24.786 - 00:57:28.774, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. Or is it just what works?
00:57:29.434 - 00:57:33.636, Speaker D: Yeah, it went by the works by the creatures.
00:57:33.810 - 00:57:34.600, Speaker C: Okay.
00:57:34.752 - 00:57:38.248, Speaker D: I didn't really think too much at the beginning.
00:57:38.376 - 00:57:38.680, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:57:38.712 - 00:57:43.512, Speaker A: So it's mostly intuitive then. And how long does it take you to make a work?
00:57:43.648 - 00:57:44.524, Speaker C: Generally.
00:57:46.744 - 00:58:20.804, Speaker D: It depends on how many bugs. If there is, like, a single bug in bug marathon, it takes definitely less than one week. But if there is, like, a full piece, like a reverse sad, I mean, some, like, more bucks, you can see probably, like two weeks or less than two weeks.
00:58:21.744 - 00:58:48.004, Speaker A: Okay, excellent. So, yeah, that's about what I would guess. But, I mean, a significant amount of time goes into each one of these works. And so just as we're wrapping up here, then another question I kind of had, and then I'll pass it to the floor to see if anybody else has any further questions as we wrap up here. Have you tried AI, artificial intelligence at all, like mid journey or anything like that? Or does that interest you at all?
00:58:51.264 - 00:58:51.888, Speaker D: Me?
00:58:52.016 - 00:58:53.314, Speaker C: Yes. Renee fish.
00:58:53.504 - 00:59:42.424, Speaker D: Okay. Sorry. I tried my journey a couple times, but just for the background creating, there was an exhibition in New York, and their screen is extremely weird and it's unusual. So I have to expand, extend the background because usually my art is square, as you see, and I have to extend different background for the screen to match the screen. So if some AI tool, like mid journey. Yeah, help me a little bit last time.
00:59:43.644 - 00:59:47.144, Speaker A: Interesting. So you'll use it to make the canvas bigger?
00:59:47.994 - 00:59:54.734, Speaker D: Yeah, I think only one time, but after that, I don't really use it. You're done for creating.
00:59:55.274 - 01:00:04.094, Speaker A: Okay, excellent. Well, does anybody have any further questions for rinnefish as we wrap up here? Waffle, do you have any final comments?
01:00:08.834 - 01:00:12.952, Speaker E: No, just keep doing what you're doing. Your work is amazing.
01:00:13.138 - 01:00:14.864, Speaker D: Oh, thank you. I will.
01:00:16.284 - 01:00:20.492, Speaker A: And also, sorry, we have a late comer to the stage here.
01:00:20.588 - 01:00:21.628, Speaker C: Oh, they disappeared.
01:00:21.676 - 01:00:23.108, Speaker A: Oh, here's phasel.
01:00:23.276 - 01:00:24.508, Speaker C: Well, let's add Basil.
01:00:24.556 - 01:00:34.624, Speaker A: Leah, you got here just in time. They are connecting on the stage. Faisal, welcome to the show. And where are you calling from.

01:00:41.384 - 01:00:42.152, Speaker C: Faisal?
01:00:42.248 - 01:00:44.644, Speaker A: Leah, you might be on mute.
01:00:45.224 - 01:00:48.044, Speaker C: Going once, going twice.
01:00:48.824 - 01:00:50.448, Speaker A: Well, Faisal, if you do.

I'm not sure what time that is in Nigeria, but if you look online, I'm sure we can figure that out. So again, welcome to the show and thank you for joining us up here.
01:01:46.914 - 01:01:51.574, Speaker C: Oh, sorry. Sorry. Are you there?
01:01:52.394 - 01:01:56.854, Speaker A: Okay, so anyways, as we wrap up, Santiago, any final thoughts?
01:01:58.774 - 01:02:12.966, Speaker F: Just that you are amazing reunion fish, and I love your art and the way you communicate with the rest of us in this Twitter nft twitter scene. You are amazing.
01:02:13.150 - 01:02:15.150, Speaker A: I would totally echo that.
01:02:15.342 - 01:02:16.674, Speaker D: Thank you so much.
01:02:17.534 - 01:02:26.206, Speaker A: Rinne Fish is a natural social media creature. She is quite good at what she does here. Rinnefish, any final thoughts before I turn.
01:02:26.230 - 01:02:27.474, Speaker C: It over to Runetun?
01:02:30.454 - 01:02:38.926, Speaker D: Just want to say thanks for having me here. I was flattered when I got the invitation from you.
01:02:39.110 - 01:02:40.514, Speaker A: Well, you know what?
01:02:40.814 - 01:02:45.674, Speaker D: Lots of my friends listen to our channel, and I think your audience are very cool.
01:02:46.414 - 01:03:15.892, Speaker A: Well, I especially agree with that second part that you mentioned. The audience is cool, and I'm really excited to hear that. And it's exciting to hear, like, you know, it's kind of mind blowing for me to think that, you know, people in China are watching the show. Like, that is incredibly exciting. Here we have our friend Faisal from Nigeria, you know, all the way Uruguay, you know, the United States. So it's incredibly exciting and, you know, long overdue. And don't be a stranger, Rinny Fish.
01:03:15.892 - 01:03:28.994, Speaker A: We'd love to have you back. You know, keep us updated on everything you're doing. Maybe in six months you do it again. And, yeah, again, the honor is ours. And Runetune, do you have any final thoughts as we wrap up here?
01:03:30.374 - 01:03:51.932, Speaker B: Congratulations on quitting your job and going full time artist. I wish you all the success. I'm going to send you a couple links to movies I think that you would appreciate, based on the bugs, the colors, the glowy stuff. It's been a pleasure to speak with you.
01:03:51.948 - 01:03:52.804, Speaker C: Renny Fish.
01:03:52.964 - 01:03:58.664, Speaker D: Well, that'll be amazing. Thank you so much. Yes, I had a great time.
01:03:58.964 - 01:04:17.570, Speaker A: I'm glad to hear that. And thank you, Renee Fish. Thank you to everybody that came on stage, Santiago waffle. And thank you, everybody who's listening in here.
