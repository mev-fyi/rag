00:00:05.560 - 00:00:29.114, Speaker A: As DJ Curo says, your mom is a legend. And I totally agree. I totally agree. Big shout out to mom and big shout out to DJ Curo and shout out to Haiti Rockette for wishing my brother a happy birthday. That was hilarious. Artist journal, May 18, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany.
00:00:29.114 - 00:00:53.674, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli with a sporting the 1990s cut. My hairdresser went nineties on me. I kind of like it though, on camera here, so maybe that works. Feel free to leave a comment below. Just half joking here. Anyways, welcome back everybody. I think it's going to be a fast show, quick show note as well.
00:00:53.674 - 00:01:25.720, Speaker A: I leave on a train tomorrow at like eleven or twelve in the morning or like noon, so I'm not sure if I'm going to make it to get a show. There will be a Twitter spaces next Wednesday and I think I'm going to do it on collecting. And just who are your favorite underrated artists? So something for the collectors and the artists out there. So stay tuned for that next week. Otherwise it'll be a week off here. I'll be back a week from Monday. There may be a show tomorrow, depending on how everything goes.
00:01:25.720 - 00:02:06.144, Speaker A: So you can probably guess the artist here, people who watch this show. Graphica PNg has another stunning work. I missed this. This came out May 13 and just, you know, putting it into words, you know, this image. We'll start from the basics here. I mean, as Graphica mentioned a few months ago, using collage, AI and digital painting. And so just this trademark, totally instantly recognizable style and super interesting compositions.
00:02:06.144 - 00:02:39.870, Speaker A: There's something about graphico PNg's work. This is called the ride. Cool title. Driving into sunset. A very cool work, I think we could say a minimal work. I mean, again, we see this stretched out car here, which is kind of a trademark, we could say, of graphic PNG. And these wonderful brush strokes here, which almost turns into traffic moving like the lights, you know, a red light in the dark on a dark highway, and it's almost traffic moving here turned into brushstrokes.
00:02:39.870 - 00:03:20.194, Speaker A: And this kind of lone figure in maybe the Nevada desert looking off into the horizon at dusk is almost what this looks like. Let's just, I brought it up close. Here's the work, just to try and piece together. I mean, there's interesting texture work going on here. Like, it seems like the texture that's behind this red here bleeds into the car. And it makes me wonder if there's almost like you can get those textures, those, you know, that you can use as a. I should bring up one of those, I saw it, an Instagram ad, and you've probably seen those where you can add texture to your work.
00:03:20.194 - 00:03:58.644, Speaker A: Sort of like we were talking about the virtual paper, as we've seen in sometimes gloom tube, sometimes the myth and others. It does make me wonder if there is some little bit of texture in here that helps unify this image, because these images do have, you know, what I'm tempted to call a unity. There is kind of, despite all of these different elements, there's something I would call oddly painterly about this work. Let's take a look at another one. So just beautiful, beautiful work here. Minted five days ago. No reserve and no bids.
00:03:58.644 - 00:04:43.654, Speaker A: And there's look at, like, I mean, again, you see the stretching out here. More stretching out, which is an interesting digital, you know, a digital tool where sometimes you can just kind of take a sample, take an image sample from a certain area and start stretching. I can't remember what they call that. There are apps where you can do that, and, I mean, you could do that manually in Photoshop. There seems to be a little bit of stretching going on, just a little bit, but it's not all the way uniform across. So anyways, who knows? And I will continue to struggle with the so anyways with the so anyways words here, but I'm putting an effort in. It's kind of a fun challenge to myself.
00:04:43.654 - 00:05:35.502, Speaker A: Continuing on, there's another one by graphica Png. This was minted on super rare, and this actually came out, I guess, two days ago. Once upon the time, in the digital Eden, this has a reserve of 1.337. So here, a little more painterly, a little more wild, we might say unusual. I'd say horizontal composition in the digital. There is, I think, and feel free to disagree with me here, but I think there's a natural bias in digital art by virtue of the distribution platforms, particularly the social media, Twitter and Instagram. I would say there's a slight bias towards making work that is either square or vertical in ratio.
00:05:35.502 - 00:06:01.234, Speaker A: So for me, seeing horizontal works works, it's kind of a novel thing. I mean, I like, I see it in myself. I don't make a ton of horizontal works because, you know, when you put it out, it's going to be hard for people to see. But I totally applaud it. And this kind of makes me want to make horizontal works, because, of course, there are many great horizontal works in the history of art. I wish I could make this bigger. I can't right click that's too bad.
00:06:01.234 - 00:06:22.534, Speaker A: Maybe I can do that here. I guess they got rid of that. It'd be nice to zoom in. An interesting combination here again. So let's just look at the description. The far lands of uncanny visions and juxtaposed garbage. Pixels and ugly brushstrokes, trying to be a little less perfect than it could once upon the time in the digital Eden.
00:06:22.534 - 00:06:40.592, Speaker A: You wonder if that's AI. So again, I would love to zoom in on this. Maybe I can. I can't. This is the most I'm going to get here. But really interesting stuff going on here. So cool work from Graphica PNG.
00:06:40.592 - 00:07:25.908, Speaker A: So thank you again to everybody who showed up yesterday, to Daniel W. And Roon tune and myself on our Twitter spaces. It was super interesting. We talked everything from the tarot to alchemy to Scopa cards and the relationship between Scopa and Tarot, which I had no idea, but it should have been obvious when you have those suits in the Scopa card game, which is an italian card game, and how they have the eight of swords, for example. So anyways, it was a great, it was a really interesting discussion. You can listen to it here. It's gonna go up on YouTube and Spotify either later today or tomorrow.
00:07:25.908 - 00:07:51.992, Speaker A: I am behind, but that will be up right away here. So thank you, everybody, for showing up. And thank you, Daniel W. For awesome discussion. And here again, and he's out of Brazil, and the ashtray of Brazil, as he calls it. And I wanted to actually, just in case you didn't hear it, he was mentioning how Wilhelm Hammershoi was a big influence. And you can see it.
00:07:51.992 - 00:08:24.944, Speaker A: I mean, those rooms that Daniel W. Does. I mean, you can all the, you know, the word I keep using is all the oppressiveness of these kind of spaces. And again, the subject always kind of facing away from the viewer here you see the influence. So it's pretty interesting here. I mean, sometimes they do those shows where you have, like, a newer artist and an old artist. It was like Van Gogh and Laura, I think her name is Laura Owen.
00:08:24.944 - 00:09:00.164, Speaker A: Laura Owens. Shall we, very quickly, do you know who Laura? I think it's lo. Yeah, I mean, Laura Owens. Yeah, I'm sure a lot of you know who Laura Owens is, but a really cool artist and actually relevant to this scene in the sense that here is an artist, here she is, who broke through several years ago, I'm guessing maybe ten to 15 years ago. And dithering uses a lot of screen printing and dithering. And that is. Yeah, you see here.
00:09:00.164 - 00:09:33.748, Speaker A: So these are paintings. So for those that don't know and love their dithering and pixel art, this is a really interesting artist, kind of a difficult artist. But I would say, you know, one of the early artists to really appreciate dithering and really do. I mean, a lot of us appreciate dithering, but the execution of Laura Owens is totally awesome. And that's kind of where the rubber meets the road with art, is execution. So look at this. Right? So, yeah, here we go.
00:09:33.748 - 00:09:56.466, Speaker A: One more, one more. And then we will continue. Yeah. So isn't that awesome? Look at that. See, playing with different colors, you know, with the screen printing. And again, I believe this is one huge screen print. So a beautiful solution here for capturing dithering on physical canvas here and interesting stuff going on.
00:09:56.466 - 00:10:27.952, Speaker A: Drop shadows. So I'd say kind of a very relevant artist in the sense of, in the context of this digital art scene. Like, look at how of great this looks. And another kind of example of the alchemy of what I like to call the alchemy of scale. You see how these are normally small on our screen, but then you blow it up and all of a sudden it starts turning beautiful. The trans, you know, traveling through the mediums, turning digital pixels into physical. And then you start getting the imperfections.
00:10:27.952 - 00:11:11.672, Speaker A: All of that stuff is being put together, and then you see it and it turns into an incredible aesthetic experience, as you can see here. And this is like, we should come back to Laura Owens actually in a future episode. So, as I was saying, how did we get to Laura Owens? I don't know. But anyways, but anyways, so welcome everybody. Thank you everybody for the comments here. A human boy and Mick renders also, again, singing the praises of this community. And I just, you know, like to echo that and it's very motivating and just all the talent and everything.
00:11:11.672 - 00:11:23.840, Speaker A: Always an interesting and beautiful day here, says human boy. Wonderful episode. Thank you. And thank you for contributing all you do yourself. Thank you. And Mick renders, once again, thank you for the entertainment. To be included again, really warms my heart.
00:11:23.840 - 00:11:49.082, Speaker A: My comment and yours about community ring true where I've been able to meet so many like minded, kind people that appreciate beautiful art in a multitude of ways and see the overall vision. Have a great weekend. Thank you. And this is a great comment from Bombadil, my favorite YouTube channel. When I see a notification about a new video, I am as happy as a child. And I also want to thank you for showing my work. I wish you millions of followers and very nice comment.
00:11:49.082 - 00:12:20.058, Speaker A: Thank you Bombadil and thank you Kiro. And this is kind of funny too. I have to mention this with axing here, you can make a drinking game because it's really hard to stop. Anyway, here's yeah, so this exactly making fun of how hard it's going to be. An interesting for me, an interesting experiment. Experiment in real time to see if I can actually stop doing this just out of for fun maybe good brain trick. Brain training.
00:12:20.058 - 00:12:50.864, Speaker A: Mom was right to be honest, I didn't notice until you brought it up. So anyways, good feedback, mom agreed. So big shout out to mom and thank you everybody for the comments. This was an interesting comment as well. And maybe food for thought for a future for a future Twitter spaces in poly see this? I don't know if you can see it. The daft punk polychrome 1993 work here. I think it's polychrome or polygon 1993.
00:12:50.864 - 00:13:12.704, Speaker A: Strange thing mentioned to you in a comment. Pokebally glitch works on Instagram. Re YouTube comment. Let's take over Instagram too. Web three friends more than happy to host a chat workshop to help others struggling to be seen on Twitter to migrate to Instagram. If we mass move over, collectors will follow. In fact, they are already here, just not as active due to Twitter being number one spot for nfts currently.
00:13:12.704 - 00:14:00.364, Speaker A: So maybe we can get a strange thing on a Twitter spaces and talk about really how he did it because he's done it since this show has started, which is only like eight months ago last August. And there he is probably at 70,000 followers now. So super interesting and food for thought from strange thing. I think we should try and bring him on. So next few weeks I'll work on that interesting comment from Hasdrubal waffle on Curio Fringe because remember I was saying like this almost reminds me of Hasdrubal waffle a bit. This totally awesome work here. Remember that? Really, really stoked to see Curio Fringe featured on Pokebelly this morning.
00:14:00.364 - 00:14:27.004, Speaker A: Kirio is a huge inspiration, always unique, funny, and a high watermark for experimental art, in my opinion. One of the first artists I collected and an incredibly cool human curio forever. So interesting comment. And here's Curio. Hee hee nido. Thanks for the kind words, homie. Is the poco thing like an art review thing? FYI, this piece sold for about 300 tez last year, $1,000 which is pretty awesome.
00:14:27.004 - 00:15:28.630, Speaker A: So anyway, so a beautiful comment there from Hasdrubal waffle and just interesting to see there is a connection. So I brought up Curio alt. And, you know, there's always a new discovery here on tezos, like a new great discovery here. I brought up prices low to high because I was looking at, you know, is there anything I can afford here? Here's an edition of 21 for 30. But you see how interesting and you do see the, you know, the influence on. So you, I wonder if, one wonders if some of the innovation we see in hasdrubal, some of it may have been part of a visual conversation, we might say, between Kirio Alt and Hasdrubal. Because you see this actually, let me put recently list newest, I think I brought this up here, waffle vibes via curio fringe.
00:15:28.630 - 00:16:00.648, Speaker A: So they may be going have a bit of a conversation responding to each other's works, which is super cool and a way to really push things forward. So again, it's kind of back to community here. So you see, I mean, this is, when is this from? October 24, 2022. So very interesting. Very, very interesting. So I have my eye now on Kiryo Alt hasn't minted anything, I don't think, too recently. Let's just really quickly look.
00:16:00.648 - 00:16:21.924, Speaker A: December 21, 2022. So maybe Curio Alt will come back. That would be wild. I'm sure Curio, Kirio Alt may have been a little ahead of their time. Like maybe it would just do fabulously right now. Maybe it looks like Curio Alt was already doing fabulously if they were selling for $1,000.02 years ago.
00:16:21.924 - 00:16:57.684, Speaker A: I wanted to show this because it actually happened a few days ago. This article came out May 12, and I was bringing this up in late April, this Henri Rousseau here, and it did sell for a record. There's not many Rousseau's come on the market. And of course, Rousseau is a very special artist, which is why I'm showing and kind of focusing on it because there are auctions all the time. Anyways, this work here, Les Flamand, which I think is the flamingos in French, went for a record $43.5 million. And let's just look at the details.
00:16:57.684 - 00:17:42.546, Speaker A: Bidding opened at $16.5 million, and a heated round pushed the price to $28 million before two parties reportedly went head to head for the painting in 18, $500,000 increments. You know, Rousseau, I mean, and I, as far as I understand, Rousseau didn't die like, I think it was well known, but kind of died a little bit obscure, as far as I understand. I mean, celebrated within avant garde circles. Like, look, this was, as far as I understand, this was painted in the year that Rousseau died, and this was 1910. And we know Picasso liked Rousseau. We know the surrealists liked Rousseau.
00:17:42.546 - 00:18:21.612, Speaker A: But I remember an essay by Ballard on Henri Rousseau, where he was kind of suggesting that Rousseau kind of died a little bit obscure relative to his current fame. So, anyways, it's a great thing to see. And is there any other details here? Yeah, here it is. Rousseau's work, painted the year he died, came from the estate of the late Payne Whitney Middleton, daughter of the New York Mets co founder, who owned the piece since 1949. Right. So we don't even know too much of the provenance before that, at least not in this article. Very interesting.
00:18:21.612 - 00:19:04.012, Speaker A: And, yeah, it was presented alongside works by Degas, so isn't that great? So here is the work, actually up close. And you see, you know, Rousseau's powerful color palette. Awesome signature, too. And again, one of the magical things about Rousseau and why the surrealist in particular loved him was he never went to a jungle, as far as the story goes. And he has all these jungle paintings, right? So that kind of like this, you know, a testament to the imagination. And so, yeah, so these, you know, fantastical plants. And almost just kind of like coming from his unconscious.
00:19:04.012 - 00:19:21.234, Speaker A: And that is also just one final point on this. You see, Max Ernst has some jungle. Let's just very quickly look. Max Ernst, Henri Rousseau. Or jungle. Jungle. Let's see if we can find this.
00:19:21.234 - 00:19:38.374, Speaker A: Or forest. Max Ernst, jungle. Maybe it's the forest. Yeah. You see this? So you see the relationship. So this is Max Ernst. And you can see, like, this foliage and this jungleness.
00:19:38.374 - 00:20:13.434, Speaker A: This is kind of seen oftentimes to represent the unconscious. Right? So you see this, just all this kind of organic, you know, plants not thinking consciously, but just moving right through, you know, just growing out like our unconscious. So that is one interpretation. So, yeah, so there's the influence, as you can see quite clearly on Ernst. Max Ernst. This was a steal. I'm sad I missed this.
00:20:13.434 - 00:20:41.624, Speaker A: This beautiful work here was sold by myth to raise funds for Ratcloak. And this incredible one of one immortal face zero two cloaksy ratticelli. So, playing off of a Sandro Botticelli, I think. Self portrait, stunningly done here. And 100% of the proceeds go to Ratcliffe's wallet and Ugor 1996. You can verify it yourself. Our friends are still in a war piece.
00:20:41.624 - 00:21:00.834, Speaker A: Indeed, indeed. And here it is. Sold for only 225. The stunning one of one. It's not a huge piece, but it is a stunner, as you can see. It's not huge. But it is like this went for a song.
00:21:00.834 - 00:21:23.442, Speaker A: The stunning, stunning work. I mean, there's Cosmo de Medici, there is, you know, Sandro botticelli portrait with the kind of rat cloak mask. And there again, la creme with the Oakland Raiders logo. Again, plain. You see, all this stuff is way back when the rat cloak. Myth. Mythos, we might say.
00:21:23.442 - 00:21:48.412, Speaker A: There's the Hollywood sign and then this great kind of Renaissance background and just stunningly, stunningly, stunningly painted, I think, with Microsoft paint. Incredible. So, you know, congratulations to the buyer. Do we know who the buyer is? Someone got this for a steel tempert. Yeah, nice work. Tempert. Yeah.
00:21:48.412 - 00:22:04.040, Speaker A: Incredible. And there's graphica PNG. Wow, there is another graphica png that came out that I didn't even see. Look at this. On object with fake whale. So all sorts of stuff happening here. Another car.
00:22:04.040 - 00:22:20.896, Speaker A: And just really interesting composition here. 25 tezos each on primary. Look at this. Lily Illo, Mikey Wilson Tempert. Yeah, so cool. Very cool, Kurt household collective. Greetings from the cyber slums.
00:22:20.896 - 00:22:35.838, Speaker A: So they are back on the scene here. We're coming home. Junk and Terry. Terry, as you can see down here. So Terry visual and Jnk, not junk, actually, it's JNk and Terry visual. Greetings from the cyber slums. So great to see them.
00:22:35.838 - 00:23:00.260, Speaker A: Edition of ten for ten tezos. And there's another hilarious piece here, hustle mind, playing off of Nirvana's album nevermind. Kurt Hussle, hustle mind. So just kind of hilarious and cool as usual. A little pirate patch, eye patch on George Washington there on the dollar. And tezos. Nice details.
00:23:00.260 - 00:23:24.736, Speaker A: One tezos, Kurt hussle collective edition of ten for ten tazos. And they are selling Haiti rocket on the scene. So very cool. Speaking of Haiti rocket, cypher Nexus, another work using brilliance 2.0. I really like this one. Just from a purely aesthetic point of view. It looks really just nice and great and fun.
00:23:24.736 - 00:23:52.786, Speaker A: It's really pleasant to look at. Really nice. Just kind of, you know, that four to the floor rasterize or bitmapping or dithering where you have just like a checkerboard. Dithering is really like. We see Tom bombadil use it a lot. It's really pleasant to look at. So anyways, Amiga 1200 loac me with a really cool gif here.
00:23:52.786 - 00:24:14.772, Speaker A: Another one. And kind of has a bit of a nature feel to it, but not sure. Anyway, really cool. Dithered out something abstract, animated. Abstract in black and white with a lot of dithering. Let's call it that. Another work here that I had never seen from guandanarian.
00:24:14.772 - 00:24:57.824, Speaker A: And just a very. Remember the pixel art factory kind of trope, we might say, that we see in cocolitus, we see it in guandanarium cream safa. And I thought this was a really interesting kind of approach where it's not the dot, it quote s kind of used as almost like a framing device here, which is pretty cool. And then you have just a really mysterious, you know, image of this, you know, ship in the sky, you know, fishing into the clouds, seemingly, or into a sea, almost looking like fishing into the clouds. So really, really, really cool work. Beautiful animation, too. Just nice variation, cool colors, everything.
00:24:57.824 - 00:25:13.784, Speaker A: A lot of artists are doing this right now, art versus artists, where they're showing themselves. So there is Guandanarian. So that is cool. Look at this. Goyong arts. And I think we have sound here. The goldfish makes sound.
00:25:13.784 - 00:25:51.732, Speaker A: This is called cage. Interesting. It's a bit of a commentary here of sorts. And remember, with guiyang arts, it's almost like there are areas that are masked in maybe after effects or something with like a pixelation filter. I think one is over here, you know, one is down there, you see how the fish is going through, and then it hits some sort of pixelation area here. We see it down here with a different kind of filter. So just a really powerful technique, just all of it put together.
00:25:51.732 - 00:26:17.304, Speaker A: The illustration is beautiful and interesting concept, too. Kind of a, you know, provocative. Provocative is maybe too strong, but an interesting composition. Very interesting. So, two ETH on super rare from goyang. Birds trapped in a cage don't make beautiful sounds and don't flap their wings as they watch passing fishes and bubbles. This feels similar to the way we live in the modern world.
00:26:17.304 - 00:27:00.574, Speaker A: Interested in other beings and comparing them, but living without any change by themselves, what kind of life should we live? Deep thoughts from goyang arts. Yeah, kind of makes you think twice about putting birds in a cage, doesn't it? Really cool work here, as per usual from Uksing, as you probably guessed. So this is for edition of ten for 0.2 ETH. So a quick two ETH for axine on a cool work. Again, using the classic, you know, fryer here, or monk and retro technology. And just a cool, you know, pixelation here, shall we say, of this kind of energy field from the computer to the person, daily dose.
00:27:00.574 - 00:27:36.064, Speaker A: So, you know, if we were to interpret this, the information that is going into the person and that kind of symbiotic relationship, and a little skull here for commentary with a little window, interestingly. And some more kind of almost random esque kind of noise here. And then a little guy, I think he called that a homunculi. Also the guy we saw in debt and everything. So all the kind of, you know, the skeleton. A lot of the classic themes we know and love from uxine. Cool colors and really nice painterly action here.
00:27:36.064 - 00:27:47.744, Speaker A: Again, using likely procreate. Sold out. Very cool. And this was also interesting. Euxine's put out a couple of works that are kind of slightly different here. This is one of them. And this came out this morning.
00:27:47.744 - 00:28:16.104, Speaker A: When you make peace with authority, you become authority. You cannot kill ideas. So interesting kind of anti establishment work, we might say. And the oxygen happy face. This looks like a gym bag or something, but, oh, maybe you know what this is? I think this is VR goggles. This is like a VR thing with some japanese writing, reverse copyright. And of course, Ukzene's work is copyright zero.
00:28:16.104 - 00:28:34.420, Speaker A: So very interesting from uxing. This is someone I discovered from Daniel W. Yesterday. Cuda. It was in Daniel W's collection. We were talking about artists a little bit near the end. Arcana territory headquarters of bio wizards again, always a new discovery here.
00:28:34.420 - 00:28:59.528, Speaker A: Has a very video game type feeling to it and just kind of interesting. Interesting colors, interesting process, interesting composition, interesting everything. So Arcana territory headquarters of biowizards on secondary for 45. So not cheap. And you could have bought it on primary for 350. And it took a while to sell. So maybe there's Daniel W.
00:28:59.528 - 00:29:33.834, Speaker A: There, McRender's. So maybe you can get in on the next one at a pretty good price. Still, here's little cakes. And I think this is little cakes singing. Kind of sounds like little cakes. I wonder if this is japanese. A tribute to koei kon nation.
00:29:33.834 - 00:29:59.100, Speaker A: Two corns and the magic of unicorns. Everything is connected. Raw, upscaled AI image and digital border and animation, music, arrangement and performance created with Crevo music, AI assisted and manipulation and filter added in audacity. Lyrics by little cakes. Very cool. Buy now for 20 and that's on secondary. Let's just see what this sold for on primary only a tezos 30.
00:29:59.100 - 00:30:12.466, Speaker A: So look at there's Bridget. New York City, Turkarack, Santiago. Interesting, interesting. Aylay authentic waffles. Nice collectors. Very nice. Demon ego with a work edition of ten.
00:30:12.466 - 00:30:45.770, Speaker A: I think this is on primary for 18. There are seven left. And so more cool work from demon ego. Ghost S game s flowerish is death. So back to this series here. That was kind of more GiF related, it seems, you know, again, this almost hybrid of the notebooks, remember that we see that demon ego works on as physical works. Here's almost like a digital approach to that same compositional style.
00:30:45.770 - 00:31:06.714, Speaker A: You can almost see the division here in the middle. And again, that almost collage look to it. Cases of uncertainty. So a very cool title too. And a few sales here so far at 18 tezos. And more work by Ed Morolla. This was cool.
00:31:06.714 - 00:31:35.510, Speaker A: More interesting music here. Opus for purple theremin, Suzanne, violetta. So theremin. This is the theremin, I guess, which is where you can play the song with your hands in the air. So maybe Ed's using a theremin here. The dithering that moves here. I really like the direction that Ed keeps going in.
00:31:35.510 - 00:31:52.222, Speaker A: It just gets more and more complex in a kind of simple way. That's what happens. That's what happens when you make a ton of work. It just gets more and more interesting. And it continues to be super interesting here. Ed Marolla, open edition. Finished.
00:31:52.222 - 00:32:09.956, Speaker A: Did this cell listed all burnt, maybe so in three minutes. So nobody really had a chance to get one. Maybe there's another version. I'm just curious. That may have just been burnt. So interesting. More experimentation there with health surf.
00:32:09.956 - 00:32:25.864, Speaker A: Interesting. And look at this. This has a total, like, physical feeling to it. Just some eyes here. So it's not exactly clear what this is. If this is physical AI, it's got a bit of a digital feeling to it, so it does. Maybe it's a mix of everything.
00:32:25.864 - 00:32:56.162, Speaker A: Interesting experimentation. Still feels like an Ed Marolla. Just when you see the skulls here and it's almost again like this abstraction, and then just adds a little bit of a few things at the end, the city, these archways and some people, and all of a sudden it's representational. So just an interesting tweet out there. This is from Santiago. An interesting abstract from Santiago. I wonder if he's using his own software for this.
00:32:56.162 - 00:33:18.994, Speaker A: It's just got a bit of an original feel to it, doesn't it? So cool work from Santiago. Just cool abstract work. Again, I'm kind of back to that whole idea. Like, watch this space. As far as artists making their own software using AI. Luciana gueraro. Luciana guerra.
00:33:18.994 - 00:33:48.524, Speaker A: Okay, luciana guerra. One of one for 460 tezos on object. So that is cool. So continuing to release on object. I think she's very multi chain, as far as I remember, because of course she's on super rare and everything. I mean, it's funny as it's been a little slower on ethereum, I think, in the last few weeks and all of a sudden Tezos is looking really good, right? So it's again, the benefits of multi chain. Anyways, a cool work here.
00:33:48.524 - 00:34:24.014, Speaker A: All sorts, you know, a kind of instantly recognizable work using all sorts of different, you know, brushwork and techniques and collage. Ain't no my imagination. The exploration of the idea that our understanding of the world around us is constantly evolving and our perceptions of reality are shaped by a variety of factors, including culture, language, and personal experience. All the artworks on this collection include a gicle print. Interesting. Let's look at the collection quickly and look at that. So that's interesting.
00:34:24.014 - 00:34:58.898, Speaker A: I've never made a gicle print, but it kind of makes me want to try continuing on. Lydia Moon xx so we looked at a work by Lydia Moon the other day, again using this kind of old graphic digital program interface here and kind of a retro feel. And then again, the kind of windows 95 imagery here. And then with a kind of anime looking figure and a lot of airbrush and bubbles. Just mysterious work. Bubbles from Lydia Moon. And this all are available.
00:34:58.898 - 00:35:12.810, Speaker A: This may have just been released actually just last night. So interesting. So all available from Lydia Moon. Very cool. Vaporwave. Do you see that? Emoon's vaporwave dreams. Interesting.
00:35:12.810 - 00:35:31.734, Speaker A: That explains the colors a little bit, doesn't it? And also the retro tech. Interesting. Look at this beautiful work by Dan Control. Another animal. And here is a pretty spectacular monkey with very human looking teeth here. So again, very. Just nice.
00:35:31.734 - 00:36:00.222, Speaker A: Just a beautiful. It's a beautiful work, isn't it? I mean, it would work really well on a wall. You walk in into a show. If you've never seen a Dan control work before, you walk in. It's big on the wall, especially an animal themed show. Again, remember Warhol when he was doing all the WWF World Wildlife Fund WWF Animal works kind of reminds me of that a little bit. All animals from Dan control.
00:36:00.222 - 00:36:22.106, Speaker A: Mental noise with a work here, shadows of justice. This is an open edition. There are 48 minted already, and there are only two tezos. And cool kind of. It looks like basically a bit of a riot going on here. I like this almost showing the process a bit. It's tempting to think with these, this color here.
00:36:22.106 - 00:36:46.426, Speaker A: It's almost like this is what mental noise would use to maybe sample from. Although I don't see this color elsewhere. But anyways, I really love this little area right there. And here you have some riot police and some rioters. And there's mental noise signature kind of cool, cool. Almost graffiti esque. Buildings on fire and everything.
00:36:46.426 - 00:37:03.494, Speaker A: Shadows of justice. So interesting work. And boardme social club problem solution service got rugged problems with love life, sales down, etc. Etc. Fear not. Call 660 619 83. So interesting.
00:37:03.494 - 00:37:22.014, Speaker A: A lot of interesting imagery. Very surreal as usual. And here's the snake skull. And this looks like almost like eastern. Almost like eastern gods. Like who would, you know, the. I can't remember the name.
00:37:22.014 - 00:37:37.874, Speaker A: Yeah, the whole eastern mythology there. And almost like a Freddy Krueger type figure. Anyways, very interesting. Problem solution service edition of six. Let's see. And sold out at 351 to axin there. Tornado Rodriguez.
00:37:37.874 - 00:38:01.682, Speaker A: Tornado Rodriguez really loves board me social club. She was mentioning in a previous Twitter space is Mikey Wilson with a cool work here. Edition of 15. Sold out now 111 on secondary. Kind of has a bit of a Robert Johnson at the crossroads kind of feeling. Who's a blues? One of the. Maybe the original blue sky Robert Johnson kind of has that feeling to it.
00:38:01.682 - 00:38:19.292, Speaker A: And a full moon here and on a path. Seller's remorse blues. That's awesome. So that feeling when you sell something you can never get back. So poetically painted here. I've never seen like this is kind of next level with Mikey Wilson here. This is really nicely painted.
00:38:19.292 - 00:38:39.616, Speaker A: So nice work here. AI and mid journey as well been incorporated here. Very interesting. And Robert so probably is Robert Johnson. Sold for five tezos on primary and sold out in about an hour and a half. So nice work there. Now at 111.
00:38:39.616 - 00:39:03.634, Speaker A: Look at this. Interesting work by Turkirak, who often does these kind of, you know, edgy images. Here's just like a landscape, I think this is called sburb so suburb. So just kind of an unusual subject matter. And unusually painted by Turkarak, who I think is a very talented artist, which is why I keep showing Turkarak's work. I'm just very excited about the work. Really nicely done here.
00:39:03.634 - 00:39:29.246, Speaker A: And fairly prolific artist. And it looks like just like, you know, electric wires above some houses here. So interestingly painted, almost looks physical, but I assume it's digital edition of five and there are five left. None have sold. I might pick one up. Interesting work from an artist I've never seen before, chips o Houlihan. And this is called prompt draw thing that looks like a snake.
00:39:29.246 - 00:40:06.398, Speaker A: Started off as drawing, complaining about AI mid journey, then morphed into whatever. This is so kind of cool. Just using midjourney as the subject on a computer feels very 2023 to me. And I quite liked this solution here. I mean, probably just having fun and not thinking too much about it, but this is actually a pretty interesting way of putting a message in an artwork. Draw a thing that looks like a snake and then putting it on the keyboard, and you can just imagine that's the person, what they typed in. And there's the snake, and there is midjourney and interesting characters in the background.
00:40:06.398 - 00:40:29.234, Speaker A: Open sea logo on a cup, some cigarettes and whatnot. So, cool work. Looks cool. Only one tezos edition of ten. There are four left. And rogue sincerity has a couple more works here from this temple of rogue that just came out. And here we looked, we saw this, like, I feel like, months ago.
00:40:29.234 - 00:41:07.414, Speaker A: And so there are a couple of new ones, and it kind of uses what kind of like the ancient greek vase. Not the imagery, but the techniques that you find on ancient greek vase vases. This kind of, you know, black on red that you often find so kind of really evokes. You can even see it here. And then there's the temple. So combining the ancient in terms of process, like the look and in terms of the subject matter, here's like a temple of sorts. And this almost looks like, you know, what would you call it? Not akkadian.
00:41:07.414 - 00:41:25.096, Speaker A: This almost looks like middle eastern art. It's escaping me this morning. But with these dragons, these mythological figures with the big wings. We'll come back. They're in the pergamon here in Berlin. But then juxtaposing that with, say, a brand new car here. Interesting.
00:41:25.096 - 00:41:43.920, Speaker A: So, motives, confessions. Two motives available for ten tezos edition of 1510. Left. And here's another one, same idea. You got this temple here, temple of rogue. And again, kind of older looking, kind of greek techniques. Here's even a shout out to these vases.
00:41:43.920 - 00:42:07.822, Speaker A: But these have a bit more of a middle eastern sort of feel over greek. But maybe this one could be greek. Almost like constellation on here, too. And again, this Middle eastern imagery, which is escaping me, the name of it right now. Anyways, cool work. Interesting kind of design aspects to it, too. And this flame strike open doors.
00:42:07.822 - 00:42:31.374, Speaker A: So we were looking at the start of the show, at that other artist that Daniel W. Is influenced by, and you can start to see it here. So a cool work here. Open doors. And just, again, playing with this heavy architectural look. And here, I can go back here. I think we still have it, or we don't.
00:42:31.374 - 00:43:08.704, Speaker A: Let me go back very quickly, this right look. I mean, it's almost as you saw there, like, here's open doors. So you see, you know, that's. I think that's really cool. Again, because it's, it's not, it's, it's, it's influence, but it's also having a conversation with that earlier work and playing with things, you know. And again, like to be a, I always sort of have this idea to be a part of the tradition, you have to have a conversation with the tradition. And there's just as we were seeing with Ernst and Rousseau here, in a sense, Daniel W.
00:43:08.704 - 00:43:43.754, Speaker A: With. And the name of that artist very quickly because I always forget Wilhelm Hammershoi. So interesting. Again, kind of a horror aspect to it there, as the tag says, edition of, edition of 23 for three tazos. And here's just a cool work by Mirai Mizue that was kind of illustrative and animated and just a cool work. I don't know what to see, what the tweet says. So watching them get absorbed, the students in their creations, makes me feel like I've been given energy.
00:43:43.754 - 00:44:03.074, Speaker A: Cool. Here's Remy Fort forte. Remy Forte, who does the code to make the abstract works. And so here is another cool work. Lines and squares 95. One of ones, by the way, for five tazos. So very reasonably priced.
00:44:03.074 - 00:44:22.024, Speaker A: And again, use this code. There are several. One of ones here for five tazos. So kind of exciting for collectors out there, especially if you're into abstract. And so check this out, too. Bonjour. Flipping through the pages of my book, lines and squares.
00:44:22.024 - 00:45:15.028, Speaker A: So Remy has experimented a lot with physical renditions of this work, which is actually my favorite rendition is once you start going physical, because again, you get the accidental aspects, the random aspects of physical, of making things in the physical world. And it goes, kind of creates a beautiful, natural contrast here, as we can see with that hard edged digital perfectness. Dave, also known as bees and bombs. Just a cool animated abstract work on Twitter. Could hang well with acid boy, couldn't it? Interesting colors there, too. And just interesting animation. And of course, you recognize this as a score saiko with a bit of a different take on the faces that we've been seeing.
00:45:15.028 - 00:45:39.410, Speaker A: So here, almost playing with this almost disco ball like mirror structure, which is pretty, again, pretty nicely done here. So very cool work there. Thank you so much for revealing bright girls 56. It was nice to see your collection together on the BRT moments display. And thank you again for visiting. So this is on foundation. Very cool.
00:45:39.410 - 00:46:00.534, Speaker A: And a couple of abstract works by Kazuhiro Ihara. These look like experiments. Sai fifteen zero five three was minted, revealed by the master of digital art, Nicholas Sassoon. Rare architectural dimensions with the bright beige colored palettes. So this is also, I think, part of that same show. You see BRT moments, bright moments. So something's going on.
00:46:00.534 - 00:46:21.604, Speaker A: I am discovering here on foundation. Maybe this is a. Maybe this is very quickly a world on foundation. Bright girls. Not sure. Maybe it's here. So, no.
00:46:21.604 - 00:46:47.324, Speaker A: Anyway, very interesting experimentation here is what I want to go with here. I've never seen anything quite like this. So just interesting. More interesting experimentation. Here's another one from Kazuhiro Ihara. So just more abstract experimentation. I keep putting less tabs in the show, and it still keeps going.
00:46:47.324 - 00:46:56.098, Speaker A: I can't believe we're at 46 minutes. Let's keep going. Let's run through this. Sabato with super cool work. Static bloom. A nice take on a flower. Glitched out.
00:46:56.098 - 00:47:18.136, Speaker A: A static work, I believe in earlier work from 2016. Interesting size, 1080 by 1920, from fragile compositions. And this probably sold out. His glitch work is really selling out fast, I think. Here's another one. Static melodrama, also from Sabato. So very cool experimentation.
00:47:18.136 - 00:47:39.352, Speaker A: Collectors are snapping these up. Data bending glitch from 2016 with a bit of processing in 2023. And look at this. I mean, selling out within, like, 15 minutes. Very interesting. There's a real collectibility there and which makes perfect sense to me. Sky Goodman, heaven for basketball highs AI kicks.
00:47:39.352 - 00:48:14.052, Speaker A: Continuing to develop this whole shoe sneaker AI series with cool background and just great color and everything. So continuing to push the limits of the series here. Cool reflection, too, from Sky Goodman. And this also, this sold for one. Sold for ten tezos to Mikey Wilson. And the other two, Sky Goodman is holding onto edition of three. And a new work by Tewks, which was put on foundation.
00:48:14.052 - 00:48:58.020, Speaker A: Let me just show you the work. So, one of these magical pieces that Tewks has been making, and kind of some flowers here, you know, half representational, half abstract, and just a really interesting work. Sold for 22 ETH, and this was minted just on the 16th. So a recent work, sea, sun and philae. Interesting, kind of a scientific title. And here's white solitude with fake whale lords of the southern plains. So, again, this AI that is done super painterly, which is one of the remarkable things about the new, I think it's mid journey, I think, is how powerful the brushstrokes are.
00:48:58.020 - 00:49:11.932, Speaker A: I imagine stable diffusion. I mean, this looks like real paint. Stunningly so. Edition of five for 40 tezos. I believe that's on secondary. And it sold for only ten tezos on primary. So nice work there.
00:49:11.932 - 00:49:42.178, Speaker A: An offer from arty hands for 25 and some work from strange things. So again, continuing to push the ideas here. An awesome Louis Vuitton basketball, a luxury basketball. And here's another one. So not slowing down at all. And a hilarious basketball net here also, you know, luxury basketball net. So very interesting here.
00:49:42.178 - 00:49:59.822, Speaker A: And here's backpacks. Good morning, Internet friends. Made in AI, literally literal inspired renaissance architecture. Backpacks and handbags through the help and handbags through the help of artificial intelligence. Intelligence. And so this is on Twitter. And here are a couple of others.
00:49:59.822 - 00:50:24.404, Speaker A: Look at this handbag here. So working. To me, these are like concept pieces because I don't know how practical they would be. Although if you produce this, I'm sure in some quarters some people would love it, you know? So interesting work from strange thing. And check this out. This is a myth, I think, done by Patrick Terenchkin. Torentian, Patrick Torrentian and FoMO.
00:50:24.404 - 00:50:38.312, Speaker A: D y o r. White limo. Looks like Dior. Other, do your own research or. But Dior is Dior anyway. Shooting a perfume. What looks like a cologne or perfume.
00:50:38.312 - 00:50:59.460, Speaker A: Beautifully rendered myth. Lemonhead here with some pixelation. Physically, so cool work. Here's Patrick Trenchin, who I think is actually a dealer collector. So I'm not sure how that work came about. If that was by myth, collected by Patrick Torrentian or that Patrick Torrentian did it. I'm not sure where that work came from.
00:50:59.460 - 00:51:24.924, Speaker A: Finally, we've been looking at Steven Schwarzer. Look at these works, these abstracts, and, I mean, don't. There's Steven Schwarzer. And don't they just remind you? I love this, too. I love this. Can I zoom in here? Ooh, that could work. They really remind you of cy tombly, don't they? And just really very cool artist here.
00:51:24.924 - 00:51:43.956, Speaker A: Up and comer here looks okay. So look at what's going on here. It looks like he is blind. And that is how he is getting such outstanding results here. Very interesting. Very interesting. And that is your show, everybody.
00:51:43.956 - 00:51:55.404, Speaker A: So if I don't see you tomorrow, I hope you have a great weekend. And until next time, we're gonna have the Twitter spaces next time. And thank you once again for joining me. Have a great weekend, and take care.
