00:00:04.640 - 00:00:41.452, Speaker A: You know, if I had to reveal my heart of hearts, my innermost perspective, I actually enjoy what I see on this broadcast and basically in this web3 digital art space more than I do when I go to the museums. And honestly, and nobody needs to agree with me, in my heart of hearts, I enjoy it. This is far better than the museum experience. So welcome back, everyone. Artist journal, August 24, 2023. Broadcasting from the pirate ship of the mind in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokabelli.
00:00:41.452 - 00:00:59.474, Speaker A: And check this out. It is works like these of which I speak here. This brilliant, brilliant work. It's from June. I don't often start a show with an older work, but this one, just you. You know, I think it missed a lot of people's radars. I just saw it on Twitter.
00:00:59.474 - 00:01:22.614, Speaker A: Edition of ten. They're only one tezos each. You probably don't know the artist. At least I didn't. And it is out of Kuhei Yamashita, out of Japan. Big data. The world is overflowing with big date, maybe big data edition of ten for atezos, which is registering in at $0.71.
00:01:22.614 - 00:02:01.458, Speaker A: So if you have $0.71 sense to spare, you can help Kuhei Yamashita along their journey of art making. Look at how brilliant this is. And I keep coming back to this idea of how these things are kind of made to look easy, these works here. Because as far as what I see here, and feel free to disagree with me, I say I need a wardrobe before I. Once this operation gets big enough, we can have wardrobe, we can have the green room, we can have everything. But until then, it is a one man show.
00:02:01.458 - 00:02:29.684, Speaker A: Over here, my friends, so bear with me. But what do you see going on here? I see these kind of effects. I feel like I've seen them. And maybe hasdrubal waffle, perhaps. We were speculating if he had photographed the screen at one point. This is what I see here because I recognize it from trying to solve before. We had these AI algorithms that actually do a pretty good job of making your work bigger.
00:02:29.684 - 00:02:58.490, Speaker A: Who was it? Evelyn o. If you're ever wondering, Evelyn O gave me some great alpha on that. There are some websites like GitHub type websites, if you're ever looking. You don't even necessarily need to spend the hundred euros for some of the programs like Topaz and what's the other one? Something AI. I can't remember. All to say I struggled with this, but because I with photographing screens as I was trying to make works bigger. How do you make a work bigger.
00:02:58.490 - 00:03:24.378, Speaker A: Right. You know, turn a 300 pixel work into a 3000 pixel work in incredible ways. So one of the experiments I did was photographing my screen. Maybe that'll give me a high res file that looks persuasive. It didn't, because oftentimes you'd get these halos, these kind of rings here from photographing screens. So that is what this looks like. And then you see this great composition here.
00:03:24.378 - 00:04:05.464, Speaker A: A beautiful contrast of this retro sharp television, small and from this angle and then the screen basically leaking out. That kind of photograph screen look. It's kind of deceptively simple, this composition when you consider everything that went into it. And deceptively cheap, I might add. Because when I see work like this, I really do think, like, I was like, I can't believe, first of all, that it's still available and I have to purchase this for $0.71 for the museum. In my mind, that may or may not exist in a physical or a digital world at some point.
00:04:05.464 - 00:04:29.388, Speaker A: But this was another just so original. It's kind of one of those almost one offs now, as we're going to see Kuhei Yamashita makes other great works here. But this one, I saw it on Twitter. It really kind of jumped out at me. Now, there are other works here too, as you can see. So this is, you see, almost a dali. It is a dali reference here.
00:04:29.388 - 00:05:09.674, Speaker A: ATM, you know, very interesting here. Calculator with a nice, almost a Dan control feel but not quite even here a little bit, but, you know, different. And let me just show you, it's only two pages and so hasn't been minting for a super long time. Again, this is June. If I go back here and look, I mean, there are still three left. So maybe just off the radar here, Ken Xapta Mick renders pp universal Mikey Wilson. So the kind of, you know, the advanced collectors on the scene here, especially this guy here, Mikey Wilson.
00:05:09.674 - 00:05:39.688, Speaker A: Very interesting. So again, Kuhei Yamashita. This is only from the 19 June and sold, you know, one at a time here, just dripping out the sales. So again, this is just a gorgeous, such an original work. I had to start with it. And so this is Kuhei Yamashita's Twitter page, again, out of or x page out of Japan. As you can see here, 2015 followers.
00:05:39.688 - 00:06:05.988, Speaker A: And I thought this was brilliant too. There's something just kind of cool about Kuhei Yamashita's work. And the price is right. To quote Bob Barker, the price is right. Editions of five owned three, so three are left. This is from July 7. Just the enter key, which I don't know, do they still call it enter? I mean, again, this looks like a retro computer here with the large kind of key that looks like you pressed down.
00:06:05.988 - 00:06:26.824, Speaker A: That doesn't look modern. Modern keyboards are pretty flat, aren't they? Here's one other one, actually. We have a couple more. Unseen miracle. I thought this was quite brilliant too. So taking a, you know, almost like, you know, a retro tech. I mean, I think of immediately of axing also using the video camera.
00:06:26.824 - 00:07:05.154, Speaker A: So taking a retro video camera from like the late nineties, early two thousands. Interestingly, almost putting that default screen that you saw back in the 1980s when, you know, we don't have all the colors here, but it almost looks like one of those kind of default television screens. You see it almost here, almost cropped weirdly, but another, you know, edited in a certain sort of way. So interestingly. And then it looks like Jesus of Nazareth with the crown of thorns there behind. There's something quite brilliant about this. Let me just make it large actually for full effect.
00:07:05.154 - 00:07:36.694, Speaker A: How much is this? This is sold out unfortunately. And look at what Phoebe Hees got this work for. Oh no. Is it edition of one? It is an edition of one sold for a tezos and canceled listing one. I wonder if one was burned. I'm not exactly sure what went on here because one was sold but another was cancelled. You almost wonder if there is a burn that wasn't listed here either.
00:07:36.694 - 00:07:54.288, Speaker A: All to say edition of one for atezos. So deals on the blockchain. And here's one more. A variation on the concept. Fractal. Visual fractal. And again, almost reminiscent of those old Walt Disney and comics and stories covers from the 1940s.
00:07:54.288 - 00:08:19.746, Speaker A: The picture name, the infinite regress image. We have shown those before on the show. Kuhei Yamashita. Another really cool talent there, I'm sure. One of several that are just floating away in this ocean that we're sailing across here. Thank you, everybody. I was pleasantly surprised at how many people, uh, showed up to basically just kind of a free for all spaces.
00:08:19.746 - 00:08:56.205, Speaker A: And it went for an hour 26. I thought, you know, I. I thought probably this is just gonna be a 60 or 70 minutes this went on and we could have kept going. So thank you everybody for showing up. I truly appreciate it. It was a lot of fun and some cool things were learned on this show, including, I mean, stuff like there are ways to create a store on Twitter or on X that I kind of news to me. There's also the highlight feature on X was being discussed.
00:08:56.205 - 00:09:33.534, Speaker A: Santiago was bringing up zero one, which we're going to look at here in a second. So all sorts of really, you know, you come across new artists on these things. You come across new ideas. It's kind of fun. Like it's, I hope in my heart of hearts back to that concept here or idea what I kind of hope in some ways I'm just thinking of this now for the first time that this could be like, I hope this is like, you know, kind of talk radio for while you're making art, you know, that maybe is stimulating, giving you ideas while you're working. And while you're working, you kind of run into have good ideas. You kind of run out of ideas.
00:09:33.534 - 00:10:05.376, Speaker A: Things happen. Maybe it's just kind of a nice little stimulus as you are doing your work. So all to say thank you, everybody, and big thank you to mech TXT. I don't want to be presumptuous, but I do believe this may have something to do with my, with me, Adrian Taco Belli. And there is that image. You know that image originally, I think it's on my YouTube here. See this little image down here? You see it here.
00:10:05.376 - 00:10:35.638, Speaker A: That was actually taken at Fondazione Prada, I think, in Milan, where they had a fantastic show by that great film director who did the Grand Budapest hotel, whose name escapes me right now. I'm sure like 99% of you are going to know Wes Anderson. They had a brilliant show by Wes Anderson. I think we've looked in the past at that. So all to say, mech seems to be using that as a bit of a source. Adrian taco Belli. So that is beautiful and brilliant.
00:10:35.638 - 00:10:57.130, Speaker A: Nice to just add to the collection here and thank you. Mex Mechs is awesome. We had him on the spaces a couple of weeks ago and just love his work. So it's hilarious and awesome. It is an honor. Continuing on, comments just from last show. Let's just see here.
00:10:57.130 - 00:11:14.858, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, these are got a lot of interesting comments here. So, Kyle Flemmer. Hi, Adrian. Great show. You're right about on cyber being a little clunky. I'm working on a gallery right now because I like seeing the work up together, but getting around and positioning things precisely can be a bit of a headache. Also sorting through the items in your wallet when making selections.
00:11:14.858 - 00:12:17.706, Speaker A: Otherwise, I quite like what can be done exhibiting in virtual space. And I think you hit the nail on the head, Kyle, because I agree that it is, you know, despite the clunkiness of moving around, I do like the virtual space and being able to just see what a Kurt Hussle collective looks like beside a Haiti rocket and just almost as a kind of virtual exhibition space. And, you know, especially, let's say you're putting a show together in real life, well, you can start to kind of mix and match and see even how big they should be. So there's a lot to be said for that. And if I was on cyber, as I saw this comment, what I thought to myself is, you know, what I would love is like an auto feature where I can just hit the auto button and it takes me through the exhibition without me having to lift a finger other than press the auto button. I think, you know, tour, maybe it should be the tour button. And wouldn't that be awesome? And then when you're going through the tour, if you want to speed it up, you hit like the spacebar.
00:12:17.706 - 00:12:43.250, Speaker A: And then it takes you to the next one really quickly. You know, you start walking to the next one if you want to cut it short. Something that simple, I think would be well worth their while to do. So thank you for the comments. Totally agree. And strange pea, that produces it all. So that brilliant song that we heard at the end in Strangep's work is in fact strange p that beautiful, like what I would call Detroit techno.
00:12:43.250 - 00:12:57.734, Speaker A: Correct me if you have a different name for it, strange pea. And here's strange pea. Thanks for watching one of my works. And yes, I make the music great. And thank you. PP Universal NFt soldiers, all of us. Boom sling.
00:12:57.734 - 00:13:06.318, Speaker A: Good stuff. Thank you. Good analysis. Good constructive. Oh, this is great. And we're going to look at actually more from Greco in a second here. Good constructive criticism, friend.
00:13:06.318 - 00:13:27.594, Speaker A: Glad to hear that. Thanks for reviewing my work. Regards from Argentina. Yeah, in a sense, I guess they turn into reviews, but they're not meant to be. I'm really just talking about people's art here. I realize that, you know, that's basically, you know, it's probably a distinction without a difference or all semantics at this point. But really, for me, I would never create a show of reviews.
00:13:27.594 - 00:13:51.270, Speaker A: You might find that hilarious to hear, but that's basically what it kind of turns into. But put it this way though, but it is an important distinction for me personally because I'm not out to say this is good and this is bad. I'm just going, this is. Look at this. This is amazing. That's all I'm doing. And then every, you know, and so, and then I just collect stuff based on that and a couple of more comments here.
00:13:51.270 - 00:15:20.404, Speaker A: This one was very interesting as well. From rune tune raw AI is uninteresting and irrelevant as an attribute to AI work, in my opinion. Of course, raw AI, for those that might not know, is an artwork that's generated purely using AI with no edits, as far as my understanding of the term, but I think that's a pretty solid understanding. It may be topical now and have some interest among AI art enthusiasts, but what is the point of highlighting raw AI as an attribute of AI work, especially since most AI artists run hundreds of thousands of prompts, hundreds to thousands of prompts and reprompts to get a result they are happy with? And I thought this was an excellent point. So is it raw AI? In a sense, what runetune is pointing out is there's an editing process here in choosing, and though it may be invisible, there is still an editing process. So is it raw AI? So the term really does start to disintegrate a little bit when you kind of take a closer look at what point is the human behind the work making more decisions than the AI? I thought this was just a brilliant point point here from runetune, with developments like mid journeys in painting, it is clear to me that AI tools are less about what the AI is doing and more about the creative efficiency. Imagine me saying that my work is raw Photoshop because I only used photoshop.
00:15:20.404 - 00:15:45.382, Speaker A: You know, I feel like I'm in an 18th century coffee shop here, and a really good debate is happening in front of me. A very interesting, provocative, persuasive point from runetune. Thank you for the comment. And thank you, Philippe. And thank you, primitive intel. Now, I thought you were strange p primitive intel. And I was like, okay, finally we put primitive intel in the show.
00:15:45.382 - 00:16:17.946, Speaker A: So feel free to send me a message because I thought you were strange p at the start. So anyways, continuing on, and also we heard from Lorna Mills, and I thought this was interesting, too, when you said around 40 54 about all the courage it takes to put those colors together. I had to smile when I painted. I never valorized anything around it, but I was reminded of how exciting it was to put strange color combos on a surface and see the resonance. So again, great to hear from Lorna mills. And yeah, it's an interesting thing. Like I do.
00:16:17.946 - 00:17:04.230, Speaker A: I think it kind of depends on the situation, and it depends on the kind of risk. Put it this way, when you put out an artwork, there is a certain amount of risk, in a sense. Nobody knows what the kind of public response will be. And the more kind of edge unusual, shall we say, the more unusual your color combos are, for example. Or the more unusual your work is, I'd argue the bigger the risk, and I would argue the bigger the courage that it takes. But I take your point very much and I appreciate it, Lorna, this idea that really sometimes it's just about being kind of wowed and the excitement of just putting interesting colors together. Fair enough.
00:17:04.230 - 00:17:27.114, Speaker A: Fair enough. So here's Greg Greco. Let me see if I can load this up properly. So, okay, this is hilarious. So he actually had video. Remember how he's saying, look at all the fake drips and how well they're done and that's fine. Well, apparently they're real drips because Greco actually took video and wanted to show.
00:17:27.114 - 00:17:45.646, Speaker A: So you have to laugh at how the dog. And there I was like, well, that can't be real. Well, actually it is a real drip. So just hilarious. And the soothing music. I should actually stop that music. Case of the copyright police.
00:17:45.646 - 00:18:01.334, Speaker A: So pretty hilarious. I want to thank Pokebelly for the good video and review he gave. And also tell him that although these drops do not seem natural, I did not do them intentionally. I leave proof below. So. Too hilarious, Greco. Too hilarious.
00:18:01.334 - 00:18:22.816, Speaker A: And did we have. Yeah, I think that was it. Was there. Was there more? No, that was it, because the first was me discussing it. So that was funny. Now, I did bring up this book here, and I actually found it on Christie's as well. Remember I was talking about the book underneath my computer.
00:18:22.816 - 00:18:49.714, Speaker A: This is actually a brilliant book. It was based on a show at the British Museum. Yeah, the British Museum, which often has older stuff. They have the so called Elgin marbles, sometimes called the Parthenon marbles. In Greece, they call them the Parthenon marbles. But the Elgin marbles, they have incredible assyrian reliefs. All those works, like those countries want them back from the British Museum.
00:18:49.714 - 00:19:13.688, Speaker A: Some of their biggest treasures. Again, it's really interesting to see how colonialism has really reappeared as a subject in the last few years here. All interesting. Now, this is what I want to bring up. So as far as I can tell, this Jasper Johns from 1973. This is a screen print. Okay.
00:19:13.688 - 00:19:41.636, Speaker A: And I wanted to. You see how it looks like it's done with marker, you see, like this. Really beautifully done. And there's a few things going on here. I wonder if I can. No, I can't make it bigger, but there's a few things going on. First of all, the reason I'm bringing this up in regard to Greco, because I mentioned it yesterday is these drips here, because I suspect, and maybe wrongly again, maybe it's a really liquidy marker that Jesper Jones is using.
00:19:41.636 - 00:20:31.594, Speaker A: But I kind of suspected these drips were manually done, actually. Like, when you look at them up close, they kind of look like they're manually done. I'm not positive on that, but I think they are. And whether they are or not, it's an interesting subject, because, you know, this whole idea of the simulating the drip, and we see it sometimes in digital art, actually, often, maybe not oftentimes, but we see it now and then. It's not uncommon to see it. I've done it, and I've seen other people do it, simulating the drip, and I find it kind of an interesting just thing to notice this kind of artifact, because I'm okay with it. If anything, it might make it even more interesting.
00:20:31.594 - 00:20:54.312, Speaker A: And it's interesting to potentially see an artist like Jasper Johns doing it. And so one final, actually, a couple of more things on this. So this is a screen print, though. And remember, we were talking about traveling through the mediums. So this is very. I mean, you see it very much in the blues here. This self consciously, like, very marker ish, marker esque.
00:20:54.312 - 00:21:39.750, Speaker A: It looks like a marker, you know, used to make this image, but then it's screen printed. So again, traveling through the mediums, screen printing, marker, and even screen printing the drips has a very interesting effect. One other thing I want to mention as well was, again, just from a very technical level, the color. Do you see what I see with the complementary colors? You see orange done as an underpainting, basically, to the blue to make the blue really pop out. And what do you see underneath the red? You see the complementary color green put underneath to make it pop out. And I believe, yes, under the white, we have basically a dark gray. So contrast.
00:21:39.750 - 00:21:57.434, Speaker A: And there it is, this beautiful work by Jasper Johns, this beautiful screen print, which was at Christie's here. Flags won by Jasper John. A masterpiece of printmaking. I totally agree. It's beautiful. And yeah, this is on Christie's. If you put flags, Jasper Johns, 1973.
00:21:57.434 - 00:22:19.118, Speaker A: You can read about it. I should read about it, because maybe we'll learn a little more, but we need to continue with our show here. But maybe we'll return to that and let us just do this. So, Sabato. So Sabato has been having a ton of fun on Zora, the. I believe it's on base. Coinbases L2 on ethereum.
00:22:19.118 - 00:23:09.356, Speaker A: As of this tweet, there have been 888 total mints for Sabato's Nintendo glitch rom work. I'm still speechless and deeply grateful. Can we get to a thousand? So this work here. So all to say, you know, in the crypto space, in the kind of digital art, you know, x space, there is a, you know, it is worthwhile to, it is worthwhile to follow new things and to do new. To be an early adopter is what I'm trying to say. And so it might be worth people's while to check this out. So I am going to check this out very quickly, actually, and try it out for myself.
00:23:09.356 - 00:23:39.476, Speaker A: And here's another. I mean, the space is becoming incredibly competitive, I was saying on the spaces yesterday, because here's zero to one or zero one, which Santiago was mentioning and which I've seen a little bit on. You see this? You've probably seen it too. It's on avalanche, another blockchain. And apparently I don't think you can buy with money. I think you have to see zero cost to create collect. I think what it does is you just trade.
00:23:39.476 - 00:24:09.744, Speaker A: So you make work and you trade with other people somehow. So they just went live on August 17 and it's August 24. So again, in the crypto space, being an early adopter is well worthwhile. You might as well join this because if they do some sort of airdrop, you know, just like we saw with tea, it might be worth your while. Now, this is the, speaking of tea, this is zero one's page. And you can see they looks like they took it directly from Teia, maybe even versum. This looks like a direct.
00:24:09.744 - 00:24:37.982, Speaker A: It almost looks like they copied the skin. It's so close. But all to say, the art is probably the most important part of this. And it's cool to see a new art site on avalanche that. And so again, something else to check out and additions see here. So object or tezos has really, I think, influenced the space with additions, without question. I mean, even the look, look at the UI.
00:24:37.982 - 00:25:00.970, Speaker A: I mean, again, it says versum to me. Good news for Rosa Mankman. Oh, the power of a tweet. Hate it had to come to this. But guess who got paid today? So Rosa Mankman got paid by sotheby's at last. So likely the tweet helped out the post. So very interesting and just an interesting thought from unknown collector.
00:25:00.970 - 00:25:43.742, Speaker A: Artists deserve to get paid for their work. Artists deserve it to deserve not to wait months to get paid for commissioned work. Artists deserve royalties for their life's work nfts with royalties solve this because they are trustless and instant. And anybody who's been involved in a or knows people that have been in a contemporary art scene knows that getting paid, unfortunately, can be a very tricky business. Any freelancer knows this. I mean, we had Daniel W on, who was freelancing before he started doing more nfts. And every freelancer knows this, that getting paid is half the battle, unfortunately.
00:25:43.742 - 00:26:15.860, Speaker A: So it's no small thing to get your royalties and to get everything just trustless and instant. So do not forget why we are here. So, unknown collector with some interesting thoughts. Figments, also known as Kappen, playing with this, again, digital copy, uh, theme which I've. I'm really enjoying this conversation, I guess, is what I want to say. So let me just show you. So, a new work in the Figment series, and let me just go show you the different ones.
00:26:15.860 - 00:26:31.652, Speaker A: So, rgb, red, green, blue, so brilliant. There are three. And interesting to see which ones actually sell. They're all editions of five. The red is 28 tezos. I think it might be my favorite. Then there's the green, then there's the blue.
00:26:31.652 - 00:26:56.910, Speaker A: There's something kind of beautifully warholian about this. And again, as I like to call it, the tension of the digital copy. Here we see it again. And really beautifully done with this three and a half inch diskette. Really just different. And there again, in the top right, we see rgb and white when you put all three colors together digitally. So just more brilliant work from figments.
00:26:56.910 - 00:27:25.550, Speaker A: And look at how beautiful the disc has done. Again, like making it look easy. The temptation would have been to fill all this in, right? That's what reason and rationality wants to do when it's working. It wants to fill in the blank, fill it all in. Look at how beautiful that looks. So available on secondary still, these brilliant works of art, the warholian diskettes here are data green, data blue, data. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.
00:27:25.550 - 00:27:55.374, Speaker A: And here's just a really cool piece that Kappan posted, also known as figments, posted on Twitter here, just with an enigmatic s. And there's some s's here. So, captain, really doing interesting things. Doing very interesting things. Speaking of interesting things, RJ is back with another strange machine here coming today. Supplication. We kneel, pray and try to decipher.
00:27:55.374 - 00:28:39.680, Speaker A: And here we have another mysterious machine with this great hard shadow here. And again, these different fills from probably Mac paint. I think we saw it in the most recent, the RJ. With the impossibility of painting the sky or whatever the title was on that we saw in the user interface that there were all these different patterns here. So really nice use. So, you know, using Mac paint, I assume, and also using the Mac, the Mac OS as a kind of framing device here and again, kind of cycling through some what look like RGB and white, similar to cap in there. Brilliant and beautiful.
00:28:39.680 - 00:29:22.434, Speaker A: Speaking of brilliant and beautiful, axine. Axine. Axin. So making it look easy, making it look simple. Alone together, peer to peer, p two p. So kind of a, you know, again, crypto art with axin and kind of, you know, peer to peer, you know, crypto things going back and forth without a centralized authority and making it look easy again, putting these beautiful pixelated computers, one looking one way, one looking the other. Love the addition of the orange and what looks like kind of a nice blue, kind of a bit of a variation on the colors.
00:29:22.434 - 00:29:49.380, Speaker A: And then you see, like, the Pink come in. And probably my favorite part here is the distortion, the beautiful distortion that is. You see that. I mean, oxine is really, again, I always use this word with him, the dexterity. He is a ninja of the digital art space here. And so just more brilliance. And look at that beautiful matte black.
00:29:49.380 - 00:30:08.882, Speaker A: You see it contrasting with. With my background here, with the black background, that. That beautiful matte black. Think how much more beautiful it is because it's that matte alone together, p two p. Just a beautiful title here, too. Great work. And, frankly, $12, you can add this Beautiful Axe scene edition of 66.
00:30:08.882 - 00:30:30.204, Speaker A: I mean, pretty reasonable price. Unknown Collector had sent me check out this artist, Mason III. And it's like, oh, yeah, I know, Mason the Third. But I hadn't seen recent works. They escaped my notifications it here. So Mason III is one of my favorite glitch Rom artists, Rio Bros. Game system.
00:30:30.204 - 00:30:58.360, Speaker A: So it looks like a crop of Mario brothers here. So a beautiful glitch rom here. And it's a real interesting dynamic. Or, you know, the. How distorted. How incoherent is actually the word I'm going for. How incoherent can you make these glitch roms and still kind of retain a coherence of sorts where you go? It's not just chaos.
00:30:58.360 - 00:31:15.980, Speaker A: What I really like about this work is how far it pushes into incoherence. Okay. And so I just think this is really beautiful. I think it's a one of one for $21, you know, pretty cool for the one of one collectors out there. Amazing. The third. And there are some others here, too.
00:31:15.980 - 00:31:31.924, Speaker A: Here's a. One of one for 50. And there's lost in 1999. That one's 100. And remember, we started a show with this brilliant one of the question marks. I love that one. Kind of got a metaphysical feel to it.
00:31:31.924 - 00:31:46.286, Speaker A: Lost in 1999. So this is cool, too. And this one's $70. And who knows what game it comes from. But just a really. Just stylish work from Mason the third. And here's the other one.
00:31:46.286 - 00:32:06.492, Speaker A: Look at this snow. This one looks a little like it's been processed on a analog video processor. Kind of little bit glitched out here. It's a little bit of experimentation here. Rom corruption and hexedit. Game Boy color, but it doesn't say there is. So romputer.
00:32:06.492 - 00:32:28.032, Speaker A: Cool title. So 50 tezos. So all different type prices here. Silva Santus, glitch York. So another glitch rom here, and you see what looks like the Statue of Liberty and New York here. So just cool work from Silva Santuz. Three tezos, 30, and there is an addition of 13, and eight are left.
00:32:28.032 - 00:32:53.926, Speaker A: And Haiti rocket, of course, a master of the glitch Rom. Too cool. This one came out a couple of weeks ago while I was in Greece. And just another cool. Again, kind of pushing. How far can you push these works into incoherence while still maintaining a kind of coherence and a kind of narrative of sorts. Just really beautiful.
00:32:53.926 - 00:33:05.712, Speaker A: Really, really beautiful. Because you don't. It's understandable enough. And everything else is just kind of like visual candy here in the best sense. Look at this great japanese writing. Beautiful. Too cool.
00:33:05.712 - 00:33:22.520, Speaker A: Exactly. Another Haiti rockette work. These are classic Haiti rockette works. This is 30 tezos on secondary. There are 23 6 seconds long. And, yeah, just classic. Just, you know, all stuff from the Internet.
00:33:22.520 - 00:33:46.200, Speaker A: A great series by Haiti rocket. This nice dithered plane, an alien photoshop windows, and maybe some mortal Kombat imagery. Really pixelated out. Just brilliant. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant and beautiful, I might add. Let's just stop this. And continuing on, very interesting work from Sabato.
00:33:46.200 - 00:34:35.494, Speaker A: Kind of mysterious, who I think kind of pioneered this narrative, digital, kind of the strange kind of digital narratives, for lack of better word. Maybe we'll come up with better words and then just hear, like, this old retro computer with, like, you know, some sort of video in it. And then this bathroom and then this beautifully dithered or gradiented mirror and the cardboard boxes, the flattened out chandelier, you know, moving boxes in a bathroom, almost. Look at how long it is, too. Back to the chandelier. Just really stunning and interesting work. Again, you just think there's a lot going on here.
00:34:35.494 - 00:34:57.258, Speaker A: And I love the offshore firm. The offshore firm lieu of secrets. I mean, hilarious. Volume 213 33 on primary. There are 15 left for this avant garde work here. And here's just a really cool work by Spuegel's maskinen. Beep and kind of taking.
00:34:57.258 - 00:35:21.254, Speaker A: It looks like a kind of mask is getting. A diagonal mask is kind of being dragged through to hide everything and then reveal it again, this outline of a computer. Just beautifully done. Just really nice work on X. Lorna Mills with a car on fire in some beautiful colors here. Hot trotter. And just another just kind of stylish work here.
00:35:21.254 - 00:35:53.514, Speaker A: And that beautiful mustard yellow and the fire and smoke and everything. Just beautiful. As usual edition of 32. There are 23 left at 15 tezos. Renki with another just kind of richly textured digital work here with a lot of, like, what I want to call feedback, delay in feedback and just kind of letting it drag a little bit, creating these nice textures. And then you have almost like this RG. It is an rgb dotted background.
00:35:53.514 - 00:36:08.774, Speaker A: So more interesting work from Remkey. This is Chofu. Chofu. Some really interesting abstracts from Yuri J. The lastest one there are a few. Edition of five. Looks like it's sold out.
00:36:08.774 - 00:36:28.188, Speaker A: Let's just check here. No one has sold for five tezos. And, oh, they're still available. Wow. So they're still available. Let me just make it big here. And remember, again, this discussion, this, you know, I'm seeing it everywhere now, the tension of the digital copy.
00:36:28.188 - 00:36:55.322, Speaker A: So you see this, and we've seen this with Yuri J. Before. You see how it's kind of like a similar structure here, probably a similar source, but maybe treated differently. I'll write the last one. So there are a few of these, and they're quite original and quite beautiful here. And there is another one. And you see, you know, sharing these, like, there are certain structural elements that are being shared here.
00:36:55.322 - 00:37:18.164, Speaker A: You see over here in the twist. So, again, playing with reusing elements, as you like to say, epilogue. See you later. So here's some different colors and just treating things differently and making new works out of it. Very fun. This is a one of one for 50 tezos, so $35 for a Uri J. One of one.
00:37:18.164 - 00:37:38.866, Speaker A: Very cool. And this could hang in the same room here. Santiago cloud over the roof of the gas station right after here. And now these beautiful titles. Santiago is coming up with gimp, aspirite AI, and inkscape. So really combining a lot of things here and I believe this was either a commission. It is a one of one.
00:37:38.866 - 00:38:13.134, Speaker A: It's quite beautifully done here. Very original, abstract work. Again, could very well hang in the same room. And it went to enlightener vault. So on August 19. And here are a couple of recent works by Santiago playing again with. I think it's some dithering and I don't know what, like, all sorts of stuff, but this kind of style that we've been seeing for maybe the last two, two months or so, that he's been playing with a loud phone call edition of 15.
00:38:13.134 - 00:38:34.624, Speaker A: There are eight left at ten tezos, and here, local tale magic there, edition of 20 for five tezos. And again, playing with these repetitions here. I don't know if it's dithered. I don't see the same kind of dithering here. I would bring it up big, but I'm a little worried it's going to crash my mic here. So we will do that next time. Bring it up big.
00:38:34.624 - 00:38:56.252, Speaker A: Continuing on, Gozo. I think I got tagged on this. You know, it's funny, I had already seen it and it was already in the list. Someone tagged me pokebally. Check out this work, basically. And who listens to us? Digital collage by Gozo. I love how people can tell, though, what I'd already like, choose, or would love to feature, let's put it that way, on the show, Gozo.
00:38:56.252 - 00:39:31.208, Speaker A: So just a cool work here, a digital collagen and interesting. So, yeah, I'm not actually quite sure what's going on here. I mean, if anybody knows, feel free to let me know. But it looks like kind of digital, kind of processed. And, you know, these circular, almost like beads. And this looks like it's kind of digitally done. So who knows how this was made? You know who it kind of reminds me of, like, a little bit obliquely is graphica.
00:39:31.208 - 00:39:55.924, Speaker A: Graphica png. It kind of has that same kind of feel to it, just kind of a texture y kind of feel to it. Cool work by Gozo. Let's quickly load up their page. Oh, yeah. Okay, so Gozo makes these, like, really beautiful, what I'd call surrealist works here. And so here's a new one by Gozo.
00:39:55.924 - 00:40:11.756, Speaker A: Kind of different. And here's teenage lightning. Another one, maybe we'll look at that at another show. Let's continue on here. Pp NFT soldiers defending the metaverse castle. So pp universal with another interesting work. And you see it's kind of made of helmets here.
00:40:11.756 - 00:40:41.514, Speaker A: And maybe it looks like it's a castle made of helmets, interestingly so. Kind of a mysterious work. And maybe these are the different helmets that are used cycling through. And here are the mountains. And interesting kind of frame here too, I thought. Just another the textures that PP uses just are really kind of interesting and I guess delightful, for lack of better term. Six tezos edition of five and two are left.
00:40:41.514 - 00:41:11.286, Speaker A: And of course, a fan favorite, Tom Bambattle, who did a brilliant work. Also for Retro Manny, check those out. Retro Manny posted a bunch of comic covers and those about nine. And there's also an annual Adam in is also one of the artists. Anyways, Tom Bimbattle contributed to that. And it was a great space yesterday, by the way. Check it out on Retro Manny's Twitter feed, exfeed.
00:41:11.286 - 00:41:42.466, Speaker A: And so here is just a really nice work on foundation by bombadil and playing with fire here as a subject matter. And you see kind of really beautifully done here in the collar and also along the gas mask here as the skull comes through. Let's see if anybody has bid yet. Not yet. Very reasonably priced at 0.167 from Tombham battle on foundation. And here's just a beautiful work that stood out by mech txt here.
00:41:42.466 - 00:42:05.742, Speaker A: Kind of a nice landscape with maybe sunlight, maybe rain dropping through here on a lake with a mountain. And this wonderful framing device here. So beautiful. I love the frame as much as the inside. Like it's beautifully kind of presented. It's a beautiful setup here, we might say. So just a really interesting, great color.
00:42:05.742 - 00:42:19.486, Speaker A: Beautiful work from Mech TXT. Good night. And look who's back. Limbo. Hadn't seen from limbo for a while. An awesome title. Information superhighway edition of 33, available for ten tezos.
00:42:19.486 - 00:42:43.986, Speaker A: And that is on secondary. Let's just see what it sold for before we go back to the piece. Only five tezos. There's Haiti rocket. Yeah, so limbo is a classic. So great to see his work. And yeah, kind of has been playing in some of the last few pieces with this kind of gray green background and just putting in some of these kind of cyberpunk works, for lack of better term, and just really cool works.
00:42:43.986 - 00:43:12.976, Speaker A: And here you see the tvs, you know, the fuzzy snow tvs and everything. And there you see the mechanical arm. Just really, really classic limbo. Love his work. You see that game Boy. So maybe that's what we're seeing kind of in the visual look, even like the gray if I'm not sure if it was a. I think they had a green background, kind of like the color scheme looks kind of like early game Boy, like first edition game Boy.
00:43:12.976 - 00:43:28.856, Speaker A: Nicholas Dietrich. This came out August 12. Department of social Protection. Department of social Protection. I love it. And just a really, really nice work here. You know, pixel art's not as easy as it looks.
00:43:28.856 - 00:43:46.218, Speaker A: And I love how these stars, or maybe they're planes that are going across the sky or spaceships, not sure. Just super original work here. Great color, great everything. Nicholas Dietrich. Sold out, by the way, at fortezos. Each a cool 80 tazos. Beautiful work.
00:43:46.218 - 00:44:06.980, Speaker A: Necklace, Dietrich. And here's someone, this was someone I saw on Twitter spaces yesterday. I think they were in the spaces that we did actel. And look at this. And so just really cool, you know, dithered palm tree work. And so a new discovery here. Nice beech palm tree work.
00:44:06.980 - 00:44:23.296, Speaker A: And this is like three Tezos edition of five, all available. So a bit of a, you know, another discovery here. So. And this is the Maldives green emerald of the Indian Ocean. So just a really nice work. And here's some of the other work. Akdel.
00:44:23.296 - 00:44:51.590, Speaker A: So it goes to show that if you are, if you have a hard time getting your work seen, it does. It is worth your while to go to twitter spaces. And because people will check out your profile. If you're following people, people will follow you back. They check out your profile, and people are like, boom, okay, this person is doing stuff. So it pays to participate at the end of the day. And here is another one that is loading from the bottom.
00:44:51.590 - 00:45:12.378, Speaker A: I don't know if I've ever seen this load from the bottom. Anyways, a desert dune here. So just interesting work. 37 in the pixel art series. A window on life. So native ad playing with the Windows 95. I think it's just the Windows XP, just the Windows desktop, I guess they always have some sort of landscape here with clouds.
00:45:12.378 - 00:45:43.834, Speaker A: And so here outside the window is the Microsoft operating system. And there is you or me hunched over our little laptop here, almost similar to RJ. And the treatment of the screen, probably accidentally, I'm sure. And one other detail I just want to point out in native Ed's work, look how brilliantly the floor is done. Like this kind of shiny floor, you know, everything fuzzed out and mirrored out. Very nice. And even like the sky here, like or, sorry, the ceiling.
00:45:43.834 - 00:45:59.776, Speaker A: Interesting work. And then you have this strange sort of almost curtains on both sides. A window on life by native Ed. A one of one. And let's just see what happened here. Oh, it was 15 and 14 have been burned. Interesting.
00:45:59.776 - 00:46:21.124, Speaker A: Maybe you can put an offer in on that PNG affection by asleep. So another artist, this kind of reminded me of that. Can't remember what they're called. Off the top of my head there is a series. What are they called? I can't remember, but it kind of reminded me of a series that's out there. That's a whole bunch of people. I'll see if I can remember for next show.
00:46:21.124 - 00:46:43.624, Speaker A: Png effection super b generated in stable diffusion and mid journey. Collaged and processed in clip studio paint. So this is a bit of an AI work. I actually didn't realize that. I thought it was just kind of original and interesting. And here you see kind of some, you know, again, Microsoft operating system and whatnot. So for Tezos edition of 13, and there are 13 available.
00:46:43.624 - 00:47:08.384, Speaker A: And Rosatio has a signature with the Tezos art collective. It is three tezos. And we'll go back up to the work in a second. There are 75 left. And I believe it's quite, quite beautifully done, by the way, Rosatio, this is great. Really nice. And don't assume, as a collector, if you're interested in this work, don't assume it'll be here forever.
00:47:08.384 - 00:47:25.108, Speaker A: Cause I think they burn after a certain amount of time, the works. And then you have to buy it on secondary. So if you are interested, jump on in it. Really nice signature work by Rosatio and Katarina. Create autumn walk. So another just. I find this artist super interesting here.
00:47:25.108 - 00:47:52.990, Speaker A: Nice textures here. Again, the mind wants to rationalize this, so it wants to fill up the gaps here. And Katarina is, you know, expertly leaving it, you know, leaving the brushwork a little bit, which really adds to the whole work. Interestingly. So little details like that. And just a cool original illustration here. And just different, you know, from your fall autumn walk.
00:47:52.990 - 00:48:10.710, Speaker A: And just interesting clouds and everything. Let's see what's going on here. Two tezos, each edition of ten, and there are ten available. And Agugen, go to sleep. So more illustrations here. And this is edition of ten. And so I think on secondary for 30.
00:48:10.710 - 00:48:33.682, Speaker A: Sold out at Mech TXT. They're buying one. So interesting. Comforting myself under the thunder and lightning. So pretty original illustration, isn't it? Interesting kind of two color work here. And just looks like maybe a little bit of texture underneath, kind of paper texture and interesting lightning. Interesting treatment of the cloud.
00:48:33.682 - 00:48:47.390, Speaker A: Just interesting, original work here. And there's another one. Look at the water. So interesting. Artist Agugin. I'd never seen them before. Contemplation, seeking the unknown and the uncertainty that I always avoid.
00:48:47.390 - 00:49:02.594, Speaker A: Edition of ten for five tezos. There are ten left. So it is a little slower out there. You see this. These are new in the series, but other illustrations here. So playing with the blue and white, I quite like it. Give them a follow.
00:49:02.594 - 00:49:43.272, Speaker A: And paper Buddha, big shout out to paper Buddha, who I had a great connection with in retro Manny's space. Big collector of pulps and everything comics, orange sunshine. So this came out on the 23rd, so I think yesterday edition of 100. So I'm kind of re familiarizing myself with paper Buddha, because paper Buddha is one of these artists that I saw like very early on and knew existed, but hadn't seen for a long time. And here kind of rediscovered yesterday. So works with collage, but then puts effects, kind of digital effects, like this drop shadow on the collage. So it's not like simple digital collage here.
00:49:43.272 - 00:50:18.402, Speaker A: Like it's. It's. It is collage and it is digital, but you couldn't make it just with paper, is the point I'm trying to make here. And of course, this one moves too, adding to that. So just interesting work here from paper Buddha, who sometimes goes to antique stores, gets ancient pulps just to scan or print. We had a very interesting discussion on how, you know, not everything makes it onto the Internet, especially a lot of these like old pulps and whatever. Everybody assumes that everything is on, has been digitized, but it hasn't.
00:50:18.402 - 00:50:42.774, Speaker A: As many people know who have worked in like used bookstores. Not everything has, as I have, not everything has been digitized. So that is interesting. And you see it. We were discussing music, too. Not all music has made it on to Spotify, for sure. I mean, Spotify feels quite corporate in the sense of the things that are not on there.
00:50:42.774 - 00:51:07.604, Speaker A: YouTube music is a lot better because it has a lot more of just like random people uploading. You get pretty obscure things, but you still don't get everything. You still don't get everything. So it's an interesting topic. Not everything makes it onto the Internet. Not everything gets digitized. This was sent to me by my friend Ben, who is an awesome artist.
00:51:07.604 - 00:51:17.316, Speaker A: I've shown he paints the memes. If you've been watching the show, he's in Berlin here. Awesome, dude. He sent me this. Check this out. Oppner art, a day in Paris. A new approach.
00:51:17.316 - 00:51:31.794, Speaker A: Going to be doing some street scenes. Hope you like it. So I'm not sure if this is digital or not. Maybe let's just take a quick look. Opener abstract art. They're on opensea. Interestingly.
00:51:31.794 - 00:51:54.234, Speaker A: So interesting. Has a nice, you know, getting quite a few likes here. And as you can see, kind of, you see how they're trying this other style and then decided to try something new and look at how great it looks. So, you know, there are times to pivot, and this person has pivoted very nicely. I don't know where they're based or anything. Look at all the followers they have. So very impressive.
00:51:54.234 - 00:51:58.274, Speaker A: And that is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me. And until next time, take care.
