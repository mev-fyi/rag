00:00:05.800 - 00:00:32.822, Speaker A: We revisit the AI debate today while we can, when, while there's still time and while the sun remains behind the clouds. Artist Journal, November 16, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. I welcome you back. And we gotta run. We gotta run through this episode. Hopefully you're happy that we are going to do that.
00:00:32.822 - 00:01:00.878, Speaker A: So here we are. Strange thing has finished his contest. So he had this thug Lord burn contest for Thug Lord. Burn event winners. So basically we all remember this now viral iconic piece by strange thing, a watcher of this program from time to time at least. And yeah, thug Lord, he was asking people to burn it. There was a thousand, so only 82 were burned.
00:01:00.878 - 00:01:50.652, Speaker A: So you could enter into a contest where you could win one of these. So I thought a pretty nice work. And so, yeah, we're going to delve a little bit deeper into AI today. Just revisit that debate because someone was saying some pretty interesting things out there and I just want us to be on top of it. So, Tommy Hilfiger, you know what's interesting about this piece, it kind of looks like this cloak here, which is almost like a hoodie. Again, this AI fashion thing, this is very reminiscent of a painting of the Virgin Mary and also even like the cloak here. So it seems like the Virgin Mary has been used here and kind of fused with a Tommy Hilfiger model, basically.
00:01:50.652 - 00:02:24.686, Speaker A: Maybe from the website showing some clothes. That seems to be the fusion here that I see. Interesting, the six fingers, right? So a classic AI distortion. I really like this distortion here as well on the left hand. And just very cool as usual. And again, in that renaissance backdrop, this beautiful lighting here, this is the stuff that really kind of gets me with AI, is just like you have this new figure and then you just get these gorgeous shadows here. And again, the shoes and everything.
00:02:24.686 - 00:02:56.556, Speaker A: So very, very nice work from strange thing. Edition of ten sent to winners. So redrum here got one among other people. So congrats to him and to everyone. And here are a couple of more on road for Thuglord burn event winners as well, edition of five and Trapstar London. So I guess that is another clothing brand, another solution for the face. The face, you know, having, you know, messed around a little bit with AI tools, the faces do often have issues.
00:02:56.556 - 00:03:25.264, Speaker A: So you see different solutions here. On that last one, looked like the Virgin Mary was covered in darkness. And here you see like a, basically an unbroken phantom of the opera mask or something like that with, so someone with the phone. Interesting work. Looks like a street in Rome or something. And interesting contrast, too. I mean, here you have kind of like, what looks like an oil painting kind of vibe with here it looks like kind of a more drawing.
00:03:25.264 - 00:03:57.704, Speaker A: So interesting, interesting. I mean, the figure really does stand out as a result, though, right? And here's the final one. Gym time holders, raffle prize of Thug Lord, edition of 20. And so again, this beautiful drapery here, another solution for the face. And, yeah, nice kind of grand oil painting look. Renaissance oil painting look. And again, combined with fashion, again, seems like it's out of a catalog or something.
00:03:57.704 - 00:04:14.076, Speaker A: So very cool. And here's the work, actually, that I had to stop loading yesterday. And so here it is. Apocalypse. This is from almost a month ago, but I don't think we ever really looked at this. Maybe we did, actually. I think we did look at this proper when this did come out.
00:04:14.076 - 00:04:59.144, Speaker A: So again, if you're new to strange thing, he's been doing really well. He was on the front of hypebeast and a few other kind of almost publications that specialize in viral content. So he got, like, five or 10,000 likes on their Instagram, so he's doing really well. And never forget, I thought this was an interesting little piece. This AI art is dedicated to all the elderly out there struggling on their own day in and day out. You know what this reminded me of, which is why I included it, is Picasso's blue period in that kind of, like, for lack of better term, and it's not the right word, but a kind of desperation. Like, here is someone who looks like they're in pain, carrying a heavy load.
00:04:59.144 - 00:05:28.800, Speaker A: And it really reminds me of, like, the bohemians, you know, the guy playing the guitar and, like, all the sadness of Picasso's blue period. So I actually thought this was kind of like. It evokes a similar reaction. Interestingly, interesting little contrast here, too, where the plastic bags are in color. So nice little decisions here. Never forget another piece that will be minted as an NFT and auction in the future. All proceeds will go to charity.
00:05:28.800 - 00:05:53.332, Speaker A: We see Charles AI do that now. It's kind of an interesting thing. I mean, strange thing. And Charles AI are quite good at marketing. I mean, Charles AI kind of toots his own horn a little bit at how great he is at marketing, and we love his work, which is why we cover it here. But it is something I've heard from other artists here in Berlin over the years. It's like, yeah, donating your work to charity auctions are always a great way to get your work out there.
00:05:53.332 - 00:06:38.754, Speaker A: So, yeah, I don't know what to think. Like, if we have something from Charles AI coming up here, and it's like, well, someone's talking about marketing and then they do the auction for charity, does it undermine the that at all? But I think at the end of the day, you just have to go, someone's giving their hard earned labor for charity, and maybe that's just where it should end. And that's great. Right? So, continuing on, great comment from rune tune here. Interesting. I was just talking about the Bob Dylan goes electric pushback the other day in spaces, in Twitter spaces. It's uncanny, the level of coincidence that as our near simultaneous observations, reactions, thoughts and forming ideas.
00:06:38.754 - 00:07:10.880, Speaker A: Well, maybe we're onto something. Hey, if we're thinking the same things, maybe we're onto something. That Bob Dylan concert, in which the crowd boot him off the stage with his use of the electric guitar, is an example I like to think of when our digital art movements face a hesitation resistance or lack of acknowledgement by the mainstream. Sure, yeah. I mean, for sure. Yeah. And I think I was saying yesterday that yellow submarine, that octopus's garden was not.
00:07:10.880 - 00:07:49.648, Speaker A: It is on yellow Submarine. I was confusing my Ringo songs there from the Beatles. I mean, if you want a controversial take on the rock and roll front, I have a very controversial take from the last five years. I've decided in my own mind that actually the Rolling Stones have survived the test of time better than the Beatles. I get a lot of pushback from a lot of people on that, and maybe it's because in high school I listened to the Beatles literally to death. Like, I. You know, and I read the biographies, which probably wasn't good for me, kind of made me obsessed and, you know, just having that kind of life, and it was just probably terrible for me.
00:07:49.648 - 00:08:19.798, Speaker A: And now, like, I mean, you see through it and at least you hope to see through it. So, anyways, yeah, so there's another little opinion there for you. We might have to do spaces at some point here. A couple of people have mentioned it. There are some ideas kind of floating around. So we shall see. I like the concept in theory because it's a way of basically people weighing in with their voice, you know, on an equal medium, where it's not just me sharing my opinion, but maybe other people.
00:08:19.798 - 00:08:43.182, Speaker A: It's kind of like, you know, maybe you do it once a week where people push back, basically, or share their thoughts or agree. Right. You know, a real conversation. So something that's crossed my mind. And, yeah, the show continues to evolve, and it's a fluid situation. Anyways, big shout out to Aylay, who has been adding these. What would you call it? Like these recaps of.
00:08:43.182 - 00:09:02.480, Speaker A: There's a word for it. They're not chapters. Someone else was. But look at this, like, 739 803 Opensea statement, Twitter. So just kind of, you could put these in the YouTube. I mean, I'm so strapped for time, you wouldn't even believe it. So it's hard, like, for me to actually put these in.
00:09:02.480 - 00:09:20.216, Speaker A: But it's tempting. I mean, these are great. So anyways, huge shout out to Ilay for doing that. People appreciate it, too. Like, look at this. And look, if you're an artist, you're in it. You find out, oh, I just gotta go to 1630, and if I wanna hear about Peter Doig.
00:09:20.216 - 00:09:42.300, Speaker A: Anyways, so just very cool. Thanks, Ilay. Like, I mean, that's how great is that? And speaking of community and great community, Padreno and purple drank continue to put out their show, popular memetics. And they interviewed the great Bizaya on their latest. I listened to it on the way to the gym yesterday. So that was really cool. And, yeah, big shout out.
00:09:42.300 - 00:10:08.274, Speaker A: So they're interviewing people. So I just think that's just a great addition, you know. You know, what went through my mind is Terrence McKenna, you know, you probably, many of you know that quote, you know, create your own roadshow. Don't stop consuming all this media and create your own roadshow. And that's kind of what we're doing on this program. And there's Padrino and purple drink also doing it. I mean, you have enough people doing this.
00:10:08.274 - 00:10:44.744, Speaker A: Gets kind of crazy, doesn't it? You know, like, it just kind of like, where does that go? You know, where does that go? So anyways, an arthropo NFT has a bizarre work. Also, keep tabs on them. This week they have a few more drops. And also, Padrino put out his Tezos Tuesdays where he highlighted some works by artists in the community. And I missed, I haven't seen a lot of these artists. And shout out to digital baubles as well, who bought some of my work. So big shout out, bought the latest work to Elon Musk.
00:10:44.744 - 00:11:16.364, Speaker A: Yeah, so that's great. This one really stood out to me with the moroccan imagery patterns. And you know what this reminded me of is Brian Geysen. And I brought up some Brian Gyson here. I mean, you can see it, right? Like the. Yeah, I mean, just again, I think he accurately depicts it as, like, these moroccan kind of style works. And of course, here are works by Brian Gyson, of course, who is the co author with William Burroughs, the third mind.
00:11:16.364 - 00:11:57.736, Speaker A: And as we've pointed out in a much earlier episode, that the cut up method actually is quite similar in a weird way with AI art. And the cut up method, as far as I remember from the third mind, is that small book that's actually pretty hard to find, but it's out there, basically. They'd take a newspaper, they'd fold it into four, then they'd separate those four pieces, and then they'd just rearrange them. And then you start to read. So you kind of have the content of the present world, but completely reshuffled. And then I think, say, burroughs cut up novels. A lot of them were kind of created with that method.
00:11:57.736 - 00:12:40.894, Speaker A: But with Burroughs being an editor, he didn't just take it as is like the equivalent of raw AI. Like, he would edit it. And I think there's a lot to be said for that. So the analogy is not perfect, but what we see in AI is, you know, it's a bunch of references. So we're going to take this from over here and this from over here, and we're going to smush them together, and that's raw AI. And then you could argue, well, should there be an editor? Which we've had that discussion, and I think, you know, there's something to be said for the raw AI, as AI artists call it. Like, I think you just got to follow where the artist prompt, like, where the prompts take you, basically, where the art takes you.
00:12:40.894 - 00:13:00.338, Speaker A: Follow the logic of AI art. And. Yeah, but I think both. Like, I'll probably incorporate AI art at a certain point. I'll probably try and hide it, I think. But I don't know, you know, like, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. If I make some fantastic raw AI prompts, well, then I'll want to release those.
00:13:00.338 - 00:13:50.714, Speaker A: Like, if I'm doing this with raw AI, as Charles AI is, so this is a work I will put to auction, museum of preserved nature for a charity auction in Paris benefiting lawyers without borders. If you wish to bid, please contact token to me. So, donating a work again. So we see this as it's kind of a, I hate to be so cynical, but it's a common tool that artists use to market themselves. I am not rendering any judgment on it. I am simply highlighting it because it's something that, you know, again, this is for artists by artists, broadcast here, international to an international digital art scene. Small as our little group is here, and I just think it's something we should all be aware of, and that's kind of what's going on there, I suspect.
00:13:50.714 - 00:14:34.278, Speaker A: But, hey, all good if it's going to charity, right? And finally, Sam's betrayal, referring to Sam Bankman freed. He also, the two ETH reserve has been met. So Charles AI has made a fortune this month with his AI artwork. Like, he must have made, like, I'm guessing, like, $50,000 and maybe more. So incredible, right? He's doing well. Speaking of a ton of money, there's been a bit of pushback on super rare's rare pass genesis. This is weirdly similar to Arthropo's pass, isn't it, where you get a pass and then you get basically drops from several artists.
00:14:34.278 - 00:15:23.994, Speaker A: And so there's a bit of pushback on this. Yeah, you see, is ETH down to a dollar yet? So I can bid. And now that was at 40 ETH, now it's at 100 ETH. So that's $130,000. I mean, so my take on this thing, this pass, is if there are people that are willing to spend $130,000 on digital art, that's only good for us. What you don't want to happen is for it to be, you know, $500, because that means we're all out of business as far as our digital art futures are concerned or present. So I would, you know, my take is just enjoy the fact that people, there are people that are willing to spend big bucks on this art.
00:15:23.994 - 00:15:56.764, Speaker A: Look at what happened to Charles AI. You know, like, where was he three months ago? Okay, like, now he made 50 grand in a month. Us, maybe more. So, yeah, assume the best. And, you know, see the glasses half full, because art is a very, very, very challenging, you know, you'll wake up at three in the morning wondering, did I screw up? Royally? Repeatedly. And you just got to keep a positive attitude on these things, otherwise you can get down and you don't want to do that. There's no point.
00:15:56.764 - 00:16:12.908, Speaker A: And it's just waste your time. Don't waste your time is where I'm going with that. Look at this. We look at the displays. We look at displays and these, you know, digital museums and everything, and with great interest. So here's another one. Spatial IO.
00:16:12.908 - 00:16:31.868, Speaker A: This looks pretty good, doesn't it? I think it looks quite good. I mean, I loaded it up here. There are a couple of. A little bit of feedback. I would remove the moving water in behind because that makes. Because there's already a lot of movement here and so. Yeah.
00:16:31.868 - 00:16:40.314, Speaker A: But I'll tell you what I really like. Well, it was. Yeah, you see, it's a little awkward. Yeah. This guy's frustrated. That's me. I'm just.
00:16:40.314 - 00:16:53.814, Speaker A: I just want to see the work, you know, what was working. Yeah. So you see it's a little. Yeah, like. So anyways, I could go on and on. I just want to hit the arrow here and go to the next work. Okay, now it's working.
00:16:53.814 - 00:17:03.414, Speaker A: Kind of. Yeah. So I just want to go to the next work. I don't want to walk. I don't want to hit J or K. Yeah, he's not happy. That's me.
00:17:03.414 - 00:17:27.950, Speaker A: But anyways, good looking, isn't it? So just another kind of product out there. Again, feel free to disagree with all my opinions in the comments. And again, maybe there will be a spaces at some point here. It's on the radar. NFT power rankings breaking. Sony just filed a patent for in game NFT infrastructure for their PlayStation console. So NFTs are coming to gaming whether you like it or not.
00:17:27.950 - 00:17:46.622, Speaker A: There has been a lot of pushback, surprisingly last year from the gaming community that basically wasn't into crypto. And, you know, there's just a lot of crypto haters out there. But it's coming and it is inevitable. And. Yeah. So just a heads up on that. Just kind of interesting.
00:17:46.622 - 00:18:09.738, Speaker A: Bullish, right? Even in the midst of a bear market. Nike just announced they were. Did some announcement on rug radio a couple of days ago on Monday. So anyways, interesting. So just a work by limbo. Speaking of multimedia, I'm illustrating a book in real life. Very busy, but my new series of four pieces is completely planned.
00:18:09.738 - 00:18:20.938, Speaker A: So hopefully today I can go on with the first one. Enjoy your day. Stand with the arts and not with corruption. So. And just a really cool work. Again, that VHS DVD. So I haven't seen this on his object.
00:18:20.938 - 00:18:46.744, Speaker A: I'm not sure where this is. Maybe this is on foundation, maybe it will be released. But just cool work from limbo, as per usual, illustrating a book. Now here's a thread. We can't go into the whole thing, but I want to touch on certain parts of it. Why AI art might be the greatest democratization of the artistic process in the history of mankind. So an intellectual provocation that we can't resist.
00:18:46.744 - 00:19:36.216, Speaker A: And he basically says, since cave painting. So AI generated art has been around for years, but tools like Dali mid journey and stable diffusion have made it possible for amateurs to create complex works by entering a prompt words and commands into a text box. Right? So you no longer need to go to art school. And, you know, when Charles AI does well, I say this is great for us as an industry and just as artists, but there are artists out there who are mad about that. Okay. As we're going to see, the possibilities are endless. I started with Vqgan clip before progressing to mid journey and stable diffusion, spending hundreds of hours studying, refining, and testing different prompts.
00:19:36.216 - 00:20:24.284, Speaker A: So it's not like he's not practicing or she doc t the technology is as disruptive as it gets, which might be one reason why it's so popular among the NFt community. We like disruptive things and AI art and art, and AI art is both. And we're almost where I want to get to here. A clear sign for its disruptive potential is the tremendous outcry and loud criticism by artists and the art industry, although a growing number of traditional artists recognize its potential. But I will get to that later. I think there was a gagosian artist, what is his name? And I was sure he was using the old AI from like 2014, 2015 that Google put out. Was it DeepMind or whatever it was that looked like a van Gogh? And it was really kind of ugly.
00:20:24.284 - 00:20:50.538, Speaker A: I thought he was using. I'll see if I can dig that up in a future episode. Anyways, this is where I want to get to here. Art platforms such as for affinity, I've never heard of that. Newsground, which I've never heard of, or inkblot, which I've never heard of, have recently banned AI art. The fear amongst artists in the industry appears to be increasing by the day. On the other hand, AI art pieces are starting to win prizes.
00:20:50.538 - 00:21:33.542, Speaker A: And here we have this link and headline from the New York Times. An AI generated picture won an art prize, and artists aren't happy. So, you know, I, you know, I'm all for disruption and, you know, people not being happy about it, like, what do you, what do you care? And the thing is, if AI art is, you know, out competing you, well, maybe it's back to the drawing board, because I like a lot of AI art. Surprisingly, we're going to see some more. Like, I like strange things work a lot. But does that, do I feel like, as an artist, that's like, taking away from me in the slightest? It's like, no, it's like another artist. It's just another artist.
00:21:33.542 - 00:22:03.304, Speaker A: It's what we do here on this program is we look at other people's art and enjoy it. Other artists, other artists art that turns our head, and this is probably the work. And another thing on this is don't put too much faith in prizes for all, you know, this contest, this board of people, whomever they are, they're saying, hey, let's make the AI art win. It looks good. And, you know, it's gonna be great press. We're gonna get great press. And here they are in the New York Times.
00:22:03.304 - 00:23:00.604, Speaker A: Right? So, yeah, like, I mean, don't put too much stock in. Into these things. I mean, and just finally here, it will become increasingly difficult to recognize if a piece is the product of someone who invested years of training, failure, and experimentation to refine his or her skills, or of someone who, in a much shorter time, mastered the arts of crafting good prompts. And I guess that is the tension there, say, between traditional artists. I mean, again, if someone can do that and they're making art that turns my head, that I can't make in an afternoon, then what are we. What are you gonna do? Like, I mean, I'd say maybe you learn AI art, too. So, again, like, and they mentioned, like, the career, and it's not only the traditional artists who have reasons for concern about his or her career in the not so distant future.
00:23:00.604 - 00:23:48.124, Speaker A: And finally, take this example, and I find this an ironic example, I'll actually tell you, because it says, no photographer, no model, no makeup artist, no location, no costume designer, no agency. And then it shows this picture as if it's some huge victory. But I think if you're, like, the creative director making ads for BMW, you'd go, yeah, this looks like there was no photographer, no makeup artist, no location, no costume designer. Like, that's what you get when you have none of those things. But to be fair and to take doc t's point, we can see the trajectory here. And, like, if this costs basically, you know, if you know what you're doing, you could probably do this in ten minutes, maybe less. Right? And so I take the point.
00:23:48.124 - 00:24:45.010, Speaker A: AI art or AI will replace a lot of these jobs and make it much cheaper. So, yeah, so anyways, that is basically the meat and potatoes of it here that, you know, democratization. I mean, it's a funny way. Is that democratization? Because, put it this way, I'm not sure that's the right word, because anybody can pick up a pencil and paper. Like, what it does is it enables, I guess it does enable anybody, like, if you studied for the last, you know, 30 years and you're, like, accountant, and you're a professional accountant, and you kind of always want to be an artist. I guess that's a kind of democratization. But I guess the way I'd put it is nothing was stopping you from having everybody can afford a pencil for the most part, so there's nothing stopping you from doing it.
00:24:45.010 - 00:25:42.714, Speaker A: I think it's basically a great shortcut for people that want to make provocative and persuasive looking art and basically exercise their poetic faculty without having to put in 20 years. And I think that's great. I think it's good. I think the world will be a better place if everybody kind of has their inner poet at work, I would argue. So this is a good thing. If they're making beautiful images and they're able to express themselves, I can't help but see that as a good thing. And, you know, like, I wouldn't underestimate, like, to me, I'm not going to go out and freak out over AI art and people being successful, because don't underestimate that 20 years you put in in art, you know, in studying and trying and all that stuff like that is real knowledge from hard won experience.
00:25:42.714 - 00:26:12.150, Speaker A: So all I'd say to these people that are complaining is if you have in fact, put in 20 or 30 years, don't undersell what that is, what you've gained from that. And I'd say, get to work on AI. And let's see what you can do with AI. Because maybe it's 100 times more spectacular than what the accountant can do. And if it's not, then it's not. Then maybe the accountant's a better AI artist than you. It's not the end of the world.
00:26:12.150 - 00:26:27.414, Speaker A: So here is some AI art. Let's speed through this here. Doctor or DER Nadler out of Munich, Germany. Big shout out to him. So very cool. Japanese gas station AI art. It just screamed Ed Russia to me.
00:26:27.414 - 00:26:42.974, Speaker A: Ed Russia's gas station, which I brought up. And here's another one. Gas station ones. These are great, I think. Clownvamp. And I really like the, again, the AI distortion on the japanese writing. So the color is beautiful as well.
00:26:42.974 - 00:27:11.724, Speaker A: And that's something that, you know, this iconic work by Ed Russia, which is at MoMA, 1966 standard station here we have a better. Do we have a better? Yeah, this is huge. Actually, we have a 2000 pixel work, but you get the picture. Okay. And I think these are photos by Ed Russia. So maybe there's an influence there. But all to say, we always like to contextualize what we're seeing digitally here within the tradition.
00:27:11.724 - 00:27:43.600, Speaker A: I see huge value in that. So, continuing on, some other provocative AI artworks. So, moonchild, whose work we saw, I think, yesterday or the day before, this is a pretty nice work, I'd say. And here's another one. Good morning, friends. So instead of circles, kind of playing with almost tetris blocks, interestingly so just kind of speeding through. Here's another one, friends.
00:27:43.600 - 00:27:59.884, Speaker A: Here has been written about my art in AI. I'm surprised and very happy. You may want to check out the design collector blog to read this article. So someone's writing. So it's very topical right now, and so it's important that we revisit it. And here are some other. This looks like the blue man group guy.
00:27:59.884 - 00:28:28.156, Speaker A: So just interesting works that probably wouldn't have been made without. We can almost guarantee a lot of these works would never be made without AI. I don't know if this is AI, though. I assume it is. It sure looks like it. And so that is our kind of quick tour of AI. So just want to revisit that whole kind of debate and just reopen it up a little bit for us.
00:28:28.156 - 00:28:55.326, Speaker A: So here's a great work by Sabato. Nintendo Glitch Rom under the guise of echo. Very nice colors here, a one of one with voice of the ocean. So maybe this is a. Is this a gallery? Global movement to fight plastic pollution. So basically, it is a gallery of sorts. And here they have what looks like the name.
00:28:55.326 - 00:29:08.182, Speaker A: I can't remember. Sky Goodman. So anyways, I don't want to crash my mic here. This is a pretty nice work here. We'll risk it for this work. Yeah. I love those big, chunky pixels that Sky Goodman uses.
00:29:08.182 - 00:29:37.090, Speaker A: So here's another Nintendo glitch rom. If you don't like flashing images, there's quite a few in this episode coming up, so just more work. A big close up of an ilux rip. So the rip meme can continues and side hustle with a very nice kind of pixelated work. I think this is using graphics, too. So you see the lower resolution on this gif made on graphics two. Rip hen continues.
00:29:37.090 - 00:29:54.556, Speaker A: And morning exe. This is great. Is this available yet? A beautiful work by Hercules. I'm a huge fan of these computers here. So morning mourning. And so great work here. Retro tech.
00:29:54.556 - 00:30:22.144, Speaker A: And you got to love the details here. Like this bottom right corner, it's almost like this wrinkled paper. And it looks like this, you know, it looks like comic book kind of. Is it the Benday dot? You know, technology. And then you have the screen that is off, you know, nice poetic work from Hercules. A rare work from Hercules. Radda, put out a work, another rare work edition of eleven.
00:30:22.144 - 00:30:47.868, Speaker A: Buy for 111. Take a visit to the analog world and connect with the universe. Ground yourself. Kind of has a bit of a Robert crumb feel to it, doesn't it? And so anyways, retro tech here looks like an old walkman with some old headphones. You see the wire, his classic kind of rat characters, and a cat. So, having fun over there? A new rata. Yeah.
00:30:47.868 - 00:31:03.740, Speaker A: Visit the analog world. And I thought this was a great work. Another kind of, like you might say, in bad taste. But to me that's not really the point. This is by Turkarak. Another one. I keep coming back to Turkarak again.
00:31:03.740 - 00:31:43.856, Speaker A: I kind of see Turkarak in the province in the kind of the same category as die with the most likes, which is this kind of almost looking at the. And maybe that's not the right word for this piece, but the kind of maybe here, the hideousness of humanity, you know, kind of a scathing critique. I could feel like you could hang them in the same group show very easily. And here, nippy. So, you know, again, you know, in bad taste on purpose, you know. So a very nice one of one from Turkirak is that. Am I pronouncing it? Yeah, Turkarak, you know, Lorna Mills is someone else who works with bad taste.
00:31:43.856 - 00:32:04.170, Speaker A: And she says it, you know, I think proudly. And she's a great artist. So sometimes it's done on purpose, obviously. Louis Osborne, with a new one of one as well, already has an offer of 300 tezos. So another what I'm calling portrait of a clown. So just very cool. I love the color, this kind of purple background.
00:32:04.170 - 00:32:45.470, Speaker A: It's looking good. Collection of animated people by Lewis Osborne. Tooks with some more AI art assistants. So toques uses AI as a, you know, and edits it, in other words, so uses Photoshop in post production here. I thought a pretty good looking abstract work here. This could easily be some, like, album cover, you know, as we were saying yesterday, NFTs kind of combine, like trading cards, art, first of all, trading cards, comics, vinyl, twelve inch covers or vinyl album covers. It all kind of gets unified into one.
00:32:45.470 - 00:33:08.316, Speaker A: I mean, this looks like a CD that I would have bought in 1998 somewhere in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. So here is some other. Okay, so we have some generative art here, as I kind of speed to the ending here, but pretty provocative. Interesting stuff going on. Chroma Cube, I think this is by Jason Dartford. Minting starts in an hour. And that was last night.
00:33:08.316 - 00:33:36.726, Speaker A: So I thought a pretty good looking. This is FX hash, right? So pretty good looking generative art, right? Pretty good abstraction. Again, you could hang this with Max Drecker in the same room playing with these cube abstractions. Here's another one. Fungi bull is saying, I still can't believe this is generative art. And yeah, look at this. So this is paper crane with a programmer whose name we're going to see here in a second.
00:33:36.726 - 00:33:50.250, Speaker A: But I mean, again, this is generative art. This isn't. This is all programming. So it looks pretty advanced, if you ask me. And here is another work. Yeah, rich pool with Rick a. Crane.
00:33:50.250 - 00:34:10.506, Speaker A: So rich pool is the programmer, I believe. Look at this work. Feeling very lucky to own the only micro giant acequia, number 274 in the collection's primary icon colors. I can't stop watching the water flow. Truly breathtaking. So this is probably a still version. This probably moves.
00:34:10.506 - 00:34:25.100, Speaker A: And look at this. So they have done a beautiful job here. And we've been following paper crane. So it just goes to show, like, anybody can do this. And look at this in the physical world as well. High resolution. This is rich pool.
00:34:25.100 - 00:34:47.634, Speaker A: I think the kind of the programmer, I think, I think. I'm not sure on that. Maybe it's just two artists collaborating. Very possible. High resolution, print friendly versions of each acequia mint are now available as a small thank you to those who collected at the top. Rick and I would also love to send a print to holders of number one to 17. Drop a reply if you own one of these.
00:34:47.634 - 00:35:06.778, Speaker A: So look at this. So works very well, is a physical work. And they did a really, really nice job with signatures at the bottom there. And look at this. So you can actually do this yourself. Okay. Like, look at how great this all looks.
00:35:06.778 - 00:35:29.638, Speaker A: So just super cool. And if you go to their, they have a website, Richpool art, high resolution downloads. Below you can find links to the original mints in 8000 by 12,000 revolution. For best printing results, I recommend using Hannemulla photo rag. I'll second that. And if you prefer more texture, then german etching also works well. Yeah.
00:35:29.638 - 00:35:50.256, Speaker A: If you're looking for high quality paper to print on Hanamula photo rag, paper is excellent. Please use these as you wish. That's a great thing to know. Okay. Because you can do a lot of exploring before you figure that out. Please use these as you wish. And if you do any, make any prints, then Rick and I would love to see them shared on Twitter.
00:35:50.256 - 00:36:06.364, Speaker A: So I loaded up one of these. And here it is. And it's just massive. Right? So pretty cool. So you can print out your own free art. Here's some more generative art. That was just kind of, again, crossing my desk that turned my head.
00:36:06.364 - 00:36:22.974, Speaker A: Is this Daniel King? Love my pink mint. Okay, so, no. This is Lucas Reveal. So on FX hash, Daniel King, who is an artist that we've actually covered here, has minted this. Like, look at how good this looks. So a work by reveille S. Lucas Revel.
00:36:22.974 - 00:36:46.178, Speaker A: And this is also by Lucas Revel. So I assume from the same series, unconnected. Just kind of really cool. Really cool. FX hash work continuing on feels was something kind of out of the ordinary for feels, just a experimental, abstract work. Voidcore. One day you will miss this.
00:36:46.178 - 00:37:08.806, Speaker A: Until then, limitless suffering. So, unfortunately, it feels seems to be a little of a depressed character. So hence maybe the name. Oh, and these only sold for one tezos edition of eleven. Wow. Because usually feels sells for, like 100 tezos, each edition of ten. An artist I've never seen before.
00:37:08.806 - 00:37:33.350, Speaker A: Also with voice of the oceans, Varkito Garcia. So just pretty interesting, like pixel artwork that I've never seen anything quite like it. Now, you might not have either, but we have actually seen Varkito's work before. That's the person who did this Gif right here. That was pretty experimental that we saw about a week ago. So there you go. Very interesting.
00:37:33.350 - 00:38:07.254, Speaker A: You know, transdisciplinary artists from the Dominican Republic and the web. You know, I was also thinking, you know, there's a great quote that I remember from the late nineties from Agoa artist Coxbox, Koxbox. And there's a guy called Frankie, Frank E. And he had this great quote that I never forgot. And he said in the post world wide web age, nationality means nothing and taste everything. And I love that quote. I never forgot it.
00:38:07.254 - 00:38:31.560, Speaker A: It just went instantly burned into my brain. I thought that was just such a great quote from the web. So uses computer drawings, installations, and audio visuals. So I think actually a pretty serious artist here. Varkito Garcia and more flashing images. Web zero verification from Euxine. Deviating from the traditional palette a little bit, playing around with brushwork.
00:38:31.560 - 00:38:47.936, Speaker A: So good to see the experimentation here. Oxyn. It's always courageous to do stuff like that. Web, what is it? Web zero verification. Not jpeg. Okay, so buy for 950. So available fairly cheap for his work.
00:38:47.936 - 00:39:10.704, Speaker A: Edmarola. With this great work, I think we got some audio. We've seen works like this by Edmorola before. And I love them all the music. I just love the music. So, yeah, I'm just a huge fan. I have a few of these.
00:39:10.704 - 00:39:23.814, Speaker A: I should buy this, actually. Only two tezos edition of 25. Yeah, super cool. I'll probably pick that up. Tago Green from Ed Morolla. Another work from sad girl. I miss this one.
00:39:23.814 - 00:39:42.644, Speaker A: And again, it looks like a dark sailor moon kind of bitmapped out. Love all this text. Super ego. Really interesting artist. Sad girl. And another work from native buy for one tezos and stairway to Henven. So another rip hen work.
00:39:42.644 - 00:40:00.240, Speaker A: Playing around a bit with the figures again. Because again, native Ed used to be purely what I'd call animated abstract. But now entering the figure is entering the works. Really nice combination here. Like, is this a gif? I think it is. It's a gif. Easy to forget.
00:40:00.240 - 00:40:12.424, Speaker A: This is not a video. This is a gif. So very nice work here. Uh, yeah. Five second gif continuing on. This definitely turned my head. This is by Kako.
00:40:12.424 - 00:40:51.336, Speaker A: I don't know where I'm gonna mint this, but I want to do something for the special buyer with the light and the dark version separately, but don't know what. We've seen that before. Where the light and the dark version are sold separately. I like that. I think it's fun because why not? So just an interesting work here. The world is an imperfect place, that's for sure. Just a cool work, right? Sometimes there's not much to say other than that, you know.
00:40:51.336 - 00:41:11.684, Speaker A: Another work from rare. So a figure of a man ready to strike. So with his. And look at this. Created with the assistance of AI. Manipulation of reference photo digitally illustrated from the ground up with liberties. So this is kind of more the kind of way I would probably incorporate AI in, which is just using it as a kind of.
00:41:11.684 - 00:41:37.326, Speaker A: Sort of like Burroughs and Geysen were using the cut up method. You know, using it as a stimulant, basically as something to vibe off of. And maybe you take 80% of that and then you make it your own. Or maybe you just put it as a layer underneath and you just use it as your, you know, your guide, so to speak. You know, trace it out. And then you kind of make your modifications modify accordingly. So nice work from rare.
00:41:37.326 - 00:41:52.718, Speaker A: Sold out at 15 tezos each. So that's pretty nice. And a work from the isolationist. Quite a nice work. Spatial awareness of pain. An intense work. Pretty interesting artist, isolationist.
00:41:52.718 - 00:42:05.594, Speaker A: We've looked at his work before. So this is on object. Interesting green here. Interesting brushwork. I believe a native digital painter and we are almost done here. So nice work. Buy for 35.
00:42:05.594 - 00:42:20.942, Speaker A: What did it sell for? Mint price was 27. So pretty nice. Moody work. Spatial awareness of pain. And look at this. Diego has sold a physical work of a digital painting. And this also looks great.
00:42:20.942 - 00:42:41.018, Speaker A: So very, very nice work. And look at how great this looks. You can even see Diego here, his outline in the glass. So anyways, happy. Yesterday I sold this physical artwork from my digital photo painting. So again, multi chain and multimedia over here. Thank you once again for watching everyone.
00:42:41.018 - 00:42:42.914, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
