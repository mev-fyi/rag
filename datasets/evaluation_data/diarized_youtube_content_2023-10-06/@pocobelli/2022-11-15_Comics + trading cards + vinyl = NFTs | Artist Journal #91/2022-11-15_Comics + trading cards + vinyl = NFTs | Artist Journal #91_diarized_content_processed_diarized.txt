00:00:05.640 - 00:00:39.204, Speaker A: Good morning, everyone. I hope you are doing well. Thank you very much for the support on Twitter. I think that is the most I've ever gotten on a single video. It's grapes. Artist Journal, November 15, 2022 in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokerbelly and I welcome you back as you have welcomed me into your lives in this humble channel with these humble tweets.
00:00:39.204 - 00:01:12.472, Speaker A: One day at a time, we make our little progress an incremental path forward. It is fun to think about what would happen in 200 episodes or 700 episodes from now, should the marathon, you know, continue and even intensify. But my friends, I know you do not have much time, and I do not have much time. So let's get started. This is a sprint today. Harry Pack. I've never heard of Harry Pack before, but this turned my head.
00:01:12.472 - 00:01:54.634, Speaker A: It was on Twitter. And this is the great thing. I mean, Twitter, you know, as far as discovery is concerned, particularly for digital artists, like, it's not even close to Instagram. Like, it's so much better for discovery. Isn't that interesting? I mean, to state the obvious to probably everybody who's watching this, or 80% or 90% of the people watching, if this is news to you, it probably means you don't have a Twitter account, which probably means I would kind of recommend it. And, you know, all politics and everything aside, I would just for the digital art, and you can figure out the rest yourself or block out the rest or whatever, but I would highly recommend it as far as. Look at this.
00:01:54.634 - 00:02:16.722, Speaker A: Like, this is someone posting and some post, like, oh, what do you recommend? And this person's recommending Harry Pak. Aliens and psychedelics is recommending Harry Pack. That brings me back to my go a trance days. Okay. And so here's a couple more. So super rare artist, super cool artist. And again, it has that yellow submarine vibe from the Beatles.
00:02:16.722 - 00:02:33.930, Speaker A: I brought up some images that we can look at. This is much more detailed, though, and frankly, the color is a little more exciting. Actually. Quite a bit more exciting. We are in 2022 after all, and not in. What is that? 68, 69. And so, yeah, so just really interesting.
00:02:33.930 - 00:02:50.298, Speaker A: Kind of underwater a little bit here. We have this octopus in the sky. Almost an octopus's garden here. But that is Sergeant Pepper, isn't it? Either way, very cool. I love this work. Beautiful, beautiful work. Let's see if it was sold.
00:02:50.298 - 00:02:59.922, Speaker A: Minted October 22. And Harry Pack. I saw a sale here. Yeah, look at these. These are just like. They're beautiful. It kind of has a little bit.
00:02:59.922 - 00:03:10.378, Speaker A: It's kind of like yellow submarine meets Lewis Osborne. A little bit that kind of illustrative style. And look at this. This one just came out. I think I brought it up. Yeah, here it is. Cloud sinker.
00:03:10.378 - 00:03:26.724, Speaker A: Great title, Harry Pack. So just kind of bit more on the Sci-Fi angle. So just very interesting. All these tubes and everything. Enough to. I'm sure that'll sell. Yeah, like November 12, just minted.
00:03:26.724 - 00:03:40.816, Speaker A: Interesting color. Again, here's some yellow submarine. Let me just back up. This was actually a double ep, guys. I actually had this. I didn't. I wasn't a huge vinyl collector, but that's a seven inch mono.
00:03:40.816 - 00:04:39.494, Speaker A: See that mono? Isn't that crazy? I was thinking to myself in the shower, you know, like, it's crazy to think that the Rolling Stones are going at the same time as this and Bob Dylan, and they're still going. And I think they have a private competition in their minds of who will be the ultimate rock and roll survivor because they're basically there at the start. I mean, how poetic would it be for Bob Dylan, who, with, you know, bringing out his electric guitar at whatever festival that was shockingly, rather than an acoustic, you could argue that was a seminal moment in the history of rock and roll. Without question. I'm not an expert, but as far as I understand. And wouldn't it be poetic for him to be the final kind of, you know, the ultimate rock and roll survivor out, survive everybody from, you know, the heyday, what we might even consider the golden age of rock and roll? That sounds kind of. That sounds like the 1950s or something.
00:04:39.494 - 00:04:55.154, Speaker A: Anyways, so you can see some of the art here. I was looking at the double Ep. I got distracted. Let's look at the art. Beatles, yellow submarine art. So just to give you a clue, some context and some comparison. Compare and contrast, as I used to say in my english literature classes.
00:04:55.154 - 00:05:10.474, Speaker A: Compare and contrast. So here we can see this is like fan art, so don't. So. But you see what I'm saying? But quite different, actually. Like this is a little bit more. I'd almost call it a little bit more cartoony. This looks like.
00:05:10.474 - 00:05:39.348, Speaker A: What is the name of that artist? Maybe we can just quickly find out who the name of that artist is because it actually. It actually looks like someone. Animation producer George Dunning. Interesting. It reminds me of someone who's a very famous psychedelics 1960s artist. I want to call him Peter someone. Maybe someone knows the name.
00:05:39.348 - 00:06:04.598, Speaker A: Feel free to. If you do know the name, leave a comment. So anyways, another work, again, kind of has a bit of an underwater kind of vibe to it. It almost looks like a submarine, but it's beautiful. And it's totally different, as you can see. A bit more psychedelic, interestingly great kind of sky, quote unquote, or top of the sea, whatever it might be. And finally you can you see this kind of illustrator style again.
00:06:04.598 - 00:06:32.858, Speaker A: This could hang in the same room as a Lewis Osborne, couldn't it? So finally, actually, and here is some audio. Let's see if it plays. Beautiful. So it looks pretty cool animated. I love the octopus here, the dots. And the music's quite, quite right, isn't it? Very cool. Again, like, truly psychedelic.
00:06:32.858 - 00:06:57.078, Speaker A: Not just in name, but in spirit. And here we are, very happy to be included in no frontiers art digital art exhibition at Gallery radius Center. See, like this. Probably don't even have a Twitter. You know, the show will be part of. Most of my artist friends don't have Twitter. I mean, we've talked about this and I think they should probably change that, but yeah.
00:06:57.078 - 00:07:24.676, Speaker A: So the show will be part of the luminaria sa, which is a nonprofit art that manages granting. Okay, so some organization. Contemporary art festival in San Antonio. So I assume that's New Mexico, November 19, 2022. Curated by Nain Leon, who I just gave a follow to, currently working with Canon Latino America. So anyways, Harry Pax making moves. Congratulations.
00:07:24.676 - 00:07:41.660, Speaker A: And what else? A couple of comments here on yesterday's show. Got a lot of views there for 24 hours. Not even. That's like 20 hours. So it's growing over here. Respect royalties. Community based chains assure all parties are respected.
00:07:41.660 - 00:08:02.116, Speaker A: Also, your comment about NFT art and Tezos is spot on. This is collector's heaven. Absolutely. In more ways than one. I bet people will look back at, like, times like this. Like they looked at Cardano at $0.02, you know, as far as, like, art collecting, you know, in five years, ten years, who knows? Not financial advice.
00:08:02.116 - 00:08:25.418, Speaker A: So. Okay, so opensea. Opensea has come out with another. An additional comment statement, and it's interesting. This is the modern press release on Twitter. Another reason to basically, like, I'm not here to show Twitter, but another reason, I don't think I need to shell Twitter to this crowd. It's like all Twitter people for the most part.
00:08:25.418 - 00:08:57.724, Speaker A: Probably 80%, I'd imagine. But it's like the modern day press release. And we all know this. After hearing the passionate voices from the creator community last week, we believe marketplaces should honor a creator's choice to set fees on existing collections, not just new ones. So we already knew this, but the news here is they're going to be putting out this tool. Last week we launched a marketplace filter that collections can use to protect, to protect creator fees. So it's kind of like a full 180 to their credit.
00:08:57.724 - 00:09:39.104, Speaker A: So to protect creator fees across the NFT ecosystem. So they've kind of taken the moral mantle, which is kind of the long term move. And I think it's a much more devastating move for I think it's blur is the competition blur IO who's been taking all the volume. And I think, yeah, they're taking, hey, you can go over there, but if you want to be on the side of artists and creators, you can hang out here on Opensea. And in fact, we even have tools. As a reminder, this tool is a v one and is intended to give creators the choice to protect their business model by blocking royalty evading transactions. And then they have a very confusing tweet.
00:09:39.104 - 00:10:11.534, Speaker A: Maybe someone can figure this out for me. If a marketplace is on the list to be filtered, we will remove it. If it respects creator fees for new projects with on chain creator fee enforcement going forward, it sounds like we will keep it, not remove it. And b, it protects creator fees for all existing projects. So I just don't. Maybe the filter is removed anyways, it got a little too. I was doing Geotrig there just to figure out what they're talking about.
00:10:11.534 - 00:10:41.554, Speaker A: All to say they have a filter or a tool that they're working on to protect royalties. So I'd say it's a pretty smart move. A quick update on the art Thurpo. I almost want to call it a festival, but minting week here. While our website updates, we have four passes remaining and four editions of the backyard smacked down by gloom tube. So again, I consult with these guys every so often. Mint arthropod XYz is where you do that.
00:10:41.554 - 00:11:04.162, Speaker A: So again, gloomtube and others on Ethereum. So very cool. And again, that's headed up by Mikey de la Creme, a pillar of the Tezos community, if you're not aware. Also, this is interesting. Fake whale, who kind of puts out these additions. The next artist minting in the fake whale vault is Nicholas Sassoon. So interesting.
00:11:04.162 - 00:11:28.444, Speaker A: Congrats to Nicholas Sassoon. And I guess I'm not sure if this looks like a vault, so let's see what that turns into. Always interesting what they're up to there. And also on the cross chain front, clown vamp, I almost want to say, finally is on super rare. I'm almost surprised he isn't the journey is just getting started. Excited to be a super rare artist. Genesis coming in December.
00:11:28.444 - 00:12:08.974, Speaker A: So congrats to clownvamp. Pretty cool image there. Again has this pulp 1940s and fifties pulp sort of feel mixed with like an oil painting vibe. You almost wonder, you know, if that's in fact some of the source prompting and images tomorrow from Morlatkos. And I just had to highlight this also cross chain, I think this is on bitcoin or however they do the rare Pepes tomorrow new XCP wood card. So I just love how first, Morlakos has his own style with all these kind of lines and everything that's kind of original and cool. And then I love how he adds this pixelation element.
00:12:08.974 - 00:12:37.134, Speaker A: Like, just again, he reminds me of oxyn and his total creativity. So we'll be watching for that. So Glitchtown arcade, aka Glitchtown, has a new work which fasten your seatbelts. Yeah, that is the name of the show, I think. Get ready for an interdimensional travel. And so again, experimenting with the Nintendo glitch rom software in all sorts of ways. So super interesting, a lot going on here.
00:12:37.134 - 00:13:13.448, Speaker A: So I continue to be totally fascinated by this whole genre, which I want to join at some point. Edition of 30 mint for three tazos. And yeah, so he has begun to sell just this morning. So that is Glitchtown Arcade, aka Veto, who sometimes comments on this show and limbo has released his piece, and he actually put out a tweet saying, you better get this, I might pick this up right now, even though it's twelve and the mint price was like three. Well, let's just take a quick look, actually. Yeah, it was. Yeah.
00:13:13.448 - 00:13:39.684, Speaker A: Buck 150. You gotta love it. It's almost kind of old school to do it so cheap, isn't it? So anyways, really, really, really cool work for the rip Henry. And this is something that I really liked. First piece of the coded memories. It was actually here limited series. Because you know what that made me think of is comics and like, the Punisher limited series.
00:13:39.684 - 00:14:25.596, Speaker A: And, you know, especially Marvel comics and DC, but especially Marvel when I was, like, big into comic collecting in, like, the nineties, early nineties, the heyday, one of the heydays, I guess you'd call that the Bronze Age limited series were great ways of selling things and just getting people excited because there's an endpoint you could collect them all. And it made me realize that. It made me think that nfts are almost like this comic culture. Like the COVID meets trading card culture meets almost vinyl culture. Like vinyl twelve inch. Like we're seeing with yellow submarine there. It kind of all gets mashed together and all you need is a song underneath here.
00:14:25.596 - 00:15:05.904, Speaker A: And sometimes there are songs underneath here and you kind of have almost like. It's like comic manga art meets almost like a trading card border here, right? And almost like the composition from a trading card with all you need is music and like it's kind of all coalescing into this thing, you know? And isn't that interesting? I mean, so that's what that limited series language just kind of, you know, the chain reaction it caused in my brain. Anyways, super cool work. I'll probably pick that up as this uploads. As this uploads. Yeah, don't worry. There's another one for twelve.
00:15:05.904 - 00:15:28.634, Speaker A: New work by popple. And I thought this color is brilliant. I guess it's a turquoise. Doesn't it just go beautifully? Like a blue green, aqua deep green, blue, deep turquoise. I guess you'd call it saturated. A new oneple from the Pixel Langton series. Portanus decapoda.
00:15:28.634 - 00:16:22.344, Speaker A: Again, I love this scientific side of things. Again, as I mentioned previously, it reminds me of Ballard's take on science fiction, which had the emphasis on science and not so much about these aliens and whatever, but as he says, Earth is the alien planet and here you see it, right? And then definitions. Portness crabs drift throughout their larval stages in asteroid belts. Again, playing with science and putting it into this science fiction context. So I guess this is outer space. They are difficult to sample due to their complexity of their habitats, making their lifecycle and migration patterns pattern understudied. So this is true science fiction again, what Ballard called the true authentic literature of the 20th century with its emphasis on science and technology.
00:16:22.344 - 00:16:55.266, Speaker A: So there you go. Bye for six. This beautiful work again, screaming to be screen printed. And here is a work by Ed Marolla, a one of one somewhere far this sold, I believe, 20 tezos. Just nice and easy. You know, it's great for the artist and it's great for the collector because the collector gets a one of one for $20. And the artist, you know, it's like a day's work, okay? That doesn't replace your regular salary gig or whatever you're doing to make money, but it's a significant chunk.
00:16:55.266 - 00:17:30.713, Speaker A: All of a sudden you're getting $20, you know, so you just want to grow and grow that until maybe you have the 150 or $130 you need to replace your salary on a regular basis, hopefully more anyways, let's not get distracted by the financials here. Look at this great border. Love that border. Very interesting. And just another mysterious work, isn't it? Just a mysterious pixel artwork from Ed Morolla somewhere far. So I like it. It's nice not to be able to figure things out.
00:17:30.713 - 00:17:51.108, Speaker A: Yes, I can tell this is a stairwell. Yes, I can tell this is some sort of architectural structure. So it's kind of where abstraction meets representation. It's just hard to. And look, there's a person down here, so we have a space. It's very cool. Right? So continuing on.
00:17:51.108 - 00:18:12.098, Speaker A: And this is an artist who we saw, I think, limbo retweeted this. This is someone we've looked at earlier. And I'll actually just bring it up. Remember, I think we looked at this one. So that was awesome. So minted on hen or on tea, I should say. And I think it's a reference to rip hen event.
00:18:12.098 - 00:18:34.274, Speaker A: So a beautiful pixel work. How much is this? And I love how it's black and white here in the pot. And then the plant has. It's actually a very, very creative work available. There are tons available plants with a z for 1.11 tez. So probably add that to the collection today as well.
00:18:34.274 - 00:19:04.774, Speaker A: Continuing on. So another work by Dan control is we continue to explore, to watch his explorations into ASCII art here. So interesting color. This is called fireworks, I believe. Interesting subject matter. A great explosion of emotions. So text and image again, we were talking about asemic art, where the meaning of the words are divorced from the visual component.
00:19:04.774 - 00:19:22.644, Speaker A: And we kind of see that here. Drawing with letters. Drawing with text art or with text characters. Digital text characters. Continuing on, a few works by Max Drecker that he released here. Interesting kind of new color. Green and orange, of course, complimentary on the color wheel.
00:19:22.644 - 00:19:44.696, Speaker A: And again, kind of playing with that AWP art side of things. And almost a touch of Escher here in his very kind of consistent style. Buy for a Tezos. So very cheap. And also here, there's a one of one. And I don't think we looked at this one yesterday. Maybe we did this, went for 60, and then there was another one.
00:19:44.696 - 00:20:09.370, Speaker A: And this is available for 60. A one of one. So, yeah, so a few works by Max Drecker here. I wonder how many he sold. Just out of curiosity here. Yeah, so he sold 74. So in a sense, as far as making money, this at one tezos was the better, you know, made more money than the one of ones.
00:20:09.370 - 00:20:33.006, Speaker A: So that's kind of interesting. In and of itself. Isn't it a new work by Lewis Osborne? You'd probably have to go to his twitter to find out how it works. It's probably a lottery. Cause I see a lot of people betting next to nothing or offering next to nothing. Add some color. And so there you go, his classic kind of happy face, sad face, people bouncing down.
00:20:33.006 - 00:20:53.184, Speaker A: So very cool animated illustration. And these were kind of interesting. Again, I'm enjoying just the. This experimentation with abstraction here. So to familia favoritas. So this is rustic digital art. It looks like Lisa Simpson and Marge and Maggie and Homer.
00:20:53.184 - 00:21:28.522, Speaker A: So very interesting. And the color, so kind of a minimal abstraction. I kind of feel like there's something here, you know, Marge's hair. There's another one that he did, Pepe. And you see just, like, reduced to its elements. And then it looks like the layers on different layers, and maybe the layers removed, or the reference photo underneath, if there was one. Or maybe just screwing around with no reference photo, who knows? But, you know, like, I saw the first one and I was like, huh, not sure what to think.
00:21:28.522 - 00:21:48.276, Speaker A: Then I saw the second, and then I see consistency, and I see, okay, there's a process machine at work here, as we call them. There is a concept that's being explored. Let's take a look at this, because then it's like, okay, awesome. Santiago. A new kind of abstraction. So this was interesting. And he's always got interesting layering.
00:21:48.276 - 00:22:18.046, Speaker A: This seemed to be a slight departure, so I thought we could highlight this. A happy Thursday. So just interesting experimentation. It's just endless, you know, I don't think this was minted, you know, so that's cool. And a new work from Tuks. So this is on foundation, so also interesting. Now, tux mixes AI with abstraction, basically, and has a.
00:22:18.046 - 00:22:42.974, Speaker A: Sometimes we've seen Tewks work where it's sometimes super pixelated. The consistent theme seems to be this exploration of abstraction. It's called asterisk AI art assisted with mid journey and slightly post production in Photoshop. And this is going for 0.22 ETH, so continues to be interesting over there. This is a new artist. And this is for someone who lost their friend.
00:22:42.974 - 00:22:58.338, Speaker A: And I thought the art was quite interesting. This is a digital painter, Evelyn O. She's multi chain. She's on a few chains. So this is digital painting. So interesting kind of work here. And this was transferred to somebody.
00:22:58.338 - 00:23:15.726, Speaker A: So maybe a friend or something, who knows? Collector. This was another one by Evelyn O. And it kind of had Peter Doig vibes. So I brought up some Peter Doig for us. Digital painting 2022. Also dedicated to a friend. And so quite nice, isn't it? Quite nice.
00:23:15.726 - 00:23:31.314, Speaker A: And, yeah, also transferred. And so here's some Peter Doig. So some of you may not have heard of Peter Doeg. A lot of you probably have. Contemporary artist and quite influential. I have friends who just love Peter Doig. You can even see the influence.
00:23:31.314 - 00:23:45.564, Speaker A: You know, these big washes here and might be a little small. This is a famous one, this rainbow bridge. This might be. This is more the color. I remember it. Or maybe even this one. I guess there's different versions.
00:23:45.564 - 00:24:06.114, Speaker A: Yeah, see, Peter Doeg's DVP rainbow painting could go for millions. So this is a pretty famous Peter Doig. But he often does these kind of canoes in landscapes. Often palm trees. So anyways, there is Peter Doig for you. Interesting artist. Speaking of interesting artists, here's rat cloaksee giving his homage to Francis Bacon.
00:24:06.114 - 00:24:20.414, Speaker A: Pretty interesting. But again, completely his own. Does some stretching here of the mouth. Someone reading a book. And all sorts of madness going on here. And cigarette butts. Classic.
00:24:20.414 - 00:24:40.822, Speaker A: And the three legs and the interesting shadow green. So it's just full of stuff as we're used to here. Interesting square here behind the head. It's tempting to think of this as a self portrait. Nice splashes and everything. This one also really caught my eye, this guy. And it looks like there's a door opening here.
00:24:40.822 - 00:25:02.906, Speaker A: So it's almost like growing off of the Francis Bacon tropes. And this is also super interesting, just how this is treated with what looks like just brush strokes right over the head. This is super interesting as well. So anyways, nice colors too. So, Ratcloaksee. Yeah, and there were a ton of retweets on this. Yeah, we're 173 likes, 28 retweets.
00:25:02.906 - 00:25:23.192, Speaker A: Anyway, very cool. Board me social club. Happy ending. And that's all, folks. So the darkness continues with boardme social club in a very interesting way. It looks like he's introducing some pixel pixels edges into things here. So just kind of mysterious.
00:25:23.192 - 00:25:41.520, Speaker A: Pretty cool work. Available for only 850 edition of ten. He's got his collectors or she boardme social club. And. Yeah, so interesting. A crow has landed on my balcony. So if you're wondering why I'm distracted.
00:25:41.520 - 00:26:00.344, Speaker A: Anyways, interesting work. Here's another one that was released. This is only one Tezos edition of 100. Derivative of Ben Shan's the burial society for the rip hen event. So interesting. Just kind of mysterious digital painting here. These ghosts and everything.
00:26:00.344 - 00:26:41.682, Speaker A: Tezos chain. This is an interesting compositional element. Just putting this, you know, what looks like the flagpole or something, this black flagpole across the whole image, separating these guys from these guys. A lot going on here. It has very nice compositions. Boardme social club and continuing on, just thought I'd follow up with Minta's hater and so kind of like a die with the most likes, but in her own way, completely. I understand fanservice, but aren't you releasing more original pieces? So there's the hater with free time who's just trolling Minta, and Minta is trolling back.
00:26:41.682 - 00:27:07.094, Speaker A: And obviously, there is no way you could understand conceptual art without digging visual or beauty. Art is just easy. Yeah, there's no way you can go deep. Staying in the surface, connecting with conceptual art might take you a few minutes. Once you do, life is better. And, yeah, sometimes the originality is actually doing the screenshots and everything that goes along with that. Again, I am a huge screenshot guy.
00:27:07.094 - 00:27:40.774, Speaker A: I used to call myself a screenshot artist. Like, someone, some marketing guy I know who did campaigns I need to retouch with him, did campaigns with, like, BMW or whomever. He's like, in one sentence, what kind of artist are you? And at the time, that was like, four or five years ago was like, I do screenshots. I'm a screenshot artist. So anyways, enjoying this buy for 30 now hater, so edition of five. Not sure the hater can afford that one. King G dime store pepes offer no future, future rewards.
00:27:40.774 - 00:28:07.524, Speaker A: So just another interesting oil painting from our guy Trez Rodanx, and, yeah, just interesting, interesting, interesting. Kind of reminds me of the Hulk meets Pepe, a thin Hulk. So interesting use of. I didn't know you could do that in an MS paint, the oil paint style. And KHC has a couple of works here. This is purple rain. This is an edition of three.
00:28:07.524 - 00:28:32.292, Speaker A: He sent one to me for bidding on the one of one. Another auction I did not win. I don't win any auctions anymore. And brown rain, so these kind of go together. So purple rain and brown rain, and you never know what KHC is up to. It's always a surprise. And as I like to say, the hallmark of good art is unpredictability.
00:28:32.292 - 00:28:53.004, Speaker A: So brown rain, there's always good humor in it too. I have no idea what's going on over here. The mayhem continues in that genius Haiti Rockette portrait. And so, anyways, love these guys and love to follow them. Look at this AI art. I believe it's AI Maria house acid frame. Let's give them a follow.
00:28:53.004 - 00:29:27.094, Speaker A: And my first ever open edition is now available on my Manifold XYZ token claim page. Something also to set up for us all. Entrance epiphany is available to claim for zero one ETH for 48 hours. So this seems to be a trend as people were pointing out these open editions on Manifold XYZ. And this looks like AI art, as we can see here. I haven't actually seen aiia as a hashtag, but mid journey, so clearly, so very nice. Makes you tempted to think that this is midjourney four.
00:29:27.094 - 00:29:42.622, Speaker A: So clean. And it looks like a rendered, finished work of art. And look at strange thing doing a portrait of red rum. So that's pretty cool. And it's almost in the spirit of. What is it? Thug lord. Again, the iconic thug lord.
00:29:42.622 - 00:29:58.650, Speaker A: And beautifully put together here, however he does it. And a chanel bag. So a portrait of red rum. Let's just see. This went for 1100 tezos. How long did it take? Like five minutes. So look at that.
00:29:58.650 - 00:30:16.014, Speaker A: Congrats to strange thing. Whew. That's five minutes, 1100 tezos. He is killing it in the AI art department. AI surrealist. If you haven't seen those older episodes. We went deep into big discussion on strange thing.
00:30:16.014 - 00:30:38.302, Speaker A: This is pretty cool too. Apocalypse by a strange thing. I almost want to. I'm not going to let this load because sometimes this kills my mic. We'll look at it another time. Okay, who's that? So this is interesting, a new artist. And this is physical works on super rare.
00:30:38.302 - 00:30:58.098, Speaker A: A collage artist. And the name is Michelle Thompson. Mitch Tom. And so anyways, interesting collage work going on, on super rare. So this we'd put in. I think we'd put into the physical works as NFTs category. That's pretty cool.
00:30:58.098 - 00:31:22.980, Speaker A: So just very interesting collage artists. So good to see. And always trying to just add to our roster of artists that we're paying attention to. A collage artist forever covering up faces. There is something very poetic about covering up the face. I often do it in the screen memory series, and it just often, not always, I like to keep it kind of open in my head. So anyways, it just kind of.
00:31:22.980 - 00:31:43.884, Speaker A: It almost neutralizes an image to cover the face somewhat because that's how powerful face is. Right. This was sent to me and I just thought it was kind of cool. I'd never heard of this artist, polo Mulocchi. And this is a physical artist piece as an NFT. And I just thought it was an interesting subject matter. This looks like carpets that are put on top of each other.
00:31:43.884 - 00:31:56.672, Speaker A: So do not fear. You are with the vanguard. Viva la vanguard. So I assume that's the vanguard group that is on tezos. So just kind of interesting edition of 41 is this. Oh, and it's just sold. Okay.
00:31:56.672 - 00:32:21.074, Speaker A: It was just sent to everybody, so you probably got that too. And this is threesomes, who we haven't profiled too much on the show, but here and there and here, these are hilarious. It's like, what do you call them? Low effort flags commemorative. So there's always humor in threesomes. I'm still kind of discovering what threesomes is all about. Yeah. But anyways, this is a pretty cool piece.
00:32:21.074 - 00:32:37.984, Speaker A: Again, physical art is NFts. You put them all together, these low effort flags actually look pretty good. There's a consistency there. I think there's a lesson there. These are trading cards, of course, too. So there is subtlety in all of these things. So anyways, interesting.
00:32:37.984 - 00:32:58.514, Speaker A: Distributed to collectors. Originally airdropped to the 15 collectors who bought certain works. Digital capture of original painting. So again, physical works as nfts, and again, just sent out to collectors. And that, my friend, is your show. I hope you have a wonderful day. And until next time, take care.
