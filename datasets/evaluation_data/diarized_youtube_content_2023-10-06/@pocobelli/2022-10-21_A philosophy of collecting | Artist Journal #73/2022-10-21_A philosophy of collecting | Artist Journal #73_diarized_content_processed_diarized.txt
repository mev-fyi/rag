00:00:05.640 - 00:00:36.354, Speaker A: Your one of a kind tv show broadcasting across the Internet. Artist journal, October 21, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Maybe I should have been like a announcer at boxing matches or something. Come on. Or the price is right. Maybe I should apply for the prices, right? Come on down.
00:00:36.354 - 00:01:09.350, Speaker A: I love that guy, Rod. I think his name was the price is right. I love the beginning of that show. But lest I get distracted. So I think we've seen this work before, but a bit of homage to the collectors here today and the culture of collecting and a lot of us artists are collector. It's the, you could call it the rise of the artist collector on digital, particularly on Tezos, where it is cheap and storage is free. So here it is, a portrait by Minta.
00:01:09.350 - 00:01:28.714, Speaker A: Screenshot as portrait of Mikey de la creme. Collected, collected, collected. His classic line, which we have all seen. And if you haven't, maybe you should get on Twitter and you will give Mikey a follow. Excuse me. Still available up. I'm gonna have to work if I want to.
00:01:28.714 - 00:01:50.834, Speaker A: Have to practice a bit if I want to get on the prices right. Portrait of Mikey Wilson is still available for, for tazos. And can a portrait be more accurate? Mister Mikey by minta. Still some copies unsold. So yeah. So we're gonna talk a little bit about collectors who put out some very, very interesting threads. Just a quick shout out to Haiti.
00:01:50.834 - 00:02:10.970, Speaker A: Rocket Pokebelay is a rock star. Well, hearing that from a rock star like Haiti is pretty awesome. I was on the oo bon when I saw that, so that was pretty cool. And Pokebelly fan club sign up here. I love it. So thank you, guys. There's nothing like the artists giving you the shout outs like that and liking the show.
00:02:10.970 - 00:02:39.514, Speaker A: So super appreciated. Again, this is by an artist. Okay. I am an artist first and foremost, and this is my journal publicly shared. Martin Joe, SS also put out a really nice comment. I strongly recommend watching the artist journal by Adrian Pokebelly, not a news show. I just caught up with his already 72 episodes and that's why I wanted to highlight Martin Joe here discussing and documenting the NFT art scene.
00:02:39.514 - 00:03:06.086, Speaker A: So that's wild that Martin Joe has watched and caught up with everything. So thank you for the time. I'm trying to make this worth your while. I am very conscious of people's time here, so that is important for me. So thank you, Martin Joe. Shall we check in on Paris? Speaking of time, we can give a couple of minutes to Paris here. The public opening is now.
00:03:06.086 - 00:03:27.598, Speaker A: So we saw pictures yesterday of the private opening. Okay. Which is often. I mean, what is today? So, today's Friday, and maybe this came out last yesterday, because usually the public. Or, sorry, the private openings are on Wednesday, and they have the vip's, and the collectors will go around. And it's kind of when everything gets bought up oftentimes. And then the public comes in.
00:03:27.598 - 00:03:47.182, Speaker A: So that's part of the reason they do that. It's always nice to get the vip ticket, but not always easy to get, depending. Anyways, lest we get off track here. So just some photos. Apparently. This is by the Eiffel Tower. So I've never been to this structure.
00:03:47.182 - 00:04:02.808, Speaker A: Grand Palais eplimer. I can't read that. Epumer epimere. I'm not sure what it is. October 20, the 23rd. So, yeah, so here it is. And again, here's the booth.
00:04:02.808 - 00:05:00.500, Speaker A: It's looking pretty good today. They did a nice job. I mean, I guess it's FX hash, but where's dye with the most likes and his FX hash work? I guess he can't show everybody, but I wonder if they're showing his work, you know, like, when I see these art booths, and I sometimes wonder to myself, like, where's the Haiti rocket? Where's the, you know, Jnk? And maybe that's too underground for them, but, you know. Or Kurt Hussle collective, where is the Lewis Osborne? You know? So it always seems to be like this odd curation, which feels very trad arty, doesn't it? Feels very from the trad art scene, and who knows why? And maybe that's just. I haven't seen the right exhibitions, but that is just like a kind of passing thought. So here's the public opening. Looks like a nice, cool crowd here.
00:05:00.500 - 00:05:18.316, Speaker A: Pretty young. Remember the. We were for those. And Martin Joe will remember we were looking at. I was Berlin art Week, and I was pointing out a gallery how everybody looked over 40. I took a picture here. Almost everybody looks like, you know, maybe 45.
00:05:18.316 - 00:05:38.544, Speaker A: Most people here look under 40. Okay, I am 43, so I'm not judging either way, but I think it does say something. Okay. Anyway, fun, cool, hip crowd here. Here's another shot from the Tezos. Look at how many people are here. So, just a nice party.
00:05:38.544 - 00:06:09.686, Speaker A: Very cool. So here is a. A post. Now, hen collector, from what I could gather, is actually the biggest collector on Tezos. Okay. And hen collector wrote a medium article, which we should probably all go and read. I read part of it, and I thought it was actually really well written, despite his intro here, it's on medium the art of contrarian collecting a philosophy despite the intro, I'm not a writer.
00:06:09.686 - 00:06:53.462, Speaker A: Let's start with that. It's a very well written piece in my opinion. It's very smooth, a lot of love and care, and even you can tell by the punctuation and everything when you get, you know, commas actually reveal a ton. So anyways, here's his intro here. Ever write something because you just need to get it out there? That's this long and self indulgent addressed to you, but probably meant for me. Like, I mean, this person can write a need to appease my delusions and convince myself that what we are building has meaning. So a thoughtful person here, and I found this through rural idol who responding to this medium article.
00:06:53.462 - 00:07:29.552, Speaker A: This is an inspiring read. I found our culture quite depressing at times of late. Not only bear market, but celebrities, biggie big bags, all that jazz artists feeling. We need old school approval, TF, Moma, etcetera. I dream of creative I dream of creative autonomy for us all. Looking forward to number two, and I'm only going to take a couple of clips, and this is one of them that I want to take. Just a couple of little takeaways, but you should read the entire article yourself.
00:07:29.552 - 00:08:44.620, Speaker A: So this is a quote that rural idol quoted from that article. In the long run, it is also certainly possible that this technology may eliminate some of the administrative necessities that validates the existence of companies as we know them. If collectives of creators can form and use the blockchain to build ideas and systems around them without needing to go to the traditional music art industry to perform these functions, the power of traditional and centralized companies will hopefully lessen, and the power of the individual creator and associated communities may grow, in essence, a wealth transfer from companies to creators and communities. Highly idealistic, but one can always dream. I would argue this isn't so idealistic, because I think this is already happening. I think this is what are we doing? Like, we've created basically our own economy here. Our little ecosystem, as I call it, is an economy of sorts, is it not? And is there anybody mediating other than the platform object in the Tezos blockchain? Is there anybody really getting in between the creator and the collector? And a lot of us creators are collectors.
00:08:44.620 - 00:09:14.904, Speaker A: Almost all of us. Almost all, which is significant. It's like the advent of the artist, collector and artists have always collected, but here I would argue it's happening on a whole new scale because of its cost, which maybe I've mentioned this earlier because of its cost and no need for storage. So this isn't like a traditional artist who. Okay, maybe I want your work then. I do. I have an extra $50 or $100 to buy my friend's artwork.
00:09:14.904 - 00:09:43.490, Speaker A: And where on earth am I going to store that? Both of those problems are solved on tezos, where you can buy a work for fifty cents and it's stored in the ether. So I would argue this has already begun. So it's just a matter of how far is it going to go. Okay, so here is the essay and I just wanted to highlight a couple of things here. Why? So it's very philosophical. Look at the first question. Why I collect.
00:09:43.490 - 00:10:08.038, Speaker A: Okay, very philosophical. And we're going to come back to this part right here. What makes a good collection? Of course, according to Hen collector. But I wanted to just point out a couple of things that you're going to find in this article. He is the biggest collector, or hen collector is the biggest collector on Tezos. And yeah, I don't know. Man, woman, doesn't matter to me.
00:10:08.038 - 00:10:25.514, Speaker A: Hen collector is the biggest collector on Tezos. Yep, that's me about Dernadler, who is a. I think Dern Adler's picked up a couple of my works. So I didn't realize he was such a huge collector. So. And I've never even really heard of hen collector. But you'll see some familiar names here.
00:10:25.514 - 00:10:45.538, Speaker A: Nft biker, clownvamp, of course. Chris Wallace, Gan brood. So anyways, just kind of interesting there my collecting philosophy. And look at how like thoughtful this is. Review macro thesis often. Build a collecting theme. Stick to it, collect in a musical way.
00:10:45.538 - 00:11:08.150, Speaker A: It's all about the mix. Create a balanced and diversified portfolio. Find diamonds in the rough. Invest in geography, battle bias, events equal no rules. When to buy always where to buy everywhere on tezos. Enjoy the honeymoon period, a battle is coming. Enjoy the honeymoon period, a battle is coming.
00:11:08.150 - 00:11:38.996, Speaker A: I did not see this. I haven't read the whole thing. And so then he goes into detail on every one of these things. Review macro thesis often. So then he goes through each of those points and writes about it. Fascinating to me, this looks like a primary document, as you'd say, if you're going back in history and you're looking for important elemental works that spoke to a certain time in history. For someone that claims to not be a good writer, this is very well put together.
00:11:38.996 - 00:12:34.634, Speaker A: Like it's like a philosophical treatise on collecting on tazos. So find that. And it looks like some wise advice here too. So just the final thing I wanted to touch on, on this essay. Was this part at the start? What makes a good collection? According to the biggest collector on Dezos, who happens to be a very thoughtful, good writer, a you can feel the purpose of the person behind it. B you can watch as they methodically move through themes and styles that fit the story they are trying to tell, c you can hear the questions they are asking themselves as they collect, d they aren't afraid to collect across diverse sets of creators and a diverse set of genres to give them different perspectives and approaches. And e they are always striving to tell a good story.
00:12:34.634 - 00:13:12.182, Speaker A: I mean, my version of telling a good story is I'm kind of always imagining these rooms in my mind and go, you know, oh, that might work well in the entrance of the museum, so to speak, this museum in my mind. Or that might pair really well with this other work on a wall beside it. That's totally how I see, you know. So anyways, fascinating thing, work here. Day one, the art of contrarian collecting, a philosophy. So finally here, hen collector, this is how many works he has. 447.
00:13:12.182 - 00:13:39.030, Speaker A: Should I bring up my calculator? Times 24? Let's just see what that is. How many works does he have? 447. Times 24. 10,728. Now, don't forget, Martin, Joe might remember this. Berlin's Neue national Galerie, the new National Gallery, as it's called in Berlin here. And I think it's like the German National Gallery, but they have like 1800 works.
00:13:39.030 - 00:13:58.048, Speaker A: And so hen collector has five acts. You know, I actually feel like it should be more than that. 447 times 24. No, it's 10,000, but it's still. I mean, think about that. 10,728 works. And finally, on the collector front here, actually, we have a couple of more things.
00:13:58.048 - 00:14:31.344, Speaker A: Gigachad, Pepe, Rob V two retweeted this. So I found it, the journey and the. I'm not going to go too deep into it, but I did want to touch on a couple of things. The journey of the artist and the collector is more similar than the dynamics of NFT Twitter would have you believe. And so we'll just read a couple of these paragraphs here. Over the last few months, I've seen many successful artists mention internal struggles. They face the pressure to outperform their last mint, the estrangement from the NFT unaware world, the imposter syndrome that plagues their deserved peace as they achieve runaway success.
00:14:31.344 - 00:15:15.824, Speaker A: And on the flip side, many more artists feel as if they're shouting into a void where whether they shill or not engage, retweet, DMGM, post or otherwise. The struggle to be seen and the long waits between sales reflects internally on even the most self assured creators. And, yeah, when you're starting on Twitter or when nobody knows who you are. Before I did these videos, I mean, basically I was just that guy that bought work every once in a while and people would give me a shout out. I mean, so that's kind of interesting, too. And so this has helped my Twitter a lot. So anyways, he's kind of, you know, comparing the artist and the collector mindset and actually showing a lot of similarities.
00:15:15.824 - 00:15:50.420, Speaker A: So, anyways, I'm not going to go into this whole thing, but it was just kind of an interesting. More thoughts on the collector, shall we say, and how they're actually maybe not that different from the artist. A couple of more ideas on the collector front. So here's Mech TXT, one of our favorite pixel artists here, Michael Macasso. And he's just showing off in a positive sense. He's just, look at all these great works I'm collecting here. And so let's just, you know, so people are having fun here.
00:15:50.420 - 00:16:01.306, Speaker A: And look at. Look at that. The zero, zero four there. That looks awesome. We see Daniel W. You know, so. And there's that great work by the paper crane.
00:16:01.306 - 00:16:25.590, Speaker A: So some familiar works there, but just, you know, again, the rise of the artist collector. And this existed before, but of course, it's cheaper and storage is not a problem on the digital blockchain. So that is wonderful. Drank Frazetta, purple. Purple drank. This week I collected works from some incredible artists. And thank you for some gifts.
00:16:25.590 - 00:16:48.014, Speaker A: Friends bear markets, revealing some creators to watch in the near future. So there's that Lavon piece. He got one of one. And nice homage to purple drank. And of course, Xander Price. And, you know, all sorts of familiar faces here. So anyways, just makes you bullish on the whole culture.
00:16:48.014 - 00:17:05.486, Speaker A: Continuing on. And purple drank. I've missed a few of these savage sorta pepes. So I think I stopped off at five. Now we're on ten. So check this out. I loaded it up and there's only 50 available, by the way.
00:17:05.486 - 00:17:26.314, Speaker A: There's 24 left. They're very cheap at, I think, 0.004. So I think that's about $5. And then check this out. So, I mean, people are having fun here. Purple drank is saying, look at my collection. Then he's putting the music.
00:17:26.314 - 00:18:18.936, Speaker A: This is awesome. Like, so I hope this is translating at those booths at art Basel there, because it would be funny to see, you know, someone like myself or someone else start curating this stuff, or purple drank or Michael Macasso or the hen collector starting to put stuff together and then say, this is, you know, this is Tezos blockchain, although this is on ethereum. So these are nfts. So, you know, we're cross chain here and we are multimedia, as we all know. Continuing on NSFW, there's a little bit of auction. I don't want to call it a bidding war, but a little bit of one sold for a nice, healthy 8.814 ETH for rat cloak.
00:18:18.936 - 00:18:40.934, Speaker A: See's work here. So this really kind of mysterious work. And you saw there is a bid for 0.5 and then there's basically two wallets here that are battling over it. And so Nsfworld ETH walks away with it for 0.814 ETH. So nice purchase.
00:18:40.934 - 00:19:19.424, Speaker A: Now, we were talking and I titled yesterday's video semi awkwardly, is our low reserves with auctions basically the model. Right? And now here's a person I've never heard of Lord before, but Lord seems to have a lot of collectors on super rare. What I want to point out was someone made an offer for 75. Lord put a reserve of 0.1. Okay. And look at what happened within seconds. 1.4.
00:19:19.424 - 00:19:51.110, Speaker A: So obviously they have their collector base. 1.882 minutes later, it's at 2.69. And here we are with 10 hours left, and it's at 5.445 for doors of perception here. So all to say, like, maybe it's again, like, instead of waiting for offers, is that enough? Maybe it's just again, like, to me, this is more evidence of a low reserve. Just put it to auction and then just.
00:19:51.110 - 00:20:10.874, Speaker A: And then it just goes for the market price and then, yeah, maybe you have to get out there and chill it on social media a little bit. That's all to your benefit. Nothing wrong with that. It's part of the business. Now, Runetune came in and actually responded to this. Yeah. Are art auctions with low reserves? The model, and it sure looked like it there.
00:20:10.874 - 00:20:47.294, Speaker A: But runetune, as always, brought in a very interesting point. And his answer, or Runetun's answer, I'm not sure, guy or girl? So let's just call. Runetoon's answer was, depends who you are. If you should are auctions of one of one's, the model depends who you are. For small fish like myself, a one of one doesn't serve of my mission, which is to be better known and recognized for my work in as many wallets as possible. For established, recognized artists, a one of one is likely the best way to go. Another excellent point from Runetune.
00:20:47.294 - 00:21:11.984, Speaker A: And honestly, I'm not even sure, like, let's take a quick look at Runetune on object. Give him or her a follow. And so, yeah, so some photography here. So here's some of Rune tune's work has some one of ones, and you can get a one of one for a dollar. So, yeah, now is your chance to get in on rune tune. The archives of rune tune sharing. So a photographer.
00:21:11.984 - 00:21:41.584, Speaker A: So I think an excellent point, though. You know, if you're new, I mean, that's how you start off on Tezos. That's what's so beautiful about Tezos is you basically, when you start, nobody knows who you are, you're new to the community. Basically zero public awareness. So you really have to make things cheap. Like, I learned that the hard way. I started with, I put some stuff up for ten tezos in December.
00:21:41.584 - 00:22:18.110, Speaker A: It did eventually sell, but it took like months, right? And then I started to lower the price, and then it's like, okay, I'll put some stuff out for cheaper. Check your ego at the door. And that's just how you do it on Tazos. It's not like Ethereum, and maybe you do that on Ethereum too, but as far as Tezos. So I think there is wisdom in the method here of Runetune. You know, you put out a nice work and then you get it spread out. So anyways, give Runertune a follow on object and on Twitter, a regular contributor to this program.
00:22:18.110 - 00:22:36.114, Speaker A: And again, some of our best programs have come from Runetune. And is there more? Yeah, look at this. Is this also by runetune? Give runetune. Yeah. So sweet heat. So very cool collection. There you go.
00:22:36.114 - 00:22:55.300, Speaker A: So owned by Joe Rogan's dad. Okay, so unfortunately, this isn't loading up right now. But you can see the collection here on OpenSea. So it has ETH work too, I guess, the photography. So anyways, shout out to Runetune. Good point, as usual. Tradscape.
00:22:55.300 - 00:23:15.476, Speaker A: Remember tradscape yesterday saying, like, hey, guys, I can't keep doing this if nobody's going to buy my work. I can't dedicate all this time. We have an update. Nicholas Oido is sold out. I'm incredibly grateful right now. I complained about sales and y'all showed up in force. I have zero intention of turning complaining into a sales tactic.
00:23:15.476 - 00:23:50.184, Speaker A: No one should. But I'm humbled to have y'all hear me and appreciate the art. And it is an awesome piece, and we want to see more of them, right. For those that missed it, this octopus surgeon, I mean, and the music, like tradscape, he makes the music for this program, by the way. He made the NFT that I started this program with every morning. And I kind of categorize him as one of those artists where if he didn't make it, nobody would have made it. Like kind of like Bjork, you know, it's like, if Bjork didn't write that song, nobody would have written that song.
00:23:50.184 - 00:24:19.154, Speaker A: So that's always a good sign, actually. So anyways, congrats to tradscape continuing on. So this is by Pixel Nachos, also known as the side hustle, who did all those cubes. So here's a work on foundation, and it did quite well. It sold to the unknown collector for 0.3, a one of one. And we see a lot of the style of the cubes, right? Like the windows and the cubes.
00:24:19.154 - 00:24:45.236, Speaker A: And so a cityscape. So it's very fun to see how different chains, like, will bring out different work. Like, sometimes I would argue, like, as you get older, you start becoming much more adaptive. And some of the work I've made on tazos, I wouldn't have made if not for the Tezos chain. And just that culture. And it's like, oh, let's make work, you know, for the culture to a certain degree, in celebration. And that works.
00:24:45.236 - 00:25:15.574, Speaker A: And not just do my own thing that maybe has nothing to do with anyone that nobody's interested in. It's a fun way to work sometimes. And I don't work exclusively that way, but it's a fun way to work. So anyways, really nice work. Congratulations to side hustle, aka Pixel nachos, and also Yuri J. So after the super rare launch continues to make nice sales, and we looked at this work in a previous episode. I am so happy for interest in my raw series.
00:25:15.574 - 00:25:58.574, Speaker A: So this is good. And this was retweeted by Sabato. And look at how old this is. This is from the estate of Lee Mullikin, ALMT 100 a enigma October 9, 1987. 193 KB, which probably a large file back then. Now, the reason I brought this up is because this reminded me of, remember we were looking at sampled brushes, and I brought up that artist again, Otto Ford. Now, this is like a contemporary artist who puts it on, who makes these works and then prints them out on canvas, and they look quite striking.
00:25:58.574 - 00:26:23.818, Speaker A: But you can see they are sampled brushes. Brushes of samples that they drag. Right. A really, really fun, cool technique. Very powerful. This looks like an early version of that, doesn't it? It looks like just a 1987 iteration of basically that theme. It seems to be a sample that's being dragged around different samples.
00:26:23.818 - 00:26:46.394, Speaker A: So just wanted to highlight that. And then if you go to Lee Mullikin's opensea computer, Joy, you can see all different kinds of works here. So, pretty interesting. None are available, so, again, and these sold for one ETH each. 1.25, maybe back in. Let's look at the activity quickly here.
00:26:46.394 - 00:26:59.934, Speaker A: 1.254 months ago. So it's like it sold out and everybody's just holding onto them. One ETH. So this did really well. 35 ETH back then. That's like 100 grand.
00:26:59.934 - 00:27:25.684, Speaker A: Okay, continuing on, popple shows us his method here. Let's see if this loads up. So we're looking at his work. Here we go. And I always like the works in progress here, so just a little time lapse. Right. Of the latest work, what was that called? Observatory.
00:27:25.684 - 00:27:47.724, Speaker A: So I believe that's still available. And where he mixes generative art and pixel art. So it's always interesting just to see. Look at that from the sketch. That's what I really like about popple's work, is he builds it from scratch. Like, I'm someone that always is appropriate, always using references that I build off of. It's fun to.
00:27:47.724 - 00:28:09.398, Speaker A: I should try making something from scratch. Continuing on. Nanslate, a pixel artist I've never seen before and I thought was interesting or not for a while, actually in, like, the tomatoes, the egg. Almost a reference to Dali here with the fried egg falling over there. So very nice. Pixel artist, Nan slate. I think I brought up their works.
00:28:09.398 - 00:28:24.952, Speaker A: I did. I'm a tattoo artist who's in love with pixel art. And so a lot of classic stuff here. So stuff for off the beaten path. And actually, I have bought this before. I think I loaded this up. This is a really nice Christmas work.
00:28:24.952 - 00:28:49.040, Speaker A: I think it's Christmas. Yeah, it's Christmas. See some, like, balls of bows of holly or whatever. Mistletoe, Christmas lights. So pretty funny. Is that a Christmas tree? I don't know. So, anyways, if you're looking to improve your Christmas collection, there's a nice work there.
00:28:49.040 - 00:29:21.674, Speaker A: So, anyways, the artist is nan slate, another pixel artist, p. One who I'd never seen before. Lollipop moment kind of thematically reminds me of adelia, but in terms of technique, it's clear pixel art with its own flavor. So I think I brought up some p one. So you can see here, this looks really nice. HBD blueberry cheesecake. This here almost reminds me of burr sector.
00:29:21.674 - 00:29:50.978, Speaker A: I love sushi. Pretty reasonably priced stuff. Almost Game Boy colors here. So anyways, a couple of interesting pixel artists, p one and just mech TXT. I love how he's practicing a ton. This is another thing I really like, which I'd like to do, maybe, which is the being prolific and posting works that you don't necessarily mint we see die with the most likes. Does that right? Sometimes.
00:29:50.978 - 00:30:26.378, Speaker A: Once in a while, I think I've seen Haiti post, like alternate mixes and this sort of thing. It's a very fun way to just kind of keep yourself out there and keep people entertained and interested in you as an artist. And it shows that you kind of have a real depth because look at how much work you're putting out. I haven't seen this as a mint. There's a ton of work color studies that he's put out or that Michael Macasso has put out that I haven't seen. Anyways, continuing on, a beautiful new work by Ed Morolla. And so here is the vulture.
00:30:26.378 - 00:30:50.566, Speaker A: And this looks like almost a reference to a mythological scene. Who is it? Not Sisyphus, but the guy. Prometheus, maybe, but not really because these look like skulls, and that is not in the mythical. But interestingly, a vulture eating a man's liver, maybe. So maybe half reference to Prometheus. Beautiful work. One of one for 20 tezos.
00:30:50.566 - 00:31:19.948, Speaker A: So talking like $26 these days. Okay, new work by Kappan, the sacred citadel. And this looks like it's going in a bit of a Sci-Fi direction here. So the first one seemed like almost a biblical reference. The walking on the face of the waters or whatever it was. And now this feels a bit more Sci-Fi just for your information. Yeah, like, these are just a really wonderful pixel artist.
00:31:19.948 - 00:31:49.840, Speaker A: I don't know if I've seen that one. The one I was first contact, the earth was formless and void. So. Yeah, so the biblical reference here, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, depending on your translation there. Lorna mills with a one of one grand Maleficio. And so interesting. Kurt Hussle collective with three fried weenies, cold weenie, fried weenie, and spicy weenie.
00:31:49.840 - 00:32:14.402, Speaker A: So not sure what's going on here. Raging corn weenies, but always a surprise with the Kurt hussle collective. So these are available in all three colors here. So hilarious as ever. And you can see like the VHS glitch. So this is a mini series, pretty nicely priced at one tezos 50 each. So we're talking $2 each.
00:32:14.402 - 00:32:34.674, Speaker A: Very reasonable. Now, remember this Godzilla not Godzilla thing by Xerox. NFT. So mental noise, whose work we haven't really touched too much. Well, here is a work by mental noise. Very nice. Almost has that John window thing going on with the grid.
00:32:34.674 - 00:32:50.390, Speaker A: Is it called Goonzilla? Goonzilla. So very nice work with like toy Godzilla. Really like this. And let's just look. It's not Godzilla. It's a child's play gang. And see if mental noise.
00:32:50.390 - 00:33:12.378, Speaker A: See, I think there's a bezaya that celebrates mental noise. So he's been around. Or she kind of looks like a dude from the looks of it, but you never know. And so mental noise. Anyway, interesting artist. Give mental noise a follow. This is also interesting.
00:33:12.378 - 00:33:35.264, Speaker A: We looked at Turkarek's work earlier and it reminds you of Ezra Eslin. Or this was just kind of, you know, some creep on the bus ticket fare. Extension tension in minibus. One of one for 34. Pretty interesting work. So pretty risque. You remember from the top secret meeting of businessmen who wear pink shoes.
00:33:35.264 - 00:33:59.398, Speaker A: So same artists and so anyways, just interesting and passing. Continuing on, a new monster from Daniel W. Buy for two tezos 30. This is the boyatate in Brazil. The boy atate is said to be a huge flaming snake that dwells in the forest. Protecting it against those that try to do it harm. So very interesting.
00:33:59.398 - 00:34:14.150, Speaker A: A lot of eyes there. So you can read all about that. Still available. I think they are selling. And a new work by Dan control. A chainsaw. So very nice work after the surveillance camera.
00:34:14.150 - 00:34:27.006, Speaker A: Very prolific. I think he put out chain as well. Yeah, you can see the chain here. Surveillance camera was a huge hit. I think the chainsaw looks great too. People are probably just running out of tazos, that's all. That's what happened to me.
00:34:27.006 - 00:34:48.538, Speaker A: Otherwise I would have picked one up. This was interesting. I think I saw Mikey Wilson referenced somewhere in a tweet in regard to this. Just kind of an odd work. That orange square in the top right. Complementary color to the blue. Almost reminds me of Battlestar Galactica or something.
00:34:48.538 - 00:35:09.258, Speaker A: So what is this detachment number 13 from other faces? Mf doom. He's that hip hop guy. We'll see if this loads up here. Let's continue on and then maybe circle back or let's just do a quick look. Yeah. Okay, here we go. So kind of a weird almost transformer battlestar Galactica thing.
00:35:09.258 - 00:35:31.960, Speaker A: I like the animation on that guy, though. So detachment number 13, what it means to be human. Almost has a bochoni. Remember, forms in space, almost has a bochoni look to it. Or a futurist look to it. Interestingly, italian futurist, endless vibes by tu x. An interesting 100% digital painting.
00:35:31.960 - 00:35:49.686, Speaker A: I love how they put that there because that is very helpful because you actually can't tell. So just an interesting work that is a one of one. How much did it go for? 150. Pretty respectable to take you on. Continuing on, Santiago. A very nice one of one. Available for 150.
00:35:49.686 - 00:36:15.532, Speaker A: Pack the distance you can think of. I'm in a smaller than a functional bomb space and wait for the cold night and cool down. So very interesting to watch Santiago's work, particularly the physical and the digital difference. Padrino put out a work and he's getting his work out there for 19. So that is, again, a good strategy. I think he sent me one. So thank you, Padrino.
00:36:15.532 - 00:36:34.078, Speaker A: And again, Padrino, follow his twitter. He's got some great tweets of tezos works on there. So anyways, just nice work. Zen hole. Glimpses of Zen can be found when you stick your nose where it doesn't belong. So practically free. So give Padrino some support there.
00:36:34.078 - 00:37:07.574, Speaker A: Martin Bruck. This was just a weird artist that I'd never seen before, and I thought it was just like, does this play? Yeah, it kind of moves a bit. Maybe you can or can't see it. Just the sheer originality of this style and kind of, again, it's so unapologetically doing its thing. I've just never seen a style like it before, so I thought I could highlight it. Here are just some other examples. Just a very original looking artist with 35 collectors, so doing well and is on super rare, too.
00:37:07.574 - 00:37:30.918, Speaker A: Continuing on, clownvamp. So we're into AI here as we wrap up one of the most original pieces of AI assisted art I've ever fear of rejection. A 101 by Din Burns collected via offer for 400 tezos. So clownvamp continues to be a patron. I assume it was clownvamp that bought it. Yeah, interesting work. And it's.
00:37:30.918 - 00:37:56.586, Speaker A: It is clearly AI from the curves and what I'd call the AI, distortions in the curves, but interesting. So just always pay attention to clown vamp. Javier Tomeo, the first snow, it's kind of a surreal landscape. Again, a dark sky with a rainbow with snow. Again, Javier Tomeo, fire in the sky. This has like a Japanese. You can see the direct reference here.
00:37:56.586 - 00:38:22.624, Speaker A: And it looks like a japanese print, and I think we even brought one up. Mech txt who is across this episode, Michael Macasso posted this. Masterpieces of Japan. Iris Garden at Meiji shrine, Tokyo by Kawase Hasui, 1951. So that's 20th century. And, you know, even just the japanese writing there, japanese writing on the side. So not a super direct reference.
00:38:22.624 - 00:38:41.644, Speaker A: But you do see the influence here. This has japanese print written all over it. Continuing on Venta. Thank you, Evelyn O, for being the latest collector of this piece. And to everyone who has collected it, only two editions left. So again, very interesting work by Venta. AI clearly must be.
00:38:41.644 - 00:39:15.196, Speaker A: And another one, an original composition reimagined by the machine. So that is interesting too. And for reference, you can go here. So Ventus started with this and went, and it turns into this. So that's kind of interesting. So another novel use of AI. And you see, almost like that sampled brush again idea, you can't see it, maybe it's not big enough for you, but you should be able to see that there's a sampled brush and that's kind of ironed out a little bit by the AI.
00:39:15.196 - 00:39:31.644, Speaker A: So just kind of an interesting use of AI. Nevklav. This is also AI and kind of surrealistic. I've never seen this before. Just sort of crossed it on Twitter, kind of left an impression. And finally, Varya, good night. And so Varya experimenting with different styles.
00:39:31.644 - 00:39:44.028, Speaker A: And this looks like it's AI as well. And finally, just some physical works. W O C or walk. I thought this was great. Betty Flintstone. Very nice work here. In my opinion.
00:39:44.028 - 00:40:06.774, Speaker A: It's available on object. So I believe that's a physical work. This looks like a physical work by Quila Nina. And just like another, you know, just like an endless supply of interesting work from Quila Nina. Beautiful. And finally, another physical work by Gabby Waltar, acrylic on canvas. Sold.
00:40:06.774 - 00:40:11.954, Speaker A: And that, ladies and gentlemen, is our show. Thank you for watching. Until next time, take care.
