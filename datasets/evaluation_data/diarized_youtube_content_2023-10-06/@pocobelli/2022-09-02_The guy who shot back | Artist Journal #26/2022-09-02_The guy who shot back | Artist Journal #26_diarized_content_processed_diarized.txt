00:00:07.520 - 00:00:49.902, Speaker A: Good morning, Artist Journal, September 2, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and I am back. The madness continues. And I appreciate that you're back. If you're watching this, what, a two and a half weeks it's been. You know, again, I've had this idea in my head for over a year that basically you just need to create a kind of public artist journal of sorts. The name, it could be even two or three years, actually, like I think I have.
00:00:49.902 - 00:01:28.694, Speaker A: And please don't watch them. Please don't watch whatever's out there. Although I do have a good interview with a friend. I mean, that could be from two years ago. So this artist journal idea is quite old, but I kind of feel like all the excitement on Tezos. Tezos kind of gives me my a little bit of a ground because it gives me content to talk about, and I'm so excited about it, and there's kind of nothing on it. You know, I want to interview friends, even that friend who I interviewed, Brian Kotz a couple of years ago, or whenever that was.
00:01:28.694 - 00:02:15.814, Speaker A: I was actually talking to him like three weeks ago, and I was like, oh, yeah, we should do another one of those. So we probably will. So there's going to be some kind of different kinds of content here and there. I mean, some of you, I was going to talk about this at the end, and we'll get back to die with the most likes in a second here. But since we're talking about it, some of you may have seen this in the studio, portrait of a woman and this whole thing I was streaming, and I thought, you know, the basic concept here is imagine. You know, you like Salvador Dali and you could watch him paint, you know, and in the Internet age, I mean, YouTube guys gives us just endless server space, as far as I understand. Like, I actually did that concept with.
00:02:15.814 - 00:02:52.262, Speaker A: I'll show you quickly. Again, I don't want to be self indulgent here, but it's kind of interesting. I did it earlier with a related images work on Twitch, an early version of this. Let me see if we can find an original here. Here we go. Yeah, so I actually, this was one of the first. I actually was the first, I think I did in this style of this kind of screen memories, like, of this kind of mixing of, you know, big sort of circles like these, you know, crisp shapes with fills and whatnot.
00:02:52.262 - 00:03:19.762, Speaker A: And that whole style. I actually did live on Twitch, and I was like, oh, this is so great that I recorded it. And twitch deletes your videos after 30 days and I never knew that, so that's gone. But I always was just like, oh, I'm so happy. Like, that huge breakthrough I had was on video, and let me tell you, nobody was watching, like, zero. And so that's okay with me. Like, it's just fun.
00:03:19.762 - 00:04:02.030, Speaker A: Because what if, you know, the question I ask myself first, I like having a record. Why not? Maybe I do blow up at some point, as we all kind of hope as artists, right? Maybe that happens. And then what happens if you have that archive? Like, that's an archive, and get this. Like, what if Salvador Dali, to just use an example, or Rauschenberg or whomever, you know, one of your heroes or some artist you like. What if all of a sudden, that guy started going? Or woman, whoever the case may be, Frida Kahlo. That would be awesome. What if she started going live and you.
00:04:02.030 - 00:04:35.468, Speaker A: Because you lived at the same time she did, and all of a sudden, you could watch her paint when she goes live. So I just kind of love that concept. And so just as I sort of have been having this concept in my mind for this show for, frankly, years, I'm kind of, like, going, okay, let's just start doing it. I mean, that's the hardest part. As we all know, as artists or collectors or people in this world, starting is probably more than half the job. That is the hardest part. Again, I've been doing this for two and a half weeks daily.
00:04:35.468 - 00:04:56.784, Speaker A: I probably could have been doing this for two years. Who knows where this channel would be? It's fun to think about. So, anyways, I don't want to go too on and on about that. But, yeah, if you see a live stream, that's kind of what's going on there. And I usually play. You know, I used to be a Goa DJ. Some of you might be surprised to learn a psychedelic trance DJ 20 years ago.
00:04:56.784 - 00:05:25.864, Speaker A: And so I often. I kind of went. I went to a Goa party in Portugal after I graduated from school in 2004, and I went to a seven day Goa party. And then I went to another one, the boom festival, what I call Europe's burning man. And then I went to another one that was like, four or five days. And I kind of felt like after that, I never needed to listen to Goa again or psychedelic trance. But about four years ago, I sort of returned, and I was like, oh, this has come a long way.
00:05:25.864 - 00:06:04.088, Speaker A: It's actually developed quite a bit. I think it kind of needed. I needed a break, and the music needed to go somewhere a little bit. And it kind of did, inevitably in that scene, if you ask me. And so I put that on because I like to work with that because it kind of keeps the energy high. Final note, just on the streaming, another interesting kind of psychological aspect of it is it's like going to a gym class, which I also go to, because when you go to a gym class, we have great stuff in Berlin here. You know, I pay â‚¬15 a month, and I go as many classes as I want.
00:06:04.088 - 00:06:42.164, Speaker A: I mean, that's probably 20. It's $15, guys. Now, I think if you start, it's like 25 or something, but I'm kind of grandfathered in because I started three or four years ago, actually. Four years ago, I think. So, anyway, it's kind of like a gym class where I work ten times harder when there's 20 other people around, because I don't want to let people down or I want to keep my pride and not be like the guy that's kind of like giving up before everybody. And it's kind of the same way with streaming. And if I was to, like, I don't even barely exercise on my own.
00:06:42.164 - 00:06:59.694, Speaker A: That's why these classes were revelation. I do work on my own. That I do. But I'm just saying, if I have streaming up, I'm, like, working more intensely, there's a little bit more pressure. And I do like that as well. So you may see live streams here and there. Watch if you like.
00:06:59.694 - 00:07:19.594, Speaker A: Don't watch if you like. It's just there. I'm just doing my thing. Okay, so enough of me. Let's look at die with the most likes. Another what I'm tempted to call genius, but brilliant, brilliant artist in the space. Like, brilliant, brutal satire.
00:07:19.594 - 00:07:48.700, Speaker A: To me, it's kind of a William Burroughs style satire. Dying at Circuit City. I bought this yesterday. I'm kind of going on my last hurrah in my own mind of kind of getting kind of precious works for this museum in my mind. I spent a lot of money on this 400 tezos, but we'll look at his work on super rare, trying to keep this episode short. It's not working, but look at the writing. I mean, which is another good sign.
00:07:48.700 - 00:08:26.456, Speaker A: Dying at Circuit City. Die collecting objects at the circuit city in your hometown on a shit covered test top die the way we all dreamed to die let the free wifi lift your soul to salvation let the soiled carpet be your grave. And then we have the guy, the old guy at Circuit City with. And you got hen there. I think this was made back, you know, more in the hen day. I mean, people still use that platform, but, you know, and circuit city. And to me, this was just the classic die with the most likes, and it was actually reasonably cheap.
00:08:26.456 - 00:09:07.334, Speaker A: When you look at his market, you see, I mean, the eye is leaking out here. To me, this was one of his classics, so I could justify it to myself where, you know, and I'll show you the market and then you'll go, oh, okay. Like, I can probably get my money back, let's put it that way. If I really had to, I might need to sit on it. There's probably gonna be some collectors that are gonna be unhappy today when they take a look, or in the next few days when they take a look at his collection and see that one's been taken, because that was a nice little prize he did. The celebrity. Big effing shitty celebrity.
00:09:07.334 - 00:09:48.164, Speaker A: What is it, cash grab? You know? So he's like hardcore satire. Again, in the spirit of what I would say, william Burroughs. William Burroughs, if you've never heard, is kind of a very important writer in the counterculture, arguably. I call him the guy that fired back, very mixed legacy, killed his wife playing William tell. Questionable kind of relationships with younger people. Like, I mean, we're talking very. I don't think he could become famous today, but he became famous in the fifties with the publication in 1959 of Naked Lunch.
00:09:48.164 - 00:10:04.234, Speaker A: And he is kind of like a very important figure. Regardless, I think it's a very mixed legacy. Like, I bring that up. I don't know if you guys know Vale from research publications. We're going in the weeds very quickly here. But I saw him talk. He's a friend of mine, actually.
00:10:04.234 - 00:10:34.874, Speaker A: He's in San Francisco, kind of a hero of the counterculture himself. I met him because I did my master's thesis on Ballard, which we will get to JG Ballard and the atrocity exhibition. And so Vail knew Ballard and Burroughs, actually. He had met them and interviewed them and published works. And when Vail talks, sometimes I bring up how, like, this mixed legacy. Like, it's kind of hard to look past it sometimes. And so, all to say, though, some of the writing is very important.
00:10:34.874 - 00:11:22.444, Speaker A: And as I said, a little bit of a lecture here, another history lecture here. But he was kind of like, you know, old bulldog. He was described as an on the road by Jack Kerouac. And he was kind of like the, artistically speaking, the hero, I put in quotes, of the counterculture movement of the beatniks, and which, of course, Alan Ginsburg and Jack Kerouac were a part of. And as a result of all this. This is my point, wrapping up here. The beatniks led to the hippies, okay? And you could argue that Burroughs was kind of the.
00:11:22.444 - 00:11:59.168, Speaker A: He kind of. He was kind of, for lack of better word, the mentor of Kerouac and Ginsburg, okay? And they all kind of blew up. And then the hippies happened, and then you get the punk scene and the whole counterculture as we know it. You can kind of trace back to William Burroughs, which is why I kind of call him the guy that shot back. And there is, of course, a counterculture before Burroughs, but there is kind of like what I'd call, like just like a new beginning of sorts. And we're gonna go into all that, the cut up method with Brian Geysen. If I keep doing these daily, we're actually gonna get into all this stuff, guys.
00:11:59.168 - 00:12:25.572, Speaker A: So I'm kind of setting the table a little bit. But when I see die with the most likes, one of my fav. I think one of the biggest talents in the space. When I see. And you see his prices are very high. When I see his work, I think of Burroughs in a good sense. Like this is raw, brutal, contemporary satire, which is what we saw here.
00:12:25.572 - 00:12:52.718, Speaker A: Okay, it's outrageous, but it's. There's something being said here about like, kind of just like the shallowness of the entire culture. You know, where it's like, this is what we're reduced to is when we're old, we die of a heart attack at Circuit City and basically die in our own shit. You know, this kind of idea. So. And there's something to be said for this commentary. That's why his work is so expensive.
00:12:52.718 - 00:13:11.958, Speaker A: And we're going to see that here. Like, if you go low to high, the lowest is 28. Okay. You go high to low. I mean, you're always going to get. Yeah, like, you're going to get. It's hard to say with all the prices, because prices don't necessarily reflect the market.
00:13:11.958 - 00:13:31.822, Speaker A: But all to say, you know, you want to get a one of. One of die with the most likes, you can pay 2500. Like, I think that's. What's the cheapest is 1850 tezos or 1515. Hundred, 1513, 5012, 50. I think that is your cheapest. 1250 tezos.
00:13:31.822 - 00:14:13.888, Speaker A: Mine was an edition of four. You can get an edition of two for 500. But a brilliant, brilliant, what I'd call satirist. This is probably to me, the most iconic, which is called dinette, bass pro shops. Again, kind of the same idea. Diet bass pro shops in northern Indiana bleed out in front of a group of masturbating idiots who use flashing and consumerism methods to euthanize failing marriages and eternal sadness. Bite the hook cast from the ceiling and feeling the freedom a big mouth bass feels after finally giving up submitting to the gutting, to the stupid effing pitcher, to the consumption.
00:14:13.888 - 00:14:39.948, Speaker A: You don't need to fight anymore. Simply have your lifeless corpse dragged into a boat that will eventually ruin a family. Genius writing. Okay, like, this guy can write. And even just the. You could argue. The perspective is so brutal, and it's brutal satire, which is in a great tradition of, you know, again, burroughs, you could argue.
00:14:39.948 - 00:15:04.914, Speaker A: Sad. We're talking about Marquis de Sade and others. So another brilliant work. This one went for a lot of money, guys. This is an edition of four as well. And this sold to Joe Rogan's dad, very prominent collector in the space, as most of us know, for 669 tazos. So I feel like I was getting a deal here.
00:15:04.914 - 00:15:34.554, Speaker A: This one's, I think, maybe a little more special, a touch bit more iconic. Right? So it's probably, you know, it's worth that extra money, but it was kind of the last one like that. And let's just take a quick look. Actually, it's super rare. I don't want this episode to go. I'm trying to keep these short guys die with. But just for comparison here, the sales are off the charts here for this guy.
00:15:34.554 - 00:15:54.502, Speaker A: Very friendly guy, by the way. And he actually messaged me after. Very. Just nice about it. Then he bought one of my works, actually. We'll get to that in a second. And so look at the sales here for the year dad died.
00:15:54.502 - 00:16:35.498, Speaker A: Again, sad, JG Ballard, because what is the point of all this? He said, the great author, the british author, you could argue there's a twin constellation in post World War Two literature. Burroughs was in America, and JG Ballard was in the UK. The great, sometimes called the last classic surrealist, you know, huge influence on me. He talked about honesty being a trade of the modern, like, radical honesty. And he was talking about Dali and say, works like the great masturbator and other works like that. Okay? And I don't even want to go too far into all. All this stuff because it.
00:16:35.498 - 00:17:16.484, Speaker A: But radical honesty. And again, we're back to this idea of human nature, this idea that as an artist, we're not just making pretty pictures here. There is a tradition that is basically revealing, you know, the reality of humanity and human nature, revealing inner space. What's going on here? Because by understanding that we are going to learn something and be basically make better judgments. Okay, we're gonna make better judgments because we're gonna understand ourselves better. So this actually has political ramifications. Okay, we were talking the last episode, how things can get dangerous.
00:17:16.484 - 00:18:03.372, Speaker A: It's true. Okay, these aren't, we're not just making pretty pictures here, okay? They're at least, and people make art for different reasons. Some people do make just to make a pretty picture, but it's important that we're aware of all this other stuff. So again, the year dad died, so there's a, I would say there's a bit of a radical honesty in his work. And this brutal sort of, you know, ground beef, you know, again, just this kind of very graphic portrayal of beef, you know, again, just, you know, Fuddruckers, which is like a burger joint in North America. We have one of those in the city I grew up in, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, actually. I didn't realize they were that big and so, but look at the prices here, guys.
00:18:03.372 - 00:18:39.502, Speaker A: These are for one of ones, but we're looking at 10,000, 13,000, 10,000 going to prominent collectors. Colborne of the Museum of Crypto Art Anonymous, you know, 10,000, 10,000. So pretty significant. He has a series here called legalized ground beef 7000. This went to super rare roses, one of the founders of super rare from, or one of the main kind of guys at super rare. So, yeah, people like his work and I like his work. I was a little slow to it.
00:18:39.502 - 00:19:10.172, Speaker A: Colborne has another 115 thousand dollars, ten ETH. So I look at, okay, I just spent $600. Like, I should be able to get my money back at some point on this. So it didn't feel like a huge, in a sense, I'm just converting and changing my allocation because I just keep my crypto altogether. But I'm going to have to stop doing that because I'm going to have to start collecting bitcoin again sometime soon. So I just wanted to touch on Dai with the most likes. And finally he bought a work of mine, which was really nice.
00:19:10.172 - 00:19:39.914, Speaker A: It was kind of almost back to our earlier theme of don't get discouraged because I had, uh, made this work. And it was, it was fairly cheap. It was seven tazos. This just this kind of pixel art sketchbook was the first one. It was just me kind of screwing around, making sketches with a square brush, just, you know, and playing with these kind of media images. There's Elon Musk and the Zeus thing, I called it Zeus. He's like, I love that work.
00:19:39.914 - 00:19:54.602, Speaker A: He's like, I was like, yeah, I almost burnt that. He's like, I want to print that and put it on my wall. Okay. And maybe he was being nice. Who knows? Maybe not. Maybe he feels that way. But all to say, it's kind of back to this.
00:19:54.602 - 00:20:13.260, Speaker A: Like, I'm not immune to the feelings of the herd. When our works go unsold. Again, this idea of social proof, but in reverse. Social proof is like, oh, okay. Other people like it, so I should like it, too. That also goes. There's a negative side to that where nobody likes it, so nobody buys it.
00:20:13.260 - 00:20:35.452, Speaker A: Okay. So we always got to kind of fight that a little bit and trust our own instincts, especially when we collect. But also, as an artist, like, don't get down on yourself. Just keep your conviction. Okay, so I want to touch on this. Moving to Diego Barrow, who I've sort of seen in the last month or two. Very friendly guy, great vibe.
00:20:35.452 - 00:20:58.802, Speaker A: And I just, you know, I picked up a couple of his works, and I really liked what was going on here. I picked it up yesterday. Just wanted to look at some newer works. I love what's going on in the clouds. Just like the. What I would call, like, the outrageousness. Like, he's doing these digital paintings, I think artwork done on procreate photo painting intervention.
00:20:58.802 - 00:21:22.074, Speaker A: So he's basically painting digitally on top of photos. Okay. And what I like is just kind of the outrageousness of the clouds here. And it kind of evoked. I was looking, I think I have it open. It evoked, kind of. And maybe this is a stretch for you guys, but if you know the work of Julian Schnabel, he kind of has what I would call, like, outrageous brushstrokes.
00:21:22.074 - 00:21:50.354, Speaker A: Yeah, here's some newer work. Like, these are just brushstrokes that you'd kind of never make as an artist sometime. And that was just kind of what it reminded me of was kind of Julian Schnabel's recent work. This is at Max Hetzler here in Berlin. I've actually met, only saying hi. I've been to, like, three or four art shows, maybe three where Julian Schnabel was there. And I have a lot of kind of mutual friends, I guess, or a few.
00:21:50.354 - 00:22:24.276, Speaker A: That's kind of one of the great things about living in Berlin. I mean, Schnabel was arguably, like, one of the guys in the 1980s, and he's having a resurgence, and you can go to art shows here and have no money because it costs no money to get in, have a glass of wine, and there you're practically hanging out with Julian Schnabel, or he's 10ft away. That's cool. So I just want to point this one out because I thought this was a really interesting piece. Again, the outrageousness of the brushstrokes here and the clouds is what I really just caught my attention. So good job, Diego. Looking forward to seeing more.
00:22:24.276 - 00:22:54.240, Speaker A: This was a work that the myth picked up that I just thought was kind of interesting. I didn't buy it, but I just thought it was like an interesting, like, again, this. It's a little complicated, the background business here. But you have this interesting contrast with kind of drawing with this kind of, for lack of better word, collaged painting fragments. Digital painting fragments. I just thought it was worth pointing out. That's by artist called Santiago.
00:22:54.240 - 00:23:12.168, Speaker A: So just some new artists. This is an artist I also haven't collected. But I noticed they, you know, I found them just like someone else had bought it in their collection. So I took a look. This is summer blues. Two s's at the end. And yeah, I mean, this is kind of in that psychedelic genre.
00:23:12.168 - 00:23:29.224, Speaker A: We saw that with UdO 66. There's skitchism. Who we haven't looked at, we'll look at. There's a kind of a whole genre of psychedelic art. And this is also what I want to point out is summer blues has a market. The edition of ten. And look at this.
00:23:29.224 - 00:23:41.624, Speaker A: So, you know, this stuff is popular. You know, pixel art's popular. So is like this psychedelic art. And this. It's not just because it's psychedelic art. It's because this person is doing interesting work. And this is called mischievous.
00:23:41.624 - 00:24:04.684, Speaker A: It really be like this sometimes. And it's like we got a skull skeleton. Kind of like a psychedelic imagery is what I'd call this. Again, that kind of work, that zapcomics, as we pointed out in an earlier episode, kind of pioneered. We didn't go into like some of the inside of zapcomics and the other works. But we. If we do this daily, guys, we're gonna have more than enough to talk about.
00:24:04.684 - 00:24:36.458, Speaker A: This is just another artist that I didn't buy, but just caught my eye and I'm kinda, you know, I think it's interesting. I wasn't rushing out to buy it, but I'll tell you what I did like a lot is the concept before the fall, inspired by the fall scene of ghost in the shell. And this is just part of one of my dreams. Okay. So other people love this work. And it sold out edition at 20. It was just accept offer.
00:24:36.458 - 00:25:11.374, Speaker A: So this person is also popular. I want to play, though. I want to play the music, you know? So I like the direction of this is basically what I'm saying. And the music picks up. It's two minutes here. We'll go a little further. It's like a whole song.
00:25:11.374 - 00:25:43.090, Speaker A: And then you have these kind of like ghost fish. So, you know, in kind of exciting music. It's good music. So again, there's an excitement here that we're not necessarily seeing every day in the contemporary art galleries. And I'm generalizing enormously here. Okay. Because there is exciting stuff going on in contemporary art galleries.
00:25:43.090 - 00:26:02.954, Speaker A: I'm just seeing way more of it on object. Okay. So I think that is. I think we've covered everything, guys. We've done burrows. Oh, you know, just one last thing on here is me from the other day. Remember I was saying to go to my friend's art show.
00:26:02.954 - 00:26:21.206, Speaker A: This is my friend Caroline. Caroline Brown, who is the artist. She's american. I met this guy Peter, who is also, he's from Iceland, and he's just in Berlin for a month. And I think he's going to Thailand or something, one of these kind of nomad artists. But he's in the neighborhood now. We'll probably go for a beer.
00:26:21.206 - 00:26:45.034, Speaker A: We had a great time together. And there, of course, is me with Caroline's artwork in the background. So with that, just a quick note. I'm not sure if I'm going to be posting the next two days because I'm heading to Baden Baden for my friend Leo's wedding, and that should be a heck of a lot of fun. So I may have a couple of days off here, which might be good. Who knows? Maybe I will post anyways. Maybe I'll bring my laptop with me.
00:26:45.034 - 00:26:48.574, Speaker A: So until next time, take care.
