00:00:02.800 - 00:00:23.834, Speaker A: A major correction. It is not Samuel Johnson who wrote Pamela, it is Samuel Richardson. Very, very important correction to make. We're going to take a closer look. Welcome back, everyone. Artist journal, August 22, 2023. Broadcasting from the summer of the mind in Berlin, Germany.
00:00:23.834 - 00:00:52.600, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelli. Playing my phone into my microphone, lo fi. Clownvamp was wondering, how do you play the music at the start of the Twitter spaces, I told them I press play on my laptop and put my phone close by so my laptop will be heard by the phone. And that is how I get music in. It is very lo fi. So welcome back. I think it's gonna be a shorter show.
00:00:52.600 - 00:01:13.500, Speaker A: Fingers crossed. Fingers crossed here, and thank you for all the wonderful comments yesterday. It was a homecoming of sorts coming back here. I'm glad people enjoy the show. I mean, usually when I finish, I just hand in my work as usual, and. But as the day goes on, you feel better and better about it. So, again, I appreciate the comments.
00:01:13.500 - 00:01:52.104, Speaker A: So you probably recognize the artist here, Ezra Eslin. You know, her homage of sorts to the Barbie franchise. This is pretty funny, actually, how it's written. Barbie with a y. Just notice that only in theaters July 21, she's having the best day. And then classic Ezra Eslin with the sword and the blood, decapitated head and the gun, the violence. And here is maybe Ezra Eslin herself or some, you know, probably mom buying the Barbie figure for the child and the wonderful palm trees, by the way, in the background.
00:01:52.104 - 00:02:19.436, Speaker A: So just kind of fun. Totally awesome. And classic Ezra Eslin. There's a couple of things that I'd consider kind of classic about her work. First is this, I guess, what I'd call the illustrative, the line work, I suppose we would call it here. You see how the lines are always kind of separated and there's this little gap here and there that is classic Ezra Eslin. It kind of creates her style.
00:02:19.436 - 00:02:46.236, Speaker A: It's one of the main elements or ingredients, you might say, trademarks, her style. Another is, I would say, this coloring that is not always outlined. You see how the blood is just red? It's not outlined. And you see the hearts on the dress, you know, the lighting here. So kind of a combination of some. Some things are outlined, some things are not. And I'd say that also is part of her, you know, trademark style.
00:02:46.236 - 00:03:15.970, Speaker A: And from a content perspective, of course, the violence and everything, you know, the violence in the everyday and almost like a satirical violence, she's having the best day. You know, there seems to be satire of sorts and yeah, so just a beautiful orc here, age three. So nice. Beautiful work. I mean, look at that. It looks like a poster. It's probably nicer than the Barbie movie poster.
00:03:15.970 - 00:03:46.396, Speaker A: Let's take a look. Sold for half an ethanol on one bid. And that was by h three xum and sold for half an ETH. So $800. Hi, Barbie, again with a y. And so cool work from Ezra Eslin out of Istanbul, if I'm not mistaken. So very quickly here, since we began with this, I was looking at chat JPT to see what it was saying for the origin of the english novel.
00:03:46.396 - 00:04:14.146, Speaker A: Now, you know, Thomas Mallory, we don't need to go into this. These are kind of like pre novel, you know, Pilgrim's progress by John Bunyan, 1678. These are kind of early things. You start to get closer here with Aphra Behn's Orinoco. And I think she was, she wrote a ton in the late 17th century. You could, you know, one of the first novels in English. So, you know, a figure that has to be noted.
00:04:14.146 - 00:04:52.294, Speaker A: But I think she's sort of. There's something, I guess, for lack of a better term, kind of, I think, tabloid esque or kind of like she, you know, there. Yeah, put it this way. She's not. You read her more for the history than for the art oftentimes. But maybe that's debatable, you know, and interesting topics here, we see them at the very beginning, you know, a story of a noble african prince who was deceived, enslaved, and taken to the english colony of Suriname. So we see here profound topics, though, right? Colonialism, slavery.
00:04:52.294 - 00:06:10.866, Speaker A: And here this is generally considered, you know, the first unambiguous, you know, first novel of the, in English, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. And of course, this also brings up Friday is not mentioned here, but the guy who Robinson Crusoe finds on the island. And back to our discussion on human nature. And we're going to get, here's Samuel Richardson, Pamela, who also wrote Clarissa. Okay, 1740. But back to our idea of human nature. If you remember the story of Robinson Crusoe, what happens? RobinSon Crusoe is stranded on a desert island, and what does he do? He basically reconstitutes civilization, right? So it's kind of like this story, you might say, of human nature and of this desire to create and to dominate and to reshape nature in humanity's image, one could argue, is one of the many themes we could identify or discern in Robinson Crusoe.
00:06:10.866 - 00:06:35.806, Speaker A: So what does a human do that shows up to a desert island. Right. So again, kind of a blank canvas of what does human nature start to do? So an exploration of human nature, one could argue here. And then, of course, we have Samuel Richardson. Again, not Samuel Johnson. Samuel Johnson did the first dictionary, by the way, he's famous. I think he's more.
00:06:35.806 - 00:07:18.734, Speaker A: He's 18th century, I think, a little later. And, yeah, I don't want to get too off course here, but famously, he wrote a lot of essays. I think he kind of repopularized Shakespeare a little bit. So here's Samuel Richardson, 1740, and then here, 1748, Clarissa. And then Henry Fielding is the author we were discussing, who wrote Tom Jones in 1749, wrote Shamilla, a parody of Pamela, in response. So I don't want to go too deep into this. And also Joseph Andrews, who is initially starting as another parody of Pamela, but then took a life of its own.
00:07:18.734 - 00:08:00.128, Speaker A: So the moral of the story here, part of why I'm going into this, is the human nature component. But what you had here was Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding, these two titans of the early english novel. They were responding to each other, particularly fielding responding to Richardson. And the reason I mention that is because this is something that is kind of not stated enough in the arts, in the visual arts, which is artists respond to each other. You see this with Ernst sometimes responding to de Chirico, even across decades. It's not like it has to be in real time or incorporating Duchamp. Right.
00:08:00.128 - 00:08:31.382, Speaker A: Or you see Picasso's surrealist period responding to the surrealists. So this is something that we also see at the beginning of the english novel. And, of course, we see this in renaissance art with, you know, Raphael redoing his stanza, his room in the Vatican, after being one of the architects. Can't remember. Can't remember which architect. The name's slipping my mind. Brunelleschi or Brunis.
00:08:31.382 - 00:09:26.758, Speaker A: Brunelli. Anyway, one of the architects of the Vatican, who is in the Renaissance group, so the story goes, allowed Raphael to get a peek at what Michelangelo was doing in the Sistine chapel and came back and realized he had to completely redo his stanza. Where there's the school of Athens and then all the four walls there, which is a must see if you ever, in your life, you simply have to see this. It is the summit, you could argue, of renaissance art, the high renaissance, you know, Raphael at its height. And again, Raphael. I mean, I think Michelangelo, finally, I said this was going to be a short show. Michelangelo, I think, felt a little bit ripped off by Raphael, but Raphael is one of the great synthesizers, one of these people who just absorbs other people's work.
00:09:26.758 - 00:10:28.916, Speaker A: You know, his master was Piero or was Perugino, is it Pietro? It was Perugino who was brilliant, but kind of because Raphael was his student and basically surpassed him by like, age 19 or 20, arguably. I'd actually say that's a debatable point. I think Perugino still is somewhat underrated. And actually, a lot of the innovation that's attributed to Raphael often one could argue is actually a Perugino innovation. But I'm not going to pretend to be more of an expert on these things than I am. I mean, I just know from going to the museums over the years, but you clearly see in Perugino's work where the source of Raphael's work comes from, then Raphael comes along, absorbs Perugino, absorbs Michelangelo, and look, Raphael is considered the greatest. So it's just one of those ironies of history, isn't it? I don't know if it's ironic.
00:10:28.916 - 00:10:57.228, Speaker A: It's just one of those things. Anyway, so I thought we could do just an open lines here. We've had some great big guests on the last few weeks. I think it's time to just hear from. I always kind of want these. These were started, these Twitter spaces or x spaces. These spaces were begun as a way of people actually being able to say something back.
00:10:57.228 - 00:11:45.550, Speaker A: And artists, because I know what it's like to be an obscure artist. I spent most of my life there. And so here's an opportunity to talk about whatever you want to talk about. Are you working on a project that you're excited about? Do you feel like your work isn't being seen and so you just want to share it with people? Do you have comments or opinions, say on anything we discuss here, or anything in the art scene or even society at large? How was your summer? Come join some fun folks in the art community to share what you're working on and thinking about. So kind of a chill, open lines, a chance to just meet some people, talk about your art, get your work out there, pin your work and all that sort of thing. Should be really fun tomorrow with runetune and that should be great. So check that out.
00:11:45.550 - 00:12:05.744, Speaker A: I have posted that in my twitter feed and thank you for the comments here. Chimasuku Jackson. Almost watch every show as you're always keeping it classy and knowledgeable. Keep it up, brother. So it was great to hear from Chimasuku. Here we are at the one year anniversary here. Thanks to that little push by Chymosuke Jackson.
00:12:05.744 - 00:12:26.564, Speaker A: Also, Runetune. Love the new background to your show. Thank you. I am trying to improve things a little bit. You can see the little name and logo down here, the books in the background. I'm trying to somewhat professionalize this a little bit and it's fun to iterate. It's very fun when you have a project to just keep iterating.
00:12:26.564 - 00:12:39.724, Speaker A: So to stick with it and keep iterating. So thank you. I hope you end up pulling down a book for reference. Yes, this is bound to happen. Also, I had no idea Chi Moscu was the influence to bring the show to video. Very cool. Yeah.
00:12:39.724 - 00:12:57.850, Speaker A: So I was really happy to find that tweet yesterday. And human boy, I agree with Rune tune. Awesome background. Great to have you and artist journal back and thank you, human boy. And this was interesting from Anwe. Thanks for the tea shout out. I hope the whole community will take the dao.
00:12:57.850 - 00:13:19.204, Speaker A: We'll take this tao and shape it together. So that's a pretty. So I guess Anway maybe has something to do with tea. So that is cool. So yeah, absolutely. And tea has really come a long way in the last few months. Like, I noticed they fixed the image loading problem, which was a structural problem that the website had, and they fixed it.
00:13:19.204 - 00:13:42.924, Speaker A: So now everything loads up kind of fast and easy. So there's no reason for that platform not to keep going and evolve. And also, maestro, after each new show, my Tezos Wallace is empty. Thank you. CheerS and thank you, Kyle Flemmer, for the congrats on the one year Lepro chant. Big shout out and more to spiral. Thank you for the one year anniversary message.
00:13:42.924 - 00:14:05.552, Speaker A: So continuing on LB, I thought this was interesting. Tezos has been my main home for my art for more than two years now. I feel this is about to change thanks to Zora. And I'm really excited. So I think that's pretty interesting. People seem to really like Sora. I haven't minted there yet, but I mean, it seems kind of exciting.
00:14:05.552 - 00:14:45.244, Speaker A: And maybe it's the fact that it's an ethereum L2 and it's early. I actually brought it up here, the website here, and they're really promoting the artists too, which is kind of nice. So this is the homepage, the journey in the process of film by Zora. So I'm not sure what this is, but as you see, there's like a Sabato already right up there and there's a lot of like really cheap mints. Maybe artists are you know, it's a way of, like, this one is super cheap. We looked at that yesterday and look discovered featured commemorative art, video, music, podcasts, drops, interactive PDF's. So they are doing a lot here.
00:14:45.244 - 00:15:25.640, Speaker A: And I think I saw Dan control at one point was highlighted here. So they're doing a nice job of just highlighting different artists and everything. So it'll be interesting to see where it goes, because one could argue the big competition that Tezos offers is the low minting fee. And so with very cheap minting, as far as I understand, I don't know how cheap. I'm gonna have to try this myself, but with very low minting fees, could be an interesting alternative. And again, as I've long preached here, multi chain. Go multi chain.
00:15:25.640 - 00:15:57.586, Speaker A: As an artist, you don't owe any blockchain anything in the sense that, you know, you should be diversified, because as we've seen, hen just shut down and what were the people doing who weren't diversified? Maybe some of these blockchains don't make it. Maybe ETH gas fees are through the roof and all of a sudden you have tazos. So, you know, and just like we saw. What did we see recently? Oh, maybe they'll take their. Your royalties away from you on ETH. So then you're also on tasos. Right.
00:15:57.586 - 00:16:31.058, Speaker A: So it's sort of like good financial practice, good business practice, I would argue, is being diversified. That's why I'm a big proponent of being multi chain as an artist. It's a pro artist viewpoint. And here, I can't remember why I brought up Sabato's work. But anyways, beautiful page here and everything, so. And look, 169 minted. I think I was going to look at the price, which I didn't see.
00:16:31.058 - 00:16:50.254, Speaker A: Let me see if I can look at this. This is what I wanted to show, almost minting for nothing. So that disappeared on me. But it was like 0.007. So interesting. Just, you know. So it's kind of still early, actually, even though it's been around for a few months, seemingly.
00:16:50.254 - 00:17:30.200, Speaker A: Rosa Mankman. So you might remember Rosa Mankman from the beyond binary glitch show. And I think they came in to kind of rescue the Sothebys show, where they had. It was like an all male Sothebys glitch show. And so they, after an outcry, curators were recruited in to kind of recurate and add some diversity to the show. So here we are, several months later, still waiting for Sotheby's to pay me for services rendered in April. I am very tired of this one out of four emails.
00:17:30.200 - 00:18:18.640, Speaker A: Get some vague, we will escalate response, and then nothing for weeks, and then again, nothing for weeks on end. Reprehensible. So, yeah, I mean, it's kind of funny, uh, that, uh, Sotheby's isn't paying. It just kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it? Like, what is going on there? They kind of managed to save their, you know, they had a terrible pr situation that kind of got saved because they pivoted very quickly to their credit. But now it's kind of turning back to a bad pr situation. So hopefully Rosa Mekman gets their money. So I thought this was interesting, particularly in contrast to our next tab that we're going to look to here.
00:18:18.640 - 00:18:39.604, Speaker A: Charles AI. What some of you don't understand is that my piece is being raw AI. Art is part of the artistic statement. Sure, I could use Photoshop, but it would dilute the message. So kind of an advocate for raw AI. And for those that might not know, raw AI is basically pure text prompt, no editing. Okay.
00:18:39.604 - 00:19:32.204, Speaker A: The message is that the spread of AI is inevitable. It will change our lives. And what else then raw AI could better represent these times of technological, cultural and artistic revolution where human and machine both cooperate to reach common goal. Nowadays, what else than raw AI could make you question what real art is and spark such heated and passionate debates? And I do have to agree with this. I mean, raw AI really does bring up that perennial question, which always seems to re show up, which is, is this art? What is art? And AI really does do that. And maybe raw AI is its purest form, to Charles AI's point, what other medium could create such emotions on its own? Raw AI art is a challenge to the status quo. So, you know, interesting thought.
00:19:32.204 - 00:20:02.356, Speaker A: But then I saw this midjourney, just released a new feature in painting. You can use this feature to change the subject within an image and add more elements to it. Here's how to do it. And I thought to myself, is this still raw AI? If you're using inpainting? And it's an interesting question in the sense that I'll just show you how this works. Here. I generated a photo of a dog in a park, but now I want to replace it with a cat. To do so, click the very region button.
00:20:02.356 - 00:21:02.302, Speaker A: So here is the new button, and then it gives you some selection tools. Here, just like in Photoshop, the marquee and the lasso. The following window will pop up using either the rectangle tool or the lasso tool, you'll want to drag over the dog to select it. So you select the dog. Next, change the prompt by replacing corgi dog with cat and submit a photo of a cute cat in the park. And there the cat appears with basically the same background, and then you get different cats. So I guess my question is, if you use inpainting, is it still raw AI? And maybe it's just kind of parsing like a distinction without a difference, but it does make you wonder, is it because it's using a text prompt that it's raw AI? Is it because it hasn't been edited at all that it might be raw AI? So it did sort of raise that question for me.
00:21:02.302 - 00:21:31.308, Speaker A: And here, look, they're putting in a flower. Now you select this area here, a photo of a lush tulip bed, and there it appears. So it's all done with AI. There is no drawing required other than the lasso tool. Does that then make it raw AI or not? So just kind of an open question and just some cool developments in the tech here. Little cakes. I really suck at moving around on on cyber.
00:21:31.308 - 00:21:55.058, Speaker A: Join the club, little cakes. Join the club. I think this is their biggest stumbling block at on cyber is actually like, I can do it, but it's so. It feels so cumbersome and laborious. Yeah. So. But feeling very cozy surrounded by many friends, works in Santiago's gallery, you know, and I actually prefer to look at that great hasdrubal waffle there.
00:21:55.058 - 00:22:28.348, Speaker A: I actually prefer to watch a video than to do it myself because I just want to see what it looks like. Right. You can see all the areas without me bumping into things at on cyber. Thanks for giving my soft sounds pieces their own wall. So all to say, cool gallery by Santiago with some really nice work and just kind of a different, you know, in here that looks like yuri. J just like a cool curation. I mean, Santiago really has his own, like, art practice and curation.
00:22:28.348 - 00:22:43.550, Speaker A: So I just think this is interesting. Saw some human kernel back there. Again, hasdrubal waffle. Really just interesting. So it's a minute 16. We can't look at the whole thing, but there's some human kernel. Just awesome.
00:22:43.550 - 00:23:16.066, Speaker A: Again, I weirdly, I like to. This is my favorite way of consuming this is by video because then I don't have to fiddle around and struggle to get through this, which is kind of an interesting aspect. Continuing on, some physical work. And I found this particularly interesting. So this is Greco. And so what do we have here? So we see physical work. We see a jar of paint, a paintbrush shoe.
00:23:16.066 - 00:23:32.854, Speaker A: And it looks like the shoe print is here. Here it's different. It's 20,000. Here it's just money. So you see here what looks like a digital file here. This looks like the original. And then it's almost the tension of the digital copy.
00:23:32.854 - 00:23:54.182, Speaker A: But made physical, but not. But here you have basically a digital artwork. And I actually brought it up here. Let me just show you. So this is the digital artwork. 7016 by 4961. Luxury dinner without food.
00:23:54.182 - 00:24:29.286, Speaker A: And kind of playing off the sports themes that Greco has been playing with. So here, changing the background to green digitally. And then printing it out and then using. So there's this kind of idea. How do you justify the existence of a physical version of a digital artwork? Because when I talk to people, say about my own art. And when it's physical. I make the point that if I have a physical version.
00:24:29.286 - 00:25:02.638, Speaker A: I feel that I've done it in a way that justifies its existence as a physical artwork. And what I mean by that is there's something different or new. Some kind of commentary on the physical nature of the digital work. For example, you know, if I screen print a digital mass on some of the screen memory series. That is interesting for me. Because all of a sudden it's taking digital shapes. And then using screen printing.
00:25:02.638 - 00:25:31.804, Speaker A: And then you kind of interpret and consume these shapes differently. Because they're made with acrylic paint screen printed over top. Rather than just all on this kind of flat digital surface. And so in that respect, it becomes interesting. I'm turning the digital into acrylic paint with screen printing in a really kind of. In a persuasive way, right? So here's another way to do it. Is, let's say you make several copies.
00:25:31.804 - 00:26:04.018, Speaker A: And then it's almost like a word cloud of sorts here. Or this kind of space here. Greco is using as a place and even down here to add different ways of making this work unique. So we're back to this idea of kind of playing with copies. That we can do digitally. And also using a printer. But then how do you make them unique? And then, because this also impacts, you know, the marketing of your work.
00:26:04.018 - 00:26:25.550, Speaker A: And the marketability, the sale ability. The ability to sell your work. Because now what Greco can do. If these are all kind of hand painted. First of all, he can call it a multimedia, physical, original, unique work. And that's kind of interesting, isn't it? I mean, again, we're looking at these. This copying from a digital perspective.
00:26:25.550 - 00:27:01.114, Speaker A: But from a physical perspective, this is a solution, right, where all of a sudden you just kind of leave an area where you can do your own thing. And all of a sudden it's a unique, but without having to make a whole new composition. But nevertheless, as a consumer, I might go, oh, I really like the one with the dollar signs here. I want that one. And that's my favorite. And there's only one, so I can feel good about that, even though I know it's kind of part of the series. So these are the kinds of things that are coming up with digital art, I would argue.
00:27:01.114 - 00:27:24.090, Speaker A: Well, clearly. And again, here we see this is the digital version selling for 200 tezos. A one of one with a orange. With an orange background. So just all very interesting here. And finally, with Greco here, while we're on Greco's work, an oil painting. So this is 50 by 60, and this is also being sold as an NFT.
00:27:24.090 - 00:27:49.036, Speaker A: I'm not clear. I don't. It doesn't say here you get the original painting, but I do have to say this is quite beautifully painted. This is a really skillful, skillfully painted oil painting, from what I can tell here. And really nice kind of brushwork here. I mean, beautifully done. Destino, I assume that's the name of it.
00:27:49.036 - 00:28:09.180, Speaker A: Almost looks like a cricket player, doesn't it? So I'm not sure what the title is, but even these drips are quite beautiful, and they're probably, you know, it's kind of. There's a famous. I might have it here. Do I have. Oh, no, it's under my computer. I'm gonna bring it up tomorrow. It's actually propping up my computer right now.
00:28:09.180 - 00:28:41.756, Speaker A: There's a famous Jasper Johns. I think it's on the COVID here, and there's many. And it's of a flag, and of course, of the american flag. And he's used it many times. And what I love about it is how he emulates the drips of paint, but with this kind of marker. And, you know, it kind of looks like the same thing is going here. And you might say, oh, like, is that legit? But, I mean, Jasper Johns is doing it, and it kind of adds an interesting element of, like, there's an interesting meta there of is the drip.
00:28:41.756 - 00:29:18.254, Speaker A: If you draw the drip, is that authentic, that drip? And does it matter? And if it's not a natural drip, maybe that makes it more interesting. And whatever the case, wherever you land on that, there is a commentary. And really, I'd say the real persuasion is actually in the art. Does it look beautiful here? I think these drips look pretty beautiful. And look at this. I mean, there's also a commentary here as it goes across the outline of the horse's head. Again, showing, you know, self conscious in its artificiality.
00:29:18.254 - 00:29:37.406, Speaker A: All right, so just kind of interesting here. Cool work. Very cool work. Greco, you can guess who this is. So this is Rinnefish with a beautiful physical here. Beautiful physical version. We don't have too much information, so thanks, Daniel.
00:29:37.406 - 00:29:58.500, Speaker A: I'm going to paint acrylic on my old frames today. It will also look good, I think. So this. I'm not sure if this is a inkjet, if this is actually something else. It looks beautiful either way. Or even, you know, a lenticular. It doesn't look like a lenticular, but just interesting to see.
00:29:58.500 - 00:30:20.326, Speaker A: And I have to say, it looks great in this glass casing here. A frame can add a huge amount to a work. Interestingly, if you've never framed your work, it can really. It does change the feeling. It's one of those things. So here's also a collaboration between score and Rinnefish. And of course, score is Saiko Ihara, eternal bond.
00:30:20.326 - 00:30:43.942, Speaker A: So this isn't released yet. There's gonna be. It starts in 4 hours here at a price of 0.05 ETH. And let me just bring it up for you. Nice music, too. My mic is super sensitive, so the music might be a little quiet.
00:30:43.942 - 00:31:06.850, Speaker A: I need to get a new microphone. One thing at a time. Really soothing. I hope you can hear that. Incredibly soothing. So a beautiful 32nd work here by Saiko and rinifish. And of course, you see Rinifish's characters here and then Psycho's character maybe in the middle.
00:31:06.850 - 00:31:27.620, Speaker A: Beautiful collaboration. So that is minting in a few hours. So you can probably guess who this is. Dinny P. Thibodeaux, which looks like hasdrubal waffle. And I mean, pretty clearly, unambiguously, I would say this is a. I found this to be quite a powerful work, I have to admit.
00:31:27.620 - 00:32:06.106, Speaker A: Or I have to say, kind of like these tiers, again, using, like, these kids tools. And, you know, also like, remember that. That tablet from, like, the 1990s? That it looked like his dribble waffle bought on eBay or something and was. So if you remember that episode, maybe he's using that. I mean, so just, again, the textures are gorgeous. And there's another thing I want to point out here, which, again, kind of going back to this theme I was discussing yesterday of making it look easy. This is brilliant.
00:32:06.106 - 00:32:40.688, Speaker A: Leaving again, it's kind of like leaving your process behind, not worrying about getting a perfect selection of the character here as a layer. So just kind of like cutting it out. Doing a pretty nice job too. Like, it's a fairly careful job, importantly, I would say, but not worrying about getting every little white thing, you know, white pixel here in the outline out. So I think that's kind of. I found that actually super interesting, as usual. And then here you see this just beautiful.
00:32:40.688 - 00:33:16.376, Speaker A: Almost wear video back to the user interface subject matter, you know. And again, sort of like we saw with RJ celebrating the user interface of these old paint programs. Right? And then, you know, what does that do? Maybe that's a layer, uh, maybe, you know, so, uh, just beautiful work here. And then again, this, uh, beautiful frame and background, which just brings it all to life. And like, I mean, what is this? Tears with eyes on a hot dog? Uh, just classic, uh, sad snack. Boo hoo. So probably just stream of consciousness.
00:33:16.376 - 00:33:32.924, Speaker A: So Denny P. Thibodeaux, assistant manager at sunglasses Hut, is now the account here. So. And I believe one of these, this one here, the demiurge was sent to me. So big. Thank you for that, I think, before I left. So appreciate that.
00:33:32.924 - 00:34:02.034, Speaker A: Here it is. Just awesome edition of five. And just beautiful work here. Kind of looks like the same program, hey, but a different user interface perhaps here, and just kind of glitch. Giffing it out a little bit. And then again, that contrast of the static here and the dynamic in the background just kind of adds a poetry to it. So beautiful and poetic here from Denny P.
00:34:02.034 - 00:34:17.758, Speaker A: Thibodeaux. Here's another one. Untitled slide piece number eight. And just more interesting digital celebration here. A celebration of digital texture. Just beautiful here. And another one.
00:34:17.758 - 00:34:46.979, Speaker A: Scanners. BPTE scanners, Benjamin Pierce tribute edition. And so referencing, I assume, the David Cronenberg film scanners. And where the guy's head explodes. I don't think I've seen that, but I mean, I've just been around enough where I know about that, I think also Haiti Rockette has also done a tribute to scanners. There's. So those would actually hang beautifully together, wouldn't they? So just another cool work here.
00:34:46.979 - 00:35:01.435, Speaker A: This was just released August 5. And here's one more. August 4. Doodle descending a staircase. So a play on Marcel Duchamp's nude descending a staircase, one assumes. And here, multiple mouths here. And almost.
00:35:01.435 - 00:35:19.488, Speaker A: Here's the staircase. And here is the nude descending the staircase. So super hilarious, actually. Brilliant as usual. Doodle descending a staircase. Number eight by the great hasdrubal waffle, now known as Dinny P. Thibodeaux.
00:35:19.488 - 00:35:39.738, Speaker A: If you've never listened to that Twitter space, it's on YouTube with hasdrubal waffle. It is absolutely fascinating. It is. I'm very proud of that recording that we did there. That was great. Continuing on, this got a little bit of attention and deservedly, very interesting work here. This is by grotesque Chicago.
00:35:39.738 - 00:35:52.954, Speaker A: It's called title. Nature displays its violence in beautiful ways. Sometimes. Most drawn on deluxe paint, 220 23. So mouse drawn. So let me just see. Maybe I can make this bigger.
00:35:52.954 - 00:36:20.266, Speaker A: Yeah, look at how huge this is. So mouse drawn. Look at how big it is. Maybe that's part of the secret of this work, is it looks like it's all manually done and doing this wave here. I mean, it's hard to imagine. So it's done with a mouse, interestingly, and just really interesting textures here. And I was going to say, I wonder what program it was.
00:36:20.266 - 00:36:45.840, Speaker A: Deluxe paint. So just really cool here. And really beautifully done here. Again, nature in pixel art, for whatever reason, has just a natural contrast. Continuing on, RJ, with a little bit of this. Looks like some kind of enigmatic scene here. What I found particularly interesting is called enshrined worship through the screen.
00:36:45.840 - 00:37:12.810, Speaker A: And as you can see here, see on the top left, you have, as we see here, the same as that Mac interface. So still playing with the UI here. A bit of a meta here in this window. And then this kind of scene, this natural scene with a monument in it, seen through a screen, and a bit of a glitch there. So interesting work from RJ. For eight tazos. There are eight left.
00:37:12.810 - 00:37:25.666, Speaker A: I'm scared to look if there are any of those other works left that we were looking at yesterday. Silva san two's rescue. So this is from the 17th. So a relatively new one. A glitch. Rom. Nice piece.
00:37:25.666 - 00:37:47.300, Speaker A: Kind of reminds me of Greece a little bit. The beaches out there. Really beautiful along the beach here. I don't know what kind of processing is done here, but it kind of has a bit of a different feel to it. The pixels, they're almost like these kind of circular rectangles here with the helicopter coming through. Nice piece. It looks like it sold out.
00:37:47.300 - 00:38:06.478, Speaker A: Oh, no. Three left at 320. And here's another one. Got them. So a fighter plane. Almost like flight simulator of sorts. And again, playing almost with user interface again, but within a game of the plane and celebrating that and just the game itself and the drama of going.
00:38:06.478 - 00:38:35.684, Speaker A: A jet fighter, MiG 29 fighter pilot. This would go. Got em. Now, is that the name of the Roy Lichtenstein work? What is that called? Roy Lichtenstein jet? Is that called this one here? Wham. That's okay, so it's not called Gottm. I was almost wondering if there is a distant reference there. Okay, continuing on.
00:38:35.684 - 00:38:57.448, Speaker A: Okay, we gotta go fast. Mech txt pillar of salt. So interesting. Another what seems to be unreleased work with just a little bit of gifing here in this kind of bright green flashing, just a tiny bit. So interesting experimentation here. 6th, 1400 views. Impressive.
00:38:57.448 - 00:39:23.164, Speaker A: And here's another work based on a photo by Jord creates daily practice. Special thanks to Jordcreates for allowing me to draw based on their great photo reference and comments. So a little clue here into mech TXT's interpretive style. So very interesting here. And beautiful. So how many? So 926 views? This was just posted this morning. And here's the process.
00:39:23.164 - 00:40:11.954, Speaker A: Let's look at this. So this is interesting because if you're wondering if mech TXT puts this as a layer underneath, he doesn't seemingly. And maybe that's actually a better solution than tracing is because then you get more of a natural distortion, which maybe makes it look more like a work of art than just some traced work. So interesting revelation here from Mech TXT, a beautiful beach work and making it look easy, actually. Stalamere about to touch some grass, sand and sun. Congratulations, Stalamere. And you know, I was working on some beach works and so this is a really nice job that Stalamere did here with his palm tree sun beach.
00:40:11.954 - 00:40:37.534, Speaker A: Very nice. Continuing on, you can probably guess who this is. Goyang arts, also known as goyong. Good morning. This kind of looks like a work in progress, doesn't it? And you see the trademark kind of masked out, digital, kind of pixelated areas of everywhere else is illustrated. Nice flat blue here. Probably much more interesting than a gradient.
00:40:37.534 - 00:40:57.380, Speaker A: So beautifully done here. Kind of looks like New York, if I had to guess, but not sure. This almost looks like Central park or something. But these are buildings here, so I'm not sure what's going on or what city this is. I don't think we get a clue. And New York maybe has taller buildings in this, so I'm not sure where this is. Collection of punk 7635.
00:40:57.380 - 00:41:47.044, Speaker A: Okay, so this is probably an older work, interestingly, the kisser. So this is a collaboration, hilariously, between Ed Marolla and Eduardo Pulitzer. And Ed's going to be on the Twitter space a week from tomorrow. So that is exciting and looking forward to that, the kisser with love from the sixties. So interesting. Another kind of, you know, going in a slightly different direction here, it seems from a content perspective and even a bit from an execution perspective here from Ed Marolla, still recognizably his, but different and so interesting kind of photo, kind of family with love from the sixties, kind of a family theme. So far in the last two works we've seen, again, this is a collaboration, interestingly, with himself, seemingly Pamelo Cerrone.
00:41:47.044 - 00:42:33.128, Speaker A: Pablo. So a couple of works here and another kind of illustrative, pixelated GiF here, a lot of fun. This is a one of one for 45 tezos, which is only dollar 31 these days. So if you don't have a Pamelo Cerrone one of one, there are, they are reasonably priced here, disco devil edition of eight for only $1.54. So again, Pamelo has been around this scene for quite a long time and, you know, very consistent mentor. I thought this was interesting. This is something that maybe isn't utilized enough, the so called dancing ants in Photoshop and using them as subject matter and kind of keeping them, you know, maybe you record your screen in order to get them.
00:42:33.128 - 00:43:12.442, Speaker A: So, you know, the selection tool here we see in what are often called the dancing ants, this moving kind of almost like little ants here that represent your selection in Photoshop. So interesting work here from Anna Annax Molina. And moving right along here, Naberius, the ars goetia. And again, Cerberus, cerebus caribus. And it's called Naberius. So again, I'm not sure if Daniel W. Is using AI to kind of create different mythological, like combine mythological traits and figures.
00:43:12.442 - 00:43:37.540, Speaker A: I'm not sure, but pretty interesting. And, yeah, I mean, this is exactly what you think of as the three headed dog, I think, at the end of the inferno there by Dante, I think. Or is that the devil that's three headed at the end? We can look that up another day. Let's look that up, though. Let's not forget. And the Jasper Johns. Really, I just want to, from a technical level, really enjoying.
00:43:37.540 - 00:43:58.292, Speaker A: There's some evolution here in the way it's being printed. Really nicely done here. Again, this kind of paper, digital print, digital image with kind of a paper feeling to it. Really nicely done. Naberius. Interesting title. Scarlet blossom edition of five.
00:43:58.292 - 00:44:21.882, Speaker A: This is sold out. And now 50 tezos from Bridget, New York City, who has great taste in art. So this is from a few days ago. So nice piece, edition of five. Look at that, look at that. So just really nice, I assume. Digital artwork scarlet blossom by Katarina create, who has been a joy to follow here.
00:44:21.882 - 00:44:42.516, Speaker A: Timothy Jullien. Eclectic affair. Kind of going in a slightly new direction from these interiors and bit of a. Almost a Hockney feel, that kind of quiet pool architecture. You can't even tell if the pool is full. Interestingly, you have the shadow. Is it an empty swimming pool? Well, it'd have to be quite deep if it is.
00:44:42.516 - 00:45:30.684, Speaker A: And the palm tree still playing, you know, very consistent with the style, using outlines as an opportunity for different patterning, as we see here in the lawn or the green grass or whatever it is. And the walls here. And so Roccano, so you might remember this style of Recanos before he went into the objects that were kind of getting falling apart. Let me just show you, actually. Of course, this is Recano from the last few months here, you know, FIFA, where the objects are kind of disassembling and reassembling. But now returning to this earlier style with gradients and lines similar to Daniel W. But different, markedly different, particularly in the outline.
00:45:30.684 - 00:45:54.622, Speaker A: Daniel W. Does not keep the outlines, whereas Roccano does. And there is a difference in palette oftentimes and application, you might say, of the gradient. So here are a couple of parrots maybe happy to do something kind of natural static. Go back to this, you know, look at that. Some very interesting oblique occasions. Edition of 25 for tezos.
00:45:54.622 - 00:46:16.754, Speaker A: And here's a couple more here. Interesting kind of plants below here, a summer breeze. And this is 25 edition of 25 for two tezos. And one more here, some sailboat stocking. Edition of 25 for two tezos. So nice work. And just interesting to see Roccano return to this earlier style.
00:46:16.754 - 00:46:43.064, Speaker A: And continuing on San Fernando. And this is an edition of ten, I guess it's 100 on secondary. And I thought this was pretty cool, these ducks here that are almost joining into each other as you see. So. And just like this beautiful kind of, you know, this rainbow gradient kind of, they become one to a certain degree. Nice work hole. Perfect title there.
00:46:43.064 - 00:47:12.718, Speaker A: Here's another one that Sanfei posted on Twitter. And kind of cool subject matter here. Almost looks like these National Geographic documentaries here and playing with this kind of glitched out rainbow esque. Look at that. So almost a metaphor for the whole art style here is this cheetah running. Beautiful Doctor version was a nice new piece. Great color and nice just there's something that does hit in this one quite a bit.
00:47:12.718 - 00:47:40.002, Speaker A: This beautiful kind of black and white with the green almost de curico colors here again. And yeah, just something really nice about it. And the green and the orange don't really have too much to say about it other than it just really looks good. And these interesting pyramids. Addition of 13 sold out now on secondary for 100. And they were selling for five tezos each. And doctor version still retaining six.
00:47:40.002 - 00:47:51.002, Speaker A: So you may be able to put an offer in on that. And Renki. Hadaboo. This is Hadaboo. I plan to go here someday. So super prolific. Just bringing up the latest here from Renki.
00:47:51.002 - 00:48:15.584, Speaker A: Kind of cool digital noise and structure here. Just kind of an interesting work by Renki. And usually ten available for eleven tazos. And here are some of the other works by Renki from the last few weeks here. So super prolific, I think about. I think Reinke does one a day, if I'm not mistaken. So very cool.
00:48:15.584 - 00:48:48.540, Speaker A: And just wrapping up here, last days of summer Louie. And just another kind of interesting kind of collage of sorts. Eccentric fried chicken is the series, an edition of seven for $1.73. And here you see the sand done in one way. So kind of a summer vibe in this show. And you see almost this oil painting, but then mixed with, like, print and collage. And again, the hair, you know, one kind of patterning and the sky a different kind of, you know, oil painting and everything.
00:48:48.540 - 00:49:18.626, Speaker A: So almost looks like, you know, in the background here, almost looks like Google deep dream from, like, 2015 or something. Interesting work. And also Turkarak. I did want to hit on this series here. Just kind of out of nowhere, fully Bible one, Jesus on trial. And then you see these little edits put in here by Turkarak. So just interesting work here in this Bible that Turkarak found that is kind of visually represented here with almost these photograph esque images.
00:49:18.626 - 00:49:41.120, Speaker A: And it looks like it's turkish, if I had to guess. Here underneath there are four of these. And here's the betrayal of Judas, where he goes to kiss Jesus. Here, Judas betrays Jesus fully Bible too. And here's another one. Holy spirit, come upon the faithful with great power. So kind of a wild bible here with these kind of pictures to represent what's happening.
00:49:41.120 - 00:50:10.556, Speaker A: The baptism of Jesus. And again, it looks like Turkarak has put some edits in here. So just interesting work here from Turkarak. And also finally, demon ego with an edition of ten and almost going with a comic book panel format here. Works beautifully. It looks beautiful. And, yeah, just a nice combination of different, you know, images, portrayals, representations, mediums and everything.
00:50:10.556 - 00:50:44.444, Speaker A: Again, using that notebook format and even a little bit of, you know, something on top and at the bottom. A movie with all scenes raw. Available for twelve tezos on primary eight. Left an ad champ with just a cool kind of physical work here. And just nice painting here from ad. And this is strange p who I think has been the person commenting for a long time, wondering why their work is not on here. So I finally saw and here is some of their work.
00:50:44.444 - 00:51:14.100, Speaker A: Kind of this augmented reality here in normal space with a bit of synth work. So kind of 3d animation kind of cool music too. Almost like a Detroit techno sort of thing. People dancing. Nice music. I wonder. I wonder if strange P made that music too.
00:51:14.100 - 00:51:33.904, Speaker A: Great. Nice, nice track. Mikey de la creme with another blues work here. I didn't see this minted anywhere but looking good and more with an arctic sort of feel. Again using mid journey, probably raw AI. Gotta love the AI signature there. That is hilarious.
00:51:33.904 - 00:52:19.084, Speaker A: Really cool. I don't see a link to anything so maybe just post it online? Sky Goodman with some shoes here. A study in the de evolution of heels synesthesia fashion line in the Lost Sneakers series. So AI and glitch and this is August 20, 2023 already 255 tazos, so I assume sold out on primary and just some interesting colors. And these high heels kind of mixed with sneakers seemingly, and kind of devolving into each other the urge to merge and evolve and finally tooks with a new AI work. I believe it's new and just interesting structure and color as usual from tuques. And that is your show, my friends.
00:52:19.084 - 00:52:35.074, Speaker A: Hopefully I see you on Twitter spaces just come by and say hi. It's a super casual one. Bring a coffee, talk about your art or even what you want to do, not even what you have done. It's just an opportunity to hang out and share a little bit about yourself and what you're up to. Until next time, take care.
