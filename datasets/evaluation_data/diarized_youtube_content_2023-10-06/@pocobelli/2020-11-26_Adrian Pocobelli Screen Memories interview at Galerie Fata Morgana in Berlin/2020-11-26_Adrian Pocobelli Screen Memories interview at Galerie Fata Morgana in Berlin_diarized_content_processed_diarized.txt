00:01:01.134 - 00:01:13.742, Speaker A: Here we are at the opening of Adrian's solo show at Fata Morgana in the COVID times. Adrienne, so nice to be here. I thought maybe you could give us.
00:01:13.758 - 00:01:15.514, Speaker B: A little bit of a tour through the show.
00:01:16.134 - 00:01:23.966, Speaker C: Sure, I'd love to. And thanks, Paulina, for the. I'll just shut this door. Thanks for the. Thanks for the question, really.
00:01:24.110 - 00:01:24.454, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:01:24.494 - 00:01:27.394, Speaker C: So this show is called screen Memories.
00:01:27.854 - 00:01:31.446, Speaker B: And I guess it's a culmination of.
00:01:31.470 - 00:01:43.874, Speaker C: About three years of work. And basically what we have here is samples of that work. So these are all composed on a phone, iPhone X.
00:01:44.534 - 00:01:47.334, Speaker B: And I would use the fill tool.
00:01:47.414 - 00:02:00.284, Speaker C: In certain apps, and I would take images and I'd fill, and I'd make them fill in. They look like cool little digital images. And I thought, how could I make these physical?
00:02:00.704 - 00:02:02.912, Speaker B: And so I ended up deciding to.
00:02:02.928 - 00:02:12.724, Speaker C: Do inkjet and then doing the fills, screen printing them over top. It took me a while to actually figure out to use screen printing to get these sort of hard edges.
00:02:13.544 - 00:02:16.112, Speaker B: I did a show like this earlier called relatable.
00:02:16.288 - 00:02:28.584, Speaker C: I actually painted it. I actually painted, and it wasn't as effective. So screen printing was really the solution to get those sort of crisp digital edges and these strange fills.
00:02:28.744 - 00:02:33.404, Speaker B: And so that's basically what we have here.
00:02:33.784 - 00:02:34.880, Speaker A: Okay.
00:02:35.072 - 00:02:35.464, Speaker D: Wow.
00:02:35.504 - 00:02:37.084, Speaker B: And there's so many references.
00:02:37.504 - 00:02:37.888, Speaker D: Wow.
00:02:37.936 - 00:02:45.916, Speaker A: And there are so many references to art history. Right? I mean, these are. Are these favorite images or are they just, I don't know, the top searched.
00:02:45.940 - 00:02:49.704, Speaker B: For images, or did you choose the original works?
00:02:50.404 - 00:02:58.476, Speaker C: I chose these. Cause they're canonical. And I actually have a modern version of this show, like with mcgreats and.
00:02:58.500 - 00:03:04.228, Speaker B: Everything, but this, you know, ready made.
00:03:04.276 - 00:03:14.844, Speaker C: Of sorts or screenshot, whatever. And I also find this is sort of a theme in my work, too. Maybe we can go to the other room. Is this sort of commercialization also?
00:03:15.184 - 00:03:20.848, Speaker B: There's kind of an irony there that I find interesting. Yeah, this is a Bellini datche, and.
00:03:20.896 - 00:03:30.968, Speaker C: This is actually considered one of the greatest portraits in art history, actually. I've actually watched a lecture on the great courses, and that's what the professor said.
00:03:31.016 - 00:03:35.168, Speaker B: This is one of the great masterpiece of italian painting.
00:03:35.216 - 00:03:56.314, Speaker C: So for me, it's. I purposefully sort of take these kind of iconic works. I mean, we have couple of raphaels here. We have the Titian. I sort of zoomed in and cropped on the Bacchus and Ariadne there. So I do it as kind of a fan. It's also a remix of trying to modernize, you know, these works.
00:03:56.314 - 00:04:15.490, Speaker C: And, yeah, and then there's this other room here as well where. Yeah, I mean, in a sense, you have screenshots of Google image searches, but from a mobile phone. Right. And where I include, again, this sort of fills. And I use the pencil tool too.
00:04:15.562 - 00:04:18.866, Speaker B: And I do all sorts of fascinating.
00:04:18.930 - 00:04:23.494, Speaker A: Technique, the way you're combining the past with the present.
00:04:24.034 - 00:04:24.458, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:24.506 - 00:04:31.050, Speaker C: There is a sort of a kind of trying to refresh the painting to a certain degree, which is maybe overly.
00:04:31.082 - 00:04:34.218, Speaker B: Ambitious production of the original, let's put it that way.
00:04:34.386 - 00:04:44.302, Speaker C: So, yeah, so it's kind of a way of refreshing. You get the contrast of the, you know, making on a phone. I always like the phone because it's very modern, it's very fresh.
00:04:44.478 - 00:04:44.894, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:04:44.934 - 00:04:47.070, Speaker B: You know, as a tool, it's not just a gimmick.
00:04:47.182 - 00:04:49.502, Speaker C: I actually think it makes some of the freshest.
00:04:49.598 - 00:04:52.814, Speaker B: David Hockney recognizes us in his approach, obviously.
00:04:52.854 - 00:05:03.462, Speaker C: But, yeah, so you get that contrast, you know, of this kind of very traditional Leonardo apex Renaissance painting with these.
00:05:03.638 - 00:05:07.078, Speaker B: Flat, digital, super crisp.
00:05:07.126 - 00:05:18.160, Speaker C: Like, it's a strong contrast. Right. And of course, contrast is where a lot of the gold is found in art. Right? So, yeah.
00:05:18.192 - 00:05:22.000, Speaker B: And then finally, actually, I started the.
00:05:22.032 - 00:05:49.504, Speaker C: Concept for this, where I was playing with digital brushstrokes and screen printing digital brushstrokes, which is sort of a play on Warhol a little bit, who would sort of have his graphic pencil and then he'd take a picture of the work of the graphite tracing, blow it up and then screen print seeds, rainbow colors. And so it's also about traveling through the mediums. This starts on a phone.
