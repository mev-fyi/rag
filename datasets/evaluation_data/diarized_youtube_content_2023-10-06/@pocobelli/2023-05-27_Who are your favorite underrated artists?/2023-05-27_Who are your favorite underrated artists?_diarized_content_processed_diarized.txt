00:00:10.440 - 00:00:55.444, Speaker A: It's one of the perennial challenges in the arts, the discovery of new talent. And we almost all start out there today we're crowdsourcing the search for artists that have remained in the shadows for too long, those that have eluded the spotlight despite their undeniable talent. Artist journal, May 24, 2023. Broadcasting live from Geisenfeld, just outside Munich in Bavaria and New York City on rug radio via Twitter spaces. My name is Adrian Pokebelli and we welcome back co host, artist and conversationalist to the show rune tune. How is your week going?
00:00:57.374 - 00:01:01.558, Speaker B: My week is going exceptional. It's good to be back here.
00:01:01.646 - 00:01:09.834, Speaker A: Well, it's always delightful to hear your voice. You make my job so much easier. Could you imagine me having to do this by myself?
00:01:11.174 - 00:01:13.374, Speaker B: Well, I'm sure you'd do just fine without me.
00:01:13.414 - 00:01:14.158, Speaker A: I'm not sure.
00:01:14.246 - 00:01:31.802, Speaker B: I'm not sure I'm more than happy to be here. You know, talking about under celebrated artists just by chance. I feel like I had my most looked at tweet this last week.
00:01:31.858 - 00:01:52.704, Speaker A: I mean, it's perfect. I mean, because you had like, to me, that was like, it felt like an order of magnitude kind of shift. It was like, as we say, you know, as we all are saying, you know, when you go on a new blockchain, it brings about a new kind of work. And I just adore that work that you posted the other day. Well, thank you. Yeah.
00:01:53.524 - 00:02:30.082, Speaker B: You know, I had no expectations and no idea that, and not to say that this is getting tons of views for someone like oxyn or strange thing, this would be a bum, bum, bum pose, but for someone, but for someone who has only like, you know, roughly 800 something followers, I mean, that's, you know, I'm looking at it now and it's got like five over 5000 views. And, you know, it's, it's these kinds of moments that are, that are very important for, for artists who are trying to make it in the space, you know, totally.
00:02:30.178 - 00:03:05.834, Speaker A: And it's really a tribute, I would say, you know, maybe semi controversially to twitter because I feel like if you put that out on Instagram, you're not necessarily going to get that same reach. But, and it's also 100%. And it's also a testament to this idea that even with, say, 800 followers, which is not bad, and every one of those, I'm sure, is like a real follower. And it's actually, I should mention, it's not super easy to find your account. I don't know if you have a setting, but I always have to put rune er tune. So it's not super easy. Just a heads up on that.
00:03:06.774 - 00:03:07.174, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:03:07.214 - 00:03:09.142, Speaker B: Unfortunately, someone took the rune.
00:03:09.198 - 00:03:22.804, Speaker A: Yeah. But you know, it's great. Like, it shows that it's about the work. Right. And like. So it's a real kind of fun sort of thing. So have you sold any yet? Actually, someone messaged me that they actually picked one up.
00:03:22.804 - 00:03:24.764, Speaker A: Oh, really?
00:03:25.104 - 00:03:28.240, Speaker B: I know that I sold one here. I'll have to look at it.
00:03:28.272 - 00:03:35.124, Speaker A: I think it was DJ Kiro who. Yep, he was the one. That's awesome. Yeah, that's awesome. How much time do we have?
00:03:38.384 - 00:03:39.224, Speaker B: It's up for a full.
00:03:39.264 - 00:03:40.244, Speaker A: Okay, awesome.
00:03:41.064 - 00:03:52.200, Speaker B: I went ahead and. Oh, it looks like someone else. Yeah, it looks like I sold a second one recently. Sometime within the last 24 hours.
00:03:52.312 - 00:04:29.094, Speaker A: Well, feel free to get the festivities started. Rune tune by posting your work. And that goes for anybody who is coming up here who wants to join the festivities here up on stage and consider. It's almost like an open mic night, except it's an open stage, we might say, for you to talk about artists that don't have necessarily the reach or that just you feel have been ignored, whether that's yourself or someone else. And I mean, I think so many of us have been there. I've spent most of my life in the shadows. So it's been.
00:04:29.094 - 00:04:38.294, Speaker A: This is the opportunity to kind of rectify those wrongs. And like, I speak as someone who's been there, is what I'm trying to say.
00:04:39.314 - 00:04:57.914, Speaker B: I think we've all been there. And also, I just want to say, instead of sharing my work, I wanted to share this work by Bernsewich or Elle Inquisitor, who I see is in the audience. I thought it kind of fit the vibe of the conversation. So that's what I shared to the spaces tab here.
00:04:57.954 - 00:05:05.038, Speaker A: That is awesome. And can you remind everybody, including me, on how to post a link on spaces? Yeah.
00:05:05.086 - 00:05:34.634, Speaker B: So, I mean, you'll have to do it from your phone. I know some people who might be operating from a computer, as some of us may already know, you can't speak on spaces unless it's from the phone, which I wish. I really wish that Twitter would figure out a way to make that not the case, because that kind of sucks. But anyways, to share it, you from the phone you have to go to. Here, let me see if I can.
00:05:35.174 - 00:05:36.030, Speaker A: I'll just.
00:05:36.182 - 00:05:53.806, Speaker B: There's. Under any sort of media or tweet or post there is on the furthest right side. This little arrow kind of like share it, share media. Whether you want to share it to text, share by email, and you'll be able to select share to the spaces that you're currently.
00:05:53.870 - 00:06:07.304, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So you kind of minimize the space and then you go to your post now, if you're correct. Oh, so, like. And if I go to a link, let's say on object, like, I don't need to find this link on Twitter, right?
00:06:08.564 - 00:06:14.924, Speaker B: Actually, I'm not really sure if that's true. Actually, I have not tried that. All I know is that I can share anything from Twitter.
00:06:14.964 - 00:06:15.704, Speaker A: Okay.
00:06:16.124 - 00:06:18.732, Speaker B: I'm not sure that I can share things outside of that.
00:06:18.788 - 00:06:46.000, Speaker A: Okay, that's an interesting. Maybe we'll do an experiment if we. If we dare today. So and so welcome, everybody. Just put a request in anybody that wants to join us on stage and we will be more than happy to bring you up here. And it. It's kind of, you know, and it's also important, like, like, as far as me say, doing this YouTube show, like, I just do what comes my way, as I described as, like a waterfall.
00:06:46.000 - 00:07:09.032, Speaker A: And I just kind of put my hand out and grab a few things. So. So I just think it's. Here's a nice way for other people to kind of share what they think because a lot of people feel that other stuff should be in there. I get messages all the time, in a sense. So feel free to take advantage of that. So, rune tune, why don't you get us started? Is there anybody, I mean, you posted that first link.
00:07:09.032 - 00:07:13.072, Speaker A: And what is the name of the artist? Burns the witch. Is that right?
00:07:13.208 - 00:07:18.664, Speaker B: Burns a witch is the Twitter handle. But they're in the audience. You'll see their profile. It's Ellen.
00:07:18.744 - 00:07:19.724, Speaker A: Okay, cool.
00:07:20.704 - 00:07:55.460, Speaker B: Who, if you want to come up to the stage and speak, by all means, please feel free. We'd love to hear from you. If not, I understand, but yeah, that's an artist that. I honestly have no idea how I came across their work, but I saw their work on object first and not on Twitter. And here, let me see if I can pull up the first work that I bought by them and share that to the spaces. But I saw this work. They had created a few other works.
00:07:55.460 - 00:08:09.452, Speaker B: It was a very simple drawing. I really enjoyed it at the time. It was cheap. It's no longer that cheap. And I decided to pull the trigger and buy it here. I'm going to share it to the space.
00:08:09.548 - 00:08:28.012, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. And look at everybody who showed up here. So far we have RJ. Great to see you, RJ. And again, feel free to come up on stage. RJ has an amazing Twitter feed where you see other artists and everybody. Josh Tornado has great idea.
00:08:28.012 - 00:08:37.544, Speaker A: Just great. I want to say taste and artists is what I'm trying not to say. Haiti rocket and everybody. So, again, feel free to join us up on stage and continue renting.
00:08:39.444 - 00:09:11.310, Speaker B: Yeah, so I came across this person's work and just really, really enjoyed it, and it's been good to see them kind of continue creating work. And, you know, a lot of times the reason that I buy work is just because I like the artwork. And for me, I'm not really in this space as a collector to make money. I know other people have different interests. I'm an artist. That's my focus. But in the meantime, I always like to support artists that I.
00:09:11.310 - 00:09:26.718, Speaker B: That I value, that I feel like I have sort of a connection with. If someone makes me laugh, I buy the work. It's kind of like humor's, I think, one of the easiest ways to get me interested here. I'm having a hard time.
00:09:26.766 - 00:09:51.928, Speaker A: All good. I'm looking at Lankwesitel right now, and what a great find I have just given l'enqueziteur burns the witch a follow. That last piece is fantastic here, this one of one. And again, it's like the antiques roadster show and totally undiscovered. Going for four tazos at auction. So that is. Yeah.
00:09:51.976 - 00:09:52.616, Speaker B: Okay, here we go.
00:09:52.640 - 00:09:57.640, Speaker A: Yeah, that is impressive. So this is great. There we go. This is the go ahead.
00:09:57.712 - 00:10:01.224, Speaker B: This is the one that I wanted to share. All right. There it is.
00:10:01.304 - 00:10:03.476, Speaker A: Yep. Yeah.
00:10:03.540 - 00:10:50.494, Speaker B: I really enjoy this artist. And what was I saying? Oh, one thing I was kind of saying is, like, you know, when I see artists, especially when they're kind of, when it seems like they're a little bit newer to object or they haven't posted a lot of work, for me, that's kind of like the okay call to action. Like, especially if it's priced right, if they're doing everything right, it seems to me like there's this kind of, like, artistic responsibility to go ahead and support it. And so that's what I like to do with any artist that has less than, like, let's say, five or six pages of work. And that's kind of my standpoint on the matter.
00:10:50.574 - 00:11:24.704, Speaker A: Yeah, I can totally relate where you just have this natural inclination to kind of champion their work when you see someone who you feel is kind of undeservedly, for lack of better term, ignored or passed over, shall we say. So here's a great artist, though, so l'inqquisiteur is one. And is there anything more you want to say? Is Linquisite. Do you want to come up before we try another artist here? Feel free to put a request in and we will bring you up.
00:11:24.824 - 00:11:41.984, Speaker B: And you know who I've also, for anyone who's not able to speak, I am going to keep. I'm operating on my computer and my phone, so if ever there's something you might want to say and you're not able to just dm myself or poco belly, I'm sure he has his messages open as well.
00:11:42.064 - 00:11:59.214, Speaker A: Beautifully put rune, too. And yes, I do. So yes, feel free to send me a message or whatnot. And we will read it up here as well. Do you know the artist circle, pronounced like S e r c h l e?
00:12:00.354 - 00:12:01.322, Speaker B: I don't know them.
00:12:01.378 - 00:12:42.526, Speaker A: So I wonder maybe I'll be able to find them on Twitter. But that is an artist who has been around for a long time, kind of has this, I almost want to pronounce it searchl and kind of has these kind of like parody pieces. They're very illustrative. Let me see if I can send this or if I can tweet this. Anyways, a very cool artist and I just kind of like has been around, you can tell for a long time on the Tezos platform. And for whatever reason, he kind of reminded me of RJ a little bit because RJ, not that long ago, seemed like he was tweeting and he'd barely get anything. And look at how well he's done.
00:12:42.526 - 00:13:31.440, Speaker A: And I feel like circle, circle, maybe pronounced, is one of those guys that just kind of has this kind of complete art that's ready to go, but just doesn't necessarily have the traction. Twitter can be quite difficult to make you navigate your way through when you're not getting any traction. And I have to say RJ was one of the most positive people I have seen because he would just keep posting. And I was really impressed because when I was watching him tweet a few weeks ago and shout out RJ out there in the audience, I was just really impressed at how he would just keep going and persist. And I think that's really paid off for him. Yeah.
00:13:31.552 - 00:13:33.640, Speaker B: Say again the name of the handle.
00:13:33.672 - 00:14:08.428, Speaker A: For oh, yeah, let me go. It is searchal Tez. I don't see a Twitter on. Let me see if I can just dig it up here as we speak. And so remember, if nobody says anything, you must forever hold your peace on whether the artists are being covered here adequately. Circle Tez is not even on Twitter. You know, at a certain point, maybe that's the reason circle's not doing that well.
00:14:08.428 - 00:14:34.134, Speaker A: I mean, and maybe they are doing well, but I think they could do fantastically. That's what I'm trying to say here. I think Circle does just fine and has their collectors and probably has a lot more followers than I might on object. But I wonder if they would be kind of, like, have some kind of star status, so to speak, if they were just. If they had the Twitter, they might not care, though. You know, like, a lot of people have moved on from Twitter.
00:14:36.674 - 00:15:49.884, Speaker B: That's kind of an interesting, you know, addition to this conversation is just, you know, sometimes I think that with, in the frustration of trying to find exposure and reach and stuff like that on. On these platforms, um, it's easy for people to kind of assume that the people who. Who have kind of found their audience, found their reach, found some success, are just lucky. You know, like, they're strong artists, but they just got lucky. And I kind of don't like that assumption that I feel like gets kind of tossed around with certain artists because, and I really liked this tweet from a strange thing the other day because he's been doing phenomenally well, but it was this threaded tweet, and there are all these comments, and he was kind of responding to some questions and stuff like that. And he kind of, like, you know, more or less like, kind of showed that he has a very good understanding of how the algorithm works on Instagram and how to work, you know, in favor of that algorithm. And so it's not like, strange things just out there.
00:15:49.884 - 00:15:52.636, Speaker B: And, you know, the success is finding him.
00:15:52.700 - 00:15:53.052, Speaker A: He's.
00:15:53.108 - 00:16:35.928, Speaker B: He's still having to put in a ton of work, make all these different Instagram posts, do all this work to kind of work with the algorithm and make that sort of stream of attention continue to pump. So I think it's important to keep in mind that, like, you know, sometimes that exposure and that reach, it really just comes down to, do you want to make this a full time job for yourself and really go after it and put the content out there and reach out? You know, I know that I'm. I'm not someone who has that time, unfortunately. So I can't really, like, take the social media side of things too seriously, but I do what I can.
00:16:36.016 - 00:17:27.886, Speaker A: I think you make a profoundly excellent point, Rune toon, because it shows with strange thing that there is that what I'd almost be tempted to call a hustler. Mentality that it does make a difference. And I'm so glad you mentioned this whole idea of do you want to do it as a full time job? Because I kind of feel like strange things oeuvre, so to speak. It could have easily have just been some really good AI artist on object and makes a thousand here, a thousand there, but never really went to that next level that he seems to be going to. And I think you're absolutely right that it's just, it's kind of like a. I think you nailed it. It's like, do you want to do this as a full time job? And it shows with strange thing that it's unambiguous.
00:17:27.886 - 00:17:58.404, Speaker A: He wants to be a star. And I think that's great and. Yeah, like, and I think that's the difference, you know, more power. Absolutely, absolutely. And, you know, it reminds me of, like, I actually was messaging with Justin Aversano before he blew up. Like, he was, I probably mentioned this before, but he was just sort of like, hey, we're early adopters, like, you know, and he was just, you know, fairly new, is 20. I guess that was 2020.
00:17:58.404 - 00:18:31.280, Speaker A: And, and what was so interesting about him, it was when Clubhouse had just started and he was in every clubhouse on NFts that you could find. And he hustled. He really hustled. And he was from New York City. And you could tell that it's almost like, it seemed like he needed to win because if he didn't win and get something, it was almost like, it's like, it's almost like he had burnt his bridge, so to speak, and he had to make it. And he did. And boy, did he make it.
00:18:31.280 - 00:18:42.604, Speaker A: So again, it's back to that. Like, we always think of success as being kind of far away. Sometimes it's only like a few millimeters away, and we just are assuming it's far away.
00:18:43.864 - 00:19:28.098, Speaker B: You know, that's a very good point. And I think, you know, some of us, probably, myself included, wouldn't really know what to do with this success once we got there, you know, and you kind of have to. Early on, I think it's important for artists to sit down, reflect, and really make a decision about what success looks like to them. And, like, what, you know, you have to come up with your own definition of success. And it's the topic that you wanted to share today is kind of, it's a complex idea for us to be saying what is underrated or under celebrated because that might look different to a lot of different people.
00:19:28.186 - 00:19:53.966, Speaker A: Absolutely. Yeah. I was wondering. I was actually surprised there was zero controversy on the tweet because I thought, oh, maybe. Exactly what does that mean? Right? Under celebrated. Underrated. Like, who's to say? Right? But I guess it, from my point of view, it just sort of came from, you know, I've lived in the shadows, so to speak, for a long time as an artist.
00:19:53.966 - 00:20:38.662, Speaker A: And so I. Yeah, like, and so. And, you know, and that's why I'd say, like, if anybody feels like their own work, they want to highlight here, the stage is open, and I was actually hoping more people would want to share artists, but I can share another one and again, and just put a request to speak whoever has an artist that they feel it doesn't even need to be quote unquote underrated, but just someone who you think could use a little more spotlight, you know, however you want to phrase it. Another great one that I like is Jasmine Varela. Let me see if I can. It's J a z m I n. Varela on object.
00:20:38.662 - 00:21:00.384, Speaker A: Let me see if she is on Twitter here. So this is someone and rune tune I'm going to send you. Yeah. So here she is in sloth, actually. And. Yeah, here is. It almost kind of goes somewhat well with your work here.
00:21:00.384 - 00:21:11.080, Speaker A: Runtoon some of it at the. Here we go. Okay, I'm gonna run tune. If I send you a link. Actually, yeah. Could I send you a link?
00:21:11.152 - 00:21:19.528, Speaker B: You know, it's funny, I actually. I know exactly who. Who that artist is. I've collected several of Jasmine's works.
00:21:19.576 - 00:21:45.282, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Yeah. Like, I mean, so she does, like, what looks to me, and if you have a different idea, let me know. It looks to me like she does these physical works, but then she turns them into these gifs, and it's kind of like this very broken, animated kind of gif. Like, it's not a smooth. Like, it's more like a comic panel. Like a series of eight comic panels that have been turned into a gif.
00:21:45.282 - 00:21:51.098, Speaker A: Is that your understanding of Jasmine's work? Yeah.
00:21:51.146 - 00:22:13.304, Speaker B: And as I recall, I think she's a tattoo artist by trade. And when I first started collecting a few of her works, as I recall, it didn't look like she had been too active for some time. That may have changed. I'll have to actually take a look at her object profile and see if that's anything.
00:22:13.344 - 00:22:28.484, Speaker A: It does seem a little quiet to your point. Yeah. And here's the work. I love this work. The one with the still life with the Superman and the choose your own adventures. Do you know that one? I'm going to see if I can figure out how to do this here.
00:22:28.904 - 00:23:00.520, Speaker B: And she also did this really wonderful series on the Zodiac. And it's really, really funny stuff. I bought the one on cancer because I'm a cancer. And it's just hilarious. It is absolutely hilarious. It's like these synchronized swimmers and they're all, you know, kind of like doing their thing and then one of them gets kneed in the mouth and they're bleeding and it turns into this big mess. I really wish that Jasmine was a little more.
00:23:00.520 - 00:23:16.586, Speaker B: I think I even messaged her or maybe commented or something because I wanted to kind of catch some, some words from, from the artist, but I don't think I was ever successful in getting that. Here, let me, let me share the, the work that you just shared.
00:23:16.610 - 00:23:28.654, Speaker A: Oh, thank you. I totally appreciate it. And I'm very pleased to welcome Tornado and little cakes onto the stage. Tornado, why don't you start us off here? Where are you calling from? Are you in Argentina still?
00:23:29.714 - 00:23:32.146, Speaker D: Hi, how are you? Pogobelli. How are you?
00:23:32.210 - 00:23:32.906, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:23:33.090 - 00:23:34.338, Speaker D: So nice to be here.
00:23:34.426 - 00:23:34.802, Speaker A: Awesome.
00:23:34.858 - 00:23:36.874, Speaker D: Yes, I'm calling from Argentina.
00:23:37.034 - 00:23:37.690, Speaker E: As always.
00:23:37.802 - 00:23:40.154, Speaker A: It's so great to hear your voice, Tornado.
00:23:40.314 - 00:23:41.434, Speaker E: Oh, thanks.
00:23:41.554 - 00:24:00.666, Speaker A: And it's always great to hear from you. So. Okay, so let's get into it here. I'm sure you probably have like a list, like ten artists long here. I mean, but anyways, who do you think, and if you have any thoughts on what we've been saying in general about the hustle and everything. Yeah. So just share your thoughts here.
00:24:00.666 - 00:24:04.934, Speaker A: Do you have an artist you want to share or any thoughts on what we're discussing here?
00:24:06.534 - 00:24:23.614, Speaker D: Yes, I have some thoughts about what you were discussing. I want to say that Jasmine Barela. Jasmine Barela is an argentinian artist, a really famous argentinian artist here in Argentina. She's like a pillar of illustration.
00:24:23.774 - 00:24:27.234, Speaker A: Oh, really? She seems like a professional to me.
00:24:28.054 - 00:24:31.342, Speaker D: Yes, she's okay. So she's the real deal.
00:24:31.438 - 00:24:35.614, Speaker A: She's. No, she's not obscure then. Only in my world.
00:24:36.714 - 00:24:48.458, Speaker D: No, in the, in the nfTs, she's like, today she's not active. I think in, in some weeks she, she will be like, coming back.
00:24:48.546 - 00:24:49.034, Speaker A: Oh, cool.
00:24:49.074 - 00:24:51.842, Speaker D: That's all I know. But, yes.
00:24:51.898 - 00:24:52.882, Speaker B: Well, Tornado.
00:24:52.978 - 00:24:53.466, Speaker D: Yeah.
00:24:53.570 - 00:25:00.414, Speaker B: If you know, if you know, you gotta let them know that there's probably a very ripe audience.
00:25:02.944 - 00:25:15.728, Speaker D: I do that, you know, I take the time to say that, but I don't know, she needed some time off and I think that's okay. I get it totally.
00:25:15.816 - 00:25:36.366, Speaker A: Yeah. The NFT space and the whole, even just the Twitter experience can be. Can turn into a. It can consume a lot of your time. You know, it can consume a lot of your imagination and everything. It's always a challenge, actually, because it's kind of interesting. I mean, like, we were just discussing how, you know, strange thing and Justin Aversano, how.
00:25:36.366 - 00:25:59.854, Speaker A: How they do reach success by really, you know, hitting it hard as well as Instagram and whatever else. But, yeah, at the same time, it's a real decision you got to make at a certain point. I mean, how about for yourself? Tornado. I mean, how do you approach, how much, like, do you put out a work a day? Like, even if it's old work on Twitter or how often do you post your work?
00:25:59.974 - 00:26:02.910, Speaker D: Yeah, my work all day.
00:26:02.942 - 00:26:03.574, Speaker A: Oh, you do?
00:26:03.654 - 00:26:07.638, Speaker D: I am all the time. Yes. I'm. No, like a drop?
00:26:07.686 - 00:26:13.394, Speaker A: No, no. Like, just, like, here's, you know, just posting a work. It could be two years old, five years old.
00:26:13.694 - 00:26:43.742, Speaker D: Yeah, I do that every day. Well, yes, I do that every day. I take the time to be on Twitter every day. I try to speak with people every day. I really like this vibe you see in, like, before nfts, I was drawing, I was illustrating, but I was. I wasn't, like, I don't know, I wasn't getting, like, any feedback or I wasn't finding a place. And here I find it.
00:26:43.742 - 00:26:49.150, Speaker D: So I take the time to do it every day. I'm full time nfts now.
00:26:49.262 - 00:27:22.666, Speaker A: That is awesome. And, yeah, to your point, it's so easy to take it for granted that there's other people that just want to see your. That are connected to your work somehow, even if it's just scrolling past you on Twitter, you know, because as. As artists, I mean, a lot of us, you know, we're doing physical art with almost zero, like, what a. The dedication that. That requires that most of the people in this audience have done where you're working in a room where nobody is paying attention to you and nobody is seeing your work. Right.
00:27:22.666 - 00:27:32.894, Speaker A: I mean, so this is a real godsend, as we've said many times here, to have this connection where other people can see, comment, retweet, you know, buy your work.
00:27:34.994 - 00:27:55.590, Speaker D: Yeah, it's totally different for me. Before this, there was, like, Instagram or Tumblr, and now is where I'm getting to know people and my work is being seen. So I'm enjoying. I'm really enjoying nfts a lot.
00:27:55.662 - 00:28:30.314, Speaker A: I totally sympathize with you. And again, I look at Rune Thun's story here, where he puts out a really next level work and he gets rewarded for it. You really can't ask even again, five years ago, you do that in your studio, you don't get any feedback. You're not even sure. We're almost the worst judges of our own work at the end of the day. So anyway, so before we move on to little cakes tornado, name some artists for us. I mean, you again have just such a.
00:28:30.314 - 00:28:44.774, Speaker A: I feel like you have a really deep understanding from our brief communications of artists out there. Maybe tell us a little bit more about Yasmeen and any other artists that you feel could use a little more attention.
00:28:47.054 - 00:29:09.594, Speaker D: Well, about Jahmin. For me, she is, like, truly a pillar of illustration in Argentina. Like, for real. Jasmine, Maria Victoria Rodriguez. I don't know if you heard about Maria Victoria. I think you may have heard her, but. Because.
00:29:09.594 - 00:29:25.198, Speaker D: Yeah, but when I say it, like, in Spanish, I think you maybe don't get who she is. But Maria Victoria now lives in Berlin.
00:29:25.286 - 00:29:26.234, Speaker A: Oh, Berlin.
00:29:26.574 - 00:29:31.794, Speaker D: But, yeah, yeah, she lives in Berlin. She's amazed.
00:29:32.774 - 00:29:35.902, Speaker A: And is she a friend of yours or is she an artist that you really like?
00:29:35.998 - 00:29:36.278, Speaker D: Yes.
00:29:36.326 - 00:29:39.034, Speaker A: What's the. Why do you bring her up?
00:29:40.254 - 00:29:49.886, Speaker D: Because she's also an argentinian and her and Jamin in Argentina were, like, the famous ones.
00:29:49.950 - 00:29:51.154, Speaker A: They are famous.
00:29:52.294 - 00:30:15.322, Speaker D: Yeah, yeah. In the illustration community. Yes, they are. Because they have been working in illustration for a long time, doing a lot of work, have a lot of followers in Instagram all the time, like, doing. Doing, like, workshops. And so they are like, big names here in Australia.
00:30:15.378 - 00:30:22.974, Speaker A: That is so funny. I mean, it just goes to show that there are so many people that you don't know about because for me, I was like, oh, here's a good obscure artist.
00:30:26.514 - 00:30:38.314, Speaker D: Well, no, she's been doing this, like, for a long time. I think she has done works for Adidas and big branding.
00:30:38.434 - 00:30:47.042, Speaker A: Yeah, here's like this guy who's, like, barely known apart from a small Twitter saying, hey, I found someone who's obscure. Anyways, the irony is, well, you know.
00:30:47.058 - 00:30:48.490, Speaker B: It'S easy to do that, though.
00:30:48.562 - 00:31:19.474, Speaker A: Well, totally. I mean, there's so many artists out there, right? I mean, and this is kind of part of what this show is about, in a sense, is discoverability and just discovering new artists. It is the big challenge, whether it's music or, you know, visual art or you name it. It's really, you know, it's not that easy, in a sense, to find these things. I mean, I kind of happened to bring it up here. So we're talking about her. So it almost shows that, you know, being obscure or famous is almost a relative term.
00:31:19.474 - 00:31:22.854, Speaker A: Relative to which? Community. Right.
00:31:24.314 - 00:31:37.980, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it doesn't mean anything when you enter the NFTs. For some people, it means. But it really doesn't mean, like, you have to start over. That's a good thing.
00:31:38.172 - 00:32:18.534, Speaker A: I agree. I agree. And we saw that in 2021 during the big bull run, when a lot of, quote, unquote, famous artists from the contemporary art scene just kind of got very little traction on Twitter and. Yeah. And then I had friends who had gallery, you know, galleries that represented them, and they were, like, messaging me, like, how do I do this? Because they saw all the money that was being made, and I have no problem with that. But they found it really hard to get traction, and it's really hard to parachute in and be successful, in a sense, in this scene, I think you really have to spend some time. You kind of got to earn it to a certain degree.
00:32:20.514 - 00:32:36.270, Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's that way. When I started here, then Khmeen and Maria Victoria started, and I was teaching them how to do things, for me was like, what? These are, like, my idols. What is happening?
00:32:36.462 - 00:32:37.794, Speaker A: That was so cool.
00:32:38.974 - 00:32:57.782, Speaker D: It was really amazing. So I'm waiting for them to come back. I think they will be coming back here. I think Maria Victoria is doing, like, some things, but I'm really waiting for. For Hameen. I wanna. I wanna see what she's doing.
00:32:57.782 - 00:33:16.754, Speaker D: Because Jasmine is always, like, reinventing, you know? For example, Runtun said she's a tattoo artist. Well, she's not. Then she started, like, tattooing and became good, but she was already, like, a big, big illustrator.
00:33:17.094 - 00:33:20.154, Speaker B: So she no longer. She no longer does tattoos?
00:33:20.664 - 00:33:31.964, Speaker D: Yeah, I think she does. But it was something that came up on the way, you know, she was already doing drawings and doing big brands and doing a lot of work.
00:33:33.584 - 00:33:36.096, Speaker A: Okay, excellent. So do you have any other artists?
00:33:36.200 - 00:33:37.120, Speaker D: So before.
00:33:37.232 - 00:33:42.964, Speaker A: Before we move on to little cakes and please stay on stage, because we may need your help here. Yes, I will.
00:33:43.344 - 00:33:44.204, Speaker E: Okay.
00:33:45.784 - 00:33:57.224, Speaker D: I have, like, a artist, like, I'm obsessed with. I don't know why I didn't find out about this artist before. It's called bored me social club.
00:33:57.344 - 00:33:59.404, Speaker A: Sure. You mentioned them the last time.
00:34:02.224 - 00:34:08.440, Speaker D: Yeah. I love. I love. I think it's amazing. I don't know. It's catchy. I like it.
00:34:08.440 - 00:34:22.526, Speaker D: I like the palette. I like the characters. I'm all about the characters and the objects and all that. And every time I see it. It's, like, fresh. I love it. And the other day, I don't know, bored me.
00:34:22.526 - 00:34:32.422, Speaker D: Social club did a open edition at one test, and I was like, come on, go, go collect this. It's amazing. What are you doing?
00:34:32.518 - 00:34:36.394, Speaker A: I'm looking at it right now. Uncomfortable body. Is that the one?
00:34:37.614 - 00:34:40.894, Speaker D: Yes, that's the one. I think it's amazing.
00:34:40.934 - 00:35:02.994, Speaker A: Very cool artist and kind of very surreal. And it's almost like your work is quite illustrative. But I could almost see them hanging. Maybe not in the same room, but maybe in the same building or something, or a show on kind of. I don't know. Did you find your work relates at all to board me, social club? Or do you find it quite different?
00:35:04.974 - 00:35:22.272, Speaker D: I find it, like, in one way it's relatable. You see, I always like what I do. I think it's, like, bad. But I don't find, like, I don't feel attracted to something that is totally different of what I do.
00:35:22.368 - 00:35:22.864, Speaker A: Right.
00:35:22.984 - 00:35:39.504, Speaker D: Because I get attraction to something that, I don't know, vibes with me. Something that makes me think about what can I do better or different? So, yeah, I think we have, like, something there.
00:35:40.044 - 00:36:04.744, Speaker A: Absolutely. And, yeah, I mean, I think it makes perfect sense. Whatever's exciting you in your work, it makes perfect sense that you'd be excited about someone else doing kind of similar or just analogous things in their work. Or work that reminds you of what you're excited about. So are there any other artists that you'd like to mention before we go to little cakes?
00:36:06.694 - 00:36:17.646, Speaker B: Keep in mind, everybody, that there's some people who can't speak right now. So there's a lot of names being dropped in the comments. I shared Mechdoct's comments in our spaces.
00:36:17.710 - 00:36:32.484, Speaker A: Oh, excellent. Thank you. And actually, there was. We did hear from a couple of. Quite a few artists here. Thank you, Runetune, for showing human boy mention and Lankwizzy tail. I can't speak at the moment.
00:36:32.484 - 00:36:39.700, Speaker A: I can just listen. Thanks for the light on me. You're more than welcome. Langquasite. Bernsee. Witch. Sorry, tornado.
00:36:39.700 - 00:36:41.864, Speaker A: Any other artists you'd like to mention?
00:36:45.204 - 00:37:06.872, Speaker D: Sorry. Yes, I would like to give a shout out to La Delmas, who dropped yesterday on object and hasn't been around for a long time. And I know speak for from all Argentinians. We were missing her. So I think you should check out Ladell.
00:37:07.048 - 00:37:21.560, Speaker A: How do you spell that? L a l a g E l e l. Yeah. M A S. La Delmas. Okay, very cool.
00:37:21.592 - 00:37:25.004, Speaker D: I found it another pilar argentinian illustration.
00:37:25.414 - 00:37:31.758, Speaker A: Very cool. I love the McDonald's piece here. Is that new? Yeah, that just came out like yesterday.
00:37:31.926 - 00:37:32.254, Speaker D: Yes.
00:37:32.294 - 00:37:43.274, Speaker A: Wow. And already at 975 tez on secondary. That is a very nice piece. Yeah. Okay. This is great. So new discoveries being made here all the time.
00:37:45.854 - 00:37:46.622, Speaker D: Happy to help.
00:37:46.678 - 00:37:54.794, Speaker A: Yeah, you're doing awesome here. You're doing awesome. Okay, let's turn to little cakes and. And little cakes. How are you doing? Where are you calling from?
00:37:55.774 - 00:38:04.294, Speaker F: Hi. Thanks for letting me talk for a little bit. I'm in New York state, a little bit away from the city.
00:38:04.374 - 00:38:10.674, Speaker A: Awesome. Yeah. Well, it's my pleasure, little cakes. And you sound just like your AI generated song from the other day.
00:38:13.934 - 00:38:35.544, Speaker F: So I just wanted to, I guess, suggest one of my favorite artists to collect that. I. Whenever they drop something, like lately, I'm always going, I don't have enough tasks for it, but it's moshit. M o e s h I t.
00:38:37.124 - 00:38:42.308, Speaker B: There someone in the comments was sharing that name as well.
00:38:42.476 - 00:38:43.072, Speaker C: Yeah.
00:38:43.188 - 00:38:44.168, Speaker B: Dead Maryland.
00:38:44.336 - 00:38:45.016, Speaker A: Very cool.
00:38:45.120 - 00:38:47.124, Speaker B: Highlight that artist.
00:38:47.784 - 00:39:44.674, Speaker F: They're an artist from Turkey, and they make, like, cute but ironic and sort of angry, naive work. And sometimes it's pixels, and sometimes it's like digital drawing. I've also seen some pencil drawings that are really amazing. And they're also a musician. They have music that's up on Spotify and YouTube and stuff that I've heard before that is just really cool in the sort of punk folk maybe underground kind of way. And I don't know, like, they just. The whole world that they have, like, the mo shit world is just really, like, awesome.
00:39:44.674 - 00:39:51.750, Speaker F: And so I just wanted to suggest that people follow them and check them out.
00:39:51.782 - 00:40:02.154, Speaker A: Well, and, I mean, I almost don't even want to say it, but they have a whole bunch of. One of ones here and there. A lot are not sold. They are cheap. Like nine tazos, ten tezos.
00:40:02.674 - 00:40:03.266, Speaker F: I want.
00:40:03.330 - 00:40:24.214, Speaker A: I know this is like, I'm like, where's my tez wallet? Do I have any tez in my wallet? Great. And now is Moe s h I t. Are they someone you discovered recently? Because I. Or have you known about them for a while? Because I just started coming across their work. Like, I'd say in the last couple of weeks.
00:40:25.194 - 00:40:34.966, Speaker F: I've known about them for a while. Like, I don't. But I'm assuming since last year, maybe. I can't remember now. Like, the time sort of flies by, so.
00:40:35.030 - 00:40:39.494, Speaker A: Well, that's for sure. And they have 24 pages of work here, so clearly.
00:40:39.574 - 00:40:56.314, Speaker F: Yeah, they're so prolific. And so, I don't know, like, you guys were talking about how people are either going for it or not going for it. And I feel like Mo's been really trying to push it lately and, like, doing an awesome job, so.
00:40:56.454 - 00:41:05.322, Speaker A: Well, I love this. Right. And you know what I love about what Mo's doing? She's. Is it a. Do you know if it's a man or a woman or.
00:41:05.498 - 00:41:22.994, Speaker F: So I remember. I just. The reason why I said they was just because the. In one post somewhere, like, somebody said he, and then Mo said maybe not. So I wasn't sure. So I don't know if I should be saying he or.
00:41:23.034 - 00:41:24.650, Speaker A: I guess we say, well, one thing.
00:41:24.722 - 00:41:25.650, Speaker F: Pronouns are so weird.
00:41:25.682 - 00:41:25.826, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:41:25.850 - 00:41:29.002, Speaker B: I guess one thing I've been doing is just using day for.
00:41:29.058 - 00:41:49.586, Speaker A: Yeah, that's the safe way to do it and the easy route here. And, you know, I also think of Mo Tucker from the velvet underground, the drummer who is a woman. And so. Yeah, so, mo. Yeah. So anyways, let's go with they. But what I love about what they're doing is they're not slowing down.
00:41:49.586 - 00:42:16.822, Speaker A: They're not worrying about sales too much. You know what I mean? And then I think it's really wise. Like, I think it, because I think it's easy to get into a mode where you say, oh, I'm not making any sales, so I'm not going to worry about posting anything, you know, et cetera, et cetera. But then all of a sudden, there's, you know, a space, and maybe 50 people are listening in, maybe more. And also everybody's like, oh, look at all the one of ones. And all of a sudden, 50 people are listening. And also your page could be, you know, cleared out within a day.
00:42:16.822 - 00:42:31.814, Speaker A: So I like how mo is not overly, you know, doesn't seem to be slowing down according to sales. I mean, Francois Gamma is another artist that does. That doesn't worry about, you know, just keeps, you know, grinding it out.
00:42:32.234 - 00:42:35.210, Speaker F: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
00:42:35.282 - 00:42:39.934, Speaker A: So, so that's great. So that's a great one. Do you have any others? Little cakes.
00:42:40.954 - 00:42:50.610, Speaker F: That's the only one. That sort of was just, like, on the tip of my tongue that I really, really, like, wanted to take the time to, like, call in about.
00:42:50.682 - 00:43:15.804, Speaker A: Well, I'm glad you did. And again, if anybody wants to join us on stage, you're more than welcome to just put a request to speak, and we will bring you up. If you feel that there is someone out there who is a little too, you know, far in the shadows who could use a little spotlight of just a few people here listening in and learning about them. This is a good opportunity to do that. Continue.
00:43:16.904 - 00:43:35.336, Speaker F: There is one more. So they're friends with Mo and, gosh, I'm trying to remember the handle. It's kutu cola, I think. Let me see if I can find it. Feel like I. Yeah, it's Kutukola.
00:43:35.400 - 00:43:52.338, Speaker A: Oh, I know who you're. Are you sure? Is it a q or is it a k at the start? Q. K. Yeah, I think I know exactly who you're talking about. You know who that reminds me of that artist. And actually, how I discovered them is through Turkirak. Do you know?
00:43:52.426 - 00:43:52.922, Speaker F: Yes.
00:43:53.018 - 00:43:55.290, Speaker A: Turkirak. Loved it.
00:43:55.442 - 00:43:57.154, Speaker F: They're all Turkish, I think.
00:43:57.234 - 00:44:15.934, Speaker A: Oh, interesting. I mean, half the artists in this scene seem to be from Argentina and Turkey, so this is great. Yeah. So kudu kola. That is a great one. And there again, a one of one for six tezos is the latest drop there today. And it's a pretty cool work.
00:44:17.184 - 00:44:36.284, Speaker F: They've been making more detailed work, I think, because in the beginning, at least, the first few that I saw of theirs was a little bit more simple and the last few have been really sort of more detailed.
00:44:37.264 - 00:45:01.684, Speaker A: It is tempting to say it's evolved from where I saw it because I haven't checked in with Cuda Cola for maybe a couple of months. And, yeah, it really does seem to be going somewhere. It's kind of back to that idea. If you're just putting out a work every day or two, it can really go somewhere. It's fun to see this evolution here and. Yeah, daily day. Another.
00:45:01.684 - 00:45:03.004, Speaker A: Go ahead.
00:45:03.904 - 00:45:26.744, Speaker B: I like what you said, too. Poco belly talking. I think we were talking about Mo, but how certain artists, you know, the prolificness really does. It does attract an audience, I think. But especially when you refuse to slow down despite sales, I think that that, for me, is a mark of a true artist.
00:45:26.824 - 00:45:53.036, Speaker A: I agree. It shows conviction. And you know what? There's almost an irony there because, I mean, as you're saying that, I'm just thinking, like, if I put on my collector hat, I like to see that. Right? Like, I like to see when someone just doesn't care about the. Isn't overly concerned, let's put it that way, about the sales and is just going to keep putting out their work. That kind of makes you want to collect them more and take a second, third and a fourth look. Right.
00:45:53.036 - 00:45:53.940, Speaker A: If they keep doing that.
00:45:53.972 - 00:45:55.148, Speaker B: 100%. I agree.
00:45:55.196 - 00:46:06.640, Speaker A: So there's an interesting lesson there for all of us in that we have a request. Thank you, little cakes. And by all means, stay on stage. Little cakes, I adore your voice.
00:46:06.712 - 00:46:07.456, Speaker F: Thanks so much.
00:46:07.560 - 00:46:10.928, Speaker A: You have a beautiful voice, little cakes, just so you know.
00:46:11.016 - 00:46:11.672, Speaker E: Have a good day.
00:46:11.728 - 00:46:26.444, Speaker A: Yeah, you too. PP, I am bringing you up on stage. Thank you for the request. And we are connecting here. Let's see if PP can connect. PP, welcome to the show. Where are you calling from?
00:46:31.284 - 00:46:31.908, Speaker C: Calling.
00:46:31.996 - 00:46:38.504, Speaker A: Oh, that is hilarious. I love it. I'm doing welcome. Wonderful. Drinking a lot of beer in Bavaria.
00:46:39.164 - 00:47:06.268, Speaker C: All right, nice. No, I just wanted to talk about one artist that I think that needs loads more of exposure because I don't know, I think I call it combo NFt. When you some description, some story on the NFT. I like when they do that. And his name is Pomelo. Nitro. Nft.
00:47:06.268 - 00:47:07.184, Speaker C: Pomelo.
00:47:08.724 - 00:47:10.584, Speaker A: So if I put in nitro.
00:47:11.284 - 00:47:15.504, Speaker C: Nitro. NFT. Pomelo. That's, that's his handle.
00:47:17.604 - 00:47:18.504, Speaker A: Pomelo.
00:47:19.044 - 00:47:20.292, Speaker C: Yeah. Pomelo.
00:47:20.428 - 00:47:20.892, Speaker A: Found it.
00:47:20.908 - 00:47:27.620, Speaker C: He's another artist from Argentina. I saw it. Sorry, guys. You know what?
00:47:27.732 - 00:47:42.024, Speaker A: Like european and north american artists have had the spotlight for a very long time. So if we have too many artists from Argentina or turkey, that is more than fine and it is more than overdue. So that is more than welcome here.
00:47:42.644 - 00:48:02.794, Speaker C: All right, nice. Well, it was that I think that I like het because he do like animated gif also. And I like that he tries to tell a story in each. Nft he do. And I know that he's playing hard and I would like him to do better.
00:48:03.294 - 00:48:29.972, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And it looks like he, you know, and I think it's really smart what he's doing selling for $0.50 here and he is making sales and like from walk, you know, woc not a number Louie, yet. So this person, Lepro chant. This person seems like they're well on their way. Walk even bought two pieces because maybe there is some money to be made here with walk.
00:48:29.972 - 00:48:33.636, Speaker A: Pretty cool artists. I've never seen their work before and.
00:48:33.700 - 00:49:12.122, Speaker C: I think so, yeah. I think that what you're saying is right. And you named one that I wanted to know to name also that le pro chant. I like what he do also. And they are both from Argentina. I will meet them because I talk with him and with them and I probably meet them one day here and I will know them better. I think that obviously I have more artists, but nowadays now I am a bit confused because I am multitasking.
00:49:12.122 - 00:49:23.742, Speaker C: I am doing my own art. I'm listening to podcasts my mind is everywhere now. So it's something to tell about this.
00:49:23.798 - 00:49:30.822, Speaker A: Yeah, yeah. Do you listen to like podcasts and whatever when you make art? Is that what you're saying?
00:49:30.878 - 00:49:56.446, Speaker C: Yeah, but I, I am a science guy. I love science and I used to listen to like a very, very profound science podcast all the time. All the time. I like, like Friedman, you know, I don't know how to say I love science, so I always try to do my art listening to science podcasts. Yeah.
00:49:56.550 - 00:50:00.390, Speaker A: And do you have a favorite science podcast that you could recommend for us?
00:50:00.422 - 00:50:04.950, Speaker C: Well, there's a guy that is called Lex Friedman. I don't know if you know.
00:50:04.982 - 00:50:07.794, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, of course. I think, yeah. Very famous podcast.
00:50:08.094 - 00:50:53.384, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. And I like him because you can tell that he studied before the podcast, you know, the guy who's going to interview. So I think that is very interesting. And he's also a scientist, so I don't know, I like how they make it a bit clearer for the audience, like me, that I am not a science scientist. So I obviously I don't understand everything that what they talk about, but I take from the podcast loads and loads from of concepts and loads of time. I use them concepts to do my art or to do my title for a piece I'm doing. I don't know.
00:50:53.384 - 00:50:55.716, Speaker C: It's good. I like it.
00:50:55.900 - 00:51:02.824, Speaker A: Well, I like your art. PP, I'm looking at it now. It's PP universal, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
00:51:02.904 - 00:51:22.024, Speaker C: Yeah. I'm happy with it. It's my job, actually. I try to make it my job. So sometimes I think I upload a lot of things, but I don't know, sometimes I'm creative and sometimes on a rush and sometimes not. Yeah.
00:51:22.184 - 00:51:40.396, Speaker A: And so the only man who can be called Dracula, it says that this is at the bottom art and prompt by me, short novel by chat GPT. So it almost looks like a physical work, though. Could you explain a little bit? Go ahead.
00:51:40.460 - 00:51:56.664, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah. It's a physical work. I do both. I do digital and physical. It's a painting I did on a canvas. I found a canvas in the street and I take it home and I paint it over on black. And then I did this painting of.
00:51:56.664 - 00:52:00.744, Speaker C: So I actually have the painting, it's now in my wall.
00:52:02.044 - 00:52:18.704, Speaker A: I think the color, and there's just something about it. It almost reminds me of those. What is the name of that cult film director? I think he was out of Brazil. He had like the magician's hat and he had these outrageous movies. Do you know who I'm talking about.
00:52:19.964 - 00:52:23.964, Speaker C: I'm not sure. No, it's a movie about Dracula or.
00:52:24.004 - 00:52:42.184, Speaker A: Nothing to do with it, kind of horror would be his subject, but they were like, I think it's some of the most outrageous movies I've ever seen. Maybe I can find them. So anyways, but not off the top of your head. Yeah, but anyways, I love the look and feel of it. Very cool.
00:52:42.264 - 00:53:07.714, Speaker C: Yeah. The reference I took is the Nicolas Cage movie of Dracula. So if I show you the picture where I start drawing, it's very funny. I like that because I always start with, like, a reference and then the result is like, 100% different from the reference. And I like that. Perfect things, you know? Yeah, I love it.
00:53:07.834 - 00:53:11.858, Speaker A: Yeah, well, keep it up and keep us updated. PP.
00:53:11.946 - 00:53:21.792, Speaker C: Yeah, yeah, I keep you. Sometimes I feel I am a bit annoying because I upload a lot of things, but, uh, I also like that, so I don't care.
00:53:21.848 - 00:53:29.032, Speaker A: Also PP. You can hang out here anytime you want. Just come by. We're here every week. Come join the conversation.
00:53:29.128 - 00:53:46.300, Speaker C: Yeah, I just see the space and the title and I like it and I say, okay, I'm going in, going in. So, yeah, it's perfect. I'm. I'm going to go on listening to you and let others speak. So thanks, have a nice day and.
00:53:46.332 - 00:53:52.064, Speaker A: Great to hear from Argentina. I almost feel like we need to do an Argentina jam session in one of these.
00:53:53.284 - 00:53:55.132, Speaker C: Yeah, we are all over the place.
00:53:55.308 - 00:54:04.664, Speaker A: Absolutely. Martin. Joe, great to see you here up on stage and I'm sure it's going to be an awesome recommendation. Remind us, where are you calling from?
00:54:06.924 - 00:54:08.300, Speaker C: Hi, guys. How you doing?
00:54:08.412 - 00:54:14.484, Speaker A: Good. It's great to hear your. I feel like I'm you at the bar after not hanging out for three weeks or something.
00:54:17.504 - 00:54:21.768, Speaker C: Nice, nice. I'm from Argentina.
00:54:21.856 - 00:54:32.964, Speaker A: Oh, right, right. Of course you are. Of course. It is an Argentina jam session over here. Yeah. Yes. So how are things going? Do you have any artists for us?
00:54:35.424 - 00:54:48.604, Speaker C: Yeah, first I want to let you know I just drop it and in object, you can see it on my pin tweet if you want. I will appreciate if you share it.
00:54:48.684 - 00:54:52.464, Speaker A: Absolutely. And yeah, go ahead, go ahead.
00:54:53.884 - 00:55:06.004, Speaker C: I want to highlight my friend Bestie, Amor Lunar. And she's in college, artist and.
00:55:06.084 - 00:55:10.060, Speaker A: Sorry, if you're able to share a.
00:55:10.092 - 00:55:14.064, Speaker B: Work or share the handle, uh, something for us to click and find.
00:55:14.924 - 00:55:39.654, Speaker A: Yeah. And. And how do you spell it again? Amor. Amor al u n or inailu. Oh, yeah, amor lunar. Got it. Like moon.
00:55:39.654 - 00:55:53.394, Speaker A: Love. Amor lunar. Interesting artist here, graphic designer and collage artist. Artiste. Very interesting. So how did you find Amour's work?
00:55:55.454 - 00:55:59.504, Speaker C: She's a friend of mine since a lot of time.
00:55:59.584 - 00:56:00.440, Speaker A: Oh, that's great.
00:56:00.552 - 00:56:01.964, Speaker C: Ten years or so.
00:56:02.904 - 00:56:03.424, Speaker A: Yeah.
00:56:03.504 - 00:56:19.284, Speaker C: And she. She started to make art like five years ago, and then I found Nfts and invited her to share her work.
00:56:22.224 - 00:56:37.968, Speaker A: Well, it's pretty cool. It seems like some of the work seemed like. I mean, it seems like collage, I guess. And I really like the one with the hourglass that's pixelated. I don't know if you know that one. Orange, it's called. And it's got a high heel and a little.
00:56:37.968 - 00:56:48.364, Speaker A: Oh, you know that one? Yeah. Edition of five. Only two tazos on secondary there. So she did sell out of that one. So that's cool. Very cool.
00:56:48.664 - 00:56:49.564, Speaker C: One of.
00:56:51.620 - 00:56:51.898, Speaker A: Yes.
00:56:51.898 - 00:56:53.740, Speaker C: And them.
00:56:53.740 - 00:56:56.464, Speaker A: What is it about her work that you like?
00:56:59.284 - 00:57:00.304, Speaker C: Her work?
00:57:03.764 - 00:57:04.864, Speaker A: Let me.
00:57:05.204 - 00:57:17.904, Speaker C: She's into art also. And one of the latest works, and I love it, is the girl with the giant cross arms.
00:57:18.334 - 00:57:30.638, Speaker A: I see it. What is that called? Breakfast. Perfect title there. Oh, it's part of the girls gang on Tazos fashion collage. Yeah. That is very nice. And so that is probably AI, I'm guessing.
00:57:30.638 - 00:57:48.594, Speaker A: What do you think? Yeah, very interesting. That's great. And that is an addition of four already 25 tazos. Martin Joe has it for sale for 25 on secondary. So this is sold out, though. Very cool. And do you have any other artists for us?
00:57:52.894 - 00:58:16.542, Speaker C: No. Really? Just talk about her and because, well, all that I thought has been mentioned already, so Tornado and PP make most of the work I was told to share.
00:58:16.598 - 00:58:41.514, Speaker A: Okay, well, that's awesome. And I have retweeted your recent tweet. So everybody go check out Martin Joe's new tweet there. He has just done a drop on objects there. So very interesting perspective. Do you want to talk about the work? Very briefly, Martin Joe, before we go on to one raw one, one red, one rad latina, do you want to talk about the work at all?
00:58:41.594 - 00:58:44.694, Speaker C: About. About my work?
00:58:45.074 - 00:58:51.122, Speaker A: It looks like it's from the Kinky Bears series. Am I correct? Yes, yes.
00:58:51.258 - 00:59:13.732, Speaker C: I'm trying another perspective about the after party. It's a derivative by the. Of the playroom party series. And this one is about one that I made with mental noise and Karoxario also caras aurio. You can.
00:59:13.788 - 00:59:14.596, Speaker A: You can check.
00:59:14.700 - 00:59:18.980, Speaker C: You can check her work. He's a great grader, pixel artist.
00:59:19.012 - 00:59:22.144, Speaker A: Oh, I wonder if I've seen it. How do you spell it?
00:59:24.684 - 00:59:31.164, Speaker C: C a r o x a u.
00:59:31.984 - 00:59:44.288, Speaker A: R I carox oreo. Got it. It's almost like caro x Oreo. Very cool. I love the alien there. Don't forget to brush with the toothbrush there. So, yeah, people.
00:59:44.288 - 01:00:01.394, Speaker A: Oh, and look at elf. You know, it's funny, I was. I was in Munich yesterday and there was a nineties. Was it? Yeah, it was nineties trash night. And you know who they had on the poster? It was elf. And I thought that was like the perfect. There's nothing trash here than elf.
01:00:01.394 - 01:00:15.514, Speaker A: So. Yes, that is good one. Good one. So that's Carox Oreo Tez. Well, thank you, Martin Jo. That is awesome and always great to hear from you. So do come back.
01:00:16.974 - 01:00:18.630, Speaker C: Always a pleasure, my friends.
01:00:18.702 - 01:00:27.634, Speaker A: Indeed. Enjoy the day, my friend as well. One rad latina. Thank you for being patient. Welcome to the show. Where are you calling from?
01:00:29.294 - 01:00:33.030, Speaker E: Hello, I'm from New York City. I'm in New York City.
01:00:33.062 - 01:00:38.914, Speaker A: Okay. You're a little quiet right now. You're a little quiet right now. But we did hear it. But we did hear it.
01:00:39.254 - 01:00:40.834, Speaker E: Can you hear me better now?
01:00:42.054 - 01:00:54.594, Speaker A: Still a little quiet. We hear ourselves. We hear ourselves. Echoing. Echoing. But try and talk and we won't say too much.
01:00:58.824 - 01:01:00.136, Speaker E: Can you hear me clearer now?
01:01:00.200 - 01:01:06.096, Speaker A: Yep, but a little quiet. So if you can, like, yell into your phone, like, yell into your phone.
01:01:06.200 - 01:01:09.056, Speaker E: I'm gonna exit and come back in. It's probably something with my.
01:01:09.120 - 01:01:14.536, Speaker A: Sure, no problem at all. It probably is. Use the speaker on your phone. Use the speaker on your phone.
01:01:14.640 - 01:01:15.944, Speaker E: No, that's exactly what I'm doing.
01:01:15.984 - 01:01:18.136, Speaker A: There's a glitch with Twitter. Oh, you are?
01:01:18.200 - 01:01:18.488, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:01:18.536 - 01:01:18.952, Speaker D: 1 second.
01:01:19.008 - 01:01:28.464, Speaker A: Okay, great. Okay, great telad space. Doctor, welcome to the show. Thank you for being patient. Where are you calling from?
01:01:29.844 - 01:01:46.492, Speaker G: Well, hello there, fine party people. I am calling from almost Canada in central Maine. And I've listened, a long time listener, first time caller. I had a. I really like what you guys do here.
01:01:46.508 - 01:01:46.932, Speaker A: It's great.
01:01:46.988 - 01:02:06.034, Speaker G: But the I will unmute and talk about people that I don't think get enough street cred. And the two I'll mention to keep my time short is Nanda Tez. I put some of these in various comments below. I really like abstract art.
01:02:06.694 - 01:02:07.714, Speaker B: Please do.
01:02:08.054 - 01:02:31.324, Speaker G: I really like abstract art. And so the way, the depth and the controlled chaos that she presents in her works amazes me. She's on Tez and soul, and she's a brazilian artist. Very sharp, very witty. Descriptions are beautiful. Good messaging about human type subjects. And what she does is really, really good stuff.
01:02:32.384 - 01:02:43.074, Speaker A: Agreed. I mean, it's pretty interesting. Just before we move on. I mean, it's pretty interesting. Abstract art. How did you discover Nanda?
01:02:45.614 - 01:02:50.230, Speaker G: Just being a rambunctious hellion on Twitter mostly.
01:02:50.302 - 01:03:01.214, Speaker A: Yeah, that'll do it. I mean, yeah, there's no better way of finding artists. Really cool artists and. Yeah, just let me just see. Yeah. So. And actually doing okay.
01:03:01.214 - 01:03:18.814, Speaker A: I mean, selling a one of one for 50 tezos, so that's not bad at all. So interesting. And before we move to your next artist, do you make work? Tell a telad, and I totally recognize your profile here. I may have shown you work before and just forget.
01:03:19.714 - 01:03:29.454, Speaker G: Well, yeah, my, my handle is a little less radio friendly, so I won't go into it, but yeah, I am a. My. I'm on.
01:03:29.754 - 01:03:30.226, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:03:30.290 - 01:03:58.174, Speaker G: So my tezos handle is. Is what I do. I think. I think I just, I just kind of, I don't know, I just go full wagma and just kind of do whatever I want each day to make stuff and keep myself from hurting, murdering people, I think is what my pinned quote, my pinned tweets states. But arts font is my release from the grind of day to day life because I got a pretty busy day to day life. Well, every now and then I check out and come do this.
01:03:58.254 - 01:04:06.398, Speaker A: It's a noble cause. You have Teladie and is that your work that we see in your banner there? No.
01:04:06.446 - 01:04:14.274, Speaker G: So the, I'm actually highlighting the two artists that are my banner, my profile pic, the. I forgot which one's which.
01:04:15.814 - 01:04:20.078, Speaker A: I think the top one might be Nanda. It almost looks like Nando file.
01:04:20.126 - 01:04:22.822, Speaker G: Yeah, yeah, that's the top one's Nanda.
01:04:22.878 - 01:04:23.302, Speaker A: Yeah.
01:04:23.398 - 01:04:33.626, Speaker G: And that's one I've got. I've got a couple of those wonder ones. I flip art and sell art to buy Nanda wonder ones. And so that's one thing you might as well.
01:04:33.650 - 01:04:46.818, Speaker A: It sounds like good investment. Good work. And so tell us, who's your other artist? Naked Galena. Naked Galena. That one.
01:04:46.866 - 01:04:49.530, Speaker B: That's a name that's been brought up a few times in the comments.
01:04:49.642 - 01:05:01.300, Speaker A: Interesting. Good, good. Naked. Oh, yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Yeah.
01:05:01.300 - 01:05:12.024, Speaker A: This person is really interesting. I think, I want to say maybe it was Ed Marolla that pasted or someone did. Really interesting artists. Do you know anything about them, Teladie?
01:05:13.644 - 01:05:45.690, Speaker G: Yeah, they are living in, I think, Greece, currently from eastern Europe. She is, I think, primarily in oil painting and has been doing it for a couple of decades now. And what there's a lot. There's a. The width and depth of what she creates is amazing. She's got probably five different tez accounts, all with naked galena, and then kind of various breakdowns of it. But there's, like, abstract watercolors, there's, like, experimental stuff.
01:05:45.690 - 01:06:14.392, Speaker G: There's, like, your. Her, I think her bread and butter oil painting works. But the thing that's always drawn me, drawn me to her is the collage work. Like, she takes and does painting stuff, and then cuts pieces out and makes collages over them. And I have a special place in my heart. I kind of, I don't know. That was my, my, uh, gateway drug was collage work in the art, like, creating it and not just looking at it.
01:06:14.392 - 01:06:20.224, Speaker G: So, um, I really like that. And it's another example of controlled chaos that I like.
01:06:21.644 - 01:06:29.184, Speaker A: Interesting. And so, yeah, so. And how did you find naked Galena? It was that another Twitter discovery.
01:06:30.244 - 01:06:34.316, Speaker G: Yeah. So that, that Santiago fellow, he knows.
01:06:34.340 - 01:06:35.684, Speaker A: A lot of people, and he's very.
01:06:35.724 - 01:06:39.984, Speaker G: Good at connecting you to other people that you know. It's actually how I know about you.
01:06:40.364 - 01:07:01.014, Speaker A: That'S funny about little kids. That's the impression I get, is that he does know a lot of people. I think it was the most listened, but he also. Space we ever had, it had 1200 listens. I was like, where did all these listens come from? And that was San Diego's space. So I was, like, working. He's working his magic over there.
01:07:02.234 - 01:07:08.594, Speaker G: Well, when you have such a. Yeah, but, yeah, he's. He's a sandwich doctor. It's what. It always draws people to that.
01:07:08.634 - 01:07:08.922, Speaker C: Yeah.
01:07:08.978 - 01:07:25.226, Speaker G: Um, so he. But, yeah, but those are, those are. Those are the two that really resonate with me. And I put my money where my mouth is, and I have them on my PFP and my banner, and I will get every opportunity to get and talk about them, but I'll let other people talk.
01:07:25.250 - 01:07:25.538, Speaker A: I have.
01:07:25.586 - 01:07:27.090, Speaker B: It's always important to put your money.
01:07:27.122 - 01:07:31.734, Speaker G: Where your mouth is and make sure you write checks that you can cash.
01:07:34.834 - 01:07:35.522, Speaker A: Yeah, if you.
01:07:35.578 - 01:07:43.994, Speaker G: I have plenty of other people I like to. I can go over, but I'll step off for a. And if there's more time, I'll be more than happy to yap. Everyone knows I'll do that.
01:07:44.074 - 01:08:08.702, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Thank you, Teladie. Those are two awesome discoveries here. Naked Galena is a very talented painter, and so was the other person, that great abstract artist, Nanda, that you mentioned. So, too. I'm just following all these people on object here, because at least I'll see the notifications there. And it looks like one rad latina is back in action.
01:08:08.702 - 01:08:10.634, Speaker A: One red Latina. How are you doing?
01:08:11.774 - 01:08:13.750, Speaker E: Much better now that I updated my app.
01:08:13.822 - 01:08:16.274, Speaker A: Oh, yeah, it sounds ten times better.
01:08:17.174 - 01:08:19.614, Speaker E: Yes. And I get to use my headphones, which is awesome.
01:08:19.694 - 01:08:25.074, Speaker A: Yeah, great. So how are you doing? So you're calling from New York City. How are things over there?
01:08:26.654 - 01:08:35.930, Speaker E: They're nice. The weather's good. Thankfully, the cold is gone. So that's the best part of being in New York right now, is that it's no longer or cold.
01:08:36.002 - 01:08:42.642, Speaker A: Yeah, I can relate. I was in Toronto for four years and it's not that far. It's still a little bit more north. So it's a little cooler than New York.
01:08:42.698 - 01:08:46.842, Speaker E: But it gets cold. It gets cold in Toronto. It gets really cold in New York City, too.
01:08:46.898 - 01:08:57.254, Speaker A: Yeah, there's a real winter in that part of the world over there. So to help us out here, what artists do you think are underrated, underrepresented, underseen?
01:08:58.394 - 01:09:22.202, Speaker E: Well, I have two artists that I know. There is Frankie Funke. She is an artist out of California. She does digital illustrations and she's really. Well, actually, I shouldn't say she, I should say they, because I'm not sure how they identify themselves. And another artist that I want to give a big shout out to is Visha, an iranian artist. And she's a tradition.
01:09:22.202 - 01:09:41.023, Speaker E: They're both traditional artists. One is just a digital traditional artist and the other one is a physical artist. They're both now in web3 and, you know, making the rounds. And myself as well. I have to always advocate for myself. So these three amazing artists. Oh, and there's one more artist in the audience, Sierra.
01:09:41.023 - 01:09:51.235, Speaker E: They also make really incredible art. They're doing a project now. I think that's like geodes within AI, which is very cool as well. So I guess for artists.
01:09:51.419 - 01:09:59.468, Speaker A: Well, there's so much to jump on there. I don't know where to begin. Who's now that first artist? Funky. What was it?
01:09:59.516 - 01:10:00.868, Speaker E: It was Frankie Funky.
01:10:00.916 - 01:10:03.984, Speaker A: Frankie Funky. So how would we find their work? Are they on?
01:10:04.604 - 01:10:11.904, Speaker E: I'm gonna put everything. I'm going to actually add them in one of the comments. In your comments.
01:10:12.244 - 01:10:13.676, Speaker A: That's a brilliant idea.
01:10:13.820 - 01:10:16.904, Speaker E: So, Frankie, feel free to do that.
01:10:17.604 - 01:10:26.854, Speaker A: Yeah. With all the artists because. And if you know that any that are on like Twitter, Twitter or object, feel free to spell out their name, you know? Yeah.
01:10:26.934 - 01:11:22.018, Speaker E: Oh, I will. You know what's crazy, I never really noticed as much what blocks they're selling on because a lot of the artists now, they're multi chain and then, like, a whole bunch of my artist community that I know personally are not on Twitter, they're on Instagram, because that's more of an image sharing platform. So a lot of us are still using it to share images and videos because, because it's a little difficult to do that on this platform. But these three artists that I'm, let me just add myself as well. Why not? I know for sure are within the web3 space and are also, I'm not sure if juju Ma is also a traditional artist outside of web3, but I do like their work a lot, especially this geode stuff that they're doing, because as a traditional artist, I've also come to embrace AI. So I always like to see whatever artists are using it and I just put them in the comments.
01:11:22.146 - 01:11:29.106, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. So we can take a look and talk about a little bit about this geo and AI. Like, you mean like geography? Like, what are.
01:11:29.250 - 01:11:59.542, Speaker E: Oh, Geode. I'm sorry, I have a bit of a cold, so I'm a little stuffy. Geode, like rocks. So Sierra, she's in the audience, they're in the audience, and they make like they're doing something with fashion, I think, where it's, I see it on the timeline all the time, so I think it's really cool where the, where the fashion is made from the geodes. So like the dresses and everything. So they use AI for that. That's why AI is such an awesome tool, because it really helps you expand your creativity.
01:11:59.542 - 01:12:12.122, Speaker E: And right now, for example, I'm using AI to paint on canvases. Sometimes as a painter, I get blocked and I just don't know which way to go. So AI helps me like, break through those blocks, I think physical art as well.
01:12:12.258 - 01:12:23.374, Speaker A: I think that is so cool. I mean, AI is kind of an awesome compositional tool in terms of just giving you ideas for how to make a composition. Like, is that what you're talking about?
01:12:24.234 - 01:12:53.384, Speaker E: Oh, yeah, that and a lot of people don't, like, haven't really explored it for. So as artists, when you're like, living as an artist all the time, at least for me here in New York City, I live off grants, so I have to give art grants in order to, like, pay my rent for my studio and eat or sell work. So, yeah, so people don't understand that sometimes grant writing can take a week or two, and with like, chad GPT, I'm able to write grants in like 8 hours or less.
01:12:53.424 - 01:12:55.608, Speaker A: Oh, my gosh, yes.
01:12:55.656 - 01:13:17.734, Speaker E: And apply for like, more than one grant in a day. Because I'm able. Because it even makes the budget for you. That's what I really like about it, that I applied for a grant in New York City. It's called anonymous is not a woman, and it's for an environmental art grant. And it would have taken me days to write that grant, especially with the budget. I'm terrible at math.
01:13:17.734 - 01:13:27.036, Speaker E: And it was able to break down the budget for me within the range of what the grant was. And it was just like, it even put it in a.
01:13:27.060 - 01:13:27.340, Speaker A: In a.
01:13:27.372 - 01:13:30.652, Speaker E: In a format that I could, like, put it on an excel sheet. It was so crazy.
01:13:30.708 - 01:13:31.452, Speaker A: I couldn't believe it.
01:13:31.468 - 01:13:32.220, Speaker E: I was so happy.
01:13:32.292 - 01:13:40.108, Speaker A: That is the most hilarious thing I've heard in a while that, like, I mean, now the grant writers are gonna be out of a job soon, not just the copy.
01:13:40.196 - 01:13:51.964, Speaker E: Oh, poor them. I'm sorry. But it's like, I feel for, you know how it is when you're an artist. It's like. It's like there's so many hurdles for you to be able to, like.
01:13:52.084 - 01:13:52.772, Speaker A: Exactly.
01:13:52.868 - 01:13:53.164, Speaker E: Yeah.
01:13:53.204 - 01:14:14.400, Speaker A: And you can afford, like, artists can't afford someone to write their grant, you know, for them. Anyways, save it for the movie people. But, yeah, like, I mean, so I just think that's hilarious. I mean, sometimes I call this alpha for artists over here, what we're doing. So you just provided some pretty big alpha for the people that do the grants. That is pretty hilarious.
01:14:14.552 - 01:14:33.948, Speaker E: Oh, Visha, one of the artists that I mentioned, she's in the audience. She's the iranian artist. I just wanted to give her a shout out. I want to give a shout out to any artist from Iran, especially the women who are working so hard to even create in a place where they can hardly exist. So she's in the audience. Just wanted to give her a shout out.
01:14:34.036 - 01:14:59.362, Speaker A: Shout out to Vishay. And I see you sending the hearts. I've just given you a follow. And Vishay, if you want to join us on stage here, we're going to wrap up pretty soon, but feel free to put a request to speak. I'll actually invite you to speak here and feel free to join us up on stage if you want to say a few words. And so this is very exciting, and this is why we love to do this here, this really social thing. And one rad Latina.
01:14:59.362 - 01:15:08.858, Speaker A: And I see those. So you gave some links there to some of these artists that are here. So thank you. Any other comments here?
01:15:08.946 - 01:15:09.266, Speaker C: Those.
01:15:09.330 - 01:15:13.454, Speaker A: Fantastic. Really interesting. Do you show your work in New York?
01:15:14.854 - 01:15:38.358, Speaker E: I have, yes, I do show my work in New York, I also do graffiti and murals. So I have, like, murals. I have some. Some things I'm working on right now where I'm restoring a mural of an artist who passed away. I also have, like, some pieces up at a gallery. There's a couple of things coming up. I'm always kind of working, I guess you gotta be.
01:15:38.358 - 01:15:39.590, Speaker E: Oh, I wanted to.
01:15:39.702 - 01:15:40.062, Speaker A: Yes.
01:15:40.118 - 01:15:41.206, Speaker E: Because I bet I won't eat.
01:15:41.270 - 01:15:44.114, Speaker A: Yeah. In New York City, there's no time to rest, I don't think.
01:15:44.594 - 01:16:05.282, Speaker E: No, there really isn't. I have a cold right now, and I decided that I was supposed to go paint the restoration, and I can't because I'm sick, obviously, and I don't want to get other people sick. So I stayed home and painted instead because it's like an obsession of compulsion. But I also thought about, like, Frida Kahlo made her best work when she was sick, and she was, like, always sick.
01:16:05.378 - 01:16:16.614, Speaker A: Great. So I was like, great point and great story. And guess who joined us on stage? It's Visha. I don't know. Calling from Iran, perhaps? Visha, welcome to the show. Where are you calling from?
01:16:18.314 - 01:16:20.394, Speaker E: Hello, hello, how are you?
01:16:20.434 - 01:16:21.082, Speaker A: We're doing great.
01:16:21.138 - 01:16:22.826, Speaker E: Big shout out to Bara.
01:16:22.930 - 01:16:23.498, Speaker F: Thank you.
01:16:23.546 - 01:16:25.854, Speaker E: Thank you so much for having me here.
01:16:26.474 - 01:16:39.794, Speaker A: Yeah, this is great. And it's great to have you here. Do you want to speak about your work at all? We have recently just heard about you and are discovering your work as we speak. Do you want to speak about what you're up to as an artist?
01:16:41.214 - 01:16:52.114, Speaker E: Oh, yes. Thank you so much. I'm surprised. Yes. Let me give you a brief introduction about myself.
01:16:53.334 - 01:16:56.914, Speaker A: Sorry. Yeah, not too long, but yeah, go for it.
01:16:57.694 - 01:17:49.854, Speaker E: Okay. Okay. I started art since 2011, and after that I started studied islamic arts branch of persian painting and contemporary art simultaneously, and continued my education in master of arts research. And since 2014, till now, I mostly focused on video art and performance and short films. Before that, I used various kind of media from painting, photography and other stuff. And yes, now I have some collections and objects from different styles of my works. And also some of my video and performances are on foundation.
01:17:49.854 - 01:18:00.312, Speaker E: And yes, I will add more of my work soon on the other platforms. I don't know what. Thank you. Thank you so much for giving me time.
01:18:00.408 - 01:18:20.320, Speaker A: Well, thank you for joining us. And again, everybody go give Visha a follow if you can. Again, woman artist out of Iran. So that is super cool. I love how international these shows are. It just kind of boggles my mind. As we're wrapping up here, we have Roberto Salazar.
01:18:20.320 - 01:18:29.348, Speaker A: Big shout out, Roberto. Welcome to the stage. Where are you calling from? Hey. Hi, Adrian. I'm from Mexico. Yeah. I'm calling from Mexico.
01:18:29.348 - 01:19:04.214, Speaker A: Yeah. Awesome. Awesome. So tell us, what artists out there do you think are underrepresented or underrated or unseen? Well, there's many. Like, in general, I just feel that complexity is just very difficult to express via Twitter and to make it surface against this huge blanket of noise. So, in general, I would say that, you know, it's a little bit of a. It's very difficult to express nuance.
01:19:04.214 - 01:19:32.692, Speaker A: Yeah. Like, as an artist yourself, you're saying it's hard to break through the noise. Yeah. And to express more complex ideas also, you know. Oh, I totally know what you mean. I mean, you know, what's interesting is, like, on Twitter, I didn't really do well at all until I started video because I. And I think it's really, to your point, like, all the nuance, it's a very lo fi medium, Twitter.
01:19:32.692 - 01:20:02.302, Speaker A: I mean, it's a few words, right? And you have a profile picture and a couple of words for your name. I mean, you really don't have much to go on. And so if you're trying to express nuance, as you say, good luck to you. You know what I mean? Yes, absolutely. And can you. Do you want to give us a couple of sentences about your art since here, you're breaking through the noise a little bit here. What are you working on? Oh, well, I'm just.
01:20:02.302 - 01:20:33.272, Speaker A: I like exploring media, right. And a little bit of philosophy about what an image is, what conforms it, you know, and also to think of images as objects, like their material dimension. So, yeah, so I just started a little YouTube channel where I talk about my work. If somebody's interested, they can look at the clips. Awesome. So everybody go, there it is, Roberto. Let me just see.
01:20:33.272 - 01:20:48.798, Speaker A: Here it is cut off here. Roberto sells that on Twitter there. And he is on the stage there. So go give Roberto a follow. And finally, we have. We missed Doctor Virgin. He probably had to go to work or something.
01:20:48.798 - 01:20:56.474, Speaker A: Sierra, welcome to the show. You are likely our last speaker here. As we wrap up. How are you doing? And where are you calling from?
01:20:58.014 - 01:21:01.754, Speaker F: Hi. Happy hump day. Today's Wednesday, right?
01:21:02.254 - 01:21:06.654, Speaker A: I don't know. I'm on vacation. Yes, it's Wednesday because we're doing the Twitter spaces.
01:21:08.234 - 01:21:08.914, Speaker E: Oh, my God.
01:21:08.954 - 01:21:26.854, Speaker F: It's all a blur. I am in Virginia, on the east coast, in the US. Thanks for having me. One rad Latina tagged me in a comment and I just wanted to come up and say, thanks for tagging me as, you know, an underrated artist. I super appreciate that.
01:21:27.154 - 01:21:33.494, Speaker A: Yeah. And that's the thing. I think even if you're, like, really famous, it's never bad to be underrated, right?
01:21:35.074 - 01:21:46.466, Speaker F: Yeah, absolutely. I think what we're all doing is so new that a lot of us are underrated just because not enough people have seen or understand what we're doing yet.
01:21:46.650 - 01:22:02.774, Speaker A: Well, yeah. And to Roberto's point that he was just making, I mean, it's pretty challenging to break through the noise. I mean, there are thousands of artists trying to get their work out there and be seen and everything. So now that you're here, I mean, why don't you tell us a little bit about what you do and what you're working on in a few sentences?
01:22:04.044 - 01:22:41.174, Speaker F: Yes, of course. Okay. I am a woman of many talents, but in a nutshell, I'm a yoga instructor, and I am big into mindfulness, crystals, meditation. I have a crystal store. And as of, like, the last six to eight months, I've been using AI to imagine crystal inspired fashion and furniture, create meditation, visualizers, and just using the technology to get further in touch with myself and meet lots of awesome people. So, yeah, thanks for having me. This is a great space.
01:22:41.594 - 01:22:55.294, Speaker A: Well, thank you for showing up here. And so I see one rad latina's post here. So are you. I'm trying to connect you to. Okay, so you're juju mama, is that correct?
01:22:56.434 - 01:23:04.082, Speaker F: Yes. Well, in real life, I'm Sierra, but here in the twitterverse, I'm juju mama because my crystal store is good juju.
01:23:04.258 - 01:23:24.950, Speaker A: Okay, awesome. Okay, I've connected the dots over here. Excellent. Well, thank you for joining us, and it's great to hear from you. Does anybody have any final thoughts here before I turn to rune tune? No final thoughts. Okay. Actually, there's one thing I wanted to mention.
01:23:24.950 - 01:23:50.006, Speaker A: I saw there are a few people. Let me just very quickly here. I had it in front of me. Mikey Wilson. We had a few people. Just as we wrap up here, a lot of people posted in the comments here. Dead Maryland, said Dima Kachenko, who I'm giving a follow to bleh 281, who I think I've seen blood 280 one's work recently.
01:23:50.006 - 01:24:06.390, Speaker A: Risatio said Nyarc one rinny fish. No stranger around here. Pablo, five K and circle, not circle, shirkle. And also retro. Manny said brave pixel and Fendal. Mark and Mek TXT said lubital. Blizna m.
01:24:06.390 - 01:24:39.412, Speaker A: Singali, son of stag and Dika Primawan. And finally telad billion NFT, Bezek Kalhaio and Nan Danadim. So all the links to these artists are in the comments of this space here and McBreezy. Also Zeri's James NFT, Ozon Aya and BGF Del 92 and more. I could probably keep going here, but. And human boy Zubiz xxx. So there we have it.
01:24:39.412 - 01:25:03.564, Speaker A: What a wonderful way to just learn about new artists. You know, as far as a social proof is concerned, there's no better way to learn about artists than from other artists. And so with that runetune, do you have any final thoughts for us as we finish up a 90 minutes segment here on underrepresented artists?
01:25:05.064 - 01:25:46.214, Speaker B: Yes, I just wanted to throw out one last name, which is wasteman Goldminevich. I was wondering if someone else might bring it up without me. I meant to talk about him earlier in the show, but our conversation took us elsewhere. I was hoping to see him in the audience, but I talked to him earlier before this show, and it seemed like he was having a hard time getting a hold of a phone. He's my most collected artist. He touches down on a lot of the themes we've been talking about, which is being prolific and not letting sales or, you know, reach keep you from being prolific. He makes art that I think of in my head as back of the classroom artwork.
01:25:46.214 - 01:25:53.294, Speaker B: Love his humor, love his authenticity. Just wanted to throw that one last name out there.
01:25:53.834 - 01:26:25.296, Speaker A: Great, great mention. I mean, his failed artist series is one of my all time favorites, actually. Yeah, like with the fry guy and the fries are everywhere, the ketchup is everywhere, our milk. I want to bring you on, but I have to run because there are people that want me to go to a bavarian beer hall, beer garden, as they call it out here. We're going to have to wait on that, but other than that, I think that's it, everyone. So thank you, everybody, for sharing and looking forward to next time. We're here every week.
01:26:25.296 - 01:26:32.544, Speaker A: And big thank you to everybody that came on stage, to everybody listening, and especially to runetune. Until next time, take care.
