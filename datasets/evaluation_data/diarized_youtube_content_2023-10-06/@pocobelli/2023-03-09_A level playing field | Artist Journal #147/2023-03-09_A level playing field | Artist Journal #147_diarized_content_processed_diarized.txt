00:00:03.520 - 00:00:44.504, Speaker A: I am wrestling with myself in my mind, is this life imitating art or art imitating life? It has snowed outside, I guess because this image came out first, I suppose. Life is imitating art. Artist journal, March 9, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. It's funny, I was on the podcast a late night last night there, trying not to wake up my neighbors with my voice, which my girlfriend says is far too loud when we are in restaurants. I don't think it's too loud.
00:00:44.504 - 00:01:02.058, Speaker A: I think she's just giving me a hard time. But yeah. Anyways, it was an awesome conversation yesterday with die with the most likes and threesomes on their podcast. We had a good time. I felt like I needed a beer. It was just a very fun hangout and it was great conversation. So that is available.
00:01:02.058 - 00:01:21.614, Speaker A: I'll show the link. Let's get to this first. Again, art imitating life or life imitating art? Because now it's snowing. And this came out first. You know, winter came late here in Berlin. But anyway, I think you know the artist here, Michael Macasso. And this was one of those works that I think I.
00:01:21.614 - 00:01:44.582, Speaker A: It just hit me on a reptilian level, frankly. Even before I understood what I was looking at, that that was a tree and I loved it. So there's something to be said for that kind of experience here. And, yeah, I mean, it's just a beautiful, beautiful still life. I love the margin and frame, too. I'm kind of big on those kind of details like that. And just like the beautiful rendition.
00:01:44.582 - 00:02:05.934, Speaker A: And let's just look at the resolution here. 180 by 210. So this is super important. And of course, scaled up to ten, x to 1800 by 2100. And we also know, I think the word is nomenclature. We also know the nomenclature. 180 by 210 by ten is another way of saying it's been scaled up by ten.
00:02:05.934 - 00:02:42.164, Speaker A: But, you know, sometimes I mention how if I was to do a class on digital art, I would start with pixel art, because it presents you with some of the most basic problems that you need to solve right away. And in this case, it's the size of the canvas, right? And look at how small that canvas is, 180 by 210. I mean, a Google Ad is 300. The small rectangular, you know, square rectangular. Google Ad is 300 by 250, last I checked. So this is smaller than that. So pretty cool.
00:02:42.164 - 00:02:57.184, Speaker A: But it is the nature of Pixel art. Anyway, a beautiful, beautiful work by Mech TXT. Great to see him back on the scene. And we got a few by him, actually. And here's another one calling the day off for that little sleep. Oasis. Have a good rest, everyone.
00:02:57.184 - 00:03:44.984, Speaker A: And so another just gorgeous work here, the rendition of the snow and everything, this little hut in a snowy, what seems like a snowy field. But like, this is what's kind of interesting, the extra decisions that seem to be made here, because doesn't this kind of look like clouds over here? And then the landscape. And again, I'm kind of back to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, my hometown. Shout out to mom, who is likely watching this. It almost reminds me of one of those gray days where almost the gray snow, the reflection of the sky on the snow and everything, and it's just kind of. Everything is just kind of gray. It's almost like that out here in Berlin today, although it's much more intense in Saskatoon, where the snow where you just look off into the plains.
00:03:44.984 - 00:04:11.602, Speaker A: So here's another landscape by mech TxT. So he is coming out in force. And this is an interesting one as well. Again, it's kind of. There seems to be a move or a step towards. Just towards abstraction, just a slight step towards abstraction, which I find super interesting. It's almost like the color layer that colors in the clouds is being deleted.
00:04:11.602 - 00:04:34.298, Speaker A: This is what I see. Yeah, I see basically there's layers that are being turned off. One of my favorite techniques, who knows? But anyway, interesting. And this was on Solana and sold for dollar 213. A one of one. I mean, seems pretty reasonable. This probably would have went, I'm guessing, I don't know, might have went for a lot more on tezos.
00:04:34.298 - 00:05:17.978, Speaker A: So the reason I mention that is there are deals to be had, you know, with artists like Mandal, who also posts on Solana. There are deals to be had on Solana. Here's another one that mech TXT published here on Twitter, liminal horizon lunch break practice. So just sketches here, an interesting kind of portal or something, almost like 2001 type thing going on here. So again, just kind of interesting experimentation. And it's kind of back to this idea of taking breaks. And I don't think mech TXT took a huge break, but he was on vacation for a couple of weeks there, and sometimes that's just enough to completely reinvigorate your process and just come up with new ideas.
00:05:17.978 - 00:05:44.910, Speaker A: So there is something to be said for taking breaks here and there, and that's true for anything. And shout out to rosatio, who mentions Michael Macasso here. I think I watched too much of Pokebilly's artist journal, pixel Art bleeds to my art. Now shout out to Michael Macasso, too, the pixel art specialist in this space. Work in progress for one of my works that will be dropped on foundation next week. So here we see the pixelation has been added. So very cool.
00:05:44.910 - 00:06:17.922, Speaker A: And it's pretty interesting work, again, to just kind of return to Rosatio's, you know, work here with a moon that, you know, seems to be masked by this black here, and then a skull put on top, and even just this, you know, brush that. This beautiful digital brush that almost creates, like, a no smoking. Like, in German, you'd say a verboten. Like a verboten. Sign here, this red stripe across. So, anyways, there's a lot going on here. So anyways, shout out to Rosatio.
00:06:17.922 - 00:06:55.770, Speaker A: Glad you're enjoying the show, and, yeah, trying to make the best of everybody's time here. So continuing on, thank you, everybody, for showing up yesterday to the artists. The Twitter spaces that we had yesterday, has the role of the curator changed? It was like I was taken aback at all the participation. When I first put out this tweet, there wasn't much traction, so I thought, oh, maybe people aren't interested. Maybe me and Roentoon will have to carry the show, and that'll be fun. In fact, we couldn't get to everybody, and we got some wonderful comments at the very end. I think it was Briona.
00:06:55.770 - 00:08:16.110, Speaker A: I think. Anyways, we got really wonderful people and a great discussion on curatorship and this whole. I think we actually made a lot of progress on this discussion that we're having on this program, which is this whole idea of open versus closed platforms. Kind of the beautiful conclusion, I think it was underground that helped us come to this conclusion, is it's not, you know, it's not open platform good, closed platform bad. It's, you know, the important thing, kind of the takeaway for me, and I think for maybe some other people was it's just important that we have these open platforms, like object or on tezos or, like, foundation on ethereum, just so that people can make their name, so to speak, show, create a, you know, if you're completely unknown and then you show up here that you have basically a level playing field to build something for yourself. And right now, these both exist. So in a sense, from there, if you can persuade people on these other, you know who with these CLO, on these closed platforms to bring you on, you kind of have the opportunity to do so, you know, by showing that you can do it on these other platforms.
00:08:16.110 - 00:08:39.070, Speaker A: So I thought it was actually, we really pushed the, for me in my own mind, the conversation forward, because then maybe it's like, well, maybe object one's not so bad that it's, you know, quote unquote closed. And anyway, there's some great thoughts. And Ed Marolla showed up, which was also awesome. So anyways, check that out. And again, we do it every Wednesday, 09:30 a.m. Eastern standard time. Come join and have your say.
00:08:39.070 - 00:09:06.924, Speaker A: It was really, I was really thrilled with it. And here is the hangout yesterday with die with the most likes on the left here and threesomes on the right. I always thought he looked, I thought, I thought it was going to be this guy. And actually it turned out to be a much younger guy. So anyways, it was a lot of fun and I highly recommend that podcast and that show. We had a ton of fun. Sounds like we'll do it again and I'd be thrilled.
00:09:06.924 - 00:09:42.228, Speaker A: As I said, I'll to bring the beer next time. Comments so I guess the show got out a little bit. The Louvre or the Louvre or as I think Mars yesterday said, I didn't realize it was pronounced Louvre as I've been pronounced, it's the Louvre, as Mars, the guy from Texas, pointed out to me. But we got some interesting comments that I did want to go over because it's kind of a, well, it was kind of a, what's the word? It was an interesting discussion. Let's call it that. It's funny from Sabato. So great to hear from Sabato.
00:09:42.228 - 00:10:08.984, Speaker A: Great episode. It's funny that you brought up the question about the Louvre. I visited there in 2018 and at the time I had a brazilian painter friend who also said he was said friend who was also showing at the Louvre, quote unquote. So I went to the main museum and walked around all day. Place is huge and didn't see any contemporary art. Before leaving, I realized that there was a whole Louvre carousel building that I missed where my friend was showing. I think that whole block along with the garden are all technically, quote unquote the Louvre.
00:10:08.984 - 00:10:56.540, Speaker A: But I appreciate you parsing that bit of pr. On a side note, I've noticed a lot of exhibition opportunities geared towards digital activists, sorry, digital artists that exist mostly to get some kind of cultural milestone or to check off a box on a cv instead of trying to create fulfilling viewing experiences. I think the show your art in Times Square thing is another example of this trend because no one really likes to go to Times Square or the worst example, actually, there's no space for comfortable viewing. And from my own experience, it's sort of a downer to realize that your art is just competing with ad buys from mega corporations selling stupid things. The Louvre carousel does sound nicer than Times Square. Both have a McDonald's, but I've also never been to the former. I'm curious what exhibiting there is like.
00:10:56.540 - 00:11:44.608, Speaker A: If it feels like a gallery or like an indoor shopping center. In any case, it makes for great pr. So yeah, so interesting comment. And I think really in the second paragraph I thought that was particularly interesting because I think there is a mentality as everybody is trying to grow and succeed in the space and art, you know, again, it's an entrepreneurial and it is a, you know, at times a competitive venture. I mean, so people are trying to pad their cv's social proof, as we've been discussing since the very beginning of this show, you know, trying to get okay, now I've shown in the quote unquote the Louvre or on Times Square. Therefore I have made it and you should pay more for my work and you should show me in other works. So yeah, so interesting.
00:11:44.608 - 00:12:32.334, Speaker A: And while disposed actually had a very interesting comment, which is a bit more, let's say blunt, which I thought was interesting, I agree. This type of move seems consistent with the current mainstream NFT and crypto trends. Another scam that is bound to keep the whole space exhibiting next to McDonald's and across the street from the renowned cultural arts centers. I admire Claire Silver's work and agree with Sabato. That would be pretty cool showcasing at the carousel. But I believe the distinction is immensely important to signal intelligence, respect and an ability to cite references proving those things will win the respect of the general public. But we would rather mire in the dgen life of attention debt forever.
00:12:32.334 - 00:13:25.374, Speaker A: There are some that know and care how to be articulate and intentional. We need just more examples than we have to get past the despicable image most of humanity has for NFT crypto art. Thanks for the deep dive and teaching through example how to research things and provide accurate information. You know, the reason I read this is because I think while disposed actually has a pretty important point and I agree. And I think Sabato ultimately agrees, you know, that this distinction is important. It's not a meaningless, you know, again, you don't want to make a mountain of a molehill, but it is important. And the kind of what we could all argue, and maybe it's unintentional, but this kind of misdirection or misrepresentation, intentional or not, of this situation.
00:13:25.374 - 00:14:33.120, Speaker A: I mean, what are the people at the Louvre going to think when they see this? And they go, oh, okay, what do they think? Right? Or what does the general public think? And then they go, okay, what does the William Morris, what does wme think? You know, I don't know if Claire has thought that through either, because if I'm William Morris and I look at this and I see this, you know, I wonder what the deal is, because I think to wildispose point is, it seems to confirm people's worst fears about the crypto space, you know, and so while disposed is saying, this isn't helping us, and I think well disposed actually has a pretty good point. So. And Bowles also weighed in, and I don't want to spend too much time, but it was kind of topical, shall we say. And Bowles also basically confirmed what was being said, that it is, in fact, a shopping mall. Hello, Adrian. Hope you're doing well. I'm watching, and I asked Bowls if I could share this, by the way, and watching today's episode and the Claire Silver Louvre controversy, I can confirm little controversy.
00:14:33.120 - 00:14:54.874, Speaker A: I can confirm everything you say about the carousel Duluth. So Bolles has actually put on a show there. I have tokenized pieces to the carousel Juve too. Probably the first ever tokenized pieces ever in there. Not that anyone cares. So thanks, Bolz. So anyways, it sounds like we got the story right over here.
00:14:54.874 - 00:15:28.776, Speaker A: Yeah. So I can confirm the carousel du Louvre has really nothing to do with the Louvre museum side of things. As you said, it's kind of like a mall. Our collection was exhibited in the context of art shopping event that took place at the Carousel du Louvre. And this is the important thing also as a little project. And besides not being really the Louvre, this was huge for us, and we are very glad we had the chance to do something like this. So exactly like it's not to diminish anything, but it's just to kind of get it right because I think it kind of hits at the credibility of the space.
00:15:28.776 - 00:15:57.318, Speaker A: I would argue from my personal journal over here, you know, I think it hurts. And so, yeah, so I think it's just something important to be recognized that, you know, to be accurate. It builds credibility. Now we got another tweet on top of this. Now, at first I thought this was all going to be clarified. This from Claire Silver, confusion in the notice. The Louvre has not acquisitioned my work.
00:15:57.318 - 00:16:30.298, Speaker A: I'm just exhibiting there as reported in my tweet in Variety. This is facilitated by Super Chief NFt. I'm also not the first AI artist to do so. To my knowledge, that honor goes to Van Arman. So this was after, so this was a clarification. And so, but again, is this a clarification? So I'm just exhibiting there. So anyway, again, I don't want to make too much of this, but then I'll show you.
00:16:30.298 - 00:16:54.636, Speaker A: This is the problem and let me show you so NFT statistics. When Claire Silver came on proof podcast, she explained that when she got her first punk, she was told not to sell until the punks are in the moMA. Crazy that her own work will be featured in a Grail tier museum first and just, you know, listen. So what the public understands this is the problem is this mister 703 who.
00:16:54.660 - 00:17:16.746, Speaker B: Gifted it to me said, you shouldn't sell it until a punk is featured in the moMA. Okay, and how crazy is it that the punk hasn't got to the moma yet, but her work is getting featured at the Louvre in Paris? Just completely incredible. I'm giving her a little apology. A few years ago now she's being featured in one of the most historic museums on the planet. But she said when I first okay.
00:17:16.810 - 00:18:01.474, Speaker A: So, you know, and I'm sure NFT statistics, the host there, he just probably doesn't know any better. Like, and you can't blame him, can you? I mean he's just taking the information he's gotten. Maybe he didn't have to spend 2 hours researching this, you know, like, you know, he just assumes that the information is good. So anyways, that is kind of the problem. And then this gets perpetuated and then the general public or even the contemporary art world and just goes okay, NFT. And crypto space has a long way to go as while disposed kind of points out, and I don't think this scene needs to do that, I think the art is already there. I just don't think it's necessary to overreach.
00:18:01.474 - 00:18:42.466, Speaker A: So anyways, and look at this. So here is a beautiful story of a guy who started on Tezos like maybe a year, two years ago and went to super rare, graduated, we might say, or however you want to put that. And then, you know, after proving himself on object, and Tezos then goes to super rare, does very well, very nice guy, and now he's at Sotheby's, okay, so that is the promise of this space. And I just think it's awesome. So one don't knows. Gm I'm thrilled to announce that my art daydreaming will be auctioned at Sotheby's. And here it is, sotheby's website.
00:18:42.466 - 00:19:07.224, Speaker A: It is there, right? And so congratulations to one don't knows daydreaming. I mean, that is so impressive. Right? Here's again, like that is the promise of this space. And that is something that, you know, how often does that happen in the contemporary art world? It's not the most. It does happen. You know, people's careers do move. But I think he's, if I'm not mistaken, in Indonesia.
00:19:07.224 - 00:19:34.568, Speaker A: And how many people does that happen to in Indonesia? Right? So digital. So anyways, very cool curation from NFT Asia. And here are other works from the show. There are, I think, ten works, and there's so complex or complex main course. Maybe we'll just take a very quick look at that. So very cool. So these guys are now, you know, quote unquote Sotheby's artists, as people like to say.
00:19:34.568 - 00:20:16.212, Speaker A: So I think it's great. Here's another one. Daniel Liang so just an example of what is happening out there. More commentary. Pablo Puncaso. So this kind of feeds into this whole idea that kind of the collector and the curator and the artist are all blending into one on this, in this scene, for whatever reason, because I was very surprised to see that Pablo Pincasso is actually an artist as well, you know, as, as well as, you know, disrupting super rare, one could argue, also as an artist, all 75 reincarnated, reincarnated limited editions have been minted. Seriously? Can't say enough for all the support I got today.
00:20:16.212 - 00:21:02.650, Speaker A: So many absolute legends. And here is the series that looks like AI art, and here are the additions, so you can see it there. So anyway, another example of the artist, collector, collector, artist, curator, artist, collector, artist, which I think is interesting. And a couple of more comments here and we'll get to foundation open editions that are happening right now. The one of one and edition market will remain fragmented and relatively slow until better collector tools are created. It's simply too spread out and confusing for collectors with liquidity to really get a grasp for what's going on. And so that's also Pablo Pincasso.
00:21:02.650 - 00:22:01.706, Speaker A: And I basically agree that it's overwhelming. And once you have spent as much, say, time as I or many of you have in the space, you do get a familiarity and you do get a sense of where you are. And a sense of the word escapes me right now, but just being able to ground yourself and recognize, okay, this is kind of from that space this is, you know, in that category, which is why, again, I did that. The genres of digital art, it's a way to bring people in so that, because otherwise it's too confusing. So just kind of saying something that I think a lot of us knew, it's pretty confusing out there, especially for people in the space, and also for people even outside the space. Here's foundation now, they have just released, I think, what they're calling live editions, and they put out a show. So these are a bunch of open editions on foundation, which is on ethereum.
00:22:01.706 - 00:22:41.010, Speaker A: And look at this, 32,000 have sold already. Foundation's inaugural world replica invites 35 exceptional creators to release an open edition in one unified moment, combining the enhanced network effects of additions with the power of community. So this is pretty cool. And so this is brand new. And I mean, one of the takeaways here is, so now they have open editions. Like, if I'm object, I continue to be concerned that foundation is going to eat my lunch here. Now they're just doing open editions, as far as I understand right now.
00:22:41.010 - 00:23:27.714, Speaker A: But what happens when they start doing limited editions, you know, and the only thing that I think, you know, really stops foundation are ETH gas fees. That is like, to me, the biggest hurdle that they have to kind of keep on encroaching on object space. But who knows, you know? Again, just speculation and thoughts from a journal here. This is a great work, actually, we're going to look at this in a second. And so one more from Pablo Puncaso, who is very quotable here. Loving additions on foundation, but two features are just absolute must to push it to the next level of full adoption, limited editions, as we were just saying, and 1155 support. Now, this is a technical NFT.
00:23:27.714 - 00:24:05.282, Speaker A: There's basically two kinds of NFTs, the 721, ERC 721, and the ERC 1155. Generally, additions are done with the 1155. So I'm actually surprised to see that these would be ERC 721s. But maybe. But I think I do understand it's just the way, like on Opensea, you'll see, sometimes you'll see an addition of 100 and it'll be one work, and then that would be an ERC 1155. But if you have an edition of 100 and you see 100 different versions, those would be each one at ERC 721. So I assume these are ERC 721s that are going on here.
00:24:05.282 - 00:24:33.964, Speaker A: So interesting comments. And finally, Dancontrol went shopping. I would buy a lot more if I could. Wonderful curation and awesome new feature by foundation for their replica world. And it's interesting how they're combining the worlds like the curated show with these open editions, so they continue to innovate. And again, here's that really cool work here and other really cool works that Dan control found. And look at this, lists them all.
00:24:33.964 - 00:25:22.144, Speaker A: How cool is that? So shout out to Dancontrol. And I assume he is not far behind enlisting one for him. One kind of visual question I have as we look at, say, this super cool work here is this decision to put these works kind of show that it's an addition underneath. It does slightly distract from the composition, but if we click on it, can we make it bigger? That's kind of interesting too. And maybe I just can't find the make it bigger thing, but it does kind of change the work a tiny bit by having this kind of multiple image underneath it. So yeah, I'm trying to double click here. Maybe that's just my browser right now though.
00:25:22.144 - 00:25:41.226, Speaker A: So anyways, influencing by Kita Savvy and I thought this was just a really nice work. Maybe we can open a new tab. Here it is. Let's go up close. So anyways, just a very interesting, unusual work here. So Dan control collected it. I think Sabato also retweeted this.
00:25:41.226 - 00:26:01.286, Speaker A: And very interesting. Speaking of Sabato, here is he put out a work called garsome. So interesting drawing exercise. And he actually had a very interesting comment. Let's look at the comment first and then go back to the work. Uh, here it is. This is what I wanted to.
00:26:01.286 - 00:26:49.994, Speaker A: This is my first ever walk cycle animation made entirely in deluxe paint. And this is what I want to get to. It's an ode to labor, to all the workers that I've got to always be serving and like they're a robot or something. So anyway, I thought that was a pretty, uh, just a cool work here. And again, to me, this just shows, like, the thoughtfulness and the depth of this scene where it's like, this isn't just a animation of a robot, Sci-Fi robot serving, you know, drinks, it is also a commentary on, you know, the class structure and all this sort of thing. However you might think of this and really cool sun here. So just to me that just shows depth wherever we fall on how we feel about.
00:26:49.994 - 00:27:18.540, Speaker A: About the commentary, I just think it's interesting and it's just more evidence that there is the depth that you'll find in the contemporary art scene exists in this scene, as we kind of already know. But I still think it's worth pointing out. McHx gonna have to run through this episode here. Les reve Artificial e zero one. So we've seen MChx many times before. So also playing with the open editions. And so nine sold at 0.2.
00:27:18.540 - 00:27:51.920, Speaker A: Again, that's 18 ETH. What is that? Like? Probably $300. Not bad at all. So the open edition concept, at very low prices, continues to draw. You know, there is a market for it, which I think a lot of people might not have thought about in ahead of time. I think a lot of people, if you just told them abstractly that open editions, I think a lot of people would think that it wouldn't be the most collectible thing, but people keep buying them, I guess, is the takeaway. So, on to other works here.
00:27:51.920 - 00:28:33.506, Speaker A: So onto the painting, so to speak. Oxine with a pretty interesting work here, almost like a crucifixion of old, what looked like old Apple Mac's chronicles of hierarchy. And interestingly, we have the happy guy. So, you know, almost like the pecking order here with the happy guy on top who's drooling over top of the, you know, again, it's almost a class structure commentary with people in the middle who are just, you know, doing okay, and then people on the bottom who are sad. Beautiful brushwork here. Again, very likely procreate. Very big brush strokes, that nice, loose sort of feeling.
00:28:33.506 - 00:29:00.158, Speaker A: Beautiful shadow here, beautiful colors, and with the do not cross and an easy flashing to consume. You know, not a harsh flash, but an easy one. And again, just beautiful textures, painterly background. Chronicles of hierarchy went for auction for 3.269 east. So $5,000 for Euxine. So another nice sale went to befield 317 on super rare.
00:29:00.158 - 00:29:37.574, Speaker A: So Euxine continues to hit it out of the park here, RJ. So, you know, one of my favorite artists, RJ, has an open edition, and there's only three minted here. And so, artificial intelligence. The prompt, the product, the prompt, the product. So, anyways, just sort of highlighting this, and I think there may be some sort of burn mechanics, I'm not sure, but let's just take a closer look at the work here, and you almost wonder. So let's read the prompt here. A lonely laptop on an empty desk in a minimalist pixel art style that evokes a sense of quality, quiet unease.
00:29:37.574 - 00:30:50.486, Speaker A: Now, what I suspect might be happening here is something that. Another way that's actually like, I did a work that was inspired by AI, and I kind of think something might similar might be going on here. Which is this is likely the prompt and then I'm just speculating here and then RJ gets this maybe without this text on here as a result and then instead of using it as raw AI, but then uses that as a source to then apply his style on top and then make a work out of it and then maybe put the prompt in the computer screen. So that is my speculation on what's going on there. And so anyways, just kind of really cool, beautiful work for basically very cheap here and hardly any very low edition from RJ Spagelsmaskinen with a fabulous work here when the cats away pc tower floppy disks five and a quarter and three and a half inch keyboard monitor. Again 320 by 240 x two. So just a really, really cool fun work from Spagels Maskinen.
00:30:50.486 - 00:31:08.634, Speaker A: Gotta love the keyboard and the discs. And I am old enough to remember those five and a quarter inch floppy disks from my youth. And yeah, so it's all pretty awesome. Even a retro screensaver there still available for 25 tezos. Edition of 25. Six left. It's going fast.
00:31:08.634 - 00:31:47.212, Speaker A: It's probably gone by the time you get it when the cat's away. Kind of a mysterious, I guess the cat may be on the keyboard, I don't know. And anyways, another one of retro computers here from cello who we haven't had here for a while. Let's see if this loads up. And playing all these great retro video games, I feel like this might be. I can't remember what game that is but anyways, I feel like hard hat Max should be here somewhere. Maybe I can't remember what games these are but maybe you all remember some of these games.
00:31:47.212 - 00:32:09.584, Speaker A: Anyway, I thought a cool work by cello that kind of went well with spaghettos maskin in there. A lot of people put out work yesterday. A lot of the heavy hitters here with myth and the myth. Myth James the myth and Rick James two legends. So again, looks like a procreate work from the myth. And just a very nice piece. I'm not sure this might be sold out by now.
00:32:09.584 - 00:32:39.394, Speaker A: Edition of 15. It was going pretty quick when I loaded this up for 20 tezos each. We'll have to check. I'm not sure if we've seen myth's super rare genesis if it's come out yet, but I'll have to check because sometimes I miss stuff and rare. Go take your dogs for a morning stroll. I'm not sure if I've seen this before, so I thought I would just show it and even I'm not sure if it's new or not but it's just you know, I feel like I recognize again the painting. Maybe it's a Monet.
00:32:39.394 - 00:33:09.478, Speaker A: I'm not sure what the original was but very cool. From the Boston dynamics dog artist hope he doesn't mind me calling him that. Sumi reusi with a new work as well. This is on tezos, a digital painting. I have a winged horse in my palm. So pretty kind of a bit of a dark work in terms of the color with a cool contrast here, maybe a bit of hope and some falling. Can't remember what you call these.
00:33:09.478 - 00:33:46.862, Speaker A: Not cupids, there is a word for them, these kind of little winged creatures that are famously in Raphael's work. And anyways kind of a beautiful work here from Sumi. Beautiful background and everything and a nice texture and everything. So that is available for ten tezos in a pretty low edition of eleven. Waste man Goldman. Why does nobody take me? Why does nobody effing take me seriously? Distressed clown so this is a one of one at auction for six. So another somewhat kind of, I mean this is the guy who does the failed artist series.
00:33:46.862 - 00:34:36.113, Speaker A: So another kind of sad work here with these extremely long cigarettes and there's the cigarette pack there done in I think Microsoft paint using like a kind of oil brush. I didn't realize there was an oil brush till I started seeing his work in Microsoft paint. Kappa sage, bad habits but good intentions. So another, this is I'd say pretty classic Kappa work where it's kind of surreal. There's a lot going on and you don't really know what's going on but it's interesting, an interesting Twitter reference here and you know, people hanging out, a lot of people hanging out and just a lot of mysteriousness. So anyways and work by Kappa in the background, a figure with no legs. Nice Nike box or Nike.
00:34:36.113 - 00:34:55.073, Speaker A: Very cool. So just kind of interesting. Capstage 790 edition of 20. Oh, it's already on secondary, let's just see. So it went only for four on primary. So pretty reasonable. Continuing on rustic digital art, la vida 2.0
00:34:55.073 - 00:35:50.550, Speaker A: reboot of la Vida, the origin of the cloud period. So again the crop Mario returns and we see it here on a path to this mountaintop here and we see another crop Mario here with the surreal sky. So another, you know, self, what I'd call self consciously irrational work by rustic digital art. Yuri J with a new work, a one of one and a very interesting work as usual here. Look at again, look at the experimentation that is going on you see the pixels being dragged over here and everything, just the different textures, the surreal space, the octopus. That almost doesn't make sense. Is it painted on the wall? Is it in space? The masked out plant everything about it and look, I mean, more just kind of edgy experimentalism.
00:35:50.550 - 00:36:08.504, Speaker A: Look at this couch here. And then it's just erased through. So pretty edgy. And then this cup that's spilled. So that is at auction for 200 tezos hang out from Uri J. It's not easy. As I've kind of said in earlier episodes, it's not easy to be irrational.
00:36:08.504 - 00:36:43.828, Speaker A: Santiago with an interesting experiment. Tell my story as a fun one. AI and inkscape. So I don't know why, but I'm always a big fan of these kind of structures. It kind of has a Rauschenberg feel to it with all these different images put together. And so anyways, this kind of looks like, you know, almost like a Google image result sort of thing that you might see, because these images almost seem to be somewhat related, but then pretty abstracted. So anyways, interesting edition of 15 is from March 5.
00:36:43.828 - 00:37:13.944, Speaker A: So this is new from Santiago. He has a few others too. Here's another one, a pretty interesting abstract piece. Massive file, 13,000 by 10,000 pixels. Png art from SVG, from cell phone, photo from physical acrylic painting. So traveling through the mediums here with very interesting results, it's tempting to try and open this big. I'm going to take a big risk because my microphone often punishes me for doing stuff like this.
00:37:13.944 - 00:37:30.028, Speaker A: We're taking massive risks here. Look at this. But maybe the rest pays off. So this is what it looks like up close and personal. So super interesting. Very interesting. It looks like, again, SVG.
00:37:30.028 - 00:37:51.022, Speaker A: So it looks like vector. So you can make this infinitely big, but from a distance, it looks like pixelation. Interesting. An artist I don't think I've seen before. Primitive re banishing of the bulls drops tomorrow. And here is a preview. So this is procreate and I thought, quite a good looking work.
00:37:51.022 - 00:38:19.074, Speaker A: And here is the animation of it being made. So just kind of interesting. How are we doing? Okay, I got a run. Very, just kind of nice looking work. So anyway, primitive re, these were super interesting ev builds on Excel spreadsheets. So using this is quite brilliant, isn't it? Using Excel spreadsheets to create. You know, it's almost like a pixelation from a retro screen.
00:38:19.074 - 00:38:42.160, Speaker A: That's what I first thought I saw when I saw these, when I saw this. I mean, it looks like a Atari screen. Like a retro, retro atari screen. But really, it's actually using Excel spreadsheet. So this one here, by the way, went to Vincent van do, and I think it went for two ETH. Twilight pineapple. Same artist Evie builds.
00:38:42.160 - 00:39:09.738, Speaker A: Yeah, sold for 2.1 ETH. So what is that, like, $3,000 for this work here? So that is pretty cool. Interesting choice to leave the window in here, isn't it? The twilight pine, because you would be tempted to not leave it in. So interesting choice. Popple. Popple has a work here, edition of 25, part of the sanitarium series that he's been working on since the start of the year, since Christmas holidays.
00:39:09.738 - 00:39:37.556, Speaker A: Twins of provision, their fates entwined. They share a bite of tainted food and deadly delight. A ritual they performed each night. A twisted act born of fright. Look at all that rhyme. For in this place of death and decay, the twin knew no other way to survive the horrors that held sway than defeat each other, day by day. So, a a a b b, I think, is how you would, uh, categorize that rhyme scheme here.
00:39:37.556 - 00:40:15.974, Speaker A: And pretty interesting work, isn't it? Again, has a bit of a aliens feel to it, and just nice take on what I guess you could call it, pixel art. Nice kind of textured pixel art. You see a similar thing here with one bit necro, or on Instagram, one bit horror, as one bit horror is known. Or one bit necro is known. So interesting, sometimes the sublime can cause such calamity that the human mind can't bear witness. So just a super interesting artist, and 293 likes here, so he's doing well. I think it's a he.
00:40:15.974 - 00:40:31.840, Speaker A: I'm not sure on. On Instagram. I haven't seen any of these minted anywhere. The new ones, which is interesting. Side hustle reappears. So a lot of people minting here, which is why this show has kind of. We're going to run through it here.
00:40:31.840 - 00:41:02.594, Speaker A: So another really cool work by side hustle with a keyboard in it. And just using retro tools here, I picked one of these up, edition of Ten Sky Goodman, with a pair of works that are pretty cool using. I'd call it the trademark chunky pixels here with the gradients and everything. Flower boy at dusk is the name of this one. And let's just look. Sold for seven on primary and sold out. And it pairs with this other one, flower boy at sunrise.
00:41:02.594 - 00:41:27.302, Speaker A: So edition of 15, I would feel if I bought one, I'd have to buy the other. So, yeah, sold for seven on primary. And again, doing a lot of exporting. And again, the trademark chunky pixels from Sky Goodman here. Very interesting work, as usual. Interesting kind of shadow figure here behind the main, I guess we could call it Flower boy. So interesting floor as well.
00:41:27.302 - 00:42:02.912, Speaker A: Again, using, you know, it's similar to these PFP projects that we were looking at, that we were seeing, where each kind of element, the head would be kind of filled a certain way, the background would be treated a certain way. They were kind of canvases for experimentation. Each section, I feel like you see the same thing here, where the wall is being used to experiment a certain way, and then the floor a certain way, the person, the head. So, anyways, interesting. Sculpted in VR, textured in blender and Stalamere GM. And happy Women's Day. Thank you for everything.
00:42:02.912 - 00:42:24.824, Speaker A: And posting a really cool pixel artwork in celebration of Women's Day. You know, in Berlin, it's actually a holiday. I think it might be one of the only places in the world everything shuts down except for restaurants. So just so everybody knows. So interesting. Another happy International Women's Day. And a happy women's Day to everybody out there.
00:42:24.824 - 00:43:04.364, Speaker A: Happy International Women's Day to all the queens out there. This is Debbie T. Breaking barriers and making their mark in the world. And with a classic work, queen of coins and a woman on a computer with Hodl and looking at the charts here and JPEG coins. So celebrating the culture as deputy so expertly does. You know, I can't remember the name of this series, but she put out a whole, you know, it's kind of like a PFP project, but she made it totally original, where she had all of these. She had words at the bottom that were from the crypto space, like LFG, and, you know, whatever the case is.
00:43:04.364 - 00:43:28.344, Speaker A: And then she mixed it with different images on top. It was an extremely cool series. So, anyways, just more cool work from Debbie T. And this is Axstone. I think debbie t retweeted this, and this is on super rare. We've looked at Akstone's work in the past, and so here's a new work and interesting piece. Very defined style that you can recognize immediately.
00:43:28.344 - 00:43:57.654, Speaker A: And basically what looks like a retro tv here, kind of reminiscent of that cello work we're looking at with video games on it that almost look kind of retro here, here. And then people sitting and hanging out with that in the background. So interesting, kind of surreal. Almost looks like a bit of a stream of consciousness work. Who has the remote? Okay, score is the name of the work. Two and a half ETH reserve. So not cheap there, Daniel W.
00:43:57.654 - 00:44:18.564, Speaker A: But good value, I'm sure, and great artists. And she sold, I'm sure, many times for that amount. Daniel W. First nine best bud pieces. Putting these together to announce that starting today, I'll be changing the titles to numbers and officially naming the series best buds. So starting today, we'll have a reset of sorts. And now a thread about these two.
00:44:18.564 - 00:44:41.704, Speaker A: So this is the series that apparently Daniel W. Has been working on for years. And we have these characters here available for only three tazos, up to no good. And so here are the characters. And so, yeah, anyways, you see buds there. Never trust a devil with your stuff. And we have another one, best buds number ten, hot as hell.
00:44:41.704 - 00:45:12.084, Speaker A: So again, you can get some of the early appearances should this ever be turned into a series. Here you can get some of the earlier appearances of these character. First appearances from Daniel W. Flora Marquez, who I never get tired of looking at and who never ceases to inspire and impress. Like, look at how great this work is. March 7, 2023. Adopting what works for us, discarding what hurts us, and we just see more super creativity.
00:45:12.084 - 00:45:35.048, Speaker A: Again. Kind of has a drama feel to it. Like these are, it looks like illustrations made by a costume designer in the very best way or something. You'd see again, like a punch and Judy type thing. It kind of has a surreal element with these beaks on the side here and this beautiful head. So anyways, super cool work. And only selling for 17 tezos.
00:45:35.048 - 00:46:03.664, Speaker A: This sold to Emilio Versace. And another one, a cool mask. Again, you see the kind of theatrical drama side of things here. Don't underestimate the power of a mask. And this sold to mentalist 420, who has, I think, a few of these for 17 tezos as well. So pretty good for a one of one, if you ask me, in terms of value. Elo, brace yourself and just maximize.
00:46:03.664 - 00:46:46.512, Speaker A: So one of my, the most, my favorite trash artists out here, La Lowe, puts out a new one on Tazo, so addition of 25 and that is on secondary for $7.99. And yeah, just sells it for next to nothing on primary for tezos 50 and hardly takes any royalties. So interesting in that respect from Elie Lo, a new one from acid soup. And again, I just think of the modern furniture series, but totally different. And so we saw the hamburger, we saw the donut, and now we see pizza. So still available for $3.33 for three tazos, addition of eleven.
00:46:46.512 - 00:47:04.504, Speaker A: And let's just see how many are left. Still four left. So pretty reasonable. And look at this one by exmortal. You know, I remember these, and I want to call this a pentax. And what do you call these? The word is escaping me. Like a Polaroid.
00:47:04.504 - 00:47:24.520, Speaker A: It's like a Polaroid where, you know. And so, yeah, so a kind of a retro tech that we don't see very often. Axine has one that celebrates these kind of cameras, I'm pretty sure. Six super color available for ten tezos on secondary. Let's just see. Selling for five on primary. So pretty cool.
00:47:24.520 - 00:47:51.444, Speaker A: I mean, you could show that in a. In a gallery and it would just be very cool. This was really cool, too, I think axin retweeted this one. Jpegfam, I think, is the title. A very cool open edition, only six minted at zero one. So another really cool open edition at a low price. This is created by formless, but here it says Corpega ETH.
00:47:51.444 - 00:48:28.374, Speaker A: So maybe formless is the name and corpega is the Twitter account. So I'm not sure exactly the details on the authorship, but it sounds like it's created by formless here. Anyways, pretty cool work. Pretty edgy. I mean, it looks like a flayed person here with blood coming down. And then this crazy web3 ready retro, you know, pixelation. So just out of kind of reminiscent of the artists web art of, like, the late nineties, early two thousands.
00:48:28.374 - 00:48:45.382, Speaker A: Seems like a bit of a hat tip to that. There's a whale in the sun. Just a super interesting work for very cheap. And look at connect Zapta with this work here. I'm going to reload this. It's called homepage. Welcome to my homepage.
00:48:45.382 - 00:49:04.138, Speaker A: A netart, exactly. So, another kind of net art piece. And I'm not sure if this is interactive or not, but I think it loads up different every time. Welcome to my home. And then let's just try loading it. Yeah, you see? So look at that. This is a homepage.
00:49:04.138 - 00:49:31.050, Speaker A: So very. You wonder if Netart could make a comeback here, because the appreciation for it hasn't gone away. Text by chat GPT. So connect Zapta works with AI as well, so you wonder how AI fit into this. There is a write up here. So, anyways, just interesting work available for five tezos edition of 20. And Georgie is back.
00:49:31.050 - 00:50:06.400, Speaker A: Immaterialism will be the name of the next collection on foundation. So it seems like a slight development on the last works that we're seeing from Georgie here. So that is really interesting to watch it evolve. We'll have to look at some of those earlier works, and once he puts out more and compare, because it looks like there is an evolution going on here. Shout out to Georgie, who was on the spaces a couple of weeks ago. Always great to hear from you and see you, Scott Goodman, with another one. I kind of put this in the AI section because it seemed like a little bit more AI.
00:50:06.400 - 00:50:39.662, Speaker A: Beautiful colors. And I also really like, I mean, this beautiful outline here almost has, like, a Renaissance Madonna type feel to it. Almost like you almost could, you know, back up and see, like the Madonna and child here in the outline. But we're looking at a shoe AI glitch art, and so a lot of exporting a part of the lost sneaker series by Sky Goodman. More AI sneakers this time, courtesy of strange thing. How are we doing? Okay, we're almost done here. Beautiful, beautiful.
00:50:39.662 - 00:51:13.214, Speaker A: Look at this. I mean, beautiful work from strange thing, making it look very easy. So from my just layperson's point of view here on the AI, look at this. Strange thing continued to really prove himself with each work and series of works, like really next level AI here. Look at the rubber boots. Super creativity and coming up with super results here. Look at this.
00:51:13.214 - 00:51:50.894, Speaker A: And it looks like using some, it looks very high resolution as well as, I guess, where I'm going with this. So it continues to be super interesting. From strange thing, AI, assortment of footwear inspired by the Renaissance period, from masters of the arts, architecture, and current textiles of the time. So he puts that a lot, too. So it really, again, kind of smart marketing with all the repetition, because it really drills the point home, what he's doing. He is the guy that does the AI art fashion in Renaissance style. Human boy, also celebrating International Women's Day.
00:51:50.894 - 00:52:27.736, Speaker A: Make sure you take the time to let the women in your life know how much they mean to you. And they never stop doing that every day. I took my girlfriend out for dinner last night, actually. We went to a very famous, a place in Berlin, Maxen Moritz, if anybody's ever been there, where you get the schnitzel and a beer, and it is super classic. Anyways, a beautiful work by human boy, celebrating women's day. And speaking of which, the muses by Danielle King. Danielle just put out this is a, I think what we'd call a generative work, but it's also AI because there's 500 of them.
00:52:27.736 - 00:53:00.804, Speaker A: And so let me just show you. So you see all of them here. So different women represented here, and let's just look. The muses is a generative AI art project that examines the portrayal of women in art history and fashion. So also working with fashion and AI. So the project reimagines the concept of the artist's muse by using source images and prompts from a diverse range of artists and designers from the renaissance to now. Through this process, 500 unique portraits of imagined women are generated, each with her own distinct name.
00:53:00.804 - 00:53:33.962, Speaker A: So very cool series. So that is Danielle King. And finally, Shilly, the kid with an interesting work made with Dali. And I feel like these textures to me are trademark Daly textures, aren't they? Like, I feel like we can start to recognize sometimes. If someone asked me, which AI program do you think made this? I would have said Dal e with these beautiful kind of painterly textures here. So someone had a computer. This town series two, nice piece, edition of 20, 519 left.
00:53:33.962 - 00:54:04.516, Speaker A: So still a few left here. And kind of would hang very well with Zoom sums work. And again, it kind of has the Daly textures, if I had to guess here, and I think she mentioned that on earlier works. So anyways, a nice kind of almost abstract room here. So again, kind of veering towards abstraction as we started this episode with Michael Macasso there. Very reasonably priced. One of one for 35 tazos for all you AI and one of one collectors out there.
00:54:04.516 - 00:54:25.140, Speaker A: That is a very reasonable price. Clownvamp with a work. This was from a couple of weeks ago, but I realized, I didn't realize I wasn't following Clownvamp, so I missed all sorts of work. So I wanted to show one. And here is one by Clownvamp. And this is part of the detective Jack series. So anyways, that has been fixed.
00:54:25.140 - 00:55:03.030, Speaker A: And I thought just kind of a pretty cool, what I'd consider a fairly abstract, although that is debatable. Maybe it's part of the series. It's an explosion or something of a car, who knows what? But I just thought a really cool kind of AI abstract work. And also playing with circles here, Marina Amidova, edition of 15. And she has a few of these AI works working with bubbles and so slightly different feel and texture to these works. Everlasting feminine composition three, maybe, perhaps that was also done for Women's Day. AI artist Marina Amidova.
00:55:03.030 - 00:55:23.054, Speaker A: So always good to see her minting. And here's Ilay, also playing with the circles theme, lightness. Number 19. AI pathway with some beautiful textures on here. So very impressive, especially when you look at, say, I really like the white of the clouds here. So painterly. And again, we were seeing that with some of the code.
00:55:23.054 - 00:55:56.930, Speaker A: Remember those people that we're seeing on Twitter who are making very persuasive and convincing brush. Kind of like, looks like it was physically painted, but they're using pure code. That's what this reminds me of here with the AI renders that we're getting. It's getting more and more convincing, isn't it? So anyway, cool work by Ilay, available for two tezos and still four left. I think I picked one up, Quilania, with the physical work as we wrap up here. Mama Oklo. So I believe this is oil and acrylic on canvas.
00:55:56.930 - 00:56:22.662, Speaker A: And again, kind of these visionary works from Quila Nina. She's out of Argentina and Peru. So, yeah, so just really beautiful, beautiful work here. Acrylic and oil on canvas, inspired by the tarot card, the empress. Some more tarot, which is interesting too. And look at this work in progress soon in exhibition Munich art Mook and on object.com pokebally.
00:56:22.662 - 00:56:59.794, Speaker A: So we were commenting, we were commenting on this work that we saw, that I saw, you know, a few weeks ago, maybe a month or so ago. So here it is in progress. It is a physical work and a very cool, very cool physical work. Very impressive physical work by jam. So shout out to jam. And also docanti draws with a pretty cool, also physical work in Lithuanian, we call this gym exercise Wayne Salt. So that is the name of the piece here.
00:56:59.794 - 00:57:15.884, Speaker A: So another beautiful work with colored pencils on what looks like paper. It's another physical NFT. And there are. This went on primary for two, only two tezos, and now it is for ten. Very cool. And look at this. Ed Marolla.
00:57:15.884 - 00:57:41.560, Speaker A: We're tying the bow here. Let's get physical. Making physical work. So that is a ton of fun. And that is really exciting, isn't it? Just as an artist and as a collector and just everything. It's just really exciting to see a pixel artist like Ed, who's so original and creative, showing the physical work. So that is just super interesting and fun and kind of exciting.
00:57:41.560 - 00:58:31.176, Speaker A: Here's another physical work by walk. And I thought, just such an interesting subject matter. It looks like Cinderella putting on the slipper here, but done with a walk type treatment. And almost like what I find so interesting about this work is it takes the cartoon kind of hard outlines of cartoons, but then starts applying shading to it, and then also redoes it by removing the color. So first adding gradients and like, this kind of texture. So kind of reimagining a way of like, transforming that, you know, what could be like an animation still, you know, and then really kind of, I thought I think just really original and easy, kind of very subtle what's going on here. And finally, here's an artist that you may or may not have seen, Julia Wachtell.
00:58:31.176 - 00:59:08.224, Speaker A: I feel like she should have like a hundred thousand followers from everything I've seen of her work. But she's only got like 6000, which is still a lot. But I mean, she looks like she shows in, you know, pretty major galleries from what I could tell. Michael Margeris is another really interesting artist. So anyways, just another interesting artist here. And I particularly thought that last one, this one here was, it's just pretty interesting. Again, hard contrast between this kind of cartoon and now here's like painterly gradients and with an interesting semi opaque layer of white on top.
00:59:08.224 - 00:59:21.884, Speaker A: And here's another interesting work. So this is woven tapestries by Aaron M. Riley. Okay. And so kind of edgy content here. Nothing too crazy. But look, these are tapestries.
00:59:21.884 - 00:59:41.412, Speaker A: So pretty interesting tapestry work here. So just more interesting physical work out there outside of the NFT scene as far as I understand. Look at that. So tapestry, that is your show, everyone. Thank you for joining me. I apologize for the show being so long. I will.
00:59:41.412 - 00:59:53.284, Speaker A: There's just too much out there. What would you cut, you know? Anyway, until next time. Oh, until next time, my friends. Take care.
