00:00:02.920 - 00:00:25.434, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody. I kind of want to be in this painting right now that looks like a delicious red wine. I can almost feel it by looking at it. Lavon with another just very warm still life here. Welcome back. Artist Journal, July 31, 2023. Broadcasting from a calm, smooth, sunny sea in inner space.
00:00:25.434 - 00:01:16.308, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and I welcome you back with this very warm work. I hope you had a. As fun a weekend as it looks like Lavon is having in this work here. This is the good life, isn't it? A glass of wine, a your little ledger, your little financial video game here, you know, to store your crypto safely. And looking at your, you know, block zero here, looking at your nfts, there's a rain in the background. And this almost reminiscent of being in a plane looking down at the city, reflecting on your life. And this wonderful light here, beautifully painted again by Lavon, who his trademark is very much these still life works that look very kind of oil paint, that look very painterly.
00:01:16.308 - 00:01:48.774, Speaker A: They look like oil paintings. Edition of 15 and sold out at taking offers from 32 to 50 tezos. So very nice take there for Lavon, probably about 400 and 5500 tezos. Very nice work. And for those that want to see up close, here it is. So, again, kind of has a Renoir feel to it, doesn't it? Especially in the flowers there. And just, you see how much work goes into this.
00:01:48.774 - 00:02:30.422, Speaker A: Like, look at how beautiful the brushwork on the glasses is and even how it reflects here on the label of the wine bottle, fleur de Pingais. So, yeah, so just very beautiful work here. We see the painterly table, the beautiful laptop, every little letter and number here in this hash. This block hash is readable, which is interesting. So just very cool. And you even see, I mean, you wonder, is this rain? So very loose and very nice. And even the impressionistic lightning here.
00:02:30.422 - 00:02:51.830, Speaker A: So just very cool from Levon. So great work here. And for those that might not remember, remember, scene from. If you're wondering who this is, remember scene from a high school where they're teaching NFTs, which was. I'm sure that's happening somewhere. I'm sure that's happening somewhere. What's ironic about that, it's probably 99% of the people in this scene just kind of figured it out on their own.
00:02:51.830 - 00:03:15.270, Speaker A: But, I mean, this is. This is gonna happen sooner or later. So more just. And we've looked at Lavon's work now for months, and just an awesome artist. And you see it's kind of part of this series here, still life unwind, you know, with a, there's the gun, the red wine and the laptop and looking off into a moody atmosphere. So just great work. There is NFT biker.
00:03:15.270 - 00:03:27.534, Speaker A: So cool work. I mean, born 1995. Born 1995. So Lavon, still in his twenties, I think. Yeah, still in his twenties. Nice work. Thank you for the comments.
00:03:27.534 - 00:03:54.596, Speaker A: Thank you for the hair comments. I just tell the hairdresser, you do your thing and she goes and it's great. And thank you, Zach Lloyd I seem to remember placewise Gamma had their original Tez wallet get hacked a while back. That is true. I think they switched from Versum to object around March or so. Yeah, because we were commenting how Francois Gamma was super. Like almost everything was being released on versum.
00:03:54.596 - 00:04:22.248, Speaker A: And maybe after the hack, that's when we saw the 2009 series. And you can do that on object. That's one of the great things about object is you can make series, and I'm not sure if you can do that on Versim or even tea. So again, thank you for the haircut comments. And thank you leprochant. We're going to look at Leprechant's work in progress here in a second. Mikhail Knowlson interesting comment here.
00:04:22.248 - 00:05:31.218, Speaker A: Was listening to the art angle podcast from Artnet a couple of days ago, was disappointed but not surprised on their coverage of the Pollock NFT series. So this was totally new to news to me. Maybe a lot of you have heard about this setting. I brought it up here, setting out the conversation by muddying its success with suspicions of mass wash trading and continuing on to say there wasn't much happening art wise with NFTs. But I have to say I almost want to listen to it so I can hear this, because for me, like that, that makes me really happy and excited in a weird sort of way, in a sense. If Artnet is talking about everything that we're going to look out, look at today, it kind of makes this program almost pointless. But as long as they're saying this is all worthless and there's no point and nothing's going on art wise with NFTs, then this say this show has a purpose, right? And so that makes me actually, you know what this reminds me of? It's sort of like going to like an art show that you don't love as an artist.
00:05:31.218 - 00:06:20.054, Speaker A: That makes me excited because then I start to go, oh, you know, if this is what people are doing or what the establishment is pushing, well, maybe I have a chance after all. So I kind of get weirdly bullish when I see that happen. So much casual dismissal and a lack of real investigation into their opinions is what this space is up against. Yeah. And I think it really is about awareness. I don't think we discussed this about like, the blue chip galleries, the work that we look at here. I simply just don't think they're aware because again, many people who are in the, you know, what you could call the NFT scene are not aware, one could argue, of what's happening, say, deep on tezos and other places too deep on the blockchain.
00:06:20.054 - 00:07:35.234, Speaker A: I was on for a year, a year and a half before I discovered object and started digging deep and started to see what was happening at the grassroots of a open platform, non gated digital art, really what I call a digital art revolution. What was happening from the grassroots, it's a very unique thing. It's global, it is digital, it is a free market. It's kind of like the best of all worlds. And it costs you a few cents to mint your work on the. On tazos, at least where a lot of people get started, particularly if they're from, you know, countries that aren't that rich. So again, it kind of makes me hugely bullish when people say from Artnet or, you know, Artnet media or people from the establishment media are just, you know, I just don't think they're aware because, again, and I don't even really blame them that much because where are they going to find out without kind of going deep, deep into object or going deep, deep on Twitter and spending a huge amount of time.
00:07:35.234 - 00:08:07.106, Speaker A: I mean, so maybe as journalists, you can blame them, but. And you can blame, you know, but I'm not surprised. Like, what would surprise me is if they did know about this and they were talking about how great cogolitis new work was and how pixel art where there's something really going on there that would blow my mind. And I actually think that'll happen. But I hope it's five years away. I hope it's ten years away. I hope, like, the longer we kind of have this to ourselves, the happier I am.
00:08:07.106 - 00:08:37.878, Speaker A: And maybe it never catches on. Who knows? So here is the work here, let me just kill this. So this is Artnet. The Jackson Pollock studio's first NFT collection sold out in mere hours, raking in more than $450,000. So the people that run Jackson Pollock's studio took photos of the floor. And maybe it's like a kind of museum now of sorts, not 3 hours. Let's just take a closer look here.
00:08:37.878 - 00:09:22.812, Speaker A: Not 3 hours after the mint commenced for the Jackson Pollock studio's first NFT collection on July 19, the digital artifacts were snapped up entirely, raking in more than $450,000 in transactions. So sold out in 3 hours. Titled beyond the Edge, the series, released by the studio in partnership with web3 platform iconic, offered collectors for individual NFTs. Featuring Pollock's paint stained studio floor in additions of 100, plus a set of all four NFTs in an edition of 25. Priced at eight ETH or $1,500 each. The NFTs come bundled with hand numbered museum quality prints. So I kind of have mixed feelings about it.
00:09:22.812 - 00:09:52.830, Speaker A: And on one hand, I think they're actually pretty cool. They're pretty. You know, it's kind of like if you're a Jackson Pollock fan, especially. It kind of, you know, does echo Pollock Pollock's work in a pretty nice way. And it's kind of a fun concept. I guess my reservations on this whole idea is. I mean, the first sort of thought that comes into my mind is.
00:09:52.830 - 00:10:14.056, Speaker A: Well clearly Jackson Pollock did not approve this. Right? So there is. And who is the Jackson Pollock studio? And there's something perhaps using a name that. To sell work. I mean I don't. You know, I'm trying to. I'm dancing around this word.
00:10:14.056 - 00:10:37.962, Speaker A: There's something a little cash grabby about it, let's put it this way. And it's not unique. And it's. And I don't know if I would say they shouldn't do it. It's reminiscent of what I saw for those that have been watching this program for a while. Remember, if you can remember, maybe six months ago, we were looking up Magrit on artsy. And maybe we should do that.
00:10:37.962 - 00:11:05.314, Speaker A: And what we saw was a work from 2010. And you go, well, Magritte's not even alive. And they're making new prints and then selling them under Magritte's name. Let's just see if we can find. That. Was it this? There were Magrittes from 2010 and that just made no sense, right? Not sure. Look, 2002.
00:11:05.314 - 00:11:30.316, Speaker A: So. So it's kind of like a similar idea. Like en famille, 2002. Well, Magritte died probably in the sixties, I'm assuming. So what on earth is this? And then it's signed and numbered as if by the artist. This print is made by the estate after the original painting. So again, like to me, I also see cash grabby here.
00:11:30.316 - 00:11:57.764, Speaker A: Okay, like to me, I don't think. Actually I think you can do this. If you own the intellectual property. Let's say if you're the family, you can do it. But I just have a huge amount of reservations there, because I'm looking up Renee Magritte when I go to artsy. And maybe I want to buy a real Magritte. I don't know if I'd consider this a quote unquote authentic real magritte.
00:11:57.764 - 00:12:21.348, Speaker A: Right. And it's kind of. And it's more using the Magritte name to sell stuff. And how much? This is $600, right? I mean, kind of not that far from the same price that we're looking at over, like, look, all the real, quote, unquote real magrittes are sold, interestingly. Okay. Contact for price. This one's 1947.
00:12:21.348 - 00:12:43.064, Speaker A: So, yeah, it's reminiscent of the Magritte. Okay. Within a two and a half hour window, 440 pairs of the official works were sold. Pairs were sold. One minted out in 32 minutes. So, Chris Cummings, founder and CEO of Iconic. So this is a story behind it.
00:12:43.064 - 00:13:25.704, Speaker A: The moment I saw Pollock studio floor, I knew that we could create a groundbreaking digital artifact release that collectors would love. But to see it play out before your eyes is something very moving. I'm overwhelmed by the momentum around the project and the support we've experienced for the collection. So, you know, and it does bring up the whole physical NFT debate as well, which is, you know, this perennial question is, are physical nfts as collectible as. Nfts of physical works as collectible as kind of purely digital? Which is a whole other debate. There's pranksy. So pranksy, I think, got in on it and bought some.
00:13:25.704 - 00:14:04.292, Speaker A: So I'm kind of always back to kind of a live and let live sort of mentality, which is if people want to sell it and people want to buy it, maybe more importantly, then who's to criticize that? And so, yeah, and here people said Pollux work was not art. People said digital NFT art is not art. 21st century. Yeah. So I just think this is mixing and compare. I'm not sure if these comparisons really hold in my mind, because, again, this isn't about. This isn't Pollock's art.
00:14:04.292 - 00:14:34.966, Speaker A: This is paint that fell from Pollock's brushes and cans and how he's like, you know, and that he never. This isn't Pollock. Okay? Because Pollock never signed off on it. Yes, Pollock made the drips. But to call this a Pollock work, to me, this is maybe the main point that crosses a line in terms of the artist might be thrilled today to see that. And be happy they're in the news and that they're still being talked about. Or maybe Pollock would be very annoyed.
00:14:34.966 - 00:15:11.062, Speaker A: Maybe Pollock would not be happy at all that his name is now being put on all this other stuff that he had nothing to do with than to prove or anything. So that's where I start to kind of. Yeah. Where I feel like maybe, just maybe, this starts to cross a line a little bit, just as that Magritte work is kind of almost a false representation of, you know, I thought I was buying a real Magritte on artsy. So the debate continues. Unknown collector art on Tezos historically definitely will be known as the coolest place for art on the blockchain in the future. As one of the coolest places.
00:15:11.062 - 00:15:34.574, Speaker A: Yeah, absolutely. It already is. Yes. And I agree with this word right here. I do think what's happening is historical. Again, a digital art, you know, grassroots, non gated, open platform. Doesn't cost anything, you know, no kind of financial constraints, really, to starting.
00:15:34.574 - 00:15:52.188, Speaker A: That's. Yeah, like, there's a lot going. Just that in itself is, to me, historical. And the fact that we actually have some great art on it is just kind of seals the deal. The amount of art that just doesn't give an f is insane. That's where a movement starts. That's where history starts.
00:15:52.188 - 00:16:26.134, Speaker A: Art for the sake of art. And. Yeah, so I agree. I think this is historical. I think unquestionably, because if you're. How could you ignore this in the history of art? You know, to me, I mean, at least in my own private mind, you know, view, it's like, how on earth could you ignore such so much interesting art? And again, it feels very much. If I had to characterize that art, it's very much the second generation of digital art, which is art that was by people who grew up with video games.
00:16:26.134 - 00:16:47.366, Speaker A: It's kind of like that simple, and let's leave it there. Continuing on, Charles. AI, I will always deeply respect and admire artists who do this full time. Absolutely. I can't even begin to imagine the amount of stress one must go through knowing you need to sell art to pay your rent or food. I for sure know I couldn't handle it. Yeah, I'm kind of.
00:16:47.366 - 00:17:07.138, Speaker A: Of the mind that I. First of all, I. Yeah, I would find that incredibly stressful. And I think the way to go about it is you start making a whole bunch of good sales, because, like, I mean, guys like, die with the most likes. Axe. I mean, I know Dai with the most likes. As far last I heard, was still working.
00:17:07.138 - 00:17:55.652, Speaker A: You know, Oxyn was a graphic designer, I assume still is in some capacity. But I suppose the real time to make the leap is, I mean, when you kind of reach their level as far as sales and you start going, well, am I going to make more money by putting my time into art, or am I going to make more money by doing my job and doing this on the side? And when you start to say, I'm going to make more money with the art consistently, well, then you can probably start to think about it. I mean, you can do it before, too. A lot of people do, and some heroic stories have happened, but I very much sympathize to what Charles AI is saying. Zancam. So we saw the blue bird in a previous episode. So now we're seeing, I assume it's art matter.
00:17:55.652 - 00:18:32.216, Speaker A: It's a pen plotter at work here may or may not be art matter, and there's a few interesting things here. So this pen is hypnotic, first of all. And second of all, look, it's making like a watercolor here. You see, it's almost like the ink is being pooled. So that is kind of interesting in itself. And here it's almost like a marker, the edges here, but it's being emulated by this pen. So we're very much traveling through the mediums here.
00:18:32.216 - 00:19:01.382, Speaker A: And the pen plotter continues to just excite. I mean, yeah, I mean, if you didn't realize you need a pen plotter before, like, here's just more evidence that we should be, you know, finding art matters discord and joining as fast as possible. So just hypnotic. Here, let me continue on because we have another one. Look at this. Excuse me. I've come up with the most ridiculously inefficient code for plotting a background.
00:19:01.382 - 00:19:52.574, Speaker A: This job has been running for 10 hours and counting. And this brings up an interesting point, too, which is the importance of coding to making the art. And I've never been a huge, you know, needing to code to make art and this sort of thing just from a personal basis, but, you know, to make, say, generative art. It's just never been my strong sort of interest, even though I like a lot of generative art. But put it this way, I wasn't going to learn how to code to make digital art, but I would learn how to code to make this, because any functionality I can start to do, I would find this a reason to learn code. This is a reason to learn code here for me, just very interesting and cool. And I love how inefficient it is.
00:19:52.574 - 00:20:36.988, Speaker A: I mean, again, what we're seeing is novel mark making here with these pen plotters, and that in itself is quite an accomplishment. So Zancane with a couple of really cool videos also in the studio. Demon ego. Demon ego showing really the dexterity and virtuosity as he draws a finger here just out of midair, just kind of look at how simple he makes it look. So demon ego, there's that cutting board and making it look so easy and just going at it. So just very, very, very cool to see this. So manual pen plotting, one could say, and just very nice work there.
00:20:36.988 - 00:21:09.656, Speaker A: So that is demon ego in the studio. And finally a lenticular print. So we're looking at this as a solution for gifts because you can show more than one. I don't know if you'd call it layer. I don't really know how lenticular prints are made, but you see there's variation when you go from one side to the other. And so this is kind of conducive to gifts, the movement of gifts. So isn't this interesting to see how big this can go? We're looking at very small ones that popple and explainer gallery were doing.
00:21:09.656 - 00:21:30.376, Speaker A: Maybe six to 12 cm. This thing looks huge. So pretty interesting. And that is Rafael Rosendahl, an xx large lenticular in Tokyo. We are global here. And finally leprochant with another studio shot. So remember the Ppkop offline edition, this ambitious work here.
00:21:30.376 - 00:21:59.794, Speaker A: And let's just see, there's a bit of a, another kind of very nice, like in the studio video here, a very nicely put together video. So you see the mask being put together, kind of haunting mask, very haunting mask. Even the eyebrows kind of beautifully, kind of trimmed and everything. Pretty impressive. These videos are fantastic. Just an awesome pr. Like just very cool.
00:21:59.794 - 00:22:36.826, Speaker A: Also in the IrL Sabato shrimp rave, a very early drawing exercise, looking lit in Montreal. It sure is. And so one assumes this is on a projector and that it's moving. So just very cool. I love this room as well. And just the one chair there, so that is cool. And loac me working with verse and verse works, which is kind of interestingly straddling, you might say, web3 and the traditional art world quite well in their own, you know, specific way.
00:22:36.826 - 00:23:09.836, Speaker A: We're delighted to invite you to our upcoming verse talks with Lawack me a conversation on space and time hosted by verseworks Mimin Gyan, Mimi and Chiltopa. So this is August 3. So of course Loekme makes these really cool, dithered, semi abstract works here so that you can check out. That could be really interesting on. That's a spacesuit from verse, so just go to their feed. So going into some paintings. Here we are back with, you know, the artist.
00:23:09.836 - 00:23:33.594, Speaker A: This is our friend, rare GM creation. What a great title. Repainting a masterpiece is daunting matter. The little details, things you never saw from a piece of art that is so ubiquitous with art in general. I kept having to take a break and stepping back, but I would love to share my latest commission. So, pretty nicely painted here. Got the colors almost exactly here.
00:23:33.594 - 00:23:57.410, Speaker A: And, of course, the creation of Adam. Adam has been replaced with spot here, the Boston dynamics dog here, and beautifully painted and everything. So the creation of spot, a brilliant pastiche here from rare. Great to see and just very cool. A commission. Look at this. Great combination.
00:23:57.410 - 00:24:30.074, Speaker A: Santiago and the myth coast of absolute dissolution. So I kind of love how this turned out in the sense that Santiago's abstraction seems to be almost like a mental image of the myth's mind. And how cool is that? And beautifully kind of roughly painted by the myth. And look at this. All of these clouds, these myth clouds, these trademark myth clouds kind of get disassembled here. Dissembled. And just beautiful work here.
00:24:30.074 - 00:24:53.184, Speaker A: And I brought it up close here. These are 50 tezos, by the way, on secondary. Let's just see what Happened. Only 20 tezos on primary sold out in about. It took maybe two or 3 hours there for them to sell out. Interesting. There were 20, so made a quick 400 tezos, 200 tezos each.
00:24:53.184 - 00:25:19.640, Speaker A: And I brought it up close here for us to look at. Let's see if it works. Here we go. So, again, you see almost these vector like shapes here from Santiago contrasting with the myth. And the bleeding eye here, the lemonhead and everything you see. Look at all the detail that's in this work. It's a massive file, and you see all the awesome drawing and their beautiful roughness of myth's work.
00:25:19.640 - 00:25:49.594, Speaker A: And look at these beautiful details here, the beautiful brushwork by the myth here, and also just more details here. Nice to put that pixelation there a little bit contrasting with what looks like SVG or some sort of vector. So just very cool here. Another massive file. LEt's just look at the clouds. You see how it goes. It starts getting dissembled here.
00:25:49.594 - 00:26:06.794, Speaker A: So cool work from myth in santiago. And continuing on, this was someone who I don't think I've ever seen before. Lucioti. Lucio. Just a cool painting here. Echo chambers by now, for 0.25. Just listed.
00:26:06.794 - 00:26:32.754, Speaker A: Based on a tribute to Francois de Goya by my grandfather. So this is based on a work by this art by Liszoy's grandfather that was paying homage to Goya. So I actually brought up that image here. So just an interesting artwork here. Interesting digital painting. Echo chamber is now on foundation. You can see the original painting below.
00:26:32.754 - 00:26:52.974, Speaker A: So this work here is by the grandfather. So which is a homage to Goya. I wonder if we see Goya's work here. No, we don't. That would be interesting, though, wouldn't it? So very cool and quite a. Quite an interpretation. Like quite a distant interpretation, which is also cool.
00:26:52.974 - 00:27:18.778, Speaker A: Aksin maybe commenting on the new Twitter here. X with a visual commentary here. The businessperson and the alien. So incorporating a lot of things we're seeing in the news here. And the skeletal business person, and they're looking at X on a screen of sorts, on a tablet of sorts. So very cool here from Ukzene. Not minted, as far as I know.
00:27:18.778 - 00:27:50.268, Speaker A: Bezaya with a work in progress. Pink is bullish, so playing again with that kind of wallpapery design and not the paradise series. And just a very kind of detailed bull with a ton of, kind of wrinkled skin here and almost all in pink, except for the gold hoofs, the mouth, the eyes, and these awesome horns. So great color, as usual. Pink is bullish. Bezaya, work in progress. Another animal, Dan control.
00:27:50.268 - 00:28:26.984, Speaker A: Sean. So a picture of a sheep and a pretty interesting solution. Of course, a sheep has pretty interesting texture. So Dan, almost working with that challenge and then just puts a circular gradient, I think quite successfully thanks to this mask here, or this edge, which really worked out. And a great background, again of a massive, you know, what looks like one gradient in one pole here. So cool work here. Ten tezos on primary edition of ten and five have sold.
00:28:26.984 - 00:28:55.766, Speaker A: So nice take from dan Control. Lucena guerra. Guerra or guerrero? Guerra. This is a 4500 x 6000, a kind of paradise, kind of a surprisingly symmetrical work. I mean, we saw Luciana's work before and it was more chaotic. So this is quite interesting, kind of the change in the central composition here. So just interesting work.
00:28:55.766 - 00:29:23.814, Speaker A: And this is on super rare. And I think Miquel actually was, uh, was posting this. It almost feels a little bit, especially here, like the garden of earthly delights by Hieronymus Bosch. The whole thing, even here, it feels like a kind of tribute to. To me, uh, painting inspired in the perceptions I used to have between reality and imagination. Includes a beautiful gicle print that is very cool. 60 by 80.
00:29:23.814 - 00:29:37.754, Speaker A: That's not small. So cool work. A kind of paradise. Maybe a reference there to Bosch. And sold for 0.45. So that is a pretty good price there too. Half an ETH.
00:29:37.754 - 00:29:50.712, Speaker A: Matthias Moreno was the top of the charts here. And you're going to recognize the illustrator. Yesterday, after the drop of the grief, I was the top one creator on object. Y'all put me in that place. I'm still moved. I can't get over it. Thanks for your love.
00:29:50.712 - 00:30:11.924, Speaker A: I went from hell to heaven. Art rescued me once again. So here is the work, and it's a pretty beautiful, detailed work here. And it is now 84 tezos on secondary. Let's just quickly look here. So accepted offers between 37 and 125. That is pretty good.
00:30:11.924 - 00:30:33.796, Speaker A: 125. So that is a pretty nice take. Edition of 25. So again, pretty nice work here. And what I really liked about it was there's also a black and white version, which is interesting. Let's just bring that up now. This, I wonder, look, ink work version of the piece, the grief.
00:30:33.796 - 00:30:54.884, Speaker A: So I wonder if this is physical. Not clear to me if this is on an iPad or. Or not. So just kind of interesting. And the physical is actually a lot more expensive on secondary. Only five are available. So kind of a cool way of, you know, making multiple versions of one work.
00:30:54.884 - 00:31:18.034, Speaker A: You know, do the black and white, do it. Limited edition, I think, really smartly sold. It's very collectible, it's very fun, and it's great to see these different versions. There's a little bitcoin at the back there. And look at this. There's something to be said for putting a lot of work in the preparation here, the grief. So this is Matthias Morano's website.
00:31:18.034 - 00:31:45.584, Speaker A: And here is the work in a nice fancy frame. And just all about the painting here. So pretty powerful. And look, I mean, at the top of the charts on object, available now, view by on object. So I think that's really interesting in many ways, the way this is being sold. And big congrats on the sales. And even look at these roses here.
00:31:45.584 - 00:32:16.864, Speaker A: I mean, a ton of work and preparation went into this. Pretty impressive. More kind of innovation here. Gloomtube. So this is 9500 tezos on primary. So you're going, what's the deal here? What is going on? The digital artist in residence program card holders of this card are guaranteed one edition of every new multi edition release by GloomTube. So every new multi edition that GloomTube releases, you will get as well as five physical paintings over the course of a year.
00:32:16.864 - 00:32:48.048, Speaker A: Physical paintings applied to the original purchaser only, not to secondary sales. So pretty interesting sales technique. Digital artist in residence. So 9505 paintings in every multi edition from here on in. So interesting move from gloomtube, DK. Now, you might know DK. I'm not sure if it's still on Cosimo de Medici's page here.
00:32:48.048 - 00:33:29.432, Speaker A: Shall we quickly look, cos. Is it cozumo? Maybe it's with a k. How do I not know this? Cosimo de Medici. That is the original Cosimo? Because usually Cosimo. Let's go with that. Duh. Well, now I'm kind of sad.
00:33:29.432 - 00:34:02.122, Speaker A: Let's just see if we can find. No, this is not. Clearly not the right person. DK was pinned on Cosimo's page forever. And let me just try one more time here. Cosimo de medici just put rada. Because I know.
00:34:02.122 - 00:34:15.394, Speaker A: Cause here we go. I was spelling it Cozumel. Cosmo de Medici. Yeah. So I guess it's not pinned there anymore. For a very long time, a work by DK was pinned here, so. Okay, so we figured that out.
00:34:15.394 - 00:34:40.364, Speaker A: DK edition. So. So all to say, DK has a lot of collectors because he was pinned on Cosimo's page there for months and months. So now let me just show you. So just put out an addition. What, the font? And so here's the work. And kind of like an illustrator style here.
00:34:40.364 - 00:35:10.921, Speaker A: And playing with the user interface. Kind of really nicely done here of illustrator 2023. And showing a person kind of being moving around and illustrated. Going into three d a little bit and kind of. Yeah, getting probably recreated each time using the text tool, interestingly. So, playing with identity here. The last one on Cosimo's page was had the kind of the life cycle, which is why I think Cosmo liked it.
00:35:10.921 - 00:35:36.470, Speaker A: So these are not cheap. They sold out addition of 50, and now they're going for how much? Offers are coming in at different prices here. So the highest offer is 0.3, and that is not being or 62. So, yeah, so here we go. DK editions. So the cheapest one you can get is 1.69.
00:35:36.470 - 00:36:07.990, Speaker A: And I think it was this that was just listed, if I'm not mistaken here. So here are a few others and three ETH, 1.69. So just kind of interesting to see this here. I don't think we've looked at DK's work before, but I recognized it. Continuing on, Timothy julien with an addition of ten. Again, kind of playing with this, you know, Roy Lichtenstein type style, playing with outlines and filling it in with just various patterning here. Nice addition here.
00:36:07.990 - 00:36:28.566, Speaker A: This is kind of a new innovation here by Timothy Julienne. This rad that follows, that plays with the space here. So nice move there. And keeping it interesting. Only 50 tezos cents. A few more user interfaces. We've seen Sergeant Slaughtermelon before with these.
00:36:28.566 - 00:36:59.476, Speaker A: Sometimes things just get old with these kind of revised, edited user interfaces, kind of Windows 95 interfaces and just kind of replacing, substituting, you know, struggling. You're gone. You're busy. Well, substituting the text and playing with these user interfaces to create commentary. All my choices are illusions. And here's another one. Choose as if you could just embrace it.
00:36:59.476 - 00:37:13.586, Speaker A: Fate, chance. So kind of again, playing with that big life theme. Freedom is mysterious. Choose new truth, despair, chemistry. Is there room in your life for mystery? Free will require that. So forced to. So a little bit of humor there too.
00:37:13.586 - 00:37:40.726, Speaker A: Cider with a couple of more beautiful works here. So here, I don't think we looked at these. A cherry, a beautiful square cherry, beautifully distorted with even this great pink around the sides here. Beautiful black background, beautifully treated. I don't know how cider does it, but really interesting, again, would hang really well with graphica. And this looks like a peach. So quite brilliant work here.
00:37:40.726 - 00:37:58.360, Speaker A: Or maybe a nectarine. Not sure. Very cool. Maybe an orange. I'm not sure what that is. Cider with more beautiful work. Demon ego, the desert of changes I swim without having how much time, without knowing how much time I have.
00:37:58.360 - 00:38:23.784, Speaker A: So we are working through this episode, folks. Look at this. I thought this was quite interesting. I mean, almost like these, I don't want to say Carvaggio esque over here. At least the way the light is being done, the drama. But some sort of figures here and playing with the, almost like the CMYk processing and everything. And just some interesting animation.
00:38:23.784 - 00:38:50.444, Speaker A: So rather than the dithering, playing with the print process, but also. But keeping it a gif and keeping it moving and kind of a mysterious subject matter here. This kind of beast figure doing not sure what and hand coming out. Just an interesting work by demon ego edition of nine. A surreal work. Eleven tezos. There is Mike Wilson, indio robot with a couple or just one.
00:38:50.444 - 00:39:14.938, Speaker A: It is Monday, my friends. Check this out. I have to say, this really caught my eye. This very kind of minimal work by popple. And this just kind of ghostly figure appearing on your twitter feed here, I thought, beautifully done. Let's quickly see if we can get more of a close up on this. Yeah, playing again with more of a print sort of look, which is quite interesting.
00:39:14.938 - 00:39:41.174, Speaker A: Very nicely done there by popple. Some experimentation. Haunting and tradscape sending out traveler's map of Moros. Rough map of Moros. So great to see tradscape back here and sending these out to previous collectors. And let's look at the map here. Kind of reminds me of the Ultima four map, slightly different, and just kind of like a 1980s rpg game.
00:39:41.174 - 00:40:07.328, Speaker A: The reach Moros, the western sea of three. And we have the little ship, the cool kind of screen processing. A really nice gif here by tradscape, who does the music to this show at the opening and at the closing. Super talented guy. Very cool pixel artwork. Speaking of which, element Li with another just super original work here. Only a couple of colors.
00:40:07.328 - 00:40:26.150, Speaker A: Looks like underground at a subway station. And just beautiful work. Edition of 20 for six. Tezos living goddess of Lightning. This is stippin pixel, working with explainer gallery. And this is an edition of eleven and looks like not listed yet. And here's the work.
00:40:26.150 - 00:40:49.256, Speaker A: Kind of an interesting experiment here. These kind of samurai figures with, again, maybe a japanese gate at the bottom or temple and just passing through. So playing with the gift medium in a really interesting way. Interesting color usage too. Really interesting work. It's almost like a sketchbook kind of feel to it, but a gif rata. Nevermind.
00:40:49.256 - 00:41:08.360, Speaker A: I thought this was great. So playing off of Nirvana's album and then putting it in a frame, and I don't know if that's like Radda's signature or what that is, but this is great. The color and the baby. Instantly recognizable. Nice piece. Manital. A cloud with you on a day with a bright sky.
00:41:08.360 - 00:41:22.522, Speaker A: I was walking outside when I noticed a cloud that resembled you. So just a beautiful work here. With some kites that look like fish. And just more beautiful pixel art from mandal. And there is gogolitis. And I'll tell you what else I love. Look at this bottom area.
00:41:22.522 - 00:41:39.780, Speaker A: This is great. And the cat stretching. So very nice work here. And here it is in the studio here. I assume this is aseprite, but not sure. Actually, maybe this isn't aseprite. This looks like a different software and continuing, but this looks like aseprite.
00:41:39.780 - 00:42:07.956, Speaker A: This is aseprite. So beautiful work here. And nice details. Again, nice documenting of the process here. It really goes a long way to making the work interesting and having people take a second look here is not a number with a development on these gradients. Now they're starting to turn into random shapes. A little bit again, the dithering is made with programming, if I'm not mistaken.
00:42:07.956 - 00:42:31.794, Speaker A: And the colors are in gimp. So this is a one of one for ten tezos by not a number. Kristen Roose is back. Vortices four. This was just minted, an edition of 100 for five tazos. And often uses retro software tools to play with kind of abstraction cycles through colors. And yeah, this is 960 x 540.
00:42:31.794 - 00:42:44.114, Speaker A: Nice small work. And 61 left at five tezos. Another work by Kristen Roos. Pretty kind of louder work by now for one ETH. This is vortex one. This came out a week ago. We missed this one.
00:42:44.114 - 00:43:04.788, Speaker A: Nice contrast of the gray and the cycling colors here. And kind of an overwhelming work to a certain degree. Again, one tazo 75 on July 24, which explores repeating cycles, death and rebirth and infinite loops. Here's a couple more. Open edition. Finished. I thought this was great.
00:43:04.788 - 00:43:27.464, Speaker A: Boing ball, Commodore 64. So first he does this ball in a Commodore 64 computer and then it is within an amiga. This is used with deluxe paint four and this is deluxe paint four as well. So interesting concept. Also an open edition. Now finished. Interesting work.
00:43:27.464 - 00:43:49.698, Speaker A: Continuing on, this is muji with contemporary desktop, which is a great idea. So this is also a computer. The computer is subject. The computer is subject. So interesting cycling through the colors here. And this keyboard of sorts is. Has some icons over top.
00:43:49.698 - 00:44:16.998, Speaker A: Interesting color choices too. Magnified by four massive data flow cryptoglyph. This is an edition of one. And by the way, Bijuu, who buys all one of ones, 177 tezos. So a nice sale there for Muji chaz with a new one, I believe this is. We didn't look at this dreamscape and another retro computer. I don't think we looked at this, but it's possible we did, playing with some old software and everything.
00:44:16.998 - 00:44:56.594, Speaker A: Just another really nice kind of low res work from. From Chaz Silva Santus with some more experimental rom glyphs, Peregrinus. And here you can see again playing with this panning, this time from top to bottom. Another nature scene with the hawk here coming in edition of 33 for a Tezos 30 and Haiti Rockette FF. And so this is based on a video game that I don't know and kind of cool writing here and just kind of looks like a demon or something. Not sure what it is. Very low edition of six.
00:44:56.594 - 00:45:24.624, Speaker A: And let's just see what happened. Three sold for 13 tezos, two to winter wallet. And that is all she wrote. So very cool. More Nintendo Nintendo glitch rom this time from Sabato doing the Barbie world revisited glitch Daydreams cool title. And so maybe this is Barbie or maybe Barbie's friend in a restaurant and then dreaming of this scene here. So cool composition here.
00:45:24.624 - 00:45:59.014, Speaker A: But using the video game as a source, almost appropriating this video game and kind of reimagining using it as you know, reframing it within the context of a work of art, like a composition of a work of art. So that beautiful pink sports car. Maybe I will see that movie. I'm actually hearing good things. Mick renders don't pull the cartridge number. Zero zero little music. I love the feel.
00:45:59.014 - 00:46:22.960, Speaker A: Very nice piece. Very just great, great vibe. Loving the vibe. Nice music. Music by complex twitter.com complex complex so again, taking the Nintendo glitch rom and processing it in after effects. Very cool.
00:46:22.960 - 00:46:38.836, Speaker A: Recano also on the video game theme road to the World cup. So World Cup. 98 FIFA World cup. Not sure if I. Maybe that was in France, actually. I think that was in France. I think France won it, if I'm not mistaken.
00:46:38.836 - 00:47:03.894, Speaker A: And here we have all the good stuff. Palm trees, soccer balls, retro tvs, football. Looking good. Five tazos and still available. Seven left on primary phosphor operator we have some music here too. See if we can get it going. Nice music again.
00:47:03.894 - 00:47:49.854, Speaker A: Actually that's that really early kind of almost craftwork, not quite, maybe 1980s, early eighties kind of feel to it. Really rich audio. So goes for a minute eleven. So very cool work there. I'll let you look at it. Phosphor operator edition of 40. Let's just see what happened here and a few offers accepted.
00:47:49.854 - 00:48:20.754, Speaker A: There's exmortal there at six or seven tezos. So a ton of equipment went into this. I'm not surprised. I wonder who made the music. Probably phosphor operator Salawaki with a cool work here. Let's bring this up. Also cool videos, I think it's called cool memories through sound.
00:48:20.754 - 00:48:46.446, Speaker A: You are an auditory experience I wish I never had. Through sent you are an auditory experience I wish I never had. As if everything was simulated. So we can't look at the whole thing here. But as you can see, so interesting work here by Salawaki. Big shout out. Cool memories.
00:48:46.446 - 00:49:11.114, Speaker A: That is the name. Maybe a reference to Baudrillard there. Excerpt from one of my old text based works, Murmur, produced in 2017, inspired by romantic interactions I had with strangers online when I was a teenager and the loneliness that came with it. So another deep kind of video work here, new world order edition of one. Let's just see if it sold 120 tezos to Mikael Knowles. Mikael's all over this show. That's hilarious.
00:49:11.114 - 00:49:29.694, Speaker A: Great work from Salawaki. Nice photo here. Who is this? This is Anna Xmelina gif. You'll never be alone if you know how to edit a photo. Well, that is a very nice. It's interesting to see how photos are working its way into this program. A nice piece here.
00:49:29.694 - 00:49:49.710, Speaker A: And there's another really nice photo radisse. Pablo, how are we doing? Got to speed up here. These great palm trees that I saw on Instagram. These are beautiful. Too bad these aren't nfts, as far as I understand. Just really nice palm tree work. Helio Santos, seascape data two.
00:49:49.710 - 00:50:28.384, Speaker A: So we're going into AI here. Kind of a mix of a lot of things going on here. Not bad, though. All this video. Uh, not exactly sure how this is made. I mean, maybe it uses Runway, but I have a feeling it's more AI for the original with effects on top would be my guess, but I'm really not sure. Interesting audio, too.
00:50:28.384 - 00:50:52.896, Speaker A: So that is your piece. Helio Santos, synthetic landscape reconfigure. Reconfigured through computer vision and generative algorithms. Sound generated from white noise, AI, landscape, pixel. So just kind of wild work here already 66 tezos on secondary and sold out at 25 tezos each for the edition of 30. So market. Loved that one.
00:50:52.896 - 00:51:11.026, Speaker A: Ilay with a new one. I scream. So, playing with what looks like an ice cream truck in AI and a lot of negative space here. And just kind of a cool work here. And this is, I think, an edition of ten. Almost looks like New York over there. Edition of ten for four tazos each.
00:51:11.026 - 00:51:24.602, Speaker A: New York City life AI ice cream truck. So cool work from Ilay. And this was sent to me by AhEc. How's her worth? Live on Piccadilly. Lights. So I think this is London. Frank Bolling's first digital artwork.
00:51:24.602 - 00:52:03.098, Speaker A: Arrival. Featuring a cascade of color and looking pretty good. I mean, amazing on the screen here, this very warm, abstract composition seemingly continuing on. Another cool work here from this Rebecca Brodskies at the Armory show with a Christian Hiladurdi gallery. Just another cool work here. Also another cool work using some very interesting elements. I mean, this looks like a notepad from a Hotel Corinthia, Hotel London.
00:52:03.098 - 00:52:20.996, Speaker A: And then just kind of some random sketchbook stuff. Beautiful. This is for Virtuoso magazine, and I think it's roderick Mills. A test piece, trying out inks and varying pens on hotel stationery. Just really nice looking work. There. And David R.
00:52:20.996 - 00:52:36.204, Speaker A: Hales, someone who I've been following for years on Instagram with a really nice kind of watercolor drawing. What do you want for a snack? Ink and watercolor. Really, really talented artist here. And that is your show, finally. Thank you for joining me. And until next time, take care.
