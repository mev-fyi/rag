00:00:06.600 - 00:00:58.044, Speaker A: We return as we continue to set sail here. Feeling the fomo? Are you feeling the fomo of ordinals? Cause if you don't feel it yet, you may feel it in a few tabs here, let me tell you. Artist journal, January 18, 2024. Broadcasting from the editor's desk on the pirate ship of the mind, navigating the high seas of the imagination in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, and welcome back. How exciting was this? And again, bitcoin, art on bitcoin. The whole idea of putting art on bitcoin, I mean, it's kind of like, you know, I mean, one analogy is, you know, a lot of art was made with gold.
00:00:58.044 - 00:01:26.834, Speaker A: Right? You know, actually, the first thing that, you know, came across my mind was actually, you know, Salvador Dali working with jewelry. But of course, I mean, you go back, you know, go to the Vatican, go to even St. Peter's, all that religious art made of gold or gold plated, oftentimes egyptian art made of gold. Right. Or jewelry. Right. Retaining its value.
00:01:26.834 - 00:01:50.928, Speaker A: Right. I mean, in other countries, they keep their jewelry. It's like a form of holding gold. Right. And so it's just such a tantalizing prospect. Again, it's a different, you know, for those that might not be aware, and I'm kind of learning this as I go. Again, I'm not some blockchain expert here, but I am familiar.
00:01:50.928 - 00:02:30.674, Speaker A: I've kind of been in this world for a few years, actually, now, you know, fall, summer of 2020. So the years are starting to add up here. And the difference here on bitcoin, again, it's, remember from a few shows ago, for those that saw it, this is like putting your art on a penny, for example. And so inscribing it onto a penny, again, it's like making an artwork of golden out of gold. The gold itself has value, but putting your artwork on the gold kind of makes it even more precious. There's something particularly precious, some. A word I tend to use mostly with physical art.
00:02:30.674 - 00:04:28.522, Speaker A: You know, one of the qualities I would argue you're trying to do to trying to create with physical art is to make something precious, to make it feel like it has value, like that. This is something of worth. And so there's something incredibly precious. When you see this ordinal here inscribed by Euxine, there's something incredibly just kind of precious looking. And interestingly, kind of weirdly, a weird phenomenon, I would say, of this whole experience of art on bitcoin is the aesthetic that is joined up with it on files having to be a low size, it's almost becoming, I would actually argue it already is a part of this aesthetic of art on bitcoin I would argue, and it's a, you know, I was talking to someone yesterday, an artist, and it was hilarious actually, because she was mentioning, just here in Berlin, she was mentioning that the whole, you know, the whole last 30 years of digital art, we've been trying to make our files bigger and now we're trying to make them smaller. And once we have the AI tech too, to credibly make our files bigger, now we're trying to make them as small as possible, you know, almost like we're going insane here. But again, it's a wonderful challenge and it is a very, the aesthetic is like, again, working within the context of a medium can be very fun way it gets you creative, right? And there is some creativity here in like you can see like here we have 108 bytes.
00:04:28.522 - 00:05:13.306, Speaker A: And from my understanding, I was just looking this up, you know, I assumed 1000 bytes in a kilobyte. It's actually 1024. Interestingly, I didn't know, I didn't know that. And so I would say this is actually not a tiny file if I'm reading this right, for bitcoin or. Yeah, for bitcoin. Because, and again, this is, feel free to correct me, anybody out there that might know better than, than myself, I'm going on my personal experience, my back of the napkin calculations here, okay? So my experience of putting, of putting art or inscribing rather than minting. Inscribing on bitcoin is, it's about $10 per kilobyte.
00:05:13.306 - 00:05:43.382, Speaker A: Okay, about, or every, or every thousand 24 bytes is about $10 is what it cost you around these days. So this is 108,000, meaning this, in theory, if my calculations are correct, would be about $1,000 to mint. And it sold. We'll see that in a second. How much it sold for? For. .069. Can't remember how much that was.
00:05:43.382 - 00:06:32.794, Speaker A: Maybe I'll quickly look that up. But before we go there. So still a small file when we consider it within the context of digital art, right? Only 100 kb as far as I understand, but nevertheless a significant size for bitcoin. Now the content type here, the format, the file type is significant here. We've seen it once before, at least with rip cache, and we're going to look at a rip cache work here, this SVG and XML. And I think I was even speculating a few days ago, maybe a week ago on, oh, isn't that interesting how Ripcache is using that? Maybe there's something there that's keeping this file smaller. And so I actually did a search on that.
00:06:32.794 - 00:07:08.502, Speaker A: So first, so we're going to take a closer look at this file type as chat GPT, you know, tell me more basically about SVG and XML. What's going on there? So all to say, this was made on ordinal's wallet, where you can inscribe, as you see here. And we haven't even looked at the work yet, but it's that simple, actually. Start a wallet on ordinals upload file. And you know, it's that simple. So let me just, let me go back to that work here. Let's actually look at the work very quickly as well.
00:07:08.502 - 00:08:02.512, Speaker A: Importantly, that beautiful matte black you see here, actually, and it's hard to magnify this. So I'm just going manually with the browser here. You see, this is Euxine's trademark matte black, I would argue, or one of his trademark kind of characteristics is this interesting matte black. And apologies for the bitcoin balance there. And so just a really cool work. I mean, what do we see here? We see different kinds of pixels, or at least large pixels, contrasting with small pixels here, right? There seems to be three kinds of quality, different styles of visual styles, let's say, speaking very loosely, that are going on here. We have the halo around our kind of hooded crypto figure, which is interestingly animated.
00:08:02.512 - 00:08:34.104, Speaker A: And SVG. I mean, this is a lot smoother animation than a GiF, isn't it? It seems that way to me. So that also. So again, we're working within the context of the bitcoin limitations as far as price and keeping files down. SVG and XML will also bring its own qualities here. And it looks like it can animate fairly well. In a way that kind of GiF is a little bit more jagged, shall we say, or choppy.
00:08:34.104 - 00:09:19.974, Speaker A: So there is, first of all, there's this large pixel halo. There is the hoodie here of a smaller pixel kind. And even the way the pixels are kind of reminds me of cream safa. Remember in that work we saw maybe a couple of months ago with the eyes, and I think it was a self portrait, you know, it's almost like that style of pixel here with it also a different color, but perhaps the same color that this ends up on, maybe saving file size. And finally, we have the computer here, which seems to be its own kind of rendered treatment with the smiley face inside, a different color here. Also, maybe that's the color that the halo ends on. Actually, that's what it looks like.
00:09:19.974 - 00:10:22.954, Speaker A: And also a blue in this kind of, again, kind of pixelated computer all together and just kind of fading off into the black here, and altogether making, I'd say, a pretty stunning work when you really understand, I would argue, the limitations of bitcoin and everything that's coming into play here. I'd say, I don't know about you, and I assume you've already seen this, but if you haven't, when I first saw this, especially knowing that it was a work on bitcoin, I just. I was in awe. I just thought. And then again, that bitcoin, that shimmer of it being on bitcoin, that phenomenon, I would argue, shone through the work. Okay, so just another interesting situation here in our ongoing journey. Inscription 5545-1816 so let's look at what happened here.
00:10:22.954 - 00:10:44.230, Speaker A: Thank you, Xenozek, for collecting my first svg that I inscribed on b. And here, 0.069 bitcoin. I'm going to quickly look that up here. Just for our information on how much this sold for. I think it was about. I'm not sure if it was two or four.
00:10:44.230 - 00:11:00.224, Speaker A: I have it loading up here. Of course we want to know this, and very slowly. Okay, here we go. 0.069 is 3000. $2,925. So.
00:11:00.224 - 00:12:07.450, Speaker A: And again, 108,000 bytes. So I'm assuming this costed about $1,000 to mint. I'm not positive on that, but that is my understanding, based on my experience. So, congratulations to Euxine. Really, really nicely done. And I'd say from a market perspective, I mean, axin is a very, I'd say, astute player on this whole blockchain in blockchain in the sense of recognizing maybe perhaps, who knows, now is not necessarily the time with a softer market on ETH and people kind of getting, remember we saw that tweet, I think it was last show where someone was pointing out that why would you kind of, from a just purely pragmatic financial investment perspective, one of one art on, say, ethereum is not necessarily at top of mind, because you don't have the liquidity with tokens that could theoretically be going up quite a bit, or at least that's what's been happening. People have been making money off their coins.
00:12:07.450 - 00:13:03.238, Speaker A: And of course, when you're buying and selling art, it's not a liquid investment. It like, yeah, you can sell it potentially, but it's not the most liquid investment. Let's call it that way. So there's not a massive, there's still an appetite out there, but it's not as massive as it was, say, during the bear market, when there's almost nothing to do other than buy art. To a certain degree, one could argue, and one could expect this is going to come back. You know, everything's cyclical, so it doesn't mean it's not going to come back, but it might mean, you know, there's an opportunity cost, let's put it this way, to buying art right now. So I thought, quite a brilliant move by Xcene, I would argue, and same with Ripcash, who's been all over this for at least, you know, I'd say a month or two, right? Maybe, maybe even three or four months, maybe longer, not sure, but has been all over this story to rip cash's credit here.
00:13:03.238 - 00:13:49.914, Speaker A: So here, speaking of Ripcache animated SVG, this is a rip cache. So again, delightfully small. Again, part of these limitations of minting on bitcoin, and I'm still noticing this animation here of the color. It feels smoother than GIF. So I assume this is look animated SVG animated SVG so again, a file format to look at finally on this piece here. What a delightful contrast with almost, it looks like a squiggle here with the black and white, beautifully pixelated surveillance camera here by Ripcache. So all very interesting.
00:13:49.914 - 00:14:55.182, Speaker A: Just to wrap up on this discussion here, what is the SVG XML file format? So chat GPT the scalable vector graphics is SVG and XML extensible markup language. File format is a two dimensional graphic format that defines images in XML format. It's a standard maintained by the World Wide Web consortium. So a pretty solid standard, one could argue, and is specifically designed for describing two dimensional vector and mixed vector raster graphics in XML. And that is probably what we're seeing here, raster being the pixels, and maybe not sure if the vector would be the animation or not. Maybe that's a bridge too far. I mean, vector, of course, as many of you know, that is more of a mathematical way of building images in terms of, if you know, illustrator, Adobe illustrator, the pen tool that makes vector graphics, which in theory are infinitely scalable, and you keep the smooth edges.
00:14:55.182 - 00:15:59.848, Speaker A: Again, it uses more math to get those curves. Raster, of course, is more pixelation and more what you're used to with JPEG photography, as most of us know. Let's keep running here, though. Here are some of the key points about SVG in XML format in the context of images vector graphics unlike raster images, JPEG and PNG, as we were just mentioning, that represent images as a grid of pixels, SVG graphics are made up of lines, shapes and text. This means they can be scaled to any size without losing quality, which makes them ideal for responsive web design. XML based SVG images are written in XML, so isn't this interesting? It's a way of writing an image in a fairly, I think, compact markup language here, a markup language that shares many similarities with HTML. Each element and attribute in the SVG file corresponds to a part of the image, making them searchable, interestingly editable and scriptable in theory.
00:15:59.848 - 00:16:39.736, Speaker A: Isn't that interesting? Interactivity and animation SVG supports interactivity. I mean for all the people who are doing interactive works and animation which we've seen in both those SVG works. Elements in an SVG file can be animated or made interactive with JavaScript and CSS. This makes SVG a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive graphics for the web. So interestingly, a little is there JavaScript in there then? It sounds like it. Text inside SVG images is selectable and searchable. This makes content in SVG images more accessible than content in raster images.
00:16:39.736 - 00:17:30.952, Speaker A: Interestingly, compact file size for graphics that involve geometric shapes, SVG files tend to be smaller than their raster counterparts. However, the file size can grow with the complexity of the image compatibility. SVG is compatible with most modern web browsers. Remember the standard w three standard we were looking at there? Without the need for plugins, SVG images can be embedded directly into HTML web pages. Finally, editability and SVG is XML based, it can be edited with any text editor. As SVG is XML based, it can be edited with any text editor as well as with specialized vector graphics editing software. In summary, the SVG XML file format is powerful for creating and using vector based graphics on the web due to its scalability, interactivity, accessibility and compatibility with web standards.
00:17:30.952 - 00:18:09.704, Speaker A: So super duper interesting and just a brilliant to cap us off here, a brilliant meme here playing on the Spider man meme ella uxine, beautifully painted again, you see that matte black and awesomely almost x ray versions of Spider man there. Hilariously. And of course, needless to say, this is an x glitch. I follow xene indeed, as you see here. And here is one more pretty hilarious, hilarious painting here with the hug. So always keeping an interesting feed going on there on the social media too. So very impressive.
00:18:09.704 - 00:18:30.842, Speaker A: And just to notice here, look at how painterly you know Axin's profile picture is here. The skull, so to speak, is very painterly done, done in a painterly way. Nice textures. And you see a little bit of flashing here, holding this Mac with no screen hugging. So beautiful work there. And just exciting. Just very exciting.
00:18:30.842 - 00:18:58.748, Speaker A: We're going to have more on ordinals, actually, in a few tabs here. Looking forward to a great space. So we had a great space here. And big thank you to Michele Colonna for yesterday. Super interesting discussion on kelowna contemporary. The gallery Michele has opened, really, from what I understood, bringing on artists from the NFT scene and giving them a physical place to show their work and to make physical work. And there's a brilliant exhibition.
00:18:58.748 - 00:19:19.424, Speaker A: So it was super interesting. There were technical issues that we had no control over. It was x, actually. All of the spaces yesterday on x had issues with people not being able to hear them on their phone. So you had to listen on desktop or you had to join the stage. And then when you were a speaker on stage, it would work. You could hear.
00:19:19.424 - 00:20:00.680, Speaker A: So all to say, if you missed that yesterday, and thank you for everybody's patience and all the messages yesterday during the space, letting me know you can listen to it here in the recording. It is in my Twitter feed and it's super interesting. And also big thank you to Dina Changing, who was filling in for the how am I blanking on our how am I blanking? Rune tune. Thank you for filling in for runetune here for the next three weeks on the spaces. So rune tune is in Vietnam and in Bangkok, so can't wait to hear about that big shout out to roon tune. And again, thank you to Dina Chang and Michele Colonna. It was an awesome discussion.
00:20:00.680 - 00:20:25.234, Speaker A: It was a ton of fun. And here is the show, actually, just for example, that Michele is doing with Bear. Bear Boy sold more green than peas to anon. So just a super interesting, cool artist here. Beautiful textures. And look at this, just torn canvas, really, or just cut canvas here. Remember I was discussing the preciousness.
00:20:25.234 - 00:20:43.862, Speaker A: And that's one of the things I would argue you're going for in physical art. You're trying to make things precious. You're trying to make them like they're valuable. I would argue. Here's another one from Kelowna contemporary, standing room only bathtub. Look how cheap these are. Eleven by 14 inches, mixed media on canvas.
00:20:43.862 - 00:21:04.804, Speaker A: You get the NFT $400 or 0.2 ETH. As far as I understood, the show is half sold out. And again, for the contemporary art scene, that is not a bad showing. And they're pretty reasonably priced, a lot of these images. So the pricing is quite smart as well. So all to say thank you everybody who checked it out as well.
00:21:04.804 - 00:21:35.056, Speaker A: Just a couple of comments here. Rosatio, make art stress free. That's what I need to hear. Thank you, Adrian. Great show as always. Thank you for the comment, Rosatio. And just on that point, remember the reason, what is Rosatio talking about? Remember the person I was showing painting the board, airbrushing in the image and where I was saying, when you have a process, you don't need to really worry too much about every tiny little detail that you do and make it.
00:21:35.056 - 00:22:12.252, Speaker A: It's not a renaissance painting. It's about the process, which I'd argue is somewhat of a modern idea way of thinking about building images. So glad you enjoyed that, Rosatio. That was a revelation to myself at a certain point where I thought, you know, it's about building processes like what, you know, what do we celebrate, say, in Warhol? It's the process to a certain degree. It's that he can paint anything underneath. You can screen print on top and then you screen print black on top and then maybe another color or first another color, then the black and it all works. And you don't even need to think about it.
00:22:12.252 - 00:22:34.276, Speaker A: Get the assistant to do it, which he literally did. You know, where you have two people doing it, so the authorship starts. So what is it about? It's about the process. And you see this over and over. What is Gerhard Richter, who does all these different series? I mean, what are they? They are different processes. Right? So glad you're appreciating that. And thank you Tom Bombadil, for the comment.
00:22:34.276 - 00:22:46.414, Speaker A: There also comments on Twitter here. Great episode. Thank you, human boy Exmortal. This was hilarious. We'll put Art Bell here. Thanks for the disclosure. Disclosure disclosure shout.
00:22:46.414 - 00:23:07.918, Speaker A: I think he meant disclosure shout. Adrian love the art Bell reference. I hope I didn't read that wrong. I think it was disclosure, but maybe it was discosure. All to say, we all love art Bell over here. And there is the great art Bell. If you're a Terrence McKenna fan and you don't know Art Bell that much, there's great interviews on YouTube of art Bell interviewing Terrence in the nineties.
00:23:07.918 - 00:23:20.076, Speaker A: Those are legendary episodes also. Thank you vldz Lily illo. Great episode. Thanks so much for the shout out. The chairs are feeling the love and I think we have another one today. Thank you, Lily. Thank you Yoao.
00:23:20.076 - 00:23:40.594, Speaker A: And this sounds like Ed Morolla great to hear from you, Ratingo, Tegodego and Nikau, thanks for the link there, and let's continue. So back to our discussion here. We're back on ordinals. Loving this story here. And, yeah, let's just look at what's going on here. Acidboy. 32 of 100 planktons collected.
00:23:40.594 - 00:24:03.714, Speaker A: I think this is the new one. So acid boy is hitting it out of the park here, I think, with gamma's platform. And now where it's like the lazy minting, I think, or the prints. I'm still working out which one. I'm still doing the research here. But all to say, very cool from acid boy here. Hopefully we don't have too many Internet problems here.
00:24:03.714 - 00:24:32.876, Speaker A: So just really cool, animated abstraction from acid Boy, I think, out of Montreal. I was seen on his profile there. Let's continue here. Leonidas in 2023. Ordinals were born. In 2024, ordinals take over the whole game. And there's something, you know, again, the way I would put this, of course, you know, Lane, it's almost a little troll like to a certain degree, but there's a method to this madness.
00:24:32.876 - 00:25:01.450, Speaker A: And it's not a crazy thought. It's not a crazy thought that ultimately, bitcoin, if they figure out the L2 business, then what? Right? Then what? And, you know, so this. I don't think this is crazy at all. And we have more from Leonidas here. Top 10,000 ordinals collection floor is 0.18 BTC. So the node monkeys, you know, those are at, you know, three ethnic.
00:25:01.450 - 00:25:32.742, Speaker A: Okay, which is about, I'm saying maybe eight or $9,000. Right. The top 10,000 Ethereum collection floor is 58 ETH, or three and a half bitcoin. Bitcoin is three times larger than Ethereum and heading into the largest crypto bull market ever. So interesting, right? Very, very interesting. Leonidas breaking one and a half million assets under management. Franklin Templeton is bullish on ordinals.
00:25:32.742 - 00:25:57.686, Speaker A: And here is the tweet. Ordinals and L2 solutions on bitcoin shouldn't be ignored. And again, this isn't a financial advice program, but, yeah, I completely agree. Just giving my two cent on that. And, yeah, so there are vital. These are vital to solving bitcoin's economic security problem and increasing BTC's utility. And as a store of value.
00:25:57.686 - 00:26:17.870, Speaker A: So watch this space. And, yeah, it's worth paying attention to from just a purely investment point of view. And again, not financial advice. And I'm sure I'll be buying all sorts of L2s and whatever. So I'll be in there too, just to be completely transparent. Same with the ordinals. Rinnefish.
00:26:17.870 - 00:26:45.546, Speaker A: This was sad news gm my friends. My ETH wallet was hacked while I was on a flight this afternoon. And it's funny because I was flying recently and I was thinking about using meta. There was something I wanted to do using metamask, and then I was like, I don't think I want to use this on this kind of public. But I was like, nothing's going to happen. I thought to myself, but here, I mean, this kind of so warning here. So Rinnefish's ETH wallet was hacked.
00:26:45.546 - 00:27:05.286, Speaker A: It's a super weird and unpleasant experience. I've hardly used my wallet these days because I've been in the middle of my trip still processing. Thanks for the big help. And here are the new and the old foundation pages. And so here is Renny Fish, zero one. And so here's the old one. So this is kind of an or maybe this is the old one.
00:27:05.286 - 00:27:34.494, Speaker A: And this is the new one with one follower, right? So check that out and go support Rinnefish there. This is an artist's worst nightmare. And it doesn't even sound like, you know, there was some link that was clicked. Here's the wallet is super weird. And I messaged Rinny Fish just saying I'm sorry that that happened to you. That's terrible news. And she said other artists were reporting a similar issue.
00:27:34.494 - 00:28:01.612, Speaker A: So all to say, take all precautions you can on your ETH wallet right now because again, this is your worst nightmare. So you may not, if you're connected to sites, you may want to like, remove all the connections in your metamask. So just so you know, Louis Osborne dropping next Wednesday. So Louis Osborne is dropping on Solana. So it continues here. Let these artworks be your inspiration. So on the front page here.
00:28:01.612 - 00:28:40.664, Speaker A: And the exchange art team has been very active on their homepage and just, they're doing a great job over at exchange Art. So check that out if you are a Lewis Osborne collector. Edmarola I want to live on a purple beach under the sweet shadow of a purple tree. To fund this stream, I began selling tokens on the blockchain. These tokens are mostly scraps of metaphysical poetic knowledge in pixels and sound. The goal is to create digital mindfulness devices. So kind of some, you know, just poetic a statement here from Ed Marolla that I thought was worth highlighting here.
00:28:40.664 - 00:29:02.496, Speaker A: Just kind of beautiful thoughts from this very prolific artist on the blockchain here. Green Ginger, another pixel artist late good morning. Wednesday rendering the grasslands of Pixquare. So here, if you work on tablet, I've played with this software. I haven't released anything that I've used on it. It's a pretty cool software if you're looking for. Because of course, aspirite.
00:29:02.496 - 00:29:24.004, Speaker A: I don't know why they don't do a tablet version. Maybe because it feels kind of open sourcey, aseprite. Just with the weird, like, you pay like $70 to buy aseprite for your desktop. I'm not sure why they don't put aspirate on tablet. Because it seems like a huge opportunity. Maybe it's more complicated than it sounds. Probably.
00:29:24.004 - 00:29:49.890, Speaker A: Nevertheless, if you're looking for an interesting software, this is an interesting one. Pixquare. And here you see the user interface here in greenger at work. So just so you know, we like to follow that here. And this was a super interesting post, studying some ancient pixel art today. Federico de Vinciolo, 1589 La Licon content une auteur 4.4 miles.
00:29:49.890 - 00:30:04.312, Speaker A: So in French, it's amazing. That's readable. La liquon. I think that's the unicorn, if I'm not mistaken. Mistaken continues. Has a height of 4.4 my and maybe meters.
00:30:04.312 - 00:30:29.994, Speaker A: Not sure if they had meters at that point, but all to say, how cool is that? Pixel art from 1589. And there are some other ones here, too. The. This lion has this long length and height. So using the pixels as a way of measurement, again, almost looks like a dali watch. I guess that's like a, you know, a kind of saddle of sorts on the lion. Almost looks like a melting soft watch there on this lion.
00:30:29.994 - 00:31:05.392, Speaker A: But here's an idea, you know, for works that could be minted on like this, could be minted on ordinals for very cheap, I would think for $10, you know, $20, maybe. That looks like a two kilobyte file if you were to make that so interesting there. And also, let's just look at the last one here. Look at this. Fairly complex. And again, using these pixels as a way of measuring, you know, here it's, you know, width by height or by length. Very cool post from Chris there, Kapn, who also I follow a pattern used for a pot of the first season of plants.
00:31:05.392 - 00:31:40.372, Speaker A: So as we look at pixel art here. So isn't this interesting? Like, as far as I understand this, then maybe this is a brush of a certain kind, I think, that was made by kappan, a pattern used for a pot. So it looks like, because you see this is almost like it looks square, right? So probably this is a brush that was made. And so you see just how original. Here's a way to make original pixel art like Kappn does. Zooming in here. Here is one way.
00:31:40.372 - 00:32:00.414, Speaker A: Interestingly so. Just very cool post there from Kappn. And look at this. Spiegels, eight by eight by eight. Look at Spiegels. Basquinen has been putting out some pretty interesting work, like kind of pushing his art's boundaries. And I think we see it here.
00:32:00.414 - 00:32:30.920, Speaker A: So pretty interesting. Again, a big experimenter here too, of course. Minted on chain in Ethereum for sure. I'm not sure if I'm kind of like, watch this space as far as Spiegel's going, putting to something on ordinals. I'm not sure if that's happened yet, but it's begging to happen, isn't it? Pretty nice piece here, by the way. Spiegels continuing on cloud noise, GN with the ghosts of brutalism habitat. Work in progress in homage to the amazing Spiegels maskinen.
00:32:30.920 - 00:32:56.594, Speaker A: So someone doing cloud noise, doing a homage to Spiegels here. And we see the dithering here, a work in progress. So interesting piece there. As we go into the art, just some more work that seems to fit the last couple of pieces here. This is brawn. And I thought this was pretty cool. These kind of, you know, we've kind of been making a big deal of these different kinds of pixels.
00:32:56.594 - 00:33:27.276, Speaker A: There are different kinds of pixels, you know, based on ratio and whatnot. And here we see kind of like older kind of wider pixel here in this work. So just interesting abstract here. And interesting to see these different kinds of, you know, for lack of better term, retro pixels here. Embroidery number five. And I think so as you can see here, this is on object. And here's Braun, multimedia artist, collect NFT artist, collector, exploring organic and generative pixel movement.
00:33:27.276 - 00:33:58.894, Speaker A: And give them a follow here. And here you see the last six embroideries. So just cool work there. Here's another one again, seeming to use that wide kind of range, kind of, for lack of better term, wide angle pixel here, as you see. So just really interesting animated abstract there. Here's another one using a different kind of pixel, almost like sampling, sort of like we're seeing there. Here, you don't see the wide pixel.
00:33:58.894 - 00:35:04.136, Speaker A: It's more of a square pixel and almost doing things perhaps a little bit like we were seeing with Kappin there, maybe making, you know, painting with your own kind of pixelmate brushes, which if you're going to be a digital artist, you might as well make your own kind of pixels like Kapn was doing there. Right? And don't forget what we were seeing also in aseprite with the tile set, like so again, part of the challenge of being a digital artist today is you got to kind of pick your lane for a little bit and then do something at least because you can be all over the place if you're not careful here. So all to say though, there's a ton of interesting directions to go on in this incredibly exciting, you know, area in the arts here. You know, as RJ said on a spaces, you know, about a year ago, maybe ten months ago, this is the most exciting place in culture, he said, and I totally agree with him. That's why I do this. Continuing on, Nicholas Sassoon with another kind of animated abstract here, new RGB study. And so this is a GiF.
00:35:04.136 - 00:35:20.544, Speaker A: Probably a little bit more lo fi on Twitter here, but interesting work here from Nicholas Sassoon as ever. How is it doing? 5000 views, pretty good. A lot of retweets, so getting some action there. Let's see. This is a really cool. I'm going to see if my Internet is working. Good.
00:35:20.544 - 00:35:48.726, Speaker A: Beautiful. This is score and Sky Goodman. And what seems to be happening in this work here? What does this look like to you? Like this looks like that facial recognition technology type stuff or where it can recognize an object. It's kind of like AI. It seems to be applied here, perhaps just speculating on an abstract. And then. So you start putting this thing that's normally designed for probably security cameras and then you put this on top.
00:35:48.726 - 00:36:03.574, Speaker A: I'm just speculating out loud here. That's kind of what it looks like to me. A pretty interesting piece, isn't it? On object here. Speculative. Love the title. Speculative landscape number five, heavy weather. Maybe using a weather map as the source.
00:36:03.574 - 00:36:25.014, Speaker A: Perhaps 1920 by 1920. Smart size there. So again, Skye Goodman and Saiko Ihara and Psycho has been on the spaces. Sky's gonna be on in March. Just got a confirmation there, so I'm excited about that. And this is an edition of 15 and selling out or maybe offers are in. So offers are coming in so you can still put an offer in.
00:36:25.014 - 00:36:56.130, Speaker A: So nice offers coming in here for speculative landscape number five by Saiko and Sky. So continuing on here, this is a year old, this work, but I had never seen it and I've become a big fan of Martin Bruce's work. In the last few months here, last two or three months, thunderstorm web, my only piece on Solana. So this came out a year ago. I was looking on Solana. Nice piece here from Martin Bruce on Solana. So just highlighting that one.
00:36:56.130 - 00:37:18.690, Speaker A: And here's another really interesting piece. This is NUV 1914. Amiga's friends here. One of one for ten tezos here from the super interesting NUV 1914 here. Working with gradients and teddy bears. A nice, you know, it's experimental, but it's still like, as a composition, it's easy to understand and it's. It's more accessible than some of the other ones.
00:37:18.690 - 00:37:52.774, Speaker A: I assume this is. This is probably sold by now, I assume. And it's tempting to call this a masterpiece here. I saw this, like, again, you could easily have started the show with this, but we just started with the myth and we have, like, I mean, there's a lot going on in this space. The color on this gorgeous, gorgeous artwork by the myth, this brilliantly chosen. I guess that's a violet, a light violet, light purple mixing with the white and the black gloves here. This portrait, this gorgeous portrait of Muhammad Ali.
00:37:52.774 - 00:38:16.584, Speaker A: Just a stunner here in this boxing series by myth. This sold out. I was out of Tez, otherwise I would have happily have picked this up. Really nice collector base here. Ratcloak, Morlakos, Mikey Wilson, Roerich, you know, district 468 and more. So, you know, in a sense, I don't. The work speaks for itself on this one.
00:38:16.584 - 00:38:34.764, Speaker A: Just a gorgeous work from myth here with this boxer series. And again, pixel brush on procreate. So kind of emulating a little bit the Microsoft paint style on procreate. Beautiful edition of ten. It was only ten tezos each. Like, what a steal. Beautiful work here.
00:38:34.764 - 00:38:59.490, Speaker A: This is from Ratcloak here. And this is a one of one called Wheatfield. And let's just make it big here. So another very painterly kind of almost, I want to say distorted kinda. It seems like there's a transform going on at some point in this work. Not positive on that. Beautiful, kind of painterly work here, as we see in the sky from Ratcloak.
00:38:59.490 - 00:39:25.618, Speaker A: Cool kind of logos and references, almost referencing earlier work here with this cowboy. Looks familiar. And again, looking like a wheat field of sorts. And this is a one of one. And it went to Roerich for only 70 tezos. So nice sale, nevertheless, in this market, $75. And of course, Tezos is above a dollar, so bringing home the bacon there.
00:39:25.618 - 00:39:40.522, Speaker A: So good deal for everybody, really. And beautiful hat there. Tempting to see this as a self portrait. Isn't it a very nice piece. Spiritual noise. This is by dates. And this is an edition of ten for four tazos.
00:39:40.522 - 00:40:09.692, Speaker A: And as you see here, interesting work with this running person here. Kind of reminiscent of those early photographic movement studies. What is the name? Usually I know this name. There were two big photographers in the 1880s, 1890s who were studying movement and for some reason, EJ Marie. Right. And then there's the other guy. It'll come to me eventually.
00:40:09.692 - 00:40:27.430, Speaker A: It doesn't matter. This is. It feels like a reference to that which would be super cool. Interestingly, across here. And then interesting. Kind of a cosmic feeling where this is almost wallpaper and then bricks underneath and kind of cosmic imagery in the background. Nice touch.
00:40:27.430 - 00:40:49.284, Speaker A: And here, the wallpaper, seemingly wallpaper is kind of ripped off here. And then this very interesting floor here. And then this figure here with a logo on the pants there. Interestingly, as well as on the jacket. No pupils, even airbrushed out a little bit. Or softer eyebrows here. Yves Saint Laurent, again, something you remember from ratcloak.
00:40:49.284 - 00:41:05.156, Speaker A: Does a lot. And using these kind of modern clothing myth, too. So a very interesting and cool work from the taste. Great title, too. Kind of nice ambiguity in this work too. It's not obvious what's going on. And that is actually nice.
00:41:05.156 - 00:41:34.514, Speaker A: It's not didactic, as my friend would say. So four have been sold here for Fortezos edition of ten burka Bayram. Seven tezos edition of 20. Really interesting piece here, of course, instantly recognizable as burka Bayram. You see the illustrative style. Interesting juxtaposition of imagery, isn't it? Looks like different kinds of sailing vessels, maybe over in Asia. And then you see an octopus.
00:41:34.514 - 00:42:09.528, Speaker A: And then this almost looks like it's underwater here. But then here we have, you know, there's almost something kind of ancient feeling, because then you have the ox maybe pulling the cart and maybe people at the market here and more. And then there's some food, you know, some real universal elements going on here. Maybe even a little bit of battling their journey. This artwork is minted as part of the Nippon Pon exhibition at Aurora Sushi bar in Istanbul. So very cool. Maybe it does have a bit of a kind of japanese feeling to it, doesn't it? So beautiful work there.
00:42:09.528 - 00:42:36.370, Speaker A: Seven tazos. Mech Txt UK xene collecting Emilia Versace, OMG and more. Very, very cool work there. Seven tezos. Louis Osborne with a work in progress here. So doing a lot of work in progresses recently, which is a great way to just get your work out there, kind of maximize your, kind of the PR side of your art show the work in progress, especially if it's looking good. And here is the first one.
00:42:36.370 - 00:43:01.308, Speaker A: And then an update. How much longer? So this is on January 17, and then maybe a day later, you get the update. Just very cool. Classic Lewis Osborne colors here. So also a way to kind of get people excited about the work when you eventually do mint it. Here is another work encounter among the feels. This is by veer hundert, neuen Wilhund Neuen 409.
00:43:01.308 - 00:43:26.924, Speaker A: Safe Dave. So probably out of Germany here. And I think we were looking at this artist before, who I believe is on super rare, kind of these surreal illustrations here. Very interesting piece. Looks like a surreal abstract. And continuing on, Lucian Aguera with a interesting, beautiful abstract here, with a really moving description here. Today would have been five years since I lost my mother.
00:43:26.924 - 00:43:43.772, Speaker A: I think about her every day and wish I could see her one more time. Eyes without a face. Powerful, powerful statement there. And here is the work. So beautiful work from Lucian Aguera. As usual, continuing on, beautiful abstract. Here's another abstract by Mikhail Knowlson.
00:43:43.772 - 00:44:06.614, Speaker A: Hokusai boogie woogie. So maybe making reference there to the Hokusai wave, the very famous work 48, Saul. And you know what, Mikhail Knowlsson, I guess this came out a month ago. That's only, in a sense, that's only $4,000, because Mikhail Knowlson is one of the biggest. And I do follow Mikhail. I do it on a different browser. Look at how much Mikel has sold.
00:44:06.614 - 00:44:30.600, Speaker A: One of the big artists on Solana, if you're not aware her, $9,000. And you can even just see here. Last sold for 81. This work here, I mean, Mikel's page is very impressive. Last sold for 40, 618. So if you're not familiar with Mikel's work on Saul, that sold for 136. Saul, so has a big collector's base.
00:44:30.600 - 00:44:50.620, Speaker A: Last sold for 230, Saul. So that is Mikel's work there. My browser is kind of freezing on me a little bit here. So let's see Mikel Nolson's work there. Let's see if we are going to be okay here. There we go. Okay, mumble boy, how are we doing for time? We're doing excellent.
00:44:50.620 - 00:45:23.830, Speaker A: We're doing excellent seal and air digital collage. So a new digital collage here from Mumboboy. I picked up a couple of the other ones. Just really interesting work here. And if we zoom in, you see all the work that goes into this it's almost beyond collage to a certain degree. Once you start seeing this kind of, this brushwork, the spray paint kind of airbrush in the background, it almost feels beyond digital collage, if you know what I'm saying. So anyway, interesting work.
00:45:23.830 - 00:45:43.144, Speaker A: You start to feel like you see something and then it gets interrupted. So kind of playing with representation and abstraction. Interesting piece, especially when you zoom out. So just very interesting work. Seal and air. So let's keep going here. This is a one of one and sold to one of one.
00:45:43.144 - 00:46:11.284, Speaker A: So for three tazos. Good deal, very good deal. Here is Lucas Lejeune and neo neo dynamic scan. Collaboration between Lucas Lejeune and Neo Neil. Let's see if we can play it. A little bit of volume, a little bit of audio. Pretty interesting piece.
00:46:11.284 - 00:46:32.560, Speaker A: Frankly, I haven't seen anything quite like it. Kind of mysterious with the music there, too. And interesting play on scanning, dynamic scan. So just very interesting work here. 15 tezos edition of 20. And they are starting to sell here. Scarlett and Andrew art picking up a couple.
00:46:32.560 - 00:46:55.834, Speaker A: Very interesting piece. Here's another one that could maybe hang in the same show. Kim Acendorf, cargo 817. Also a black and white work. Kind of a mysterious piece here, too. You know what really kind of caught my eye here was the composition idea. You know, almost having these squares here that just reveal themselves as you see at the top there.
00:46:55.834 - 00:47:18.164, Speaker A: Interesting compositional format, shall we say? Or comp. Interesting composition, let's put it that way. Very cool. Here is figments with a one of one for 111 tazos here. Beautiful work here. And again, playing with dithering. Just an interesting contrast of the kind of dithered figure on the right.
00:47:18.164 - 00:47:55.084, Speaker A: Static. And then this beautiful RGB figure on the left in those beautiful horizontal pixels there, using that software, probably that's used for the entire figments catalog there. Beautiful work here from figments. So har lavantezos, a one of one. What was the title on that? The silent space between the thoughts, always poetic there. Here's another one by the same artist going under figments as well, kind of mixing the plants from the plant series, which is interesting. So another work here by figments, using plants.
00:47:55.084 - 00:48:11.624, Speaker A: And here we see these kind of cycling horizontal pixels. And here maybe another plant here. Not exactly sure what this thing on the right is. And again, contrasting this movement with this static area in the pot. Look at how beautiful the pot is. Maybe I can zoom in a bit. I think there are issues.
00:48:11.624 - 00:48:29.672, Speaker A: There are issues sometimes with, with the gifts. Zooming in on gifs. I think it's a little trickier. Yeah. Here, we can't do it, so. But you can see here beautiful pixels in the pot and just a nice little gradient. Just some random stuff here.
00:48:29.672 - 00:48:45.056, Speaker A: Almost nice touch. It helps popple with a new work here. Hello darkness, my old friend. I had Simon and Garfunkel in my head all morning because of this work. Hello there. So here, edition of 25. Interesting piece.
00:48:45.056 - 00:49:12.194, Speaker A: Of course, popple's working on the video game. Makes you wonder if it's related here. And we see almost like a touch of a crypto artwork here. Like more, more crypto art feeling, shall we say, with the skeleton and just everything, the glitchery. All to say, very cool work here from popple, as usual. Edition of 25, selling for 13 tezos. And it looks like there are only a couple left, so get it while you can.
00:49:12.194 - 00:49:35.624, Speaker A: 800 by 800 pixels. Juana Pedro. This was on Instagram, and I thought just an interesting kind of pixelated, rasterized, or dithered abstract is what I'm going for here from the liquania collection. This is on object. Interestingly. This is the artist, I guess, that we saw here. Really interesting piece there.
00:49:35.624 - 00:50:05.378, Speaker A: So interesting abstracts coming from that artist here is rustic digital art and a very interesting. Always, again, pushing the boundaries here. Again, playing with the screenshot as Ableton live hilariously in the background there. And then this big pixelated motorcycle guy, and then some Mario icons, and you see a little bit of duck hunt, some Pac man. Big question mark. This one's a little fuzzy. This one's crystal clear.
00:50:05.378 - 00:50:34.194, Speaker A: Always playing with irrational ideas here. Rustic digital art. And look at the tanks. So a lot of video game imagery here, almost making works out of kind of found imagery on video games to a certain degree with if touch of Ableton live life is that is, there's a great title. That's a great. Went to Morlacos for 15 tezos, so one of one for a pretty reasonable price. Coxbox Koxbox has a great title called, great track called life is.
00:50:34.194 - 00:51:03.018, Speaker A: For those trance aficionados, that is classic. What is the name of that album? That is one of the most amazing trance albums of all time by Coxbox that life is on. It's escaping me right now. I'll have to look at that. Veneto Pam. So it looks like Pamela Ceyrone here with a new work on Zora. Very interesting, beautiful work, as usual.
00:51:03.018 - 00:51:30.134, Speaker A: Free mint, so keeping super prolific there. And here's a pretty cool pixelated work. Eight bit crosswalk by Ugo, by Ugo Digi and Nipitrov. So interesting collaboration here. Ugo Diggie reworked the photo. So taking a photo, turning it into a digital painting and animating it using graphics. Two graphic software from 1996.
00:51:30.134 - 00:52:01.854, Speaker A: A popular software, from what I understand. I don't think I've ever used it. It's looking great, though. Again, like we were saying with Picsquare, if you ever hit a roadblock, try a new software because it opens up. Softwares are kind of like different brushes, you know, in the digital world or different paint or different mediums, right? When you think of gel medium or paste or whatever your case is. Anyway, beautiful work here. Looks like it started from a photo inspired by photos of people walking on the streets with a very interesting white background there.
00:52:01.854 - 00:52:18.838, Speaker A: Cool work. This is quite beautiful too. This is exponential, elongated, flat cubes, 100 frames, 50 frames per second. Just a nice animated abstract here. As we continue, this is on x. And that was. That's got 3000 views.
00:52:18.838 - 00:52:35.094, Speaker A: Continuing on, this is Louis Ponce with an interesting piece here. 0.15 is. And I think there are 25, if I'm not mistaken here. Card 25, actually. I'm not sure exactly how many. Maybe addition of not sure.
00:52:35.094 - 00:53:03.484, Speaker A: It seems like this is an addition, if I'm not mistaken here. Let's make it large. Anyway, all to say, interesting piece with this kind of eyeball head person at the top of what almost look like turntables, but not quite. And then pouring out these pixels into the eye. Maybe an artist pouring the pixels into the eye of this figure here, if you can see that, with this big kind of interesting background here. So interesting piece. Noise everywhere is the title.
00:53:03.484 - 00:53:25.074, Speaker A: And let's continue on here. And another one by Glitchtown arcade with a space theme here. Nonsense of the universe. Cool work here. Another Nintendo glitch rom. And continuing on, we also have retro man stage four by retro Manny, realm of zenum. So this was quite beautiful as well.
00:53:25.074 - 00:53:53.814, Speaker A: Kind of very nicely with our last piece here. And let's see if we can get it to play. And I don't think there's no volume on this one. So pretty cool piece here. Pretty cool concept piece, really. It's like a video game series. And even the way that the spaceship is kind of slowly going through the head of this animated figure right in the mouth there.
00:53:53.814 - 00:54:08.146, Speaker A: Really, you will not survive without our help. Pretty cool work. Retro man. Can you hear me? Retaro man. So pretty cool. Very cool work. And let's see what's going on here.
00:54:08.146 - 00:54:25.764, Speaker A: If my processor, if my computer can handle all of these tabs. Three tazos and the addition of 50. And let's see how many to go, captain. Picking one up here and 22 to go. So selling really nicely there. So a big congrats to retro man. Retro Manny.
00:54:25.764 - 00:54:43.988, Speaker A: Very cool work. Continuing on. Zed, good morning, paper hands. I thought this was kind of cool. Kind of had a bit of a kind of crypto art feel to it in this work here. And just great colors, instantly recognizable. And again, looks like a photocopier with a hand going through it.
00:54:43.988 - 00:55:01.234, Speaker A: Paper hands continuing on. This is Elie Pritz with a very interesting piece. We'll see if there's any volume on it. Mister and misses spoons sold for 0.069 ETH. Interesting piece here. This kind of morphine figure from Ellie Pritz.
00:55:01.234 - 00:55:24.990, Speaker A: So maybe this is. So there is maybe misses spoons, maybe that's mister. Not sure. But all to say, pretty interesting animation here. What is going on here? Do we have, I assume this is a mp4, because you can have volume. Volume on it. So it must be an mp4.
00:55:24.990 - 00:55:45.718, Speaker A: Nice sale. Selling yesterday for 0.69. So maybe 125, if I had to guess, 150. Kurt Hustle collective. Kurt Hustle collective said knock you out. So, ll cool Jnk. So another interesting piece here, almost looking like an album cover from J and K, keeping with the music theme.
00:55:45.718 - 00:56:02.354, Speaker A: And we see one of those characters from earlier, Kurt Hussle collective works. And here is a gallery drone. This is a gallery drone. A gallery with an unknown location. Also by Kurt Hussle Collective. So kind of a speculative gallery here. Let's get full volume.
00:56:02.354 - 00:56:40.436, Speaker A: Kind of glitched out. So interesting work as ever from Kurt Hussle. This is nine tazos edition of 13. And they are now available online. So just minted the last day or two. And here, continuing on, Klaus with some more beautiful compositions here. Just racing through these compositions.
00:56:40.436 - 00:57:02.378, Speaker A: Number 78 here. This sold for 24 tezos to Gosof. Let's take a look. Just the color. The color, the color. The interesting composition kind of boils down a lot of what you want from an animated, abstract work. Kind of glitch artwork would hang really well with the Kiro works and just kind of fairly, you know, I'd argue fairly.
00:57:02.378 - 00:57:26.334, Speaker A: I don't know if I'd say. I was going to say minimal compositions. I mean, that's probably an overstatement. They're not super minimal, but they're kind of minimal in concept to a certain degree. Like, it's taking a simple visual idea and then just working with it, processing it enough till you get somewhere. This beautiful kind of overlay here. This beautiful, beautiful purple here, which you see the noise over here goes over top the purple.
00:57:26.334 - 00:57:45.514, Speaker A: Just really, really interesting. Nice work here. Composition 77. I quite like how they're all called compositions, too. Kind of evokes a bit of a Kandinsky vibe to it. Here's another one by klaus, number 79, as we continue to race here. Almost a similar kind of glitchery going on here.
00:57:45.514 - 00:57:59.044, Speaker A: And most of these are selling. This also went to Goso for 24 tezos. So big appetite for these works here. Number 76. Composition number 76. Going to. I'm utrosing for 24 tazos.
00:57:59.044 - 00:58:29.884, Speaker A: Put it on secondary for 55. Kind of a different concept here, but that's still very rich, beautiful color, which is a characteristic, I'd say, of almost all of those works, is a very rich, gorgeous color. Mica Oladev with just a GM that I thought was pretty interesting. Let me see. I thought this kind of fuzzed out, gradiented out background was super interesting. In contrast with some of these kind of pixels. These, for lack of better term, cycling pixels here in the front.
00:58:29.884 - 00:58:52.048, Speaker A: Interesting. There's the background that really stood out to me, I thought. Just very interesting. Here's another one by walk again, seeming to play with September 11 here, 911. And playing with the noise, some sort of noise here, processing what I think is a 911. And here we're at 953. And this sold for only two tezos.
00:58:52.048 - 00:59:06.542, Speaker A: So you can get a. A cheap walk these days, if you're lucky. On. If you're kind of paying attention there on the auctions there. Clodia Brallo, new landscape, zero eight. I mean, it's a one of one walk. Just think about that for two tazos.
00:59:06.542 - 00:59:20.738, Speaker A: Offset painting patterns. So here we are. A GLB. Looks like a painting. And so pretty interesting work here. And it's almost bleeding off of the painting, turning into a sculpture. A collection of paintings mixing 3d scans.
00:59:20.738 - 00:59:39.810, Speaker A: Remember psycho from nature with born digital terrains. 3d modeled objects and materials created in a game engine and in a 3d painting software. So this is 15 tezos, edition of 25. Selling very well. Gozo there and more. All sorts of people. Ellitrader, nice one.
00:59:39.810 - 00:59:55.388, Speaker A: So doing very well there. So I think probably almost sold out. There are three left at 15 tezos. Here is Elby on Zora. And we still need that kind of maximize. Every dream has a meaning. Just a cool work here by Elbie.
00:59:55.388 - 01:00:13.004, Speaker A: As you can see here, full blast here. And I believe that's a free mint on Zora 34. Minted so far. So pretty cool. So Zora is still delivering for artists, by the way, and artists still minting there. Also continuing on, let's see if we can get this loading up here. Lily illo.
01:00:13.004 - 01:00:45.592, Speaker A: A blueprint for thought and form. So seeing more chairs here, but kind of a blueprint style here from Lily illo. So more super interesting AI artwork. Again, boiling things down a little bit. Very nice work posted on X Yoa in with more interesting, kind of more painterly experimentation here. Let's look all beginnings end Joaoin ETH very interesting AI artwork here. And often again, editing and adding Joa in's own painterliness.
01:00:45.592 - 01:01:06.984, Speaker A: It almost feels like a physical. This one, interestingly. Or maybe that Joa in was applying more digital paint than usual. It has a bit more of a textured feel to it, interestingly, the other ones are textured. This one has more texture kind of feel to it. Danielle King, echoes of forgotten tales, my long form generative AI project with Alexandra Jovanik Minty. Now on improps.
01:01:06.984 - 01:01:28.636, Speaker A: So more improps. Mints kind of has a. I guess you'd call that art nouveau. Is that what you'd call that sort of feel to it? And here you see two figures done with AI, a collaboration. Kind of classic AI margins there. And the white space on the margins, two figures talking again, kind of has a bit of an art nouveau feel. Echoes of forgotten tales.
01:01:28.636 - 01:01:55.948, Speaker A: A generative AI project. And you can check that out here on m props. And as we go into the AI okotex with another work, ritual to defend our roots. Kind of a more elaborate painting here from Okkote, I would argue, especially in the water here. And again, it looks like a ritual as stated in the title here. And then we see this figure here with this AI guitar, as you can clearly see here. Very beautiful AI artwork here.
01:01:55.948 - 01:02:13.854, Speaker A: Back to the, what I'm tempted to call the latin american palette here. And the sun in the background. Very interesting series as usual. 252 tezos 50. An edition of seven still available on primary. Continuing on Tuks Gmfam. Interesting experiment here from Tuks.
01:02:13.854 - 01:02:32.092, Speaker A: And continuing just an abstract there. Also, no hygiene. Continues here. Has been making a ton of sales. It's very impressive. 30 tazos because they're so experimental and impressive on the side of the collectors in the scene who are saying, this is different. I think it's really cool.
01:02:32.092 - 01:02:53.464, Speaker A: Don't drink it. AI artwork made with mid journey 4000 by 4000 edition of one. Also the power of releasing editions of one as well. So interesting AI artwork from no hygiene, as usual. And here is some recent work. I am following. Am I following? There we go.
01:02:53.464 - 01:03:04.680, Speaker A: I thought I already followed. No hygiene. Anyway, here we go. Here are some of the works here. Again, a lot of experimentation, maybe sometimes using video games. Kind of weird pixelation. That one was beautiful.
01:03:04.680 - 01:03:19.512, Speaker A: Only six tezos for this one. This one of one. So more super interesting work there. This is Zach from Zora. Zach Krevet Titus. So putting out what looks like some AI artwork here. Let me zoom out a little bit so we can get the full thing.
01:03:19.512 - 01:03:34.066, Speaker A: Pretty nice piece here. This is on Zora Titus. And I think I brought up Zach's page here. So this is a free mint on Zora. 27 have been minted already. Again, pretty nice piece. And here are some of the other ones.
01:03:34.066 - 01:04:02.788, Speaker A: And I saw this on Twitter too. Just interesting animals. So, yeah, not too much information there. But you see, it looks like it's a series of three so far of these what look like AI artworks. So interesting work from Zach, who's also going to be back on in March, I'm happy to say, on the Twitter spaces Sabato with some autotopia works. This is Potorosa. And as we wrap up the show here.
01:04:02.788 - 01:04:38.104, Speaker A: And here is just another kind of very, for lack of better terms, zany, you know, AI artwork from. There seems to be humor in it looks like a dinosaur kind of playing with the just weird results, it seems from AI. Generative AI photography documenting humans and their cars. So that is the unifying theme here is humans and their cars, created with midjourney 6.0 and edited with Photoshop. So edited afterwards, interestingly, Antigone, of course. And so another plane with cars and humans, of course.
01:04:38.104 - 01:04:57.362, Speaker A: Antigone, the third book, the third part of Oedipus. Oedipus Rex. Very famous play Antigone. So interesting title on that one from Sabato. And this sold for 25 tezos to clown vamp. Let's just see how the other one did. That one is still on the market for 25 tezos.
01:04:57.362 - 01:05:24.824, Speaker A: So again, one of ones at a reasonable price are doing. Are still moving here. Little cakes. So another cool AI artwork here from little cakes from almost this person that seems to be like a lamp here, lit from within. And then tempting to think that this maybe is the person kind of looking on at their own portrait, perhaps not sure, I guess the hair is a little different. Not positive. Anyway, beautiful work from little cakes as usual.
01:05:24.824 - 01:05:54.978, Speaker A: Let's continue. Shilley Preston with an interesting priest. Road tripping with Professor Leary. So interesting again, I think we were looking at a work by Shilly Preston the other day, we're again kind of, you know, using maybe the magic wand to remove certain areas and then putting video in the background. Maybe a reference to further here, the bus in the merry pranksters. Ken Casey and the Merry pranksters. Road tripping with, of course, professor, one assumes Tim Leary with a rock over top.
01:05:54.978 - 01:06:17.236, Speaker A: Not sure what that references to, but it looks like taking an AI artwork and then processing it, you know, in a special way with what looks like video in the background. So interesting work there as we move into the physicals. This one was a real head turner. I don't know about you. This style that Adam Lister studio did. Joker collection of recent work releasing Thursday, January 18. Really beautiful work here.
01:06:17.236 - 01:06:37.556, Speaker A: Just loving the style. So powerful and can take any image. This one's particularly powerful. Almost like a self reference to what they're doing here as an artist with this portrayal of the Joker. Beautiful. Even just turning that totally vertical, the cigarette there, it's almost like reducing everything to perpendicular lines. Very interesting.
01:06:37.556 - 01:07:07.584, Speaker A: Helios Santos, who does, of course, the paint plot tool. Today's progress. I think this is a landscape painted by machines with more layers in time, I put on it pretty beautiful. Again, it kind of has a slight, slight monet like quality a little bit, and it's just kind of out of focus. And I say that in a positive sense. There's also kind of like, from a. Just a process point of view, it's touch like Syrah, I would argue, but again, a little more what I'd call painterly.
01:07:07.584 - 01:07:32.848, Speaker A: When we look up here, almost like there's something very delightful about it. It's kind of like impressionism, but not bondozo bandido. With an edgy work. Again, just seemingly putting out a ton of work here, like several works a day. And here is just a really cool kind of greek reference, but with a tattoo on it. So washing off the tattoo seemingly here in this work. Maybe a bit of humor on that one.
01:07:32.848 - 01:07:58.780, Speaker A: And here is another work playing with the dollar bills, which I think I've seen machine use as well. I'm not sure what the reference is here, but it's not gallery, I think referring to Bondozo Bandido, who is Henrique Herms, if I am pronouncing that right. So again, using the airbrush in the middle here, and then kind of acrylic paint seemingly around the edge. Maybe that's oil. Not exactly sure. And that, my friends, is your show. Thank you for joining me.
01:07:58.780 - 01:08:06.644, Speaker A: Until next time, take care. It works.
