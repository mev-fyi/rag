00:00:07.320 - 00:00:23.089, Speaker A: I keep trying to press this button to make it go louder. Maybe I know what to do. I'll put it closer to the mic. I'll put it closer to the mic. Welcome back, everyone. Shouting off into the wilderness here. That is called Berlin on a beautiful sunny day.
00:00:23.089 - 00:00:43.799, Speaker A: Artist Journal, October 16, 2024. Waking up after I press record. My name is Adrian Pocabelli. And making it all happen. Feeling better, getting over this mini cold. It's everywhere. I see people wearing masks on the.
00:00:43.799 - 00:01:07.929, Speaker A: On the S band again, which is the overground train. And I think it's because there's so many colds going around. So just cleaning my screen there. Okay, awesome. So we have Gozo, Gozo with a head turning work. I love the simplicity of it. I think a lot of people love this, as you'll see from the market.
00:01:07.929 - 00:01:41.135, Speaker A: Actually, let me show you here, quickly. Look at all the offers that came in 2035, 2026. A lot of excitement for this work. And I can kind of see why. It's, you know, I talk about the reptilian moment, you know, that pre rational moment in art, you know, or as Ben Davis would call it, tactility. Although maybe he means something else because he's talking about physical work. And there's something to be said for those medieval works from Siena.
00:01:41.135 - 00:02:15.585, Speaker A: But art, that you feel right, you know, that's my go to, that is my default. That is my, you know, North Star. Aesthetically speaking. It's. You can create all the reasons in the world for something that's supposed to be good, but if it doesn't, you know, if it doesn't capture that feeling or create that effect, it simply is not delivering what you need. So it's quite interesting. And this definitely gave it.
00:02:15.585 - 00:02:43.685, Speaker A: As I was scrolling on Twitter, as many of you were, and I love this. Didn't even notice this. And it's so simple. And that's what I kind of love about it. Because what do you see here? If you had to guess, right, and we've seen Gozo do, actually we'll look at Gozo's other works for context. But what do you see? Just this work on its own. I mean, it looks like a landscape, doesn't it? Almost like Greek islands here.
00:02:43.685 - 00:03:10.771, Speaker A: You know, that's kind of what it looks like when you walk outside your little white walled hotel. And I put hotel in quotes in Greece. You kind of walk out and you look onto the sea like this. And so it kind of, at least for me, evokes a landscape. And what I love about It. It's almost like geometric. It's a very, you know, as far as landscapes go, if it's a landscape, it's about as simple as it gets.
00:03:10.771 - 00:04:19.119, Speaker A: And so at that point, the subject matter kind of becomes, you could. One could argue, the actual textures, the renditions, the movement, the different contrasts, the colors, the materiality, so to speak, the texture, dare I say, tactility of this work. And even little details like this interesting frame that actually doesn't seem perfectly square. At some points, this little frame seems more narrow, and at other points it seems kind of wider, doesn't it? So it's full of mystery, in a sense. And what I also love about it is how contemporary it is, as you'll see here. And even the texture there in the water is just gorgeous. And that texture contrasting with the pink sky, right? And what green water Is it water? Right? Is it abstract? Is it figurative? So now this uses.
00:04:19.119 - 00:04:46.125, Speaker A: I want to highlight here. See this little highlight here? SD materials that I believe is stable diffusion materials. So now let's go back and. Which is AI, now, is this an AI work? It incorporates AI from what I understand of Gozo's work, and we've looked at a lot in the past, and let me just open it here. But let's look at the title first. Backwards, enigmatic title. All things considered.
00:04:46.125 - 00:05:21.995, Speaker A: Maybe it's not a landscape at all, and maybe it's this shape kind of put backwards, right? Animated digital collage. So a digital collage that is animated by Gozo. It is a gif, and it's kind of a wonderful thing to think, like, this isn't a video. This isn't an MP4. It's amazing GIF. You know what you can do with a GIF? It's like a little mini movie. It is kind of a medium unto itself, the gif, to a certain degree, interestingly.
00:05:21.995 - 00:06:36.485, Speaker A: And so. And also incorporating SD materials, I suspect, for the kind of textures we see here, the kind of textures we see here, you think of Skomra, you think of rj, perhaps rj, you know, and look at these colors of this frame and this magical frame with even a white square brown to here. And so just a very contemporary work, again, without stable diffusion materials. That AI, which is only, you know, so technology that really didn't exist before two years ago, three years ago, like, would this image even be possible, you know, four or five years ago? And technically speaking, you could get these, you know, any pixels together. But practically speaking, you know, theoretically, yes, practically, no. I would argue I don't Think you would have come to this rendition even in a million years of combinations. I think this is a product of technology, techne, art, not to, you know, which shares the root techne.
00:06:36.485 - 00:07:09.291, Speaker A: Right. Of course, for those that are new here, art or the translation, the Greek word for art being techne, meaning the craft, the technique. Right. You know, as we've gone, you know, if you're making, you know, pottery, there's technique you have to. There are things you have to know in order to accomplish that. And really what are artists, they're applying techniques that often they invent, as I'd argue Gozo is doing here through combination. Right.
00:07:09.291 - 00:08:07.011, Speaker A: Which is kind of, you know, inventing, as I put it, image making technologies. They are inventors of sorts of image making technologies. And you'd say, well, did Gozo invent the stable diffusion? Did Gozo invent collage? Did Gozo invent, you know, GIF animation? No, but what goes oh has done is the same thing that's done with the jet engine. He's using combination or they are using combination. And all of a sudden you take a transistor, you take, you know, the propeller or whatever it is inside a jet engine and you take all of the different components that create a jet engine and all of a sudden you have a new invention through combination. And of course this is elucidated very well in the nature of technology, which I really need to go into. Okay, so let's look at.
00:08:07.011 - 00:08:30.865, Speaker A: Let me just see if I can find that book very quickly here, what it is and how it evolves. And I've read about a third of this book by W. Brian Arthur. You can get it on Kindle. I've been meaning to finish it. It's only $15 Canadian or actually American on Kindle. I highly recommend this.
00:08:30.865 - 00:09:23.649, Speaker A: Super interesting. And I think it applies to what we're doing here. Interestingly, what distinguishes most of the work you're going to see here is it's using technology from the last, whether it's Microsoft paint or maybe 25 years, in the case of Microsoft Paint, maybe 30. Right. So anyways, let's continue here. And as you see, Gozo seems to have two kind of series that I've noticed, which is some are these kind of flatter gorgeous works like we just saw. We looked at this one, I think we looked at this one and then there's these more three dimensional surreal tableaus, so to speak, these here, which I think is kind of how Gozo kind of created their collector base.
00:09:23.649 - 00:09:51.425, Speaker A: But then at a certain point and I'll never forget, actually, like, these are spectacular. We've covered like most of these works. These flat works, like you saw here, like you saw here. It was a real revelation when these works came out. They're incredibly original and they're actually hard to kind of pinpoint in a sense. They're not abstract. I mean, here I see eyes, here I see legs, here I see burning tires.
00:09:51.425 - 00:10:24.043, Speaker A: Right. But what's interesting about them is the color, you could say is kind of abstract or expressionist, right? It's like, okay, yellow. Well, you know, does anything. Do the candles need to be yellow? It's kind of free even here. The pink sky. Right. And so it's figurative, but it's kind of got a bit of a surreal vibe to it as you see in these 3D works, which definitely have almost a classic surreal vibe, almost suggestive, you know.
00:10:24.043 - 00:11:03.125, Speaker A: And when I say classic surreal, as I was mentioning last show, again, like, for me it starts to become. You have to, I would argue you have to sort of incorporate Freud to a certain degree. And where a cigar is no longer just a cigar, in a sense, it gives new meaning as I speak these words here to Magritte, CE ne pas un peep. Right? And that's. Oh, what do you mean it's not a pipe? But in fact, in a Freudian kind of mindset, it's like, well, actually a cigar is not a cigar. A pipe is not a pipe, right. A equals B.
00:11:03.125 - 00:11:46.833, Speaker A: Right? So when you look at bringing it back to Gozo here, when you look at these surreal looking works, there is kind of a, kind of a Freudian, you know, latent underlying vibe, we might say, you know, subtext, so to speak. You see it there especially in the ground, right? And these kind of, you know, morphous and sharp and soft and hard and soft and all sorts of suggestive images here. So super interesting, interesting early work here. So super interesting artist. Fabulous, fabulous work offer for 35. The offers are coming in. We'll see what happens.
00:11:46.833 - 00:12:02.739, Speaker A: Let's look at Gozo's collection. One of the joys of. Look at that. Struble waffle or cedar plank. That's 375 plants, 28. So works we've seen here before. Shirley Preston and Time, the artist formerly known as Santiago.
00:12:02.739 - 00:12:20.201, Speaker A: And there's Lena Eckhart and a few others. Just, you know, so too much fun. You can go into the rabbit hole here. So a wonderful way to start the show. Welcome, everyone. Coming up today, later today, we have Son of Steg. I'm very Excited to have Son of Stag on the show.
00:12:20.201 - 00:12:44.525, Speaker A: It should be a great discussion again. I feel like I've known Stag for going on like more than a year and a half early. Kind of watcher of the show, artist on tazos and let me just show you. And so here's some of the work and barely all there. Two day auction, Medici camp on it. So just cool work here. Looks like some magic wand and everything.
00:12:44.525 - 00:13:02.285, Speaker A: So it should be a good show. Come join us. From someone who's been around the blockchain there, art on the blockchain with some history. So looking forward to Son of Stag today. That is pinned in the comments. Sorry, that's pinned on my feed. Just one comment here.
00:13:02.285 - 00:13:19.481, Speaker A: Great stuff as always, Mr. James Gloa. Great stuff as always. Pokebelly. You actually put me onto RJ via one of your X spaces and I remember that that was like over a year ago. It's time to get RJ back on that if RJ is willing. Was a great episode and RJ shared some great insights into their work.
00:13:19.481 - 00:13:40.885, Speaker A: Indeed. That is what it's all about. Thank you, Josh. Thank you for the comment, Josh. Totally appreciate it. And yeah, RJ is one of those artists that was like for the longest time didn't really get that much attention, you know. And so I'm really thrilled to see RJ getting some attention now.
00:13:40.885 - 00:14:01.293, Speaker A: So it's just great. I mean, again, there's a time and a place where we can look at some of RJ's. Maybe next time we see an RJ work, I'll bring up some of the old works. I showed a couple. You saw Community the other day, which is brilliant. Some of those early works are awesome. So let's see.
00:14:01.293 - 00:14:24.971, Speaker A: So Hasdrubal Waffle commenting on last show, painting with a computer. And thank you again for, for the wonderful support here. Thanks so much. Poco. Love the section on Hayakawa too. The work definitely has a Le Dunier Cree vibe to it. If you, if you ever see a copy of the compendium Opital Brut by ldc, pick up a copy.
00:14:24.971 - 00:14:54.965, Speaker A: They're always visual endorphin fodder. Little Cakes and I are fans. And here's the link to Le Dunier Cree. So interesting. So maybe a chance to practice my French. I actually speak French. I took 12 years of immersion and you know, the older I get, the more excited I am to learn other languages.
00:14:54.965 - 00:15:14.155, Speaker A: I really want to finish learning German. I want to learn Spanish. You know, secret, secret. I may move to Spain. I'M thinking in a year it's kind of where everybody in Berlin kind of ends up seemingly is in Spain. Let's see. So also want to learn Italian.
00:15:14.155 - 00:15:35.915, Speaker A: So anyways, thank you for the alpha here. And with little cakes and waffles as fans, I must check that out. The great waffles. Commenting on the show. Awesome to hear Yan Lucas Magone the bright view. Thank you for the positive, positive vibes from Yan Lucas Magone. Awesome artist, great soul.
00:15:35.915 - 00:16:03.125, Speaker A: I lay more screenshots and songs. Incoming. Loving the show and perspective. Yes, I think a Patreon or special series of Pokebelly in the Wild at galleries, museums or discussing current shows and art history is a cool idea, which is super interesting. You know, I've been discussing this with a couple of people how it's, you know, you know, as I say, broadcasting. There is no. There are no shortcuts.
00:16:03.125 - 00:16:53.015, Speaker A: There are no shortcuts. You have to basically humiliate yourself until you stop humiliating yourself in front of the camera. And what's interesting about this is I've gotten used to this. Now I just press record and I go, you know, on Show 362. But it's a different story. First with the. I don't feel like I photograph super well as with a selfie and with other people around, like, I mean, I find it hard as regular watchers of the show will know if there's some, you know, person in the hallway outside, you know, if I'm at an Airbnb or something and I hear noise, like all of a sudden it's like, okay, what's going on here? So for me to bring out, you know, and I'm.
00:16:53.015 - 00:17:18.241, Speaker A: And I kind of refuse to do a selfie stick, just out of personal pride, I think. And so. And I guess you need a mic. But I've thought about this. I've discussed this with a couple of people and maybe I do love this idea. It continues to resonate with me. I do have a time issue, but I do love this idea of doing kind of extra kind of deep dives, so to speak.
00:17:18.241 - 00:17:51.219, Speaker A: I mean, you could go into surrealism. I've discussed in the past, like a long time ago, you know, lectures on JG Ballard, you know, like, how fun would that be Again, you release like couple, two or three videos a month, maybe more and maybe one a week. I mean, that starts to get a lot and then you just do it on a Patreon. And that's a way of bringing in money for people that want to pay and then. But not Taking away from the show. Right. Because I do love that this show is open that anybody can watch it.
00:17:51.219 - 00:18:20.103, Speaker A: I do consider the ads, you know, I'm still kind of. They're not that bad is what I noticed the last time I visited my parents place and watched some YouTube on the TV. It wasn't that bad, the ads. So I may turn on the ads at some point. Nothing too crazy. But who knows, I still haven't even had the time to make that happen. So anyways, thank you for the interest and of course, yeah, and other people I think Josh Sobble has mentioned.
00:18:20.103 - 00:18:39.941, Speaker A: You know, you should go to galleries and museums and hit record. So anyways, lots to discuss here. Thank you for the feedback. AI Lay, awesome to hear from you. Andrew Race thank you for the vibes. Rural Idol, another nice show and always good to see a name check for Gary panter too. His 10 drawing tips I often come back to when I am in a funk and they are here.
00:18:39.941 - 00:19:09.095, Speaker A: So if anybody wants to find this link and I brought it up earlier, you can just go here. The images are broken on the site, at least for me, so I didn't bring it up. But yeah, so. And I wasn't going to read everything online, so. But if anybody wants to check out Gary Panter of course, who was brought up by our opening artists there last episode. Andre Summer. Andre Summer Blues I'm so thrilled to see Andre Summer Blues back.
00:19:09.095 - 00:19:25.359, Speaker A: I love your show so much. So send in the good vibes here and I believe we have a work posted on X by Andre. Awesome to see you back, Andre. Lena Eckhart, like always, great show, Adrian. Thanks a lot. My absolute pleasure. Lena.
00:19:25.359 - 00:19:46.389, Speaker A: Great to have you in the audience. Thank you for that. It's Elrena Pokebelly Monday. Yes, I can be pretty consistent once I am in the groove and once I am back in Berlin at home, I'm pretty good. So yeah. Monday, Wednesday, Friday Mama Do Sau Dope as usual. My name is Mamadou Mama plus Do.
00:19:46.389 - 00:20:15.907, Speaker A: So I think Mamadou, if I'm pronouncing that right, I am a real digital painter. Interesting. Okay, well thank you and really appreciate the comments. And by all means, if I am missing your work, by all means post in the community. That is the way to just kind of start getting on the radar. If you're interested, if you watch the show, it's probably fun to see your work, right? So feel free to post in the community. Rorich, thank you for the vibes.
00:20:15.907 - 00:20:22.315, Speaker A: Ariel. Good show, Adrian. Thank you, Jada. Great art on this show. Thank you Jada. Awesome to hear. I think we have a work by Jada.
00:20:22.315 - 00:20:44.969, Speaker A: Not positive if it's Jada, but pretty sure we do. Our milk. I'm crazy about the emotions of these characters. I don't know but there's something very deep in this and this was interesting too. Let me see if I can open it. As you see here, another pixel artist. This is O E L ul and as you see, just some pixel art characters and of course our milk.
00:20:44.969 - 00:20:57.785, Speaker A: Look at this. Pretty interesting pixel art here. So thank you for posting our milk. Very interesting. I don't know but there's something very deep in this. Awesome to hear. Ollie Stewart Always a good show.
00:20:57.785 - 00:21:28.815, Speaker A: GM Friends Poco do you ever recall you ever featured the art of Ziri James art? And I looked and I didn't Zeri's Jame art. I didn't see their work before so thank you for posting and sharing that with me. Ollie Martin Bruce Wow, nice. Moto Hero Very interesting. Poke Belly Awesome. And I managed to get that Martin Bruce 1 of 1 Even despite posting it on the show and everything from my secret Tez account there. So awesome to hear from you Martin Bruce Love your work.
00:21:28.815 - 00:21:56.781, Speaker A: Omizu Paints Another wonderful episode of The Artist Journal Mr. Pokebelly. There are so many great artists out there doing some very interesting stuff. So interesting that I broke down and minted a few of my own works on the Object Marketplace. Also, thanks for sharing my comments earlier. You're totally welcome and by all means post in the community where we are going I think right now. Feel free to post here if you want to share your work.
00:21:56.781 - 00:22:43.841, Speaker A: Skull takes a wonderful thread by NF Suzanne on Lillian Schwartz, computer art pioneer. So I find this super interesting. I hadn't heard admittedly of Lillian Schwartz and I don't claim to have a huge knowledge of, you know, the pioneers of computer art. I have a vague idea go to the Digital Art Museum and here in Berlin many times and whatnot and you just get it through osmosis. And I believe I brought this up here and I think I'm not sure. Yeah so here is Lillian Schwartz and here is an example of her work Posted by Robert Beattie Sad to hear computer art pioneer Lillian Schwartz has passed away. Her early computer films have been an endless inspiration of my work and this is what I want to focus on here.
00:22:43.841 - 00:23:24.939, Speaker A: Computer films. And this is interesting because as we've discussed here actually let me play the work because as we've discussed, the first generation isn't just coding, right? But Lilly seems to have gotten. Lillian Schwartz seems to have gotten another solution to make it more kind of. I don't know if tactile is the right word. That's probably not the right word. But a little bit more who, you know, it feels like, oh, this wasn't coded. It was probably made another way.
00:23:24.939 - 00:23:58.745, Speaker A: And I don't even know how, but these are computer films. And so almost what I see here, I see almost the kind of, for lack of a better term, the ancient or the kind of arche, you know, the, you know, original kind of motion towards what we see in a lot of glitch. I would argue it's kind of has like a similar kind of vibe to a certain degree, doesn't it? A visual vibe. Right. So interesting. So just wanted to highlight that. So thank you for posting.
00:23:58.745 - 00:24:19.345, Speaker A: Katarina. Good morning, artist Journal fam. Happy. Have a happy spooky season. So it is becoming Halloween season and I'm loving these distorted figures here and even risque there on the torso. Just great work from Katarina Create. Loving the vibe.
00:24:19.345 - 00:24:34.189, Speaker A: Tornado Rodriguez. I know Poco enjoys my paint 98 pieces. So here's a sneak peek. So this is. Love this. Thank you for the sneak peek. And there is the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, some comics, and so a tornado Rodriguez object 98.
00:24:34.189 - 00:25:00.791, Speaker A: Work in progress. Work in progress. Thank you for posting Tornado. And we'll see you in a couple of weeks where if everything goes according to plan, we will have NUV 1914 in a couple of weeks on the spaces, which will also be interesting, which will also be great in two weeks. So Tornado Rodriguez is going to do the translating, so that should be awesome. Fingers crossed everything works out. Yay.
00:25:00.791 - 00:25:15.875, Speaker A: Ojo KE Mira. Here's my new drop for Tezos Tuesday. So very cool. A nice illustration with what looks like a little bit of watercolor here and some textured paper. Almost a bit of a Ralph Steedman kind of vibe here. So very cool. And a map at the bottom.
00:25:15.875 - 00:25:23.917, Speaker A: Very cool. Thank you for sharing. Yell okay. Mira. Thank you for sharing. Mira. Mr.
00:25:23.917 - 00:25:36.333, Speaker A: Reero sharing this again. Tezos Tuesday. And here we are. So a little bit of what looks like video work. Interestingly, some computer film from Mr. Reero. Thank you for posting.
00:25:36.333 - 00:25:53.325, Speaker A: Retro Manny. This looks super cool. Prince of Persia. There's something about video games, isn't there? As subject matter? I've done it myself. Many other people have done it. We see it in the glitch roms. Very rich visual playground, so to speak.
00:25:53.325 - 00:26:38.681, Speaker A: And there's something about it. And I have actually kind of like a pet Theory that part of the that it's not always the gameplay that makes these, especially video games from the 1980s, so great. It's actually oftentimes the visual design, the art, so to speak, of the video game. And I put Ultima 4 is kind of my go to Lord British so to speak. Like I consider a masterpiece of digital art. And it's just visually spectacular, right? And I'll go back to that sometimes and I played like. Or I'll put it on YouTube and I find the gameplay kind of boring, but visually I'm all about it and I keep coming back every so often.
00:26:38.681 - 00:27:08.735, Speaker A: Maybe at Christmas I'll go back and watch some Ultima 4 because I'd rather do that than move around myself. Anyways, super interesting. Kind of a light bright effect there on the filter. Joe. Ghost of the fireflies gather in the storm. So here we have a little bit of interesting mix of what could be other photography mixed with a little bit of digital processing, so to speak. Or some pixels on top.
00:27:08.735 - 00:27:37.715, Speaker A: Interesting. Thank you Joe for posting and Luke 500. This is kind of hilarious. So Zancan is selling this work for $56,000 or maybe it's being sold by anonymous bakery art collection on secondary open call to bounty hunters. 14,000 referral bonus. So 25% referral bonus if you get to facilitate the sale of a one of one which includes a giant sign print by the one and only Zancam. So pretty hilarious.
00:27:37.715 - 00:28:05.097, Speaker A: Thanks for posting Luke. And thanks for posting my work on bitcoin There the dog. It's funny, I was like, I didn't even share that one because I was like I don't know. And then I saw it after you posted, I was like, yeah, I think I like that work. So it's always great to hear Megathread of Lillian Shorts by legend Anna Molina. So other people referring to Lillian Shorts. So all very interesting as these pioneers start to, you know, I think was in her late 80s if I'm not mistaken.
00:28:05.097 - 00:28:20.125, Speaker A: Start to pass. Louis. JPD. A bit of everything from an Excel spreadsheet to Photoshop to cling AI back to Photoshop and then into Blender. Yes indeed, Louis. So a little bit of everything here. Wow.
00:28:20.125 - 00:28:38.311, Speaker A: So combination. The power of combination. Right? Thank you for posting Plague. Very cool. Kind of surreal work here. I suspect AI is involved, but I'm not positive about that. Thank you for posting through the digital construct and August Ground new work.
00:28:38.311 - 00:29:20.047, Speaker A: Please repost Columbus Catastrophe for International Indigenous Day and we'll try and load that up and we're going to look at this work here by Kurt Hustle Collective that is already loaded up. And here, data. Look, mom, I can generate art paint as fast as AI so I may have to start going faster through the community here. Hi, Poco. Should we call digital art instead art? Should we call digital music on Spotify? Why do we call digital art instead art instead of art? Should we call digital music on Spotify? It's an interesting point. You do call it techno, you know, so it's actually, you know, it's. I would say it's.
00:29:20.047 - 00:29:50.326, Speaker A: I think I even called a video this, right? It's like it's. It's basically like visual techno in the sense. The same way we call it technological music, we call it digital art. And sometimes, you know, sometimes the analogies break down between the mediums too. And I think part of the reason we call it digital art is because it is such a break and it's worth noting. Again, I highly recommend. There's a video on YouTube.
00:29:50.326 - 00:30:33.527, Speaker A: It's like 25 minutes and it takes you through the history of art, right? And you go through the whole thing. And as I was watching that, even when you're in the 20th century and then you think about the works you see on this show and you're thinking to yourself how radical it is what we're doing here from a visual perspective. I mean, we're neck deep in it, so it's kind of easy to forget. And digital art's been around for 30 years, but when you look at the big picture of Back to Lascaux and maybe before the cave paintings, it's pretty radical when you see a zuozhou work like we'll see today. Thank you for posting your work. AI Mosaic model and retromanny. This beautiful work by Annis Abdin.
00:30:33.527 - 00:30:50.729, Speaker A: We have a work by Annis Abdin this episode post the foundation just rad rad pixel artist. Vincent Law. Thank you for posting a animated work or, sorry, a abstract work here. Rosettio. This is beautiful. And I think we may have seen these. Ernesto, I think we've seen these.
00:30:50.729 - 00:31:10.005, Speaker A: We did. Okay, thank you everybody. I may have to go a little faster, but your work will be seen here even if just for a moment. So please. Yeah, so thank you for posting everybody. We'll manage it on a day to day basis here. So here is the work by August Ground as well.
00:31:10.005 - 00:32:10.767, Speaker A: And it is Columbus Catastrophe. And indeed, you know, I'm watching a lot of history right now and interesting change of mediums and I'm just sort of Scrolling through here a little bit and it's kind of crazy. History is just conquest after conquest and it's like we had nothing better to do. It also kind of reminds you when you look at history and just like the endless conquests and most of these names are forgettable and you've never heard of. There are too many conquests and it makes you really appreciate at least for me, I'm kind of back to Socrates and what Socrates was saying, you know, and a different kind of a different path, you know. So yeah, anyway, thank you everybody for posting. And as we move through this episode, 1010 best booths at Frieze London and Frieze Masters 2024 I thought just because we're discussing a lot about contemporary art.
00:32:10.767 - 00:32:41.341, Speaker A: Well, let's see for ourselves. And so here, Sean Kelly Fries London and you see what looks like actually. So here's the visuals we can't go through. We have a lot to go through here. Here's Mile McEnergy gallery. Just to give you a feel of what is being show at another gallery, Ginion Frederick Perrotin, very famous Believe out of Paris. And here another one, Frith Street Gallery.
00:32:41.341 - 00:33:16.745, Speaker A: So just to give you a sense, James Cohen and Ben Brown Fine Arts Gagosian and also Masul Leni and just giving you a sans Hot Wheels Freeze London. And of what's happening there we have another one, the 10 the buzziest artworks and booths at Fries London. And these were different ones. Nils Alex Tabling at Public Freeze London. So a bit of a. Seems like a sculpture interestingly. And another booth which looks like a studio interestingly set up in the booth.
00:33:16.745 - 00:33:43.315, Speaker A: More work here. So I just want to get us a visual sense. Interestingly this work here is I think significantly from 1969. Beautiful work, isn't it? 1969 though interestingly too Eva Svank Maharova. Beautiful even love the bottom area here. And I guess it's after Giargone. I think I'm pronouncing Giargone's name right.
00:33:43.315 - 00:34:02.575, Speaker A: This was also kind of a nice booth here. Pace at Frieze Masters. Not sure how old these works are. Painting as her primary focus and passion in 1987. Natalie du Pasquier. So not sure how old these are. They do look older though, don't they? Another work here, sculpture.
00:34:02.575 - 00:34:33.625, Speaker A: And finally this was at Esther Schipper Famous gallery here in Berlin too. I believe they have a place in London, but I'm not positive about that. It's kind of made of bronze, so classic kind of contemporary art. So I Won't say any huge surprises. Here's Gagosian. And these all sold for something like 800, 850, 000 each and they sold so amazingly, this looks great. I mean I do have a bias towards like two dimensional kind of paintings, so to speak.
00:34:33.625 - 00:34:51.933, Speaker A: But you know, I'm open minded though too. Nengi omuku swing low 2024. So this is new. So nice one there at the end. Alan, survey. Just so we stay on top of what's going on out there. Art Basel Paris, I think just started Art Basel Paris.
00:34:51.933 - 00:35:23.427, Speaker A: And he's quoting Noah Horowitz. Day one of Art Basel Paris. Art Basel Paris really is the event of the year across the entire art market and art world calendar. And that's just an unbelievable testament to the power of the brand and the belief in the brand and the excitement around Paris in 2024 and the Grand Palais itself. So how interesting is that? I think it's a more recent development. Art Basel Paris, like the last five years, I'm. If I had to hazard a guess.
00:35:23.427 - 00:35:48.013, Speaker A: And now people are saying it's the best fair on the calendar. Interestingly, a bit more from our art world, from the trad art world here. This was interesting. So of course there's been more attacks on artworks from. I think it's just stop oil. So there's now an open letter from the National Museum Director's Council. These attacks have to stop.
00:35:48.013 - 00:36:58.135, Speaker A: The leaders of the UK national collections and major regional museums highlight the enormous stress for colleagues at every level of an organization and visitors who no longer feel safe following series of protester attacks on museum works. And it's actually not too long, so let's read it just so we're completely up to date on this conversation here we are writing as members of the National Museum Directors Council, which represents the leaders of the UK national collection, collections and major regional museums. Over the past few years, UK museums and galleries, the artworks they contain, and by extension the people who visit and those who work there, have increasingly become the targets of protest action. While we respect the right for people to protest and are often sympathetic to the cause, these attacks have to stop. They are hugely damaging to the reputation of UK museums and cause enormous stress for colleagues at every level of an organization, along with visitors who no longer feel safe visiting the nation's finest museums and galleries. And what's also going to happen is all of a sudden it's going to be like walking into an airport when you walk into a museum. If this continues.
00:36:58.135 - 00:37:48.485, Speaker A: That's my concern is it's going to be a lot, just way more hassle. And it already is. Like if you go to the Louvre, for example. Since July 2022, the National Gallery alone has been the victim of five separate attacks just at the National Gallery on iconic paintings such as Van Gogh's Sunflowers, John Constable's the Haywain, Velasquez, Rokeby, Venus. Such attacks have caused physical damage to the artworks, distress to visitors and staff alike, and disruption to our collective collective mission to ensure great art and artifacts are available for everyone everywhere to enjoy. Two of these attacks have happened in the last two weeks, and that is why we have decided now is the moment for us to speak out. Our UK museums and galleries are an integral part of society where free access allows everyone to be inspired by humanity's great, greatest achievements.
00:37:48.485 - 00:38:51.025, Speaker A: The collections we hold are irreplaceable, and with each attack, we are forced to consider putting more barriers between the people and their artworks to preserve these fragile objects for future generations. The world is currently in a very dark place, but these demonstrations now need to be taken away from our museums and galleries so that they can continue to provide light and solace to all. And Just Stop Oil responded in response to the letter. A spokesperson for Just Stop Oil told the art. If the NMDC believes the biggest threat they face is nonviolent protest, they should speak to the staff that are now sleeping in Florida's Salvador Dali Museum after their houses were destroyed by a supercharged hurricane. So the implication being oil, just oil, is creating the hurricane, and that's worse. So therefore, it sounds like they're going to continue.
00:38:51.025 - 00:39:29.079, Speaker A: Another reason to love digital. Right? Okay. I thought this was interesting, actually. Tracy Emin says male artists sort of peak in their 40s. And I just thought it depends what artists you're talking about. Like, I, you know, I think of my philosophy professor Kevin Corrigan back at the University of Saskatchewan, who was saying, you know, Aristotle, I think Aristotle was saying, you know, it's when you're 60 that you really start hitting your peak as a philosopher. And I'd argue art isn't that different from philosophy.
00:39:29.079 - 00:39:57.985, Speaker A: I would argue. And just in terms of what it is, it's a creative endeavor, it's a mind endeavor. And so, and I think of, you know, my favorite artists. Some of them I think of. Who am I thinking? John Baldizzari? I think of Richard Prince. I mean, John Baldassarre. It's in the last 15 years, 20 years.
00:39:57.985 - 00:40:15.275, Speaker A: It's spectacular. It's spectacular. If you see the little Emojis that are done. I mean, and I mean, he lived till he was like, I think 88 or 90. You look at Julian Schnabel. I don't even really like the early work. I mean, I'm neutral on it.
00:40:15.275 - 00:40:30.963, Speaker A: Okay. Put plates on a painting. Fine. Some of it's actually quite funny. I have, you know, I will say it's got actually a very interesting humor and a critique of rationality. That early Julian Stabel. So I do enjoy actually early in Julian Stapple.
00:40:30.963 - 00:40:43.175, Speaker A: But it's at the later work. It's all boiled down. It's pared down. It's more minimalistic. It's far better in my opinion. Or at least it's its own thing. And for me, easier to consume and enjoy.
00:40:43.175 - 00:41:11.265, Speaker A: I think we did, we mentioned Richard Prince. Totally neutral on the early work. It's in the last 20 years. And how old is Richard Prince? I'm not sure that this, I mean, she mentions, she mentions Damien Hirst as being an example. So I just don't know if Damien Hirst is the best example in. In that case. So maybe Damien Hirst peak.
00:41:11.265 - 00:41:24.025, Speaker A: I don't know. We'll have to see. She said only time will tell. It's not clear when she was, you know, so who knows? There could be little rivalries there. I don't know. But I, Yeah, I. Not sure I agree with that for anybody.
00:41:24.025 - 00:41:48.471, Speaker A: And I'm not sure it's gender specific. It's actually how I'd put it. Space case. It's like, I mean, why do you make art? And are you going to stop. If you're really passionate, are you going to stop making art when you're 45? If you've already, you know, I'm 45. If you've already committed to the whole thing, like, you're not turning back now. Like, I would argue.
00:41:48.471 - 00:42:14.715, Speaker A: I'm not going to start like, okay, now I'm going to slow down. I mean, no, you've already kind of risked it all and now you just have to keep running, I would think. Anyways, let's continue. Space case. Another myth here, one of the most damaging myths is that artists must suffer for their work. That in order to make good art, you have to be tortured, seek and expect conflict, misery, imbalance, obsession, poverty and dysfunction. I promise you that is untrue.
00:42:14.715 - 00:42:57.183, Speaker A: And, yeah, this is very much a romantic notion. One could argue. You could even start taking it back to, you know, the Renaissance where you see Raphael, you know, big love life as far as I understand, and dying maybe from Some sort of, I think, venereal disease, perhaps, you know, you know, so maybe it goes back and there is, you know, something to be said, but I think it's way overblown. And you also think of some of. You know, I. I'm kind of, you know, and I didn't mention Warhol. The late Warhol, for me, is some of my favorites as well.
00:42:57.183 - 00:43:55.125, Speaker A: And the reason I mentioned Warhol is because, you know, I think art is moving more towards the businessman or business person. Businessman and businesswoman, but the business person kind of mindset that it's like, you know, it's. This is a cliche, I would argue, and there are some elements of truth in this sometimes, but really, I mean, you look at Ballard, JG Ballard, great, one of the great writers of the century, kind of a boring, so to speak, you know, wears his suit, lives in his little suburban home, no drama. But in the imagination, it was like, totally radical, super radical. So. And it's kind of like Magritte. It's like if you're really radical, you kind of want to dress up in a suit and, you know, make it seem like you're normal and fit in if it's that radical in the imagination, so to speak.
00:43:55.125 - 00:44:15.849, Speaker A: And so when people want to wear this on their sleeve, it actually is a bit of a, you know, I start getting suspicious, you know, from a aesthetic or, you know, artist point of view. So. Interesting comment. Everybody can have their own opinion on that. Just sharing mine here. Unknown collector. This kind of went around a lot of people celebrating Tezos.
00:44:15.849 - 00:44:55.933, Speaker A: I have a couple of them here. People outside the Tezos community often have no idea about the positive impact the space has had on the collectors involved. I've been here since 2022, and my life has changed every day in various ways, but always for the better. I've gained autonomy to the point where I can develop my own taste, have my own convictions about art, and support many artists from the global south, where some tez go a long way. I see my fellow collectors becoming independent as well, finding their taste while sharing their collection with the world, just like me. It's a really interesting point. You do tend to find a taste, so to speak, the more you're kind of, or even, as I almost put it, a visual language you start to speak and understand.
00:44:55.933 - 00:45:31.153, Speaker A: And that speaks to you is another way of kind of semantically saying kind of a similar idea. I don't know where I'd be without the Tezos NFT community. Yeah, where would this show be? I mean, look at how many object tabs are here? Right. I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude to all of you who have created incredible work that I'm proud of to have in my collection. Together we are stronger and also the myth in Tezos. Since May 2021, my life has changed completely for more than three years that I eat, dress and help my family with my creations. Of course, out of Buenos Aires, I met great people.
00:45:31.153 - 00:45:51.485, Speaker A: I will always be grateful to each of you. Don't be discouraged. Says a guy who lived most of his life discouraged. And I have to say, this scene is, I'd say, easily the most positive art scene I've ever seen. So something not to take for granted. So as these people are not. They are celebrating.
00:45:51.485 - 00:46:07.449, Speaker A: So I'd just echo what both those artists and collector are saying there. And many people added to that. Rosaceo GM all day. Flatbed print on acrylic sheet. So interesting. Look at this. So we saw some Rosatio.
00:46:07.449 - 00:46:31.455, Speaker A: Look at that. So you see Rosaceo's work in a kind of physical form that looks like it's worth money. Rosaceo, if you are watching this, looks like it is worth money. Very, very, very, very cool. Yeah. So I assume Rosaceo made that. It looks like a Rosaceo, doesn't it? Very powerful.
00:46:31.455 - 00:47:02.709, Speaker A: This was awesome too. So this is a swan sheep reflection, 40 x 30 cm. And this is I guess generative art, but I think using, I believe a marker or I believe this is a marker fineliner. So. Or what do you call those? A pen plotter. I believe, as you see here, it's not perfect. And again, very.
00:47:02.709 - 00:47:19.595, Speaker A: It's pretty awesome, the pen plotter, isn't it? Here's another example of the pen plotter. This is Gustavo. Algorithmic art. Captures precise rhythmic patterns coded in processing pen plotted on Axi draw blue ink on paper. One of one variable addition. And I think we have. Look at this.
00:47:19.595 - 00:47:42.593, Speaker A: So you know, doing what the human hand can't interestingly starts to become. I mean, theoretically a human hand could do this, but in theory it could. In practice, well, might be kind of hard, right? Yeah. Or it might take you a darn long time, whereas you just give it to the machine. So all very interesting. Let's jump into the works. Look at this.
00:47:42.593 - 00:48:17.725, Speaker A: After Paul Gauguin, Mujeres de Tahiti. So a spectacular work here by Nev 1914 to get us started. As you see here, the outlines instantly recognizable. There's something about this series that really they, they. And maybe it's just the fact that they're pastiches, but. But you see like you see NUV before, right? And it's cool. You do see some of it here, let's say in this work here, almost like the dark and the light contrasting.
00:48:17.725 - 00:48:36.485, Speaker A: You do see some of it here, but not super often. Right. And nav. Such a prolific artist. And there you see it a little bit, this kind of dark and light, this almost volumetric, these contrasts between dark and light gradients. Here you see it as well. I remember when these were coming out.
00:48:36.485 - 00:49:08.745, Speaker A: Here you see it. These are great. And so this series, I mean, look at how spectacular it looks here. We've looked at, I think, all of them. Almost all of them. And so all to say here, I think one of the reasons the series is working is the contrast between white and light and darks, I think is also one of the reasons it's so powerful here. It goes from almost black to white to black, so you get a nice volumetric and contrast.
00:49:08.745 - 00:49:26.771, Speaker A: So spectacular work here from NUV 1914. Instantly recognizable. Sold out. Still available for 27 tezos on secondary. I picked up one and so only, you know, 10, 2012 tezos more than primary. Let's continue. Here's Dan Control.
00:49:26.771 - 00:49:56.607, Speaker A: I don't know if I've ever seen this one, but more modern, contemporary objects. This almost neo pop work here where, you know, digital pop, so to speak. This could be a poster for some sort of digital pop, you know, themed, you know, conference or art fair. You know, laundry detergent, a lighter, a bullhorn, a iron. An iron, a clothes hanger. And this beautiful. The one kind of like putting it all together, repeating it.
00:49:56.607 - 00:50:16.557, Speaker A: Right. Reusing elements. Of course, these are all from other works. And then the one, you might say, creative decision, other than the layout, which there is a layout here, but the creative decision being the color. But really well chosen. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. From Dan Control, here is Zuozho, the abduction of Persephone.
00:50:16.557 - 00:51:01.843, Speaker A: So the Greek mythology continues. So the abduction of Persephone, that would be Pluto, I believe, stealing Persephone, the daughter, I believe, of Demeter, and taking Persephone to the underworld, where she will be queen of the underworld. And I think comes out maybe three, six months, a year, not sure. So accepts offer. 160 tazos from absurd deity. Nice sale. Well done.
00:51:01.843 - 00:51:26.569, Speaker A: This was interesting. Sean Keenan found this on. I'm not sure, I think it was on X somewhere. White Club fighting on the White House lawn. So not exactly sure, but I thought very. Not exactly sure what the title means, but the painting is awesome. And here it Almost looks like AI actually the way this is at least partly AI.
00:51:26.569 - 00:51:40.205, Speaker A: But then I don't know what this is. Maybe this is cut in. So just kind of a wild painting of what looks like two people fighting. Sean Keenan, one Tezos. And Mikey Wilson and magician picking one up. Frank Lep. Lep.
00:51:40.205 - 00:52:01.505, Speaker A: Frank Lepkowski Sunset Run. I thought this was pretty interesting. Almost like a gradient, but a painting with small gradients almost as you see here. So interesting digital painting from Frank Lepkowski Sunset Run. Edition of five. And that is sold out at five tezos each. Nice collector base here.
00:52:01.505 - 00:52:22.583, Speaker A: Ahek. Unknown collector, outsider and more. And guess who finally has put a ASCII work on super rare. This is an egg matris, flowers and vegetables modified by ASCII elements. And here is the work and really zooms up. Wow, this is a huge work. So as you see here.
00:52:22.583 - 00:52:52.425, Speaker A: So a beautiful kind of, I guess still life interestingly seems to be taken from some sort of, I don't know, some sort of old book or something. Interestingly and masked out and interesting as you see this diagonal going across here. Interesting masking. Very cool. So that back in the 1800s. James Vic. Yeah.
00:52:52.425 - 00:53:08.995, Speaker A: So you can read all the details here. Very cool. Enigmatic. This is Wok. And this is sold Premature baldness. Not sure what the reference photo is here. It almost looks like the hairdresser or something.
00:53:08.995 - 00:53:31.125, Speaker A: It is hard to tell, but that is part of the charm. It is almost foggy. It is familiar, but it is foggy and says by walk. And that went for 15 days. Interestingly as the numbers continue to climb for walk there on these what seemed like a daily works. Kurt Hustle Collective Watchguard. Let's press play.
00:53:31.125 - 00:54:09.115, Speaker A: Very rich feeling it brings. Nice textures. So a strange work by Kurt Elso Collective. Keeping things interesting over there. Watch guard edition of 10. And is this for sale yet? It is and it is sold out at 10 tezos each. Nice work.
00:54:09.115 - 00:54:31.595, Speaker A: And here is Retro Manny Round Infinity. Retro man versus Limbo. So they are facing off. And of course Limbo is the character here. Just like Mortal Kombat is the character with the eye in the TV or computer. And so pretty rad actually. Round 130 fight.
00:54:31.595 - 00:54:52.841, Speaker A: I love Mortal Kombat. So very cool. Modeled and animated in blender effects and compositing in after Effects. So very fun work. And that was transferred perhaps to previous collectors. And here is Limbo with a new work soul software. Of course.
00:54:52.841 - 00:55:15.777, Speaker A: Limbo makes the music here too. Game Boy color palette. Nice dithering there. Interesting dithering Mixed with interesting dithering. Mixed with computer. Sorry. With comic book art interest even in the frame.
00:55:15.777 - 00:55:35.645, Speaker A: Interesting dithering. So you can watch the whole thing on object. We'll see how it's doing. It's now 19 tazos on secondary. Sold out at 9 tazos on primary edition of 11. So very cool from limbo as usual. Here's, I thought, just an interesting piece.
00:55:35.645 - 00:56:01.185, Speaker A: Posted by Xen Excuse me. Posted by Xine on X. So just interesting, like with these stripes or lines kind of making up a skull. They're not the same size. Just kind of interesting work here. And then it seems to have all these kind of little vector tracings. And then added some gifery.
00:56:01.185 - 00:56:24.331, Speaker A: Basically some flashing different colors here. As you see, maybe two colors, three colors. Anyway, interesting. I follow Xine, of course, that is a glitch on X. The myth Patagonia. So referring to this earlier work here of the leopard rug, I'll have to. Maybe I can bring that up right now really quickly.
00:56:24.331 - 00:56:54.395, Speaker A: If you're looking for a classic work on tazos, this work evokes it. And this is also, you could argue, a classic work. Here's the myth, I assume in a comfy chair, looking off at what looks like Mount Etna in Sicily on perhaps his cruise ship here. And then the yellow, red and black homunculi and everything. And look at the shoes. Beautifully, beautifully done. That went for 77 tezos and I think it's still open.
00:56:54.395 - 00:57:13.419, Speaker A: Interestingly, I don't know if I'm going to be able to find the myths old. Maybe I can find it quickly. Things are loading up nicely. There it is. If you're looking for a classic, the myth in the room. I wish I owned this. This is a classic, classic, classic.
00:57:13.419 - 00:57:28.665, Speaker A: The man, the myth, the legend. And there's the myth in the office with money and the hen bag. Rad edition of 15. And yeah, we'd love to get that one. L'Inquisitor and the Myth. So this is Ms. Number 39.
00:57:28.665 - 00:57:50.973, Speaker A: So I'm not sure if these are collaborations or not. I think they might be. And there we see Burnsey Witch and or Linquisiteur and myth collaborating on a work. So very cool. That and that sold for 100 tezos to Stuart. So still continuing to sell very nicely there. Dana Ulama, GM new work.
00:57:50.973 - 00:58:12.027, Speaker A: So I assume this will be animated at some point, but not positive. Dana often animates her works. So cool. Often uses the fisheye perspective. Has kind of a cyberpunk meets vaporwave sort of vibe. Really interesting illustrator on the blockchain there. Uyoh66 brutal fight.
00:58:12.027 - 00:58:44.275, Speaker A: So good to see Uyo66 back on Tezo. So here you see two characters, kind of a psychedelic illustration and kind of has a nice texture paper texture so to speak. And it looks like two people fighting. Kind of psychedelic. And that is 25 Tezos now on secondary selling out at 10 Tezos on primary edition of 10. Here's Andre Sommer blues GM fam of course I follow Andre Summer Blues. That is a glitch and very cool.
00:58:44.275 - 00:59:09.353, Speaker A: I didn't see that posted in the community, I don't think. But here I'm glad I brought it up here. So very cool work here by Andre Sommer Blues. Again, kind of psychedelic illustration so could hang well with UYO there in the same show. Here is Ezra Eslin Halloween debate. So kind of funny. The witch and the Jack O Lantern are competing are debating make Halloween great again.
00:59:09.353 - 00:59:21.909, Speaker A: Breaking news CNN. So classic Ezra Eslin. This is an edition of 10 for 0.025 ETH on base. I believe it is base. So great to see new work there. Jake Studios.
00:59:21.909 - 00:59:52.779, Speaker A: This is with object 98. If you think it looks a little different from Jake Studios other work. And you see this, what looks like a helicopter crashing and there are some of the clouds. So Jake Studios working with Object Paint or Microsoft Paint 98 edition of 10 and foregone so far. And here's a very cool work in progress from Nicholas Dietrich. The lab has acquired a few bits of equipment. So actually if you go here you'll see an earlier work in progress.
00:59:52.779 - 01:00:13.355, Speaker A: Love seeing this. And even the flashing fluorescent lights. And there they are, I think flashing again. Wild and so very, very again. I always use this word with Nicholas Dietrich's work. Enigmatic, kind of surreal. Again, I think Ballard would love this work.
01:00:13.355 - 01:00:58.525, Speaker A: Kind of this kind of antiseptic hospital, dentist, kind of lab environment full of psychological suggestion, shall we say? What does it actually mean? Let's continue. Sabbato. I hear y'all like circles. So not sure if this is going to be posted somewhere. And so celebrating the circle and the different things that it can mean and that are referenced to the circle. So I'm not sure what the reference is here or why Sabato is doing this, but it's kind of fun actually. And it becomes this orb that's almost talking to you and all of these different references to the circle.
01:00:58.525 - 01:01:23.345, Speaker A: So I assume that will be minted somewhere. Here's Mech Txt. Good morning and kind of an interesting situation here. So probably going to Continue on chain, I assume. And here a Greek reference and interesting mountain with this cool kind of angle thing going on and juxtaposed with these sky elements. Very interesting. I like the background there too.
01:01:23.345 - 01:01:43.727, Speaker A: So looking like, you know, 256, if I had to guess. Maybe a little smaller. Maybe 200 cassette. This is a tribute to De Cherniak. Okay, so this, I think, where you saw the goose and that whole generative art series. So Braindead doing a tribute. I never actually connected that.
01:01:43.727 - 01:02:01.515, Speaker A: So doing a pixel art tribute here as part of, I think, Pixtober, if I'm not mistaken. So cool work there. And there is Sachu the Artie. Someone posted this. I think it was Retro Manny after hours. So interesting piece here. A different kind of pixel artwork.
01:02:01.515 - 01:02:30.877, Speaker A: And an alley here, as you see. And this was on object edition of 10 and sold out at 10 tezos each. And looks like it sold out within basically like same day, 13 hours. So it's a small community, but the collecting is intense. Takashi and Pamela Chirone Milotac. So cool combination here. And you see the energy that you often see in Chirone's work.
01:02:30.877 - 01:02:50.514, Speaker A: Takashi also putting out some pixel work recently. Here's Yuri J. The window. So another, you might say figurative work here. A representational work of a window by Yuri J. And I love, love, love the curtain here using 8badoo. Keeping it alive.
01:02:50.514 - 01:03:06.927, Speaker A: So awesome. And 6 sold at 10tezos. Nice work. Manadol with a beautiful work. Manidol. And probably P1. Yes, P with the one doing the music.
01:03:06.927 - 01:03:24.287, Speaker A: Manadol doing the art. Starting to feel like Christmas. Super charming. The first meeting is a coincidence, but the next ones are intentional. Very cute and heartwarming. That's on Rodeo. So very cool there.
01:03:24.287 - 01:03:39.443, Speaker A: And here is Anis Abden. A Yayi. This was just put on foundation. Let's see if it loads. I didn't realize this would be such a big file. Here it is. Okay.
01:03:39.443 - 01:03:52.707, Speaker A: Awesome. So beautiful. Pixel artwork by Annis Abdin. Of course. We did a space with Anis. Very experienced artist. And again doing I think 640 by 400.
01:03:52.707 - 01:04:09.295, Speaker A: Interesting. And putting out a work a day for all of this year. Obtainer. Are you ready? So interesting move here. Separating. Almost like a RGB separation of this. These eyes looking through a window.
01:04:09.295 - 01:04:36.455, Speaker A: Looking through an operating system window. Very cool. Here's Hermipe Pixel art. And I think Medium is a brand, if I'm not mistaken. I remixed the logo of the music label Medium, operated by Mazanori Nozawa based on my impressions. Of experimental music production techniques and release efforts. I make this arrangement that incorporates rainbow patterns flowing out of the frame, swirling like water, surface and logos gradually changing texture.
01:04:36.455 - 01:04:55.173, Speaker A: So very cool. Just love the text. And look at the different sized pixels going with vertical pixels, small pixels, large pixels. Right. Beautiful, Beautiful. Here is our milk. Every new day is a small reincarnation.
01:04:55.173 - 01:05:08.825, Speaker A: So I'm not sure if this is new. I assume it is. And this looks like Sanskrit here. Very cool. And that looks like a big recycling bin, if I had to guess. Hilariously. So reincarnation perhaps.
01:05:08.825 - 01:05:20.701, Speaker A: Very brilliant work from Armilk. And love how the pixelation leaves the screen. Loved the beige. Right. And just very original. Great. That was on Instagram.
01:05:20.701 - 01:05:58.665, Speaker A: Here's Haiti Rocket Hypoman edition of 10 and this was selling for 13 tezos each Nintendo Glitch. Wrong. And you just see the energy, the unmistakable energy of Haiti Rockette Destroy Secret Lab. So just always awesome. Destroy Secret Lab Hypoman edition of 10 on Tezos Perfect loop. And this was kind of a wild work here, taking operating system elements and putting a feedback on it, seemingly following up on our last work that we saw from them, which was similar in technique. Dementia.
01:05:58.665 - 01:06:28.455, Speaker A: My dad fights Alzheimer's and dementia for five years now. So this is an unfortunately an epidemic. And Braun is dealing with this epidemic. And here we have what looks like scans of the brain, you know. Yeah, exercise. The main reason, perhaps the top reason you should do exercise for many reasons, but perhaps the top reason is for your brain, for brain health. So it's an epidemic out there.
01:06:28.455 - 01:06:50.495, Speaker A: So all to say, very cool work. And two gone at eight tazos each. Here's Mika Aladef artifact 94 and interesting piece. I mean, again, another kind of super original, unmistakable artist. It's like pixel art and glitch or something combined. 1500 by 1500. And that is 850 edition of 9.
01:06:50.495 - 01:07:22.941, Speaker A: And foregone one selling to magician, which is awesome. You know, big shout out to Magician, by the way. I had a work in my computer is playing nice. I had a work here that I had an old. I had two listings and I always like to keep an addition of the editions. I like to keep one and I had had two listings on it because sometimes you might do it twice. Or if you screw up and you don't remove the old listings, you can have like two different listings.
01:07:22.941 - 01:07:41.765, Speaker A: So you think you have the right number, but you still have your old listing. So it ended up selling out. And luckily Magician had it three of them. And so was kind enough to send one Back after I messaged. And so big shout out and thank you to magician for doing that. Awesome person. Pixel Fool.
01:07:41.765 - 01:08:06.451, Speaker A: Check this out. Very cool. Interesting, right? Kind of minimal pixel art. Abstract, Right? Interesting, Interesting. And here is, I want to say Santiago Sua, but I don't, you know, here it is, Santiago Ruau. And you don't get to maximize. This is kind of my issue with these.
01:08:06.451 - 01:08:30.835, Speaker A: And I, you know, and I don't want to rain on anybody's brain because if people are, you know, it kind of sounds exciting, frankly. You put out an artwork and it performs like a stock. I'm not sure if this is what that is, but I think it is. But this is my issue. These platforms, why can't you maximize? It's kind of like, you know, that's where I start to get kind of have reservations. Number one. It's like, okay, is this about the art? You know, let me maximize this.
01:08:30.835 - 01:08:44.235, Speaker A: So. And then where the artist. It's very small here. The name. I mean, you could put the artist's name right here in large. So anyway, nice work. Nice.
01:08:44.235 - 01:09:04.123, Speaker A: A nice variation on a theme that Santiago has been working on. Love it. Cool colors, too. Here is Renki with new works, this time using blue, keeping the white grid. Interesting crop of the grid. You see how it goes? Nice. Like, I love that it doesn't just match up perfectly.
01:09:04.123 - 01:09:29.287, Speaker A: Gives it a lot more poetry, doesn't it? And here we see just more, you know, animated, abstract Newton from Renki. It's great to hear from Renki again. Renki has been on almost every show, I want to say, in the last, like, 300 shows. And I think it was like a couple of weeks ago. Renki was just like, thank you, Pokebelly, and was just great. Like, I'll show your work. Whatever.
01:09:29.287 - 01:09:49.313, Speaker A: It's. It's the work that kind of moves me. But it was awesome to hear from Renki, hilariously, because, yeah, I didn't even know if, you know, Renki's a mysterious, enigmatic figure. So it was awesome to hear from them. Caving Wild. This is an edition of five, so haven't looked at Caving Wild's work in a while. Interesting kind of abstract artist here.
01:09:49.313 - 01:10:00.785, Speaker A: Kind of minimal. Very consistent style disciples. And one selling to Daniel W. For 250. So pretty reasonably priced. Here's Ranix Deer. Look at this.
01:10:00.785 - 01:10:23.645, Speaker A: I'm not sure if this is with Kiro. I don't know, because I see what looks like some video overlay, but maybe that was Rannochsteer, all to say. Wonderful color, beautiful Work. It's almost like the equivalent of ambient music, isn't it? Very interesting. Here's another one. This is Kiro and Rannaxter. This is on Object Currents.
01:10:23.645 - 01:10:43.657, Speaker A: Let's see if it plays. So Rannochsteer kind of seeming to get more complex in the gradients. Interestingly playing with structure. Very cool addition of 20 for three tezos. 30 cents. And here's one more. This is just by Kiro.
01:10:43.657 - 01:11:03.969, Speaker A: One of these video paintings as I like to call them. And let's see if it loads up. This is on base and look at how great that looks. Love the texture and everything. Love the concept, love the color, all of it. So original. And this starting bit of only 0.0143
01:11:03.969 - 01:11:26.655, Speaker A: eth. I think it's called Gator. But Kiro and this was interesting. This was posted by Lejo X Neon Cells. I think they have a big exhibit Morphic Resonances via Fellowship Trust. And I think that's where you can do a residency. I'm not sure if the music is copyright or not, so I'll kind of go in and out.
01:11:26.655 - 01:12:00.623, Speaker A: Kind of looks like perhaps there's some AI just in the nature of the animation, but not positive on that. Created using neural frames and Photoshop. And what is neural frames? Discover a synthesizer for the visual world. So maybe this is what it's using. Interesting. So neural frames, a visual synthesizer. Who doesn't love that idea that, you know, has tried to make techno feels and I use techno in the general sense.
01:12:00.623 - 01:12:16.027, Speaker A: House, hip, hop, everything feels with a new work lanes. Interesting. And so we see Pixel fool coming back. We see. I mean Pixel fool never went away to be fair. And we see feels starting to mint a bit more. Very interesting.
01:12:16.027 - 01:12:33.005, Speaker A: Animated abstract from Feels. It's been around for, you know, I want to say since the beginning there at hen or at least very early. Runetune, Opheli, Photoshop and procreate.96 frames. So interesting. I wonder if referring to the artist Chris Ofili. Not sure.
01:12:33.005 - 01:12:55.333, Speaker A: Interesting. Is this drawn? It does look like a digital drawing and kind of a psychedelic work. Maybe I'll ask Runetoon about this today. He is the co host of course of the Spaces. So this is edition of 11 for 8 tazos 3 gone. So selling well. Ex mortal here again with Yesterday's Ghost.
01:12:55.333 - 01:13:21.793, Speaker A: So a couple of works I think by ex mortals. So here adding some people on the what looks like a beach wild glitch here. Wild in a great way. Now 2750 selling out at 1369. Very nice. And here's another Series again selling out Rifts by X Mortal. And this wonderful edge here.
01:13:21.793 - 01:13:39.865, Speaker A: And this great glitch of nature. Nature working well in the glitchery video. Analog glitch from xmortal. And here's Jada. Indeed, Jada is here. My Sunset Path edition of one. And also playing with landscape and the coastline there.
01:13:39.865 - 01:14:01.735, Speaker A: Nice rich, rich texture. And that sold for 25 tezos at auction to having fun. Here is Ivan Hugo light Blindness Canvas GLB VR Art, AR Art. So again on the cutting edge here of technology. These GLBs. That looks like. I love it.
01:14:01.735 - 01:14:22.083, Speaker A: That looks like VR art. Ar. So augmented reality art. GLB file painting in Vermillion VR oil painting simulator. How wild is that? Very well. I wonder if you can also export a PNG. Interestingly, I'd be curious to see that.
01:14:22.083 - 01:14:35.055, Speaker A: How much? 17 days. Nice work. Sky Goodman. Months of the caustic moon over the Vero mountain range. So cool landscape here by Sky Goodman. And beautiful textures. All sorts of glitchery going on here.
01:14:35.055 - 01:14:55.983, Speaker A: And textures and noise in this beautiful landscape. Edition of seven for seven tazos. And it looks like there is one left from Sky Goodman. Beautiful work by Scamra. A great texture here. Kind of a different color palette a little bit. And yeah, this is on object.
01:14:55.983 - 01:15:18.539, Speaker A: Shall we see what it sold for? If it sold edition of one? It is at Mikey Wilson bidding 18 tazos. It is at auction. Beautiful, beautiful texture there. I love how Skomra has taken that. Like hasn't really deviated too much and is just continuing to explore and push that idea further and further and further. Getting very good at it. Here's Tubecan.
01:15:18.539 - 01:15:36.031, Speaker A: Sold. Thanks to Greg Nikshumika of this. And we'll see. Okay, here's the work by Tubecan and we'll just see. Sold for 20 tazos. I believe. So Interesting textures here.
01:15:36.031 - 01:16:04.239, Speaker A: Pretty wild experimentation going on in the AI art side of things as well as here with Lily Illo. Good morning. Kind of a very different looking work here from Lily Illo. Very cool. As we continue to the evening sun. So all sorts of wild AI artwork going on here. Again, images that were probably theoretically possible but practically, probably impossible from a practical perspective.
01:16:04.239 - 01:16:24.991, Speaker A: Pre AI. No hygiene. New aesthetics being discovered there. And AI is with here. I mean, no hygiene. I mean this radical, radical work here. This rough pixelation, this weird collage just wins the weird contest with the green light at the background.
01:16:24.991 - 01:16:48.697, Speaker A: Say no. Edition of 1.20tazos. As we move into the physicals. Charlie James Gallery. This is the Perez Brothers firm. So is who is the artist here? The Prez by the Perez Brothers Perez Bros. A Los Angeles based duo whose work celebrates and embodies the lowriders and car clubs of la's.
01:16:48.697 - 01:17:09.015, Speaker A: Of la. So I thought a pretty cool work here. Interesting kind of divider here that goes right in the middle, that gray thing. Maybe we get a closer look. I thought just a very fun painting there. I love the monochromatic palette as well. Taylor A white.
01:17:09.015 - 01:17:23.927, Speaker A: Both Dogs, 2024, oil on canvas. Seated in New York at the Hole. I think Runtune has mentioned the Hole. Who lives in New York. Very cool painting here. Looks great. Very nice work.
01:17:23.927 - 01:17:45.879, Speaker A: I mean, it's interesting thought experiment time. If you think of Freeze, right? I mean, imagine this was at Freeze. I'd be like, oh, yeah, that's pretty good. As well as this. This is. It's not gallery posting. Brock Sanders Saunders doing the Boston Dynamics Dog, but this time with a gun, interestingly, and kind of a wild.
01:17:45.879 - 01:18:11.065, Speaker A: Again, challenging aesthetics here, but well done. So very cool work there. Romero Papa Papa Pap, Rocky Mira Art Fair opening tonight. And this is solo show of Picardo Mario. So maybe Mario Picardo with this new series of paintings inspired by Condorito, the famous Chilean comic strip. Interesting. So maybe maybe some of you have heard of that.
01:18:11.065 - 01:18:52.145, Speaker A: And really interesting painting style here. So as you see Instagram competing quite well with Freeze. I would say from a work, just from a general visual perspective, taking a step back, maybe a shocking comment for some, but Snake of Thorns X Hunt Souls, another interesting piece here kind of illustration. But interestingly, this watercolor, you could say, oh, it's just an illustration. But then you see the watercolor, it's like, oh, this is like still kind of painting and everything. Kind of, I would argue, you know, to be maybe controversial. Again, this does seem to add a kind of painterly value to the value of the work.
01:18:52.145 - 01:19:09.549, Speaker A: I would say just from a collector viewpoint, interesting, surreal illustration. That all being said, a beautiful work and great color. And again, nice kind of what seems like watercolor in the yellow there. And that's your show, everyone. How are we doing? One hour and 19 minutes. I'm still trying to shorten the show. Thank you for joining me again.
01:19:09.549 - 01:19:14.165, Speaker A: Maybe I'll see you with Son of Stag later. Later today. Until next time, take care.
