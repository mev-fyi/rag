00:00:05.440 - 00:00:48.526, Speaker A: You know, I looked at this work here about a minute ago, and I said to myself, is this abstraction? Is this abstraction, or am I looking at something else? Am I staring into the heart of technology itself? I said to myself, artist journal, February 14, 2023, broadcasting from Berlin, Germany, which doesn't like Valentine's day, let me tell you. Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day is not too cool out in Berlin. Which kind of, you know, gives me a. It puts a soft spot in my heart for Berlin. Maybe for that reason, I wish my girlfriend happy Valentine's Day. She's like, ah, you're so north american, which is kind of hilarious.
00:00:48.526 - 00:01:23.422, Speaker A: But anyway, welcome back, everyone. And again, I'm thrilled for you to be here. Thank you for all the support, as usual. So look at this incredible work. And again, this is Tuks, who we were just looking at yesterday and the day before, where he was mentioning, where Tuks was mentioning that Tuks is using chat GPT to create the prompt for the mid journey. They were using chat GPT and mid journey. So, pretty fascinating.
00:01:23.422 - 00:02:37.310, Speaker A: And when you look at it now, tewks did say that they were kind of, you know, putting like, or mixing variations together. So there is some human editing at some point here, perhaps. But I mean, you look at this and it really does feel like machine art, doesn't it? So anyways, so, and look at the great contrast here with the soft kinda. Again, kinda, you see that, how it fades out with the almost, like print? You know, it fades out here on the side, this gradient, and then the hard shapes in the middle, creating this hard contrast, and then this mysterious thing right here, which maybe, just maybe just adds a nice kind of grounding element to the whole composition. Almost makes it representational, as if this is a tree or a vase of flowers, you know? So anyway, interesting work, this on super rare enigma. Great title, toques. And this went yesterday for an ETH $1500 on February 13, and it was listed on February 10.
00:02:37.310 - 00:03:21.654, Speaker A: Pablo Puncaso, who we see quite a bit, is kind of on a tear as well. Let's just see if we see any more details here, then we're going to run through this episode. As per usual, Enigma is a mesmerizing abstract piece created with artificial intelligence. It features a chaotic yet harmonious mix of shapes, colors and lines that seems to be in constant state of flux. The overall effect is one of enigmatic beauty, as the viewer is drawn into a seemingly infinite abyss of abstract forms. Good writer. So the artist has created a truly unique and captivating abstract work that challenges the viewer to find meaning and coherence amidst the chaos.
00:03:21.654 - 00:03:52.968, Speaker A: Whether viewed up closer from a distance, enigma is sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who encounters it. Well, it sure does. So anyways, pretty interesting. And I brought up Tooke's other work here. So we see the evolution, and of course, we've looked at Tewks's work on object as well, and kind of a similar evolution, but, you know, putting out some different series. So anyways, it kind of looks and feels like a bit of a breakthrough work. Maybe that's just the hard contrast that makes it feel that way.
00:03:52.968 - 00:04:20.698, Speaker A: But it definitely turned my head. I mean, again, you feel like you're staring into the heart of a machine. Okay. Deliriously wild, borderline deranged, psychedelic, multisensory outburst. So out of Brazil, and we love that over here, the internationalism. Speaking of internationalism, tomorrow, Wednesday at 09:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time in New York and 330 in Berlin.
00:04:20.698 - 00:04:54.494, Speaker A: Gogolitis is joining us for a Twitter. Spaces is joining me and runetune for a wonderful pixel art salon. And I am going to ask Gogolitis all about his work and everything, pixel art and what his thoughts are on pixel art. So that should be a ton of fun. I have pinned this on my twitter, so if you want to check that out, just put a little reminder there and you can attend. And I believe gogolitis is out of France. So again, this very international crowd.
00:04:54.494 - 00:05:15.484, Speaker A: And of course, rune tunes in New York, I'm in Berlin, and then everybody who shows up, it should be a ton of fun. Come hang out with gogolitis. I mean, it sounds wonderful. And this is gogolitis. Okay, so an awesome, awesome pixel artist. It's called Scrollflow XY, so it looks like using a bunch of sliders. I don't think it's for sale yet.
00:05:15.484 - 00:05:54.544, Speaker A: And just minted yesterday. So again, we see these gorgeous, gorgeous colors here that are put onto his latest work here. And we also saw it with the one that was out yesterday, increasing the size of the signature too. Again, sometimes taking breaks is really great to just come back fresh and then you just start making all these little changes. I love it. I find signatures in digital art to be a really fascinating kind of subject because I think by default we don't really sign our work typically, but I love it. I think one don't knows also signs his work, and there are a couple of others that I can.
00:05:54.544 - 00:06:23.482, Speaker A: That I can't think of off the top of my head, but not many people sign their work. I think maybe Popple signs his work, you know? So it's something that I think about as an artist, you know? Cause sometimes I've tried, say, with just a signature, and sometimes it doesn't always feel right, you know? So anyway, a nice, clean solution from gogolitis here. So again, come hang out. That should be a ton of fun. That'll go out on rug radio, and that'll be out on Spotify. So we're multi. Not only.
00:06:23.482 - 00:07:01.764, Speaker A: Not only are we multi chain and multimedia, we're multi platform. We're on YouTube, we're on Twitter. And it's tempting. Again, I don't want to take too long here, but you might find this interesting. I mean, you look at the Twitter blue and, you know, all the check mark and everything and everything, but the video, you can upload high hd video. So that kind of also feeds into this whole idea of multi platform, right? And I think that's the way to go. I mean, Farouk at Rugradio, he calls it, he says everyone is their own platform, which I think is another way of basically saying, go multi platform.
00:07:01.764 - 00:07:30.720, Speaker A: You know, you kind of. Because it's just. Why not, you know? And I also think, again, the short form, short. You know, take snippets from the Twitter spaces and then you put those out on TikTok and YouTube shorts, et cetera. I mean, you know, and that stuff gets pushed hard by the platforms right now. Anyway, gorgeous work from Gogolite us here all over the place today. So we were discussing curation yesterday, and I have a few more examples here coming up.
00:07:30.720 - 00:08:18.824, Speaker A: And so, design collector, thank you for chiming in. As for worlds, this is what they're calling their curated product, for lack of better term, on foundation. I was wondering out loud to myself, do you need permission of the artist to make a curated collection? And I kind of like this idea of not, because I think then it's just there's nothing stopping you and you can just start to gather stuff together. But I do understand this idea of not, you know, maybe needing to get permission. Anyway, design collector has said you have to have a list of agreed accounts that will list work into the world. So as it stands, you have to have a agreed. But, you know, it brings up, like, you look at the analogy of DJ playlists.
00:08:18.824 - 00:08:49.794, Speaker A: Like, am I asking the Beatles or am I asking the Rolling Stones if I can put it in? And what would happen to say, even techno, great techno dj's, if they had to ask permission of everybody to put it into their playlist? And what would that do to the art of djing? So just, you know, maybe this is different, though. Maybe this is different. So just kind of fun. Fun to think about, though, and shout out to Axeen. And this is not over. I mean, it's human nature. We tend to.
00:08:49.794 - 00:09:16.444, Speaker A: We tend to forget tragedy pretty quickly. And so, anyways, this is not over. Thank you, Pokebelly, for spreading the news about tezquake aid. And I think it's just important we keep it top of mind. As I said, the numbers are hard to process. I mean, the last I looked, it's like, I think the Un is estimated 50,000 people dead. And I think right now the tally is at like 33 or 35,000.
00:09:16.444 - 00:09:52.734, Speaker A: So, yeah. So continue to support this. And if you want to know how to mint work in order to donate, look at the last video and you can find details on that. Shout out to Aksene and all our turkish and syrian artists out there. Here's a work by Axin you can't help but feel this was just posted on Twitter, and you can't help but feel with that title that, you know, that this has something to do with the situation alive. So. And it's interesting to see, like, I mean, Axin was kind of like a machine there.
00:09:52.734 - 00:10:22.902, Speaker A: And ever since the quake, I mean, yeah, it probably helps you reassess everything and, yeah, so anyway, he is making work, and as artists do, alive. I want to return to this. We looked at this yesterday, but there's a huge, huge, hilarious detail that I missed. And it was here. It's Cosimo. This is by rare, of course, the digital painter who does the Boston dynamics. Dogs and beautiful light here, too, as I was mentioning yesterday.
00:10:22.902 - 00:10:48.444, Speaker A: But this is what I missed. You see the green hand and the green face with the purple sunglasses? That is Cosimo de Medici there that he has put in the armor. So a hilarious. Another substitution there. A hilarious detail from rare. So just wanted to point that out because I only noticed it after. I'm often very late to figure this stuff out.
00:10:48.444 - 00:11:20.658, Speaker A: My girlfriend is much faster at noticing and observing these kinds of things, but I do eventually figure it out. And so this was just, while we're here. Jello peas. This was just an interesting little detail. Looks like ringers. So this is a ringer by Dmitri Cherniak, by artblocks. IO artist Dmitry Cherniak, along with many other grails, is now in the permanent collection of the Los Angeles Contemporary Museum of Art, LACMA, thanks to Cosmo Medici.
00:11:20.658 - 00:11:50.708, Speaker A: So it's kind of interesting, right? Because then they have the Medici collection, which, again, I feel is it's a little too close to the original Medicis, but we'll let that slide for everything that Cosmo de Medici has done for the space. But, yeah, so you go to the laCMa, and then you'll see the Medici collection here. And then you'll see. So I assume. I don't know if he's donated. It'd be strange to see him donate the cryptopunk, but maybe they're just. I assume it's a partnership.
00:11:50.708 - 00:12:21.628, Speaker A: So, anyways, interesting, though, I guess the moral of this story is the institutions are work. Have not forgotten this space, as one would expect. So there is movement there. And here is a funny one, also by rare that he just posted on Twitter here, a Boston dynamics dog creating problems for its owner. Inside here, a bad boy. One of one on the 15th. So you can get that tomorrow.
00:12:21.628 - 00:12:41.120, Speaker A: You can bid on that. And just back to this. Curated the value of curation for artists here. So Sabato, holy presal. Got a bid for 0.33 ETH, and it's going for the next 20 hours. Big thank you to site ETH for kicking off the auction.
00:12:41.120 - 00:13:05.584, Speaker A: I'm speechless. So this was in that show that we were looking at yesterday with the RJ. And so isn't that great? And again, it's this. This is a work that I think originally Sabato was trying to get on form function with and then didn't work out. And then. So here it is on ETH. So all to say, like, he's had this work for a few months, as far as I understand.
00:13:05.584 - 00:13:31.810, Speaker A: And again, the power of curation to kind of re bring attention to works. I brought up a few others here, too. So this is from foundation's homepage. And then you click on one of the worlds, which, again, is the. What they use for the curated shows. So here's GM world. And again, it's just like, you see the shopping experience for the collector here, or even just the art.
00:13:31.810 - 00:14:11.804, Speaker A: You know, someone who's interested in art, it's a really nice way to kind of put order into the chaos, right, of digital art, you know, collecting and. And everything. So here's another one. Yoga Bonito. And here again, so, you know, I love seeing this and I think it's really exciting, and I'm kind of waiting for object to get on this. And again, I would love to see it where, you know, you know, as long as things aren't being combined with, like, offensive imagery, I don't see any problem, you know, with. If you could just start assembling whatever, you don't even need to own it.
00:14:11.804 - 00:14:41.428, Speaker A: You know, I think it would be really fun because that what that does, it's kind of like an open gate policy, but it kind of lets the curators go wild. And then you can find all sorts of talents out there that maybe don't want to be hassled with messaging people, can I do this? And all of a sudden it's just like, it could really push the space forward. So just food for thought. Just an idea. Feel free to disagree. And here's another one. Love curated by funky non fungi.
00:14:41.428 - 00:15:10.560, Speaker A: None. And of these course of joa in here, it's beautiful work here. So again, I'm just kind of all over this. This looks like demon ego. And I think also here, by seeing familiar artists here, flannel collective, and I think they had one that, yeah, we were looking at Luciana the other day by seeing, we see how small the space is here, too, in these curated collections. Like, we see a lot of familiar artists here. Like, this isn't like tens of thousands of artists coming in.
00:15:10.560 - 00:15:39.684, Speaker A: I feel like we have a few hundred rare says, maybe this space is a few thousand people. I totally agree. And back to posting work on Twitter. So I just came across this work here by complex and I thought, oh, that's a pretty interesting kind of still life ish kind of work. GM from the RBI dog, originally a one of one, will now be split into 15 editions. It's back to this idea. So I went to complex's thing and I went to the links.
00:15:39.684 - 00:16:19.296, Speaker A: An interesting description here, making art about our ordinary lives. It's kind of a pop art feel to it, or pop art approach. And so then I started looking, I was like, oh, they're on super rare. And so again, this discovery through posting on Twitter is extremely powerful. I keep telling myself, you know, so anyways, yeah, so you see like eggs here, and it's pretty interesting. I mean, the sales are impressive and, you know, at the same time and you see the depth and how many artists there are in this space by virtue of how many we discover every day. So that is the other side of it here.
00:16:19.296 - 00:16:48.504, Speaker A: So banana split was posted a few weeks ago, January 24, and it looks like it went to Nifty Nika. So just kind of interesting work here. There's a lot of illustration in this episode. It's kind of the illustration photography episode a tiny bit here. And so anyways, I thought it was just kind of interesting to see here, a little bit of texture in the background here. Almost a print feel to it. And remember how we saw Debbie T.
00:16:48.504 - 00:17:27.906, Speaker A: Made that gorgeous, I think, chicle print? And this stuff, this work here is just crying out for that same treatment, isn't it? So, anyways, and again, so we don't know how much this one went for, but this person sells complex or so complexed. Yeah, sock. So complexed or complexed sells for pretty serious. This one was transferred, so we don't know the price on that one either. Really cool. Again, gives a weainty bode kind of pop feel to it in terms of its theme, in terms of its execution. It's just super modern.
00:17:27.906 - 00:17:48.026, Speaker A: Looks like digital art. You know, digital illustration is what I call this. But, I mean, this gives us a clue as to what these are going for. Six ETH. So, again, strawberry sundae here. So, again, you know, pretty impressive, I guess, is what I'm trying to say here. And interesting perspective here, too.
00:17:48.026 - 00:18:29.586, Speaker A: You know, like, here you see, I guess, you know, kind of a three quarter view or kind of looking down at the Sunday, but then you see the spoon here is kind of like, looks like straight down on its perspective and kind of same with the tablecloth. So interesting things going on here. This is not just a simple, you know, transcription of a photo, so to speak, with some decoration. So, anyways, six ETH deluxe with extra toppings. When was this? This was just recently, January 2. So super impressive. And another illustrator on super rare, and I think I saw this on the super rare bot, won an auction for half an ETH.
00:18:29.586 - 00:19:18.732, Speaker A: And this is voodoo salad. Wrong turn. So, again, just kind of interesting, right? And I'm tempted to start placing this into, like, a 1960s psychedelia, you know, zap comics type illustration. But it doesn't quite like, it's maybe just a tiny bit, but it's a distant reference. And so sometimes you're just forced to actually look at the image for itself before you put on all these abstract categorizations. And what do we see? We see, I mean, we see a dinosaur kind of head with a human hand and human feet and all this kind of wild imagery coming out of a, looks like a medieval city block or maybe like a circus type thing with a river street. So pretty interesting.
00:19:18.732 - 00:19:41.980, Speaker A: Even the clouds. Look at the clouds and the red orange sky. So half an ETH for all that creativity is not a bad deal. Gingershot was cruising with his friend and saw a small town near the city. They never would have thought what awaits them when they entered. Pretty cool, right? I mean, I'm not sure where voodoo salad is from. The middle of nowhere is where they're from.
00:19:41.980 - 00:20:03.160, Speaker A: Illustrator from the middle of nowhere. And here's some of voodoo salad's other work. And, you know, you see, to me, this looks like a more complex composition. Like, again, we're seeing this evolution here. It's kind of straight on and then side by side. Straight on and then three quarters straight on. Straight on, straight on.
00:20:03.160 - 00:20:17.370, Speaker A: And then, like, this is a pretty complex composition. So pretty cool. It looks great. Voodoo salad. Another new artist, Ezra Eslin. And this is for. She's based out of Istanbul, as far as I remember.
00:20:17.370 - 00:20:37.392, Speaker A: And so this is for Tez Quake aid. It's not listed loud and clear, but this is going to be. All proceeds will be donated. And so this is Vanessa with a cool, you know, earring for a tooth. So who knows? Maybe this is a friend of hers or something. Pretty cool work from Ezra Eslund. Interesting colors, too.
00:20:37.392 - 00:21:05.136, Speaker A: Using the sparkles again and in her trademark, instantly recognizable style edition of 300. Buy for five and raise some money for Tezquake aid. And here is more. So another illustrator. Now, this one I saw, I think, from the flannel world that we were just looking at. And it brought me back to, oh, what about this artist? We looked at them maybe a couple of months ago. They're in the super chief world.
00:21:05.136 - 00:21:19.040, Speaker A: And so this is available just minted crybaby. Cry baby. And this is on super world. So very cool. And just a really cool illustrator here. What is their name again? Yosni. Yosnier.
00:21:19.040 - 00:21:31.272, Speaker A: Josnie. So very cool. And the reserve is going up. Went up from three to five. And they're a pretty cool artist. Again, super original. So lots of illustrators here.
00:21:31.272 - 00:21:51.424, Speaker A: Bit of a tarot card feel to it. Tiny bit. And here's some of their other work on foundation. 50 collectors curated in one world. And here it is. So just kind of cool again. Kind of has that rider tarot deck feel to it a tiny bit for a context.
00:21:51.424 - 00:22:14.514, Speaker A: So anyways, really cool. I think I was mentioning that the last time I saw their work. Very cool. And of course, we could not have a show without Flora Marquez here. And this looks like a bit of a jester here. I love how, you know what this reminds me of, too, these works is those drawings that you'll see sometimes for, like, costume designers for like, a play. Let's say you were designing.
00:22:14.514 - 00:22:34.296, Speaker A: That's what my grandma used to do. Shout out to Nana, wherever you are out there. And it kind of reminds me of those, you know, designs you would see for costumes in a play. And so this is really cool. Maybe that's why I like Flora Marquez. Works so much. Let's look for things to celebrate.
00:22:34.296 - 00:22:47.600, Speaker A: Absolutely. And so this probably went for 15, went for a song to Mello Dora. So very, very cool work. And again. Yeah, just love it. Daniel W. With a new one.
00:22:47.600 - 00:23:14.816, Speaker A: And this is really interesting as well. Always learned here from Daniel W. So this has to do with alchemy. And this is the, you know, in alchemy, one of the central images is the mixing. Not the mixing jar, but the mixing bowl where you mix everything. And anyway, check out Daniel W's write up, stage four. I guess he's taking you through the stages of the alchemical stages, literally.
00:23:14.816 - 00:24:03.248, Speaker A: And this is Rubido, the redness of life. It must have what the alchemist called the rubido, the redness of life. So you can read this for yourself. We will keep going. But Carl Jung, of course, was very interested in alchemy and kind of saw it as a bit of a, you know, would this be like a psychological template? I don't know. We need to revisit that. But he was very obsessed with alchemy and kind of, I think, what it represented from a psychological, you know, again, like this idea that when you mix something and then it comes out transformed, this could be applied to the soul and to psychology and this sort of thing.
00:24:03.248 - 00:24:21.048, Speaker A: Kind of a distant analogy. And Terence McKenna actually has some fascinating, fascinating lectures that you can find online on alchemy, which I highly recommend. He probably explains it quite well, the connection there. Anyway, cool work. Lest we forget the drawing here. Classic Daniel. Wow.
00:24:21.048 - 00:24:42.968, Speaker A: Available for six, edition of 36. Great topic as usual. Day and night by Puya, a new artist. I think gogolitis retweeted this. I thought it was pretty cool. Just an interesting work on object here and a simple kind of day and night piece with some nice animation and a river going through both. Pretty cool.
00:24:42.968 - 00:25:17.070, Speaker A: Uniting both the windows here, an animated landscape illustration depicting puja world, showcasing various multiverses that have distinct styles. This is my main world, featuring my personal touch. So, Puya, a new artist to check out. Buy for 15. Is that on secondary? Yes. And just very quickly, this went for 550 on primary gloom tube with an interesting kind of illustrative Mickey Mouse reference. Looks like a 1920s Mickey Mouse with a gloom tomb with a gloom tube head on it back in the day.
00:25:17.070 - 00:25:44.898, Speaker A: Buy for $3.89 edition of 100. I actually won one of these because I've collected a gloom tube one of one way back when they were cheap, much cheaper, let's put it that way. And as part of that, you get a collector card. And with that collector card you get in a draw every time he mints a work. And then he gives three people an addition or something like that, or one person or whatever the case may be. So that's a cool mechanic too.
00:25:44.898 - 00:26:15.748, Speaker A: And just another feature of the NFT digital art space. So back in the day, a nice reference to, one would assume Mickey Mouse. And continuing on Kappa, pain and ambition in the digital. Now, Kappa Sage has been referencing a lot of his own work in his work. So here we see it again. So this is a Kappa sage, and this is a whole bunch of kappasage works down here. And this one I haven't seen, but maybe a reference to Turkey, perhaps not sure.
00:26:15.748 - 00:26:45.024, Speaker A: And so a more mysteriousness and almost like a camouflage on the, you see, you know, on the skin here and a turkey. So anyway, in a pepe the frog kind of, you know, toy. So anyways, just kind of mysterious here. Buy for six, edition of twelve. This is probably going to be gone by the time you check. And here's another work by board me social club, who we also like to follow here. An interesting pop art reference.
00:26:45.024 - 00:27:17.412, Speaker A: Kind of looks like Ronald McDonald with a star of Satan there. Right in the middle there, not sure. And adding to the face here and maybe giving the finger. So all sorts of outrageousness here and interest and this. Yeah, so who knows what's going on here. A bunch of happy faces, a couple of ghosts. So the surrealism and almost another Mickey Mouse reference here, the surrealism continues with boardme social Club, Tree of Life with Ronald McDonald there.
00:27:17.412 - 00:27:54.480, Speaker A: Maybe that's, you know, truer than I'm comfortable with here. Edition of 15 for five. And look at Dan Control continuing to push the envelope here with Lara Croft, a fictional character. So of course this is from Tomb Raider. And he kind of blocked her out in terms of just, you know, she was presenting as a highly intelligent and athletic british archaeologist who ventures into ancient tombs and hazardous ruins around the world. And it looks like he kind of gave her a bit of a Minecraft treatment or something, kind of a blocky treatment. So just kind of interesting work from Dan control.
00:27:54.480 - 00:28:27.378, Speaker A: That was on Instagram. I didn't see it minted anywhere. Santiago never find me raw output from text to image tools and gimp. So again, I assume there's some AI in here and then put into Gimp, the free Photoshop type software. Photoshop like software, I believe and so anyways, just kind of interesting. More experimentation, kind of half representational with some plant like stuff, but half abstract, just interesting work. It really kind of stood out.
00:28:27.378 - 00:28:50.952, Speaker A: And all this airbrush kind of work. So just interesting. From Santiago, buy for eight, edition of 20. I believe Sabato retweeted this one. He's a great follow, by the way, on Twitter. If you're looking for just different kinds of art, many images I have taken from Sabato's retweets there. So mega dreamcast by xmortal.
00:28:50.952 - 00:29:17.224, Speaker A: Just kind of an interesting, you know, kind of a Shiva anime type figure. And, you know, the full 3d kinda. I don't know if I'd call it glitchy, but just kind of videoy. And there you go. So anyways, interesting colors and everything. Video created and captured in real time using all hardware, modular video synthesizers and vintage video mixing equipment. Interesting.
00:29:17.224 - 00:29:36.552, Speaker A: So maybe this is based on a sculpture. Buy for seven, edition of 15. Here's some of ex mortals other work, PBS. I love that. Public broadcasting here. And, yeah, so just, you know, more kind of glitch. Video art, for lack of better term.
00:29:36.552 - 00:29:59.022, Speaker A: And they have a new one here, pier six. How are we doing? We are at the 30 minutes mark. Well, we cannot miss eight, so this should actually be a nicely timed episode in terms of not too long. Look at how beautiful these colors are. This is a one of one by Eizo. So one of the final works, at least for the time being, by Eizo. I love the color here.
00:29:59.022 - 00:30:35.820, Speaker A: And this is 200 tazos, one of one still available. This was minted yesterday, so if you want a one of one eight, so you know where to go. And Kurt Hussle collective with another mysterious work. He's got a couple of these, like, what I want to call, like, dad works telling you what to do. Words of red bean. There's another one here. This one here.
00:30:35.820 - 00:30:53.180, Speaker A: This art sucks. So, yeah, it's almost like get off my lawn type character here. So anyways. And bad art. I missed that one, too. So anyways, pretty interesting work as ever from Kurt Hustle collective. I'll never predict what they'll put out next.
00:30:53.180 - 00:31:21.560, Speaker A: And that's half of what I love about them. The other half is the art. John with another kind of studio work, which is interesting. So he seems to be doing these, I think, daily. And so just kind of interesting color and playing with his window trope, but with the artist in the studio cutting some cardboard paper, and it looks like it's Valentine's Day. Everyone it is Valentine's Day. Cutting out some paper hearts.
00:31:21.560 - 00:31:48.526, Speaker A: So isn't that cute? Looks like he's making Valentine's Day cards. I should make a card like that. Continuing on, Tom bimbattle with golden desert. So interesting kind of variation on this character here. So the character is going through the desert with the pyramids of Giza and a UFO, and UFO's are in the news. So maybe that has something to do with it. You see here, this almost looks like a signature here in the top left.
00:31:48.526 - 00:32:05.396, Speaker A: And there is the sphinx. So anyways, this collection continues to do super well. Let's just see. Went for six on primary and let's just see how quickly they're selling. 638. It was minted and sold out by 820. So I mean, still a very healthy market.
00:32:05.396 - 00:32:29.356, Speaker A: I mean, selling out in an hour or so. An addition of 25. And he's putting these out pretty regularly. Naughty Fox lab with a cool. I guess this is another Valentine's Day work and kind of looks like reminiscent of Saint Sebastian with the arrows in it, but just one person. So very interesting. Will you be my valentine cool work for 0.69
00:32:29.356 - 00:32:48.604, Speaker A: Tezo cents? Bite by bit with a few more nebulas here that kind of caught my eye. And this is planet pixel Fly Nebula. And of course, this is using retro tools, as I like to call them, or vintage software. Pc paint 3.1. And so very fun. The fun continues with Byte by bit. Here's another one.
00:32:48.604 - 00:33:02.308, Speaker A: Heart Nebula. So pretty awesome. And there are more. This is located in the constellation Cassiopeia. And Lorna Mills. Gracious Riverman. This is for Tez Quake fundraiser.
00:33:02.308 - 00:33:26.614, Speaker A: Buy for five edition of 100. And it's a pretty cool one from Lorna Mills here, with the bird staring at you in her trademark, you know, pixelated mask here. So very cool. Huge eyes, isn't it? Aren't they? Continuing on. Strange title too. Gracious Riverman. So 100% will go to the quake test.
00:33:26.614 - 00:33:51.322, Speaker A: Quake fundraiser. And continuing on. Just a cool study from Rosatio. Still from my quick 20 minutes study. This one is crazier than usual. So just kind of cool work from Rosettio GM and continuing on. And that is collage, digital collage and painting, I think.
00:33:51.322 - 00:34:31.915, Speaker A: Mostly collage, I think. Does Rosatio say visual artists working with collage and drawing? Yeah. So probably a combination Bolin 132 with a pretty cool collage. Digital collage. Here I was trying to figure this out and there's digital painting and I was like, is this digital painting? But I have a feeling, just a feeling I don't know, but I have a feeling this is collage. Like, this is probably taken from somewhere and then pasted in and worked in this brushstroke here. So anyways, I thought really good looking, like, I thought really effective, let's put it that way.
00:34:31.915 - 00:35:10.440, Speaker A: So it's interesting to paint with Photoshop here or with your digital art tools and using paint, a really effective version. This sold how much? Only for 15. Sold out in 40 minutes. Another interesting digital painter here, Venta, with some more experimentation and seems to be pushing it a little bit with the. So first there's a sample, what I think are sampled brushes here, and then we just have masking here. And it's almost reminiscent of the AI. Like, it's tempting to think that the AI was the source.
00:35:10.440 - 00:35:59.528, Speaker A: I'm actually working on a work right now that the composite, this is how I always sort of imagined of working on AI, is you create a composition using AI to give you that composition you like and find, and then you use that as basically a foundation, and then you, as you almost trace over or just use that as a reference to create your work. This kind of gives me that sensation, that sense that maybe there's AI work that is a reference here, because it's kind of reminiscent of or other of Venta's other AI work. So rumble in the jungle. Either way, it looks great. Available for six edition of ten. And so a little bit of photography in AI here. So one of my photographs post processed with AI, and this is also for tesquaicaid, this is spoolio.
00:35:59.528 - 00:36:35.374, Speaker A: And I thought just kind of a really interesting photo because you almost see that AI edge here and even in the sun rays. So just an interesting idea in a sense, not just doing raw AI, you know, AI created purely from text, but taking a photo and then enhancing it with AI. So it seems pretty effective. Here, buy for a Tezos edition of 100. And here, Kika Nicolela also raising funds for Tez quake Aid. She's calling it synthetic photography. So very cool idea.
00:36:35.374 - 00:37:11.630, Speaker A: Slash imagine just like you would on mid journey to make your prompt. So here, seemingly the theme here is an earthquake or devastation and a child looking on in black and white. Love this term, synthetic photography. I guess it says AI art, but not sure if this is raw AI. I'm guessing it is. And here's another one from Kika Nikolayla and a similar subject. So again, these are raising funds for the quake in Turkey and Syria.
00:37:11.630 - 00:37:39.446, Speaker A: Sold for 101 of one. And that sold, you know, within an hour. So pretty good and finally, Danielle King with another awesome AI polaroid. So some. So a Polaroid camera photo made using AI. So another fake, I believe, fake portrait using AI and done with a Polaroid. And you gotta love all this stuff on top here and just the whole quality.
00:37:39.446 - 00:38:07.594, Speaker A: I mean, you totally get the sense of a Polaroid here. And let's just see if this. Yeah, this was listed at 408 and sold basically an hour later for 50 tezos to Christian Bach. So, you know, the market continues to be hot here and here. This is just some couple of works on Instagram that I found, physical works. We've looked at Steven Schwarzer before. I think he's based out of Germany, Palmas Proletariatro.
00:38:07.594 - 00:38:38.356, Speaker A: And I just want to highlight, like, really nice, you know, colored pencils, I think, and kind of getting creative with the colors of this palm tree here. Sort of an eternal subject matter, the palm tree. And look at these interesting kind of colored pixels here. So, again, traveling through the mediums, one would be tempted to say here a little bit. And here's another interesting work. And again, this just screams 1970s comic book to me in the printing. And look at this.
00:38:38.356 - 00:39:07.322, Speaker A: So this is Pedro Correia. Correa ink and screentones over moleskine watercolor album and colors and textures on Photoshop prints in my ink print store. So you can buy that in the store here. So look at how great that looks. And this is a screen print over a moleskine watercolor album. So pretty interesting. And maybe we get even a little bit of the process here.
00:39:07.322 - 00:39:33.442, Speaker A: Look at how great that looks. So, yeah, I mean, pretty elaborate screen printing. I think this is where you use the four, like the CMYK screen printing with where you do the dots. Is it the Benday dots? I can't remember. But anyway, pretty cool and elaborate. And here's some of the other work by Pedro. So, anyways, that really stood out to me.
00:39:33.442 - 00:40:13.014, Speaker A: And that's your show. As rare says, I'm not wasting any time when I end this show. So have a great day, everyone. I hope to see you on Twitter spaces with gogolite us tomorrow. Until next time, take care. And this is Shili Preston. Happy Valentine's Day, Shelly.
