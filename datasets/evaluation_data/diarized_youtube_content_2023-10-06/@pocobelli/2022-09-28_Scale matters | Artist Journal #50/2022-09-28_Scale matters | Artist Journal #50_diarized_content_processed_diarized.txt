00:00:09.800 - 00:00:42.914, Speaker A: Artist Journal September 28, 2022 Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli. I welcome you back. Your artist reporter supporting for duty on a daily basis. I'm amazed that I've gone this far. But when I started this I had a weird commitment to it, almost an unconscious commitment to it. So let's see where it goes.
00:00:42.914 - 00:01:02.132, Speaker A: I was just determined. So it's interesting. Who knows your own unconscious motivations. We could dwell on that all day. Another great work by wasteman Goldman who I am actually almost trying to give a break on the show. He's been on for like what seems like a week straight, maybe more. We will come back to that.
00:01:02.132 - 00:01:57.944, Speaker A: First I want to thank Colborne from the Museum of Crypto Art for putting in a bid on BTC USDT a work from over a year and a half ago. So on super rare so offer accepted. It's wonderful to be in that collection and thank you again. Screenshots, you know, this is a screenshot of binance. I was doing a screenshots crypto series and yeah, I have a whole screenshots have been kind of elemental to my work as the secret history of world war three was and more. So again, thank you Colborne again, kind of a, as I put in a tweet, you know, a legend in this space. I mean just the amount of money, the risk that he took, you know, early, early on betting on this digital art thing.
00:01:57.944 - 00:02:20.464, Speaker A: So really great to happy to accept. Agor NFT wrote a really nice tweet. So did a lot of people yesterday. And let me just give agor some props here. You want to save time and be up to date with what happens on tazos. I've decided to write tweets about what I listened or watched on YouTube. My first tweet is about the video artist journal number 47 by Pokebelly.
00:02:20.464 - 00:02:50.432, Speaker A: So thank you agor. And he has a really cool tweet where he goes through a lot of the works. So how cool is that? And yeah, I mean aegor, I've kind of known through messaging through the last few weeks. So anyways, always appreciate that. And the shout out, another shout out actually to arthropo. And thank you again for all the comments yesterday. They welcomed me into the fold as an advisor of sorts yesterday and they're gonna have a Twitter spaces tonight and you'll learn about their genesis.
00:02:50.432 - 00:03:08.172, Speaker A: Drop dystopia and so. And you can just learn about arthropo. I am still learning about arthropo, but it looked cool. Mikey Wilson, Mikey de la creme was a part of it. He's also an advisor on there. So what the hey? Let's try it out. Let's see what's going on.
00:03:08.172 - 00:03:32.734, Speaker A: Let's make things happen. They sure look like they're making things happen. I went to their instagram just to learn a little more. Community of collectors and digital artists thematic NFT drops from world's renowned digital artists Genesis Strops releasing on September 28, which my friends is today. So check that out. Maybe you want to RSVP on that form. And here is their website.
00:03:32.734 - 00:03:57.348, Speaker A: So just a quick shout out to them. Monthly collection of NFT art pieces from a thematic blueprint. And where's Mikey? And here's some of the artists, the isolationists. You know, you can check it out. Mikey Wilson there another legend in the Tezos scene here. Again, I feel pretty new. I've, you know, I guess I did mint in December, but what a community.
00:03:57.348 - 00:04:08.332, Speaker A: Noah Addis, who I am learning about. They're both in Philadelphia. Great pictures. I wish. I wish I had pictures like this. Anyway, so. Yeah.
00:04:08.332 - 00:04:32.618, Speaker A: So let's get back to the show now, now that the housekeeping is done. So awesome work by wasteman Gold Minevich. Again, this looks like a 1960s cover, or it has a total sixties or seventies feel to it. And it's part of the hotel series that he's been working on. Here, let me just bring that up. Here's hotel number two. He's releasing a ton of work.
00:04:32.618 - 00:05:14.002, Speaker A: This is an AI work, both of these. We looked at hotel number one yesterday, this one here. So you see it's kind of someone in red. Again, we're almost, it's not quite like red rum, but we're almost seeing a mix of kind of and a development, an evolution of, you know, you could say AI again, just borrowing. Because again, this seemed like it was borrowing or influenced by strange thing a little bit, this kind of cloth here. And now we're seeing the red, but he makes it his own. And I see this for 15 tezos.
00:05:14.002 - 00:05:35.986, Speaker A: I wanted to get this for $0.50 when there was like 50 or 30 or however many. And I was kicking myself, I'm probably gonna buy this before this is published because I love this work, this Le Salon. I. It was one of those ones. My wallet was empty, so I was just waiting a day. And then wastemen burnt them all.
00:05:35.986 - 00:06:02.018, Speaker A: You know what? I'll buy it for 15. Screw it. Because I was really like, you know, I don't have many AI works, but this one I loved. So anyways, there's an auction for hotel number three at two tezos. Right. Now, what else do we have here? This goes through this kind of more housekeeping a little bit. Purple drank has another savage sword of pepe.
00:06:02.018 - 00:06:26.178, Speaker A: So if you have claimed any of the previous ones, you can claim on manifold another one for almost nothing. This is $5. I did the calculation. So for each one you own, I think you can claim one, but there are only 100, so you have to be quick. 24 hours window. And I think I brought up the app manifold. So, yeah, really cool.
00:06:26.178 - 00:07:00.036, Speaker A: I want to use Manifold XYZ at some point. It's sort of like if you want to put out editions of work on Ethereum, Manifold XYz seems like where people are going, it looks like a great spot to go. This looks like another awesome work by purple drank. And speaking of Pepe, there's this auction that I missed, and it's by Ugor 1996 de la creme. I think that's Ratcluxe's brother, and he is doing a play. Ratcloak is boring. Pepe is always fun.
00:07:00.036 - 00:07:13.476, Speaker A: So it sounds like all in the family here, so. And then I track the auction. It went for six. So congrats to you, gore Ujor. I hope I'm pronouncing that right. As. As three.
00:07:13.476 - 00:07:33.974, Speaker A: Is three a, five a, one a knows, or Bezaya, that sometimes I have problems with names. Speaking of Bezaya, we were talking about Bezaya yesterday, and maybe he had a discord. He doesn't. He only has, like, what he messaged me. He's like, by the way, I don't have a discord where I announce the things. That's only Adelia. So I got that wrong.
00:07:33.974 - 00:08:00.598, Speaker A: But kind of fun to think about. He's got, like, a personal one that, you know, like most of us, that we haven't really developed too much. So, yeah, so if you want to know about Buzzaya's work, maybe put on your notifications on Twitter and give him a follow. Start with that, maybe message him and see what else you can do. But yeah, no discord there. Another awesome work by Gabriel Tezarev. Look at this.
00:08:00.598 - 00:08:33.782, Speaker A: They're retro record player with some awesome buttons made of cake. Remember the t bode reference, right? And yeah, I just think this is awesome. I actually really love how the newspaper is done. And see this little detail here? The previous work is in the paper. That previous work of the cassette. For those that didn't see it, I love this double series here. So I picked one of these up.
00:08:33.782 - 00:08:57.594, Speaker A: So remember this work, which was another classic, kind of great. You know, it reminds me of that fur cup, the surrealist fur cup. Maybe I can quickly bring that up. Who did that? Like, I want to say, like Oppenheimer. There's a very famous piece, this one. Yeah, Miret Oppenheim. Just classic surrealism.
00:08:57.594 - 00:09:22.802, Speaker A: That's. See this fur cup? This is a classic. You'll find it in the textbooks. That's kind of what these works remind me of, as well as Wayne Thibaud, who we also went into, who is famous for doing, like, confiture or kind of like cakes and delicacies from. From the bakery. So again, I just love this work. Edition of ten for Atezos 80.
00:09:22.802 - 00:09:52.394, Speaker A: And so you see the cassettes are in here. Beautiful details. Again, love the kind of tablecloth or whatever this is. There's a lot going right in this work. And again, you can just imagine this in the museum, in your mind, these two works just hanging side by side. And then you compare it to your local museum or art gallery, and you say, hey, this measures up, at least in my mind, new work by rustic digital art, which was interesting. You can't mint everything.
00:09:52.394 - 00:10:17.250, Speaker A: So this just kind of triggered something in my mind. And again, I'm not even sure. This looks like a green sea with clouds in the sky. And I just thought of Magritte here. And here is a Magritte that's going to south bees called galate. So I guess that's Galatia. And it was just kind of like, kind of just screamed Magritte a little bit.
00:10:17.250 - 00:10:42.714, Speaker A: Could be totally accidental, by the way. And if not, if it's an influence, that's cool, too. Remember the quoting, okay? Quoting is good, you know? You know, quoting is credibility. And maybe this is accidental. Who knows? But just kind of interesting. Interesting title there, too. Let's not forget with Magrit again, Galatia is a mythological figure.
00:10:42.714 - 00:11:10.838, Speaker A: We'll go into Galatia. I have a work called Galatia on super rare. We can go into that at another point. I'm sure we will cross this path again. I was reading this up on Sotheby's site here. It's actually funny that it was made in 1964, but it's dated 1952 because of the dealer. Magritte wanted to basically avoid, like, having to sell it through a certain dealer.
00:11:10.838 - 00:11:32.600, Speaker A: So he put 1952. And knowing Magritte, I mean, a surrealist, he probably really enjoyed doing that. He probably thought it was hilarious, I'm guessing, or had a little chuckle to himself. But again, with Magritte, the title is a part of the work. A very literary painter. And remember, the surrealists are a very literary group. Okay.
00:11:32.600 - 00:11:51.560, Speaker A: Lautre Ament. Rimbaud, especially Lautre Ament, the black Bible quote, unquote, of surrealism. So Andre Breton. Andre Breton, you know, like, I mean, read the manifesto. There's several manifestos. You can read the first manifesto, and it's kind of enough, if you ask me. Back to the fidgital.
00:11:51.560 - 00:12:08.248, Speaker A: Back to the phygital tip. A new work by Gabby Walter. Now, this is interesting. This is a physical work. Most of the work I've collected by Gabby is digital. I believe I'm almost 99.9% positive.
00:12:08.248 - 00:12:38.360, Speaker A: But here is a digital work, and I just wanted to show you what's going on here. So it's 300 tezos, one of one oil painting inspired by the Mona Lisa and oil on canvas. The owner of this token will get the original painting. So this is interesting. So more experimentation with this relationship between the physical art piece and the digital. And so an interesting, you know, kind of trademark. Gabby Walter, Mickey Mouse.
00:12:38.360 - 00:12:57.720, Speaker A: Broken Mickey Mouse ears on the Mona Lisa. Looks like a pretty nice rendering. How big is it? Half a meter by 60 cm. So not a small painting. 300 tesos. So only for those interested in the physical artwork, I listed the secret inner eyes. The owner of the token will get the original painting link below.
00:12:57.720 - 00:13:21.726, Speaker A: So that is available. And kind of a similar kind of digital painter with this kind of oil look to it. Oil painting look to it is Lavon, who put out a one of one incognito three. Let's just see. Auction bid for 25. So this is also up for auction. And Lavon's work goes for quite a bit of money.
00:13:21.726 - 00:13:37.018, Speaker A: Another 15 hours left here. Did I bring up? Yeah. So you see, I think. Yeah. Vincent van Doe. Portrait of Vincent van Doe, who is a collector, I believe, of Lavon. And so interesting buy for 99.
00:13:37.018 - 00:13:58.730, Speaker A: So it's not cheap. Like, I mean, this is one. I saw it when it came out and I didn't realize that there's such a strong market, so I didn't pick it up. But I guess I should have really kind of interesting still lives. And finally, let me just show you Shilly Preston. You know, these still lifes, people love these still lives. And I think they're pretty interesting, too.
00:13:58.730 - 00:14:28.232, Speaker A: And it kind of has some kind of, like, ogs from the Tezos here. Portrait of Shilly Preston, which looks like it's maybe taken from his Twitter profile. Fidenza village, who I think he satirizes a lot and kind of uses appropriates, a lot of the Fidenzas, Shilly Preston. So reference to that. Really just cool still life here. So, you know, as far as some pretty nice offers. 45 tezos not accepted.
00:14:28.232 - 00:14:49.128, Speaker A: The last one to be accepted, Mikey Wilson, who's just all over this blockchain for 70. So interesting. Again, you see NFT biker. So Lavon has been chronicling the Tezos scene, and NFT biker is an OG. He has started. Yeah, he's got some sort of app. I've never used it.
00:14:49.128 - 00:15:10.732, Speaker A: Most people have used it. So if you go to his Twitter, I'm sure you can track that down. A new work by Sumireusi. And this is interesting. This is on her main profile. Most of the work we've been tracking of hers is on her AI profile, Sumire AI. And so here is another work.
00:15:10.732 - 00:15:35.578, Speaker A: It's kind of a shift in style. And what's also interesting about this is she wrote about it and she uses. She mentioned that she used Dal E. And it sounds like these are three other works that she had done. And that's kind of one of her trademarks, is putting some of her other works as paintings in paintings. And she's got a poem there. Let's see what she wrote.
00:15:35.578 - 00:16:09.674, Speaker A: I brought up her twitter, the wind will take us from this room. And she has a poem. And she says, while creating my work, the tool I primarily used was Del E. And then I placed three different works I made separately into the work with a collage technique. I fully captured the atmosphere I wanted to create with the symbols I drew on the table, the gloomy nothingness, the questioning, skeptical attitude in C. David Friedrich's paintings, the individual expression of darkness and social pain. And Kathy Kalvitz cis lithographs inspired my approach.
00:16:09.674 - 00:16:38.306, Speaker A: I tried to capture these emotions in my own style and convey them to you with new experiments, with new experimental expression of my art. Okay, point being, there is some daly being used in the work. And these are also kind of, again, works in works. I assume you guys know Caspar David Friedrich. He's kind of a big painter in Germany, romantic painter. He has. You'd know him from this.
00:16:38.306 - 00:17:09.864, Speaker A: This is like the classic here. His paintings are enormous. Like enormous. So they are worth checking out. Like, the scale is unbelievable on some of these works, and which makes them just epic by scale alone. Scale is a very interesting kind of property or quality of art. It's something you really have to think about because it really has an impact scale.
00:17:09.864 - 00:18:06.062, Speaker A: Okay, here we go. Interestingly, in digital, it's kind of a different story scale, we could argue in the digital world. I mean, it's all on screens, right? I mean, you could put on huge screens, but it's not the same kind of thing, at least when you're conceptualizing it, because you could put a 700 pixel by 700 pixel on a massive screen. Okay, so Dan Control gave a little preview of a new sort of work he's working on. And you remember him from the Nakia phone, the Game Boy controller, the eraser. So interesting. It looks like he is developing almost what I want to call a like two thousands early two thousands style of Internet art, you know, with a lot of that kind of windows 95 vibe.
00:18:06.062 - 00:18:28.862, Speaker A: So interesting. Tradscape is having a good couple of days here, and he was mentioning he's in the hurricane. So hopefully nothing bad is happening there. Hopefully he is safe and okay. And yeah, let's go to his activity. That's what I wanted to go to. I just wanted to show his market is heating up and he's making very nice sales.
00:18:28.862 - 00:19:04.828, Speaker A: Addition of five going for 44 on secondary. This awesome one, a short rest going for 7120 for this edition of five. And this kind of elf figure or whatever that is going for 20. So in the last though, day 100, 2070 and 44. So people are feeling the tradscape. See if we can get. They are pretty classic works.
00:19:04.828 - 00:19:45.408, Speaker A: I mean, Robnis V two dropped a tweet where he sort of gave props to tradscape in that french canadian work that was at the Jano le paying gallery, which is an incredible work. So anyways, more crossover onto ethereum. Right. Let's see, we have another one here. It's got like a medieval vibe. I think he often. I think he often makes the music himself, which is another kind of really cool aspect.
00:19:45.408 - 00:20:08.168, Speaker A: Again, the music to this video podcast is created by Tradscape. It was an NFT I bought. Moving on from him. Kurt Hussle collective is doing some portraits on eight badoo. So you can maybe guess who this is. Heidi Rockette. So he's doing the crew as he said he did the myth, which is nice.
00:20:08.168 - 00:20:26.074, Speaker A: So I'm loving watching this eight badoo thing come back. I'm gonna actually mint a work on eight bidoo. I have a few more I need to list, but I'm gonna mint a beach, actually. So one bit necro, whose work we haven't looked at yet. And I want to look. I'm glad this came up. We're going to look at one bit necro when we have more time.
00:20:26.074 - 00:20:52.534, Speaker A: This myth, I thought is awesome. It's called the hug. And it's really abstract. And I really like that. Like, I can't really tell what's going on here other than the myth colors and maybe some sky. I find this to be a very beautiful work. So it's interesting, this kind of potential for abstraction on eight badoo.
00:20:52.534 - 00:21:19.360, Speaker A: This sold for 50. He listed it for 50, so he knew it was a good one too, because he's been listening. He's listing these for 30. Anonymous collector who loves eight badoo. Okay, how many? 514 times 24 works. Like, is that like 10,000 works of art? Serious anonymous collector here. Also, Joe Rogan's dad put out one.
00:21:19.360 - 00:21:37.440, Speaker A: I assume this is a portrait of himself. It looks like it. He's got the balaclava. This will be my only ape bedument, so we might as well look while we can. And a cool portrait. And he also put out an interesting tweet, offers only from here on out. It's a better system.
00:21:37.440 - 00:22:02.980, Speaker A: So I think Joe Rogan's dad is kind of fed up with the flippers. Yeah, here we go. It allows me to stay in more control over my own market. And the flippers can f rocks. Okay, so interesting. It's always interesting to find out the market just work by lb here, available for forte. So it's always interesting to see what he is up to.
00:22:02.980 - 00:22:32.780, Speaker A: Into the screen void and a few AI works. We're back to Shilly Preston here. So this kind of reminded me of Eddy tree, who we were looking at, and also varya, who we were looking at in the quality of the plants and everything. Interesting green sky here, by the way. So I just wanted to kind of, as we just. I want us to take in a lot of AI art so that we can just assess it as. As good as possible.
00:22:32.780 - 00:22:51.100, Speaker A: As well as possible. So again, this looks like a stonehenge. So nature meets kind of rock monolith garden. Okay. AI and more eddy trees. I thought the colors on these were quite beautiful. You see, there is almost similarity, though.
00:22:51.100 - 00:23:28.634, Speaker A: And this goes to Diego's point of, well, a lot of AI art start to kind of look the same, quote unquote. And that's not to say anything negative. That's just like, is that something that's going to happen over time, that we're going to start to see certain qualities emerge where we can go? Oh, yeah, that's likely AI art, but beautiful works. I mean, the color is excellent as well on this phantasma number. Zero, zero, nine. So again, back to the science fiction pulp kind of vibe with a bit of an escher feel to this one, meets the plants. So Eddie tree continuing to turn my head.
00:23:28.634 - 00:23:57.984, Speaker A: And this is also someone in AI that I had forgotten about. I had actually collected some of. Is it stamais or by tria stamaze? Stamaze is an AI with a passion for shapes and color. So I also thought this was interesting. This takes an artist, in this case, Matisse, and puts it into AI or doing whatever they're doing. And you see if it loads up, it's too slow. Here we go.
00:23:57.984 - 00:24:31.984, Speaker A: You see? Let's not do that. So just interesting variations of Matisse that are somewhat persuasive. And it's really interesting because I actually bought some of these, like, a year ago, before I was even on Tazos. I thought they were just kind of really pretty. They're not too expensive right now. You get them for cheaper than I did. There's another one of Kandinsky, and I was looking at Kandinsky's at the Neue National Gallery in Berlin, which is a recently opened national gallery, and they had Kandinsky's there.
00:24:31.984 - 00:25:03.124, Speaker A: And I was like, I think I like the Kandinsky's that I bought as much as the ones that are in the gallery, that museum. And what was even more interesting is I almost found the ones that I had. I bought a couple of these. I almost found them weirdly more interesting because they had AI. So it was kind of plain and it kind of provoked a lot more questions because we've all seen, most of us Kandinsky's a million times. And nothing against Kandinsky. Nothing against Kandinsky.
00:25:03.124 - 00:25:18.874, Speaker A: So. And here's Hilma f. Klimt. And again, I actually had the same feeling when I was in the Neue national Galerie here in Berlin. It was the same sort of sentiment. We'll see if this loads up. You get the picture.
00:25:18.874 - 00:25:42.834, Speaker A: So, yeah, some really nice works here. And with that, let's just leave it here. So just some early AI experiments from, you know, September to December 2021. With that, maybe I'll see you tonight on the Twitter spaces. I will be attending. Thank you for watching. Until next time, take care.
