00:00:06.000 - 00:00:36.400, Speaker A: I thought the nineties were back. I guess the eighties are even back in Beziah's mind. If this is who I think it is, who is Andre Agassiz with his beautiful pink and pastel blue tennis racket? Glorious. And it's a glorious morning here. A sunny morning here in Berlin, which is very welcome. Artist journal, February 7, 2023. My name is Adrian Pokebelli.
00:00:36.400 - 00:01:05.106, Speaker A: Welcome back, everyone, to our one of a kind show here. And thank you again for all the wonderful tweets and retweets and everything, the likes, the shares, the nice comments on YouTube, all of it. I hope I am a good companion for your morning coffee. That is really kind of what we're up to here. I guzzled down a couple of cups of coffee, and I press record. So welcome back. Cool work.
00:01:05.106 - 00:01:23.098, Speaker A: Cool. I mean, that is the word that describes Bezaya's work, isn't it? And here is a very cool work by Boziah. And it's kind of interesting. I'm not sure if I saw it in the tweet or in the description. I guess we can look here. Here it is. It is in the description.
00:01:23.098 - 00:02:22.126, Speaker A: This was made during a day that I tried to paint with some Grant Yoon vibes. And, of course, Grant Yung does those very minimalistic works that sell for, like, $100,000 on ETH. I think we've looked once at Grant Yun's work. We should come back, and he does these. I guess it's the atmosphere and the feeling, and maybe there's a uniqueness to it, too. But I guess where I was going with this, though, is isn't it interesting sometimes when you can use someone else's work as inspiration? But if Bezaya hadn't said that, I never would have guessed that, oh, this is a Grant Jun kind of inspired work. And that can happen, right? Like, I mean, there was a point, I mean, where I was putting Sai tambly paintings onto a projector, and I would just make it really big.
00:02:22.126 - 00:03:10.872, Speaker A: And then I just use that as just kind of rough areas to, okay, put some color here, you know, just as a way of kind of getting through that, you know, the white canvas issue, the blank page, although it was a blank canvas, and, okay. And I like to put random colors sometimes and at the bottom of paintings just to get things started. You can always paint over it. And so, anyways, that's kind of what I think of when I see this. It's sort of using someone as inspiration, but it's almost, I think, in greek philosophy, you would describe this as climbing up the ladder and then throwing it away. You know, like, that's kind of what this is. It's kind of like using grant yun as inspiration.
00:03:10.872 - 00:03:46.156, Speaker A: And then you can throw away the ladder, and you kind of have your own work here if you're not too close. And I don't find this overly derivative. I mean, the only clue for me, I suppose it would be the tennis court and kind of this geometric lines. And perhaps mostly, though, it would be the color that kind of has a bit of a grant union feel, from what I have seen on Twitter. I mean, I'm totally not an expert, but. So it's interesting, isn't it? It's kind of climbing the ladder and throwing it away. And you gotta love the eighties vibe.
00:03:46.156 - 00:04:09.884, Speaker A: This neon, this pastels. These pastels. Again, very cool work from Bezaya. So this went to Blue seven's collection for an unknown amount. This is his, and this is his other. He's got two profiles here, and this is another awesome one that I missed. These shoes here.
00:04:09.884 - 00:04:35.148, Speaker A: No gold, no party. And so anyways, these showed up, actually on Instagram, and look at this. Like, did I? You know, so I miss a ton of stuff, by the way, if you're wondering sometimes. Oh, you know, Adrian used to show all my work, and now he. I can't follow everything, in a sense. So I'm just kind of. There's a waterfall, and I'm just kind of collecting water as it falls.
00:04:35.148 - 00:05:02.804, Speaker A: Okay, just so everybody knows about that. Anyways, here's some other bezaya work. And you gotta love kind of keeping with the surrealism a little bit. This is on Instagram, and I like the daisies coming out of the socks here. And always kind of playing with these brands and kind of looks like an old soccer ball or something. Maybe this is a volleyball, I don't know. And then some other works here.
00:05:02.804 - 00:05:17.226, Speaker A: There. And there are the shoes. And. Yeah, so anyways, just really cool work from Bezaya. I didn't even see this. So all sorts of stuff I'm missing is it. This is on super rare.
00:05:17.226 - 00:05:37.602, Speaker A: Maybe this is why I don't see as much Bizai anymore, because he's minting on super rare, and so I got to see it on Twitter to see that. So anyways, look how great that looks. This was three days ago. How did I miss this? You could start the program with this. Yeah. So anyways, Sergeant Pepe's crew. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.
00:05:37.602 - 00:06:05.310, Speaker A: So anyways, cool work from Bezaya. Three a, five a, one a if you're doing a search on object. Heads up, everyone. We are doing a birthday bash. It's my birthday tomorrow. I am turning 44, my last day of 43 here. And so for Twitter spaces tomorrow, I thought we could just do an open lines type show where basically you can talk about your art projects.
00:06:05.310 - 00:06:27.934, Speaker A: You can talk about really anything. You don't need to be an artist. You can also be a collector or just an observer or someone that's maybe had a question or anything. Open lines tomorrow for Twitter spaces. Wednesday, 09:30 a.m. Eastern standard time, as we do every week. And Runetune, I need to actually put runetoon in this tweet here.
00:06:27.934 - 00:07:07.512, Speaker A: Runetune is also going to be co hosting. And worst case scenario, it's going to be me and Rune tune talking about our art. But I think a lot of people, it's a great opportunity for you as an artist to really just get people thinking about your work because once they start thinking about your work, then perhaps, dear artists, they will buy your work. So it's an awesome opportunity. And you know what? If you haven't even minted it, you can still talk about I have this in the pipeline and whatever. And maybe it's about collector from a collector who's talking about what's really just exciting them right now and that they don't see enough of or whatever. So we want all perspectives here.
00:07:07.512 - 00:07:32.512, Speaker A: All topics welcome. So you can see that I've pinned that up on my twitter, continuing on. So last yesterday's show. So a couple of comments here. First of all, yeah, so I was making up an artist's name in my there is no Max Becker. There is a Max Beckmann, who is a german expressionist. And even that was the wrong artist.
00:07:32.512 - 00:07:47.956, Speaker A: So thank you to ihazmaths. I has math. Thanks, Adrian. I'm learning so much in every video. I'm glad to hear that. I try and make it worth everybody's while. By the way, were you thinking of german expressionist George Grose? I think that's how you pronounce it.
00:07:47.956 - 00:08:19.152, Speaker A: Gross. And I looked up George Grose. German expressionism is not my forte. I did have a book, so I did kind of stare at these paintings. And I think it was George Grose because this is because because we were talking about hasdrubal waffles portraits and how they kind of had a feeling to them that were almost like german expressionists. And you can kind of see it here, right? It kind of has that feeling. So, yeah, so that is, I believe, who I was talking about who I was thinking about.
00:08:19.152 - 00:08:36.984, Speaker A: So thank you. I has math, so. Yeah, so anyway. And here is actually. And I brought up Beckman as well, so definitely not Max Beckmann. Maybe a touch. You know, you see it in here, in these faces again, it's german expressionism, so.
00:08:36.984 - 00:09:03.506, Speaker A: Which some people might think is an oxymoron, actually. But I love my german friends and everything, and we're all good here. And I love this country where I am based out of here. So, anyways, we're all having fun over here. And this is also what I wanted to get at here, the opening work, this comment by Roontun yesterday, that opening work by go young is stunning. Wow. Yeah.
00:09:03.506 - 00:09:33.994, Speaker A: A lot of people were. Yeah. At least I was blown away by that work. I agree. That being said, it's really quite a contrast seeing you open with such an incredible work of art that is so gorgeous and so contemporaneous to be followed up by a 70 something year old art critics. Wildly presumptuous generalization about blockchain technology and the art artists connected with it. And of course, we're talking about Jerry Saltz and his comments, basically saying how blockchain will be gone in twelve years.
00:09:33.994 - 00:10:01.570, Speaker A: I'm glad you covered that comment in the journal here. Saltz is someone who has provided some really great criticism as well as some enormously disappointing thoughts and opinions. Yeah. Like, put it this way. I once saw him interviewed for the book how to be an artist, which now I find pretty ironic. You know, again, it's like me writing how to be a plumber. But that being said, I actually thought, oh, when I watched that interview, he was actually a pretty nice guy.
00:10:01.570 - 00:10:28.794, Speaker A: Right. So nobody's out to. There's nothing, in a sense, personal in this whole situation. And so I'm kind of glad that rune toon is pointing out that, you know, it's not all bad over here. He blocked me, but then he blocked me on instagram once because of a comment I made as pushback to one of his disappointing opinions. How weak is that? At the time, he had hundreds of thousands of followers. Hundreds of thousands of followers.
00:10:28.794 - 00:10:48.014, Speaker A: And I had a mere few hundred. Yeah. You know, so this got me thinking because I was actually looking yesterday. Okay, so Jerry Saltz. And just. And again, I'm not here to attack anyone or anything. That is, you know, not the purpose of this program.
00:10:48.014 - 00:11:16.906, Speaker A: I am interested in reality, though, and I am interested in the art world and the art business and the business of that. We're all in here that is kind of crucial to our situation here. But I was looking at this yesterday. Actually, I didn't mention it, but since you're mentioning the hundreds of thousands of followers. Yeah. So he's got 551,000. And you look at the engage, like some of, like, I mean, the engagement is pretty.
00:11:16.906 - 00:11:50.780, Speaker A: Is lower than most of the people that I know on Twitter. You know, us unfamous people on Twitter here, you know, four retweets, 3168 views. You know, I guess he got 51. You know, artists are people who make things that talk in other people's sleep. So again, I think he's having fun here. But I guess this is what I want to point out. It's pretty low engagement for half a million followers, isn't it? You know, so now why am I pointing this out? And look at the views.
00:11:50.780 - 00:12:25.024, Speaker A: I mean, them making the views transparent on Twitter is maybe the most revealing thing of all, because all of a sudden all this, like, I have, you know, 500,000 followers. Well, you're not getting very much reach. And for. And how many of those 500 thousands followers are excited about what you're saying here? And, okay, I guess you could say, well, that's because nobody's seen it. But then why is nobody. Why are, you know, I brought up the tez vending machine here. The Tez vending machine got 4333.
00:12:25.024 - 00:12:56.370, Speaker A: And I'm not just cherry picking here. Look at Claire Silver, 90,000. And then Jerry salts can't even get, you know, okay, here I am with, this is a retweet. That's 357 and here. I mean, I'm getting a thank you, or this is up for auction is 3000. And so what's going on here? Right? And so this is my point. It's not to attack.
00:12:56.370 - 00:13:42.898, Speaker A: It's not to, you know, it is to compare, but not the reason why I'm showing this. It's because it's a bit of a hall of mirrors over here. This is my point, okay? Like, what I'm saying is if we're interested in what's actually the reality here, something's, you know, maybe these people aren't as popular as we're being led to believe. That is my point here, okay? Because I don't see, you know, we're basically being told that this is the high priest of our criticism, and I don't see anybody caring what this person has to say. Okay? Like, to be kind of blunt about it. And again, I'm not trying to be overly personal here. That's not the point.
00:13:42.898 - 00:14:05.796, Speaker A: The point is don't believe everything here. You got 15,000. Okay, so they're coming. Higher ones are getting, you know, but again, so I brought up some other ones here. So David Zwerner, right? Like, okay, 83,000. Just so, and again, I'm, no one's here to. It's all in good spirit.
00:14:05.796 - 00:14:47.430, Speaker A: It's all in the interest of what's going on. Okay? And I just find this interesting. You're seeing 691 people are seeing their tweets here from February 3. One retweet and four likes. And so what my point here is, is don't believe everything you're told and don't, you know, like, this huge edifice art world that you are so insignificant and these people are so significant and so important. The numbers are not confirming that. Okay? So we tend to understate our own importance and overstate, you know, what we're being told is important.
00:14:47.430 - 00:15:27.176, Speaker A: But if you look here, 970 212 99, I mean, you know, ilay will get more, you know, like, much more, you know, than, than David Zwerner. Okay, so just so that's all I have to say. I'm not saying this is good or bad. I'm not putting any value judgment on it. I'm just saying, like, in case you didn't know, you know, so, and again, I think, like, just in the interests of reality, I brought up gagosian, too. And this is a little bit stronger if we go to a gagosian tweet. But, I mean, 2049 is the reach.
00:15:27.176 - 00:15:53.752, Speaker A: Six retweets, 15 likes. Here, you got 6000 of reach, 6000. So a little better here, 4300. But these aren't, like, stratospheric numbers. And when you look at the followers, 1884, people saw this. A lot of you people who are watching have as much reach as gagosian, is my point. And there's another point, too.
00:15:53.752 - 00:16:29.660, Speaker A: As a community, it's worth our while to really support each other when it comes to this, because as a community, it gets really powerful. Okay, so again, 389,000 followers here. But people sometimes with 2000 followers, have more reach than Gagosian. Here's Marian Goodman, another elite gallery, you know, 501 retweet, two likes. And to be fair, this is Twitter. This is not necessarily contemporary art gallery's forte or contemporary art scenes. Forte Twitter.
00:16:29.660 - 00:16:59.590, Speaker A: But we also have to understand these are again considered the most elite galleries in the world. Gagosian, David Zwerner, Marion Goodman. And right now, Marion Goodman is getting 300 reach, seven likes, and zero retweets on their new show. Okay, so 262, one, like. So I'm just. I'm just showing you this so that you're aware. Hauser and Wirth, similar story.
00:16:59.590 - 00:17:50.826, Speaker A: 706, three likes. Because, again, Twitter is the pr. This is where the world, it's the new public relations. I mean, not so new where, like, if you're a company or almost anything, you want to put out a public statement, you put it out on Twitter, unless you're a celebrity, where maybe you use Instagram or maybe even TikTok, I don't know. But if you're putting out public information to the world, you go to Twitter. And I'm just saying, you're not seeing incredible things here from these people that we are told are, you know, are the people who are the most important people and doing the most significant things in the world. So it's kind of back to this idea of popular taste and how the contemporary art world has left the people behind.
00:17:50.826 - 00:18:23.114, Speaker A: I don't see a lot of enthusiasm here, and I don't want to spend too much on this, but I think it's important and interesting as people from that world are criticizing what we're doing. Well, maybe we should take a look, you know? And again, finally, pero Tain, you know, 540 reach. You know, two retweets. Twelve likes, 691. This is for Murakami. So, you know, 920. 717 likes, zero retweets.
00:18:23.114 - 00:18:46.954, Speaker A: So, again, you know, it's just. I think it's just very illustrative onto other things. So Ilay has minted her work, and it's an interesting work here. So Monai Lisa. So this is by the ilay, not the fake account. And this was sent to claire Silver here. And so this is the.
00:18:46.954 - 00:19:02.554, Speaker A: For the AI art contest. So it's an interesting piece. I was surprised to see this. I thought it would be this work in here, but that is only part of the piece. It is, in fact, a screenshot, and there is a quote. AI art is theft. AI art has no soul.
00:19:02.554 - 00:19:16.694, Speaker A: Artists fingerprint. AI art requires no skill. AI art replaces artists. AI art all looks the same by banksy. So. And then we have Dali, human AI. So interesting kind of concept piece with some beautiful AI in it.
00:19:16.694 - 00:19:38.854, Speaker A: And so, yeah, so the theme is rebuttal. Make a piece that responds to an argument against AI art. So, and then this great writing here. So very interesting. Very interesting. Kind of mysterious over here. So anyway, the work is minted.
00:19:38.854 - 00:20:20.134, Speaker A: So progress, the world is being restored in a good way here, slowly but surely. And again, if anybody has any ideas as to maybe fundraise or something for Ilay. Write her a message and or bring it up in the spaces tomorrow. I just thought this was interesting. I don't know who Andy is, but he seems to be a prominent person. Today I'm very excited to announce our new platform, Escher XYZ, a curated marketplace for fine art editions. We will be slowly rolling out new information over the coming weeks, but here's a quick thread on what we are doing and why editions are the next step for us.
00:20:20.134 - 00:21:13.514, Speaker A: So anyways, I haven't gone to this, so be careful. Again, as we just saw with Ilite, there are a ton of scammers out there, and this is probably fine, but wherever you're connecting your wallet, be very, very careful. But anyways, just to show you that kind of looked interesting to me, what they are up to. Jeremy Austin with the Twitter handle Austin. I think he comments on the show, actually, and he, he tweeted this out using a fire extinguisher filled with paint as a mark making tool in a controlled environment with the time and space to create an outcome that is somewhat known but mostly unknown and experimental. Timed Austin studio edition dropping on manifold in the next few days. So here's this great looking fire extinguisher.
00:21:13.514 - 00:21:49.280, Speaker A: And here is the fire extinguisher. So it's a great mark making tool. I mean, it really has saitombly vibes, doesn't it? Like in a good way and its own thing here. But I guess, you know, it's kind of a clue almost as to how saitombly was working, which is probably with a lot of water or liquid, whatever your medium is. And so anyways, heads up that Austin is putting out a edition. And yeah, again, the fire extinguisher. And that actually reminded me of zombie formalism because.
00:21:49.280 - 00:22:23.244, Speaker A: And which is kind of like, you know, one of the, you know, not to be overly judgmental here, but one of my least favorite names, let's call it, of, of any art movement. It seemed completely fabricated by the art media and by the establishment, I think it was around 2006 or seven, I'm guessing. And there was an artist who used a fire extinguisher as well. So here is the work. I put zombie formalism, fire extinguisher. And so there is the work. And there is the toxic legacy of zombie formalism, part one.
00:22:23.244 - 00:22:49.866, Speaker A: So I guess it's not aging well, how an unhinged economy spawned a new world of debt aesthetics. So anyway, here it is, this sold at Sotheby's for 66 to 99 or sorry, for $372,000. It's by Lucian Smith. That was his name. So there you go. And I believe this is the work that was made with a fire extinguisher. Continuing on campus, sage.
00:22:49.866 - 00:23:30.524, Speaker A: So over to digital painting. So he's got a new one. And this again escaped me on the notifications and. Interesting kind of situation here, isn't it? Seems to be a classical reference in the top right and maybe the top left, almost looking like Michelangelo, actually a little bit on the Sistine Chapel ceiling a little bit. And then here is, I guess, capisage in the painting, but then also outside the painting, given the finger. And then this interesting x ray showing the bones. Very interesting.
00:23:30.524 - 00:23:52.724, Speaker A: And some plaster models here and some other real life models perhaps lying down, kind of passed out. So a mysterious work. Let's see if we have a title. The painting of your eyes. So pretty interesting. Mysterious work here from Kappa Sage. So nice, one edition of eight.
00:23:52.724 - 00:24:20.324, Speaker A: And there are three left at ten tezos. Now, Moda Mt minted this and burnt it because there were no takers and I assume that's why he burnt it. But I kind of like. I like Moda Mt's kind of, what is the word? Just kind of like, I guess brutal honesty. Like there's something. Remember, he's the guy that did the border painting. He also did the ship.
00:24:20.324 - 00:24:54.674, Speaker A: There's something, he kind of hits on a certain emotional level. And I like this as well. Fertile field. And it's just the artist, it looks like looking at his paintings as a fertile field to plow. So, you know, there's something very. Again, it's just that raw honesty that to me, it's like, who can't relate to this and kind of has the hope of an artist is portrayed here and there's just something about his work. So anyways, I thought that was a cool work.
00:24:54.674 - 00:25:12.624, Speaker A: I hope he doesn't mind me showing the burnt work there. So anyways, continuing on, dan control rat race. So continuing with the gradients and the repetitions. And so here they all are in their glorious beauty here. Success calls. Run. Run.
00:25:12.624 - 00:25:39.214, Speaker A: And indeed we all are. Edition of 1000. Bye for one. And there are 932 left. This is one I just saw on Twitter, remember, neurocolor, that wild artist. Unfortunately, I can't make this big, but anyway, I thought just another kind of wild work, remember? I think this went for, or one of these went for like 100,000. That really amazing one we looked at the other day to 6529, I believe.
00:25:39.214 - 00:26:13.798, Speaker A: So anyways, this could be an old work, I'm not sure, but I'd never seen it before. Nice work from plants, who is also known as kappin, as far as I can tell. A cachade. I thought this was particularly striking. Plants, plant work by plants. And I quite like the frame, and I quite like just everything about it, the composition, even these beautiful little lines. This one really kind of hit, as you like to say, buy for three, edition of 15.
00:26:13.798 - 00:26:42.218, Speaker A: Nice, low edition. Everything low royalty. You gotta love that, too, as a collector, you know, 15%. I've started to default to 15%. I noticed Oxyn did it, and I noticed, to me, there were a couple of other artists that I thought, you know, kind of had a lot figured out that did 15%, and I sort of would toy with different royalty numbers. And I like 15%. Like, it's.
00:26:42.218 - 00:26:57.092, Speaker A: It's enough. It's a healthy amount, you know, from. You get something from a secondary sale, but it doesn't. But the collector isn't overly. It's not like 25% maybe feels. I mean, it depends on the situation. If you.
00:26:57.092 - 00:27:25.062, Speaker A: If you sell a work for one tezos, you know, if you want to put a 25% royalty on it, fine. And I don't judge it either way, but I'm just speaking from a personal point of view. I've kind of. I like 15%. I feel like it's enough, but it's. But it, you know, it put it this way, even just from a purely practical, pragmatic view, it's not going to deter collectors from buying your art. They're not going to see, oh, the royalty is too high.
00:27:25.062 - 00:27:49.162, Speaker A: I'm not going to. You know, maybe I won't make money. You're not going to deter the speculators at 15%? Let's put it that way. And I'm happy with whoever buys my art speculator, art lover, whatever. I mean, maybe I'll live to regret those words, but right now, I'm just thrilled to sell art, and people like it, and everybody's happy, right? So look who's back. Go, go, Litus. How are we doing? Okay.
00:27:49.162 - 00:28:22.276, Speaker A: I am waxing too philosophically here today. So gogolitis. We were sending out the red flag about a week ago that he was tweeting. He's got a new one, and what is this called reality simulator device. And using what I call these pixel art factories here. And so going with this trademark purple, what was interesting, and here you see the brain and everything in the Tezos chip. So, returning to form, we might say, and you see all these different elements here they are here.
00:28:22.276 - 00:28:47.014, Speaker A: He sold them as separate. And I don't know actually why he didn't use these colors in the new one. I mean, this looks great, but that's what I kept asking myself. What would this look like with these fantastic colors here as well? Maybe you can put out a different mix. Who knows? Simmod number one. So this here, you'll see it looks like a mixer or something that you'll see is in the bottom left corner here. Okay.
00:28:47.014 - 00:28:58.950, Speaker A: And that is true for all of these different devices, gadgets here. And. Cool. Flashing. So again, go. Go. Litis is a classic pixel artist, so it's wonderful to see him back.
00:28:58.950 - 00:29:15.166, Speaker A: Look at this. Adding code. So much imagination and energy in the work and even kind of glitches out here and everything. So just, you can tell he has a lot of fun. And he's a really nice dude, too. Reality. This is a good one.
00:29:15.166 - 00:29:37.892, Speaker A: These works, really. You know, I bought these works, these separate different works myself because I feel like they totally work on their own. Like, this one's awesome. Reality and just going through a tunnel in three dimensional space. Retro realm continuing on Wonderstorm. And this is virtual reality. So again, I love these works.
00:29:37.892 - 00:29:49.748, Speaker A: They're sold for really cheap. I think they're still available for a Tezos 50 edition of 50. So you're not breaking the bank on that. So anyways, welcome back. Go. Go. Litus Kappan's gift shop.
00:29:49.748 - 00:30:35.148, Speaker A: So cap'n, the guy who did the plant earlier, I believe, has a burrito. It's part of his gift shop. And he's using deluxe paint here, by the way, you almost see, like, the wave going through, the wave of color going through. And remember, was it Miyuji from yesterday who did the deluxe paint work that was based off of Sabato? Sabato's work? His name is sort of escaping me right now, but he also used Amiga deluxe paint, too. And so anyways, Kapman is using that as well. So just as part of our conversation there. And again, I'm a big fan when the background half moves here, but then here, it's static.
00:30:35.148 - 00:31:06.478, Speaker A: We kind of see a variation of that with. Is it Goyonga, who we looked at yesterday, who we opened the show with? So again, playing with this contrast of movement and non movement is quite powerful. So that was a burrito. Here is a sub. And so again, taking almost the Wayne Thibode pop culture, you know, food and using that as subject matter. And you see these pretty small files, which is really cool. Look at how beautiful this one is, Sunday.
00:31:06.478 - 00:31:27.634, Speaker A: And again, all editions of one. This one turned out really nice. Kind of reminds me of Flora Marquez, how, you know, putting out these things on a regular basis, you just evolve and you see the artist's evolution. This one in particular, I think is quite striking. This Sunday here, someone got a deal. This probably sold for ten tezos. Yeah, nice pickup.
00:31:27.634 - 00:31:52.874, Speaker A: And here's meatball spaghetti. And another one where the spaghetti turns green and blue. So interesting. And so anyways, some nice work from Capn Kappen's gift shop. This I just saw online and kind of fit with our pixel segment here. Our pixel art segment. This is posted by Aramis Smokey on chain brilliance from zero x art.
00:31:52.874 - 00:32:21.834, Speaker A: And I am following them soon to be tucked away in the vault. So I don't know if this is a close up or what. It seems to be like a recycling sign. And maybe reduce is being said here, but I agree, it's beautiful. So maybe we do a very quick look here. Okay, so this is Opensea, my first fully on chain SVG, and the genesis drop of the wasted data series. So anyway, that's pretty cool.
00:32:21.834 - 00:32:51.844, Speaker A: So more open editions. The debate continues and rages on about the open editions. So here's Sabato with a work that seems to be inspired by the metamorphosis here. The bug in bed with a poster on the wall, which is interesting, kind of differently rendered, which I thought was interesting. And this beautiful wallpaper here. And it looks like the bug is waking and baking, as they say. Get up, Gregor.
00:32:51.844 - 00:33:15.624, Speaker A: It's Monday morning again. Time to wake and bake. Full text of Kafka's metamorphosis in English. Can't vouch for the translation. You know, it matters, I think, because I've read the metamorphosis once and it was actually. It was very difficult to get through. So maybe that oftentimes, if something's difficult to get through, which is supposed to be famous and great, sometimes it's a translation.
00:33:15.624 - 00:33:32.984, Speaker A: Anyway, witty work here from Sabato. And yeah, just. Just a huge fan. So anyways. And I wonder what that is there. I almost wonder if that's, like something for measuring your weight. I'm not sure.
00:33:32.984 - 00:33:52.644, Speaker A: Anyways, all very cool from Sabato. Kurt Hussle collective Persi. So kind of a slightly different style here. Or maybe a new series. What is the Internet? Let's find out with Persi. A World Wide web adventure brought to you by JNK and Terry V. By for a Tezos, 50.
00:33:52.644 - 00:34:30.510, Speaker A: So let's see what they have up their sleeve this time, of course, they did the puppet pioneers and all those incredible commercials. You know, when I showed, and I don't really have many great pictures of the show the other night. I have, while I was setting up, just sending my girlfriend a image of, hey, this is what the screen looks like. I have a friend that took some pictures of people, of us. So maybe Bob has some pictures. So I need to ask Bob. But anyways, the moral of the story is I showed a few commercials by the Kurt Hussle collective, and those were a hit.
00:34:30.510 - 00:34:58.254, Speaker A: Like, people just couldn't get enough of the cell phone guy dancing. Those early commercials are stunning. Like, people love those. I think they're a lot more expensive now, by the way, Eitzo with some futuristic seventies furniture here. Future end table buy for eleven. So continuing the richness here and the glorious color here. And the glorious series here is a bit of a green tint future shelf, too.
00:34:58.254 - 00:35:37.344, Speaker A: This five level shelf has plenty of storage space and a steel staggered wooden edge for a modern, rustic look. So it's almost like a catalog. And here it is. And so I, you know, there's something to be said for just kind of getting a process nailed and then being able to just churn it out like a factory. Because what it does is it shows that the process itself is almost the art, you know, to a certain degree. And that's like the genius of it is, look, I put this process machine together and now I can just, like Warhol or Sigmar Polka, I can just make endless amounts. So really cool work from eight.
00:35:37.344 - 00:36:04.386, Speaker A: So nice work. And lb wavelength. So here's an abstract work, also kind of glitch. Artist uses a lot of video as well. So this one's more symmetrical and just kind of abstract colors here buy for five edition of ten, 800 by 600 and recorded with capture card using ederal and Panasonic gear. Morlacos. Another guy, I guess he's been on the scene.
00:36:04.386 - 00:36:20.614, Speaker A: And so here he's been releasing some interesting kind of profile pictures. So serial pixels. I've been doing really well with the time, the last couple episodes, so I'm going to run through the rest here anyways. Morlakos, looking good. Addition of 30. I think this sold out. Trademark ladders in the sky here.
00:36:20.614 - 00:36:34.902, Speaker A: Okay, so. And here are these. Interesting. One of one PFPs profile pictures. So interesting. Not sure what's going on there. Lewis Osborne releasing different colors.
00:36:34.902 - 00:36:50.322, Speaker A: So we were discussing this, right, and how great I think this is. And so now he's got four collectors are loving it. Okay, so everybody's happy. And here is another one, the yellow version. Follow the leader. V three. So very cool.
00:36:50.322 - 00:37:25.158, Speaker A: Antonio loves angel saints, prophets, adding a little bit of blue into the mix here. And again playing with this kind of religious imagery in his trademark style. All very beautiful and yeah, some kind of mythological creature here and strange sand and growing into a plant. So anyways, more kind of mystical work. Book of Lamentations buy for 1777 edition of seven we're looking at Lewis Harriot and I'm not sure if we looked at these works here. I think we're looking at Lewis Harriet. This is posted on Twitter and just kind of surreal illustration.
00:37:25.158 - 00:37:51.002, Speaker A: It kind of goes really well with Antonio loves in that respect. It's almost a, you know, a category unto itself. Surreal illustration. Like look at this. So very interesting. I think we're looking at Louis work yesterday, Flora Marquez with a couple of more here. I think I picked this up actually for it was like 15 or maybe 20 on secondary and just interesting, you know, multi arms, multi eyes.
00:37:51.002 - 00:38:03.194, Speaker A: You can do it. Eat that ice cream. Enjoy. And so anyway, it's just continuing to be interesting here. And here was another 1 February 7 when I was born. I saw a strong light. I saw a strong like light.
00:38:03.194 - 00:38:25.078, Speaker A: Babies don't like that. So interesting and mysterious. Maybe that fits into this realist illustration show as well. Kant, who appeared last week on the spaces, has announced a grid series. Three works from the series soon to be dropped on makersplace. Stay tuned. And what I liked about this, I used to be a Goa DJ.
00:38:25.078 - 00:38:46.948, Speaker A: A little known fact like 20 years ago and can't so to New Delhi. So it's like. It sounds like it's Asterix. Yeah, it's, it's, it's go a trance. One day I'll unearth those mixes. I have a few. Maybe I shouldn't.
00:38:46.948 - 00:39:13.786, Speaker A: Maybe they should stay in. Anyways, I don't want to distract from the series here, but anyways, heads up. Can't show up tomorrow. I sent you an invite personally, actually, and talk about your series and what you're up to at the Twitter spaces. That is what it's for. And everybody else you want to talk about anything that is your chance. And don't wait because it takes the hour passes fast and I'm pretty kind of strict about ending it after 60, 65 minutes.
00:39:13.786 - 00:39:38.842, Speaker A: Julian Gashadot structures output testing new ISO patterns. So this kind of looks like generative art a little bit, if not a lot, right? So anyways, I just thought this was a really kind of interesting work. So kind of different. We've seen similar things, but nothing quite like that. And then Georgie with another one. Or maybe we've looked at this one, but it went for. There's a bid on it and.
00:39:38.842 - 00:39:52.342, Speaker A: .1, so that is cool. We'll just take a very, very quick look at Georgie. We're already at the 40 minutes mark, so I'm going to run through the rest here. Yeah. So this was just listed February 6. So this is a new one.
00:39:52.342 - 00:40:21.858, Speaker A: And it looks like he's incorporating some kind of column here. You know, it's interesting when you look at the ancient roman and greek columns, like they are kind of divided like that, and then they're put on top of each other. You kind of a window into the construction, into the process. These are always kind of interesting, have captured my interest. These works here is a cool kind of AWP artwork by Cato. Another one, I don't think we looked at this one. And so anyways, just kind of cool abstraction.
00:40:21.858 - 00:40:38.214, Speaker A: And again, kind of an aw part feel to it. Monday I'm in love. And Eric Swan. Now this, I wasn't quite sure what this was. This is. He says he's an architect. And anyways, I thought it was kind of interesting.
00:40:38.214 - 00:41:18.556, Speaker A: So it's coming closer. So just works that he's working on. So I'm not sure what's going on here, but it looks pretty good, doesn't it? And so back to Sabato with, and I believe this is a. Or this is glitch art, what he calls post photography. Two cats, h eif, data bending studies. So this would be classic glitch, because again, remember our definition of glitch from the spaces? Strictly speaking, it's kind of taking a technology and then disturbing it, and that's malfunctioning and then celebrating that malfunction. We had a much cleaner definition, but basically that's the idea.
00:41:18.556 - 00:41:37.364, Speaker A: High efficiency image file is an image format used by apple phones. Of course I know that. So they figured out how to glitch those. How cool is that? He databending studies. Very cool and very cool effect here. Buy for eight. Really smart art, as usual.
00:41:37.364 - 00:41:49.502, Speaker A: From Sabato editions of six. Buy for eight. So nice low editions. Two left. I might have to pick that up. Sky Goodman birthday self portrait. So it is also Sky Goodman's birthday.
00:41:49.502 - 00:42:03.966, Speaker A: So happy birthday, Sky Goodman. And here is his portrait. And so anyways, that is awesome. Photogrammetry, self portrait and birthday self portrait. So there you go. Buy for five. Still available.
00:42:03.966 - 00:42:33.014, Speaker A: I think sometimes I load up these pages the night before. And this was also we've been looking at Ilya moved's AI work here of stitches. This is all done with AI. Okay, so, yeah, anyway, so just another AI stitches, you know, showing a pattern which looks like textile. And this is available on foundation, part of that contest that Ilay was in as well. So very cool. Elena Lazutina.
00:42:33.014 - 00:42:50.202, Speaker A: So this is kind of AI generative. Cheers. I'm excited to show you my first own collection, color of happiness on object. It's made with a lot of love, is filled with color and happiness. The collection has additions and one of one. So here it is. And it's got some fun music, color of happiness.
00:42:50.202 - 00:43:12.156, Speaker A: And let's actually look at the work. So here is 150 celebration street AI post processing frame by frame animation Gif. So interesting. You can kind of get the AI feel for it here. And I'll show you the entire series. So buy for 110 edition of twelve. So there are offers for 50.
00:43:12.156 - 00:43:29.356, Speaker A: So it is popular. And here is the series. And give Elena a follow here. Here is the series. And yeah, so you can check that out and cool. Yeah, I feel like I've seen. Yeah, Varya, I was like, I've seen this kind of indoor outdoor.
00:43:29.356 - 00:43:50.338, Speaker A: So here's a collaboration maif the collective of AI people. So anyways, all very cool and all very fun. It's pretty attractive. And so kind of architecture and just kind of cool. Almost like nostalgia, retro colors a little bit. Anyway, you can check that out on object. And finally, a little more AI.
00:43:50.338 - 00:44:11.362, Speaker A: Kika nikola AI fashion. I guess it's like AI fashion week. Have you seen the hashtags for that and everything? So anyways, just kind of keeping tabs here on the AI fashion. I thought this one was pretty particularly interesting and original. Almost like candy here. Candyland number three. It's sweet, it's fun, it's colorful.
00:44:11.362 - 00:44:24.498, Speaker A: Welcome to Candy Land. So that's Kika Nikolay La. And that is 100. And it's a one of one on tazos. And here's the rest of the series. Actually, I think we showed this one here. Plastic playground.
00:44:24.498 - 00:44:49.796, Speaker A: So again, the AI's ability to render, like, clear, transparent plastics like that is pretty amazing. And this was interesting. So remember MCh X and these were dynamic. These though are jpegs. So McHx, I think wisely is turning them into still jpegs. And I think they look stunning. This doesn't need to be an mp4.
00:44:49.796 - 00:45:10.200, Speaker A: This works quite beautifully on its own. And it kind of uses AI and kind of digital color field. And of course we think of Mark Rothko with color field. And look at this one. So this is a one of one available for 40. Quite successful, I would say. Quite beautiful and successful.
00:45:10.200 - 00:45:38.246, Speaker A: So this is just a small sample here, but I mean, it's just endless, the amount of works they could make out of those videos. So how cool is that? Back to like a really cool process. And Ilay has some new prisms here, so some new AI art from ilay. So interesting kind of colors coming from the sky and prisms. Landscape, I guess is down here, but it's up here as well. But you can't tell, the reflection is ambiguous. And then there's landscape over here.
00:45:38.246 - 00:46:11.864, Speaker A: So anyway, it's just really good looking work. Available for a song Prism Sky, AI Prism sky by ilay edition of 20. And here's another one with you can see the prism coming from the sky, and the prism colors, and the beautiful painterly landscape here. So anyways, beautiful work from aile, as usual. Again available on Tezos, kind of keeping with the theme. A beautiful work from Mister Shapeless. Look at this, the wanderer figure here, who's quite large compared to actually what looks like forest.
00:46:11.864 - 00:46:37.606, Speaker A: So the giant here, and this great landscape here with what looks like two suns, maybe a moon and a sun reminiscent of Star wars. And then finally Cavallele with a physical work. And I thought quite a nice drawing. Kind of has a dega feel to it, doesn't it? So it is very likely that his name is John or Jack. Edition of five. I think this is sold out. Yeah, mech TXT is a huge fan.
00:46:37.606 - 00:46:49.974, Speaker A: I think of Kevali as many people are. It looks great. Huge. So anyways, thanks again everyone for joining me and I wish you the best and hopefully I see you on Twitter spaces tomorrow. Until next time, care.
