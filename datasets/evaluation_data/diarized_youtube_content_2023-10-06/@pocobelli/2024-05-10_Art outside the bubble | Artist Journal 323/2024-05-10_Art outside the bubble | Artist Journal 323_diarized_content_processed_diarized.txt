00:00:03.560 - 00:00:18.558, Speaker A: Searching for 15 on the volume here. Still trying. Still pressing the button. Hello and welcome back. Happy Friday, everybody. As I sing into the, what they call the Hof out here in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokobeli.
00:00:18.558 - 00:00:49.864, Speaker A: Artist journal, May 10, 2024. Making it up as I go along, existing both inside and outside the nervous system simultaneously in two dimensions. Broadcasting live on tape, we might say a live recording. An oxymoron, perhaps. A paradox, a contradiction. Anyways, shall we begin? Shall we begin? A pretty big show gonna go. Probably.
00:00:49.864 - 00:01:31.510, Speaker A: The way I'm kind of framing this in my mind is these last, you know, today's show and the last show. And thank you for the epic response, by the way, on the last show. It's nice that people care and everything, you know, who says twitter is unfriendly place, right? And of course it can be, but not, you know, this scene's awesome, is, I guess, what I'm trying to say. And, yeah, the hair is going to be a conceptual art piece for the next few weeks here, unless I figure out a backup plan. My hairdresser is doing a yoga workshop, and so, yeah, so I will figure it out. We will figure it out. Like, we figure everything out.
00:01:31.510 - 00:01:52.234, Speaker A: All to say, though, yeah, hopefully Monday. Hopefully Monday. I'm aiming for the 45 to an hour, and I'll just. Probably just kind of cut it off in my mind that. That time that it'll be. So I'm trying not to get distracted here by the hair. Anyways, let's go, young arts.
00:01:52.234 - 00:02:14.714, Speaker A: Go, young arts. So we've seen a ton of goyan arts work, and actually, let's turn on the volume because that is a crucial component here. But let me just. Okay, not hit the stop. Here we go. I mean, it looks like volcano, maybe. That gives me time here.
00:02:14.714 - 00:02:53.296, Speaker A: It kind of looks like a. Kind of like a geological ancient. Almost like the dinosaur landscapes that you see, but with goats on it, mountain goats, with volcanoes. And of course, as you see here, some parts of this kind of illustrative painting are pixelated out. Almost random. It's like random masks, is how I would describe it. A super original style, as we see the lava here going, and then pixelated out almost like a mask.
00:02:53.296 - 00:03:35.748, Speaker A: And for those that might not know what a mask is, it's like putting on another layer on top of a layer in Photoshop, let's say, and then putting a filter just in a certain area where you draw. So you see it almost looks like a little bit of a paintbrush stroke, so to speak. Oh, we'll just do a little bit here, a little bit there. And that is kind of trademark goyoung arts and beautiful illustrations and even the audio. So beautiful here. So there are a few. This is with AOTM Art of the millennium, which is a crypto gallery, I think artist in residence program.
00:03:35.748 - 00:04:01.504, Speaker A: I believe it was kind of announced maybe a year and a half ago. Right. With Vincent van Doe is the account that I am trying to think is, I think, one of the people. Prominent collector in the web. Three crypto space is available as a one of one. The sale will begin on May 7, which is three days ago. So not sure exactly what they went for.
00:04:01.504 - 00:04:38.255, Speaker A: Here's another one. And this was part of a residency program that Goyang Arts was doing. Beautiful, you might say nature works. And look at almost a heartwarming leopard cheetah here. A little bit more animation, maybe with a little bit of a paw reaching down. Just beautiful. I mean, there's something about these works.
00:04:38.255 - 00:04:56.294, Speaker A: Like, I feel like they could all start this program. All of them. Like, they're all just beautiful, beautiful works. And the bugs. Summer is coming. Oh, look at how cool the bugs are up here. That is so cool.
00:04:56.294 - 00:05:16.444, Speaker A: So this looks like bears, I guess. And the pixelation. I mean, so much work. I mean, look at these animations here. I mean, the butterfly, this is no short animation. And then it probably loops and goes through the pixels. Beautiful poetry.
00:05:16.444 - 00:05:39.940, Speaker A: Beautiful visual poetry from Goyeong arts. This is called nap. And let's just take a quick look here. So this is part of the artist in residence program that they have been doing. Air one, artist in residence. And I think these are some of the Amon Jahanger, Rebecca Rose, goyong. I think these are the first three.
00:05:39.940 - 00:06:04.692, Speaker A: So as you see, so diverse group here. And I'm not sure if it says where Goyang Arts is from. I thought maybe Korea, but I could be wrong about that. Let me just. Let's just see if we can get this right. Nice website. Go arts is not here.
00:06:04.692 - 00:06:20.082, Speaker A: Okay? So. Okay, so let's just keep going here. Anyway, rad artist. As many of you know, Tornado Rodriguez, thank you for appearing on the previous show. It was a wonderful show. Check it out. It is in the feed.
00:06:20.082 - 00:06:35.602, Speaker A: And here's tornado. I had the best time talking on the show with Pokebelly and Rune tune. Thanks for inviting me. Thanks to everyone who stopped by. And, yeah, let me just echo that. Thanks for everybody for checking that out. It was super fun and it was great just to have a show focused solely on tornado.
00:06:35.602 - 00:06:57.066, Speaker A: So that is in the feed. Also in tornadoes feed and also little cakes. I almost feel scooped. I was like oh, who was it here fellowship XYz had little cakes on the show so that is super cool. Mumble boy posting it. Just listen to this great interview with little cakes, also known as everything is soft. We share a lot with both of us.
00:06:57.066 - 00:07:24.704, Speaker A: Being born in Japan and I used to living in the US and going to art school, but we are so different at the same time. Definitely worth a listen. So that is awesome too. So shout out to little cakes, mumble boy, tornado and everyone, let's look at comments as we run and get to our Friday. Our exciting Friday here. This was a super nice comment, Madeline Onassis. Madeline maybe this is just the account name.
00:07:24.704 - 00:08:00.334, Speaker A: I love watching your videos so much. The artwork you highlight is often surprisingly original and lets me know that art is still alive. You know, just last episode we were talking about, you know, appealing to the world outside the bubble. And hearing this comment like this makes me wonder if this is kind of someone from outside the kind of little crypto bubble who maybe came across this show. Anyways, it was a very nice comment and I'm thrilled. That is like one of my favorite. What more could you ask for for that reaction? So huge.
00:08:00.334 - 00:08:11.314, Speaker A: Thank you for that awesome comment DJ Kuro. Welcome back Pokebelly. You were missed. It's a sad lonely place without you. Thanks for showing my new video game glitch art. My pleasure my friend. And we have a few more by you today.
00:08:11.314 - 00:08:30.292, Speaker A: Very interesting work from Kuro Kuro on a roll, releasing a ton of work, selling lots of it. That's kind of like how it should be. So shout out to Kiro Skamra. Welcome back. It's you. So I brought it up again because I wasn't sure last time. This is by scom right here.
00:08:30.292 - 00:09:00.784, Speaker A: As you can see, someone I think was low, trippy or something I think was saying that this is kind of like based on the Doom character, which I like, the doom, the video game, which I think might be right. And I thought maybe that person just happened to look kind of similar. It is me. I'm tempted to use this as a profile picture. I mean, this is pretty rad portrait. And there have been like. And just kind of, you know what else I like? I keep seeing all the gray there on my hair too.
00:09:00.784 - 00:09:17.916, Speaker A: And it's like, look at that nice kind of black head of hair. So all to say, yeah, just really nice portrait from Skomra. Thank you Skamra and great to thanks for telling me too. I'll add it to the collection. Kyle Flemmer. Welcome back, Adrian. Thank you, Kyle.
00:09:17.916 - 00:09:47.044, Speaker A: Actually, some beautiful work by Kyle here. That tiling, that tiling that you can do in aspirate is just incredibly. I can't wait to get to that one day. Among the many other things I want to do. But I can't wait to try, try my hand at some of the tiling I just made. All I did with the tiling on aseprite is I just put in the ultima for, what do they call it? Sprite sheet, maybe something like that. And I just made Christmas cards with it for friends and family.
00:09:47.044 - 00:10:07.168, Speaker A: So it does. It does work. You know, I got it to work and k town cryptoking. Three weeks. How dare you? And I, maybe I'll take the opportunity to mention. So June, I go back to Canada just for like a week and a half, but it'll probably be two weeks. Two weeks to show we're in kind of vacation season, but I think it's fine as far as we'll be.
00:10:07.168 - 00:10:30.464, Speaker A: That's not for another month. And this show goes three days a week. And we'll probably still keep doing the spaces, which I've never missed on those Wednesdays. So all to say, yeah, so gonna be. And then in July, actually, I'm going to my cousin's, has a house in Spain or just like a summer house sort of thing. So I'll go just for a week at the start of July. So lots of traveling, but it's all good.
00:10:30.464 - 00:10:45.194, Speaker A: And I hope. I hope. Thank you and thanks. So, thank you. Let me take the opportunity then to thank everybody for this massive response. Almost 15,000 views in two days. 75 retweets, almost 200 likes there.
00:10:45.194 - 00:10:52.874, Speaker A: A lot of bookmarks, tons of comments. Huge. Thank you. Huge. Thank you. So, Kels, the tan suits you. Thank you.
00:10:52.874 - 00:11:22.608, Speaker A: You know, yeah, I need to, you know, get, I need to put some suntan. Suntan lotion or whatever. Sunblock. Uh, just on that point, the reason I say that, uh, because not everybody realizes 80% of aging of your skin is sunlight. So it's well worth your while, uh, to take care of yourself. Usually I do this. This year, I was a little kind of lazy or just kind of, uh, slow on the draw.
00:11:22.608 - 00:11:32.568, Speaker A: So something to take, uh, care of. Evelyn, Richard, Sarah, maybe. Huge sculptures. Exactly. Because Frank Stella. Richard Sarah, Frank Stella. I do confuse the two.
00:11:32.568 - 00:12:01.318, Speaker A: Their names kind of have a similar rhythm and rhyme, so. Yes, exactly. Richard Serra was the artist who died about a month ago. Very famous. And of course, Frank Stella just passed away as we saw in the community there what looks like while I was gone in the last couple of weeks. So a couple of notable figures in the art history, really, whose works pretty much everybody has seen. Human boy, happy have you back.
00:12:01.318 - 00:12:29.782, Speaker A: Glad you enjoyed your vacation now, human boy, I mean, it's an all star cast here. Wait until you see how many views human boy has gotten on a work that was posted like yesterday. Last I saw it was about a quarter of a million views. I mean, this is like the records I've seen is popple hitting 4 million. Let's see how this one does because it seems to be on a similar trajectory. So feels like I've been in the desert thirsty for weeks. So anyways, huge shout out.
00:12:29.782 - 00:12:46.998, Speaker A: We're gonna look at that post that human boy also put in the community awesomely. Thank you, human boy, great to hear from you. And Ranix dear. Welcome back. I believe that means and just awesome to hear from you. Rannix and Silva sand two, sorry for the delay, but I'm very happy to have you back. Really appreciate the mentions.
00:12:46.998 - 00:13:20.508, Speaker A: You're welcome. And Silva sand twos has probably put out, you know, I would think at least a couple of hundred of these glitch roms and they're really starting like they're going somewhere. What I would say each one of these little compositions, like this one is awesome. The Pyramids were awesome. This one with the big pixels, they were all really nicely done. So it's fun to watch someone who is just very focused on this, you know, glitch rom thing and just keeps like getting better and better. So very cool work.
00:13:20.508 - 00:13:33.328, Speaker A: Real idol, new suntan, who diss. Great to see you, Poco. Exactly. Yeah, you don't get now we're getting some sun in Berlin, but sometimes the winters, it's like six months of cloud. You've been missed. Thank you. And Axeen, awesome.
00:13:33.328 - 00:13:57.124, Speaker A: Who dis awesome and beautiful? You gotta love how Axeen, I think, creates kind of remixes the memes. Here are some adding some pixelations to the memes. So just awesome. And everybody medal on. Thank you, Lucian Aguera, awesome to hear from you. Sanrow, thanks for the advice. Exactly the kind of the loose rule in the community, I'm thinking, and it's for your benefit as well.
00:13:57.124 - 00:14:19.160, Speaker A: Just put a piece or two per week to not drown everybody else out and so people don't tune out. You know, just put your. Let things shine, so to speak. Retro Manny, we have an awesome gif by retro Manny or video this episode as well. Captain. Great to have you back, Adrian, and hope that you had a great time on vacation. So nice to see mainframe zero two featured.
00:14:19.160 - 00:14:34.054, Speaker A: Yeah, just awesome, awesome, awesome work and artista des conquhijito. Respect, good content. Thank you. Austin, awesome to hear from you. One of one. Yeah. The dream that I had that I woke, the words I woke up with, this is forever.
00:14:34.054 - 00:14:48.500, Speaker A: Thanks for the comment. Lily illo limbo. Awesome. Great episode. Loved your take on Farcaster. Genuine and well exposed. I have to agree with you that Twitter is a necessary means to bring this art scene to a wider audience.
00:14:48.500 - 00:15:03.664, Speaker A: Good you're back. Thanks for the little feature too. You're welcome. It is interesting, isn't it? I think we have one more post just on that thread. I think it was skulltakes who posted braindead, glad, thanks for the comment. Braindead, glad you like the pieces, appreciate the highlights. You're welcome.
00:15:03.664 - 00:15:22.688, Speaker A: Chromevoid, great to hear from you. Great journal, couldn't stop watching and thank you, Amelia Versace. Thank you, trippie collector and everyone. So you just got to love it. So again, who says Twitter is a cold, dark place? Zuozo, great to have you back. Mo. You know, and this is interesting.
00:15:22.688 - 00:15:53.874, Speaker A: Mo, like, how's Mo doing? 8000 followers. Like, Mo has this kind of super prolific AI artist and we're gonna see also uncoat, who's also. It's very interesting what's going on here. You have human boy, quarter of a million views. Mo has had some very huge success with just views on like, let's say Twitter. I think it's okote on Instagram. We're going to look near.
00:15:53.874 - 00:16:05.854, Speaker A: I think we'll see it in a few tabs. I mean, it's doing amazing. Berku or Byram. Thank you, pink ape wife. Awesome to hear from me. So thanks, everybody. You make me feel appreciated and loved, which is a lot in this world.
00:16:05.854 - 00:16:25.106, Speaker A: Which means a lot in this world here is okay, so and just from the community, we're going to come back to human boy's thing because it's doing insanely well. I have it in a separate tab here, bulls from neutro. We just released this little video summarizing the bosque grazias experience. Super cool. That's on Zora. And so thank you, everybody. Doctor version.
00:16:25.106 - 00:16:44.114, Speaker A: We're going to look at this piece also in the show, Martin Joe portrait of Barugo. So very cool. And thank you everybody for posting. Here's skull takes and also here's the little cake. So, I mean, just awesome. So we're booming over here. We are booming gogolites.
00:16:44.114 - 00:17:09.624, Speaker A: Thank you, Pokebelly. So we mentioned Gogolitis putting out his own token to build on what you're saying about Gogo and this new platform, pools. Let's just see. Map your community and identify your most loyal fans. Reward them for their engagement with on chain points. Mint your token now. So Gogo, like Santiago, putting out his own token.
00:17:09.624 - 00:17:52.474, Speaker A: It's after having studied what pools had to offer that I subscribed to their service, as it's indeed very interesting on several fronts. First, it allows me to have a form of traceability of my collectors across different blockchains. No small matter. Actually, this is actually really cool. Whether they collect me on Tezos or EtH, that's a big deal, because that's almost the sort of thing that, like, if you start making a lot of money as an artist and you have an employee, or I know some artists here who have had interns who are doing well enough where they could kind of convince an intern to do like an internship with them, this is the sort of thing you get, like your help. The people who are helping people who can help you to do, because you have to make the art. You're doing all these other things.
00:17:52.474 - 00:18:23.480, Speaker A: Can you make a list of the collectors? So if this token does it, that's pretty cool. Then it's an automated system where airdrops happen seamlessly, providing peace of mind. So I guess you put in the places you've minted your art, and then the token gets sent to that, this kind of stake token. For now, the token isn't transferable, interestingly, meaning it doesn't have a market value. It's to be considered like Miles you'd earn from an airline company that can unlock certain benefits. I wonder if that's because of the SEC and investigations into these being securities. But this isn't final.
00:18:23.480 - 00:18:49.124, Speaker A: As I read in the pool's documentation that it's possible to take the token fully transferable, thus giving it a market value. That does seem like the end game. However, even without a market value, this token can already be useful. You may have noticed on the page there's a link to the leaderboard of Gogo holders. This means I could, for example, choose to reward the top 1020 or 50 holders of the token. In short, it can lead to all sorts of operations. Exactly.
00:18:49.124 - 00:19:17.944, Speaker A: Very interesting. Another interesting thing, I personally own 2 billion gogo, and there's a pool of 6 billion beside it. It's from this pool of 6 billion tokens that are airdropped every Friday to eligible wallets. But this pool can be treated as a form of public fund as I can also manually allocate an allowance to certain wallets so that these same wallets are allowed to use Gogo from this pool of 6 billion, enabling them to transfer them to people of their choice. Just like with the Degen token on Warpcast. I haven't had time to deal with it yet, but it's still early to do so. That's all.
00:19:17.944 - 00:19:34.412, Speaker A: That's what comes from my mind now. I'm still learning, but feel free to ask if you have questions. If I know the answer, I'll be happy to provide the information. Very interesting. Like maybe in a month or two we can. I can convince gogolites to come on the spaces and talk about how this is all going. Maybe invite Santiago too.
00:19:34.412 - 00:20:09.560, Speaker A: That would be really cool. Speaking of Santiago, here we go. Hi, Poco, so glad this. So this was my mistake. This wasn't so much Santiago's mistake or anything because I saw this background color and I thought of mumble boy and I was like, oh, this isn't a mumble boy work, but this is just a typical, you know, gradient of a rainbow, right? Green, blue, purple. So hi, Poco, so glad this work made you feel that it was a collab with boy in the mumble because mumble boy often uses this kind of rainbow gradient because he's an inspiration for me every day. We will collaborate soon, I hope.
00:20:09.560 - 00:20:31.836, Speaker A: Thanks, Bokebelli, and welcome back. Beautiful work. And clearly, actually, when you look up close here, this is clearly Santiago's beautiful new work here. So that was my mistake. But then there was a kind of a happy thing came out of this. So, mumble boy, so happy to share with you this collaboration with Santiago. And this came out yesterday, out for a walk in the opposite sides of the planet.
00:20:31.836 - 00:20:58.200, Speaker A: So they put out a quick collaboration here, or maybe it was already in the works. It started with Pokebelly mistaking Santiago's work as a collab with me. I was thinking of asking him anyway, so I did it and it went super quick from there. So it's just nice quick work put together. They sent me one as well, by the way, so thank you for that. And just very cool work. Very interesting to see these two styles collide, isn't it? Skull takes on warpcast.
00:20:58.200 - 00:21:18.522, Speaker A: It's. I'm glad to hear from you limbo before because, yeah, I think it's just an interesting thread. It's worth noting what is happening there. So skull takes. This gives me a better clue as to why my tip allowance is going down. I noticed. Yeah, I noticed the tips have gotten lower on Warpcast as well.
00:21:18.522 - 00:21:46.766, Speaker A: I think in this, like in the new, because every month they pay you out. And I just want to, again, thank everybody who has tipped me for what I put on that platform. Engagement is down because of in real life work. So I assume skulltakes talking about their own life. Also, other apps have taken away some attention and activity from here recently. So maybe from skulltakes own life, I think. Okay, so, but daily engagement down 37%.
00:21:46.766 - 00:22:18.354, Speaker A: I feel like, just like when I do kind of check in, I do feel like the engagement is down compared to at the beginning. But I am also impressed at the resilience. There's quite a resilience there, too. So people do like what they're experiencing on this. For those that don't know, this kind of parallel crypto, Twitter is what this is. If I had to kind of summarize, and there's all sorts of crypto kind of features, but you'll see it's a similar user interface to Twitter, as you see here. See, this is warpcast.
00:22:18.354 - 00:22:45.834, Speaker A: This is Twitter. So you see, it's almost like, as they say in the crypto world, a fork of swords of Twitter continuing on. Ollie Stewart. People look for undervalued art and opportunities, things that will be obvious in hindsight, but the market is missing right now. The most obvious to me is analog glitch art. Interesting. We have creative geniuses out here with specific skills, collecting vintage gear, fixing, tinkering, connecting, and putting it on blockchain for the future.
00:22:45.834 - 00:23:33.816, Speaker A: There really may be something to this. You know, I would, you know, I think of, again, August ground, who is sort of itemizing these kind of mega new genres. And I put in quotes because maybe they're not so new. Again, glitch, as we're learning from John Cates, I think in a previous episode, you know, you can go back to, like, the seventies of different kinds of glitch work. So I use new, you know, blog new genres and quotes, but nevertheless, with some charity, were we to call these new genres. You know, you kind of have pixel art, you have glitched, you have AI. Like, I would actually say those three, I've counted about seven or eight.
00:23:33.816 - 00:24:07.044, Speaker A: Like, I've. Yeah, so I've counted about seven or eight in the past when I put a show together a year and a half ago, and I called it the genres of digital art, and there's about seven. Like, I put digital painting as a genre. Right? Because so anyways, these are all loose definitions. Let's continue with Ollie Stewart's very interesting comment here and putting it on the blockchain for the future. While glitch as a genre has gained a lot of recognition, a lot of people haven't dug into the analog side of it, but I think they will. So really emphasizing the analog glitch, this is interesting.
00:24:07.044 - 00:24:38.678, Speaker A: These are unique and beautiful art pieces that represent a specific moment in technology. We also, thankfully have knowledgeable curators, ogs, and leaders in the analog glitch art community, folks, you can discover works to collect. Let's glitch it. Sky Goodman, Inavari, eightso Labs, Exmortal LB, max capacity, asynips, squids dev, and many more. Exactly. So very cool, very interesting, actually comment. Another interesting provocation from Robnis V three.
00:24:38.678 - 00:25:21.986, Speaker A: This is probably the most boring this space has gotten in ten years. I've been around here, not gonna lie, and how to fix that. And it's an interesting question, like the way I would frame it, because I actually don't feel that way. If I thought it was super boring, I wouldn't do this show. But I think it's an interesting comment, which is, I think the space, you know, I've been in it since 2020. Like late summer 2020 was when I first, you know, got my Binance account, which I think is not a bad kind of start, you know, if you're to pick a starting point, which is how I got started, or maybe even like before, I'd like uphold before buying. And then I had coinbase and then I had binance, let's say uphold.
00:25:21.986 - 00:26:04.168, Speaker A: I got August 2020. So it's been almost four years, incredibly. And what I would say from my more, you know, not as long of perspective, shorter perspective, let's say, or not as long. I would say it's just in a moment of transition. Because the, you know, and what makes it seem exciting, is it because there's not like million dollar sales every second week? I would argue the art is probably the strongest it's ever been. If I was to just kind of speculate on, you know, out loud here, think out loud. I think the art's the best it's ever been.
00:26:04.168 - 00:27:00.574, Speaker A: And I think we've gotten used to the art being good or having enough good art around. And I think the artists who have stayed in this space, like you look at someone like Goyang arts, who's probably been around at least for 2234 years in the space, and we see the evolution of these artists, we see the evolution of, like Sabato with the drawing exercises. We see the evolution of Kappen, we see the evolution of RJ, we see the evolution of Tornado Rodriguez, Flora Marquez and many, many more. So I don't feel, I don't agree with this, but I think it's an interesting comment. I think it's more a comment that the space is in a moment of transition. I think the whole blockchain space, I suspect is in a moment of transition. And, yeah, I mean, I could probably wax poetic for a little while on that.
00:27:00.574 - 00:28:29.330, Speaker A: Like I. Yeah, the whole space to me feels like, you know, put it this way. These are the things on my mind which I'll share very briefly. I look at Polkadot and they're, I don't know if you guys are paying attention to what's going on in Polkadot, but this whole jam thing and where it sounds like you're going to be able to run any application on the blockchain and not have the same kind of frictions that you have in traditional blockchains, that's what it sounds like. They're going to build where you can have your Microsoft Outlook, for example, as far as I understand, what they're going to do on what they're calling jam, which is what is going to take a year to build, let's say at that point, what are the implications? This is just thoughts that I have. Nobody has to agree with me, but what are the implications for the entire so called altcoin scene at that point, if you can put any application on there and it's going to be better and even the login is not going to be this awkward wallet and everything, what are the implications for the rest of the scene should that happen? And then there's everything that's going on bitcoin, all the development that's going on bitcoin, you have those two things and I just go, you know, other than art, like, it's kind of like the perennial question with the whole blockchain scene. Like, what's the point of this? Other than, as they call it, remittance, what I call money transfer.
00:28:29.330 - 00:28:53.028, Speaker A: You know, money transfer and digital art are still, like, I'd argue the two main use cases. There are other use cases that are legit and, you know, all sorts of stuff. But anyways, just thoughts thinking out loud. Feel free to leave a comment if you disagree. They're not. What is it? How does the saying go? Strong opinions loosely held? Is that it? Anyways, let's continue. Dan control, interesting comment.
00:28:53.028 - 00:29:38.438, Speaker A: We are the generation of progressives, of imaginators, of digital people, of Internet, people, of PNG, MP3, jpEg, whatever you want, of those who want easy money, of those who don't want it but want it, of those who live in the past, of those who imagine their future, of those who imagine there being in a deceptive and pleasant past, for those who want to innovate above all, for those who want innovation, above all. So you know what I like about this? There's something kind of manifesto like about this statement here. It kind of sounds like a, you know, a paragraph out of a manifesto, actually. And I kind of like that. August ground. Art is reassert as reassurance. Art is ego fulfillment.
00:29:38.438 - 00:29:50.150, Speaker A: Art is financial strategy. Art is pleasant pastime. Art is arbiter of taste, of education, of class. Art is proof. Art for art's sake, art for your sake, art for mine. Nothing risked. Nothing gained or nothing gained.
00:29:50.150 - 00:30:17.104, Speaker A: Nothing risked. I quite like that last one, nothing gained. Well, it's because you didn't risk anything while you were creating, perhaps. Just interesting. I mean, if I was to summarize, my response would be, and I'm not even sure if I understand the context of this or anything, but my response would be, people make art for different reasons at the end of the day. And maybe this is just kind of a poetic version of that. So how is human boy doing? 242,000.
00:30:17.104 - 00:30:38.144, Speaker A: Shall we try reloading? Let's just see if there's an 254,000. And that's just in the last, like 15 minutes. I think I loaded that up maybe 20 minutes ago. So. So human boy on a roll. I see my computer freezing bit. So I'm going to kind of speed up here because I can't record this again, it's late in the day.
00:30:38.144 - 00:30:52.584, Speaker A: Cool image, by the way, and thanks for posting this in the community as well. Human boy, I love the medical stuff. I love it. It reminds me of the atrocity exhibition a little bit. Very, very cool. Love. Medical theme so 254,000.
00:30:52.584 - 00:31:32.306, Speaker A: Art outside the bubble is what that is. El coat, el okote, so okotay, I think el okote, 19.6. So 20,000 followers on Instagram. And look at this, this recent 1872 likes, 1241, 614, 860. And then getting like 68, and then 2000, so 22, 52,700. You know, this is 3000 likes. These are amazing numbers.
00:31:32.306 - 00:31:59.086, Speaker A: 3700, 7000. And you can tell like every time you get a massive post like this, you get like a ton of followers. So then you see the numbers jump after that. So okotay 8000. This is really impressive. 9000. So what's interesting too is you go back and you see it wasn't that long ago, it was 100.
00:31:59.086 - 00:32:35.334, Speaker A: 271, 201. Like we were looking at these, I feel like two months ago, like, when is this? Nine weeks ago. So this is how fast it can happen. And again, I feel like Instagram has taken a page from TikTok, which is reward people for sharing their content and if they put out good content, make it go viral rather than strangle its reach, which is what Instagram used to do. And I think they've learned that if you reward the user, the user will keep using your platform because there's something to be gained. It's not just, you know, about the platform. So, 5000.
00:32:35.334 - 00:33:01.604, Speaker A: So pretty impressive, right? And there's probably a breakthrough work here. 121 2016 301 377. Was it the UFO? And all of a sudden. 1046 728 2000. So these woodcuts with the shamans, we actually showed some of these in, I think these two maybe in the show. 5000. So art outside the bubble.
00:33:01.604 - 00:33:19.544, Speaker A: Very interesting and big congratulations to El Okote. To Okote. Cider Prince. So we were seeing. Look at this. Is this, you know what this looks like to me? If I had to guess, this looks like it's being done on canvas, but I am not sure. There's not enough information here.
00:33:19.544 - 00:33:36.404, Speaker A: So very cool. Can't wait to see what happens with cider. He's been experimenting for a couple of months with printing, as far as I understand. So very cool. Walk. Current bid, €98. Continuing the ebay selling.
00:33:36.404 - 00:33:50.608, Speaker A: Very unconventional. That's a real sale. And there is a real, like, collector base on eBay. Interestingly, worldwide shipping. So very cool. Let's see what you know. Shipping's a big deal these days.
00:33:50.608 - 00:34:07.460, Speaker A: Let's just see. So, €98, €29 shipping. That's pretty reasonable. That's probably what it would cost. Accetto tutto. So you can see all this other art. So very interesting what's going on here on eBay.
00:34:07.460 - 00:34:29.284, Speaker A: Like, very, you know, in a sense, a humble platform to show art, but it's very cool. I mean, walk again. Let's recall the. Speaking of manifestos. Speaking of manifestos, walk wrote a great one about a year ago, or actually six months ago, I think it was, when I was in Sicily last time. Private collection. Also, look at how good this looks.
00:34:29.284 - 00:35:01.053, Speaker A: This looks like a print, but it's probably an original, if I had to guess with the passepart. Two here, beautifully framed. That looks really good. So you can get some pretty good original art from walk again, imagine this in the past, part two. Original. Like when I see this, this makes me want to buy some walk physicals because that looks like a really good investment. Not investment advice, but that is just what I see.
00:35:01.053 - 00:35:40.520, Speaker A: Like, if you're getting something like that, original art, if you're paying like a hundred euros for that, you're getting one heck of a deal. Continuing on a sonic. How cool is cream sapphire? So I don't know what this is. This, I feel like maybe we saw this at one point and it kind of has a bit of a pong feel to it. And 2023, I think we actually looked at this, like Dalbin table, available on Dalbin table. So just a really interesting way of displaying. And I think we looked at this maybe a year ago about that.
00:35:40.520 - 00:36:13.678, Speaker A: So all very interesting. Let's continue. And for those who might not know who Sterling Ruby is, for those that don't, I came across this on my feed in Instagram and thought, oh, we might as well bookmark this. And this is the artist we were discussing yesterday on Katya Kazakhina's article, where they go for half a million and she's like, are they worth that? You see pretty interesting artist. And I think you can find video on YouTube of Sterling Ruby. And you see the work's just on the ground and he's just got this big kind of like canister spraying and everything. I actually, I quite like these.
00:36:13.678 - 00:36:42.414, Speaker A: But yeah. So all to say, but questions of value come up and I think they're also legitimate as we go into the works here. Zozo, sustained rhythm. So Zuozo is, you know, artists get hot. Zozo seems like it's getting kind of hotter. And let me just get the. Or is there's new, deeper appreciation for this very original artist here.
00:36:42.414 - 00:37:17.182, Speaker A: I mean, there's nothing like it. And the music is beautiful, too, the audio. So this is fairly new. This is from May 7, so a few days ago. Again, kind of looks like nature a little bit. This is for tazos and line extension, I think is buying a ton of NUV 1914 and Zozo and kind of similar artists to a certain degree or they hang really well. You could do a double show just with those artists.
00:37:17.182 - 00:37:32.770, Speaker A: They collaborate sometimes too. Interesting. So new account for me. Excuse me. So anyways, let's continue here for Tezos edition of ten two gone. And here, this is an old work, I think. I'm not sure how old this is super soft.
00:37:32.770 - 00:38:05.380, Speaker A: So. So 2000 sold out. Took a while, but 25 edition editions on primary are gone. If I knew that this was. I'd never seen this before. Not sure what that is. So cool.
00:38:05.380 - 00:38:26.344, Speaker A: I mean, this artist, you know, like some artists, like, it's like Martin Bruce. The more you see, at first they're difficult, and then the more you see, the more you go, wow. On secondary. Now for 200 tezos, maybe you can put an offer in and get one at a cheaper price, but no guarantees. Gozo. Morning, acrobats. Great title.
00:38:26.344 - 00:38:56.604, Speaker A: Kind of has a bit of an impressionist subject matter, or at least title. And here we see again, kind of almost pixelated out, but this kind of nice textured AI. Digital collage work by Gozo. Just another beautiful addition, a lot of ambiguity, interesting colors, interesting composition. Digital collage by gozo 2020. 4000 by 4000 addition of ten selling out at twelve tezos. Nice work.
00:38:56.604 - 00:39:25.686, Speaker A: So beautiful. Original, fun artwork here in our museum of the imagination here, I don't believe by Ed Morolla. So this is Max size. Always interesting with the size and Ed Marolla and really fun one with this crown here and this figure. You know, I kind of. I can see the fun. I was going to say I have a new appreciation for Ed Morolla after doing the pixel art Inferno, because I.
00:39:25.686 - 00:39:57.046, Speaker A: But it's more just a new appreciation, not for the work itself, but for the way it's made and the fun that is involved in just following your own thing and going, oh, maybe I should put a crown. Maybe. You know, it seems like Ed is very much. There's a lot like, would I be tempted to call more of an improvisational artist? Right? And you see it in the YouTube videos, which I highly recommend, by the way. And even just, you get all this kind of great stuff. You can't plan this. You just have to do it in the moment and it kind of looks good.
00:39:57.046 - 00:40:13.666, Speaker A: And art as recognition, right? Like where you make some scribbles and all of a sudden you go, I like that scribble. And maybe I'll adjust this and work with that. And that kind of way of working. It's a very fun way to work. And even look at these grape trees. Just beautiful. I don't believe.
00:40:13.666 - 00:40:29.734, Speaker A: Great title, two. And looks like sold out at two tezos, edition of 17. Nice work. And here's NUV 1914, who are just discussing. And this went to Cha for only ten tezos. Look at this. An interesting frame here.
00:40:29.734 - 00:40:55.204, Speaker A: And these two people. And look at this bottom area. So again, like Zuozo, just super experimental. Boldly courageous. Bold and courageous work here. But also like Zozo, very consistent, which makes it all the more persuasive. Very, very interesting work, as usual.
00:40:55.204 - 00:41:23.062, Speaker A: From Nuve 1914, auto parte won for only ten tazos. So, you know, I think the reason, like, you know, the art has slowed down. A lot of people have, uh, commented on in. In blockchain. Not as much art is selling, but there is still a lot of art selling. And I think it's because there is real value that is being created here. When you go, well, you can have this for ten days or even think of wok.
00:41:23.062 - 00:41:52.704, Speaker A: They're like, you saw that MF frame. Was that only €100? Right? And then you're getting that, like, I mean, there's some real value here for the price of one sterling ruby. Imagine how much digital art you could buy of impeccable quality. And you could fill a house, at least with woks, and you'd spend, like, 2% of your budget. Us. Billy the brat in green. So a new one by mumble boy.
00:41:52.704 - 00:42:13.978, Speaker A: So interesting as ever. So, as we saw in the beginning, the collaboration with Santiago. Now here. And remember the guitar from yesterday? And look at this. So, again, mixing physical and digital in a beautiful way. I love the color difference. And look at the paint, which seems to be its own commentary on something.
00:42:13.978 - 00:42:42.918, Speaker A: And even the QR code here and everything. So both, you know, undeniably digital in some ways and undeniably physical in others. Really interesting work. Even this kind of almost what looks like a cord of some kind with a shadow. So beautiful work there. Let's just quickly look, ten Tezos edition of one, still available. So, again, $9.57.
00:42:42.918 - 00:43:24.528, Speaker A: We're back to, you know, tezos under a dollar, where all of a sudden, I can go, you know, this will only cost you a buck 50 for some of these works, you know, like the good times, again, for the collectors. Involuntary thoughts. So, here, this was another one by La Delmas and I. Not sure if we were looking on Instagram or not, but you got to love this combination of what looks like collage down here, la Delma's kind of painting over here, and then pixelation over here, and what looks like even like some printing over here, like, Rizzo style printing. Weird piece. Like, in a good way. Involuntary thoughts.
00:43:24.528 - 00:43:45.972, Speaker A: And this is April 5, so I don't think we've seen. I've seen this one, or I've shown it on the program. So this is actually a bit over a month old. So about a month old. And here's another one. And this came out April 29. I think I showed this on Instagram, but I wanted to show it on Zora just so we could see that this is the edge here and these great bricks and everything.
00:43:45.972 - 00:44:12.236, Speaker A: Same artist. This is just pure digital painting. And you gotta love the poodle and everything, you know? Something else I was doing when I was in Rome, spending a lot of time with family, so I had a bit of extra time because, of course, you're not going to socialize all the time. And so I had the. I was just doing, like, pixel artworks of still lifes, and it was quite fun. Like, I was like, oh, this. You know, another thing that, you know, drawing from imagination, doing still lifes.
00:44:12.236 - 00:44:38.704, Speaker A: I'm not used to doing these, like, typical, what you might consider more typical art activities. And so, anyways, just enjoying doing, you know, maybe I'll do figure drawing next. Enjoy your mental power. This is Emilia Fantasia. So again, I'm loving the maximize feature here on Zora. It's so much easier to show the work on Zora. And I just love the spirit of this piece.
00:44:38.704 - 00:44:57.382, Speaker A: Here's the red wine and the cool woman with the sunglasses and, you know, just all ready for Friday here. Enjoy your mental power. 81 minted. Doing really well. Another 90 days to go and getting this enjoy token too. Look at all these comments, Sulkian and everyone. Emilia Fantasia.
00:44:57.382 - 00:45:24.336, Speaker A: I think we've looked at her work before. I think I actually started with her work one episode. Solace. Emitting sounds of solace by recollapse. Now, this is on bass, and I assume it's relatively new. And this is on foundation. And here you see these two music players and this beautifully painted background here with the shelves and everything.
00:45:24.336 - 00:45:39.492, Speaker A: Just an interesting piece. And these weird masks. Last sold for 0.01 eth, which is probably, what, $30? Pretty cool. Kappa sage on Zora. Mashallah. 17 minted.
00:45:39.492 - 00:46:24.376, Speaker A: So really interesting how we're talking about this on the spaces, how popular Zora is becoming and just how big. It's almost like Zora grew with the free mints on the first, and now they're growing with what seems like base, because there is no obvious platform, I would argue, to mint on, other than Zora, which supported base. And maybe working with warp cast and the popularity of Warpcast also, Zora really kind of making a lot of smart moves here and the collector base, and just there's a lot of people now buying on Zoro. I think their collectors are expanding there too. Anyway, interesting work here from Kappa Sage. Interesting kind of color scheme and everything. Michaela, interesting title.
00:46:24.376 - 00:46:37.852, Speaker A: 17 minted 26 days to go. This is on foundation. This is Melaya. Melaya is the artist. We've looked at some works by Melaya in the past. Love letter number five broke. Aksin actually picked this up for 0.04
00:46:37.852 - 00:46:56.476, Speaker A: eth and let's see if it loads up for us here. It is so very interesting. Original artist here. As you can see, all sorts of stuff going on here. Interesting textures. Not sure if it's a physical or a digital piece. 4800 by 4800 pixels, so maybe digital, but hard to say.
00:46:56.476 - 00:47:15.068, Speaker A: Really interesting artist. And here's Flora Marquez ninja monumento. And this was minted April 18. And an animated drawing by Flora Marquez, edition of one. Let's just see what this went for. Just transferred. So perhaps a commission, who knows? Private deal.
00:47:15.068 - 00:47:38.502, Speaker A: Not sure. Beautiful, isn't it? A beautiful animation here with all of these different versions of this work. And you almost see the work being built, as you can see here, as part of the work. I find this very effective. I find it very, very effective. Just very interesting from Flora Marquez. Here's Gora.
00:47:38.502 - 00:48:01.194, Speaker A: And I'm going to speed up because I'm worried that we're going to have another show that's going to get caught and not only record the audio. Gora with a beautiful drawing here. Love the synths, kind of comic like structure here. Interesting to suggestive. Monster figure, laptop, everything. Great stuff. This is on bass out of the Agora collection auction.
00:48:01.194 - 00:48:22.374, Speaker A: Starting at 0.2 on foundation. So again, works on base. Going for hundreds of dollars is pretty interesting in and of itself. You know, that's a big deal that collectors are starting to spend this kind of money on base. It's a big deal for the base blockchain, of course. Coinbase is L2 on Ethereum debut.
00:48:22.374 - 00:48:45.760, Speaker A: Whoa. Just realized. Music number eight hit 40 mints. Honestly didn't expect this. In a sense, maybe the artbine has simply just moved to base and zora. Like, maybe that's just where all the action is happening, right? So just as a, you know, wondering to myself out loud, so this is on Zora. And again, 40 mints.
00:48:45.760 - 00:49:04.250, Speaker A: Let's just take a quick look here. It almost looks like a physical here. The way it's painted. It's getting harder and harder to tell because sometimes the digital tools are that good. But I suspect this is a physical here. 0.014 eth.
00:49:04.250 - 00:49:16.610, Speaker A: So that's the creator earnings. So I made a mistake, by the way, with capens yesterday. I was. I thought this was the price. It was. It's a free mint. The cap and work and then these are just the earnings, as you can see.
00:49:16.610 - 00:49:33.972, Speaker A: That's pretty cool. It shows the creator earnings for each one. And Debbie T. She's doing incredible. So she did this all twelve followers, nine following. She did this probably just by posting on x and probably maybe warpcast. Right? Cool work as ever.
00:49:33.972 - 00:49:48.740, Speaker A: She's really cool. Artist. Put out that great PFB collection back during the bull run in 2021. Daniel W. Gold. Interesting piece. Kind of looks like a tarot card with the sword and the sun and everything.
00:49:48.740 - 00:50:21.464, Speaker A: Interesting margin here too. Love the square composition and then the rectangle inside, four colors. So kind of a print feeling work and everything. So this sold for edition of one for 55 tazos and looks like same day. So again, art's not doing bad at all, is it? Oxine was just a cool kind of zine work here. Life with some mushrooms, some sanskrit, maybe introduction. Everyone is at a different stage along the path flow.
00:50:21.464 - 00:50:33.468, Speaker A: There's something just kind of fun about this work here. 5000 views. Look at all these retweets. Yeah. So just awesome. Let's continue. Manital meow.
00:50:33.468 - 00:50:57.744, Speaker A: Social. Am I looking cute? So playing off of the Instagram user interface here as you see the slideshow. And there is nirvana in the background and abbey road done in pixel art way. So kind of fun at coffee shop here. And you see all the different. So just a really cool concept here. Five tezos edition of 43.
00:50:57.744 - 00:51:23.116, Speaker A: And looks like sold out. Okay, so it's five tezos on primary or, sorry, on secondary. Continuing on our Friday here. The inspiration also by manital, kind of this comic book format here, I guess three colors, about three or four colors here. This is probably my favorite part here. The paintbrush painting the pixels. Very powerful almost.
00:51:23.116 - 00:51:44.024, Speaker A: It looks like a hakusai wave here. Another kind of reference, visual reference. And the cat looking at the fish in the aquarium. And the other cat here too. I mean, really nice work here, as usual from mandal and p one, I might add, also by p one. Co created and they collaborate a lot. Edition of 30 for three tazos.
00:51:44.024 - 00:52:01.144, Speaker A: Beautiful. This is Chaz. And window of death, only an edition of one. So look at that. Selling to a magician for 144 tezos 22 days ago while I was on vacation there. Nice work. The blue screen of death.
00:52:01.144 - 00:52:16.008, Speaker A: Window of death, as many of you will remember. Shout out to mom. I'm sure mom knows. The BSod, the blue screen of death. And there is the windows operating system crashing. Wow. 144 tazos.
00:52:16.008 - 00:52:35.440, Speaker A: I love it. I mean, again, this market doesn't feel that slow, actually. Maybe slow for the. You know, we got the Cosimo half million dollar sale there for the x copy. It's not even that slow. That was like, what, six weeks ago? Not even. So, kappen, more beautiful work here from KAPn.
00:52:35.440 - 00:52:58.968, Speaker A: Just kind of posting what looks like a drawing on Farcaster here. Ten recasts, two quotes, 48 likes, 200 plus views. I wonder again, I wonder if does anybody get the sense that the traffic is. I'm not sure. And this was also posted slowing down, I wonder, but I could be completely wrong on that. Maybe this is totally normal. Sabato, Newark drawing exercise number 74.
00:52:58.968 - 00:53:22.390, Speaker A: She walks alone in the meadows. Kind of an impressionist looking work. There were things that jumped out at me on this. Look at the sky. This is not typical dithering. This looks like, almost like it's been maybe cycled through a couple of times, a couple of processing things. You see also on the bottom, this kind of what looks like a kind of maze like grid.
00:53:22.390 - 00:53:44.934, Speaker A: And even here, these are not typical pixels here. So I'm not sure if this is pure deluxe paint for or maybe a combination of things. It looks pretty cool, though, this sky. Pretty darn interesting sky. So beautiful work here by Sabato. Again, kind of like. Seems like a homage to a certain degree to impressionism, just with the sunbrella there.
00:53:44.934 - 00:54:06.444, Speaker A: And even, like, the fireflies are what I assume are fireflies. Quite beautifully done. She walks alone in the meadows. Beautiful by Sabato. And look at this. Mika Oladev, artifact number 83. Stopping the animation, really, and pixelating it.
00:54:06.444 - 00:54:37.296, Speaker A: Quite powerful, I would argue. It has its own charm, doesn't it? Very, very, very interesting. Interesting development here. Edition of one, selling for 35 tazos. Again, kind of moving towards a kind of pixel art esque work here from the more glitch esque work. Let's continue again before my computer crashes. Bicycle kick.
00:54:37.296 - 00:54:57.466, Speaker A: So Cansino and I just love this. Maximize on Zora. And I love this work. I love the spirit of this work. The eyes that turn to soccer balls with the bicycle kick. And just, just awesome, the passion here. So how many mints? Only two minted.
00:54:57.466 - 00:55:13.378, Speaker A: So really cool works here by Cansino on Zora. Let's continue. Marcel Muntianu. Just a cool experimental pixel artwork here. Kind of semi abstract composition. Interesting. Just pretty original work.
00:55:13.378 - 00:55:36.784, Speaker A: C 36, the half of the echo. So kind of ambiguous here. Wonderfully ambiguous. Nine tazos edition of one. I mean, again, everything, a lot of these things, almost everything's selling element li, cosmic black box. And so very experimental. The art hasn't slowed down at all again, I have to disagree with Robnis v three here.
00:55:36.784 - 00:56:06.020, Speaker A: What we're seeing here, this is like, again, this is a lot of this is in the last month. That's not that long. And some of it's like, this one's yesterday, could be today, for all I know. Like I. That I saw it. So there is so much interesting things going on here from, I would argue, an art perspective on, you know, back to dan control from an innovation perspective. There is so much going on here and like, what is this? I love the ambiguity.
00:56:06.020 - 00:56:22.686, Speaker A: I mean, it almost looks like a microwave, but maybe it's a newspaper, maybe it's a drawing table. I don't know what it is. Is it a website? I don't know. Here's another super interesting work, deep field. I love the animation by. This is Kyle Flemmer. I'm pretty sure we'll check in a second.
00:56:22.686 - 00:56:52.952, Speaker A: But I think is using the tiling, if I'm not mistaken, to make these. You see the stars repeating here, this pattern of stars. Quite a brilliant use of the tiling and aspirate deep field. So referring to Hubble. Now, there's the new one. What is the new Hubble? It's called something else, if I'm not mistaken. So all to say deep field, 3200 frames, 400 by 400, upscaled.
00:56:52.952 - 00:57:16.284, Speaker A: So this one was burned, but there's probably another addition. And here it is. Two minute animation inspired by the Hubble telescope. Deep field images. It's a large, inexpensive edition because I love it very much and want everybody to be able to have it if they want it. So how cool is that? KF. And here's also a still edition of one.
00:57:16.284 - 00:57:31.770, Speaker A: And what are they selling for? You gotta love it. Not listed yet. That's when you know the artist likes it. They're in no hurry to list it. As far as I know, one of four unique regions of Deepfield. These are beautiful. I love space as a subject.
00:57:31.770 - 00:57:59.698, Speaker A: I've done a little bit with that space Odyssey series, you know, Max Ernst, as far as I remember, at the end of his career, was saying space is one of the great subject matters that are unexplored in painting. Interestingly, if I remember right, I mean, it's been quite a few years. Here's another one by Kyle Flemmer. A glitch. Rom transmit error. How quite a beautiful one. Love the all so many things about this.
00:57:59.698 - 00:58:17.538, Speaker A: The upside down earth or the earth from below. The glitching, the subject, everything. The animation, the glitching, everything. Edition of 15 looks like it's sold out, sold out at a Tezos 50. Life is good. Life is good. In the blockchain here for selling your art.
00:58:17.538 - 00:58:50.918, Speaker A: Still one of devouring digital deities. I mean, look at how much enthusiasm there's, you know, a description of our newest one of one collection from Kit Velo and collect from Kit Velo. And perhaps a succinct summary of his digital practice. This piece, VCR sx. A pixelated but not too pixelated gradient that's oh so creamy. Collecting categories, gradients, glitch, mind maps, pixel art. So very interesting work here by Kit Velo, who seems to use some tiling or at least some repetition of patterning in the works.
00:58:50.918 - 00:59:20.064, Speaker A: And here's the work by Retro Manny I was telling you about. Let me maximize this. A wonderful, wonderful work here. Even like the soft kind of color filter. Retro Manny, I need a. Yeah, I need this. Like, you know, and sign your name on it, you know, like that's awesome.
00:59:20.064 - 00:59:40.308, Speaker A: It's totally awesome. Beautiful GM, fellow aliens. Nice work Manny. Here's Lorna Mills on warpcast. Really interesting one. So a nature work kind of looks like a sunset from the sky, from a plane. And look at these wild, this wild masking here.
00:59:40.308 - 01:00:00.748, Speaker A: This one feels a little different, doesn't it? For those that are familiar with Lorna Mills work. Beautiful, very beautiful work. So cool work by Lorna Mills. Again on warpcast. Drain cane just found this artist on x. I don't know who posted it or if it just showed up in my feed. I think I found it on someone else's.
01:00:00.748 - 01:00:21.104, Speaker A: I don't know if it was Sabato's feed or someone else's feed. Maybe it was Sabato's feed. So all to say, pretty cool work here, pretty original. And here is another one. Who is this again? This is Kenji. And at first I thought this is waffles. I don't think this is waffles.
01:00:21.104 - 01:00:39.414, Speaker A: This is someone else. This is someone called Kenji. And. Yeah, so just a really interesting kind of like video animation, abstract animation, you know, of sorts. Auction starting at 0.1. Snow and cobalt. So again, this is just to remind you, this is someone called Kenji.
01:00:39.414 - 01:01:01.698, Speaker A: Cool artist. And this is a really cool one. Javier Montero. I think I found this on warpcast. Maybe, maybe it was Kappin who had posted this. Really cool. Interesting work, isn't it? And even just the masking and this gray and then the fuzzy gradient, these gradients cycling through here, the composition.
01:01:01.698 - 01:01:18.850, Speaker A: Why is it at the bottom? And why do we have this space on top? But I love it. Seven tezos now on secondary. Incredible selling out at one tezos. You know, people are getting money for their art. I love it. And here's just another interesting one. Who is this? Nikopu.
01:01:18.850 - 01:01:31.584, Speaker A: Niko. P. Sorry. Late humans were living in caves made from single use plastics. P. Five js, Arduino, Photoshop, and coffee pods. And those look like coffee pods, don't they? So just wild work here.
01:01:31.584 - 01:01:52.004, Speaker A: Lots of experimentation and innovation, as dan control is pointing out. Angel Kelchan. This is May 8, so a new one from. Is this murepixel? And I want to say this is suicidios or something, but I could be wrong. Let's just go with what's here. Murray. Pixel.
01:01:52.004 - 01:02:11.602, Speaker A: So we've seen some work by this very experimental artist before. Kind of like anime, kind of pixelated. Is it AI? Combination of all of the above. Very cool. Six minted, 28 days to go. Very interesting work. And here is Lexdoom art with a cool work.
01:02:11.602 - 01:02:22.574, Speaker A: A skull. A classic subject in crypto art. Death by a thousand pixels. Awesome title. This is from 2023, actually. And here are just some big, chunky pixels. Nice piece.
01:02:22.574 - 01:02:52.700, Speaker A: And then the still, I found out. The reason, at least I have a theory, is the reason why we see this very often. The still work in the second frame is because if you just load up your. You have to do a movie, not a gif, as far as I understand, on Instagram, because I've tried it, and I don't think you can do a gif. So you do a movie, but then if you do a movie, it turns into a reel, so automatically. So what you have to do is make it a slideshow. So then you put in your movie, and then you put in your still afterwards.
01:02:52.700 - 01:03:09.734, Speaker A: And then it keeps it as just a movie. That's not a reel. I think that's why it's happening. But you know what? Fortuitous circumstance. Because I quite like actually having both. And it shows the difference. Like, I find it just visually interesting.
01:03:09.734 - 01:03:29.034, Speaker A: Haiti Rockette with some awesome glitch roms since I've been gone. Deadline. Great title. And look at this beauty that is here. And we see some kind of old school video game elements here going up and down these old spaceships, and what looks like an intro screen. Just awesome. Beautiful color.
01:03:29.034 - 01:03:46.742, Speaker A: What's going on here? Three sold at 13 tezos each. Kurt hussle collective among them. Edition of six. Nice. Low edition. Here's another one. Again, kind of like this maximal work here with the letters turning into the what I think you'd call hexadecimals.
01:03:46.742 - 01:03:56.090, Speaker A: And just beautiful. Nice and minimal. Not trying to do too much. Very, very effective and cool. Beautiful. Great color. Sword of justice.
01:03:56.090 - 01:04:13.602, Speaker A: Love it. And threesold. And here, some experimentation, seemingly, I think. But maybe this is just not sure how this is done, to be honest. Free memory, 33 tezos, still available. Edition of six. Maybe that's on secondary.
01:04:13.602 - 01:04:33.486, Speaker A: Listed by Akira Dice for 33. So interesting experiments going on here, seemingly. Experiments from Haiti, Rockette. And one more. Want to do something? This is an edition of ten and several selling at 13 tezos. Again, the art is selling here. Beautiful.
01:04:33.486 - 01:04:53.064, Speaker A: Look at this. Nice long animation. Reminds me kf with that two minute gif. Was that a Gif or a video? I'm not sure. Look how long. This is amazing. I mean, this is like a 2030 2nd GiF, I think.
01:04:53.064 - 01:05:04.868, Speaker A: Very cool. Love the hearts. Here's Silva Santu. Another glitch. Rom artist blinking with some beautiful work. Kind of looks like a welcome screen, 1990 at the bottom there. And just cool.
01:05:04.868 - 01:05:27.894, Speaker A: Different elements here with the eyes and the text and the broken, you know, the glitching and everything. Condition of four. And here's another one. Glitchtown arcade with this big kind of margin here, which is really interesting way of doing it. Almost like a passepartout of sorts. And then just kind of noise. Just information noise.
01:05:27.894 - 01:05:45.004, Speaker A: Very cool. And here is Kiro. Maybe grd flow. Not exactly sure on the title there. Just another minimal. Cool. You see the video layer here of glitching with the glitch underneath.
01:05:45.004 - 01:06:14.826, Speaker A: I think Kiro might be doing, if I'm not mistaken, might be doing hardware glitching, not software. I think I, you know, need to confirm with him, but I think that's what I think. He messaged me, or we were messaging, and I think that might be what came up. I'll have to confirm on that one. Electrostatic acrylic. This is doctor version with kind of a different take on these frames here. When I'm loosely calling frames and just cool colors and everything.
01:06:14.826 - 01:06:31.202, Speaker A: Just an interesting abstract here. This is an edition of 33 for two tezos. Two gone. Sky Goodman and connect doom. Two good collectors there. And gone's with the one of one that went to burst. The coolest exchange, glitch abstract artwork made.
01:06:31.202 - 01:06:48.262, Speaker A: Mixing code. And again, I gotta speed through this so we don't crash here and lose everything. Look at how cool this is. So this is gons. Very nice. And here's Nicholas Assun with a couple of works. This one's posted on Twitter.
01:06:48.262 - 01:07:01.386, Speaker A: Slab 29. So slab 49. This is 2022 work. And what about this one? So a hollow sphere. And not sure if this is new or old. Also, Nicholas Sassoon. Very interesting piece.
01:07:01.386 - 01:07:29.914, Speaker A: And here is back to Kiro with these very interesting minimal video paintings, as we called them in the show that totally got glitched out before I left there. So, Kronos. Interesting piece. Here's another one. Nice and minimal ripple. There's something to be said for minimalism, isn't there? It really just kind of focuses on like, the soul of the glitch here. Very cool work.
01:07:29.914 - 01:07:47.738, Speaker A: This is on bass. Not sure. Last sold for selling 0.143. I mean, 0.0143. So, I mean, pretty good. And this is the thing. You can sell for 30 or $40 on base because your fees are like a penny makes a difference, right? And you're still like, on a.
01:07:47.738 - 01:08:22.022, Speaker A: I mean, this is quite. This thing that's happening with base could be phenomenal for artists because many ETh collectors or people that collect art on the blockchain for whatever reason, maybe the wallet or don't collect on tazos, but they seem to be collecting on base. And so all of a sudden you can almost open up that very low fee situation. And Zora and foundation seem to be totally capitalizing on coinbases, on base, on this layer. Two. Very interesting tank. This kind of reminded me of like a Rauschenberg or something.
01:08:22.022 - 01:08:47.932, Speaker A: Again, like a. It's almost like got this pop art, abstract expressionist sort of thing with the cloth hanging from the wall. But it's a video glitch, I think, just conceptually. Interesting. Cool experiment from Kiro here. And here's another one, also from Kiro, I believe only Kiro or owned by Kiro. I think by Kiro as well, if I'm not mistaken.
01:08:47.932 - 01:09:03.966, Speaker A: This is called Renvok. Just another interesting experiment here. So beautiful work here. Love the minimalism. Quite effective auction at 0.0143. And maybe that's helping the art, too. If I bid on the auction, it cost me $0.10
01:09:03.966 - 01:09:31.373, Speaker A: or a penny rather than $30. I mean, it makes a huge difference. I notice eth gas fees, you know, a little reward for those who are still watching. ETH gas fees are getting very low. Like five is like the one I saw this morning. Even four on the EtH gas meter for, you know, to be in the weeds, for those that know what I'm talking about, that's very low. Even bitcoin is at like, the mempool is at like 17 or 18.
01:09:31.373 - 01:10:09.404, Speaker A: That's pretty low as far as the fees and also the tokens are taking a hit. So I'll just say if you want to mint on the main chain right now because everything's happening on base, I may put the rest of my peloponnesian war series because these are because I couldn't afford. I put only a. A quarter of it and then the price went up and the gas went up and then I couldn't mint the rest. I may mint the rest now on ETH as 721. So anyways, here is, as I try and speed up here, Renki, look at all this noise. Look at all this interesting noise and innovation and experimentation, to quote Dan control.
01:10:09.404 - 01:10:24.684, Speaker A: Hatsushima. Very cool. And a few by Klaus here, number 195 of the compositions. So really nice. Again, slow piece, interesting color. Here's 201. Very fun piece collected by Somfei.
01:10:24.684 - 01:10:51.704, Speaker A: Beautiful. And here is score as we start approaching the end of this show here. So just beautiful work by score as usual. And the animation, the touch designer, the 3d scanning and the shine, was that the kirakira, if I'm not mistaken. And the cat. Look at this cat. Just awesome, awesome, awesome cat.
01:10:51.704 - 01:11:19.654, Speaker A: And, well, at a temple in Tokyo. 3D Scan scaniverse Touch designer Adobe 3D scan scanniverse, 1920 by 1080, fits a tv perfectly. Brilliant nine minted so far on Zora. And here is psycho futurist. $100 million or a chance to go through the funny door. Another kind of wild kind of technological themed work here from psycho futurist who does all these kind of very Sci-Fi esque works here. Look at the sky there.
01:11:19.654 - 01:11:44.156, Speaker A: Wild artist. And here is Pablo Radice. True face with some more super interesting looking, almost looking like an italian renaissance composition, but made out of AI elements here. Great AI artist apuntas Veneziano's notes of Venice. Very cool. And here is Santiago. This is what I did on mid journey.
01:11:44.156 - 01:12:10.272, Speaker A: Yeah, so all sorts of, I mean, booming, I would argue this is, you know, this is the opposite of actually boring, in my opinion. And shout out to Robnis V three, who has showed up on the spaces and is just a generally good dude. But I do disagree. This is not a boring space right now. Let's continue Skomra with a cool work, of course. Again, thanks for the portrait there at the start. Look how cool this is.
01:12:10.272 - 01:12:25.480, Speaker A: So interesting textures here, interesting color, interesting subject. Tree in a landscape. And here's botto. Look at how much this is going for. This is a pretty big sale. I saw this just on the front page of superart. Going for $34,000.
01:12:25.480 - 01:12:47.194, Speaker A: The auction is not over yet. And again, this is, as far as I understand, AI created by community. So interesting AI, you know, so art directed by a community. So this is the experiment here on the blockchain. Nice piece. Scattered descriptions on cellular canvas. Cool title.
01:12:47.194 - 01:13:10.060, Speaker A: So it's kind of hilarious actually, to hear, to see how people are, how a community makes art. Intricate communication. So here's Okote, who is doing fabulous there on Instagram 91. Minted on Zora. So doing well here too. Pretty cool work. This kind of techno shamanism definitely is hitting the right note there.
01:13:10.060 - 01:13:33.184, Speaker A: So just awesome to see Okote. Boom. I mean, that's the beauty of this space. You can labor for years in the traditional art world and an entire career with nobody really caring here. You keep hitting, you keep hitting and boom. Basically you go viral, right? Here's Ilay with some cool workfish friends. Very nice AI artworks here.
01:13:33.184 - 01:13:43.504, Speaker A: AI paintings. Just a couple from this series. Fish friends number seven. So beautiful work. I think Uksin picked. I think it was this one, if not the other. Look at the great textures here.
01:13:43.504 - 01:14:00.702, Speaker A: I mean, it's pretty incredible what's going on. Was it this one? Yeah, Uksin picked up this one. So nice work there. And here's another one by Santiago. This is beautiful. I think this is AI, like 99% sure. And look at this wonderful landscape here.
01:14:00.702 - 01:14:19.810, Speaker A: Beautifully painted. Novel imagery. Novel painting. Here's Kynik Zapata. Like, what is going on here in such a great way? Kind of looks like a video game or something else. I don't know what this is. Glitch artist has been around doing glitch for years, as far as I understand.
01:14:19.810 - 01:14:41.832, Speaker A: Look at these great outlines here. Really doing wild AI playing ball. How much is this going for? Only six tazos. Santiago buying it. A small community. Still, for those that are maybe watching, artists that may be watching who are interested, there is time. This, you know, and maybe it never, you know, goes super huge, but it's a great place to be, let's put it this way.
01:14:41.832 - 01:15:05.640, Speaker A: One of one picked this one up at the park edition of one. Again, just wonderful experimentation here by Canix Zapata. And here's one more by Canic Zapatai. Little cakes picking this one up. The person interviewed at the start there collected this Kanek Zapata, one of one from the collection. There are still a few others if you take a look. Very, very interesting AI artwork.
01:15:05.640 - 01:15:25.644, Speaker A: And here's Moe. Moe shit. Who again went like, just posts a ton of work. And I think we just looked, was it? 8000 followers. Mo has now on Twitter and often posting these kind of AI artworks with kind of a textile feel to them. Medieval times. Very interesting.
01:15:25.644 - 01:15:36.470, Speaker A: You can be the first to mint. Mo puts out a ton of work. I love the title on that. It's like the name of a file. The God of small things. This is by Bayan. Just saw this.
01:15:36.470 - 01:15:59.398, Speaker A: I think it's a fashion designer on x. Or someone was saying, looks like AI fashion. If I had to guess. Maybe it's a photo of the fashion. So maybe that's a real model. It's getting hard to tell, isn't it? So how many? Eight minted so far. The God of small things, like Zora, weirdly, could be the platform that goes mainstream.
01:15:59.398 - 01:16:12.954, Speaker A: Weirdly, you know, it might not be as we expect it goes. Maybe that's how it happens into the physicals. He man. Great. I love it. Of course, this is he man. Really rough.
01:16:12.954 - 01:16:33.770, Speaker A: It just goes to show, like, you don't need to have some perfectly realistic work here. Kind of effective, kind of, you know, neo expressionist, as they'd say. And here's die with the most likes. Hell is real. Look how beautifully painted this is. The h is different. Just the die with the most likes has made a ton of works and it shows.
01:16:33.770 - 01:16:47.864, Speaker A: It really shows. This is beautiful. So I won't read that. I won't read that comment there. Continuing on, sisin e pa ben. This is my good friend Ben, out of. Out of Berlin here.
01:16:47.864 - 01:17:08.860, Speaker A: Does a lot of memes. And I thought this was a brilliant painting, of course, of aphex twin oil on canvas, 40 by 40. And does the water based oil paint, which I find very fitting. I also offer commissions who want to see their face on this. So awesome. And here's another by walk, meant for free, of course. Maggie Simpson.
01:17:08.860 - 01:17:26.816, Speaker A: Look at how, again, virtuoso. A virtuoso performance here of portrait of Maggie Simpson. Stunning. Stunning work. I need to see if walk wants to come on the space. Wow. Like, that's just stunning.
01:17:26.816 - 01:17:49.242, Speaker A: Here's demon ego listed on our Zora. So it looks like a physical work, doesn't it? Or mostly physical, at least. So beautiful work there. And here's an artist we were looking at. Provence connection. I feel just a beautiful label, and I feel like this is maybe an artist that I was following, but maybe not. Maybe it's just a beautiful label there.
01:17:49.242 - 01:18:04.882, Speaker A: We look at everything here. Kayla Mattis. So, of course, the text, what do you call it? Textile artist. The weaver, I believe you'd say. And just a couple of raccoons. This small meme study, it's a study I love. It is included in a group show.
01:18:04.882 - 01:18:19.256, Speaker A: Small scale opening. How cool. And there's a lot to be said for working small. I just went to a massive MC Escher show, by the way, in Rome. Over 300 works. It was like retrospective. You know, there's something to be said.
01:18:19.256 - 01:18:42.016, Speaker A: I took a lot of pictures, actually. You know, the way you do something small and make it look important is you put a huge passepartout on it. Put a big, nice big passepartout or frame, and that's how you make it look important. So small's cool. There's a lot to be said for small. Babichi Metea is getting incredibly experimental. This is from 2021.
01:18:42.016 - 01:18:58.584, Speaker A: So this is dinobot. Yeah. So I guess this is an older one, but just posted. And here is another one. This is from 2024. The wolf in the story. So getting super experimental kind of looks like a fairy tale, maybe.
01:18:58.584 - 01:19:20.058, Speaker A: And there's the wolf and Hansel and little Red Riding Hood. Or who knows, maybe a princess. Wild work. Wild, wild work. Here's Moto Motohiro with just a drawing, which is incredibly charming. And here's Steven Schwarzer with another Rizzo print. Let's hopefully, I'm pretty sure.
01:19:20.058 - 01:19:37.794, Speaker A: Yeah. So this is one of Steven Schwarzer's drawings turned into Rizzo. I don't think we can get this any bigger, unfortunately. Yeah, that's about as big. But it's rizoprint, so, you know, the poor person. Screen printing. We looked at a work by Stefan last show as well that you saw there.
01:19:37.794 - 01:19:55.332, Speaker A: Adam Lister studio. So let me just make sure this is okay. So look at how small this is. Adam Lister studio. And here is Snoopy. And this is three by four inches. So you see how the hand here, how tiny this is.
01:19:55.332 - 01:20:21.414, Speaker A: It's this beautiful watercolor painting. So there's really a lot to be said for working small. Look at that. Delightful. And finally, it's not gallery Brock Sanders with this awesome, awesome work here. Again, I think it's not gallery focuses on the airbrush, if I understand correctly. And just a beautiful, simple work here with the japanese or korean writing at the bottom.
01:20:21.414 - 01:20:32.354, Speaker A: Super rad. Thank you, everybody who's made it this far. And thank you, if you didn't. Thank you for joining me once again, and I hope you have a wonderful weekend. Happy Friday. Until next time, take care.
