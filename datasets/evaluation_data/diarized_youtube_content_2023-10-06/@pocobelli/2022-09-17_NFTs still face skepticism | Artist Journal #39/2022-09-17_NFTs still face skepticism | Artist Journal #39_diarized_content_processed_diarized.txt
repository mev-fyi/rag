00:00:09.760 - 00:00:53.668, Speaker A: Artist journal, September 17, 2022, Berlin. My name is Adrian Pokebelli, your artist reporter, digital and in real life, checking out the happenings. Middle of Berlin Art Week here's pretty interesting. I mean, there's a healthy skepticism of nfts in our whole digital art scene here, by the way. Yeah, I don't know if you guys saw that Artnet article. I didn't even bother covering it because it kind of just seemed like a hater. But yeah, Artnet just trashing the whole NFT thing.
00:00:53.668 - 00:01:25.582, Speaker A: Like, what's funny is it seems pretty clear to me that they're just thinking of Ethereum and like, the bored ape yacht club and thinking it kind of starts and ends with that. And maybe they haven't seen Rak cloak see's, you know, work. Let's just bring it up. You know what? They have no idea who ratcloksy is. And then we'll come back to Gabriel Tessarev. But yeah, no kings, no masters. There's an important.
00:01:25.582 - 00:02:04.204, Speaker A: Remember all these decapitated heads? Let's just see. Here it is. So I'm not exactly sure what's going on here, but all I know is there's a bored ape head on a pillow here with our Hannibal Lecter guys and everything crazy that's going on. I'll never forget the first time I saw this. I was like, this is terrifying. So back to where we were. So all to say, it's the.
00:02:04.204 - 00:02:42.796, Speaker A: It's skeptical out there. Okay. Like, nobody was overly direct about it, but you can kind of tell that I think people have. And just like that article, which I'm not going to bother covering because it was pretty low quality, in my opinion. Yeah. Like, there's just people think it's dead, which is actually super bullish in a certain sort of way because the fact that we have so much going on here, I would argue it kind of just, again, I think it's just more. It's good to be the underdog, let's put it this way.
00:02:42.796 - 00:03:16.558, Speaker A: And if we have this many great artists and we're still the underdog, and let me tell you, having gone to. I went to a couple of art openings yesterday at Max Hetzler, and I'll actually show you the pictures and we can discuss that after, actually. But I'm just saying the excitement's over here. Okay. It was pretty clear to me, going to the art fair yesterday. The excitement is definitely over here in terms of the actual images. That's not to put down any other images in the so called real or traditional art world.
00:03:16.558 - 00:03:46.430, Speaker A: I'm just saying, the excitement, the energy, clearly over here. Okay, so here we are. So hilarious piece here by Gabriel Tessarev, who pretty sure Gabriel is a she and she does a lot of kind of cake work. And I think this is a really hilarious piece here. Again, back to this kind of retro theme. We saw it in the game, boys. We see it in the three and a half inch diskettes.
00:03:46.430 - 00:04:07.702, Speaker A: We sometimes see it in old monitors. Just kind of a prevalent theme in the digital art space. And so you see, here's some of her other work, black forest cake. Pretty nicely rendered. And you might think, well, this isn't my typical imagery. You might think to yourself, I just picked up this one of one. I couldn't believe it.
00:04:07.702 - 00:04:25.390, Speaker A: You know, this is. I have a weird story on this because I bought this a month ago when it came out for eleven. And I bought it like as soon as it was minted, I just happened to see it. I was like, oh, I love this person's work. I'm gonna buy this really cool one of one. She asked me to send it back and so I was like, no problem. And totally understand.
00:04:25.390 - 00:04:45.714, Speaker A: Here it is. You see that? And then she sent me the money and then it went, I think, to a friend or the collaborator. And now it's back up for sale, 31 August. I never even saw that. So I was just going through her page and I was like, oh, it's for sale. I'll buy it. So let's see if she wants it back.
00:04:45.714 - 00:05:20.382, Speaker A: But I was more than happy to get a second chance at getting this one of one. So anyway, really fun work. Some of them move. This is a really nice one. So you might think again, like, okay, you know, subject matter of cakes, maybe you might think to yourself, not your thing, but there is great precedent for this with the work. I think this is really nice with the work of Wayne Thibode, who is a pretty well known pop artist. Again, not a household name like Jasper Johns or Andy Warhol might be, but pretty up there.
00:05:20.382 - 00:05:48.534, Speaker A: And you see, I mean, when I see Gabriel's work, you know, I just think of Wayne Thibaud and he's, you know, very kind of famous for his works. Nice. You know, so there's kind of a nice precedent for it. I'm not, I assume Gabriel knows his work, but she might not. She might not. I mean, it's not like, again, he's a household name or anything. So just wanted to touch on her and that kind of retro theme.
00:05:48.534 - 00:06:13.274, Speaker A: Moving on, kind of interesting illustrator I discovered yesterday on Twitter his work was going around. Louis Mort, don't sacrifice now for an imaginary tomorrow again illustration. Looks like digital edition of ten. Are these sold out? No. So just kind of fresh on the market here. Minted yesterday. Pretty nice work, if you ask me.
00:06:13.274 - 00:06:40.262, Speaker A: So just wanted to touch on that. Here's another one. If you go to Louis Mort's page, you will see just these last two are in this style. And I could see this being quite popular. You see an evolution. It's always another great thing about this is better than an artist website object because you just, there's no b's. There's no, you just see the evolution of an artist's work.
00:06:40.262 - 00:06:57.070, Speaker A: So it's pretty great. So anyway, here's another one. It looks slightly lower resolution. And this is also evolution. This is what happens sometimes. You make work that's lower resolution and you go, okay, that was good, but need to increase the resolution. So did really well.
00:06:57.070 - 00:07:22.518, Speaker A: This last one sold out for five the day before that. So September 15, and now selling for 120. Last sale was five. So kind of cool work. Nice, you know, new work by Heidi Rockette, who we were looking at, I think yesterday, maybe the day before. And this goes back to. Okay, so here we got the retro theme again.
00:07:22.518 - 00:07:46.910, Speaker A: Basically a Windows 95, and basically a spiraling kind of algorithm here with more Windows 95 elements being moved around by cursors. Old computer, old laptop, this sort of thing. Some hearts. So classic. I mean, this goes back to some of his older work. I brought it up here. You see this diskette, the floppy disk.
00:07:46.910 - 00:08:16.284, Speaker A: This is from April 24, 2021. So this is old Haiti roquette work here. So going back to one of his earlier series. And again, like, I'm all for that, you know, like, I do that all the time. Again, I have about seven or eight series that I like just going back to and exploring. Sometimes I'll stick with it for two months. Sometimes it's work in the morning on one and then go to a different series in the afternoon.
00:08:16.284 - 00:08:44.320, Speaker A: And I think there's nothing wrong with that. That's actually kind of normal. So anyways, and back to that retro theme. It's almost like the theme of the episode here so far. Let's see where it goes. Heart of deep blue. I believe Deep Blue was the chess, the name of the chess computer that beat, I think, Kasparov, the first kind of AI chess computer or computer that beat a world champion chess player.
00:08:44.320 - 00:09:14.332, Speaker A: So what is the title of this? Heart of Deep Blue by Popol. And now Popol's been doing slightly different work. He's been working with these vertical lines here. So slightly different from that kind of bitmap. One pixel on, one pixel off, or just kind of bitmappy, for lack of better term gradations. So slightly different styles, slightly different palette. We have kind of a purple and red, violet purple.
00:09:14.332 - 00:09:40.254, Speaker A: And again, he's got that generative art mixed with pixel art. So pretty cool work. This came out yesterday, I believe, September 16, 17th. So, yeah, yesterday. And, you know, along this kind of. You see the palette, he's experimenting with this violet and red and blue palette. And the Sci-Fi theme continues in a slightly different way.
00:09:40.254 - 00:10:14.306, Speaker A: And again, you see that vertical pixel, so almost a different kind of screen filter, for lack of better term. And again, so just kind of cool series. Again, you got the generative art mixing with the pixel art. And of course, this one with the wizard. Not sure exactly where he's going with this. Maybe it's just experimentation. Seems to be experimentation to me, but very interesting and continuing on, feels put out a few works.
00:10:14.306 - 00:10:52.110, Speaker A: And this is someone who I'd been following, I think, from very early on, like in February, and I hadn't seen a mint for a long time. And then I just thought this was kind of interesting. Abstract, I call this animated abstract is the category I put this in, and the genres of digital art, which I promised to get to very soon once I'm not drinking the night before, you know, give me a couple of days. And I'm kind of done with this whole Berlin art week thing. So I'm ready to. I'm ready to kind of take it to the. Ready to just like, chill out, work, do my thing.
00:10:52.110 - 00:11:06.234, Speaker A: Here's another one by feels. So just kind of interesting. Kind of depressing titles a little bit. If you let me just. I think I need to fix. Here we go. A little bit of a depressing title.
00:11:06.234 - 00:11:18.214, Speaker A: Let me see here. Come down. That's not so bad. The other one, depression. Reach out. So maybe feels is trying to tell us something, but feels is making sales. Look at that.
00:11:18.214 - 00:11:32.054, Speaker A: 100. 3130. My God. Well, I hope that helps cure your depression. That sure would cure mine. That's phenomenal. So 130.
00:11:32.054 - 00:11:51.494, Speaker A: That's crazy. Like, so you see, these are 132. So, you know, I didn't notice that when I loaded these up for the first time. So this is from a month ago. This is an edition of eleven. I really like this piece. We're going to look at the sales history here, too.
00:11:51.494 - 00:12:19.936, Speaker A: You see, like, someone who I think has been around for a while, let's just look at offer 150 74. So extremely strong market here. Accepted offers from 200 to 130 was the cheapest. Pretty amazing. Pretty amazing. Just goes to show, like, once you get your market on this platform, it's pretty sweet. Speaking of markets, this beautiful, beautiful piece by rat cloak.
00:12:19.936 - 00:12:40.960, Speaker A: See, again, one of my favorite, if not my favorite, in this entire series. It had a good day. There's a bit of a bidding war at the end. And sold for 165 tezos, so I think the last highest was 320, so. But very respectable. I think it's around the second highest for rat cloaksee on this series. So congratulations to him.
00:12:40.960 - 00:13:05.884, Speaker A: That was September 15. Uh, this is an interesting artist who I've just been kind of seeing here and there. I think it pronounces it geek. Um, kind of has this weird sort of eye thing going on on a lot of these works with the l, you see the eyes kind of trademark thing. And, uh, yeah, I think he's been around for a couple of months here. Let's just look at the oldest. Look at that.
00:13:05.884 - 00:13:21.412, Speaker A: Look at where he starts with the myth. Ambition. Nice title. A piece inspired by El Mito, the myth. So. And there's the lemonhead myth there. So isn't that amazing? We're kind of back to the culture here.
00:13:21.412 - 00:13:43.194, Speaker A: Nice start, geek. So I like that last piece. I think this kind of has a bit of a contemporary art museum feel to it. You got the murakami on the clothing, murakami flowers, and just kind of at a stoplight. I like it. It's poetic. And so I thought, worth just pointing to here.
00:13:43.194 - 00:14:17.284, Speaker A: What else do we have? Kurt hussle collective has released a work. Gotta be careful with Kurt Hussle collective to not miss. I think these are going to be burned soon. And sometimes the way it works is you buy that first piece, and then you get a whole bunch of other stuff, or you'll get another piece. So here's a postcard from what looks like a new series, moon hopping with Teddy Tardigrade. Always creative, always funny with JNK and Terry, visual hustle collective. So that's going for one tezos.
00:14:17.284 - 00:14:35.864, Speaker A: So again, I think they're being burned, so you might want to get it while you can, if you're a fan. Some interesting AI artwork by Venta. So we looked at a work by Venta yesterday. I think it's. Did I load it up? Yes. So we looked at this yesterday. So here comes another one.
00:14:35.864 - 00:15:10.930, Speaker A: And, yeah, like, I mean, pretty impressive, right? And as I was at Berlin Art week here and going to different galleries and different, you know, the fair. I didn't see anything that I'd recognize as AI art. And we've kind of paid a lot of attention. Like, I think I would have at least a suspicion, be able to recognize what might be AI art, and I didn't see any. And here we're kind of like, you're gonna see. I have a few more. I think the rest of this show is almost AI art, and I'm not trying to find it.
00:15:10.930 - 00:15:31.346, Speaker A: Like, it's the stuff that's turning my head. That's what I talk about here. Just stuff that's turning my head. It's not stuff that's better or worse may not even be my thing. I haven't bought most of these things, okay, but just stuff that's worthy of mentioning, in a sense, from whatever I see. Again, not a news channel here. So, interesting work.
00:15:31.346 - 00:16:08.810, Speaker A: The flower snatchers, venta times AI. And I also want to point this out. Like, if you look at these older works here, these aren't using AI. And so you see the AI transformation here for Venta and how all of a sudden, it's turning, like, these pretty, from kind of digital paint experiments that are pretty interesting, too. Like, you know, if you saw this in a contemporary art museum, I don't know about you, but I went, think twice. Okay? I'd be like, yeah, that belongs here. That looks interesting.
00:16:08.810 - 00:16:38.034, Speaker A: Same with this. This looks even better, you know, the flower snatchers. I'd go, yeah, that looks like work that's coming out right now. And it came out two days ago. So interesting. Right now, let's just look at the market here. Yeah, so, selling for five, and then accept offer of so 30, 1510 smaller edition.
00:16:38.034 - 00:17:05.374, Speaker A: Mikey Wilson, Yuri Clownvamp, and Clownvamp, I brought up his page, or clownvamps page because. Because he is. I'd call. I think you could call him or clownvamp, a patron of AI he has first. He makes a lot of AI work. And I brought up this donut work here. And I want to point out something here.
00:17:05.374 - 00:17:44.784, Speaker A: First of all, raw joy. So the word raw. And then this little write up, all visual generation and manipulation, including upscaling and sharpening done by AI. No human post processing. And this kind of triggered something in my brain of, as we kind of go on our process of discovery with AI, which, again, was completely unpresent in the Berlin art week from so far, from. From what I've seen, I'm sure there's something out there, I imagine. But this was fascinating here no human post processing, as if that that might be a bad thing.
00:17:44.784 - 00:18:52.564, Speaker A: Like, remember I was talking about strange things work, and I was going how I really like how there's edits, because then it kind of adds that human element and that it kind of meets halfway, and it's not just pressing a button, but clownvamp, who I think is very deep in this AI business. It's almost like there's a value that is being kind of stated here, which is, the less human the better, which is a very interesting idea. So I think, again, we have to be very open minded about how we approach this AI thing and, you know, listen to the artists. Right? And so here is a work by clown vamp, and where he turned donuts to clouds. And this probably would have been a lot harder to do in, you know, just manually selling for a pretty penny here at 20,000 tezos. And let's continue here. So, okay, there was a work.
00:18:52.564 - 00:19:30.986, Speaker A: Let me just bring this up. So there was a work here that I want to point it out before we get to that one, which is a work by zero zero nine. Again, edition of 1000 that sold out. Kind of what I want to almost call an archetypal image of the blob coming out of a subway. So kind of like, I feel like I've seen images like this before. Anyway, this one hit with a lot of people, sold out at 75 Tez, and now has been, you know, what's the last sale? 98. 98.
00:19:30.986 - 00:20:05.204, Speaker A: So people are still buying it. So just like Thuglord is blowing up your notifications. If you own Thuglord, if you own last stop by Triple Zero nine, you can expect that to probably blow up your notifications. So again, great pr doing these editions of 1000 that people like and then selling them cheap. I mean, you're just going to be out there getting free advertising for a while. And there's also a collaboration. If you go to triple zero nine's.
00:20:05.204 - 00:20:37.932, Speaker A: Org. Let's just quickly visit. Yeah, you can see here there's a collaboration with strange thing and what I used to call Redrum, but I think it's redrum because everything that redrum does is red. And what do we have here? La resistance, done in strange things. Classic numbers in the title. And what we see here is the thug lord, or whatever we want to call him, character. And then the blob, and then Redrum's trademark red landscapes.
00:20:37.932 - 00:21:04.994, Speaker A: Now, another AI work, right? AI surrealism. Look at this price. 625 tezos. That sold for, I think, on secondary. No primary, not sure. But anyway, sold for 625 tazos. So they have to be pretty happy with that thousand bucks.
00:21:04.994 - 00:21:39.144, Speaker A: Now, if we go to Redrum's work. Yeah, you'll see here he's been doing really well, or Redrum has been doing really well, you know, making sales. 26 minutes ago, ten tezos. I think I saw on Twitter when he minted a new piece. It was like taking offers, like, you know you're doing well when or someone is doing well when they start taking offers because they know they're going to sell out. So just put your offer in now, take the top ten. And that's kind of what you probably saw here.
00:21:39.144 - 00:22:01.550, Speaker A: Edition of ten. And it all sold for, I guess, maybe sold for 15, one of one here selling for 250. This is 18 hours ago. So Redrum is doing very well. That 625 one day ago. So I think blowing up is an overstatement, but doing very well. Okay.
00:22:01.550 - 00:22:45.438, Speaker A: Again, seeing more signs of healthiness in this market of excitement. Here's one from two days ago edition selling out for 15 tezos. So two days ago. So, yeah, I mean, what is this AI art? Okay, so people are incorporating AI, as we probably all will one day soon. So here's that piece, Redrum's work. And finally, another AI work that turned my head by Varia Jpeg here. A very interesting combination of floral, basically, plants growing out of cars.
00:22:45.438 - 00:23:32.096, Speaker A: And just the combination reminds me, I think I brought it up here, of Max Ernst garden airplane traps a little bit. Always back to Max Ernst for some reason here, just like these floral things. I mean, this isn't a direct comparison, but it's sort of, you know what it is? It's like organic growing out of inorganic. That is actually the parallel that I see going here. A classic, classic series, garden airplane traps by Max Ernst. So that is the theme. That is the contrast here, you see, and there's a few works, I think I have them loaded up again, this organic growing out of inorganic.
00:23:32.096 - 00:23:48.926, Speaker A: That contrast intellectually and artistically. Okay. And really nicely done. AI works. This one I was a little reserved on because of the. It's a few images ago. I'm.
00:23:48.926 - 00:24:19.750, Speaker A: This. This interface of the card to me is a little too aie, shall we say. So, yeah, like, to me, this reminds me of the DeepMind Google thing from years ago. That AI never really caught on a few years ago because it was too obvious that it was AI, in my opinion. And it kind of had these, the AI distortions weren't super aesthetic. Anyways, love the series. But there, that's where I start to have reservations.
00:24:19.750 - 00:24:37.494, Speaker A: But here in the most recent ones, just totally awesome. Especially that last one. So other than that, here's another one. New tool. Be careful. Before you connect your wallet to anything, be extremely careful. I'm not connecting my wallet to this.
00:24:37.494 - 00:25:07.062, Speaker A: Maybe I'll do a burner wallet that I have on my phone. But other than with that disclaimer. Cool tool. NfT biker mentions for anyone who wants to do an advanced trade, you should look at this new tool and it looks like you can start to again do something a little bit more advanced here. Like I'll give you these two, for these two. So that is xtznft swap XYZ. So again, be very careful but looks really cool.
00:25:07.062 - 00:25:36.764, Speaker A: Okay. I mean, so just want to point that out and then finally, let's go. So this is again Berlin art week last night. This is Max Hetzler Gallery in Charlottenburg in Berlin. So this is a very kind of shishi gallery. I hadn't heard of the artist, but just to give you guys a taste, it's a german artist, I think he's 70. So he's kind of probably near, you know, at the end of his career, kind of.
00:25:36.764 - 00:26:11.432, Speaker A: So here are some of the works. And just to give you guys a feel for last night and the festivities here, here you can kind of get a better idea of the work. So, yeah, so there was that. And what else do we got? And this is, I, people said this person was really famous and showed it. Gagosian, Cecily Brown, maybe you've heard of them. I hadn't heard. And you know, one of the noteworthy things also, okay, no AI art and whatever, not gonna, I don't judge that, but I observe it.
00:26:11.432 - 00:26:53.724, Speaker A: Another observation is you see that very few people under 40, almost nobody under 30. And if they are, there are artists who are, you know, just networking, but there are barely any artists under 30. Makes me wonder again. So Artnet might trash NFTs, but I'm looking around and I'm going, huh? I think the younger people might still be in the NFTs because I don't see them hanging out at the super hot show. I see people over 40. So I'll leave you with that. Thank you once again for joining me.
00:26:53.724 - 00:26:55.644, Speaker A: Until next time, take care.
