00:00:04.440 - 00:00:30.550, Speaker A: If copyright wasn't an issue, I think you know what song I'd start with. If you recognize this image, and you know, this was by Dan control. This, I believe, this version of this image, which many of you are familiar with. We'll talk about it in a second. Artist journal, February 14, 2024. Broadcasting from the totally anti Valentine's Day city of Berlin, Germany. Wonderfully so, hilariously so.
00:00:30.550 - 00:01:08.974, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelly. One of the small delights of moving to Berlin is you are not, you know, expected to conform to the corporate holiday known as Valentine's Day. Hilariously. But nevertheless, let me wish all of you out there, especially our north american friends, a happy Valentine's Day. I was thinking about my brother, actually, because he, you know, it was him. I was very lucky as a kid having a six year old older brother, because I was introduced to this, of course. Now, this is Blue Monday by New Order, the album cover, but from the 1988 version.
00:01:08.974 - 00:02:09.168, Speaker A: Okay, so. And we'll look at the 1982 or 83 version in a second, both by Peter Savile, kind of legendary designer who did all of New Order's covers, did a lot of. I think all of Joy Division's covers was kind of, you know, the visual maestro, so to speak, of the factory records. Right. And the whole hacienda where a lot of you could argue, where a lot of our understanding and, you know, of the rave party may have been to a certain degree, not entirely, and I'm sure this is very contentious with a lot of people, but there is definitely a contribution, let's say, from the hacienda there in Manchester, a legendary club that was, you know, as far as I understand, owned and operated by factory records, who, of course, put this out in Joy Division's records. So it's all full circle here. Let's look at Dan Control's tweet here.
00:02:09.168 - 00:02:28.884, Speaker A: So this is super interesting. And it didn't get a huge look at this. Like, not a huge amount of traction here, which made me wonder how many people actually recognize this. When I saw it. And then I saw Dan was doing a remix of it, I thought this was. Yeah, for my little tabloid of the imagination here. I was like, thank you.
00:02:28.884 - 00:02:48.348, Speaker A: And front page. Thank you, Dan Control. And the fact that it didn't even get that much traction makes it even better from over here. These are on foundation, as you see here. Dancontrol, blue Monday. So this here. And number 53, Sieben Jansen.
00:02:48.348 - 00:03:10.874, Speaker A: Hund. Hundelt. Hund. So 17 january 1900, in German, new order and Ugo Rondinone. We are all remixers worthy, almost a manifesto like statement there from Dan Control, now available on foundation visiting. And let's just read a little bit of background here. Visiting the National Gallery of modern and contemporary Art in Rome.
00:03:10.874 - 00:03:35.398, Speaker A: I came across this work by Ugo Rondinone to this work on the left here, number 53, and seen and reviewed in the countless times I've been there. This last one struck me a lot. Simplicity. What else do we have? Simplicity. Mastery. Beauty. I immediately thought of Blue Monday by new order and I couldn't help but connect things and a homage, a connection, the beauty of vector.
00:03:35.398 - 00:04:03.762, Speaker A: Simplicity. Good eye, Dan. Very good eye. I took the same decentralized position of the vector circles as in Hugo Rondinone's work and repeated it in that of blue Monday. Interesting. So as to create a connection, communion and dialogue between the two, making them a diptych, taking already existing works already present and reshuffling the cards. We are all remixers.
00:04:03.762 - 00:04:40.216, Speaker A: And so here you see the work that Dan control saw in the contemporary art gallery in Rome. I've never been there. Interestingly, I'm going to Rome in April, late April. So maybe I'll go then. I think it's kind of long overdue. So here again, you see, and here's the 1988 version of Blue Monday, the re release, you know, and those remixes, by the way, don't get a ton of attention. Almost like, if you remember, for those that know it, it's like the sounds like someone.
00:04:40.216 - 00:05:00.024, Speaker A: There's a sample of what sounds like someone chomping on an apple or something in that one kind of. They're pretty fun remixes or. And interestingly, remixes of their own track, you know, released, I guess, five or six years later. So. Steven Morris. So I had this. So here is the album cover.
00:05:00.024 - 00:06:04.286, Speaker A: And I have this theory on this album just very quickly. So because we were discussing Joy Division, and here we are at new order, of course, new Order came out of Joy Division after the lead singer, Ian Curtis, committed suicide. Then you have New Order, which became a huge band, bigger than, you know, arguably bigger than Joy Division. And so my theory, if you read the book called touching from a distance by Deborah Curtis, I'm not sure if it's the wife that Ian Curtis left behind. I assume because of the last name, right? So probably the wife, the widow of Ian Curtis, wrote a book that I read, like something like 20 years ago, maybe more. And what I remember in that book is there was a Ziploc bag that the band had, Joy Division had with all of the lyrics in it. And I kind of suspect a lot of the songs of the first New Order songs came out of that Ziploc bag, is what I suspect.
00:06:04.286 - 00:06:34.408, Speaker A: And then you have also another kind of interesting idea. I originally thought it was a Joy Division song. Honestly, blue Monday, they were moving in a dance direction. My kind of thinking about it today. It's probably a hybrid of Ian Curtis lyrics and or largely Ian Curtis lyrics. Maybe even a drumbeat, because they were very tribal drumbeats that Joy Division would do. It kind of has a similar kind of feel to it.
00:06:34.408 - 00:06:54.614, Speaker A: And Joy Division was getting more upbeat. So I suspect it's kind of a hybrid. Maybe the skeleton of the song existed. The lyrics especially kind of say, ian Curtis to me. Anyway, very cool. Very cool work here from Dan control. So here it is on foundation.
00:06:54.614 - 00:07:29.654, Speaker A: Blue Monday. Very cool. And I have to say, I quite like what Dan did with the crop here because we were looking at the single and. Or at least the single is kind of like a square. But here, what it seems like there's a dialogue, as Dan was saying, between these two works taking. It seems like Dan took this work as the source, or at least the original of this, and then built a similar version of Blue Monday. So a fairly conceptual work here from Dan Control.
00:07:29.654 - 00:08:03.336, Speaker A: Cool references, cool appropriation, we might say a cool homage, a cool connection. And even this beautiful kind of manifesto like statement. We are all remixers. Beautiful. So. And how true is that? Even before, you know, we had the thing called a remix, you know, even, you know, through the ages, there is, you know, Dante reusing Virgil, you know, for example, or on and on and on. You could go, this is the original 1982 sleeve.
00:08:03.336 - 00:08:33.314, Speaker A: And I thought this was kind of hilarious, maybe 1983. I thought this was hilarious of this single, because here it kind of relates to our scene. Here's a diskette, five and a quarter inch disk, where the record went in. So this is the original record sleeve, which they legendarily lost money on. Who knows if they actually did, it wouldn't shock me. Released in 1983 and they were able to finally break free. And that's probably still their biggest track.
00:08:33.314 - 00:09:16.564, Speaker A: One would think of new Order. Don't want to go too far on this, because not everybody is super down with the new Order Joy Division talk. But very interesting. Like, again, following the suicide of Ian Curtis in May 1980, the band regrouped and released one album, movement, which I actually quite enjoy, by the way, which was dismissed as a hollow copy of their original sound. There is a sense of Ian Curtis lyrics, again, and even I'm sure they had leftover tracks. With Blue Monday, the band embraced synthesizer technology, sequencers, and the sound of the New York dance floor. They had spent much of 1982 touring and heard a lot of incredible tracks at New York City's cutting edge clubs.
00:09:16.564 - 00:10:02.946, Speaker A: And then, of course, there's the designer, Peter Savile, and it's about the disc drive, actually, he went to the studio and said, what's this? And it's a floppy disk. Haven't you seen them? I asked him if I could have it and drove back to London listening to Blue Monday on a cassette. But staring at this floppy disk, I knew there was an intrinsic link between the disc and their new direction. So this kind of interesting link here with technology from the designer of all of Joy Division's covers and as far as I understand, all of New Order's covers. Here's just a quick look. If you're not familiar, of course, many of you, if not all of you, are familiar with this image now. You know, there was a time when Joy Division, like when I was a kid, it wasn't really cool.
00:10:02.946 - 00:10:33.574, Speaker A: Like, again, talking about my brother, we had still, at home, we didn't have the other ones, but we had still, which was kind of one of the least accessible of Joy Division's albums. I had it in grade six. And, you know, the thing that was cool then was guns n roses. Use your illusion. So hopelessly obscure, you know? So again, it's awesome that eventually Joy Division did get kind of what you might consider to be a more mainstream acceptance. You see the variation here and look at this great little design. A true artist, Peter Savile.
00:10:33.574 - 00:10:51.666, Speaker A: You know, like, and even, I think there are art exhibitions that happen every so often, like design taken to the point of it being true poetry. Did he do this? This happy Mondays? That would be impressive. I'm not. I don't think he did. Maybe he did. Factory records, Peter Savile. Not sure.
00:10:51.666 - 00:11:23.638, Speaker A: Of course, this is technique, another underrated, but let's not go too far on that. But a great designer and a great way to start. Dancontrol exclusive. That is brilliant work. Kind of relating to our discussion here, and I'm still trying to figure out how I relate to this comment here. Very few artists have communicated anything profoundly different in a digital medium, I think you could say, in any new medium, but let's continue that hasn't already been expressed in other formats. Maybe the constant speed of new technology is the problem.
00:11:23.638 - 00:12:10.514, Speaker A: Artists get stuck reacting to the tech or just become a product of it. Yeah. So for me personally, I don't really. The tech has become very much like, if you look at the history of art, I think you can go all the way back to the cave painters, right to the very, very, very beginning or to the Venus. It's not the Venus of Lascaux, but that little Venus sculpture that's like however many tens of thousands of years old technology is there at the very beginning, I would argue. And then you see oil painting. So in a sense, in human nature, you could say, is a constant.
00:12:10.514 - 00:13:07.310, Speaker A: So in a sense, it's almost like this. I think this is being leveled as a kind of criticism of sorts, but I kind of agree with it. But I don't see it as a criticism. Very few artists have communicated anything profoundly different in a digital medium that hasn't already been expressed in other formats. In a sense, again, human nature is similar, but I'm not, you know, but the digital medium has provided us with, I would argue it's hard, you know, again, as I used to say when I started this program, like a year and a half ago, it's like a cambrian explosion, what's going on here of creativity and again, celebrating this digital medium here. So again, this is kind of framed as a problem. Maybe the constant speed of new technology is the problem, but I would argue the digital medium is what's kind of keeping these stories and themes that we return to interesting.
00:13:07.310 - 00:13:51.034, Speaker A: It's sort of like love songs will probably be with us for another thousand years. It's how they're going to be done or performed or what kind of music tech. It'll probably be deeply related to where the tech is in a thousand years. So I. So again, I don't know if I'd say that's a feature, not a bug, but it's tempting, you know, like, it's like the digital medium is basically, you know, that's what's allowing us to actually say it in a slightly different way, in a way that maybe some of us relate to. Again, we've talked about the important influence of video games on the arts. So anyways, very interesting and provocative comment from James Bloom, which I thought kind of fit really nicely, actually, with the Dan control.
00:13:51.034 - 00:14:11.914, Speaker A: Right. Because we are all remixers. Right. So just brilliant comment there from Dancontrol as well, coming up in very shortly here. I need to finish this show. Calo is going to be on, of course, who writes that great newsletter on digital art and nfts. Really thrilled to have Kayla on the show.
00:14:11.914 - 00:14:40.534, Speaker A: We recorded about a week and a half ago last Monday, we did an interview for his podcast. Should be out in a week or two. And I was on there and now thrilled to have Kayla on here, so that should be great. Come meet Kalo. You know who, you know who has this kind of whole other kind of digital art kind of world and different people. So all to say, that should be really good. And come meet Calo.
00:14:40.534 - 00:15:02.302, Speaker A: I. You probably won't see this by the time or by the time. It'll probably have happened by the time you see this, but just wanted to, in case I get this up really quickly, I just wanted to mention now, speaking of quick, we won't be able to go all the way into Santiago's comment here. Crash top. That's a whole lot of wires at the beginning. Nice looking. Someone's studio.
00:15:02.302 - 00:15:33.054, Speaker A: That is Klaus referring to Klaus there in the studio. This is a pretty in depth comment, and I'm not sure, actually, maybe I return to this at another show because it's really interesting, but it's hard for me to go through this entire comment without taking five or ten minutes here. But thank you for the comment, santiago. And thank you. Perfect. Beginning with that piece regarding to Klaus's work. And I should have brought this up.
00:15:33.054 - 00:15:47.550, Speaker A: Klaus was saying, maybe I should bring that up. Maybe I always have. Trick. It's a little tricky on desktop to find the retweets with quotes in them. Maybe I'll try and figure that. But I put them on my page, maybe we can find it. So close's piece really resonated.
00:15:47.550 - 00:16:09.510, Speaker A: And we're going to look here. I'll bring up Klaus's comment here on how he felt, because he said he held onto it for a month and wasn't even sure about it. And then for so many people, I got a few comments saying, what a wonderful piece to begin with. And Santiago in there, too. I was looking at them recently. Gonna keep watching the show. So thank you, Santiago, for the comments.
00:16:09.510 - 00:16:23.782, Speaker A: Toronto Berlin. This is hilarious. So shout out to Tobias. And I think this is. I brought up the image. You see, there's this little image here. These are the people who cut my hair, actually, in Berlin.
00:16:23.782 - 00:16:36.620, Speaker A: This is Toronto Berlin. There's Tobias, there's Michelle. That is the. Those are the architects of the sculpture that resides on top of my skull here. And there is the whole team there. So hilarious. Big shout out.
00:16:36.620 - 00:16:47.404, Speaker A: I assume that was Tobias there. Hair looks nice, Adrian. Hilarious, retro Manny. You just got to show up and not care. Yeah. Referring to the hair. Hair looks cool.
00:16:47.404 - 00:17:13.664, Speaker A: Thank you regarding your discussion. And thank them. Toronto Berlin regarding your discussion around strange things, comment on object about object. It's really interesting to see how social metrics are starting to matter less and less. At least it seems that way to me. Maybe the old social proof dynamic is no longer relevant. Art can be appreciated by other artists on socials for free, but our collectors starting to bypass these platforms and just keep up with our favorite artists on marketplaces.
00:17:13.664 - 00:17:56.154, Speaker A: Yes, I think technology is disrupting to it. I don't know if social proof will ever disappear. And of course, social proof being the review, you know, is your classic example, the testimony, very, very probably the most powerful form of marketing, other than just sheer repetition, is social proof someone else that you like or respect recommending it? We've discussed social proof a lot, or for a long time, let's say, on this show. Is it no longer relevant? I think it's still relevant, but maybe what I see happening is a kind of. To your point, and I think your observation, I agree with it. I think it's starting to fragment. I mean, we see it in our own collecting.
00:17:56.154 - 00:18:54.740, Speaker A: We see it in our own ways of collecting, right? I mean, am I going to Jerry salts to find out what I should be buying and or selling or buying on an object? Of course not, right? Where am I going to, you know? So this is very interesting. We're also seeing another dynamic where I would argue the work of art is taking on a weird. Where the individual piece is taking on more significance than maybe it used to with the physical artists. I brought this up on a space a few weeks ago where if you have a single, where you're. No, I'd say in this space digitally, your work is judged more according to the individual piece. The fact that it's a certain artist matters, but doesn't matter as much as I'd argue in the physical realm where it's like, oh, it's a Picasso, who cares? I'll buy the ceramic. All good.
00:18:54.740 - 00:19:06.104, Speaker A: But in the digital space, it seems like that individual work matters a little bit more. But our collectors. So, interesting question. A little behind. So we'll be spending the weekend binging. Awesome. Best hair.
00:19:06.104 - 00:19:28.808, Speaker A: Thank you, PP again. So big shout out to Toronto, Berlin. I just went there because I was like, oh, maybe that's meant to be, you know, looking for a hairdresser. As I. After a year of moving here and kind of going to random places. Okay, continuing on, John Cates. So comments on last show.
00:19:28.808 - 00:19:59.246, Speaker A: First, it's okay to copy. So we're kind of back to Dan control here. Believing in the process of copying as much as you can with all your heart is a good place to start. Phil Morton, 1973. Remember I was discussing, I think it was last episode, this idea of remixing to the point where it's unrecognizable. It's an interesting question, you know, referring to music, but you could look at this. And so, yeah, so here we're back to this idea of copying and remixing.
00:19:59.246 - 00:20:23.470, Speaker A: What's new, you know, to James Bloom's point cult leader. I love the first piece. It really was bookmarked. Thank you, Ray case and Jake Studios. And yeah, thank you for the comments. Ray Kays, Jake Studios always glad to hear from others regarding my pieces. I don't usually put words and descriptions onto it, and somehow looking for that, for what people think feels about the piece.
00:20:23.470 - 00:20:32.982, Speaker A: Pokebelly is doing great work. Thank you Valdez. Enjoyed the show. Thank you. Ate nothing. And thank you Jada. And thank you Bosske.
00:20:32.982 - 00:20:52.662, Speaker A: Great selection. Really happy you chose our slides. We will sure go on making these infinite collages and we have more today. Great Doctor version, great show. Klaus is on fire with this composition series. So big reaction. And he was the one who picked up that first work off of last episode that we opened the show with.
00:20:52.662 - 00:21:13.416, Speaker A: Love. The new Pedro Juana you featured as well, and thank you, Ranix dear. Great to hear from you. Gogolitis Zuozo. Enjoyed listening while working on a new piece. Like, the comments on nostalgia and copies made me think of art as a creative copying device. You know, this idea is really resonating, isn't it? Because it's, you know, it's an interesting discussion here.
00:21:13.416 - 00:21:53.898, Speaker A: And again, we think of James Bloom. We think of Dan Control. Dan Control celebrating on one side, James Bloom kind of criticizing, seemingly on the other, that repeats and brings back previous artworks to new contexts and forms as nostalgia brings back precious past moments to the present. And we could even see AI, to a certain degree, as kind of sampling from whatever image, you know, loosely termed tradition of images, whatever's online, and then kind of rereleasing it back as some sort of, you know, you know, I want to say mingled substance there, but that's not exactly right. Anyways, let's continue. Cider. Appreciate.
00:21:53.898 - 00:22:10.434, Speaker A: Appreciate it. Once again, Poco and the idea of cider truck was taken, by the way, from machine, who ex. By the way, machine executed her cars by the idea of putting cider in there came from 500 arts. Anyway, much love. Thank you. Cider, great to hear from you. And lotrips.
00:22:10.434 - 00:22:21.554, Speaker A: Thank you. Shout out to Toronto, Berlin, and Skull takes. I love Klaus analog works. Was nice to get a look inside the studio. The minesweeper piece by RJ. So good. We're going to see a few more here.
00:22:21.554 - 00:22:32.678, Speaker A: Thanks for another great show. Hilarious. This looks like Mister Rogers. Hilarious. And finally here, beautiful prints by uxing. This is Kells. Somehow reminds me of Warhol's oxidation paintings on music.
00:22:32.678 - 00:22:54.144, Speaker A: Is there an old vid somewhere on your goa days? You know, that's an awesome question. You know, I. That's an awesome question. You could almost do a whole. You could almost do a whole show, and I mean, like regular show on, frankly, on music. But that would be. People have such strong opinions about music that.
00:22:54.144 - 00:23:09.558, Speaker A: No, I don't is the answer to the question. But maybe. Maybe you put out a little series. Very interesting idea. Thank you. Kells Wano and really appreciate the kind words. Greatshow, as always, was unfamiliar with the work of Sigmar Polka.
00:23:09.558 - 00:23:26.494, Speaker A: Thank you for the awesome reference. And here is the great Sigmar polka using bedsheets or some sort of, you know, probably bed sheets as a source to paint on. So thank you, everybody. Denise guitar and Amir Hossein. I. Let me just. I brought it up here.
00:23:26.494 - 00:23:46.570, Speaker A: I wanted to bring Klaus comments, and then we'll dive into the art. And let me see. Here it is. I was spending the day at the studio and was pretty stoked to see such an extensive review of my works. Thank you so much. Pokebilly. About the opening piece, I was actually quite hesitant about minting the composition 126.
00:23:46.570 - 00:24:26.238, Speaker A: And this is something, we're just talking about this with PP Universal, who is still adamant that the rock will not be unburnt or, you know, remade or reminted. But where I liked it, Aylay liked it. And this idea that maybe the artists aren't necessarily the best judges of their own work. And I say that thinking about myself. And here's close. I was actually quite hesitant about minting composition 126 in the first place. It was sitting and waiting on the editing desk, I think, for over a month, and couldn't decide if it's good to go or not, which is usually a good sign just to put it out in the public if the doubtful feeling is extended enough.
00:24:26.238 - 00:24:56.010, Speaker A: And I think, like, for me, it might have been my favorite, you know, as soon as I saw it, I was like, ooh, I have something to start this show with. So just very interesting there. And I think we have enough comments here for the show. Okay, let's continue here. Kevon, co founder of foundation. Today we're announcing exhibitions the best way to present, buy and sell digital art. NFTs and digital art are a perfect match.
00:24:56.010 - 00:26:04.578, Speaker A: There's no way to sell digital art without nfts. But not all NFTs are digital art. All to say, you see this, this formatting here, edit exhibition, it looks like, you know, I think I was discussing this actually in, when I was talking about object one. Like what if you could start to make wide, I don't know if they listen to that show or not, it's probably just random. But if you could, what if you could just start to customize the size and where you actually start getting closer and closer to this idea of a digital art exhibition by being able to make it larger, move the text around and it looks like they have a, what you see is what you get kind of editor where you can drag and drop or at least something close to that. So isn't that interesting? So this idea of exhibitions, here's some more examples here. Isn't this interesting? So really customizing, we're seeing an increased customization of the space which maybe gives galleries meaning in this digital art world where they seem to be kind of left out because they're always the physical space for showing the work.
00:26:04.578 - 00:26:52.054, Speaker A: Right? Zora, we've made it easy to buy and sell on the secondary place offers or buy instantly, list or sell now browse and accept offers. So more iterations here from Zora in this exciting know friendly competition here between Zora object and foundation. They are. What's kind of great about it is there, it seems to me that, and I'm just speculating, but it seems to me they're pushing each other forward. And what's good about it is, you know, if new players come on the scene, they're going to be way behind just by virtue of all the work that these guys have done, that these people have done. So very interesting. Ivan Hugo wondering about Ivan's Zora drops, not minting.
00:26:52.054 - 00:27:26.234, Speaker A: I think this is because the value of Zora work is now completely unclear in their, and their policies in my opinion, make this worse. Don't get me wrong, I like Zora, but I like the positioning as a web3 media platform and not an NFT marketplace. In my opinion they're ideal for things like poke belly artists video journal because in this area they are unique and suitable with the comment function. Interesting. But this whole game with l two ethereum coin to me makes them an attempt to sit on two chairs. They're not perceived as an established but expensive ethereum and not liquid in Artsia's tezos. So interesting comments here.
00:27:26.234 - 00:27:55.524, Speaker A: I mean, I think the reason, I mean, my initial thoughts are Zora's been great for artists like, you know, as you see, if you get 200 mints, I mean, that's real money. Oftentimes you get more from Zorob just based on the amounts that you mint. So. But it's tricky and I'm not sure how they run the homepage. Right. So I don't, because I think it's all about to a certain degree, being on the homepage. At least it was when they had the other layout.
00:27:55.524 - 00:28:34.904, Speaker A: So all very interesting to see. Now it's saying those who advertise on the main page have a lot of mints. So I don't know if you can advertise interesting. But at the same time, as for me, this further confuses the value of the word works because multiple additions lead to depreciation or at least difficulty in the resale. So again, saying Zora works really well for content creators and musicians, but maybe the visual arts, it's a different matter. Interesting, just interesting comments popple with a work in progress and we're going to have to speed up here because we actually have a space that I have to prepare for in, well, 45 minutes here. So we're going to run.
00:28:34.904 - 00:28:54.660, Speaker A: Here is the work in progress. We saw the original from Popple. So just a clue here into. I love how the dithering comes after and the gradients here from Popple's new work there. So very cool there. Look at the response to popple there. Huge following online there.
00:28:54.660 - 00:29:24.216, Speaker A: Psycho at Art Fair Tokyo now let me just see if I can translate this. Our gallery will be exhibiting at Art Fair Tokyo that will be held in early March this year. We're going to be exit exhibiting new works by digital artist Ayako Ibarra, also known as score or psycho. And here we see saiko working in the studio. In touch designer, I believe. So very cool there. And here is.
00:29:24.216 - 00:29:44.156, Speaker A: And let me just close that. And here we see Saiko in Japanese. And here, look how great this looks. So outside. So again, another kind of physical rendition here. And we see the kirakira process at work. I almost cried when I thought my work would become someone else's memories.
00:29:44.156 - 00:30:14.448, Speaker A: It was little girls were having fun in front of my work, taking pictures and people passing by said it's beautiful. So really nice to again show your work in public here. So here is one version and a little bit more from Saiko. And there is a link too, interestingly so generative art. So again, doing great there with the art in public. Looks like a beautiful day there in Tokyo, if I'm not mistaken. So very cool there.
00:30:14.448 - 00:30:34.812, Speaker A: Let's continue. Let me just close that. Let's glitch it. So using the camera here from Donia, aka. And pretty nice pixelation going on here, if you ask me. Kind of makes me want one of these cameras here. And here's another one by bleak.
00:30:34.812 - 00:30:53.064, Speaker A: And we'll see. And just kind of up close with a little bit of animation in here. So pretty cool. And continuing on here is ripcache in the gallery. And you wonder, is this the aluminum? Not sure. Quite vibrant colors here. Focus.
00:30:53.064 - 00:31:17.254, Speaker A: So enigmatic here, but cool. Very large work here by rip cash. And just again, showing how, you know, pixel art can really be stretched to a huge size. And it looks pretty awesome when you make it big. Makes me wonder if this is a screen. It almost looks like a screen rather than a screen print, doesn't it? Very interesting here. And here's demon ego in the studio.
00:31:17.254 - 00:31:52.466, Speaker A: And again, we see that familiar cutting board underneath. And just a really cool, you know, again, working physically and digital. So here we see some physical ink work. And here's element li, cardboard engraving details. So working in cardboard, again with the laser engraving, and you see all sorts of wonderful things going on here, as you can see. And then this kinda just like, you know, everyday material that, you know, is infused with all this value here. And you just gotta love.
00:31:52.466 - 00:32:11.642, Speaker A: Makes me wonder. I think element Li might have their own laser engraver. We're gonna see some of element Li's new works here. And here I'd like to present you Gatot Chien d'amour. This is Banzai, Tokyo. A linocut print that we've created for Saint Valentine's. I don't want to say too much, but it was probably the most involved project for Sasha's.
00:32:11.642 - 00:32:38.528, Speaker A: It had very practical purpose. So here we see a linocut, which is very similar to woodcut, but just easier to cut into. And it's all this kind of random stuff here that often happens in a linocut, see, around the side, and also the roughness. So it's another way of translating works and giving them kind of this poeticness that comes with randomization that you see here. So interesting work here. Looks good. Hey.
00:32:38.528 - 00:32:54.664, Speaker A: And you generally want to keep it here. It's two colors, nice and simple. You want to keep it simple because it can get complicated. Into the digital art we go so rj with some really interesting pieces here. Cool concept. The Internet is our garden now. After Claude Monet, water lilies and japanese bridge.
00:32:54.664 - 00:33:22.866, Speaker A: So a late Monet. Fairly late, not too late. And here you see an interesting kind of screen, green outline, again, reminiscent of the apple iie, to a certain degree, monitor. And then some noise in some negative space here, interestingly. And the noise is animated, so you get that great contrast again between the. The movement and the static pixels here. Nicely done.
00:33:22.866 - 00:33:41.356, Speaker A: Doesn't need to be too perfect in a sense, like, as you see here, you know, just nicely. Nice outline. Good to go. So this is five tezos, already selling quite a few here. There are three left. This is an edition of ten, so putting out quite a few. The Internet is our church now, I thought a pretty cool series here.
00:33:41.356 - 00:34:10.056, Speaker A: Of course, this is Van Gogh. So we're back to pastiche, but really remixing. We're back to remixing. Isn't this interesting? After Vincent van Gogh, 1890, last year of his life there. You know, I think I mentioned this on a previous episode, but if you didn't know, van Gogh did all the famous paintings that we know in. In the last three years of his life, so isn't that interesting? And then you go to the potato peelers. That was maybe four years.
00:34:10.056 - 00:34:42.067, Speaker A: And then there's maybe a couple of years before of some of the earlier works. Isn't that interesting? Anyways, continuing the Internet is our lover now, who is this? John William Waterhouse. Echo and Narcissus. Interesting. So I believe a pre Raphaelite here, which was a group in the 19th century that wanted to go back to pre Raphael type values in italian painting. Isn't that kind of provocative? So they were called the pre Raphaelites, as far as I understand. If we had more time, I would show you the original.
00:34:42.067 - 00:35:03.394, Speaker A: All to say, though, more cool work from RJ. This is a one of one for 69 tezos. So that is cool. And the Internet is our home now. This is after Edward Hopper, High Noon, 1949. And you just gotta love that green, don't you? Beautiful green there. And again, there's something just really beautiful about this series, isn't there? Beautiful pastiche series.
00:35:03.394 - 00:35:33.454, Speaker A: And also, so we saw this over the creation, Adam, Mona Lisa. Almost turning these into, like, programming type format here. Let's. And so here's the Mona Lisa. And so, done with minesweeper. It's interesting, RJ was kind of teasing this series out maybe a month ago, a month and a half ago, and it didn't really catch on. And now it seems to be doing very well.
00:35:33.454 - 00:36:08.614, Speaker A: Look at this. So maybe change the pricing, it's only a tezos, but now, you know, addition of 15, but doing pretty well. So maybe change the pricing again. The whole kind of adjusted to the market. And as I look at it, if something doesn't sell, maybe that's a nice way to do it, is you take it away, you get people to forget about it a little bit, and then you bring it back, and they don't even remember what it was before. And then you can kind of reintroduce it if you screw up the pricing. And I'm not saying that's what happened here, but kind of interesting that RJ brought it back.
00:36:08.614 - 00:36:42.624, Speaker A: Here's a Pepe mine suite. Pepe and girl with pearl earring, of course, after Vermeer. So playing, of course, RJ, an expert or studying, you know, post post modernism. So we always have this kind of hyper advanced, kind of pastiche concept here. A lot of concept going on here, isn't there? A lot of, you know, interesting discussion on copies, remixing all of this stuff. Here's malware. This is by axin sending a free copy over to John Cates and who we saw the first comment there.
00:36:42.624 - 00:37:11.054, Speaker A: So doing well here, as usual with oxy. And let's just bring this in kind of a slight non finito here in the writing. And very nice painting here with the Malbro man lighting a cigarette with the kind of crypto art skull. Nice and loose. Hey, we're talking about rawness here. And interesting how it's very interesting how it's colored here, because we're seeing. It's almost like a scumbling of sorts on top of this.
00:37:11.054 - 00:37:30.234, Speaker A: Very interesting. It's almost like the coloring, or there's like a scumbling on top of this, if you know what I'm saying. This greenish gray on top of the purple. Very interesting. And, of course, that matte black. And almost miss this great writing down here. Love it.
00:37:30.234 - 00:38:01.300, Speaker A: Malware by Euxine. So, edition of 33. And on object. Beautiful painting here, of course, by rare, which is based on the. Is it David? And they're, of course, now doing the Tesla robot rather than the death of. Who is this again? This is that 18, I want to say Jean Louis David or something. And it's a very famous painting.
00:38:01.300 - 00:38:26.154, Speaker A: I'm sure most of you know it here. And of course, instead of the Boston dynamics dog, we have the Tesla robot. And again, keeping that kind of corporate feel on the Tesla there, which I quite like, kind of helps with the contrast and their optimus, rare signing, probably like. And then there's a knife. And then. So we'll have to. I think it had to do with the French Revolution, the original.
00:38:26.154 - 00:38:42.462, Speaker A: And so, anyway, we'll look more into that. I'm sure we'll get more info, too. Continuing on NAV 1914 communication. So more interesting experimentation here. A one of one. This sold again. And selling to one of one for only 650 there.
00:38:42.462 - 00:39:04.018, Speaker A: So more interesting work here by NUV 1914. Interest, just constant experimentation here. There are other works here, too. Look at this portone. This sold to DJ Quiro for seven tezos. And you see here, keeping the transform tool from almost doing a screenshot. It seems like a photoshop there.
00:39:04.018 - 00:39:30.742, Speaker A: So pretty interesting there, incorporating it into the work. Look at this wild, radical flower there, too. Different textures. And here is Sirena, likely meaning siren, referring to mermaids, which of course, sirens in the odyssey there. And look at this when you look up close. So a lot of work put into this one. Kind of a more formal piece, we might be tempted to think.
00:39:30.742 - 00:39:49.418, Speaker A: And just very cool. This is nineties, still available. And here is hasdrubal waffle with a pretty cool work interloper. This is sold for 0.069 to Jack Mashka. I think the yes listed for half an ETH there. That would have been awesome.
00:39:49.418 - 00:40:11.962, Speaker A: But still doing very well. Again, ETH is at $2,600. So not a bad take there at all. 100, 4150 bucks. And here, a cool character here, lifting weights and then someone coming in through the window. Or is it a painting? An interesting space created here. So just more cool work by hasdrubal waffle, at least on foundation.
00:40:11.962 - 00:40:37.400, Speaker A: And here's mumble boy, another cool composition. Laz Rainbow man. This is for Tezos edition of three. So huge amount of output here from mumble boy. Pretty cool. And I assume most of this is new because I remember at a certain point, mumble boy was putting older works, and then said mumble boy was putting newer works. So I assume these are newer works.
00:40:37.400 - 00:41:00.212, Speaker A: Pretty cool. Nice combination, again, of collage and digital kind of workmanship. Interesting in the middle there with that, with this thing. Hey, almost a drop shadow in there, interestingly. And that is for Taseaus edition of three. Here's cider. Pretty cool work here, isn't it? Great texture is usual.
00:41:00.212 - 00:41:17.104, Speaker A: I'm not sure if we have a clue. She's a little shy, so maybe it's a dog. And this kind of looks like a wolf or a dog here. And maybe there's another dog here. So just beautifully distorted work from cider. Again, huge audience there, too. 100 retweets on that.
00:41:17.104 - 00:41:40.320, Speaker A: Uri J with some interesting works here. I think this is a series called conversations. And here you actually see text. Something I'm actually super interested in. I love how this is all being treated here. So I didn't realize actually this is a really cool exploration of text, isn't it? That's my name. Look at that.
00:41:40.320 - 00:42:02.284, Speaker A: Pokebelly this on. So maybe remember that work that yuri, I think it was Yuri J put on, I think was made on Zora. I wonder if that was the source here. Second conversation. That's hilarious. So finding myself all over the blockchain here. So anyways, really cool exploration of writing here.
00:42:02.284 - 00:42:21.778, Speaker A: Second conversation. Uri J. This is 42 tezos on object here. And here is another one. First conversation. So not exactly like the other works that were being remixed and filled in differently, we might say with kind of similar outlines. These ones look a little different.
00:42:21.778 - 00:42:36.158, Speaker A: It's just treating text in a certain way. It's an exploration of the treatment of text. Very cool. Here's another one. Chill conversation. And there are more. But just wanted to kind of just touch on a few here as we see.
00:42:36.158 - 00:42:59.566, Speaker A: So very interesting work from Yuri J. This is 69 tazos edition of one. And here's Mikael Knowlsson and doing really well here. Huge audience on Solana with a work here. And again a nice digital abstract, you know, expressionist type painting here. Exploring the digital lines here. Digital brushstrokes here in this work.
00:42:59.566 - 00:43:18.314, Speaker A: Recognizably mikels. And continuing on walk with an edition of one. And this is probably sold. I loved how minimal this one was. Just the shadow, the ghost of a door here in this series here. 1016 and that went for three tezos. Interestingly to Vec.
00:43:18.314 - 00:43:40.608, Speaker A: Vec is. And here's 1017. Again this looks more like a fireman here in this 911 work. And this is for tezos. So going for actually you know, probably great buys here. Again these are one of ones. Beautiful work isn't it? So continuing on one of one they picked up this piece from Agnes Eg who is Agnes Evergrace.
00:43:40.608 - 00:43:54.414, Speaker A: And I thought this was a pretty cool work here. I think we've seen maybe their work before. The name rings familiar here. Fun is infinite. Click here to download. Let's see what one of one said. Falling in the humor insane category we present.
00:43:54.414 - 00:44:10.586, Speaker A: I'm no longer smoking. The artist's description of this piece sums it up nicely for us. And you can read that there. So all to say just an interesting, wild, wild experimental piece. Leeches of pebble. Cove. This is blue retina with a new one.
00:44:10.586 - 00:44:36.272, Speaker A: Welcome to Pebble Cove, the end of your sufferings, magic traveler. This is 33 tezos now on secondary. Also has quite a large collector base on object here. And classic colors here by blue retina here, these kind of the warm red and that kind of Internet blue. That web blue. And here we see some feet here on what looks like kind of a stone floor here. So interesting, interesting.
00:44:36.272 - 00:44:55.720, Speaker A: With the 24 there and the fish sign. Leeches of Pebble Cove. And so this is, this sold out on primary for 22 tezos, each edition of 21. So nice sale there. Figments. Our friend captain is back on the scene with Bothermord. And this was released February 13.
00:44:55.720 - 00:45:27.184, Speaker A: Already sold out at ten tezos each. And I feel like the market's, you know, getting more and more like. I wouldn't call this a soft market anymore. It's like that little lull we had seemed to last about six weeks. You know, it's not a soft market anymore. Like, again, because there was an, you know, using figments here as a gauge because there's a point, and it could depend on the individual work. But there was a point like a month ago where, you know, this wouldn't sell out right away.
00:45:27.184 - 00:45:45.944, Speaker A: This is selling out right away. Okay, this, you know, so we don't have the exact dates. Oh, here we do. 812, you know, within is that 2 hours. Within 2 hours, pigment sells out at ten tezos, each edition of ten. I mean, not bad at all. Beautiful work.
00:45:45.944 - 00:46:28.648, Speaker A: Here's Elna Frederick, also totally recognizable as her work grief. And here we have, I guess you'd call it, Sisyphus type character, who was the torture of Sisyphus was, of course, if I'm remembering right, bringing the stone all the way up the hill to the point where it just goes all the way down. This was like the punishment of Sisyphus, who I think, and I'm going on a leap here, who stole or Prometheus, wasn't it? Not sure. I was going to say who stole the fire from Zeus, but that's Prometheus. Getting my myths mixed up here. We'll look. I'm going to try and remember to look at the.
00:46:28.648 - 00:46:59.238, Speaker A: Because I think this is Sisyphus. Isn't this grief? So, selling addition of ten, selling for 50 tezos each on object Jake studios the end is sphere. So a preview, I believe. And here we see some drones with some eyeballs and classic clouds here, kind of light blue this time, and then interesting kind of gradients in the background here. With what look like rocks. And then so again, very suggestive and just associative. And look at this great suitcase with jpegs in it.
00:46:59.238 - 00:47:12.780, Speaker A: This you're almost tempted to think of as Jake studios. A portrait of Jake Studios. The end is fear. And this person with a baseball bat maybe to steal the suitcase of JPegs. Let's continue here. Boo boy. Party.
00:47:12.780 - 00:47:38.194, Speaker A: Party list. And here, so kind of a party work. This was minted February 13 yesterday. And again has this great kind of textured background here. And we see this drawing, this digital drawing, grenade money and a party people with masks and everything. And even laurels here. So interesting.
00:47:38.194 - 00:47:57.432, Speaker A: Would you call that a crown of laurels? I'm blanking on that. And here's some swimmers. So all sorts of wildness going on in this work party list. And we have another one too. Life is joke. And this is reserve of 1.65. And this is at auction for 1.65
00:47:57.432 - 00:48:12.992, Speaker A: a reserve or buy now for two. And here is the work. And I wonder if you get a physical. It almost looks physical. And because I know Buboy was working with physical NFT and physical painting acrylic on linen. Nice work. 100 by 130.
00:48:12.992 - 00:48:28.244, Speaker A: So actually quite not a small work. Bigger than I expected. So this is a physical. Let's just check the other and see if it's physical. This is also NFT and physical painting. 120 by 160 cm. So you get both when you buy it.
00:48:28.244 - 00:48:55.966, Speaker A: Interesting. And here is Seba Sestaro, who I do follow. That is x glitch on x. And here, quite a cool piece here too, with these figures here in the middle of this kind of dreamlike line drawing of almost look like stretched out lemons, but could be anything. And then these just kind of a dreamy work here with this figure almost repeated at the bottom. And road to the core. Interesting.
00:48:55.966 - 00:49:12.814, Speaker A: And here is Katarina. Create rainbow dream. So another work here. This is edition of ten. So super prolific here. And selling for only a tezos. Each interesting kind of change here, or at least variation, let's call it on the outlines here.
00:49:12.814 - 00:49:33.294, Speaker A: So colored outlines, more experimentation here. Big flowers here and big kind of the figure taking up almost the entire canvas here. Almost going to the edge here. Surrounded by flowers and everything. Cool colored background there too. Kind of a light, I think a light cream that doesn't look like white, does it? To great effect. Rainbow dream.
00:49:33.294 - 00:50:07.184, Speaker A: Cool title. Continuing on, let's look at Julie Rose, who we haven't seen from for a long time, but would fit nicely in this illustration show with these other illustrated works here. Kind of looking like plants here. And here again, just looking like kind of a sketch with plants, kind of digital illustration, shall we say, digitally colored and everything. Just interesting piece here. And here is Santiago, the stars, new work on Zora. So interesting piece here.
00:50:07.184 - 00:50:23.920, Speaker A: And again, we're talking about the asymmetric writing. And so interesting. Adding a little bit of a three dimensional feel with these kind of drop shadows of sorts. Interesting little dots on top. So this is on Zora, doing quite well there. Interesting title here is Mo. Mo.
00:50:23.920 - 00:50:34.968, Speaker A: S h I T. Life is castle. Interesting experimental work here put. Oh, this is a month old. So this was tweeted out. And this was on Zora. So just kind of a cool work.
00:50:34.968 - 00:50:49.282, Speaker A: I like the video game kind of motif or feel to these different kind of sunflowers here. So interesting. So this is still. So this is on secondary now. So. And here is a, I believe a newer one here. And look at this.
00:50:49.282 - 00:51:19.212, Speaker A: Mo is doing very well here. Let's. We've been tracking Mo's followers now at 5725 followers. So Mo, who I do follow, by the way, is doing very well here, putting out a ton of images and really building a base here. And here it is, I assume, on Zora. Let's see how it does. Let's see if this is translating like, in a sense, interestingly, one minted, but that's usually the minter on Zora now.
00:51:19.212 - 00:51:45.548, Speaker A: So it's interesting how. But it's doing. I mean, you got a, you know, there is a point. Remember when popple hit like two or 3 million views or 4 million? Was it like a huge amount of views? Whereas the point where it's almost like the views are his worth is, you know, is a way of attributing value as much as the money to a certain degree, or at least. So anyway, very interesting. There might be worth sneaking in to pick, to mint this. So 20, but you got 28 days.
00:51:45.548 - 00:52:06.402, Speaker A: Interesting piece here. Here is human boy on now on Solana on exchange art, putting out a series here. Mid journey and gimp. So this is AI. Yes, we could have put this in the AI section here. So just an interesting GiF here using AI and gimp. And here we start to see some of those textures.
00:52:06.402 - 00:52:35.912, Speaker A: Here is this mid journey because it almost reminds me of those stable diffusion textures we've been noticing here. And you can see the whole series here on Solana. A few static works at the bottom and then some animated ones on top. And here is muji family. Evening. So another computer here and another test and another sorry, I was getting weird sounds. That is outside.
00:52:35.912 - 00:53:03.896, Speaker A: And another monitor here with very interesting, beautiful large scale, almost like a disco ball here. Large scale pixels here. And then contrasting with this shine. Always keeping it very advanced in the. In the textures, almost these digital textures. Look at how these. Also, these disk drives here, also over here, beautiful colors, great sense of color from Yuji family evening.
00:53:03.896 - 00:53:32.164, Speaker A: Interesting title with little underscore there. Edition of 20 selling out, you know, maybe with bitcoin above $50,000, people are like, this is interesting, isn't it? It was strong market. This is kind of an edgy work by Lorna Mills. I believe this is sign language for abortion, if I'm not mistaken. So this is an edgy work. Minister's baby, created for refraction. Miami, 2023.
00:53:32.164 - 00:53:51.858, Speaker A: And is this sold out? This is sold out. Or wait, no, there are still some left. There are still two left. So again, it's tempting to call this a strong market. Ugo. So that is Lorna Mills. And that is on object Ugo with a work here.
00:53:51.858 - 00:54:25.328, Speaker A: Just a dog posted on x, interestingly. And here is Mewgi, or, sorry, manital with P with the one. And let's actually make this large p with the one doing the music. Pretty fun work. I love Mannadoll's work. There's something just beautiful and kind of fun and innocent and really satisfying about it. And there's the ducks going alongside.
00:54:25.328 - 00:54:48.704, Speaker A: I mean, it's just super charming. And who doesn't like cats? Well, I guess a lot of people actually talk to the moon. And so here's. Now, I believe what. What Mandal is doing here is making one bit versions on Zora, kind of. Again, we're playing with this remix and making copies. But here, I believe, is what's going on, as far as I remember.
00:54:48.704 - 00:55:08.422, Speaker A: And 270 minted, so a nice way of reworking a work. And black and white looks awesome, right? So just very cool. Here's another work in progress here. Let's see what it says. Here's my latest process of new pixel per pixel art. One bit xmusic with p with the one. See you soon on our zora.
00:55:08.422 - 00:55:28.870, Speaker A: So very cool here as well. And almost cool Polaroid kind of format here. Cats giving each other a massage there. And here, of course, is element Li with a work called rail. And so another interesting kind of minimal pixel artwork. Again, probably made on the phone. Here's a bit of a zoom in here.
00:55:28.870 - 00:55:44.894, Speaker A: Of course, we saw the cardboard at the start with the laser engraving, also by element lyrics. Here's Chaz. I'm gonna have to speed up a little bit here. And looks like space invaders on an arcade. And there you see it at the top there. Space. And so very cool there.
00:55:44.894 - 00:56:01.980, Speaker A: And just another arcade. And I believe this was an airdrop. 100 additions. Yeah, this was sent out. One was sent to me, and, yeah, this went to all previous collectors, I think. Very cool there. And here's green Ginger, who was doing a few interesting experiments.
00:56:01.980 - 00:56:26.276, Speaker A: This one kind of stood out to me, which is Stonehenge, displaying Stonehenge with 23, I guess, being maybe the year. When did this come out? 2024. And this is number 23 of, I think, this series here. We'll open it up here. So, as you can see, the Stonehenge rocks here. This is an edition of one for 17 tezos. Has anybody bought it? Actually, this is now it's being bid on.
00:56:26.276 - 00:56:38.970, Speaker A: I think it's at 22 50. So it's at auction. Very cool there. So a whole bunch of one of ones. Interestingly, maybe these are going at auction. Very cool. Nice pyramids there.
00:56:38.970 - 00:56:55.626, Speaker A: New year's celebration with the pyramids of Giza. The great pyramid of Giza. Very cool. How much did that go for? Nine tezos. So just cool series there. Nbswwit with an animated abstract here. Kind of has a pixel theme to it.
00:56:55.626 - 00:57:18.674, Speaker A: This was dropped on x. Pretty original look here, especially with contrasting with these kind of soft gradients in the background in the orange. And here's Lucas Lejeune with a new work ship fragment. This came out February 13. And as you can see, almost like a rocket or like a spaceship here. Kind of falling apart and coming back together in space. Interesting piece.
00:57:18.674 - 00:57:39.054, Speaker A: This is six tezos. And that sold to go, go lightest edition of ten. And here is another one, one day left. So kind of a. More of a, how would you call it? Mandal. It's like a mandala at the center of the mandala here. Working, I think, with programming in these.
00:57:39.054 - 00:57:59.318, Speaker A: So another work by Lucas Lejeune. Very interesting. Kind of like this style of programming, one gets a sense. So this is coma teba processing. And here it looks like just posting the code. Interestingly, I'm surprised Twitter actually lets you post the code like that. Sometimes I think they get worried about scripts, is why I say that.
00:57:59.318 - 00:58:15.994, Speaker A: Inserted into, say, a tweet or something. But let's look here. So just kind of more interesting. Animated abstract again, seemingly from programming. The fountain suggestive title here. Caving wild, wondering if there is a relationship there. But it looks more just like water, perhaps.
00:58:15.994 - 00:58:36.042, Speaker A: Hard to say, but the coloring makes it think of water. The title makes you think of Duchamp, of course. Edition of five for 250, selling one so far. And of course here's Ranex deer. This is euphoria number nine. It's part of that join drop that Rannix put out who is on the show last Wednesday. I am uploading the spaces.
00:58:36.042 - 00:59:16.066, Speaker A: By the way, acid boy with a quick, sorry, with a work here posted on x as you see this kind of vortex of rainbow in a black blob here on top. So cool work there. 77 likes, twelve tweets, 1400 views. Doing well. Mika Oladev, good night. So another variation here, you gotta love how Mika Oladev just hammers away at a subject and just does all the variations micah can come up with here. And I'm sure actually Mika can come up with more, but just doing a ton of different ways of a ton of different approaches at a kind of a simple subject here.
00:59:16.066 - 00:59:38.914, Speaker A: You know, the portrait of a person, kind of a bust of sorts here. Also doing very well. Market seems, again, don't want to leave this on for too long. Market seems interestingly resilient is what I'm trying to say here. From just a views perspective as well as from an actual financial perspective. You will wake up when I say three. This is Luis Andre Gamma.
00:59:38.914 - 00:59:54.634, Speaker A: So get ready, we're not going to stay too long because of the flashing. This is on exchange art. So Solana, just let that render here. It's a little intense and it's not sure. There it is. Okay, we finally got it here. There we go.
00:59:54.634 - 01:00:11.414, Speaker A: There is the high resolution version. Very intense. Here's another one. Luis Andre Gama. This is on object multi directional. This is Adtezos edition of one. So I think working with fractals here in a really interesting way here is Doctor version landscape 20.
01:00:11.414 - 01:00:59.344, Speaker A: So cool work here again, playing with these kind of simple forms here and then filling it with these kind of analog video glitch textures. Just very cool here from Doctor version edition of eight, selling for eight tezos and just listed Inivari. And I'm not sure if we've seen this one before, but I thought it was pretty cool. Kind of reminds me of like the Addams family, but this could just be an old, you know, kids picture that has been completely glitched out. But there's a couple of things I had mentioned here, which is it shows again the power of this kind of analog video glitch processing as a form of portraiture. We saw it with eight, so to great effect. And here we see here it's just a really interesting way of doing portraiture.
01:00:59.344 - 01:01:41.438, Speaker A: The other thing I'd notice here is, you see, these look like, you know, pixelation that's kind of dancing down here with these white. They look like white rectangles, almost like that kind of old school ratio, kind of wide ratio. What's interesting is that's now being transformed, seemingly through the analog video glitch process, which kind of bends them a little bit, giving them organic shape. So interesting conflation of techniques there, seemingly. I'm not exactly sure how it's made, but just seemingly interesting conflation. DJ Curo with a couple here. As we continue to run here, an interesting shadow drop shadow on the, or gradient coming in from the left.
01:01:41.438 - 01:01:56.494, Speaker A: Kind of nice and abstract, this piece here. Very interesting. Moltar, this is on object. And this is a edition of five for one tezos each. So pretty reasonably priced. And this is another one. This is in japanese writing.
01:01:56.494 - 01:02:23.956, Speaker A: So maybe kind of an anime here remix, as you see here. So interesting kind of fragment of an anime. Kind of remixed, as we have been discussing here, the theme of the show by now, for only zero, five ETH. And back to the source here. So great textures here. And there you go. And here's composition number 129 by Klaus.
01:02:23.956 - 01:02:42.060, Speaker A: More just beautiful violets here. And great pixelation here in front. So another interesting addition to the series. We have another. We do composition number 130. And again, selling 25 tezos. So Klaus continues to make these great sales here.
01:02:42.060 - 01:03:02.544, Speaker A: And beautiful. Right. Just kind of beautiful and keeping it interesting, keeping it original and just aesthetically awesome. And gifts. Easy to forget. Here is dither and slava three. So, of course, slava threes work in here, as we see this slicing off of the face here.
01:03:02.544 - 01:03:20.236, Speaker A: And this is five tezos edition of 20. So another cool collab. And is this. How many are left here? Only three left. So a very rich, rich market there. Like, the market's doing really well, is what I like. It's tempting to call it strong.
01:03:20.236 - 01:03:40.524, Speaker A: It is doing very well. Rat von Ratten. Now, is this new? This is February 10 put out by. It looks like relating to rada. This is Rat von Rattan, first Medici knight. This is by g I u g n f t. So maybe a kind of homage to ratta of sorts there.
01:03:40.524 - 01:04:04.966, Speaker A: I always love this kind of mylar protection kind of thing. You know, I've made nostalgia study drawings in the past where I'll incorporate that into the whole work. So very cool to see that here. Selling for 950 on primary edition of five. And here Bosque. Grazias with some more. So now I wish I brought up Bosque.
01:04:04.966 - 01:04:19.502, Speaker A: Grazias. Maybe I'll the next time I see a bossquet. Grazias. I'm going to try and remember to bring up Bosque's comments. What Bosque said is that this read. Remember I was saying if you saw last episode that I thought this was digitally treated. It's not.
01:04:19.502 - 01:04:39.802, Speaker A: It's how the negatives ended up. So these are simply kind of cutting and pasting negatives or placing negatives. So very interesting. Like this is what time has done to this negative. And it's gorgeous. I mean, just stunning red there. So another one addition of two tentezos gamers almost.
01:04:39.802 - 01:05:01.214, Speaker A: You can see a relationship between the two figures here and here. Hey Joe, take a walk on the wild side. And this is ten tezos edition of two. Another cool juxtaposition here. And you see here kind of backwards. Of course you're playing with negatives, film negatives, so you can flip things upside down. That wonderful backwards writing there.
01:05:01.214 - 01:05:23.332, Speaker A: Big fan of, big fan of that. And here, just another look at that red. Let's make that large. This is also an addition of two tourist excess and just wonderful contrasts here. Here you got the clear here, the filled in negative. And again, that incredibly rich red, not digitally treated again. I'll try and remember to go back to Busquet's comment there.
01:05:23.332 - 01:05:44.748, Speaker A: Next show. Next time we show Busquet's work. Mister shapeless. So again, back on the scene here had disappeared, at least from my feed for a little while. So great to see mister shapeless back on the AI art front. Another kind of wander structure there. And kanexapata with an interesting piece here.
01:05:44.748 - 01:06:09.416, Speaker A: Kind of elaborate AI art piece. Kind of has a bit of a feel of like a tibetan kind of cloth or something, or who, who knows what. But here as you get up close, you start to see those AI kind of lines and shapes. Beautiful colors here. This is mid journey five. This is mid journey v five. And selling for 20 tezos.
01:06:09.416 - 01:06:33.584, Speaker A: Nice work. And here's little cakes edition of 26 and selling at one tezos each and looking like selling out. So two are now on secondary at eight tazos. Let's actually, let's hit play here. Okay, so there is little tazos. Sorry, we could call, maybe we should call little cakes. Little tazos.
01:06:33.584 - 01:06:57.624, Speaker A: So anyways, it looks like the little cakes character here. And cool work. Interesting work. It kind of jumped out at me even when I saw the still version. Having fun here, only a tazos and selling out. Here's a strange thing. What's your cereal of choice? So here we see a hard juxtaposition of modern imagery in kind of Internet St.
01:06:57.624 - 01:07:23.844, Speaker A: Sorry, Renaissance style oil painting. And look at these. Incredible, again, like the flakes of the paint coming off are starting to take a life of their own here, as you'll see here. Very, very interesting. And there is the fruit loops within the bowl of cereal. Great color as usual. And you even see the light kind of shining here is lily illo gm, dear ones.
01:07:23.844 - 01:07:48.584, Speaker A: So again, just plain, very simple, with a chair that is being kind of reconstructed, reconfigured via AI, seemingly with a touch of architecture for a good measure. Kind of dosa architecture in there. And here's some beautiful kind of yellow and violet colors here. And great green shadows here. Different kinds of shadows. Very interesting piece. Lily illo.
01:07:48.584 - 01:08:10.020, Speaker A: Here's Anna Dart with a new one, I think, just posted on x. And here we again see the paint over top of the portraits here. And finally we have a work by zero zero nine. Sorry, demonic. Demonic ego. Demonic wear. I wonder, this almost looks like a collaboration here, because I'll show you who this reminds me of.
01:08:10.020 - 01:08:39.560, Speaker A: So this is interesting. So this is demonic ego and or, sorry, demon ego putting out a work here. And then I wonder if this is a bit of a collab, because I was thinking it was triple zero nine. Street culture seeps. Zero zero nine. And here again, this really interesting photo collage or, sorry, photo AI series here, kind of urban street series from zero zero nine. Interesting.
01:08:39.560 - 01:08:51.484, Speaker A: Those could all hang together there. RJ. Zero nine. Tez rock. Tez rock blues. This is from Robert Johnson's diary here. And here we have Mikey Wilson and Roman Dritz.
01:08:51.484 - 01:09:10.824, Speaker A: So maybe Roman dritz is the photographer. So remix is aplenty. Not exactly sure. And so there's the Tezos rock, the Tez rock blues, and there is a Robert Johnson type figure. So very interesting combination here. Not sure who Romand Ritz is. Let's take a very quick look here.
01:09:10.824 - 01:09:30.236, Speaker A: So, collaboration, maybe a photographer. So a collaboration here. Photography based artist with Mikey Wilson. Very cool. Give them a follow. And here's toques as we wrap up here. Just about to start, the space here, the remains of the day, which I remember being a very good movie in the nineties.
01:09:30.236 - 01:09:49.652, Speaker A: So here, a new AI artwork work, just interesting from tuks, as ever. And here's some physical work. This is Luciana Guerra wake. Always in fright is my last oil painting on canvas, 140 by 160, not minted. So if you're interested in choir. So cool oil painting. From Luciana Guerra, Mirko Barrici.
01:09:49.652 - 01:10:15.226, Speaker A: This was on Instagram, my work. Babel solo show. Look at how beautiful. You know, what's going on on Instagram. I continue to find incredibly noteworthy, because what I'm seeing here is it's just getting better and better. Like, you see this kind of mark making. This is the kind of mark making this brushwork here that I'm just kind of used to seeing in really good galleries.
01:10:15.226 - 01:10:49.032, Speaker A: Like, what is it called? What is it called? There's a very famous gallery here on Ohanienberger Strasse. What is it called? I haven't been there for so long, but just that kind of work, like, it's just really interesting, mark, like, impressive work here. And even the color that you saw on there in the black. Here's night gallery, well known gallery, I think, out of LA. Kind of an edgy work here, but it kind of grabbed my attention. Very interesting work. Who's the artist? Robert Nava.
01:10:49.032 - 01:11:01.210, Speaker A: So maybe this is a happy birthday. And this is a work by nava. So interesting piece here. Kind of a Pegasus or dragon of sorts. And this is. It's not gallery featuring Mary Lou Bell. So it's not gallery.
01:11:01.210 - 01:11:21.410, Speaker A: Continuing to find super interesting artists here. So kind of crying, you might say, to the extreme here with these fountains coming out of the eyes. And we have another one from it's not gallery. This is Chris Ragnar. So interesting. Kind of, not sure if this is airbrush, but kind of not even sure how I'd describe this. Kind of three dimensional here.
01:11:21.410 - 01:11:46.386, Speaker A: Almost has a bit of a graphic design feel to it, but all sorts of stuff. And then you see this distorted feat. It kind of looks like a character, actually. Pretty radical work, Chris Ragnar. And let's just see. Can we see how big this, you know, only 6400 followers, so not necessarily some huge account. Very interesting here is machine Kanye and Clipper ranks.
01:11:46.386 - 01:12:07.074, Speaker A: So it looks like Kanye west getting a haircut here. Interesting use of black here. Being painted in, I think. I'm not sure if we have video on that. And we see the process a little bit of. And there you see? And there is the original. So interestingly distorted there, too.
01:12:07.074 - 01:12:27.904, Speaker A: Super interesting as usual. From machine Maggie, Margaret Cowell's bar, Pimento, Barcelona, January 2024, six by eight. So another just interesting work with food. Is the subject matter. A great subject, as we see here. Just adore these tables full of food and objects. Just brilliant.
01:12:27.904 - 01:12:54.024, Speaker A: Parsa, mostagim, greasy endeavors. So here, kind of a homage to fast food and Coca Cola and everything done in CGI 6480 x 88,100 massifile from Parsa. Most of the very cool work here. So that, my friends, is your show. Thank you for joining me. Hopefully I see you at the Twitter space. It'll probably already have happened by the time you see this, almost guaranteed.
01:12:54.024 - 01:12:56.104, Speaker A: But until next time, take care.
