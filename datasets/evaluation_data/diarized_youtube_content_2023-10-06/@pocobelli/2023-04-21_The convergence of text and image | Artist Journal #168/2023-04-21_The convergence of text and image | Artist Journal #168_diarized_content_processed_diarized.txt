00:00:03.480 - 00:00:24.594, Speaker A: On a very compressed schedule here, ladies and gentlemen. And everyone, welcome back. I'm off to get my hair cut. And this is going to bring us back to our roots because I think it's going to be a shorter show by necessity. Artist journal, April 21, 2023. Broadcasting to the world from a sunny spring in Berlin, Germany. My name is Adrian Pokebelli.
00:00:24.594 - 00:00:52.750, Speaker A: Welcome back. And we have this beautiful John Carroll here who has really, I've just really liked this series. I was a little slow to the draw with John Carroll. He's one of the first artists you see when you go to object and when you start buying art and just checking out work on tazos and. Yeah, and he's kind of like, I was always kind of blown away. I mean, part of the reason I was slow is because I couldn't buy any of it because it was so expensive. Right.
00:00:52.750 - 00:01:40.964, Speaker A: So, I mean, he's got like a huge following from what I can tell. And. Yeah, so he's been putting out these really nice works almost, I'm tempted to call them, like, animating the furniture here. Kind of in the same province, we might say, as spugels Maskinen. Kind of animating objects, giving life to objects, you know, animating animus, you know, back to our greek philosophy here. It's giving life, as we were saying. It's like it's, it moves on its own, so it must be living, right? And it kind of, it kind of, I don't, it doesn't anthropomorphize, but it kind of gives life to objects and a little bit of personality, by the way, that they move.
00:01:40.964 - 00:02:19.768, Speaker A: There is a touch of retro here, but it's not strong. I mean, the iMac here theoretically could be brand new. I'd almost say the filing cabinet looks kind of retro, but they probably still sell those. I just haven't seen one I don't necessarily shop for. And I love the metal chair, actually, because I think we all, most of us will recognize this kind of chair. Same with the filing cabinet and same with the computer and same with the table. So the choices are, I would argue, I suspect, purposefully almost recognizable, which to me makes them actually more significant.
00:02:19.768 - 00:02:51.802, Speaker A: It's kind of a, more of a, this is a home office in a really kind of generic in the best sense way and with beautiful colors. And then these flowers that are easy to miss, at least for me. And I love actually this plug in here as well. And these flowers here providing a beautiful color. And again, just kind of breathing life into the scene. A spring. A spring portrait of a home office here from John Carroll, a very cool artist.
00:02:51.802 - 00:03:33.306, Speaker A: It's already at 420 tezos. And another, another lesson here in getting the auction going. So I mean, John Carroll doesn't need to put this at 25 tezos, but by putting it at 25 tezos makes it quick. Someone will bid on it right away because they'd love to get a John Carroll for 25 tezos. And before you know it, it's at 420. So again, this artist, the strategy by artists to make a low price to get the auction going, enforcing the collector's hands if they want that work. So I think it's just a great strategy, as I say that to myself as much as anyone here.
00:03:33.306 - 00:04:02.696, Speaker A: And we've been looking at John Carroll's work recently and I noticed, I thought these all feel like they're part of the same series and they are living rooms. So we saw this awesome one here. And what I notice in both of these, this zero, zero and zero, zero, two. The colors of the screens really add a lot to the work. Like this green here in a weird way, kind of makes the work for me, the color. And I actually see that here too, this great purple. So.
00:04:02.696 - 00:04:25.964, Speaker A: And even the blues of the bottles. So very nice color here. Very bright colors which tend to do really well. And I mean very prolific compared to. Because I remember this came out at the hen reunion, this awesome one which I just missed. The windows still life number 105. So John hasn't put out a ton, but in the last few days is putting out a lot and it's looking beautiful.
00:04:25.964 - 00:04:58.106, Speaker A: So how cool is that? A couple of comments here that I want to highlight. Another comment from Runetun on hasdrubal. On hasdrubal waffle. Additionally, something I really love about his work is that he is a master of reference. And we see tons of counterculture reference in Hasdrubal's work. All the subculture references work together and create a hasdrubal verse that makes sense that only he could create. Sometimes when people use cultural reference, it doesn't always feel very cohesive or authentic.
00:04:58.106 - 00:05:12.494, Speaker A: That's interesting. Yes. I mean, it does feel quite authentic. With hasdrubal waffle. I have used Devo, actually, in a previous piece. I will try and dig that up. Actually, that's an early phone work which I actually, that was interesting.
00:05:12.494 - 00:05:31.046, Speaker A: I sold that as a physical. I printed it out. And there's a guy that worked at factory here, which is a workspace. And he said he used to work beside. And I had a show there and the work was right beside him at his workspace. And he said he used to work beside it every day. And then he really wanted to buy it.
00:05:31.046 - 00:05:52.482, Speaker A: So that was great. Really cool programmer dude. And he has it on his wall at home now, which is totally awesome. So continuing on, thank you for the comments, everybody. Runetune, human boy, haligon on and on that great orbital track. And big shout out to. Speaking of techno, big shout out to DJ Curo, who we were messaging.
00:05:52.482 - 00:06:14.698, Speaker A: And he used to dj at Trezor like in 2001 here in Berlin. So how cool is that? So you never know who's watching. And it just shows the world is small. So anyways, big shout out to everybody. DJ Kuro, everybody. Runetune, human boy. And here's Kiro watching the show.
00:06:14.698 - 00:06:32.092, Speaker A: And analog mod. So you see some of the synths here. Look at that. That looks like a 303 over here. And then a big analog modular synth system. And there is artist journal. There is the show with Kiro's piece there on the tv.
00:06:32.092 - 00:06:49.604, Speaker A: So that is an awesome setup over in LA, I believe. So. Very cool. Always watching your shows out here in LA. Big shout out, Kiro, if you're watching, that's awesome. I want to highlight this. I mean, it's not every day you see a Henri Rousseau go hit the auction block.
00:06:49.604 - 00:07:13.464, Speaker A: And I had never actually seen this one. I don't think it's called the flamingos. Les flaments by Henri Rousseau. The great Le Douanier. He was a customs officer and I don't think he was particularly recognized in his lifetime. Like, you know, Picasso recognized him in the surrealist later. But I think he.
00:07:13.464 - 00:07:37.162, Speaker A: He never really. I mean, I think he was a customs officer, as far as I understand the story. And we'll go deeper, actually. And Douanier means customs, as far as I remember. We'll go to the Wikipedia maybe next show and do a bit more of a deeper dive. Anyways, Henri Rousseau, that incredible artist. Sometimes seen as a kind of naive artist, quote unquote naif artiste.
00:07:37.162 - 00:08:02.324, Speaker A: Naif or folk artist is how I would put it. Yeah. So one of Henri Rousseau's glorious canvases are hitting the auction block. They expect 30 million. I wouldn't be surprised if this went further. Christie's is going to do it. And which shows flamingos at a lily filled lake is guaranteed to sell and will be offered between 20 and 30 million.
00:08:02.324 - 00:09:00.056, Speaker A: I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it doubled that far ahead of the artist's previous auction record of 3 million pounds. So you see, the last time Henri Rousseau came to the auction block was 1993, and that went for $4.4 million. Usually it is, says Max Carter, Christie's vice chair of 20th and 21st century art, a prime example of Rousseau's sought after jungle paintings, which are entirely imagined as the artist never left France. And there's a very important detail because that is part of the reasons why the surrealists loved Rousseau, because he never saw a jungle, as far as I understand, entirely imagined. And you see, even, and I hope I'll write a note here to go into that next episode, because Ernst also did kind of jungle painting tributes to Rousseau. And here we see the artists responding to artists over decades.
00:09:00.056 - 00:09:32.556, Speaker A: Right? So anyways, very, very cool. I'll be excited to watch that. That's May 11, so in a couple of weeks here. Speaking of auctions, congrats to Sumi Reusi. And let's actually make these bit bigger here, who sold on super rare for half an ETH horsegaze. And I just want to highlight this comment because I think it speaks to a lot of the experience of artists. I feel both happy and proud that horsegaze is the first piece of the collection of Dear Yagi's Kosabique at super rare.
00:09:32.556 - 00:10:04.248, Speaker A: I'd lost my faith and motivation recently and your belief in my art gave me the strength to continue. Again, thank you from the heart. So this could often happen to you as an artist. So I think it's a reminder that just because you're not selling work doesn't mean people aren't looking and people aren't appreciating. Because if you don't make a sale for a long time, it can feel that way. So anyways, big congrats. To sum, who makes wonderful, wonderful art on object and super rare? Probably other places too.
00:10:04.248 - 00:10:34.672, Speaker A: Here's Matias la Plata working and it kind of goes with our Henri Rousseau, you know, drawing straight from the imagination drawing. And I follow Matthias, by the way, that's a Twitter glitch. Drawing without references is easier, apparently. So anyways, so here's the hamburglar. Beautifully done here. And you see actually all the just beauty of Matthias pencil work here. So anyways, just beautiful work from Matthias.
00:10:34.672 - 00:10:52.952, Speaker A: Looking forward to seeing that. And drawing from the imagination without references is easier. Thursday of look at what I did. So these look like stickers. It's not absolutely clear. So Flora Marquez is going to be on our next Twitter spaces on Wednesday. So do check that out.
00:10:52.952 - 00:11:34.004, Speaker A: I will check if these are stickers or not. Huge fan. And anyways, just great to see this work that we see all the time turn physical. And don't these look like, don't these look like the sketches that we're seeing on almost a daily basis here? Like especially this one here. And it's almost like the graph paper, the layer underneath has been removed. So here is almost another strategy that a digital artist can employ, which is saying, okay, for the digital work, I'll put the graph paper behind, but for a physical maybe I want to get rid of that and you can, so. And it almost makes a new work, interestingly, especially when you cut out the, when you change the crop.
00:11:34.004 - 00:12:00.956, Speaker A: So interesting. Looking good, Flora. And here's just another, you know, art in the world sort of piece. This is killer acid collaborating. And I think purple drank works with this juice company or drink company, humble Seed Brewing company. So maybe this is beard beer, psychedelic bug juice and humble sea Brewing company. So anyways, that looks really cool too.
00:12:00.956 - 00:12:27.640, Speaker A: And there you see dank purple smooth tipa. So it looks really good. And even just the presentation here is awesome. You get the full picture. So really cool and more just kind of physical world stuff. Doctor version, put out this awesome. Actually, let me just show you here, Artmatterco is the account and Doctor virgin put out this awesome.
00:12:27.640 - 00:13:19.714, Speaker A: See if there's any volume here of a pen plotter in action. And look at how big this can work. And this looks like it's maybe using like charcoal or graphite perhaps. Maybe it's a marker but it looks more like graphite or something. So again, pen plotters, they seem to be a kind of like, they feel like a holy grail of sorts, going from digital to physical because this could in theory be some kind of, okay, digital file, let's say. And then you put it with some texture and turns into a gorgeous work of art physically, right? So I mean you could even, as we say, climb the ladder, make your digital work but with the intention of doing it this way and then forget about the digital and then you're just left with the physical. Anyways, I just love seeing these pen plotters at work.
00:13:19.714 - 00:13:47.074, Speaker A: And here is just kind of a studio shot from Somfei. It's that time again. First week of May, I'll be building two times spectralume and two times hither dither. So here, look at this japanese hardware here, video enhancer and more. And these look ancient, don't they? So just really cool to see the glitch artists. Put me down for a spectral max capacity. Pretty cool to see the glitch artists at work in the studio there.
00:13:47.074 - 00:14:02.366, Speaker A: Moving along here, Ed Marolla, demon sounds. And let's see if we can get some. And there's kind of a demon figure. More hardware. And there is a devil going up. Interesting piece as ever. It's going to be interesting.
00:14:02.366 - 00:14:40.214, Speaker A: It's going to be interesting to see where Ed is in like twelve months as far as style. And of course, Ed works with audio too, I think professionally, if I'm not mistaken. Cool dithering down here. It's turning into like some pretty high end art over here, if you ask me. So we were speaking about textures too here, which is something that Ed does extremely well. And you gotta love just how kind of rough this is. Again, it's painterly.
00:14:40.214 - 00:15:07.138, Speaker A: Texture and painterliness seem to kind of collide. And Ed's the only person I know that really plays with this kind of moving background like this. If you know another artist, of course, doesn't mean he's the only person that does it. But anyways, it looks great in this kind of hilarious devil figure. And really nice color in this piece as well. And this, like, look at, again, look at the texture up here with this kind of light source above. It's really stunning.
00:15:07.138 - 00:15:38.902, Speaker A: So it's really, really going somewhere with Ed. Addition of 100, buy now for four and 87 left. Uri J with a new one is well minted yesterday. An edition of ten for 13 tezos. And maybe we. Did we look at this? No, because this is minted yesterday. So, no, this is a kind of what looks like almost like a pinball machine of sorts, but maybe something different and just kind of a living room setting, looking out a window.
00:15:38.902 - 00:15:52.614, Speaker A: I don't think we looked at this. Maybe we did. I was getting everything. No, this is new. So this is juice time by Uri J. It looks great, I think. I wonder if this background was used before for.
00:15:52.614 - 00:16:06.624, Speaker A: It felt like another piece. But anyways, cool work. Great. Again, look at almost. We're back to this texture thing and this. Look at it in here. And the plants and everything in this cool drawing taped on the wall way high.
00:16:06.624 - 00:16:28.200, Speaker A: And again, playing with space as well, and perspective and everything. This big kind of key over here. Really interesting work. Again, these two artists here, you could really hang together, couldn't you? Mental noise with a work celebrating. 420 here. Fire it up. 420.
00:16:28.200 - 00:16:56.826, Speaker A: And here is, I think, often uses a rabbit. And just kind of a cool, nice color and just a cool composition of someone at home here. So celebrating with all sorts of references and paraphernalia. Buy for ten tazos. And that is on secondary. Sold out at 420, of course, to many familiar accounts here in half an hour. So congrats to mental noise.
00:16:56.826 - 00:17:41.954, Speaker A: Looking great. And here is Mikey Wilson, backyard portrait, also seemingly celebrating 420 here, edition of two at auction for only five right now, a digital painting. And there seems to be Mikey de la creme with his vanguard balaclava and a tazose pendant. So anyways, pretty cool from Moses, Herzog and Dan control with a new animal, this time an insect praying. I'm so regal, so mantis and so vain that I start praying to myself. So anyways, kind of a cool, another cool artwork with a very detailed gradient in the background and underneath. So this is interesting as well.
00:17:41.954 - 00:18:02.840, Speaker A: Almost creates a shadow where this. Maybe it's a praying mantis. It looks like a grasshopper to me, but maybe a praying mantis with all this other stuff. This is more than a grasshopper. So anyways, buy for two tezos, edition of 100. Looking very interesting as usual. A few works by skitchism, who is on super rare.
00:18:02.840 - 00:18:20.714, Speaker A: And I'm not sure if we've looked at skitchism's work on super rare. This is pretty new. This is from last week, April 14. Prove them wrong. And this is part of a series called Animal Instinct. And we're gonna look at the other one here, too. Now, skitchism is an artist that many of you are gonna be familiar with from object.
00:18:20.714 - 00:18:44.764, Speaker A: It's one of the first artists I kind of discovered and that I started buying with some really cool psychedelic illustration, I guess I'd call it. And you see it here with like the eye and the smoke coming out of the eye. So this is from animal instinct. Prove them wrong. And no reserve here. And here is another one. This is the first one, the philosopher reserve of 0.66.
00:18:44.764 - 00:19:02.082, Speaker A: This came out April 11, so a few days before. So a new series here by skitchism. And. Yeah, so looking pretty nice. Interesting texture here. So again, playing with animals. And here, let's just give it the full treatment here, the full screen treatment.
00:19:02.082 - 00:19:32.784, Speaker A: Interesting peace sign. Almost looks like mayan art a little bit with the kind of chunkiness here, which is kind of interesting, maybe, you know, from Indonesia. Vintage pop, psychedelic art, but almost a bit of a mayan feel, isn't it, to the art. And here's some others that we missed. These are from, you know, March and maybe even earlier. So you're better than this reserve of 0.36. So interesting, almost change of colors because on object.
00:19:32.784 - 00:20:04.224, Speaker A: And we'll look at some point at sketchism's work on object again, but usually it's kind of darker colors, even darker than this. So here's another one. So just kind of a quick tour of skitchism's work. And this sold for 36 ETH $686 on March 10. And here is another one falling down also by skitchism. So experimenting when moving over to super rare, interestingly. And this also sold for 36 in March.
00:20:04.224 - 00:20:39.334, Speaker A: And here is some more flora marquez with another work. So it's almost like those what seemed like stickers was this top layer cut out. And here you have a character here with some pretty awesome, almost sky Goodman sneakers walking across the clouds here. So this is an edition of one 4200 by mentalist 420 on secondary. I will float above and thoughts that make me feel bad. So I will float above the thoughts that make me feel bad. So cool work.
00:20:39.334 - 00:21:06.130, Speaker A: And here's another one. Why everything is so expensive? So speaking, maybe to what many people are experiencing, everybody's experiencing these days around the world, inflation, maybe. Why is everything so expensive? So a really nice piece. And you got to love the walking hand. Brilliant edition of one. And this sold for 20 to new flark two. So they keep moving out the door, as one would expect.
00:21:06.130 - 00:21:31.880, Speaker A: Daniel W. Untitled, white and yellow over black, number three. So I'd say a rarer animated work by Daniel W. Kind of playing with the style a little bit and playing with the color and everything. I'd call it slightly more painterly. And it looks pretty cool. An interesting strategy for painting, which is, you know, turn it into a gif.
00:21:31.880 - 00:22:00.938, Speaker A: And it probably does make it a lot more interesting of an image by just giving it a slight animation. Kind of reminiscent in a very distant way to Basquiat with just going all across and sketching. Even hasdrubal waffle here with just kind of doodling, as hed struble put it. Untitled, white and yellow over black, number 319 20 by 1920. MP 412 frames per second. One of one. Let's just see what this sold for.
00:22:00.938 - 00:22:32.984, Speaker A: Sold for 50 and right after it was listed for 320 at 325. Sold within two minutes. And this is interesting here too, you know, back to you never know who's watching when it was listed the first time. Maybe nobody saw it. I don't get all my notifications on object, so this is not a bad strategy either, as an artist, which is just to relist, relist the next day sells in two minutes, you know. So there you go. Now, we looked at this before, but we're going to look at a few more works by Claire Dike.
00:22:32.984 - 00:23:08.094, Speaker A: Clar. I think we'd call it asemic calligraphy, and I think a lot of this is physical. We looked at this piece, which is a stunning piece. When you look at it here, you know, and it's kind of a simple formula to a certain degree of why it might work, which is a textured background. You see how this black background kind of has kind of rubbed out in certain areas. It's not perfectly kind of flat black. And then you just put some nice, beautiful, kinda, you know, this asemic writing brush strokes on top, and it just looks stunning, actually.
00:23:08.094 - 00:23:27.326, Speaker A: So we've already looked at this buy now for, .5.4 reserve of 0.2. I think we've looked at this one, but just to ground you in, the other ones, we're going to look at. So here's another one. So, playing with style a little bit, it's not like they're all in the same style here. Let me just quickly check the clock. We are doing well.
00:23:27.326 - 00:23:51.870, Speaker A: Like, the brushwork is fantastic. So, again, calligraphy seems to be how this is made. But you see how good this, you know, this looks, again, like museum. Something that could be in a contemporary or just a museum period. Like, it's beautiful. So really nice work from Claire acemic writing calligraphy. Original artwork by Clara Dike.
00:23:51.870 - 00:24:23.900, Speaker A: So this sold. This is from December, but I wanted us to look at actually some of these. We don't know for how much, but just to give us a little taste here, this is the foundation page, so obviously on super rare now, too. So here's just examples of asemic writing. And for those that are new, asymmetric writing, as far as I understand, it, is writing that looks like writing, but doesn't mean anything. It's actually. It's kind of using the visual components of writing, like here.
00:24:23.900 - 00:24:45.934, Speaker A: But it's actually. It's not saying anything. It's just writing that looks like writing using the, what I want to call the visuality of writing, the visual quality of writing, and playing with that. So that is really interesting. I mean, it's kind of one of the other big themes we talk about. We talk about. We talk about the.
00:24:45.934 - 00:25:38.682, Speaker A: We see an AI, we talk about mediums traveling through the mediums and everything. And another kind of big theme, I think, that's happening weirdly. And I think we have to observe and just kind of keep tabs on is this kind of convergence between writing and visual and vision and art, shall we say, for lack of better of visual. There seems to be a collision in the sense that now you can make visual works of art with a prompt. Right. And even in reverse, we can get a prompt from a work of art using, say, in midjourney, the describe function. So this is kind of another angle at it, which is literally taking writing and turning it into a visual thing.
00:25:38.682 - 00:26:32.562, Speaker A: This is a big theme, too. This is kind of a, what we might call a major theme, too, something I've been really interested in for a long time. The peloponnesian war series plays with this idea of how we read. How do we read? Because here. And it's kind of going on here, too, because you're kind of wanting to read this, right? And it's like, how do we read? Information is kind of the bigger picture and, you know, it probably goes to different parts of the brain, but it kind of, at one point it's probably unified and then goes to other parts. I'm guessing, you know, the language component and then the visual understanding component. Anyways, we have a few works here, so it's interesting to see they all do unify in style, but they are kind of slightly different approaches to style, which is interesting because you get the sense, like, look at this.
00:26:32.562 - 00:26:55.884, Speaker A: I mean, this is just a beautiful work, a calligraphy painting. We'll see if it's sold. I mean, this is some very nice work, and I believe it's physical. So this looks like it's on black paper, perhaps, or maybe it's just a black layer. We're not sure. I'm not sure if this is on canvas or what. But again, this is very good looking work.
00:26:55.884 - 00:27:15.496, Speaker A: This was made in March, so just a month ago. So this was all missed. So catching up here. Here's some more. This is from February 26, 2023. So more just asymic writing. And again, you got to love this kind of physical paper in the background here, even here.
00:27:15.496 - 00:27:37.564, Speaker A: And this could even be the photo, the light hitting the paper, sometimes it'll create it darker, but it all kind of works beautifully here. So I think we have some more. Here's another one. Kind of inverted brother. And I think the other one was called. Was it father? Yes. Excerpts from personal speeches given to me transcribed VHS recordings.
00:27:37.564 - 00:28:21.944, Speaker A: So that's interesting, too. So using VHS recordings, transcribed. Now, you wonder, is this writing or is this someone looking at a speech and then making marks based on the emotion of hearing the speech? So again, we're kind of back to language and, you know, written language versus visual language. So a lot kind of unifies with this asemic writing. And I think what that a in, I think in Greek is no so not. And semic probably means something like meaning or something kind of no meaning asemic writing. Okay, here is another one declared, this is from January 2023.
00:28:21.944 - 00:28:58.572, Speaker A: And so another cool work here using a thicker brush. So anyways, very cool work from Clar merchant Coppola with a work the bends. And also kind of playing with words and vision here. This so pretty cool kind of twists up these words here. That kind of stretch together word art. And so again, this kind of shares a similar theme, shall we say, as the pigeons come to my balcony here, Francois Gamma edition of 15. And this is pretty cool for three tezos.
00:28:58.572 - 00:29:24.566, Speaker A: So continuing the experimentation here. And a triangle that gets turned into a different shapes here. Chi Moscou Jackson had an early series, I was on his website of platonic solids. It kind of reminds me of that ge. So anyways, cool work from placewise gamma. All available. Another take on the walking figure.
00:29:24.566 - 00:29:42.310, Speaker A: And here, this is an edition of 15, also all available. Placewise gamma has been releasing a ton of work here. So this is looking pretty good here, too. So anyways, interesting take from Francois Gamma. And a beautiful work here by Lorna Mills. Look at this. Let me see if I can make this bigger.
00:29:42.310 - 00:30:17.574, Speaker A: I can't. Can I do this? I can do this. So this is posted on Twitter and playing with a black mask. Again, she uses the marquee tool, from what I understand from her explanation on Twitter the other day to someone who asked. And here you see what looks like a cave, maybe a grotto of sorts with light shining in. And so anyways, and you almost see just sunlight coming in and some rocks turned into just a beautiful work there. And here are some works by Max Drecker that we also missed April 4.
00:30:17.574 - 00:30:41.732, Speaker A: So just some interesting abstracts and not animated still. And kind of a different take. Again, bringing a different style to a different blockchain here. So anyway, so here is one dualistic and part of the grid collection. And here is the grid collection. And buy now for 0.1. So reasonable buy now price.
00:30:41.732 - 00:31:16.232, Speaker A: And here's another. So you can get some for the collectors out there. You can get some cool abstracts for very reasonable price from someone who's done a lot of abstract artwork, geometric abstract artwork. So here's another beautiful one on foundation from Max Drecker. So two available in this collection there. And the guy I like to call the master of psychedelic abstraction, acid boy and laboratory five, is available on object, I believe. So here it is another just cool take.
00:31:16.232 - 00:31:46.590, Speaker A: So again, taking one theme and just hammering away at it, sort of like Francois gamma does with the walking figure acidboy does with this kind of animated abstraction. And so this is available for 150 tezos, edition of ten. Is that on? That's on secondary. Sold out on primary for ten tezos. So very cool there. And is this new? Yeah, that was just released yesterday. And here's another interesting animated abstract work.
00:31:46.590 - 00:32:12.206, Speaker A: This is by Renki. Hakata is the name of the piece, edition of ten, none sold yet. And just kind of. So you see, like, you can again make these shows out of what these artists are doing. Like, you can start to group things into themes here. So, yeah, all these hypothetical shows exist in my mind here. This is Hakata by Renki, whose work I think we just recently started looking at.
00:32:12.206 - 00:32:33.994, Speaker A: I found this on Twitter. I don't know if I've ever seen v four w anko holographic machine. I don't know if this is generative. It might be. Let's quickly open here. This might be generative art, but it's an addition of seven, so it probably is, but it's not FX hash is what I was wondering. So anyways, cool work.
00:32:33.994 - 00:33:04.322, Speaker A: Buy for 0.88 tazo cents edition of 15. So pretty reasonable there for a pretty cool artist. One left. And so, yeah, so anyways, cool animated abstract work. And here's their work in their collection here of their work, their creations. So anyways, playing with color here recently, media artists, sound and visual are being realized in real time by manipulating of self programmed algorithms.
00:33:04.322 - 00:33:22.760, Speaker A: Sounds almost like screen recording of some kind is going of on. Look at Teigenhoff with this awesome work. Edition of five for a Tezos 50. This is a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful work. I couldn't believe they're still available. I think I have, like, a Tezos 20 in my wallet. Otherwise I would pick it up.
00:33:22.760 - 00:33:36.900, Speaker A: This looks great. So very, very nice piece. You even gotta love, like, the seeming jpeg artifacts here and everything. Beautiful color all about it. I love it. Tiegenhof. This is wonderful.
00:33:36.900 - 00:33:58.748, Speaker A: And there are three left, so get it while you can. Here's an edition of seven for one. So again, it's pretty awesome work by Tigenhoff. I guess that's why I didn't see it, because I recognize the name Tiegenhof, gift creator and collector. Some couple of very nice works. They pair well together there too. Don't be so bassio.
00:33:58.748 - 00:34:17.906, Speaker A: We saw something very similar to this yesterday, but I think this one's different. Gif of a flower. Let me make sure. Here it is. I'm gonna cut the volume here, but really nice. Kinda trippy flower here. Kind of makes me dizzy looking at that thing.
00:34:17.906 - 00:34:38.776, Speaker A: So anyways, cool work from don't be so vazya. I think a variation on yesterday's, which is why I brought it up again. Well, it's a variation. Future funky springs. My special piece to join the event, spring fever pixel art. So I guess there's a spring event. Maybe that's why John Carroll put the flowers at the start there, perhaps.
00:34:38.776 - 00:34:56.410, Speaker A: So some pixel art by p one. Interesting as ever. Spring fever. So maybe spring colors here. So that is cool. I guess this is going on for anybody that's interested. Part of the pixel scrapbook edition of 35 for Tezos ten green ginger with another interesting piece.
00:34:56.410 - 00:35:22.222, Speaker A: Deconstructed deconstruced abstraction. And this is pretty cool how it all kind of separates here. So, you know, sophisticated pixel art from green ginger. I think this is on secondary now. Yeah, so pixel art, I mean it just sells like crazy. Mech txt big success story in pixel art here. And so with a kind of a new piece posted on Twitter, I believe.
00:35:22.222 - 00:35:46.902, Speaker A: Kind of nice and rough in here. I really like this, you know, grass or whatever it is that's so interesting developments here. This almost looks like fog, maybe a lighthouse of sorts, but not positive. Anyways, very interesting works. Cloud's almost reminiscent of tomb and battle. Interestingly here, just here. And then you get more dithering here.
00:35:46.902 - 00:36:25.494, Speaker A: Anyways, very nice piece. And some interesting stuff going on in the corner here from Mech TXT. And here's a collaboration. Arrival of piece number 14 from perceiver here we are proud to announce our first collaboration piece, Methuselah by Michael Macasso. A great artist, he has done a great work of art for us and we're welcoming him into our art house as the second member after Oax Lizen, give them a follow. So anyways, looks like classic Mech TXT type scale and dithering. And maybe with some animation inside.
00:36:25.494 - 00:36:52.104, Speaker A: So maybe that's where the collaboration is coming from. Mech doesn't do a ton of collaboration from what I remember. And here is mech. Retro Manny is putting together a cyberpixel anniversary collection. I think I'm going to be hosting a spaces next week if everything goes according to plan with some pixel artists, so that'll be fun. With retro Manny, I assume we'll be there too. Eight bit inspired soundtracks.
00:36:52.104 - 00:37:09.848, Speaker A: So looks like they're working on a piece and also some sound. Trying to see what synth that is. That looks like maybe that's a novation synth, so probably just a MIDI controller here. So anyways, more studio shots. Looking interesting here. Cool piece by mech. Txt next.
00:37:09.848 - 00:37:22.332, Speaker A: Nearly ready for the drop next week. So very cool. Rinny finish. Reverse sad. So maybe this was the piece that was posted yesterday. One day they will accept your imperfections. Thank you.
00:37:22.332 - 00:37:44.786, Speaker A: You are breathtaking. So anyways, big shout out to Rinny fish. And here is just another really cool original work from her. And yeah, who was celebrating 420 yesterday? And let's just see how it did here. So it's just minted. So not listed yet. Continuing on, let's see if this loads up.
00:37:44.786 - 00:38:16.644, Speaker A: I was having issues with this piece loading up here. Klaus, try it again and we'll come back to this in a second and we'll see if it loads. Sometimes foundation, they don't cache. So sometimes it can be hard to show their work. Here's Kurt Hussle collective apos artifact. We found this lodged in your brain near your frontal lobe. So kind of keeping with the alien visit sort of theme again, I think art Bell would be all over this series here.
00:38:16.644 - 00:38:40.404, Speaker A: Pretty cool. I mean, beautiful, beautiful textures and, you know, glitch and all. You know, all this stuff that we remember from the nineties here. Let me see if that last piece showed up. It shows up okay. Close analog method. So interesting piece here too, with seemingly some video and some glitch and everything.
00:38:40.404 - 00:38:55.704, Speaker A: Mysterious abstract work. I guess we'd call it animated abstract. Interesting experimentation with kind of the framing here too and everything. Buy now. Price set for 0.1. So very reasonable. Buy now for 0.1.
00:38:55.704 - 00:39:13.464, Speaker A: And so anyways, very cool. Made with various analog video gear combined with no input feedback post processed in Davinci resolve. And again there is KHC. And another one glitch. David shag the shag with feathers. So smooth. Okay, so buy now edition of four.
00:39:13.464 - 00:39:28.794, Speaker A: Very low edition. Kind of looks like a tv of some kind. Tv channel or something. Not sure what's going on. So anyways, kind of cool glitch work there. A guide to british birds. Glitched is the series.
00:39:28.794 - 00:39:51.280, Speaker A: And of course, big fan of acid soup series here, glitched sushi. And so maybe deviating, expanding beyond the junk food a little bit with this one here from acid soup. Really great. Just rich textures again. And edge Q. Big shout out to edgeq. Three is the magic number by de la Soul.
00:39:51.280 - 00:40:11.724, Speaker A: Another nineties reference here. And here it is. I mean, brings a lot of us back. So just kind of a cool work with a song and let's see, maybe a remix of sorts. It feels like a remix. Really slow version. It may come back.
00:40:11.724 - 00:40:41.992, Speaker A: I couldn't get it to load later in the track here. But anyways, check out edge queue's work and often remixing tracks here. Really good artist. Cool dude from I think Puerto Rico who joined us on a Twitter spaces a week and a half ago. A great way to get to know people. I highly recommend the Twitter spaces. If you feel like you're not getting enough, if you just are, you know, maybe you're new, join the Twitter spaces, come on stage and you know, whoever's there will be introduced to you.
00:40:41.992 - 00:41:03.878, Speaker A: And it's just a great way of kind of introducing yourself. Here's some others celebrating 420. Panama sativa from edge Q also with a song. So this is so, yeah. So this is edition of five for five tazos. Very cool. I love this trading card, you know, motif trope.
00:41:03.878 - 00:41:22.290, Speaker A: And here's another one. Indica land race. Very good. 920 23 tie stick tc indica. So anyways, very cool. Edition of five. And also with some cool with some almost like feels like thick tracks here from edge queue.
00:41:22.290 - 00:41:41.478, Speaker A: So very cool. Look at Martin Joe, also celebrating 420 here, trippie bears come and join the trip of the trippie bears. This looks like a GLB or something, right? And there you go. That's hilarious. Underneath the couch there. And there's a coffee maker too. And various objects here.
00:41:41.478 - 00:42:20.656, Speaker A: Here. Anyways, big shout out to Martin Jo, who's been pretty much watching this program from the start, which is totally awesome. Trippie bears from the kinky bears for the metaverse. And clownvamp with a piece that I missed the other day. The simple ways and kind of a painterly approach here we see some texture here. I mean, what's so interesting about this kind of texture, this kind of emulating paint texture, we see it with white solitude too, is how convincing it's becoming. Like brushstrokes that were made digitally or maybe even with AI before, like early AI weren't as convincing as we're starting to see now.
00:42:20.656 - 00:42:37.620, Speaker A: Like they've kind of. It feels like the. Whatever algorithms they're using to create the AI brushstrokes are really working. So the simple ways. And a small story here from Clownvamp. Edition of 91s for 25 tezos and all sold out. Let's just see what happened here.
00:42:37.620 - 00:43:09.874, Speaker A: All transferred, probably transferred. There's to maybe to collectors and who knows, collectors and friends and everything. Anyways, cool work. Painterly work by clownvamp and just some work by strange thing AI menswear wool spring collection so look at this. Almost feels like a spaceship here on this one. And this gorgeous Nike watch, which just looks totally persuasive here. And their chat GPT is activated.
00:43:09.874 - 00:43:40.954, Speaker A: And just more work from strange thing using textures. Really different kinds of textures here. It's wool and playing with wool textures, basically. And anyway, just really cool work from strange thing as ever. That almost looks like a self portrait at the end, there's. And continuing on, a new work by Mister Shapeless. This looks like it's using, like, you know, maybe newer versions of AI.
00:43:40.954 - 00:44:06.330, Speaker A: Like maybe this is mid journey five. It looks slightly more photo real, just slightly, slightly less painterly. So anyways, a new take on our figure. Looking off into the distance here. GN from Mister Shapeless, keeping it interesting. And Oli Isikowski with a physical work here. Just kind of a cool, you know, physical painting here on dark paper, seemingly.
00:44:06.330 - 00:44:20.690, Speaker A: I think it is. Or it's dark paint around the side, but it kind of looks like. Or maybe there's a dark underpainting. Either way, it looks great. Also, someone who's been watching this show almost from the start, going back to our roots, this show. Everyone, thank you for watching. I'm off to get a haircut.
00:44:20.690 - 00:44:22.970, Speaker A: Hope you have a great weekend. Until next time, take.
