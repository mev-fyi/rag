00:00:05.880 - 00:00:28.886, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody. As I try new ways of doing this program, I have. Sometimes the simplest things are the hardest to figure out. Again, I called it the Copernican revolution when I was painting, spending two years on a painting, and then one night decided, I'm gonna make something in a night. Well, I'm doing the same thing here. I put a time deadline. A time deadline.
00:00:28.886 - 00:00:46.074, Speaker A: You're getting all the errors and everything here. Welcome back. Artist Journal, April 1, 2024. This year, we are already in Q two. My name is Adrian Pokebelly. We are in Q two. If we are running a business here, we are starting Q two.
00:00:46.074 - 00:01:21.514, Speaker A: I am attempting to make this into a business, one thing at a time. Let's first see if I can make a little more time in my life. And I think, again, I'm incredibly excited. It brings me back to the beginning of this show where really, as you know, I started probably a whole bunch of shows with I don't have much time, but we gotta go because this is it. And it's kind of like this today. So all to say, I hope you're having a wonderful Easter weekend. As, again, my first words of the day to you here today.
00:01:21.514 - 00:01:36.888, Speaker A: It was a nice weekend here. The weather has come out. It's like an early summer here. It showed up just in time for Good Fridays. So it is a lot of fun here. It's a holiday, too, as well. So perhaps part of my motivation for making a shorter show.
00:01:36.888 - 00:02:19.324, Speaker A: But again, I'm incredibly excited by this whole idea of doing this. And I'm running off to the gym, and if I don't finish this within an hour, I will miss the class. So I am very excited for this. So all to say, Kristen Roos and a couple of things on this before we start. So, Kristin Ruse, using what I often call retro software, with Kristin Ruse, and probably many others call vintage software, which sounds a little more scholarly and academic and perhaps the right term. A couple of things on this I was thinking over the weekend. First was the insight that I had over the weekend, again, one of these incredibly obvious things that I'm not sure I've ever thought of before.
00:02:19.324 - 00:02:44.182, Speaker A: And that was this idea, of course, Kristen Roose uses vintage software. So what does that mean? This one here on a software I'd actually never even heard before. Let me see if I can bring it up here. It's a huge file, which we'll get into in a second. Dazzle draw 1984 on an Apple Iie. Shout out to mom. We had my first computer, the Apple Iie.
00:02:44.182 - 00:03:00.264, Speaker A: Ours was not in color. Ours was green and black. But maybe that gave it more charm. And so when I see Apple Iie, I kind of. It kind of. You're already starting to land on a soft spot in my heart. Let's put it this way.
00:03:00.264 - 00:03:26.322, Speaker A: But back to the insight. The very ridiculously simple insight was thinking about music tech software. I was watching a video on Instagram and it was someone. Who was it? It was someone actually famous using a 303 and showing how they. It was future. P h u t u r e a famous. I think they made the first acid track.
00:03:26.322 - 00:03:45.418, Speaker A: And it was the guy. I can't remember who it is. One of the guys from future was showing was basically saying, you know, I bought this tv 303. And when you bought it, the ads were like, you know, accompaniment for a jazz pianist. Like they had a. I can't remember who it was. Some famous.
00:03:45.418 - 00:04:07.294, Speaker A: It wasn't Thelonious monk who was later, but some famous jazz chet. Someone. Not Chet Baker, but something like this. Right. And it was meant not even to be used for recording the Roland TB 303, which maybe I should show very, very quickly. I think most of you know what this is, but there's going to be some of you who don't. And I want to bring you along for the ride here.
00:04:07.294 - 00:04:24.884, Speaker A: So this is the Roland TB 303. Maybe we can even find the early ad, which is a. As you see here, computer controlled. Came out, I think, in 82, 83. It is a baseline machine. Okay, early ad. And then maybe we'll put jazz.
00:04:24.884 - 00:04:47.186, Speaker A: Maybe I can bring up the ad. Wouldn't that be great? This is it now, I wish I knew who this is. Let's just look very quickly. But this was the original kind of early ad. And the idea was that, you know, it's not even meant for recording. Okay, Neil. Oscar Peterson.
00:04:47.186 - 00:05:09.478, Speaker A: It's Oscar Peterson with the TB 303. This is why you watch this show, my friends. So you can see Oscar Peterson working with the TB 303. And I mean, this almost looks like an extended version. Like, I guess he has two of them. But they look kind of different, don't they? Makes you wonder. Maybe one's a MC 202 or something.
00:05:09.478 - 00:05:36.314, Speaker A: Who knows? 1982. A 1982 Roland brochure. And so, of course, as one of the guys from future was saying in this Instagram video, this reel, we started using it the way you're supposed to. And it was kind of bland. You weren't even supposed to record with it. It was supposed to be for practicing beside. Alongside as Oscar Peterson is doing here.
00:05:36.314 - 00:06:10.228, Speaker A: And what the guy from future was saying was. And then I started to turn some of the knobs to get things more interesting. And then my friend had the TR 707. Who was it? The names are escaping me. And my friend had the TR 707, very famous, you know, the guys who I think started acid techno or acid house and started adding hi hats and the bass drum and everything and all to say. And then he said, we just recorded the jam. Like, that's the first record as far as I understood the story.
00:06:10.228 - 00:07:03.100, Speaker A: We just recorded the jam. And it was while I was watching this, I was thinking to myself, you know, we still. Or, you know, people who make techno, and I don't really make techno anymore, but those that do, they still go to these instruments. And in the nineties and the two thousands and even the late eighties, as it happened with future, they were using these instruments almost as we do vintage software. And it's almost like as we look at deluxe paint. And here in the case of this massive file here, which will take a second to load, Broderbond. And I remember Broderboond, a big software maker, made a lot of awesome games, including loadrunner for the Apple Iie, maybe these, like, deluxe paint, which was on the Amiga.
00:07:03.100 - 00:07:40.644, Speaker A: When we go back to these softwares, this is the equivalent of us going back to the SH 101. This is the equivalent of us going back to the 808, to the 909, to these machines, for these retro machines, and kind of using them in ways that really weren't really imagined back then. And perhaps. I mean, perhaps. I mean, some of the ads. And Francois, gamma, just to finish the point here, Francois Gammer has been posting these ads and I should show some of them at some point here on, like, these early, like, fantavision ads. And they are quite artistic.
00:07:40.644 - 00:08:18.752, Speaker A: You almost say, oh, that's a nice work. Is that Bifrost was gamma, you'd almost think. And then you go, oh, that's actually an ad, a sample ad from the late eighties. So all to say, there is an interesting parallel, which, weirdly, I think exists coexisted. And I would have said, sure, but I hadn't really formed a. The neurons hadn't quite connected on this whole idea in a kind of profound, in a real clear way that, again, when we use these vintage softwares, this is the equivalent of using vintage synths. And maybe this is obvious to everybody else, but I'm kind of back to this idea.
00:08:18.752 - 00:08:45.092, Speaker A: Sometimes the most obvious things are not that obvious at all. And so that is the realization I came to this weekend. And so I was thrilled to start with this. And then Kristin ruse actually just put out a tweet. Someone was saying they were on this, that Kristen was on this show. Like, I think it was 250 or 220, something like this. And actually, Kristin Roose has been on this show almost since the beginning, but I started the show with that one.
00:08:45.092 - 00:09:07.534, Speaker A: So someone was highlighting it for Kristen for some reason. And it was great to hear from Kristen. And I would have started with this anyway. Kind of reminds me of the Ilay episode. I would have started with this anyway, but all to say, was great to hear from them. Now, let's look at this work, which I actually picked up, ten tezos edition of ten. And this is what's super interesting.
00:09:07.534 - 00:09:59.364, Speaker A: Does it look a little different to you? Right? Does it look like, does this look like a clean export of a jPEg, or does this look like a photograph? If I had to guess, and I am guessing, does this look more like a photograph of the screen? And let me, as you see here, and this glitch, I would actually argue, adds to the work. It gives you this texture. And again, you get that alchemy, that transmutation of traveling through the mediums. Again here we're going from digital to photography. And then actually, and then we are saving it as a JPEG. Technically, I assume this is a JPEG. Is this a JPEG? Yes, it is.
00:09:59.364 - 00:11:08.754, Speaker A: Image Jpeg. So there is that, interestingly, leaving in the user interface here, and let me just give you the final kind of, and that almost looks like the cursor. So again, and you wouldn't have gotten this on a clean export, right? And probably, this is probably what it tells me is maybe this is a real appletui and not a, and not a simulator, which kind of adds another level. Does that add to the work, one wonders. Again, I think of lb, you know, taking, you know, taking the super Mario paint exports and then putting them through the analog glitch, I think a curo, you know, making these kind of analog paintings, analog video paintings, you know, again, you get the sense there's a composition, maybe working with Rannixteer work, let's say, when they collaborated and then putting on the glitch layer. And we have a similar thing going on here. And again, I love the meta, the, this kind of, you know, this layer here showing, in a sense, the artist's hand, so to speak.
00:11:08.754 - 00:11:50.946, Speaker A: So again and again, and just the final thing here, and it's kind of, again, the glory and the joy of working across mediums here is, you see this line here, like, to me, this is the giveaway. Because it looks like a curved screen, doesn't it? Which I think is how they used to be, if memory serves. And it sure looks like it, doesn't it? This looks like a photo of a screen. Which I would argue, adds to the work. And so, isn't that interesting? You can see it's not even quite centered here in the middle of the composition. There's a little bit more margin on the left than the right. So I've never heard of dazzle draw.
00:11:50.946 - 00:12:14.178, Speaker A: But again, this is the equivalent of finding a vintage synth. A mini moog, you know, or a different kind of moog. And getting sounds out of it. Isn't it the same? So, I mean, it's barely an analogy. It is almost the same in terms of the technique. It's a parallel technique. And again, the reason why.
00:12:14.178 - 00:12:37.332, Speaker A: Again, I'm kind of emphasizing this. Is because in the techno scene. Anybody that's ever tried to make techno or house or anything like this. This is really a foundational paradigm, you might say, of making, you know, electronic music is going to these analog synths. It's part of the larger paradigm. You don't need to. But even the samples that you get.
00:12:37.332 - 00:13:08.274, Speaker A: If you've never even touched one of these synths. They're going to be based on a lot of, like, the 909 and the 808 and the Jupiter eight and everything, Juno 106. So, all to say, very beautiful and just interesting and a fabulous way to begin. Hopefully, out of necessity, our shortened episode just also here. This is also in this series here. So there's only two in the series. This is sold out at ten tezos only 6 hours ago.
00:13:08.274 - 00:13:28.152, Speaker A: Interestingly. When did this come out? March 8. Interesting, but just sold out recently. So another work from the paint series. This one is what we might call a clean export. And using a different software, a different vintage synth. Denuba ultra paint for Macintosh.
00:13:28.152 - 00:13:52.654, Speaker A: So it'll be very fun to see where this goes. And just final thing on this, what you'll notice is Kristin ruse is using. Is using, if this loads up, kind of their traditional. What's interesting, their traditional palette, you might say, or iconic palette. Or image making. Okay, buildings. We'll do some buildings here.
00:13:52.654 - 00:14:20.360, Speaker A: Or shapes. Because if we go through, you'll notice, hey, that kind of looks familiar, doesn't it? So it's taking these ideas and then transmuting them alchemically. Through these vintage instruments, so to speak. So here we are. So, as you see, again, these kind of simple squares or rectangles. And everything. So just some awesome work here.
00:14:20.360 - 00:15:04.508, Speaker A: These were great too. Just an awesome artist here. And so yeah, and someone who early you'll discover on object here, some of these works were some of the early discoveries for me of just this kind of style on object a couple of years ago. So I'll just say, cool way to begin our show. So let's get going here if we can, if we can. So on comments from last show here. Terry visual so of course, we started with the Kurt Hussle collective here, JNK and Terry Visual Pokebelly, thank you so much for the big feature and taking the time to show some of our previous works.
00:15:04.508 - 00:15:30.288, Speaker A: It's a true honor and as I said, I believe the honor is mine. Terry Visual it's awesome to have you guys comment on the program and just, you know, be happy to see you there. So again, long overdue to put you on. Sarah Kretschmer, another fantastic show. Thanks for the shout out. And we have a couple of works actually by Sarah in this show close to the AI section. So thank you, Sarah.
00:15:30.288 - 00:15:43.468, Speaker A: Awesome to see you watching. Louise. Gamma, it's awesome to work while listening to you. I don't mind you talking at all. Thanks for your work. Well, I'm glad to hear that. So again, it's just gonna be one big improvisation here.
00:15:43.468 - 00:16:08.612, Speaker A: But again, so the solution back to this idea. Sometimes the most obvious things are the hardest to figure out. I've been trying to shorten this show, so what I've done is I've made a time deadline, so I basically have another 30, 40 minutes and that's it. So problem solved. But it took me about six months to figure out how to do that. Let's see how it goes. So anyways, I appreciate the comment.
00:16:08.612 - 00:16:19.984, Speaker A: Glad you're enjoying it. Right click dead. I already watched it on X. I discovered two great new artists thanks to you. Great episode, Adrian. Thank you. So that is braindead, I believe, on object.
00:16:19.984 - 00:16:38.034, Speaker A: Also comments here and let's make this a little bigger and hit pause. So hilarious comment from walk here. Denise, thanks a lot for sharing my artwork in this awesome episode. You're welcome. Yeah, those blue and white works were very cool. Walk. I wasn't trolling.
00:16:38.034 - 00:17:09.944, Speaker A: So this is for real, the perotin store, of course. Perotin is a famous art gallery, I believe out of Paris. Yes, Perotin's store et Lance was launched in Paris in 2011 and has several selling points around the world. So all for real. So walk wasn't joking and here it is to accept a we'll accept all our cookies here. So interesting. So you can shop Peroutin online on eBay.
00:17:09.944 - 00:17:24.548, Speaker A: Very interesting. Jnk, thanks for the love and support. Pokebilly. This is highly appreciated on our side of the cyberspace. Awesome. Thank you J and K, awesome to hear from you and Terry. Digi immediately recognized Kurt Hussle collective, honored to be mentioned in the vid.
00:17:24.548 - 00:17:45.342, Speaker A: Thank you. You are welcome, Digi, awesome to have you in the vid iteration. I love Kurt, also collective, they're underrated as heck. Great feature. It's kind of funny. Like I just assume everybody knows who they are because they're such a prominent part of my kind of NFT experience, so to speak. So all to say excited.
00:17:45.342 - 00:18:04.974, Speaker A: So as you see, Kurt, there's cedar plank, hysteruble waffle, Kurt hussle collective. So more excitement there. And bombadil, great to hear from you, Renato. Thanks, Mister Pokebelli. My pleasure. And I don't think there's a Renato I was looking at. I couldn't tell if it was new or not.
00:18:04.974 - 00:18:36.860, Speaker A: All to say great work from Renato recently. Kurt Hussle collective, awesome to hear from you and cedar Plank. Sam Doyle was Psam Doyle was one of Basquiat's favorite artists. And actually I looked up, did that come in here? And maybe this was in reference to a work. He's wonderful, I think through a manager in your walt. Thank you, cedar plank. So Sam Doyle, let's look at Sam Doyle really quickly here.
00:18:36.860 - 00:18:57.486, Speaker A: Kurt Hustle collective feature. Finally. Oh my God. Poker. So as you see, it's almost all about Kurt Hussle collective. So a loyal following. I want to show you Sam Doyle, which is an artist that has dribble waffle or cedar plank pointed out who was a big influence on Basquiat.
00:18:57.486 - 00:19:36.980, Speaker A: And you're gonna. If I'd never seen Sam Doyle, I think actually waffles had mentioned Sam Doyle before because actually this does look familiar from a show from maybe 100 episodes ago about you do see the Basquiat influence and you actually see the influence on waffles. So very, very interesting. Even the text on the work here, you see the texture. This is like some found, you know, speaking of cedar planks here, you know, some found piece of wood. So very interesting artist here. So kind of look at how beautiful this is.
00:19:36.980 - 00:20:14.408, Speaker A: So you see a real connection here between these artists because clearly waffles, I would say, is influenced here, even just in the subject matter and all of this stuff, you can see it, this influence, and you can see it on Basquiat as well. So we're making the connections here. So thank you for the link there. Also, thank you, everybody who posted in the artist journal community. Just go to my page and you will find it right near the bio there on Twitter, on x. So thank you. Alex Dronove 3D artwork created using cinema four D.
00:20:14.408 - 00:20:50.174, Speaker A: And just a quick note to everybody who sends me links in the messages. In a sense, I get too many. So the way, if you want to kind of get the workout on the show, and I also like the transparency of it because sometimes if I get a message for that, there's a work that's being released and then I put it out, maybe I'm going, hey, cool, someone from the community put it out, put it on the show. But it might get interpreted as, hey, Pokebelly just discovered this new artist and can't wait to show it to us. So I just like. And, and maybe that's the case. But all to say, I just like the transparency and.
00:20:50.174 - 00:21:22.594, Speaker A: And the actually the streamlinedness where. Cause I can't go through, you know, all ten messages before each show because then I'm just spending my entire day and searching, really, for the links that might have been sent. So all to say, if you have a work and this cool 3d artwork here, feel free to post in the community. And I will often just scroll through here. Here's a cool one by human boy. And once in a while I'll think, now, did I take this one out? I meant to take this one out here by psycho futurist. This very cool work here.
00:21:22.594 - 00:21:37.542, Speaker A: This is on Tazos. So I'm working pretty fast here today. But this is the beauty of being in the community here. We can just sort of scroll through it. 369. Cool, animated, abstract and a gorgeous. I may have brought these up in the tabs following here.
00:21:37.542 - 00:21:55.878, Speaker A: Look at this. So cool. AI artwork. Kind of reminds you of, actually the situation there in this piazza here. I don't know if you'd call that a piazza, but in this whole kind of, like, this is basically tourist season in Italy. This is almost what it's like out there. And I'm not even joking, other than the people hanging off the leaning tower.
00:21:55.878 - 00:22:12.176, Speaker A: Pisa. Pisa's not my favorite visit, let me tell you. There's just too many tourists, and it's a total tourist trap and a bit of a boring. Well, anyway, nothing against Pisa. It's in Tuscany. It's a beautiful part of the world, so you can take the train all around there. Anyways, there's tons to see.
00:22:12.176 - 00:22:25.534, Speaker A: Leo Montana. Thank you. So look at this. Lucky Luke. More to our french theme. There's me actually in the cafe working on my Dante pixel artwork. So that is getting really close to being done.
00:22:25.534 - 00:23:19.768, Speaker A: I'm not worrying too much again. I'm just putting a time deadline. The importance of the time deadline is I feel like what I'm relearning here again, it brings me back to the roots of this show, which is not really having too much time to, you know, when, when nobody or when ten people were watching at the start, I wasn't worrying about, you know, making super amounts of time during the day to, you know, so all to say, going back to the roots here, rural idol, four year hideyversary hidey thing. So all to say, all sorts of cool drawings here, a cool GiF drawing, which is almost a genre unto itself in simulacro with more of these kind of recognition camera recognition works here. So all to say, a ton posted here in the community. This is on Zora by Hermanos Cutter and another one by human boy here. Fall into place.
00:23:19.768 - 00:23:37.048, Speaker A: And Sarah Kretschmer. And actually, we'll look at this in the AI section with painting. And also this one here, 2002. So all sorts of cool works here. Peter the Roman, a Zora zorb and more. Didn't see this one. Zu Zilang and Ak Dell.
00:23:37.048 - 00:23:57.036, Speaker A: So just a ton of work here. Filippo Francocci more. And I think we saw this last time. So thanks, everybody for posting. And yes, I did open these and I was going to put them into a later part of the show, but we'll just look right now. So just cool work here by psycho futurist, as you see here. And here was the other one.
00:23:57.036 - 00:24:21.618, Speaker A: Exactly. Human tapestry. So this is by HJ Nft NYC. So I thought pretty standout works there. Beautiful works all round. And again, thank you, everybody, for posting and sharing. And sometimes it's just the format of the show is how I go with just figuring out what's in and going with the kind of music, the DJ set of the show, Artie Hands.
00:24:21.618 - 00:24:43.344, Speaker A: So people, maybe I'll put this one first. Actually, skull takes people. Got a huge airdrop. I only got $100, but I was happy with that. There was a tiny voice in the back of my head saying this whole time saying, this is probably too good to be true. Skull takes. So a lot of people got like one thousand, five hundred dollars to two thousand dollars airdrop on the on using Farcaster.
00:24:43.344 - 00:25:13.530, Speaker A: So very interesting. They got this DJN token here. And so it's a second airdrop. And as Artie hands. So first of all, I'm thrilled for everyone and everything. I thought Artie hands had an interesting post, so I'm much less inclined to use Warpcast now that everyone is going there to make money. And it's just an interesting I thought, put it this way, I kind of related a little bit to this post, which was kind of interesting and I'm not.
00:25:13.530 - 00:25:45.564, Speaker A: I'm kind of all for people making money and everything and I'm really happy for everybody that got the airdrop. I was happy to get my hundred $150 there, so I was very happy with that. But I kind of relate to this post and it is going to be interesting. People love the experience there, but I do. I think it was retro Manny who was posting, still trying to figure out the ux. I don't know how the frames work. There is still a bit of a hurdle there in terms of how it works.
00:25:45.564 - 00:26:25.766, Speaker A: But then I heard these are basically tweets that didn't make it in here today, just for time. Then it sounds like you're going to be able to mint though on Warpcast. So again, it's probably a place you want to be, right? So it's just one of those things and people are pretty enthusiastic about it. Jani Sortas give it a try without Degen and tipping in mind. It's truly a great place for art. So all very interesting and I should continue, I keep saying to myself, to post this show maybe with more time, as I will have now, hopefully I will do that. So as you can see here, foundation genesis.
00:26:25.766 - 00:26:56.470, Speaker A: This is the start of something new. I believe this is their base, their launch on base, as far as I understand. So this starts in a day. So pretty cool. And here spoogles April 2 spoogle two genesis with foundation on base. So I think that's what's going on here. So again, and speaking of money, base is probably another place you want to be doing this sort of thing.
00:26:56.470 - 00:27:36.718, Speaker A: So you do get the sense there could be an airdrop at some point. So who knows? So base of course is the ETH, the Ethereum, L2 put out by Coinbase. And so it's pretty easy to get set up there if you have metamask and everything. So here it is. Rob foundation beginning April 2. So this is the one of the founders there, partnerships manager, I should say. Robert foundation beginning April 2, foundation will provide support for base, including a faster auction experience for collectors, upload file size increase for creators, zero fees on drops and editions for artists.
00:27:36.718 - 00:28:08.114, Speaker A: So almost a bit of a zora kind of thing going on here with file size and dropping fees and everything. So cool. So the competitions continue also rob foundation. Starting Monday, foundation will not take any fees for additions and drops. Collectors will be charged only 0.008 ETH to mint. So it almost sounds like you can start doing the free mint on foundation is kind of what it sounds like.
00:28:08.114 - 00:28:27.648, Speaker A: Correct me if I'm wrong. If anybody knows that is watching Kiro last foundation glitch left. So doing a little homage really to foundation here. The foundation logo, as you see here, right in the top left corner there. So all sorts of interesting stuff going on here. Renato. That's what I was thinking.
00:28:27.648 - 00:28:58.066, Speaker A: Renato Times Renato Marini. Where do you go to collect on base? It's an interesting question. Was it mint fun? And what were the others? I guess you can go to foundation starting tomorrow. I guess you can do opensea. I mean, where is everybody collecting on, on base? I feel like there is a. I guess there's manifold, you know, axing and x copy or using manifold as well as I think Ner. What was neurocolor using? Some people are using Zora.
00:28:58.066 - 00:29:16.986, Speaker A: It's an interesting question here. Highlight XYZ. So far in highlight XYZ. So there is one Zora rarible. And I've seen someone manifold sound XYZ too, which I believe is music NFTs. So all very interesting for the hasdrubal waffle fans. We got our Cedar plank news here.
00:29:16.986 - 00:29:44.380, Speaker A: It would behoove you to bookmark this page within 24 hours because it will be facelifted with links to future bass drops. So fool's day is also a day for clown liberation. In other words, poof. So I'll just say a little bit of alpha for the collectors out there on this program, RC XYZ. So right click. So again, I just kind of got on this thing, and we were talking about it as a kind of artist registry. I got this link.
00:29:44.380 - 00:30:24.448, Speaker A: We're transforming RC XYz into something new. This is from March 21. It's a group project with curators, collectors, and artists to map out a verified directory of artists and their work, all for public use. And so as you saw, I think it was last episode, I was showing the profile that they set up, and they have all your sales and everything. And it really does feel like this is the sort of thing that professional contemporary art galleries will have. Maybe from artsy, if I'm not mistaken. You know, they'll get these databases of these artists so that if you're a collector or you're a gallerist or you're working, you can kind of look at the market, you can see what people have sold for in this sort of thing.
00:30:24.448 - 00:30:50.778, Speaker A: And it's kind of like, it seems like right click is trying to do the same thing, which is pretty smart, actually. Continuing on, Jacob from Azora new feature send. You can now easily send an edition you own directly from the Mint page. So it is easy, even with the ens address or email, to send someone a mint. So that is pretty cool too. Ed Marolla. Three years ago, I minted my first artwork on hand.
00:30:50.778 - 00:31:22.670, Speaker A: What a journey. This has changed my life for the best. Web three made me believe I could live from my crazy art, even though I have no idea what I'm doing most of the time. It is pretty amazing. And actually we have some works, actually, let's show those works by Ed first, then we'll go, we have some works by Ed, some beautiful physical drawings here. And we're kind of back to the synthesizers theme, aren't we? And there's a turntable, of course. Ed, I think, used to do audio, if I'm not mistaken, for commercials, if I'm not mistaken.
00:31:22.670 - 00:31:38.494, Speaker A: And here it looks like a theremin or something. Not exactly sure, but all sorts of different music instruments with Ed's classic colors. But this time physical. Very cool. Living the dream. And of course, I follow Ed Marolla. That is a Twitter glitch.
00:31:38.494 - 00:31:59.114, Speaker A: Rata flip some coins and ordered cool drawing tools. Living the dream. So making some money here in crypto. And as we see here, look at these beautiful drawings of rats. Larata the rat. These are beautiful. So it looks like Rada got some beautiful pens and just beautiful work.
00:31:59.114 - 00:32:28.084, Speaker A: Interesting work. And kind of showing the work in progress from Jan Lucas Magone sketch versus original. So this is just a window into this gorgeous work we saw last show. You might remember it with the VR, with the Apple vision Pro, I think. And then kind of this eros and Thanatos theme. Well, here's kind of an early version. Kind of looks like iPad, doesn't it? Interesting background, I might add, this underpainting where you see just a little bit of texture.
00:32:28.084 - 00:32:46.722, Speaker A: It's not completely filled out. You can tell it's been kind of drawn in. Nice touch, actually. Very nice touch to give it that organic feeling. So all to say, just really cool sketch. And is the sketch available? No. So interesting marketing, actually.
00:32:46.722 - 00:33:17.022, Speaker A: So the piece is still available, but then a day later, let's say you put the post out or two days later, then you show the work in progress or how it was made to kind of remind people, and maybe you make a few more sales that way. Pretty smart, actually. So all sorts of brilliance going on here. Here's psycho artist in VJ, also known as score. Thank you so much, Artpoint XYZ, for exhibiting my works at Workspace Expo. I'm so happy that my works are shown on this very special screen. I'm seeing more of these.
00:33:17.022 - 00:33:53.452, Speaker A: There's a mall here in Berlin, east side mall that I find myself buying groceries in, and they have these kind of these screens that also hug the columns like this. So kind of a newer thing that a lot of us are starting to see here. So interesting to see the work displayed like that. So congrats to psycho artpoint XYZ digital art and nfts and public spaces since 2019. Kind of looks like a trade show, doesn't it? Interestingly. And here's Zach panoramic install shots from Orb exhibition in Sao Paulo. So still in South America.
00:33:53.452 - 00:34:11.938, Speaker A: And here, pretty nice gallery space, I might add. And the works are looking pretty good on the tvs here. So there is the orb drop. And I believe this is on Zora, if I'm not mistaken. So all very cool. And yeah, you can mint them. Here you go on Zora.
00:34:11.938 - 00:34:31.622, Speaker A: So cool work there. And here's Martin Bruce in the gallery GM. It's available. And there is the painting. I had to look twice because again, you see this railing here, but this is painted on the wall. So I assume it's just for this painting here, but a very cool show. And then look at the real one.
00:34:31.622 - 00:34:54.846, Speaker A: Martin Bruce is going to say like, imma interesting, always interesting. Always interesting. Like with this, like just very interesting with this real world kind of piece of balcony or whatever that is. Balcony railing. Super interesting walk are we doing here? We're doing fabulous for time. Incredibly excited. Current bid, $99.
00:34:54.846 - 00:35:15.124, Speaker A: So it continues for look at this beautiful work of art on eBay from Wok. So that continues 99. I think that was euros, which is pretty good. $99 a euros. Nice on eBay. So continues to break new ground there. Ever dream this t shirt? So this is of course the famous guy.
00:35:15.124 - 00:35:49.498, Speaker A: We saw cider actually do this work too. The famous guy who is dreamt and then walk with a virtuoso version of this. Again, looks like directly on t shirt. But as you see here, all of the delight of a fantastic abstract, you know, artists here, or like all the painterliness, but not with brushes. This is with spray paint, one would think, just again, make. It's incredible how perfect this all looks. So now on a t shirt.
00:35:49.498 - 00:36:33.842, Speaker A: We've seen other works by walk on t shirts. Let's jump into the artworks here. Nub, 1914, with a very experimental work, I think what really captured me in this one, of all things, and it's always these kind of superficial things, the pink, this pink bar creates just this energy and excitement for this work, for me. And interesting lines here, too, on the left, these two irrational parallel lines. And almost like the transformation, a reference to the transform tool that was being used before, but this time it's drawn out manually. Again, always interesting here. And there's kind of like one of these teddy bear figures done in a different way.
00:36:33.842 - 00:36:59.028, Speaker A: And you almost see the selection there and everything. So just another beautiful work. LinneLl one that's a one of one for ten tezos from NUV, 1914. The failed artist 79 self portrait. Bam O'shanter. So kind of a funny one here as the failed artist jumps into danger. What looks like a bull is on the other side of this gate.
00:36:59.028 - 00:37:18.048, Speaker A: Keep out. Failed artist fries on the head cast and flipping the bird here to the world. And of course, the hot dog and the wine. Where's the cigarette? There it is. And as you see here, this masterfully painted work. I mean, it's gorgeously painted. Look at the stars, even.
00:37:18.048 - 00:37:46.124, Speaker A: And this purple sky. And again, we have this wonderful contrast between the textured areas and then the flat areas of the work. Of course, this has kind of, you know, a digital brush work here. And then in the purple, you see just more of a flat brush. So two kinds of different digital brushes being used here. But you see all the care, even the shadows of the fries on the head of the failed artist. And the cigarette here, the McDonald's cigarette.
00:37:46.124 - 00:38:08.388, Speaker A: Just a beautiful work. This is a one of one Bam O'Shanter for 79 tazos listed 16 hours ago. Beautiful work here by Wok, my painting of Chef Tony. And I'm not sure if this is new or old. It was just posted on x. Interesting outlines here, which you often see. Let me see if I can make this bigger.
00:38:08.388 - 00:38:38.264, Speaker A: Which you often see with the airbrush artists. These kind of hard contrasts that you'll get of these outlines. See that with machine and a lot of the other airbrush artists. So, of course, this is spray paint. And it makes a nice contrast, doesn't it, of these, kind of the randomness of these brushwork. Almost like it looks like Doctor Benway here, or a chef, but with suggestive blood here. So I'm not exactly sure who chef Tony is.
00:38:38.264 - 00:38:53.204, Speaker A: Probably a reference I should know. Maybe I do know it. Pp universal, this sold edition of one. And this sold at auction for 13 tezos. Now going for 400 on secondary. A pretty fun work. I feel like this is like a meme here, too, but I'm not sure.
00:38:53.204 - 00:39:14.566, Speaker A: And here, as you see, kind of painted with a couple of different brushes here, too, interestingly. And we see the car painted one way and everything else with a bit of texture in it. Nice work. And a mercedes trying to go through a little portal here in an underground parking lot. You can't park there, mate. Edition of one. Again selling for 13 at auction.
00:39:14.566 - 00:39:41.564, Speaker A: And a new work here. I believe it's the last, the final work here for now, at least, on Zora. Cedar Planck was saying how now there's going to be. It's going to be on base is where the next series is going to be. So wrapping up the Zora series with some interesting. I never saw all this, all this dithering here. You've seen another similar sort of situation.
00:39:41.564 - 00:40:01.754, Speaker A: The dithering here is kind of like one way of working. And then here we have like a different brush. It's like two different brushes we've seen in a few of these works. Makes an interesting contrast. And then we have all this other stuff here. Let's see if we can move over here. And again, this looks like that kind of more textured paint.
00:40:01.754 - 00:40:21.372, Speaker A: So a few different works. It almost looks like a cut and paste, actually, of a few different works. And you just see how easy waffles makes. This look here is Bzzaya. This is on base. I believe it is burning on base. And you might remember this work here with the zebra and the leopard.
00:40:21.372 - 00:40:33.024, Speaker A: You can. If. If you. I think if you burn five, maybe, or you burn, you'll need to burn certain tokens. Click here to see. So price free, total redeem five. Okay, maybe you only need to burn one.
00:40:33.024 - 00:40:54.698, Speaker A: And so here's the work. They could use a maximize here. Let me just do this. And so interesting piece here. What is the title tomorrow? So maybe a famous pop culture reference again, that I don't know, but maybe not. Looks like japanese, uh, soccer jersey. And interesting person here.
00:40:54.698 - 00:41:16.878, Speaker A: And maybe in jail with the counting the days here, but not sure. So just a cool, uh, piece there. Here's another one on base. Here's axine. And this is called pre sale, which a lot of us in the crypto scene will relate to. Here's presale. Airdrop and launch as the skeleton gets launched down into the fire here.
00:41:16.878 - 00:41:42.010, Speaker A: So kind of a commentary, isn't it? Give your money to the computer, put on your mask and then go into the fire. And then here is, you know, your financial chart here going down. Hilarious. Put on your seatbelt. Smoking aloud. It's pretty brilliant, isn't it? 111 minted at zero points. 0069.
00:41:42.010 - 00:42:25.374, Speaker A: Nice work, because that leads into. Is that 0.7 ETH? I mean, that's a pretty nice payday these days. That's a couple thousand dollars using base and 111 again, we're back to this idea, this digital art dream that, what if you have a million followers and then you can sell them a work at, you know, a dollar each and 100,000 buy it, or even 10,000 buy it at a dollar. That's almost what we're starting to see here, which is a pretty different kind of model when you think of what we're seeing in contemporary art and your little artsy database and secondary and all this. Or, you know, your art consultants. No, I just put it on Twitter and a whole bunch of people bought it for a dollar.
00:42:25.374 - 00:42:46.846, Speaker A: Here is Daniel W. Continuing the corporate bestiary series. Here's the CEO. Almost has a bit of a Francis Bacon screaming pope kind of vibe to it, doesn't it? Again, we always see this interesting kind of print texture here. Nice minimal color. This is all digital, by the way. And there's Dan W's little logo there.
00:42:46.846 - 00:43:08.104, Speaker A: And again, working with textured digital paper, if I'm not mistaken. And there's the title underneath. Nice kind of margin here. Nice work. Fortezos edition of 18 and three left, so get it while you can. This is number six in the series. Here's Morlakos, the infiltration.
00:43:08.104 - 00:43:46.570, Speaker A: So I'm not sure where Mollacos is going with this series, but I find it really interesting, let's put it this way. So kind of a Sci-Fi you know, western sort of thing, but kind of has a south american vibe, too. So all very interesting. And you see a palette that is being used here as well as a style with the clouds that is consistent across these kind of semi transparent clouds here. And just interesting, this robot here, beautifully drawn, I might add, and toxic waste. And almost like, again, a Sci-Fi movie here, the infiltration edition of ten. Three tezos.
00:43:46.570 - 00:44:08.644, Speaker A: And this is on object. And how many are left here? There are eight left. Continuing on, Santiago Pepe are different directions for the destiny of a melted glove. So apparently these aren't AI. It's not AI, apparently. This is these titles and this beautiful. Love this mark here.
00:44:08.644 - 00:44:48.100, Speaker A: This was really what jumped out at me was this thing here and then juxtaposed with this area here. But again, the titles, I believe it was hearing, I think because I was mentioned in an episode, Santiago actually comes up with those titles on his own, not with AI, apparently. I find that amazing because those titles are pretty interesting. Look at this stretch here. So all to say, just really interesting composition, when you zoom out here too, again, this negative space I find weirdly powerful, the negative space surrounding this abstract. And I love the kind of different kind of composition here. Edition of 15 for 356 are gone so far.
00:44:48.100 - 00:45:32.856, Speaker A: Here's mumble boy with an addition of one Jim G bangers. And I got these two characters from something I minted on Zora. So here, this is for twelve tezos. And again, we're playing with digital and physical and out of focus ness and making out of focusedness work, interestingly, and kind of nice airbrush digital marks, again, contrasting with these hard edges, which we saw in earlier works today. This kind of contrast of the airbrush and the hard edge, you almost see a similar thing going on here as we continue on. This is an interesting piece I saw on X. Collected on secondary rhythm is compensation from Kapow.
00:45:32.856 - 00:45:58.932, Speaker A: So maybe this isn't from the last 24 hours here. I just thought it was an interesting piece, just kind of a different kind of abstract. And here's one by, I believe, 2002 or 20,002, never ending cycle. This is using kidpix, interestingly. Let's see if we can get it bigger. Cycle three and 14 minted so far, I think minted a couple of days ago. Smaller work, interestingly.
00:45:58.932 - 00:46:28.668, Speaker A: So just kind of a different kind of work here. And so again, 2002, if I'm not mistaken, power cush this by walk. So another additional to this cannabis series. And again, using wok's kind of trademark noise style. And at auction, sells everything as far as I can see. You know, get another wok for three tezos. One day we'll look back and think, I could have bought all those woks, those walk one of ones for only a few bucks.
00:46:28.668 - 00:46:55.800, Speaker A: Continuing on, demon ego, the accidental transformation of scribbled words into portraits. This March 30 edition of ten for ten tezos. One gone so far. Let's see what's going on here. So again, playing with physical and digital, right? And we have a Gif with, again, drawing here. Pen and ink, maybe marker. And again, some found images from the Internet, maybe, maybe some camera work.
00:46:55.800 - 00:47:17.344, Speaker A: This digital gif kind of animation on top, combining really mixing mediums here. Look at this. Great work on the side. This almost looks. This pixelation almost looks physical. Right? So just all very, very interesting, as usual from demon ego. And here's barberin card number two.
00:47:17.344 - 00:47:36.044, Speaker A: These are made with object 98, which is the Microsoft paint that you can use on object. The Tezos website there. Tezos art website. A pretty nice piece. I think I saw an earlier version of this without the car inside. Right. So quite beautifully painted, if you ask me.
00:47:36.044 - 00:48:11.684, Speaker A: And, you know, again, I love the subject matter of taking this car in a package and packaging I find super interesting, especially with toys. Again, we see it sometimes, and I've done it myself with trading cards or comics. Have to speed up the show. There's no choice. Trading cards or comics when they're in the packaging, in the Mylar, you know, protective case, kind of a similar thing going on here. Car number two. And here's car number one again, minted on object 98 using the kind of retro, more retro software.
00:48:11.684 - 00:48:46.486, Speaker A: Interestingly, car number one, three, tezos two sold already. And here's Ripcash again. We're kind of back in the toy section here of the store. And here, kind of a dithered version of what looks like a drone, but replacing, you know, your classic, maybe fighter jet model. So a lot of people will recognize this model citizen. Some assembly required, because, of course, this is a structure where a lot of those revel models that we used to make when we were kids, some of us. So we'll be familiar with that structure.
00:48:46.486 - 00:49:01.624, Speaker A: Ok, DX, Sunday sunset. Nice pixel artwork. I think this is OKDX, if I'm not mistaken, posting the work there. And here's Anis Abdin. See if we can make this bigger with a couple of pixel artworks here. We do have to speed up. We.
00:49:01.624 - 00:49:18.472, Speaker A: But not too much or we're good, because this is the show. I think this is the end of the. Like, if we look there, that is the end of the show. It doesn't go on for a hundred more tabs, happily. And it's still gonna be an hour show. Interesting. So here's Anis Abdin in the Arctic here.
00:49:18.472 - 00:49:38.010, Speaker A: Interesting color choices, aren't they? Very interesting color choices. And this is the animated version. Interesting to see the static version, too. It is a different work, isn't it? So quite interesting to see the difference. Here's another one. Beautiful. This kind of looks like a spring.
00:49:38.010 - 00:50:00.344, Speaker A: What do they call those flowers? There is. There is a name for these trees. We have them here in Berlin, as well as many of you do. So beautiful cat. In the midst of all of these flower petals coming from the trees, anis Abdin and tenegard. So here's another one. So a few coming out, of course.
00:50:00.344 - 00:50:32.984, Speaker A: Anis Abdin putting out a workaday so far this year, incredibly. And here is another one, this cat at night. Big moon again, nature, we could argue, is the main theme, at least according to what Anis was saying in the Twitter space a couple of months ago. Here is work by Sabato Dejan Daemon. So, of course, Dejen was the crypto that was airdropped to everybody as part of using farcaster. So here, a celebration of sorts. Higher.
00:50:32.984 - 00:50:51.748, Speaker A: Yes. No. And we remember, remember, there's the ordinal daemon, or demon daemon. We'll call it demon. Here's the Deejan demon. So a pretty cool series. I wonder, is this done on? My question is, is this minted on Zora, or is this minted? Oh, it's done with Deegen.
00:50:51.748 - 00:51:09.706, Speaker A: Quite brilliant, actually. Quite brilliant. So getting 31, and I can't remember how much Degen is going for. So all to say, cool crypto work from Sabato. Here's a more edgier one. Liquidity pools. And this was minted on Zora maybe three days ago.
00:51:09.706 - 00:51:33.450, Speaker A: So, again, interesting kind of minimal composition here. And, of course, liquidity pools, referring to crypto, the way that crypto is traded. Brain dead. Here we have a kind of a simple but interesting animation here of liquid. And just an interesting cycled gif. Really nice, kind of gray blue in the background there. That's on object edition of ten.
00:51:33.450 - 00:51:54.506, Speaker A: And that is five tezos each. And mech picking one up. Here's loac me addition of 50. These are five tezos each. And they're going, how many are left here? 34 left. Pretty cool animation. Interesting negative space, isn't there? Isn't there? That's almost one of the most interesting, kind of strangest decisions of all.
00:51:54.506 - 00:52:24.264, Speaker A: Look at quite an optical illusion here. It seems to change every time I see it cycle through. Very cool pixel artwork, analog pixel artwork, 256 by 256, upscaled to 1024. Here's Silva sand two surfing the glitch number two. And this is an open edition tezos 30. So someone surfing through the glitch over here. So cool work there.
00:52:24.264 - 00:52:39.432, Speaker A: And just a nice, simple glitch here. Takahashi, medjikin this. So this is NES. Here is Lorna Mills. And maybe this was burned, but maybe there's a newer version. Not sure. Cool work.
00:52:39.432 - 00:52:59.744, Speaker A: We're kind of back to the model airplane. We're back in the toy store here. Very nice. Kind of simple yellow work with an old toy plane. And kind of, again, all the fun of the plane. Plane is kind of reflected in the work here. Interestingly, with the face on, with the almost unhappy face or the scared face at the back.
00:52:59.744 - 00:53:22.528, Speaker A: Interesting piece, Francoise Gamme. Here's another really interesting abstract by Francoise Gammer. And again showing the animated and the static version. Interestingly interesting, interesting. Here's another very interesting work. Look at that description. I think this is XP, QZL or abacus systems.
00:53:22.528 - 00:53:46.324, Speaker A: Not sure. Let's look at the work. And I don't think there's any volume here. So kind of like a video game, as you can see here. So very wild work. I feel like I've seen a work by this artist before. So how long? This is a minute 47.
00:53:46.324 - 00:54:27.076, Speaker A: So we probably can't look at the whole thing. But as you can see, a pretty weirdly ambitious, like a very ambitious work here, as you can see. Wild one. Oh, there is music we'll play just a bit. Totally wild work. Wild, wild, wild, wild work here. So check that out.
00:54:27.076 - 00:54:38.584, Speaker A: That's on tea. Also on object. That is 13 tezos and I believe there are twelve left, if I am not mistaken. Here's Vozo. Let's see if this has music too. Doi fei. Oh, it does.
00:54:38.584 - 00:55:01.710, Speaker A: Always has like gorgeous sound from Zozo. Let's see if it plays. Something very powerful. Forgive the Internet here. Something very powerful. There's kind of like nostalgia meets. Yeah.
00:55:01.710 - 00:55:31.140, Speaker A: Not sure what's going to, but always kind of capturing these powerful emotions and beautiful music. There's like. Look at that. I think that's a sun. I mean, this pink and yellow square sun, it's gorgeous. And I mean, you just do these stills. Again, we're looking at animated and static versions of all these.
00:55:31.140 - 00:56:01.024, Speaker A: So even this brush work, I assume that's a brush. Very mysterious work. Cartlus data. This is by Abramowski and edition of seven for five tezos. Another interesting piece here. Kind of looks like some of those ancient statues that you'll see in where in like Turkey or Persia. Almost looks persian.
00:56:01.024 - 00:56:14.528, Speaker A: Interesting work there. Mother of Georgia. Maybe that's the clue. So maybe a mother goddess. Not sure. This from January 7. So maybe this was just posted on X and ended up here.
00:56:14.528 - 00:56:34.454, Speaker A: As we continue, Luis Andre Gamma. So working with fractals. Pretty cool piece. Kind of powerful. Over. If you have a problem with the flash, I won't leave it on too long here, but beautiful colors here. Windowpane edition of four and looks like sold out at 1010 and five.
00:56:34.454 - 00:56:46.814, Speaker A: Nice work there. Just another interesting abstract. This is also 2002, I believe. Dreaming three. This is on Zora. And two minted so far. 89 days to go.
00:56:46.814 - 00:57:00.624, Speaker A: Interesting abstract drawing. Right. Black and white. Here's Curo. And I believe this should actually load up. This is Kirowan foundation. I think this is a new one.
00:57:00.624 - 00:57:25.998, Speaker A: So we figure everything out here. Having slight Internet issues here today, and let's let that load up. And here is Rannixteer. And this is from Zora. So another beautiful abstract from Rannick Steer. Just beautiful color and interesting composition. We'll see if this loads up for Kiro.
00:57:25.998 - 00:57:48.622, Speaker A: Otherwise, we'll try this from August 14. So we may have even shown this on a previous show. So, all to say, I don't think we're having much luck here. All to say, yeah, I think we'll just have to let that one go. Continuing on, Klaus, composition 178. Some beautiful, beautiful one of ones. Continuing on this series here.
00:57:48.622 - 00:58:12.814, Speaker A: Again, as we approach 200 beautiful textures and colors. We saw Klaus in the studio just the other day. Here's another one, number 179, where Klaus was showing images of all the wires and everything that it takes and all of the processing. Again, we're back to this. Vintage synths. Vintage synths and vintage software. Composition 180.
00:58:12.814 - 00:58:38.422, Speaker A: So again, just beautiful work here from Klaus. This is 21 tezos. One of one here is Sarah Kretschmer. So, playing with AI here. New experiment in layering, painting, blender processing, and AI. So working across several tools here. And as we see, kind of interestingly, kind of cropped there.
00:58:38.422 - 00:58:57.306, Speaker A: And just cool. You can tell there's brushwork, but you can tell it's processed. And again, there's AI in here. So just novel imagery from Sarah Kretschmer. I think we have another one here, too. Mix a painting. I'm playing with layering technologies to see how far I can push the original, letting tech guide the process.
00:58:57.306 - 00:59:20.012, Speaker A: So all very cool to see here. And really interesting textures here over here. So, again, you can kind of see the AI distortions in here. Interestingly so, using all sorts of tools. Just cool experimentation, abstract experimentation from Sarah Kretschmer. Continuing here's little cakes. Beautiful work.
00:59:20.012 - 00:59:34.812, Speaker A: I wonder if this is new. It's just beautiful. I love the composition here. And again, more synths. Kind of looks like a sampler or a mixing board here. And I'm not sure. I don't think we've seen this one, but we may have.
00:59:34.812 - 00:59:54.360, Speaker A: So it's almost like cakes in the studio, perhaps? Not sure. Secret interior life when I'm in the cloud. So again, open studio music stable diffusion and improps. So interesting there. Here, another AI artwork. This is no hygiene. Little cakes picked this one up.
00:59:54.360 - 01:00:16.134, Speaker A: Toast, I thought a super original one from no hygiene here. So a sandwich that turns into a baby at the end. So just very experimental AI artwork as usual. AI made with mid journey. And how are we doing? We're going to be right on schedule here as we go into the physical. Sophie wake ducks night activity. Gouache on paper.
01:00:16.134 - 01:00:39.244, Speaker A: So interesting piece here. Beautiful work found on Instagram gouache. So here is another one by Bondozo bandido. And I thought, again, just keeping things, constantly experimenting. I thought this was quite a beautiful one. Great contrast here with the texture. And again, kind of the airbrush and the spray over here.
01:00:39.244 - 01:00:51.464, Speaker A: Interesting composition. Just working like crazy. Look at this great kind of negative space there. There's something to be said for working fast. Here's another one. It's not gallery. Ricardo Passaport.
01:00:51.464 - 01:01:20.268, Speaker A: Passaporte. And there's something about these very simple works here that I find very appealing. I don't know what it is. You could argue this is a pretty simple work of just a lion done with airbrush, but there's something very appealing about it. Again, it's not gallery who we follow very closely here. That is your show, my friends, thank you for joining me. And until next time, we'll see you on Wednesday for the Twitter space and another show, which will also be short.
01:01:20.268 - 01:01:21.284, Speaker A: Until next time. Take care.
