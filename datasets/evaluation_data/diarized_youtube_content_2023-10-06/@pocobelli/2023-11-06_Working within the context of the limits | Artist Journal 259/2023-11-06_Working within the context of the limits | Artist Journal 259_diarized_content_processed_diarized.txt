00:00:02.760 - 00:00:31.418, Speaker A: Welcome back, everybody. It is a new day and a new week. I haven't broadcast since Tuesday, so it is perhaps the most tabs I've ever had open, which is saying something for those that have been around for a while. Artist Journal, November 6, 2023. Broadcasting from Ortegia, the ancient city at the heart of Syracuse. A historic, huge, I would argue, ancient city. Probably the biggest ancient city I've ever seen.
00:00:31.418 - 00:01:14.564, Speaker A: My name is Adrian Pokebelly, and unfortunately, we don't have the view behind us on this one. Maybe I could go up to the terrace, but I feel like I'm going to wake up the entire neighborhood. Sicilians like to pay attention what's going on around them, so the neighbors. So I thought I'd be a little more discreet here in this kind of kitchen, living room of sorts here, as we continue our journey, one more week on the road here and then back to Berlin, which you start to appreciate the, quote, unquote, the normalcy of the studio at a certain point and everything. The Internet. I am back online, which is why I took off the last couple of days. I mentioned it in the Twitter space, but for those that might have been wondering, it just became too much.
00:01:14.564 - 00:01:47.948, Speaker A: All the data usage from the phone, I think I spent â‚¬60 just on data usage last week. It would have been another 60 had I done another episode, took it a couple of days off, and toured Palermo, actually, and saw some very important mosaics there in the chapel. Palatino, I think, is what you'd call it. So it's been a fabulous journey. So lots of arts and lots of letters here. As we begin with RJ, the summary work here, it feels like a summary work of this episode. And here we are.
00:01:47.948 - 00:02:22.236, Speaker A: It's a pixel artwork. And let me actually zoom in a little bit for us, if I can. Here we go. Just to get a sense of RJ's, again, pixel art pastiche. So, as you can see, RJ, and we'll even go even closer here. You can basically see here how RJ likes to, you know, keep a nice low pixel canvas, because it gives you these more jagged pixels here. Right? And this is like, weirdly, I would argue this is kind of classic RJ, this pixelation here.
00:02:22.236 - 00:03:08.824, Speaker A: If you ask me, which artist does this pixelation here remind you of? I'd say RJ. Now, RJ is like his dribble waffle, who, you know, waffle, uses waffles, uses a lot of softwares, but one of the softwares, or ways of working, as far as I understand, is a lot of these JavaScript art programs that you can just load up in a web browser. There's something to be said for that, this kind of free aspect. Santiago mentioned that on a space, maybe in February or March. So, yeah, and when we talked to RJ proudly, and there's a great episode. If you've never heard RJ, and you're a fan, you can hear RJ on a space. We did, I don't know, four months ago.
00:03:08.824 - 00:03:32.684, Speaker A: And it's actually super fascinating. And his very deep voice there, it's well worth a listen. And RJ also uses basically something for free. You can open up in your browser. And so here it is. So you see a pixel art pastiche, and I'll show you the original. As you can see here, it's probably the one, it's basically the same size, so it's probably the one that RJ actually used.
00:03:32.684 - 00:04:01.128, Speaker A: And let me just make this norm. Is that 100%? There we go. As you see here. And you can see, look at the shadow. So you see the interpretation here in the shadow in the background, for example, and everything. And then of course, the pepe, you know, which kind of is symbolic, it kind of sums up this is, if this, this isn't a newspaper of the imagination today, this is a book of the imagination. This is like half the tabs, maybe a third.
00:04:01.128 - 00:04:44.852, Speaker A: I'm gonna go really fast, just to warn you. So apologies in advance to all the artists. We're going to move fast because there's simply too much to go through. And I'm trying to shorten the episodes, and they're turning longer by the sheer quality and quantity of work, which makes me extraordinarily bullish on this scene. So again, and here, painted in a different brush, I think, is what's going on. And I suspect from the same program, kind of more of a paintbrush sort of thing. We have the contrast here of the pixel art, and then we have the work here, the pepe, done with a different brush, and it creates a beautiful contrast, doesn't it? It kind of makes the work, kind of makes it feel modern too, in its own way, clearly with the pixel art.
00:04:44.852 - 00:05:11.284, Speaker A: So there they have mercury, here we have Pepe. So, just another awesome, awesome work by RJ, who was saying, can finally see the end of the piece I've been working on for weeks. The last Pepe pastiche. It's by far the most ambitious piece I've ever put together. And I'm exhausted but excited and nervous to share maybe a day or two more. So this was written a couple of days ago, referring, I believe, to this work here. Allegory of the arts or the supremacy of painting.
00:05:11.284 - 00:05:35.594, Speaker A: Pepe and 787 by 1000. And the original artist is Pompeo Girolamo Batoni, allegory of the arts, which we're just looking at. So minted. I assume it'll be an auction, but let's see. Huge thank you to Brian, also known as moneymaker 21, for picking up this work. Yesterday, another promoted story. I made this in Rome.
00:05:35.594 - 00:05:55.528, Speaker A: It's great working on your phone on the road. I mean, it feels something kind of glorious. I bring it into master in Photoshop, but thank you for the purchase, moneymaker. That lasted all of two minutes there. So thrilling. And thank you, Robnis. I mean, maybe one of the most prominent accounts in the NFT art scene.
00:05:55.528 - 00:06:11.424, Speaker A: Wish I could have acquired it. Pokebelly dropping serious fire. Love it, my friend. Well, big shout out and massive. Thank you. I still remember our Duchamp episode that we did. What would we call it? Is this a Duchamp moment? And there was Robnuss work there.
00:06:11.424 - 00:06:32.500, Speaker A: So thank you, Robnis official. Appreciate the. Because it makes a difference when, you know a major prominent account in this scene retweets you. It is a wonderful thing. And now it's already up to 8000 and it's been about 12 hours. So again, massive thank you. And I love this community, you know, like I was thinking to myself, I've never been part of a club.
00:06:32.500 - 00:07:04.008, Speaker A: I've never been an insider in any club, basically, except for this one, is one that I could feel like. I don't know if I'd call myself an insider. I'm just doing my thing. I answer messages and everything, but I do feel like I'm a part of a club of a certain kind and it's glorious and wonderful and beautiful and I'd say it's the most open club I've ever seen in the arts. So come one, come all, it's just a glorious thing and it's so much fun and it's completely international. It's just wonderful. So.
00:07:04.008 - 00:07:21.766, Speaker A: And thank you robnis v two for picking up this for tb. 303 sketch. 303 sketch for ten tezos on secondary. Big shout out and thank you. And thank you, Poly Jojo. I saw this. I think it was sent to me, actually, this was sent to me.
00:07:21.766 - 00:07:44.834, Speaker A: So I assumed that that figure was me and then I was like, is that Luciana Guerra? I think that's my guess. If it's someone else, please let me know. That looks like Luciana Guerra. So we were doing American Gothic here, courtesy of pauly Jojo. Pretty cool. I'm just thrilled again. I mean, you gotta love this community here.
00:07:44.834 - 00:07:53.526, Speaker A: You just gotta love it. So big. Thank you. Cool piece. Nice portrait. Interesting portrait. I'm amazed at how people get the hair.
00:07:53.526 - 00:08:12.334, Speaker A: I mean, the hair, the color and even the part. I mean, maybe like. Yeah, I mean, the part is even pretty close, the way it's all done. So a lot of skill, I assume. I've never tried doing the photo AI. So again, just humbling and massive. Thank you.
00:08:12.334 - 00:08:27.350, Speaker A: A few comments here I want to go through on yesterday's show. Let's see if we can make it bigger. Rune tune. The people are talking. This commentary around the art matter show is totally exciting for me. Thanks for diving in. Absolutely.
00:08:27.350 - 00:08:44.330, Speaker A: And isn't it great, this conversation we can have here? I'm thrilled that people comment and everything. It's a fascinating discussion. We're gonna actually see a whole bunch more of it here today as well. Thank you for including me. This is cider. Thank you for including me. Once again, Poco.
00:08:44.330 - 00:09:06.674, Speaker A: I love this episode and it's always cool to see how well you speak of me, man. Sometimes I wonder if I deserve all that love. Ha ha. Have a good one. I was, you know, I do have a tendency to be over bullish sometimes when I'm into like, an investment or if I really like an artist. So as I joked with cider, it's a fair question. But you're.
00:09:06.674 - 00:09:49.274, Speaker A: I mean, again, though, cider, in my opinion, is a natural. And it's kind of even emphasized by the fact that cider is not like self admittedly on his part. When we had him in the space, again, another glorious space there. Cider was saying, I don't have a lot of art history behind me, but it's kind of surprising. Like, again, I think there's an intuition there on cider's part. So, as I like to say, a natural rune tune as well here. Regarding pro profligacy, prolificness, I suppose you are right that well recognized artists the last 150 years have always been prolific.
00:09:49.274 - 00:10:16.774, Speaker A: Yes. The only example of venerated artists who were not prolific that come to minds are ones prior to the late 19th century. Hieronymus Bosch, Pieter Bruegel. Bruegel, various other Netherland Flemish painters. It's kind of true, actually. And again, we're talking about Vermeer as well, in that kind of, I mean, different style, of course, but also kind of Flemish. I believe Vermeer is flemish.
00:10:16.774 - 00:10:48.470, Speaker A: Yeah. And most of those guys only lived to 40 years old, so a lot of that could be attributed to a lack of technology and medicine that kept them from faster production and longer lives. Point taken. Skomra I'd love to see someone tell an instance of chat JPT to start painting and then hook it up to one of those machines and disconnect it from the human output. I think I was showing that last episode. I'm not sure if I was within all my Internet troubles, but I think I did mention it that Dali three connected with chat. GPT I think this is what Skarm was talking about.
00:10:48.470 - 00:11:18.176, Speaker A: Then just see the evolution of the works if it's possible. As the AI tries to develop its own style, it's probably not too far off, at least the attempt. You probably could, you know, chat JBT make a new style of painting, abstract work lightly based on combining, you know, Mondrian and, you know, abstract expressionism. Great show. Thanks for showing two of my works as ever, and we have a couple more here. Skamra, you're keeping it interesting for me over here. So thrilled to do it.
00:11:18.176 - 00:11:47.284, Speaker A: Also, great show with Santiago. Izzikotl let me try reloading this page here because sometimes, sometimes it's easier. There we go. If you go on his show, let us know. I'd love to hear the long form discussions. Yeah, maybe in three weeks when I'm back in Berlin, I'll go on Santiago's long form Friday night show. Some Friday that's just kind of a lazy Friday.
00:11:47.284 - 00:12:04.326, Speaker A: We can do that. Kiro thanks for showing my artworks is a digital painting on procreate with some analog it is a digital painting with procreate and some analog treatment. Love your shows as usual. Watching daily. Thank you Kiro. Have a safe trip. Looks nice there it is.
00:12:04.326 - 00:12:24.294, Speaker A: If people are interested, actually, I put them in the stories on Instagram. If people want to see these cities I'm in, it's pretty stunning. And I'd never heard of Ortega. I actually booked a trip. I just wanted to see Syracuse and it turns out that it's actually a major tourist destination, just so you know. Pipee universal. Thanks.
00:12:24.294 - 00:12:57.796, Speaker A: Poco Santiago is a codal. Tremontina is a brand of knives from Brazil, so referring to Pipi Universal's painting and popular in Latin America and also sold in the USA. So that's the knife on the window sill that we saw. So that is great. So thank you San Diego. Izucodal thank you white solitude, Rada Spooky Halloween and Eduardo Pulitzer Edmarola and I'm afraid Ankowar Wat and Carthage are mixed up. Maybe those referring to works from last episode and of course, Tombham Battle.
00:12:57.796 - 00:13:51.356, Speaker A: Thank you all. I mean, all star cast in the comments here. So this was kind of a big thing that went around ordinals, of course, the bitcoin, the bitcoin wallet that does the on chain, nfts. Elon Musk, I'm bullish on ordinals, not nfts. So a lot of you already saw that, at least encode the JPEG in the blockchain because like, if the URL, if the company housing the image goes out of business, you don't have the image anymore. So a lot of us are familiar with this argument, which is this idea that, because the way that, for those that don't know, and I'm not an expert, but I've just kind of been around enough where I have a clue. Anybody, feel free to correct me if I get anything wrong here.
00:13:51.356 - 00:14:47.246, Speaker A: But basically the way it works is the NFT. Basically, when you most NFT platforms, you basically upload the image to IPFS international protocol file server where the image gets stored separately from the blockchain. It's also decentralized storage, but basically all the blockchain, usually what it is, is a link to another file in the cloud, so to speak. Decentralized cloud. And what Elon Musk is basically saying here is if one of those decentralized clouds decides to stop doing business, goes out of business, you're, where are your, where is your JPeg? Where's your art piece? And saying, and with bitcoin, it's inscribed, not minted, but inscribed into the actual blockchain. Somehow it's written in. So, and those are what are called ordinals.
00:14:47.246 - 00:15:10.542, Speaker A: So Elon Musk singing the praises of ordinals because it's all on chain. And we've been having this discussion with Spiegel's maskinen's art rip cash. We're going to see some more. And we've been having that discussion on. And you need really low file sizes. And I was talking how there's like an elegance. And we're going to look at that in a second here in trying to make it small but still pretty.
00:15:10.542 - 00:16:10.812, Speaker A: And so it's just a fun, for me, it's a fun challenge. And there is something to be said, you know, is like nuclear Armageddon, you know, should there be a nuclear Armageddon? Well, maybe bitcoin survives on a certain level, but maybe ipfs, for example, might not. I mean, there is the, the argument can be made, right, that you should have at least something on, on like on chain, there is a benefit. It's one less, you know, vulnerability point, it's one less pressure point, right? So like, in a sense, like Elon Musk coming from a distance, the argument, it's not a terrible argument. That being said, there are huge limitations to minting on chain, particularly the size. And unless you're ready to spend tens of thousands of dollars on minting again, I was going to mint the peloponnesian war. I was going to take it off ETH and put it on bitcoin as ordinals.
00:16:10.812 - 00:16:47.096, Speaker A: That was going to cost me $4,000 each because they're about four megabytes, or it was even at like 400 kb. It was something like a couple of $1,000 actually, if I'm not mistaken, is what I was quoted on. So we kind of nixed that idea. And here, bitcoin ordinals. So ethnft is being pushed down the stairs. So ordinals is getting bullish on the commentary. Art Gnome, who I think is the founder, if I'm not mistaken, of right click Save as magazine and major early NFT advocate me in 2018, NFTs are not on the blockchain, it's just a URL to the JPEG.
00:16:47.096 - 00:17:29.304, Speaker A: If the company housing the image goes out of business, you don't have the image anymore. So basically, Artnome saying, this is me in 2018. And actually Artnome has a service for backing up your nfts for this very issue. What is it called? It's like, back up your nfts, just go to rightclick save.com. And I think so if the Internet actually works here today. And so here a prominent nft, Jason Bailey, art gnome. And for those that are wondering here, so there's a whole article on this and he's talking about how, you know, a lot of startups fail bringing up the same argument.
00:17:29.304 - 00:17:41.704, Speaker A: And here, this is just what I wanted to highlight. Protect your NFT collection and discover new artists. So protect your NFT collection. So back it up. Probably locally, I think is what they do. You probably just put in your wallets, I assume. I've never tried it.
00:17:41.704 - 00:18:15.348, Speaker A: I should. Continuing on this discussion here, Kvon. Ethereum is not designed to be a storage layer, right? Referring to minting things on change, the on chain NFT discussion is ignoring this fact. Arweave and ipfs are being disregarded as dependencies when they are purposely made to handle storage. Ethereum and decentralized storage are both needed. So a response from Kayvon and who is Kayvon? CEO co founder of foundation. Okay, that is who Kevin is.
00:18:15.348 - 00:19:03.710, Speaker A: Ripcash quoting Kayvon on chain art isn't ignoring this. So responding to the tweet we just read from Kvon, artists exploring fully on chain art, consider the major storage constraint and the various ways to make it work as part of the context in which that specific art is made. It's part of what makes it fun. Exactly. So kind of taking all of the above argument is, and this is how I, and I think Ripcash has kind of nailed it here, where it's just kind of a challenge. It's fun, there's something to be said for it, but it's not necessarily saying that's all that matters is work that's put on change. So it's part of and the word I used was elegant.
00:19:03.710 - 00:19:40.154, Speaker A: Like when Rip Cache's work that were put on change on chain, they're kind of elegant. And if you can make it beautiful or SPgls maskinen, the same thing. These beautiful works that Spiegels was putting, these almost, you know, ruined technological ruins, those are beautiful. This isn't an attack on arweave or ipfs, by the way. Those technology solutions are useful and can exist in tandem for various much needed use cases. But on chain art is an artistic choice and collector preference. In either case, it's true, when you put it on chain, you're probably more likely to sell it.
00:19:40.154 - 00:20:00.122, Speaker A: Like it will kind of open up in a sense. You could argue that collectors see on chain art as more valuable oftentimes, especially like hardcore ETH collectors, the argument could be made. There is no right answer. It's just different. I agree. Different work is possible within those constraints in mind. Exactly.
00:20:00.122 - 00:20:47.860, Speaker A: And I think, yeah, I mean, if there was more space and it was cheaper, probably people you wouldn't need, you know, like if you could just put it on a chain cheaply and as large as you want, then there wouldn't be the need for these decentralized file storage. For another, more controversial example, the side of a building is also a terrible canvas for a variety of reasons, but creating art on the side of a building has informed a multi decade subculture of artistic expression that continues to evolve to this day. The artwork usually has a different message if you can lean a canvas up against the same wall instead, both have different intentions. Exactly. They are different mediums in a sense, or different places to, you know, host art, so to speak. And you know, as good artists do, they take that in mind. They keep that in mind while they're working the context.
00:20:47.860 - 00:21:01.586, Speaker A: Right. And even comment on the process in the, in the process. So a very interesting discussion there. And then Yuri J. Water lily songs. New series of art on chain. That seems.
00:21:01.586 - 00:21:21.966, Speaker A: I wasn't sure if Yuri J was joking because these look like pretty complex works to put on chain like this. They don't look small, but maybe they're small file size. So not sure. I think I will never do this four in one tweets again. So I'm not sure if Yuri J. Is being serious here. New series of art on chain.
00:21:21.966 - 00:21:57.514, Speaker A: Because then we got a link to object. So I'm not exactly sure, but maybe because, look, there's eight scribo here. So rip cash was wondering, or someone else was wondering, has this been done on tazos on chain art? Xerox with the answer. Xerox knows. Not only does tezos have on chain art, I didn't know this. It has dedicated on chain platforms like eight scribo and eight bidoo. And it's so funny that this is mentioned because I thought, oh, it would have been great to put those eight BDU works I had on chain thinking about ordinals, but I guess they already are on chain.
00:21:57.514 - 00:22:25.048, Speaker A: Okay, so just interesting. So Xerox, again with the knowledge. And here was a new work by Ripcash, my first fully animated fully on chain, one of one. And so if you're wondering where the animation is, you'll see it in the x here. So again, I wonder how big this is. That is an interesting question, isn't it? So interesting. Cool work here.
00:22:25.048 - 00:22:56.994, Speaker A: So ripcache continuing with the on chain. I want to do some on chain stuff just for fun. And finally, a lot of ripcache here on Christie's website here. Digital art and nfts. And a big ripcache. So how cool is that? Continuing on, Spiegelsmaskinen also, who has put a lot of on chain works on ETH, has a big show here, 64 by 64 by times spiegels. So this is probably a 64 by 64 bit screen here.
00:22:56.994 - 00:23:30.424, Speaker A: Almost like a light, bright screen. And we've been seeing these screens posted by Spiegels Maskinen for the last, I don't know, month or two. And so maybe it was all in preparation of figuring out how to make this digital show physical. And look at this ancient computer. I haven't even looked at this video. So just a beautiful example of how you can kind of cross over, really, to the physical art gallery scene. What an incredible job they've done.
00:23:30.424 - 00:23:51.214, Speaker A: Looks like a really cool show. Cool music too. Reminds me of that abnormaliser. He's like, look at this. So it's pretty exciting. And look at the outside. Spuegelsmaskinen.
00:23:51.214 - 00:24:15.146, Speaker A: So it continues to, this scene continues to encroach on the wider world here. And here is just a 128 by 128. Interestingly, you know, just within the context of our on chain discussion. Remarkably small. And look at that, the phone. Four desktops. Yeah, I mean, the retro computer.
00:24:15.146 - 00:24:28.924, Speaker A: So just really, really, really cool. At Bricks gallery. I believe this is in Copenhagen. Here it is. Thank you to everyone who came out yesterday to the opening of the desktop in Copenhagen. It was fire. So here is the opening.
00:24:28.924 - 00:25:00.478, Speaker A: Here's a beautiful palm tree. Nicely attended opening, I might add. So much work and these great screens. So again, you know, we're discussing how on chain art, it's working within. It's working within the context of the limits. I mean, that's what spguls maskinen is doing here. Working within the context of the limits of the physical gallery space.
00:25:00.478 - 00:25:33.386, Speaker A: How do I turn my physical works or my digital works physical? And here are some solutions working within the context of the limitations. And continuing on with some physical artwork here from Mikey Wilson. Look who came to sign prints today at Mikey Wilson here. And there is that beautiful signature there. And three of ten. Sticking with the ten of ten, a collector knows, as Mikey Wilson does. Ten is a really nice addition number, isn't it? So it's looking great.
00:25:33.386 - 00:25:57.834, Speaker A: And you got to love that size. It's very practical. Like, you could put it, you know, literally in the living room and it'd look great. Continuing on, some physical work here. Julien Gachadot, mineral eleven. So as you can see here, just kind of impressively, I'm not sure if this is manual. I mean, maybe we open this larger here.
00:25:57.834 - 00:26:40.154, Speaker A: It's looking pretty cool, isn't it? I guess maybe there's a projector. I'm not sure how like, it looks plotted, doesn't it? Maybe it's plotted, not sure, but looking pretty cool. Clownvamp. So more on the art matter paintings. What did robot assisted art look like in 2023? A meditation on giving up control in the latent space. This is an expression, the latent space, that a lot of AI artists use. The hidden space, maybe referring to the imagination or the space that AI takes place in the latent kind of secret, hidden kind of space.
00:26:40.154 - 00:27:08.740, Speaker A: My first collection of physicals, each with a 26 by 39 painted robot crafted by art matter auctions are now open a thread with each piece of the story. So these, I believe are clownvamps works here. So again, kind of wisely choosing some very painterly works here, I would argue on clownvamps part. That was very smart. And Lily illo with some more reflections here. Thoughts on the auction and the entire reflections exhibition. Just going to take a highlight here.
00:27:08.740 - 00:27:49.716, Speaker A: I can't get the little robot out of my head. Many nights as I lay in bed, I just wondered where it is on the x y axis at any given moment. Is it tracking along the brow line or indenting a hive on the chin? It's pretty cool how you can be sleeping. And it's producing work. The whole exhibition has been an inquiry into mark making, collaboration and authorship, and finally employing processes at the intersection of old and new mediums using digital and traditional tools, AI diffusion, digital painting, oil paint, printing processes, and drawing techniques, to imagine new works and to make new marks in new ways. And some thank yous over here. So just really cool.
00:27:49.716 - 00:28:14.604, Speaker A: And these were physicals, this kind of hive portrait series by Lily Illo. So just super cool. And other more victories here. Strange thing, my first physical, who was also in the show, has sold for $2,689. The sale was to a web two trad collector from Instagram. More encroachment here. So unfortunately I can't tag this amazing person.
00:28:14.604 - 00:28:52.752, Speaker A: They're not even on x. Interestingly so. And you know, like the art, I'd say as digital artists, we do pretty good with like someone I can't remember if was Artie Hands was saying, there's something like 200 collectors kind of commenting. There's probably more than 200 collectors in this scene. But I took the point that there's not that many collectors and people still do all right in this scene. What happens should web two trad art collectors really come on board? Which could happen. I mean, it seems inevitable to me.
00:28:52.752 - 00:29:32.582, Speaker A: And what happens when that 200 goes to like 20,000 or 2000 collectors? Kind of wild to think about. So this is a physical, and I'd love to see this just a little closer to see the pixelation there again. Yeah, you see how it looks like inkjet and two more sold, two more physical oils have sold two and a half ETH, $4,600 to the ab with sincere gratitude. Thank you. And here they are. So again, looking pretty spectacular here, physicals, you know, so just very, very cool. And so great work from strange thing.
00:29:32.582 - 00:30:10.496, Speaker A: And this is pale kirill. And we're going to have a page. So this is also, let me bring this up big. This is also, I believe, art matter. And so this is pretty interesting, too, because it's kind of a bit more, shall we say, painterly in its approach. And so almost like we were seeing with those clown vamps, like, the more painterly it is, you know? And this is kind of like, versus, say, the strange thing where it's going to be slightly flatter. I think there's still going to be texture, but that's more of like an oil painting, so it's not going to have a ton of texture.
00:30:10.496 - 00:30:42.510, Speaker A: It's interesting how art matter interprets texture. So all to say, very cool from pale Kirill and several here in the quote, unquote, not me, probably referring to the art matter robot series. 2 hours to go. 16 pieces, three sold at the pre sale, four with bids nine. And again, this, people love this painterly action here. Nine available with half an ETH reserve, including a physical oil painting using art matters robot technology. And this is on presence tender dot art.
00:30:42.510 - 00:31:04.846, Speaker A: And here's a quick scroll here. And I believe I brought this up here. Not me by Kirill Semenovich. And here you can see the whole series. And I think Kirill was saying there's nine of these are physical, so pretty cool. Sold for half an ETH here. That work that we're just looking at now.
00:31:04.846 - 00:31:42.718, Speaker A: Also, we can't forget Helio Santos here, Primavera one, who is doing completely different robot work here now in the GTOM 5551 collection. One of my greatest collectors. Thank you so much. Synthetic landscape generated with machine learning, painted with a drawing robot. So Helios Santos actually does, from what I could tell, from what I've discerned here, just doing this show and looking at Helios's work over time. Helio Santos's work over time, it's taking different colors and using the robot with. So it's a different technique.
00:31:42.718 - 00:32:13.530, Speaker A: You could argue it's much closer, this technique to actual painting. And you get all these interesting blobs here. So even though just one person here doing some very interesting innovation, it's almost like they should talk. It's almost like they should talk. Continuing on, so fascinating discussion, as Runetun was saying early on here, cider. And we're almost at the artwork here. Took me five to six months to sell my first NFT, and I didn't even sell it.
00:32:13.530 - 00:32:44.354, Speaker A: I gave it away to Omente as a sign of gratitude. Theoretically, it wasn't a good start and not for instantly selling, but here we are. Always believe in yourself and work on improving and it's kind of true, like, 12,000. And those are, like, real followers. Like, even here, you see, like, cider does really well, and artworks are some of the most kind of viewed, I'd argue, in this whole scene. So Aldous says insider sells well. So cider knows here.
00:32:44.354 - 00:33:04.790, Speaker A: Haiti Rockette. Hi tezos. Collected 3059 artworks from 778 artists. Different artists. Only sold one edition. Currently owned 3753 artworks and 7314 editions. Averaged four artworks a day.
00:33:04.790 - 00:33:35.740, Speaker A: Active days, 761st and last collected April 3, 2021, and November 1, 2023. So just, you know, for those that don't know Haiti Rocket's work, like, you know, that was the person who really sold me. And just because I saw his work, I had no idea who he was or whatever, but that was the person who. It was his art that sold me on object. And I was like, these glitch roms are. There's something here. And it was through Heidi Rockette that I discovered Sabato's work.
00:33:35.740 - 00:33:56.636, Speaker A: I think it was a still life of fruit in a. You know, so. And also Kurt Hussle collective by checking out Heidi Rockette's collection. So this doesn't surprise me, is all to say, walk. Now, this is a little long. I want to read the whole thing, but I'm not going to. But I'd suggest you do, because it almost sounds like a manifesto of sorts.
00:33:56.636 - 00:34:44.310, Speaker A: And talking about being in Italy, where creative ideas are maybe sometimes overly thought over. And as he was saying here, since I was 14, I've been using the Internet not only to share and commercialize my artistic product, but more importantly, as a source from which to draw valuable material from my research. It makes his work very contemporary, doesn't it? A lot of walks, whether it's Britney Spears, Cele. In a sense, there's a lot of overlap between kind of what I'm concerned about to a certain degree, and walk. Like Internet, pop culture, I guess you might call it, or Internet culture. Anyways, let's continue here. During this extended exploration of such a vast and universal world, I have encountered and overcome dynamics that have allowed me to gratify and sustain myself, unlike the conventional system for which I could have miserably perished a long time ago.
00:34:44.310 - 00:35:20.818, Speaker A: And let this be a clarion call to all artists who are, you know, basically ignored by the conventional art system. Like, you might be able to find a place for yourself here. And, you know, and probably most people who are watching this have already kind of made a little space for themselves. But it's kind of an open. It's an open door, you know? So I just think there's a lot to be said for this, and I'm the same way. You know, I would have miserably perished a long time ago. I would still be making work, but I was completely ignored.
00:35:20.818 - 00:35:53.494, Speaker A: And now it's like, at least you have a place where you can kind of build something. In the last two years, my personal production has undergone a gradual process of digitalization, physically manifested on the web with the help of eBay, and digitally within web3. I mean, eBay leveraging blockchain technology. In the meantime, all the physical production created previously had been catalogued and permanently archived. Art is not a pastime. So walk almost throwing down the gauntlet a little bit here. Art is not a pastime.
00:35:53.494 - 00:36:15.008, Speaker A: I mean, it's a beautiful statement, a commitment. It is. I assume it's a way of life, is what walk is saying here. This isn't some hobby. I need my work to be instantly perceived, realized, exported, and made physically accessible to anyone today. On the contrary, I don't need someone to benefit from my idea without valuing it. Following this pattern.
00:36:15.008 - 00:36:42.772, Speaker A: And this is what I wanted to get to here, following this pattern. From now on, anyone who wants to view, study, or purchase my works will have the opportunity to do so exclusively through the use of a device with an Internet connection. Exclusively. This is not artistic nonconformity, but simply the result of the times. It sounds like a beautiful, you know, man, I think walks italian. It sounds like a beautiful. It reminds me of the futurist manifesto, which is very kind of combative.
00:36:42.772 - 00:37:12.874, Speaker A: I wouldn't call this combative, but it's kind of rough. It's a little bit rough and tumble, and I love it. See, on the street and there is walk a beautiful kind of manifesto of sorts there from the great walk. And just a heads up here from one of one, which has a sub stack. They're actually going to be on the spaces in a coup in maybe two or three weeks. I'm really excited about that. They have an interview with Martin Bruch, Martin Bruce also, which is the account that we often see as Martin Bruch.
00:37:12.874 - 00:37:29.534, Speaker A: So just more really cool, edgy artists on one of one. So that is super cool. Check that out. A really cool interview there. They just did NUV 1914 recently. And finally, I mean, this is like six days in this scene. Nick St.
00:37:29.534 - 00:37:47.614, Speaker A: Pierre prompting. So huge development in the AI. Prompting in a personalized AI kind of feels like interdimensional cable. The model was trained on ten jimmy neutron screen captures, prompting for these images. Taylor Swift drinking a soda. And Kanye West. Kanye west snowboarding.
00:37:47.614 - 00:38:12.902, Speaker A: So we saw a preview of this last time, the style prompt in mid journey. And it looks very, very, very powerful. Lily illo. An example of how it begins. I try to see what might be possible and process is guided from there. So you see a little bit of editing is what it looks like here, because it looks like this is taken and then edited through. And so just very cool.
00:38:12.902 - 00:38:27.990, Speaker A: So on. Finally, 38 minutes in here onto the, you know, artwork, so to speak, axin get verified by axin. And this was actually sent to me courtesy. It's strange thing. Thank you. Strange thing. And just a really.
00:38:27.990 - 00:38:53.368, Speaker A: I didn't. Hadn't even seen it come out. And it's a PDF by axin. So how cool is that? And of course, axin, for those that don't know, is, I believe AK is Turkish for three. And axin comes out of the zine scene. And so which is kind of like an underground magazine, so to speak, is what a zine is, you know, self made. And that's a whole scene.
00:38:53.368 - 00:39:21.584, Speaker A: They have their own festivals, as many of you know, and so putting out a PDF, almost like a hat tip to the whole zine scene, but a digital one. And look at that. And they're kind of like this. They're kind of like art magazines, you know, so as many of you know, look at that. So just really cool. And here's machine also in the studio. So I need to mute that for copyright reasons.
00:39:21.584 - 00:39:41.250, Speaker A: So again, there's machine here who does a lot of kind of gradient art here. And in the studio, a lot of spray paint. Spray paint art is actually what I should say. So let me just. There we go. And finally, there's actually. Okay, we're gonna get to the art in a second here.
00:39:41.250 - 00:40:01.694, Speaker A: Demon ego has a show, and walk is posting it because walk, I believe, is in the show and ponder group drop, curated by demon ego, November 10, 2023. And here it is. So another physical show. More encroachment on the physical, so called real world. Mikey de la creme. Gotta love it. Santiago manital.
00:40:01.694 - 00:40:22.594, Speaker A: So continuing on. And another super cool painting by. Is it La Delmus? Is the name of the artist here. I think it's la delmis delmus World. And here, this is a free mint. And look at how well it's doing in this beautiful actual background. You can choose your own kind of background and font here on Zora.
00:40:22.594 - 00:40:46.786, Speaker A: The creation, maybe a weird kind of reference to Adam and Eve, once upon a time. There's an eccentric community that was tired of being ignored and unseen. Okay, so something else maybe referring to this scene. 451, minted. So really nice painting here. I was kind of slow to pick up on Delma's work and they're just a really cool artist. Really nice piece I did.
00:40:46.786 - 00:41:13.256, Speaker A: I feel like we looked at a similar one last time. I don't think it was the same one. It's possible it's the same work, but I don't think so. This one feels different. So just another cool work from La Delmas if I'm pronouncing that right, myth with a work here. And let me just quickly bring it up larger so we can maximize it here. So just a really cool work here by the myth.
00:41:13.256 - 00:41:44.734, Speaker A: And I'm not sure, I don't think we've seen this one either. Here's the myth with a knife, woman on a horse and some homunculi and almost little myth guys that look like candles, looks like it's made on procreate as well. And kind of a dapper looking myth on kind of wearing the Sunday best here. Going for a stroll here with a edgy knife accompanying him. And here also the underworld. And here, this is 100 tezos. This is an edition of twelve.
00:41:44.734 - 00:42:01.366, Speaker A: And there are 100 tezos each. Wow. I think we saw a preview of this work on Twitter. And here it has finally been minted here. So super edgy work. It has. We've seen this one before because I remember I didn't want to make it big because it's a bit of a family show that we run here.
00:42:01.366 - 00:42:18.366, Speaker A: But it's a pretty rad work here by the myth, also out of Argentina, rustic digital art. She loves you. And here's the Beatles. And I don't know if anybody actually liked that Beatles song. I heard it once. I wasn't very impressed with the new Beatles song that they released. But maybe other people.
00:42:18.366 - 00:42:51.134, Speaker A: So maybe referring to this in the zeitgeist here, the spirit of the time times by rustic digital art and just some really cool kind of fuzzed out people here in a kind of concert of sorts. But it almost looks like a stadium of sports stadium and maybe they are in a stadium of sorts. So just interesting kind of irrational impressions from rustic digital art. This is one left at ten tezos edition of ten. Another super interesting. Nice painting. Super original, great color.
00:42:51.134 - 00:43:23.490, Speaker A: Corn on the Cob, digital drawing by board me Social club now BMSC edition of 17. And there is what looks like a boomerang made of corn and some kind of vampire fangs and dripping out blood and coming off. Just finishing. Remember that really cool collaboration with Tornado Rodriguez. And cool. This is quite surreal, this kind of nice brick structure in the background and even the floor there, just really nice piece. And of course, this is Gabby Walter.
00:43:23.490 - 00:43:48.902, Speaker A: New drop on ETH Underworld impressions is a new collection and how I imagine hell if it is to exist. And of course, Gabby Walter, we know from the broken Mickey Mouse kind of ear character. And interesting. It looks like it's a pastiche, perhaps. I'm not sure what the original might be. So interesting. Cool digital painting as usual in the crash test dummies, almost reaching up here, here from the inferno.
00:43:48.902 - 00:44:15.088, Speaker A: And this guy looks like is being maybe dragged up to Purgatorio here. Very interesting. And we missed. I missed this, actually, it was just October 26. Lavon minted a new painting, a genesis work on super rare. So thrilled to see Lavon on super rare and does a lot of what I'd call crypto art, you know, kind of referencing. You see the little ethereum sign down here, there it is, the Ethereum flag.
00:44:15.088 - 00:44:36.216, Speaker A: And then a big ship. And not sure. Is that Gary Gensler? Right. The triumph of the inevitable, a digital painting. And this has won auction with a bid of one and a half ETH. OsF has picked it up for one and a half ETH. So great start for Lavon on super rare.
00:44:36.216 - 00:45:10.458, Speaker A: And look at this. Rare is changing it up. The Boston dynamics dog has been changed with a new robot atlas. My latest painting is based off this one by Giovanni Francesco Barbieri. Atlas holding up the celestial gold globe of 1646, which was literally commissioned by Lorenzo de Medici, also known. So de Medici commissioned the original Giovanni Francesco Barbieri work. So just another cool pastiche here.
00:45:10.458 - 00:46:01.606, Speaker A: And, you know, one quick thing on the constellations, a weird observation being here when I, especially when I was in Taormina. So being in Sicily, when you look at the constellations, because I'd wake up at like six in the morning before the sun rose, before the time change. And when you look at the constellations from Greece or Sicily here, they start to make a lot more sense because all of a sudden they feel like, perfectly placed in the sky. And that is just kind of interesting because when I was in North America or even in the north of Europe, you don't get the same kind of perfect placement. And that's kind of one of those things that you have to go to observe something like that. So I just thought that was interesting. Cool work from rare and dancontrol with another beautiful kind of medieval style painting here, gradient painting.
00:46:01.606 - 00:46:39.668, Speaker A: And these, it just works beautifully with this kind of medieval style and this beautiful flora over here on the ground here, the plant life, and kind of has a real kind of medieval, even early Renaissance feeling and beautiful kind of gestures here in this kind of grand, beautiful narrative painting and almost making fun here. As you can see, the medieval angel here coming from the top right upside down. I love it. Great humor here. I mean, it's a bold move. Great, great humor here. So this is by dancontrol edition of 20 for 20 tezos.
00:46:39.668 - 00:47:09.476, Speaker A: Each half are gone. So, I mean, Dan control is selling these works for pretty good for an edition. So really nice work there. Wasteman Goldman edition of eleven. Paul who smoked smoke and Paul, just a nice kind of simple painting here by wasteman gold Minovic of someone smoking at a table. Kind of has like a 1950s skin kind of feel to it, doesn't it? Interesting contrast between the texture here on the left and on the right. Again, this makes me think of art matter, actually.
00:47:09.476 - 00:47:32.814, Speaker A: What would art matter do? It'd probably work really well with this painting here. Cool work. Pp. Universal. Mark's watching how you criticize capitalism from social media. So a bit of a social commentary there. And maybe a young Mark, young Karl Marx with a almost a medieval kind of haircut here and looking over this ledge.
00:47:32.814 - 00:47:57.012, Speaker A: Interesting piece, isn't it? A pretty nice piece from Peepee universal. And, you know, something to just comment on. I think peepee is changing it up because we were discussing how oftentimes, you know, you take the hair and then you fill it with patterning. I mentioned it many, many times. Well, you're starting to see more than one pattern here in this kind of outline. Same with the face. Like it is getting more complex.
00:47:57.012 - 00:48:25.564, Speaker A: Interestingly interesting background, that pitch black background as well. Rinnefish with more of this interesting kind of light, semi opaque, gradiented pixelation here on top of, I thought, a really sweet, what looks like one bug but two bugs, it's hard to tell if it's two or one. Sometimes nobody. Really nice piece here. Grimm cipher. So this is Grims. I think it's Grimm's is how you Grimoire.
00:48:25.564 - 00:48:43.044, Speaker A: And so this is on foundation at 0.11 ETH. Already one sold. And so this is a new mint here, November 3. And let's see if we can get this coming up. Showing up big again. Nice color.
00:48:43.044 - 00:49:08.678, Speaker A: I'm really digging what Grimoire is up to there. And that awesome collaboration that they did, I think it was a 0043, if I'm not mistaken. And here's another one from Grimoire. This was done on October 27. Glitches, they come, they go. I thought just kind of nice and simple here, someone in a subway. But then you got the surveillance camera, I'd argue probably a nod to crypto art in its own way.
00:49:08.678 - 00:49:30.930, Speaker A: It's kind of more crypto art ish, crypto art esque, we could say a lot of Glimwell's work with the surveillance camera, as we saw in Ripcache, there's kind of a classic crypto art trope. Heathens. Cool title. And the flashing as well. Here it is. AC 0042 was the collaborator. And between you and me, so this is collaborating with Gluemox here.
00:49:30.930 - 00:50:08.414, Speaker A: And again you can start to see Ac double zero, four twos. Kind of maybe its AI artwork because it almost looks like 19th century painting, but its got a bit of a japanese feeling. AI art. So cool collabs here by AC 0042, this time with Gloomox. And here you probably recognize this artist, Ugo 42, or Ugo is the name of the artist here. And so I thought I brought up things might be slightly, I think things are in order here, but this is ugo 42 on Zora. I thought I brought up the other page here.
00:50:08.414 - 00:50:39.370, Speaker A: We may come across it here on our travels. Really nice original flowers, aren't they? So Hugo 42, continuing to actually just push things forward, which is super cool. This is Santiago with, again, kind of incorporating AI and other maybe p five j's. The new music album is out now. And so this is November 1. So continuing this super interesting original style here. I love the negative space around the side here.
00:50:39.370 - 00:51:10.370, Speaker A: We're going to see another Santiago work. This is on object build, the Internet again by speaking to each parent. And so really love the blue in there. Another, just super interesting. I love the composition, you know, an interesting treatment of the negative space. You see how kind of busting up the margin here on the bottom left kind of rebalance gives the whole piece a whole different kind of compositional balance here, I guess, from a formal abstract interpretation. So interesting move.
00:51:10.370 - 00:51:36.374, Speaker A: And I like the blue there. Just that crisp, cool, clear, refreshing blue there. Contrasts beautifully with all these kind of warmer and darker colors. Excuse me, we're never going to be able to rerecord this show, so we're just going to go with it, everybody. And here, just a cool. Another work that kind of looked like our first work there. Super original work coming out from Santiago here.
00:51:36.374 - 00:52:00.138, Speaker A: It's rich and interesting. And again, that prolificness, as I call it here, it builds credibility. Don't forget that tweet that was put out with 100 tweets of Santiago's work. Like, Santiago is releasing several works a day, I think. I think. I mean, that's what it looks like to me. And super interesting works at that.
00:52:00.138 - 00:52:15.790, Speaker A: And they're selling 20 editions at ten taze ocs each. I mean, Santiago must be making a fortune here. I hope so. It's earned, I mean, so just beautiful work. And boo boy, going abstract today. I feel stressed and want to express something. We're already at 52 minutes.
00:52:15.790 - 00:52:36.062, Speaker A: I'm going to speed up a bit here. My first abstract expressionist. Abstract expression is live now. And so this is on foundation. So that's cool to see boo boy experiment here, and maybe could hang in the same room there with Santiago. And so cool experimentation from booboy sells for 0.3 ETH.
00:52:36.062 - 00:53:00.226, Speaker A: Well done. That's like $800 these days, maybe $650. Nice sale, boo boy. And here we have Flora Marquez, my definition of web3, and brilliantly put together. I'm pretty sure flora did zines too. A lot of people are out of zine culture here. So this is part of the neutro drop on Zora, my definition of web3.
00:53:00.226 - 00:53:42.534, Speaker A: And you see it's a gif. And it's kind of like, you know, it's a different take on comics here because there is like, for lack of better term, the narrative processes, like it precedes there is a kind of a movie quality to this, as we see the word. Let's go. I'm ready, you know, so there is a interesting take on comics, isn't it? Very interesting. And actually, let's zoom in a little bit where you can see, actually, Flora Marquez. Brilliant work here. That series that Flora did, those one of ones at the start of the year, I feel like a real, I think they really helped.
00:53:42.534 - 00:54:19.856, Speaker A: And I loved Flora's work before those beautiful stamps, but I just feel like you can see all that work when I look at these works now, like, it's the payoff and the brilliant color here, we see it a lot in the stamp series, which I highly recommend if you don't have any. They're just great works. They're some of my favorite works on object. Trippy places by Tornado Rodriguez here, my home away from home. So another work here on Zora. And for minted so far, and probably just minted here and hilarious here. So just a cool work with the sun.
00:54:19.856 - 00:54:38.192, Speaker A: Kind of out of control sun here. I've never seen a sun like that in the house. Kind of anthropomorphized and old pink computer here. And all sorts of mayhem as usual here by Tornado Rodriguez out of Argentina. Interesting little gradient over there, too. Very cool work. And look at this.
00:54:38.192 - 00:55:00.264, Speaker A: Louis Osborne, after a little hiatus, back on the scene here. We'll see what the title is in a second here, but kind of a more, you know, working with gradients, a little bit more here. And you see someone looking at a screen. Contemporary illustration, nice kind of design, like, look at that. Just doing it night and day. Almost like a commentary. We're always on our screens.
00:55:00.264 - 00:55:16.084, Speaker A: Quite brilliant, you know, Lewis Osborne's kind of cyclicing, a productive day. The irony. The irony. I love it. I love it. There were other works, all eyes off me. Lewis Osborne's this is an edition of 30.
00:55:16.084 - 00:55:42.512, Speaker A: And there were so many works. So this is almost like an eye. But then these open up as eyes. You know what this reminds me of is like argus, I think, the thousand eyed, you know, mythological creature. It's almost like an argus of sorts here, but Dun Lewis Osborne style, with the person in the middle and all of these eyes. And the person is happy when the eyes are open. And when the eyes close there, they're sad.
00:55:42.512 - 00:56:16.274, Speaker A: So just more all eyes off me, Lewis Osborne, edition of 30. And then this was super interesting too, again, referring to our attention of digital copies theme. So we have different colors on these and you see the value. I mean, it's just a simple color change here. And then you see there's four others here, but the red, I mean, it's like Warhol. The blue is a completely different work here. So isn't this interesting? The red, I mean, they're completely different works in terms of just the, you know, the feelings that they give.
00:56:16.274 - 00:56:41.794, Speaker A: So just super duper interesting work here from Louis Osborne. Edition of 25 and one at 31, selling for 30 tezos on secondary of the purple. So just super interesting here from Lewis Osborne. And selling out. Isn't that great? And one was an edition of 50 and all eyes. And so just really, really cool art here from Louis Osborne. Here's the blue one.
00:56:41.794 - 00:57:12.630, Speaker A: And here's another work. So a lot coming out in the last week from Louis Osborne. Well deserved nap kind of complements our other one productive day quite nicely. And this, maybe this family or everybody just sleeping on top of each other, exhausted. And then the cat, the dogs as well. So just really cool, well deserved nap sponter. A really cool kind of Sci-Fi what I consider like Sci-Fi but it's almost got a medieval feel too, to the illustration, just a super interesting illustrator.
00:57:12.630 - 00:57:36.836, Speaker A: Villagers love to gather around the well to gossip. However, it is not from this practice that the expression the whisper of the well was born. We can now only imagine its true origins. So here it is. So a bit of a medieval feel to it. And in these kind of cobblestone, I guess it's not cobblestone, just in this rock like chimney. And this beautiful, just beautifully illustrated kind of stone sidewalk here.
00:57:36.836 - 00:58:13.738, Speaker A: And kind of a medieval figure here. Almost like contemporary teenagers, but in a medieval context. Always with a super interesting view in terms of the perspective that the composition takes. Really dynamic compositions here from smonter nine available for five tazos and Seba Sestaro memory number seven. So playing again with this memory idea, the back of the head here as a kind of a canvas of sorts for memory. Different memories here. So just very cool work here from Seba Sestaro.
00:58:13.738 - 00:58:30.742, Speaker A: Looks like sold out. One of one for 70. Nice one to Capstone and Olin. Drowning in my thoughts. This was on tase or on x, I should say. I'm not sure if it's minted on the blockchain anywhere, but I thought it was a pretty cool work. And written in Japanese here.
00:58:30.742 - 00:58:52.674, Speaker A: Olin tv. Let's just see on super rare. So maybe this is on super rare. Just a cool piece. Maybe it's an older piece. Not sure. And Turkarak gloomy years and so kind of a rough title, interestingly, and brings us back maybe to playing with the rabbit ears, as we used to call them on the tv to try and get a good signal.
00:58:52.674 - 00:59:15.260, Speaker A: Pretty hilarious portrait of like the eighties gloomy years edition of ten for three tezos each from Turkarak and Nuv 1914. I picked up this one. A couple of addition. One of ones Nuv 1914 has been releasing some one of ones. Very edgy gradient artist. I picked this one up. A rare opportunity to pick up a one of one from NUV 1914.
00:59:15.260 - 00:59:37.524, Speaker A: It was only ten tezos. Here's another. Great. And there are others too. Here's another work by Zuoxo, as I pronounce. And this is on Zora. Very experimental, but super cool.
00:59:37.524 - 01:00:00.274, Speaker A: So I think is this a free mint? It's a free mint on Zora. So how cool is that? A huge fan of this artist. I need to buy more. Still regretting missing a one of one from Zwoxo way back, about a month ago. Sean Luke with a cool work here. This is on object November 6. So a new mint.
01:00:00.274 - 01:00:32.810, Speaker A: I thought this was a really nice piece by Sean Luke here. Kind of analog video, kind of glitchy, just really original or very Sean Luke, shall we say. And almost like these figures here, they look like figures, almost like one of those. I don't remember the word for it, but where it's like a ballerina that just kind of twists around mechanically cosmic dancers spinning chaos into beauty. And there, this is the second half that I was looking for. Ugo's work here of the roses. This is on mint.
01:00:32.810 - 01:00:58.252, Speaker A: Fun if you're looking to pick one up. And continuing on, Nicholas Sassoon pattern, a couple of more patterns here. And so these are beautiful on x. And just here is another beautiful work here. Just the neighbors. I'm trying not to be too loud here, but let's keep running through this show. We're already at the hour mark, and I think we're, like, halfway through, so I'm going to keep running.
01:00:58.252 - 01:01:20.336, Speaker A: Beautiful work from Nicholas Sassoon here. Kappen on Zora. Natura flux. So super cool work from kappen. 132 minted. I have a feeling kaplan's gonna do very well on Zora. And here, I think it's the third of this exoplanet series, x 42, log entry number three.
01:01:20.336 - 01:01:36.184, Speaker A: Very cool text. And just more cool work from KaPn. This was gorgeous. This was also released by Kapn. The border is no longer a rigid boundary, but a fluid spectrum where our lives seamlessly merge. Again. Kind of back to these naturals here.
01:01:36.184 - 01:01:53.012, Speaker A: Again, coming out of the music scene in 2019. Had been making gifts, I think, though, from 2012. Again, we have a brilliant space with Kappan. If you want to learn more. Out of Costa Rica, I love how international the scene is out of turkey. Haiti rocket here. Look at this.
01:01:53.012 - 01:02:25.942, Speaker A: Kind of an experimental piece by Haiti Rockette. You know, almost playing with line drawing and moving. I thought this was quite interesting and just kind of exciting because Haiti Rocket. I relate a lot to Haiti rocket's work because it uses a lot of sampling glitch. ROM takes a thing, manipulates, takes a, you know, Pepe manipulates it. It's really interesting to see Haiti draw, you know, so just kind of exciting there. That is an edition of three on object.
01:02:25.942 - 01:02:46.832, Speaker A: And I'm going to keep running through here. So just some more what look like drawings here? Not sure on this one. This is called spare page by Haiti Roquette. And let me just make that a regular size here. So edition of four. Interesting copying here. And then, just like some, they're turning more into digital paintings here from Haiti Rocket one is moving.
01:02:46.832 - 01:03:19.948, Speaker A: I mean, this is exciting. I mean, they're feeling like digital paintings of a different kind, shall we say? Like, real kind of painterly, I'm tempted to say. And Haiti Rocket had a great weekend, or a great week, however long it's been putting out all sorts of super interesting work here at GM as the pepe feels good. Really nice piece here. This is a 101. Did it sell? Went to Sunday Funday for only 100 tazos for a one of one. That is a wonderful, wonderful purchase there.
01:03:19.948 - 01:03:39.244, Speaker A: Haiti Rockette, edition of three again. So this is more like the sampling that I'm talking about, where you take something, you manipulate it, you copy it. So this is more traditional Haiti rocket, but more just brilliant works in the 3d glasses. Totally cool addition. Gm's good. Totally cool addition. Here's another one.
01:03:39.244 - 01:03:56.184, Speaker A: Just kind of messing around here with a bit of what looks like a deluxe four background here. Just literally hitting screen record, making some stuff. Just one of one. Why not, right? Here's another one. GM. So really just. I love the.
01:03:56.184 - 01:04:18.304, Speaker A: Let's do this. Let's mint this. Let's mint this, let's mint this. I love that mentality, because everyone is, like, in the digital world. We're so kind of overwhelmed with how many possibilities we have. We kind of decide, okay, I'll just mint this. But really, as we're working, a lot of us digital artists, we see, like, a thousand different works over the course of making an artwork.
01:04:18.304 - 01:04:31.146, Speaker A: So I love this. You know, this way of being. This way of being an artist that Haiti rocket's taken is like, no, let's do that. Let's do that. Let's do that. Everything that looks like art. Let's call it art and mint it.
01:04:31.146 - 01:04:58.784, Speaker A: I think it's brilliant. And so just super cool work here from Haiti Rockette. You don't need to make a big addition if you're doing that right. This was a special bidders edition for Sabato's work. Looks like an outtake, or maybe the first version that Sabato was working on, perhaps with the. I always forget what these are called. Cherrababas or something with the animals here that Sabato loves to portray.
01:04:58.784 - 01:05:22.949, Speaker A: So kind of like just one of these with different time zones. One of the art fair. It looks like just like one booth, so to speak, of the art fair. Again, maybe like a practice work or the first work, and then you even see, like, the person here, Felix and Anna. So this was given to the bidders of the last work. So really nice gift. There's.
01:05:22.949 - 01:05:53.814, Speaker A: And here's Ed Marolla machine dream for piano in f minor. So beautiful record cover here. And cool music. I mean, you see why this show had to be so long. I mean, there's. Am I not gonna put this one in? So beautiful work from Edmarrola machine dream. And what a title.
01:05:53.814 - 01:06:11.434, Speaker A: What a title. So something is happening over here. And a beautiful piece here, as you can see. Probably put it together pretty quickly. Who knows? It's beautiful, though. A beautiful landscape. And like, very Edmorola, isn't it? Manital, king of cups as the cat tarot continues.
01:06:11.434 - 01:06:27.154, Speaker A: So another beautiful piece here. The king of cups by Manadal. Tarot card of the minor Arcan Arcana. 14th card of 14 cards. So we'll see where it goes next. Probably another suit, so to speak. Look at this.
01:06:27.154 - 01:06:55.090, Speaker A: This is Nami Pachynet. And so another piece here, kind of combining different cultures. Looks like, you know, east, what we used to call east indian, like indian art. Just beautiful pixel art here. Kind of almost looks like. I'm not sure. Would you call it arab art? Exactly.
01:06:55.090 - 01:07:23.722, Speaker A: 1001 nights, right? Moonlight Enchanter. I really enjoyed the last week getting in touch with Gulati and hearing his point of view of my art and finally working on his ideas as an artwork. This piece has just opened up a new phase of work in my mind. We'll be making more of the 1001 nights. Maybe this is just a scene from 1001 nights. Like, how cool would that be sold? I'm not sure what it went for, but pretty interested to find out, gogolitis actually posted this artist never seen before. Timpix.
01:07:23.722 - 01:07:47.512, Speaker A: Timpx. And this is on Solana. And all those artists that have been minting on Solana, collecting their saul, have done really well with that massive move in the token in the last couple of weeks here. So a couple of interesting pieces here. Interesting original works here. Again, you could totally screen print these. Ghost town by Timpix new artist.
01:07:47.512 - 01:08:04.564, Speaker A: And of course, this is mech TXT with these beautiful, beautiful landscapes here. Very reminiscent, actually, of what we're seeing, what I see here. And I follow mech TXt. That is a glitch in Twitter. Quiet agrarian life. And here is another one. How I wish you were here.
01:08:04.564 - 01:08:18.712, Speaker A: So. And a little love story here in the. Again, what feel like Ultima. Four works into the belly of the dragon for you, my love. So just beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. End of work. Minted here.
01:08:18.712 - 01:08:33.539, Speaker A: I mean, this is all again in the last six days here. Consciousness arose. Star stuffs, contemplating stars, edition of 25. Again, look at how much money is being spent here, just all over the place. Like, this stuff's all selling out. A lot of it. A lot of it's being minted.
01:08:33.539 - 01:08:59.722, Speaker A: Like, it's a very healthy market here, isn't it? Which makes you wonder, you know, the next bull run, whether it's six months, six years from now. It could be wild if it, like, it's healthy as it is. And look at this. This is also a PDF. I don't know if there's something going on. Remember, Aksim did the PDF. Now, Mac has created a font called Monomac, and here it is.
01:08:59.722 - 01:09:28.341, Speaker A: So, of course, mech TXT, his background in graphic design is making fonts as one of the specialties, as far as I understand. So making a new font. I mean, the dexterity of all these artists is, you know, just constant creation here. Type specimen monomec V 1.0. So some examples here. Very professional, right? From mech TXT. This is awesome.
01:09:28.341 - 01:10:24.530, Speaker A: So here you see cosmic speed. And if I'm not mistaken, that's Diego Maradona with the number ten there and the goal of the century. And I brought it up big here. This is on Zora free mint. And I brought it up big here so that we could see this glorious. I watched this on tv, like, live, you know, when it was happening, was it England that Argentina was playing? If I have this right, I mean, this is after Diego Maradonas, as far as I understand. I'm pretty sure I have this right, because I remember, who hasn't watched this? Who knows soccer, the goal of the century, you know, this is after Diego Maradona faked, you know, basically punched in the ball, faked heading it in, and then the refs didn't see it, and then it was seen as like, is this legitimate? And then proceeded in the next, like, five minutes, if I'm not mistaken, to take out the entire english team and then score.
01:10:24.530 - 01:10:42.010, Speaker A: And then it's like, well, even if it was a scam, the first goal, look at what he just did. Okay. You know, deserve to win the goal of the century. Brilliant subject matter. I wish I could. I knew the artist there. I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to bring up.
01:10:42.010 - 01:11:05.276, Speaker A: I think it was just an anonymous account. But if you give me a tweet, if you see this, whoever made that, because I think this happened last time, send me a tweet, I'll retweet it to make sure, at least just help spread the word on that. Brilliant work. Look, for the goal of the century on Zora. Okay. To find that artist, Francoise Gammer. New cool.
01:11:05.276 - 01:11:24.090, Speaker A: Actually, I'm not sure if it's new work, but newly minted. It's from the 2009 series. So just a cool piece here from Francois Gamma. And another cool piece here posted on Instagram. This is gonna be the longest show probably ever that I've ever done. And I don't. I'm trying to make them shorter, but there's just too much going on here.
01:11:24.090 - 01:11:39.174, Speaker A: Guandanarian with another piece. Remember the last one got like half a million views? Well, this one did too, so why not? Let's make a red one. Brilliant. So simple. Of course I made another one. Gotta love the humor too. And then look at this.
01:11:39.174 - 01:11:52.566, Speaker A: Someone put it on some kind of device. I'm not even sure what this is. I screamed. I had to. So just. So, just super cool here. And also another one.
01:11:52.566 - 01:12:05.514, Speaker A: Let's do the rainbow version. 152,000 and I think posted yesterday. So still, I mean, it's insane. 1000, you know, retweets here. You just gotta love it. 6.7 thousand likes.
01:12:05.514 - 01:12:36.834, Speaker A: So there's something to be said here about kind of tapping into what works on a crowd level. You know, how we were talking about like, working within the con, the limits or the confines of a certain medium. You know, rip cash was mentioning it with on chain. You could argue, you know, trying to get as many views as possible, but make an interesting, nice work is another kind of confine. It's like, okay, you know, Sabato has kind of made light of this. It's flashing. It's flashing, right? And even Guandanarian was mentioning this.
01:12:36.834 - 01:12:57.570, Speaker A: I brought out the tweet last week. It's like, I don't know how I feel. Gundanarian was saying about this work that I spent like 2 seconds on doing way better than this work. I spent like a month on. Maybe not 2 seconds, but, you know, not as much time on. So there's something to be said for that, right? And just see how far you can go in terms of views. It's just kind of interesting.
01:12:57.570 - 01:13:24.342, Speaker A: It's kind of a different limit. One could argue muji with another interesting, kind of different flavored work here. Similar colors to what we've been seeing from yuji and similar kind of cool glitchiness, but kind of almost like a medieval. Almost like a darker. It feels like blood or, you know, kind of a goblet here, but with ribs on it. Kind of a darker feel to this one. Maybe a bit of a Halloween work.
01:13:24.342 - 01:13:36.324, Speaker A: Enigmatic heaven offering. Minted November 4. An addition of 20. There are seven left at 13 tezos. And here green ginger. This very poetic escalator. Last upward path.
01:13:36.324 - 01:13:53.574, Speaker A: When was this minted? November 5. So it's almost like an extension of Halloween a little bit here and you see some blood here. Very kind of poetic work. I find escalators very poetic. Broken escalators. When I was 20, I was kind of big on brood. Broken escalators.
01:13:53.574 - 01:14:11.802, Speaker A: Yes. Star os demo. So this is by Zoxo. So more kind of using what looks like Mario Brothers iconography, but then making new works out of it. Here's a bit of a loading screen, maybe combining different kind of video games here. Not sure. Demo.
01:14:11.802 - 01:14:35.334, Speaker A: Star os demo. This is an open mint. And you got to be careful with the open mints because sometimes they're very low editions. So three Tezos, Pamelo Cerrone, Pam Lock and Pamelo Cerrone is going to be on Twitter spaces excitingly in the next two or three weeks as well. So another super cool, very prolific artist. This is a one of one for 100 tazos. Check out the object page.
01:14:35.334 - 01:15:00.740, Speaker A: Has other one of ones available. So prolific. Vueila vuela Times Pamelo. And I was going to show Pamelo visiting Bosque, but this show is just too long. Maybe next episode. But all to say, just really awesome artist kind of reminds me of the futurists in its just kind of funness in the posters. It reminds me of those futurist posters in cuentro artistico.
01:15:00.740 - 01:15:23.324, Speaker A: And this is like to me a portrait. This is a collaboration with Velippa Lucas 3000. But to me this just is almost a portrait of what Pamela is up to to a certain degree. Just this dancing around and having fun. Of course, this is a collaboration here. Edition of ten for 420. Another collaboration here, Vuelipa Lucas and Pamelo Cerrone.
01:15:23.324 - 01:15:55.590, Speaker A: So here is another one. This one's static, I believe, Mika Oladev, as we start to wrap up here, going into a little bit of glitch here. Just a nice, very nice glitch piece by Mika Oladev doing just a classic, almost taking stock photography and just kind of reshaping it. And here is Salowaki. And here, this is on Zora. The world never stops spinning, but what's important is that you're still here. So a poetic work here from Sulawaki.
01:15:55.590 - 01:16:07.126, Speaker A: And this is on secondary now. 164 minted. Beautiful message here. And of course the humor that we associate with Sulawaki's work. Very cool. DJ Kuro. Momentary lapse.
01:16:07.126 - 01:16:32.732, Speaker A: This is a collaboration with Ranix Deer. So they're still releasing more collaborations here. A nice kind of minimal one. Minimal, interesting collaboration here using Rannick Steer's kind of abstracts and Kiro's video analog glitch kind of styling here. Here's leprochant. And this is 33 seconds. Not sure we can show it all, but we can try.
01:16:32.732 - 01:16:48.528, Speaker A: See if there's volume. There's no volume. So this is also just kind of an interesting piece put out by leprochant here. Some programming on top, kind of edgy video. So interesting work here. This, I'm not sure where it was minted. It's on object.
01:16:48.528 - 01:17:07.016, Speaker A: Bernard's journey is the name of the piece here. And that is the piece. Very cool. Continuing on, Bosca Grazias. And I thought this was interesting. Migration, energy wheels, zero, zero, seven. And you see here, it looks like there's some weaving on top or something.
01:17:07.016 - 01:17:27.394, Speaker A: Photo paper and embroidery with energy. And liquin and Pearl thread, 1963 and 1923. So interesting embroidery work here from Bosque grazias. The physical on this is probably pretty cool. This was just kind of worked into the show here. Sort of sneaking this in. Richard Prince.
01:17:27.394 - 01:18:10.494, Speaker A: If you're in Berlin when I go back, I'm going to go check out this show. I love Richard Prince's, especially the last ten years. Richard Prince's work is just for me. The late work of artists is often some of their best, and it doesn't always get the attention. So this is an upcoming solo exhibition by Richard Prinze at Max Hetzler in Berlin. Body opens on Friday, so it just opened last Friday. So repurposing images while placing a renewed emphasis on the importance of the corporeal in his oeuvre in these compositions, splinters and reassembles photographic fragments of the female figure with varying degrees of legibility.
01:18:10.494 - 01:18:38.990, Speaker A: So just interesting. Can't wait to see those in person. Interesting experimentation from Louis here. A m three chip on the left, and a house in which I grew up in Tokyo in the 19th. I thought this was just kind of edgy experimentation from Louie and then minting it, you know, interestingly, addition of six, five left, three tezos. And as we go into AI here, here's strange thing, made in AI. So some cool masks here.
01:18:38.990 - 01:19:07.668, Speaker A: Cool black and gold palette here as well. This is on Instagram. Classicism, armor inspired headwear. And here's another one by strange thing, AI with eye e collection contact lenses inspired by the Renaissance period. So the creativity continues here with strange thing, as you can see. And look at this, this is by Danielle King when an unexpected output takes your breath away. I agree.
01:19:07.668 - 01:19:29.196, Speaker A: I was tempted to start with this, working on abstract AI collages, but got this beautiful still life and I am here for it. This is a stunner. It's beautiful. And again, you'd like to see the art matter robots go to work on this one. Brought it up big here. So you know the promise of AI. Continuing on Skarmra with a couple of AI.
01:19:29.196 - 01:20:04.924, Speaker A: Continuing the women at the computer sort of series here with some of these kind of screenshots of what look like the desktop or something, or Photoshop. And beautiful colors here by Skomra. So big shout out to Skomra. And another one here, kind of turn AI illustration with these AI keyboards. Again, that last transformation, transformation layer is a nice touch. And also keeping all these other kind of desktop elements is a really nice touch. This is by Pixel Lord, I think.
01:20:04.924 - 01:20:31.786, Speaker A: I thought this was a pretty nice, what looks like an AI artwork here, I thought just kind of interesting and nice and kind of fresh. And here, of course, Lily Illo GM so, I mean, just a stunning amount of work is coming out. That's work that's provocative, that makes you want to think. And that's just kind of beautiful and interesting. You see it in the sleeve here. We're drowning in good art over here. I would argue we're very lucky.
01:20:31.786 - 01:20:52.494, Speaker A: Toques memories and moments yet to be. Like, all this stuff isn't even being minted. I mean, this is why, again, it's like this Niagara of imagination. Maybe that's where I'm broadcasting from. The Niagara of the imagination. Memories and moments yet to be. This is what happens when you go into the hour and 20 minutes mark.
01:20:52.494 - 01:21:07.586, Speaker A: This is a different kind of format here. Sweet dreams. So more beautiful work by tewks here. Stunning. And here, music storm. If you've made it this far, I mean, good for you. And look at how, I mean, the works.
01:21:07.586 - 01:21:30.262, Speaker A: Again, we're drowning in like really amazing art here. Beautiful kind of modern feeling with a capital m. White solitude with another painterly AI artwork. Just provocatively beautiful feeling. Blue in yellow room. Art by white solitude in collaboration with AI. And this is a massive edition of 665 at two tezos each.
01:21:30.262 - 01:21:48.130, Speaker A: Into the physical world we go. And there's a lot of fantastic physical artwork. If I can just kill that. There we go. Look at the negative space by Bobike Matilla. If I'm pronouncing that right, acrylic and charcoal on unprimed canvas. I mean, I love the negative space on these works here.
01:21:48.130 - 01:22:04.554, Speaker A: We have some other ones. Same artist. The revenge of the floating head. And there's, like, he man, and then castle, like, just very interesting. Beautiful painting here. Here's another one. Cyber turtle acrylic and marker on canvas.
01:22:04.554 - 01:22:21.154, Speaker A: And marker. And just a really interesting work here. And another by the same artist, whippets. So just a great discovery here. Seems super prolific. One to watch. Wooden cyclops, dogstab equal bear hug.
01:22:21.154 - 01:22:40.028, Speaker A: Another, just super interesting artist. I mean, it's. Something's happening out there. Katie Kinsman, artist. Look at this piece. So just like, here are some of the others, just discovering artists left and right here. Michael Pibles.
01:22:40.028 - 01:22:51.304, Speaker A: Michael Pybus Pebus. We've been looking at. And here's just another cool work. Acrylic in gesso on canvas. This is from Jack, 2016. Maybe that was made in 2016. Not sure.
01:22:51.304 - 01:23:08.028, Speaker A: Michael Pybus 2023 Halloween mask paintings. Just simple and easy and beautiful. I mean, look at that. I mean, look at that. I could have started with that. Like, that was just awesome. It's just like.
01:23:08.028 - 01:23:25.300, Speaker A: And they're probably big. 60 by 60 cm, you know, I'd love to see these, like a meter and a half by a meter and. Or like a meter by a meter is what I'd love to see here. Just really cool work. And nugget brain, some more. Just contemporary works here. Look at the space shuttle.
01:23:25.300 - 01:23:39.628, Speaker A: Like, who wouldn't want to own that? Escalators back to that. It's so exciting. And of course, this is by gloom tube. We all recognize who this is. You could have started with this too. A gloom tube. Physical work here, guys.
01:23:39.628 - 01:24:01.350, Speaker A: If you ever feel bad about how you're able or unable to render people's faces in your artwork, just look at what I have done. Every time I look at it, I laugh. And that's pretty cool. I actually think it did a pretty good job, like, because put it this way, gloom. I recognized it instantly as, like, maybe it's the, you know, the posture. Beautifully painted in here as well, I might add. And the isolationist.
01:24:01.350 - 01:24:17.018, Speaker A: I think this is a physical too. So interesting kind of dark work here by isolationist. Black and white and red. A violent silence, like, the perfect title there. Edition of 15. And there's one on secondary at 300 tezos. And finally, Bemiso.
01:24:17.018 - 01:24:34.254, Speaker A: Only two days left to see my show at NBB gallery. Connecting people. So another interesting artwork here. Looks like spray paint again and outlines. Bit of a trend there. Nick Dalen. My piece is in consensual ennui exhibit at the landing gallery, curated by private figure.
01:24:34.254 - 01:24:54.248, Speaker A: So just more interesting works. Here's another one. Just an interesting artist here. Look at that. So it's like we're drowning in art here. And Schwarzer. Stefan, I brought this up for Evelyn, who was saying they couldn't find Steffen Schwarzer online.
01:24:54.248 - 01:25:10.546, Speaker A: This is how you find it. Schwarz if you made it this far. Evelyn here you go. Schwarzer Stephan so just a really great, another kind of almost rauschenbergian piece here. Just, I mean, we're drowning in great art here. And that, my friends, is your episode. Thank you for joining me.
