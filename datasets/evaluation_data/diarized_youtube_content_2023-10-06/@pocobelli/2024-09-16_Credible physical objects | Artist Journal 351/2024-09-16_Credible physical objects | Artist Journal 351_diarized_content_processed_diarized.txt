00:00:02.960 - 00:00:15.737, Speaker A: All right, let's do this. It's going to be fast, as fast as I can make it. I am here in Crete. Noise is okay. I can't be too loud though. So here we're just. And we got to run through it.
00:00:15.737 - 00:00:38.961, Speaker A: We have like 150 tabs. It's going to be great. Welcome back. Artist Journal, September 16, 2024, broadcasting from Stelita outside Heracleon in Crete, Greece, the island of Crete, Minoan civilization. I'm going to try and go to a palace tomorrow. The ruin of a palace. Trying to remember the name.
00:00:38.961 - 00:01:03.645, Speaker A: And then of course, you have to go to Knossos, where there is the great palace there. So lots to see here. Before I go here till Friday, a bit of a catch up show. I wanted to experiment. I wanted to publish, as I was saying last episode last week. And it was just impossible. If you think I have to be quiet here in Anafi, which is beautiful.
00:01:03.645 - 00:01:26.795, Speaker A: Basically there's no sound insulation. So during. And everybody kind of stays at home during the day. So it would basically be listening, listening to this program without the visuals and not asking to listen to the program. So I never recorded last week, unfortunately. I hope on Wednesday, though, to finally. And for Friday, I leave on a plane back.
00:01:26.795 - 00:02:21.683, Speaker A: But Wednesday, let's try and do a show that is shorter and just kind of fast and experimental and let's see what happens. So in the spirit of keeping things snappy here, Lily Illo, of course, we've been following Lily Illo for, gosh, quite a while, I guess after the. Once I started paying attention to AI, I guess, which was September when Strange Thing put out Thug Lord. Then I started paying attention to AI and I realized it was a whole kind of genre that I could put in the show. And Lily Illo out of Australia was one of the really early artists, I think, that I started to show here. So it's been an interesting journey, I'd say, going on two years, as we're in September now of 2024. And what a journey it has been.
00:02:21.683 - 00:02:55.005, Speaker A: Because of course, this is a physical, I believe, or at least this is the digital that was put onto a physical. And we'll see photos and video of the physical rendition. But this is part of a physical show. I think it's a digital file in a physical show. And we can discuss that, what that all means again, to refresh from the perspective that I'm at here in. At this point in the show. It's every art.
00:02:55.005 - 00:03:27.995, Speaker A: The digital work is a separate art piece from the physical rendition. Because, of course, when you make the physical rendition, it creates a new piece. The physicality changes your experience of the piece. It is a different experience. It is maybe the same source image, but it is a different iteration, a different product, so to speak. A kind of remix, one could argue. So here is, I believe, the digital that was rendered, and I think maybe we even have the physical version of this one.
00:03:27.995 - 00:04:02.703, Speaker A: But I do want to just pay attention first to the AI work as a digital work of art, because you really see the majestic kind of. The majesty is actually the word I'm looking for in the eyes here. Again, playing with what I like to call AI distortions. You see in the eyes here and everything. So. And then, of course, you almost have this Klimt, like, you know, clothing here and here. Again, the AI distortions getting multiple fingers.
00:04:02.703 - 00:04:33.705, Speaker A: Lily Illo, we had on a space not too long ago, and she was discussing and explaining very generously how she likes to use early versions. Very specific early versions of Mid Journey as well. I think it was midjourney, maybe also Stable Diffusion. She uses a lot, but I think it was Mid Journey. Go back to the show. We did a space. It's the X timeline, and I have been accumulating all the spaces to upload to Spotify.
00:04:33.705 - 00:05:15.539, Speaker A: I may do a separate channel on YouTube just for the podcast, because I need to upload all at once and it's going to script the video feed. So just lots of thoughts. If anybody has advice on that, feel free to message me. So all to say, the AI distortions kind of a what I'd call a defining characteristic of early AI art, interestingly, and of course, recognized by the artists and so embraced and even avoiding the newer versions in order to capture this kind of wonderful distortion, so to speak. So quite beautiful. And of course, we see the background pattern there too. Yeah.
00:05:15.539 - 00:05:50.843, Speaker A: AI art, pretty interesting. So this is on foundation digital artwork by Australian artist Lily Illo in collaboration with AI300DPI A2,400. So I'm not sure and it'll be interesting to find out, I assume, if you buy this. I don't know if they're separate artworks, if they're being sold as separate artworks, or if you buy one, you get the other. Because it looks like it is. If you buy this, maybe you get the. Because here we have the physical.
00:05:50.843 - 00:06:04.155, Speaker A: The 300 dots per inch. 420 millimeters by 5. This is more of a physical description here. So not exactly sure. Rather than pixels, for example. So not exactly sure how it's being sold. 0.4
00:06:04.155 - 00:06:21.939, Speaker A: eth here. Fiona. Interesting. Maybe one person. Pretty interesting Portraits from the Memory palace is the series here. Of course there is Fiona. And let's see, so sold here and here.
00:06:21.939 - 00:06:45.065, Speaker A: So now I thought a few had sold, so I'm not exactly sure how it works, the selling of it, but quite beautiful. As you can see this series here. And let me just open it up large here. So again, even a little bit of depth of field there perhaps. And just kind of interesting. Right again. AI.
00:06:45.065 - 00:07:23.375, Speaker A: So pretty cool show again. And Michele Colonna, of course, opening that gallery in the last two years. I remember at least I'm pretty sure I remember when that actually started. And so maybe a year and a half ago, if I had to hazard a guess, has been doing quite well from my understanding. And so here's Mikey de la Creme, who lives nearby, had a blast tonight at Kelowna Contemporary for this incredible Lily Illo show. Picked up a limited edition print and got to meet trippy collector in person. And so here it is.
00:07:23.375 - 00:07:42.809, Speaker A: And interestingly small, I would actually say. And you know, smaller is easier to sell. Interestingly so there's nothing even really small. We've discussed this before. Can be really cool. And again, it's a very people sometimes it's a lot easier. It's good to have many sizes.
00:07:42.809 - 00:08:16.247, Speaker A: It's a reminder that it's good to have many sizes when you're making art. And you know, even the small ones can be just as charming. And you can still make a huge Passepartout or matte as they might say in America around it, which is kind of typical. You see it like you'll see a small Warhol, massive frame and the Passepartout or matte, you know, filling in the void. Also MC Escher, I saw the same thing. So there is a way of making very small works kind of impressive looking on your wall. Here is another photo.
00:08:16.247 - 00:08:57.875, Speaker A: So now you can see the physical. And this was done and we have a write up by actually trippy, trippy collector here. But you can see the reflection. I think it's birchwood is the material that's printed on and you see how it changes the artwork. In a sense, it solves for texture. One could argue this is solved for the texture problem because of course, if you put this on inkjet and then just print it on flat paper that has no texture, let's say that's really thin, it's kind of not that exciting. But if you're able and who knows how they actually printed on birchwood.
00:08:57.875 - 00:09:44.669, Speaker A: If you're able to do that. Look at that. I mean, it's starting to look like an oil painting, but it's not pretty sophisticated is how I would, you know, describe this. This is pretty sophisticated. Probably a great buy. You know, if I'm a museum, you know, person acquirer, you know, in charge of acquisitions, I'd be like, well, you know, maybe we should get one of these. So Trippy Collector A trip report from trippy collector who went to the show Memory Palace Graciously, graciously put on by Kelowna Contemporary in Philadelphia, just outside of just outside of Philly, Pennsylvania, just outside of Philadelphia.
00:09:44.669 - 00:10:22.741, Speaker A: First off, the works were AI generated using a lily trained model. They were sent off and printed on Birchwood in Australia. Numerous companies were tested and the work put into finding the perfect printing company for such a unique concept really pays off. The physical works simply were stunning. The color saturation just simply cannot be done justice. Using a typical iPhone picture makes you curious. The texture that the wood panel provides adds a richness that sets it apart from other physical works I've seen in recent memory.
00:10:22.741 - 00:10:44.901, Speaker A: I was legit tempted to collect a second piece. They are just that special when you see them in person. Getting to finally meet legendary Michele Colonna and Mikey Wilson was another major highlight. Talk about high expectations for both of them. And they completely exceeded expectations. So kind, so fun, so thoughtful. Couldn't ask for better company for an event of this type than these two.
00:10:44.901 - 00:11:13.045, Speaker A: Just getting to hang out with them was worth the red eye flight. Final thought met a lot of non web 3 native folk and they all seem genuinely curious and excited about the uniqueness of the pieces. They do look unique and the execution of the works we were seeing. There are still too many barriers to enter explain to one couple. The process of setting up a wallet and an account on Coinbase and an account on Object felt like a pretty big ask. As if I was explaining it. As I was explaining it.
00:11:13.045 - 00:11:53.207, Speaker A: Display options were also a great solution for yet display options were also an always asked solution from these folks, interestingly. And we still don't really have a great solution for that yet either. Although the Whitewall app I think is a big step in the right direction. But ultimately I think these barriers will be solved over time. As they do that this space delivers on a day in, day out basis will shine through more optimistic and convicted than ever. This is a wild spot in time and we're so lucky to be here. So here is Trippy Collector with the pieces and there is a richness that you see here and maybe that's the piece that Trippie bought.
00:11:53.207 - 00:12:20.401, Speaker A: As we try and get rid of the grok, you see the little red dot there, of course, marking the sale. Beautiful size again, and must have just been incredibly rich. And look at this. So what I love about it is it's kind of like oil painting, but it's not oil painting at all. It is completely different. So this is kind of interesting. And you can see there getting the reflection and here the paint drops.
00:12:20.401 - 00:12:57.571, Speaker A: So it's kind of an interesting variation also on the art matter situation, because, remember, it was another way we were trying to get AI artworks to be turned into kind of phys. A credible physical objects, we might say. And that was being done by, you know, sculpting, putting a sculpture of paint texture underneath, simulating paint texture, and then creating a sculpture, basically, and then inkjet over top. This feels a little bit more. What's the word? Efficient. Like, it feels a little bit more refined. It.
00:12:57.571 - 00:13:17.657, Speaker A: There are less steps. It's more kind of compact. It's more perhaps resolved is the word I'm looking for, I would argue, because it's no longer simply trying to emulate another medium. This is no longer trying to emulate another medium. This is inkjet on wood. Right. This is just a.
00:13:17.657 - 00:13:41.239, Speaker A: You might call a novel solution for creating an. Or. For producing or creating a physical artwork of an AI digital file, a digital art piece made with AI. Okay, so. So interesting here now. Okay. And I think we have.
00:13:41.239 - 00:14:12.185, Speaker A: Do we have any more? And here's another. Here's a video, actually. The saturation is pretty stunning. Reminiscent of oil painting here, but a pretty interesting. Pretty interesting. Kind of want to see one. And again, the more sophisticated all this stuff becomes, the harder it is for it to be ignored, I would argue.
00:14:12.185 - 00:14:34.905, Speaker A: Like. So here's Kelowna Contemporary. This is Kate, a different piece. A lot of nice documentation, actually, of the show. I think Lily had to stay in Australia, of course, it's a massive flight from Australia to Pennsylvania. But you see how stunning these works are. And again, you have to love the size.
00:14:34.905 - 00:14:53.135, Speaker A: Very practical. Here I am in an Airbnb and I'm going, what would you know this. You couldn't put it on the wall here because someone would probably take it. It's probably what would happen. A friend of mine had art in a hotel. One of them. Yeah, One of the pieces was taken interestingly, so just stunning.
00:14:53.135 - 00:15:13.947, Speaker A: Over here, here's another. You see the display. So a very professional job there. There's the artist statement, artist bio. Not too long which is nice looks. Look at how the color is just done with such care and passion. Reminds you of RGB Montreal in that respect.
00:15:13.947 - 00:15:47.583, Speaker A: And here, even a digital representation of the gallery for so Kelowna Contemporary. For all Lily Illo aficionados who can't join us on Friday, we've recreated the show in our virtual gallery for your enjoyment. Love to hear everyone's thoughts on the show. So pretty amazing. And I think I saw at least three or four of these sold, so that is pretty impressive. Again, it's not like. It's not like a ton of art is, you know, it's not an easy business.
00:15:47.583 - 00:16:18.095, Speaker A: Let's put it this way, selling art. So that's pretty good. So again, this is a new gallery doing new edgy artworks to sell three or four at nice prices seemingly is, you have to call a success. Here is another look here at the show. So beautiful. It makes you wonder how large you could make these too. Interestingly so very interesting.
00:16:18.095 - 00:16:41.591, Speaker A: And could you make. How many could you make? Could you make a larger version of this work? I don't know. I don't know. That's where I start to get confused with the different iterations. Because if you start making, oh, I'll just make this a centimeter smaller, like there are limits to this idea of, well, it's just a different iteration. As I'm saying here. So kind of opens other questions here.
00:16:41.591 - 00:17:09.499, Speaker A: Here is the main kind of ad here, you might say, or the main poster advertised. So it just looks awesome. Even the color of the font there, nicely chosen. And here just another work. And this is the digital, very painterly, so beautiful work from Lily Illo and Michele Colonna. And big shout out to Mikey Wilson and Trippie Collector who did awesome, awesome documentation there of what happened. And big thank you to everybody who picked this up.
00:17:09.499 - 00:17:35.395, Speaker A: While I was in Anafi. There I managed to resolve the piece she ruled in 1980s Hollywood. Big Shout out and thank you to all of the collectors here who picked this work up on Object on Tezos. And also big shout out to unknown collector for picking up this kind of hidden piece here on Solana. And so big shout out, thank you. Love the colors in this piece. So glad you have it.
00:17:35.395 - 00:18:22.841, Speaker A: Unknown UC and big shout out and thank you. And also, if you want to get bullish on Tezos or just the art scene out here in general, check out the space I did with a hack. You'll kind of walk away from it feeling like the best money you'll ever spend is in Tezos art. And not Financial advice and it hasn't been so far. But when you hear this conversation, you might still feel like it may deliver at some point. Awesome space and a massive space with the myth coming up on Wednesday, which I'll probably do from this Airbnb here near Stelita, near the beach in Stelita. And we're gonna have the myth out of Argentina.
00:18:22.841 - 00:18:47.563, Speaker A: Santiago is going to do the translation. You couldn't really ask. You know, sometimes, you know, when I started some sometimes referred to as the King of Tezos, the myth. If you don't know his work, he often uses lemons or the lemon head. And there is the myth and these masks. This is just a piece that was just created. I think recently he's been putting out work on super rare.
00:18:47.563 - 00:19:22.855, Speaker A: Go to those early myth works on Tezos and they're made with Microsoft paint and you will see a very unique poetic talent and it continues. So as you see here, like again, it's almost like I was mentioned called that other show like oil paintings made of pixels. Like it's got that poetry and silence significance that you often find in old oil paintings. I'd argue you see in the myths work. So check that out. That's this Wednesday. Could be a really cool show.
00:19:22.855 - 00:19:40.181, Speaker A: Comments on last episode Rada Always rad to hear from Rada. Epic show. Time to collect until next Monday, sir. Awesome. Yeah, again, I would have loved to have recorded. I even had the time. I did not have the space in Anafi, but now we kind of have a little bit of both here.
00:19:40.181 - 00:20:05.941, Speaker A: A little bit. Anyways, awesome to hear from you, Rada and Eightso. Super happy to see you're enjoying the CRT displays from RGB Montreal. You're right, these TVs are in fact from my studio. The big benefit to artists setting up a show to display other artists is that we're more interested in making sure the art is displayed properly than we are about sales or hype. And it totally showed. You even see it in the Michele and the Colonna Contemporary Gallery show.
00:20:05.941 - 00:20:42.705, Speaker A: The care that has been put into this. It meant we did everything to ensure the pieces were displayed in a way that artists would appreciate, both on the CRT televisions or projected on the wall. We also made sure that every piece had an artist's name with a QR code next to it so that visitors who were unaware of an artist could learn more. And taking a lot of documentation was very important, as many artists couldn't make it to the space. We're also all sick of getting a blurry cell phone photo as our only documentation for a show. So we wanted to do better. I think these things should be standard for all shows and there have certainly been some web3 oriented shows that could take a lesson from this.
00:20:42.705 - 00:21:01.199, Speaker A: So Eitzel, of course, one of the three who put on that show and they did an outstanding job. So really cool to hear from you. And it shows that artists were, you know, there was the care being put into it. It really showed. Absurd deity. Fantastic show as always. Thank you 100%.
00:21:01.199 - 00:21:53.435, Speaker A: Agree with the statement that regardless of whether our collections moon or go to zero, there is intrinsic value to our collections beyond fungibility. Another great thing about collecting specifically on the Tezos blockchain is the ability for anyone, no matter the budget, to make a real and positive, positive impact on the lives of artists throughout the world. And it's actually a very good point. Like you can actually build a. If you're pretty, if you have the time and the attention and you're willing to kind of study the scene, so to speak, you can still get an amazing collection for very cheap. You know, if you're fast on Uri J or Kapn or whomever, Sabato, you name it, Lily Illo, you know, Lorna Mills, you will be able to still get a collection together for not too much money. I just don't feel that to be the case on the Ethereum blockchain, at least not on L1.
00:21:53.435 - 00:22:12.467, Speaker A: Yeah, it's interesting. Like, I see a bit of movement on L1 because it was so cheap. And then we saw Santiago sell a couple of works. We've seen Mith Mint, some works. I. I'm still waiting for a bit of a comeback, but maybe with a bit of a different spin on say, super rare. I collect art because it gives me joy.
00:22:12.467 - 00:22:52.335, Speaker A: If my collecting, collecting can also spread to the artist struggling to make ends meet. It's hard not to blow past whatever limited budget I may have set for collecting art. And really, and even just from a purely pragmatic point of view, it's not a terrible investment. You know, again, if you're spending, you know, seven, four dollars on a work by Cap and a beautiful pixel art work that's limited to like 13, I think it went for 666. So like $4, $3.81. That's what's so beautiful about this, I would argue, is the artist gets money. You don't spend too much money as a collector.
00:22:52.335 - 00:23:20.969, Speaker A: Everybody's happy and having fun. And so it's kind of beautiful. It's kind of beautiful. It's reminds me of what we were saying with Ahak, the discussion that all three of us were having. Runtune, Ahak and myself in the space where it's like again, we're not in any rush for institutions to come in here and blow this thing up. Interestingly, as I was saying, that's how high our conviction is. Interestingly misplaced or not.
00:23:20.969 - 00:23:43.245, Speaker A: And it could totally could be misplaced. Sol Sierra, Great to hear from you. Worked at a hackathon there in Argentina with Saul. Great to hear from you. And Rata Yankee first again, indeed. In many ways my friend has dribblewaffle on X here and thank you all for the massive support here. 10,000 views on X is fantastic, especially during election season.
00:23:43.245 - 00:23:57.575, Speaker A: Fantastic. Hastrubal Waffle Thanks Poco. Have a wonderful trip. And wishing you a belated Happy New Year too. Indeed. The media New Year as I love to call it. Kiskalowski I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
00:23:57.575 - 00:24:12.295, Speaker A: I got confused with all of the different ways of pronouncing it. Kiskalowski thank you for the comment. Rural Idol Thought provoking indeed. Resocial Proof. Glad to hear. Yeah, that was an interesting discussion we were having there. I've been thinking about this a lot in regard to the Zoras and the rodeos.
00:24:12.295 - 00:24:29.961, Speaker A: When Freemans equals likes, sales act as a little more as little more than social proof. It can feel as if no one collects until anyone collects and then everyone collects. Yes, indeed. Do we have all? Yes. That is the entire comment there. Aura Nice selection. Thank you GM to you.
00:24:29.961 - 00:24:47.291, Speaker A: Aura Rada have a nice fly, my friend. Everything is going to be all right. Yes. Discussing the Scoop Airlines it was okay, I guess. It's like a Singapore. It was on its way to Singapore and it was stopping in Athens on the way, so I guess that's scoop. It was actually a pretty nice flight.
00:24:47.291 - 00:25:02.015, Speaker A: They make you check in your second bag though, which was kind of lame if you're traveling Europe. Chrome Void thank you for Shout out, Adrian. Really appreciate your covering the work. My pleasure. Chrome thank you for the comment. Luciana Guerra we're gonna see some physical works by Luciana shortly. Big shout out.
00:25:02.015 - 00:25:18.909, Speaker A: Cloud Claude yes, answering the question. Is social proof an illusion? Kind of a deep question actually, which I agree with you. Cloud I think I agree. That's why I say it's deep. I think I agree. It depends. It's a deep discussion.
00:25:18.909 - 00:25:38.025, Speaker A: There's a lot to discuss in it. Thank you for the comment. Retro Manny Very glad to see you covering KF's awesome on chain collection. We're going to look closely in a second here at all this on chain business. It was actually quite a feat to get that inscribed onto tezos. Just m0 had a lot to do with enabling this too. Well worth looking into.
00:25:38.025 - 00:26:07.311, Speaker A: Yes. I think it's really interesting this on chain business and I've kind of been discussing this to a certain degree. Like, I still wonder, like, what I would love is for it to all be on chain. And I don't know why there's a blockchain that just doesn't have huge blocks. In terms of memory, I've mentioned this before where you can upload a hundred megabyte file into a block and that there's a blockchain dedicated. Dedicated to that and then that's it. And then you just don't.
00:26:07.311 - 00:26:36.601, Speaker A: There's no I interplanetary business and you know, arweave paying fees. That is the blockchain and it's just all on chain. So I don't know why that's not done. So anyways, interesting to see this on Tezos. I'm still kind of, I guess I'd say biased towards bitcoin in terms of if I'm going to put work on chain just because it's easy. But more. But more than that, more than that, it's because it's bitcoin.
00:26:36.601 - 00:27:16.181, Speaker A: So in terms of why are we putting work on chain is sort of my question that I would ask myself and maybe ask other people and I'd argue the reason we're putting it on chain is because it's more resilient. And then so the question then for me is, well, where do you want to put it? The most resilient blockchain, the most secure, the one that's most likely to be here in a thousand years, or on Tezos, which is a great art blockchain. But yeah, I mean, those are the questions that go through my mind. So I'd be curious if anybody's watching this and they have an answer. I'd be curious to know, but quite fascinating. We're going to look closer at this and actually Retro Manny, just put out a video and we'll look at that tweet in a second. Lily Illo, awesome to hear from you.
00:27:16.181 - 00:27:26.421, Speaker A: Wonderful show. Awesome. Olivera Durdevic, wonderful show as well. Lily Olivera Durdevic, thank you for the feature, Adrian. Great show. I've recently discovered Quampa's Ms. Paintworks.
00:27:26.421 - 00:27:45.641, Speaker A: Delightful. We're going to see another work in Progress Olivera this show Kiss Kalowski the first piece by Ex Mortal is amazing. That was beautiful. We're going to see a couple more actually. Walk A joy to hear from the great walk the Maestro Gonadji thank you for the comment. Pedro Jose Great explanation. Thank you.
00:27:45.641 - 00:28:13.981, Speaker A: Mario Brexic I found via Animic similar retweeting Scamra I'll follow you both because you're way out of my comfort zone. Since I don't have an account on YouTube I will use my trusty fraidy cat to follow your tubulage. I might have missed 350 episodes of content. Welcome Mario. I hope you find this interesting and by all means write a comment if you have questions. Kel's Nice one Adrian Relying on the music like you wouldn't believe. So true, so true.
00:28:13.981 - 00:28:41.799, Speaker A: The Tradscape back on scene we have a work by Tradscape. By the way, who made the music that opens and closes this show. L'Enquisitor awesome to hear from you in Weirdgrip X and also very quickly here as we're at the 28 minute mark just through the community here. Cryptochiapas some generative work here, as you can see. So very cool. Thank you for posting that. And Austin, actually we'll see this work later on in the show.
00:28:41.799 - 00:29:01.713, Speaker A: New series of Pixelworks. Dull but exciting. Gray on gray is the new black. That's funny. Yeah, Gray background. Yeah, I actually use it quite commonly orange and gray just for starting a pixel artwork. Son of Stag who's actually going to be on the spaces in maybe about a month or so, three to four weeks.
00:29:01.713 - 00:29:23.925, Speaker A: Tape screeching noises Nostalgia for 1980s gaming. Frame by frame animated. So awesome piece here by Son of Stag here. Very cool. Martin Jo with a work here. Thank you for posting. AI artwork of the I guess that's a kinky bear surgeon bear making dinner.
00:29:23.925 - 00:29:36.269, Speaker A: Interestingly Texadelic. Great to hear from you. Very cool textures here. And Requiem Delones some interesting pieces here. A couple of paintings here. These are available on Object. Very cool.
00:29:36.269 - 00:29:51.511, Speaker A: You can see the Van Gogh Dr. Guichet. Is that the name? Gachet Guichet. Lego X. Thank you for posting beautiful pixel artwork. And Gina Montaigna a collage work here. This is on Object, so a wonderful place to discover new artists.
00:29:51.511 - 00:30:14.299, Speaker A: And here's this is quite interesting. This was Kiro posted. This is. We'll look at this in a second. Eboy the pioneers, some of the major, if not the pioneers of pixel art did a work of Camela from and I think of Trump in the debate. So we'll look at that. Leizhou X Posting goyoung not sure if I've seen this one.
00:30:14.299 - 00:30:36.279, Speaker A: The great Goyoung Arts. Just fantastic artist. And here Luke 500 posting this generative art piece. I think this is who is Dimitri Chernias Cherniak I think, but I'm not positive there. So I guess a new series. I guess it's on Ethereum because it sold for nine and a half eth. I'm not sure.
00:30:36.279 - 00:31:07.355, Speaker A: So interesting. Was selling for a ton of money though. Bought for 20 days ago at Sotheby's for over $21,000. Sold today at a loss. So interesting. Generative art Skull takes a video tutorial on how to mint on chain art on Tazos. So if people are looking for that you can find in the artist journal community that is posted here by Skull Takes Son of Stag also, who again will be on with some beautiful textures here, playing with the magic wand there and big shout out on the portrait which I should have brought up here.
00:31:07.355 - 00:31:27.583, Speaker A: Let me see if I can bring that up here in a second. And Iris Deleuze, thank you for posting Plague Simulacro. Just beautiful. Thank you everybody for posting here. Ilya Bliznets, Martin Jo and everyone. I think we've gotten and Lucas Lejeune and I think we've gotten to where we were last episode. Look at that fake meat.
00:31:27.583 - 00:31:52.029, Speaker A: Love it. Okay, let's go to Son of Stagnant very quickly. Thank you for the portrait. Let me just bring this up and otherwise I have it in my feed and it might have been a few days ago. And thank you for the retweet there. This is a work I recently posted that's on ordinals, that's on bitcoin and we'll talk about the compressionism thing in a second here. There we go.
00:31:52.029 - 00:32:10.565, Speaker A: Worship at the altar of the magic wand. I maybe I said that the great magic wand, what probably my two favorite tools are. Thank you for the portrait. Looks like a lot of magic wand there. Thank you. As I look kind of interestingly at the camera there kind of a nice watercolor feel to that piece. Thank you, Son of a Stag.
00:32:10.565 - 00:32:46.935, Speaker A: Beautiful addition to the awesome portraits that this generous community has given over the last couple of years here. Yeah, we'll look at compressionism in a second and it interestingly I would say crosses over with pixel art because pixel art is small, right? This is 64 by 64. You could put this on Bitcoin for probably a dollar, right? So we'll look at what compressionism means. Basically small file size. I'm not sure if we need the term, but maybe we do. I'm kind of ambivalent on it right now. We'll have that discussion a second.
00:32:46.935 - 00:33:02.519, Speaker A: But Eboy doing Camelot. Let's just see if Eboy. So thank you, Kiro. So I guess just. There's Donald. Okay, so everybody getting a piece here, both sides. And so interesting, interesting reserve of 0.25
00:33:02.519 - 00:33:36.545, Speaker A: eth. And look at this. So I saw this on my Instagram. So AI Weiwei and of course Joshua Sable Ahek sent this to me or AI Weiwei doing pixel art and Lego maybe I want to say six or eight months ago. But then I saw this and take a look at this is a screen print. Kind of directly goes right into our conversation that we've been having on pixel art making physicals of digital. And here I just thought like, here's AI Weiwei, you know, one of the world's most famous artists.
00:33:36.545 - 00:34:09.221, Speaker A: What is he working on? Pixel art and making digitals physical. Traveling through the mediums here and quite a beautiful rendition, I have to say. And there's an important thing I'd say, like, I don't think AI Weiwei is doing the screen printing himself. And there are even videos. You see this, it's like done by a machine and a whole workshop here. Like that is not AI Weiwei over here. So it's an important thing because let's say you make pixel art, for example, and you want to make screen prints.
00:34:09.221 - 00:34:41.909, Speaker A: You don't necessarily have to learn how to screen print. If you want to start deviating and put, you know, do a Warhol where you put paint underneath and then, okay, then you start to have to learn how to screen print. But you can theoretically just send it off to a printer like this and then you'll get, you know, pretty perfect looking pieces here. And what's cool about it too is it's not too perfect. See the little white line there? The registration is off by like a quarter of a millimeter. Fascinating. And it really adds to the work.
00:34:41.909 - 00:35:12.745, Speaker A: It's like the imperfection of physical reality, right? Or the physical rendition of a work, it makes it even more precious rather than it being just super perfect, then you might as well just print it, let's say, you know, on a really thick paper or something. So, and I believe these sold for about $1,000. Yeah, that's a. It's kind of interesting marketing here. It looks like a euro, but it's €1054. But I guess they kind of get you interested with that. The psychology of that pricing there.
00:35:12.745 - 00:35:30.201, Speaker A: Everyone is a dragon. So I thought that was super interesting. Also here, Albert Olin. These works I think are from the. There are some that are new, but I think some of them are from the 90s. If I'm not mistaken, these might be. I don't know if these are new ones like.
00:35:30.201 - 00:35:48.159, Speaker A: But. But some of these have dithering in it is my point here. Computer builder. So build in German as image. So computer images. And I think was working on some of these as early as the 90s. So way ahead.
00:35:48.159 - 00:36:18.849, Speaker A: Albert Olin on the fun of dithering here and turning. And again, what is he doing? Screen printing. Because I've seen some of these in person, you know, doing some paint work on it. But ultimately I think it's screen printing because how do you do the perfection of digital? It's screen printing. And you can see there, you know, some dithering. So it's not the easiest photos to see here. They're kind of small, but if you do some research you'll see that.
00:36:18.849 - 00:36:41.601, Speaker A: And if you're in Berlin, there's actually a couple on display at Max Hetzler that you can see in person. So this whole compressionist thing. Compressionist Korl Snik. So Sabato here. I guess this is becoming a thing on. I don't know who came up with the term, but Sabato adopting some of it. 187 kilobytes could be an ordinal these days.
00:36:41.601 - 00:37:15.801, Speaker A: It might not be too expensive. I'd guess like 60 or 70 bucks these days. Maybe you could get it for even less. You might even be able to get 30 or 40 bucks, which is pretty cheap for that huge of a file. If you saw that Inferno work that was retweeted by Son of Stag that I did, that was about five kilobytes. When the fees, when the mempool was at about 40, it was about 30 or 40 and it cost about 30 or 40 bucks, maybe even more. About $40 to mint a five kilobyte file.
00:37:15.801 - 00:37:48.281, Speaker A: So now it's almost a tenth of that. So maybe it cost me like 50 cents a dollar to do a 50 kilobyte. So maybe it'd only be a few bucks. Like, I mean, now is the time if you're going to put work on ordinals, now is the time. So interesting, interesting piece here by Sabato. Also here, compressionist Bluefin. So it seems like this term is being used to Describe trying to get files as small as possible.
00:37:48.281 - 00:38:09.845, Speaker A: And we have another example where someone compresses a JPEG over and over until it's the smallest it can get and you get all the artifacts with it. Super interesting. So of course this is a work by Sabato that's been reduced to three colors. Again, still 140 kilobytes. So not tiny, but small, we might say. So all very interesting experimentation. We see mech.
00:38:09.845 - 00:38:46.939, Speaker A: Txt going on chain on eth permeon. And so here again you go reduced colors. I mean, how big is this? I'd guess like 256 by 256. If I had to guess, it's here on foundation and they're using Efficacs, Efficax, oxd, iid. So there, there are ways to do it if you want to do it on Ethereum. Again, I'm still kind of. If you can do it on Bitcoin, why aren't we doing it on bitcoin? Sort of my thing, but pick whatever blockchain everybody loves here.
00:38:46.939 - 00:39:26.829, Speaker A: KF doing it on Tezos. But you're seeing this on chain art thing. You're seeing the conflation of on chain art, pixel art and third on chain art, pixel art. And I guess this compressionism thing, right? Compressionism. And you're seeing. Because again, if you want to compress it, generally you start getting small file sizes, right? And hence you end up in pixel art almost. Even if you're doing so, you see almost all of these compressed things are kind of what you'd call pixel art or close to it, small, you know, 240 by 240 pixels.
00:39:26.829 - 00:39:40.675, Speaker A: You start to get into the land of pixel art. There. 5.22 kilobytes PNG. So interesting. Now this is interesting here too. So OMG, I drawed it open edition.
00:39:40.675 - 00:40:37.163, Speaker A: I've been thinking about longevity and art recently. And as a person, I suppose with the dawn of AI and crumbling markets for crypto and art, many questions all around about how this will be in the years to come. In an attempt to begin working with work compressed enough to begin considering minting some of the works fully on chain on Tezos. As a response to my questions about longevity, I've come up with a colorful and chaotic way of working, beginning with rough in my beginning with roughs in my usual illustrative style, before digitally painting them in a looser style using brushes created to replicate acrylic squash pencil crayons, which are then crushed, mashed and recolored to make some interesting marks. These techniques, brushes mostly borne out of spate of bad RSI in my arm, which has led to making art with less intricacy while the injury healed. Once it's completed, I cut out some areas to glitch for added texture and romanticism. So again we're seeing.
00:40:37.163 - 00:40:52.095, Speaker A: And here you kind of see it. And let's zoom in. This is. Here it is. So again we end up at pixel art, I would argue. Or where at least you can see the pixels and these smaller file sizes. I'm curious to know how big this is.
00:40:52.095 - 00:41:21.665, Speaker A: I'm not sure. I always get kind of confused here. Maybe it says here for some reason it doesn't say. I don't know why we don't have the bytes there. But anyways, I would be very curious to know. So minted on Tazos on chain. Interestingly, and this was the first post I saw about compression, so called compressionism, which I'm again, I'm ambivalent on on the term.
00:41:21.665 - 00:41:51.169, Speaker A: Do you ever just JPEG compression. It's pretty interesting. I mean this looks like a classic glitch technique to basically keep compressing till you get something pretty nice texture. Actually I would say like it's a nicer piece on the right, I'd argue, than on the left before the compression delta sauce. Do you. And here's Sabato. And so a lot of compressionism on the timeline you see commenting on that and Sabato replying, I prefer compressionism to whatever.
00:41:51.169 - 00:42:08.937, Speaker A: I have to totally agree. I've never bought in, to be just super blunt about it. This neoprecia. This is the problem with isms. Okay, let me just put it this way. And why I'm ambivalent even on compressionism, because all of a sudden they become marketing terms and it's like the pop artists. There were pop artists that hated the term pop.
00:42:08.937 - 00:42:32.325, Speaker A: Because all of a sudden. And all of a sudden with compressionism, I'm starting to understand it because all of a sudden someone could say, adrian, you're a compressionist artist with your works on, you know, ordinals with the Dante inferno, pixel art inferno. That would be. Are you a compressionist artist? And I'd be like, well, you know, maybe. I don't know. I don't need to be called that. Let's put it that way.
00:42:32.325 - 00:43:11.611, Speaker A: So this is the thing. Because then all of a sudden it becomes this marketing thing. We're almost back to social proof, and then everybody jumps on the bandwagon and. And then it's like, okay. And then it's like this almost artificial kind of response to the work that kind of packages it as marketing so that the general masses know oh, this is a thing. And then the hype starts building. Right? So I prefer compressionism to whatever neoprecision, precisionism, neoprecision, neoprecisionism was supposed to be because digital artists have been compressing things since forever.
00:43:11.611 - 00:43:42.753, Speaker A: Yes, I never really bought into this term. I'm not even sure I buy into this term to be frank. So. But other people are allowed to and that's okay and that's cool. But also I get the feeling that this space just discovered Photoshop safe for web options and are like, wow, so interesting there. Eric Eth the problem with Ethereum right now is not the roadmap. So another kind of perspective here, but slightly different in a larger context.
00:43:42.753 - 00:44:28.275, Speaker A: The problem is VCs have milked L2s and restaking apps via ridiculous value valuations and BS airdrops to the point. No one cares anymore. There's a complete lack of community driven narrative and enthusiasm and it shows. I will say this about compressionism. It's the only narrative I see that's new and fresh on the timeline. And I find it hilarious that once again the artists, you know, oftentimes the culture, like the arts and whatever, sometimes can take a second a backseat, so to speak, to the financial and you know, the blockchain tech and everything. But again, where are we finding a new narrative? Interestingly, for better or for worse, I mean it's in the arts again with compression, so called compressionism.
00:44:28.275 - 00:45:07.809, Speaker A: So there is a narrative out there that's kind of come this is as well as the on chain narrative, which again is I'd argue, an art narrative. Here's memetics. You're 100 referring to NFTs as the ultimate contrarian asset. You're 100% correct, my friend. And you know what? NFTs will be at the top of the list fully on and you know which NFTs fully on chain NFTs. So there is a bit of momentum here. There's a bit of enthusiasm on this idea of not relying on these decentralized cloud servers or whatever they are to hold the image.
00:45:07.809 - 00:45:38.035, Speaker A: People and even funds in AI are going to need the assurance that the images will be there no matter what. Only fully on chain NFTs can guarantee that. Pretty interesting. Let me continue here. Retro Manny finally on chain minting on Tezos. So this is Retro Manny's tutorial on how to do it. A step by step guide on how to Use the Xero contract by just M0 and InscribeArt directly on the Tezos blockchain.
00:45:38.035 - 00:45:58.009, Speaker A: So that is cool. Check out Manny's feed. It's also there in the artist journal community page. Thank you for sending that. And also these are on chain as well. Retroman Sega looks like it's going to be an on chain video game. Interestingly so here they are.
00:45:58.009 - 00:46:18.795, Speaker A: There are four available and they are this size, interestingly. So cool work from Retro Manny. Mike Bespalov. Finally. I needed a dithering effect for some project photos, but none of the available tools were cutting it, so I built my own. I almost wonder if he used ChatGPT or if he coded it himself. It only took a couple of hours and I'm pretty proud of that result.
00:46:18.795 - 00:46:39.955, Speaker A: It is pretty nice. I have to say this. Who wouldn't want this? And you can generally get this, but it just gives you a certain degree of control with all of these sliders. Beautiful. And the dither tool went viral, so I'm turning it into a Figma plugin and maybe a web service later. Stay tuned. So very cool.
00:46:39.955 - 00:47:03.917, Speaker A: Just things move fast in the space. Finally, Bosquez. You see all the slides in the computer. Almost looks like Bosque may have returned home, but not sure. Continuing on, Luciana Guerra. And here, paintings as part of a contemporary art exhibition you can visit in Macab Museum until the end of September. So looking very cool.
00:47:03.917 - 00:47:14.965, Speaker A: I guess those are oil paintings or acrylic. I think acrylic. Pretty impressive. Let's just make that big. From Luciana Guerra. Very cool. And here's Olin.
00:47:14.965 - 00:47:29.905, Speaker A: Look at this. Playing with trading card. And the plastic round trading cards. So very cool there. And into the works we go. How are we doing? 47 minutes. I'm gonna run through this.
00:47:29.905 - 00:47:50.301, Speaker A: I can hear Airbnb people in the apartments next to me. So I am going to keep it down a little bit. And we're going to continue here. Here is Yuri J with a gorgeous work. I managed to get on object as well as many of you, if you're quick and cooking. What I Loved about it. Edition of 20.
00:47:50.301 - 00:48:17.845, Speaker A: Now it's 77 tazos on secondary. What I loved about it was it's almost like making art, right? You're cooking. And it's also another domestic scene. And again you see the wonder and majesty of Yuri J's work. You see it in the little spoon here, or spatula, whatever that is. You see again, trademark mosaic filter. And then the eggs and everything.
00:48:17.845 - 00:48:58.135, Speaker A: It's like cooking is a Metaphor for art making here. Very cool work from Uri J. And even there in the pot again you see digital painting. Hardcore gas stove as we continue here and here. This was a. This was a auction of a one of one. And as you can see here and here again you can see the mosaic filter and the interesting taking the layer and moving it to the side here and more.
00:48:58.135 - 00:49:10.127, Speaker A: So cool work here. I think it went for 400 tazos. If I'm not mistaken. It did to bullseye 180 who I think wrote a post about it. So very cool. 250 bucks. Pretty good gas stove.
00:49:10.127 - 00:49:33.941, Speaker A: 1 of 1. Yuri J. Here's rat cloak. Also point out a 1 of 1, this 350 tase. And of course out of Ukraine digital painting here. And as you can see all of the kind of ambiguous horror elements here from Ratcloak here. And not sure exactly what that is.
00:49:33.941 - 00:49:59.455, Speaker A: Maybe it's the horse that is melting. And kind of a surreal looking digital painting from Ratcloak. Kind of dark, muted colors. Dead horse died Recently. Edition of 1350 Tezos. This was put on also by Ratcloak on I guess is this also on object? I hadn't seen this. And maybe this will freeze my computer here.
00:49:59.455 - 00:50:16.295, Speaker A: Let us see here. So also I think on object. I have to be very careful. We have a lot open right now. We've been recording for an hour. Here we go. Okay, we're back.
00:50:16.295 - 00:50:38.467, Speaker A: Okay, edition of 10 by Ratcloak. And so kind of looking very similar palette here. Similar kind of use of the person with these kind of things coming off these branches, coming off in angles. We saw it in the horse here earlier. Right. So really edgy, kind of surreal. Artwork by Rat Cloak sold out at 25 tazos each.
00:50:38.467 - 00:50:52.195, Speaker A: Nice work. And continuing on, here's the myth. Who is going to be on this Wednesday. The intelligence of Saturn. Interesting title and subject matter here. Kind of a different looking work. Almost a Renaissance type.
00:50:52.195 - 00:51:17.351, Speaker A: Compositional structure with the. There's a word for this which I am blanking on right now where you'd almost put different scenes from the saint and underneath, I want to say Perdella. And so interesting structure here from the Mint. You got the lemon hand at the bottom. And then these three mysterious figures. Almost looks like it's taken from a blini or something. The intelligence of Saturn.
00:51:17.351 - 00:51:32.615, Speaker A: Maybe we'll ask on Wednesday. Edition of 10 for 35 tezos each. And they are selling eight gone, nine gone and one to go. I think. Let's just look here three to go at 35. Nice work from the myth. I'm not sure if this is new or not.
00:51:32.615 - 00:52:00.855, Speaker A: This is Sum de la creme on. Super rare. Is this a new, super rare work, but loved this. One of the great things about Sum's work is the different textures. Where here you'll get a bit of a. You see here it looks like colored pencils, but here it might be slightly more painterly. And we see that in some of her other work too, where it's like you'll see the chalkboard, someone writing on chalkboard here.
00:52:00.855 - 00:52:26.179, Speaker A: Diary. This was from Sumi, where you see in August here. And as you see here, playing with different mediums here and within a kind of painting structure. Interesting piece. Kind of looks like a diary and kind of feels like a reference to Kafka there with the beetle and almost in someone's room, but maybe it's in the kitchen there. And the interesting cat in the background. Cool works from Sumire.
00:52:26.179 - 00:52:40.281, Speaker A: See only five tazos and six left. Let's continue. Here's Aksin Denial. And maybe just a sketch for Axe. Pretty rad textures going on here. Nice loose feel. Nice square brush.
00:52:40.281 - 00:53:02.545, Speaker A: We're seeing this a few places right now. Looking good from. Interesting color deviation here from Xene2. Or just evolution, shall we say? Dan Control. Huge fan of using the mosquito. The mosquito repeller, for lack of better term. Mixing it with batteries here.
00:53:02.545 - 00:53:19.515, Speaker A: Interesting blue background. Just great modern art. Contemporary art pieces by Dan Control here. Using contemporary items. Just very interesting and cool. And then you just put a blank color underneath. Gorgeous.
00:53:19.515 - 00:53:35.719, Speaker A: It's like an, you know, you could call that, you know, make up another term. Neo pop or something. Very, very cool. Works here by Dan control. Here's enough. 1914. Playing off of Matisse and the Fish here.
00:53:35.719 - 00:53:54.719, Speaker A: Just a gorgeous homage to Matisse in this digital artwork. It was only 10 tazos. Edition of two sold out, I think right away. Only came out a day ago. Interesting. Matisse's work made for me. Interesting pastel.
00:53:54.719 - 00:54:19.789, Speaker A: Y Fiesta, another work by Neve, 1914, edition of three. So going up from the one editions to two or three. And here we see a small fiesta going back to the party theme. And this is one left at nine tezos. This is a new artist I found on X. I think it was Sailor Morkos. Another kind of interesting, experimental almost, I'd call gradient Artist.
00:54:19.789 - 00:54:33.781, Speaker A: Here's one piece. Beautiful colors here. And then a different variation was minted. This was put on Zora. So interesting. Interesting. Different colors here, different gradient underneath.
00:54:33.781 - 00:55:01.615, Speaker A: It shows how again with Digital art, you can. There's a million different ways you can do one piece, as you can see here, by just removing layers. Like you cannot do that quite in the same way that you could in physical. But then it makes you think of Warhol, where actually that's what he was doing. He would change the background color, make a new work, paint, do a pink Marilyn and let's do a blue Marilyn now. You know, so it's interesting. There's nothing wrong.
00:55:01.615 - 00:55:22.161, Speaker A: And we've seen this with St. Louis Osborne. You know, different artists have worked with this idea that you'd simply change the color. Kapn had I think some three and a half inch floppy disks that were done in different colors. I think Haiti Rockette. It's an interesting thing. So here a different work.
00:55:22.161 - 00:55:36.265, Speaker A: Rafinus Sativus. So interesting discovery here. Sailor Morcos is the artist. Here's Juana Pedro. We've looked at some of their works. Really edgy, kind of abstract artworks. I think they're abstract.
00:55:36.265 - 00:55:57.731, Speaker A: Not even NFTs are dead. That's on Instagram. Another artist, this is 2002 whose work we've looked at. This is on Zora. So again, kind of challenging experimental artwork. A lot of gradients being used. Here is the Great Zuozhou picked up by Absurd Deity in and out of the mirror plant.

And here you see that square brush. We're seeing it in Xing and you gotta love stuff where it turns blue like that there. Just brilliant.
00:58:12.439 - 00:58:27.111, Speaker A: And then what is this face doing here? Hilarious. Hilarious. Beautiful. Interesting. And then this hand with a face in it. And again, we're seeing this square brush interestingly. Very curious with a lot of texture on it.
00:58:27.111 - 00:58:49.585, Speaker A: Look at how beautiful this is. You know, Ahek was talking about how he's. Yeah, he absolutely loves Waffles work. He's been a huge collector too. We've watched it the whole way as Ahek. Yeah, just we've been watching it since Ahek discovered Waffles. And just awesome.
00:58:49.585 - 00:59:01.107, Speaker A: I agree. Like one of his favorite artists, like out there right now. One of the most significant, I think he was saying. I totally agree. It makes it look so easy too. Just on a roll. Here's another one by Waffles.
00:59:01.107 - 00:59:20.619, Speaker A: Targeted individual. So just super interesting. There's a very. Put it this way, like I see a very kind of Basquiat kind of thing going on here where he can just do whatever he wants. And it's just kind of interesting. And it kind of turns into an attractive artwork just by. For whatever reason.
00:59:20.619 - 00:59:37.899, Speaker A: This is kind of hilarious too. Civilization and its discontents. And here you can see show boobs. I guess that's the ID coming out. And no, the superego is saying. So a lot going on here, actually. And this beautifully done.
00:59:37.899 - 00:59:58.573, Speaker A: Again, it looks like it took about 15 minutes to make this artwork. Hard to say, but still beautiful. Here is Ed Morola. So good to keep on top of Edmirola. Of course, not on X right now because Brazil is off Twitter. And here, just a really cool kind of work. Let's see if we can zoom in kind of insect like creatures here.
00:59:58.573 - 01:00:21.613, Speaker A: And beautiful sampled brush and some sort of figure on top. Protecting nature edition of 5. And this is sold for 39 tazos. So maybe 4 left, 3 left. Continuing on ReMax broker this by PP Universal. So not sure what's going on here. Almost looks like a phone that is folded over.
01:00:21.613 - 01:00:34.373, Speaker A: Hard to say. Maybe that's a shirt, actually. And these are nails here. And there is a hand. So interesting composition. Unfortunately, I only have the small version of this. This is Jake Studios.
01:00:34.373 - 01:00:57.443, Speaker A: And this is right click Save us. And here you see some images and JPEG icons being burnt. A little bit of background noise here. And keep grinding. It's a beautiful work here by Louis Osborne. Gorgeous and kind of looks like some paraphernalia here. A phone on object.com
01:00:57.443 - 01:01:07.251, Speaker A: hilarious. And a coffee. So all the good things in life here. Keep grinding. Edition of 20. This must be sold out and offers coming in. Very cool.

01:01:23.535 - 01:01:45.455, Speaker A: And again, kind of looks like a work in progress, but not sure. Has been posting a lot of work in progress. Color composition study in Microsoft Paint. So maybe it's a finished. It is a study by Quampa, I believe out of Indonesia. Here's Lorna Mills Larping Athena. And here you can see a what looks like a galaxy here being masked.
01:01:45.455 - 01:02:01.811, Speaker A: And let's continue. Mumble Boy. Just getting distracted by the background here. Don't mind me. So look at Mumble Boy. Beautiful collage work here from Mumble Boy. And let me see.
01:02:01.811 - 01:02:17.925, Speaker A: This looks like a one of one Forever Express 16 Tez. I'm going to run through this in case I get interrupted. This is Neymark. So Santiago with a beautiful work. Kind of looks like AI and abstract. Gorgeous sense and meaning. Here's another one.
01:02:17.925 - 01:02:33.935, Speaker A: Pretty beautiful work from Santiago. And here is a collaboration between Yuri J. And Santiago. I've spent some time recently with Mirror City, Hologram Volcano, also known as Santiago. Here's what happened. And three more below. So very cool.
01:02:33.935 - 01:02:47.899, Speaker A: Here is one of those works in this collab between Yuri J. And Santiago. Here's Walk with a famous painting. Again, not sure. Self Portrait is David. And once again, starting with a one Tez. Starting bid.
01:02:47.899 - 01:03:19.449, Speaker A: Here's RJ with some very interesting works coming out. Body and Soul. Kind of looks like he's using AI, but he also seems to be pixelating some of it. Kind of a weird mix of genres here, which is why it's not in the AI section. And I kept it in the painting section and I'm not positive it's AI, but I'm pretty sure AI is being used after the Great American Nude Number 43 by Tom Wesselman. Interesting. So I guess that's in here in the frame.
01:03:19.449 - 01:03:36.175, Speaker A: So famous pop artist. The screen is a bed. This is also rj. So these are just a few of the works by rj. And here you can see the computer in the background. Person. Again, looks like an AI artwork, doesn't it? Or at least foundation for an artwork.
01:03:36.175 - 01:03:58.421, Speaker A: And this is called Rescue. And so continuing on. There is no take two on this episode here. So hopefully we do not get interrupted abeyance. I hear people right outside. Beautiful nude here from rj. So very interesting work.
01:03:58.421 - 01:04:24.931, Speaker A: Again, kind of looks like a AI basis but not sure Lucas Le Jeune image generation. So also a very cool looking artwork here. Kind of different for Lucas Legend who does a lot of kind of vector works I think kind of abstract animated works. So interesting piece there. Observe. Deity is getting bullish on the scene. Hey, picking up this Kaziro Kazuhiro Ahara.
01:04:24.931 - 01:04:45.795, Speaker A: And it's probably not, you know, 99 tazos. So building the Tazos collection here. Let's see. So just a super interesting artist here as we saw. Gonna keep running through here as we try and get through here. Spiegel's masculine. Still have a lot to go to the end.
01:04:45.795 - 01:04:58.195, Speaker A: Very cool computer work by Spiegels. Look at those outlines. And you see the green. Very cool. I think sold on primary for only 25 days. That was pretty reasonable. Now on secondary for 75.
01:04:58.195 - 01:05:10.865, Speaker A: This might be loud. This. Let's just see here. Turn it down a bit. This is byte by bit. I love you. Using Apple 80s software should freak everybody out.
01:05:10.865 - 01:05:26.005, Speaker A: I love you. And pause. And pause. So that is available 25dez from Bite by Bit. Her Maypay pixel art on Instagram. I don't think mints anything I think would do really well on the blockchain. Doesn't meant anything.
01:05:26.005 - 01:05:43.989, Speaker A: Just gorgeous work here. Would love to see this done in physical as well. And here's another one by her Mape Pixel art also on Instagram. Love these figures here in the foreground too. Beautiful. I think makes on it on their phone. Interestingly I'm curious what software they're using.
01:05:43.989 - 01:06:13.229, Speaker A: The fix. Blood Blood Knight. And so here's Kapp and put out a couple of works for fear for Tez maybe is the work is the hashtag very cool over here. So with this gradient and you see the dithering and everything looks like a crucifix in the background. Here's another edition of 13 Ascension. Missed this one. And another just super rad artwork here by Kappen.
01:06:13.229 - 01:06:29.661, Speaker A: Some pixels moving, other pixels still. Just very poetic work from Kappen. Here's Popple. Haven't seen a ton from Popple. Rinello wallpapers. Amiga GBC Master nes. So interesting.
01:06:29.661 - 01:06:51.195, Speaker A: Almost Looks like phone wallpaper from Popple. Interestingly, haven't seen a ton minted by Popple recently, but there may be some that I'm just not aware of. I love the title of this one. Supply Chain by Green Ginger. Kind of looking like a bit of a factory or something going on here. Very cool piece. I picked up one at two tazos.
01:06:51.195 - 01:07:07.321, Speaker A: It's sold out now. Edition of 11. Here's Element Lee areas. Almost looks like a cigarette, but maybe it's something different. Maybe it's just colors together. Kind of a cool pixel art, kind of abstract kind of work. Very interesting as usual from Element Ly.
01:07:07.321 - 01:07:30.827, Speaker A: Here is Salawaki, the flora and fauna of Solana. So interesting. There's a bit of music here. That goes for three minutes. Let me see if I can get the mic. Should start to. It's kind of a fun piece by salwaki.
01:07:30.827 - 01:07:45.979, Speaker A: That's 10 tezos. Looks like it's sold out. Let's see. It is sold out at 550. So cool work from Salawaki on object. Here's Tradscape. I was mentioning this earlier.
01:07:45.979 - 01:08:03.535, Speaker A: My pixel animation rework. Louise Davis Minot, Niagara Falls. So taking almost a different an old painting and then animating it with pixel art. Always original. Here from Tradscape who of course I follow. That is a glitch on X when you open up a bunch of tabs. Very cool.
01:08:03.535 - 01:08:22.115, Speaker A: I don't think it's minted anywhere yet, but I hope it will be Dan Anthony Kelly. And so here is Draw Dog Tuesday. And so this is posted on Instagram. So continuing with the dog theme on Tuesday, here's Austin. We saw this in the community section. Moving right along. Pixels are flowing today.
01:08:22.115 - 01:08:39.611, Speaker A: So also playing with pixel art and animals and movement. Interestingly. And again, kind of a dark gray on a light gray. Here's E Boy. I thought this was brilliant. This is a very brilliant pixel art version of the flag. Register to vote.
01:08:39.611 - 01:08:55.605, Speaker A: E Boy Arts. This was totally brilliant. This could have started the show. A very interesting novel rendition of the US flag. You know a much. You know, again you think of Jasper Johns there. A brilliant rendition there.
01:08:55.605 - 01:09:21.407, Speaker A: More pixel art. This is Noodler memories woven through water. So more interesting pieces here from noodler edition of 30. This is five tezos and there are still 10 left. So large edition size, interesting colors. And here is Michael macasso or Mech TXT iconoclast SVG. So putting out a Alphabet.
01:09:21.407 - 01:09:42.893, Speaker A: Interestingly, CCO cite the author download icon. So very cool. That is 45tez and is that on primary? No, that's on secondary. So I note on primary at only 5 TEZ. Here's Haiti Rockette with a very cool Nintendo glitch ROM. So it looks like from maybe a racing game. Not sure.
01:09:42.893 - 01:10:03.905, Speaker A: Very minimal. No is the title. And here's just an awesome one by Haiti rocket edition of 5 Warlow doing Super Mario. And we have more Super Mario this time by Sabato after this. But this is Haiti Rockette who just really has his own take on The Nintendo glitch ROM. Just very cool. Love it.
01:10:03.905 - 01:10:35.305, Speaker A: Very, very cool. That's 58 Tezos on secondary. Only addition of five. And here is Sabato with the Mario FOMO mix. And there's data bending in the audio so you can hear the glitch in the audio. That's pretty original. I think it's an open edition.
01:10:35.305 - 01:10:49.909, Speaker A: I think it's an open edition. That just closed. So pretty interesting 40 tes now. Yeah, it just closed and now 40 tez. That was an easy pickup. Easy decision. Head in the Clouds was also gorgeous.
01:10:49.909 - 01:11:30.625, Speaker A: This was for gift day. Really nice Super Mario work from Sabato. Glitch just so again the glitch ROM thing continues to be interesting out here. Now available for 18 TEZ on secondary here this is available Retro Power. This is Glitch Town Arcade. So racing games working particularly well in glitch ROM and as a glitch rom and that's again 99 cents. Here's another one by Glitchtown Arcade 43 it's called so almost to the point Glitching to the point of abstraction here where you can't even tell what game it is.
01:11:30.625 - 01:11:47.933, Speaker A: A couple of more by Exmortal Red Point as we get into analog video glitch. Just loving these landscapes here. This is 14 Tezos, an addition of 13. We just had Ex Mortal on the space. It was awesome. Here's another beautiful one. Solstice.
01:11:47.933 - 01:12:09.551, Speaker A: Only three Tezos 33 edition of 100. And there you see the sun going down. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous. Let's Continue. Elna Frederick Chandek 48. This is on Object. I'm not going to open that up but I thought kind of a fun almost 80s work.
01:12:09.551 - 01:12:28.707, Speaker A: Here is Yamaka. Here's Renki on Object but this is on Instagram. And another invention, another abstract invention from Renki. So consistent. Here's rada. Hilariously unbreakable 2 rare hunted and this is 29 tezos. Looks like sold out.
01:12:28.707 - 01:12:42.235, Speaker A: Beautiful GLB from Rada. Brilliant. I think it's sold out. Let's see. Note 16 left at 29 Tezos edition of 21. And here's little cakes. Let's see.
01:12:42.235 - 01:12:58.635, Speaker A: This looks like AI video, if I had to guess. I don't see any audio. Kind of a wild piece here. Let's just see. Ghosts of emojis wronged for Fear for Tez. I wonder why Fear for Tez is now. I would think that'd be during Halloween, but maybe it's not.
01:12:58.635 - 01:13:16.869, Speaker A: Sure about that. Hashtag festival Tookes when the garden becomes a mirror of the soul. So another beautiful AI artwork here by Tukes. As we wrap up here. Skomra with a very interesting piece. Gm Kind of looks like a figure. Probably AI textual inversion.
01:13:16.869 - 01:13:35.025, Speaker A: And look at this originality by no hygiene. This is on Instagram. Almost like speaking of gray on gray here, like light gray on dark gray. Really interesting AI artwork. And here's another toques from Nohygne. And here's another toques. Not sure if we saw this one.
01:13:35.025 - 01:13:46.102, Speaker A: And beautiful colors here. And originality. Love the sun with the clouds in the front. So interesting. And another AI artwork, Mr. Bizold. Looking like porcelain.
01:13:46.102 - 01:14:16.575, Speaker A: And this is 300 Tezos. And this gorgeous patterning on top of this porcelain. They should make that real, if possible, edition of 1 for 300 tazos. I thought this was brilliant too. This also could have started the show. This was where strange thing is doing kind of like Michelangelo's Dying Slave kind of combination here. But with modern.
01:14:16.575 - 01:14:48.157, Speaker A: It looks like Michelangelo sculpture, but with modern sports, NFL. These are stunning. These should be made somehow like they are made as AI artworks, but these should be made. I think this would blow the socks off in an institution, is my personal, humble opinion. I think people's minds would be blown. You put that in like some big show as physicals, maybe even marble. That would be mind blowing as we go into the physicals here.
01:14:48.157 - 01:15:12.959, Speaker A: This is Charlie Stein on Instagram here. Very cool crop here again, kind of playing with the latex and the cyberpunk sort of vibe, the robots and everything. Here's another one by Charlie now she's with Kristen Hillardy in West Palm Beach. Oh, so she's gonna have a show in West Palm beach in Florida. Berlin artist here. A lot of people know her. A very nice person.
01:15:12.959 - 01:15:30.015, Speaker A: Bondozo Bandido. Teardrop Bridge Over Troubled Waters. Interesting painting here, as usual from Bundozo Bandido. Here is Tina Kim Gallery. And they have Lee Shinja Weaving the Dawn. So I think this is weaving here. And maybe we get a close up.
01:15:30.015 - 01:15:47.071, Speaker A: We don't, unfortunately. But here, this, I think this is weaving some more interesting textures. Here's the great nugget brain. I am not cringe. Such a huge fan of this artist. They make it look so, so easy and maybe it is for them. And that's pretty funny.
01:15:47.071 - 01:15:57.447, Speaker A: Another artist, Sandy Hestart. This is on Instagram. Beautiful painting here. And figure painting. Just interesting piece. And we've seen this artist before. Lochi.
01:15:57.447 - 01:16:12.951, Speaker A: It's official. And again, more texture, kind of woven art here. Smarties. Beautiful. And that's your show, my friends, as I play the music for the neighbors here and get through it. And thank you for joining me. Until next time.
01:16:12.951 - 01:16:13.535, Speaker A: Take care.
