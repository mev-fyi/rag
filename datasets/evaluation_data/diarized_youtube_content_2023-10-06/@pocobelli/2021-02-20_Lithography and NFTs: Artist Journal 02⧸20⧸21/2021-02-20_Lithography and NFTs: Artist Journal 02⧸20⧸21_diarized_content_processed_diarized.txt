00:00:01.640 - 00:00:52.766, Speaker A: Everyone, welcome to my artist journal. Just providing an update. This is a new series I am doing in order to basically give people a more real flesh and bone version of what I'm doing. Because I've come to the conclusion that Instagram and other social media, Twitter people don't really know who you are and let you know, and I think this is true for anybody, that if you haven't had your huge success and you're already in the newspapers, and that's about 99.9% of people out there, my thinking, you need to go on video, otherwise people are not going to care who you are. You're just another email address, you're just another account. So this is what I've decided to do.
00:00:52.766 - 00:01:45.080, Speaker A: And the way I've sort of structured this, I'm sharing this with you in case it's of use to you, is I gather my thoughts on medium, where I kind of write down the three or four paragraphs of basically the update of today and what happened yesterday and what I plan to do tomorrow, and that gathers your thoughts, and then you start the video. And here we are. So the latest on me and on the art practice is basically I've started lithography, which is a very, for lack of better word, elite sort of technique. I mean, not many people do lithography, and I'm really excited to do it. This is one of the benefits of moving to Berlin. And here, I'll put some images together here, actually. And it's spring in Berlin, by the way.
00:01:45.080 - 00:02:11.104, Speaker A: It feels like it. Anyway, hopefully it sticks. It's about eight degrees right now and high of 14. It's a great weather and it's high of 18 next week. Hopefully it all sticks. We had about three weeks of snow and. Yeah, so anyway, so here is Klaus Peter, who runs the lithography studio at BBK Bethanyon in Berlin, downtown Kreuzberg, basically.
00:02:11.104 - 00:02:39.398, Speaker A: And yeah, Klaus showed me the. We did a one time go at doing lithography. So for those who don't know, lithography is drawing onto a stone with basically a grease pencil. And you can sort of see it in this drawing here on there. Just zoom in a bit. And you can also put India ink, I think that's what that is, some kind of ink. And so, and that creates a chemical reaction.
00:02:39.398 - 00:03:07.580, Speaker A: And then afterwards you put on gum Arabic and you put on. It's a very complicated process, actually. I have no idea how they would have actually figured out how to do this. Apparently it was invented in Bavaria. And I think, like the late 17 hundreds, if I remember correctly. So anyways, so we did this process, and as you can see here, it had, it wasn't very successful in terms of the actual image transferring. There were all sorts of reasons.
00:03:07.580 - 00:03:37.770, Speaker A: I may have drawn too light on the stone and close. Peter also said that he may have etched it too long. And when you're etching it, it's not like etching, like carving. It's etching is just applying a chemical process to it, which is gum arabic with nitric acid. And he said the nitric acid may have ate away too much at the image, but really, he said, normally I leave it for an hour and it's not a big deal. We left it for half an hour. And so it's probably me not drawing enough.
00:03:37.770 - 00:04:07.408, Speaker A: And I also did an under drawing to get the guides, and that may have actually interrupted the grease drawing. I suspect that was the biggest reason. So anyways, fascinating stuff, though. And so I'll be going back to the lithography studio there in Berlin regularly. Why wouldn't I? Right? So this is the first attempt. So that happened this week also. So nfts, I don't know if you've heard of nfts.
00:04:07.408 - 00:04:48.574, Speaker A: Non fungible tokens are getting very hot on in the art world, finally. They've been hot in the crypto world for the last maybe four or five months. And what an NFT is, is basically it's a non fungible token. And long story short, say something like bitcoin, which is a cryptocurrency, or ethereum, they are fungible tokens. They're all kind of identical tokens that can be traded back and forth and exchanged. A non fungible token, an NFt is basically like a cryptocurrency token based on Ethereum, but that is unique. So it's a special kind of ethereum token, and it's a unique.
00:04:48.574 - 00:05:32.584, Speaker A: And so this has created a total revolution in digital art, because now you're able to buy and sell digital art and people don't, a lot of people don't understand why you can just send an image and people will spend tens of thousands of even more dollars on an NFT. And the idea is it's just like a cryptocurrency. So when I send a bitcoin to you, you, I no longer have it, and you have it. And so that's one aspect of it. So it's not like a JPEG, where I leave a copy on my computer and then you have a copy. And so there's also the minting process. When you create the token, the artist creates the token.
00:05:32.584 - 00:06:16.476, Speaker A: And when you create the token, you leave a ledger. There is a record that this artist minted this work. So there's kind of an authenticity. And provenance is basically a much bigger deal than I kind of originally realized and is why this really works, because the artist minted it. It makes it the official work. And just like, if I said I have a Leonardo over here, nobody would believe me because of the provenance. Well, who, you know, if I had some image, where did that come from? And the whole history of the work and where it was passed down from and.
00:06:16.476 - 00:06:38.116, Speaker A: Oh, it came from Leonardo 500 years ago when he was in Milan on his way to Paris. Oh, okay, that's for real. So provenance. So that's why this NFT thing works. Now, I had been working on this digital art trading card series that I made on my phone called the Peloponnesian War. There's actually 200 of these images. Here's just a test print that I had done.
00:06:38.116 - 00:07:16.888, Speaker A: And what's funny is I was just doing it because I like trading cards, and I thought it was this kind of pop thing. I was going to make a trading card art book, which I still plan on doing. So you can see it sort of divides into nine, right? Just like trading card sheets. And again, I have, like, five or six of these big sheets of cards, just like a real trading card series. It's about 220 cards, about. So I'm doing test prints on it, and I realized I should release this as an NFT series because with nfts, you can also do editions of ten or editions of 100. And so it's kind of a beautiful thing.
00:07:16.888 - 00:07:48.374, Speaker A: I can just make editions of 100. And people could theoretically trade these online, and you could try and get the whole set. Maybe you make some rarer than others. So it's great, because me just intuitively wanting to make a trading card thing has kind of clashed with the larger culture, which is really into this crypto thing, which is blowing up, as we all know. They're really into this crypto art sort of trading card stuff. So it's a beautiful marriage all the. You know, I've been working on this since 2017.
00:07:48.374 - 00:08:21.380, Speaker A: And so, anyway, so I posted this on Instagram. And it's funny, my instagram was kind of quiet, so I was just posting this because I was like, oh, I need something to fill the void a little bit. And it actually got some of the most comments I've gotten. So the lesson there for me is let people know what you're doing. Like, don't feel like you need to be a perfectionist. Just let people know what you're doing. And that's kind of the best marketing that you can do, is start with letting people know that you're actually doing something.
00:08:21.380 - 00:08:39.836, Speaker A: So anyways, so that's today's update. I don't want to go too long here, but I kind of want to start doing these. I mean, it sounds crazy, but I think daily. And so hopefully I get better at this too, as we go along and. Yeah, that's it. And so today's plan. This is the artist journal.
00:08:39.836 - 00:09:12.494, Speaker A: So today's plan is to get outside because I spent pretty much the entire winter inside, it feels like. But also to do more of these prints, more of these test prints, because if you really zoom in, you can't see it on this image, you can't see it on this image. But I think we're using perceptual printing here. So I'm trying to perfect the printing technique and I got really thick. I actually have this here. You can actually see the scale. I have really thick hanamula 500 grams paper, which is actually just like a trading card, thick trading card.
00:09:12.494 - 00:09:28.694, Speaker A: Like a nice, kind of high quality old school matte trading card. So I'm really excited. I have this incredible printer that's over here, the Canon Pro Max 1000, and which I highly recommend. So that's all for now, and hopefully I'll be updating you very soon. Thank you.
